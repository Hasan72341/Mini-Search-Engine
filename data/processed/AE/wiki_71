Cable modems are primarily used to deliver broadband Internet access in the form of cable Internet, taking advantage of the high bandwidth of a HFC and RFoG network. They are commonly deployed in the Americas, Asia, Australia, and Europe.\nHistory.\nMITRE Cablenet.\nInternet Experiment Note (IEN) 96 (1979) describes an early RF cable modem system. From pages 2 and 3 of IEN 96:\nThe Cable-Bus System\nThe MITRE/Washington Cablenet system is based on a technology developed at MITRE/Bedford. Similar cable-bus systems are in operation at a number of government sites, e.g. Walter Reed Army Hospital, and the NASA Johnson Space Center, but these are all standalone, local-only networks.\nThe system uses standard community antenna television (CATV) coaxial cable and microprocessor based Bus Interface Units (BIUs) to connect subscriber computers and terminals to the cable. ... The cable bus consists of two parallel coaxial cables, one inbound and the other outbound. The inbound cable and outbound cable are connected at one end, the headend, and electrically terminated at their other ends. This architecture takes advantage of the well developed unidirectional CATV components. The topology is dendritic (i.e. branched like a tree).\nThe BIUs contain Radio Frequency (RF) modems which modulate a carrier signal to transmit digital information using 1 MHz of the available bandwidth in the 24\u00a0MHz frequency range. The remainder of the 294\u00a0MHz bandwidth can be used to carry other communication channels, such as off-the-air TV, FM, closed circuit TV, or a voice telephone system, or, other digital channels. The data rate of our test-bed system is 307.2\u00a0kbps.\nIEEE 802.3b (10BROAD36).\nThe IEEE 802 Committee defined 10BROAD36 in 802.3b-1985 as a IEEE 802.3/Ethernet broadband system to run up to over CATV coax network cabling. The word \"broadband\" as used in the original IEEE 802.3 specifications implied operation in frequency-division multiplexed (FDM) channel bands as opposed to digital \"baseband\" square-waveform modulations (also known as line coding), which begin near zero Hz and theoretically consume infinite frequency bandwidth. (In real-world systems, higher-order signal components become indistinguishable from background noise.) In the market 10BROAD36 equipment was not developed by many vendors nor deployed in many user networks as compared to equipment for IEEE 802.3/Ethernet baseband standards such as 10BASE5 (1983), 10BASE2 (1985), 10BASE-T (1990), etc.\nIEEE 802.7.\nThe IEEE 802 Committee also specified a broadband CATV digital networking standard in 1989 with 802.7-1989. However, like 10BROAD36, 802.7-1989 saw little commercial success.\nHybrid networks.\nHybrid Networks developed, demonstrated and patented the first high-speed, asymmetrical cable modem system in 1990. A key Hybrid Networks insight was that in the nascent days of the Internet, data downloading constitutes the majority of the data traffic, and this can be served adequately with a highly asymmetrical data network (i.e. a large downstream data pipe and many small upstream data pipes). This allowed CATV operators to offer high-speed data services immediately without first requiring an expensive system upgrade. Also key was that it saw that the upstream and downstream communications could be on the same or different communications media using different protocols working in each direction to establish a closed-loop communications system. The speeds and protocols used in each direction would be very different. The earliest systems used the public switched telephone network (PSTN) for the return path since very few cable systems were bi-directional. Later systems used CATV for the upstream as well as the downstream path. Hybrid's system architecture is used for most cable modem systems today.\nLANcity.\nLANcity was an early pioneer in cable modems, developing a proprietary system that was widely deployed in the U.S. LANcity, which was led by the Iranian-American engineer Rouzbeh Yassini, was then acquired by Bay Networks. Bay Networks was subsequently acquired by Nortel. Nortel at the time had formed a joint-venture with Antec called ARRIS Interactive. Because of contractual agreements with Antec involving this joint venture, Nortel spun the LANCity group out into the ARRIS Interactive joint-venture. ARRIS continues to make cable modems and cable modem termination system (CMTS) equipment compliant with the DOCSIS standard.\nZenith homeworks.\nZenith offered a cable modem technology using its own protocol which it introduced in 1993, being one of the first cable modem providers. The Zenith Cable Modem technology was used by several cable television systems in the United States and other countries, including Cox Communications San Diego, Knology in the Southeast United States, Ameritech's Americast service (later to be sold off to Wide Open West after the SBC / Ameritech merger), Cogeco in Hamilton Ontario and Cablevision du Nord de Qu\u00e9bec in Val-d'Or. Zenith Homeworks used BPSK (Bi-Phase Shift Keyed) modulation to achieve 500\u00a0Kbit/sec in 600\u00a0kHz, or 4 Mbit/sec in 6\u00a0MHz.\nCom21.\nCom21 was another early pioneer in cable modems, and quite successful until proprietary systems were made obsolete by the DOCSIS standardization. The Com21 system used a \"ComController\" as the central bridge in CATV network head-ends, the ComPort cable modem in various models and the NMAPS management system using HP OpenView as the platform. Later they also introduced a return path multiplexer to overcome noise problems when combining return path signals from multiple areas. The proprietary protocol was based on Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM). The central ComController switch was a modular system offering one downstream channel (transmitter) and one management module. The remaining slots could be used for upstream receivers (2 per card), dual Ethernet 10BaseT and later also Fast Ethernet and ATM interfaces. The ATM interface became the most popular, as it supported the increasing bandwidth demands and also supported VLANs.\nCom21 developed a DOCSIS modem, but the company filed for bankruptcy in 2003 and closed. The DOCSIS CMTS assets of COM21 were acquired by ARRIS.\nCDLP.\nCDLP was a proprietary system manufactured by Motorola. CDLP customer premises equipment (CPE) was capable of both PSTN (telephone network) and radio frequency (cable) return paths. The PSTN-based service was considered 'one-way cable' and had many of the same drawbacks as satellite Internet service; as a result, it quickly gave way to \"two-way cable.\" Cable modems that used the RF cable network for the return path were considered 'two-way cable', and were better able to compete with the bi-directional digital subscriber line (DSL) service. The standard is in little use now as new providers use, and existing providers having changed to, the DOCSIS standard. The Motorola CDLP proprietary CyberSURFR is an example of a device that was built to the CDLP standard, capable of a peak 10 Mbit/s downstream and 1.532 Mbit/s upstream. CDLP supported a maximum downstream bandwidth of 30 Mbit/s which could be reached by using several cable modems.\nThe Australian ISP BigPond employed this system when it started cable modem tests in 1996. For a number of years cable Internet access was only available in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane via CDLP. This network ran parallel to the newer DOCSIS system for several years. In 2004, the CDLP network was terminated and replaced by DOCSIS.\nCDLP has also been rolled out at the French cable operator Numericable before upgrading its IP broadband network using DOCSIS.\nDVB/DAVIC.\nDigital Video Broadcasting (DVB) and Digital Audio Visual Council (DAVIC) are European-formed organizations that developed some cable modem standards. However, these standards have not been as widely adopted as DOCSIS.\nIEEE 802.14.\nIn the mid-1990s the IEEE 802 committee formed a subcommittee (802.14) to develop a standard for cable modem systems. IEEE 802.14 developed a draft standard, which was ATM-based. However, the 802.14 working group was disbanded when North American multi system operators (MSOs) instead backed the then-fledgling DOCSIS 1.0 specification, which generally used best-effort service and was IP-based (with extension codepoints to support ATM for QoS in the future). MSOs were interested in quickly deploying service to compete for broadband Internet access customers instead of waiting on the slower, iterative, and deliberative processes of standards development committees. Albert A. Azzam was Secretary of the IEEE 802.14 Working Group, and his book, \"High-Speed Cable Modems\", describes many of the proposals submitted to 802.14.\nIETF.\nAlthough the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) generally does not generate complete cable modem standards, the IETF chartered Working Groups (WGs) that produced various standards related to cable modem technologies (including 802.14, DOCSIS, PacketCable, and others). In particular, the IETF WGs on IP over Cable Data Network (IPCDN) and IP over Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) produced some standards applicable to cable modem systems, primarily in the areas of Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) Management Information Bases (MIBs) for cable modems and other networking equipment that operates over CATV networks.\nDOCSIS.\nIn the late 1990s, a consortium of US cable operators, known as \"MCNS\" formed to quickly develop an open and interoperable cable modem specification. The group essentially combined technologies from the two dominant proprietary systems at the time, taking the physical layer from the Motorola CDLP system and the MAC layer from the LANcity system. When the initial specification had been drafted, the MCNS consortium handed over control of it to CableLabs which maintained the specification, promoted it in various standards organizations (notably SCTE and ITU), developed a certification testing program for cable modem equipment, and has since drafted multiple extensions to the original specification.\nWhile deployed DOCSIS RFI 1.0 equipment generally only supported best-effort service, the DOCSIS RFI 1.0 Interim-01 document discussed quality of service (QoS) extensions and mechanisms using IntServ, RSVP, RTP, and Synchronous Transfer Mode (STM) telephony (as opposed to ATM). DOCSIS RFI 1.1 later added more robust and standardized QoS mechanisms to DOCSIS. DOCSIS 2.0 added support for S-CDMA PHY, while DOCSIS 3.0 added IPv6 support and channel bonding to allow a single cable modem to use concurrently more than one upstream channel and more than one downstream channel in parallel.\nVirtually all cable modems operating in the field today are compliant with one of the DOCSIS versions. Because of the differences in the European PAL and US's NTSC systems two main versions of DOCSIS exist, DOCSIS and EuroDOCSIS. The main differences are found in the width of RF-channels: 6\u00a0MHz for the US and 8\u00a0MHz for Europe. A third variant of DOCSIS was developed in Japan and has seen limited deployment in that country.\nAlthough interoperability \"was the whole point of the DOCSIS project,\" most cable operators only approve a very restricted list of cable modems on their network, identifying the 'allowed' modems by their brand, models, sometimes firmware version and occasionally going as far as imposing a hardware version of the modem, instead of simply allowing a supported DOCSIS version.\nMultimedia over Coax Alliance.\nIn 2004, the Multimedia over Coax Alliance (MoCA) was established to develop industry standards for the connected home using the existing coaxial cabling. Initially developed for in-home networking with MoCA 1.0/1.1, the MoCA standards have continued to develop with MoCA 2.0/2.1 in 2010 and MoCa 2.5 in 2016.\nIn 2017, Multimedia over Coax Alliance introduced MoCA Access specification, based on the MoCA 2.5 standard, suitable for addressing broadband network access in-building using coaxial cabling. MoCA Access extends MoCA 2.5 in-home networking to fit operators and ISPs that are installing fiber-to-the-basement/drop point (FTTB/FTTdp) and want to use the existing coax for connection to each apartment or house.\"\nMultimedia terminal adapter.\nWith the development of voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) telephony, analog telephone adapters (ATA) have been incorporated into many cable modems for providing telephone service. An embedded ATA is known as an \"embedded multimedia terminal adapter\" (E-MTA).\nMany cable TV service providers also offer VoIP-based telephone service via the cable infrastructure (PacketCable). Some high-speed Internet customers may use VoIP telephony by subscribing to a third-party service, such as Vonage, MagicJack+ and NetTALK.\nNetwork architectural functions.\nIn network topology, a cable modem is a network bridge that conforms to IEEE 802.1D for Ethernet networking (with some modifications). The cable modem bridges Ethernet frames between a customer LAN and the coax network. Technically, it is a modem because it must modulate data to transmit it over the cable network, and it must demodulate data from the cable network to receive it.\nIt implements an Ethernet PHY on its LAN interface, and a DOCSIS-defined cable-specific PHY on its HFC cable interface. The term \"cable modem\" refers to this cable-specific PHY. The Network Layer is implemented as an IP host in that it has its own IP address used by the network operator to maintain the device. In the transport layer the cable modem supports UDP in association with its own IP address, and it supports filtering based on TCP and UDP port numbers to, for example, block forwarding of NetBIOS traffic out of the customer's LAN. In the Application Layer, the cable modem supports certain protocols that are used for management and maintenance, notably Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), SNMP, and TFTP.\nSome cable modems may incorporate a router and a DHCP server to provide the LAN with IP network addressing. From a data forwarding and network topology perspective, this router functionality is typically kept distinct from the cable modem functionality (at least logically) even though the two may share a single enclosure and appear as one unit, sometimes called a residential gateway. So, the cable modem function will have its own IP address and MAC address as will the router.\nCable modem flap.\nCable modems can have a problem known in industry jargon as \"flap\" or \"flapping\". A modem flap is when the connection by the modem to the head-end has been dropped (gone offline) and then comes back online. The time offline or rate of flap is not typically recorded, only the incidence. While this is a common occurrence and usually unnoticed, if a modem's flap is extremely high, these disconnects can cause service to be disrupted. If there are usability problems due to flap the typical cause is a defective modem or very high amounts of traffic on the service provider's network (upstream utilization too high). Types of flap include reinsertions, hits and misses, and power adjustments.\nKnown vulnerabilities.\nIn January 2020, a vulnerability affecting cable modems using Broadcom chipsets was disclosed and named Cable Haunt. Security researchers say that the vulnerability affects hundreds of millions of devices. Exploits are possible because of the use of default credentials in the spectrum analyzer component of the modem (mostly used for debugging purposes) accessible through a network port which is open by default in the vulnerable models.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The population was 2,122 at the 2020 United States census. Greater Kensington encompasses the entire 20895 ZIP code, with a population of 19,753 in 2020.\nHistory.\nThe area around Rock Creek where Kensington is located was primarily agricultural until 1873, when the B&amp;O Railroad completed the Metropolitan Branch across Montgomery County. A community arose where the new railroad line intersected the old Rockville-to-Bladensburg road. This early settlement was first known as \"Knowles Station\".\nIn the early 1890s, Washington developer Brainard Warner began purchasing land parcels to build a planned Victorian community, complete with church, library, and local newspaper. Fascinated by a recent trip to London, Warner named his development \"Kensington Park\", the tenth and largest subdivision in the area. When the town was incorporated in 1894, Warner convinced the mayor and council to name it Kensington.\nOriginally a farming community at Knowles Station, Kensington developed into a summer refuge for Washington residents wishing to escape the capital's humidity. As years passed and more residents remained year-round, Kensington evolved into a commuter suburb. Commuters reached downtown Washington, D.C., on B&amp;O passenger trains and, beginning in 1895, a streetcar line founded as Chevy Chase Lake &amp; Kensington Railway and later called the Kensington Railway Company.\nThe large southernmost section originally mapped out by Warner remains largely unchanged, and is a historically preserved zone. The only major changes in the town's basic layout have been the bridging of the original railroad crossing in 1937, and the extension and widening of Connecticut Avenue, the town's main thoroughfare, in 1957. As well, the right-of-way of the streetcar line, which was replaced with bus service in 1935, was paved to become Kensington Parkway.\nIn March 1975, Kensington gained attention regionally when Sheila and Katherine Lyon walked to Wheaton Plaza, a local shopping mall, and never returned home. Their abduction and murder was solved only in 2017.\nThe historic core of Kensington was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Kensington Historic District in 1980.\nIn the early 21st century, the town gained national attention three times in 10 months for events within a quarter-mile radius. In December 2001, the town responded to complaints from anonymous citizens by banning Santa Claus from the annual holiday parade. Protesters arrived at the parade en masse, including dozens of Santas riding everything from motorcycles to fire trucks. Eight months later, an Amtrak train derailed near the town center when the tracks separated at an overheated joint, injuring 95. And on October 2, 2002, Lori Ann Lewis-Rivera became the fifth victim of the \"Beltway snipers\" while cleaning her car at a Kensington gas station.\nGeography.\nKensington is located in Montgomery County, northwest of Silver Spring, northeast of Bethesda, west of Wheaton and southeast of Rockville. Its latitude is 39\u00b01\u203248\u2033N, longitude 77\u00b04\u203230\u2033W.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.\nThe Kensington post office (ZIP Code 20895) serves a larger area, including the neighboring town of Chevy Chase View, most of the unincorporated neighborhoods known by the Census Bureau as North Kensington and South Kensington, and small portions of North Bethesda and the Wheaton Planning District.\nThe Washington D.C. Temple in South Kensington is a local landmark, thanks to its striking design and its prominence along the Capital Beltway. D.C.-area traffic reports often refer to the \"Mormon temple\" or \"temple\".\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2010 census.\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 2,213 people, 870 households, and 563 families residing in the town.

At the time of the 2020 United States census, Gaithersburg had a population of 69,657, making it the third-largest incorporated city and the ninth-most populous community in the state. Gaithersburg is located to the northwest of Washington, D.C., and is considered a suburb and a primary city within the Washington metropolitan area. Gaithersburg was incorporated as a town in 1878 and as a city in 1968.\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is headquartered in Gaithersburg directly west of I-270. Other major employers in the city include IBM, Lockheed Martin Information Systems and Global Services business area headquarters, AstraZeneca. Gaithersburg is also the location of the garrison of the United States Army Reserve Legal Command.\nHistory.\n18th century.\nGaithersburg was settled in 1765 as a small agricultural settlement known as Log Town near the present-day Summit Hall on Ralph Crabb's 1725 land grant \"Deer Park\". The northern portion of the land grant was purchased by Henry Brookes, and he built his brick home \"Montpelier\" there, starting with a log cabin, built between 1780 and 1783. In 1802, Benjamin Gaither built his home on the land. In 1807, Gaither married Brooke's daughter Margaret, and Benjamin and Margaret inherited a portion of Henry Brooke's land prior to his death. By the 1850s the area had ceased to be called Log Town and was known to inhabitants as Gaithersburg.\n19th century.\nThe Forest Oak Post Office, named for a large tree in the town, was located in Gaither's store in 1851.\nOn July 10, 1864, using the route of present-day Maryland Route 355, over 10,000 Confederate troops camped overnight in the area, including the present Bohrer Park, after a one-day march from Frederick after the Battle of Monocacy. The next day the troops continued towards Washington, D.C. in an unsuccessful attempt to take the national capital.\nWhen the railroad was built through town in 1873, the new station was called Gaithersburg, an officially-recognized name for the community for the first time. Also in 1873, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad constructed a station at Gaithersburg, designed by Ephraim Francis Baldwin as part of his well-known series of Victorian stations in Maryland. Rapid growth occurred shortly thereafter, and on April 5, 1878, the town was officially incorporated as the Town of Gaithersburg.\nGaithersburg boomed during the late 19th century and churches, schools, a mill, grain elevators, stores, and hotels were built. Much of this development focused around the railroad station.\nIn 1899, Gaithersburg was selected as one of six global locations for the construction of an International Latitude Observatory as part of a project to measure the Earth's wobble on its polar axis; as of 2007, the Gaithersburg Latitude Observatory is the only National Historic Landmark in Gaithersburg. The observatory and five other observatories in Japan, Italy, Russia, and the U.S. gathered information, which, along with information from satellites, is used to determine polar motion, the size, shape, and physical properties of the Earth, and to aid the space program through the precise navigational patterns of orbiting satellites. The Gaithersburg station operated until 1982 when computerization rendered the manual observation obsolete.\n20th century.\nIn 1968, Gaithersburg was upgraded from a town to a city. In the late 1960s and 1970s, a 1,000-acre tract on I-270 became part of IBM's headquarters. \nGaithersburg remained a predominantly rural farm town until the 1970s when more construction began. As the population grew, with homes spreading throughout the area, Gaithersburg began taking on a suburban and semi-urban feel, leaving its farming roots behind. During the late 1990s and 2000s, it had become one of the most economically and ethnically diverse areas in the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Area as well as the State of Maryland, with people from all walks of life calling Gaithersburg home. This can be seen in the local schools, with Gaithersburg High School and Watkins Mill High School having two of the most diverse student bodies in the region.\nDuring a 1997 rainstorm, the 295-year-old forest oak tree that gave its name to the Forest Oak Post Office crashed down. The tree served as the inspiration for the city's logo, which is also featured prominently on the city's flag.\n21st century.\nIn 2007, parts of the film \"Body of Lies\" were filmed in the city, at a building on 100 Edison Park Drive. The film was released in 2008 and the building is now the Montgomery County Police Department's headquarters.\nOn July 16, 2010, Gaithersburg was part of the area where a 3.6 magnitude earthquake was felt, one of the strongest to occur in Maryland.\nAfter years of decline and loss of tenants, including three of its four anchor stores in 2019, Lakeforest Mall closed on March 31, 2023, with plans to demolish it and redevelop the area.\nGaithersburg is also the location of the United States Army Reserve Legal Command.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2022 ACS.\nAs of the 2022 American Community Survey, there were 68,952 people and 24,523 households in the town.

More generally, convolution in one domain (e.g., time domain) equals point-wise multiplication in the other domain (e.g., frequency domain). Other versions of the convolution theorem are applicable to various Fourier-related transforms.\nFunctions of a continuous variable.\nConsider two functions formula_1 and formula_2 with Fourier transforms formula_3 and formula_4:\nformula_5\nwhere formula_6 denotes the Fourier transform operator. The transform may be normalized in other ways, in which case constant scaling factors (typically formula_7 or formula_8) will appear in the convolution theorem below. The convolution of formula_9 and formula_10 is defined by:\nformula_11\nIn this context the asterisk denotes convolution, instead of standard multiplication. The tensor product symbol formula_12 is sometimes used instead.\nThe convolution theorem states that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nApplying the inverse Fourier transform formula_13 produces the corollary:\nConvolution theorem\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe theorem also generally applies to multi-dimensional functions.\nThis theorem also holds for the Laplace transform, the two-sided Laplace transform and, when suitably modified, for the Mellin transform and Hartley transform (see Mellin inversion theorem). It can be extended to the Fourier transform of abstract harmonic analysis defined over locally compact abelian groups.\nPeriodic convolution (Fourier series coefficients).\nConsider formula_14-periodic functions formula_15 \u00a0 and \u00a0 formula_16 which can be expressed as periodic summations:\nformula_17 \u00a0 and \u00a0 formula_18\nIn practice the non-zero portion of components formula_9 and formula_10 are often limited to duration formula_21 but nothing in the theorem requires that.\nThe Fourier series coefficients are:\nformula_22\nwhere formula_6 denotes the Fourier series integral.\nformula_28\nformula_29\nis also formula_14-periodic, and is called a periodic convolution.\nThe corresponding convolution theorem is:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;!--&lt;templatestyles src=\"Math_proof/styles.css\" /&gt;Derivation of Eq.2\nrole=\"presentation\" class=\"mw-collapsible mw-archivedtalk mw-collapsed \" style=\"color:inherit; background: transparent; text-align: left; border: 1px solid Silver; margin: 0.2em auto auto; width:100%; clear: both; padding: 1px;\"\n \\, d\\tau\\\\\n&amp;=\\underbrace{\\left(\\int_P\\ u_{_P}(\\tau)\\ e^{-i 2\\pi k \\tau/P} d\\tau\\right)}_{P\\cdot U[k]}\\ V[k].\n\\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;\nFunctions of a discrete variable (sequences).\nBy a derivation similar to Eq.1, there is an analogous theorem for sequences, such as samples of two continuous functions, where now formula_6 denotes the discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT) operator.

The discrete convolution:\nformula_51\nis also formula_42-periodic, and is called a periodic convolution.

Equivalently, bandlimited functions, such as the function that is constantly formula_74 are smooth \"slowly growing\" ordinary functions. If, for example, formula_75 is the Dirac comb both equations yield the Poisson summation formula and if, furthermore, formula_76 is the Dirac delta then formula_77 is constantly one and these equations yield the Dirac comb identity.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAdditional resources.\nFor a visual representation of the use of the convolution theorem in signal processing, see:"}
{"id": "53269", "revid": "50695106", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53269", "title": "Ramstein Air Base", "text": "US Air Force base in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany\nRamstein Air Base () is a United States Air Force installation located in Rhineland-Palatinate, southwestern Germany. It serves as the headquarters for the United States Air Forces in Europe \u2013 Air Forces Africa (USAFE-AFAFRICA) and NATO Allied Air Command (AIRCOM). The base plays a key role in supporting forward military operations, particularly those deploying to Eastern Europe and Africa.\nConstructed between 1949 and 1952 by the French Army and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Ramstein Air Base is part of the larger Kaiserslautern Military Community (KMC), which houses around 54,000 American service members and over 5,400 U.S. civilian employees. Additionally, more than 6,200 German workers are employed within the KMC. Air Force units in the KMC employ nearly 9,800 military personnel, supported by approximately 11,100 family members.\nRamstein AB alone hosts over 16,200 military personnel, U.S. civilians, and contractors. The base is located near the town of Ramstein-Miesenbach, with the east gate about from Kaiserslautern, commonly known as \"K-Town\" among Americans. Other nearby towns include Landstuhl, located from the base's west gate.\nHistory.\nDevelopment and establishment.\nIn 1940, construction of today's was stopped when a bridge that was being built across the Rhine River near Mannheim collapsed, leaving a section of autobahn that could not be used. A part of the unused autobahn to the west of Mannheim, near Kaiserslautern, was used as an airstrip by the Luftwaffe. The airstrip was also used by the advancing U.S. Army Air Forces during the final months of World WarII. The old autobahn section is still used as the access road to the east and west gates of the base and the A6 was rebuilt south of the air base after the war.\nDuring the initial postwar era, the USAAF repaired several former Luftwaffe airfields in Bavaria, part of the American occupation zone of Germany.\nThe area was a swamp that had to be built up by . A train line was laid out from in a yoke shape around to the current base and back down to the Landstuhl spur in 1948, by agreement of the U.S. and French Occupational Forces. Trainloads of earth were moved over the line and spread over the base's current area to raise it to its current level. Once the ground was level, construction work began. Two bases were laid out. Landstuhl Air Base on the south side and Ramstein Air Station (station, no airstrip) on the north. From 1948 to the opening of the bases in 1953, it was the largest one spot construction site in Europe employing over 270,000 workers at one time.\nEnough construction was completed in mid-1952 that LandstuhlAB was opened on 5 August. Its facilities included a runway, dispersal hardstands, a control tower, ramps, and other flight-related facilities and the associated flying and support units. On 1 February 1952, Det1, 86th Fighter-Bomber Wing arrived at LandstuhlAB from Neubiberg Air Base near Munich.\nOn 1 June 1953, Ramstein Air Station was opened. Ramstein was the location of headquarters, Twelfth Air Force, and supported family housing, base exchange, commissary, dependents' schools and other administrative offices for the WAFs (Women's Air Force). The barracks that were built at Ramstein AS were used to house WAFs and single women that worked as U.S. Government employees at both RamsteinAS and LandstuhlAB. On 27 April 1953, Headquarters, Twelfth Air Force was activated on Ramstein Air Base, having moved from its joint facilities with HQ USAFE at Wiesbaden AB. What was not generally known at the time and not made public until after the end of the Cold War in 1993, was the desire to have HQTwelfth Air Force in close proximity to the Air Defense Operations Center (ADOC)\u2009\u2014\u2009Kindsbach, 'Kindsbach Cave'\u2009\u2014\u2009the site of NATO's underground combat operations center.\nOperational history.\nThe 86th Air Base Group was activated as the main base support unit for Landstuhl, while the 7030th HQ Support Group was the main base support unit for Ramstein. On 1 December 1957, the two bases were consolidated into the largest NATO-controlled air base in service on the continent. It was called \"Ramstein\u2013Landstuhl Air Base\", but later, after the West German government continued construction of the A6 autobahn from Kaiserslautern to Saarbr\u00fccken, the autobahn cut off access at the south of the base, which is where the main gate was within the city limits of Landstuhl. The main gate was moved to the west side of the base which was located in the town of Ramstein. The two bases were joined and the current Kisling Memorial Drive cut off to the public which unified the bases. In 1961, the base was officially named \"Ramstein Air Base.\"\nOne legacy of the two separate air bases is that the north side of Ramstein retained a separate APO from the south side. The north side (Ramstein AB) is APOAE09012, while the south side (LandstuhlAB) is APOAE09009. There existed separate Combat Support Groups, the 7030th for the north side, and the 86th for the south side until their consolidation in the 1980s, when both were merged into the 377th Combat Support Wing. There is still a north and south side Fitness Center. The current northside Community Center previously housed the WAF NCO Club. As well, there were two Movie Theaters on the North side and two on the South side. Currently, only two still stand on the north side: a remodeled Nightingale Theater (known before as the Four Corners Theater) on the corner across from the Base gas Station, and the north side AAFES dry cleaners that was known as the Ramstein Rocket Theater.\nNear the Ramstein Air Base is the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center (LRMC), operated by the United States Army. Although part of the Kaiserslautern Military Community, LRMC has a separate history and was never a part of Ramstein or Landstuhl Air Bases, although both facilities have utilized the medical facilities at LRMC, since they were established in 1953. The U.S. Department of Defense built a new Medical Center on the current U.S. Army Weilerbach Storage Installation just to the east of RamsteinAB. Construction is to be completed in and around 2024. It is a twelve-story facility to house all departments of LRMC and the current Ramstein AB Clinic along with Dental Clinic facilities for the whole KMC. In turn, the East Gate to RamsteinAB will be extended from its current location to just off the Autobahn 6 Einsiedlerhof exit to the base at what is known as the Elvis Gate.\nFrom 2004 to 2006, Ramstein Air Base underwent an extensive expansion with a major construction project \u2013 including an all-new airport terminal, among other new facilities, through the so-called Rhein-Main Transition Program which was initiated in support of the total closure of Rhein-Main Air Base on 30 December 2005 and transferring all its former capacities to Ramstein Air Base (70%) and Spangdahlem Air Base (30%).\nRamstein served as temporary housing for the United States men's national soccer team during the 2006World Cup.\n Landstuhl and Ramstein were separate bases until 1 December 1957\nMajor USAF units assigned.\nSource: Fletcher, \"Air Force Bases, Volume II\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMajor U.S. Army units assigned.\nSource: Fletcher, \"Air Force Bases, Volume II\"\nOperational history.\n86th Wing.\nReassigned from Neubiberg Air Base, West Germany in 1952, except for a period between 1968 and 1973, the 86th Wing, under various designations, has been the main operational and host unit at Ramstein Air Base.\nThroughout the 1950s, the 86th was primarily a Fighter-Bomber Wing. In 1960, it was realigned to an air defense mission and became the 86th Air Division (Defense). The 86th AD was inactivated in 1968. Returning as an F-4 Phantom II Tactical Fighter Wing in 1973, the 86th TFW performed that mission until 1994, deploying components to the Middle East during the 1990 Gulf War.\nOn 14 August 1976, the Strategic Air Command 306th Strategic Wing was activated at Ramstein with a KC-135 air refueling and an RC-135 reconnaissance mission. The 306th also functioned as the focal point for all SAC operations in Europe and as liaison between SAC and USAFE. The wing moved to RAF Mildenhall, England on 1 July 1978.\nIn June 1985, the 316th Air Division was activated, centralizing command authority at Ramstein. The 86 TFW became the division's flight operations arm, while the newly formed 377th Combat Support Wing, also activated in 1985, became responsible for the logistical and administrative support on base, replacing the 86th and 7030 Combat Support Wings. On 28 August 1988, Ramstein Air Base was the site of the tragic Ramstein airshow disaster, which killed 72 spectators and three pilots, and injured hundreds.\nAfter the Cold War, the 86th was realigned to become the 86th Airlift Wing. On 1 July 1993, the 55th Aeromedical Airlift Squadron moved from the 435thAW at Rhein-Main Air Base Germany to Ramstein. On 1 October, the 75th and 76th Airlift Squadron arrived at Ramstein from the 60th AW at Travis Air Force Base California, and 437thAW at Charleston AFB South Carolina, respectively. A year later on 1 October 1994, the 37thAirlift Squadron was transferred to Ramstein from Rhein-Main.\nIn 1999, the activation of the 86th Contingency Response Group brought the airfield and aerial port operations and provision of force protection at contingency airfields mission to the wing.\nOn 24 May 2004, the 38th Combat Support Wing was activated to enhance support to USAFE geographically separated units. This wing was inactivated in 2007. The 521st Air Mobility Operations Wing was activated on 4 September 2008. The wing is the headquarters for the existing 721st Air Mobility Operations Group at Ramstein and the 521st AMOG at Naval Station Rota, Spain. The 521st AMOW provides an enhanced level of control for the AMC route structure in Europe, which includes critical locations for getting people, cargo and patients to and from current war zones.\nBy 1984, the Kindsbach Cave had become too small and its cost for renovation too high. The USAFE vacated the facility and, on 31 October 1993, control was returned to the German government and the German government returned the facility to the original owner of the land. Today, the Kindsbach Cave is private property, though tours of the cave can be arranged. The cave is overgrown by vegetation, trees, and new housing.\nThe new 521st Air Mobility Operations Wing stood up on 4 September 2008. As of \u00a02020[ [update]], the commander of the 521st AMOW is Colonel Adrienne Williams.\nIn December 2023 a new Space Force component stands up at Ramstein Air Base.\n26th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing.\nOn 7 March 1966, French President Charles de Gaulle announced that France would withdraw from NATO's integrated military structure. The United States was informed that it must remove its military forces from France by 1 April 1967.\nAs a result, the 26th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, based at Toul-Rosieres Air Base, France, and two of its squadrons, the 38th and 32d, equipped with the RF-4C Phantom II, were relocated to Ramstein on 5 October 1966.\nAssigned squadrons of the 26th TRW at Ramstein were:\nWhile at Ramstein, the 26th TRW acquired a number of other units with different flying missions. One function gained by the 26 TRW, almost immediately after arriving at Ramstein, was the maintenance and flying of the HQ USAFE liaison aircraft. In addition, the Wing was responsible for flying members of the HQ USAFE staff to Air Force and NATO bases throughout Europe. In addition, the 26th TRW was only designated as a flight, because of its small size. It consisted of a mixture of aircraft, including: T-29s, T-33s, T-39s, C-54s, O-2s, H-19s, and UH-1s.\nIn 1971 a detachment of the 630th Military Airlift Support Squadron from Rhein-Main Air Base was assigned to Ramstein and a large cargo aerial port constructed. This allowed Military Airlift Command C-141 and C-5 Galaxy aircraft to use Ramstein as a transshipment point for material, which was then moved within USAFE by C-130 tactical transports.\nIn the spring of 1972, the 7th Special Operations Squadron (SOS) was assigned flying C-130Es, C-47As, and UH-1Ns. Because of the special operations mission of the 7 SOS, it reported directly to HQ USAFE for operational control.\nAs part of operation \"Creek Action\", a command-wide effort to realign functions and streamline operations, HQ USAFE transferred the 26th TRW from Ramstein to Zweibr\u00fccken Air Base and the 86th Tactical Fighter Wing was reassigned from Zweibr\u00fccken to Ramstein on 31 January 1973.\nNATO command center.\nFrom its inception, Ramstein was designed as a NATO command base. In 1957, Ramstein provided support for NATO's HQ Fourth Allied Tactical Air Force, which moved to Ramstein from Trier Air Base on 10 November 1957 upon the closure of that facility. Also on that date, HQ Twelfth Air Force was transferred to Bergstrom Air Force Base, Texas, and was assigned to Tactical Air Command. It was replaced by HQ Seventeenth Air Force (USAFE) which was moved from North Africa. In turn, the 17th AF was replaced by its mother unit HQ USAFE from Lindsey Air Station, Wiesbaden, West Germany in 1973. The HQ 17th AF was moved to Sembach AB at that time and controlled all USAF Air Divisions and Wings north of the Alps, with the exception of the British Isles and Scandinavia, which were controlled by HQ 3rd AF at Mildenhall.\nOn 31 January 1973, several headquarters were relocated into and out of Ramstein, when SeventeenthAF moved to Sembach Air Base to make room for the expected move of HQUSAFE to Ramstein. This entire operation, code-named \"Creek Action\", was carried out as part of the USAF's new worldwide policy of locating the most vital headquarters in thinly populated rural areas rather than near cities. Later, HQ USAFE was moved, due to the fact that US Intelligence found that the Soviets had plans to invade Western Europe through the Fulda Gap in West Germany. The military thought to move vital HQs the western bank of the Rhine for protection.\nAs a result of this policy change, Ramstein air base became a large multi-national NATO center: in addition to the USAFE's headquarters, it also housed the new NATO headquarters of the Allied Air Forces Central Europe (AAFCE).\nThe AAFCE also commanded the 2nd Allied Tactical Air Force (2ATAF) and the 4th ATAF. The 4th ATAF, which had been headquartered at Ramstein for many years, included the 1st Canadian Air Group, 1st and 2nd Divisions of the West German Air Force, and units of the USAFE's 3rd and 17th Air Force. HQ USAFE fully completed its move from Wiesbaden to Ramstein in early 1991.\nWith USAFE's arrival in 1973, Ramstein entered a period of expansion. The dual commander of the 316th AD / 86 TFW became host commander of Americans living in the Kaiserslautern Military Community instead of the US Army 21st Commanding General. The Wiesbaden USAF Community was then traded to US Army Control for an even switch. The KMC from the 1950s to the early 1990s had an average population of 110,000 Americans, outnumbering the Germans in Kaiserslautern during that period.\nAllied Air Forces Central Europe was established at Ramstein on 28 June 1974. Ramstein subsequently provided support for other headquarters including the 322nd Airlift Division that arrived on 23 June 1978, and SAC's 7th Air Division that arrived on 1 July 1978. In December 1980, HQ Fourth Allied Tactical Air Force was moved from Ramstein to Heidelberg and co-located with HQ Central Army Group.\nIn 1984, an enlisted airman (Sgt Darrel Dietlein), assigned to the 1964th Communications Group, solicited National Headquarters Civil Air Patrol to charter the first \"Cadet Squadron\" in West Germany, naming the unit \"Ramstein Cadet Squadron\" and becoming the unit's first commander as a CAP First Lieutenant. The Ramstein Cadet Squadron was formed with Captain Mark Bailey serving as the unit's first liaison officer, as well as other like minded military volunteers and roughly six cadets. To this day, the squadron enjoys vibrant member participation, as well as base support, hosting the European Encampments along with their traditional military studies, cadet programs and aerospace education efforts. The Ramstein Cadet Squadron commander as of \u00a02022[ [update]] is 1st Lt Cody Chenowith. The squadron is the central hub for all CAP units in Europe. Membership as of \u00a02024[ [update]] was 55 members. In subsequent years, a companion cadet squadron was formed at Spangdahlem Air Base. Distance learning cadets are located at SHAPE, Belgium and Hohenfels, Germany. Additionally, the Ramstein Cadet Squadron is the second oldest and continuous operating unit on the installation and even predating the 86th Air Wing.\nToday, the base is home to the Allied Air Command, which is responsible to Joint Force Command Brunssum, the only and main NATO command unit on Ramstein AB.\nADOC Kindsbach.\nClose to Ramstein was the site of Air Defense Operations Center (ADOC)\u2009\u2014\u2009Kindsbach, AKA 'Kindsbach Cave' \u2013 the site of Europe's underground combat operations center.\nThe facility was located in a former German western front command headquarters. The French took control of the underground bunker after World War II, and USAFE assumed control in 1953. After major renovations, USAFE opened the center on 15 August 1954.\nThe center was a state-of-the-art, 67-room, facility where USAFE could have led an air war against the Soviet Union. The center had a digital computer to work out bombing problems, cryptographic equipment for coded message traffic and its own photo lab to develop reconnaissance photos. Responsible for an air space extending deep behind the Iron Curtain, the center interacted directly with The Pentagon, NATO, Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe and all USAFE bases. With its massive telephone switchboard and 80 teletype machines, the cave was well connected to the world, receiving more than 1,000 calls a day.\nAs a further measure of protection, the cave was fully self-contained with its own water supply, electric backup-generators, climate controls, dining facilities and sleeping accommodations for its 125-man crew. Visitor passes were rarely issued to this secret facility.\nThroughout the years, leadership changed but USAFE led the operations through numbered Air Forces. The center's commander was the USAFE Advanced Echelon. The glassed-in office was on the top floor of the three-story underground command center. Directly under the office was the management for offensive air operations. And the bottom floor office was the management for defensive air operations \u2013 to include support for U.S. Army forces and West German Civil Defense. All three offices had a full view of the massive Air Operations Center map on the opposing wall.\nThe AOC was the largest room in the complex. Its three-story map was used to plot minute-by-minute movements of friendly and unidentified aircraft. But the center was much more than just a tracking station, because it could also react to threats. They always knew the current operational status of air weapons in theater including missiles, and could dispatch armed response \"at a moment's notice\".\nBy the early 1960s, the manual plotting system used to track aircraft at the cave and elsewhere throughout West Germany was too slow and inaccurate for the quick responses necessary. Beginning in 1962, airmen trained in the new 412L air weapons control system began to arrive in Germany and at the cave. Over the next year, the new GE semi-automatic system was installed. When complete at the cave, the current air picture over East and West Germany, as well as parts of the Soviet bloc, was displayed on a screen with radar information provided by various 412L sites located throughout West Germany. Senior U.S. staff monitored the dynamic display 24/7. Over the next several years, additional 412L sites throughout Germany joined the network, until the manual system had been totally replaced.\nDrone war control center.\nIn April 2015, Ramstein Air Base was reported by German and international media as an important control center in the drone war staged under the Obama administration against targets in areas like Pakistan, Yemen, Afghanistan and Somalia. The German government claimed not to have been informed about this function of the U.S. base.\nIn a TV and online documentary, the German Das Erste channel cited 2014 reports from Norddeutscher Rundfunk, WDR, and the that revealed Ramstein to be an important hub in the drone war against terror suspects. New data, provided by Edward Snowden affiliate Glenn Greenwald, supported these reports with classified documents from inside the U.S. administration and were also presented in the Citizenfour video documentary. The revelation of US drone activities from Ramstein lead to nationwide anti-drone protests under the banner of \"Stop Ramstein Air Base\".\nIn 2019, three Yemenis who lost relatives in a 2012 US drone strike took legal action against the German government for aiding the breaking of international law by the United States, by tolerating these operations from Ramstein. The German Higher Administrative Court in M\u00fcnster ruled that the German government must take appropriate measures to control whether the US army follows international law at Ramstein Air Base. However, the possibilities of Germany to control US activities on their territory are very limited as the United States has jurisdiction over Ramstein Air Base. In July 2025 the Federal Constitutional Court dismissed the case of two Yemenis who wanted the German government to monitor American Forces activities in Ramstein and put pressure on them to abide international law in global operations.\nIllegal arms and munition transports.\nIn 2015, the Serbian newspaper reported about Ramstein Air Base being used by the United States Armed Forces to transport arms and munitions to Syria. At the end of 2017, an anonymous U.S. official stated that the U.S. does, indeed, use Ramstein Air Base to supplement Syrian rebels with arms and munition. The German Federal Government stated that it did not grant the necessary permits for these transports, nor that it had been informed about them. The Kaiserslautern public prosecutor's office did not initiate any official investigations. She checked generally accessible sources, on which some of the press articles mentioned were based, and obtained information from the authorities involved in monitoring foreign trade. According to the review, there was \"no evidence of concrete arms transports to Syria via Ramstein\". However, the journalistic conclusion cannot be ruled out, according to the prosecution authority. Previous investigations of the Ramstein Air Base, such as the Abu Omar case, have proven to be unsuccessful. If the investigations into the arms and ammunition transports had been successful, this would have constituted a violation of the German \"Kriegswaffenkontrollgesetz\" and the Foreign Trade and Payments Act.\nAfghanistan Evacuation.\nIn late Summer 2021, Ramstein Air Base became the transfer point for thousands of Afghan civilians fleeing Afghanistan following the fall of Kabul back into Taliban hands as U.S. and NATO forces withdrew from the country. Civilian airlines under the Civil Reserve Air Fleet, such as Delta, American, Eastern, and United were allowed to land at Ramstein and serve as flights to take Afghan families and other supporters of the U.S. and NATO forces to new lives in the United States. Those who had to stay on the base were cared for in makeshift living centers which were set up to tend to their needs until they could be processed and flown to the United States.\nRusso-Ukrainian War.\nOn 26 April 2022, Ramstein Air Base hosted a meeting of the International Advisory Group on Ukraine's Defense and Counteraction to Russia, convened by US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin to synchronize and coordinate Ukraine's military assistance in the war with Russia. The event was attended by the heads of defense agencies of 42 countries. The meeting was attended by Minister of Defense of Ukraine Oleksii Reznikov.\nThe participating countries agreed on financial assistance to Ukraine and the supply of \"heavy\" weapons. They also allowed Ukraine to strike at Russian strategic sites with Western weapons. The next meetings are planned to be held monthly.\nA Number 2 Squadron RAAF E-7A Wedgetail is based at Ramstein from October 2023, for a six-month deployment to supplement NATO AEW&amp;C under Operation Kudu. The Wedgetail returned to Australia in April 2024. In July 2025, a RAAF Wedgetail was deployed to Lask Air Base in Poland, returning to Australia in November.\nFacilities.\nAirfield.\nRamstein Air Base consists of two runways\u2009\u2014\u200909/27 and 08/26\u2009\u2014\u2009two large aprons, one near a hangar north of Runways 27 and 26, and one to the north of 09 and 08. The north-western apron also has a small passenger terminal with two jetways. This means the air base is capable of joint-use operations, although currently there are no scheduled airlines running flights to and from Ramstein.\nSchools.\nThere are four schools at Ramstein Air Base: Ramstein Elementary School (grades PreK\u20132), Ramstein Intermediate School (grades 3\u20135), Ramstein American Middle School (grades 6\u20138), and Ramstein High School (grades 9\u201312). All of these schools are run by DoDDS, a component of DoDEA.\nRole and operations.\nThe host unit is the 86th Airlift Wing (86AW), commanded as of 2022[ [update]] by Brigadier General Otis C. Jones. The 86th Airlift Wing is composed of six groups, 30 squadrons and four bases in Germany, Spain, the Azores, and Belgium. Its mission is the operation and maintenance of airlift assets consisting of C-130Js, C-21s, and C-37A Gulfstream aircraft throughout Europe, Africa and the Middle East.\nAlso at Ramstein is the 435th Air Ground Operations Wing (formerly the 435th Air Base Wing) (435AGOW), which focuses on base-support responsibilities within the KMC. It is composed of five groups and 20 squadrons. The wing provides rapid mobility and agile combat support for military operations, and maintains expeditionary forces and infrastructure.\nAs of \u00a02021[ [update]], the commander of the 435th AGOW is Colonel Bryan T. Callahan.\nRamstein's wings are assigned to the headquarters 3rd Air Force also based at RamsteinAB that controls most of the USAF Wings throughout Europe.\nThere is often a Summer Camp to Ramstein from British CCF (RAF) and ATC cadets, as well as Civil Air Patrol encampments and tours like the ones held in July 2015 and June 2016.\nBased units.\nFlying and notable non-flying units based at Ramstein Air Base.\nUnits marked GSU are Geographically Separate Units, which although based at Ramstein, are subordinate to a parent unit based at another location.\nUnited States Air Force.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAccidents and incidents.\nRed Army Faction car bombing, 31 August 1981.\nThe U.S. Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) headquarters became the target of a bombing attack at 07:21 on 31 August 1981, carried out by a Red Army Faction commando called \"Sigurd Debus\". A total of 20 victims were injured, some seriously.\nRamstein air show disaster, 28 August 1988.\nThe Ramstein air show disaster was a mid-air collision that occurred during the Flugtag '88 air show on Sunday, 28 August 1988, killing 3 pilots from the display team, plus an additional 67 spectators on the ground.\nLockheed C-5 Galaxy crash, 29 August 1990.\nOn 29 August 1990, a C-5 Galaxy transport plane had just taken-off from Ramstein AB when a thrust reverser on one of the engines suddenly deployed, causing it to crash immediately after leaving the runway. Eight crew and five of the nine passengers on board were killed.\nEnvironmental scandal.\nIn 2014, it was revealed that toxic extinguishing foams (PFCs) were used on Ramstein Air Base and other U.S. air bases in the region. These are now contaminating lakes, rivers and the ground water in the region. In one river, the contamination was 7700 times higher than the safety limit set by the European Union. These foams are linked to cancer and birth defects.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As of the 2020 census, the borough had a population of 7,106 people.\nGettysburg was the site of the Battle of Gettysburg, which was fought in Gettysburg over three days from July 1 to 3, 1863, during the American Civil War. With over 50,000 combined casualties, the Battle of Gettysburg is both the deadliest battle of the Civil War and in all of American history. The battle, which was won by the Union army, also proved the turning point of the war, leading to the Union's victory two years later and the nation's preservation. Later that year, on November 19, President Abraham Lincoln traveled to present-day Gettysburg National Cemetery, where he participated in a ceremonial consecration of the cemetery and delivered the Gettysburg Address, a carefully crafted 271-word address, which is considered one of the most famous speeches in history.\nGettysburg is home to the Gettysburg National Military Park, which includes Gettysburg Battlefield, where the Battle of Gettysburg was largely fought.\nHistory.\n18th century.\nIn 1760, Irishman Samuel Gettys settled at the Shippensburg-Baltimore and Philadelphia-Pittsburgh crossroads, in what was then western York County, and established a tavern frequented by soldiers and traders. In 1786, his son James purchased 116 acres of his land, divided it up into 220 lots and sold them, and is thus considered the founder of Gettysburg. The borough boundary was established, with the Dobbin House tavern (established in 1776) sitting in the southwest.\nBeginning in 1790, a movement seeking to split off the western portion of York County into a separate county had begun. A commission was drawn up to fix the site of the new county's seat; they ultimately chose a location in Strabane Township (now Straban Township), just northeast of Gettysburg. In 1791, additional trustees were appointed to plan to construct public buildings in Gettysburg instead of in Straban.\n19th century.\nOn January 22, 1800, the Pennsylvania Legislature created Adams County, and named Gettysburg as its county seat.\nIn 1858, the Gettysburg Railroad completed the construction of a railroad line from Gettysburg to Hanover, and the Gettysburg Railroad Station opened a year later. Passenger train service to the town ended in 1942. The station was restored in 2006. In 2011, Senator Robert Casey introduced S. 1897, including the railroad station within the boundary of Gettysburg National Military Park. By 1860, the borough had grown in size to consist of \"450 buildings [which] housed carriage manufacturing, shoemakers, and tanneries\".\nCivil War.\nBetween July 1 and 3, 1863, the Battle of Gettysburg, one of the bloodiest battles during the American Civil War, was fought across the fields and heights surrounding the town.\nThe Confederate Army of Northern Virginia, under the command of Robert E. Lee, experienced success in the early stages of the battle but was ultimately defeated by the Army of the Potomac, commanded by George G. Meade. Lee executed an orderly withdrawal and escaped across the Potomac River without being drawn into another battle. Meade was heavily criticized by President Abraham Lincoln for his cautious pursuit and failure to destroy Lee's retreating army.\nCasualties were high, with total losses on both sides \u2013 over 27,000 Confederate and 23,000 Union. The residents of Gettysburg were left to care for the wounded, and bury the dead following the Confederate retreat. Approximately 8,000 men and 3,000 horses lay under the summer sun. The Union soldiers' bodies were gradually reinterred in what is today known as Gettysburg National Cemetery, where, on November 19, 1863, Abraham Lincoln attended a ceremony to officially consecrate the grounds and delivered his Gettysburg Address.\nA 20-year-old woman, Jennie Wade, was the only civilian killed during the battle. She was hit by a stray bullet that passed through her kitchen door while she was making bread on July 3.\nPhysical damage can still be seen in some of the houses throughout the town, notably the Schmucker House located on Seminary Ridge.\nIndustry and economy.\nThe furniture manufacturing industry employed people in Gettysburg for the first half of the 20th century. The \"Gettysburg Manufacturing Company\", formed in 1902, was the first company established in the borough for the purpose of manufacturing residential furniture. Other companies soon followed. The borough's industry reached peak production and success about the 1920s. This important industry declined from 1951, when the three main companies either moved, closed or were sold. The Gettysburg Furniture Company factory closed in 1960, becoming a warehouse and distribution point for other furniture factories outside of Pennsylvania.\nTourism.\nGettysburg manufacturing associated with tourism included a late 19th century foundry that manufactured gun carriages, bridgeworks and cannons for the Gettysburg Battlefield, as well as a construction industry for hotels, stables, and other buildings for tourist services. Early tourist buildings in the borough included museums (like the 1881 Danner Museum), souvenir shops, buildings of the electric trolley (preceded by a horse trolley from the Gettysburg Railroad Station to the Springs Hotel), and stands for hackmen who drove visitors in jitneys (horse-drawn group taxis) on tours. Modern tourist services in the borough include ghost tours, bed and breakfast lodging, and historical interpretation (reenactors, etc.).\nGettysburg National Military Park extends partially into the Gettysburg borough limits, though it is mostly in nearby Cumberland Township. The Soldiers' National Cemetery, of the Military Park, is in the borough limits. Cumberland Township is also the site of the Eisenhower National Historic Site, which preserves the home and farm of Dwight D. Eisenhower.\nGeography.\nGettysburg is located near the intersection of U.S. routes 15 and 30, approximately west of York and north of Frederick, Maryland. Rock Creek, a tributary of the Monocacy River and part of the Potomac River watershed, flows along its eastern edge. According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , all land.\nClimate.\nGettysburg lies in the humid continental climate zone of northern and central Pennsylvania, just north of the humid subtropical zone of central Maryland, with hot, humid summers and cool winters. On average, January is the coldest month, with an average temperature of . Winters range from cool to moderately cold, with relatively frequent snowfalls. July is the warmest month, with an average temperature of , and June is the wettest month. The hottest temperature recorded in Gettysburg was on July 16, 1988, while the coldest temperature recorded was on January 21, 1994.\nPennsylvania's first on-farm methane digester was built near Gettysburg at the Mason-Dixon Farm in 1978, and generates 600KW.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2020 census.\nAs of the 2010 census, Gettysburg had a population of 7,620, and was 79.6% non-Hispanic white, 10.9% Hispanic or Latino, 5.4% African American, 1.9% Asian, 2.2% all other.\nIndustry.\nThe main industry of the borough is tourism associated with such historic sites as Gettysburg National Military Park (including the Gettysburg National Cemetery) and Eisenhower National Historic Site. Gettysburg has many activities and tours to offer to vacationers and tourists who are interested in the Gettysburg area and the history of the community and the battle. Tourists for the annual reenactment of the Battle of Gettysburg use borough facilities, which include the Dobbin House Tavern and Hotel Gettysburg.\nBattle of Gettysburg reenactment.\nEvery year from July 1\u20133 volunteers reenact the Battle of Gettysburg. Each day re-enactors display a different part of the battle with commentary regarding the hardships of the battles. The battles are narrated by the battlefield guides of the Gettysburg National Military Park.\nTransportation.\nMany roads radiate from Gettysburg, providing hub-like access to Washington, D.C. , Baltimore , Harrisburg , Carlisle , Frederick and Hagerstown, Maryland and Hanover, Pennsylvania . York is east on the Lincoln Highway (U.S. Route 30), the first transcontinental U.S. highway, and Chambersburg is west on it. Today the borough is a &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2+1\u20442 hour drive from Philadelphia and a &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;3+1\u20442 hour drive from Pittsburgh via the Pennsylvania Turnpike and U.S. Route 15.\nGettysburg Regional Airport, a small general aviation airport, is located in Cumberland Township, west of Gettysburg.\nThe main east\u2013west road through downtown Gettysburg is U.S. Route 30, which is known as York Street east of Lincoln Square and Chambersburg Street west of Lincoln Square.\nYork Adams Transportation Authority (YATA) operates public transportation in Adams County. Freedom Transit, implemented in 2009, The hub of the bus system, the new Gettysburg Transit Center, is under construction on Carlisle Street.

Gettysburg Area High School is in nearby Straban Township. James Gettys Elementary School, which has a Gettysburg postal address, is in Cumberland Township. While all parts of the school district are assigned to the same middle and high schools, different areas are zoned to different elementary schools: parts of the borough are zoned to Lincoln Elementary, other parts are zoned to Gettys Elementary, and some parts have a choice between the schools.\nVida Charter School is in Cumberland Township.\nColleges.\nIt is also served by Gettysburg College, Harrisburg Area Community College Gettysburg Campus (in Cumberland Township), and a campus of the United Lutheran Seminary (Lutheran Theological Seminary at Gettysburg, mostly in the borough limits, with portions in Cumberland Township)\nSister cities.\nGettysburg's sister cities are:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "53271", "revid": "8570870", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53271", "title": "Harpers Ferry, West Virginia", "text": "Harpers Ferry is a historic town in Jefferson County, West Virginia, United States. The population was 269 at the 2020 United States census. Situated at the confluence of the Potomac and Shenandoah Rivers in the lower Shenandoah Valley, where Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia meet, it is the easternmost town in West Virginia as well as its lowest point above sea level.\nOriginally named Harper's Ferry after an 18th-century ferry owner, the town lost its apostrophe in 1891 in an update by the United States Board on Geographic Names. It gained fame in 1859 when abolitionist John Brown led a raid on the Harpers Ferry Armory in a doomed effort to start a slave rebellion in Virginia and across the South. During the American Civil War, the town became the northernmost point of Confederate-controlled territory, and changed hands several times due to its strategic importance.\nAn antebellum manufacturing and transportation hub, Harpers Ferry has long since reoriented its economy around tourism after being largely destroyed during the Civil War. Harpers Ferry is home to John Brown's Fort (West Virginia's most visited tourist site), the headquarters of the Appalachian Trail, whose midpoint is nearby, the former campus of Storer College (a historically black college established during Reconstruction), and one of four national training centers of the National Park Service.\nMuch of the lower town, which was in ruins by the end of the Civil War and ravaged by subsequent floods, has been rebuilt and preserved by the National Park Service.\nHistory.\n1700s.\nIn 1733, squatter Peter Stephens settled on land near the confluence of the Potomac and Shenandoah Rivers and established a ferry across the Potomac from Virginia (now West Virginia) to Maryland.\nRobert Harper, from whom the town takes its name, was born in 1718 in Oxford Township, Pennsylvania, now part of Philadelphia. Since he was a builder, Harper was asked by a group of Quakers in 1747 to build a meeting house in the Shenandoah Valley near the present site of Winchester, Virginia. Traveling through Maryland on his way to the Shenandoah Valley, Harper\u2014who was also a millwright\u2014realized the potential of the latent waterpower from the Shenandoah and Potomac Rivers at their confluence. He paid Stephens 30 guineas for his squatting rights to the ferry, since the land actually belonged to Lord Fairfax.\nHarper then purchased of land from Lord Fairfax in 1751. In 1761, the Virginia General Assembly granted him the right to establish and maintain a ferry across the Potomac. In 1763, the Virginia General Assembly established the town of \"Shenandoah Falls at Mr. Harpers Ferry.\" Harper died in October 1782, and is buried in the Harper Cemetery.\nOn October 25, 1783, Thomas Jefferson visited Harpers Ferry as he was traveling to Philadelphia. Viewing \"the passage of the Potomac through the Blue Ridge\" from a rock that is now named for him as Jefferson's Rock, he called the site \"perhaps one of the most stupendous scenes in nature\" and stated, \"This scene is worth a voyage across the Atlantic.\" The town was one of his favorite retreats, and tradition holds that much of his \"Notes on the State of Virginia\" was written there. Jefferson County, in which Harpers Ferry is located, was named for him on its creation in 1801.\nGeorge Washington, as president of the Potomac Company (which was formed to complete river improvements on the Potomac River and its tributaries), traveled to Harpers Ferry during summer 1785 to determine the need for bypass canals. Washington's familiarity with the area led him to propose the site in 1794 for a new armory. His brother, Charles Washington, who founded nearby Charles Town, and his great-great-nephew, Colonel Lewis Washington, both moved to the area.\n1800s.\nThe federal armory.\nIn 1796, the federal government purchased a parcel of land from the heirs of Robert Harper. Construction began on what would become the United States Armory and Arsenal at Harpers Ferry in 1799. It is referred to locally as both \"the armory\" and \"the arsenal,\" but it is the same facility. This was the second of only two such facilities in the United States, the first being in Springfield, Massachusetts. Together they produced most of the small arms for the U.S. Army. The town was transformed into a water-powered industrial center. Between 1801 and 1861, when the armory was destroyed to prevent capture during the American Civil War, it produced more than 600,000\u00a0muskets, rifles, and pistols. Inventor Captain John H. Hall pioneered the use of interchangeable parts in firearms manufactured at his rifle works at the armory between 1820 and 1840. His M1819 Hall rifle was the first breech-loading weapon adopted by the U.S. Army.\nCanals.\nHarpers Ferry's first man-made transportation facility was the Potomac Canal. The canal ceased transportation in 1828, but a portion of it in front of the town channeled river water to run machinery for the armory.\nThe Potomac Canal ran on the Virginia side of the river. On the Maryland side, the later Chesapeake and Ohio Canal and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad competed for right-of-way on a very narrow patch of land downstream from Harpers Ferry.\nArrival of railroads.\nIn 1833, the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Canal reached Harpers Ferry from Washington, D.C.; a planned western expansion to Ohio was never completed. A year later, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad began service from Harpers Ferry via Wager Bridge, named for a family that later built the town's Wager Hotel. The bridge connected the town across the Potomac with Sandy Hook, Maryland, which for a few years in the 1830s was the railroad's western terminus. In 1837, the railroad crossed the Potomac into Harpers Ferry with the opening of the B &amp; O Railroad Potomac River Crossing.\nThe first railroad junction in the country began service in 1836 when the Winchester and Potomac Railroad opened its line from Harpers Ferry southwest to Charles Town and then to Winchester, Virginia.\nVirginius Island.\nVirginius Island, which connected the Shenandoah River to the lower part of Harpers Ferry, was created by happenstance in the early 1800s after debris floated down from upstream mills during the construction of the Shenandoah Canal. Cotton, flour mills, and other water-powered companies were developed on Virginius Island, taking advantage of the Shenandoah River's water power and good routes to markets. The island came to house all of Harpers Ferry's manufacturing, except for the armory, which used the Potomac River for power, and its rifle plant, some distance upstream using the Shenandoah's power.\nAt its antebellum peak, some 180 people lived on Virginius Island, including workers who lived in a boarding house and in row houses. Floods in the 20th century destroyed all structures on the island. Today, visitors can view Virginius Island's historic ruins and walk National Park Service trails.\nJohn Brown's raid.\nOn October 16, 1859, the abolitionist John Brown led a group of 22 men (counting himself) in a raid on the armory. Five of the men were black: three free black men, one freed slave, and one fugitive slave. Brown attacked and captured several buildings, hoping to secure the weapons depot and arm the slaves, starting a revolt across the South. Brown also brought 1,000 steel pikes, which were forged in Connecticut by a blacksmith and abolitionist sympathizer, Charles Blair; however, the pikes, a weapon that does not require training, were never used as Brown failed to rally the slaves to revolt. The first shot of the raid mortally wounded Heyward Shepherd, a free black man who was a baggage porter for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.\nThe noise from that shot alerted Dr. John Starry shortly after 1 am. He walked from his nearby home to investigate the shooting and was confronted by Brown's men. Starry stated that he was a doctor but could do nothing more for Shepherd, and the men allowed him to leave. Starry then went to the livery and rode to neighboring towns and villages, alerting residents to the raid. John Brown's men were quickly pinned down by local citizens and militia, and forced to take refuge in the fire engine house (later called John Brown's Fort), at the entrance to the armory.\nThe Secretary of War asked the Navy Department for a unit of United States Marines from the Washington Navy Yard, the nearest troops. Lieutenant Israel Greene was ordered to take a force of 86 Marines to the town. U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Robert E. Lee was found on leave at his home not far away in Arlington, Virginia, and was assigned as commander, along with Lt. J. E. B. Stuart as his aide-de-camp. Lee led the unit in civilian clothes, as none of his uniforms were available. The contingent arrived by train on October 18, and after negotiations failed, they stormed the fire house and captured most of the raiders, killing a few and suffering a single casualty (a Marine, twenty-four-year-old Private Luke Quinn). Lee submitted a report on October 19.\nBrown was quickly tried in Charles Town, the county seat of Jefferson County, for treason against the Commonwealth of Virginia, murder, and fomenting a slave insurrection. Convicted of all charges, with Starry's testimony integral to the conviction, he was hanged on December 2. (See \"Virginia v. John Brown\".) John Brown's words, both from his interview by Virginia Governor Henry A. Wise and his famous last speech, \"captured the attention of the nation like no other abolitionist or slave owner before or since.\"\nAmerican Civil War.\nThe American Civil War was disastrous for Harpers Ferry, where five battles took place; it changed hands eight times between 1861 and 1865. (Another article says it changed hands twelve times.) One of the first military actions by secessionists in Virginia was taken on April 18, 1861, when they wrested control of the Federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry from the Union Army, even before the convention which would consider whether or not the state should secede had been called together.\nBecause of the town's strategic location on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and at the northern end of the Shenandoah Valley, both Union and Confederate troops moved through Harpers Ferry frequently. It was said that \"Jefferson County is where the North and South met.\" It was a natural conduit for Confederate invasions of the North, as in General Robert E. Lee's Maryland campaign of 1862 and Gettysburg campaign of 1863, and for Union troops heading south in their attempts to thwart Rebel forces in the Valley.\nThe town was \"easy to seize, and hard to hold\", because of its topography: surrounded on three sides by high ground (Bolivar Heights to the west, Loudoun Heights to the south, and Maryland Heights to the east) and the Potomac and Shenandoah Rivers, anyone who controlled the heights controlled the city.\nThe war's effect on the town was devastating. It was described in March 1862:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Harper's Ferry presents quite a gloomy picture. The best buildings have been shelled to the ground, and nothing now remains but their foundations to mark the spot where they once stood. The old Arsenal has been burnt to the ground; that part of the building where old John Brown made such a fatal stand, still stands as a monument to his memory. Before the destruction of the town, it contained near 3000 inhabitants, but at the present time there are not more than 300 or 400 families there.\nIn the account of Joseph George Rosengarten, Harpers Ferry and nearby Bolivar, in 1859 \"a blooming garden-spot, full of thrift and industry and comfort,\" had been reduced to \"waste and desolation\" by 1862.\nThe town's garrison of federal troops attracted 1,500 contrabands by the summer of 1862. They were returned to slavery, however, when Confederate General Stonewall Jackson took Harpers Ferry in September 1862. Lee needed to control Harpers Ferry because it was on his supply line and could cut off his possible routes of retreat if captured. Therefore, Lee divided his army of approximately 40,000 into four sections, sending three columns under Jackson to surround and capture the town.\n The Battle of Harpers Ferry started with light fighting September 13 as the Confederates tried to capture the Maryland Heights to the northeast, while John Walker moved back over the Potomac to capture Loudoun Heights south of town. After a Confederate artillery bombardment on September 14 and 15, the federal garrison surrendered. With Jackson's capture of 12,419 federal troops, the surrender at Harpers Ferry was the largest surrender of U.S. military personnel until the Battle of Bataan in 1942.\nBecause of the delay in capturing the town and the movement of federal forces to the west, Lee was forced to regroup at the town of Sharpsburg, Maryland. Two days later he commanded troops in the Battle of Antietam, which had the highest number of deaths among troops of any single day in United States military history.\nBy July 1864, the Union again had control of Harpers Ferry. On July 4, 1864, Union general Franz Sigel withdrew his troops to Maryland Heights, from which he resisted Jubal Early's attempt to enter the town and drive out the federal garrison.\nPost-Civil War.\nInspired by John Brown's raid, both runaway and freed slaves came to Harpers Ferry during and after the American Civil War. This created social tensions between white and black residents of the community and generated a growing need for services for the increasing African-American population. Accordingly, a freedman's school was opened on Camp Hill by Freewill Baptist missionaries following the American Civil War.\nThe town and the armory, with the exception of John Brown's Fort, were destroyed during the war. \"The larger portion of the houses all lie in ruins and the whole place is not actually worth $10,\" wrote a Massachusetts soldier to his mother in 1863. A visitor in 1878 found the town \"antiquated, dingy, and rather squalid\"; another, in 1879, described it as \"shabby and ruined.\" Since the Arsenal, Harpers Ferry's largest employer before the war, was never rebuilt, the town's population never recovered to antebellum levels.\nStorer College.\nStorer College, devoted to training teachers for freedmen, opened in 1868, much to the displeasure of many residents of Harpers Ferry who petitioned the Legislature to revoke its charter. The War Department gave the Freedmen's Bureau its remaining assets in Harpers Ferry, principally four sturdy residences for the managers of the Armory, structurally sound but in need of repairs from damage during the war, and the Bureau gave them to Storer College. A one-room school for Blacks was already operating in one of them.\nAfrican-American tourism.\nAs early as 1878, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad ran excursion trains to Harpers Ferry from Baltimore and Washington. As described in a newspaper in 1873: \"One need only to alight from the train and look a little envious toward the old Engine House or the ruined walls of the old Arsenal in order to have a score of persons offering to become a kind of guide or to point out to your whatever you may desire to know about the great struggle which ended in the 'opening of the prison doors, the breaking of every yoke, the undoing of heavy burdens, and letting the oppressed go free.\"\nStorer, the only Black college at a location historically important to African-Americans, became a center of the civil rights movement and built the town's importance as a destination for Black tourists and excursionists. Douglass spoke there in 1881, as part of an unsuccessful campaign to fund a \"John Brown professorship\" to be held by an African-American. In 1906, Storer hosted the first U.S. meeting of the Niagara Movement, the predecessor of the NAACP, after its organizational meeting in Fort Erie, Ontario.\nIn the late 1890s, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad wanted the land where the fort was located to make its line less vulnerable to flooding. Some white townspeople were eager to get rid of the fort. It was dismantled and moved to Chicago for display at the 1893 Columbian Exposition. Abandoned there, it was rescued and moved back to Harpers Ferry by the Baltimore and Ohio without charge, motivated by their expectation that having the fort back in Harpers Ferry would be a tourist attraction and a way to build ridership on the railroad. But most whites were opposed to any commemoration of John Brown, and it was placed on a nearby farm.\nVisits by tourists, many of them Black, now began to slowly turn the town into a real tourist center and return it to growth. \"Harpers Ferry proved to be one of the most visited places of leisure for nineteenth-century African Americans.\" There was a Black-owned hotel, the Hill Top House, built and run by a Storer graduate, Thomas Lovett, but it catered only to white clientele. In the summer Storer rented rooms to Black vacationers until 1896. The fort was the great monument where the end of slavery began. There were so many tourists that they were a nuisance to the farmer on whose lands the fort sat, and so it was moved to Storer in 1909. There it would remain until several years after the college closed in 1955, functioning as the College Museum. Male students practiced their public-speaking skills by giving tours of it.\nIsland Park Resort and Amusement Park.\nTo increase ridership, the B&amp;O in 1879 built Island Park Resort and Amusement Park on Byrne Island in the Potomac, which the railroad bought and built a footbridge to reach it. One had to pay 5\u00a2 ($5 in 2021 value) to cross and enter, after which rides and other activities were free. Access to the park was also a benefit for B&amp;O employees, as it had done in Relay, Maryland. Among the many events held there were a reunion of 4,000 Odd Fellows in 1880 and a \"Grand Tri-State Democratic Mass Meeting\" 1892.\nThomas Wentworth Higginson, one of the Secret Six who assisted John Brown, chose Harpers Ferry for his honeymoon.\nThe park was large enough that parades could be held. There were a steam-powered ferris wheel and carousel, a midway, a pavilion for dancing or roller skating, swings, a merry-go-round, and a bandstand. Visitors could also play croquet, tennis, rent boats, fish, or wade in the river. Later there were baseball games. Blacks and whites attended on different days. In 1883, there were an estimated 100,000 visitors. There were six special trains to Harpers Ferry from various points.\nThe amusement park was kept open despite periodic flooding and repairs until 1909. The B&amp;O kept the site open after that for picnicking.\nThe bandstand, the only surviving structure, has been moved twice. At the park's closing, it was moved to Arsenal Square (the current location of John Brown's Fort), then later to the park at Washington and Gilmore Streets. It is referred to as The Bandstand or the Town Gazebo, and many civic, cultural, and recreational activities take place there.\nThe bridge was destroyed by flooding in 1896, as was a replacement bridge in 1924. The remaining structures on the island were destroyed in a 1942 flood.\n20th century.\n2nd Niagara Movement Conference.\nOn August 15, 1906, Black author and scholar W. E. B. Du Bois led the first meeting on American soil of the new Niagara Movement. Named after the site of its initial meeting in Fort Erie, Ontario, Canada on the Niagara River, the movement met on the campus of Storer College, a primarily Black college that operated until 1955. (After it closed, the campus became part of Harpers Ferry National Historical Park.) The three-day gathering, which was held to work for civil rights for African Americans, was later described by DuBois as \"one of the greatest meetings that American Negroes ever held\". Attendees walked from Storer College to the farm of the Murphy family, the location at the time of John Brown's historic \"fort,\" the armory's firehouse. As a result, the fort was soon moved to the Storer campus, where it became the college's central icon. After the college closed in 1955, the National Park Service moved it back to as close as possible to its original location.\nHarpers Ferry National Monument and National Historical Park.\nA 1936 flood left the lower town \"shabby and almost uninhabited\", with no bridge across the Shenandoah to Virginia and no highway bridge to Maryland. All remaining structures on Virginius Island were destroyed.\nThe backbone of the effort to preserve and commemorate Harpers Ferry was Henry T. MacDonald, President of Storer, an amateur historian appointed by West Virginia Governor Okey Patteson as head of the Harpers Ferry National Monument Commission. He was assisted by the Representative from West Virginia's Second District, Jennings Randolph, who in 1935 introduced a bill to establish Harpers Ferry National Military Park in \"the area where the most important events of [John Brown's raid] took place. Although this bill did not pass, the flood of 1936 made the project more feasible by destroying buildings not historically important and thus freeing land. After several other attempts, a bill creating Harpers Ferry National Monument was passed and signed by President Roosevelt in 1944, subject to the proviso that nothing would be done with it until the war ended.\nAn urgent priority was the new highway, which is today U.S. Route 340. A new bridge connecting Sandy Hook, Maryland with Loudoun County, Virginia opened in October 1947, on which work had begun in 1941 but was interrupted by the war. Another new bridge over the Shenandoah connecting Virginia to Bolivar Heights, West Virginia, opened two years later. Federal highway traffic now bypassed Harpers Ferry entirely.\nLand acquisition started in lower Harpers Ferry; the project was supported both by Harpers Ferry mayor Gilbert Perry and Governor Patteson. Twenty-two eviction notices were served in the lower town, and two taverns closed.Property acquisition, not all of which was unproblematic, was completed in 1952 and presented to the United States in January 1953. The National Monument's first on-site employee, John T. Willett, began work in 1954.\nIn 1957, \"The Baltimore Sun\" reported that the lower town was \"a sagging and rotted ghost town.\" The idea of making Harpers Ferry into a National Monument was to prevent the further deterioration and to rebuild the tourist industry. The first task of the Park Service was to stabilize the buildings on Shenandoah Street, the main commercial street of lower Harpers Ferry. Roofs were covered, missing windows replaced, walls on the verge of collapse reinforced, and debris removed. Post-1859 buildings were not restored, and most were removed. The NPS built a Visitor Center and a John Brown Museum. Harpers Ferry National Monument became Harpers Ferry National Historical Park on May 29, 1963.\n\"Recreationists\" who wanted a park and did not care about the history were a problem. Local residents did not want to lose recreational opportunities, but swimming and fishing on the Shenandoah shore, formerly common, were prohibited. In order to keep recreationists out of the historic area, and especially Virginius Island, John Brown's Fort was moved to Arsenal Square from a now-inconvenient location on the former Storer College campus, parking in the lower town was prohibited, and a shuttle bus service begun. Tensions between the NPS and town residents were ongoing. However, the NPS helped the town achieve Main Street Status from the National Trust for Historic Preservation in 2001.\nThe population of Harpers Ferry continued to decline in the 20th century. The majority of the surviving homes in Harpers Ferry are historic, some of which are registered on the National Register of Historic Places.\n21st century.\nOn July 23, 2015, a fire broke out in downtown Harpers Ferry, destroying eight or nine businesses and two apartments in two historic buildings. The buildings are being rebuilt.\nIn the early morning of December 21, 2019, multiple cars of a train owned by CSX derailed from the railroad bridge crossing the Potomac River. The derailment damaged a portion of the Goodloe E. Byron Memorial Pedestrian Walkway, which is attached to the railroad bridge and connects the Appalachian Trail between West Virginia and Maryland. Although the accident did not result in any injuries or fatalities, it effectively inhibited all pedestrian access across the Potomac. The bridge reopened in early July 2020.\nHill Top House project.\nThe Hill Top House Hotel, which had opened in 1888 to accommodate African Americans as the sole hotel in Harpers Ferry that would accept them as guests, burned in 1911. It was then rebuilt on a larger scale, but that building also burned in 1919. It was rebuilt a second time on a slightly smaller scale but closed in 2008. As of 2021, developers plan to demolish it and build a new 120-room hotel on the site. Controversies about the impact such a proposed venue would have on the town have delayed its development.\nArchaeology.\nUnder the auspices of the National Park Service, the archaeology of the town of Harpers Ferry as well as that of Virginius Island have been studied in depth. The journal \"Historical Archaeology\" published its entire volume 28, no. 4, issue of 1994 on Harpers Ferry.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Some properties are currently threatened by development. From most of Harpers Ferry, a fading advertisement for Mennen's Borated Talcum Toilet Powder painted on the cliff face of Maryland Heights decades ago is still visible.\nThe geographical and physical features of Harpers Ferry were the principal reasons for its settlement and eventual industrial development. It is a natural transportation hub and a major river, the Shenandoah, joins the Potomac River at Harpers Ferry. It guarded the entrance to Virginia's large Shenandoah Valley, and the Potomac provided easy access to Washington. The valleys of the rivers made it possible to build the never-completed Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, then the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and shortly after that the Winchester and Potomac Railroad. The first railroad junction in the United States was at Harpers Ferry, and telegraph lines passed through the town. The armory, and later other industries, were located in Harpers Ferry because of the abundant water power available from the rivers.\nThe ferry ended in 1824, when a covered wooden road bridge by the name of Wager's Bridge was built. Harpers Ferry was the site of the first and for many years the only railroad bridge across the Potomac River, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's bridge, built in 1836\u201337. None of Washington, D.C.'s bridges connecting it with Virginia carried more than horse traffic until after the American Civil War. In 1851, a second bridge was built, across the Shenandoah, one of the earliest Bollman trusses. A newer Bollman truss bridge, which carried both rail and highway traffic, opened in 1870 but was washed away in a flood in 1936.\nThe town's original lower section is on a flood plain created by the two rivers. It is surrounded by higher ground, and since the 20th century has been part of Harpers Ferry National Historical Park. Most of the remainder, which includes the more elevated populated area, is included in the separate Harpers Ferry Historic District. Two other National Register of Historic Places properties adjoin the town: the B &amp; O Railroad Potomac River Crossing and St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church.\nThe Appalachian Trail Conservancy (ATC) headquarters is in Harpers Ferry. The Appalachian Trail passes directly through town, which some consider the psychological midpoint of the trail despite the exact physical midpoint is being farther north in Pennsylvania. Uniquely, the towns of Harpers Ferry and adjoining Bolivar have partnered with the ATC to be declared a united Appalachian Trail Community.\nClimate.\nThe climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters, similar to nearby Martinsburg. According to the K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification system, Harpers Ferry has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated \"Cfa\" on climate maps using the 27\u00a0\u00b0F/-3\u00a0\u00b0C isotherm, as its coldest month averages 31\u00a0\u00b0F/-0.5\u00a0\u00b0C or, if the 32\u00a0\u00b0F/0\u00a0\u00b0C isotherm is used, a humid continental climate, abbreviated \"Dfa\".\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2010 census.\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 286 people, 131 households, and 78 families residing in the town. The population density was . There were 175 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the town was 94% White, 4% African American, 1% Native American, 0% from other races, and 1% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1% of the population.\nOf the 131 households, 21% had children under the age of 18 living with them; 44% were married couples living together; 13% had a female householder with no husband present; 3% had a male householder with no wife present; and 41% were non-families. Individuals were 29%, with 15% living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.18 and the average family size, 2.69.\nThe median age in the town was 52. Of all residents, 17% were under the age of 18; 3% between the ages of 18 and 24; 19% from 25 to 44; 38% from 45 to 64; and 23% 65 years of age or older. The gender makeup of the town was 49.3% male and 50.7% female.\nGovernment.\nThe Harpers Ferry Police Department, or HFPD, is the official municipal police force for Harpers Ferry. The agency has three sworn full-time officers, two sworn part-time officers, and one civilian employee. The current Chief of Police is John D. Brown.\nThe Harpers Ferry Police Department has mutual policing agreements with both the Harpers Ferry National Historical Park Rangers and the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office.\nPolitics.\nHarpers Ferry is part of West Virginia's 2nd congressional district, represented by Republican Riley Moore since 2025. Republican Bill Ridenour represents it in the West Virginia House of Delegates as part of the 100th district, and Republican Jason Barrett represents it in the West Virginia Senate as part of the 16th district.\nTransportation.\nRoads and highways.\nThe only significant highway providing access to Harpers Ferry is U.S. Route 340. Although signed north\u2013south, the road runs generally eastward from Harpers Ferry to Frederick, Maryland, and south to Greenville, Virginia. Harpers Ferry and Bolivar host an unsigned alternate route of U.S. Route 340, which follows Washington Street, High Street, and Shenandoah Street.\nRail.\nAmtrak provides service to Harpers Ferry two times a day on the \"Capitol Limited\" line from Chicago to Washington, D.C., once in each direction. It is also served by MARC commuter rail on the Brunswick Line from Martinsburg, West Virginia, to Washington. The city's passenger rail station is at the West Virginia end of the historic B&amp;O railroad bridge across the Potomac River. The town has an extensive rail history, having previously been serviced by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad as well as multiple freight lines.\nReferences.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading"}

{"id": "53273", "revid": "28274973", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53273", "title": "Duke University", "text": "Private university in Durham, North Carolina, U.S.\nDuke University is a private research university in Durham, North Carolina, United States. Founded by Methodists and Quakers in the present-day city of Trinity in 1838, the school moved to Durham in 1892. In 1924, tobacco and electric power industrialist James Buchanan Duke established the Duke Endowment and the institution changed its name to honor his deceased father, Washington Duke.\nThe campus spans over on three contiguous sub-campuses in Durham, and a marine lab in Beaufort. The West Campus\u2014designed largely by architect Julian Abele\u2014incorporates Gothic architecture with the Duke Chapel at the campus' center and highest point of elevation, is adjacent to the Medical Center. East Campus, away, home to all first-years, contains Georgian-style architecture. The university also administers two concurrent schools in Asia, Duke\u2013NUS Medical School in Singapore (established in 2005) and Duke Kunshan University in Kunshan, China (established in 2013).\nDuke forms one of the corners of the Research Triangle region together with North Carolina State University in Raleigh and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. In 2019, Duke spent more than $1.2 billion on research. Its endowment is $11.9 billion, making it the twelfth-wealthiest private academic institution in the United States. Duke's athletic teams are known as the Blue Devils and compete in 27 NCAA Division I intercollegiate sports. Duke is a charter member of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), and has won 17 NCAA team championships and 24 individual national championships.\nHistory.\nBeginnings.\nDuke first opened in 1838 as Brown's Schoolhouse, a private subscription school founded in Randolph County, North Carolina, in the present-day town of Trinity. Organized by the Union Institute Society, a group of Methodists and Quakers, Brown's Schoolhouse became the Union Institute Academy in 1841 when North Carolina issued a charter. The academy was renamed Normal College in 1851, and then Trinity College in 1859 because of support from the Methodist Church. In 1892, Trinity College moved to Durham, largely due to the generosity of Julian S. Carr and Washington Duke, powerful and respected Methodists who had grown wealthy through the tobacco and electrical industries. Carr donated land in 1892 for the original Durham campus, which is now known as East Campus. At the same time, Washington Duke gave the school $85,000 ($ adjusted for inflation) for an initial endowment and construction costs\u2014later augmenting his generosity with three separate $100,000 contributions in 1896, 1899, and 1900\u2014with the stipulation that the college \"open its doors to women, placing them on an equal footing with men.\" Duke would accelerate its mission to become a global university in 1910 with the promotion of William Preston Few as the new president of Trinity College, who sought to establish the university as a southern counterpart to Yale and Harvard.\nIn 1924, Washington Duke's son, James B. Duke, established The Duke Endowment with a $40 million trust fund. Income from the fund was to be distributed to hospitals, orphanages, the Methodist Church, and four colleges (including Trinity College). Few, who remained president of Trinity, insisted that the institution be renamed Duke University to honor the family's generosity and to distinguish it from the myriad other colleges and universities carrying the \"Trinity\" name. At first, James B. Duke thought the name change would come off as self-serving, but eventually, he accepted Few's proposal as a memorial to his father. Money from the endowment allowed the university to grow quickly. Duke's original campus, East Campus, was rebuilt from 1925 to 1927 with Georgian-style buildings. By 1930, the majority of the Collegiate Gothic-style buildings on the campus one mile (1.6\u00a0km) west were completed, and construction on West Campus culminated with the completion of Duke Chapel in 1935. \nIn 1878, Trinity (in Randolph County) awarded A.B. degrees to three sisters\u2014Mary, Persis, and Theresa Giles\u2014who had studied both with private tutors and in classes with men. With the relocation of the college in 1892, the board of trustees voted to again allow women to be formally admitted to classes as day students. At the time of Washington Duke's donation in 1896, which carried the requirement that women be placed \"on an equal footing with men\" at the college, four women were enrolled; three of the four were faculty members' children. In 1903 Washington Duke wrote to the board of trustees withdrawing the provision, noting that it had been the only limitation he had ever put on a donation to the college. A woman's residential dormitory was built in 1897 and named the Mary Duke Building, after Washington Duke's daughter. By 1904, 54 women were enrolled in the college. In 1930, the Woman's College was established as a coordinate to the men's undergraduate college, which had been established and named Trinity College in 1924.\nAccording to Duke University Human Rights Center, the school's \"policy in the 1920s excluded blacks from admissions and also restricted blacks from using certain campus facilities such as the dining halls and dorm housing\u00a0... In 1948, a group of divinity school students petitioned the divinity school to desegregate \u2013 the first concerted effort to push for the desegregation of Duke's admission policy.\"\nExpansion and growth.\nEngineering, which had been taught at Duke since 1903, became a separate school in 1939. The university president's official residence, the J. Deryl Hart House, was completed in 1934. In athletics, Duke hosted and competed in the first Rose Bowl ever played outside California in Wallace Wade Stadium in 1942; the second such game was played in Arlington, Texas, in 2021, moved as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. During World War II, Duke was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a navy commission. In 1963 the Board of Trustees officially desegregated the undergraduate college.\nDuke enrolled its first black graduate students in 1961. The school did not admit black undergraduates until September 1963. The teaching staff remained all-white until 1966.\nIncreased activism on campus during the 1960s prompted Martin Luther King Jr. to speak at the university in November 1964 on the progress of the Civil Rights Movement. Following Douglas Knight's resignation from the office of university president, Terry Sanford, the former governor of North Carolina, was elected president of the university in 1969, propelling The Fuqua School of Business' opening, the William R. Perkins library completion, and the founding of the Institute of Policy Sciences and Public Affairs (now the Sanford School of Public Policy). The separate Woman's College merged back with Trinity as the liberal arts college for both men and women in 1972.\nBeginning in the 1970s, Duke administrators began a long-term effort to strengthen Duke's reputation both nationally and internationally. Interdisciplinary work was emphasized, as was recruiting minority faculty and students. During this time it also became the birthplace of the first Physician Assistant degree program in the United States. Duke University Hospital was finished in 1980 and the student union building was fully constructed two years later. In 1986 the men's soccer team captured Duke's first National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) championship, and the men's basketball team followed shortly thereafter with championships in 1991 and 1992, then again in 2001, 2010, and 2015.\nDuke Forward, a seven-year fundraising campaign, raised $3.85 billion by August 2017.\nRecent history.\nIn 2014, Duke removed the name of Charles B. Aycock, a white supremacist governor of North Carolina, from an undergraduate dormitory. It is now known as the East Residence Hall.\nOn August 19, 2017, following the violent clashes at the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, the statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee was removed from the entrance to Duke University Chapel, after having been vandalized by protesters.\nIn August 2020, the first undergraduates from Duke Kunshan University arrived for their study abroad on Duke's campus. Due to COVID-19, Chinese Duke undergraduate and graduate students unable to travel to the United States were reciprocally hosted at Duke Kunshan campus.\nControversies.\nIn 2006, the Duke lacrosse rape hoax involved three men's lacrosse team members falsely accused of rape by Crystal Mangum, which garnered significant media attention. On April 11, 2007, North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper dropped all charges and declared the three players innocent. Cooper stated that the charged players were victims of a \"tragic rush to accuse.\" The District Attorney, Mike Nifong, was subsequently disbarred.\nIn December 2024, Mangum admitted, during a December 11, 2024 podcast interview, that she \"made up a story that wasn't true\" about the white lacrosse players who attended a party where she was hired to be a stripper.\nIn 2019, Duke paid $112.5 million to settle False Claims Act allegations related to scientific research misconduct. A researcher at the school was falsifying or fabricating research data in order to win grants for financial gain. The researcher was arrested in 2013 on charges of embezzling funds from the university. The scheme was exposed by the allegations made through a lawsuit, filed by a whistleblower, who had worked as a Duke employee, and discovered the false data.\nIn response to the misconduct settlement, Duke established an advisory panel of academics from Caltech, Stanford and Rockefeller University. Based on the recommendations of this panel, Duke Office of Scientific Integrity (DOSI) was established under the leadership of Lawrence Carin, an engineering professor with experience in machine learning and artificial intelligence. The establishment of this office brings Duke's research practices in line with those at peer institutions like Johns Hopkins University.\nCampus.\nDuke University currently owns 256 buildings on of land, which includes the Duke Forest. The campus is divided into four main areas: West, East, and Central campuses and the Medical Center, which are all connected via a free bus service. On the Atlantic coast in Beaufort, Duke owns as part of its marine lab. One of the major public attractions on the main campus is the Sarah P. Duke Gardens, established in the 1930s.\nDuke students often refer to the West Campus as \"the Gothic Wonderland\", a nickname referring to the Collegiate Gothic architecture of West Campus, a style chosen by the Campus's founders after campus visits to the University of Chicago, Yale, and Princeton. Much of the campus was designed by Julian Abele, one of the first prominent African-American architects and the chief designer in the offices of architect Horace Trumbauer. The residential quadrangles are of an early and somewhat unadorned design, while the buildings in the academic quadrangles show influences of the more elaborate late French and Italian styles. The freshmen campus, known as East Campus, is composed of buildings in the Georgian architecture style. In 2011, Travel+Leisure listed Duke among the most beautiful college campuses in the United States.\nDuke Chapel stands at the center of West Campus on the highest ridge. Constructed from 1930 to 1935 from Duke stone, the chapel seats 1,600 people and, at is one of the tallest buildings in Durham County.\nWest, East, and Central Campuses.\nWest Campus, considered the main campus of the university, houses the sophomores and juniors, along with most seniors. Most of the academic and administrative centers are located there. Main West Campus, with Duke Chapel at its center, contains the majority of residential quads to the south, while the main academic quad, library, and Medical Center are to the north. The campus, spanning , includes Science Drive, which is the location of science and engineering buildings. The residential quads on West Campus are Craven Quad, Crowell Quad, Edens Quad, Few Quad, Keohane Quad, Kilgo Quad, and Wannamaker Quad. Most of the campus eateries and sports facilities \u2013 including the historic basketball stadium, Cameron Indoor Stadium \u2013 are on West Campus.\nEast Campus, the original location of Duke after it moved to Durham, functions as a first-year campus, housing the university's freshmen dormitories as well as several academic departments. Since the 1995\u201396 academic year, all freshmen\u2014and only freshmen, except for upperclassmen serving as Resident Assistants\u2014have lived on East Campus, an effort to build class unity. The campus encompasses and is from West Campus. Art History, History, Cultural Anthropology, Literature, Music, Philosophy, and Women's Studies are housed on East. Programs such as dance, drama, education, film, and the University Writing Program reside on East. The self-sufficient East Campus contains the freshmen residence halls, a dining hall, coffee shop, post office, Lilly Library, Baldwin Auditorium, a theater, Brodie Gym, tennis courts, several disc golf baskets, and a walking track as well as several academic buildings. The East Campus dorms are Alspaugh, Basset, Bell Tower, Blackwell, Brown, East House (formerly known as Aycock), Epworth, Gilbert-Addoms, Giles, West House (formerly known as Jarvis), Pegram, Randolph, Southgate, Trinity, and Wilson. Separated from downtown by a short walk, the area was the site of the Women's College from 1930 to 1972.\nCentral Campus, consisting of between East and West campuses, housed around 1,000 sophomores, juniors, and seniors, as well as around 200 professional students in double or quadruple apartments. However, the housing of undergraduates on Central Campus ended after the 2018\u20132019 school year and the respective buildings were demolished. Central Campus is home to the Nasher Museum of Art, the Freeman Center for Jewish Life, the Center for Muslim Life, the Campus Police Department, Office of Disability Management, a Ronald McDonald House, and administrative departments such as Duke Residence Life and Housing Services. Central Campus has several recreation and social facilities such as basketball courts, a sand volleyball court, barbecue grills and picnic shelters, a general gathering building called \"Devil's Den\", a restaurant known as \"Devil's Bistro\", a convenience store called Uncle Harry's, and the Mill Village. The Mill Village consists of a gym and group study rooms.\nIn December 2016, Duke University purchased an apartment complex, now known as 300 Swift. Swift houses upperclassmen, in addition to the West Campus area, and is located between East and West Campus.\nDuke University Hospital and Health System.\nDuke University Hospital is a 957-acute care bed academic tertiary care facility located in Durham, North Carolina. Established in 1930, it is the flagship teaching hospital for Duke University Health System, a network of physicians and hospitals serving Durham County and Wake County, North Carolina, and surrounding areas, as well as one of three Level I referral centers for the Research Triangle of North Carolina (the other two are UNC Hospitals in nearby Chapel Hill and WakeMed Raleigh in Raleigh). Duke University Health System combines Duke University School of Medicine, Duke University School of Nursing, Duke Clinic, and the member hospitals into a system of research, clinical care, and education.\nIn early 2012, Duke Cancer Center opened next to Duke Hospital in Durham. The patient care facility consolidates nearly all of Duke's outpatient clinical care services.\nOther key places.\nDuke Forest, established in 1931, consists of in six divisions, just west of West Campus. The largest private research forest in North Carolina and one of the largest in the nation, Duke Forest demonstrates a variety of forest stand types and silvicultural treatments. Duke Forest is used extensively for research and includes the Aquatic Research Facility, Forest Carbon Transfer and Storage (FACTS-I) research facility, two permanent towers suitable for micrometeorological studies, and other areas designated for animal behavior and ecosystem study. More than of trails are open to the public for hiking, cycling, and horseback riding. Duke Lemur Center, located inside Duke Forest, is the world's largest sanctuary for rare and endangered strepsirrhine primates. Founded in 1966, Duke Lemur Center spans and contains nearly 300 animals of 25 different species of lemurs, galagos and lorises.\nThe Sarah P. Duke Gardens, established in the early 1930s, is situated between West Campus and Central Campus. The gardens occupy , divided into four major sections: the original Terraces and their surroundings; the H.L. Blomquist Garden of Native Plants, devoted to flora of the Southeastern United States; the W.L. Culberson Asiatic Arboretum, housing plants of Eastern Asia, as well as disjunct species found in Eastern Asia and Eastern North America; and the Doris Duke Center Gardens. There are of all\u00e9es and paths throughout the gardens.\nDuke University Allen Building was the site of student protest in the late 1960s. In 1969, six years after the university began to allow African-American students to enroll, dozens of Black students overtook the Allen Building and barricaded themselves inside of it. Their justification included a \"white top and a black bottom\" power structure, according to the former director of employee relations; the university's gradualist and arguably complacent approach to civil rights; high attrition rates for Black students; lack of unionization rights for nonacademic employees; lack of institutional power and self-determination for a Black studies department; \"police harassment for Black students\"; \"racist living conditions\"; and \"tokenism of Black representation in university power structures\" among others. Their underlying demand was \"to be taken seriously as human beings and to be treated as any respected human being would be treated.\" Provost Marcus E. Hobbes complained that the African-American students \"wanted to run the University.\" At around 8 a.m., these students entered the Allen Building, asked everyone inside to leave and promptly barricaded themselves inside. The university called the police and, almost before law enforcement entered the building (it was widely understood by students and administration that the police would have likely brutally beat and possibly killed the unarmed Black students), the students exited with their trenchcoats over their faces. Meanwhile, white students and faculty had formed a human shield around the building and a brawl between the police and students ensued, sending a handful of students to the hospital. University president Vincent Price labelled the Takeover as \"one of the most pivotal moments in our university's history,\" claiming that the protestors \"changed this place for the better and improved the lives of many who followed.\"\nDuke University Marine Laboratory, located in the town of Beaufort, North Carolina, is also technically part of Duke's campus. The marine lab is situated on Pivers Island on the Outer Banks of North Carolina, across the channel from Beaufort. Duke's interest in the area began in the early 1930s and the first buildings were erected in 1938. The resident faculty represent the disciplines of oceanography, marine biology, marine biomedicine, marine biotechnology, and coastal marine policy and management. The Marine Laboratory is a member of the National Association of Marine Laboratories. In May 2014, the newly built Orrin H. Pilkey Marine Research Laboratory was dedicated.\nDuke stone.\nThe distinctive stone used for West Campus and other Duke buildings is said to have seven primary colors and seventeen shades of color. The use of Duke stone has been given partial credit for the university's success: \"Duke in fact became a great university in part because it looked like one from the start\".\nDuring the planning of the Collegiate Gothic buildings, James B. Duke initially suggested the use of stone from the Princeton quarry, but the plans were later amended to purchase a local quarry in Hillsborough to reduce costs. After a search for a locally sourced stone suitable for construction in a style \"that made it look like the university was growing out of the ground, like it had been here forever,\" Duke stone and its source quarry in Hillsborough were identified by Duke University Comptroller Frank Clyde Brown and purchased by the university in 1925. Comptroller Brown, who oversaw the planning and construction of the Gothic buildings, wrote that Duke stone \"is much warmer and softer in coloring than the Princeton, and it will look very much older and have a much more attractive antique effect.\"\nDuke stone is a type of Carolina 'slate' or 'bluestone', a metamorphic phyllite rock, with both andesite and dacite mineral composition. Dacitic phyllite is a predominant type of rock found through the Carolina Slate Belt. Duke stone and the Carolina Slate Belt, like the greater Carolina Terrane, are thought to have formed in the Iapetus Ocean off the coast of Gondwana by a chain of volcanic islands known as 'Carolinia', starting around 650 million years ago.\nThe Carolina Slate Belt contains stone of both meta-volcanic and meta-sedimentary origin. The geological literature finds the pre-metamorphosis origin of Duke stone to be variously volcanic and sedimentary: it was likely originally formed by sedimentation of volcanic material. A USGS geologist concludes: \"The Duke quarry phyllite was derived from argillite, tuff or tuffaceous sandstone, and volcanic breccia. Occurrence of laminated argillites suggests marine deposition. \u2026 There is insufficient evidence to determine if the volcanic material was deposited directly by igneous action or if it was re-worked by sedimentary processes. Presence of lava flows and very coarse breccias in Orange County suggest that the volcanic centers were relatively near.\" A UNC geologist concurred that \"original features of the phyllite have been obscured by deformation and recrystallization, but the rock apparently was derived from argillites and tuffs,\" and that \"sedimentary reworking of volcanic materials is to be expected.\"\nAfter its initial formation, Duke stone underwent several metamorphic events, including the collision of Carolinia with Laurentia. The Carolinia-Laurentia collision started around 375 Mya, which coincides with timing of the Acadian orogeny that formed the Appalachian Mountains. Though Duke stone contains no fossils, other areas of the Carolina Terrane contain fossilized corals and trilobites that were used to establish that this formation is exotic to the main North American (Laurentia) landmass.\nThe Duke stone quarry now occupies a section of the Hillsboro Division of the Duke Forest. In new construction and repairs on Duke campus, the use of Duke stone is strictly regulated: \"All stones shall be laid on their natural beds, with 20 percent of stone being split face and 80 percent seam face, mixed proportionately to show variations of stone coloring\". In recent years, high cost of quarrying the stone, and the irregular knapped ashlar shapes with its associated high stonemasonry costs has led to the university establishing a mix of bricks to imitate the Duke stone colors.\nRecent construction.\nA number of construction projects in recent years include renovations to Duke Chapel, Wallace Wade Stadium (football) and Cameron Indoor Stadium (basketball).\nIn early 2014, the Nicholas School of the Environment opened a new home, Environmental Hall, a five-story, glass-and-concrete building that incorporates the highest sustainable features and technologies, and meets or exceeds the criteria for LEED platinum certification. The School of Nursing in April 2014 opened a new addition to the Christine Siegler Pearson Building. In summer 2014, a number of construction projects were completed. The project is part of the final phase of renovations to Duke's West Campus libraries that have transformed one of the university's oldest and most recognizable buildings into a state-of-the-art research facility. The David M. Rubenstein Rare Book and Manuscript Library reopened in August 2015 after about $60 million in renovations to the sections of the building built in 1928 and 1948. The renovations include more space, technology upgrades and new exhibits. In 2013, construction projects included transforming buildings like Gross Hall and Baldwin Auditorium, plus new construction such as the Events Pavilion. About was updated at Gross Hall, including new lighting and windows and a skylight. Baldwin's upgrades include a larger stage, more efficient air conditioning for performers and audience and enhanced acoustics that will allow for the space to be \"tuned\" to each individual performance. The Events Pavilion opened to students in 2013 and serves as temporary dining space while the West Campus Union undergoes major renovations, expected to be completed in the spring of 2016.\nFrom February 2001 to November 2005, Duke spent $835 million on 34 major construction projects as part of a five-year strategic plan, \"Building on Excellence\". Completed projects since 2002 include major additions to the business, law, nursing, and divinity schools, a new library, the Nasher Museum of Art, a football training facility, two residential buildings, an engineering complex, a public policy building, an eye institute, two genetic research buildings, a student plaza, the French Family Science Center, and two new medical-research buildings.\nSingapore and China.\nIn April 2005, Duke and the National University of Singapore signed a formal agreement under which the two institutions would partner to establish Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore. Duke-NUS is intended to complement the National University of Singapore's existing undergraduate medical school, and had its first entering class in 2007. The curriculum is based on that of Duke University School of Medicine. Sixty percent of matriculates are from Singapore and 40% are from over 20 countries. The school is part of the National University of Singapore system, but distinct in that it is overseen by a governing board, including a Duke representative who has veto power over any academic decision made by the board.\nIn 2013, Duke Kunshan University (abbreviated \"DKU\"), a partnership between Duke University, Wuhan University, and the city of Kunshan, was established in Kunshan, China. The university runs Duke degree graduate programs and an undergraduate liberal arts college. Undergraduates are awarded degrees from both Duke Kunshan University and Duke University upon graduation and become members of Duke and DKU's alumni organizations. DKU conducted research projects on climate change, health-care policy and tuberculosis prevention and control.\nAdministration and organization.\nDuke University has 12 schools and institutes, three of which host undergraduate programs: Trinity College of Arts and Sciences, Pratt School of Engineering, and Duke Kunshan University.\nThe university has \"historical, formal, ongoing, and symbolic ties\" with the United Methodist Church, but is a nonsectarian and independent institution.\nDuke's endowment had a market value of $11.9 billion in the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2024. The university's special academic facilities include an art museum, several language labs, Duke Forest, Duke Herbarium, a lemur center, a phytotron, a free-electron laser, a nuclear magnetic resonance machine, a nuclear lab, and a marine lab. Duke is a leading participant in the National Lambda Rail Network and runs a program for gifted children known as the Talent Identification Program.\nAcademics.\nUndergraduate admissions.\nAdmission to Duke is defined by \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\" as \"most selective.\" Duke received nearly 55,000 applications for the Class of 2028, with an overall acceptance rate of 5.1%. The yield rate (the percentage of accepted students who choose to attend) for the Class of 2023 was 54%. The Class of 2024 had a median ACT range of 34\u201335 and an SAT range of 1500\u20131570. (Test score ranges account for the 25th\u201375th percentile of accepted students.) During the 2020\u201321 academic year, Duke began adopting a test-optional policy.\nFrom 2001 to 2011, Duke has had the sixth highest number of Fulbright, Rhodes, Truman, and Goldwater scholarships in the nation among private universities. The university practices need-blind admissions and meets 100% of admitted students' demonstrated needs. About 50 percent of all Duke students receive some form of financial aid, which includes need-based aid, athletic aid, and merit aid. The average need-based grant for the 2019\u201320 academic year was $54,255. In 2020, a study by the Chronicle of Higher Education ranked Duke first on its list of \"Colleges That Are the Most Generous to the Financially Neediest Students.\"\nRoughly 60 merit-based full-tuition scholarships are offered, including the Angier B. Duke Memorial Scholarship awarded for academic excellence, the Benjamin N. Duke Scholarship awarded for community service, and the Robertson Scholars Leadership Program, a joint scholarship and leadership development program granting full student privileges at both Duke and UNC-Chapel Hill. Other scholarships are geared toward students in North Carolina, African-American students, children of alumni, and high-achieving students requiring financial aid.\nDuke's president, Vincent Price, has described efforts to ban legacy admissions as \"troublesome\". A 2022 survey by The Chronicle found about 22% of first-year students were the child or sibling of a Duke alumnus.\nGraduate profile.\nIn 2023, the School of Medicine received more than 7,000 applications and accepted approximately 2.9% of them, while the average GPA and MCAT scores for accepted students in 2023 were 3.92 and 520, respectively. The School of Law accepted approximately 10.5% of its applicants for the Class of 2026, while enrolling students had a median GPA of 3.87 and median LSAT of 170.\nThe university's graduate and professional schools include the Graduate School, Pratt School of Engineering, Nicholas School of the Environment, School of Medicine, Duke-NUS Medical School, School of Nursing, the Fuqua School of Business, School of Law, Divinity School, and Sanford School of Public Policy.\nUndergraduate curriculum.\nDuke offers 46 arts and sciences majors, four engineering majors, 52 minors (including two in engineering) and Program II, which allows students to design their own interdisciplinary major in arts &amp; sciences, and IDEAS, which allows students to design their own engineering major. Twenty-four certificate programs also are available. Students pursue a major and can pursue a combination of a total of up to three, including minors, certificates, and/or a second major. Eighty-five percent of undergraduates enroll in the Trinity College of Arts and Sciences. The balance enroll in Duke's Pratt School of Engineering. Undergraduates at Duke Kunshan can choose from 15 interdisciplinary majors approved by Duke and the Chinese Ministry of Education, and more majors are in the process of approval, including a major in behavioral science.\nTrinity College of Arts and Sciences.\nAt Duke, the undergraduate experience centers around Trinity College, with Engineering students taking approximately half of their Duke common curriculum within Trinity. Engineering students are able to enroll in any classes within the liberal arts college, and Trinity students are able to enroll in any classes within the engineering college. The undergraduate curriculum includes a focus on the humanities. All freshman students take a writing class and a current-issues seminar class. The Graduate School trains roughly 1200 doctoral and masters students in the arts and sciences as well as in divinity, engineering, business, and environmental and earth sciences.\nTrinity's curriculum operates under the revised version of \"Curriculum 2000\". The curriculum aims to help students develop critical faculties and judgment by learning how to access, synthesize, and communicate knowledge effectively. The intent is to assist students in acquiring perspective on current and historical events, conducting research and solving problems, and developing tenacity and a capacity for hard and sustained work. Freshmen can elect to participate in the FOCUS Program, which allows students to engage in an interdisciplinary exploration of a specific topic in a small group setting in their first semesters.\nPratt School of Engineering.\nThe curriculum of Duke's Pratt School of Engineering, significantly transformed in recent years, immerses students in design, computing, research, and entrepreneurship \u2014 but still accommodates educational opportunities, including double majors, in a variety of disciplines from across Duke. The school emphasizes undergraduate research opportunities with faculty. Research and design opportunities arise through a real-world design course for first-year students, internships, independent study and research fellowships, and through design-focused capstone courses. More than 60 percent of Duke Engineering undergraduates have an intensive research experience during their four years, and nearly a fifth publish or present a research paper off-campus. Nearly 54 percent of Duke Engineering undergraduates intern or study abroad. Eighty-five percent have jobs or job offers at the time of graduation. Since July 2018, Duke engineering students have held the Guinness World Record for inventing the world's most fuel-efficient vehicle \u2013 powered by a fuel cell, it achieved 14,573 miles per gallon equivalent. In 2019, Duke Engineering students earned a second Guinness World Record for the world's most efficient all-electric vehicle \u2013 797 miles per kilowatt-hour.\nResearch expenditures at Duke Engineering exceed $88 million per year. Its faculty is highly ranked in overall research productivity among U.S. engineering schools by Academic Analytics. More than 30 Duke alumni and faculty have been elected to the prestigious National Academy of Engineering since its founding in 1964. The school was created by Duke's board of trustees in 1939. It was named in 1999 following a $35 million gift by Edmund T. Pratt Jr., a 1947 graduate and former chief executive of Pfizer. Duke University Pratt School of Engineering celebrated its 75th anniversary in 2014\u20132015.\nHudson Hall is the oldest engineering building at Duke, constructed in 1948. It was renamed to honor Fitzgerald S. \"Jerry\" Hudson (E'46) in 1992.\nThe Fitzpatrick Center for Interdisciplinary Engineering, Medicine and Applied Sciences (FCIEMAS) opened in August 2004. Research facilities focus on the fields of photonics, bioengineering, communications, and materials science and materials engineering. The aim of the building was to emphasize interdisciplinary activities and encourage cross-departmental interactions. The building houses numerous wet bench laboratories (highlighted by a world-class nanotechnology research wing), offices, teaching spaces, and a caf\u00e9. FCIEMAS is also home to the Master of Engineering Management Program offices. The construction of FCIEMAS took more than three years and cost more than $97 million.\nThe newest building is the Wilkinson Building which is a 150,000-square-foot building opened for classes in early 2021 with new spaces for education and research related to interdisciplinary themes of improving human health, advancing computing and intelligent systems, and sustainability. It is located at Research Drive and Telcom Drive next to Bostock Library, also houses Duke Engineering's entrepreneurship initiatives. The building's name recognizes lifetime philanthropic and service contributions of Duke Engineering alumnus Jerry C. Wilkinson and family.\nDuke Kunshan University.\nDuke Kunshan hosts the newest of Duke's undergraduate programs, with its curriculum focused heavily on interdisciplinary coursework and majors\u2014described as a \"research-inflected liberal arts experience\". The curriculum is rooted in seven \"animating principles\", among them Rooted Globalism, Collaborative Problem-Solving, Research and Practice, Lucid Communication, Independence and Creativity, Wise Leadership, and A Purposeful Life. Noah M. Pickus, former Associate Provost and Senior Advisor at Duke and Dean of Undergraduate Curricula Affairs and Faculty Development at Duke Kunshan University, oversaw the development of the university's future-focused, internationalized curriculum. The campus also hosts five Master's programs administered by Duke's graduate schools, including Medical Physics, Global Health, Environmental Policy, Management Studies and Electrical and Computer Engineering.\nLibraries and museums.\nDuke Libraries includes the Perkins, Bostock, and Rubenstein Libraries on West Campus, the Lilly and Music Libraries on East Campus, the Pearse Memorial Library at Duke Marine Lab, and the separately administered libraries serving the schools of business, divinity, law, medicine, and Duke Kunshan University.\nDuke's art collections are housed at the Nasher Museum of Art on Central Campus. The museum was designed by Rafael Vi\u00f1oly and is named for Duke alumnus and art collector Raymond Nasher. The museum opened in 2005 at a cost of over $23 million and contains over 13,000 works of art, including works by William Cordova, Marlene Dumas, Olafur Eliasson, David Hammons, Barkley L. Hendricks, Christian Marclay, Kerry James Marshall, Alma Thomas, Hank Willis Thomas, Bob Thompson, Kara Walker, Andy Warhol, Carrie Mae Weems, Ai Weiwei, Fred Wilson, and Lynette Yiadom Boakye.\nResearch.\nThe National Science Foundation ranked Duke 9th among American universities for research and development expenditures in 2022 with $1.39 billion. In fiscal year 2021, Duke received $608 million in funding from the National Institutes of Health, ranked third in the nation. Duke is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities \u2013 Very high research activity.\"\nThroughout the school's history, Duke researchers have made breakthroughs, including the biomedical engineering department's development of the world's first real-time, three-dimensional ultrasound diagnostic system and the first engineered blood vessels and stents. In 2015, Paul Modrich shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the discovery of mechanism of DNA repairs. In 2012, Robert Lefkowitz along with Brian Kobilka, who is also a former affiliate, shared the Nobel Prize in chemistry for their work on cell surface receptors. Duke has pioneered studies involving nonlinear dynamics, chaos, and complex systems in physics.\nIn May 2006 Duke researchers mapped the final human chromosome, which made world news as it marked the completion of the Human Genome Project. Reports of Duke researchers' involvement in new AIDS vaccine research surfaced in June 2006. The biology department combines two historically strong programs in botany and zoology, while one of the divinity school's leading theologians is Stanley Hauerwas, whom \"Time\" named \"America's Best Theologian\" in 2001. The graduate program in literature boasts several internationally renowned figures, including Fredric Jameson, Michael Hardt, and Rey Chow, while philosophers Robert Brandon and Lakatos Award-winner Alexander Rosenberg contribute to Duke's ranking as the nation's best program in philosophy of biology, according to the \"Philosophical Gourmet Report\".\nRankings and reputation.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nUndergraduate rankings.\nIn 2016, \"The Washington Post\" ranked Duke seventh overall based on the accumulated weighted average of the rankings from \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\", \"Washington Monthly\", \"Wall Street Journal\"/\"Times Higher Education\", \"Times Higher Education\" (global), \"Money\" and \"Forbes\". Duke is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.\nDuke is often labeled as a Southern Ivy due to its similar academic excellence and social prestige of the eight Ivy League universities and institutions.\nIn 2021, Duke was ranked fifth in the \"Wall Street Journal\"/\"Times Higher Education\" College Rankings, having risen five places in the past year. In addition, Duke was ranked second for student outcomes, tied with Harvard, M.I.T., and Stanford. The rankings take into account graduation rate, teaching reputation, graduate salaries, and student debt.\nIn 2020, Duke was ranked 22nd in the world by \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\" and 20th in the world by the \"Times Higher Education World University Rankings\". \"QS World University Rankings\" ranked Duke 61st in the world for its 2025 rankings. Center for World University Rankings (CWUR) ranked Duke 20th globally in its 2020\u201321 report. Duke was ranked 28th best globally by the \"Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU)\" in 2019, focusing on quality of scientific research and the number of Nobel Prizes. The 2010 report by the Center for Measuring University Performance puts Duke at sixth in the nation.\nDuke also ranked 34th in the world and 12th in the country on \"Times Higher Education\"'s global employability ranking in 2021.\nDuke ranks fifth among national universities to have produced Rhodes, Marshall, Truman, Goldwater, and Udall Scholars. As of 2022, Duke graduates have received 20 Churchill Scholarships to the University of Cambridge. As of 2020, Duke has produced 8 Mitchell Scholars. \"Kiplinger\"'s \"50 Best Values in Private Universities 2013\u201314\" ranks Duke at fifth best overall after taking financial aid into consideration.\nIn a 2016 study by \"Forbes\", Duke ranked 11th among universities in the United States that have produced billionaires and first among universities in the South. \"Forbes\" magazine ranked Duke seventh in the world on its list of 'power factories' in 2012. Duke was ranked 17th on Thomson Reuters' list of the world's most innovative universities in 2015. The ranking graded universities based on patent volume and research output among other factors. In 2015, NPR ranked Duke first on its list of \"schools that make financial sense\". In 2016, \"Forbes\" ranked Duke sixth on its list of \"Expensive Schools Worth Every Penny\".\nGraduate school rankings.\nDuke has been named one of the top universities for graduate outcomes several years in a row, having tied with Harvard University and Yale University. In \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\"'s \"America's Best Graduate Schools 2023\u20132024\", Duke's medical school ranked 5th in research. The School of Law was also ranked 5th in those same rankings, with Duke's nursing school ranked 2nd while the Sanford School of Public Policy ranked fifth in Public Policy Analysis for 2019. Among business schools in the United States, the Fuqua School of Business is ranked tied for tenth overall by \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\" for 2020, while \"BusinessWeek\" ranked its full-time MBA program first in the nation in 2014. The graduate programs of Duke's Pratt School of Engineering ranked 24th in the U.S. by \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\" in its 2020 rankings.\nStudent life.\nStudent body.\nDuke's student body consists of 6,789 undergraduates and 9,991 graduate and professional students (as of fall 2021). The median family income of Duke students is $186,700, with 56% of students coming from the top 10% highest-earning families and 17% from the bottom 60% as of 2013[ [update]]. \"The New York Times\" described Duke in 2023 as the least economically diverse top-ranked college in the U.S.\nResidential life.\nDuke requires its students to live on campus for the first three years of undergraduate life, except for a small percentage of second-semester juniors who are exempted by a lottery system. This requirement is justified by the administration as an effort to help students connect more closely with one another and sustain a sense of belonging within Duke. Thus, 85% of undergraduates live on campus. All freshmen are housed in one of 14 residences on East Campus. These buildings range in occupancy size from 50 (Epworth\u2014the oldest residence hall, built in 1892 as \"the Inn\"), which has not been used as a student dorm since the 2017\u20132018 school year, to 250 residents (Trinity). Most of these are in the Georgian style typical of the East Campus architecture. Although the newer residence halls differ in style, they still relate to East's Georgian heritage. Learning communities connect the residential component of East Campus with students of similar academic and social interests. Similarly, students in FOCUS, a first-year program that features courses clustered around a specific theme, live together in the same residence hall as other students in their cluster.\nSophomores and juniors reside on West Campus, while the majority of undergraduate seniors choose to live off campus. West Campus contains seven quadrangles\u2014the four along \"Main\" West were built in the 1930s, while three newer ones have since been added. Central Campus provided housing for over 1,000 students in apartment buildings, until 2019. All housing on West Campus is organized into \"houses\"\u2014sections of residence halls\u2014to which students can return each year. House residents create their house identities. There are houses of unaffiliated students, as well as wellness houses and living-learning communities that adopt a theme such as the arts or foreign languages. There are also numerous \"selective living groups\" on campus for students wanting self-selected living arrangements. SLGs are residential groups similar to fraternities or sororities, except they are generally co-ed and unaffiliated with any national organization. Many of them also revolve around a particular interest such as entrepreneurship, civic engagement or African-American or Asian culture. Fifteen fraternities and nine sororities also are housed on campus. Most of the non-fraternity selective living groups are coeducational.\nGreek and social life.\nAbout 30% of undergraduate men and about 40% of undergraduate women at Duke are members of fraternities and sororities. Most of the 17 Interfraternity Council recognized fraternity chapters live in sections within the residence halls. Eight National Pan-Hellenic Council (historically African-American) fraternities and sororities also hold chapters at Duke. The first historically African-American Greek letter organization at Duke University was the Omega Psi Phi, Omega Zeta chapter, founded on April 12, 1974. In addition, there are seven other fraternities and sororities that are a part of the Inter-Greek Council, the multicultural Greek umbrella organization, in addition to the local group Trident Society. Duke also has Selective Living Groups, or SLGs, on campus for students seeking informal residential communities often built around themes. SLGs are residential groups similar to fraternities or sororities, except they are generally co-ed and unaffiliated with any national organizations. Current SLGs include Brownstone, Maxwell, The Cube, LangDorm, Round Table, Mundi, JAM!, and Wayne Manor. Fraternity chapters and SLGs frequently host social events in their residential sections, which are often open to non-members. Social events often feature established traditions, such as Wayne Manor's Malt Liquor Thursdays (M.L.T.), which have persisted since 1994.\nIn the late 1990s, a new keg policy was put into effect that requires all student groups to purchase kegs through Duke Dining Services. According to administrators, the rule change was intended as a way to ensure compliance with alcohol consumption laws as well as to increase on-campus safety. Some students saw the administration's increasingly strict policies as an attempt to alter social life at Duke. As a result, off-campus parties at rented houses became more frequent in subsequent years as a way to avoid Duke policies. Many of these houses were situated in the midst of family neighborhoods, prompting residents to complain about excessive noise and other violations. Police have responded by breaking up parties at several houses, handing out citations, and occasionally arresting party-goers. In the mid-to-late 2000s, the administration made a concerted effort to help students re-establish a robust, on-campus social life and has worked with numerous student groups, especially Duke University Union, to feature a wide array of events and activities. In March 2006, the university purchased 15 houses in the Trinity Park area that Duke students had typically rented and subsequently sold them to individual families in an effort to encourage renovations to the properties and to reduce off-campus partying in the midst of residential neighborhoods.\nDuke athletics, particularly men's basketball, traditionally serves as a significant component of student life. Duke's students have been recognized as some of the most creative and original fans in all of collegiate athletics. Students, often referred to as Cameron Crazies, show their support of the men's basketball team by \"tenting\" for home games against key Atlantic Coast Conference opponents, especially rival University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC). Because tickets to all varsity sports are free to students, they line up for hours before each game, often spending the night on the sidewalk. For a mid-February game against UNC, some of the most eager students might even begin tenting before spring classes begin. The total number of participating tents is capped at 100 (each tent can have up to 12 occupants), though interest is such that it could exceed that number if space permitted. Tenting involves setting up and inhabiting a tent on the grass near Cameron Indoor Stadium, an area known as Krzyzewskiville, or K-Ville for short. There are different categories of tenting based on the length of time and number of people who must be in the tent. At night, K-Ville often turns into the scene of a party or occasional concert. Duke also has a \"bench-burning\" tradition that began in 1986 which involves bonfires after certain basketball victories.\nActivities.\nStudent organizations.\nMore than 400 student clubs and organizations operate on Duke's campus. These include numerous student government, special interest, and service organizations. Duke Student Government (DSG) charters and provides most of the funding for other student groups and represents students' interests when dealing with the administration. Duke University Union (DUU) is the school's primary programming organization, serving a center of social, cultural, intellectual and recreational life. There are a number of student-run businesses operating on campus, including Campus Enterprises, which offer students real-world business experience. Cultural groups are provided funding directly from the university via the Multicultural Center as well as other institutional funding sources. One of the most popular activities on campus is competing in sports. Duke has 37 sports clubs, and several intramural teams that are officially recognized. Performance groups such as Duke Players; Hoof 'n' Horn, the country's second-oldest student-run musical theater organization; a cappella groups; student bands; and other theater organizations are also prominent on campus. As of the 2016\u201317 school year, there are seven a cappella groups recognized by Duke University A Cappella Council: Deja Blue, Lady Blue, Out of the Blue, the Pitchforks, Rhythm &amp; Blue, Something Borrowed Something Blue, and Speak of the Devil. Duke University mock trial team won the national championship in 2012. Duke University Student Dining Advisory Committee provides guidance to the administration on issues regarding student dining, life, and restaurant choices.\nCultural groups on campus include the Asian Students Association, ASEAN (Alliance of Southeast Asian Nations), Blue Devils United (the student lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender group), Black Student Alliance, Diya (South Asian Association), International Association/International Council, Jewish Life at Duke, KUSA (Korean Undergraduate Student Association), Mi Gente (Latino Student Association), LangDorm, LASO (Latin American Student Organization), Muslim Student Association, Native American Student Coalition, Newman Catholic Student Center, and Students of the Caribbean.\nDuke's chapter of Students Supporting Israel (SSI), an international pro-Israel movement, was denied recognition by the Duke Student Government (DSG) in November 2021. The incident attracted national media attention, with organizations such as The Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law and the Zionist Organization of America advocating on behalf of Duke SSI after Duke's chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine challenged its existence. The Brandeis Center sent a letter to President Price alleging that the derecognition of Duke SSI constituted discrimination against a Jewish student organization. Duke SSI was officially recognized as a student organization in February 2022 after the student government reconsidered the group's application.\nCivic engagement.\nMore than 75 percent of Duke students pursue service-learning opportunities in Durham and around the world through DukeEngage and other programs that advance the university's mission of \"knowledge in service to society.\" Launched in 2007, DukeEngage provides full funding for select Duke undergraduates who wish to pursue an immersive summer of service in partnership with a U.S. or international community. As of summer 2013, more than 2,400 Duke students had volunteered through DukeEngage in 75 nations on six continents. Duke students have created more than 30 service organizations in Durham and the surrounding area. Examples include a weeklong camp for children of cancer patients (Camp Kesem) and a group that promotes awareness about sexual health, rape prevention, alcohol and drug use, and eating disorders (Healthy Devils). Duke-Durham Neighborhood Partnership, started by the Office of Community Affairs in 1996, attempts to address major concerns of local residents and schools by leveraging university resources. Another community project, \"Scholarship with a Civic Mission\", is a joint program between the Hart Leadership Program and the Kenan Institute for Ethics. Another program includes Project CHILD, a tutoring program involving 80 first-year volunteers; and an after-school program for at-risk students in Durham that was started with a $2.25 million grant from the Kellogg Foundation in 2002. Two prominent civic engagement pre-orientation programs also exist for incoming freshmen: Project CHANGE and Project BUILD. Project CHANGE is a free weeklong program co-sponsored by the Kenan Institute for Ethics and Duke Women's Center with the focus on ethical leadership and social change in the Durham community; students are challenged in a variety of ways and work closely with local non-profits. Project BUILD is a freshman volunteering group that dedicates 3,300 hours of service to a variety of projects such as schools, Habitat for Humanity, food banks, substance rehabilitation centers, homeless shelters. Some courses at Duke incorporate service as part of the curriculum to augment material learned in class such as in psychology or education courses (known as service learning courses).\nReserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC).\nDuke's Reserve Officers' Training Corps has three wings: Army, Air Force &amp; Space Force, and Navy &amp; Marines. Duke University Army Reserve Officers' Training Corps (AROTC) students who receive a scholarship or enter the Army ROTC Advanced Course (Junior and Senior Year) must agree to complete an eight-year period of service with the US Army.\nDuke's Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC) Detachment 585 includes members from Duke University and North Carolina Central University. Established in 1951, Detachment 585 is located at Trent Hall on Duke University campus. This program is designed to provide men and women the opportunity to become military officers while earning a degree. Upon graduation, students who have successfully completed this program will receive a commission in either the US Air Force or US Space Force.\nStudent media.\n\"The Chronicle\", Duke's independent undergraduate daily newspaper, has been continually published since 1905. Its editors are responsible for selecting the term \"Blue Devil\". The newspaper won Best in Show in the tabloid division at the 2005 Associated Collegiate Press National College Media Convention. Cable 13, established in 1976, is Duke's student-run television station. It is a popular activity for students interested in film production and media. WXDU, licensed in 1983, is the university's nationally recognized, noncommercial FM radio station, operated by student and community volunteers.\n\"The Chanticleer\" is Duke University's undergraduate yearbook. It was founded while the institution was still Trinity College in 1911, and was first published in 1912. The yearbook been published continually ever since, apart from 1918 when many students left for military service in World War I. In 1919 the yearbook was titled \"The Victory\" to mark the war's end.\nAthletics.\nTeams for then Trinity College were known originally as the Trinity Eleven, the Blue and White or the Methodists. William H. Lander, as editor-in-chief, and Mike Bradshaw, as managing editor, of the Trinity Chronicle began the academic year 1922\u201323 referring to the athletic teams as the Blue Devils. The Chronicle staff continued its use and through repetition, Blue Devils eventually caught on.\nDuke University Athletic Association chairs 27 sports and more than 650 student-athletes. The Blue Devils are members of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I level, the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) and the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). Men's sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, fencing, football, golf, lacrosse, soccer, swimming &amp; diving, tennis, track &amp; field, and wrestling; women's sports include basketball, cross country, fencing, field hockey, golf, lacrosse, rowing, soccer, softball, swimming &amp; diving, tennis, track &amp; field, and volleyball.\nDuke's teams have won 17 NCAA team national championships\u2014the women's golf team has won seven (1999, 2002, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2014 and 2019), the men's basketball team has won five (1991, 1992, 2001, 2010, and 2015), the men's lacrosse team has won three (2010, 2013, and 2014), and the men's soccer (1986) and women's tennis (2009) teams have won one each. Duke consistently ranks among the top in the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics (NACDA) Directors' Cup, an overall measure of an institution's athletic success. For Division I in 2015, Duke finished 20th overall and fifth in the ACC. The Blue Devils have finished within the top 10 six times since the inception of the Cup in 1993\u201394. Also, Athletic Director Kevin White earned multiple awards in 2014, including the National Football Foundation's John L. Toner Award.\nOn the academic front, nine Duke varsity athletics programs registered a perfect 1,000 score in the NCAA's multi-year Academic Progress Report (APR) released in April 2016.\nMen's basketball.\nDuke's men's basketball team is one of the nation's most successful basketball programs. The team's success was particularly outstanding during its 42 years (1980\u20132022) under coach Mike Krzyzewski (often simply called \"Coach K\"). The team holds the record for the most Atlantic Coast Conference tournament titles with twenty three. Coach K has also coached the USA men's national basketball team since 2006 and led the team to Olympic golds in 2008, 2012, and 2016. His teams also won World Championship gold in 2010 and 2014. Overall, 32 Duke players have been selected in the first round of the NBA draft in the Coach K era. More than 50 Duke players have been selected in the NBA draft. Former consensus national players of the year in men's basketball include: Dick Groat, Art Heyman, Johnny Dawkins, Danny Ferry, Christian Laettner, Elton Brand, Jay Williams (twice), Shane Battier, JJ Redick (twice), Marvin Bagley III, RJ Barrett, Zion Williamson and Cooper Flagg.\nIn 2021, Jon Scheyer was named the team's next head coach following Coach K's retirement at the end of the 2021\u201322 season.\nFootball.\nThe Blue Devils have won seven ACC Football Championships, have had ten players honored as ACC Player of the Year (the most in the ACC), and have had three Pro Football Hall of Famers come through the program (second in the ACC to only Miami's four). The Blue Devils have produced 11 College Football Hall of Famers, which is tied for the second most in the ACC. Duke has also won 18 total conference championships (7 ACC, 9 Southern Conference, and 1 Big Five Conference). That total is tied with Clemson for the highest in the ACC.\nThe most famous Duke football season came in 1938, when Wallace Wade coached the \"Iron Dukes\" that shut out all regular season opponents; only three teams in history can claim such a feat. That same year, Duke made their first Rose Bowl appearance, where they lost, 7\u20133, when USC scored a touchdown in the final minute of the game. Wade's Blue Devils lost another Rose Bowl to Oregon State in 1942, this one held at Duke's home stadium due to the attack on Pearl Harbor, which resulted in the fear that a large gathering on the West Coast might be in range of Japanese aircraft carriers. The football program proved successful in the 1950s and 1960s, winning six of the first ten ACC football championships from 1953 to 1962 under coach Bill Murray; the Blue Devils would not win the ACC championship again until 1989 under coach Steve Spurrier.\nDavid Cutcliffe was brought in prior to the 2008 season, and amassed more wins in his first season than the previous three years combined. The 2009 team won 5 of 12 games, and was eliminated from bowl contention in the next-to-last game of the season. Mike MacIntyre, the defensive coordinator, was named 2009 Assistant Coach of the Year by the American Football Coaches Association (AFCA).\nWhile the football team has struggled at times on the field, the graduation rate of its players is consistently among the highest among Division I FBS schools. Duke's high graduation rates have earned it more AFCA Academic Achievement Awards than any other institution.\nIn 2012, Duke football team made its first bowl game appearance since 1994 with a win over arch-rival North Carolina, a bowl which they would lose to the Cincinnati Bearcats in the by a score of 48\u201334.\n2013 marked the beginning of the Blue Devils' recent but relative success, having a breakout 10\u20132, 6\u20132 (ACC) season while claiming the title of Coastal Division Champions. Duke would go on to play the Florida State Seminoles in the ACC Championship game where they would lose to the national champions 45\u20137. Duke received an invite to the Chick-fil-a Peach Bowl that same year in which they took on the Texas A&amp;M Aggies led by college football legend Johnny Manziel, losing by a score of 52\u201348.\nFor the 2014 season, Duke finished 9\u20133, 5\u20133 (ACC) and earned a trip to the Sun Bowl, where the Blue Devils lost to the Pac-12's Arizona State 36\u201331. In 2015, the Detroit Lions drafted Duke offensive guard Laken Tomlinson and the Washington Redskins drafted wide receiver Jamison Crowder. In 2019, Duke quarterback Daniel Jones was drafted sixth overall by the New York Giants.\nTrack and field.\nIn 2003, Norm Ogilvie was promoted to Director of Track and Field, and has led athletes to over 60 individual ACC championships, and 81 All-America selections, along with most of the track and field records being broken during his tenure. A new facility, the Morris Williams Track and Field Stadium, opened in 2015.\nAlumni.\nSixteen Nobel laureates (three alumni), three Turing Award winners, and fifty Rhodes Scholars have been affiliated with the university. Duke is also the alma mater of one president of the United States, one president of Chile, twenty-five U.S. cabinet members, six U.S. governors, many members of United States Congress and U.S. diplomats, twenty-seven college presidents, four foreign royalties, and fourteen living billionaires, as of early 2020.

{"id": "53274", "revid": "36922266", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53274", "title": "Richmond, Virginia", "text": "Capital city of Virginia, United States\nRichmond ( ) is the capital city of the U.S. state of Virginia. Incorporated in 1742, Richmond has been an independent city since 1871. It is the fourth-most populous city in Virginia, with a population of 226,610 at the 2020 census. The Richmond metropolitan area, with over 1.37 million residents, is the third-most populous metropolitan area in Virginia and 44th-largest in the United States.\nRichmond is located at the James River's fall line, west of Williamsburg, east of Charlottesville, east of Lynchburg and south of Washington, D.C. Surrounded by Henrico and Chesterfield counties, Richmond is at the intersection of Interstate 95 and Interstate 64 and encircled by Interstate 295, Virginia State Route 150 and Virginia State Route 288. Major suburbs include Midlothian to the southwest, Chesterfield to the south, Varina to the southeast, Sandston to the east, Glen Allen to the north and west, Short Pump to the west, and Mechanicsville to the northeast.\nRichmond was an important village in the Powhatan Confederacy and was briefly settled by English colonists from Jamestown from 1609 to 1611. Founded in 1737, it replaced Williamsburg as the capital of the Colony and Dominion of Virginia in 1780. During the Revolutionary War period, several notable events occurred in the city, including Patrick Henry's \"Give me liberty or give me death!\" speech in 1775 at St. John's Church and the passage of the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom written by Thomas Jefferson. During the American Civil War, Richmond was the capital of the Confederate States of America.\nThe Jackson Ward neighborhood is the city's traditional hub of African American commerce and culture, once known as the \"Black Wall Street of America\" and the \"Harlem of the South.\" At the beginning of the 20th century, Richmond had one of the world's first successful electric streetcar systems.\nLaw, finance, and government primarily drive Richmond's economy. The downtown area is home to federal, state, and local governmental agencies as well as notable legal and banking firms. The greater metropolitan area includes several \"Fortune\" 500 companies: Performance Food Group, Altria, CarMax, Dominion Energy, Markel, Owens and Minor, Genworth Financial, and ARKO Corp. The city is one of about a dozen to have both a U.S. Court of Appeals and a Federal Reserve Bank.\nHistory.\nColonial era.\nAfter the first permanent English-speaking settlement was established at Jamestown, Virginia, in April 1607, Captain Christopher Newport led explorers northwest up the James River to an inhabited area in the Powhatan Nation.\nRichmond was Arrohattoc territory where Arrohateck village was located. However, as time progressed relations between the Arrohattocs and English colonists declined, and by 1609 the tribe was unwilling to trade with the settlers. As the population began to dwindle, the tribe declined and was last mentioned in a 1610 report by the visiting William Strachey. By 1611 the tribe's Henrico town was found to be deserted when Sir Thomas Dale went to use the land to found Henricus.\nIn 1611, the first European settlement in Central Virginia was established at Henricus, where the Falling Creek empties into the James River. In 1619, early Virginia Company settlers established the Falling Creek Ironworks there. Decades of conflicts between the Powhatan and the settlers followed, including the Battle of Bloody Run, fought near Richmond in 1656, after tensions arose from an influx of Manahoacs and Nahyssans from the North. Nonetheless, the James Falls area saw more White settlement in the late 1600s and early 1700s.\nIn early 1737, planter William Byrd II commissioned Major William Mayo to lay out the original town grid, completed in April. Byrd named the city after the English town of Richmond near (and now part of) London, because the view of the James River's bend at the fall line reminded him of his home at Richmond Hill on the River Thames. In 1742, the settlement was incorporated as a town.\nAmerican Revolution.\nIn 1775, Patrick Henry delivered his famous \"Give me liberty or give me death!\" speech in Richmond's St. John's Church, greatly influencing Virginia's participation in the First Continental Congress and the course of the American Revolution. On April 18, 1780, the state capital was moved from Williamsburg to Richmond, providing a more centralized location for Virginia's increasing western population and theoretically isolating the capital from a British attack from the coast. In 1781, Loyalist troops led by Benedict Arnold led a raid on Richmond and burnt it, leading Governor Thomas Jefferson to flee while the Virginian militia, led by Sampson Mathews, unsuccessfully defended the city.\nEarly United States.\nRichmond recovered quickly from the war, thriving within a year of its burning. In 1786, the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, drafted by Thomas Jefferson, was enacted, separating church and state and advancing the legal principle for freedom of religion in the United States. In 1788, the Virginia State Capitol, designed by Jefferson and Charles-Louis Cl\u00e9risseau in the Greek Revival style, was completed.\nTo bypass Richmond's rapids on the upper James River and provide a water route across the Appalachian Mountains to the Kanawha River, which flows westward into the Ohio River and converges with the Mississippi River, George Washington helped design the James River and Kanawha Canal. The canal started in Westham and cut east to Richmond, facilitating the transfer of cargo from flat-bottomed James River bateaux above the fall line to the ocean-faring ships below. The canal boatmen legacy is represented by the figure in the center of the city flag.\nBecause of the canal and the hydropower the falls generated, Richmond emerged as an important industrial center after the American Revolutionary War (1775\u20131783). It became home to some of the largest manufacturing facilities, including iron works and flour mills, in the South and the country.\nBy 1850, Richmond was connected by the Richmond and Petersburg Railroad to Port Walthall, where ships carrying over 200 tons of cargo could connect to Baltimore or Philadelphia. Passenger liners could reach Norfolk, Virginia, through the Hampton Roads harbor. In the 19th century, Richmond was connected to the North by the Richmond, Fredericksburg, and Potomac Railroad, later replaced by CSXT.\nThe railroad also was used by some to escape slavery in the mid-19th century. In 1849, Henry \"Box\" Brown had himself nailed into a small box and shipped from Richmond to abolitionists in Philadelphia through Baltimore's President Street Station on the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad, often used by the Underground Railroad to assist escaping disguised slaves reach the free state of Pennsylvania.\nAmerican Civil War.\nFive days after the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter, the Virginia Convention voted on April 17, 1861, to secede from the United States, pending ratification by popular vote. On May 20, 1861, the Confederate States Congress voted to move its national capital from Montgomery, Alabama, to Richmond, and three days later, on May 23, 1861, Virginia voters ratified the Ordinance of Secession, making the action official.\nRichmond held local, state and national Confederate government offices, hospitals, a railroad hub, and one of the largest slave markets. It also had the largest Confederate arms factory, the Tredegar Iron Works. The factory produced artillery and other munitions, including heavy ordnance machinery and the 723 tons of armor plating that covered the CSS \"Virginia\", the world's first ironclad ship used in war. The Confederate States Congress shared quarters in the Jefferson-designed Virginia State Capitol with the Virginia General Assembly. The Confederacy's executive mansion, known as the \"White House of the Confederacy,\" was two blocks away on Clay Street.\nLocated about from the national capital in Washington, D.C., Richmond was at the end of a long supply line and difficult to defend. For four years, its defense required the bulk of the Army of Northern Virginia and the Confederacy's best troops and commanders. The Union army made Richmond a main target in the campaigns of 1862 and 1864\u201365. In late June and early July 1862, Union General-in-Chief George B. McClellan threatened but failed to take Richmond in the Seven Days Battles of the Peninsula campaign. Three years later, Richmond became indefensible in March 1865 after nearby Petersburg fell and several remaining rail supply lines to the south and southwest were broken.\nOn March 25, Confederate General John B. Gordon's desperate attack on Fort Stedman, east of Petersburg, failed. On April 1, Union Cavalry General Philip Sheridan, assigned to interdict the Southside Railroad, met brigades commanded by Southern General George Pickett at the Five Forks Junction, defeated them, took thousands of prisoners, and advised Union General-in-Chief Ulysses S. Grant to order a general advance. When the Union Sixth Corps broke through Confederate lines on the Boydton Plank Road south of Petersburg, Confederate casualties exceeded 5,000, about a tenth of Lee's defending army. Lee then informed President Jefferson Davis that he intended to evacuate Richmond.\nOn April 2, 1865, the Confederate Army began Richmond's evacuation. Confederate President Davis and his cabinet, Confederate government archives, and its treasury's gold, left the city that night by train. Confederate officials burned documents and troops burned tobacco and other warehouses to deny the Union any spoils. In the early morning of April 3, Confederate troops exploded the city's gunpowder magazine, killing several paupers in a temporary Almshouse and a man on 2nd St. The concussion shattered windows all over the city. Later that day, General Godfrey Weitzel, commander of the 25th Corps of the United States Colored Troops, accepted Richmond's surrender from the mayor and a group of leading citizens who did not evacuate. Union troops eventually contained the fires, but about 25% of the city's buildings were destroyed.\nOn April 3, President Abraham Lincoln visited Grant at Petersburg and took a launch up the James River to Richmond on April 4. While Davis attempted to organize the Confederate government in Danville, Lincoln met Confederate Assistant Secretary of War John A. Campbell, handing him a note inviting Virginia's state legislature to end their rebellion. After Campbell spun the note to Confederate legislators as a possible end to the Emancipation Proclamation, Lincoln rescinded his offer and ordered General Weitzel to prevent the state legislature from meeting.\nOn April 6, Union forces killed, wounded, or captured 8,000 Confederate troops at Sayler's Creek, southwest of Petersburg. The Confederate Army continued a general retreat southwestward, and General Lee continued to reject General Grant's surrender entreaties until Sheridan's infantry and cavalry encircled the shrinking Army of Northern Virginia and cut off its ability to retreat further on April 8. Lee surrendered his remaining approximately 10,000 troops the following morning at Appomattox Court House, meeting Grant at the McLean Home.\nDavis was captured on May 10 near Irwinville, Georgia and taken back to Virginia, where he was imprisoned two years at Fort Monroe until freed on bail.\nPostbellum.\nA decade after the Civil War, Richmond resumed its position as a major urban center of economic productivity with iron front buildings and massive brick factories. Canal traffic peaked in the 1860s, with railroads becoming the dominant shipping method. Richmond became a major railroad crossroads, showcasing the world's first triple railroad crossing. Tobacco warehousing and processing continued to play a central economic role, advanced by the world's first cigarette-rolling machine that James Albert Bonsack of Roanoke invented between 1880 and 1881.\nLewis Ginter was the founder of Allen &amp; Ginter which was at the time one of the world's largest tobacco companies. He would devote his philanthropy to Richmond and was quoted saying \"I am for Richmond, first and last.\" He built the Jefferson Hotel and suburbs north of Richmond which would go on to be the model for much of the country.\nAnother important contributor to Richmond's resurgence was the Richmond Union Passenger Railway, a trolley system developed by electric power pioneer Frank J. Sprague. The system opened its first Richmond line in 1888, using an overhead wire and a trolley pole to connect to the current and electric motors on the car's trucks. The success led to electric streetcar lines rapidly spreading to other cities. A post-World War II transition to buses from streetcars began in May 1947 and was completed on November 25, 1949.\n20th century.\nBy the beginning of the 20th century, the city's population had reached 85,050 in , making it the most densely populated city in the Southern United States. In the 1900 Census, Richmond's population was 62.1% white and 37.9% black. Freed slaves and their descendants created a thriving African-American business community, and the city's historic Jackson Ward became known as the \"Wall Street of Black America.\" In 1903, African-American businesswoman and financier Maggie L. Walker chartered St. Luke Penny Savings Bank, served as its president, and was the first black female bank president in the United States. Charles Thaddeus Russell was Richmond's first black architect, and he designed the bank's office. Today, the bank is called the Consolidated Bank and Trust Company and is the country's oldest surviving African-American bank. Another prominent African-American from this time was John Mitchell Jr., a newspaper editor, civil rights activist, and politician.\nIn 1910, the former city of Manchester consolidated with Richmond, and in 1914 the city annexed Barton Heights, Ginter Park, and Highland Park in Henrico County. In May 1914, Richmond became the headquarters of the Fifth District of the Federal Reserve Bank.\nSeveral major performing arts venues were constructed during the 1920s, including what are now the Landmark Theatre, Byrd Theatre, and Carpenter Theatre. The city's first radio station, WRVA, began broadcasting in 1925. WTVR-TV (CBS 6), Richmond's first television station, was also the first TV station south of Washington, D.C.\nBetween 1963 and 1965, there was a \"downtown boom\" that led to the construction of more than 700 buildings. In 1968, Virginia Commonwealth University was created by the merger of the Medical College of Virginia and the Richmond Professional Institute.\nOn January 1, 1970, Richmond's borders expanded south by and its population increased by 47,000 after several years of court cases in which Chesterfield County unsuccessfully fought annexation.\nIn 1995, a multimillion-dollar flood wall was completed, protecting the city's low-lying areas from the oft-rising James River. Consequently, the River District businesses grew rapidly, bolstered by the creation of a Canal Walk along the city's former industrial canals. Today the area is home to much of Richmond's entertainment, dining, and nightlife activity.\nIn 1996, racial tensions grew amid controversy about adding the statue of African American Richmond native and tennis star Arthur Ashe to the series of statues of Confederate figures on Monument Avenue. After several months of controversy, Ashe's bronze statue was finally completed on July 10, 1996.\n21st century.\nBy the beginning of the 21st century, the population of the greater Richmond metropolitan area had reached approximately 1,100,000, although the population of the city itself had declined to less than 200,000. On November 2, 2004, former Virginia governor L. Douglas Wilder was elected as the city's first directly elected mayor in over 60 years.\nMost of the statues honoring Confederate leaders such as the Robert E. Lee monument on Monument Avenue were removed during or after the George Floyd protests in June 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin. The city removed the last Confederate statue, honoring Confederate General General A. P. Hill, on December 12, 2022.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (4.3%) is water. The city is in the Piedmont region of Virginia, at the James River's highest navigable point. The Piedmont region is characterized by relatively low, rolling hills, and lies between the low, flat Tidewater region and the Blue Ridge Mountains. Significant bodies of water in the region include the James River, the Appomattox River, and the Chickahominy River.Richmond-Petersburg is the 44th largest Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) in the United States, and includes the independent cities of Richmond, Colonial Heights, Hopewell, and Petersburg, and the counties of Charles City, Chesterfield, Dinwiddie, Goochland, Hanover, Henrico, New Kent, Powhatan, and Prince George. On July 1, 2009, the Richmond\u2014Petersburg MSA's population was 1,258,251.\nRichmond is located north of Petersburg, Virginia, southeast of Charlottesville, Virginia, northwest of Norfolk, Virginia, south of Washington, D.C., and northeast of Raleigh, North Carolina.\nCityscape.\nRichmond's original street grid, laid out in 1737, included the area between what are now Broad, 17th, and 25th Streets and the James River. Modern Downtown Richmond is slightly farther west, on the slopes of Shockoe Hill. Nearby neighborhoods include Shockoe Bottom, the historically significant and low-lying area between Shockoe Hill and Church Hill, and Monroe Ward, which contains the Jefferson Hotel. Richmond's East End includes neighborhoods like the rapidly gentrifying Church Hill, home to St. John's Church, poorer areas like Fulton, Union Hill, and Fairmont, and public housing projects like Mosby Court, Whitcomb Court, Fairfield Court, and Creighton Court closer to Interstate 64.\nThe area between Belvidere Street, Interstate 195, Interstate 95, and the river, which includes Virginia Commonwealth University, is socioeconomically and architecturally diverse. North of Broad Street, the Carver and Newtowne West neighborhoods are demographically similar to neighboring Jackson Ward.Carver has seen some gentrification due to its proximity to VCU. The affluent area between the Boulevard, Main Street, Broad Street, and VCU, known as the Fan, is home to Monument Avenue, an outstanding collection of Victorian architecture, and many students. West of the Boulevard is the Museum District, which contains the Virginia Historical Society and the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts. South of the Downtown Expressway are Byrd Park, Maymont, Hollywood Cemetery, the predominantly black working-class Randolph neighborhood, and white working-class Oregon Hill. Cary Street between Interstate 195 and the Boulevard is a popular commercial area called Carytown.\nRichmond's Northside is home to numerous listed historic districts. Neighborhoods such as Chestnut Hill-Plateau and Barton Heights began to be developed at the end of the 19th century when the new streetcar system made it possible for people to live on the city's outskirts and commute downtown. Other prominent Northside neighborhoods include Azalea, Barton Heights, Bellevue, Chamberlayne, Ginter Park, Highland Park, and Rosedale.\nFarther west is the affluent, suburban West End. Windsor Farms is among its best-known sections. The West End also includes middle- to low-income neighborhoods, such as Laurel, Farmington, and the areas around the Regency Mall. More affluent areas include Glen Allen, Short Pump, and the areas of Tuckahoe away from Regency Mall, all north and northwest of the city. The University of Richmond and the Country Club of Virginia are located on this side of town near the Richmond-Henrico border.\nThe portion of the city south of the James River is known as the Southside. Southside neighborhoods range from the rapidly gentrifying, condo laden Old Town Manchester, the area just south of the river across from downtown, to the affluent and middle-class suburban Westover Hills, Forest Hill, Southampton, Stratford Hills, Oxford, Huguenot Hills, Hobby Hill, and Woodland Heights to the impoverished Manchester and Blackwell areas, the Hillside Court housing projects, and the ailing Jefferson Davis Highway commercial corridor. Other Southside neighborhoods include Bellemeade, Fawnbrook, Broad Rock, Cherry Gardens, Cullenwood, and Beaufont Hills. Much of Southside, specifically towards the southwest of southside developed a suburban character as part of Chesterfield County before being annexed by Richmond, most notably in 1970.\nClimate.\nRichmond has a humid subtropical (K\u00f6ppen: \"Cfa\") or oceanic (Trewartha: \"Doak\") climate, with hot, humid summers and moderately cold winters. The mountains to the west act as a partial barrier to outbreaks of cold, continental air in winter. Arctic air is delayed long enough to be modified and further warmed as it subsides in its approach to Richmond. The open waters of the Chesapeake Bay and Atlantic Ocean contribute to the humid summers and cool winters. The coldest weather normally occurs from late December to early February, and the January daily mean temperature is , with an average of 6.0 days with highs at or below the freezing mark. Richmond's Downtown and areas south and east of downtown are in USDA Hardiness zones 7b. Surrounding suburbs and areas to the north and west of Downtown are in Hardiness Zone 7a. Temperatures seldom fall below , with the most recent subzero reading on January 7, 2018, when the temperature reached . The July daily mean temperature is , and high temperatures reach or exceed approximately 43 days a year; temperatures are not uncommon but do not occur every year. Extremes in temperature have ranged from on January 19, 1940, to on August 6, 1918. The record cold maximum is , set on February 11 and 12, 1899. The record warm minimum is , set on July 12, 2011. The warmest months recorded were July 2020 and August 1900, both averaging 82.9\u00a0\u00b0F (28.3\u00a0\u00b0C). The coldest, January 1940, averaged 24.2\u00a0\u00b0F (-4.3\u00a0\u00b0C).\nPrecipitation is rather uniformly distributed throughout the year. Dry periods lasting several weeks sometimes occur, especially in autumn, when long periods of pleasant, mild weather are most common. There is considerable variability in total monthly precipitation amounts from year to year, so no one month can be depended to be normal. Snow has been recorded during seven of the 12 months. Falls of or more within 24 hours occur once a year on average. Annual snowfall is usually moderate, averaging per season. Snow typically remains on the ground for only one or two days, but it remained for 16 days in 2010 (January 30 to February 14). Ice storms (freezing rain or glaze) are not uncommon, but they are seldom severe enough to cause considerable damage.\nThe James River reaches tidewater at Richmond, where flooding may occur in any month of the year, most frequently in March and least in July. Hurricanes and tropical storms have been responsible for most flooding during the summer and early fall months. Hurricanes passing near Richmond have produced record rainfalls. In 1955, three hurricanes, including Hurricane Connie and Hurricane Diane, which brought heavy rains five days apart, produced record rainfall in a six-week period. In 2004, the downtown area suffered extensive flood damage after the remnants of Hurricane Gaston dumped up to of rain.\nDamaging storms occur mainly from snow and freezing rain in winter, and from hurricanes, tornadoes, and severe thunderstorms in other seasons. Damage can come from wind, flooding, rain, or a combination of the three. Tornadoes are infrequent, but some notable ones have been observed in the Richmond area.\nDowntown Richmond averages 84 days of nighttime frost annually. Nighttime frost is more common in areas north and west of Downtown and less common south and east of downtown. From 1981 to 2010, the average first temperature at or below freezing was on October 30 and the average last one on April 10.\n&lt;section begin=\"weather box\" /&gt;&lt;section end=\"weather box\" /&gt;\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\nRichmond's population is approximately 226,000. As an independent city, Richmond is surrounded by Henrico County, which has a population of about 334,000. The Greater Richmond region has an estimated population of about 1.3 million.\nCrime.\nRichmond experienced a spike in overall crime, particularly in the murder rate, during the 1980s, 1990s, and the early 2000s, when it was consistently ranked as one of the most dangerous cities in the United States.\nSince the late 2000s, various forms of crime have significantly decreased in the city. Its major crime rate, including violent and property crimes, decreased 47 percent between 2004 and 2009 to its lowest level in more than a quarter of a century. In 2008, Richmond had fallen to 49th on a Morgan Quitno Press ranking of the most dangerous cities in the United States, and the city recorded its lowest homicide rate since 1971. By 2012, Richmond was no longer in the top 200.\nIn recent years, Richmond, like other cities, has had a slight increase in homicides, although violent and other forms of crime remain below the national average.\nReligion.\nIn 1786, the Virginia General Assembly adopted the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, which Thomas Jefferson, wrote in 1779. The First Freedom Center now commemorates the site.\nRichmond has several historic churches, including several prominent Anglican/Episcopal ones from before the Revolutionary War, Monumental Church, St. Paul's Episcopal Church, and St. John's Episcopal Church.

It is one of two Eastern Orthodox churches in Richmond and home to the annual Richmond Greek Festival.\nThere are seven masjids in the Greater Richmond area, with three more in construction to accommodate the growing Muslim population. The first was Masjid Bilal. In the 1950s, Muslims from the East End organized under Nation of Islam (NOI), meeting in Temple No. 24 on North Avenue. After the 1975 NOI split, Muslims who joined mainstream Islam started meeting at Shabaaz Restaurant on Nine Mile Road. By 1976, the Muslims met in a rented church they unsuccessfully tried to buy. Ultimately, the congregation bought an old grocery store on Chimbarazoo Boulevard, where Masjid Bilal is now located. Initially called \"Masjid Muhammad No. 24,\" it was given its current name in 1990. The next masjid was the Islamic Center of Virginia, ICVA, established in 1973 as a non-profit, tax-exempt organization. After successful fundraising, ICVA bought land on Buford Road and began constructing the new masjid in the early 1980s. The other five masjids in the Richmond area are Islamic Center of Richmond (ICR) in the West End; Masjid Umm Barakah on 2nd Street, Downtown; Islamic Society of Greater Richmond (ISGR) in the West End end; Masjidullah in the north side; and Masjid Ar-Rahman in the East End.\n Seminaries in Richmond include Virginia Union University's school of theology, Union Presbyterian Seminary, and the Baptist Theological Seminary at Richmond.

Nelson announced a new temple to be built in Virginia. The church's first temple in the state is in Glen Allen, northwest of Richmond.\nEconomy.\nRichmond's strategic location on the James River at the rocky fall line separating Virginia's Piedmont and Tidewater regions made it a natural development point for commerce. For centuries and three modes of transportation\u2014boats, with the Great Turning Basin; railroad, with one of only two rail line triple crossings in North America; and cars, with two intersecting major interstates\u2014the downtown has always been a natural hub.\nLaw and finance have long been driving forces in the economy.

The Fan, the Museum District, Jackson Ward, Carver, Carytown, Oregon Hill, and Church Hill are districts anchored by large streets, such as Franklin Street, Cary Street, the Boulevard, and Monument Avenue. The city's recent population growth mainly has been concentrated in these areas.\nHistoric districts.\nRichmond's city code provides for the creation of old and historic districts to \"recognize and protect the historic, architectural, cultural, and artistic heritage of the City\". Pursuant to that authority, the city has designated 45 districts. Most districts also are listed in the Virginia Landmarks Register (\"VLR\") and the National Register of Historic Places (\"NRHP\").\nFifteen districts represent broad sections of the city:\nThe remaining thirty districts are limited to an individual building or group of buildings throughout the city:\nFood.\nRichmond has been recognized in recent years as a \"foodie city\", particularly for its modern renditions of traditional Southern cuisine. The city also claims the invention of the sailor sandwich, which includes pastrami, knockwurst, Swiss cheese and mustard on rye bread. Richmond is where canned beer was first made commercially available in 1935.\nSports.\nRichmond does not have a major league professional sports team. The city has several minor league sports franchises, including the Richmond Kickers of USL League One and the Richmond Flying Squirrels of the Class AA Eastern League of Minor League Baseball, a San Francisco Giants affiliate. The Kickers began playing in Richmond in 1993, making them the oldest continually operated professional club in the United States. The club now plays home matches at City Stadium. In 2018, the Richmond Kickers left the USL to be founders in Division 3 Soccer. The Squirrels opened their first season at The Diamond on April 15, 2010. From 1966 through 2008, the city was home to the Richmond Braves, a AAA affiliate of the Atlanta Braves of Major League Baseball, until the franchise relocated to Georgia.\nRichmond is home to the Richmond Black Widows, the city's first women's football team, founded in 2015 by Sarah Schkeeper. The team is in the Women's Football Alliance, which preseason begins in January and regular season in April.\nTennis is popular in Richmond. In 2010, the United States Tennis Association named Richmond the third \"Best Tennis Town\", after Charleston, South Carolina, and Atlanta, Georgia.\nRichmond hosted the 2015 UCI Road World Championships, which had cyclists from 76 countries and an estimated beneficial $158.1 million economic impact on the Greater Richmond Region from event staging and visitor spending. The championship course was the first real-world location to be recreated within the indoor cycle training application, Zwift. The application has subsequently added two other UCI world championships courses, Innsbruck from 2018 and Harrogate from 2019.\nThe city is home to the University of Richmond football team, who most notably won the 2008 NCAA Division I FCS National Championship. The team plays its home games at Robins Stadium.\nRichmond also has seen recent men's and women's college basketball success in the Atlantic 10 Conference. The Richmond Spiders play at the Robins Center and the VCU Rams play at the Stuart C. Siegel Center. The Stuart C. Siegel Center is home to the Virginia High School Basketball Championships as well.\nThe 0.75-mile Richmond Raceway is located in nearby Henrico County and hosts auto racing, including NASCAR events.\nParks and recreation.\nThe city operates one of the country's oldest municipal park systems. In 1851, the City Council voted to acquire , now known as Monroe Park. Monroe Park is adjacent to the Virginia Commonwealth University campus, and is one of over 40 parks totaling more than .\nOther city parks include Joseph Bryan Park Azalea Garden, Forest Hill Park (former site of the Forest Hill Amusement Park), and Chimborazo Park (site of the National Battlefield Headquarters).\nJames River.\nSeveral of the city's parks are along the James River, many of which are a part of the James River Parks System, which offers bike trails, hiking and nature trails, and many scenic overlooks. The trails are used for the Xterra East Championship running and mountain biking courses of the off-road triathlon.\nParks exist on two major islands in the James River, Belle Isle and Brown's Island. Belle Isle, a former Powhatan fishing village, colonial-era horse race track, and Civil War prison camp, is the larger of the two. It contains many bike trails and a small cliff used for rock climbing instruction. The island still has many remnants of the Civil War prison camp, including an arms storage room and a gun emplacement used to quell prisoner riots. Brown's Island is smaller and a popular venue for many spring and summer free outdoor concerts and festivals, such as the weekly Friday Cheers concert series and the James River Beer and Seafood Festival.\nRichmond is the only city in the United States with Class IV rapids running through it.\nTwo other major city parks along the river are Byrd Park and Maymont, located near Randolph, Carytown, and the Fan District. Byrd Park features a running track, with exercise stops, a public dog park, and a number of small lakes for small boats, as well as two monuments, Buddha house and an amphitheater. The World War I Memorial Carillon, built in 1926, features prominently in the park. Maymont, adjacent to Byrd Park, is a Victorian estate with a museum, formal gardens, native wildlife exhibits, nature center, carriage collection, and children's farm.\nGovernment.\nRichmond city government consists of a city council with representatives from nine districts serving in a legislative and oversight capacity, as well as a popularly elected, at-large mayor serving as head of the executive branch. Citizens in each of the nine districts elect one council representative each to serve a four-year term. Beginning with the November 2008 election, council terms were lengthened to four years. The city council elects from among its members one member to serve as council president and one to serve as council vice president. The city council meets at City Hall, located at 900 E. Broad St., 2nd Floor, on the second and fourth Mondays of every month, except August.\nIn 1977, a federal district court ruled in favor of Curtis Holt Jr. who had claimed the council's existing election process\u00a0\u2014 an at large voting system\u00a0\u2014 was racially biased. The verdict required the city to rebuild its council into nine distinct wards. Within the year the city council switched from majority white to majority black, reflecting the city's populace. This new city council elected Richmond's first black mayor, Henry L. Marsh.\nRichmond's government changed in 2004 from a council\u2013manager form of government with a mayor elected by and from the council to an at-large, popularly elected mayor. Unlike most major cities, in order to be elected, a mayoral candidate must win a plurality of the vote in five of the city's nine council districts. If no one crosses that threshold, a runoff is held between the two top finishers in the first round. This was implemented as a compromise in order to address concerns that better-organized and wealthier white voters could have undue influence. In a landslide election, incumbent mayor Rudy McCollum was defeated by L. Douglas Wilder, who previously served Virginia as the first elected African American governor in the United States since Reconstruction. Levar Stoney served as Mayor from 2016 to 2024. Dr. Danny Avula was sworn is as mayor on December 31, 2024.\nThe mayor is not a part of the Richmond City Council.\nAs of 2025[ [update]], the Richmond City Council consisted of:\nEducation.\nPublic schools.\nThe City of Richmond operates 28 elementary schools, seven middle schools, and eight high schools, serving a total student population of 24,000. The city has one Governor's School, the Maggie L. Walker Governor's School for Government and International Studies. In 2008, it was named one of Newsweek magazine's 18 \"public elite\" high schools, and rated 16 of America's best high schools in 2012. Richmond's public school district also runs one of Virginia's four public charter schools, the Patrick Henry School of Science and Arts, founded in 2010. The 2020 class had an on-time graduation rate of 71.6%, at least 20 percentage points behind most other school divisions, making it the worst in the state.\nPrivate schools.\nAs of 2008, there were 36 private schools serving grades one or higher in the City of Richmond. Some of these schools include: Banner Christian School; St. Bridget School; Brook Road Academy; Collegiate School; Grace Christian School; Grove Christian School; Guardian Christian Academy; St. Christopher's School; St. Catherine's School; Southside Baptist Christian School; Northstar Academy; The Steward School; Trinity Episcopal School; The New Community School; and Veritas School.\nThe city's only Catholic high school is Cristo Rey Richmond High School, after Benedictine College Preparatory and St. Gertrude High School relocated to a combined campus in Goochland.\nColleges and universities.\nThe Richmond area has many major institutions of higher education, including Virginia Commonwealth University (public), University of Richmond (private), Virginia Union University (private), South University\u2013Richmond (private, for-profit), Union Theological Seminary &amp; Presbyterian School of Christian Education (private), and the Baptist Theological Seminary in Richmond (BTSR\u2014private). Several community colleges are in the metro area, including J. Sargeant Reynolds Community College and Brightpoint Community College (Chesterfield County). Several technical colleges are in Richmond, including ITT Technical Institute, ECPI College of Technology, and Centura College. The same is true of vocational colleges, including Fortis College and Bryant Stratton College.\nVirginia State University is located about south of Richmond, in Ettrick, just outside Petersburg. Randolph-Macon College is located about north of Richmond, in Ashland.\nMedia.\nThe \"Richmond Times-Dispatch,\" owned by Lee Enterprises, Inc., is the local daily newspaper, with a Sunday circulation of 120,000. \"Style Weekly,\" an online alternative local publication owned by VPM Media Corporation, covers popular culture, arts, and entertainment. RVA Magazine is the city's only independent art music and culture publication. Originally a quarterly, it now is a monthly. The \"Richmond Free Press\" and the \"Voice\" cover the news from an African-American perspective.\nInfrastructure.\nTransportation.\nThe Greater Richmond area is served by the Richmond International Airport (), located in Sandston, southeast of Richmond and within an hour drive of historic Williamsburg, Virginia. Richmond International is served by ten passenger and four cargo airlines, with over 200 daily flights providing non-stop service to major domestic destinations and connecting flights to worldwide destinations. A record 4.8 million passengers used Richmond International Airport in 2023, breaking the previous record of 4.4 million in 2019.\nRichmond is a major hub for intercity bus company Greyhound Lines, which has its terminal at 2910 N Boulevard. Multiple daily runs connect directly with Washington, D.C., New York, Raleigh, and elsewhere. Direct trips to New York take approximately 7.5 hours. Discount carrier Megabus provides curbside service from Main Street Station. Direct service is available to Washington, D.C., Hampton Roads, Charlotte, Raleigh, Baltimore, and Philadelphia. Connections to Megabus-served cities, such as New York, are made from Washington, D.C.\nThe Greater Richmond Transit Company (GRTC) provides transit and paratransit bus service in Richmond and Henrico and Chesterfield counties. The GRTC, however, serves only small parts of the suburban counties. The far West End, Innsbrook and Short Pump, and almost all of Chesterfield County have no public transportation, despite dense housing, retail, and office development. According to a 2008 GRTC operations analysis report, a majority of GRTC riders use their services because they do not have available alternatives, such as a private vehicle. In 2014, U.S. Department of Transportation granted Richmond and the surrounding metropolitan area a roughly $25\u00a0million grant for the GRTC Pulse bus rapid transit system, which opened in June 2018, running along Broad Street from Willow Lawn to Rocketts Landing.\nThe Richmond area has two railroad stations served by Amtrak. Each station receives regular service from north of Richmond, including Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, and New York. The region's main station, Staples Mill Road Station, is located just outside the city on a major north\u2013south freight line that receives service to and from all points south, including Raleigh, Durham, Charlotte, Savannah, Newport News, Norfolk and Florida. The historic Main Street Station, renovated in 2004, is the only railway station in the City of Richmond. As of 2010, it only receives trains headed to and from Newport News due to track layout.\nRichmond also benefits from an excellent interstate highway position, lying at the junction of east\u2013west Interstate 64 and north\u2013south Interstate 95, two of the most heavily traveled highways in the state. As the state capital, Richmond has great state highway access.\nMajor highways.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nUtilities.\nDominion Energy supplies the Richmond Metro area's electricity. Headquartered in Richmond, it is one of the nation's largest producers of energy, serving retail energy customers in nine states. Electricity for the Richmond area is primarily produced at the North Anna Nuclear Generating Station, Surry Nuclear Generating Station, and a coal-fired station in Chester, Virginia. These three plants provide a total of 4,453 megawatts of power. Several other natural gas plants provide extra power during peak demands, including facilities in Chester, and Surry, and two in Richmond, Gravel Neck and Darbytown.\nRichmond's Department of Public Utilities provides the Richmond Metro area's natural gas, including portions of Henrico and Chesterfield counties. It also supplies water to the city and surrounding area through wholesale contracts with Henrico, Chesterfield, and Hanover counties. The DPU is one of Virginia's largest water producers, providing water to approximately 500,000 people, including 62,000 city customers, through a distribution system of water mains, pumping stations, storage facilities, and a modern plant that can treat up to 132\u00a0million gallons daily from the James River.\nThe wastewater treatment plant is on the James River's south bank. It can treat up to 70\u00a0million gallons of water per day of sanitary sewage and stormwater before returning it to the river. The wastewater utility also operates and maintains of sanitary sewer and pumping stations, of intercepting sewer lines, and the Shockoe Retention Basin, a 44-million-gallon stormwater reservoir used during heavy rains.\nSister cities.\nRichmond's sister cities are:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is located on the Dublin\u2013Belfast corridor on the east coast of Ireland, mostly in County Louth but with the south fringes of the town in County Meath, north of Dublin city centre. Drogheda had a population of 44,135 inhabitants in 2022, making it the eleventh largest settlement by population in all of Ireland, and the largest town in the Republic of Ireland, by both population and area. It is the second largest in County Louth with 35,990 and sixth largest in County Meath with 8,145. It is the last bridging point on the River Boyne before it enters the Irish Sea. The UNESCO World Heritage Site of Newgrange is located west of the town.\nArea.\nDrogheda was founded as two separately administered towns in two different territories: Drogheda-in-Meath (i.e. the Lordship and Liberty of Meath, from which a charter was granted in 1194) and Drogheda-in-Oriel (or 'Uriel', as County Louth was then known). The division came from the twelfth-century boundary between two Irish kingdoms, colonised by different Norman interests, just as the River Boyne continues to divide the town between the dioceses of Armagh and Meath. In 1412, these two towns were united, and Drogheda became a county corporate, styled as \"the County of the Town of Drogheda\". Drogheda continued as a county borough until the establishment of county councils under the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898, which saw all of Drogheda, including a large area south of the Boyne, become part of an extended County Louth. With the passing of the County of Louth and Borough of Drogheda (Boundaries) Provisional Order 1976, County Louth again grew larger at the expense of County Meath. The boundary was further altered in 1994 by the Local Government (Boundaries) (Town Elections) Regulations 1994. The 2007\u20132013 Meath County Development Plan recognises the Meath environs of Drogheda as a primary growth centre on a par with Navan.\nHistory.\nHinterland.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe town is situated in an area which contains a number of archaeological monuments dating from the Neolithic period onwards, of which the large passage tombs of Newgrange, Knowth, and Dowth are probably the best known. The density of archaeological sites of the prehistoric and early Christian periods uncovered in the course of ongoing developments, (including during construction of the Northern Motorway or 'Drogheda Bypass'), has shown that the hinterland of Drogheda has been a settled landscape for millennia.\nTown beginnings.\nDespite local tradition linking Millmount to Amergin Gl\u00faingel, in his 1978 study of the history and archaeology of the town, John Bradley stated that \"neither the documentary nor the archaeological evidence indicates that there was any settlement at the town prior to the coming of the Normans\". The results of a number of often large-scale excavations carried out within the area of the medieval town appear to confirm this statement.\nOne of the earliest structures in the town is the motte-and-bailey castle, now known as Millmount Fort, which overlooks the town from a bluff on the south bank of the Boyne and which was probably erected by the Norman Lord of Meath, Hugh de Lacy, sometime before 1186. The wall on the east side of Rosemary Lane, a back-lane which runs from St. Laurence Street towards the Augustinian Church, is the oldest stone structure in Drogheda. It was completed in 1234 as the west wall of the first castle guarding access to the northern crossing point of the Boyne. A later castle, circa 1600, called \"Laundy's Castle\" stood at the junction of West Street and Peter's Street. On Meathside, the \"Castle of Drogheda\" or \"The Castle of Comfort\" was a tower house castle on the south side of the Bull Ring. It served as a prison, and as a sitting of the Irish parliament in 1494. The earliest known town charter is that granted to Drogheda-in-Meath by Walter de Lacy in 1194. In the 1600s, the name of the town was also spelled \"Tredagh\" in keeping with the common pronunciation, as documented by Gerard Boate in his work \"Irelands' Natural History\". In \"c.\" 1655 it was spelled \"Droghedagh\" on a map by William Farriland.\nDrogheda was an important walled town in the English Pale in the medieval period. It frequently hosted meetings of the Irish Parliament at that time. According to R.J. Mitchell in \"John Tiptoft, Earl of Worcester\", in a spill-over from the War of the Roses the Earl of Desmond and his two youngest sons (still children) were executed there on Valentine's Day 1468 on orders of the Earl of Worcester, the Lord Deputy of Ireland. It later came to light (for example in Robert Fabyan's \"The New Chronicles of England and France\"), that Elizabeth Woodville, the queen consort, was implicated in the orders given. The parliament was moved to the town in 1494 and passed Poynings' Law, the most significant legislation in Irish history, a year later. This effectively subordinated the Irish Parliament's legislative powers to the King and his English Council.\nLater events.\nThe town was besieged twice during the Irish Confederate Wars.\nIn the second siege of Drogheda, an assault was made on the town from the south, the tall walls breached, and the town was taken by Oliver Cromwell on 11 September 1649, as part of the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland and it was the site of a massacre of the Royalist defenders. In Cromwell's own words after the siege of Drogheda, \"When they submitted, their officers were knocked on the head, and every tenth man of the soldiers killed and the rest shipped to Barbados.\"\nIn 1661, Henry Moore, 3rd Viscount Moore was created the Earl of Drogheda in the Peerage of Ireland.\nThe Battle of the Boyne, 1690, occurred some west of the town, on the banks of the River Boyne, at Oldbridge. The Tholsel in West Street was completed in 1770.\nIn 1790, Drogheda Harbour Commissioners were established by the Port of Drogheda Act 1790. They remained in place until 1997 when a commercial enterprise, the Drogheda Port Company, replaced them.\nIn 1825, the Drogheda Steam Packet Company was formed in the town, providing shipping services to Liverpool.\nIn 1837, the population of Drogheda area was 17,365 people, of whom 15,138 lived in the town.\nTown arms.\nDrogheda's coat of arms features St. Laurence's Gate with three lions, and a ship emerging from either side of the barbican. It is blazoned as \"Azure per pale dimidiated, on the dexter side three lions passant guardant in pale or, on the sinister as many hulls of ships in pale of the last, surmounted by a castle with two towers triple-towered argent\". The town's motto translates as \"God our strength, merchandise our glory\".\nThe star and crescent emblem in the crest of the coat of arms is mentioned as part of the mayor's seal by D'Alton (1844). In 2010, Irish president Mary McAleese, in a speech delivered during an official visit to Turkey, stated that the star and crescent had been added in the aftermath of the Great Famine as gratitude for food supplies donated by the Ottoman Sultan Abd\u00fclmecid I, which had arrived at Drogheda by ship. Irish press quickly pointed out the story was a myth, with a local historian calling it 'nothing short of sheer nonsense,' and the star and crescent dating back to King John. Later evidence, including a letter displayed at the office of the European Commission, showed that the Sultan did send aid during the 1845\u20131852 famine.\n20th century.\nIn 1921, the preserved severed head of Saint Oliver Plunkett, who was executed in London in 1681, was put on display in St. Peter's (Catholic) Church, where it remains today. The church is located on West Street, which is the main street in the town.\nIn 1979, Pope John Paul II visited Drogheda as part of his five-stop tour of Ireland. He arrived less than a month after the IRA assassination of Lord Mountbatten, Queen Elizabeth's cousin, in Mullaghmore. On 29 September 1979, he arrived in Dublin, where he gave his first mass. He then addressed 300,000 people in Drogheda, where he appealed \"on his knees\" to paramilitaries to end the violence in Ireland:\n\"Now I wish to speak to all men and women engaged in violence. I appeal to you, in language of passionate pleading. On my knees I beg you to turn away from the paths of violence and to return to the ways of peace. You may claim to seek justice. I too believe in justice and seek justice. But violence only delays the day of justice. Violence destroys the work of justice. Further violence in Ireland will only drag down to ruin the land you claim to love and the values you claim to cherish.\"\n21st century.\nTwo decades into the 21st century some of the historic core of Drogheda town has suffered urban decline. Some of the buildings have been derelict for some years and are in danger of collapse. There was a 2006 traffic plan for pedestrianisation of West Street. It was rejected at a vote of the elected councillors. They had come under pressure from traders in the area concerned about a potential further decline in customer footfall. But the issue has come up for debate again. When asked, Drogheda residents point out that a combination of expensive car-parking and high commercial rates had a push-pull effect on the town's centre. Shops were forced to close and at the same time shoppers brought their business to retail parks such as the Boyne Shopping Centre on Bolton Street. A substantial root-and-branch approach to renewal of the locality was proposed in \"Westgate Vision: A Townscape Recovery Guide\". The Westgate area of Drogheda is to be subject to a 10-year regeneration by Louth County Council.\nDemographics.\nDrogheda has a hinterland of 70,000+ within a radius. According to the 2022 census, there were 44,135 people living in Drogheda town at that time.\nAs of the 2011 census, non-Irish nationals accounted for 16.1% of the population, compared with a national average of 12%. Polish nationals (1,127) were the largest group, followed by Lithuanian nationals (1,044 people). As of the 2016 census, 17.4% of the population were non-Irish nationals, with 676 people from the UK, 1,324 Polish nationals, 1,014 Lithuanians, 1,798 people from elsewhere in the EU, and 1,400 with other (non-EU) nationalities.\nAs of the 2022 census, the ethnic makeup of the town was 80.65% white total, including 67.81% white Irish and 12.57% other white people, 7.48% not stated, 5.7% Asian, 2.44% other and 3.73% black.\nArts and entertainment.\nMusic.\nThe town was selected to host Fleadh Cheoil na h\u00c9ireann for two years in 2018 and 2019.\nDrogheda is home to two brass bands: Drogheda Brass Band and Lourdes Brass Band.

There is also Drogheda Institute for Further Education (DIFE), a third-level college situated in Moneymore townland.\nClimate.\nDrogheda has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: \"Cfb\").\nSport.\nThe town's association football team, Drogheda United, was formed in 1919, and their home matches are played at Head In The Game Park. Nicknamed \"The Drogs\", they currently compete in the League of Ireland Premier Division, which they won for the first time in 2007. The club achieved success by winning the FAI Cup in 2005 and 2024, and back to back Setanta Sports Cup successes in 2006 and 2007, along with the 2012 EA Sports Cup. The Drogs came close to UEFA Champions League qualification on 2 occasions, in 2008 and 2013. They also narrowly missed out on a UEFA Cup place twice, in 2006 and 2007. Since their formation, the club have won 12 major honours. In 2011, Drogheda became the sister club of Turkish club Trabzonspor due to their matching colours, and the town's history of Ottoman assistance during the Great Famine. They are also the sister club of English club Walsall and Danish club Silkeborg through their shared ownership through Trivela Group. As cup winners, the Drogs will compete in the preliminary rounds of the UEFA Conference League in July 2025.\nIn rugby union, the local Boyne RFC team was formed in 1997 from the amalgamation of Delvin RFC and Drogheda RFC.

Areas of contention include the aesthetic, legal, and medical approaches to fat people.\nThe modern fat acceptance movement began in the late 1960s. Besides its political role, the fat acceptance movement also constitutes a subculture which acts as a social group for its members. The fat acceptance movement has been criticized for not adding value to the debate over human health, with some critics accusing the movement of \"promoting a lifestyle that can have dire health consequences\".\nHistory.\nThe history of the fat acceptance movement can be dated back to 1967 when 500 people met in New York's Central Park to protest against anti-fat bias. Sociologist Charlotte Cooper has argued that the history of the fat activist movement is best understood in waves, similar to the feminist movement, with which she believes it is closely tied. Cooper believes that fat activists have suffered similar waves of activism followed by burnout, with activists in the following wave often unaware of the history of the movement, resulting in a lack of continuity.\nOther scholars, such as Amy Erdman Farrell, have argued that the history of fat activism that traditionally gets told is a dominantly white history, and that the intersectional work of fat activists of color frequently gets overlooked within this traditional history.\nFirst wave.\nFirst wave activities consisted of isolated activists drawing attention to the dominant model of obesity and challenging it as only one of several possible models. This kind of political climate was the background of the fat acceptance movement, which originated in the late 1960s. Like other social movements from this period, the fat acceptance movement, initially known as \"Fat Pride\", \"Fat Power\", or \"Fat Liberation\", often consisted of people acting in an impromptu fashion. A \"fat-in\" was staged in New York's Central Park in 1967. Called by radio personality Steve Post, the \"Fat-in\" consisted of a group of 500 people eating, carrying signs and photographs of Twiggy (a model famous for her thin figure), and burning diet books.\nIn 1967, Lew Louderback wrote an article in the \"Saturday Evening Post\" called \"More People Should be FAT\" in response to discrimination against his wife. The article led to a meeting between Louderback and William Fabrey, who went on to found the first organization for fat people and their supporters, originally named the 'National Association to Aid Fat Americans' and currently called the National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance (NAAFA). NAAFA was founded in America, in 1969, by Bill Fabrey in response to discrimination against his wife. He primarily intended it to campaign for fat rights, however, a reporter attending the 2001 NAAFA conference notes that few attendees were active in fat rights politics and that most women came to shop for fashion, wear it on the conference catwalk or to meet a potential partner. Since 1991, Fabrey has worked as a director with the Council on Size and Weight Discrimination, specializing in the history of the size acceptance movement.\nIn 1972, the feminist group The Fat Underground was formed. It began as a radical chapter of NAAFA and spun off to become independent when NAAFA expressed concerns about its promotion of a stronger activist philosophy. The FU were inspired by and, in some cases, members of the Radical Therapy Collective, a feminist group that believed that many psychological problems were caused by oppressive social institutions and practices. Founded by Sara Fishman (then Sara Aldebaran) and Judy Freespirit, the Fat Underground took issue with what they saw as a growing bias against obesity in the scientific community. They coined the saying, \"a diet is a cure that doesn't work, for a disease that doesn't exist\". Shortly afterward, Fishman moved to Connecticut, where, along with Karen Scott-Jones, she founded the New Haven Fat Liberation Front, an organization similar to the Fat Underground in its scope and focus. In 1983, the two groups collaborated to publish a seminal book in the field of fat activism, \"Shadow on a Tightrope\", which collected several fat activist position papers initially distributed by the Fat Underground, as well as poems and essays from other writers.\nIn 1979, Carole Shaw coined the term Big Beautiful Woman (BBW) and launched a fashion and lifestyle magazine of the same name aimed at plus-sized women. The original print magazine ceased publication in May 2003, but continued in various online formats. The term \"BBW\" has become widely used to refer to any fat woman (sometimes in a derogatory way). Several other periodicals focusing on fashion and lifestyle for \"fuller-figured\" women were published in print from the early 1980s to the mid 2010s. From 1984 to 2000, \"Radiance: The Magazine for Large Women\" was published in print to \"support women 'all sizes of large in living proud, full, active lives, at whatever weight, with self-love and self-respect.\"\nIn the UK, the London Fat Women's Group was formed, the first British fat activist group, and was active between approximately 1985 and 1989. Other first wave activities included the productions of zines such as \"Figure 8\" and \"Fat!So?\" by Marilyn Wann. The latter went on to become a book of the same name.\nSecond wave.\nIn the second wave, the fat acceptance movement became more widespread in the US and started to spread to other countries. Ideas from the movement began to appear in the mainstream. Publishers became more willing to publish fat acceptance themed literature. The 1980s witnessed an increase in activist organizations, publications, and conferences.\nIn 1989, a group of people including actress Anne Zamberlan formed the first French organization for fat acceptance, \"Allegro fortissimo\". Organizations began holding conferences and conventions, including NAAFA. By the 1990s, input from the fat acceptance movement began to be incorporated into research papers by some members of the medical professions such as new anti-dieting programs and models of obesity management.\nThird wave.\nThe fat acceptance movement has seen a diversification of projects during the third wave. Activities have addressed issues of both fat and race, class, sexuality, and other issues. Size discrimination has been increasingly addressed in the arts, as well.\nCampaigning themes.\nThe fat acceptance movement argues that fat people are targets of hatred and discrimination. In particular, advocates suggest obese women are subjected to more social pressure than obese men. The movement argues that these attitudes comprise a fat phobic entrenched societal norm, evident in many social institutions, including the mass media, where fat people are often ridiculed, or held up as objects of pity. Discrimination includes a lack of equal access to transportation and employment. Members of the fat acceptance movement perceive negative societal attitudes as persistent, and as being based on the presumption that fatness reflects negatively on a person's character. Fat activists push for change in societal, personal, and medical attitudes toward fat people. Fat acceptance organizations engage in public education about what they describe as myths concerning fat people.\nDiscrimination.\nFat people experience many different kinds of discrimination because of their weight. This discrimination appears in healthcare, employment, education, personal relationships, and the media. Fat individuals also argue clothing stores discriminate against them. For example, some women have complained that \"one size fits all\" stores, which offer a single size for each item, do not cater to those above a certain weight. Public transport has also been subject to criticism due to lack of inclusivity to fat people as seats and walkways are often too small to accommodate them.\nOn the subject of horseback riding, there has been disagreement between fat acceptance activists and animal rights activists.\nHealth.\nFat activists argue that anti-fat stigma and aggressive diet promotion have led to an increase in psychological and physiological problems among fat people. For instance, individuals who experience weight discrimination have reported facing more psychological distress, more loneliness, and lower well-being. Along with this, weight discrimination can heighten risk for obesity, chronic inflammation, and disease burden. People can indulge in health-risk behaviors, such as avoiding physical activity. Experiencing and internalizing weight stigma are identified as critical risk factors leading to eating pathology. Concerns are also raised that modern culture's focus on weight loss does not have a foundation in scientific research, but instead is an example of using science as a means to control deviance, as a part of society's attempt to deal with something that it finds disturbing. Diet critics cite the high failure rate of permanent weight-loss attempts, and the dangers of \"yo-yo\" weight fluctuations and weight-loss surgeries. Fat activists argue that the health issues of obesity and being overweight have been exaggerated or misrepresented, and that health issues are used as a cover for cultural and aesthetic prejudices against fat.\nProponents of fat acceptance maintain that people of all shapes and sizes can strive for fitness and physical health. They believe that healthy behaviors can be independent of body weight. Informed by this approach, psychologists who were unhappy with the treatment of fat people in the medical world initiated the Health at Every Size movement. It has five basic tenets: (1) enhancing health, (2) size and self-acceptance (3) the pleasure of eating well, (4) the joy of movement, and (5) an end to weight bias.\nSome proponents also claim that people with obesity can be metabolically healthy. Some medical studies have challenged that \"healthy obesity\" concept, although the definitions of metabolically healthy obesity are not standardized across studies.\nGender.\nFat women.\nThe issues faced by fat women in society have been a central theme of the fat acceptance movement since its inception. Although the first organization, National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance, and the first book, \"Fat Power\" (1970), were both created by men, in each case they were responses to weight discrimination experienced by their wives. Women soon started campaigning on their behalf with the first feminist group, 'The Fat Underground', being formed in 1973. Issues addressed regarding women have included body image, and in particular the thin ideal and its effect on women. Critics say NAAFA, which opposes dieting and weight-loss surgery, is an apologist for an unhealthy lifestyle. But NAAFA says it does no such thing, that some people are just bigger and no less deserving of the same rights as everyone else.\nFat men.\nThe fat acceptance movement has primarily focused on a feminist model of patriarchal oppression of fat women, most clearly represented by the encouragement of women to diet. However, Sander L. Gilman argues that, until the 20th century, dieting has historically been a man's activity. He continues, \"Obesity eats away at the idealized image of the masculine just as surely as it does the idealized image of the feminine.\" William Banting was the author of an 1863 booklet called \"Letter On Corpulence\", which modern diets have used as a model. Men respond to being overweight differently, (i.e., having a Body Mass Index of 25 or more), being half as likely as women to diet, a quarter as likely to undergo weightloss surgery and only a fifth as likely to report feeling shame about their weight. Irmgard Tischner identifies this behavior as rooted in notions of masculinity that require disregard for healthcare: \"Men do not have to care about their size or health, as they have women to care about those things for them\".\nSome gay men have moved beyond disregard for size to fat acceptance and fat activism with movements like chub culture, which started as Girth &amp; Mirth clubs in San Francisco in 1976 and the bear culture which fetishizes big, hairy men. Ganapati Durgadas argues that fat bisexual and gay men \"are reminders of the feminine stigma with which heterosexism still tars queer men\". In a comparison of queer fat positive zines, the lesbian-produced \"Fat Girl\" was found to have political debate content absent from gay male orientated zines such as \"Bulk Male\" and \"Big Ad\". Joel Barraquiel Tan comments: \"If fat is a feminist issue, then fat or heft is a fetishized one for gay men. Gay men tend to sexualize difference, where lesbians have historically politicized it.\"\nA fat heterosexual man is known as a \"Big Handsome Man\" (BHM), in counterpart to a Big Beautiful Woman. Like some fat and gay men, BHMs have sexualized their difference and receive validation of this identity from BBWs or straight women known as \"Female Fat Admirers\".\nLegislation.\nIn the 1970s, fat people in the United States began seeking legal redress for discrimination based on weight, primarily in the workplace but also for being denied access to, or treated differently in regards to, services or entertainment. The results of these cases have varied considerably, although in some instances the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) has been successfully used to argue cases of discrimination against fat people. Roth and Solovay argue that, as with transgender people, a major cause for the variation in success is the extent to which litigants are apologetic for their size (with more apologetic plaintiffs finding more success):\nWhat is the difference between a million-dollar weight case award and a losing case? Like the difference between many winning and losing transgender cases, it's all about the attitude. Does the claimant's attitude and experience about weight/gender reinforce or challenge dominant stereotypes? Winning cases generally adopt a legal posture that reinforces social prejudices. Cases that challenge societal prejudices generally lose.\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act continues to be used as there is no USA federal law against weight discrimination; however, the state of Michigan passed a law against weight discrimination in 1976. The cities of Washington, D.C., San Francisco (2000), Santa Cruz, Binghamton, Urbana (1990s), New York (2023), and Madison (1970s) have also passed laws prohibiting weight discrimination. In the cities that have a weight discrimination law, it is rare for more than one case a year to be brought, except for San Francisco which may have as many as six. Opinions amongst city enforcement workers vary as to why the prosecution numbers are so low, although they all suggested that both overweight people and employers were unaware of the protective legislation and it was also noted that the cities with anti-weight discrimination laws tended to be liberal college towns.\nNot all legal changes have protected the rights of fat people. Despite recommendations from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to the contrary, in 2009 the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit decided that fat people will only qualify as disabled if it can be proved that their weight is caused by an underlying condition, supporting the concept that being obese is not inherently a disability. The Supreme Court of Texas came to a similar conclusion in 2023. But in 2018, the Washington Supreme Court provided weight-related disability bias protection without evidence of a related medical condition. Other countries besides the United States have considered legislation to protect the rights of fat people. In the UK an All-Party Parliamentary Group published a report in 2012 called \"Reflections on Body Image\" that found that one in five British people had been victimized because of their weight. The report recommended that Members of Parliament investigated putting \"appearance-based discrimination\" under the same legal basis as sexual or racial discrimination via the Equality Act 2010 which makes it illegal to harass, victimize or discriminate against anyone in the workplace based on several named categories, including size or weight. The Equality Act came into force on 1 October 2010, it brings together over 116 separate pieces of legislation into one single Act. The Act provides a legal framework to protect the rights of individuals and advance equality of opportunity for all.\nFat studies.\nThere has also been an emerging body of academic studies called Fat Studies. Marilyn Wann argues that fat studies moved beyond being an individual endeavor to being a field of study with the 2004 conference \"Fat Attitudes: An Examination of an American Subculture and the Representation of the Female Body\". The American Popular Culture Association regularly includes panels on the subject. In many colleges, student groups with a fat activist agenda have emerged, including Hampshire, Smith, and Antioch. Fat studies are now available as an interdisciplinary course of study at some colleges, taking a similar approach to other identity studies such as women's studies, queer studies, and African American studies. As of 2011, there were two Australian courses and ten American courses that were primarily focused on fat studies or Health at Every Size, and numerous other courses that had some fat acceptance content. Taylor &amp; Francis publish an online \"Fat Studies\" journal. The first national Fat Studies seminar was held at York in May 2008, leading to the 2009 publication \"Fat Studies in the UK\", edited by Corinna Tomrley and Ann Kalosky Naylor.\nDivision within the movement.\nThe fat acceptance movement has been divided in its response to proposed legislation defining morbidly obese people as disabled. NAAFA board member Peggy Howell says: \"There's a lot of conflict in the size acceptance community over this. I don't consider myself disabled, and some people don't like 'fat' being considered a disability.\" An example of the positive perspective of obesity being classified as a disability in wider society is noted by a person interviewed by Amy Erdman in her book Fat Shame: \"[Deborah Harper] makes a point to tell me how impressed she is with the way many do make quiet and polite accommodations for her.\" Women are particularly active within the fat acceptance movement and membership of fat acceptance organizations is dominated by middle-class women in the heaviest 1\u20132% of the population. Members have criticized the lack of representation in the movement from men, people of color, and people of lower socioeconomic status.\nCriticism.\nThe fat acceptance movement has been criticized from several perspectives. The primary criticism is that fat acceptance ignores studies that have shown health issues to be linked to obesity and hence encourages an unhealthy lifestyle. In 2008, Lily-Rygh Glen, a writer, musician, and former fat acceptance activist, interviewed multiple women who claimed to be rejected by their peers within the movement and labeled \"traitors\" when they changed their diets.\nMedical criticism.\nHuman health is a multi-faceted issue; more and more rigorous scientific research reveals the relationship between weight and health is complex. The fat acceptance movement has been criticized for not adding value to the debate over human health, with some critics accusing the movement of \"promoting a lifestyle that can have dire health consequences\". There is a considerable amount of evidence that being obese is connected to increased all-cause mortality and diseases, and significant weight loss (&gt;10%), using a variety of diets, improves or reverses metabolic syndromes and other health outcomes associated with obesity. Barry Franklin, director of a cardio rehab facility, stated: \"I don't want to take on any specific organization but... A social movement that would suggest health at any size in many respects can be misleading.\" Franklin also agrees that fit people who are obese have cardiovascular mortality rates that are lower than thin, unfit people, and proponents of the fat acceptance movement argue that people of all shapes and sizes can choose behaviors that support their fitness and physical health.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

One of the most important military engineers in European history, his defensive principles remained in use for nearly 100 years after his death, while aspects of his offensive tactics were employed into the 20th century. \nViewing civilian infrastructure as closely connected to military effectiveness, Vauban upgraded many of France's major ports, as well as new projects like the \"Canal de la Bruche\", which is still in use today. He founded the , whose curriculum was based on his own principles of design, strategy and training.\nHis economic tract, , used statistics in support of his arguments, making it a precursor of modern economics. Later destroyed by royal decree, it contained radical proposals for a more even distribution of the tax burden. His application of rational and scientific methods to solving engineering and social issues anticipated an approach common in the Age of Enlightenment.\nPerhaps the most enduring aspect of Vauban's legacy was his view of France as a geographical entity. His advocacy of giving up territory for a more coherent and defensible border was unusual for the period; the boundaries of the French state he proposed in the north and east have changed very little since.\nPersonal details.\nS\u00e9bastien le Prestre de Vauban was born May 1633 in Saint-L\u00e9ger-de-Foucheret, renamed Saint-L\u00e9ger-Vauban in 1867, in what is now the Bourgogne-Franche-Comt\u00e9 region. His parents, Urbain Le Prestre (c. 1602\u20131652) and Edm\u00e9e de Cormignolle (died c. 1651), were members of the minor nobility from Vauban in Bazoches. \nIn 1570, his grandfather, Jacques Le Prestre, acquired Ch\u00e2teau de Bazoches when he married Fran\u00e7oise de la Perri\u00e8re, an illegitimate daughter of the Comte de Bazoches, who died intestate. The 30-year legal battle by the Le Prestre family to retain the property proved financially ruinous, forcing Urbain to become a forestry worker. He also designed gardens for the local gentry, including the owners of the Ch\u00e2teau de Ru\u00e8re, where Vauban spent his early years.\nVauban had only one sibling, a sister Charlotte (1638\u20131645?) who died young, but his cousin, Paul le Prestre (c. 1630 \u2013 1703), was an army officer who later supervised construction of Les Invalides. Three of Paul's sons served in the army, two of whom were killed in action in 1676 and 1677. The third, Antoine (1654\u20131731), became Vauban's assistant and later a lieutenant-general; in 1710, he was appointed Governor of B\u00e9thune for life, while he inherited Vauban's titles and the bulk of his lands.\nLike many contemporaries, Vauban's family was deeply affected by the Huguenot rebellions of the 1620s, the Franco-Spanish War (1635\u20131659), and 1648 to 1653 Fronde. His maternal grandfather was a Catholic who married a Protestant from La Rochelle, and served Huguenot leader Admiral Coligny, while two of his uncles died in the war with Spain.\nCareer.\nIn 1643, at the age of ten, Vauban was sent to the Carmelite college in Semur-en-Auxois, where he was taught the basics of mathematics, science and geometry. This was relevant, not only for his future career but also his father's work, since the design of neo-classical gardens and fortifications both concerned managing space. These skills were commonly combined; the gardens at Blenheim Palace were laid out by John Armstrong (1674\u20131742), Marlborough's chief military engineer.\nIn 1650, Vauban joined the household of his local magnate, Louis, Grand Cond\u00e9, where he met de Montal; a close neighbour from Ni\u00e8vre, the two were colleagues for many years, and often worked together. During the 1650\u20131653 Fronde des nobles, Cond\u00e9 was arrested by the Regency Council, led by Louis XIV's mother Anne of Austria and Cardinal Mazarin. After being released in 1652, he and his supporters, among them Vauban and de Montal, went into exile in the Spanish Netherlands and allied with the Spanish. At the time, it was common for young men to follow the lead of local powerful magnates which would explain the future eagerness of the crown to offer him service in the royal army. Vauban first saw action at Clermont-en-Argonne and was noticed by Cond\u00e9 as a diligent and energetic soldier that took a keen interest in the practices of siege warfare even at such a young age and he was sometimes entrusted with directing the improvement of local fortifications.\nIn early 1653, when Vauban worked on the defences of Sainte-Menehould, one of Cond\u00e9's principal possessions, he was captured by a Royalist patrol and switched sides, serving in the force led by Louis Nicolas de Clerville that took Sainte-Menehould in November 1653. Clerville, later appointed \"Commissaire g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des fortifications\", employed him on siege operations and building fortifications. In 1655, Vauban was appointed \"Ing\u00e9nieur du Roi\" or Royal Engineer, and by the time the war with Spain ended in 1659, he was widely known as a talented engineer of energy and courage.\nUnder the terms of the Treaty of the Pyrenees, Spain ceded much of French Flanders, and Vauban was put in charge of fortifying newly acquired towns such as Dunkirk. This pattern of French territorial gains, followed by fortification of new strongpoints, was followed in the 1667\u20131668 War of Devolution, 1672\u20131678 Franco-Dutch War and 1683\u20131684 War of the Reunions.\nThe first fortification Vauban designed was the 1673 siege of Maastricht, although he was subordinate to Louis, who ranked as the senior officer present, and thus took credit for its capture. Vauban was rewarded with a large sum of money, which he used to purchase the Ch\u00e2teau de Bazouches from his cousin in 1675.\nAfter 1673, French strategy in Flanders was based on a memorandum from Vauban to Louvois, Minister of War, setting out a proposed line of fortresses known as the \"Ceinture de fer\", or \"iron belt\" (see Map). He was made \"Mar\u00e9chal de camp\" in 1676, and succeeded Clerville as \"Commissaire general des fortifications\" in 1677.\nDuring the Nine Years' War, Vauban inflicted a stinging defeat on an Anglo-Dutch invasion force at Camaret, supervised the capture of Namur in 1692, the major French achievement of the war, while the 1697 siege of Ath is often considered his offensive masterpiece. He was rewarded with money and rank: he was made Comte de Vauban, a member of the Order of the Holy Spirit and Order of Saint Louis, and an Honorary Member of the French Academy of Sciences.\nThe numbers needed to conduct a siege, and prevent interference from opponents meant armies of the Nine Years' War often exceeded 100,000 men, sizes unsustainable for pre-industrial societies. This limitation prompted a change in tactics; Marlborough argued that winning one battle was more beneficial than taking 12 fortresses. The armies of the War of the Spanish Succession averaged around 35,000, and siege warfare was superseded by a greater emphasis on mobility. \nIn 1702 Vauban was ordered by Louis to attack Hulst. He had however insufficient means available to him and so the Siege of Hulst remains the only siege in which Vauban was not successful as he was forced to retreat. The next year, Vauban directed his final siege, capturing Alt-Brisach and was promoted to Mar\u00e9chal de France, marking the end of his military career, although the \"Ceinture de fer\" proved its worth after the French defeat at Ramillies in 1706. Under pressure from superior forces on multiple fronts, France's northern border remained largely intact despite repeated efforts to break it. Capturing Lille cost the Allies 12,000 casualties and most of the 1708 campaigning season; the lack of progress between 1706 and 1712 enabled Louis to negotiate an acceptable peace at Utrecht in 1713, as opposed to the humiliating terms presented in 1707.\nWith more leisure time, Vauban developed a broader view of his role. His fortifications were designed for mutual support, so they required connecting roads, bridges and canals; garrisons needed to be fed, so he prepared maps showing the location of forges, forests and farms. Since these had to be paid for, he developed an interest in tax policy, and in 1707 published \"La D\u00eeme royale\", documenting the economic misery of the lower classes. His solution was a flat 10% tax on all agricultural and industrial output, and eliminating the exemptions which meant most of the nobility and clergy paid nothing. Although his work was confiscated and destroyed by royal decree, the use of statistics to support his arguments \"... establishes him as a founder of modern economics, and precursor of the Enlightenment's socially concerned intellectuals.\"\nIn the course of his career, Vauban supervised or designed the building of more than 300 separate fortifications. By his own estimate, he supervised more than 40 sieges from 1653 to 1697.\nPersonal life and death.\nIn 1660, Vauban married Jeanne d'Aunay d'Epiry (ca 1640\u20131705); they had two daughters, Charlotte (1661\u20131709) and Jeanne Fran\u00e7oise (1678\u20131713), as well as a short-lived infant son. He also had a long-term relationship with Marie-Antoinette de Puy-Montbrun, daughter of an exiled Huguenot officer, usually referred to as 'Mademoiselle de Villefranche.'\nVauban died in Paris on 30 March 1707; he was buried near his home in Bazoches. His grave was destroyed during the French Revolution. In 1808, Napoleon I ordered his heart reburied in Les Invalides, the resting place of many of France's most famous soldiers.\nDoctrines and legacy.\nOffensive doctrines; siege warfare.\nWhile his modern fame rests on the fortifications he built, Vauban's greatest innovations were in offensive operations, an approach he summarised as 'More powder, less blood.' Initially reliant on existing concepts, he later adapted these on lines set out in his memorandum of March 1672, \"M\u00e9moire pour servir \u00e0 l'instruction dans la conduite des si\u00e8ges\".\nIn this period, sieges became the dominant form of warfare; during the 1672\u20131678 Franco-Dutch War, three battles were fought in the Spanish Netherlands, of which only Seneffe was unrelated to a siege. Their importance was heightened by Louis XIV, who viewed them as low-risk opportunities for demonstrating his military skill and increasing his prestige; he was present at 20 of those conducted by Vauban.\nThe 'siege parallel' had been in development since the mid-16th century but Vauban brought the idea to practical fulfilment at Maastricht in 1673. Three parallel trenches were dug in front of the walls, the earth thus excavated being used to create embankments screening the attackers from defensive fire, while bringing them as close to the assault point as possible (see diagram). Artillery was moved into the trenches, allowing them to target the base of the walls at close range, with the defenders unable to depress their own guns enough to counter this; once a breach had been made, it was then stormed. This approach was used in offensive operations well into the 20th century.\nHowever, Vauban adapted his approach to the situation, and did not use the siege parallel again until Valenciennes in 1677. Always willing to challenge accepted norms, at Valenciennes, he proposed assaulting the breach during the day, rather than at night as was normal practice. He argued this would reduce casualties by surprising the defenders, and allow better co-ordination among the assault force; he was supported by Louis, and the attack proved successful.\nVauban made several innovations in the use of siege artillery, including ricochet firing, and concentrating on specific parts of the fortifications, rather than targeting multiple targets. His Dutch rival Menno van Coehoorn employed a similar approach. While the 'Van Coehoorn method' sought to overwhelm defences with massive firepower, such as the Grand Battery of 200 guns at Namur in 1695, Vauban preferred a more gradual approach. Both had their supporters; Vauban argued his was less costly in terms of casualties, but it took more time, an important consideration in an age when far more soldiers died from disease than in combat.\nDefensive doctrines; fortifications.\nIt was accepted even the strongest fortifications would fall, given time; the process was so well understood by the 1690s, betting on the length of a siege became a popular craze. As few states could afford large standing armies, defenders needed time to mobilise; to provide this, fortresses were designed to absorb the attackers' energies, similar to the use of crumple zones in modern cars. The French defence of Namur in 1695 showed \"how one could effectively win a campaign, by losing a fortress, but exhausting the besiegers.\"\nAs with the siege parallel, the strength of Vauban's defensive designs was his ability to synthesise and adapt the work of others to create a more powerful whole. His first works used the 'star-shape' or bastion fort design, also known as the \"trace Italienne\", based on the designs of Antoine de Ville (1596\u20131656) and Blaise Pagan (1603\u20131665). His subsequent 'systems' strengthened their internal works with the addition of casemated shoulders and flanks.\nThe principles of Vauban's 'second system' were set out in the 1683 work \"Le Directeur-G\u00e9n\u00e9ral des fortifications,\" and used at Landau and Mont-Royal, near Traben-Trarbach; both were advanced positions, intended as stepping-off points for French offensives into the Rhineland. Located above the Moselle, Mont-Royal had main walls high, long and space for 12,000 troops; this enormously expensive work was demolished when the French withdrew after the 1697 Treaty of Ryswick, and only the foundations remain today. Fort-Louis was another new construction, built on an island in the middle of the Rhine; this allowed Vauban to combine his defensive principles with town planning, although like Mont-Royal, little of it remains.\nThe French retreat from the Rhine after 1697 required new fortresses; Neuf-Brisach was the most significant, designed on Vauban's 'third system', and completed after his death by Louis de Cormontaigne. Using ideas from Fort-Louis, this incorporated a regular square grid street pattern inside an octagonal fortification; tenement blocks were built inside each curtain wall, strengthening the defensive walls and shielding more expensive houses from cannon fire.\nTo create a more coherent border, Vauban advocated destroying poor fortifications, and relinquishing territory that was hard to defend. In December 1672, he wrote to Louvois: \"I am not for the greater number of places, we already have too many, and please God we had half of that, but all in good condition!\"\nMany of the fortifications designed by Vauban are still standing; in 2008, twelve groups of Vauban fortifications were inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List for their exceptional engineering and influence on military fortifications from the 17th through the 20th centuries. \nInfrastructure and engineering.\nWhile often overlooked, Vauban worked on many civilian infrastructure projects, including rebuilding the ports of Brest, Dunkerque and Toulon. Since his fortifications were designed for mutual support, roads and waterways were an essential part of their design, such as the Canal de la Bruche, a canal built in 1682 to transport materials for the fortification of Strasbourg. As early as 1684, Vauban published design tables for retaining walls with heights between 3 and 25 metres. Three years later, Vauban, in his role as newly appointed Commissary General of all French fortifications, sent his engineers in the Corps du G\u00e9nie Militaire his Profil g\u00e9n\u00e9ral pour les murs de sout\u00e8nement in which he presented his retaining wall profiles that were later adopted by engineering offers such as B\u00e9lidor (1729), Poncelet (1840) and Wheeler (1870). He also provided advice on the repair and enlargement of the Canal du Midi in 1686.\nHis holistic approach to urban planning, which integrated city defences with layout and infrastructure, is most obvious at Neuf-Brisach. His legacy is recognised in the Vauban district in Freiburg, named after a French army base on the same location, which developed as a model for sustainable neighbourhoods post-1998.\nVauban's 'scientific approach' and focus on large infrastructure projects strongly influenced American military and civil engineering and inspired the creation of the US Corps of Engineers in 1824. Until 1866, West Point's curriculum was modelled on that of the French Ecole Polytechnique and designed to produce officers with skills in engineering and mathematics.\nTo ensure a steady supply of skilled engineers, in 1690 Vauban established the \"Corps royal des ing\u00e9nieurs militaires\"; until his death, candidates had to pass an examination administered by Vauban himself. Young French Huguenots made up a disproportionately high number of successful engineers due to the social and educational characteristics of French Protestantism. After the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, a significant number of these engineers joined the English and Dutch armies to fight in Ireland, Flanders and Spain. Many of his publications, including \"Trait\u00e9 de l'attaque des places\" and \"Trait\u00e9 des mines\", were written at the end of his career to provide a training curriculum for his successors.\nAssessment.\nVauban's offensive tactics remained relevant for centuries; his principles were clearly identifiable in those used by the Vi\u1ec7t Minh at Dien Bien Phu in 1954. His defensive fortifications dated far more quickly, partly due to the enormous investment required; Vauban himself estimated that in 1678, 1694 and 1705, between 40 and 45% of the French army was assigned to garrison duty.\nVauban's reputation meant his designs remained in use long after developments in artillery made them obsolete, for example the Dutch fort of Bourtange, built in 1742. The \"Corps des ing\u00e9nieurs militaires\" was based on his teachings; between 1699 and 1743, only 631 new candidates were accepted, the vast majority relatives of existing or former members. As a result, French military engineering became ultra-conservative, while many 'new' works used his designs, or professed to do so, such as those built by Louis de Cortmontaigne at Metz in 1728\u20131733. This persisted into the late 19th century; Fort de Queuleu, built in 1867 near Metz, is recognisably a Vauban-style design.\nSome French engineers continued to be innovators, notably the Marquis de Montalembert, who published \"La Fortification perpendiculaire\" in 1776, a rejection of the principles advocated by Vauban and his successors; his ideas became the prevailing orthodoxy in much of Europe but were dismissed in France.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "53288", "revid": "2666701", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53288", "title": "Araceae", "text": "Family of flowering plants\nThe Araceae are a family of monocotyledonous flowering plants in which flowers are borne on a type of inflorescence called a spadix. The spadix is usually accompanied by, and sometimes partially enclosed in, a spathe (or leaf-like bract). Also known as the arum family, members are often colloquially known as aroids. This family of 114 genera and about 3,750 known species is most diverse in the New World tropics, although also distributed in the Old World tropics and northern temperate regions.\nDescription.\nWithin the Araceae, species are often rhizomatous or tuberous; many are epiphytic, creeping lianas or vining plants, and the leaves and tissues of the entire plant nearly always contains irritating calcium oxalate crystals or raphides, in varying degrees. The foliage can vary considerably from species to species. The majority of species produce an inflorescence consisting of a spadix (which some compare to a corn cob, in appearance), which is nearly always surrounded by a modified leaf bract called a spathe. In monoecious aroids, possessing separate male and female flowers (but with both flowers present on one plant), the spadix is usually organized with female flowers towards the bottom and male flowers at the top. In aroids with perfect flowers, the stigma is no longer receptive when the pollen is released, thus preventing self-fertilization. Some species are dioecious.\nMany plants in this family are thermogenic (heat-producing). Their flowers can reach up to 45\u00a0\u00b0C, even if the surrounding air temperature is much lower. One reason for this unusually high temperature is to attract insects (usually beetles) to pollinate the plant, rewarding the beetles with heat energy, in addition to preventing tissue damage in colder regions. Some examples of thermogenic aroids are \"Symplocarpus foetidus\" (eastern skunk-cabbage),\" Amorphophallus titanum\" (titan arum),\" Amorphophallus paeoniifolius\" (elephant-foot yam), \"Helicodiceros muscivorus\" (dead-horse arum lily), and \"Sauromatum venosum\" (voodoo lily). Some species, such as \"A\". \"titanum\" and \"H\". \"muscivorus\", give off a very pungent smell akin to rotten meat, which serves to attract flies for pollination. The heat produced by the plant helps to convey the scent further.\nToxicity.\nWithin the Araceae family, the majority of species produce calcium oxalate crystals in the form of raphides. While it is possible to consume the cooked foliage of certain genera, such as \"Alocasia\", \"Colocasia\", and \"Xanthosoma\", as well as the ripened fruits of \"Monstera deliciosa\", these raphide compounds are irritating (and even dangerous) for many animals, including humans. Consumption of raw aroid vegetation may cause edema, vesicle formation or dysphagia, accompanied by a painful stinging and burning in the mouth and throat, with symptoms occurring for up to two weeks, depending on amount consumed. In smaller amounts, patients report feeling a mild to extreme sensation of sand or glass in the esophagus and mouth, lasting up to 48 hours. Additionally, in heavier instances of ingestion, anaphylactic shock could cause swelling of the throat, restricting breathing. The genus \"Dieffenbachia\" is famously known as \"dumb-cane\" for this reason; however, given the presence of irritating compounds across the family, this nickname may be applied to virtually any genera within the Araceae.\nTaxonomy.\nPhylogeny.\nPhylogeny based on the Angiosperm Phylogeny Website.\nClassification.\nOne of the earliest observations of species in the Araceae was conducted by Theophrastus in his work \"Enquiry into Plants\". The Araceae were not recognized as a distinct group of plants until the 16th century. In 1789, Antoine Laurent de Jussieu classified all climbing aroids as \"Pothos\" and all terrestrial aroids as either \"Arum\" or \"Dracontium\" in his book \"Familles des Plantes\".\nThe first major system of classification for the family was produced by Heinrich Wilhelm Schott, who published \"Genera Aroidearum\" in 1858 and \"Prodromus Systematis Aroidearum\" in 1860. Schott's system was based on floral characteristics, and used a narrow conception of a genus. Adolf Engler produced a classification in 1876, which was steadily refined up to 1920. His system is significantly different from Schott's, being based more on vegetative characters and anatomy. The two systems were to some extent rivals, with Engler's having more adherents before the advent of molecular phylogenetics brought new approaches.\nA comprehensive taxonomy of Araceae was published by Mayo et al. in 1997.\nModern studies based on gene sequences show the Araceae (including the Lemnoideae, duckweeds) to be monophyletic, and the first diverging group within the Alismatales. The APG III system of 2009 recognizes the family, including the genera formerly segregated in the Lemnaceae. The sinking of the Lemnaceae into the Araceae was not immediately universally accepted. For example, the 2010 \"New Flora of the British Isles\" used a paraphyletic Araceae and a separate Lemnaceae. However \"Lemna\" and its allies were incorporated in Araceae in the 2019 edition. A comprehensive genomic study of \"Spirodela polyrhiza\" was published in February 2014.\nGenera.\n143 genera are accepted within the Araceae. \"Anthurium\", \"Epipremnum\", \"Monstera\", \"Philodendron\" and \"Zantedeschia\" are some of the most well-known genera of the family, as are the \"Colocasia\" (taro, \"arbi\") and \"Xanthosoma\" ('elephant-ear', \u2018ape), which are both cultivated for human consumption. The largest unbranched inflorescence in the world is that of the arum \"Amorphophallus titanum\" (titan arum). \nThe Araceae includes many ornamental genera of global economic importance: \"Aglaonema\", \"Alocasia\", \"Anthurium\", \"Caladium\", \"Dieffenbachia\", \"Epipremnum\", \"Homalomena, Monstera\", \"Nephthytis\", \"Rhaphidophora\", \"Scindapsus\", \"Spathiphyllum\", \"Syngonium\", and \"Zamioculcas\", to name but a few. The aquatic genera \"Anubias\", \"Bucephalandra\" and \"Cryptocoryne\" are highly prized and cultivated aquarium plants; other, recently-described genera, such as the \"Lagenandra\" of India, are gradually becoming more known in the aquascaping world. \"Philodendron\" is an important genus in the ecosystems of neotropical rainforests, and is widely used in home and interior decorating. \"Symplocarpus foetidus\" (skunk cabbage) is a common eastern North American species. An interesting peculiarity is that this family includes the largest unbranched inflorescence, that of the titan arum, often erroneously called the \"largest flower\", and the smallest flowering plant and smallest fruit, in the duckweed, \"Wolffia\". \nFossil record.\nThe family Araceae has one of the oldest fossil record among angiosperms, with fossil forms first appearing during the Early Cretaceous epoch. Notable fossils from the Early Cretaceous include: \"Spixiarum kipea\", an aroid from the late Aptian of Brazil; \"Orontiophyllum ferreri\", an aroid leaf from the late Albian of Spain; and \"Turolospadix bogneri\", an aroid spadix from the late Albian of Spain.\nFood plants.\nFood plants in the family Araceae include \"Amorphophallus paeoniifolius\" (elephant foot yam), \"Colocasia esculenta\" (kochu, taro, dasheen), \"Xanthosoma\" (cocoyam, tannia), \"Typhonium trilobatum\" and \"Monstera deliciosa\" (Mexican breadfruit). While the aroids are little traded, and overlooked by plant breeders to the extent that the Crop Trust calls them \"orphan crops\", they are widely grown and are important in subsistence agriculture and in local markets. The main food product is the corm, which is high in starch; leaves and flowers also find culinary use.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "53289", "revid": "50841778", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53289", "title": "File Transfer Protocol", "text": "Standard protocol for transferring files over TCP/IP networks\nThe File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard communication protocol used for the transfer of computer files from a server to a client on a computer network. FTP is built on a client\u2013server model architecture using separate control and data connections between the client and the server. FTP users may authenticate themselves with a plain-text sign-in protocol, normally in the form of a username and password, but can connect anonymously if the server is configured to allow it. For secure transmission that protects the username and password, and encrypts the content, FTP is often secured with SSL/TLS (FTPS) or replaced with SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP).\nThe first FTP client applications were command-line programs developed before operating systems had graphical user interfaces, and are still shipped with most Windows, Unix, and Linux operating systems. Many dedicated FTP clients and automation utilities have since been developed for desktops, servers, mobile devices, and hardware, and FTP has been incorporated into productivity applications such as HTML editors and file managers.\nAn FTP client used to be commonly integrated in web browsers, where file servers are browsed with the URI prefix \"codice_1\". In 2021, FTP support was dropped by Google Chrome and Firefox, two major web browser vendors, due to it being superseded by the more secure SFTP and FTPS; although neither of them have implemented the newer protocols.\nHistory of FTP servers.\nThe original specification for the File Transfer Protocol was written by Abhay Bhushan and published as on 16 April 1971. Until 1980, FTP ran on NCP, the predecessor of TCP/IP. The protocol was later replaced by a TCP/IP version, (June 1980) and (October 1985), the current specification. Several proposed standards amend , for example (February 1994) enables Firewall-Friendly FTP (passive mode), (June 1997) proposes security extensions, (September 1998) adds support for IPv6 and defines a new type of passive mode.\nProtocol overview.\nCommunication and data transfer.\nFTP may run in \"active\" or \"passive\" mode, which determines how the data connection is established. (This sense of \"mode\" is different from that of the MODE command in the FTP protocol.)\nBoth modes were updated in September 1998 to support IPv6. Further changes were introduced to the passive mode at that time, updating it to \"extended passive mode\".\nThe server responds over the control connection with three-digit status codes in ASCII with an optional text message. For example, \"200\" (or \"200 OK\") means that the last command was successful. The numbers represent the code for the response and the optional text represents a human-readable explanation or request (e.g. &lt;Need account for storing file&gt;). An ongoing transfer of file data over the data connection can be aborted using an interrupt message sent over the control connection.\nFTP needs two ports (one for sending and one for receiving) because it was originally designed to operate on top of Network Control Protocol (NCP), which was a simplex protocol that utilized two port addresses, establishing two connections, for two-way communications. An odd and an even port were reserved for each application layer application or protocol. The standardization of TCP and UDP reduced the need for the use of two simplex ports for each application down to one duplex port, but the FTP protocol was never altered to only use one port, and continued using two for backwards compatibility.\nNAT and firewall traversal.\nFTP normally transfers data by having the server connect back to the client, after the PORT command is sent by the client. This is problematic for both NATs and firewalls, which do not allow connections from the Internet towards internal hosts. For NATs, an additional complication is that the representation of the IP addresses and port number in the PORT command refer to the internal host's IP address and port, rather than the public IP address and port of the NAT.\nThere are two approaches to solve this problem. One is that the FTP client and FTP server use the PASV command, which causes the data connection to be established from the FTP client to the server. This is widely used by modern FTP clients. Another approach is for the NAT to alter the values of the PORT command, using an application-level gateway for this purpose.\nData types.\nWhile transferring data over the network, five data types are defined:\nNote these data types are commonly called \"modes\", although ambiguously that word is also used to refer to active-vs-passive communication mode (see above), and the modes set by the FTP protocol MODE command (see below).\nFor text files (TYPE A and TYPE E), three different format control options are provided, to control how the file would be printed:\nThese formats were mainly relevant to line printers; most contemporary FTP clients/servers only support the default format control of N.\nFile structures.\nFile organization is specified using the STRU command. The following file structures are defined in section 3.1.1 of RFC959:\nMost contemporary FTP clients and servers only support STRU F. STRU R is still in use in mainframe and minicomputer file transfer applications.\nData transfer modes.\nData transfer can be done in any of three modes:\nMost contemporary FTP clients and servers do not implement MODE B or MODE C; FTP clients and servers for mainframe and minicomputer operating systems are the exception to that.\nSome FTP software also implements a DEFLATE-based compressed mode, sometimes called \"Mode Z\" after the command that enables it. This mode was described in an Internet Draft, but not standardized.\nGridFTP defines additional modes, MODE E and MODE X, as extensions of MODE B.\nAdditional commands.\nMore recent implementations of FTP support the \"Modify Fact: Modification Time\" (MFMT) command, which allows a client to adjust that file attribute remotely, enabling the preservation of that attribute when uploading files.\nTo retrieve a remote file timestamp, there's \"MDTM\" command. Some servers (and clients) support nonstandard syntax of the \"MDTM\" command with two arguments, that works the same way as \"MFMT\"\nLogin.\nFTP login uses normal username and password scheme for granting access. The username is sent to the server using the USER command, and the password is sent using the PASS command. This sequence is unencrypted \"on the wire\", so may be vulnerable to a network sniffing attack. If the information provided by the client is accepted by the server, the server will send a greeting to the client and the session will commence. If the server supports it, users may log in without providing login credentials, but the same server may authorize only limited access for such sessions.\nAnonymous FTP.\nA host that provides an FTP service may provide anonymous FTP access. Users typically log into the service with an 'anonymous' (lower-case and case-sensitive in some FTP servers) account when prompted for user name. Although users are commonly asked to send their email address instead of a password, no verification is actually performed on the supplied data. Many FTP hosts whose purpose is to provide software updates will allow anonymous logins.\nSoftware support.\nFile managers.\nMany file managers tend to have FTP access implemented, such as File Explorer (formerly Windows Explorer) on Microsoft Windows. This client is only recommended for small file transfers from a server, due to limitations compared to dedicated client software. It does not support SFTP.\nBoth the native file managers for KDE on Linux (Dolphin and Konqueror) support FTP as well as SFTP.\nOn Android, the My Files file manager on Samsung Galaxy has a built-in FTP and SFTP client.\nWeb browser.\nFor a long time, most common web browsers were able to retrieve files hosted on FTP servers, although not all of them had support for protocol extensions such as FTPS. When an FTP\u2014rather than an HTTP\u2014URL is supplied, the accessible contents on the remote server are presented in a manner that is similar to that used for other web content.\nGoogle Chrome removed FTP support entirely in Chrome 88, also affecting other Chromium-based browsers such as Microsoft Edge. Firefox 88 disabled FTP support by default, with Firefox 90 dropping support entirely.\nFireFTP is a discontinued browser extension that was designed as a full-featured FTP client to be run within Firefox, but when Firefox dropped support for FTP the extension developer recommended using Waterfox. Some browsers, such as the text-based Lynx, still support FTP.\nSyntax.\nFTP URL syntax is described in , taking the form: codice_2. Only the host is required.\nMore details on specifying a username and password may be found in the browsers' documentation (e.g., Firefox and Internet Explorer). By default, most web browsers use passive (PASV) mode, which more easily traverses end-user firewalls.\nSome variation has existed in how different browsers treat path resolution in cases where there is a non-root home directory for a user.\nDownload manager.\nMost common download managers can receive files hosted on FTP servers, while some of them also give the interface to retrieve the files hosted on FTP servers. DownloadStudio allows not only download a file from FTP server but also view the list of files on a FTP server.\nOther.\nLibreOffice declared its FTP support deprecated from 7.4 release, this was later removed in 24.2 release. Apache OpenOffice, another descent of OpenOffice.org, still supports FTP.\nSecurity.\nFTP was not designed to be a secure protocol, and has many security weaknesses. In May 1999, the authors of listed a vulnerability to the following problems:\nFTP does not encrypt its traffic; all transmissions are in clear text, and usernames, passwords, commands and data can be read by anyone able to perform packet capture (sniffing) on the network. This problem is common to many of the Internet Protocol specifications (such as SMTP, Telnet, POP and IMAP) that were designed prior to the creation of encryption mechanisms such as TLS or SSL.\nCommon solutions to this problem include:\nFTP over SSH.\nFTP over SSH is the practice of tunneling a normal FTP session over a Secure Shell connection. Because FTP uses multiple TCP connections (unusual for a TCP/IP protocol that is still in use), it is particularly difficult to tunnel over SSH. With many SSH clients, attempting to set up a tunnel for the control channel (the initial client-to-server connection on port 21) will protect only that channel; when data is transferred, the FTP software at either end sets up new TCP connections (data channels) and thus have no confidentiality or integrity protection.\nOtherwise, it is necessary for the SSH client software to have specific knowledge of the FTP protocol, to monitor and rewrite FTP control channel messages and autonomously open new packet forwardings for FTP data channels. Software packages that support this mode include:\nFTP over SSH should not be confused with SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP).\nDerivatives.\nFTPS.\nExplicit FTPS is an extension to the FTP standard that allows clients to request FTP sessions to be encrypted. This is done by sending the \"AUTH TLS\" command. The server has the option of allowing or denying connections that do not request TLS. This protocol extension is defined in . Implicit FTPS is an outdated standard for FTP that required the use of a SSL or TLS connection. It was specified to use different ports than plain FTP.\nSSH File Transfer Protocol.\nThe SSH file transfer protocol (chronologically the second of the two protocols abbreviated SFTP) transfers files and has a similar command set for users, but uses the Secure Shell protocol (SSH) to transfer files. Unlike FTP, it encrypts both commands and data, preventing passwords and sensitive information from being transmitted openly over the network. It cannot interoperate with FTP software, though some FTP client software offers support for the SSH file transfer protocol as well.\nTrivial File Transfer Protocol.\nTrivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) is a simple, lock-step FTP that allows a client to get a file from or put a file onto a remote host. One of its primary uses is in the early stages of booting from a local area network, because TFTP is very simple to implement. TFTP lacks security and most of the advanced features offered by more robust file transfer protocols such as File Transfer Protocol. TFTP was first standardized in 1981 and the current specification for the protocol can be found in .\nSimple File Transfer Protocol.\nSimple File Transfer Protocol (the first protocol abbreviated SFTP), as defined by , was proposed as an (unsecured) file transfer protocol with a level of complexity intermediate between TFTP and FTP. It was never widely accepted on the Internet, and is now assigned Historic status by the IETF. It runs through port 115, and often receives the initialism of \"SFTP\". It has a command set of 11 commands and support three types of data transmission: ASCII, binary and continuous. For systems with a word size that is a multiple of 8 bits, the implementation of binary and continuous is the same.

{"id": "53292", "revid": "633992", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53292", "title": "Coca", "text": "Group of plant varieties cultivated for coca and cocaine production\nCoca is any of the four cultivated plants in the family Erythroxylaceae, native to western South America. Coca is known worldwide for its psychoactive alkaloid, cocaine. Coca leaves contain cocaine which acts as a mild stimulant when chewed or consumed as tea, with slower absorption than purified cocaine and no evidence of addiction or withdrawal symptoms from natural use.\nThe coca plant is a shrub-like bush with curved branches, oval leaves featuring distinct curved lines, small yellowish-white flowers that develop into red berries. Genomic analysis reveals that coca, a culturally and economically important plant, was domesticated two or three separate times from the wild species \"Erythroxylum gracilipes\" by different South American groups during the Holocene. Chewing coca in South America began at least 8,000 years ago, as evidenced by coca leaves and calcite found in house floors in Peru's Nanchoc Valley, suggesting early communal use alongside the rise of farming. Coca use was subject to widespread use under Inca rule. The Incas deeply integrated coca into their society for labor, religion, and trade, valuing it so highly that they colonized new lands to cultivate it. Despite later Spanish attempts to suppress its use, even they relied on it to sustain enslaved laborers. Coca leaves have been traditionally used across Andean cultures for medicinal, nutritional, religious, and social purposes\u2014serving as a stimulant, remedy for ailments, spiritual tool, and source of sustenance\u2014especially through chewing and tea.\nCoca thrives in hot, humid environments, with harvesting occurring multiple times a year from plants grown in carefully tended plots. The plant is grown as a cash crop in the Argentine Northwest, Bolivia, Alto Rio Negro Territory in Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Peru, even in areas where its cultivation is unlawful. There are some reports that the plant is being cultivated in the south of Mexico, by using seeds imported from South America, as an alternative to smuggling its recreational product cocaine.\nIt also plays a fundamental role in many traditional Amazonian and Andean cultures as well as the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in northern Colombia. Coca leaves are commercially and industrially used in teas, foods, cosmetics, and beverages, with growing political and market support in countries like Bolivia and Peru, despite restrictions in others like Colombia. The international prohibition of coca leaf, established by the 1961 United Nations Single Convention despite its traditional use in Andean cultures, has been widely contested\u2014particularly by Bolivia and Peru\u2014leading to ongoing efforts, including a 2025 WHO review, to reevaluate its legal status based on cultural and scientific grounds. Coca leaf is illegal or heavily restricted in most countries outside South America, treated similarly to cocaine, with limited exceptions for scientific or medical use and a few authorized imports, such as in the U.S. for Coca-Cola flavoring.\nThe cocaine alkaloid content of dry \"Erythroxylum coca\" var. \"coca\" leaves was measured ranging from 0.23% to 0.96%. Coca-Cola used coca leaf extract in its products from 1885 until about 1903, when it began using decocainized leaf extract. Extraction of cocaine from coca requires several solvents and a chemical process known as an acid\u2013base extraction, which can fairly easily extract the alkaloids from the plant.\nDescription.\nThe coca plant resembles a blackthorn bush, and grows to a height of . The branches are curved, and the leaves are thin, opaque, oval, and taper at the extremities. A marked characteristic of the leaf is an areolated portion bounded by two longitudinal curved lines, one line on each side of the midrib, and more conspicuous on the under face of the leaf.\nThe flowers are small, and disposed in clusters on short stalks; the corolla is composed of five yellowish-white petals, the anthers are heart-shaped, and the pistil consists of three carpels united to form a three-chambered ovary. The flowers mature into red berries.\nThe leaves are sometimes eaten by the larvae of the moth \"Eloria noyesi\".\nSpecies and evolution.\nThere are two species of coca crops, each with two varieties:\nAll four of the cultivated cocas were domesticated from \"Erythroxylum gracilipes\" in pre-Columbian times, with significant archaeological sites reaching from Colombia to northern Chile, including the Las Vegas Culture in Ecuador, the Huaca Prieta site in Peru, and the Nanchoc valley in Peru \u2013 where leaf fragments and slaked lime additives have been dated to over 8,000 years before present.\nAn initial theory of the origin and evolution of the cocas by Plowman and Bohm suggested that \"Erythroxylum coca\" var. \"coca\" is ancestral, while \"Erythroxylum novogranatense\" var. \"truxillense\" is derived from it to be drought tolerant, and \"Erythroxylum novogranatense\" var. \"novogranatense\" was further derived from \"Erythroxylum novogranatense\" var. \"truxillense\" in a linear series. In addition, E. coca var. ipadu was separately derived from \"E. coca\" var. \"coca\" when plants were taken into the Amazon basin.\nGenetic evidence (Johnson et al. in 2005, Emche et al. in 2011, and Islam 2011) does not support this linear evolution. None of the four coca varieties are found in the wild, despite prior speculation by Plowman that wild populations of E. coca var. coca occur in the Hu\u00e1nuco and San Mart\u00edn provinces of Peru. Recent phylogenetic evidence shows the closest wild relatives of the coca crops are \"Erythroxylum gracilipes\" and \"Erythroxylum cataractarum\", and dense sampling of these species along with the coca crops from throughout their geographic ranges supports independent origins of domestication of \"Erythroxylum novogranatense\" and \"Erythroxylum coca\" from ancestor \"Erythroxylum gracilipes\". It is possible that Amazonian coca was produced by yet a third independent domestication event from \"Erythroxylum gracilipes\".\nThus, different early-Holocene peoples in different areas of South America independently transformed \"Erythroxylum gracilipes\" plants into quotidian stimulant and medicinal crops now collectively called coca.\nHerbicide-resistant varieties.\nAlso known as \"supercoca\" or \"la millionaria\", Boliviana negra is a relatively new form of coca that is resistant to a herbicide called glyphosate. Glyphosate is a key ingredient in the multibillion-dollar aerial coca eradication campaign undertaken by the government of Colombia with U.S. financial and military backing known as Plan Colombia.\nThe herbicide resistance of this strain has at least two possible explanations: that a \"peer-to-peer\" network of coca farmers used selective breeding to enhance this trait through tireless effort, or the plant was genetically modified in a laboratory. In 1996, a patented glyphosate-resistant soybean was marketed by Monsanto Company, suggesting that it would be possible to genetically modify coca in an analogous manner. Spraying \"Boliviana negra\" with glyphosate would serve to strengthen its growth by eliminating the non-resistant weeds surrounding it. Joshua Davis, in the \"Wired\" article cited below, found no evidence of CP4 EPSPS, a protein produced by the glyphosate-resistant soybean, suggesting \"Bolivana negra\" was either created in a lab by a different technique or bred in the field.\nDistribution and habitat.\nThe seeds are sown from December to January in small plots () sheltered from the sun, and the young plants when at in height are placed in final planting holes (), or if the ground is level, in furrows () in carefully weeded soil. The plants thrive best in hot, damp and humid locations, such as the clearings of forests; but the leaves most preferred are obtained in drier areas, on the hillsides. The leaves are gathered from plants varying in age from one and a half to upwards of forty years, but only the new fresh growth is harvested. They are considered ready for plucking when they break on being bent. The first and most abundant harvest is in March after the rainy season, the second is at the end of June, and the third in October or November. The green leaves (\"matu\") are spread in thin layers on coarse woollen cloths and dried in the sun; they are then packed in sacks, which must be kept dry in order to preserve the quality of the leaves.\nRegions.\nAccording to a 2006 report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), coca plants grow best in the humid, tropical climates and specific altitudes found in the Andean regions of South America, particularly in Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru, which together account for the vast majority of global coca cultivation\u2014and produce 99% of all cocaine worldwide.\nAs of 2023, coca cultivation has also rapidly expanded into northern Central America, in the highland areas of Honduras, Guatemala, and Belize.\nWhile regions like Taiwan and Java were prominent centers of coca leaf cultivation in Asia before World War II, their climates and soils remain highly suitable for large-scale coca production today. This historical precedent suggests that, if demand or policy ever shifted, these areas could once again support thriving coca plantations. These examples highlight that, despite their current historical status, such regions retain the biophysical capacity for renewed coca production on a significant scale.\nAfrica.\nRecords indicate that coca has been grown in the African countries of Ghana, Ivory Coast, and West Cameroon. But there is no evidence that coca became a significant or economically important crop in these countries.\nLatin America and the Caribbean.\nSouth America.\nVenezuela, once mainly a cocaine transit country, is now also producing cocaine, with coca cultivation and processing labs emerging in border and remote regions. While coca crops remain far smaller than in Colombia, their presence is growing, aided by Colombian armed groups and Venezuela's political and economic instability. The Maduro government is accused of tolerating and managing the drug trade to maintain power, while international oversight has diminished.\nAndes.\nCoca is traditionally cultivated in the lower altitudes of the eastern slopes of the Andes (the Yungas), or the highlands depending on the species grown. Coca production begins in the valleys and upper jungle regions of the Andean region, where the countries of Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia are host to more than 98 percent of the global land area planted with coca; Coca production in Colombia takes place predominantly in the departments of Putumayo, Caquet\u00e1, Meta, Guaviare, Nari\u00f1o, Antioquia, and Vichada. Bolivia's regions of Apolo, La Paz and Chapare are known for coca cultivation. Peru's primary coca growing and drug trafficking activities have been centered in the Upper Huallaga Valley since the 1980s.\nCentral America.\nIn 2014, coca plantations were discovered in Mexico, and in 2020 in Honduras, which could have major implications for the illegal cultivation of the plant.\nSince then coca production in Central America has surged dramatically. In 2022, authorities destroyed over 6.5 million coca plants in Honduras, 4 million in Guatemala, and more than half a million in southern Belize. By 2024, the number of coca plantations found and eradicated in Honduras had nearly doubled compared to the previous year, and a record number of processing labs were dismantled across the region. Unlike the Andes, where small farmers typically grow coca, cultivation in Central America is controlled by organized crime groups with backing from major foreign cartels. A 2024 study found that coca cultivation suitability increased most in northern Central America, particularly in Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador (collectively known as the Northern Triangle of Central America), and Belize. The study also reported that 47% of northern Central America\u2014limited to Honduras, Guatemala, and Belize\u2014has biophysical characteristics highly suitable for coca growing, suggesting that environmental factors are unlikely to limit the crop's spread in those countries. The latitudinal and altitudinal gradients of these countries are especially analogous to the altitudinal diversity of Colombia's coca cultivation zones, though their soils tend to fall near the upper limit of what is considered suitable for coca in Colombia.\nOther regions.\nHawaii: In December 2017, Kauai police, working with several state and federal agencies, seized 15 mature coca plants\u2014some up to six feet tall\u2014and one pound of hashish during a two-day operation in Kalalau Valley, on Kauai in the state of Hawaii. The coca plants are notable because they are the source of cocaine's active ingredient. Kauai Police Chief Darryl Perry described the operation as a success in the ongoing fight against illegal drugs on the island.\nPharmacological aspects.\nThe pharmacologically active ingredient of coca is the cocaine alkaloid, which has a concentration of about 0.3 to 1.5%, averaging 0.8%, in fresh leaves. Besides cocaine, the coca leaf contains a number of other alkaloids, including methylecgonine cinnamate, benzoylecgonine, truxilline, hydroxytropacocaine, tropacocaine, ecgonine, cuscohygrine, dihydrocuscohygrine, and hygrine. When chewed, coca acts as a mild stimulant and suppresses hunger, thirst, pain, and fatigue. Absorption of coca from the leaf is less rapid than nasal application of purified forms of the alkaloid (almost all of the coca alkaloid is absorbed within 20 minutes of nasal application, while it takes 2\u201312 hours after ingestion of the raw leaf for alkaline concentrations to peak.). When the raw leaf is consumed in tea, between 59 and 90% of the coca alkaloid is absorbed.\nCoca users ingest between 60 and 80 milligrams of cocaine each time they chew the leaves according to United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). The coca leaf, when consumed in its natural form, does not induce a physiological or psychological dependence, nor does abstinence after long-term use produce symptoms typical to substance addiction. Due to its alkaloid content and non-addictive properties, coca has been suggested as a method to help recovering cocaine addicts with tapering off the drug.\nHistory.\nTraces of coca leaves found in northern Peru dates the communal chewing of coca with slaked lime 8,000 years back. Other evidence of coca traces have been found in mummies dating 3,000 years back in northern Chile. Beginning with the Valdivian culture, c.\u20093000 BC, there is an unbroken record of coca leaf consumption by succeeding cultural groups on the coast of Ecuador until European arrival as shown in their ceramic sculpture and abundant caleros or lime pots. Lime containers found in the north coast of Peru date around 2000 BC as evidenced by the findings at Huaca Prieta and the Jetetepeque river valley. Extensive archaeological evidence for the chewing of coca leaves dates back at least to the 6th century AD Moche period, and the subsequent Inca period, based on mummies found with a supply of coca leaves, pottery depicting the characteristic cheek bulge of a coca chewer, spatulas for extracting alkali and figured bags for coca leaves and lime made from precious metals, and gold representations of coca in special gardens of the Inca in Cuzco.\nCoca chewing may originally have been limited to the eastern Andes before its introduction to the Inca. As the plant was viewed as having a divine origin, its cultivation became subject to a state monopoly and its use restricted to nobles and a few favored classes (court orators, couriers, favored public workers, and the army) by the rule of the Topa Inca (1471\u20131493). As the Incan empire declined, the leaf became more widely available. After some deliberation, Philip II of Spain issued a decree recognizing the drug as essential to the well-being of the Andean Indians but urging missionaries to end its religious use. The Spanish are believed to have effectively encouraged use of coca by an increasing majority of the population to increase their labor output and tolerance for starvation, but it is not clear that this was planned deliberately.\nAndean people first started chewing coca leaf (Ertyhroxylum) and its popularity has been spread throughout the Northern and Central Andes, making its way down to Southern Central America, including areas like Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina. The coca leaf itself includes the active cocaine alkaloid which may be released through chewing or consumed in a powder-like form. This powder is usually extracted and made from burnt plant ashes, limestone or granite, and seashells. Andean people living in Central America have used a method to withdraw the lime from the coca plant using containers with sticks and have been able to indicate whether the coca leaves were either chewed historically even though many coca leaves haven't been discovered by archaeologists. There have been numerous effects that have been noted from the coca leaf as they are milder and more concentrated compared to pure cocaine. When Andean people began to first use the coca leaf, they noticed that it could produce a \"high\" and can be very addictive compared to tobacco if consumed in large quantities. Many Andean and Inca civilizations used to chew the coca leaf instead of consuming it as it provided a better \"high\" experience. Because of its strong addiction and high, the Incas only allowed this substance within honorary celebrations and rituals. Workers dealing with rigorous tasks such as long-distance travels, and more were allowed to take the substance as it eased their hardships along the way. There is little history before Andean people and the Incas to indicate if coca was restricted before these times and what instances it was initially used in. Sometimes coca leaves from the plant were used as offerings in rituals. Due to the nature of politics and religion in the Inca Empire, wealthy inhabitants handed out coca leaves during ritual ceremonies.\nCoca was first introduced to Europe in the 16th century, but did not become popular until the mid-19th century, with the publication of an influential paper by Dr. Paolo Mantegazza praising its stimulating effects on cognition. This led to the invention of coca wine and the first production of pure cocaine. Coca wine (of which Vin Mariani was the best-known brand) and other coca-containing preparations were widely sold as patent medicines and tonics, with claims of a wide variety of health benefits. The original version of Coca-Cola was among these. These products became illegal in most countries outside of South America in the early 20th century, after the addictive nature of cocaine was widely recognized. In 1859, Albert Niemann of the University of G\u00f6ttingen became the first person to isolate the chief alkaloid of coca, which he named \"cocaine\".\nIn the early 20th century, the Dutch colony of Java became a leading exporter of coca leaf. By 1912 shipments to Amsterdam, where the leaves were processed into cocaine, reached 1000 tons, overtaking the Peruvian export market. Apart from the years of the First World War, Java remained a greater exporter of coca than Peru until the end of the 1920s. Other colonial powers also tried to grow coca (including the British in India), but with the exception of the Japanese in Formosa, these were relatively unsuccessful.\nIn recent times (2006), the governments of several South American countries, such as Peru, Bolivia and Venezuela, have defended and championed the traditional use of coca, as well as the modern uses of the leaf and its extracts in household products such as teas and toothpaste. The coca plant was also the inspiration for Bolivia's Coca Museum.\nCoca use by the Incas.\nEthnohistorical sources.\nWhile many historians are in agreement that coca was a contributing factor to the daily life of the Inca, there are many different theories as to how this civilization came to adopt it as one of its staple crops and as a valued commodity. The Incas were able to accomplish significant things while stimulated by the effects of coca. The Incas did not have a graphical written language, but used the \"quipu\", a fiber recording device. Spanish documents make it clear that coca was one of the most important elements of Inca culture. Coca was used in Inca feasts and religious rituals, among many other things. It was a driving factor in the labor efforts that Inca kings asked of their citizens, and also used to barter for other goods. Coca was vital to the Inca civilization and its culture. The Incas valued coca so much that they colonized tropical rain forests to the north and east of their capital in Cuzco so that they could increase and control their supply. The Incas colonized more humid regions because coca cannot grow above 2600 meters in elevation (coca is not frost-resistant).\nCoca use in labor and military service.\nOne of the most common uses of coca during the reign of the Inca was in the context of \"mit'a\" labor, a labor tax required of all able-bodied men in the Inca empire, and also in military service. Pedro Cieza de Le\u00f3n wrote that the indigenous people of the Andes always seemed to have coca in their mouths. \"Mit'a\" laborers, soldiers, and others chewed coca to alleviate hunger and thirst while they were working and fighting. The results of this are evident in monumental construction and the successful expansion of the Inca empire through conquest. By chewing coca, laborers and soldiers were able to work harder and for longer periods. Some historians believe that coca and \"chicha\" (fermented corn beer) made it possible for the Incas to move large stones in order to create architectural masterpieces, especially ones of monolithic construction such as Sacsayhuam\u00e1n.\nCoca use in religious rituals.\nDue to the Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire, the Spaniards had direct access to the Inca. They had insight to their everyday lives, and it is through their lens that we learn about religion in the Inca Empire. While the indigenous author Pedro Cieza de Le\u00f3n wrote about the effects coca had on the Inca, multiple Spanish men wrote about the importance of coca in their spirituality. For example Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa, Father Bernab\u00e9 Cobo, and Juan de Ulloa Mogoll\u00f3n noted how the Incas would leave coca leaves at important locations throughout the empire. They considered coca to be the highest form of plant offering that the Incas made.\nThe Incas would put coca leaves in the mouths of mummies, which were a sacred part of Inca culture. Mummies of Inca emperors were regarded for their wisdom and often consulted for important matters long after the body had deteriorated. Not only did many Inca mummies have coca leaves in their mouths, but they also carried coca leaves in bags. These are believed to be Inca sacrifices, and like the Aztecs, the Inca participated in sacrifices as well. It is clear that the Incas had a strong belief in the divinity of the coca leaf as there is now evidence that both the living and the dead were subjected to coca use. They even sent their sacrifices off to their death with a sacrificial bag of coca leaves. The coca leaf affected all stages of life for the Inca. Coca was also used in divination as ritual priests would burn a mixture of coca and llama fat and predict the future based on the appearance of the flame.\nCoca use after the Spanish invasion and colonization.\nAfter the Spanish invasion and colonization of the Inca Empire, the use of coca was restricted and appropriated by the Spaniards. By many historical accounts, the Spaniards made haphazard attempts to eradicate the coca leaf from Inca life. Although the Spaniards reported state-controlled storage facilities that the Inca had built to distribute to its workers, The Spanish allowed local communities to continue to use coca to endure the labor associated with working conditions. After seeing the effects and powers of the coca plant, many Spaniards saw another opportunity and started growing and selling coca themselves.\nTraditional uses.\nMedicine.\nTraditional medical uses of coca are foremost as a stimulant to overcome fatigue, hunger, and thirst. It is considered particularly effective against altitude sickness. It also is used as an anesthetic and analgesic to alleviate the pain of headache, rheumatism, wounds and sores, etc. Before stronger anaesthetics were available, it also was used for broken bones, childbirth, and during trepanning operations on the skull. The high calcium content in coca explains why people used it for bone fractures. Because coca constricts blood vessels, it also serves to oppose bleeding, and coca seeds were used for nosebleeds. Indigenous use of coca has also been reported as a treatment for malaria, ulcers, asthma, to improve digestion, to guard against bowel laxity, as an aphrodisiac, and credited with improving longevity. Modern studies have supported a number of these medical applications.\nNutrition.\nRaw coca leaves, chewed or consumed as tea or mate de coca, are rich in nutritional properties. Specifically, the coca plant contains essential minerals (calcium, potassium, phosphorus), vitamins (B1, B2, C, and E) and nutrients such as protein and fiber.\nReligion.\nCoca has also been a vital part of the religious cosmology of the Andean peoples of Peru, Chile, Bolivia, Ecuador, Colombia and northwest Argentina from the pre-Inca period through to the present. Coca leaves play a crucial part in offerings to the apus (mountains), Inti (the sun), or Pachamama (the earth). Coca leaves are also often read in a form of divination analogous to reading tea leaves in other cultures. As one example of the many traditional beliefs about coca, it is believed by the miners of Cerro de Pasco to soften the veins of ore, if masticated (chewed) and thrown upon them (see Cocamama in Inca mythology). In addition, coca use in shamanic rituals is well documented wherever local native populations have cultivated the plant. For example, the Tayronas of Colombia's Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta would chew the plant before engaging in extended meditation and prayer.\nChewing.\nIn Bolivia bags of coca leaves are sold in local markets and by street vendors. The activity of chewing coca is called \"mambear\", \"chacchar\" or \"acullicar\", borrowed from Quechua, \"coquear\" (Northwest Argentina), or in Bolivia, \"picchar\", derived from the Aymara language. The Spanish \"masticar\" is also frequently used, along with the slang term \"bolear,\" derived from the word \"bola\" or ball of coca pouched in the cheek while chewing. Typical coca consumption varies between 20 and 60 grams per day, and contemporary methods are believed to be unchanged from ancient times. Coca is kept in a woven pouch (\"chuspa\" or \"huallqui\"). A few leaves are chosen to form a quid \"(acullico)\" held between the mouth and gums. Doing so may cause a tingling and numbing sensation in the mouth, in similar fashion to the formerly ubiquitous dental anaesthetic novocaine (as both cocaine and novocaine belong to the amino ester class of local anesthetics).\nChewing coca leaves is most common in indigenous communities across the central Andean region, particularly in places like the highlands of Argentina, Colombia, Bolivia, and Peru, where the cultivation and consumption of coca is a part of the national culture, similar to chicha. It also serves as a powerful symbol of indigenous cultural and religious identity, amongst a diversity of indigenous nations throughout South America. Chewing plants for medicinal mostly stimulating effects has a long history throughout the world: khat in East Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, tobacco in North America, pituri in Australia, and areca nut in South/Southeast Asia and the Pacific Basin. Tobacco leaves were also traditionally chewed in the same way in North America (modern chewing tobacco is typically heavily processed). Khat chewing also has a history as a social custom dating back thousands of years analogous to the use of coca leaves.\nOne option for chewing coca is with a tiny quantity of \"ilucta\" (a preparation of the ashes of the quinoa plant) added to the coca leaves; it softens their astringent flavor and activates the alkaloids. Other names for this basifying substance are \"llipta\" in Peru and the Spanish word \"lej\u00eda\", \"bleach\" in English. The consumer carefully uses a wooden stick (formerly often a spatula of precious metal) to transfer an alkaline component into the quid without touching his flesh with the corrosive substance. The alkali component, usually kept in a gourd (\"ishcupuro\" or \"poporo\"), can be made by burning limestone to form unslaked quicklime, burning quinoa stalks, or the bark from certain trees, and may be called \"llipta\", \"tocra\" or \"mambe\" depending on its composition. Many of these materials are salty in flavor, but there are variations. The most common base in the La Paz area of Bolivia is a product known as \"lej\u00eda dulce\" (\"sweet lye\"), which is made from quinoa ashes mixed with aniseed and cane sugar, forming a soft black putty with a sweet and pleasing flavor. In some places, baking soda is used under the name \"bico\".\nIn the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, on the Caribbean Coast of Colombia, coca is consumed by the Kogi, Arhuaco, and Wiwa by using a special device called poporo. The poporo is the mark of manhood; it is regarded by men as a good companion that means \"food\", \"woman\", \"memory\", and \"meditation\". When a boy is ready to be married, his mother initiates him in the use of the coca. This act of initiation is carefully supervised by the Mamo, a traditional priest-teacher-leader.\nFresh samples of the dried leaves, uncurled, are a deep green colour on the upper surface, and a grey-green on the lower surface, and have a strong tea-like aroma. When chewed, they produce a pleasurable numbness in the mouth, and have a pleasant, pungent taste. They are traditionally chewed with slaked lime or some other reagent such as bicarbonate of soda to increase the release of the active ingredients from the leaf. Older species have a camphoraceous smell and a brownish color, and lack the pungent taste. See also \"Erythroxylum coca, and Erythroxylum novogranatense\" spp.\nYpad\u00fa is an unrefined, unconcentrated powder made from coca leaves and the ash of various other plants.\nTea.\nAlthough coca leaf chewing is common only among the indigenous populations, the consumption of coca tea (\"Mate de coca\") is common among all sectors of society in the Andean countries, especially due to their high elevations from sea level, and is widely held to be beneficial to health, mood, and energy. Coca leaf is sold packaged into teabags in most grocery stores in the region, and establishments that cater to tourists generally feature coca tea. Coca tea is legal in Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina, and Ecuador.\nCommercial and industrial uses.\nIn the Andes, commercially manufactured coca teas, granola bars, cookies, hard candies, etc. are available in most stores and supermarkets, including upscale suburban supermarkets.\nCoca is used industrially in the cosmetics and food industries. A decocainized extract of coca leaf is one of the flavoring ingredients in Coca-Cola. Before the criminalization of cocaine, however, the extract was not decocainized, and hence Coca-Cola's original formula did indeed include cocaine.\nCoca tea is produced industrially from coca leaves in South America by a number of companies, including Enaco S.A. (National Company of the Coca), a government enterprise in Peru. Coca leaves are also found in a brand of herbal liqueur called \"Agwa de Bolivia\" (grown in Bolivia and de-cocainized in Amsterdam), and a natural flavouring ingredient in Red Bull Cola, that was launched in March 2008.\nNew markets.\nCoca has figured more prominently in the politics of Bolivia and Peru in the early 21st century. President Morales asserted that \"la coca no es coca\u00edna\"\u2014the coca leaf is not cocaine. During his speech to the General Assembly of the United Nations on September 19, 2006, he held a coca leaf in his hand to demonstrate its innocuity.\nAlan Garc\u00eda, former president of Peru, has recommended its use in salads and other edible preparations. A Peruvian-based company has announced plans to market a modern version of Vin Mariani, which will be available in both natural and de-cocainized varieties.\nIn Venezuela, former president Hugo Ch\u00e1vez said in a speech in January 2008 that he chews coca every day, and that his \"hook up\" is Bolivian president Evo Morales. Ch\u00e1vez reportedly said \"I chew coca every day in the morning... and look how I am\" before showing his biceps to his audience, the Venezuelan National Assembly.\nOn the other hand, the Colombian government has recently moved in the opposite direction. For years, Bogot\u00e1 has allowed indigenous coca farmers to sell coca products, promoting the enterprise as one of the few successful commercial opportunities available to recognized tribes like the Nasa, who have grown it for years and regard it as sacred. In December 2005, the Paeces \u2013 a Tierradentro (Cauca) indigenous community \u2013 started to produce a carbonated soft drink called \"Coca Sek\". The production method belongs to the resguardos of Calderas (Inz\u00e1) and takes about of coca per 3,000 produced bottles. The drink was never sold widely in Colombia and efforts to do so ended in May 2007 when it was abruptly banned by the Colombian government.\nCoca Colla is an energy drink which is produced in Bolivia with the use of coca extract as its base. It was launched on the Bolivian markets in La Paz, Santa Cruz, and Cochabamba in mid-April 2010.\nLiterary references.\nProbably the earliest reference to coca in English literature is in \"Pomona\", the fifth book of Abraham Cowley's posthumously published Latin work, \"Plantarum libri sex\" (1668; translated as \"Six Books of Plants\" in 1689). In the series of Aubrey\u2013Maturin novels by Patrick O'Brian, set during the Napoleonic wars, Dr. Stephen Maturin, a naval physician, naturalist, and British intelligence agent discovers the use of coca leaves on a mission to Peru, and makes regular use of them in several of the later novels in the series.\nInternational prohibition of coca leaf.\nCoca leaf is the raw material for the manufacture of the drug cocaine, a powerful stimulant and anaesthetic extracted chemically from large quantities of coca leaves. Today, since it has mostly been replaced as a medical anaesthetic by synthetic analogues such as procaine, cocaine is best known as an illegal recreational drug. The cultivation, sale, and possession of unprocessed coca leaf (but not of any processed form of cocaine) is generally legal in the countries \u2013 such as Bolivia, Peru, Chile, and Argentine Northwest \u2013 where traditional use is established, although cultivation is often restricted in an attempt to control the production of cocaine. \nThe prohibition of the use of the coca leaf except for medical or scientific purposes was established by the United Nations in the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. The coca leaf is listed on Schedule I of the 1961 Single Convention together with cocaine and heroin. The Convention determined that \"The Parties shall so far as possible enforce the uprooting of all coca bushes which grow wild. They shall destroy the coca bushes if illegally cultivated\" (Article 26), and that, \"Coca leaf chewing must be abolished within twenty-five years from the coming into force of this Convention\" (Article 49, 2.e).\nThe historic rationale for international prohibition of coca leaf in the 1961 Single Convention comes from \"The Commission of Enquiry on the Coca Leaf study\" published in 1950. It was requested of the United Nations by the permanent representative of Peru, and was prepared by a commission that visited Bolivia and Peru briefly in 1949 to \"investigate the effects of chewing the coca leaf and the possibilities of limiting its production and controlling its distribution.\" It concluded that the effects of chewing coca leaves were negative, even though chewing coca was defined as a habit, not an addiction.\nThe report was sharply criticised for its arbitrariness, lack of precision, and racist connotations. The team members' professional qualifications and parallel interests were also criticised, as were the methodology used and the incomplete selection and use of existing scientific literature on the coca leaf. Questions have been raised as to whether a similar study today would pass the scrutiny and critical review to which scientific studies are routinely subjected.\nDespite the legal restriction among countries party to the international treaty, coca chewing and drinking of coca tea is carried out daily by millions of people in the Andes as well as considered sacred within indigenous cultures. Coca consumers claim that most of the information provided about the traditional use of the coca leaf and its modern adaptations is erroneous. This has made it impossible to shed light on the plant's positive aspects and its potential benefits for the physical, mental, and social health of the people who consume and cultivate it.\nIn an attempt to obtain international acceptance for the legal recognition of traditional use of coca in their respective countries, Peru and Bolivia successfully led an amendment, paragraph 2 of Article 14 into the 1988 United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, stipulating that measures to eradicate illicit cultivation and to eliminate illicit demand \"should take due account of traditional licit use, where there is historic evidence of such use.\" Bolivia also made a formal reservation to the 1988 Convention, which required countries to adopt measures to establish the use, consumption, possession, purchase or cultivation of the coca leaf for personal consumption as a criminal offence. Bolivia stated that \"the coca leaf is not, in and of itself, a narcotic drug or psychotropic substance\" and stressed that its \"legal system recognizes the ancestral nature of the licit use of the coca leaf, which, for much of Bolivia's population, dates back over centuries.\"\nHowever, the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) \u2013 the independent and quasi-judicial control organ for the implementation of the United Nations drug conventions \u2013 denied the validity of article 14 in the 1988 Convention over the requirements of the 1961 Convention, or any reservation made by parties, since it does not \"absolve a party of its rights and obligations under the other international drug control treaties.\"\nThe INCB stated in its 1994 Annual Report that \"mate de coca, which is considered harmless and legal in several countries in South America, is an illegal activity under the provisions of both the 1961 Convention and the 1988 Convention, though that was not the intention of the plenipotentiary conferences that adopted those conventions.\" It implicitly also dismissed the original report of the Commission of Enquiry on the Coca Leaf by recognizing that \"there is a need to undertake a scientific review to assess the coca-chewing habit and the drinking of coca tea.\"\nNevertheless, the INCB on other occasions did not show signs of an increased sensitivity towards the Bolivian claim on the rights of their indigenous population, and the general public, to consume the coca leaf in a traditional manner by chewing the leaf, and drinking coca tea, as \"not in line with the provisions of the 1961 Convention.\" The Board considered Bolivia, Peru and a few other countries that allow such practises to be in breach with their treaty obligations, and insisted that \"each party to the Convention should establish as a criminal offence, when committed intentionally, the possession and purchase of coca leaf for personal consumption.\"\nIn reaction to the 2007 Annual Report of the INCB, the Bolivian government announced that it would formally issue a request to the United Nations to unschedule the coca leaf of List 1 of the 1961 UN Single Convention. Bolivia led a diplomatic effort to do so beginning in March 2009, but eighteen countries out of a total of 184, those 18 being, listed chronologically: the United States, Sweden, United Kingdom, Latvia, Japan, Canada, France, Germany, Bulgaria, Slovakia, Denmark, Estonia, Italy, Mexico, Russian Federation, Malaysia, Singapore, and Ukraine, objected to the change before the January 2011 deadline. A single objection would have been sufficient to block the modification. The legally unnecessary step of supporting the change was taken formally by Spain, Ecuador, Venezuela, and Costa Rica. In June 2011, Bolivia moved to denounce the 1961 Convention over the prohibition of the coca leaf.\nAt Bolivia's initiative, organized by Colombia and Bolivia with the support of Canada, Czechia, Malta, Mexico, Switzerland and OHCHR, the World Health Organization (WHO), is conducting a 'critical review' of the coca leaf. In 2025, based on its findings, the WHO may recommend changes in coca's classification under the UN drug control treaties.\nSince the 1980s, the countries in which coca is grown have come under political and economic pressure from the United States to restrict the cultivation of the crop in order to reduce the supply of cocaine on the international market.\n of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs requires nations that allow the cultivation of coca to designate an agency to regulate said cultivation and take physical possession of the crops as soon as possible after harvest, and to destroy all coca which grows wild or is illegally cultivated. The effort to enforce these provisions, referred to as coca eradication, has involved many strategies, ranging from aerial spraying of herbicides on coca crops to assistance and incentives to encourage farmers to grow alternative crops.\nThis effort has been politically controversial, with proponents claiming that the production of cocaine is several times the amount needed to satisfy legal demand and inferring that the vast majority of the coca crop is destined for the illegal market. As per the proclaimed view, this not only contributes to the major social problem of drug abuse but also financially supports insurgent groups that collaborate with drug traffickers in some cocaine-producing territories. Critics of the effort claim that it creates hardship primarily for the coca growers, many of whom are poor and have no viable alternative way to make a living, causes environmental problems, that it is not effective in reducing the supply of cocaine, in part because cultivation can move to other areas, and that any social harm created by drug abuse is only made worse by the war on drugs. The environmental problems include \"ecocide\", where vast tracts of land and forest are sprayed with glyphosate or Roundup, with the intention of eradicating the coca plant. However, the incidental environmental damage is severe, because many plant species are wiped out in the process.\nCoca has been reintroduced to the United States as a flavoring agent in the herbal liqueur Agwa de Bolivia.\nBoliviana negra, a genetically engineered type of coca, resists glyphosate herbicides and increases yields.\nLegal status.\nThe primary organization authorized to purchase coca leaves is https://, headquartered in Peru. Outside of South America, most countries' laws make no distinction between the coca leaf and any other substance containing cocaine, so the possession of coca leaf is prohibited. In South America coca leaf is illegal in both Paraguay and Brazil.\nNetherlands.\nIn the Netherlands, coca leaf is legally in the same category as cocaine, as both are List I drugs of the Opium Law. The Opium Law specifically mentions the leaves of the plants of the genus \"Erythroxylon\". However, the possession of living plants of the genus \"Erythroxylon\" is not actively prosecuted, even though they are legally forbidden.\nUnited States.\nLike cocaine, coca is controlled under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) as a Schedule II drug meaning it is a restricted drug and is illegal to process without a prescription or a DEA registration.\nIn the United States, a Stepan Company plant in Maywood, New Jersey is a registered importer of coca leaf. The company manufactures pure cocaine for medical use and also produces a cocaine-free extract of the coca leaf, which is used as a flavoring ingredient in Coca-Cola. Other companies that have registrations with the DEA to import coca leaf according to 2011 Federal Register Notices for Importers, include Johnson Matthey, Inc, Pharmaceutical Materials; Mallinckrodt Inc; Penick Corporation; and the Research Triangle Institute. Analysts have noted the substantial importation of coca leaf into the United States, but the actual quantity is unknown because much of it is illegally imported, and there are many reports of coca leaves and coca teas being sold in the United States and being seized by the Drug Enforcement Administration throughout the States and Territories of the United States.\nCanada.\nCoca leaf is listed as a Schedule I drug (most dangerous) according to the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act of Canada (S.C. 1996, c.\u00a019) alongside Opium (Heroin) and synthetic opioid analgesics. Specifically, it lists Coca (Erythroxylon), its preparations, derivatives, alkaloids, and salts, including:(1) Coca leaves (2) Cocaine and (3) Ecgonine. Possession of a Schedule I substance is illegal and trafficking can result in punishment of up to life imprisonment.\nAustralia.\nCoca leaf is considered a Schedule 9 prohibited substance in Australia under the Poisons Standard (October 2015). A Schedule 9 substance is a substance which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of Commonwealth and/or State or Territory Health Authorities.\nIndia.\nCoca leaf is a controlled narcotic drug in India by the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 which is the principal legislation governing the subject. While its scientific and medical purposes are permissible in accordance with law, any other indulgence including cultivation, possession, sale, consumption, transportation, import, export, are prohibited.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "53293", "revid": "10202399", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53293", "title": "Tangloids", "text": "Mathematical game\nTangloids is a mathematical game for two players created by Piet Hein to model the calculus of spinors.\nA description of the game appeared in the book \"Martin Gardner's New Mathematical Diversions from Scientific American\" by Martin Gardner from 1996 in a section on the mathematics of braiding.\nTwo flat blocks of wood each pierced with three small holes are joined with three parallel strings. Each player holds one of the blocks of wood. The first player holds one block of wood still, while the other player rotates the other block of wood for two full revolutions. The plane of rotation is perpendicular to the strings when not tangled. The strings now overlap each other. Then the first player tries to untangle the strings without rotating either piece of wood. Only translations (moving the pieces without rotating) are allowed. Afterwards, the players reverse roles; whoever can untangle the strings fastest is the winner. If the game is attempted with only one initial revolution, the strings are still overlapping but cannot be untangled without rotating one of the two wooden blocks.\nThe Balinese cup trick, appearing in the Balinese candle dance, is a different illustration of the same mathematical idea. The anti-twister mechanism is a device intended to avoid such orientation entanglements. A mathematical interpretation of these ideas can be found in the article on quaternions and spatial rotation.\nMathematical articulation.\nThis game serves to clarify the notion that rotations in space have properties that cannot be intuitively explained by considering only the rotation of a single rigid object in space. The rotation of vectors does not encompass all of the properties of the abstract model of rotations given by the rotation group. The property being illustrated in this game is formally referred to in mathematics as the \"\"double covering of SO(3) by SU(2)\".\" This abstract concept can be roughly sketched as follows. \nRotations in three dimensions can be expressed as 3x3 matrices, a block of numbers, one each for x,y,z. If one considers arbitrarily tiny rotations, one is led to the conclusion that rotations form a space, in that if each rotation is thought of as a point, then there are always other nearby points, other nearby rotations that differ by only a small amount. In small neighborhoods, this collection of nearby points resembles Euclidean space. In fact, it resembles three-dimensional Euclidean space, as there are three different possible directions for infinitesimal rotations: x, y and z. This properly describes the structure of the rotation group in small neighborhoods. For sequences of large rotations, however, this model breaks down; for example, turning right and then lying down is not the same as lying down first and then turning right. Although the rotation group has the structure of 3D space on the small scale, that is not its structure on the large scale. Systems that behave like Euclidean space on the small scale, but possibly have a more complicated global structure are called manifolds. Famous examples of manifolds include the spheres: globally, they are round, but locally, they feel and look flat, ergo \"flat Earth\". \nCareful examination of the rotation group reveals that it has the structure of a 3-sphere formula_1 with opposite points identified. That means that for every rotation, there are in fact two different, distinct, polar opposite points on the 3-sphere that describe that rotation. This is what the tangloids illustrate. The illustration is actually quite clever. Imagine performing the 360 degree rotation one degree at a time, as a set of tiny steps. These steps take you on a path, on a journey on this abstract manifold, this abstract space of rotations. At the completion of this 360 degree journey, one has not arrived back home, but rather instead at the polar opposite point. And one is stuck there -- one can't actually get back to where one started until one makes another, a second journey of 360 degrees. \nThe structure of this abstract space, of a 3-sphere with polar opposites identified, is quite weird. Technically, it is a projective space. One can try to imagine taking a balloon, letting all the air out, then gluing together polar opposite points. If attempted in real life, one soon discovers it can't be done globally. Locally, for any small patch, one can accomplish the flip-and-glue steps; one just can't do this globally. (Keep in mind that the balloon is formula_2, the 2-sphere; it's not the 3-sphere of rotations.) To further simplify, one can start with formula_3, the circle, and attempt to glue together polar opposites; one still gets a failed mess. The best one can do is to draw straight lines through the origin, and then declare, by fiat, that the polar opposites are the same point. This is the basic construction of any projective space.\nThe so-called \"double covering\" refers to the idea that this gluing-together of polar opposites can be undone. This can be explained relatively simply, although it does require the introduction of some mathematical notation. The first step is to blurt out \"Lie algebra\". This is a vector space endowed with the property that two vectors can be multiplied. This arises because a tiny rotation about the \"x\"-axis followed by a tiny rotation about the \"y\"-axis is not the same as reversing the order of these two; they are different, and the difference is a tiny rotation in along the \"z\"-axis. Formally, this inequivalence can be written as formula_4, keeping in mind that \"x\", \"y\" and \"z\" are not numbers but infinitesimal rotations. They don't commute. \nOne may then ask, \"what else behaves like this?\" Well, obviously the 3D rotation matrices do; after all, the whole point is that they do correctly, perfectly mathematically describe rotations in 3D space. As it happens, though, there are also 2x2, 4x4, 5x5, ... matrices that also have this property. One may reasonably ask \"OK, so what is the shape of \"their\" manifolds?\". For the 2x2 case, the Lie algebra is called su(2) and the manifold is called SU(2), and quite curiously, the manifold of SU(2) is the 3-sphere (but without the projective identification of polar opposites). \nThis now allows one to play a bit of a trick. Take a vector formula_5 in ordinary 3D space (our physical space) and apply a rotation matrix formula_6 to it. One obtains a rotated vector formula_7. This is the result of applying an ordinary, \"common sense\" rotation to formula_8. But one also has the Pauli matrices formula_9; these are 2x2 complex matrices that have the Lie algebra property that formula_10 and so these model the formula_4 behavior of infinitesimal rotations. Consider then the product formula_12. The \"double covering\" is the property that there exists not one, but two 2x2 matrices formula_13 such that\nformula_14\nHere, formula_15 denotes the inverse of formula_13; that is, formula_17 The matrix formula_13 is an element of SU(2), and so for every matrix formula_6 in SO(3), there are two corresponding formula_13: both formula_21 and formula_22 will do the trick. These two are the polar-opposites, and the projection is just boils down to the trivial observation that formula_23 The tangeloid game is meant to illustrate that a 360 degree rotation takes one on a path from formula_21 to formula_22. This is quite precise: one can consider a sequence of small rotations formula_6 and the corresponding movement of formula_13; the result does change sign. In terms of rotation angles formula_28 the formula_6 matrix will have a formula_30 in it, but the matching formula_13 will have a formula_32 in it. Further elucidation requires actually writing out these formulas.\nThe sketch can be completed with some general remarks. First, Lie algebras are generic, and for each one, there are one or more corresponding Lie groups. In physics, 3D rotations of normal 3D objects are obviously described by the rotation group, which is a Lie group of 3x3 matrices formula_6. However, the spinors, the spin-1/2 particles, rotate according to the matrices formula_13 in SU(2). The 4x4 matrices describe the rotation of spin-3/2 particles, and the 5x5 matrices describe the rotations of spin-2 particles, and so on. The representation of Lie groups and Lie algebras are described by representation theory. The spin-1/2 representation belongs to the fundamental representation, and the spin-1 is the adjoint representation. The notion of double-covering used here is a generic phenomenon, described by covering maps. Covering maps are in turn a special case of fiber bundles. The classification of covering maps is done via homotopy theory; in this case, the formal expression of double-covering is to say that the fundamental group is formula_35 where the covering group formula_36 is just encoding the two equivalent rotations formula_21 and formula_22 above. In this sense, the rotation group provides the doorway, the key to the kingdom of vast tracts of higher mathematics.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was the fourth son (third surviving) of King Edward III, and the father of King Henry IV. Because of Gaunt's royal origin, advantageous marriages and some generous land grants, he was one of the richest men of his era and an influential figure during the reigns of both his father and his nephew, Richard II. As Duke of Lancaster, he is the founder of the royal House of Lancaster, whose members would ascend the throne after his death. His birthplace, Ghent in Flanders, then known in English as \"Gaunt\", was the origin of his name.\nJohn's early career was spent in France and Spain fighting in the Hundred Years' War. He made an abortive attempt to enforce a claim to the Crown of Castile that came through his second wife, Constance of Castile, and for a time styled himself as King of Castile. When Edward the Black Prince, Gaunt's elder brother and heir-apparent to the ageing Edward III, became incapacitated owing to poor health, Gaunt assumed control of many government functions and rose to become one of the most powerful political figures in England. He was faced with military difficulties abroad and political divisions at home, and disagreements as to how to deal with these crises led to tensions between Gaunt, the English Parliament and the ruling class, making him an unpopular figure for a time. He helped forge the 1386 Anglo-Portuguese alliance, secured through the marriage of his daughter Philippa to John I of Portugal, which endured for centuries.\nJohn exercised great influence over the English throne during the minority of King Richard II (Edward the Black Prince's son) and the ensuing periods of political strife. He mediated between the king and a group of rebellious nobles, which included Gaunt's own son and heir-apparent, Henry Bolingbroke. Following Gaunt's death in 1399, the Lancastrian estates and titles were declared forfeit to the Crown, and the now disinherited son, Bolingbroke, was branded a traitor and ordered into exile. Henry did not stay in exile; he raised an army to reclaim his inheritance and depose Richard. He reigned as King Henry IV (1399\u20131413), the first of the descendants of John of Gaunt to hold the English throne.\nJohn cultivated an extensive network of retainers, known as the \"Lancastrian affinity\", which became the cornerstone of his political power and was later inherited by his eldest surviving son, Henry, the future King Henry IV. All English monarchs from Henry IV onwards are descended from John of Gaunt. His direct male line, the House of Lancaster, ruled England from 1399 until the Wars of the Roses. Gaunt fathered additional children surnamed Beaufort, by Katherine Swynford his long-term mistress. After he married Swynford (his third marriage), his Beaufort children were later legitimised by royal and papal decrees. Through his daughter Joan Beaufort, Countess of Westmorland, he was an ancestor of the Yorkist kings Edward IV, Edward V and Richard III. Through his great-granddaughter Lady Margaret Beaufort he was also an ancestor of Henry VII, who married Edward IV's daughter Elizabeth of York, and all subsequent monarchs are descendants of their marriage. Two of John's daughters married into continental royal houses (those of Portugal and Castile). Through them, many royal families of Europe can trace lineage to him.\nEarly life.\nJohn was the son of Edward III of England and Philippa of Hainault, and was born in Ghent in Flanders, most likely at Saint Bavo's Abbey, in March 1340. The name by which he has become best known, \"of Gaunt\", was derived from an anglicised form of his birthplace, Ghent. Its use was popularised by Shakespeare in his play \"Richard II\". However, during John's lifetime, he was not referred to as this after the age of three. When he became unpopular later in life, a scurrilous rumour circulated, along with lampoons, claiming that he was actually the son of a Ghent butcher. This rumour, which infuriated him, might have been inspired by the fact that Edward III had not been present at his birth.\nJohn married his first wife, Blanche of Lancaster, in 1359 at Reading Abbey as a part of the efforts of Edward III to arrange matches for his sons with wealthy heiresses. Upon the death of his father-in-law, the Duke of Lancaster, in 1361, John received half his lands, the title \"Earl of Lancaster\", and the distinction of being the greatest landowner in Northern England as heir to the Palatinate of Lancaster. He also became the 14th Baron of Halton and 11th Lord of Bowland. John inherited the rest of the Lancaster property when Blanche's sister Maud, Countess of Leicester (married to William V, Count of Hainaut), died without issue on 10 April 1362.\nJohn received the title \"Duke of Lancaster\" from his father on 13 November 1362. By then well established, he owned at least thirty castles and estates across England and France and maintained a household comparable in scale and organisation to that of a monarch. He owned land in almost every county in England, a patrimony that produced a net income of between \u00a38,000 and \u00a310,000 a year, equivalent in 2023 to c.\u00a3170 \u2013 213 million in income value, or \u00a33.5 \u2013 4.4 billion in relation to GDP.\nEnglish Magnate.\nFirst Campaign in France.\nBecause of his rank, John of Gaunt was one of England's principal military commanders in the 1370s and 1380s, though his enterprises were never rewarded with the kind of dazzling success that had made his elder brother Edward the Black Prince such a charismatic war leader.\nOn the resumption of war with France in 1369, John was sent to Calais with Humphrey de Bohun, Earl of Hereford, and a small English army with which he raided into northern France. On 23 August, he was confronted by a much larger French army under Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy. Exercising his first command, John dared not attack such a superior force and the two armies faced each other across a marsh for several weeks until the English were reinforced by the Thomas de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, at which the French withdrew without offering battle. John and Warwick then decided to strike Harfleur, the base of the French fleet on the Seine. Further reinforced by German mercenaries, they marched on Harfleur, but were delayed by French guerilla operations while the town prepared for a siege. John invested the town for four days in October, but he was losing so many men to dysentery and bubonic plague that he decided to abandon the siege and return to Calais. During this retreat, the army had to fight its way across the Somme at the ford of Blanchetaque against a French army led by Hugh de Ch\u00e2tillon, who was captured and sold to Edward III. By the middle of November, the survivors of the sickly army returned to Calais, where the Earl of Warwick died of the plague. Though it seemed an inglorious conclusion to the campaign, John had forced the French king, Charles V, to abandon his plans to invade England that autumn.\nIn the summer of 1370, John was sent with a small army to Aquitaine to reinforce his ailing elder brother, the Black Prince, and his younger brother Edmund of Langley, Duke of York, Earl of Cambridge. With them, he participated in the Siege of Limoges (September 1370). He took charge of the siege operations and at one point engaged in hand-to-hand fighting in the undermining tunnels. After this event, the Black Prince gave John the lieutenancy of Aquitaine and sailed for England, leaving John in charge. Though he attempted to defend the duchy against French encroachment for nearly a year, lack of resources and money meant he could do little but husband what small territory the English still controlled, and he resigned the command in September 1371 and returned to England. Just before leaving Aquitaine, he married the Infanta Constance of Castile in September 1371 at Roquefort, near Bordeaux, Guyenne. The following year he took part with his father, Edward III, in an abortive attempt to invade France with a large army, which was frustrated by three months of unfavourable winds.\nProbably John's most notable feat of arms occurred in August\u2013December 1373, when he attempted to relieve Aquitaine by the landward route, leading an army of some 9,000 mounted men from Calais on a great chevauch\u00e9e from north-eastern to south-western France on a 900-kilometre raid. This four-month ride through enemy territory, evading French armies on the way, was a bold stroke that impressed contemporaries but achieved virtually nothing. Beset on all sides by French ambushes and plagued by disease and starvation, John of Gaunt and his raiders battled their way through Champagne, east of Paris, into Burgundy, across the Massif Central, and finally down into Dordogne. Unable to attack any strongly fortified forts and cities, the raiders plundered the countryside, which weakened the French infrastructure, but the military value of the damage was only temporary. Marching in winter across the Limousin plateau, with stragglers being picked off by the French, huge numbers of the army, and even larger numbers of horses, died of cold, disease or starvation. The army reached English-occupied Bordeaux on 24 December 1373, severely weakened in numbers with the loss of at least one-third of their force in action and another third to disease. Upon arrival in Bordeaux, many more succumbed to the bubonic plague that was raging in the city. Sick, demoralised and mutinous, the army was in no shape to defend Aquitaine, and soldiers began to desert. John had no funds with which to pay them, and despite his entreaties, none were sent from England, so in April 1374, he abandoned the enterprise and sailed for home.\nHead of government.\nOn his return from France in 1374, John took a more decisive and persistent role in the direction of English foreign policy. From then until 1377, he was effectively the head of the English government owing to the illness of his father and elder brother, who were unable to exercise authority. His vast estates made him the richest man in England, and his great wealth, ostentatious display of it, autocratic manner and attitudes, enormous London mansion (the Savoy Palace on the Strand) and association with the failed peace process at Bruges combined to make him the most visible target of social resentments. \nHowever, John's ascendancy to political power coincided with widespread resentment of his influence. At a time when English forces encountered setbacks in the Hundred Years' War against France, with John's efforts not viewed as being as successful as his father and brother, and Edward III's rule was becoming unpopular owing to high taxation and his affair with his mistress Alice Perrers, political opinion closely associated the Duke of Lancaster with the failing government of the 1370s. \nThe Good Parliament was called in 1376 due to shortages of government funds. It turned into a parliamentary revolution, expressing grievances at high taxation, misgovernment and corruption at court. With the Black Prince supporting reform John was isolated and the Commons managed to get the great officers of state dismissed and Alice Perrers was barred from the court. This changed with the Black Prince's death on 8 June 1376 and the onset of Edward III's last illness at the closing of the Good Parliament on 10 July left John with all the reins of power. \nJohn immediately had the ailing king grant royal pardons to all the officials impeached by the Parliament; Alice Perrers too was reinstated at the heart of the king's household. John impeached William of Wykeham and other leaders of the reform movement, and secured their conviction on old or trumped-up charges.\nThe Bad Parliament of 1377 was John's counter-coup: crucially, the Lords no longer supported the Commons and John was able to have most of the acts of 1376 annulled. He also succeeded in forcing the Commons to agree to the imposition of the first poll tax in English history\u2014a viciously regressive measure that bore hardest on the poorest members of society. \nGaunt protected the religious dissenter John Wycliffe, so staking out a more anti-clerical position than his contemporaries at least partly in order to threaten the clergy into paying higher taxes. Wycliffe believed that church wealth was damaging to the church, which coincided with Gaunt's views that church wealth could fund the government's military needs.\nRichard II's early reign.\nJohn's influence strengthened with Edward III's death in 1377 and the accession of Edward's ten-year-old son Richard II.\nThere was organised opposition to his measures and rioting in London in 1377; John of Gaunt's arms were reversed or defaced wherever they were displayed, and protestors pasted up lampoons on his supposedly dubious birth. At one point he was forced to take refuge across the Thames, while his Savoy Palace only just escaped looting. It was rumoured (and believed by many people in England and France) that he intended to seize the throne for himself and supplant the rightful heir, his nephew Richard, the son of the Black Prince, but there seems to have been no truth in this and on the death of Edward III and the accession of the child Richard II, John sought no position of regency for himself and withdrew to his estates.\nJohn's personal unpopularity persisted, however, and the failure of his expedition to Saint-Malo in 1378 did nothing for his reputation. Ultimately, some of his possessions were taken from him by the Crown. In 1380, his ship, the \"Dieulagarde\", was seized and bundled with other royal ships to be sold to pay off the debts of Sir Robert de Crull, who during the latter part of King Edward III's reign had been the \"Clerk of the King's Ships\", and had advanced monies to pay for the king's ships. During the Peasants' Revolt of 1381, John of Gaunt was far from the centre of events, on the March of Scotland, but he was among those named by the rebels as a traitor to be beheaded as soon as he could be found. The Savoy Palace was systematically destroyed by the mob and burned to the ground. Nominally friendly lords and even his own fortresses closed their gates to him, and John was forced to flee into Scotland with a handful of retainers and throw himself on the charity of King Robert II of Scotland until the crisis was over.\nSecond campaign in France.\nJohn's final campaign in France took place in 1378. He planned a 'great expedition' of mounted men in a large armada of ships to land at Brest and take control of Brittany. Not enough ships could be found to transport the horses, and the expedition was tasked with the more limited objective of capturing St. Malo. The English destroyed the shipping in St. Malo harbour and began to assault the town by land on 14 August, but John was soon hampered by the size of his army, which was unable to forage because French armies under Olivier de Clisson and Bertrand du Guesclin occupied the surrounding countryside, harrying the edges of his force. In September, the siege was simply abandoned and the army returned ingloriously to England. John of Gaunt received most of the blame for the deb\u00e2cle.\nPartly as a result of these failures, and those of other English commanders at this period, John was one of the first important figures in England to conclude that the war with France was unwinnable because of France's greater resources of wealth and manpower. He began to advocate peace negotiations; indeed, as early as 1373, during his great raid through France, he made contact with Guillaume Roger, brother and political adviser of Pope Gregory XI, to let the pope know he would be interested in a diplomatic conference under papal auspices. This approach led indirectly to the Anglo-French Congress of Bruges in 1374\u201377, which resulted in the short-lived Truce of Bruges between the two sides. John was himself a delegate to the various conferences that eventually resulted in the Truce of Leulinghem in 1389. The fact that he became identified with the attempts to make peace added to his unpopularity at a period when the majority of Englishmen believed victory would be in their grasp if only the French could be defeated decisively as they had been in the 1350s. Another motive was John's conviction that it was only by making peace with France would it be possible to release sufficient manpower to enforce his claim to the throne of Castile.\nPeasant's Revolt.\nAs \"de facto\" ruler during Richard's minority, he made unwise decisions on taxation that led to the Peasants' Revolt in 1381, when the rebels destroyed his home in London, the Savoy Palace. Some of the rebels suspected John of wanting to seize the throne himself, with rebels swearing \"that they would accept no king called John\", although he took pains to ensure that he never became associated with the opposition to Richard's kingship. Unlike some of Richard's unpopular advisors, John was away from London at the time of the uprising and thus avoided the direct wrath of the rebels.\nRehabilitation.\nIn 1386 John left England to seek the throne of Castile, claimed in \"jure uxoris\" by right of his second wife, Constance of Castile, whom he had married in 1371. However, crisis ensued almost immediately in his absence, and in 1387 King Richard's misrule brought England to the brink of civil war. John had to give up on his ambitions in Spain and hurry back to England in 1389. Only John's intervention in the political crisis succeeded in persuading the Lords Appellant and King Richard to compromise to usher in a period of relative stability. During the 1390s, John's reputation of devotion to the well-being of the kingdom was largely restored.\nKing of Castile.\nUpon his marriage to Constance of Castile in 1371, John assumed (officially from 29 January 1372) the title of King of Castile and Le\u00f3n in right of his wife, and insisted his fellow English nobles henceforth address him as \"my lord of Spain\". John gathered around himself a small court of refugee Castilian knights and set up a Castilian chancery that prepared documents in his name. His claim to the Castilan throne strongly influenced Gaunt's views on foreign policy. He hatched several schemes to make good his claim, but for many years these were still-born owing to lack of finance or the conflicting claims of war in France or with Scotland.\nIt was not until 1386, after Portugal's new King John I had entered into an alliance with England, that he was actually able to land with an army in Spain. John's Anglo-Portuguese fleet sailed from England in 1386, pausing to drive off the French forces who were then besieging Brest, he landed at Corunna in northern Spain on 29 July.\nThe Castilian king, John of Trast\u00e1mara, had concentrated his forces on the Portuguese border but was wrong-footed by John's decision to invade Galicia setting up a rudimentary court and chancery at Ourense and receiving the submission of the Galician nobility and most of the towns. The Castilians were in no hurry to fight and Gaunt began had difficulties paying his army.\nIn November, Gaunt and John of Portugal concluded an agreement for a joint Anglo-Portuguese invasion of central Castile early in 1387 sealed by the marriage of John's eldest daughter Philippa to the Portuguese king. As much of John's army fell sick they were far outnumbered by their Portuguese allies by the time of the invasion in April\u2013June 1387 which failed as the Castilians avoided battle and the invaders were reduced to foraging for food in the arid Spanish landscape while being harried by French mercenaries. Gaunt lost a number of retainers and close friends to disease or exhaustion, while many of his troops abandoned the army to ride north under French safe conducts. Shortly after the army returned to Portugal, John of Gaunt concluded a secret treaty with John of Trast\u00e1mara under which he renounced all claims to the throne in return for a large annual payment and the marriage of his daughter Catherine to John of Trast\u00e1mara's son, Henry.\nDuke of Aquitaine.\nJohn left Portugal for Aquitaine, and he remained in that province until he returned to England in November 1389. This effectively kept him off the scene while England endured the major political crisis of the conflict between Richard II and the Lords Appellant, who were led by John of Gaunt's younger brother Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester. Only four months after his return to England, in March 1390, Richard II formally invested Gaunt with the Duchy of Aquitaine, thus providing him with the overseas territory he had long desired. However, he did not immediately return to the province, but remained in England and mainly ruled through seneschals as an absentee duke. His administration of the province was a disappointment, and his appointment as duke was much resented by the Gascons, since Aquitaine had previously always been held directly by the king of England or his heir; it was not felt to be a fief that a king could bestow on a subordinate.\nFrom 1394 through 1395, he was forced to spend nearly a year in Gascony to shore up his position in the face of threats of secession by the Gascon nobles. He was one of England's principal negotiators in the diplomatic exchanges with France in 1396, and he initially agreed to join the French-led Crusade that ended in the disastrous Battle of Nicopolis, but withdrew because of ill-health and the political problems in Gascony and England.\nFor the remainder of his life, John of Gaunt occupied the role of valued counsellor of the king and loyal supporter of the Crown. He did not even protest, it seems, when his younger brother Thomas was murdered at Richard's behest. It may be that he felt he had to maintain this posture of loyalty to protect his son Henry Bolingbroke (the future Henry IV), who had also been one of the Lords Appellant, from Richard's wrath; but, in 1398, Richard had Bolingbroke exiled, and on John of Gaunt's death the next year he disinherited Bolingbroke completely, seizing John's vast estates for the Crown.\nRelationship with Geoffrey Chaucer.\nJohn of Gaunt was a patron and close friend of the poet Geoffrey Chaucer, best known for his work \"The Canterbury Tales\". Near the end of their lives, Lancaster and Chaucer became brothers-in-law. Chaucer married Philippa (Pan) de Roet in 1366, and Lancaster took his mistress of nearly 30 years, Katherine Swynford (de Roet), who was Philippa Chaucer's sister, as his third wife in 1396. Although Philippa died c.\u20091387, the men were bound as brothers and Lancaster's children by Katherine\u2014John, Henry, Thomas and Joan Beaufort\u2014were Chaucer's nephews and niece.\nChaucer's \"The Book of the Duchess\", also known as the \"Deeth of Blaunche the Duchesse\", was written in commemoration of Blanche of Lancaster, John of Gaunt's first wife. The poem refers to John and Blanche in allegory as the narrator relates the tale of \"A long castel with walles white/Be Seynt Johan, on a ryche hil\" (1318\u20131319) who is mourning grievously after the death of his love, \"And goode faire White she het/That was my lady name ryght\" (948\u2013949). The phrase \"long castel\" is a reference to Lancaster (also called \"Loncastel\" and \"Longcastell\"), \"walles white\" is thought to likely be an oblique reference to Blanche, \"Seynt Johan\" was John of Gaunt's name-saint, and \"ryche hil\" is a reference to Richmond; these thinly veiled references reveal the identity of the grieving black knight of the poem as John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster and Earl of Richmond. \"White\" is the English translation of the French word \"blanche\", implying that the white lady was Blanche of Lancaster.\nBelieved to have been written in the 1390s, Chaucer's short poem \"Fortune\", is also inferred to directly reference Lancaster. \"Chaucer as narrator\" openly defies \"Fortune\", proclaiming he has learned who his enemies are through her tyranny and deceit, and declares \"my suffisaunce\" (15) and that \"over himself hath the maystrye\" (14). \"Fortune\", in turn, does not understand Chaucer's harsh words to her for she believes she has been kind to him, claims that he does not know what she has in store for him in the future, but most importantly, \"And eek thou hast thy beste frend alyve\" (32, 40, 48). Chaucer retorts that \"My frend maystow nat reven, blind goddesse\" (50) and orders her to take away those who merely pretend to be his friends. \"Fortune\" turns her attention to three princes whom she implores to relieve Chaucer of his pain and \"Preyeth his beste frend of his noblesse/That to som beter estat he may atteyne\" (78\u201379). The three princes are believed to represent the dukes of Lancaster, York, and Gloucester, and a portion of line 76, \"as three of you or tweyne,\" to refer to the ordinance of 1390 which specified that no royal gift could be authorised without the consent of at least two of the three dukes. Most conspicuous in this short poem is the number of references to Chaucer's \"beste frend\". \"Fortune\" states three times in her response to the plaintiff, \"And also, you still have your best friend alive\" (32, 40, 48); she also references his \"beste frend\" in the envoy when appealing to his \"noblesse\" to help Chaucer to a higher estate. A fifth reference is made by \"Chaucer as narrator\" who rails at \"Fortune\" that she shall not take his friend from him. While the envoy playfully hints to Lancaster that Chaucer would certainly appreciate a boost to his status or income, the poem \"Fortune\" distinctively shows his deep appreciation and affection for John of Gaunt.\nDeath.\nJohn of Gaunt died of natural causes on 3 February 1399 at Leicester Castle, with his third wife Katherine by his side.\nHe was buried beside his first wife, Blanche of Lancaster, in the choir of St Paul's Cathedral, adjacent to the high altar. Their magnificent tomb had been designed and executed between 1374 and 1380 by Henry Yevele with the assistance of Thomas Wrek, at a total cost of \u00a3592. The two alabaster effigies were notable for having their right hands joined. An adjacent chantry chapel was added between 1399 and 1403. During the reformation when other stonework in the cathedral was taken down in 1552, the tomb was spared by a command of the council, but was stripped plain. During the period of the Interregnum (1649\u20131660) it was severely damaged, and perhaps destroyed; anything that survived was lost (with the rest of the cathedral) in the Great Fire of London of 1666. A wall memorial in the crypt of the present cathedral lists Gaunt's as among the important lost monuments.\nFamily.\nMarriages.\nOn 19 May 1359 at Reading Abbey, John married his third cousin, Blanche of Lancaster, younger of the two daughters of Henry of Grosmont, Duke of Lancaster. Both shared a common descent as great-great-grandchildren from King Henry III. The wealth she brought to the marriage was the foundation of John's fortune. Blanche died on 12 September 1368 at Tutbury Castle, shortly after the birth of her last child while her husband was overseas. Of their seven children only three survived to adulthood.\nTheir son Henry Bolingbroke became Henry IV of England, having deposed King Richard II, who had seized the duchy of Lancaster upon John's death while Henry was in exile. Their daughter Philippa of Lancaster became Queen of Portugal by marrying King John I of Portugal in 1387. All subsequent kings of Portugal beginning from the House of Aviz were thus descended from John of Gaunt. Philippa's daughter Isabella, married Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy. Their lone heiress, Mary, the only child of Philip's only legitimate son Charles the Bold, married her 2nd cousin, Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I, whose mother Eleanor, was the daughter of Philippa's son Edward. Their grandson Charles married Isabella, daughter of Manuel I of Portugal, a male line grandson of Edward.\nIn 1371, John married Infanta Constance of Castile, daughter of King Peter of Castile, thus giving him a claim to the Crown of Castile, which he would pursue. Constance died in 1394. Though John was never able to make good his claim, his daughter by Constance, Catherine of Lancaster, became Queen of Castile by marrying Henry III of Castile. Catherine of Aragon and Joanna of Castile were descended from Catherine through their mother Isabella I, daughter of Catherine's son John II. Isabella I was also a descendant of Catherine's half-sister Philippa, through her mother Isabella, who was the daughter of Philippa's other son John. Hence the House of Hapsburg is also related to John of Gaunt.\nDuring his second marriage, some time around 1373 (the approximate birth year of their eldest son, John Beaufort) John of Gaunt entered into an extra-marital love affair with Katherine Swynford (born de Roet), the daughter of an ordinary knight (Sir Paon de Roet), which would produce four children for the couple. All of them were born out of wedlock, but were legitimised upon their parents' eventual marriage. The adulterous relationship endured until 1381, when it was ended out of political necessity. Prior to her widowhood, Katherine had had at least two children with her husband, Sir Hugh Swynford from Kettlethorpe in Lincolnshire. These were Blanche, for whom John of Gaunt stood as godfather, and Thomas, later Sir Thomas. \nOn 13 January 1396, two years after the death of Constance of Castile, Katherine and John of Gaunt married in Lincoln Cathedral. Their children were given the surname \"Beaufort\" after a former French possession of the duke. The Beaufort children, three sons and a daughter, were legitimised by royal and papal decrees after John and Katherine married. From the eldest son, John, descended a granddaughter, Lady Margaret Beaufort, whose son, later King Henry VII of England, would nevertheless claim the throne.\nA later proviso to the legitimation of the Beaufort children was that they were specifically barred from inheriting the throne\u2014the phrase \"\" (\"except royal status\")\u2014was inserted with dubious authority by their half-brother Henry IV. However, as historian and author Nathen Amin points out there was no parliamentary ratification of this scribbled in amendment. Further testing and analysis on these three words is required to determine when exactly they were added. There is every possibility they were added as a later proviso during the height of the Wars of the Roses as a means to discredit any heirs of Margaret Beaufort.\nTitles and arms.\nArms.\nAs a son of the sovereign, John bore the royal arms of the kingdom (\"Quarterly, France Ancient and England\"), differenced by a label of three points ermine.\nAs claimant to the throne of Castile and Le\u00f3n from 1372, he impaled the arms of that kingdom (\"Gules, a castle or, quartering Argent, a lion rampant purpure\") with his own. The arms of Castile and Le\u00f3n appeared on the dexter side of the shield (the left-hand side as viewed), and the differenced English royal arms on the sinister; but in 1388, when he surrendered his claim, he reversed this marshalling, placing his own arms on the dexter, and those of Castile and Le\u00f3n on the sinister. He thus continued to signal his alliance with the Castilian royal house, while abandoning any claim to the throne. There is, however, evidence that he may occasionally have used this second marshalling at earlier dates.\nIn addition to his royal arms, Gaunt bore an alternative coat of \"Sable, three ostrich feathers ermine\". This was the counterpart to his brother, the Black Prince's, \"shield for peace\" (on which the ostrich feathers were white), and may have been used in jousting. The ostrich feather arms appeared in stained glass above Gaunt's chantry chapel in St Paul's Cathedral.\nLegacy.\nJohn of Gaunt is a character in William Shakespeare's play \"Richard II\". Shortly before he dies, he makes a speech that includes the lines (in Act 2, scene i, around line 40) \"This royal throne of kings, this scepter'd isle, This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars ... This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England\". He is also referred to by Falstaff in \"Henry IV Part I\" (in Act 2, scene ii).\nHungerford in Berkshire has ancient links to the Duchy, the manor becoming part of John of Gaunt's estate in 1362 before James I passed ownership to two local men in 1612 (which subsequently became Town &amp; Manor of Hungerford Charity). The links are visible today in the Town &amp; Manor-owned John O'Gaunt Inn on Bridge Street, and John O'Gaunt School on Priory Road.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "53295", "revid": "50655340", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53295", "title": "Lincolnshire", "text": "County of England\nLincolnshire () is a ceremonial county in the East Midlands and Yorkshire and the Humber regions of England. It is bordered by the East Riding of Yorkshire across the Humber estuary to the north, the North Sea to the east, Norfolk, Cambridgeshire, Northamptonshire and Rutland to the south, and Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire and South Yorkshire to the west.\nThe county is predominantly rural, with an area of and a population of 1,120,749 in 2024. The port town of Grimsby is located in the north-east coast of the county, Boston in the south-east, Grantham in the south-west, the city of Lincoln in the west, and Scunthorpe in the north-west. For local government purposes Lincolnshire comprises a non-metropolitan county, with seven districts, and the unitary authority areas of North Lincolnshire and North East Lincolnshire. The last two areas are part of the Yorkshire and the Humber region, and the rest of the county is in the East Midlands. The non-metropolitan county council and two unitary councils collaborate through the Greater Lincolnshire Combined County Authority.\nThe county is the second largest in England and has a varied geography. The south-east contains part of the Fens, a naturally marshy region which has been drained for agriculture, and the south-west is an upland region. A wide vale runs north\u2013south from the centre to the north of the county. To its east, the chalk hills of the Lincolnshire Wolds, which have been designated a national landscape, occupy the north-east, with a coastal plain and the Lincolnshire Marsh beyond. The west of the vale is demarcated by the Lincolnshire Edge, a long escarpment; at its northern end are the Coversands, an area of heath. Beyond the edge, the western border of the county contains the eastern part of the Trent Valley and, in the north, part of the Humberhead Levels, with the River Trent itself forming part of the border.\nLincolnshire has had a comparatively quiet history, being a rural county which was not heavily industrialised and faced little threat of invasion. In the Roman era Lincoln was a major settlement, called Lindum Colonia. In the fifth century what would become the county was settled by the invading Angles, who established the Kingdom of Lindsey in the north of the region. Lincoln became the centre of a diocese in 1072, and Lincoln Cathedral was built over the following centuries. The late Middle Ages were a particularly prosperous period, when wealth from wool trade facilitated the building of grand churches such as St Botolph's Church, Boston. During the Second World War the relatively flat topography of the county made it an important base for the Royal Air Force, which built several airfields and based two bomber squadrons in the area.\nHistory.\nDuring pre-Roman times, most of Lincolnshire was inhabited by the Corieltauvi people. The language of the area at that time would have been Common Brittonic, the precursor to modern Welsh, Cornish and Breton. The name \"Lincoln\" was derived from .\nLarge numbers of Germanic speakers from continental Europe settled in the region following the withdrawal of the Romans. Though these were later identified as Angles, it is unlikely that they migrated as part of an organized tribal group. Thus, the main language of the region quickly became Old English. However, it is possible that Brittonic continued to be spoken in some communities as late as the eighth century.\nModern-day Lincolnshire is derived from the merging of the territory of the Kingdom of Lindsey with that controlled by the Danelaw borough of Stamford. For some time the entire county was called \"Lindsey\", and it is recorded as such in the 11th-century \"Domesday Book.\" Later, the name Lindsey was applied to the northern core, around Lincoln. This emerged as one of the three Parts of Lincolnshire, along with the Parts of Holland in the south-east, and the Parts of Kesteven in the south-west, which each had separate Quarter Sessions as their county administrations. Lindsay was traditionally split between the North, South and West Ridings of Lindsey.\nThe area was shaken by 27 February 2008 Lincolnshire earthquake, reaching between 4.7 and 5.3 on the Richter magnitude scale; it was one of the largest earthquakes to affect Britain in recent years.\nLincolnshire is home to Woolsthorpe Manor, birthplace and home of Sir Isaac Newton. He attended The King's School, Grantham. Its library has preserved his signature, carved into a window sill when he was a youth.\nGeography.\nThe geographical layout of Lincolnshire is quite extensive and mostly separated by many rivers and rolling countryside. The north of the county begins from where the Isle of Axholme is located near the meeting points of the rivers Ouse and Trent near to the Humber. From there, the southside of the Humber estuary forms the border between Lincolnshire and the East Riding of Yorkshire. From there, the south bank of the Humber Estuary where the Humber Bridge crosses the estuary at Barton upon Humber, is used primarily for the shipping ports at Immingham, New Holland and Grimsby. From there, the rest of the southern bank forms the Lincolnshire Coast from Cleethorpes to Mablethorpe and then onto Skegness. From Skegness, the rest of the Lincolnshire Coastline forms the sea boundary and border with Norfolk at the Wash. The coast then at Boston becomes the meeting point of the rivers Welland and Haven in an area known as the \"Fosdyke Wash\".\nThe rest of the sea boundary runs from Fosdyke to the east of Sutton Bridge, where the current land boundary with Norfolk is located in a narrow area of reclaimed farmland just to the east of the River Nene but until as recently as the early 19th century there was no land border between Lincolnshire and Norfolk as it was separated from each other by the \"Cross Keys Wash\" a former area of estuary and marshland where the River Nene used to flow out into the Wash and could only be crossed at low tide by a causeway or ferry and was the natural boundary between the two counties. The causeway known at the time as the \"Wash Way\" was renowned as being particularly treacherous and the safer route was to go into Norfolk from Lincolnshire via the Cambridgeshire town of Wisbech and this element remains to the present day as the Cross Keys Bridge at Sutton Bridge provides the only direct access point to Norfolk from Lincolnshire over the River Nene some nine miles north of Wisbech. The border with Lincolnshire to Cambridgeshire begins at Crowland, Market Deeping and Stamford which form the southern boundary of the county with both Peterborough, Rutland and briefly Northamptonshire; the county's border with Northamptonshire is just long, England's shortest county boundary. From there, the border with Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire begins at Sleaford, Grantham, Lincoln and Gainsborough. From Gainsborough, the border with South Yorkshire begins at Haxey and Epworth before looping back to the original north of the county near Scunthorpe with East Riding of Yorkshire at the Isle of Axholme and Goole.\nBedrock in Lincolnshire features Jurassic limestone (near Lincoln) and Cretaceous chalk (north-east). The area around Woodhall Spa and Kirkby on Bain is dominated by gravel and sand. For much of prehistory, Lincolnshire was under tropical seas, and most fossils found in the county are marine invertebrates. Marine vertebrates have also been found including ichthyosaurus and plesiosaur.\nThe highest point in Lincolnshire is Wolds Top (), at Normanby le Wold. Some parts of the Fens may be below sea level. The nearest mountains are in Derbyshire.\nThe biggest rivers in Lincolnshire are the Trent, running northwards from Staffordshire up the western edge of the county to the Humber estuary, and the Witham, which begins in Lincolnshire at South Witham and runs for through the middle of the county, eventually emptying into the North Sea at The Wash. The Humber estuary, on Lincolnshire's northern border, is also fed by the River Ouse. The Wash is also the mouth of the Welland, the Nene and the Great Ouse.\nLincolnshire's geography is fairly varied, but consists of several distinct areas:\nLincolnshire's most well-known nature reserves include Gibraltar Point National Nature Reserve, Whisby Nature Park Local Nature Reserve, Donna Nook National Nature Reserve, RSPB Frampton Marsh and the Humberhead Peatlands National Nature Reserve. Although the Lincolnshire countryside is intensively farmed, there are many biodiverse wetland areas, as well as rare limewood forests. Much of the county was once wet fenland (see The Fens).\nFrom bones, we can tell that animal species formerly found in Lincolnshire include woolly mammoth, woolly rhinoceros, wild horse, wolf, wild boar and beaver. Species which have recently returned to Lincolnshire after extirpation include little egret, Eurasian spoonbill, European otter and red kite.\nGovernance.\nLocal government history.\nThe Local Government Act 1888 established county councils for each of the parts of Lincolnshire \u2013 Lindsey, Holland and Kesteven \u2013 and came into effect on 1 April 1889. Lincoln was made an independent county borough on the same date, with Grimsby following in 1891.\nThe Local Government Act 1972 abolished the three county councils and the two county boroughs, effective 1 April 1974. On this date, Grimsby and the northern part of Lindsey (including Scunthorpe) were amalgamated with most of the East Riding of Yorkshire and a part of the West Riding of Yorkshire to form the new non-metropolitan county of Humberside. The rest of Lindsey, along with Holland, Kesteven and Lincoln, came under the governance of the new Lincolnshire County Council.\nA local government reform in 1996 abolished Humberside. The land south of the Humber Estuary was allocated to the unitary authorities of North Lincolnshire and North East Lincolnshire which became part of Lincolnshire for ceremonial purposes, such as the Lord-Lieutenancy, but are not covered by the Lincolnshire police; they are in the Yorkshire and the Humber region.\nThe remaining districts of Lincolnshire are Boston, East Lindsey, Lincoln, North Kesteven, South Holland, South Kesteven, and West Lindsey. They are part of the East Midlands region.\nNorth East Lincolnshire and North Lincolnshire are unitary authorities. They were districts of Humberside county from 1974. In 1996, Humberside was abolished along with its county council. Some services in those districts are shared with the East Riding of Yorkshire ceremonial county, rather than the rest of Lincolnshire including Humberside Police, Humberside Airport, Humberside Fire Service, and BBC Radio Humberside.\nCurrent governance.\nSince the 2024 general election and the constituency reorganisation by the 2023 Periodic Review, Lincolnshire is represented by ten Members of Parliament (MPs) whose constituencies fall entirely within the county. Small areas of Lincolnshire form constituencies with parts of neighbouring counties, namely the Isle of Axholme (part of Doncaster East and the Isle of Axholme) and the town of Stamford and its surroundings (part of Rutland and Stamford). Of the ten constituencies entirely within Lincolnshire, six are represented by the Conservative Party, three by the Labour Party and one by Reform UK.\nLincolnshire County Council is majority controlled by Reform UK and consists of forty-four Reform UK councillors, fourteen Conservative, five Liberal Democrats, three Labour, three independents, and one Lincolnshire Independent. The county is made up of seven local borough and district councils and two unitary authority areas independent of the county council. The City of Lincoln Council is Labour-controlled. North Kesteven, South Holland and East Lindsey are administered by the Conservatives. South Kesteven is controlled by a coalition of independent, Labour Party, Green Party and Liberal Democrat councillors. West Lindsey is controlled by a coalition of Liberal Democrats and independents. The Borough of Boston is controlled by the local Boston Independent party. The unitary authority North Lincolnshire and North East Lincolnshire councils are administered by the Conservative Party.\nA mayoral devolution deal has received approval from the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government. This led to the establishment of a Greater Lincolnshire Combined County Authority, formed of the county council, the two unitary authorities and the district councils, with powers over housing, job creation and public transport, including bus franchising. The first election for the Mayor of Greater Lincolnshire, who will chair GLCCA, took place in May 2025. Reform UK Andrea Jenkyns was elected and Reform UK took control of Lincolnshire County Council.\nCentral Lincolnshire.\nThe Central Lincolnshire area is a joint partnership arrangement between North Kesteven, Lincoln and West Lindsey, covering economic planning and development across the three districts.\nProposed local government reorganisation.\nSeparate to the newly established devolution deal for Greater Lincolnshire three separate proposals for the future governance of Lincolnshire were published in March 2025. Option One would see a single council for the area that currently makes up Lincolnshire County Council and a merger of the current two unitary authorities of North Lincolnshire and North East Lincolnshire in the north of the county to make a single council. Option Two would see Lincolnshire split into two separate unitary authorities on a north/south basis with North Lincolnshire, North East Lincolnshire, East and West Lindsey making up the northern council area whilst Lincoln, North and South Kesteven, Boston and South Holland making up the southern council area. Option Three would see Lincolnshire split up into three council areas, one covering Lincoln, West Lindsey, North Kesteven and South Kesteven, the second covering East Lindsey, Boston and South Holland and the third covering North Lincolnshire and North East Lincolnshire.\nDemography.\nThe following tables show the ethnic and religious composition of Lincolnshire in 2021:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;a includes hunting and forestry\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;b includes energy and construction\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;c includes financial intermediation services indirectly measured\nEconomy.\nNotable businesses based in Lincolnshire include the Lincs FM Group, Young's Seafood, Openfield and the Lincolnshire Co-operative (whose membership includes about one quarter of the population of the county).\nAgriculture.\nLincolnshire has long been a primarily agricultural area, and it continues to grow large amounts of wheat, barley, sugar beet, and oilseed rape. In south Lincolnshire, where the soil is particularly rich in nutrients, some of the most common crops include potatoes, cabbages, cauliflowers, and onions. Lincolnshire farmers often break world records for crop yields. South Lincolnshire is also home to one of the UK's leading agricultural experiment stations, located in Sutton Bridge and operated by the Potato Council; Sutton Bridge Crop Storage Research engages in research for the British potato industry.\nThe Lincoln Longwool is a rare breed of sheep, named after the region, which was developed both for wool and mutton, at least 500 years ago, and has the longest fleece of any sheep breed. The Lincoln Red is an old breed of beef cattle, originating from the county. In the mid 20th\u00a0century most farms in Lincolnshire moved away from mixed farming to specialise in arable cropping, partly due to cheap wool imports, partly to take advantage of efficiencies of scale and partly because the drier land on the eastern side of England is particularly suitable for arable cropping.\nMechanisation around 1900 greatly diminished the number of workers required to operate the county's relatively large farms, and the proportion of workers in the agricultural sector dropped substantially during this period. Several major engineering companies developed in Lincoln, Gainsborough and Grantham to support those changes. Among these was Fosters of Lincoln, which built the first tank, and Richard Hornsby &amp; Sons of Grantham. Most such industrial companies left during late 20th-century restructuring.\nToday, immigrant workers, mainly from new member states of the European Union in Central and Eastern Europe, form a large component of the seasonal agricultural workforce, particularly in the south of the county. Here more labour-intensive crops are produced, such as small vegetables and cut flowers. This seasonal influx of migrant labour occasionally causes tension between the migrant workforce and local people, in a county which had been relatively unaccustomed to large-scale immigration. Agricultural training is provided at Riseholme College and in 2016 the University of Lincoln opened the Lincoln Institute for Agri-Food Technology.\nServices and retail.\nAccording to an Intra-governmental Group on Geographic Information (IGGI) study in 2000, the town centres were ranked by area thus (including North Lincolnshire and North East Lincolnshire areas):\nPublic services.\nEducation.\nLincolnshire is one of the few counties in the UK that still uses the eleven-plus to decide who may attend grammar school. As a result, many towns in Lincolnshire have both a grammar school and a secondary modern school. Lincolnshire's rural character means that some larger villages also have primary schools and are served by buses to nearby high schools.\nLincoln itself, however, is primarily non-selective, as is the area within a radius of about seven miles. In this area, almost all children attend comprehensive schools, though it is still possible to opt into the eleven-plus system. This gives rise to the unusual result that those who pass the eleven-plus can attend a grammar school outside the Lincoln comprehensive area, but those who do not pass still attend a (partly non-selective) comprehensive school.\nLincolnshire is also home of University of Lincoln.\nHealth care.\nThe United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust is one of the largest trusts in the country, employing almost 4,000 staff and with an annual budget of over \u00a3200\u00a0million. The north of the county is served by the http://.\nSome of the larger hospitals in the county include:\nSince April 1994, Lincolnshire has had an air ambulance service. The air ambulance is stationed at RAF Waddington near Lincoln and can reach emergencies in Lincolnshire within 25 minutes. An A&amp;E hospital is only 10 minutes away by helicopter from any accident in Lincolnshire.\nDrainage.\nSeparately to the commercial water companies the low-lying parts of the county are drained by various internal drainage boards, such as the http://,http://, http:// , or the http://.\nTransport.\nRoads.\nBeing on the economic periphery of England, Lincolnshire's transport links are poorly developed compared with many other parts of the United Kingdom. The road network in the county is dominated by single carriageway A roads and local roads (B roads) as opposed to motorways and dual carriageways. The administrative county of Lincolnshire is one of the few UK counties without a motorway, and until several years ago, it was said that there was only about of dual carriageway in the whole of Lincolnshire. However the M180 motorway passes through North Lincolnshire, splitting into two dual carriageway trunk roads to the Humber Bridge and Grimsby, and the A46 is now dual carriageway between Newark-on-Trent and Lincoln.\nRailways: history and present day.\nThe low population density of the county means there are few railway stations and train services, considering the county's large area. Many of the county's railway stations were permanently closed following the Beeching Report of 1963. The most notable reopening has been the line and two stations between Lincoln and Sleaford, which reopened within months of the Beeching closure. Most other closed lines in the county were lifted long ago and much of the trackbed has returned to agricultural use.\nPrior to 1970, a through train service operated between Cleethorpes and London King's Cross via Louth, Boston and Peterborough. The part of this line in Grimsby is now the A16 road, preventing reinstatement as a railway line, and a small section of the line is now the Lincolnshire Wolds Railway, with an extension towards Louth in progress.\nA daily through train service operated between Cleethorpes and London King's Cross via Grimsby, Market Rasen and Lincoln Central until the late 1980s. The \"Humberlincs Executive\", as the service was known, was operated by an InterCity 125, but was discontinued following the electrification of the East Coast Main Line. Passengers to/from London now have to change trains at Newark North Gate. However, the East Coast Main Line passes through the western edge of the county and one can catch direct trains to London from Grantham.\nMost rail services are currently operated by East Midlands Railway and Northern Trains. London North Eastern Railway (LNER), Hull Trains and CrossCountry have services which pass through the county, with LNER trains frequently passing and stopping at Grantham, on the East Coast Main Line and a service every other hour to Lincoln, while CrossCountry trains stop at Stamford on their way between Birmingham and Stansted Airport. Stations along the Humber are served by TransPennine Express services between Manchester Airport and Cleethorpes. One of the most infrequent services in the UK is in Lincolnshire: the Sheffield-Gainsborough Central-Cleethorpes line has passenger trains only on a Saturday, with three trains in both directions. This line is, however, used for freight. Hull Trains also stops at Grantham before continuing its journey to either Kings Cross or Hull.\nOn 22 May 2011, East Coast started a Lincoln-London service, initially one train a day each way, and there is a northbound service on a Sunday. This was increased in 2019 to a service every two hours. East Midlands Railway also run a daily (Mon-Sat) service each way between Lincoln and London St Pancras, though this is a stopping service which takes around three hours via Nottingham, compared to LNER's service to London King's Cross which takes around 1 hour 50 minutes.\nAirport.\nThe only airport in Lincolnshire is Humberside Airport, near Brigg. East Midlands Airport, the main airport servicing the East Midlands, is within travelling distance of the county. Until its closure in 2022, Doncaster Sheffield Airport near Doncaster was within travelling distance of much of Lincolnshire.\nBuses.\nThe county's biggest bus companies are Stagecoach Grimsby-Cleethorpes (formerly Grimsby-Cleethorpes Transport) and Stagecoach in Lincolnshire (formerly Lincolnshire Road Car). There are several smaller bus companies, including Brylaine of Boston, Delaine Buses and Hornsby's of Scunthorpe.\nTowns and villages.\nIn terms of population, the 12 biggest settlements in the county by population are:\nA small part of the Thorne Waste area of the town of Thorne in South Yorkshire, known as the Yorkshire Triangle, currently falls under North Lincolnshire.\nTourism.\nThe majority of tourism in Lincolnshire relies on the coastal resorts and towns to the east of the Lincolnshire Wolds. The county has some of the best-known seaside resorts in the United Kingdom, which are a major attraction to visitors from across England, especially the East Midlands and parts of Yorkshire. There are three main coastal resorts in Lincolnshire and several smaller village resorts:\nNature is an attraction for many tourists: the south-east of the county is mainly fenland that attracts many species of birds, as do the national nature reserves at Gibraltar Point, Saltfleetby-Theddlethorpe and Donna Nook, which also contains a large grey seal colony which is popular with visitors.\nThe market towns of the Lincolnshire Wolds, Louth, Alford, Horncastle, Caistor and Spilsby are also attractive, with several having historically important buildings, such as Alford Manor House, St James' Church, Louth and Bolingbroke Castle. The Wolds are popular for cycling and walking, with regular events such as the Lincolnshire Wolds Walking Festival.\nThe city of Lincoln is home to many tourist attractions including Lincoln Castle, Lincoln Cathedral, The Engine Shed, Steep Hill, International Bomber Command Centre and Guildhall and Stonebow among other historical landmarks and listed buildings. The city is one of the many tourist centres in the East Midlands Region.\nCulture.\nLincolnshire has a rustic culture. Due to the large distances between the towns, many villages have remained very self-contained, with many still having shops, pubs, local halls and local chapels and churches, offering a variety of social activities for residents. Fishing (in the extensive river and drainage system in the fens) and shooting are popular activities. A lot of the culture in Lincoln itself is based upon its history. Lincoln Museum is an archaeological museum and art gallery in Lincoln. Lincoln Cathedral also plays a large part in Lincoln's culture, hosting many events throughout the year, from concert recitals to indoor food markets.\nA Lincolnshire tradition was that front doors were used for only three things: a new baby, a bride, and a coffin.\nUrban areas.\nWhile Lincolnshire maintains a rural setting, certain parts of the county form urban areas around its larger settlements or growing centres. Such as, Grimsby-Cleethorpes form the largest urban area in the county with a population of 137,021. The second largest urban area is Lincoln which incorporates the town of North Hykeham and villages of Bracebridge Heath and Waddington. The population of the urban area was recorded at 129,305. Other urban areas include Scunthorpe which includes the town of Bottesford and had a population of 81,286, Grantham (46,778) Boston (45,339), Spalding (35,064), Skegness (26,065) and Gainsborough (22,913).\nPeople.\nThose born in Lincolnshire are sometimes given the nickname of Yellowbellies (often spelt \"Yeller Bellies\", to reflect the pronunciation of the phrase by the typical Lincolnshire farmer). The origin of this term is debated but is most commonly believed to derive from the uniform of the 10th Regiment of Foot (later the Lincolnshire Regiment) which featured yellow facings. For this reason, the coat of arms of Lincolnshire County Council is supported by two officers of the regiment.\nLocal dialect.\nIn common with most other Northern and Midlands dialects in England, \"flat\" \"a\" is preferred, i.e. over , and also traditionally in words like 'water', pronounced \"watter\" (though such a pronunciation is rarely heard nowadays). Similarly, is usually replaced by . Features rather more confined to Lincolnshire include:\nLincolnshire has its own dialect \"champion\", a farmer from the village of Minting called Farmer Wink (real name Robert Carlton), who has produced videos about rural life, narrated in his broad Lincolnshire accent. A resident of Woodhall Spa has published a dictionary of words once prevalent in parts of the county.\nMusic.\n\"The Lincolnshire Poacher\", a folksong, is the country's best-known melody and almost its unofficial anthem. It describes the delights of nocturnal poaching. It was the regimental quick march of the 10th Regiment of Foot and its successors the Royal Lincolnshire Regiment and the 2nd Battalion Royal Anglian Regiment, who are known as \"the Poachers\".\nLincolnshire was historically associated with the Lincolnshire bagpipes, instruments derided as coarse and unpleasant in contemporary literature, but noted as very popular in the county. The last player, John Hunsley of Middle Manton, died in 1851, and since then the instrument has been extinct.\nThe Australian composer Percy Grainger made what are thought to be the first recordings of British Folksongs between 1906 and 1908 in Lincolnshire using a wax Phonograph Cylinder. These are now housed in the British Library. They included songs sung by Joseph Taylor of Saxby-All-Saints who became the first folk singer to be commercially recorded and whose rendition of Brigg Fair inspired classical works by Grainger and Frederick Delius. In 1937, Grainger wrote his \"Lincolnshire Posy\" for wind band. The piece is a compilation of folk songs (\"bunch of wildflowers\") collected by the composer in and around the county of Lincolnshire. Ralph Vaughan Williams was a frequent guest at Gunby Hall. The manuscript of his collected folksong \"Daffodils\" is in their collection.\nSeveral composers have lived and worked in the county. William Byrd was organist and master of the choristers at Lincoln Cathedral from 1563 to 1572. John Taverner was listed as a lay clerk at Tattershall Collegiate Church in 1525 and also sang at St Botolph's Church, Boston under whose famous \"stump\" he is presumed to be buried. Thomas Linley, composer, a friend of Mozart, drowned in the lake at Grimsthorpe Castle near Bourne in 1778. Nicholas Maw was born in Grantham and Peter Seabourne lives in East Kirkby.\nFood.\nLincolnshire has a number of local dishes:\nCraft chocolatiers can be found throughout the county, such as Hansens in Folkingham. In 2013 Redstar Chocolate's \"Duffy's Venezuela Ocumare Milk\" won a gold medal as best bean-to-bar. The factory is in Cleethorpes.\nAnnual events.\nEvery year the Lincolnshire Agricultural Society, founded in 1869, stages the Lincolnshire Agricultural Show. It is held on the Wednesday and Thursday of the last whole week of June at its showground at Grange de Lings, a few miles north of Lincoln on the A15. The show was first held here in 1958. First held around the year 1884, it is one of the largest agricultural shows in the country, and is attended by around 100,000 people over its two days. The showground is in regular use throughout the year for a wide range of other events and functions.\nSmaller local agricultural shows, such as the Heckington Show can still be found. Corby Glen sheep fair has been held since 1238.\nEach year RAF Waddington is the home to the RAF International Waddington Air Show. The two-day event attracts around 150,000 people and usually takes place during the first weekend of July. Since its inception over 35 countries have participated, with aircraft from around the globe attending the Lincolnshire Base. Beginning 2017, the event will be held at nearby RAF Scampton.\nOn the Monday before Easter, an unusual auction takes place in Bourne to let the grazing rights of the Whitebread Meadow. Bidding takes place while two boys race toward the Queen's Bridge in Eastgate, the end of which dash is equivalent to the falling of the gavel. The whole affair dates back to the 1742 will of William Clay.\nThe Haxey Hood village competition takes place every January, as it has for over 700 years.\nStamford's Mid-Lent fair sees showmen converge on the town the week after Mothering Sunday, with rides and sideshows filling Broad Street, the Sheepmarket and the Meadows for a week. Stalls selling Grantham gingerbread and nougat are a traditional feature. The following week sees them in Grantham, on the way north for the Summer. http:// brings a small funfair to Bourne and then to Spalding in Spring and returns in Autumn at the end of the season.\nThe villages of Tetford and Salmonby hold an annual Scarecrow Festival in May every year.\nThe Belchford Downhill Challenge which is held every two years: soapbox racers race down the hill at up to 30\u00a0km/h. The turnout has been up to 1,000.\nLincoln Christmas Market, was a street market held throughout the historic area of the city at the start of December, it was one of the largest Christmas markets in Europe, attracting over 250,000 people over the four-day event. Around the same time, Christmas lights are turned on in Bourne, Sleaford, Skegness, and other towns.\nThroughout the summer the Stamford Shakespeare Company presents the Bard's plays in the open-air theatre at Tolethorpe Hall, which is actually in Rutland.\nThe Spalding Flower Parade was held in late spring every year between 1959 and 2013. Colourful floats decorated with tulip heads competed for a cup.\nLost Village Festival is an annual music and arts event held in a secluded woodland near Norton Disney. Founded in 2015, the festival features a diverse program of live music, DJ sets, immersive theatre, comedy, and interactive experiences. https://\nThe Asylum Steampunk Festival, frequently referred to simply as the Steampunk Festival in Lincoln, is an annual convention and celebration of steampunk culture held in the historic Cathedral Quarter of Lincoln, England. Established in 2009, it is recognized as one of the largest steampunk gatherings in Europe. The festival usually takes place over the August Bank Holiday weekend, drawing enthusiasts from across the globe.\nSport.\nThe main sports played in the county are football, cricket and rugby union. Lincolnshire does not have a high sporting profile, mainly due to the lack of facilities and high-profile football teams. Probably the most well-known sporting venues in Lincolnshire are Cadwell Park near Louth, where a round of the British Motorbike Championship is held on the last Monday of August every year and the racecourse at Market Rasen\nSymbols.\nThe unofficial anthem of the county is the traditional folk song, \"The Lincolnshire Poacher\", which dates from around 1776. A version of the song was the theme for BBC Radio Lincolnshire for many years.\nAccording to a 2002 marketing campaign by the charity Plantlife, the county flower of Lincolnshire is the common dog-violet.\nIn August 2005, BBC Radio Lincolnshire and \"Lincolnshire Life\" magazine launched a vote for a flag of Lincolnshire to represent the county. Six competing designs were voted upon by locals and the winning submission was unveiled in October 2005. Lincoln has its own flag \u2013 St George's flag with a Fleur-de-Lys.\nThe Lincoln Imp has symbolised cathedral, city and county for many years. In 2006 it was replaced as the brand of Lincolnshire County Council by the stylised version seen on the header here http:// which has lost even the unique pose of the carving.\nMedia.\nPress.\nThe county is home to one daily newspaper, the \"Grimsby Telegraph\" which is published in the town and whose circulation area ostensibly covers North East Lincolnshire, although it reaches as far south as Louth and Alford and as west as Brigg.\nThere are two further weekly papers which used to be published daily until 2011; the \"Lincolnshire Echo\" is published weekly from Lincoln and covers the majority of the county reaching as far north as Louth, and the \"Scunthorpe Telegraph\" which covers northern Lincolnshire. All three are ultimately owned by Reach plc.\nThere are also a number of weekly papers serving individual towns published in the county by Iliffe Media. One of these, the \"Stamford Mercury\", claims to be Britain's oldest newspaper, although it is now a typical local weekly and no longer covers stories from the whole East Midlands as the archived copies did.\nTelevision.\nWith the exception of a small area to the south-west of the county, Lincolnshire is served from the Belmont transmitting station, receiving ITV Yorkshire and BBC Yorkshire and Lincolnshire regions. The BBC covers the county in \"Look North\" news from Hull, with input from studios in Lincoln and Grimsby. ITV provides coverage through \"Calendar\" news.\nFrom 1959 to July 1974 ITV programmes were provided by Anglia Television, based in Norwich with news offices in Grimsby. Following a transmitter change, ITV services were provided by Yorkshire Television. This company kept open the offices in Grimsby and opened further facilities in Lincoln, although both of these closed in the mid-1990s.\nSouth-west Lincolnshire receives BBC East Midlands and ITV Central which are broadcast from the Waltham transmitting station. Many villages just west of the Lincoln Cliff cannot get a signal from Belmont due to shadowing and instead get their TV from Emley Moor transmitting station near Huddersfield.\nRadio.\nBBC local radio is provided by BBC Radio Lincolnshire and, in the north of the county, BBC Radio Humberside. Commercial local radio serving the county includes Greatest Hits Radio Yorkshire, Heart East, Hits Radio East Yorkshire &amp; North Lincolnshire, Hits Radio Lincolnshire, Capital Yorkshire (in the north of the county) and Smooth East Midlands. The community radio stations in the county are Endeavour FM in Boston; TMCR 95.3 covering Epworth and Isle of Axholme; and LCR 103.6 in Lincoln.\nMilitary.\nAir.\nBecause of its flat geography and low population density, Lincolnshire is an ideal place for airfields, and the Air Ministry built prolifically with the county hosting nearly seventy separate air bases. It became known as \"bomber county\". Since the end of the Second World War most of these airfields or stations were decommissioned, but the RAF retains a significant footprint in Lincolnshire for the air defence of the United Kingdom and aircrew training. For more information on former bases, see List of former RAF stations.\nTwo major front-line bases located in Lincolnshire are RAF Coningsby, which is one of only two RAF Quick Reaction Alert (QRA) Stations in the United Kingdom and home to the Eurofighter Typhoon jet fighters, and RAF Waddington, where most of the RAF's Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance aircraft are based. The Red Arrows Aerobatic Team has also been based at Waddington since October 2022 after their previous base, RAF Scampton, was closed down. Other stations in Lincolnshire include RAF Cranwell, home to all Air Force Basic Officer Training for the Royal Air Force; RAF Barkston Heath, a training airfield; and minor bases such as RAF Donna Nook and RAF Digby.\nLincolnshire is also home to two active RAF and NATO-allied air weapons training bombing ranges, located along The Wash and north Lincolnshire coastline\u2014RAF Holbeach active since 1926 (originally part of the former RAF Sutton Bridge station) and Donna Nook. The RAF Wainfleet range was decommissioned in 2010.\nArmy.\nThe Army runs Sobraon Barracks, home of 160 (Lincoln) Squadron, Royal Logistic Corps (RLC), as well as Prince William of Gloucester Barracks, Grantham, home to the national specialist logistics units. In November 2016 the Ministry of Defence announced that the Grantham site would close in 2020 but the timescale has twice been extended, latterly to 2028.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Hlist/styles.css\"/&gt;*Bridges and viaducts\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "53296", "revid": "50666884", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53296", "title": "Niels Bohr Institute", "text": "Scientific research institute\nThe Niels Bohr Institute () is a research institute of the University of Copenhagen, founded in 1921 by its namesake Niels Bohr. Started as an institute of theoretical physics, it has since expanded to span research in astronomy, geophysics, nanotechnology, particle physics, quantum mechanics, and biophysics, along with the Cosmic Dawn Center dedicated to research in cosmology.\nOverview.\nThe institute was founded in 1921, as the Institute for Theoretical Physics of the University of Copenhagen, by the Danish theoretical physicist Niels Bohr, who had been on the staff of the University of Copenhagen since 1914, and who had been lobbying for its creation since his appointment as professor in 1916. On the 80th anniversary of Niels Bohr's birth \u2013 October 7, 1965 \u2013 the Institute officially became the Niels Bohr Institute. Much of its original funding came from the charitable foundation of the Carlsberg brewery, and later from the Rockefeller Foundation.\nDuring the 1920s, and 1930s, the institute was the center of the developing disciplines of atomic physics and quantum physics. Physicists from across Europe (and sometimes further abroad) often visited the institute to confer with Bohr on new theories and discoveries. The Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics is named after work done at the institute during this time.\nFollowing his father's death in 1962, Aage Bohr succeeded him as director of the Niels Bohr Institute, a position he held until 1970. He remained active there until he retired in 1992.\nOn January 1, 1993, the institute was merged with the Astronomic Observatory, the \u00d8rsted Laboratory and the Geophysical Institute. The new resulting institute retained the name Niels Bohr Institute.\nA new building was erected on Jagtvej to house the Niels Bohr institute in 2024, where it now resides alongside the Department of Chemistry.\nResearch sections.\nThe research at the Niels Bohr Institute spans Astronomy, Geophysics, Nanophysics, Particles Physics, Quantum Physics and Biophysics.\nResearch at the institute is based on observations, fieldwork, laboratory experiments and theoretical models for the purpose of understanding basic laws and complex truths on this world. The Institute has a broad network of scientific cooperation, and a lively exchange of collaborators and guests with leading international research groups.\nAstrophysics.\nA broad spectrum of astronomy and astrophysics is researched at the Niels Bohr Institute \u2013 everything from the visible Universe such as planets, stars and galaxies \u2013 to the invisible universe and the presence of dark energy and dark matter.\nThe NBI astrophysicists participate in many international projects and have access to modern telescopes and satellites via, e.g. Denmark\u2019s membership of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) and the European Space Agency (ESA), and to state-of-the-art supercomputers.\nBiocomplexity and Biophysics.\nBiocomplexity is a cutting-edge area of research between physics and biology. By using the principles and methods of physics one can explore the living nature and biological phenomena.\nResearchers at BioComplexity continuously explore the diversity of complex phenomena in biological, physical and social systems, including pattern formation, complex and chaotic dynamics, fluid dynamics, game theory, networks and econophysics.\nPhysics approaches are used to suggest and perform experiments and models of living systems. The systems range from proteins and gene regulation to larger-scale collective spatiotemporal structure formation. The research at the institute is often performed as a collaboration between physicists, biologists, medical doctors, and nanoscientists.\nCondensed Matter Physics.\nCondensed matter physics is concerned with the understanding of the physical properties of solids and liquids, both naturally occurring and artificially produced.\nCondensed matter physics is the foundation for many every-day technologies, ranging from hardening of steel to integrated microchips. Modern research in condensed matter physics takes place in both large scale x-ray and neutron scattering facilities, as well as in locally based laboratories, where quantum phenomena are being explored at temperatures near absolute zero. There is a vivid exchange between condensed matter and neighboring research areas, including biophysics, nanoscience, chemistry, optics, and quantum information.\nExperimental Particle Physics.\nHow was the universe created, which inflation scenario played out in the first split second, what happened during the quark-gluon plasma era? What is the source of the mass spectrum of fundamental particles of matter and forces? These are some of the questions particle physicists are looking for answers to.\nThe Particle Physicists work with the build up of matter in the early universe. They are searching for an explanation as to what the universe's smallest components were composed of in the first milliseconds after the Big Bang 14 billion years ago and what forces held them together.\nPhysics of Ice, Climate and Earth.\nThe section for the Physics of Ice, Climate and Earth at the Niels Bohr Institute studies the elements of the Earth and climate system \u2013 the atmosphere, oceans, ice sheets and glaciers, sea ice, and the solid Earth itself \u2013 and the interactions between them.\nQuantum Optics and Photonics.\nThe Quantum Optics section conducts experimental and theoretical research in Quantum Optics, in particular, in Quantum Information Processing, Quantum Sensors, and Quantum Technologies.\nWe use photons, from optics to microwaves interacting with a wide variety of quantum matter, such as quantum dots, single atoms, atomic ensembles and mechanical oscillators.\nThe overarching theme is generation and manipulation of non-classical entangled states for quantum simulation, sensing and communication. The research directions span from fundamental research to device engineering.\nTheoretical high energy, astroparticle and gravitational physics.\nThe Theoretical high energy, astroparticle and gravitational physics at the Niels Bohr Institute is involved in a wide scope of research activities centered around quantum theories of gauge fields, gravity and astrophysics.\nResearch areas include scattering amplitudes, effective field theory, black holes, holography, lattice simulations, quantum gravity, integrability, astroparticle physics, and cosmology.\nResearch Centres.\nCosmic Dawn.\nThe Cosmic Dawn Center is an Astronomy/Cosmology research center, founded as a collaboration between the University of Copenhagen and DTU Space of the Danish Technical University (DTU). The center is led by center director and NBI Professor Sune Toft and center co-director Thomas Greve, Professor at DTU and UCL. The main objective of the center is to investigate the period known as the Cosmic Dawn (the transition period following the Cosmic Dark Ages), i.e. the reionization of the Universe and the formation of the first galaxies, through observations as well as through theory and simulations.\nGoals.\nResearch conducted at the center is focused on the specific period in the history of the Universe known as the \"Cosmic Dawn\". This largely unexplored period, 300-600 million years after the Big Bang is when the first stars, black holes, and galaxies are believed to have formed. Many of the observations used by the center originate from the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), one of the more powerful telescopes in the world. In the future, the center aims to mainly use the James Webb Space Telescope and the Euclid Telescope of the European Space Agency (ESA). DAWN scientists were instrumental in the construction of three instruments (NIRSpec, MIRI and NIRISS) for the project, and will be involved in the analysis of the first data from the telescope.\nPublished research.\nAs of April 18, 2020, DAWN authors have published at least 187 refereed papers garnering 1602 citations, which, among others, can be found at the NASA/ADS library.\nMedal of Honour.\nin 2010, the year of the 125th anniversary of the birth of Niels Bohr, the institute established the Niels Bohr Institute Medal of Honour. It is an annual award for \"a particularly outstanding researcher who is working in the spirit of Niels Bohr: International cooperation and the exchange of knowledge\".\nThe medal is made by Danish sculptor Rikke Raben for the Niels Bohr Institute. On the front is a portrait of Niels Bohr, the atom sign and stars. The illustration on the back is inspired by a quote from Bohr: \"What is it that we human beings ultimately depend on? We depend on our words. We are suspended in language. Our task is to communicate experience and ideas to others\".\nOn the back of the medal: \"Unity of Knowledge\" \u2013 the title of a lecture given by Bohr at Columbia University in 1954. \"Nosce te ipsum\" is Latin and means \"know thyself\". This quote originates from the Oracle of Delphi, in the Temple of Apollo in Greece.\nRecipients:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "53297", "revid": "48643156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53297", "title": "DESY", "text": "German national research center\nDESY, short for Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (English: \"German Electron Synchrotron\"), is a national research centre for fundamental science located in Hamburg and Zeuthen near Berlin in Germany. It operates particle accelerators used to investigate the structure, dynamics and function of matter, and conducts a broad spectrum of interdisciplinary scientific research in four main areas: particle and high energy physics; photon science; astroparticle physics; and the development, construction and operation of particle accelerators. Its name refers to its first project, an electron synchrotron. DESY is publicly financed by the Federal Republic of Germany and the Federal States of Hamburg and Brandenburg and is a member of the Helmholtz Association.\nFunctions and mission.\nDESY's function is to conduct fundamental research for solely civil and peaceful purposes. It specialises in particle accelerator development, construction and operation, particle physics, astroparticle physics and photon science research to explore the fundamental relationships between the structure, dynamics and function of matter. In cooperation with its partner organisations, its photon science research spans surface physics, material science, chemistry, molecular biology, geophysics and medicine through the use of synchrotron radiation and free-electron lasers.\nIn addition to operating its own large accelerator facilities, DESY participates in many major international research projects, for example the European X-Ray Free-Electron Laser in Germany, the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland, the Belle II experiment in Japan, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory at the South Pole and the worldwide Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory.\nSites.\nDESY operates in two locations. The primary location is in the Bahrenfeld quarter of Hamburg. In 1992, DESY expanded to a second site in Zeuthen near Berlin.\nHamburg.\nThe DESY Hamburg site is located in the quarter Bahrenfeld, in the west of the city in the district of Altona. Its main accelerators are located here.\nZeuthen.\nFollowing German reunification, DESY expanded to a second site in Zeuthen near Berlin. In 1939, the German Postal Ministry founded a nuclear physics laboratory there. After World War II, the laboratory was first named \"Institute X\", to become the Institute for High Energy Physics (), the high-energy physics laboratory of the German Democratic Republic belonging to the Academy of Sciences of the GDR. The institute was merged with DESY on 1\u00a0January 1992. It focuses on parallel computing for theoretical particle physics, the development and construction of electron sources for X-ray lasers as well as astroparticle physics with a focus on gamma-ray and neutrino astronomy.\nEmployees and training.\nDESY employs about 3,000 staff members from more than 60 nations. Most staff work at the Hamburg site, with about 270 at the Zeuthen site. These numbers include more than 130 trainees in various industrial-technical professions and about 500 PhD students and postdocs supervised by DESY. In addition, there are numerous master students from various universities.\nBudget and financing.\nThe research centre is a foundation under civil law financed by public funds. In 2024, DESY had an annual budget of about 359\u00a0million euros (according to the German federal budget plan as part of institutional funding). In addition, it had a project funding income of about 32\u00a0million euros. 90% of the annual budget is provided by the German Federal Ministry of Research, Technology and Space and 10% respectively by the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg and the German federal state of Brandenburg.\nParticle accelerators and other facilities.\nDESY's accelerators were not all built at once, but were rather added one by one to meet the growing demand of the scientists for higher and higher energies to gain more insight into particle structures. In the course of the construction of new accelerators, the older ones were converted to pre-accelerators or to sources for synchrotron radiation for laboratories with new research tasks.\nDESY.\nThe DESY synchrotron (short for \"Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron\") has been in operation since 1964. Its circumference is 300\u00a0m. It was used until 1978 for particle physics experiments and first measurements with synchrotron radiation. Since then, rebuilt and upgraded several times, it has served as a pre-accelerator and as a test beam facility delivering high-energy particle beams for testing detector systems.\nDORIS.\nThe DORIS storage ring (short for Double Ring Storage Facility) operated from 1974 to 2013. It had a circumference of 289\u00a0m. Until 1992, it collided electrons with positrons for particle physics experiments (including the ARGUS experiment). From 1980 on, the synchrotron radiation generated by DORIS was used for photon science experiments; from 1993 to 2012, the storage ring served exclusively as a synchrotron radiation source. The particle physics experiment OLYMPUS then ran in 2012 before DORIS was shut down at the beginning of 2013.\nPETRA.\nThe PETRA storage ring (short for Positron\u2013Electron Tandem Ring Accelerator) has been in operation since 1978. It has a circumference of 2,304\u00a0m. Until 1986, electrons and positrons collided in PETRA for research in particle physics (experiments JADE, MARK-J, TASSO and PLUTO). From 1990 on, PETRA served as a pre-accelerator for the HERA storage ring, and from 1995 on also as a synchrotron radiation source with two test experimental stations. Since 2009, the facility has been delivering hard X-ray beams of very high brilliance to over 40 experimental stations under the name PETRA III.\nHERA.\nThe HERA storage ring (short for Hadron\u2013Electron Ring Accelerator) operated from 1992 to 2007. It has a circumference of 6,336\u00a0m. It was DESY's largest ring accelerator and Germany's largest research instrument to date. Until 2007, HERA was the only storage ring facility in the world to enable collisions of electrons or positrons with protons for particle physics (experiments H1, ZEUS, HERMES and HERA-B) for studies of the inner structure of the proton.\nFLASH.\nThe free-electron laser (FEL) FLASH (short for Free-Electron Laser in Hamburg) has been in operation since 2000. It has a length of 315\u00a0m. It is based on a test facility for superconducting accelerator technology built in 1997 for the TESLA project and has served as a user facility for experiments with the generated FEL radiation since 2005. FLASH provides ultrashort light pulses in the extreme ultraviolet and soft X-ray range for seven experimental stations and is also used as a test facility for the development of accelerator and FEL technologies.\nEuropean XFEL accelerator.\nDESY operates the 1.7\u00a0km superconducting linear accelerator of the European XFEL X-ray free-electron laser, an international research facility that delivers ultrashort light pulses in the high-energy X-ray range.\nPITZ.\nSince 2001, the DESY site in Zeuthen has been home to the photoinjector test facility PITZ, a linear accelerator used to study, optimise and prepare the electron sources for FLASH and (since 2015) for the European XFEL.\nOther facilities.\nThe building of the former DORIS storage ring now houses the SINBAD (\"Short Innovative Bunches and Accelerators at DESY\") accelerator complex with various infrastructures for accelerator R&amp;D: the linear accelerator ARES for accelerator research with ultrashort electron pulses for medical purposes, the AXSIS facility for terahertz-driven acceleration to generate ultrashort X-ray pulses for materials science or medical imaging, and the high-power laser KALDERA for research into laser-driven plasma acceleration.\nThe LUX facility is also used for research into laser-driven plasma acceleration, the FLASHForward experiment at FLASH for electron-beam-driven plasma acceleration. The relativistic electron beam source REGAE generates ultrashort electron pulses for time-resolved diffraction experiments.\nThe tunnel of the former HERA storage ring now houses the ALPS\u00a0II experiment, which uses converted superconducting dipole magnets of the HERA proton ring to study extremely light particles.\nComputing.\nDESY provides extensive storage and computing capacity for research in all its divisions within the Interdisciplinary Data and Analysis Facility (IDAF). The Maxwell HPC Cluster, a high-performance computing platform, serves photon science analysis and accelerator science and operations. As part of the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG), DESY operates a Tier-2 computer centre that offers computing and storage systems for the ATLAS, CMS and LHCb experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In addition, the DESY grid infrastructure is used by other experiments such as Belle II or IceCube. It is complemented by the National Analysis Facility (NAF) for particle physics data analysis. IDAF storage is provided using DCache and General Parallel File System (GPFS).\nResearch areas.\nResearch at DESY is organised into four divisions: Accelerators, Photon Science, Particle Physics and Astroparticle Physics.\nThe Accelerator division develops fundamental technologies for the accelerator facilities that DESY and its partners use in their scientific mission. In addition to the operation and further development of existing facilities (PETRA IV and FLASH2020+ projects, expansion of the European XFEL), essential activities include research into new accelerator concepts, in particular plasma wakefield acceleration, and the improvement of superconducting radio frequency accelerator technology.\nIn the Photon Science division, photons are being used to study the structure, dynamics and function of matter. To this end, the division develops, builds and operates beamlines and experiments at the DESY light sources PETRA III and FLASH. Every year, more than 3,000 researchers \u2013 most of them from universities, but also from non-university research institutions and industry \u2013 from over 40 countries conduct experiments at the light sources and in the laboratories at DESY. The research spectrum ranges from basic research to applied research and industrial collaborations in physics, chemistry, biology, medicine, life sciences, earth sciences, materials research as well as the study of cultural heritage.\nThe Particle Physics division is involved in the large-scale experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN near Geneva. As part of the international collaborations that run the ATLAS and CMS experiments, DESY contributes to many developments at the LHC, from hardware design and data analysis to preparations for the planned upgrades. DESY also participates in the Belle II experiment at the electron\u2013positron collider SuperKEKB at the research centre KEK in Tsukuba, Japan, as well as in developments for possible future electron\u2013positron linear colliders. It is also active in theoretical particle physics.\nThe Astroparticle Physics division investigates high-energy processes in the universe. Detectors and telescopes are used to analyse neutrinos and gamma rays from space, which can provide information about cosmic phenomena: black holes, exploding stars and radiation bursts of extreme intensity. To this end, DESY is involved in the gamma telescopes MAGIC, H.E.S.S. and VERITAS as well as the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, and it contributes to the planned Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO). It is the second largest partner in the IceCube Neutrino Observatory at the South Pole.\nHistory.\nDESY was founded on 18\u00a0December 1959 in Hamburg. According to its statutes, DESY's mission is \"the promotion of basic scientific research [...] in particular through the development, construction and operation of accelerators and their scientific use, in photon science and in the fields of particle and astroparticle physics, as well as through research and development work related thereto\".\nFrom 1959 to 2007, the DESY accelerators were primarily used for particle physics, initially with the eponymous DESY electron synchrotron (1964\u2013present), followed by DORIS (Double Ring Storage Facility, 1974\u20131992), PETRA (Positron\u2013Electron Tandem Ring Facility, 1978\u2013present) and HERA (Hadron\u2013Electron Ring Accelerator, 1992\u20132007). In 1987, the ARGUS experiment at DORIS was the first to observe a large mixing of B mesons and thus a process in which matter and antimatter behave differently. The most important discovery of the experiments TASSO, JADE, MARK-J and PLUTO at PETRA was the detection of the gluon, the messenger particle of the strong force, in 1979. From 1990, PETRA served as a pre-accelerator for the even larger storage ring HERA with its four experiments H1, ZEUS, HERMES and HERA-B. HERA was the only storage ring facility in the world in which protons collided with electrons or positrons. In these collisions, the point-like electron acted like a probe, scanning the inner structure of the proton and making it visible with high resolution. HERA's precise insights into the interior of the proton formed the basis for numerous other particle physics experiments, especially at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the research centre CERN and for numerous developments in theoretical particle physics.\nIn parallel, as early as the 1960s, research groups from DESY, various universities and the Max Planck Society developed the technology for using the synchrotron radiation produced by the accelerators. To meet the rapidly growing national and European demand, DESY founded its own large laboratory: the Hamburg Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory HASYLAB, which opened in 1980. It provided measuring stations at DORIS, and it was here that the Israeli biochemist Ada Yonath (Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2009) conducted experiments from 1986 to 2004 that led to her deciphering the ribosome. From 1995, both synchrotron radiation and particle physics experiments were conducted at PETRA. In 2009, the PETRA facility was upgraded for exclusive use as a synchrotron radiation source for hard X-rays (PETRA III). Today, PETRA III serves over 40 experimental stations, and there are plans to expand it into the PETRA IV 3D X-ray microscope. With the shutdown of DORIS in early 2013, the name HASYLAB was abandoned, and the use of DESY's light sources has since been carried out in its Photon Science division.\nIn the early 1990s, DESY began to develop a new technology: radio frequency accelerator technology based on superconducting cavities made of niobium, which are cooled to approximately 2\u00a0K (\u2212271\u00a0\u00b0C) with liquid helium. The first accelerator on this basis was a test facility for superconducting linear accelerators at DESY to test the principle of self-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE) of X-ray laser light. The SASE theory was developed and refined at DESY and at institutes in Russia, Italy and the US from 1980 onwards. In 2000 to 2001, the test facility at DESY was the first free-electron laser in the world to produce light flashes in the vacuum ultraviolet and soft X-ray range. Today, the FLASH facility produces ultrashort light pulses in the soft X-ray range for seven experimental stations. Since 2020, it has been expanded to further optimise the properties of the radiation (FLASH2020+ project).\nFrom 2009 to 2016, an international consortium led by DESY developed the European X-ray free-electron laser European XFEL. The international research facility, which involves 12 European shareholder countries, is operated by the non-profit company European XFEL GmbH. The core of the facility is a 1.7\u00a0km superconducting linear accelerator. With an electron energy of 17.5\u00a0GeV, it is the most powerful superconducting linear accelerator in the world to date. DESY operates the accelerator on behalf of European XFEL GmbH.\nSince 2010, DESY has been developing plasma-based accelerator technology (both laser- and electron-beam-driven) as a possible alternative to conventional accelerator technologies, with the aim of enabling compact accelerators for photon science, particle physics as well as medical and industrial applications.\nChairpersons of the DESY Directorate.\nDESY is headed by a Directorate consisting of the directors of the four divisions (Accelerators, Photon Science, Particle Physics and Astroparticle Physics) and the administration as well as the delegate of the Directorate for innovation. Chairpersons of the Directorate so far have been:\nJoint research centres.\nThe DESY campus in Hamburg is the location of several national and international centres in which DESY participates. These are:\nKnowledge and technology transfer.\nDESY aims to promote start-ups and bring know-how from fundamental research into application. It offers commercial companies support for industrial issues, e.g. through special industry access to photon sources and laboratories, develops ideas, applications and products based on fundamental research, and supports its employees in founding start-ups based on DESY technologies in the Hamburg and Brandenburg regions. DESY offers start-ups access to offices, laboratories and workshops in the DESY Innovation Village and the Start-up Labs Bahrenfeld, established together with the University of Hamburg and the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "53299", "revid": "1312994749", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53299", "title": "Brookhaven National Laboratory", "text": "United States Department of Energy national laboratory\nBrookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) is a United States Department of Energy national laboratory located in Upton, New York, a hamlet of the Town of Brookhaven. It was formally established in 1947 at the site of Camp Upton, a former U.S. Army base on Long Island. Located approximately 60 miles east of New York City, it is managed by Stony Brook University and Battelle Memorial Institute.\nResearch at BNL includes nuclear and high energy physics, energy science and technology, environmental and bioscience, nanoscience, and national security. The 5,300-acre campus contains several large research facilities, including the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and National Synchrotron Light Source II. Seven Nobel Prizes have been awarded for work conducted at Brookhaven Lab.\nOverview.\nBNL operations are overseen by a Department of Energy Site office, is staffed by approximately 2,750 scientists, engineers, technicians, and support personnel, and hosts 4,000 guest investigators every year. The laboratory is guarded by a Department of Energy Protective Force, has a full service fire department, and has its own ZIP code (11973). In total, the lab spans a area that is mostly coterminous with the hamlet of Upton, New York. BNL is served by a rail spur operated as-needed by the New York and Atlantic Railway. Co-located with the laboratory is the New York, NY, weather forecast office of the National Weather Service.\nMajor programs.\nAlthough originally conceived as a nuclear research facility, Brookhaven Lab's mission has greatly expanded. Its foci are now:\nOperation.\nBrookhaven National Lab was originally owned by the Atomic Energy Commission and is now owned by that agency's successor, the United States Department of Energy (DOE). DOE subcontracts the research and operation to universities and research organizations. It is currently operated by Brookhaven Science Associates LLC, which is an equal partnership of Stony Brook University and Battelle Memorial Institute. From 1947 to 1998, it was operated by Associated Universities, Inc. (AUI), but AUI lost its contract in the wake of two incidents: a 1994 fire at the facility's high-flux beam reactor that exposed several workers to radiation and reports in 1997 of a tritium leak into the groundwater of the Long Island Central Pine Barrens on which the facility sits.\nHistory.\nFoundations.\nFollowing World War II, the US Atomic Energy Commission was created to support government-sponsored peacetime research on atomic energy. The effort to build a nuclear reactor in the American northeast was fostered largely by physicists Isidor Isaac Rabi and Norman Foster Ramsey Jr., who during the war witnessed many of their colleagues at Columbia University leave for new remote research sites following the departure of the Manhattan Project from its campus. Their effort to house this reactor near New York City was rivalled by a similar effort at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to have a facility near Boston. Involvement was quickly solicited from representatives of northeastern universities to the south and west of New York City such that this city would be at their geographic center. In March 1946 a nonprofit corporation was established that consisted of representatives from nine major research universities \u2014 Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, Johns Hopkins, MIT, Princeton, University of Pennsylvania, University of Rochester, and Yale University.\nOut of 17 considered sites in the Boston-Washington corridor, Camp Upton on Long Island was eventually chosen as the most suitable in consideration of space, transportation, and availability. The camp had been a training center for the US Army during both World War I and World War II, and a Japanese internment camp during the latter. Following the war, Camp Upton was no longer needed, and a plan was conceived to convert the military camp into a research facility.\nOn March 21, 1947, the Camp Upton site was officially transferred from the U.S. War Department to the new U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), predecessor to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).\nResearch and facilities.\nReactor history.\nIn 1947 construction began on the first nuclear reactor at Brookhaven, the Brookhaven Graphite Research Reactor. This reactor, which opened in 1950, was the first reactor to be constructed in the United States after World War II. The High Flux Beam Reactor operated from 1965 to 1999. In 1959 Brookhaven built the first US reactor specifically tailored to medical research, the Brookhaven Medical Research Reactor, which operated until 2000.\nAccelerator history.\nIn 1952 Brookhaven began using its first particle accelerator, the Cosmotron. At the time the Cosmotron was the world's highest energy accelerator, being the first to impart more than 1 GeV of energy to a particle. The Cosmotron was retired in 1966, after it was superseded in 1960 by the new Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS). The AGS was used in research that resulted in three Nobel Prizes, including the discovery of the muon neutrino, the charm quark, and CP violation.\nIn 1970 in BNL started the ISABELLE project to develop and build two proton intersecting storage rings. The groundbreaking for the project was in October 1978. In 1981, with the tunnel for the accelerator already excavated, problems with the superconducting magnets needed for the ISABELLE accelerator brought the project to a halt, and the project was eventually cancelled in 1983.\nThe National Synchrotron Light Source operated from 1982 to 2014 and was involved with two Nobel Prize-winning discoveries. It has since been replaced by the National Synchrotron Light Source II.\nAfter ISABELLE'S cancellation, physicist at BNL proposed that the excavated tunnel and parts of the magnet assembly be used in another accelerator. In 1984 the first proposal for the accelerator now known as the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) was put forward. The construction got funded in 1991 and RHIC has been operational since 2000. One of the world's only two operating heavy-ion colliders, RHIC is as of 2010 the second-highest-energy collider after the Large Hadron Collider. RHIC is housed in a tunnel 2.4 miles (3.9\u00a0km) long and is visible from space.\nOn January 9, 2020, It was announced by Paul Dabbar, undersecretary of the US Department of Energy Office of Science, that the BNL eRHIC design has been selected over the conceptual design put forward by Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility as the future Electron\u2013ion collider (EIC) in the United States. In addition to the site selection, it was announced that the BNL EIC had acquired CD-0 (mission need) from the Department of Energy. BNL's eRHIC design proposes upgrading the existing Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, which collides beams light to heavy ions including polarized protons, with a polarized electron facility, to be housed in the same tunnel.\nOther discoveries.\nIn 1958, Brookhaven scientists created one of the world's first video games, \"Tennis for Two\".\nIn 1967, Brookhaven scientists patented Maglev, a transportation technology that utilizes magnetic levitation.\nIn 2024, Brookhaven National Laboratories scientists discovered a new kind of antimatter nucleus.\nOff-site contributions.\nIt is a contributing partner to ATLAS experiment, one of the four detectors located at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). It is currently operating at CERN near Geneva, Switzerland.\nBrookhaven was also responsible for the design of the SNS accumulator ring in partnership with Spallation Neutron Source in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.\nBrookhaven plays a role in a range of neutrino research projects around the world, including the Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino Experiment in China and the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory.\nPublic access.\nFor other than approved Public Events, the Laboratory is closed to the general public. The lab is open to the public on several Sundays during the summer for tours and special programs. The public access program is referred to as 'Summer Sundays' and takes place in July, and features a science show and a tour of the lab's major facilities. The laboratory also hosts science fairs, science bowls, and robotics competitions for local schools, and lectures, concerts, and scientific talks for the local community. The Lab estimates that each year it enhances the science education of roughly 35,000 K-12 students on Long Island, more than 200 undergraduates, and 550 teachers from across the United States.\nEnvironmental cleanup.\nIn January 1997, ground water samples taken by BNL staff revealed concentrations of tritium that were twice the allowable federal drinking water standards\u2014some samples taken later were 32 times the standard. The tritium was found to be leaking from the laboratory's High Flux Beam Reactor's spent-fuel pool into the aquifer that provides drinking water for nearby Suffolk County residents.\nDOE's and BNL's investigation of this incident concluded that the tritium had been leaking for as long as 12 years without DOE's or BNL's knowledge. Installing wells that could have detected the leak was first discussed by BNL engineers in 1993, but the wells were not completed until 1996. The resulting controversy about both BNL's handling of the tritium leak and perceived lapses in DOE's oversight led to the termination of AUI as the BNL contractor in May 1997.\nThe responsibility for failing to discover Brookhaven's tritium leak has been acknowledged by laboratory managers, and DOE admits it failed to properly oversee the laboratory's operations. Brookhaven officials repeatedly treated the need for installing monitoring wells that would have detected the tritium leak as a low priority despite public concern and the laboratory's agreement to follow local environmental regulations. DOE's on-site oversight office, the Brookhaven Group, was directly responsible for Brookhaven's performance, but it failed to hold the laboratory accountable for meeting all of its regulatory commitments, especially its agreement to install monitoring wells. Senior DOE leadership also shared responsibility because they failed to put in place an effective system that encourages all parts of DOE to work together to ensure that contractors meet their responsibilities on environmental, safety and health issues. Unclear responsibilities for environment, safety and health matters has been a recurring problem for DOE management.\nSince 1993, DOE has spent more than US$580 million on remediating soil and groundwater contamination at the lab site and completed several high-profile projects. These include the decommissioning and decontamination of the Brookhaven Graphite Research Reactor, removal of mercury-contaminated sediment from the Peconic River, and installation and operation of 16 on- and off-site groundwater treatment systems that have cleaned more than 25 billion gallons of groundwater since 1996.\nShortly after winning the contract to operate the lab in 1997, BSA formed a Community Advisory Council (CAC) to advise the laboratory director on cleanup projects and other items of interest to the community. The CAC represents a diverse range of interests and values of individuals and groups who are interested in or affected by the actions of the Laboratory. It consists of representatives from 26 local business, civic, education, environment, employee, government, and health organizations. The CAC sets its own agenda, brings forth issues important to the community, and works to provide consensus recommendations to Laboratory management.\nList of laboratory directors.\nThe following persons served as lab directors since 1946:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "53300", "revid": "20483999", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53300", "title": "SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory", "text": "Research center at Stanford University\nSLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, originally named the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, is a federally funded research and development center in Menlo Park, California, United States. Founded in 1962, the laboratory is now sponsored by the United States Department of Energy and administrated by Stanford University. It is the site of the Stanford Linear Accelerator, a linear accelerator constructed in 1966 that could accelerate electrons to energies of 50\u00a0GeV.\nToday SLAC research centers on a broad program in atomic and solid-state physics, chemistry, biology, and medicine using X-rays from synchrotron radiation and a free-electron laser as well as experimental and theoretical research in elementary particle physics, accelerator physics, astroparticle physics, and cosmology. The laboratory is under the programmatic direction of the United States Department of Energy Office of Science.\nHistory.\nFounded in 1962 as the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, the facility is located on of Stanford University-owned land on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, California, just west of the university's main campus. The main accelerator is long, making it the longest linear accelerator in the world, and has been operational since 1966.\nResearch at SLAC has produced three Nobel Prizes in Physics:\nIn 1984, the laboratory was named an ASME National Historic Engineering Landmark and an IEEE Milestone.\nSLAC developed and, in December 1991, began hosting the first World Wide Web server outside of Europe.\nIn the early-to-mid 1990s, the Stanford Linear Collider (SLC) investigated the properties of the Z boson using the Stanford Large Detector.\nBy 2005, SLAC employed over 1,000 people, some 150 of whom were physicists with doctorate degrees, and served over 3,000 visiting researchers yearly, operating particle accelerators for high-energy physics and the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) for synchrotron light radiation research, which was \"indispensable\" in the research leading to the 2006 Nobel Prize in Chemistry awarded to Stanford Professor Roger D. Kornberg.\nIn October 2008, the Department of Energy announced that the center's name would be changed to SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. The reasons given include a better representation of the new direction of the lab and the ability to trademark the laboratory's name. Stanford University had legally opposed the Department of Energy's attempt to trademark \"Stanford Linear Accelerator Center\".\nIn March 2009, it was announced that the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory was to receive $68.3 million in Recovery Act Funding to be disbursed by Department of Energy's Office of Science.\nIn October 2016, Bits and Watts launched as a collaboration between SLAC and Stanford University to design \"better, greener electric grids\". SLAC later pulled out over concerns about an industry partner, the state-owned Chinese electric utility.\nIn April 2024, SLAC completed two decades of work constructing the world's largest digital camera for the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) project at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile. The camera become operational in 2025.\nComponents.\nAccelerator.\nThe main accelerator was an RF linear accelerator that accelerated electrons and positrons up to 50\u00a0GeV. At long, the accelerator was the longest linear accelerator in the world, and was claimed to be \"the world's most straight object.\" until 2017 when the European x-ray free electron laser opened. The main accelerator is buried below ground and passes underneath Interstate Highway 280. The above-ground klystron gallery atop the beamline, was the longest building in the United States until the LIGO project's twin interferometers were completed in 1999. It is easily distinguishable from the air and is marked as a visual waypoint on aeronautical charts.\nA portion of the original linear accelerator is now part of the Linac Coherent Light Source.\nStanford Linear Collider.\nThe Stanford Linear Collider was a linear accelerator that collided electrons and positrons at SLAC. The center of mass energy was about 90\u00a0GeV, equal to the mass of the Z boson, which the accelerator was designed to study.\nGrad student Barrett D. Milliken discovered the first Z event on April 12, 1989, while poring over the previous day's computer data from the Mark II detector. The bulk of the data was collected by the SLAC Large Detector, which came online in 1991. Although largely overshadowed by the Large Electron\u2013Positron Collider at CERN, which began running in 1989, the highly polarized electron beam at SLC (close to 80%) made certain unique measurements possible, such as parity violation in Z Boson-b quark coupling.\nPresently no beam enters the south and north arcs in the machine, which leads to the Final Focus, therefore this section is mothballed to run beam into the PEP2 section from the beam switchyard.\nSLAC Large Detector.\nThe SLAC Large Detector (SLD) was the main detector for the Stanford Linear Collider. It was designed primarily to detect Z bosons produced by the accelerator's electron-positron collisions. Built in 1991, the SLD operated from 1992 to 1998.\nPEP.\nPEP (Positron-Electron Project) began operation in 1980, with center-of-mass energies up to 29\u00a0GeV. At its apex, PEP had five large particle detectors in operation, as well as a sixth smaller detector. About 300 researchers made used of PEP. PEP stopped operating in 1990, and PEP-II began construction in 1994.\nPEP-II.\nFrom 1999 to 2008, the main purpose of the linear accelerator was to inject electrons and positrons into the PEP-II accelerator, an electron-positron collider with a pair of storage rings in circumference. PEP-II was host to the BaBar experiment, one of the so-called B-Factory experiments studying charge-parity symmetry.\nStanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource.\nThe Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL) is a synchrotron light user facility located on the SLAC campus. Originally built for particle physics, it was used in experiments where the J/\u03c8 meson was discovered. It is now used exclusively for materials science and biology experiments which take advantage of the high-intensity synchrotron radiation emitted by the stored electron beam to study the structure of molecules. In the early 1990s, an independent electron injector was built for this storage ring, allowing it to operate independently of the main linear accelerator.\nFermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope.\nSLAC plays a primary role in the mission and operation of the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, launched in August 2008. The principal scientific objectives of this mission are:\nKIPAC.\nThe Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology (KIPAC) is partially housed on the grounds of SLAC, in addition to its presence on the main Stanford campus.\nPULSE.\nThe Stanford PULSE Institute (PULSE) is a Stanford Independent Laboratory located in the Central Laboratory at SLAC. PULSE was created by Stanford in 2005 to help Stanford faculty and SLAC scientists develop ultrafast x-ray research at LCLS. PULSE research publications can be viewed https://.\nLCLS.\nThe Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) is a free electron laser facility located at SLAC. The LCLS is partially a reconstruction of the last 1/3 of the original linear accelerator at SLAC, and can deliver extremely intense x-ray radiation for research in a number of areas. It achieved first lasing in April 2009.\nThe laser produces hard X-rays, 109 times the relative brightness of traditional synchrotron sources and is the most powerful x-ray source in the world. LCLS enables a variety of new experiments and provides enhancements for existing experimental methods. Often, x-rays are used to take \"snapshots\" of objects at the atomic level before obliterating samples. The laser's wavelength, ranging from 6.2 to 0.13\u00a0nm (200 to 9500 electron volts (eV)) is similar to the width of an atom, providing extremely detailed information that was previously unattainable. Additionally, the laser is capable of capturing images with a \"shutter speed\" measured in femtoseconds, or million-billionths of a second, necessary because the intensity of the beam is often high enough so that the sample explodes on the femtosecond timescale.\nLCLS-II.\nThe LCLS-II project is to provide a major upgrade to LCLS by adding two new X-ray laser beams. The new system will utilize the of existing tunnel to add a new superconducting accelerator at 4\u00a0GeV and two new sets of undulators that will increase the available energy range of LCLS. The advancement from the discoveries using this new capabilities may include new drugs, next-generation computers, and new materials.\nFACET.\nIn 2012, the first two-thirds (~2\u00a0km) of the original SLAC LINAC were recommissioned for a new user facility, the Facility for Advanced Accelerator Experimental Tests (FACET). This facility was capable of delivering 20\u00a0GeV, 3\u00a0nC electron (and positron) beams with short bunch lengths and small spot sizes, ideal for beam-driven plasma acceleration studies.

It is sponsored by the United States Department of Energy and operated by the University of Chicago through the subordinate Fermi Forward Discovery Group LLC.\nFermilab's Main Injector, two miles (3.3 km) in circumference, is the laboratory's most powerful particle accelerator. The accelerator complex that feeds the Main Injector is under upgrade, and construction of the first building for the new PIP-II linear accelerator began in 2020. Until 2011, Fermilab was the home of the 6.28\u00a0km (3.90\u00a0mi) circumference Tevatron accelerator. The ring-shaped tunnels of the Tevatron and the Main Injector are visible from the air and by satellite.\nFermilab aims to become a world center in neutrino physics. It is the host of the multi-billion dollar Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) now under construction. The project has suffered delays and, in 2022, the journals \"Science\" and \"Scientific American\" each published articles describing the project as \"troubled\".\nOngoing neutrino experiments are ICARUS (Imaging Cosmic and Rare Underground Signals) and NO\u03bdA (NuMI Off-Axis \u03bde Appearance). Completed neutrino experiments include MINOS (Main Injector Neutrino Oscillation Search), MINOS+, MiniBooNE and SciBooNE (SciBar Booster Neutrino Experiment) and MicroBooNE (Micro Booster Neutrino Experiment).\nOn-site experiments outside of the neutrino program include the SeaQuest fixed-target experiment and Muon g-2. Fermilab continues to participate in the work at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC); it serves as a Tier 1 site in the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid. Fermilab also pursues research in quantum information science. It founded the Fermilab Quantum Institute in 2019. Since 2020, it also is home to the SQMS (Superconducting Quantum Materials and Systems) Center.\nDue to serious performance issues over the period of a decade, the Department of Energy established new management for Fermilab on January 1, 2025. Fermilab is currently managed by the Fermi Forward Discovery Group, LLC (FFDG). This consortium is led by the 2007-2024 management group, the Fermi Research Alliance (FRA), with Amentum Environment &amp; Energy, Inc., and Longenecker &amp; Associates as new additions. Due to the management crisis, the Director of the Laboratory, Lia Merminga, resigned on January 13, 2025 and is temporarily replaced by Acting Director Young-Kee Kim, from the University of Chicago.\nFermilab is a part of the Illinois Technology and Research Corridor. Argonne National Laboratory, which is another US DOE national laboratory, is located approximately away.\nAsteroid 11998 Fermilab is named in honor of the laboratory.\nHistory.\nWeston, Illinois, was a community next to Batavia voted out of existence by its village board in 1966 to provide a site for Fermilab.\nThe laboratory was founded in 1969 as the National Accelerator Laboratory; it was renamed in honor of Enrico Fermi in 1974. The laboratory's first director was Robert Rathbun Wilson, under whom the laboratory opened ahead of time and under budget. Many of the sculptures on the site are of his creation. He is the namesake of the site's high-rise laboratory building, whose unique shape has become the symbol for Fermilab and which is the center of activity on the campus.\nAfter Wilson stepped down in 1978 to protest the lack of funding for the lab, Leon M. Lederman took on the job. It was under his guidance that the original accelerator was replaced with the Tevatron, an accelerator capable of colliding protons and antiprotons at a combined energy of 1.96 TeV. Lederman stepped down in 1989 and remained director emeritus until his death. The science education center at the site was named in his honor.\nLaboratory directors.\nSince its founding in 1967, Fermilab has been led by 7 directors.\nAccelerators.\nTevatron.\nPrior to the startup in 2008 of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) near Geneva, Switzerland, the Tevatron was the most powerful particle accelerator in the world, accelerating protons and antiprotons to energies of 980\u00a0GeV, and producing proton-antiproton collisions with energies of up to 1.96\u00a0TeV, the first accelerator to reach one \"tera-electron-volt\" energy. At , it was the world's fourth-largest particle accelerator in circumference. One of its most important achievements was the 1995 discovery of the top quark, announced by research teams using the Tevatron's CDF and D\u00d8 detectors. It was shut down in 2011.\nFermilab Accelerator Complex.\nSince 2013, the first stage in the acceleration process (pre-accelerator injector) in the Fermilab chain of accelerators takes place in two ion sources which ionize hydrogen gas. The gas is introduced into a container lined with molybdenum electrodes, each a matchbox-sized, oval-shaped cathode and a surrounding anode, separated by 1\u00a0mm and held in place by glass ceramic insulators. A cavity magnetron generates a plasma to form the ions near the metal surface. The ions are accelerated by the source to 35\u00a0keV and matched by low energy beam transport (LEBT) into the radio-frequency quadrupole (RFQ) which applies a 750\u00a0keV electrostatic field giving the ions their second acceleration. At the exit of RFQ, the beam is matched by medium energy beam transport (MEBT) into the entrance of the linear accelerator (linac).\nThe next stage of acceleration is a linear particle accelerator (linac). This stage consists of two segments. The first segment has five drift tube cavities, operating at 201\u00a0MHz. The second stage has seven\u00a0side-coupled cavities, operating at 805\u00a0MHz. At the end of linac, the particles are accelerated to 400\u00a0MeV, or about 70% of the speed of light. Immediately before entering the next accelerator, the H\u2212 ions pass through a carbon foil, becoming H+ ions (protons).\nThe resulting protons then enter the booster ring, a circumference circular accelerator whose magnets bend beams of protons around a circular path. The protons travel around the Booster about 20,000\u00a0times in 33\u00a0milliseconds, adding energy with each revolution until they leave the Booster accelerated to 8\u00a0GeV. In 2021, the lab announced that its latest superconducting YBCO magnet could increase field strength at a rate of 290 tesla per second, reaching a peak magnetic field strength of around 0.5 tesla.\nThe final acceleration is applied by the Main Injector [circumference ], which is the smaller of the two rings in the last picture below (foreground). Completed in 1999, it has become Fermilab's \"particle switchyard\" in that it can route protons to any of the experiments installed along the beam lines after accelerating them to 120\u00a0GeV. Until 2011, the Main Injector provided protons to the antiproton ring [circumference ] and the Tevatron for further acceleration but now provides the last push before the particles reach the beam line experiments.\nProton improvement plan.\nRecognizing higher demands of proton beams to support new experiments, Fermilab began to improve their accelerators in 2011. Expected to continue for many years, the project has two phases: Proton Improvement Plan (PIP) and Proton Improvement Plan-II (PIP-II).\nThe overall goals of PIP are to increase the repetition rate of the Booster beam from 7\u00a0Hz to 15\u00a0Hz and replace old hardware to increase reliability of the operation. Before the start of the PIP project, a replacement of the pre-accelerator injector was underway. The replacement of almost 40\u00a0year-old Cockcroft\u2013Walton generators to RFQ started in 2009 and completed in 2012. At the Linac stage, the analog beam position monitor (BPM) modules were replaced with digital boards in 2013. A replacement of Linac vacuum pumps and related hardware is expected to be completed in 2015. A study on the replacement of 201\u00a0MHz drift tubes is still ongoing. At the boosting stage, a major component of the PIP is to upgrade the Booster ring to 15\u00a0Hz operation. The Booster has 19\u00a0radio frequency stations. Originally, the Booster stations were operating without solid-state drive system which was acceptable for 7\u00a0Hz but not 15\u00a0Hz operation. A demonstration project in 2004 converted one of the stations to solid state drive before the PIP project. As part of the project, the remaining stations were converted to solid state in 2013. Another major part of the PIP project is to refurbish and replace 40\u00a0year-old Booster cavities. Many cavities have been refurbished and tested to operate at 15\u00a0Hz. The completion of cavity refurbishment is expected in 2015, after which the repetition rate can be gradually increased to 15\u00a0Hz operation. A longer term upgrade is to replace the Booster cavities with a new design. The research and development of the new cavities is underway, with replacement expected in 2018.\nThe goals of PIP-II include a plan to delivery 1.2\u00a0MW of proton beam power from the Main Injector to the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment target at 120\u00a0GeV and the power near 1\u00a0MW at 60\u00a0GeV with a possibility to extend the power to 2\u00a0MW in the future. The plan should also support the current 8\u00a0GeV experiments including Mu2e, Muon g\u22122, and other short-baseline neutrino experiments. These require an upgrade to the Linac to inject to the Booster with 800\u00a0MeV. The first option considered was to add 400\u00a0MeV \"afterburner\" superconducting Linac at the tail end of the existing 400\u00a0MeV. This would have required moving the existing Linac up . However, there were many technical issues with this approach. Instead, Fermilab is building a new 800\u00a0MeV superconducting Linac to inject to the Booster ring.\nConstruction of the first building for the PIP-II accelerator began in 2020. The new Linac site will be located on top of a small portion of Tevatron near the Booster ring in order to take advantage of existing electrical and water, and cryogenic infrastructure. The PIP-II Linac will have low energy beam transport line (LEBT), radio frequency quadrupole (RFQ), and medium energy beam transport line (MEBT) operated at the room temperature at with a 162.5\u00a0MHz and energy increasing from 0.03\u00a0MeV. The first segment of Linac will be operated at 162.5\u00a0MHz and energy increased up to 11\u00a0MeV. The second segment of Linac will be operated at 325\u00a0MHz and energy increased up to 177\u00a0MeV. The last segment of linac will be operated at 650\u00a0MHz and will have the final energy level of 800\u00a0MeV.\nAs of 2022, the estimated PIP-II accelerator start date for the accelerator is 2028. The project was approved for construction in April 2022 with an expected cost to the Department of Energy of $978M and with an additional $330M in contributions from international partners.\nExperiments.\nDiscoveries by Fermilab experiments.\nThe following particles were first directly observed at Fermilab:\nIn 1999, physicists at on the KTeV experiment were also the first to observe direct CP violation in kaon decays.\nThe D\u00d8 experiment and CDF experiment each made important contributions to the observation of the Higgs Boson, announced in 2012.\nEvolution of the post-Tevatron experimental program.\nFermilab dismantled the CDF (Collider Detector at Fermilab) experiment to make the space available for IARC (Illinois Accelerator Research Center).\nFermilab physicists continue to play a key role in the world-wide collider program.\nThe LHC Physics Center (LPC) at Fermilab is a regional center of the Compact Muon Solenoid Collaboration (the experiment is housed at CERN). The LPC offers a vibrant community of CMS scientists from the US and plays a major role in the CMS detector commissioning, and in the design and development of the detector upgrade. Fermilab is the host laboratory for USCMS, which includes researchers from 50 U.S. universities including 715 students. Fermilab hosts the largest CMS Tier 1 computing center, handling approximately 40% of global CMS Tier 1 computing requests. On February 9, 2022, Fermilab's Patricia McBride (physicist) was elected spokesperson of the CMS collaboration.\nDuring this time-frame, the laboratory also established a new program in research in cutting-edge information science, including the development of quantum teleportation technology for the quantum internet and increasing the lifetime of superconducting resonators for use in quantum computers.\nOn-site program in the 2020s.\nThe on-site program in the 2020s is largely focused on the \"Intensity Frontier\" of particle physics, especially neutrino physics and rare physics searches using muons. A program exploring nucleon structure is also continuing.\nLBNF/DUNE.\nFermilab strives to become the world leader in neutrino physics through the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment at the Long Baseline Neutrino Facility. Other leaders are CERN, which leads in Accelerator physics with the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), and Japan, which has been approved to build and lead the International Linear Collider (ILC). Fermilab will be the site of LBNF's future beamline, and the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF), in Lead, SD, is the site selected to house the massive far detector. The term \"baseline\" refers to the distance between the neutrino source and the detector. The far detector current design is for four modules of instrumented liquid argon with a fiducial volume of 10 kilotons each.\nAccording to the 2016 Conceptual Design Report, the first two modules were expected to be complete in 2024, with the beam operational in 2026. The final modules were planned to be operational in 2027. In 2022, the cost for two far detector modules and the beam, alone, had risen to $3B. This led to a decision by the Department of Energy Office of Science to phase the experiment. Phase I would consist of two modules, to be completed in 2028\u201329, and the beamline, to be completed in 2032. The installation of phase II, the remaining two far detector modules, is not yet planned and will be at a cost above the $3B estimate for phase I.\nA large prototype detector constructed at CERN took data with a test beam from 2018 to 2020. The results show that ProtoDUNE performed with greater than 99% efficiency.\nLBNF/DUNE program in neutrino physics plans to measure fundamental physical parameters with high precision and to explore physics beyond the Standard Model. The measurements DUNE will make are expected to greatly increase the physics community's understanding of neutrinos and their role in the universe, thereby better elucidating the nature of matter and anti-matter. It will send the world's highest-intensity neutrino beam to a near detector on the Fermilab site and the far detector 800 miles (1300\u00a0km) away at SURF.\nAbout other neutrino experiments.\nThe MiniBooNE detector was a diameter sphere containing 800 tons of mineral oil lined with 1,520 phototube detectors. An estimated 1 million neutrino events were recorded each year. SciBooNE sat in the same neutrino beam as MiniBooNE but had fine-grained tracking capabilities. The NO\u03bdA experiment uses, and the MINOS experiment used, Fermilab's NuMI (Neutrinos at the Main Injector) beam, which is an intense beam of neutrinos that travels through the Earth to the Soudan Mine in Minnesota and the Ash River, Minnesota, site of the NO\u03bdA far detector. In 2017, the ICARUS neutrino experiment was moved from CERN to Fermilab. MicroBooNE was a LArTPC experiment that ran from 2015 to 2021, collecting data from the booster neutrino beam (BNB). The SBND experiment is the newest LArTPC neutrino experiment built by Fermilab, and serves as and important precursor to the DUNE experiment. SBND was commissioned starting early 2024 and started taking physics data in December 2024, with plans to run until early 2028.\nMuon g\u22122.\nMuon g\u22122: (pronounced \"gee minus two\") is a particle physics experiment to measure the anomaly of the magnetic moment of a muon to a precision of 0.14\u00a0ppm, which will be a sensitive test of the Standard Model.\nFermilab is continuing an experiment conducted at Brookhaven National Laboratory to measure the anomalous magnetic dipole moment of the muon.\nThe magnetic dipole moment (\"g\") of a charged lepton (electron, muon, or tau) is very nearly 2. The difference from 2 (the \"anomalous\" part) depends on the lepton, and can be computed quite exactly based on the current Standard Model of particle physics. Measurements of the electron are in excellent agreement with this computation. The Brookhaven experiment did this measurement for muons, a much more technically difficult measurement due to their short lifetime, and detected a tantalizing, but not definitive, 3\u00a0\"\u03c3\" discrepancy between the measured value and the computed one.\nThe Brookhaven experiment ended in 2001, but 10\u00a0years later Fermilab acquired the equipment, and is working to make a more accurate measurement (smaller\u00a0\"\u03c3\") which will either eliminate the discrepancy or, hopefully, confirm it as an experimentally observable example of physics beyond the Standard Model.\nCentral to the experiment is a 50\u00a0foot-diameter superconducting magnet with an exceptionally uniform magnetic field. This was transported, in one piece, from Brookhaven in Long Island, New York, to Fermilab in the summer of 2013. The move traversed 3,200\u00a0miles over 35\u00a0days, mostly on a barge down the East Coast and up the Mississippi.\nThe magnet was refurbished and powered on in September\u00a02015, and has been confirmed to have the same (0.13%) p-p basic magnetic field uniformity that it had before the move.\nThe project worked on shimming the magnet to improve its magnetic field uniformity. This had been done at Brookhaven, but was disturbed by the move and had to be re-done at Fermilab.\nIn 2018, the experiment started taking data at Fermilab. In 2021, the laboratory reported that results from initial study involving the particle challenged the Standard Model, with the potential for discovery of new forces and particles.\nIn August 2023, the Fermilab group said they may be getting closer to proving the existence of a new force of nature. They have found more evidence that sub-atomic particles, called muons, are not behaving in the way predicted by the current theory of sub-atomic physics.\nDelays, cost overruns, safety failures, and management turmoil in the 2010s and 2020s.\nStarting in the 2010s, delays and cost over-runs led to substantial concerns about mismanagement of the laboratory.\nOversight issues that developed between 2014 and 2024.\nIn 2014, the Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel (\"P5\") recommended three major initiatives for construction on the Fermilab site. Two were particle physics experiments: the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment and Mu2e. The third was the PIPII accelerator upgrade described above. P5 also recommended Fermilab participation in LHC at CERN.\nAs of 2022, two P5-recommended Fermilab projects had suffered substantial delays:\nEven smaller experiments, below the cost-level of individual P5 approval, that were proposed at the time of the 2014 P5 suffered considerable delay. The Short-Baseline Near Detector (SBND) that was proposed in 2014 with a $10M cost scale was originally scheduled for data taking in spring 2018, but is now scheduled to begin in autumn 2023.\nThe Department of Energy raised flags as early as Fiscal Year (FY) 2019. Each year, the US Department of Energy Office of Science reviews and grades the national laboratories in its portfolio on eight performance metrics. Fermilab has received the lowest grades among the national laboratories in FY2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022. A rare C grade was assigned for project management in 2021, reflective of the delays and cost overruns. In an article in the journal \"Science\", James Decker, who was principal deputy director of DOE's Office of Science from 1973 to 2007, stated that the performance evaluation for 2021 was \"one of the most scathing I have seen\".\nIn 2020, the high-energy physics community expressed concern that the cost of major projects at Fermilab have led to diversion of funds from the high-energy physics core research program, harming the health of the field. Congress increased the annual HEP budget from less than $800 million by about $250M to more than $1 billion\u2014a 30% increase that went mainly to support large projects at Fermilab.\nThe Fermilab project delays led to substantial change in leadership in 2022. In September 2021, Nigel Lockyer, Director of Fermilab, resigned. Lockyer was replaced by Lia Merminga, head of the PIP II project. On March 31, 2022, James Siegrist, associate director for High Energy Physics in the Department of Energy Office of Science, who had overseen the response to the P5 report, stepped down. \nIn September 2022, it was announced that deputy director for Research Joseph Lykken would step down, to be replaced by Yale Professor Bonnie Fleming, who previously served as Deputy Chief Research Officer for the neutrino program at Fermilab.\nRegina (Gina) Rameika joined the DOE's Office of Science as the associate director for the Office of High Energy Physics in his place on November 7, 2022, moving from her role as spokesperson of the DUNE Experiment.\nAlthough these replacements represent a substantial turn-over of the top ranks, the new management was drawn from the 2014-2022 management team and Fermilab has continued to suffer turmoil since this change-over. In particular,\nnew issues arose with regard to safety and access of employees, visitors and contractors.\nOn May 25, 2023, a contractor fell 23 ft while attempting to secure reinforcing bars on a wall for the new PIP II project site. The contractor was air-lifted to hospital in an accident considered the worst on site in decades. A DOE-appointed Accident Investigation Board concluded that the incident was preventable and \"recommended a long list of managerial and safety controls needed to prevent a recurrence of such an accident.\" As a result of the accident, the $1B PIP II project that is crucial for the success of the DUNE Experiment was delayed.\nOn September 1, 2023, Chief Research Officer Bonnie Fleming announced that the Fermilab accelerator system was temporarily shut down for safety reasons. On September 9, 2022, DOE issued order DOE O 420.2D entitled \"Safety of Accelerators\". This document establishes the accelerator-specific safety requirements for DOE-funded accelerators and their operations. While other national labs continued operations while working to bring their safety requirements into compliance, Fermilab chose to suspend operations until the lab was fully compliant with the new order. The Fermilab Main Accelerator resumed running after the DOE O 420.2D implementation was complete, in late spring, 2024.\nIn mid-2024, Fermilab faced a budget shortfall. This resulted in an initial furlough of employees and closure of its operations and public access for one week in August. The need for a furlough was surprising since the budget grew \"a hefty 7.6% to $739 million\" in fiscal year (FY) 2024. According to the journal \"Science\", the crisis stemmed from poorly managed growth: \"from 2022 to 2023 alone, [laboratory staff] grew by 176 members, or 9%, to 2160.\" The furlough did not fully address the budget deficit, and in November, 2.5% of the workforce was laid off. Despite this, Tracy Marc, head of Fermilab's media services, told WTTW News that \"the overall financial health of the laboratory remains intact and is being managed\".\n2024 Whistleblower Report.\nOn July 15, 2024, a report containing allegations of cover-ups at the laboratory was uploaded to the arXiv physics preprint server. The allegations, which were also reported in the press, included:\nThe report also recounted a litany of complaints concerning day-to-day running of the laboratory that have been reported in this article, above, as well as a new claim of \"PIP-II contingency overruns within one year from CD3 approval\" that could potentially impact the LBNF/DUNE program.\nFor credibility, the report provided detailed eye-witness accounts to support the allegations. Beyond that, some information was previously publicly reported. For example, the first allegation concerning an egregious case of sexual harassment was reported in \"The Guardian\" and the fact that the claimant had submitted a complaint to Fermilab which took no action appeared in court documents.\nScientists expressed fear of retribution by Fermilab leadership. In order for the whistleblowers to remain anonymous, the report was uploaded to the arXiv preprint server by Giorgio Bellettini, a respected leader in the field of particle physics who served as spokesman of the collaboration for the Collider Detector at Fermilab twice. A second signed letter of support from William Barletta of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology was also included.\nThe report was delivered to the deputy director for Operations of the DOE Office of Science Dr. Juston Fontaine and the DOE Under Secretary for Science and Innovation Geraldine Richmond in June 2024. It was released to the public one month later, after DOE officials did not respond. On July 29, 2024, Fermilab Director Lia Merminga issued a terse response to concerned scientists, saying: \"The [whistleblower] document asserts various challenges at Fermilab, some of which are inaccurate, and others of which [the Fermi Research Alliance] has been working hard to address for some time.\" At an All Hands Meeting, Merminga allegedly also told scientific staff to \"stop whining.\"\nNew Management in 2025 by the Fermi Forward Discovery Group, LLC.\nIn view of the many issues facing the laboratory, in January 2023, the DOE announced a two-year process to rebid the contract for the management of the laboratory due to the performance issues. The DOE announcement of the competition explained: \"the purpose of this contract competition is to solicit and award a new M&amp;O contract that will result in improved contractor performance and efficiencies at FNAL. DOE expects that this competition will elicit new and innovative approaches for planning the Laboratory's future.\" At an informational meeting for potential bidders on March 1, 2023, the presentation slides expanded upon issues under \"Major Challenges/Risks\" including highlighting the concern: \"The Laboratory continues to have challenges in Financial Management and Acquisition Management. Audits repeatedly highlight the same deficiencies and control failures year after year. Any corrective actions implemented have resulted in little to no progress. Significant procurement issues have hindered the laboratory's ability to successfully deliver efficient and effective business systems/resources to enable the Science Mission. Substantial concerns remain regarding the ability to expend Government funds in an effective, efficient, and compliant manner.\"\nThe myriad issues facing a new contractor were listed in January 2024 in the news section of the journal \"Nature\".\nOn October 1, 2024, the Department of Energy awarded the contract to operate Fermi National Accelerator to the newly-formed Fermi Forward Discovery Group, LLC (FFDG).\u00a0 \u00a0The FFDG represents an incremental change in management from the previous decade because the group includes the past management team for the laboratory, the FRA, that consisted of the University of Chicago and the Universities Research Association (URA). There are two additions: Amentum Environment &amp; Energy, Inc., which specializes in advanced engineering, and Longenecker &amp; Associates, which specializes in project management.\u00a0 \u00a0 Thus, the selection left the scientific and human resources management unchanged, but did strengthen expertise to deliver large projects.\u00a0\nThe FFDG assumed management of Fermilab operations on January 1, 2025, with a five-year contract.\nOn January 13, 2025, \nDirector Lia Merminga resigned. No reason was provided, however reporters from the American Institute of Physics (AIP) hypothesized the final straw was the failing 2024 \"report card\" from the Department of Energy publicly released just as the FFDG assumed management. The AIP reported: \"[In 2024,] the Department of Energy gave the lab its lowest marks since the current lab appraisal process began in 2006. The lab failed to meet expectations in five out of eight categories, including two C+ grades in program management and contractor leadership and a C in business systems. (The DOE Office of Science defines a B+ grade and above as meeting expectations.)\"\nYoung-Kee Kim, Albert A. Michelson Distinguished Service Professor of Physics at the University of Chicago, is serving as Acting Director during the search for a replacement. Kim previously served as Deputy Director of Fermilab from 2006-2013.\nSite.\nAccess.\nFermi National Accelerator Laboratory (aka Fermilab) was founded in 1967 as an open science research laboratory, and, to this day, does not conduct classified research. The initial plans called for Fermilab to employ a guard force \"...to control movement of personnel onto the site when tests are being conducted\" as noted in the December 1971 Environmental Statement and \"..to enforce the site boundary\". Early leadership moved toward greater public openness allowing for ease of scientific collaboration and public enjoyment to include the relocated bison herd.\nIn the late 2010s and early 2020s, the management of Fermilab began to introduce severe restrictions on access to the Fermilab site by the public and by scientists. By spring 2023, the restrictions had become so onerous that more than 2500 physicists and visitors to the laboratory signed an \"open petition to elected representatives to reopen Fermilab.\" The petition stated that: \"The access policy changes undermine critical aspects of the scientific process as well as the basic functioning of Fermilab. Hosting research meetings, interviewing prospective employees, collaborating with scientists outside the lab, and enacting our famously impactful education programs have all been hindered.\" With respect to the general public, the petition stated: \"Today, the general public is only permitted to access the main road, and with ID requirements that are becoming increasingly stringent, soon its doors will be closed to tourists and even to some immigrants. We can no longer drive or bike around the premises freely. The dog park, Wilson Hall with its exhibits on the top floor, and other areas are no longer generally accessible. Fishing and other activities open to the public have been canceled.\" The petition emphatically requested that access policies be reverted to the open laboratory model that governed the laboratory prior to 2020.\nIn May 2023, Director Lia Merminga posted a response to the petition on the Fermilab website, noting that\nsome areas on site remain open to the public during specific hours with ID access requirements. Merminga's response justifies the new restrictions because the lab \"manage[s] a large amount of non-public information\"---reasoning that conflicts with the petition that points out that the lab is fully tax-payer funded, does no classified research, and has a government mandate to publish all of its scientific results. Further coverage of the petition and the management response appeared in the magazines \"Physics Today\" and \"Physics World\".\nIn keeping with Real ID requirements for DOE facilities, all unescorted adult visitors entering the site must present a government-issued photo ID compliant with the Real ID Act. Up-to-date specifics about access can be found on the Fermilab website.\nArchitecture.\nFermilab's first director, Robert Wilson, insisted that the site's aesthetic complexion not be marred by a collection of concrete block buildings. The design of the administrative building (Wilson Hall) was inspired by St.\u00a0Pierre's Cathedral in Beauvais, France, though it was realized in a Brutalist style. Several of the buildings and sculptures within the Fermilab reservation represent various mathematical constructs as part of their structure.\nThe Archimedean Spiral is the defining shape of several pumping stations as well as the building housing the MINOS experiment. The reflecting pond at Wilson Hall also showcases a hyperbolic obelisk, designed by Wilson. Some of the high-voltage transmission lines carrying power through the laboratory's land are built to echo the Greek letter \u03c0. One can also find structural examples of the DNA double-helix spiral and a nod to the geodesic sphere.\nWilson's sculptures on the site include \"Tractricious\", a free-standing arrangement of steel tubes near the Industrial Complex constructed from parts and materials recycled from the Tevatron collider, and the soaring \"Broken Symmetry\", which greets those entering the campus via the Pine Street entrance. Crowning the Ramsey Auditorium is a representation of the M\u00f6bius strip with a diameter of more than . Also scattered about the access roads and village are a massive hydraulic press and old magnetic containment channels, all painted blue.\nWildlife.\nIn 1967, Wilson brought five American bison to the site, a bull and four cows, and an additional 21 were provided by the Illinois Department of Conservation. Some fearful locals believed at first that the bison were introduced in order to serve as an alarm if and when radiation at the laboratory reached dangerous levels, but they were assured by Fermilab that this claim had no merit. Today, the Fermilab bison herd is a popular attraction that draws many visitors and the grounds are also a sanctuary for other local wildlife populations. A Christmas Bird Count has occurred at the lab every year since 1976.\nWorking with the Forest Preserve District of DuPage County, Fermilab has introduced barn owls to selected structures around the grounds.\nTritium on site.\nDuring running, particle beams produce tritium, an isotope of hydrogen consisting of a proton and two neutrons that is weakly radioactive with a half-life of 12.3 years. This can bind with oxygen to form tritiated water. Tritium levels measured on site are low compared to federal health and environmental standards. Fermilab monitors tritium leaving the site in surface and sewer water, and provides an FAQ sheet for those who want to learn more.\nAt an informational meeting for potential bidders for the management contract, held on March 1, 2023, the presentation slides indicated that although the rate of tritium leaving site is below the required standards, there is sufficient tritium contamination on site to represent a \"challenge\". In particular, tritium produced in the NuMI beamline that sends neutrinos to experiments in Minnesota has been pumped into the industrial water cooling system that is used for equipment across the Fermilab campus. As a result, it is concluded that now \"tritium contamination is largely throughout the research complex.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Nuuk is the seat of government and the territory's largest cultural and economic center. It is also the seat of government for the Sermersooq municipality. In January 2025, it had a population of 20,113\u2014more than a third of the territory's population\u2014making it one of the smallest capital cities in the world by population.\nThe city was founded in 1728 by the Danish-Norwegian missionary Hans Egede when he relocated from the earlier Hope Colony (), where he had arrived in 1721; the governor Claus Paarss was part of the relocation. The new colony was placed at the Inuit settlement of N\u00fbk and named \"Godthaab\" (\"Good Hope\"). \"Nuuk\" is the Greenlandic word for \"cape\" and is commonly found in Greenlandic place names. It is so named because of its position at the end of the Nuup Kangerlua fjord on the Labrador Sea's eastern shore. Its latitude, at 64\u00b011' N, makes it the world's northernmost capital, a few kilometres farther north than Reykjav\u00edk. When home rule was established in 1979, the authorization of place names was transferred to Greenlandic authorities, who preferred Greenlandic names to Danish ones. The name \"Godth\u00e5b\" mostly went out of use over the next two decades.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistory.\nThe site has a long history of habitation. The area around Nuuk was first occupied by the ancient, pre-Inuit, Paleo-Eskimo people of the Saqqaq culture as far back as 2200 BCE, when they lived in the area around the now abandoned settlement of Qoornoq. For a long time, it was occupied by the Dorset culture around the former settlement of Kangeq, but they disappeared from the Nuuk district before 1000 AD. The Nuuk area was then inhabited by Norse settlers from around 1000 until the disappearance of the settlement for uncertain reasons during the 15th century.\nThe city proper was founded as the fort of Godt-Haab in 1728 by the royal governor Claus Paarss, when he relocated the missionary and merchant Hans Egede's earlier Hope Colony () from Kangeq Island to the mainland. At that time, Greenland was formally still a Norwegian colony under the united Danish-Norwegian Crown, but the colony had not had any contact for over three centuries. Paarss's colonists were mutinous soldiers, convicts, and prostitutes; within the first year, most died of scurvy and other ailments. In 1733 and 1734, a smallpox epidemic killed most of the native population as well as Egede's wife. Hans Egede returned to Denmark in 1736 after 15 years in Greenland, leaving his son Poul to continue his work. Godthaab became the seat of government for the Danish colony of South Greenland, while Godhavn (modern Qeqertarsuaq) was the capital of North Greenland until 1940, when the administration was unified in Godthaab.\nIn 1733, Moravian missionaries received permission to begin a mission on the island; in 1747, there were enough converts to prompt the construction of the Moravian Brethren Mission House and the formal establishment of the mission as New Herrnhut (). This became the nucleus of present-day Nuuk as many Greenlanders from the southeastern coast left their territory to live at the mission station. From this base, further missions were established at Lichtenfels (1748), Lichtenau (1774), Friedrichsthal (1824), Umanak (1861), and Idlorpait (1864), before they were discontinued in 1900 and folded into the Lutheran Church of Denmark.\nIn 1853, Hinrich Johannes Rink came to Greenland and was surprised at how local Greenlandic culture and identity had been suppressed under Danish influence. In response, in 1861, he started the \"Atuagagdliutit\", Greenland's first newspaper, with a native Greenlander as editor. This newspaper based in Nuuk later became an important token of Greenlandic identity.\nDuring World War II, there was a reawakening of Greenlandic national identity. The use of written Greenlandic grew, and a council was assembled under Eske Brun's leadership in Nuuk. In 1940, an American and a Canadian Consulate were established in Nuuk.\nUnder new regulations in 1950, two councils amalgamated into one. This Countryside Council was abolished on 1 May 1979, when the Greenland Home Rule government renamed the city of Godth\u00e5b to Nuuk. The city boomed during the 1950s when Denmark began to modernize Greenland. As in Greenland as a whole, Nuuk is populated today by both Inuit and Danes. Over a third of Greenland's total population lives in the Nuuk Greater Metropolitan area.\nAccording to a 2016 article in \"The Guardian\" examining indigenous influences on cities worldwide:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;One city... stands out. Nuuk... has probably the highest percentage of aboriginal people of any city: almost 90% of Greenland's population of 58,000 is Inuit, and at least eight in 10 live in urban settlements. Nuuk also celebrates Inuit culture and history to an extent that is unprecedented in many cities with higher total aboriginal populations. By proportion and by cultural authority and impact, it may well be tiny Nuuk that is the most indigenous city in the world.\nGeography.\nNuuk is located at approximately at the mouth of the Nuup Kangerlua fjord (formerly Baal's River), from the shores of the Labrador Sea on Greenland's southwestern coast and about south of the Arctic Circle. The fjord flows to the northwest, then turns southwest at , splitting into three arms in its lower run, with three big islands between the arms: Sermitsiaq Island, Qeqertarsuaq Island, and Qoornuup Qeqertarsua. The fjord widens into a bay dotted with skerries near its mouth, opening into Labrador Sea at approximately . Sermitsiaq mountain, reaching a height of , to the northeast, can be seen from almost everywhere in Nuuk. The mountain has given its name to the nationwide newspaper \"Sermitsiaq\". Closer to the town are the peaks of Store Malene, , and Lille Malene, . The magnetic declination at Nuuk is extreme.\nClimate.\nNuuk has a maritime-influenced tundra climate (K\u00f6ppen ET) with long, cold, snowy winters and short, cool summers. Although the winters are very cold, they are still milder than those in other tundra climates at similar latitudes, such as Alaska or parts of Eastern Siberia. Instead, peak winter is similar to identical latitudes in the Nordic countries. On 21 December, the shortest day and longest night of the year, the sun rises at 11:22 am and sets at 3:28 pm. On 21 June, the longest day and shortest night of the year, the sun rises at 3:53 am and sets at 1:03 am, producing constant civil twilight. Nuuk occasionally has mild temperatures year-round, with each month having recorded or warmer, although only June, July, August, and September have recorded what could be considered hot weather (defined as or higher). The monthly averages range from to , whereas all-time extremes range from on 14 January 1984 to on 6 July 2008. The record wind in Nuuk is 68\u00a0km/h.\nThe average monthly temperature ( in July) is colder than what is considered the limit for trees ( during the warmest month). There are a few planted trees, which do not sustain well.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;With 19,872 inhabitants as of January 2024, Nuuk is by far Greenland's largest town. Its population has doubled since 1977, increased by over a third since 1990, and risen by almost 21% since 2000. In addition to those born in Greenland, data from 2015 showed 3,826 were born outside the country. Attracted by good employment opportunities with high wages, Danes have continued to settle in the town. Today, Nuuk has the highest proportion of Danes of any town in Greenland. Half of Greenland's immigrants live in Nuuk, which also has a quarter of the country's native population.\nGovernment.\nAs the capital of Greenland, Nuuk is its administrative center, containing all important government buildings and institutions. The public sector bodies are also the town's largest employer.\nAs of January 2021, Nuuk's mayor is Charlotte Ludvigsen. Ludvigsen is a member of the Inuit Ataqatigiit party.\nGreenland's self-government parliament, the Inatsisartut, is in Nuuk. It has 31 seats and its members are elected by popular vote on the basis of proportional representation to serve four-year terms. All of Greenland's major political parties have their headquarters in Nuuk, including the Inuit Ataqatigiit, Siumut, Democrats, Atassut, Association of Candidates, and the Women's Party.\nKANUKOKA.\nKANUKOKA () was based in Nuuk. It was an association of Greenland's municipalities, led by Enok Sandgreen. Its aim was to facilitate cooperation among all five municipalities of Greenland: Avannaata, Kujalleq, Qeqertalik, Qeqqata, and Sermersooq. But Sermersooq and Qeqertalik both withdrew and KANUKOKA dissolved on 31 July 2018. The organisation ran the municipal elections every four years, with the last election taking place in 2016. All municipal authorities in Greenland were members of the organisation until its dissolution. The association was overseen by Maliina Abelsen, the Minister for Social Affairs in the Government of Greenland.\nEconomy.\nAlthough only a small town, Nuuk has developed trade, business, shipping and other industries. It began as a small fishing settlement with a harbor, but as the economy developed rapidly during the 1970s and 1980s, Nuuk's fishing industry declined. Nuuk is nevertheless still home to almost half of Greenland's fishing fleet. The local Royal Greenland processing plant absorbs landed seafood amounting to over DKK 50 million (US$7 million) per annum, mainly (80%) shrimp, but also cod, lumpfish and halibut. Seafood, including seal, is also sold in abundance in Nuuk's fish markets, the largest being Kalaaliaraq Market. Minerals including zinc and gold have contributed to Nuuk's economic development.\nLike much of Greenland, Nuuk heavily depends on Danish investment and relies on Denmark for block funding.\nEnergy.\nAll of Greenland's electricity is supplied by the government-owned company Nukissiorfiit, which has a monopoly on it. Since 1993, Nuuk has received its electric power mainly from Buksefjord hydroelectric power plant by way of a 132\u00a0kV powerline crossing Ameralik fjord over a distance of , the world's longest free span.\nEducation.\nNuuk has several educational institutions of higher learning. The University of Greenland (Ilisimatusarfik), Greenland's only university, is in Nuuk. It was founded in 1987 and expanded in 2007 with the new building, \"Ilimmarfik\", housing departments of journalism, management and economics, language, literature and media, cultural and social history, theology and religion, and social work. Nuuk is also home to the Department of Learning (Ilinniarfissuaq), Greenland's oldest educational facility, in the old colonial part of Nuuk (\"Nuutoqaq\": Old Nuuk). Other notable educational institutions include the Department of Nursing and Health Science, Nuuk Technical College, and the Iron &amp; Metal School.\nHealthcare.\nNuuk is served by Queen Ingrid's Health Center, the regional health center for Region Sermersooq. It has an emergency room and a central clinic with several general practitioners. Nuuk also has Queen Ingrid's Hospital, Greenland's central hospital.\nTourism.\nThe Nuuk Tourist Office was built in 1992 to house the headquarters of the new National Tourist Board of Greenland.\nShopping.\nNuuk's shops offer local art and craftwork. In 2012, Greenland's first shopping center, Nuuk Center \"(NC)\", opened. The center has Greenland's first underground parking. Several supermarkets exist, such as Nuuk Center, Pisiffik, Brugseni, and Spar.\nTransportation.\nAirport.\nNuuk has an international airport northeast of the town center. Built in 1979, it was extensively rebuilt and expanded in 2024 and is now Air Greenland's international and domestic hub and base of operations. Most traffic to, from, and within Greenland passes through the airport. It is served year-round with direct flights to Copenhagen and Reykjav\u00edk-Keflav\u00edk as well as almost all airports in Greenland. Seasonal routes are also operated to New York-Newark, Billund, Aalborg, and Iqaluit\nSea.\nNuuk is connected to Denmark by the Royal Arctic Line (in cooperation with Eimskip), which sails container ships from Aalborg via Iceland. They generally bring clothing, flour, medicine, timber, machinery, and non-perishable goods, and return with deep-frozen shrimp and fish. Most sea freight to other destinations in Greenland is trans-shipped in Nuuk via Royal Arctic Line. \nNuuk is served twice a week by the coastal passenger ferry of the Arctic Umiaq Line, which links the communities of the western coast, for most of the year.\nRoads.\nAs of 2017, there are 80 km of local roads in Nuuk. No roads connect Nuuk with other parts of Greenland. Most buses and cars owned in Greenland operate in Nuuk. There are three traffic lights, 12 roundabouts, and one road tunnel in Nuuk, the only examples of such in Greenland. The city's high street is Aqqusinersuaq.\nSince 1980, the bus service Nuup Bussii provides public transport services in Nuuk. Buses link the town center with the airport, the outlying districts and neighborhoods of Nuussuaq, Qinngorput, and Qernertunnguit in Quassussuup Tungaa. In 2012, the buses transported more than 2 million passengers around the city of Nuuk.\nCityscape.\nHistorical buildings.\nHans Egede's HouseHans Egede's House, built in 1721 by the Norwegian missionary Hans Egede, is Greenland's oldest building. Standing close to the harbor among other old houses, it is now used for government receptions.\nNuuk CathedralThe Church of Our Saviour of the Lutheran diocese of Greenland was built in 1849, and the tower was added in 1884. The red building with a clock tower and steeple is a prominent site on the landscape. The church received the status of Nuuk Cathedral in 1994. The first bishop was Kristian M\u00f8rk, followed in 1995 by Sofie Petersen, a Greenland native and the second woman in Denmark to become a bishop.\nThe Herrnhut House was the center of the Moravian mission of New Herrnhut. Other landmarks include the Hans Egede Church and the Statue of Hans Egede.\nNational MuseumGreenland National Museum is in Nuuk and was one of the first museums established in Greenland, inaugurated in the mid-1960s. It has many artifacts and exhibits related to Greenland's archaeology, history, art, and handicrafts, and contains the Qilakitsoq mummies.\nModern architecture\nExamples of modern architecture include the Katuaq cultural center by Schmidt Hammer Lassen (1997), the campus of the University of Greenland by Tegnestuen Nuuk and KHR Arkitekter (2008), the Nuuk Center by KHR Arkitekter (2012), and the Anstalten Correctional Facility by Friis &amp; Moltke and Schmidt Hammer Lassen (2019).\nCultural.\nKatuaq is a cultural center used for concerts, films, art exhibitions, and conferences. It was designed by Schmidt Hammer Lassen and inaugurated on 15 February 1997. Katuaq contains two auditoria, one seating 1,008 people and the other 508. The complex also contains an art school, library, meeting facilities, administrative offices, and a caf\u00e9.\nThe Nuuk Art Museum is Greenland's only private art and crafts museum. It has a notable collection of local paintings, watercolors, drawings, and graphics, some by Andy Warhol; and figures in soapstone, ivory, and wood, with many items collected by archaeologists.\nEducational.\nIlisimatusarfik, also known as the University of Greenland, is in Nuuk and is the national university of Greenland. Most courses are taught in Danish, although a few are in Kalaallisut. As of 2007[ [update]], the university had about 150 students (almost all Greenlanders), 14 academic staff, and five administrators. Its library has about 30,000 volumes. The campus of the University of Greenland, hosting Statistics Greenland and the main holdings of the Public and National Library of Greenland, is at the district's northern end, near the road to Nuuk Airport.\nThe National Library of Greenland in Nuuk is the country's largest reference library. It is devoted to preserving Greenland's cultural heritage and history. The library holdings are split between the public library in the town center and Ilimmarfik, the campus of the University of Greenland. As of 1 January 2008, there are 83,324 items in the library database at Ilimmarfik.\nSports.\nNuuk's sports clubs include Nuuk IL (established in 1934), B-67, and GSS Nuuk. Nuuk Stadium is a multi-purpose stadium, used mostly for football games. The stadium has a capacity of 2,000. The stadium can also be used as an entertainment venue: the Scottish rock band Nazareth performed at the venue. \nNuuk also has the Godth\u00e5bhallen, a handball stadium. It is the home of the Greenland men's national handball team and has a capacity of 1,000. There is a hill for alpine skiing with an altitude difference around 300 meters on the mountain Lille Malene, with the valley station close to the airport terminal. There is also the Nuuk golf course, the only arctic golf course in the world.\nAn indoor sports centre, Inussivik, was opened in 2002.\nInternational relations.\nTwin towns and sister cities.\nNuuk is twinned with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Aalborg, Denmark \nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "53306", "revid": "49863756", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53306", "title": "Natural satellite", "text": "Astronomical body that orbits a planet\nA natural satellite is, in the most common usage, an astronomical body that orbits a planet, dwarf planet, or small Solar System body (or sometimes another natural satellite). Natural satellites are colloquially referred to as moons, a derivation from the Moon of Earth.\nIn the Solar System, there are six planetary satellite systems, altogether comprising 419 natural satellites with confirmed orbits. Seven objects commonly considered dwarf planets by astronomers are also known to have natural satellites: Orcus, Pluto, Haumea, Quaoar, Makemake, Gonggong, and Eris. As of January 2022, there are 447 other minor planets known to have natural satellites.\nTerminology.\nThe first known natural satellite was the Moon, but it was considered a \"planet\" until Copernicus' introduction of \"De revolutionibus orbium coelestium\" in 1543. Until the discovery of the Galilean satellites in 1610 there was no opportunity for referring to such objects as a class. Galileo chose to refer to his discoveries as \"Planet\u00e6\" (\"planets\"), but later discoverers chose other terms to distinguish them from the objects they orbited.\nThe first to use the term \"satellite\" to describe orbiting bodies was the German astronomer Johannes Kepler in his pamphlet \"Narratio de Observatis a se quatuor Iouis satellitibus erronibus\" (\"Narration About Four Satellites of Jupiter Observed\") in 1610. He derived the term from the Latin word \"satelles\", meaning \"guard\", \"attendant\", or \"companion\", because the \"satellites\" accompanied their primary planet in their journey through the heavens.\nThe term \"satellite\" thus became the normal one for referring to an object orbiting a planet, as it avoided the ambiguity of \"moon\". In 1957, however, the launching of the artificial object Sputnik created a need for new terminology. The terms \"man-made satellite\" and \"artificial moon\" were very quickly abandoned in favor of the simpler \"satellite\". As a consequence, the term has become linked with artificial objects flown in space.\nBecause of this shift in meaning, the term \"moon\", which had continued to be used in a generic sense in works of popular science and fiction, has regained respectability and is now used interchangeably with \"natural satellite\", even in scientific articles. When it is necessary to avoid both the ambiguity of confusion with Earth's natural satellite the Moon and the natural satellites of the other planets on the one hand, and artificial satellites on the other, the term \"natural satellite\" (using \"natural\" in a sense opposed to \"artificial\") is used. To further avoid ambiguity, the convention is to capitalize the word Moon when referring to Earth's natural satellite (a proper noun), but not when referring to other natural satellites (common nouns).\nMany authors define \"satellite\" or \"natural satellite\" as orbiting some planet or minor planet, synonymous with \"moon\"\u00a0\u2013 by such a definition all natural satellites are moons, but Earth and other planets are not satellites. A few recent authors define \"moon\" as \"a satellite of a planet or minor planet\", and \"planet\" as \"a satellite of a star\"\u00a0\u2013 such authors consider Earth as a \"natural satellite of the Sun\".\nDefinition of a moon.\nThere is no established lower limit on what is considered a \"moon\". Every natural celestial body with an identified orbit around a planet of the Solar System, some as small as a kilometer across, has been considered a moon, though objects a tenth that size within Saturn's rings, which have not been directly observed, have been called \"moonlets\". Small asteroid moons (natural satellites of asteroids), such as Dactyl, have also been called moonlets.\nThe upper limit is also vague. Two orbiting bodies are sometimes described as a double planet rather than a primary and satellite; the Earth-Moon system is used as an example. Asteroids such as 90 Antiope are considered double asteroids, but they have not forced a clear definition of what constitutes a moon. Some authors consider the Pluto\u2013Charon system to be a double (dwarf) planet, with one argument being that the barycentre lies above the surface of the larger body. In contrast, the barycenter of all planetary moons of the Solar System are located within the radius of their host planet.\nOrigin and orbital characteristics.\nThe natural satellites orbiting relatively close to the planet on prograde, uninclined circular orbits (\"regular\" satellites) are generally thought to have been formed out of the same collapsing region of the protoplanetary disk that created its primary. In contrast, irregular satellites (generally orbiting on distant, inclined, eccentric and/or retrograde orbits) are thought to be captured asteroids possibly further fragmented by collisions. Most of the major natural satellites of the Solar System have regular orbits, while most of the small natural satellites have irregular orbits. The Moon and the Moons of Pluto are exceptions among large bodies in that they are thought to have originated from the collision of two large protoplanetary objects early in the Solar System's history (see the giant impact hypothesis). The material that would have been placed in orbit around the central body is predicted to have reaccreted to form one or more orbiting natural satellites. As opposed to planetary-sized bodies, asteroid moons are thought to commonly form by this process. Triton is another exception; although large and in a close, circular orbit, its motion is retrograde and it is thought to be a captured dwarf planet.\nTrojan satellites.\nTwo natural satellites are known to have small companions at both their L4 and L5 Lagrangian points, sixty degrees ahead and behind the body in its orbit. These companions are called trojan moons, as their orbits are analogous to the trojan asteroids of Jupiter. The trojan moons are Telesto and Calypso, which are the leading and following companions, respectively, of the Saturnian moon Tethys; and Helene and Polydeuces, the leading and following companions of the Saturnian moon Dione.\nTemporary satellites.\nThe capture of an asteroid from a heliocentric orbit is not always permanent. According to simulations, temporary satellites should be a common phenomenon. , the observed minor bodies that have displayed transient co-orbital motion with Earth are: 1991 VG, , , and .\n was a temporary satellite of Earth for nine months in 2006 and 2007.\nTidal locking.\nMost regular moons (natural satellites following relatively close and prograde orbits with small orbital inclination and eccentricity) in the Solar System are tidally locked to their respective primaries, meaning that the same side of the natural satellite always faces its planet. This phenomenon comes about through a loss of energy due to tidal forces raised by the planet, slowing the rotation of the satellite until it is negligible. Exceptions are known; one such exception is Saturn's natural satellite Hyperion, which rotates chaotically because of the gravitational influence of Titan. Pluto's four, circumbinary small moons also rotate chaotically due to Charon's influence.\nIn contrast, the outer natural satellites of the giant planets (irregular satellites) are too far away to have become locked. For example, Jupiter's Himalia, Saturn's Phoebe, and Neptune's Nereid have rotation periods in the range of ten hours, whereas their orbital periods are hundreds of days.\nSatellites of satellites.\nNo \"moons of moons\" or subsatellites (natural satellites that orbit a natural satellite of a planet) are currently known. In most cases, the tidal effects of the planet would make such a system unstable. Potential exceptions include large moons on wide orbits, including Titan, Iapetus, Callisto, and the Moon. However, other sources of dynamical instability may remove such submoons, such as mascons on the Moon.\nCalculations performed after the 2008 detection of a possible ring system around Saturn's moon Rhea indicate that satellites orbiting Rhea could have stable orbits. Furthermore, the suspected rings are thought to be narrow, a phenomenon normally associated with shepherd moons. However, targeted images taken by the \"Cassini\" spacecraft failed to detect rings around Rhea.\nIt has also been proposed that Saturn's moon Iapetus had a satellite in the past; this is one of several hypotheses that have been put forward to account for its equatorial ridge.\nLight-curve analysis suggests that Saturn's irregular satellite Kiviuq is extremely prolate, and is likely a contact binary or even a binary moon.\nShape.\nNeptune's moon Proteus is the largest irregularly shaped natural satellite, and is about as large as an icy moon can become before becoming relaxed into a spheroidal shape. The shapes of moons in synchronous orbit are expected to asymptotically change shape into rounded ellipsoids under hydrostatic equilibrium, although this may not happen in the age of the Solar System. For example, the larger Saturnian moons are in equilibrium, while Iapetus, Mimas, and Enceladus are apparently not. The shapes of Eris' moon Dysnomia and Orcus' moon Vanth are presently unknown, although Dysnomia's density is high enough that it is probably a solid ellipsoid as well.\nThe larger natural satellites, being tidally locked, tend toward ovoid (egg-like) shapes: squat at their poles and with longer equatorial axes in the direction of their primaries (their planets) than in the direction of their motion. Saturn's moon Mimas, for example, has a major axis 9% greater than its polar axis and 5% greater than its other equatorial axis. Methone, another of Saturn's moons, is only around 3\u00a0km in diameter and . The effect is smaller on the largest natural satellites, where their gravity is greater relative to the effects of tidal distortion, especially those that orbit less massive planets or, as in the case of the Moon, at greater distances.\nGeological activity.\nOf the nineteen known natural satellites in the Solar System that are large enough to be gravitationally rounded, several remain geologically active today. Io is the most volcanically active body in the Solar System, while Europa, Enceladus, and Triton display evidence of ongoing tectonic activity and cryovolcanism. In the first three cases, the geological activity is powered by the tidal heating resulting from having eccentric orbits close to their giant-planet primaries. (This mechanism would have also operated on Triton in the past before its orbit was circularized.) Many other natural satellites, such as Earth's Moon, Ganymede, Titan, Tethys, and Miranda show evidence of past geological activity, resulting from energy sources such as the decay of their primordial radioisotopes, greater past orbital eccentricities (due in some cases to past orbital resonances), or the differentiation or freezing of their interiors. Enceladus and Triton both have active features resembling geysers, although in the case of Triton solar heating appears to provide the energy. Titan and Triton have significant atmospheres; Titan also has hydrocarbon lakes. All four of the Galilean moons have atmospheres, though they are extremely thin. Four of the largest natural satellites, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto, and Titan, are thought to have subsurface oceans of liquid water, while smaller Enceladus also supports a global subsurface ocean of liquid water.\nOccurrence in the Solar System.\nOf the inner planets, Mercury and Venus have no natural satellites; Earth has one large natural satellite, known as the Moon; and Mars has two tiny natural satellites, Phobos and Deimos. The giant planets have extensive systems of natural satellites, including half a dozen comparable in size to Earth's Moon: the four Galilean moons, Saturn's Titan, and Neptune's Triton. Saturn has an additional six mid-sized natural satellites massive enough to have achieved hydrostatic equilibrium, and Uranus has five. It has been suggested that some satellites may potentially harbour life.\nAmong the objects generally agreed by astronomers to be dwarf planets, Ceres and Sedna have no known natural satellites. Pluto has the relatively large natural satellite Charon and four smaller natural satellites; Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra. Haumea has two natural satellites; Orcus, Quaoar, Makemake, Gonggong, and Eris have one each. The Pluto\u2013Charon system is unusual in that the center of mass lies in open space between the two, a characteristic sometimes associated with a double-planet system.\nPlanets around other stars are likely to have satellites as well, and although numerous candidates have been detected to date, none have yet been confirmed.\nNon-planetary satellites.\nThe discovery of 243 Ida's natural satellite Dactyl in the early 1990s confirmed that some asteroids have natural satellites; indeed, 87 Sylvia has two. Some, such as 90 Antiope, are double asteroids with two comparably sized components. For astronomers, a useful aspect of an asteroid satellite is that it can be used to determine the density of the primary asteroid, without the need for a spacecraft fly-by mission.\nBesides planets and dwarf planets objects within the Solar System known to have natural satellites are 76 in the asteroid belt (five with two each), four Jupiter trojans, 39 near-Earth objects (two with two satellites each), and 14 Mars-crossers. There are also 84 known natural satellites of trans-Neptunian objects. Some 150 additional small bodies have been observed within the rings of Saturn, but only a few were tracked long enough to establish orbits.\nDimensions.\nThe seven largest natural satellites in the Solar System (those bigger than 2,500\u00a0km across) are Jupiter's Galilean moons (Ganymede, Callisto, Io, and Europa), Saturn's moon Titan, Earth's moon, and Neptune's captured natural satellite Triton. Of these, Ganymede and Titan are larger than the planet Mercury, while Callisto is about the same size. The next size group of nine mid-sized natural satellites, between 1,000\u00a0km and 1,600\u00a0km across, consists of Titania, Oberon, Rhea, Iapetus, Charon, Ariel, Umbriel, Dione, and Tethys, the smallest. As well as the natural satellites of the various planets, there are hundreds of known natural satellites of the dwarf planets, minor planets and other small Solar System bodies.\nA planet usually has at least around 10,000 times the mass of any natural satellites that orbit it, with a correspondingly much larger diameter. The Earth\u2013Moon system is a unique exception in the Solar System; at 3,474\u00a0kilometres (2,158 miles) across, the Moon is 0.273 times the diameter of Earth and about &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u204480 of its mass. The next largest ratios are the Neptune\u2013Triton system at 0.055 (with a mass ratio of about 1 to 4790), the Saturn\u2013Titan system at 0.044 (with the second mass ratio next to the Earth\u2013Moon system, 1 to 4225), the Jupiter\u2013Ganymede system at 0.038 (with a mass ratio of 12810), and the Uranus\u2013Titania system at 0.031 (with a mass ratio of 25125). For the category of dwarf planets, Charon has the largest ratio, being 0.52 the diameter and 12.2% the mass of Pluto.\nThe following is a comparative table classifying the natural satellites in the Solar System by diameter. The column on the right includes some notable planets, dwarf planets, asteroids, and trans-Neptunian objects for comparison. The natural satellites of the planets are named after mythological figures. These are predominantly Greek, except for the Uranian natural satellites, which are named after Shakespearean characters. The twenty satellites massive enough to be round are in bold in the table below. Minor planets and satellites where there is disagreement in the literature on roundness are italicized in the table below."}

About 180,000 species of the Lepidoptera have been described, representing 10% of the total described species of living organisms, making it the second largest insect order (behind Coleoptera) with 126 families and 46 superfamilies, and one of the most widespread and widely recognizable insect orders in the world.\nLepidopterans have several distinctive features, especially coloured scales that cover their bodies, large triangular wings, and a proboscis for drinking nectar. Almost all species have membranous wings. Mating and egg-laying are normally near or on host plants for the larvae. Butterflies and moths undergo complete metamorphosis. The larva is called a caterpillar; it has a cylindrical body with a well-developed head, chewing mouthparts, three pairs of legs and up to five pairs of prolegs. As it grows, it changes in appearance, going through a series of stages called instars. Once mature, it develops into a pupa. A few butterflies and many moth species spin a silk casing or cocoon for protection prior to pupating, while others just go underground. A butterfly pupa, called a chrysalis, has a hard skin, usually with no cocoon. In the pupa, metamorphosis occurs, and a sexually mature adult emerges.\nLepidopterans first appeared in the fossil record at the Triassic-Jurassic boundary. They have coevolved with flowering plants since the angiosperm boom in the Cretaceous. They have evolved a wide range of wing patterns ranging from drab moths to the brightly colored and complex-patterned butterflies. A person who studies this order is called a lepidopterist.\nButterflies and moths are mostly herbivorous as caterpillars and nectar-feeding as adults. They serve as economically useful pollinators; conversely, caterpillars are often pests in agriculture, as they can quickly consume large quantities of leaves. Females often produce up to 600 eggs.\nEtymology.\nThe term Lepidoptera was used in 1746 by Carl Linnaeus in his \"Fauna Svecica\". The word is derived from Greek , gen. (\"scale\") and (\"wing\"). \nThe word \"butterfly\" is from Old English ', possibly from the pale butter color of some species' wings. The word \"moth\" is from Old English ' from Common Germanic and German \"\" meaning \"moth\".\nThe word \"caterpillar\" is from Middle English , , probably an alteration of Old North French (from Latin , \"cat\" + , \"hairy\").\nDistribution and diversity.\nThe Lepidoptera are among the most successful groups of insects. They are found on all continents, except Antarctica, and inhabit all terrestrial habitats ranging from desert to rainforest, from lowland grasslands to mountain plateaus, but almost always associated with higher plants, especially angiosperms (flowering plants). Among the most northern dwelling species of butterflies and moths is the Siberian Apollo (\"Parnassius arcticus\"), found in the Arctic Circle in northeastern Yakutia, at an altitude of above sea level. In the Himalayas, Apollo species such as \"Parnassius epaphus\" occur up to an altitude of .\nSome species are commensal or parasitic, inhabiting the bodies of organisms rather than the environment. Coprophagous pyralid moths, called sloth moths, such as \"Bradipodicola hahneli\" and \"Cryptoses choloepi\", are unusual in that they are exclusively found the fur of sloths. Two species of \"Tinea\" moths feed and breed on the horns of cattle. The larva of \"Zenodochium coccivorella\" is an internal parasite of \"Kermes\" scale insects. Many species breed in materials such as owl pellets, bat caves, honeycombs or diseased fruit.\nAs of 2007, there were roughly 174,250 lepidopteran species described, with butterflies and skippers estimated to comprise around 17,950, and moths making up the rest. The vast majority live in the tropics, but substantial diversity exists on most continents. North America has over 700 species of butterflies and over 11,000 species of moths, while Australia has about 400 species of butterflies and 14,000 species of moths. The diversity in each faunal region has been estimated by John Heppner in 1991 based partly on actual counts from the literature, partly on the card indices in the Natural History Museum (London) and the National Museum of Natural History (Washington), and partly on estimates:\nExternal morphology.\nLepidoptera are morphologically distinguished from other orders by the presence of scales on the body and appendages, especially the wings. Butterflies and moths vary in size from microlepidoptera only a few millimeters long, to conspicuous animals with a wingspan greater than , such as Queen Alexandra's birdwing and Atlas moth.\nHead.\nThe head houses sensing organs and mouthparts. Like the adult, the larva has a toughened, or sclerotized head capsule. Here, two compound eyes, and \"chaetosema\", clusters of sensory bristles unique to Lepidoptera, occur, though many taxa have lost one or both of these clusters. The antennae vary widely in form among species and between the sexes. The antennae of butterflies are usually club-shaped, those of the skippers are hooked, while those of moths have segments variously enlarged or branched.\nThe maxillary galeae are modified to form an elongated proboscis. It consists of one to five segments, kept coiled up under the head by small muscles when it is not being used to suck up nectar from flowers.\nThe larvae, called caterpillars, have a toughened head capsule. Caterpillars lack the proboscis and have separate chewing mouthparts. These mouthparts, called mandibles, are used to chew up the plant matter that the larvae eat. The lower jaw, or labium, is weak, but may carry a spinneret, an organ used to create silk. The head is made of large lateral lobes, each having a group of up to six simple eyes.\nThorax.\nThe thorax is made of three fused segments, the prothorax, mesothorax, and metathorax, each with a pair of legs. In some males of the butterfly family Nymphalidae, the forelegs are greatly reduced and are not used for walking or perching. Lepidoptera have olfactory organs on their feet, which help them to \"taste\" or \"smell\" their food. The larva has 3 pairs of true legs, with up to 11 pairs of abdominal legs and hooklets.\nThe two pairs of wings are on the middle and third segments, or mesothorax and metathorax, respectively. In the more recent genera, the wings of the second segment are much more pronounced, while some more primitive forms have similarly sized wings of both segments. The wings are covered in scales arranged like shingles, which form an extraordinary variety of colors and patterns. The mesothorax has more powerful muscles to propel the moth or butterfly through the air, with the wing of this segment (forewing) having a stronger vein structure. The largest superfamily, the Noctuoidea, has its wings modified as hearing organs.\nThe caterpillar has an elongated, soft body that may have hair-like or other projections, three pairs of true legs, with none to 11 pairs of abdominal legs (usually eight) and hooklets, called apical crochets. The thorax usually has a pair of legs on each segment. The thorax is also lined with many spiracles on both the mesothorax and metathorax, except for a few aquatic species, which instead have a form of gills.\nAbdomen.\nThe abdomen, less sclerotized than the thorax, consists of 10 segments, the first sometimes reduced. The last two segments form the external genitalia. The genitalia are highly varied, and distinguish the species. The females of basal moths have only one sex organ, which is used for copulation and as an ovipositor, or egg-laying organ. About 98% of moth species have a separate organ for mating, and an external duct that carries the sperm from the male.\nThe abdomen of the caterpillar has four pairs of prolegs, normally located on the third to sixth segments of the abdomen, and a separate pair of prolegs by the anus, which have a pair of tiny hooks called crotchets. These aid in gripping and walking, especially in species that lack many prolegs (e. g. larvae of Geometridae). In some basal moths, these prolegs may be on every segment of the body, while prolegs may be completely absent in other groups more adapted to boring (e. g., Prodoxidae) or living in sand (e.g. Nepticulidae).\nScales.\nMuch of the body is covered with minute scales. Most are lamellar, or blade-like, and attached with a pedicel. The surface of the lamella has a complex structure. It gives color through structural coloration, and may also be pigmented.\nScales function in insulation, thermoregulation, producing pheromones (in males only), and aiding gliding flight, but the most important is the large diversity of patterns they create, enabling camouflage, mimicry, signalling to rivals, and potential mates.\nInternal morphology.\nReproductive system.\nIn the reproductive system of butterflies and moths, the male genitalia are complex. In females the three types of genitalia are named for the associated moth clades: 'monotrysian', 'exoporian', and 'ditrysian'. In the monotrysian type there is an opening on the fused segments of the sterna 9 and 10, which allows insemination and oviposition. In the exoporian type (in Hepialoidea and Mnesarchaeoidea) there are separate places for insemination and oviposition, both on the same sterna as the monotrysian type, i.e. 9 and 10. The ditrysian groups have an internal duct that carries sperm, with separate openings for copulation and egg-laying. In most species, the genitalia are flanked by two soft lobes, although they may be specialized and sclerotized in some species for ovipositing in areas such as crevices and inside plant tissue. The glands that produce hormones drive development as the insects go through their life cycles. The first insect hormone prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) operates the species life cycle and diapause. It is produced by corpora allata and corpora cardiaca, where it is stored.\nDigestive system.\nIn the digestive system, the front of the foregut is modified to form a pharyngeal sucking pump for feeding on liquids such as nectar. The esophagus leads to the posterior of the pharynx and in some species forms a form of crop. The midgut is short and straight, while the hindgut is longer and coiled. Ancestral lepidopterans, stemming from Hymenoptera, had midgut ceca, not present in current butterflies and moths. Instead, digestive enzymes, other than initial digestion, are immobilized at the surface of the midgut cells. In larvae, long-necked and stalked goblet cells are found in the anterior and posterior midgut regions, respectively. The goblet cells excrete positive potassium ions, absorbed from leaves ingested by the larvae. Most lepidopterans display the usual digestive cycle, sometimes adapted for specialised diets. Some, like the luna moth, exhibit no digestive system whatsoever; they survive as adults from stored energy consumed as larvae and live for no longer than 7\u201310 days.\nCirculatory system.\nThe circulatory system uses hemolymph, insect blood, for thermoregulation, taking heat from the muscles and transferring it to the rest of the body. In lepidopteran species, hemolymph is circulated through the veins in the wings by some form of pulsating organ, either by the heart or by the intake of air into the trachea.\nRespiratory system.\nThe respiratory system takes in air through spiracles along the sides of the abdomen and thorax, supplying the tracheae with oxygen. Three different tracheae supply and diffuse oxygen throughout the species' bodies. The dorsal tracheae supply oxygen to the dorsal musculature and vessels, while the ventral tracheae supply the ventral musculature and nerve cord, and the visceral tracheae supply the guts, fat bodies, and gonads.\nPolymorphism.\nPolymorphism is the appearance of forms or morphs which differ in color and other attributes within a species. In Lepidoptera, polymorphism can be seen both between individuals and between the sexes as sexual dimorphism, between geographically separated populations, and between generations flying at different seasons of the year (seasonal polymorphism or polyphenism). Polymorphism can be limited to one sex, typically the female.\nEnvironmental polymorphism, in which traits are not inherited, is often termed polyphenism, commonly seen in seasonal morphs, especially in the butterfly families of Nymphalidae and Pieridae. An Old World pierid butterfly, the common grass yellow (\"Eurema hecabe\") has a darker summer adult morph, triggered by a day of over 13 hours, while a shorter day induces a paler morph after the monsoon. Polyphenism also occurs in caterpillars, as in the peppered moth, \"Biston betularia\".\nGeographical isolation causes a divergence of a species into different morphs. A good example is the Indian white admiral \"Limenitis procris\", which has five forms, each geographically separated from the other by large mountain ranges. A more dramatic showcase of geographical polymorphism is the Apollo butterfly (\"Parnassius apollo\"). Because the Apollos live in small local populations, with no contact with each other, interbreeding between populations practically never occurs. They therefore form over 600 different morphs, with the size of spots on the wings varying greatly.\nSexual dimorphism is the occurrence of differences between males and females. In Lepidoptera, it is widespread and almost completely set genetically. It is present in all families of the Papilionoidea and more prominent in the Lycaenidae, Pieridae, and some of the Nymphalidae. Apart from color variation, secondary sexual characteristics may be present. Different genotypes may be expressed at the same time. Polymorphic and/or mimetic females occur in some taxa in the Papilionidae to obtain a level of protection not available to the male of their species. The most distinct case of sexual dimorphism is that of adult females of many Psychidae which have only vestigial wings, legs, and mouthparts, whereas the adult males that are strong fliers with well-developed wings and feathery antennae.\nReproduction and development.\nSpecies of Lepidoptera undergo holometabolism or \"complete metamorphosis\". Their life cycle normally consists of an egg, a larva, a pupa, and an imago or adult. The polypod larvae are commonly called caterpillars; the pupae of moths encapsulated in silk are called cocoons, while the uncovered pupa of butterflies is called a chrysalis (plural: chrysalides).\nMating.\nMales usually start eclosion (emergence) earlier than females and peak in numbers before females. Both of the sexes are sexually mature by the time of eclosion. Butterflies and moths are relatively asocial, except for migrating species. Mating begins with an adult attracting a mate, normally using visual stimuli, especially in diurnal species like most butterflies. However, the females of most nocturnal species, including almost all moth species, use pheromones to attract males, sometimes from long distances. Some species attract mates using sound, as in the polka-dot wasp moth, \"Syntomeida epilais\".\nAdaptations include having one, two or several seasonal generations, called voltinism. Most lepidopterans in temperate climates are univoltine, while in tropical climates most have two seasonal broods. Others may mate at any time of year. These adaptations are controlled by hormones, with delays in reproduction called diapause. Many species die soon after mating and laying their eggs, having only lived for a few days after eclosion. Others may still be active for several weeks, overwinter in diapause, and become active again when the weather becomes more favorable.\nLife cycle.\nEggs.\nLepidoptera usually reproduce sexually and are oviparous (egg-laying), though some give birth to live young (ovoviviparity). Some species with larvae that can eat a variety of plants simply drop their eggs in flight, as in hepialids. Most lay their eggs near or on the host, the plant on which the larvae feed. The number of eggs laid varies from a few to several thousand. The females select the host plant instinctively, primarily by chemical cues.\nThe eggs are derived from materials ingested as a larva and in some species, from the spermatophores received from males during mating. An egg can only be 1/1000 the mass of the female, yet she may lay up to her own mass in eggs. Females lay smaller eggs as they age. Larger females lay larger eggs. The egg is covered by a hard-ridged protective outer layer of shell, called the chorion. It is lined with a thin coating of wax, which prevents the egg from drying out. Each egg has micropyles, tiny funnel-shaped openings at one end, to allow sperm to enter and fertilize the egg. Butterfly and moth eggs vary greatly in size between species, but they are all either spherical or ovate.\nThe egg stage lasts a few weeks in most butterflies, but eggs laid prior to winter, especially in temperate regions, go through diapause and hatching is delayed until spring. Other temperate region butterflies lay their eggs in the spring and have them hatch in the summer (e. g. \"Nymphalis antiopa\").\nLarvae.\nThe larvae or caterpillars are the first stage in the life cycle after hatching. Caterpillars are \"characteristic larvae with cylindrical bodies, short thoracic legs, and abdominal prolegs (pseudopods)\". They have a sclerotized head capsule, mandibles (mouthparts) for chewing, and a soft tubular body. The body has three pairs of true legs, and up to five pairs of prolegs; there may be hairs or other projections. The body consists of thirteen segments, of which three are thoracic and ten are abdominal. Most larvae are herbivores, but a few are carnivores or detritivores.\nDifferent herbivorous species have adapted to feed on every part of the plant and are normally considered pests to their host plants; some species lay their eggs on fruit, others on clothing or fur (e. g., \"Tineola bisselliella\", the clothes moth). Some are carnivorous, and others are parasitic. Some lycaenid species such as \"Phengaris rebeli\" are social parasites of \"Myrmica\" ant nests. A species of Geometridae from Hawaii has carnivorous larvae that catch and eat flies. Some pyralid caterpillars are aquatic. The larvae develop rapidly with several generations in a year; however, some species may take up to 3 years to develop, and exceptional examples like \"Gynaephora groenlandica\" take as long as seven years.\nThe larvae of some butterflies and moths use mimicry to deter predators. Some caterpillars can inflate parts of their heads to appear snake-like. Many have false eye-spots to enhance this effect. Some have structures called osmeteria (family Papilionidae), exposed to produce foul-smelling defensive chemicals. Host plants often contain toxic substances; caterpillars can sequester and retain these into the adult stage. This helps make them unpalatable to birds and other predators. Such unpalatability is advertised using bright red, orange, black, or white warning colors. The toxic chemicals in plants are often evolved specifically to protect them from being eaten by insects. Insects, in turn, develop countermeasures or make use of these toxins for their own survival. This \"arms race\" has led to the coevolution of insects and their host plants.\nWing development.\nNo form of wing is externally visible on the larva, but when larvae are dissected, developing wings can be seen as disks, which can be found on the second and third thoracic segments, in place of the spiracles that are apparent on abdominal segments. Wing disks develop in association with a trachea that runs along the base of the wing, and are surrounded by a thin peripodial membrane, which is linked to the outer epidermis of the larva by a tiny duct. Wing disks are very small until the last larval instar, when they increase dramatically in size, are invaded by branching tracheae from the wing base that precede the formation of the wing veins and begin to develop patterns associated with several landmarks of the wing.\nNear pupation, the wings are forced outside the epidermis under pressure from the hemolymph, and although they are initially quite flexible and fragile, by the time the pupa breaks free of the larval cuticle, they have adhered tightly to the outer cuticle of the pupa (in obtect pupae). Within hours, the wings form a cuticle so hard and well-joined to the body that pupae can be picked up and handled without damage to the wings.\nPupa.\nAfter about five to seven instars, or molts, certain hormones, like PTTH, stimulate the production of ecdysone, which initiates insect molting. The larva starts to develop into the pupa: body parts specific to the larva, such as the abdominal prolegs, degenerate, while others such as the legs and wings undergo growth. After finding a suitable place, the animal sheds its last larval cuticle, revealing the pupal cuticle underneath.\nThe pupa may be covered in a silk cocoon, attached to a substrate, buried, or left uncovered. Features of the adult are externally recognizable in the pupa. All the appendages on the adult head and thorax are found cased inside the cuticle (antennae, mouthparts, etc.), with the wings wrapped around, adjacent to the antennae. The pupae of some species have functional mandibles.\nAlthough the pupal cuticle is highly sclerotized, some of the lower abdominal segments are not fused, and are able to move using small muscles found in between the membrane. Moving may help the pupa, for example, escape the sun, which would otherwise kill it. The pupa of the Mexican jumping bean moth (\"Cydia saltitans\") does this. The larvae cut a trapdoor in a bean (\"Sebastiania\") and use it as a shelter. With a sudden rise in temperature, the pupa inside twitches and jerks, pulling on the threads inside. Wiggling may help to deter parasitoid wasps from laying eggs on the pupa. Other moths make clicks to deter predators.\nThe length of time before the pupa emerges varies greatly. The monarch butterfly may stay in its chrysalis for two weeks, while other may stay in diapause for more than 10 months. The adult emerges either by using abdominal hooks or from projections on the head. The mandibles of the most primitive moth families are used to escape from their cocoon (e. g., Micropterigoidea).\nAdult.\nMost lepidopteran species do not live long after eclosion, only needing a few days to find a mate and then lay their eggs. Others may remain active for a longer period (from one to several weeks) or go through diapause and overwintering as monarch butterflies do, or waiting out environmental stress. Some adult species of microlepidoptera go through a stage where no reproductive-related activity occurs, lasting through summer and winter, followed by mating and oviposition in the early spring.\nWhile most butterflies and moths are terrestrial, many species of Acentropinae (Crambidae) are truly aquatic with all stages except the adult occurring in water. Many species from other families such as Erebidae, Nepticulidae, Cosmopterigidae, Tortricidae, Olethreutidae, Noctuidae, Cossidae, and Sphingidae are aquatic or semiaquatic.\nBehavior.\nFlight.\nFlight is used for evading predators, searching for food, and finding mates. It is the main form of locomotion in most species. The forewings and hindwings are mechanically coupled and flap in synchrony. Flight is driven primarily by action of the forewings. Although lepidopteran species reportedly can still fly when their hindwings are cut off, it reduces their linear flight and turning capabilities.\nSome butterflies can reach fast speeds, such as the southern dart, which can go as fast as . Sphingids are some of the fastest flying insects, some are capable of flying at over , having a wingspan of . In some species, sometimes a gliding component to their flight exists. Flight occurs either as hovering, or as forward or backward motion. In species such as hawk moths, hovering is important as they need to maintain a certain stability over flowers when feeding on the nectar.\nNavigation.\nNavigation is important to lepidopterans, especially those that migrate. Butterflies navigate using time-compensated sun compasses. They can see polarized light, so can orient even in cloudy conditions. Most migratory butterflies live in semiarid areas where breeding seasons are short. The life histories of their host plants also influence the strategies of the butterflies. Lepidoptera may use coastal lines, mountains, and even roads to orient themselves. Above sea, the flight direction is much more accurate if the coast is still visible.\nMany moths use the Earth's magnetic field to navigate. The silver Y can correct its course with changing winds, even at high altitude, and prefers flying with favourable winds. \"Aphrissa statira\" in Panama loses its navigational capacity when exposed to a magnetic field, suggesting it uses the Earth's magnetic field.\nMoths tend to circle artificial lights. This suggests they use a technique of celestial navigation called transverse orientation. By maintaining a constant angular relationship to a bright celestial light, such as the Moon, they can fly in a straight line. When a moth encounters a much closer artificial light and uses it for navigation, the angle changes rapidly; the moth attempts to correct by turning toward the light, causing it to plummet downwards, and at close range, which results in a spiral flight path.\nMigration.\nLepidopteran migration is typically seasonal, as the insects moving to escape dry seasons or other disadvantageous conditions. Most lepidopterans that migrate are butterflies, and the distance travelled varies. Some butterflies that migrate include the mourning cloak, painted lady, American lady, red admiral, and the common buckeye. A notable species of moth that migrates long distances is the bogong moth. The most well-known migrations are those of the eastern population of the monarch butterfly from Mexico to northern United States and southern Canada, a distance of about . Other well-known migratory species include the painted lady and several of the danaine butterflies. Spectacular and large-scale migrations associated with the monsoons are seen in peninsular India. Migrations have been studied in more recent times using wing tags and stable hydrogen isotopes.\nMoths such as the uraniids migrate. \"Urania fulgens\" undergoes population explosions and massive migrations that may be not surpassed by any other insect in the Neotropics. In Costa Rica and Panama, the first population movements may begin in July and early August and depending on the year, may be very massive, continuing unabated for as long as five months.\nCommunication.\nPheromones are involved in mating rituals among species, especially moths, but they are also an important aspect of other forms of communication. Usually, the pheromones are produced by one sex and detected by members of the opposite sex with their antennae. In many species, a gland between the eighth and ninth segments under the abdomen in the female produces the pheromones. Communication can also occur through stridulation, or producing sounds by rubbing parts of the body together.\nMoths engage in acoustic communication, most often as courtship, attracting mates using sound or vibration. They pick up these sounds using tympanic membranes in the abdomen. An example is that of the polka-dot wasp moth (\"Syntomeida epilais\"), which produces sounds with a frequency above that normally detectable by humans (about 20 kHz). These sounds also function as tactile communication, or communication through touch, as they stridulate, or vibrate a substrate like leaves and stems.\nMost moths lack bright colors, as many species use coloration as camouflage, but butterflies engage in visual communication. Female cabbage butterflies, for example, use ultraviolet light to communicate, with scales colored in this range on the dorsal wing surface. When they fly, each down stroke of the wing creates a brief flash of ultraviolet light which the males apparently recognize as the flight signature of a potential mate. These flashes from the wings may attract several males that engage in aerial courtship displays.\nEcology.\nMoth and butterfly caterpillars eat flowering plants, and are eaten by birds and parasitic insects. Adults are eaten by predators in many groups, such as birds, small mammals, and reptiles.\nDefense and predation.\nLepidopterans are soft bodied, fragile, and almost defenseless, while the immature stages move slowly or are immobile, hence all stages are exposed to predation. Adult butterflies and moths are preyed upon by birds, bats, lizards, amphibians, dragonflies, and spiders. \nAn \"evolutionary arms race\" can be seen between predator and prey species. Strategies for defense and protection include aposematism, mimicry, camouflage, and deimatic displays. \nSome species are poisonous, such as the monarch butterfly, \"Atrophaneura\" species, as well as \"Papilio antimachus\", and the birdwings. They obtain their toxicity by sequestering chemicals from the plants they eat. Some Lepidoptera manufacture their own toxins. Predators that eat poisonous butterflies and moths may become sick and vomit violently, learning not to eat those species, and other species with similar markings. Toxic butterflies and larvae tend to develop bright colors and striking patterns to warn predators about their toxicity (aposematism). Some caterpillars, especially members of Papilionidae, contain an osmeterium, a Y-shaped protrusible gland found in the prothoracic segment of the larvae. When threatened, the caterpillar emits unpleasant smells from the organ to ward off the predators.\nCamouflage is an important defense strategy. Some lepidopteran species blend with their surroundings, making them difficult to spot by predators. Caterpillars can exhibit shades of green that match its host plant. Caterpillars can detect the color of their surroundings using organs on their feet. Some caterpillars look like inedible objects, such as twigs or leaves, while those of some species, such as the common Mormon (\"Papilio polytes\") and the western tiger swallowtail look like bird droppings. For example, adult Sesiidae species look sufficiently similar to a wasp or hornet to ward off predators. Eyespots are a type of automimicry used by some species, deflecting predators to attack these wing patterns.\nBatesian and M\u00fcllerian mimicry complexes are commonly found in Lepidoptera. In Batesian mimicry, an edible species (the mimic) gains a survival advantage by resembling inedible species (the model). In M\u00fcllerian mimicry, two or more inedible species benefit by resembling each other so as to reduce the sampling rate by predators that need to learn about the insects' inedibility. Taxa from the toxic genus \"Heliconius\" form a well-known M\u00fcllerian complex. \nMoths can hear ultrasound emitted by bats, which causes flying moths to make evasive maneuvers because bats are a main predator of moths; a reflex action in noctuid moths cause them to drop a few inches in flight to evade attack. Tiger moths in a defense emit clicks within the same range of the bats, which interfere with the bats and foil their attempts to echolocate it.\nPollination.\nSome species of Lepidoptera engage in some form of entomophily (more specifically psychophily and phalaenophily for butterflies and moths, respectively), or the pollination of flowers. Most adult butterflies and moths feed on the nectar inside flowers, using their probosces to reach the nectar hidden at the base of the petals. In the process, the adults may brush against the flowers' stamens, on which the reproductive pollen is made and stored. The pollen is transferred on appendages on the adults, which fly to the next flower to feed and unwittingly deposit the pollen on the stigma of the next flower, where the pollen germinates and fertilizes the seeds.\nFlowers pollinated by butterflies tend to be large, flamboyant, and scented, as butterflies are typically day-flying. Since butterflies do not digest pollen (except for heliconid species,) more nectar is offered than pollen. The flowers have simple nectar guides, with the nectaries usually hidden in narrow tubes or spurs, reached by the long \"tongue\" of the butterflies. Butterflies such as \"Thymelicus flavus\" have been observed to engage in flower constancy, which means they are more likely to transfer pollen to other conspecific plants, because it reduces the loss of pollen during foraging, and the stigmas receive less pollen from other flower species. However, most butterflies are very poor pollinators despite high rates of floral visitation; for example, monarch butterflies contribute almost nothing to seed set in milkweeds that they visit for nectar.\nAmong the more important moth pollinator groups are the hawk moths of the family Sphingidae. Their behavior is similar to hummingbirds, i.e., using rapid wing beats to hover in front of flowers. Most hawk moths are nocturnal or crepuscular, so moth-pollinated flowers (e.g., \"Silene latifolia\" ) tend to be white, night-opening, large, and showy with tubular corollae and a strong, sweet scent produced in the evening, night, or early morning. A lot of nectar is produced to fuel the high metabolic rates needed to power their flight. Other moths (e.g., noctuids, geometrids, pyralids) fly slowly and settle on the flower. They do not require as much nectar as the fast-flying hawk moths, and the flowers tend to be small (though they may be aggregated in heads).\nMutualism.\nMutualism is a form of biological interaction wherein each individual involved benefits in some way. An example of a mutualistic relationship would be that shared by yucca moths (Tegeculidae) and their host, yucca (Asparagaceae). Female yucca moths enter the flowers, collect the pollen into a ball using specialized maxillary palps, then move to the apex of the pistil, where pollen is deposited on the stigma, and lay eggs into the base of the pistil where seeds will develop. The larvae develop in the fruit pod and feed on a portion of the seeds. Thus, both insect and plant benefit, forming a highly mutualistic relationship. Another form of mutualism occurs between larvae of Lycaenid butterflies and ants. The larvae communicate with the ants using vibrations and chemical signals. The ants provide some degree of protection to these larvae and they in turn gather honeydew secretions.\nParasitism.\nOnly 42 species of parasitoid lepidopterans are known (1 Pyralidae; 40 Epipyropidae). The larvae of the greater and lesser wax moths feed on the honeycomb inside bee nests and may become pests; they are also found in bumblebee and wasp nests, albeit to a lesser extent. In northern Europe, the wax moth is regarded as the most serious parasitoid of the bumblebee and is found only in bumblebee nests. In some areas in southern England, as much as 80% of nests can be destroyed. Other parasitic larvae are known to prey upon cicadas and leaf hoppers.\nIn reverse, moths and butterflies may be subject to parasitic wasps and flies, which may lay eggs on the caterpillars, which hatch and feed inside its body, resulting in death. Although, in a form of parasitism called idiobiont, the adult paralyzes the host, so as not to kill it but for it to live as long as possible, for the parasitic larvae to benefit the most. In another form of parasitism, koinobiont, the species live off their hosts while inside (endoparasitic). These parasites live inside the host caterpillar throughout its life cycle or may affect it later on as an adult. In other orders, koinobionts include flies, a majority of coleopteran, and many hymenopteran parasitoids. Some species may be subject to a variety of parasites, such as the spongy moth (\"Lymantaria dispar\"), which is attacked by a series of 13 species, in six different taxa throughout its life cycle.\nIn response to a parasitoid egg or larva in the caterpillar's body, the plasmatocytes, or simply the host's cells can form a multilayered capsule that eventually causes the endoparasite to asphyxiate. The process, called encapsulation, is one of the caterpillar's only means of defense against parasitoids.\nEvolution and systematics.\nHistory of study.\nLinnaeus in \"Systema Naturae\" (1758) recognized three divisions of the Lepidoptera: \"Papilio\", \"Sphinx\" and \"Phalaena\", with seven subgroups in \"Phalaena\". These persist today as 9 of the superfamilies of Lepidoptera. Other works on classification followed including those by Michael Denis &amp; Ignaz Schifferm\u00fcller (1775), Johan Christian Fabricius (1775) and Pierre Andr\u00e9 Latreille (1796). Jacob H\u00fcbner described many genera, and the lepidopteran genera were catalogued by Ferdinand Ochsenheimer and Georg Friedrich Treitschke in a series of volumes on the lepidopteran fauna of Europe published between 1807 and 1835. Gottlieb August Wilhelm Herrich-Sch\u00e4ffer (several volumes, 1843\u20131856), and Edward Meyrick (1895) based their classifications primarily on wing venation. \nSir George Francis Hampson worked on the microlepidoptera during this period and Philipp Christoph Zeller published \"The Natural History of the Tineinae\" also on microlepidoptera (1855).\nAmong the first entomologists to study fossil insects and their evolution was Samuel Hubbard Scudder (1837\u20131911), who worked on butterflies. He published a study of the Florissant deposits of Colorado, including the exceptionally preserved \"Prodryas persephone\". Andreas V. Martynov (1879\u20131938) recognized the close relationship between Lepidoptera and Trichoptera in his studies on phylogeny.\nMajor contributions in the 20th century included the creation of the Monotrysia and Ditrysia (based on female genital structure) by Borner in 1925 and 1939. Willi Hennig (1913\u20131976) developed the cladistic methodology and applied it to insect phylogeny. Niels P. Kristensen, E. S. Nielsen and D. R. Davis studied the relationships among monotrysian families. Many attempts have been made to group the superfamilies of the Lepidoptera into natural groups, most of which fail because one of the two groups is not monophyletic: Microlepidoptera and Macrolepidoptera, Heterocera and Rhopalocera, Jugatae and Frenatae, Monotrysia and Ditrysia. A 2024 genetic study found that the chromosome organisation of butterflies and moths has been largely conserved in most groups over the past 250 million years.\nFossil record.\nThe fossil record for Lepidoptera is lacking in comparison to other winged species and tends not to be as common as some other insects in habitats that are most conducive to fossilization, such as lakes and ponds; their juvenile stage has only the head capsule as a hard part that might be preserved. Also, the scales covering their wings are hydrophobic and prevents their body from sinking when they end up on the water's surface. Lepidopteran bodies tend to come apart after death, and decompose quickly, so fossil remains are often extremely fragmentary. Of the fossils known, only an estimated 7% have been described. The location and abundance of the most common moth species are indicative that mass migrations of moths occurred over the Palaeogene North Sea, which is why there is a serious lack of moth fossils. Yet there are fossils, some preserved in amber and some in very fine sediments. Leaf mines are also seen in fossil leaves, although the interpretation of them is tricky.\nPutative fossil stem group representatives of Amphiesmenoptera (the clade comprising Trichoptera and Lepidoptera) are known from the Triassic. The earliest known probable lepidopteran fossils are fossilized scales found in approximately 236 million years old fossilized herbivore dung in Argentina that are thought to have been incidentally ingested. The next oldest fossils are from the Triassic-Jurassic boundary (ca 201 million years ago). They were found as rare palynological elements in the sediments of the Triassic-Jurassic boundary from the cored Schandelah-1 well, drilled near Braunschweig in northern Germany. This pushes back the fossil record and origin of glossatan lepidopterans by about 70-90 million years, supporting molecular estimates of a Norian (ca 212 million years) divergence of glossatan and non-glossatan lepidopterans. The findings were reported in 2018 in the journal \"Science Advances\". The authors of the study proposed that lepidopterans evolved a proboscis as an adaptation to drink from droplets and thin films of water for maintaining their fluid balance in the hot and arid climate of the Triassic.\nThe earliest named lepidopteran taxon is \"Archaeolepis mane\", a primitive moth-like species from the Early Jurassic, dated back to around https://\u00a0million years ago, and known only from three wings found in the Charmouth Mudstone of Dorset, UK. The wings show scales with parallel grooves under a scanning electron microscope and a characteristic wing venation pattern shared with Trichoptera (caddisflies). Only two more sets of Jurassic lepidopteran fossils have been found, as well as 13 sets from the Cretaceous, which all belong to primitive moth-like families.\nThe oldest genuine butterflies of the superfamily Papilionoidea have been found in the Paleocene MoClay or Fur Formation of Denmark. Well-preserved fossil lepidopterans include the Eocene \"Prodryas persephone\" from the Florissant Fossil Beds.\nPhylogeny.\nLepidoptera and Trichoptera (caddisflies) are sister groups, sharing many similarities that are lacking in others; for example the females of both orders are heterogametic, meaning they have two different sex chromosomes, whereas in most species the males are heterogametic and the females have two identical sex chromosomes. The adults in both orders display a particular wing venation pattern on their forewings. The larvae in the two orders have mouth structures and glands with which they make and manipulate silk. Willi Hennig grouped the two orders into the superorder Amphiesmenoptera; together they are sister to the extinct order Tarachoptera. Lepidoptera descend from a diurnal moth-like common ancestor that either fed on dead or living plants.\nThe cladogram, based on molecular analysis, shows the order as a clade, sister to the Trichoptera, and more distantly related to the Diptera (true flies) and Mecoptera (scorpionflies).\nThe internal phylogeny of Lepidoptera is still being resolved. While many large clades have been established, interfamilial and superfamilial relationships are poorly understood. A large scale study by Regier et al. attempts to resolve these relationships using three different analysis methods, which is shown in the following cladogram.\nMicropterigidae, Agathiphagidae and Heterobathmiidae are the oldest and most basal lineages of Lepidoptera. The adults of these families do not have the curled tongue or proboscis, that are found in most members of the order, but instead have chewing mandibles adapted for a special diet. Micropterigidae larvae feed on leaves, fungi, or liverworts (much like the Trichoptera). Adult Micropterigidae chew the pollen or spores of ferns. In the Agathiphagidae, larvae live inside kauri pines and feed on seeds. In Heterobathmiidae the larvae feed on the leaves of \"Nothofagus\", the southern beech tree. These families also have mandibles in the pupal stage, which help the pupa emerge from the seed or cocoon after metamorphosis.\nWith the evolution of the Ditrysia in the mid-Cretaceous, there was a major reproductive change. The Ditrysia, which comprise 98% of the Lepidoptera, have two separate openings for reproduction in the females (as well as a third opening for excretion), one for mating, and one for laying eggs. The two are linked internally by a seminal duct. (In more basal lineages there is one cloaca, or later, two openings and an external sperm canal.) Of the early lineages of Ditrysia, Gracillarioidea and Gelechioidea are mostly leaf miners, but more recent lineages feed externally. In the Tineoidea, most species feed on plant and animal detritus and fungi, and build shelters in the larval stage. \nIn the so-called \"macrolepidoptera\", which constitutes about 60% of lepidopteran species, there was a general increase in size, better flying ability (via changes in wing shape and linkage of the forewings and hindwings), reduction in the adult mandibles, and a change in the arrangement of the crochets (hooks) on the larval prolegs, perhaps to improve the grip on the host plant. Many have tympanal organs, that allow them to hear.\nThe main lineages in the macrolepidoptera are the Noctuoidea, Bombycoidea, Lasiocampidae, Mimallonoidea, Geometroidea and Rhopalocera. Bombycoidea plus Lasiocampidae plus Mimallonoidea may be a monophyletic group. The Rhopalocera, comprising the Papilionoidea (butterflies), Hesperioidea (skippers), and the Hedyloidea (moth-butterflies), are the most recently evolved. There is quite a good fossil record for this group, with the oldest skipper dating from https://\u00a0million years ago.\nTaxonomy.\nThere are over 120 recognized lepidopteran families, in 45 to 48 superfamilies. Historically, lepidopterists classified the order into five suborders, with one encompassing the so-called \"primitive\" moths\u2014groups that were long viewed as relics, retaining morphological features reminiscent of their distant ancestors. This portrayed these lineages as static holdovers from the past. In contrast, the vast majority of species fall within the dominant suborder Ditrysia, characterized by \"advanced\" reproductive and morphological traits. Phylogenetic analyses show that these early-diverging lineages are paraphyletic relative to later lineages. Consequently, lepidopterists have largely abandoned intermediate clades such as suborders.\nThe basal clades of Lepidoptera represent early-diverging lineages that retain ancestral traits, providing key insights into the order's evolutionary origins. These groups are paraphyletic and form successive sister relationships leading to the dominant Glossata. Below is an overview of the major clades:\n This clade comprises the single superfamily Micropterigoidea, one of the earliest-diverging lineages, with adults uniquely retaining functional chewing mouthparts (mandibles). Approximately 120 species are known worldwide.\n This clade contains a single small family, Agathiphagidae. These moths lack a functional proboscis, reflecting their early divergence, and their caterpillars feed exclusively on the wood of kauri trees (genus \"Agathis\").\n This clade includes the single family Heterobathmiidae, with around 10 species of day-flying, metallic moths restricted to southern South America. Adults feed on pollen from \"Nothofagus\" (southern beech) trees, while the larvae mine leaves. They lack a functional proboscis.\n Encompassing most lepidopteran species, this clade is distinguished by the loss of functional mandibles and the development of elongated maxillary galeae forming a proboscis for liquid feeding.\nRelationship to people.\nCulture.\nArtistic depictions of butterflies have been used in cultures from at least 3500 years ago, in Egyptian hieroglyphs. Butterflies are widely used in various objects of art and jewelry: mounted in frames, embedded in resin, displayed in bottles, laminated in paper, and in some mixed media artworks and furnishings. \nIn many cultures the soul of a dead person is associated with the butterfly, for example in Ancient Greece, where the word for butterfly \u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u03ae (psyche) also means \"soul\" and \"breath\". In Latin, as in Ancient Greece, the word for \"butterfly\" papilio was associated with the soul of the dead. According to \"\", by Lafcadio Hearn, a butterfly was seen in Japan as the personification of a person's soul; whether they were living, dying, or already dead. A Japanese superstition says that if a butterfly enters your guestroom and perches behind the bamboo screen, the person whom you most love is coming to see you. However, large numbers of butterflies are viewed as a bad omen. When Taira no Masakado was secretly preparing for his famous revolt, there appeared in Kyoto so vast a swarm of butterflies that the people were frightened\u2014thinking the apparition to be a portent of coming evil.\nIn the ancient Mesoamerican city of Teotihuacan, the brilliantly colored image of the butterfly was carved into temples, buildings, jewelry, and incense burners. The butterfly was sometimes depicted with the maw of a jaguar; some species were considered to be the reincarnations of the souls of dead warriors. The close association of butterflies to fire and warfare persisted through to the Aztec civilization; jaguar-butterfly images have been found among the Zapotec and Maya civilizations.\nPests.\nThe larvae of many lepidopteran species are major pests in agriculture. Some of the major pests include Tortricidae, Noctuidae, and Pyralidae. The larvae of the Noctuidae genus \"Spodoptera\" (armyworms), \"Helicoverpa\" (corn earworm), or \"Pieris brassicae\" can cause extensive damage to certain crops. \"Helicoverpa zea\" larvae (cotton bollworms or tomato fruitworms) are polyphagous, meaning they eat a variety of crops, including tomatoes and cotton. \"Peridroma saucia\" (variegated cutworms) are described as one of the most damaging pests to gardens, with the ability to destroy entire gardens and fields in a matter of days.\nButterflies and moths are one of the largest taxa to solely feed and be dependent on living plants, in terms of the number of species, and they are in many ecosystems, making up the largest biomass to do so. In many species, the female may produce anywhere from 200 to 600 eggs, while in some others it may go as high as 30,000 eggs in one day. This can create many problems for agriculture, where many caterpillars can affect acres of vegetation. Some reports estimate that there have been over 80,000 caterpillars of several different taxa feeding on a single oak tree. In some cases, phytophagous larvae can lead to the destruction of entire trees in relatively short periods of time.\nEcological ways of removing pest Lepidoptera species are becoming more economically viable, as research has shown ways like introducing parasitic wasps and flies. For example, \"Sarcophaga aldrichi\", a fly which deposited larvae feed upon the pupae of the forest tent caterpillar moth. Pesticides can affect other species other than the species they are targeted to eliminate, damaging the natural ecosystem. Another good biological pest control method is the use of pheromone traps. A pheromone trap is a type of insect trap that uses pheromones to lure insects. Sex pheromones and aggregating pheromones are the most common types used. A pheromone-impregnated lure is encased in a conventional trap such as a Delta trap, water-pan trap, or funnel trap.\nSpecies of moths that are detritivores would naturally eat detritus containing keratin, such as hairs or feathers. Well known species are cloth moths (\"T. bisselliella\", \"T. pellionella\", and \"T. tapetzella\"), feeding on foodstuffs that people find economically important, such as cotton, linen, silk and wool fabrics as well as furs; furthermore they have been found on shed feathers and hair, bran, semolina and flour (possibly preferring wheat flour), biscuits, casein, and insect specimens in museums.\nBeneficial insects.\nEven though some butterflies and moths affect the economy negatively, many species are a valuable economic resource. The most prominent example is that of the domesticated silkworm moth (\"Bombyx mori\"), the larvae of which make their cocoons out of silk, which can be spun into cloth. Silk is and has been an important economic resource throughout history. The species \"Bombyx mori\" has been domesticated to the point where it is completely dependent on mankind for survival. A number of wild moths such as \"Bombyx mandarina\", and \"Antheraea\" species, besides others, provide commercially important silks.\nThe preference of the larvae of most lepidopteran species to feed on a single species or limited range of plants is used as a mechanism for biological control of weeds in place of herbicides. The pyralid cactus moth was introduced from Argentina to Australia, where it successfully suppressed millions of acres of prickly pear cactus. Another species of the Pyralidae, called the alligator weed stem borer (\"Arcola malloi\"), was used to control the aquatic plant known as alligator weed (\"Alternanthera philoxeroides\") in conjunction with the alligator weed flea beetle; in this case, the two insects work in synergy and the weed rarely recovers.\nBreeding butterflies and moths, or butterfly gardening/rearing, has become an ecologically viable process of introducing species into the ecosystem to benefit it. Butterfly ranching in Papua New Guinea permits nationals of that country to \"farm\" economically valuable insect species for the collectors market in an ecologically sustainable manner.\nFood.\nLepidoptera feature prominently in entomophagy as food items on almost every continent. While in most cases, adults, larvae or pupae are eaten as staples by indigenous people, beondegi or silkworm pupae are eaten as a snack in Korean cuisine while Maguey worm is considered a delicacy in Mexico. In some parts of Huasteca, the silk nests of the Madrone butterfly are maintained on the edge of roof tops of houses for consumption. In the Carnia region of Italy, children catch and eat ingluvies of the toxic \"Zygaena\" moths in early summer. The ingluvies, despite having a very low cyanogenic content, serve as a convenient, supplementary source of sugar to the children who can include this resource as a seasonal delicacy at minimum risk. Outside of this instance, adult Lepidoptera are rarely consumed by humans, with the sole exception of the Bogong moth.\nHealth.\nSome larvae of both moths and butterflies have irritant toxic hairs; species from some 12 families can inflict serious human injuries (urticarial dermatitis and atopic asthma to osteochondritis, consumption coagulopathy, renal failure, and intracerebral hemorrhage). Skin rashes are the most common, but there have been fatalities. \"Lonomia\" is a frequent cause of envenomation in humans in Brazil, killing up to 20% of people affected.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

After his former student E. B. White revised and extended the book, \"The Elements of Style\" became an influential guide to writing in the English language, informally known as \u201cStrunk &amp; White\u201d.\nLife and career.\nWilliam Strunk was born and reared in Cincinnati, Ohio, the eldest of the four surviving children of William and Ella Garretson Strunk. He earned a bachelor's degree at the University of Cincinnati in 1890 and a PhD at Cornell University in 1896. He spent the academic year 1898\u201399 at the Sorbonne and the Coll\u00e8ge de France, where he studied morphology and philology.\nStrunk first taught mathematics at Rose Polytechnical Institute in Terre Haute, Indiana in 1890\u201391. He then taught English at Cornell for 46 years, and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa, disdaining specialization and becoming an expert in both classical and non-English literature. In 1922 he published \"English Metres\", a study of poetic metrical form, and he compiled critical editions of Cynewulf's \"Juliana\", several works of Dryden, James Fenimore Cooper's \"Last of the Mohicans\", and several Shakespearean plays. Strunk was also active in a gathering known as the Manuscript Club, an \"informal Saturday-night gathering of students and professors interested in writing,\" where he met \"a sensitive and deeply thoughtful young man named Elwyn Brooks White.\"\nIn 1935\u201336, Strunk enjoyed serving as the literary consultant for the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film \"Romeo and Juliet\" (1936). In the studio he was known as \"the professor,\" in part because, with his three-piece suit and wire-rim spectacles, he \"looked as though he'd been delivered to the set from MGM's casting department.\"\nIn 1918, Strunk privately published \"The Elements of Style\" for the use of his Cornell students, who gave it its nickname, \"the little book.\" Strunk intended the guide \"to lighten the task of instructor and student by concentrating attention\u00a0... on a few essentials, the rules of usage and principles of composition most commonly violated.\" In 1935, Strunk and Edward A. Tenney revised and published the guide as \"The Elements and Practice of Composition\" (1935).\nIn his \"New Yorker\" column of July 27, 1957, E. B. White praised the \"little book\" as a \"forty-three-page summation of the case for cleanliness, accuracy, and brevity in the use of English.\" Macmillan and Company then commissioned White to revise the 1935 edition for republication under Strunk's original title. His expansion and modernization sold more than two million copies. Since 1959, total sales of the three editions have exceeded ten million copies.\nIn 1900, Strunk married Olivia Emilie Locke, with whom he had three children, including the noted musicologist Oliver Strunk. William Strunk retired from Cornell in 1937. In 1945 he suffered a mental breakdown, diagnosed as \"senile psychosis\", and died less than a year later at the Hudson River Psychiatric Institute in Poughkeepsie, New York. Strunk's Cornell obituary noted that his friends and former students remembered \"his kindness, his helpfulness as a teacher and colleague, [and] his boyish lack of envy and guile\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "53309", "revid": "21678789", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53309", "title": "Psychedelic drug", "text": "Hallucinogenic class of psychoactive drug\nPsychedelics are a subclass of hallucinogenic drugs whose primary effect is to trigger non-ordinary mental states (known as psychedelic experiences or \"trips\") and a perceived \"expansion of consciousness\". Also referred to as classic hallucinogens or serotonergic hallucinogens, the term \"psychedelic\" is sometimes used more broadly to include various other types of hallucinogens as well, such as those which are atypical or adjacent to psychedelia like salvia and MDMA, respectively.\nClassic psychedelics generally cause specific psychological, visual, and auditory changes, and oftentimes a substantially altered state of consciousness. They have had the largest influence on science and culture, and include mescaline, LSD, psilocybin, and DMT. There are a large number of both naturally occurring and synthetic serotonergic psychedelics.\nMost psychedelic drugs fall into one of the three families of chemical compounds: tryptamines, phenethylamines, or lysergamides. They produce their psychedelic effects by binding to and activating a receptor in the brain called the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor, and hence are a type of serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonist. By activating serotonin 5-HT2A receptors, they modulate the activity of key circuits in the brain involved with sensory perception and cognition. However, the exact nature of how psychedelics induce changes in perception and cognition via the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor is still unknown. The psychedelic experience is often compared to non-ordinary forms of consciousness such as those experienced in meditation, mystical experiences, and near-death experiences, which also appear to be partially underpinned by altered default mode network activity. The phenomenon of ego death is often described as a key feature of the psychedelic experience.\nMany psychedelic drugs are illegal to possess without lawful authorisation, exemption or license worldwide under the UN conventions, with occasional exceptions for religious use or research contexts. Despite these controls, recreational use of psychedelics is common. There is also a long history of use of naturally occurring psychedelics as entheogens dating back thousands of years. Legal barriers have made the scientific study of psychedelics more difficult. Research has been conducted, however, and studies show that psychedelics are physiologically safe and rarely lead to addiction. Studies conducted using psilocybin in a psychotherapeutic setting reveal that psychedelic drugs may assist with treating depression, anxiety, alcohol addiction, and nicotine addiction. Although further research is needed, existing results suggest that psychedelics could be effective treatments for certain mental health conditions. A 2022 survey by YouGov found that 28% of Americans had used a psychedelic at some point in their life.\nExamples.\nMDMA (\"ecstasy\") is sometimes said to also have weak psychedelic effects, but it acts and is classified mainly as an entactogen rather than as a hallucinogen. Certain related drugs like MDA and MMDA, while much less common, have greater psychedelic effects however.\nUses.\nRecreational.\nRecreational use of psychedelics has been common since the psychedelic era of the mid-1960s and continues to feature at festivals and events such as Burning Man. A 2013 survey found that 13.4% of American adults had used a psychedelic at some point in their lives.\nA June 2024 report by the RAND Corporation indicated that psilocybin mushrooms are currently the most widely used psychedelic drug among U.S. adults. According to the RAND national survey, 3.1% of adults reported psilocybin use in the past year, while about 12% reported lifetime use. Similar lifetime prevalence was reported for LSD, whereas MDMA (ecstasy) showed lower lifetime use at 7.6%. Fewer than 1% of adults reported using any psychedelic in the past month.\nA nationwide survey of 11,299 adults in Germany, published in 2025, found that 5.0% of respondents reported lifetime psychedelic use, with 0.7% reporting use within the past six months. Approximately 3% of respondents had used LSD, LSD analogues, psilocybin, or related substances at least once in their lifetime, and 0.5% had done so within the past six months. Lifetime prevalence of medium-to-high dosing (3.9%) was higher than microdosing (2.7%). Usage patterns varied by sociodemographic characteristics, including sex, age, residence, income, and marital status.\nTraditional.\nA number of frequently mentioned or traditional psychedelics such as \"ayahuasca\" (which contains DMT), San Pedro, peyote, and Peruvian torch (which all contain mescaline), psilocybin-containing mushrooms (which contain psilocin and psilocybin) and \"Tabernanthe iboga\" (which contains the unique hallucinogen ibogaine) all have a long and extensive history of spiritual, shamanic and traditional usage by indigenous peoples in various world regions, particularly in Latin America, but also Gabon, Africa in the case of iboga. Different countries and/or regions have come to be associated with traditional or spiritual use of particular psychedelics, such as the ancient and entheogenic use of psilocybe mushrooms by the native Mazatec people of Oaxaca, Mexico or the use of the ayahuasca brew in the Amazon basin, particularly in Peru for spiritual and physical healing as well as for religious festivals. Peyote has also been used for several thousand years in the Rio Grande Valley in North America by native tribes as an entheogen. In the Andean region of South America, the San Pedro cactus (\"Echinopsis pachanoi\") has a long history of use, possibly as a traditional medicine. Archaeological studies have found evidence of use going back two thousand years, to Moche culture, Nazca culture, and Chav\u00edn culture. Although authorities of the Roman Catholic church attempted to suppress its use after the Spanish conquest, this failed, as shown by the Christian element in the common name \"San Pedro cactus\" \u2013 Saint Peter cactus. The name has its origin in the belief that just as St Peter holds the keys to heaven, the effects of the cactus allow users \"to reach heaven while still on earth.\" In 2022, the Peruvian Ministry of Culture declared the traditional use of San Pedro cactus in northern Peru as cultural heritage.\nAlthough people of Western culture have tended to use psychedelics for either psychotherapeutic or recreational reasons, most indigenous cultures, particularly in South America, have seemingly tended to use psychedelics for more supernatural reasons such as divination. This can often be related to \"healing\" or health as well but typically in the context of finding out what is wrong with the individual, such as using psychedelic states to \"identify\" a disease and/or its cause, locate lost objects, and identify a victim or even perpetrator of sorcery. In some cultures and regions, even psychedelics themselves, such as ayahuasca and the psychedelic lichen of eastern Ecuador (\"Dictyonema huaorani\") that supposedly contains both 5-MeO-DMT and psilocybin, have also been used by witches and sorcerers to conduct their malicious magic, similarly to nightshade deliriants like \"brugmansia\" and \"latua\".\nMedical.\nPsychedelic therapy (or psychedelic-assisted therapy) is the proposed use of psychedelic drugs to treat mental disorders. As of 2021, psychedelic drugs are controlled substances in most countries and psychedelic therapy is not legally available outside clinical trials, with some exceptions.\nThe procedure for psychedelic therapy differs from that of therapies using conventional psychiatric medications. While conventional medications are usually taken without supervision at least once daily, in contemporary psychedelic therapy the drug is administered in a single session (or sometimes up to three sessions) in a therapeutic context. The therapeutic team prepares the patient for the experience beforehand and helps them integrate insights from the drug experience afterwards. After ingesting the drug, the patient normally wears eyeshades and listens to music to facilitate focus on the psychedelic experience, with the therapeutic team interrupting only to provide reassurance if adverse effects such as anxiety or disorientation arise.\nAs of 2022, the body of high-quality evidence on psychedelic therapy remains relatively small and more, larger studies are needed to reliably show the effectiveness and safety of psychedelic therapy's various forms and applications. On the basis of favorable early results, ongoing research is examining proposed psychedelic therapies for conditions including major depressive disorder, and anxiety and depression linked to terminal illness. The United States Food and Drug Administration has granted breakthrough therapy status, which expedites the assessment of promising drug therapies for potential approval, to psilocybin therapy for treatment-resistant depression and major depressive disorder.\nIt has been proposed that psychedelics used for therapeutic purposes may act as active \"super placebos\".\nMicrodosing.\nPsychedelic microdosing is the practice of using sub-threshold doses (microdoses) of psychedelics in an attempt to improve creativity, boost physical energy level, emotional balance, increase performance on problems-solving tasks and to treat anxiety, depression and addiction. The practice of microdosing has become more widespread in the 21st century with more people claiming long-term benefits from the practice.\nA 2022 study recognized signatures of psilocybin microdosing in natural language and concluded that low amount of psychedelics have potential for application, and ecological observation of microdosing schedules.\nDosing.\nThe table below provides doses of major serotonergic psychedelics as well as the entactogen and mild psychedelic MDMA (\"ecstasy\") that have been determined on the basis of clinical studies. Other dosing schemes have also been reported.\nIn the case of dried psilocybin-containing mushrooms, microdoses are 0.1g to 0.3g and psychedelic doses are 1.0g to 3.5\u20135.0g. The preceding 1.0 to 5.0g range corresponds to psilocybin doses of about 10 to 50mg. Psilocybin-containing mushrooms vary in their psilocybin and psilocin content, but are typically around 1% of the dried weight of the mushrooms (in terms of total or combined psilocybin and psilocin content). Psilocybin and psilocin are similar in potency and dose but psilocin is about 1.4-fold more active, this being related to the difference in molecular weight between the two compounds.\nSome psychedelics, such as 2C-B, 2C-E, 2C-P, methallylescaline (MAL), and 4-HO-DiPT among others, have been said to have steep dose\u2013response curves, meaning that the difference in dose between a light experience and an overwhelming disconnection from reality can be small. Conversely, 2C-D is described as having an unusually wide and gradual dose range.\nEffects.\nPsychedelic effects.\nAlthough several attempts have been made, starting in the 19th and 20th centuries, to define common phenomenological structures of the effects produced by classic psychedelics, a universally accepted taxonomy does not yet exist. At lower doses, features of psychedelic experiences include sensory alterations, such as the warping of surfaces, shape suggestibility, pareidolia, and color variations. Users often report intense colors that they have not previously experienced, and repetitive geometric shapes or form constants are common as well. Higher doses often cause intense and fundamental alterations of sensory (notably visual) perception, such as synesthesia or the experience of additional spatial or temporal dimensions. Tryptamines are well documented to cause classic psychedelic states, such as increased empathy, visual distortions (drifting, morphing, breathing, melting of various surfaces and objects), auditory hallucinations, ego dissolution or ego death with high enough dose, mystical, transpersonal and spiritual experiences, autonomous \"entity\" encounters, time distortion, closed eye hallucinations and complete detachment from reality with a high enough dose. Luis Luna describes psychedelic experiences as having a distinctly gnosis-like quality, and says that they offer \"learning experiences that elevate consciousness and can make a profound contribution to personal development.\" Czech psychiatrist Stanislav Grof studied the effects of psychedelics like LSD early in his career and said of the experience, that it commonly includes \"complex revelatory insights into the nature of existence\u2026 typically accompanied by a sense of certainty that this knowledge is ultimately more relevant and 'real' than the perceptions and beliefs we share in everyday life.\" Traditionally, the standard model for the subjective phenomenological effects of psychedelics has typically been based on LSD, with anything that is considered \"psychedelic\" evidently being compared to it and its specific effects.\nGood trips are reportedly deeply pleasurable, and typically involve intense joy or euphoria, a greater appreciation for life, reduced anxiety, a sense of spiritual enlightenment, and a sense of belonging or interconnectedness with the universe. Negative experiences, colloquially known as \"bad trips,\" evoke an array of dark emotions, such as irrational fear, anxiety, panic, paranoia, dread, distrustfulness, hopelessness, and even suicidal ideation. While it is impossible to predict when a bad trip will occur, one's mood, surroundings, sleep, hydration, social setting, and other factors can be controlled (colloquially referred to as \"set and setting\") to minimize the risk of a bad trip. The concept of \"set and setting\" also generally appears to be more applicable to psychedelics than to other types of hallucinogens such as deliriants, hypnotics and dissociative anesthetics.\nPsychedelics include naturally occurring tryptamines like psilocybin and DMT, the naturally occurring phenethylamine mescaline, and naturally occurring lysergamides like ergine (lysergic acid amide; LSA), as well as synthetic analogues and derivatives like LSD and 2C-B. Many of these psychedelics cause remarkably similar effects, despite their different chemical structures. However, many users anecdotally report that the three major families have subjectively different qualities in the \"feel\" of the experience, which are difficult to describe. There can also be very substantial differences between the drugs; for instance, 5-MeO-DMT rarely produces the visual effects typical of other psychedelics. As additional examples, DiPT is said to primarily affect the auditory sense, 2C-T, 2C-T-17, MiPT, and ASR-3001 (5-MeO-iPALT) are said to produce psychedelic effects on thinking or \"head space\" with few or no visuals, and \"N\"-methyltryptamine (NMT) is said to be a spatial psychedelic.\nThe visuals of psychedelics have been reproduced in video and image form using artificial intelligence.\nSome rare individuals do not experience hallucinogenic effects with serotonergic psychedelics.\nOther psychoactive effects.\nSome psychedelics have been associated with other psychoactive effects in addition to their hallucinogenic effects. For example, psychedelics like LSD and DOM have been described as having mild stimulant and/or \"psychic-energizing\" (i.e., acute antidepressant) effects. Some psychedelics and related drugs, like DOET (low doses), Ariadne, and ASR-2001 (2CB-5PrO), have been investigated specifically for such effects. 2C-B has been said to have mild entactogenic effects at low doses. 5-MeO-DiPT and 5-MeO-MiPT have unique and unusual effects at typical doses including tactile and sexual enhancement, mild entactogenic effects, and only light hallucinogenic effects.\nSome drugs, such as MDxx compounds like MDMA and MDA as well as \u03b1-alkyltryptamines like \u03b1-methyltryptamine (AMT), are entactogens and/or stimulants acting at monoamine transporters in addition to having varying degrees of psychedelic effects.\nPsychedelic afterglows.\nPsychedelics are associated with an afterglow, also known as positive subacute or post-experience effects, which may last days or even weeks after the psychedelic experience. These effects include reduction in psychopathology and increased well-being, mood, mindfulness, social functioning, spirituality, and executive functioning, and positive behavioral changes. They also include mixed changes in personality, values, attitudes, creativity, and flexibility, as well as adverse effects like headaches, sleep disturbances, and sometimes increased psychological distress. The afterglow period has been associated with changes in brain function, neuroplasticity, and immune system function. Both psychological and pharmacological effects may be involved in the afterglow phenomenon.\nIn 1898, the English writer and intellectual Havelock Ellis reported a heightened perceptual sensitivity to \"the more delicate phenomena of light and shade and color\" for a prolonged period of time after his exposure to mescaline. The term \"psychedelic afterglow\" was first formally coined in the 1960s. Albert Hofmann, the discoverer of LSD, said the following about the aftermath of his first full LSD experience in his 1980 book \"LSD: My Problem Child\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Exhausted, I then slept, to awake next morning refreshed, with a clear head, though still somewhat tired physically. A sensation of well-being and renewed life flowed through me. Breakfast tasted delicious and gave me extraordinary pleasure. When I later walked out into the garden, in which the sun shone now after a spring rain, everything glistened and sparkled in a fresh light. The world was as if newly created. All my senses vibrated in a condition of highest sensitivity, which persisted for the entire day.\nDuring a speech on his 100th birthday in 2006, Hofmann additionally said of LSD:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It gave me an inner joy, an open mindedness, a gratefulness, open eyes and an internal sensitivity for the miracles of creation... I think that in human evolution it has never been as necessary to have this substance LSD. It is just a tool to turn us into what we are supposed to be.\nAdverse effects.\nPsychedelic drugs are addictive psychologically, with little to no physical addiction in classical psychedelics.\nRisks do exist during an unsupervised psychedelic experience, however; Ira Byock wrote in 2018 in the \"Journal of Palliative Medicine\" that psilocybin is safe when administered to a properly screened patient and supervised by a qualified professional with appropriate set and setting. However, he called for an \"abundance of caution\" because in the absence of these conditions a range of negative reactions is possible, including \"fear, a prolonged sense of dread, or full panic.\" He notes that driving or even walking in public can be dangerous during a psychedelic experience because of impaired hand-eye coordination and fine motor control. In some cases, individuals taking psychedelics have performed dangerous or fatal acts because they believed they possessed superhuman powers.\nPsilocybin-induced states of mind share features with states experienced in psychosis, and while a causal relationship between psilocybin and the onset of psychosis has not been established as of 2011, researchers have called for investigation of the relationship. Many of the persistent negative perceptions of psychological risks are unsupported by the currently available scientific evidence, with the majority of reported adverse effects not being observed in a regulated and/or medical context. A population study on associations between psychedelic use and mental illness published in 2013 found no evidence that psychedelic use was associated with increased prevalence of any mental illness. In any case, induction of psychosis has been associated with psychedelics in small percentages of individuals, and the rates appear to be higher in people with schizophrenia.\nUsing psychedelics poses certain risks of re-experiencing of the drug's effects, including flashbacks and hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD). These non-psychotic effects are poorly studied, but the permanent symptoms (also called \"endless trip\") are considered to be rare.\nSome people with aphantasia have been reported to have acquired visual mental imagery after using psychedelics. While enhanced mental imagery may seem appealing, it may also pose risks such as increased risk of psychiatric disorders.\nSerotonergic psychedelics are agonists not only of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor but also of the serotonin 5-HT2B receptor and other serotonin receptors. A potential risk of frequent repeated use of serotonergic psychedelics is cardiac fibrosis and valvulopathy caused by serotonin 5-HT2B receptor activation. However, single high doses or widely spaced doses (e.g., months) are widely thought to be safe and concerns about cardiac toxicity apply more to chronic psychedelic microdosing or very frequent use (e.g., weekly). Selective serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonists that do not activate the serotonin 5-HT2B receptor or other serotonin receptors, such as 25CN-NBOH, DMBMPP, and LPH-5, have been developed and are being studied. Selective serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonists are expected to avoid the cardiac risks of serotonin 5-HT2B receptor activation.\nTolerance.\nA very rapid and strong tolerance, known as tachyphylaxis, develops to the effects of psychedelics with repeated administration. It develops with a single dose and is present within hours to days. Already by the second day, with LSD, there was a 50% decrease in psychoactive effects in one study. Following a few days of repeated administration, or 3 to 4days in the case of LSD, there is an almost complete absence of effects. The tolerance remains stable thereafter. In one study that gave LSD continuously for up to 84days, doubling, tripling, and quadrupling the dose was unable to fully overcome the tolerance and restore effects. An abstinence period of 3 to 6days is required for sensitivity to return and tolerance to fully reset. LSD, psilocybin, and mescaline all show cross-tolerance with each other. Tolerance has been shown to develop to numerous psychedelics in animals and/or humans. Tolerance with psychedelics develops to both their psychoactive effects and their physical effects, such as pupil dilation and tachycardia. As a result of the tolerance, recreational psychedelic users do not use the drugs daily but often show a once-per-week use pattern.\nSome possible exceptions among psychedelics which may not build tolerance or may develop it much less rapidly include dimethyltryptamine (DMT), ayahuasca (which contains DMT), and 5-MeO-DMT. Similarly, the structurally related dipropyltryptamine (DPT) and diisopropyltryptamine (DiPT) did not show behavioral tolerance in rodents, in contrast to DOI and 2C-T-7. The reasons for the apparently reduced tolerance development with the preceding psychedelics is unclear. It has been suggested that the lack of tolerance with shorter-acting psychedelics like DMT and DPT might simply be due to their short durations. Contrary to earlier findings, subsequent clinical studies employing DMT by continuous intravenous infusion (also known as DMTx) have found rapid and moderate acute tolerance development with DMT.\nThe mechanism of the tolerance with psychedelics is thought to be rapid serotonin 5-HT2A receptor downregulation with very slow recovery. Downstream targets of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor such as metabotropic glutamate mGlu2 and mGlu3 receptors may also downregulate. It is thought that serotonin 5-HT2A receptors recover to 50% of baseline within 3 to 7days of the initial psychedelic dose and fully return to baseline within 1 to 4weeks, with the recovery dependent on the doses and the length of repeated use.\nTolerance may limit the effects and potential benefits of psychedelic microdosing, with this having been observed clinically.\nOverdose.\nThere have been a handful of cases of fatal overdose with LSD, psilocybin, and mescaline. There have also been cases of death with dimethyltryptamine (DMT), 5-MeO-DMT, 2C-B, Bromo-DragonFLY, NBOMes like 25I-NBOMe, and other psychedelics. LSD and psilocybin appear to have very wide margins of safety with overdose, whereas mescaline and 2C-B have much narrower margins, and NBOMes appear to be especially toxic and uniquely linked to serotonin syndrome-type symptoms. Major psychedelics like LSD and psilocybin do not cause serotonin syndrome, which is thought to be due to the fact that they act as partial agonists of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. Conversely, psychedelics like NBOMes have higher activational efficacy at this receptor. In terms of extrapolated human lethal doses based on animal studies and human case reports, lethal doses of psychedelics relative to typical recreational doses are estimated to be 1,000-fold for LSD, 200-fold for psilocybin, 50-fold for oral DMT (as ayahuasca), and 24-fold for mescaline. Estimates for other psychedelics, like 5-MeO-DMT and 2C-B, could not be made.\nInteractions.\nSerotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonists can block the hallucinogenic effects of serotonergic psychedelics. Numerous drugs act as serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonists, for instance antidepressants like trazodone and mirtazapine, antipsychotics like quetiapine, olanzapine, and risperidone, and other agents like ketanserin, pimavanserin, cyproheptadine, and pizotifen. Such drugs are sometimes referred to as \"trip killers\" due to their ability to prevent or abort the hallucinogenic effects of psychedelics. Besides serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonists, non-hallucinogenic serotonin 5-HT2A receptor partial agonists, such as lisuride, may also block the hallucinogenic effects of serotonergic psychedelics.\nThe serotonin 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist buspirone has been found to markedly reduce the hallucinogenic effects of psilocybin in humans. Conversely, the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor antagonist pindolol has been found to potentiate the hallucinogenic effects of DMT by 2- to 3-fold in humans. Serotonin 5-HT1A receptor agonism may modify and self-inhibit the effects of psychedelics that possess this property. A particularly notable example is 5-methoxytryptamine derivatives such as 5-MeO-DMT, which are more potent serotonin 5-HT1A receptor agonists than other psychedelics and have qualitatively unique and differing hallucinogenic effects.\nBenzodiazepines, for example diazepam, alprazolam, clonazepam, and lorazepam, as well as alcohol, which act as GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulators, have been limitedly studied in combination with psychedelics and are not currently known to directly interact with them. However, these GABAergic drugs produce effects such as anxiolysis, sedation, and amnesia, and in relation to this, may diminish or otherwise oppose the effects of psychedelics. As a result of this, benzodiazepines and alcohol are often used by recreational users as \"trip killers\" to manage difficult hallucinogenic experiences with psychedelics, for instance experiences with prominent anxiety. The safety of this strategy is not entirely clear and might have risks. However, benzodiazepines have been used clinically to manage the adverse psychological effects of psychedelics, for instance in clinical studies and in the emergency department. A clinical trial of psilocybin and midazolam coadministration found that midazolam clouded the effects of psilocybin and impaired memory of the experience. Benzodiazepines might interfere with the therapeutic effects of psychedelics, such as sustained antidepressant effects.\nSome serotonergic psychedelics, for instance dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and 5-MeO-DMT, are highly susceptible substrates for monoamine oxidase (MAO), specifically MAO-A, and hence can be greatly potentiated by monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). An example of this is ayahuasca, in which plants containing both DMT and harmala alkaloids acting as MAOIs such as harmine and harmaline are combined. This allows DMT to become orally active and to have a much longer duration of action than usual. The 2C psychedelics, such as 2C-B, 2C-I, and 2C-E, are also substrates of both MAO-A and MAO-B, and may likewise be greatly potentiated by MAOIs. Examples of MAOIs that may potentiate psychedelics behaving as MAO-A and/or MAO-B substrates include phenelzine, tranylcypromine, isocarboxazid, moclobemide, and selegiline. Combination of MAO-substrate psychedelics with MAOIs can result in overdose and serious toxicity, including death. Other psychedelics, such as LSD, are not substrates of MAO and are not potentiated by MAOIs. The extent to which psilocin (and by extension psilocybin) is metabolized by MAO, specifically MAO-A, is not fully clear, but has ranged from 4% to 33% in different studies based on metabolite excretion. However, circulating levels of the deaminated metabolite of psilocin are far higher than those of free unmetabolized psilocin with psilocybin administration. An early clinical study of psilocybin in combination with short-term tranylcypromine pretreatment found that tranylcypromine marginally potentiated the peripheral effects of psilocybin, including pressor effects and mydriasis, but overall did not significantly modify the psychoactive and hallucinogenic effects of the psilocybin, although some of its emotional effects were said to be reduced and some of its perceptual effects were said to be amplified.\nSome psychedelics are substrates of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes, for instance LSD being a substrate of CYP2D6 as well as of several other CYP450 enzymes. As such, CYP450 inhibitors may increase exposure to CYP450-substrate psychedelics such as LSD and thereby potentiate their effects as well as risks. A clinical study found that administration of LSD to people taking paroxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and strong CYP2D6 inhibitor, increased LSD exposure by about 1.5-fold. The combination was well-tolerated and did not modify the pleasant subjective effects or physiological effects of LSD, whereas negative effects of LSD, including \"bad drug effect\", anxiety, and nausea, were reduced. Similarly to the findings with a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor, a pharmacogenomic clinical study with LSD found that LSD levels were 75% higher in people with non-functional CYP2D6 (poor metabolizers) compared to those with functional CYP2D6.\nSerotonin syndrome can be caused by combining psychedelics with other serotonergic drugs, including certain antidepressants, opioids, psychostimulants (e.g. MDMA), serotonin 5-HT1 receptor agonists (e.g. triptans), herbs or supplements, and others.\nA high rate of seizures has been reported when people on lithium have taken serotonergic psychedelics. In an analysis of online reports, 47% of 62accounts reported seizures when a psychedelic was taken while on lithium. The mechanism of this interaction is unclear.\nPharmacology.\nMechanism of action.\nMost serotonergic psychedelics act as non-selective agonists of serotonin receptors, including of the serotonin 5-HT2 receptors, but often also of other serotonin receptors, such as the serotonin 5-HT1 receptors. They are thought to mediate their hallucinogenic effects specifically by activation of serotonin 5-HT2A receptors. Psychedelics (including tryptamines like psilocin, DMT, and 5-MeO-DMT; phenethylamines like mescaline, DOM, and 2C-B; and ergolines and lysergamides like LSD) all act as agonists of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptors. Some psychedelics, such as phenethylamines like DOM and 2C-B, show high selectivity for the serotonin 5-HT2 receptors over other serotonin receptors. There is a very strong correlation between 5-HT2A receptor affinity and human hallucinogenic potency. In addition, the intensity of hallucinogenic effects in humans is directly correlated with the level of serotonin 5-HT2A receptor occupancy as measured with positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. Serotonin 5-HT2A receptor blockade with drugs like the semi-selective ketanserin and the non-selective risperidone can abolish the hallucinogenic effects of psychedelics in humans. However, studies with more selective serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonists, like pimavanserin, are still needed.\nIn animals, potency for stimulus generalization to the psychedelic DOM in drug discrimination tests is strongly correlated with serotonin 5-HT2A receptor affinity. Non-selective serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonists, like ketanserin and pirenperone, and selective serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonists, like volinanserin (MDL-100907), abolish the stimulus generalization of psychedelics in drug discrimination tests. Conversely, serotonin 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C receptor antagonists are ineffective. The potencies of serotonin 5-HT2 receptor antagonists in blocking psychedelic substitution are strongly correlated with their serotonin 5-HT2A receptor affinities. Highly selective serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonists have recently been developed and show stimulus generalization to psychedelics, whereas selective serotonin 5-HT2C receptor agonists do not do so. The head-twitch response (HTR) is induced by serotonergic psychedelics and is a behavioral proxy of psychedelic-like effects in animals. The HTR is invariably induced by serotonergic psychedelics, is blocked by selective serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonists, and is abolished in serotonin 5-HT2A receptor knockout mice. In addition, there is a strong correlation between hallucinogenic potency in humans and potency in the HTR assay. Moreover, the HTR paradigm is one of the only animal tests that can distinguish between hallucinogenic serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonists and non-hallucinogenic serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonists, such as lisuride. In accordance with the preceding animal and human findings, it has been said that the evidence that the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor mediates the hallucinogenic effects of serotonergic psychedelics is overwhelming.\nThe serotonin 5-HT2A receptor activates several downstream signaling pathways. These include the Gq, \u03b2-arrestin2, and other pathways. Activation of both the Gq and \u03b2-arrestin2 pathways have been implicated in mediating the hallucinogenic effects of serotonergic psychedelics. However, subsequently, activation of the Gq pathway and not \u03b2-arrestin2 has been implicated. Interestingly, Gq signaling appeared to mediate hallucinogenic-like effects, whereas \u03b2-arrestin2 mediated receptor downregulation and tachyphylaxis. The lack of psychedelic effects with non-hallucinogenic serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonists may be due to partial agonism of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor with efficacy insufficient to produce psychedelic effects or may be due to biased agonism of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. There appears to be a threshold level of Gq activation (in terms of intrinsic activity, with EmaxTooltip maximal efficacy &gt;70%) required for production of hallucinogenic effects. Full agonists and partial agonists above this threshold are psychedelic 5-HT2A receptor agonists, whereas partial agonists below this threshold, such as lisuride, 2-bromo-LSD, 6-fluoro-DET, 6-MeO-DMT, and Ariadne, are non-hallucinogenic 5-HT2A receptor agonists. In addition, biased agonists that activate \u03b2-arrestin2 signaling but not Gq signaling, such as ITI-1549, IHCH-7086, and 25N-N1-Nap, are non-hallucinogenic serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonists.\nThe hallucinogenic effects of serotonergic psychedelics may be critically mediated by serotonin 5-HT2A receptor activation in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Layer V pyramidal neurons in this area are especially discussed. Activation of serotonin 5-HT2A receptors in the mPFC results in marked excitatory and inhibitory effects as well as increased release of glutamate and GABA. Direct injection of serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonists into the mPFC produces the HTR. Drugs that suppress glutamatergic activity in the mPFC, including AMPA receptor antagonists, metabotropic glutamate mGlu2/3 receptor agonists, \u03bc-opioid receptor agonists, and adenosine A1 receptor agonists, block or suppress many of the neurochemical and behavioral effects of serotonergic psychedelics, including the HTR. Metabotropic glutamate mGlu2 receptors are primarily expressed as presynaptic autoreceptors and have inhibitory effects on glutamate release. Serotonergic psychedelics have been found to produce frontal cortex hyperactivity in humans in PET and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging studies. The PFC projects to many other cortical and subcortical brain areas, such as the locus coeruleus, nucleus accumbens, and amygdala, among others, and activation of the PFC by serotonergic psychedelics may thereby indirectly modulate these areas. In addition to the PFC, there is moderate to high expression of serotonin 5-HT2A receptors in the primary visual cortex (V1), as well as expression of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor in other visual areas, and activation of these receptors may contribute to or mediate the visual effects of serotonergic psychedelics. Serotonergic psychedelics also directly or indirectly modulate a variety of other brain areas, like the claustrum, and this may be involved in their effects as well.\nSerotonin, as well as drugs that increase serotonin levels, like the serotonin precursor 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and serotonin releasing agents, are non-hallucinogenic in humans despite increasing activation of serotonin 5-HT2A receptors. Serotonin is a hydrophilic molecule which cannot easily cross biological membranes without active transport, and the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor is usually expressed as a cell surface receptor that is readily accessible to extracellular serotonin. The HTR, a behavioral proxy of psychedelic-like effects, appears to be mediated by activation of intracellularly expressed serotonin 5-HT2A receptors in a population of mPFC neurons that do not also express the serotonin transporter (SERT) and hence cannot be activated by serotonin. In contrast to serotonin, serotonergic psychedelics are more lipophilic than serotonin and are able to readily enter these neurons and activate the serotonin 5-HT2A receptors within them. Artificial expression of the SERT in this population of neurons in animals resulted in a serotonin releasing agent that doesn't normally produce the HTR being able to do so. Although serotonin itself is non-hallucinogenic, at very high concentrations achieved pharmacologically (e.g., injected into the brain or with massive doses of 5-HTP) it can produce psychedelic-like effects in animals by being metabolized by indolethylamine \"N\"-methyltransferase (INMT) into more lipophilic \"N\"-methylated tryptamines like \"N\"-methylserotonin and bufotenin (\"N\",\"N\"-dimethylserotonin).\nIn addition to their hallucinogenic effects, serotonergic psychedelics may also produce a variety of other effects, including psychoplastogenic (i.e., neuroplasticity-enhancing), antidepressant, anxiolytic, empathy-enhancing or prosocial effects, anti-obsessional, anti-addictive, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects, analgesic effects, and/or antimigraine effects. While psychedelics themselves are also being clinically evaluated for these potential therapeutic benefits, non-hallucinogenic serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonists, which are often analogues of serotonergic psychedelics, have been developed and are being studied for potential use in medicine in an attempt to provide some such benefits without hallucinogenic effects.\nAlthough the hallucinogenic effects of serotonergic psychedelics are thought to be mediated by serotonin 5-HT2A receptor activation, interactions with other receptors, such as the serotonin 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C receptors among many others, may additionally contribute to and modulate their effects. Many psychedelics show pronounced biased agonism at the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor. Certain psychedelics, including LSD and psilocin, have been reported to act as highly potent positive allosteric modulators of the tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB), one of the signaling receptors of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). However, subsequent studies failed to reproduce these findings and instead found no interaction of LSD or psilocin with TrkB. Moreover, the psychoplastogenic effects of serotonergic psychedelics, including dendritogenesis, spinogenesis, and synaptogenesis, appear to be mediated by activation of serotonin 5-HT2A receptors, whereas psychedelics do not generally stimulate neurogenesis.\nThe factors responsible for differences in psychoactive and hallucinogenic effects between different psychedelics are incompletely understood but may include (1) differences in selectivity for the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor or off-target activity; (2) differences in functional selectivity for different serotonin 5-HT2A receptor downstream signaling pathways; and (3) differences in patterns or balances of distribution to different brain areas.\nChemistry.\nThe three major chemical groups of serotonergic psychedelics include the tryptamines, phenethylamines, and lysergamides, which each have different profiles of pharmacological activity.\nTryptamines.\nTryptamines are derivatives of tryptamine and are structurally related to the monoamine neurotransmitter serotonin (also known as 5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT). Many tryptamines act as non-selective serotonin receptor agonists, including of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. Some tryptamines also act as monoamine releasing agents, including of serotonin, norepinephrine, and/or dopamine. Examples of psychedelic tryptamines include psilocin and psilocybin, dimethyltryptamine (DMT), 5-MeO-DMT, bufotenin, \u03b1-methyltryptamine (\u03b1MT), 4-AcO-DMT (psilacetin), 4-HO-MET, 5-MeO-MiPT, and 5-MeO-DiPT, among others. Harmala alkaloids like harmaline and iboga-type alkaloids like ibogaine are cyclized tryptamines and may also be considered hallucinogenic tryptamines.\nPhenethylamines.\nPhenethylamines, as well as amphetamines (\u03b1-methylphenethylamines), are derivatives of \u03b2-phenethylamine and are structurally related to the monoamine neurotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. Some phenethylamines and amphetamines, particularly those with methoxy and other substitions on the phenyl ring, are potent serotonin 5-HT2 receptor agonists, including of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor, and can produce psychedelic effects. In contrast to phenethylamines and amphetamines generally, most psychedelic phenethylamines are not monoamine releasing agents. Examples of psychedelic phenethylamines and amphetamines include mescaline and other scalines like trimethoxyamphetamine (TMA) and escaline, the 2C drugs like 2C-B, 2C-E, and 2C-I, the DOx drugs like DOM, DOB, DOI, certain MDxx drugs like MDA and MDMA (weak psychedelics), FLY drugs like 2C-B-FLY and Bromo-DragonFLY, and the NBOMe (25x-NBx) drugs like 25I-NBOMe, among others.\nLysergamides.\nLysergamides are ergoline derivatives related to the ergot alkaloids. They are notable in containing both tryptamine and phenethylamine within their chemical structures. As such, ergolines and lysergamides may be considered structurally related to the monoamine neurotransmitters. Many ergolines and lysergamides act as highly promiscuous ligands of monoamine receptors, including of serotonin, dopamine, and adrenergic receptors. Some lysergamides are efficacious serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonists and thereby produce psychedelic effects. Examples of psychedelic lysergamides include lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), ergine (lysergic acid amide; LSA), isoergine (isolysergic acid amide; iso-LSA), ETH-LAD, AL-LAD, 1P-LSD, 1S-LSD, ALD-52 (1A-LSD), LSZ, ergonovine (ergometrine; lysergic acid propanolamide), methylergometrine (methylergonovine), and methysergide (methylmethylergonovine), among others. Ergine, isoergine, and ergonovine occur naturally in morning glories and certain fungi like ergot and \"Periglandula\" species, while others like LSD are synthetic. LSD is among the most potent psychedelics, as well as psychoactive drugs in general, that are known.\nOthers.\nOther psychedelics not belonging to any of the above three structural families have been discovered, for instance certain arylpiperazine derivatives like quipazine, the antiretroviral drug efavirenz, and simplified or partial lysergamides (which are also conformationally constrained tryptamines and/or phenethylamines) like NDTDI and DEMPDHPCA.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nPsychedelics occurring in plants, fungi, and animals have been used by indigenous peoples throughout the world for thousands of years. These psychedelics and their sources include psilocybin and psilocin in psilocybin-containing mushrooms (teonanacatl), dimethyltryptamine (DMT) in ayahuasca (a combination typically of \"Psychotria viridis\" and \"Banisteriopsis caapi\"), bufotenin in \"Anadenanthera\" trees, 5-MeO-DMT in the Colorado River Toad, mescaline in peyote (peyotl) and San Pedro cacti, and ergine and isoergine in morning glories (ololiuqui, tlitliltzin) and ergot, among others. The kykeon of the Eleusinian Mysteries in Ancient Greece might have been a psychedelic, for instance ergot or psilocybin-containing mushrooms. The earliest archeological evidence of the use of psychedelic plants and fungi by humans dates back roughly 10,000years.\nWestern characterization.\nPsychedelics were discovered by the Western world and the scientific community relatively late. The use of hallucinogenic snuffs by indigenous South American people was first observed by Western explorers like Christopher Columbus as early as 1496. The first written description of an observed psychedelic experience, with cohoba, was published by in 1511. Spanish explorers observed the use of psilocybin-containing mushrooms (teonanacatl) in Mexico as early as 1519 with the arrival of Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s. Spanish ethnographer Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan traveled to Mexico in 1529 and described the use of these mushrooms in his books. The botanists Richard Spruce and Alfred Russel Wallace observed and described the use of ayahuasca in the Amazon in the 1850s.\nThe phenethylamine psychedelic mescaline.\nMescaline is sometimes described as the \"first psychedelic\", as it was the first to be discovered and characterized by the Western world. American physician John Raleigh Briggs, living in Texas, learned of peyote from Native Americans and Mexicans, who told him that it produced \"beautiful visions\" and made them journey into the \"spirit world\". He obtained mescal buttons from Mexico and published a journal article about trying a very low dose of them in May 1887. This article is said to have brought peyote into North American pharmacology. Briggs described the physiological effects of his experience, such as increased heart rate, and of experiencing \"intoxication\". The article was read by George Davis, of Parke, Davis and Company, who then obtained the buttons from Briggs in June 1887. Parke-Davis attempted to market peyote as a cardiac stimulant and for other uses, but met with little success. The German pharmacologist Louis Lewin obtained mescal buttons from Parke-Davis during a trip to the United States in 1887 and began studying them and sharing his findings.\nThe first known published description of a hallucinogenic peyote experience was by American neurologist Silas Weir Mitchell in December 1896. After reading Mitchell's article, others, including psychologist and sexologist Havelock Ellis, American psychologist William James, and German pharmacologist, chemist, and Lewin rival Arthur Heffter, among others, tried peyote and described their experiences. Heffter isolated and ingested mescaline from peyote, experiencing psychedelic effects with the pure compound, in 1897, and published his findings in 1898.\nAustrian chemist Ernst Sp\u00e4th synthesized mescaline for the first time in 1919. The German pharmaceutical company Merck then began distributing pharmaceutical mescaline in 1920. The German psychiatrist , a student of Lewin and an acquaintance of Hermann Hesse and Carl Jung, became the father of psychedelic psychiatry and conducted experiments with mescaline in more than 60people starting in 1921. He published his monograph on the subject, \"Der Meskalinrausch\" (\"Mescaline Intoxication\"), in 1927. German\u2013American psychologist Heinrich Kl\u00fcver published his monograph, \"Mescal: The Divine Plant and Its Psychological Effects\", in English in 1928. He is said to have been the first to attempt to provide a phenomenological description of the psychedelic experience.\nTryptamine and lysergamide psychedelics.\nAustrian anthropologist and ethnobotanist Blas Pablo Reko, traveling through Central and South America, wrote of the use of teonanacatl by native Mexican people in Oaxaca in 1919. Reko subsequently sent samples of teonanacatl (\"Psilocybe mexicana\") as well as \"Ipomoea violacea\" (morning glory) seeds to Swedish anthropologist Henry Wass\u00e9n in 1937. Reko had obtained the mushroom sample from Austrian engineer Robert Weitlaner who was working in Mexico. Eventually, Wass\u00e9n forwarded Reko and Weitlaner's mushroom sample to Harvard University, where the mushrooms came to the attention of American ethnobotanist Richard Evans Schultes. However, they had decomposed so badly that they could not be identified. Prior to Wass\u00e9n obtaining specimens around 1936, the existence of teonanacatl was very controversial and was debated and even denied by some. In 1938, a small group of Westerners, which included Weitlaner's daughter and American anthropologist Jean Basset Johnson, attended a mushroom ceremony. They were the first Westerners known to do so and described the event. Schultes published reviews of teonanacatl being a hallucinogenic mushroom in the late 1930s. Schultes obtained specimens of three of the hallucinogenic mushrooms used in ceremonies, including \"Psilocybe caerulescens\", \"Panaeolus campanulatus\", and \"Stropharia cubensis\", but further investigations of the mushrooms were interrupted by World War II.\nErgine (lysergic acid amide; LSA) and isoergine (isolysergic acid amide; iso-LSA) were first identified from hydrolysis of ergot alkaloids in 1932 and 1936, respectively. In 1938, Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann, working at Sandoz Laboratories, synthesized lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), a synthetic derivative of ergine, while developing new oxytocic drugs derived from ergot. LSD was not further investigated and was placed in storage for 5years. In 1943 however, Hofmann worked with LSD again and accidentally discovered its hallucinogenic effects when minute amounts of the potent psychedelic absorbed through his skin. His subsequent self-experiment with LSD three days later on April 19 is the psychedelic holiday Bicycle Day. Hofmann and his colleague, psychiatrist Werner Stoll, first described LSD in 1943 and first described its psychedelic effects in 1947. LSD began being distributed by Sandoz Laboratories for research purposes under the brand name Delysid in 1949.\nSchultes described the indigenous and shamanic use of dimethyltryptamine (DMT)-containing psychedelic plants in 1954 and also described the use of hallucinogenic morning glories in the 1950s. The psychedelic effects of synthesized DMT were described by Hungarian chemist and psychiatrist Stephen Sz\u00e1ra in 1956. Osmond described the hallucinogenic and other effects of morning glory seeds in clinical studies in 1955. Hofmann identified and described ergine and isoergine as the active constituents of morning glory seeds in 1960. Their hallucinogenic effects were first described by Hofmann in 1963.\nIn 1952, couple and amateur ethnomycologists R. Gordon Wasson and Valentina Wasson learned of the ritual use of hallucinogenic mushrooms in the 16th century in Mexico from the published work of Schultes. They made several trips to Mexico in search of the mushrooms. In mid-1955, the Wassons participated in a mushroom ceremony with Mazatec curandera Maria Sabina in Huautla de Jim\u00e9nez, Oaxaca, Mexico. Gordon Wasson published his experience in an article for \"Life\" magazine titled \"Seeking the Magic Mushroom\" in 1957, while Valentina Wasson published her experience as \"I Ate the Sacred Mushroom\" in \"This Week\" magazine the same year. Later in 1957, a second expedition was made by the Wassons to Mexico with French mycologist Roger Heim. Heim identified several of the mushrooms as belonging to the genus \"Psilocybe\". They collected samples of the mushrooms and Heim sent a sample to Hofmann. Hofmann identified psilocybin as the active constituent in 1958 and developed a chemical synthesis for it. Sandoz Pharmaceuticals began distributing tablets of psilocybin under the brand name Indocybin in 1960.\nFrench scientists C\u00e9saire Phisalix and Gabriel Bertrand isolated bufotenin from \"Bufo\" toads in 1893 and named it. The compound was first isolated to purity by Austrian chemist Hans Handovsky in 1920. Clinical studies assessed the effects of bufotenin and were published starting in 1956. However, the findings of these studies were conflicting, and bufotenin developed a long-standing reputation of being inactive and toxic. American ethnobotanist Jonathan Ott and colleagues subsequently showed in 2001 that bufotenin is in fact a psychedelic and does not necessarily produce major adverse effects, although marked nausea and vomiting are prominent. The related psychedelic 5-MeO-DMT was first synthesized by Japanese chemists Toshio Hoshino and Kenya Shimodaira in 1935. It was later isolated from \"Dictyoloma incanescens\" in 1959. Subsequently, 5-MeO-DMT was isolated from numerous other plants and fungi. The compound was isolated from the skin of toads, specifically the Colorado River toad (\"Incilius alvarius\", formerly \"Bufo alvarius\"), by Italian chemist and pharmacologist Vittorio Erspamer in 1967. A 1984 pamphlet by Albert Most (real name Ken Nelson), titled \"\", described how to obtain and use Colorado River toad secretions as a psychedelic drug, and this started its recreational use.\nMid-20th-century research, popularization, and prohibition.\nExtensive clinical research on almost exclusively LSD, mescaline, and psilocybin was conducted in the 1950s and 1960s. However, the amount of research done on psilocybin was nowhere near that of LSD. Psychedelics like LSD started to become more visible in the mainstream sphere in the 1950s. English writer Aldous Huxley tried mescaline, which he had obtained from English psychiatrist Humphry Osmond, in 1953, and described its effects in his 1954 book \"The Doors of Perception\". British politician Christopher Mayhew tried mescaline in 1955 and this was reported on in the media. Osmond, in correspondence with Huxley, coined the term \"psychedelic\", meaning \"mind-manifesting\", in 1956.\nPsychedelics became widely recreationally used by the public, for instance by the hippies, during the counterculture of the 1960s. Harvard psychologists Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert began studying LSD and psilocybin in the early 1960s and ended up being fired from the university in 1963. Sandoz Laboratories ceased distribution of Delysid in 1965. Psychedelics became controlled substances in the United States and internationally in the 1960s and 1970s. By the end of the 1960s, psychedelic clinical research throughout the world had largely ceased.\nBesides public research, it was eventually learned that the United States government had also conducted research into psychedelics, as possible mind-control and truth-serum drugs, in the 1940s through the 1970s, for instance Project MKUltra by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Edgewood Arsenal research by the U.S. Army.\nCreation of other synthetic psychedelics.\nThe synthetic mescaline analogue 2,6-dibromomescaline was described by Arthur Heffter in 1901, although he is not known to have tested it and its psychedelic effects weren't reported until much later. The psychedelic effects of 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), a synthetic analogue of mescaline that had been derived from amphetamine in 1910, were discovered by American chemist and pharmacologist Gordon Alles in 1930, but weren't subsequently published until 1959. 3,4,5-Trimethoxyamphetamine (TMA), another synthetic mescaline analogue, was first described in 1947 and its psychedelic effects were described in 1955. 2,4,5-Trimethoxyphenethylamine (2C-O), a synthetic positional isomer of mescaline, was synthesized and claimed to be psychedelic similarly to mescaline in 1931, but later trials found it to be inactive. Various synthetic tryptamine psychedelics, such as diethyltryptamine (DET), 4-PO-DET (CEY-19), and 4-HO-DET (CZ-74), were developed in the late 1950s. In addition, the synthetic \u03b1-alkyltryptamine analogues \u03b1-methyltryptamine (AMT; Indopan) and \u03b1-ethyltryptamine (AET; Monase), which are psychedelics and/or entactogens, were marketed and clinically used at non-hallucinogenic doses as antidepressants in the early 1960s, but were quickly withdrawn due to physical toxicity. Numerous synthetic psychedelic tryptamines were known by the mid-1970s.\nAlexander Shulgin, an American chemist working at Dow Chemical Company, tried mescaline by 1960. This experience has been described as \"the most consequential mescaline trip of the sixties\", as it caused Shulgin to redirect his focus and life's work to psychedelic chemistry. Starting in the 1960s, Shulgin synthesized and gradually described hundreds of novel synthetic psychedelics as well as entactogens in scientific publications and published books such as \"PiHKAL\" (1991) and \"TiHKAL\" (1997). Notable major examples of these drugs have included the DOx psychedelic DOM, the 2C psychedelic 2C-B, and the MDxx entactogen MDMA, among others. However, MDMA was not an original creation of Shulgin's but had previously been first synthesized in 1912 and had surfaced as a recreational drug related to MDA by the mid- to late-1960s. Instead, Shulgin had merely served to help popularize and spread awareness about MDMA and its unique effects.\nMDMA became outlawed in the mid-1980s. In response to this, the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) was founded by Rick Doblin in 1986 and began efforts to develop MDMA and other psychedelics as medicines. American chemist David E. Nichols has developed numerous novel psychedelics and entactogens from the 1970s to present. Swiss chemist Daniel Trachsel, sometimes referred to as the \"German Shulgin\", has also developed and published numerous novel psychedelics as well as entactogens since the 1990s.\nNBOMe psychedelics such as 25I-NBOMe, derived from structural modification of 2C psychedelics, were first described by Ralf Heim and colleagues by 2000. The NBOMe drugs were subsequently encountered as novel recreational drugs by 2010, and by 2012 had eclipsed other psychedelics like LSD and psilocybin-containing mushrooms in popularity, at least for a time.\nPsychedelics, serotonin, and their actions.\nSerotonin, also known as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and originally called enteramine, was discovered by Vittorio Erspamer in the 1930s and its structural identity was fully characterized in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Serotonin was discovered in the brain by Betty Twarog and Irvine Page in 1953. It was quickly noticed that LSD contains the serotonin-like tryptamine scaffold within its chemical structure. Shortly thereafter, it was found that LSD showed serotonin-like effects and could antagonize serotonin in certain assays. Studies in the 1960s and 1970s showed that various serotonin antagonists could block the behavioral effects of psychedelics in animals. It was first proposed that LSD may be acting as an agonist of serotonin receptors by N. E. And\u00e9n and colleagues in 1968. The serotonin receptors, including the serotonin 5-HT2 receptors, were identified by the late 1970s. Mediation of the hallucinogenic effects of psychedelics specifically by serotonin 5-HT2 receptor agonism was proposed by Richard Glennon and other researchers by the early 1980s. The human serotonin 5-HT2A receptor was first cloned in 1990. The hallucinogenic effects of psilocybin in humans were shown to be blocked by the selective serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin by Franz Vollenweider and colleagues in 1998, solidifying theoretical notions that agonism of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor mediates the hallucinogenic effects of serotonergic psychedelics.\nPsychedelic renaissance.\nSince the prohibition of the 1960s and 1970s, clinical research into psychedelics started to resume by the 1990s, for instance the studies of DMT by Rick Strassman, and they have once again started to be developed as pharmaceutical drugs for potential medical use. A so-called \"psychedelic renaissance\", in which interest in psychedelics has resurged, began in the late 2010s and early 2020s. Michael Pollan's 2018 book \"How to Change Your Mind\", which was also adapted into a Netflix series in 2022, was especially impactful in terms of increasing mainstream awareness and interest in psychedelics. More than 100clinical trials of four major psychedelics, including psilocybin, LSD, ayahuasca, and MDMA, were identified as being underway in 2024.\nSociety and culture.\nEtymology and nomenclature.\nThe term \"psychedelic\" was coined by the psychiatrist Humphrey Osmond during written correspondence with author Aldous Huxley (written in a rhyme: \"To fathom Hell or soar angelic/Just take a pinch of psychedelic.\") and presented to the New York Academy of Sciences by Osmond in 1957. It is irregularly derived from the Greek words \u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u03ae (\"psych\u1e17\", meaning 'mind, soul') and \u03b4\u03b7\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03bd (\"d\u0113le\u00edn\", meaning 'to manifest'), with the intended meaning \"mind manifesting\" or alternatively \"soul manifesting\", and the implication that psychedelics can reveal unused potentials of the human mind. The term was loathed by American ethnobotanist Richard Schultes but championed by American psychologist Timothy Leary.\nAldous Huxley had suggested his own coinage \"phanerothyme\" (Greek \"phaneroein\"- \"to make manifest or visible\" and Greek \"thymos\" \"soul\", thus \"to reveal the soul\") to Osmond in 1956. Recently, the term entheogen (meaning \"that which produces the divine within\") has come into use to denote the use of psychedelic drugs, as well as various other types of psychoactive substances, in a religious, spiritual, and mystical context.\nIn 2004, David E. Nichols wrote the following about the nomenclature used for psychedelic drugs:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Many different names have been proposed over the years for this drug class. The famous German toxicologist Louis Lewin used the name phantastica earlier in this century, and as we shall see later, such a descriptor is not so farfetched. The most popular names\u2014hallucinogen, psychotomimetic, and psychedelic (\"mind manifesting\")\u2014have often been used interchangeably. \"Hallucinogen\" is now, however, the most common designation in the scientific literature, although it is an inaccurate descriptor of the actual effects of these drugs. In the lay press, the term \"psychedelic\" is still the most popular and has held sway for nearly four decades. Most recently, there has been a movement in nonscientific circles to recognize the ability of these substances to provoke mystical experiences and evoke feelings of spiritual significance. Thus, the term \"entheogen\", derived from the Greek word \"entheos\", which means \"god within\", was introduced by Ruck et al. and has seen increasing use. This term suggests that these substances reveal or allow a connection to the \"divine within\". Although it seems unlikely that this name will ever be accepted in formal scientific circles, its use has dramatically increased in the popular media and on internet sites. Indeed, in much of the counterculture that uses these substances, entheogen has replaced psychedelic as the name of choice and we may expect to see this trend continue.\nRobin Carhart-Harris and Guy Goodwin write that the term \"psychedelic\" is preferable to \"hallucinogen\" for describing classical psychedelics because of the term \"hallucinogen\"'s \"arguably misleading emphasis on these compounds' hallucinogenic properties.\"\nWhile the term \"psychedelic\" is most commonly used to refer only to serotonergic hallucinogens, it is sometimes used for a much broader range of drugs, including entactogens, dissociatives, and atypical hallucinogens/psychoactives such as \"Amanita muscaria\", \"Cannabis sativa\", \"Nymphaea nouchali\" and \"Salvia divinorum\". Thus, the term \"serotonergic psychedelic\" is sometimes used for the narrower class. It is important to check the definition of a given source. This article uses the more common, narrower definition of \"psychedelic\".\nSurrounding culture.\nPsychedelic culture includes manifestations such as psychedelic music, psychedelic art, psychedelic literature, psychedelic film, and psychedelic festivals. Examples of psychedelic music are found in the work of 1960s rock bands like the Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, The 13th Floor Elevators, and Syd Barrett-era Pink Floyd. Many psychedelic bands and elements of the psychedelic subculture originated in San Francisco during the mid to late 1960s.\nLegal status.\nMany psychedelics are classified under Schedule I of the United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971 as drugs with the greatest potential to cause harm and no acceptable medical uses. In addition, many countries have analogue laws; for example, in the United States, the Federal Analogue Act of 1986 automatically forbids any drugs sharing similar chemical structures or chemical formulas to prohibited substances if sold for human consumption.\nIn July 2022, though, under the United States Food and Drug Administration, the drug psilocybin was on track to be approved of as a treatment for depression, and MDMA as a treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder.\nU.S. states such as Oregon and Colorado have also instituted decriminalization and legalization measures for accessing psychedelics and states like New Hampshire are attempting to do the same. J.D. Tuccille argues that increasing rates of use of psychedelics in defiance of the law are likely to result in more widespread legalization and decriminalization of access to the substances in the United States (as has happened with alcohol and cannabis).\nResearch.\nTherapeutic effects.\nPsychedelic substances which may have therapeutic uses include psilocybin, LSD, and mescaline. During the 1950s and 1960s, lack of informed consent in some scientific trials on psychedelics led to significant, long-lasting harm to some participants. Since then, research regarding the effectiveness of psychedelic therapy has been conducted under strict ethical guidelines, with fully informed consent and a pre-screening to avoid people with psychosis taking part. Psychedelics, particularly psilocybin, show potential therapeutic benefits for depression, anxiety, and other mental disorders, with generally mild and transient adverse effects.\nIt has long been known that psychedelics promote neurite growth and neuroplasticity and are potent psychoplastogens. There is evidence that psychedelics induce molecular and cellular adaptations related to neuroplasticity and that these could potentially underlie therapeutic benefits.\nThe British critical psychiatrist Joanna Moncrieff has critiqued the use and study of psychedelic and related drugs like psilocybin, MDMA, and ketamine for treatment of psychiatric disorders, highlighting concerns including excessive hype around these drugs, questionable biologically-based theories of benefit, blurred lines between medical and recreational use, flawed clinical trial findings, financial conflicts of interest, strong expectancy effects and large placebo responses, small and short-term benefits over placebo, and their potential for difficult experiences and adverse effects.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "53310", "revid": "43254542", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53310", "title": "Vaccinium", "text": "Genus of berry-producing shrubs in the heath family\nVaccinium is a common and widespread genus of shrubs or dwarf shrubs in the heath family (Ericaceae). The fruits of many species are eaten by humans and some are of commercial importance, including the cranberry, blueberry, bilberry (whortleberry), lingonberry (cowberry), and huckleberry. Like many other heath plants, they are restricted to acidic soils.\nDescription.\nThe plant structure varies between species: some trail along the ground, some are dwarf shrubs, and some are larger shrubs perhaps tall. Some tropical species are epiphytic. Stems are usually woody. Species found in tropical bioregions like Malesia are evergreen.\nFlowers are epigynous with fused petals and have long styles that protrude from their bell-shaped corollas. Stamens have anthers with extended tube-like structures called \"awns\" through which pollen falls when mature. Inflorescences can be axillary or terminal.\nThe fruit develops from an inferior ovary and is a four- or five-parted berry; it is usually brightly coloured, often red or bluish with purple juice. Its seeds are small and smooth on the surface. Roots are commonly mycorrhizal, which likely help the plants to access nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus in the acidic, nutrient-poor soils they inhabit.\nTaxonomy.\nThe genus was first described scientifically by Carl Linnaeus in 1753. The name \"Vaccinium\" was used in classical Latin for a plant, possibly the bilberry or a hyacinth, and may be derived from the Latin \"bacca\", meaning berry, although its ultimate derivation is obscure. It is not the same word as \"Vaccinum\", which means \"of or pertaining to cows\".\nThe taxonomy of the genus is complex and still under investigation. Genetic analyses indicate that the genus \"Vaccinium\" is not monophyletic. A number of the Asian species are more closely related to \"Agapetes\" than to other \"Vaccinium\" species. A second group includes most of \"Orthaea\" and \"Notopora\", at least some of \"Gaylussacia\" (huckleberry), and a number of species from \"Vaccinium\", such as \"V.\u00a0crassifolium\". Other parts of \"Vaccinium\" form other groups, sometimes together with species of other genera. The taxonomy of \"Vaccinium\" can either be resolved by enlarging the genus to include the entirety of the tribe Vaccinieae or by breaking the genus up into several genera.\nTwo fossil seeds of \"V. minutulum\" have been extracted from borehole samples of the Middle Miocene freshwater deposits in Nowy Sacz Basin, West Carpathians, Poland.\nSubgenera.\nA classification predating molecular phylogeny divides \"Vaccinium\" into subgenera and several sections:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nDistribution and habitat.\nThe genus contains about 450 species, which are found mostly in the cooler areas of the Northern Hemisphere. However, there are tropical species from areas as widely separated as Madagascar and Hawaii. The genus is distributed worldwide except for Australia and Antarctica, but areas of great \"Vaccinium\" diversity include the montane regions of North and South America, as well as Southeast Asia. Species are still being discovered in the Andes.\nPlants of this group typically require acidic soils, and as wild plants, they live in habitats such as heath, bog and acidic woodland (for example, blueberries under oaks or pines). Blueberry plants are commonly found in oak-heath forests in eastern North America. \"Vaccinium\" is found in both successional and stable sites, and it is fire-adapted in many regions, withstanding low-intensity burns, and re-sprouting from rhizomes when above-ground tissues are burned off.\nEcology.\n\"Vaccinium\" species are used as food plants by the larvae of a number of Lepidoptera (butterfly and moth) species. Berries of North American species nourish a variety of mammals and birds, notably including the grizzly bear.\nCultivation.\nBlueberries (sect. Cyanococcus) and cranberries (sect. Oxycoccus) are relatively newly cultivated plants and are largely unchanged from their wild relatives. Genetic breeding of blueberries began around the turn of the 20th century. It was spearheaded by Frederick Coville, who performed many cross-breeding trials and produced dozens of new blueberry cultivars. He often tested new cultivars for their flavor, claiming after a long day of tasting that \"all blueberries taste the same, and all taste sour.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "53311", "revid": "48736052", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53311", "title": "Hermann von Helmholtz", "text": "German physicist and physiologist (1821\u20131894)\nHermann Ludwig Ferdinand von Helmholtz (; ; 31 August 1821 \u2013 8 September 1894; \"von\" since 1883) was a German physicist and physician who made significant contributions in several scientific fields, particularly hydrodynamic stability. The Helmholtz Association, the largest German association of research institutions, was named in his honour.\nIn the fields of physiology and psychology, Helmholtz is known for his mathematics concerning the eye, theories of vision, ideas on the visual perception of space, colour vision research, the sensation of tone, perceptions of sound, and empiricism in the physiology of perception. In physics, he is known for his theories on the conservation of energy and on the electrical double layer, work in electrodynamics, chemical thermodynamics, and on a mechanical foundation of thermodynamics. Although credit is shared with Julius von Mayer, James Joule, and Daniel Bernoulli\u2014among others\u2014for the energy conservation principles that eventually led to the first law of thermodynamics, he is credited with the first formulation of the energy conservation principle in its maximally general form.\nAs a philosopher, he is known for his philosophy of science, ideas on the relation between the laws of perception and the laws of nature, the science of aesthetics, and ideas on the civilizing power of science. By the late nineteenth century, Helmholtz's development of a broadly Kantian methodology, including the \"a priori\" determination of the manifold of possible orientations in perceptual space, had inspired new readings of Kant and contributed to the late modern neo-Kantianism movement in philosophy.\nBiography.\nEarly years.\nHelmholtz was born in Potsdam, the son of the local gymnasium headmaster, Ferdinand Helmholtz, who had studied classical philology and philosophy, and who was a close friend of the publisher and philosopher Immanuel Hermann Fichte. Helmholtz's work was influenced by the philosophy of Johann Gottlieb Fichte and Immanuel Kant. He tried to trace their theories in empirical matters like physiology.\nAs a young man, Helmholtz was interested in natural science, but his father wanted him to study medicine. Helmholtz earned a medical doctorate at Medizinisch-chirurgisches Friedrich-Wilhelm-Institute in 1842 and served a one-year internship at the Charit\u00e9 hospital (because there was financial support for medical students).\nTrained primarily in physiology, Helmholtz wrote on many other topics, ranging from theoretical physics to the age of the Earth, and to the origin of the Solar System.\nUniversity posts.\nHelmholtz's first academic position was as a teacher of anatomy at the Academy of Arts in Berlin in 1848. He then moved to take a post of associate professor of physiology at the Prussian University of K\u00f6nigsberg, where he was appointed in 1849. In 1855 he accepted a full professorship of anatomy and physiology at the University of Bonn. He was not particularly happy in Bonn, however, and three years later he transferred to the University of Heidelberg, in Baden, where he served as professor of physiology. In 1871 he accepted his final university position, as professor of physics at the Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin.\nResearch.\nMechanics.\nHis first important scientific achievement, an 1847 treatise on the conservation of energy, was written in the context of his medical studies and philosophical background. His work on energy conservation came about while studying muscle metabolism. He tried to demonstrate that no energy is lost in muscle movement, motivated by the implication that there were no \"vital forces\" necessary to move a muscle. This was a rejection of the speculative tradition of \"Naturphilosophie\" and vitalism which was at that time a dominant philosophical paradigm in German physiology. He was working against the argument, promoted by some vitalists, that \"living force\" can power a machine indefinitely.\nDrawing on the earlier work of Sadi Carnot, Beno\u00eet Paul \u00c9mile Clapeyron and James Prescott Joule, he postulated a relationship between mechanics, heat, light, electricity and magnetism by treating them all as manifestations of a single \"force\", or energy in today's terminology. He published his theories in his book \"\u00dcber die Erhaltung der Kraft\" (\"On the Conservation of Force\", 1847).\nIn the 1850s and 60s, building on the publications of William Thomson, Helmholtz and William Rankine helped popularize the idea of the heat death of the universe.\nIn fluid dynamics, Helmholtz made several contributions, including Helmholtz's theorems for vortex dynamics in inviscid fluids.\nSensory physiology.\nHelmholtz was a pioneer in the scientific study of human vision and audition. Inspired by psychophysics, he was interested in the relationships between measurable physical stimuli and their correspondent human perceptions. For example, the amplitude of a sound wave can be varied, causing the sound to appear louder or softer, but a linear step in sound pressure amplitude does not result in a linear step in perceived loudness. The physical sound needs to be increased exponentially in order for equal steps to seem linear, a fact that is used in current electronic devices to control volume. Helmholtz paved the way in experimental studies on the relationship between the physical energy (physics) and its appreciation (psychology), with the goal in mind to develop \"psychophysical laws\".\nThe sensory physiology of Helmholtz was the basis of the work of Wilhelm Wundt, Helmholtz's student, who is considered one of the founders of experimental psychology. More explicitly than Helmholtz, Wundt described his research as a form of empirical philosophy and as a study of the mind as something separate. Helmholtz had, in his early repudiation of Naturphilosophie, stressed the importance of materialism, and was focusing more on the unity of \"mind\" and body.\nOphthalmic optics.\nIn 1851, Helmholtz revolutionized the field of ophthalmology with the invention of the ophthalmoscope; an instrument used to examine the inside of the human eye. This made him world-famous overnight. Helmholtz's interests at that time were increasingly focused on the physiology of the senses. His main publication, titled \"Handbuch der Physiologischen Optik\" (\"Handbook of Physiological Optics\" or \"Treatise on Physiological Optics\"; English translation of the 3rd volume https://), provided empirical theories on depth perception, colour vision, and motion perception, and became the fundamental reference work in his field during the second half of the nineteenth century. In the third and final volume, published in 1867, Helmholtz described the importance of unconscious inferences for perception. The \"Handbuch\" was first translated into English under the editorship of James P. C. Southall on behalf of the Optical Society of America in 1924\u20135. His theory of accommodation went unchallenged until the final decade of the 20th century.\nHelmholtz continued to work for several decades on several editions of the handbook, frequently updating his work because of his dispute with Ewald Hering who held opposite views on spatial and colour vision. This dispute divided the discipline of physiology during the second half of the 1800s.\nNerve physiology.\nIn 1849, while at K\u00f6nigsberg, Helmholtz measured the speed at which the signal is carried along a nerve fibre. At that time most people believed that nerve signals passed along nerves immeasurably fast. He used a recently dissected sciatic nerve of a frog and the calf muscle to which it attached. He used a galvanometer as a sensitive timing device, attaching a mirror to the needle to reflect a light beam across the room to a scale which gave much greater sensitivity. Helmholtz reported transmission speeds in the range of 24.6 \u2013 38.4 meters per second.\nAcoustics and aesthetics.\nIn 1863, Helmholtz published \"Sensations of Tone\", once again demonstrating his interest in the physics of perception. This book influenced musicologists into the twentieth century. Helmholtz invented the Helmholtz resonator to identify the various frequencies or pitches of the pure sine wave components of complex sounds containing multiple tones.\nHelmholtz showed that different combinations of resonators could mimic vowel sounds: Alexander Graham Bell in particular was interested in this but, not being able to read German, misconstrued Helmholtz's diagrams as meaning that Helmholtz had transmitted multiple frequencies by wire\u2014which would allow multiplexing of telegraph signals\u2014whereas, in reality, electrical power was used only to keep the resonators in motion. Bell failed to reproduce what he thought Helmholtz had done but later said that, had he been able to read German, he would not have gone on to invent the telephone on the harmonic telegraph principle.\nThe translation by Alexander J. Ellis was first published in 1875 (the first English edition was from the 1870 third German edition; Ellis's second English edition from the 1877 fourth German edition was published in 1885; the 1895 and 1912 third and fourth English editions were reprints of the second).\nElectromagnetism.\nHelmholtz studied electrical oscillations from 1869 to 1871, and in a lecture delivered to the Naturhistorisch-medizinischen Verein zu Heidelberg (Natural History and Medical Association of Heidelberg) on 30 April 1869, titled \"On Electrical Oscillations\", he indicated that the perceptible damped electrical oscillations in a coil connected to a Leyden jar were about &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u204450 second in duration.\nIn 1871, Helmholtz moved from Heidelberg to Berlin to become a professor of physics. He became interested in electromagnetism, and the Helmholtz equation is named for him. Although he made no major contributions to this field, his student Heinrich Rudolf Hertz became famous as the first to demonstrate electromagnetic radiation. Oliver Heaviside criticised Helmholtz's electromagnetic theory because it allowed the existence of longitudinal waves. Based on work on Maxwell's equations, Heaviside pronounced that longitudinal waves could not exist in a vacuum or a homogeneous medium. Heaviside did not note, however, that longitudinal electromagnetic waves can exist at a boundary or in an enclosed space.\nPhilosophy.\nHelmholtz's scientific work in physiology and mechanics occasioned much that he is known for in philosophy of science, including ideas on the relation between the laws of perception and the laws of nature and his rejection of the exclusive use of Euclidean geometry.\nHis philosophy of science wavered between some version of empiricism and transcendentalism. Despite the speculative associations of the latter, his philosophy of science is thoroughly indebted to his use of mathematical physics to supplant vitalism and articulate the general conservation of energy principle.\nHis rejection of Euclidean geometry as the only possible science of space is central to understanding his appropriation of Kant's philosophy of space, which ostensibly requires Euclidean geometry to be that exclusive \"a priori\" science of physical space. Helmholtz introduced a new conception of the \"a priori\" in space: that of the determination of the manifold of possible orientations in perceptual space. These developments inspired new readings of Kant and contributed to the rise of late modern neo-Kantianism movement in philosophy.\nStudents and associates.\nOther students and research associates of Helmholtz at Berlin included Max Planck, Heinrich Kayser, Eugen Goldstein, Wilhelm Wien, Arthur K\u00f6nig, Henry Augustus Rowland, Albert A. Michelson, Wilhelm Wundt, Fernando Sanford, Arthur Gordon Webster and Michael I. Pupin. Leo Koenigsberger, who was his colleague from 1869 to 1871 in Heidelberg, wrote the definitive biography of him in 1902."}

{"id": "53315", "revid": "31192532", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53315", "title": "Ewald Hering", "text": "German physiologist\nKarl Ewald Konstantin Hering (5 August 1834 \u2013 26 January 1918) was a German physiologist who did much research in color vision, binocular perception, eye movements, and hyperacuity. He proposed opponent color theory in 1892.\nBorn in Alt-Gersdorf, Kingdom of Saxony, Hering studied at the University of Leipzig and became the first rector of the German Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague.\nBiography.\nEarly years.\nHering was born in Alt-Gersdorf in Saxony, Germany. He probably grew up in a poor family, son of a Lutheran pastor. Hering attended gymnasium in Zittau and entered the university of Leipzig in 1853. There he studied philosophy, zoology and medicine. He completed an M.D. degree in 1860.\nIt is somewhat unclear how Hering trained to do research. At the time Johannes Peter M\u00fcller was perhaps the most famous physiologist in Germany. Hering seems to have applied for studying under his direction but was rejected, which might have contributed to his animosity towards Hermann von Helmholtz, M\u00fcller's prot\u00e9g\u00e9. However, in Leipzig, E. H. Weber and G. T. Fechner were conducting groundbreaking studies founding what would become the field of psychophysics. Although there is no evidence that Hering ever studied under their direction, in his later years he proudly acknowledged himself a \"student of Fechner\".\nAfter graduating, Hering practiced as a physician in Leipzig. Despite having little time to do research and having even scarcer financial resources, he turned to binocular vision (using both eyes together) and the problem of the horopter (the points in space that project on anatomically identical points on the two retinas). There, he surprised the scientific community when he published, as a completely unknown scientist, his own mathematical derivation of the horopter independently from Hermann von Helmholtz, who was by then considered one of the best German scientists and mathematicians. Hering went as far as ridiculing Helmholtz's (unimportant) mathematical errors in his derivation of the horopter.\nUniversity posts.\nHering was subsequently appointed professor of physiology at the military academy of Vienna until 1870. With better resources he conducted important studies in physiology, in particular on the cardiac and respiratory systems. In 1870, he succeeded Jan Evangelista Purkinje at the university of Prague where he remained for the next 25 years. There he became involved in fierce arguments between nationalistic Czechs who wanted the university taught in the language of the land, and a minority of German professors. Eventually a separate German university, Charles-Ferdinand University, was created in 1882 and Hering became its first rector.\nIn his late years, Hering returned to Germany, where he became professor at the university of Leipzig in 1895, aged 61. He retired in 1915 and died of tuberculosis three years later. He was an atheist.\nResearch.\nBinocular vision.\nHering studied a broad range of subjects in vision, among them his outstanding studies on binocular vision.\n He derived, almost simultaneously with Helmholtz, the theoretical shape of the horopter. Despite identical results, Hering's derivation was far more modern and elegant, using recently developed projective geometry. Indeed, Helmholtz himself qualified Hering's approach as \"very elegant, comprehensive and complete\". Subsequently, Hering empirically estimated the shape of the horopter. Alongside with Helmholtz and Hillebrand, he noticed that the empirical horopter does not match the theoretical horopter, a phenomenon now named the Hering\u2013Hillebrand deviation.\nHering is also well known for his Law of Visual Direction which describes the perceived egocentric direction of an object from an observer. Unbeknownst to Hering and other visual scientists of the time, a similar law had been proposed by Alhazen (1021) and Wells (1792) \nalthough both their laws were different.\nHyperacuity.\nHering did seminal work on what we now call hyperacuity: spatial resolution in certain visual tasks that exceeds visual acuity by about an order of magnitude. In his famous 1899 treatise \"On the Limits of Visual Acuity\" he summarized empirical data published 1863 by Alfred Wilhelm Volkmann and Ernst Anton W\u00fclfing 1892 who found that there are visual tasks in which spatial resolution goes well below the size of receptor cells in the central retina. In an explanatory model, Hering superimposed a Vernier acuity stimulus \u2013 a disalignment among two line segments \u2013 onto an idealized receptor array. He argued that, by a mechanism of integration across small eye movements, the location information signalled by the involved receptors is coded to a much higher precision than would be possible by a single receptor, an explanation that still holds up today.\nEye movements.\nHering further studied eye movements. He developed the Hering's law of equal innervation to describe the conjugacy of eye movements in animals. According to this law eye movements are always equal in intensity in the two eyes but not in direction. Eye movements can therefore be either conjugate (in the same direction such as saccades or smooth pursuit) or disjunctive (such as vergence eye movements). Hering's law of equal innervation is best described by M\u00fcller's stimulus where the fixation point changes position in 1 eye but not the other eye. Simplicity conducts that only the misaligned eye should move to refoveate. Hering's law predicts that because the eyes must always move by equal amounts, both eyes should move in the new binocular direction of the target (see Hering's law of visual direction above), then move in opposite direction to adjust vergence to that of the target. In other words, the eye in which the target did not move will move away and then back at the target. This prediction was experimentally confirmed by Yarbus in his seminal work on eye movements. However it is now known that strong deviations from Hering's law exist.\nColor theory.\nHering disagreed with the leading theory developed primarily by Thomas Young, James Clerk Maxwell and Hermann von Helmholtz. \nYoung proposed that color vision is based on three primary colors: red, green, and blue. Maxwell demonstrated that any color can be matched by a mixture of three primary colors. This was interpreted by Helmholtz as proof that humans perceive colors through three types of receptors, while white and black would reflect the amount of light.\nHering instead held that the visual system works based on a system of color opponency. His evidence stemmed from color-adaptation experiments and the linguistic observation that certain color names cannot be combined into one. In this model, colors are perceived through mechanisms sensitive to three pairs of opponent colors: red-green, yellow-blue and white-black.\nJohannes von Kries published in 1905 the \"zone theory\" that synthesizes both descriptions as one, where the Young-Helmholtz theory describes the interaction of light with receptors and Hering the image processing stage.\nLater, in 1925, Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger published a paper inspired by von Kries, titled \"On the relation of the four color to the three color theory\". There he probes a formal relationship between the two color theories.\nBoth theories have solid empirical evidence. The conundrum was resolved by the discovery of color-opponent ganglion cells in the retina and lateral geniculate nucleus. We now know that the human eye possesses three types of color-sensitive receptors (as proposed by Young, Maxwell, and Helmholtz) which then combine their signals in three color-opponent channels as proposed by Hering. Thus, both the Hering and Young-Helmholtz theories are correct.\nPhysiology.\nHering made significant contributions to the field of physiology as well as psychology. In particular he demonstrated with his student Breuer the Hering\u2013Breuer reflex, or that artificially inflating the lungs triggers an automatic signal triggering expiration. Then deflating the lungs in turns triggers a new signal inducing respiration. That is, inspirations and expirations are an endless reflex loop triggering each other. He also showed the Traube-Hering reflex, or that inflating the lungs triggers an acceleration of the heart.\nOther research.\nIn 1861, Hering described an optical illusion which now bears his name \u2013 the Hering illusion. When two straight and parallel lines are presented in front of radial background (similar to the spokes of a bicycle), the lines appear as if they were bowed outwards. The Orbison illusion is one of its variants, while the Wundt illusion produces a similar, but inverted effect.\nHering first suggested the idea of organic memory in an 1870 lecture for the Imperial Academy of Science in Vienna. Hering took influence from the idea of inheritance of acquired characteristics and suggested that memories could be passed on through generations by germ cells.\nThe Hering-Helmholtz controversy.\nHering spent most of his life arguing violently with Helmholtz. The controversy was not only scientific but also philosophical; Hering was a nativist, Helmholtz an empiricist. Helmholtz also came from a higher social class and was always considered a prodigy, whereas Hering had to go through a harder time in his early career. Hering and Helmholtz disagreed on almost everything and the controversy lasted long after the end of both of their lives. Hering however was by far the more aggressive of the two, and was always prompt to point out any mistake that Helmholtz might have made, sometimes even going so far as to insult him (\"It is likely that the great Helmholtz in his dozing state...\"). Helmholtz's faction (though probably not Helmholtz himself) spread rumors which accorded to Hering the need for help to do his mathematical work and that he was clinically insane (\"He has been, as I have heard, mentally ill\").\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

About 15,000,000 people visit the palace, park, or gardens of Versailles every year, making it one of the most popular tourist attractions in the world.\nLouis XIII built a hunting lodge at Versailles in 1623. His successor, Louis XIV, expanded the ch\u00e2teau into a palace that went through several expansions in phases from 1661 to 1715. It was a favourite residence for both kings, and in 1682, Louis XIV moved the seat of his court and government to Versailles, making the palace the \"de facto\" capital of France. This state of affairs was continued by Kings Louis XV and Louis XVI, who primarily made interior alterations to the palace, but in 1789 the royal family and French court returned to Paris. For the rest of the French Revolution, the Palace of Versailles was largely abandoned and emptied of its contents, and the population of the surrounding city plummeted.\nNapoleon, following his coronation as Emperor, used the subsidiary palace, Grand Trianon, as a summer residence from 1810 to 1814, but did not use the main palace. Following the Bourbon Restoration, when the king was returned to the throne, he resided in Paris and it was not until the 1830s that meaningful repairs were made to the palace. A museum of French history was installed within it, replacing the courtiers apartments of the southern wing.\nThe palace and park were designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1979 for its importance as the centre of power, art, and science in France during the 17th and 18th centuries. The French Ministry of Culture has placed the palace, its gardens, and some of its subsidiary structures on its list of culturally significant monuments.\nHistory.\nIn 1623, Louis XIII, king of France, built a hunting lodge on a hill in a favourite hunting ground, west of Paris, and from his primary residence, the Ch\u00e2teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye. The site, near a village named Versailles, was a wooded wetland that Louis XIII's court scorned as being generally unworthy of a king; one of his courtiers, Fran\u00e7ois de Bassompierre, wrote that the lodge \"would not inspire vanity in even the simplest gentleman\". From 1631 to 1634, architect Philibert Le Roy replaced the lodge with a ch\u00e2teau for Louis XIII, who forbade his queen, Anne of Austria, from staying there overnight, even when an outbreak of smallpox at Saint-Germain-en-Laye in 1641 forced Louis XIII to relocate to Versailles with his three-year-old heir, the future Louis XIV.\nWhen Louis XIII died in 1643, Anne became Louis XIV's regent, and Louis XIII's ch\u00e2teau was abandoned for the next decade. She moved the court back to Paris, where Anne and her chief minister, Cardinal Mazarin, continued Louis XIII's unpopular monetary practices. This led to the Fronde, a series of revolts against royal authority from 1648 to 1653 that masked a struggle between Mazarin and the princes of the blood, Louis XIV's extended family, for influence over him. In the aftermath of the Fronde, Louis XIV became determined to rule alone. Following Mazarin's death in 1661, Louis XIV reformed his government to exclude his mother and the princes of the blood, moved the court back to Saint-Germain-en-Laye, and ordered the expansion of his father's ch\u00e2teau at Versailles into a palace.\nLouis XIV had hunted at Versailles in the 1650s, but did not take any special interest in Versailles until 1661. On 17 August 1661, Louis XIV was a guest at a sumptuous festival hosted by Nicolas Fouquet, the Superintendent of Finances, at his palatial residence, the Ch\u00e2teau de Vaux-le-Vicomte. Louis XIV was impressed by the ch\u00e2teau and its gardens, which were the work of Louis Le Vau, the court architect since 1654, Andr\u00e9 Le N\u00f4tre, the royal gardener since 1657, and Charles Le Brun, a painter in royal service since 1647. Vaux-le-Vicomte's scale and opulence led him to imprison Fouquet that September, as he had also built an island fortress and a private army. But Louis XIV was also inspired by Vaux-le-Vicomte, and he recruited its authors for his own projects. Louis XIV replaced Fouquet with Jean-Baptiste Colbert, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Mazarin and enemy of Fouquet, and charged him with managing the corps of artisans in royal employment. Colbert acted as the intermediary between them and Louis XIV, who personally directed and inspected the planning and construction of Versailles.\nConstruction.\nWork at Versailles was at first concentrated on gardens, and through the 1660s, Le Vau only added two detached service wings and a forecourt to the ch\u00e2teau. But in 1668\u201369, as a response to the growth of the gardens, and the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668), Louis XIV decided to turn Versailles into a full-scale royal residence. He vacillated between replacing or incorporating his father's ch\u00e2teau, but settled on the latter by the end of the decade, and from 1668 to 1671, Louis XIII's ch\u00e2teau was encased on three sides in a feature dubbed the \"enveloppe\". This gave the ch\u00e2teau a new, Italianate fa\u00e7ade overlooking the gardens, but preserved the courtyard fa\u00e7ade, resulting in a mix of styles and materials that dismayed Louis XIV and that Colbert described as a \"patchwork\". Attempts to homogenize the two fa\u00e7ades failed, and in 1670 Le Vau died, leaving the post of First Architect to the King vacant for the next seven years.\nLe Vau was succeeded at Versailles by his assistant, architect Fran\u00e7ois d'Orbay. Work at the palace during the 1670s focused on its interiors, as the palace was then nearing completion, though d'Orbay expanded Le Vau's service wings and connected them to the ch\u00e2teau, and built a pair of pavilions for government employees in the forecourt. In 1670, d'Orbay was tasked by Louis XIV with designing a city, also called Versailles, to house and service Louis XIV's growing government and court. The granting of land to courtiers for the construction of townhouses that resembled the palace began in 1671. The next year, the Franco-Dutch War began and funding for Versailles was cut until 1674, when Louis XIV had work begun on the Ambassadors' Staircase, a grand staircase for the reception of guests, and demolished the last of the village of Versailles.\nFollowing the end of the Franco-Dutch War with French victory in 1678, Louis XIV appointed as First Architect Jules Hardouin-Mansart, an experienced architect in Louis XIV's confidence, who would benefit from a restored budget and large workforce of former soldiers. Mansart began his tenure with the addition from 1678 to 1681 of the Hall of Mirrors, a renovation of the courtyard fa\u00e7ade of Louis XIII's ch\u00e2teau, and the expansion of d'Orbay's pavilions to create the Ministers' Wings in 1678\u201379. Adjacent to the palace, Hardouin-Mansart built a pair of stables called the Grande and Petite \u00c9curies from 1679 to 1682 and the Grand Commun, which housed the palace's servants and general kitchens, from 1682 to 1684. Hardouin-Mansart also added two entirely new wings in Le Vau's Italianate style to house the court, first at the south end of the palace from 1679 to 1681 and then at its north end from 1685 to 1689.\nWar and the resulting diminished funding slowed construction at Versailles for the rest of the 17th century. The Nine Years' War, which began in 1688, stopped work altogether until 1698. Three years later, however, the even more expensive War of the Spanish Succession began and, combined with poor harvests in 1693\u201394 and 1709\u201310, plunged France into crisis. Louis XIV thus slashed funding and cancelled some of the work Hardouin-Mansart had planned in the 1680s, such as the remodelling of the courtyard fa\u00e7ade in the Italianate style. Louis XIV and Hardouin-Mansart focused on a permanent palace chapel, the construction of which lasted from 1699 to 1710.\nLouis XIV's successors, Louis XV and Louis XVI, largely left Versailles as they inherited it and focused on the palace's interiors. Louis XV's modifications began in the 1730s, with the completion of the Salon d'Hercule, a ballroom in the north wing, and the expansion of the king's private apartment, which required the demolition of the Ambassadors' Staircase. In 1748, Louis XV began construction of a palace theatre, the Royal Opera of Versailles at the northernmost end of the palace, but completion was delayed until 1770; construction was interrupted in the 1740s by the War of the Austrian Succession and then again in 1756 with the start of the Seven Years' War. These wars emptied the royal treasury and thereafter construction was mostly funded by Madame du Barry, Louis XV's favourite mistress. In 1771, Louis XV had the northern Ministers' Wing rebuilt in Neoclassical style by Ange-Jacques Gabriel, his court architect, as it was in the process of falling down. That work was also stopped by financial constraints, and it remained incomplete when Louis XV died in 1774. In 1784, Louis XVI briefly moved the royal family to the Ch\u00e2teau de Saint-Cloud ahead of more renovations to the Palace of Versailles, but construction could not begin because of financial difficulty and political crisis. In 1789, the French Revolution swept the royal family and government out of Versailles forever.\nRole in politics and culture.\nThe Palace of Versailles was key to Louis XIV's politics, as an expression and concentration of French art and culture, and for the centralization of royal power. Louis XIV first used Versailles to promote himself with a series of nighttime festivals in its gardens in 1664, 1668, and 1674, the events of which were disseminated throughout Europe by print and engravings. As early as 1669, but especially from 1678, Louis XIV sought to make Versailles his seat of government, and he expanded the palace so as to fit the court within it. The moving of the court to Versailles did not come until 1682, however, and not officially, as opinion on Versailles was mixed among the nobility of France.\nBy 1687, however, it was evident to all that Versailles was the \"de facto\" capital of France, and Louis XIV succeeded in attracting the nobility to Versailles to pursue prestige and royal patronage within a strict court etiquette, thus eroding their traditional provincial power bases. It was at the Palace of Versailles that Louis XIV received the Doge of Genoa, Francesco Maria Imperiale Lercari in 1685, an embassy from the Ayutthaya Kingdom in 1686, and an embassy from Safavid Iran in 1715.\nLouis XIV died at Versailles on 1 September 1715 and was succeeded by his five-year-old great-grandson, Louis XV, then the duke of Anjou, who was moved to the Ch\u00e2teau de Vincennes and then to Paris by Louis XV's regent, Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans. Versailles was neglected until 1722, when Philippe II removed the court to Versailles to escape the unpopularity of his regency, and when Louis XV began his majority. The 1715 move, however, broke the cultural power of Versailles, and during the reign of Louis XVI, courtiers spent their leisure in Paris, not Versailles.\nDuring Christmas 1763, Mozart and his family visited Versailles and dined with the King. The 7-year-old Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart played several works during his stay and later dedicated his first two harpsichord sonatas, published in 1764 in Paris, to Madame Victoria, daughter of Louis XV.\nIn 1783, the palace was the site of the signing of the last two of the three treaties of the Peace of Paris (1783), which ended the American Revolutionary War. On 3 September, British and American delegates, led by Benjamin Franklin, signed the Treaty of Paris at the H\u00f4tel d'York (now 56 Rue Jacob) in Paris, granting the United States independence. On 4 September, Spain and France signed separate treaties with Britain at the Palace of Versailles, formally ending the war.\nThe King and Queen learned of the Storming of the Bastille in Paris on 14 July 1789, while they were at the palace, and remained isolated there as the Revolution in Paris spread. The growing anger in Paris led to the Women's March on Versailles on 5 October 1789. A crowd of several thousand men and women, protesting the high price and scarcity of bread, marched from the markets of Paris to Versailles. They took weapons from the city armoury, besieged the palace, and compelled the King and royal family and the members of the National Constituent Assembly to return with them to Paris the following day.\nAs soon as the royal family departed, the palace was closed. In 1792, the National Convention, the new revolutionary government, ordered the transfer of all the paintings and sculptures from the palace to the Louvre. In 1793, the Convention declared the abolition of the monarchy and ordered all of the royal property in the palace to be sold at auction. The auction took place between 25 August 1793 and 11 August 1794. The furnishings and art of the palace, including the furniture, mirrors, baths, and kitchen equipment, were sold in seventeen thousand lots. All fleurs-de-lys and royal emblems on the buildings were chambered or chiselled off. The empty buildings were turned into a storehouse for furnishings, art and libraries confiscated from the nobility. The empty grand apartments were opened for tours beginning in 1793, and a small museum of French paintings and art school was opened in some of the empty rooms.\nBy virtue of an order issued by the Versailles district directorate in August 1794, the Royal Gate was destroyed, the Cour Royale was cleared and the Cour de Marbre lost its precious floor.\n19th century \u2013 history museum and government venue.\nWhen Napoleon became Emperor of the French in 1804, he considered making Versailles his residence but abandoned the idea because of the cost of the renovation. Prior to his marriage with Marie-Louise in 1810, he had the Grand Trianon restored and refurnished as a springtime residence for himself and his family, in the style of furnishing that it is seen today.\nIn 1815, with the final downfall of Napoleon, Louis XVIII, the younger brother of Louis XVI, became king, and considered returning the royal residence to Versailles, where he had been born. He ordered the restoration of the royal apartments, but the task and cost was too great. Louis XVIII had the far end of the south wing of the \"Cour Royale\" demolished and rebuilt (1814\u20131824) to match the Gabriel wing of 1780 opposite, which gave greater uniformity of appearance to the front entrance. Neither he nor his successor Charles X lived at Versailles.\nThe French Revolution of 1830 brought a new monarch, Louis-Philippe to power, and a new ambition for Versailles. He did not reside at Versailles but began the creation of the Museum of the History of France, dedicated to \"all the glories of France\", which had been used to house some members of the royal family. The museum was begun in 1833 and inaugurated on 30 June 1837. Its most famous room is the Galerie des Batailles (Hall of Battles), which lies on most of the length of the second floor of the south wing. The museum project largely came to a halt when Louis Philippe was overthrown in 1848, though the paintings of French heroes and great battles still remain in the south wing.\nEmperor Napoleon III used the palace on occasion as a stage for grand ceremonies. One of the most lavish was the banquet that he hosted for Queen Victoria in the Royal Opera of Versailles on 25 August 1855.\nDuring the Franco-Prussian War of 1870\u20131871, the palace was occupied by the general staff of the victorious German Army. Parts of the ch\u00e2teau, including the Hall of Mirrors, were turned into a military hospital. The creation of the German Empire, combining Prussia and the surrounding German states under William I, was formally proclaimed in the Hall of Mirrors on 18 January 1871. The Germans remained in the palace until the signing of the armistice in March 1871. In that month, the government of the new Third French Republic, which had departed Paris during the war for Tours and then Bordeaux, moved into the palace. The National Assembly held its meetings in the Opera House.\nThe uprising of the Paris Commune in March 1871, prevented the French government, under Adolphe Thiers, from returning immediately to Paris. The military operation which suppressed the Commune at the end of May was directed from Versailles, and the prisoners of the Commune were marched there and put on trial in military courts. In 1875 a second parliamentary body, the French Senate, was created and held its meetings for the election of a President of the Republic in a new hall created in 1876 in the south wing of the palace. The French Senate and National Assembly continue to meet in the palace in joint session on special occasions, such as the amendment of the Constitution of France.\n20th century.\nThe end of the 19th and the early 20th century saw the beginning of restoration efforts at the palace, first led by Pierre de Nolhac, poet and scholar and the first conservator, who began his work in 1892. The conservation and restoration were interrupted by two world wars but have continued until the present day.\nThe palace returned to the world stage in June 1919, when, after six months of negotiations, the Treaty of Versailles, formally ending the First World War, was signed in the Hall of Mirrors. Between 1925 and 1928, the American philanthropist and multi-millionaire John D. Rockefeller, Jr. gave $2,166,000, the equivalent of about 38 million dollars in 2024, to restore and refurbish the palace.\nMore work took place after World War II, with the restoration of the Royal Opera of Versailles. The theatre was reopened in 1957, in the presence of Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom.\nIn 1978, parts of the palace were heavily damaged in a bombing committed by Breton terrorists.\nStarting in the 1950s, when the museum of Versailles was under the directorship of G\u00e9rald van der Kemp, the objective was to restore the palace to its state\u00a0\u2013 or as close to it as possible\u00a0\u2013 in 1789 when the royal family left the palace. Among the early projects was the repair of the roof over the Hall of Mirrors; the publicity campaign brought international attention to the plight of post-war Versailles and garnered much foreign money including a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation.\nOne of the more costly endeavours for the museum and the French Fifth Republic has been to repurchase as much of the original furnishings as possible. Consequently, because furniture with a royal provenance\u00a0\u2013 and especially furniture that was made for Versailles\u00a0\u2013 is a highly sought-after commodity on the international market, the museum has spent considerable funds on retrieving much of the palace's original furnishings.\n21st century.\nIn 2003, a new restoration initiative\u00a0\u2013 the \"Grand Versailles\" project\u00a0\u2013 was started, which began with the replanting of the gardens, which had lost over 10,000 trees during Cyclone Lothar on 26 December 1999. One part of the initiative, the restoration of the Hall of Mirrors, was completed in 2006. Another major project was the further restoration of the backstage areas of the Royal Opera of Versailles in 2007 to 2009.\nThe Palace of Versailles is currently owned by the French state. Its formal title is the Public Establishment of the Palace, Museum and National Estate of Versailles. Since 1995, it has been run as a Public Establishment, with an independent administration and management supervised by the French Ministry of Culture.\nThe grounds of the palace hosted the equestrian competition during the 2024 Summer Olympics.\nArchitecture and plan.\nThe Palace of Versailles is a visual history of French architecture from the 1630s to the 1780s. Its earliest portion, the \"corps de logis\", was built for Louis XIII in the style of his reign with brick, marble, and slate, which Le Vau surrounded in the 1660s with \"Enveloppe\", an edifice that was inspired by Renaissance-era Italian villas. When Jules Hardouin-Mansart made further expansions to the palace in the 1680s, he used the \"Enveloppe\" as the model for his work. Neoclassical additions were made to the palace with the remodelling of the Ministers' Wings in the 1770s, by Ange-Jacques Gabriel, and after the Bourbon Restoration.\nThe palace was largely completed by the death of Louis XIV in 1715. The eastern facing palace has a U-shaped layout, with the corps de logis and symmetrical advancing secondary wings terminating with the Dufour Pavilion on the south and the Gabriel Pavilion to the north, creating an expansive cour d'honneur known as the Royal Court (Cour Royale). Flanking the Royal Court are two enormous asymmetrical wings that result in a fa\u00e7ade of in length. Covered by around of roof, the palace has 2,143 windows, 1,252 chimneys, and 67 staircases.\nThe palace and its grounds have had a great influence on architecture and horticulture from the mid-17th century to the end of the 18th century. Examples of works influenced by Versailles include Christopher Wren's work at Hampton Court Palace, Berlin Palace, the Palace of La Granja, Stockholm Palace, Ludwigsburg Palace, Karlsruhe Palace, Rastatt Palace, Nymphenburg Palace, Schleissheim Palace, and Esterh\u00e1zy Palace.\nRoyal Apartments.\nThe construction in 1668\u20131671 of Louis Le Vau's \"enveloppe\" around the outside of Louis XIII's red brick and white stone ch\u00e2teau added state apartments for the king and the queen. The addition was known at the time as the \"ch\u00e2teau neuf\" (new ch\u00e2teau). The \"grands appartements\" (Grand Apartments, also referred to as the State Apartments) include the \"grand appartement du roi\" and the \"grand appartement de la reine\". They occupied the main or principal floor of the \"ch\u00e2teau neuf\", with three rooms in each apartment facing the garden to the west and four facing the garden parterres to the north and south, respectively. The private apartments of the king (the \"appartement du roi\" and the \"petit appartement du roi\") and those of the queen (the \"petit appartement de la reine\") remained in the \"ch\u00e2teau vieux\" (old ch\u00e2teau). Le Vau's design for the state apartments closely followed Italian models of the day, including the placement of the apartments on the main floor (the \"piano nobile\", the next floor up from the ground level), a convention the architect borrowed from Italian palace design.\nThe king's State Apartment consisted of an enfilade of seven rooms, each dedicated to one of the known planets and their associated titular Roman deity. The queen's apartment formed a parallel enfilade with that of the \"grand appartement du roi\". After the addition of the Hall of Mirrors (1678\u20131684) the king's apartment was reduced to five rooms (until the reign of Louis XV, when two more rooms were added) and the queen's to four.\nThe queen's apartments served as the residence of three queens of France \u2013 Maria Theresa of Spain, wife of Louis XIV, Maria Leszczy\u0144ska, wife of Louis XV, and Marie Antoinette, wife of Louis XVI. Additionally, Louis XIV's granddaughter-in-law, Princess Marie-Ad\u00e9la\u00efde of Savoy, duchess of Burgundy, wife of Louis, Duke of Burgundy, occupied these rooms from 1697 (the year of her marriage) to her death in 1712.\nAmbassador's Staircase.\nThe Ambassadors' Staircase (\"Escalier des Ambassadeurs\") was an imperial staircase built from 1674 to 1680 by Fran\u00e7ois d'Orbay. Until Louis XV had it demolished in 1752 to create a courtyard for his private apartments, the staircase was the primary entrance into the Palace of Versailles and the royal apartments especially. It was entered from the courtyard via a vestibule that, cramped and dark, contrasted greatly with the tall, open space of the staircase \u2013 famously lit naturally with a skylight \u2013 so as to overawe visitors.\nThe staircase and walls of the room that contained it were clad in polychrome marble and gilded bronze, with decor in the Ionic order. Charles Le Brun painted the walls and ceiling of the room according to a festive theme to celebrate Louis XIV's victory in the Franco-Dutch War. On the wall immediately above the staircase were \"trompe-l'\u0153il\" paintings of people from the Four Parts of the World looking into the staircase over a balustrade, a motif repeated on the ceiling fresco. There they were joined by allegorical figures for the twelve months of the year and various Classical Greek figures such as the Muses. A marble bust of Louis XIV, sculpted by Jean Warin in 1665\u201366, was placed in a niche above the first landing of the staircase.\nThe State Apartments of the King.\nThe construction of the Hall of Mirrors between 1678 and 1686 coincided with a major alteration to the State Apartments. They were originally intended as his residence, but the King transformed them into galleries for his finest paintings, and venues for his many receptions for courtiers. During the season from All-Saints Day in November until Easter, these were usually held three times a week, from six to ten in the evening, with various entertainments.\nThe Salon of Hercules.\nThis was originally a chapel. It was rebuilt beginning in 1712 under the supervision of the First Architect to the King, Robert de Cotte, to showcase two paintings by Paolo Veronese, \"Eleazar and Rebecca\" and \"Meal at the House of Simon the Pharisee\", which was a gift to Louis XIV from the Republic of Venice in 1664. The painting on the ceiling, \"The Apotheosis of Hercules\", by Fran\u00e7ois Lemoyne, was completed in 1736, and gave the room its name.\nThe Salon of Abundance.\nThe Salon of Abundance was the antechamber to the Cabinet of Curios (now the Games Room), which displayed Louis XIV's collection of precious jewels and rare objects. Some of the objects in the collection are depicted in Ren\u00e9-Antoine Houasse's painting \"Abundance and Liberality\" (1683), located on the ceiling over the door opposite the windows.\nThe Salon of Venus.\nThis salon was used for serving light meals during evening receptions. The principal feature in this room is Jean Warin's life-size statue of Louis XIV in the costume of a Roman emperor. On the ceiling in a gilded oval frame is another painting by Houasse, \"Venus subjugating the Gods and Powers\" (1672\u20131681). \"Trompe-l'\u0153il\" paintings and sculpture around the ceiling illustrate mythological themes.\nThe Salon of Mercury.\nThe Salon of Mercury was the original State Bedchamber when Louis XIV officially moved the court and government to the palace in 1682. The bed is a replica of the original commissioned by King Louis-Philippe in the 19th century when he turned the palace into a museum. The ceiling paintings by the Flemish artist Jean Baptiste de Champaigne depict the god Mercury in his chariot, drawn by a rooster, and Alexander the Great and Ptolemy surrounded by scholars and philosophers. The Automaton Clock was made for the King by the royal clockmaker Antoine Morand in 1706. When it chimes the hour, figures of Louis XIV and Fame descend from a cloud.\nThe Salon of Mars.\nThe Salon of Mars was used by the royal guards until 1782, and was decorated on a military theme with helmets and trophies. It was turned into a concert room between 1684 and 1750, with galleries for musicians on either side. Portraits of Louis XV and his Queen, Marie Leszczy\u0144ska, by the Flemish artist Carle Van Loo decorate the room today.\nThe Salon of Apollo.\nThe Salon of Apollo was the royal throne room under Louis XIV, and was the setting for formal audiences. The eight-foot-high silver throne was melted down in 1689 to help pay the costs of an expensive war, and was replaced by a more modest throne of gilded wood. The central painting on the ceiling, by Charles de la Fosse, depicts the Sun Chariot of Apollo, the King's favourite emblem, pulled by four horses and surrounded by the four seasons.\nThe Salon of Diana.\nThe Salon of Diana was used by Louis XIV as a billiards room, and had galleries from which courtiers could watch him play. The decoration of the walls and ceiling depicts scenes from the life of the goddess Diana. The celebrated bust of Louis XIV by Bernini made during the famous sculptor's visit to France in 1665 is on display here.\nPrivate apartments of the King and Queen.\nPrivate apartments of the King.\nThe apartments of the King were the heart of the ch\u00e2teau; they were in the same location as the rooms of Louis XIII, the creator of the ch\u00e2teau, on the first floor (second floor US style). They were set aside for the personal use of Louis XIV in 1683. He and his successors Louis XV and Louis XVI used these rooms for official functions, such as the ceremonial \"lever\" (\"waking up\") and the \"coucher\" (\"going to bed\") of the monarch, which was attended by a crowd of courtiers.\nThe King's apartment was accessed from the Hall of Mirrors from the \"Oeil de Boeuf\" antechamber or from the Guardroom and the \"Grand Couvert\", the ceremonial room where Louis XIV often took his evening meals, seated alone at a table in front of the fireplace. His spoon, fork, and knife were brought to him in a golden box. The courtiers could watch as he dined.\nThe King's bedchamber had originally been a Drawing Room before Louis XIV transformed it into his own bedroom in 1701. He died there on 1 September 1715. Both Louis XV and Louis XVI continued to use the bedroom for their official awakening and going to bed. On 6 October 1789, from the balcony of this room Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette, joined by the Marquis de Lafayette, looked down on the hostile crowd in the courtyard, shortly before the King was forced to return to Paris.\nThe bed of the King is placed beneath a carved relief by Nicolas Coustou entitled \" France watching over the sleeping King\". The decoration includes several paintings set into the panelling, including a self-portrait of Antony van Dyck.\nPrivate apartments of The Queen.\nThe \"petit appartement de la reine\" is a suite of rooms that were reserved for the personal use of the queen. Originally arranged for the use of the Maria Theresa of Spain, consort of Louis XIV, the rooms were later modified for use by Marie Leszczy\u0144ska and finally for Marie Antoinette. The Queen's apartments and the King's Apartments were laid out on the same design, each suite having seven rooms. Both suites had ceilings painted with scenes from mythology; the King's ceilings featured male figures, the Queen's featured females.\nHall of Mirrors.\nThe Hall of Mirrors is a long gallery at the westernmost part of the palace that looks out onto the gardens. The hall was built from 1678 to 1681 on the site of a terrace Le Vau built between the king and queen's suites. The hall is clad in marble and decorated in a modified version of the Corinthian order, with 578 mirrors facing 17 windows and reflecting the light provided by them. The ceiling fresco, painted by Le Brun over the next four years, embellishes the first 18 years of Louis XIV's reign in 30 scenes, 17 of which are military victories over the Dutch. The fresco depicts Louis XIV himself alongside Classical figures in the scenes celebrating moments in his reign such as the beginning of personal rule in 1661, breaking from earlier frescoes at Versailles that used allegories derived from Classical and mythological scenes.\nThe Salon of War and the Salon of Peace bookend the Hall of Mirrors on its northern and southern ends respectively. The Salon of War, constructed and decorated from 1678 to 1686, celebrates French victories in the Franco-Dutch War with marble panels, gilded bronze trophies of arms, and a stucco \"bas-relief\" of Louis XIV on horseback riding over his enemies. The Salon of Peace is decorated in the same fashion but according to its eponymous theme.\nRoyal Chapel.\nThe Royal Chapel of Versailles is located at the southern end of the north wing. The building stands high, and measures long and wide. The chapel is rectangular with a semicircular apse, combining traditional, Gothic royal French church architecture with the French Baroque style of Versailles. The ceiling of the chapel is constituted by an unbroken vault, divided into three frescos by Antoine Coypel, Charles de La Fosse, and Jean Jouvenet. The palette of motifs beneath the frescoes glorify the deeds of Louis IX, and include images of David, Constantine, Charlemagne, and Louis IX, \"fleur de lis\", and Louis XIV's monogram. The organ of the chapel was built by Robert Clicquot and Julien Tribuot in 1709\u20131710.\nLouis XIV commissioned the chapel, its sixth, from Hardouin-Mansart and Le Brun in 1683\u201384. It was the last building constructed at Versailles during Louis XIV's reign. Construction was delayed until 1699, however, and it was not completed until 1710. The only major modification to the chapel since its completion was the removal of a lantern from its roof in 1765. A full restoration of the chapel began in late 2017 and lasted into early 2021.\nRoyal Opera.\nThe Royal Opera of Versailles was originally commissioned by Louis XIV in 1682 and was to be built at the end of the North Wing with a design by Hardouin-Mansart and Carlo Vigarani. However, due to the expense of the King's continental wars, the project was put aside. The idea was revived by Louis XV with a new design by Ange-Jacques Gabriel in 1748, but this was also temporarily put aside. The project was revived and rushed ahead for the planned celebration of the marriage of the Dauphin, the future Louis XVI, and Marie Antoinette. For economy and speed, the new opera was built almost entirely of wood, which also gave it very high quality acoustics. The wood was painted to resemble marble, and the ceiling was decorated with a painting of the Apollo, the god of the arts, preparing crowns for illustrious artists, by Louis Jean-Jacques Durameau. The sculptor Augustin Pajou added statuary and reliefs to complete the decoration. The new Opera was inaugurated on 16 May 1770, as part of the celebration of the royal wedding.\nIn October 1789, early in the French Revolution, the last banquet for the royal guardsmen was hosted by the King in the opera, before he departed for Paris. Following the Franco-German War in 1871 and then the Paris Commune until 1875, the French National Assembly met in the opera, until the proclamation of the French Third Republic and the return of the government to Paris.\nMuseum of the History of France.\nShortly after becoming king in 1830, Louis Philippe I decided to transform the palace into a museum devoted to \"All the Glories of France,\" with paintings and sculpture depicting famous French victories and heroes. Most of the apartments of the palace were entirely demolished (in the main building, practically all of the apartments were annihilated, with only the apartments of the king and queen remaining almost intact), and turned into a series of several large rooms and galleries: the Coronation Room (whose original volume was left untouched by Louis-Philippe), which displays the celebrated painting of the coronation of Napoleon I by Jacques-Louis David; the Hall of Battles; commemorating French victories with large-scale paintings; and the 1830 room, which celebrated Louis-Philippe's own coming to power in the French Revolution of 1830. Some paintings were brought from the Louvre, including works depicting events in French history by Philippe de Champaigne, Pierre Mignard, Laurent de La Hyre, Charles Le Brun, Adam Frans van der Meulen, Nicolas de Largilli\u00e8re, Hyacinthe Rigaud, Jean-Antoine Houdon, Jean-Marc Nattier, \u00c9lisabeth Vig\u00e9e Le Brun, Hubert Robert, Thomas Lawrence, Jacques-Louis David, and Antoine-Jean Gros. Others were commissioned especially for the museum by prominent artists of the early 19th century, including Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix, who painted Saint Louis at the French victory over the British in the Battle of Taillebourg in 1242. Other painters featured include Horace Vernet and Fran\u00e7ois G\u00e9rard. A monumental painting by Vernet features Louis Philippe himself, with his sons, posing in front of the gates of the palace.\nThe overthrow of Louis Philippe in 1848 put an end to his grand plans for the museum, but the Gallery of Battles is still as it was, and is passed through by many visitors to the royal apartments and grand salons. Another set of rooms on the first floor has been made into galleries on Louis XIV and his court, displaying furniture, paintings, and sculptures. In recent years, eleven rooms on the ground floor between the Chapel and the Opera have been turned into a history of the palace, with audiovisual displays and models.\nEstate of Versailles.\nThe estate of Versailles consists of the palace, the subsidiary buildings around it, and its park and gardens. As of June 2021, the estate altogether covers an area of , with the park and gardens laid out to the south, west, and north of the palace. The palace is approached from the east by the Avenue de Paris, measuring from Paris to a gate between the Grande and Petite \u00c9curies. Beyond these stables is the Place d'Armes, where the Avenue de Paris meets the Avenue de Sceaux and Avenue de Saint-Cloud (see map), the three roads that formed the main arteries of the city of Versailles. Exactly where the three roads meet is a gate leading into the \"cour d'honneur\", hemmed in by the Ministers' Wings. Beyond is the Royal Gate and the main palace, which wraps around the Royal and finally Marble Courts.\nThe estate was established by Louis XIII as a hunting retreat, with a park just to the west of his ch\u00e2teau. From 1661, Louis XIV expanded the estate until, at its greatest extent, the estate was made up by the Grand Parc, a hunting ground of , and the gardens, called the Petit Parc, which covered . A , wall with 24 gateways enclosed the estate.\nThe landscape of the estate had to be created from the bog that surrounded Louis XIII's ch\u00e2teau using landscape architecture usually employed in fortress building. The approach to the palace and the gardens were carefully laid out via the moving of earth and construction of terraces. The water from the marsh was marshalled into a series of lakes and ponds around Versailles, but these reservoirs were not sufficient for the palace, city, or gardens. Great lengths were taken to supply Versailles with water, such as the damming of the river Bi\u00e8vre to create an inflow in the 1660s, the construction of an enormous pumping station at the river Seine near Marly-le-Roi in 1681, and an attempt to divert water from the river Eure with a canal in the later 1680s.\nGardens.\nThe gardens of Versailles, as they have existed since the reign of Louis XIV, are the work of Andr\u00e9 Le N\u00f4tre. Le N\u00f4tre's gardens were preceded by a simple garden laid out in the 1630s by landscape architects Jacques Boyceau and Jacques de Nemours, which he rearranged along an east\u2013west axis that, because of Louis XIV's land purchases and the clearing of woodland, were expanded literally as far as could be seen. The resulting gardens were a collaboration between Le N\u00f4tre, Le Brun, Colbert, and Louis XIV, marked by rigid order, discipline, and open space, with axial paths, flowerbeds, hedges, and ponds and lakes as motifs. They became the epitome of the French formal garden style, and have been very influential and widely imitated or reproduced.\nSubsidiary structures.\nThe first of the subsidiary structures of the Palace of Versailles was the Versailles Menagerie, built by Le Vau between the years 1662 and 1664, at the southern end of the Grand Canal. The apartments, overlooking the pens, were renovated by Hardouin-Mansart from 1698 to 1700, but the Menagerie fell into disuse in 1712. After a long period of decay, it was demolished in 1801. The Versailles Orangery, just to the south of the palace, was first built by Le Vau in 1663, originally as part of the general moving of earth to create the Estate. It was also modified by Mansart, who, from 1681 to 1685, totally rebuilt it and doubled its size.\nIn late 1679, Louis XIV commissioned Mansart to build the Ch\u00e2teau de Marly, a retreat at the edge of Versailles's estate, about from the palace. The ch\u00e2teau consisted of a primary residential building and twelve pavilions, in Palladian style placed in two rows on either side of the main building. Construction was completed in 1686, when Louis XIV spent his first night there. The ch\u00e2teau was nationalized and sold in 1799, and subsequently demolished and replaced with industrial buildings. These were themselves demolished in 1805, and then in 1811 the estate was purchased by Napoleon. On 1 June 2009, the grounds of the Ch\u00e2teau de Marly were ceded to the Public Establishment of the Palace, Museum and National Estate of Versailles.\nLa Lanterne, is a hunting lodge named after the lantern that topped the nearby Menagerie that was built in 1787 by Philippe Louis de Noailles, then the palace governor. It has since 1960 been a state residence.\nThe Grand Trianon.\nIn 1668, Louis XIV purchased and demolished the hamlet of Trianon, near the northern tip of the Grand Canal, and in its place, he commissioned Le Vau to construct a retreat from court, remembered as the Porcelain Trianon. Designed and built by Le Vau in 1670, it was the first example of \"Chinoiserie\" (faux Chinese) architecture in Europe, though it was largely designed in French style. The roof was clad not with porcelain but with delftware, and was thus prone to leaks, so in 1687 Louis XIV ordered it demolished. Nevertheless, the Porcelain Trianon was itself influential and copycats were built across Europe.\nTo replace the Porcelain Trianon, Louis XIV tasked Hardouin-Mansart with the construction in 1687 of the Grand Trianon, built from marble in three months. The Grand Trianon has a single story, except for its attached service wing, which was modified by Hardouin-Mansart in 1705\u201306. The east fa\u00e7ade has a courtyard while the west faces the gardens of the Grand Trianon, and between them a peristyle. The interiors are mostly original, and housed Louis XIV, the Madame de Maintenon, Marie Leszczy\u0144ska, and Napoleon, who ordered restorations to the building. Under Charles de Gaulle, the north wing of the Grand Trianon became a residence of the President of France.\nPetit Trianon.\nThe Petit Trianon, whose construction from 1762 to 1768 led to the advent of the names \"Grand\" and \"Petit Trianon\", was constructed for Louis XV and the Madame du Barry in the Neoclassical style by Gabriel. The building has a \"piano nobile\", basement, and attic, with five windows on each floor. On becoming king, Louis XVI gave the Petit Trianon to Marie Antoinette, who remodeled it, relaid its gardens in the then-current English and Oriental styles, and formed her own court there.\nThe Queen's hamlet and Theatre.\nNear the Trianons are the French pavilion, built by Gabriel in 1750 between the two residences, and the Queen's Theatre and Queen's Hamlet, built by architect Richard Mique in 1780 and from 1783 to 1785 respectively. These were both built at the behest of Marie Antoinette; the theatre, hidden in the gardens, indulged her appreciation of opera and is absolutely original, and the hamlet to extend her gardens with rustic amenities. The building scheme of the Queen's Hamlet includes a farmhouse (the farm was to produce milk and eggs for the queen), a dairy, a dovecote, a boudoir, a barn that burned down during the French Revolution, a mill and a tower in the form of a lighthouse.\nModern political and ceremonial functions.\nThe palace still serves political functions. Heads of state are regaled in the Hall of Mirrors; the bicameral French Parliament\u2014consisting of the Senate (\"S\u00e9nat\") and the National Assembly (\"Assembl\u00e9e nationale\")\u2014meet in joint session (a congress of the French Parliament) in Versailles to revise or otherwise amend the French Constitution, a tradition that came into effect with the promulgation of the 1875 Constitution. For example, the Parliament met in joint session at Versailles to pass constitutional amendments in June 1999 (for domestic applicability of International Criminal Court decisions and for gender equality in candidate lists), in January 2000 (ratifying the Treaty of Amsterdam), in March 2003 (specifying the \"decentralized organization\" of the French Republic), and in March 2024 (to enshrine the freedom of women to have recourse to abortion).\nIn 2009, President Nicolas Sarkozy addressed the Great Recession before a congress in Versailles, the first time that this had been done since 1848, when Louis Napoleon Bonaparte gave an address before the French Second Republic. Following the November 2015 Paris attacks, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande gave a speech before a rare joint session of parliament at the Palace of Versailles. This was the third time since 1848 that a French president addressed a joint session of the French Parliament at Versailles. The president of the National Assembly has an official apartment at the Palace of Versailles. In 2023 a state visit by Charles III to France included a state banquet at the Palace.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWeb sources.\nFrench Ministry of Culture.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The fruit is notable for its exceptional richness in vitamin C and versatility in various food preparations. \nNames.\nCommon names include acerola (from \"azarole\" for a similar looking old-world fruit), Guarani cherry, Barbados cherry, West Indian cherry, wild crepe myrtle, cereza, and cerise.\nDistribution.\n\"Malpighia emarginata\" is originally native to the Lesser Antilles islands of the southern Caribbean Sea, extending into South America as far south as Brazil. It has been introduced and even naturalized elsewhere in the neotropics, such as in Peru, Venezuela, and Ecuador, as well as the southernmost parts of the contiguous United States (southern Florida and the Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas). In Florida, it can be grown in protected locations as far north as Cape Canaveral. It is cultivated in the tropics and subtropics throughout the world from southern Europe to parts of Africa, India, and Australia.\nProduction.\nBrazil.\nBrazil is the largest producer of acerola worldwide. On , Brazil produces of acerola per year. In order to preserve the genetic variability of acerola, the federal rural University of Pernambuco in Brazil established an \"Acerola Active Germplasm Bank\" in June 1998.\nGrowth conditions.\nAcerola can be propagated by seed, cutting, or other methods. It prefers dry, well-drained, sandy soil and full sun, and cannot endure temperatures lower than . Because of its shallow roots, it has very low tolerance to winds. Furthermore, a sufficient water supply is advantageous for good growth and maximum yields of large fruits. This is especially important during fruiting and flowering. The optimal growth conditions are reached at a mean temperature of and of rainfall annually.\nDescription.\nAcerola is an evergreen shrub or small tree with spreading branches on a short trunk. It is usually tall, but sometimes reaches in height. The chromosome number is 2\"n\" = 40.\nBark.\nThe bark of young branches is green and sparsely covered with curly-haired trichomes, which fall off with age. The greyish to brownish bark is relatively smooth and covered with conspicuous cork pores when young. With age, it is thick and cracked.\nLeaves.\nThe leaves are simple, ovate to elliptic-lanceolate in outline, long, wide, with an entire or undulating margin. They are attached oppositely on the stem on short petioles. These leaves and petioles can irritate skin due to minute stinging hairs.\nFlowers.\nThe tree flowers from April to November. Flowers are bisexual and in diameter. They have five pale to deep pink or red fringed petals, 10 stamens, and six to 10 glands on the calyx. The three to five flowers per inflorescence are sessile or short-peduncled axillary cymes.\nFruits and seeds.\nThree years after planting, trees start producing fruits. 3\u20134 weeks after flowering, a number of bright red drupes in diameter with a mass of mature. The shell of the fruit is smooth and very thin. Its shelf life of 2\u20133 days at ambient temperature makes it highly perishable. Drupes are in pairs or groups of three, and each contains three triangular seeds. The drupes are juicy and high in vitamin C () and other nutrients. They are divided into three obscure lobes and are usually acidic to subacidic, giving them a sour taste, but may be sweet if grown well.\nCultivation methods.\nYield and harvest.\nAcerola flowers and fruits already in the first year after planting but increases its production in the following years, reaching up to per plant in the sixth year. The fruiting season usually extends from April to November. The fruits should be picked frequently, as they are not stored on the tree. Ripe fruit should be handled carefully to avoid bruising and should be utilized as soon as possible or frozen for later use. Semi-ripe fruit will usually keep for several days in the refrigerator. Pollination by wild insects increases the fruit yield.\nSowing.\nPlants can be set at any time of the year, but the best time is spring, just before the rainy season. Choose a location with good water drainage and in a sheltered spot.\nPests and diseases.\nMalpighia emarginata is a host plant for the caterpillars of the white-patched skipper (\"Chiomara asychis\"), Florida duskywing (\"Ephyriades brunneus\"), and brown-banded skipper (\"Timochares ruptifasciatus\"). Larvae of the acerola weevil (\"Anthonomus macromalus\") feed on the fruits, while adults consume young leaves.\nNutritional value.\nAcerola fruit is 91% water, and 8% carbohydrates, and contains negligible protein and fat (table). In a reference amount of , acerola supplies 32 calories, and is a rich source particularly of vitamin C at some 20 times the Daily Value (DV), with manganese at 26% DV, and other micronutrients at uniformly low levels (table). \nWhereas the content of sugar, soluble solids and titratable acids increases with the ripening process of the fruit, the vitamin C content decreases. Therefore, the immature green fruit is harvested for industrial use of the vitamin C.\nUses.\nCulinary.\nAcerola cherry may be eaten raw or used as a juice or mixed with other, usually sweeter fruit juices. The fruits are used in jams, concentrates, stews, and liqueurs, possibly needing sugar to improve flavor. Cooked fruits are strained to remove the seeds, and the resulting sauce has uses on cake, pudding or ice cream.\nAcerola cherry powder is also used in some commercially produced breads as a bread improver. Because acerola also contains pigments like anthocyanins and carotenoids, it could also be used as a food colorant.\nOthers.\nAcerola is a bonsai subject because of its small leaf and fruit, and fine ramification. It is also grown as an ornamental and for hedges.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The road has become a metonym for that industry; nearly every top Silicon Valley company has been the beneficiary of early funding from firms on Sand Hill Road.\nIts significance as a symbol of private equity and venture capitalism in the United States has been compared to that of Wall Street and the stock market.\nLocation.\nConnecting El Camino Real and Interstate 280, the road provides easy access to Stanford University and the northwestern area of Silicon Valley. The road also runs southwest of Interstate 280 into a residential neighborhood of Woodside, California, but the private equity companies are concentrated to the east of the freeway on the main stretch of the road in Menlo Park. On its northeast end, it crosses into and runs briefly through Palo Alto before ending at El Camino Real.\nSand Hill Road is also home to SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory.\nHistory.\nFor many years, Sand Hill Road's northern end terminated in the middle of Stanford Shopping Center's parking lot, and the only four-lane segment was the section from Interstate 280 to Santa Cruz Avenue (the section where all the venture capitalists are housed). This situation resulted in two severe bottlenecks which made it difficult to travel to and from Stanford Shopping Center, Stanford University, and Menlo Park. \nExtension and widening of the road were fiercely opposed by environmentalists, who were concerned about the road's proximity to San Francisquito Creek, and by residents of Menlo Park, who feared that completion of the road would increase traffic congestion in their area due to the mid-Peninsula region's lack of a direct north\u2013south arterial. After three decades of lobbying, negotiation, and litigation, the road was finally completed to El Camino Real in 2001. Only the existing portion from just \"north\" of Alameda de las Pulgas to just \"south\" of Stanford Shopping Center was widened to four lanes; the new extension past the shopping center was built only as two lanes. \nThe bottleneck near Santa Cruz Avenue was widened in 2006 and features a high faux rock wall at the junction of Sand Hill Road and Santa Cruz Avenue. The project was delayed because the stretch of land at issue runs through Menlo Park, not Palo Alto; the city reversed its opposition to widening only after seeing the results of the widening of the northern Palo Alto segment.\nVenture capital.\nIn 1972, the firm now known as Kleiner Perkins was the first venture capital firm to open an office on Sand Hill Road. The stellar performance of Kleiner Perkins's first $8 million fund quickly attracted other similar firms to the Menlo Park area, resulting in \"the most important cluster of venture capital firms in the world\", an author later wrote. Despite this, in the mid-1970s, Kleiner Perkins began to shift operations to Downtown San Francisco, but years later moved back most of its operations to rejoin the many other venture capital firms that had put down roots around its original office location. Since then, beneficiaries of funding from Sand Hill Road have included Microsoft, Amazon.com, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Skype.\nWhen Microsoft's Silicon Valley office moved to Sand Hill Road in 1988 it paid US$2.02 per square foot, less than the US$3 average for Palo Alto and Menlo Park. Robert Gaskins wrote, \"There could not be a better location for accessibility coupled with privacy and natural beauty\", and \"appropriate for a top-tier company like Microsoft\". For several years during the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, commercial real estate on Sand Hill Road was more expensive than almost anywhere else in the world. The annual rent in the area around Sand Hill Road peaked at around US$144 per square foot ($1550 per m2) in mid-2000; at the time, this was higher than rates in Manhattan and London's West End.\nIn 1997, the Harvard Business School opened the California Research Center at 3000 Sand Hill Road, whose aim is to enable HBS faculty to write business cases about Silicon Valley.\nAs of December 2014, Sand Hill Road still had the most expensive office space in the United States with annual rent reported at $111 per square foot, which was higher than Manhattan's Fifth Avenue at $102 per square foot.\nAs of June 2022, Sand Hill Road was still home to the most expensive office space in the United States, with Newmark Group reporting monthly rent at $10.66 per square foot (equivalent to annual rent of $127.92 per square foot), which was reportedly higher than other top-tier markets like Manhattan's Park Avenue and Greenwich, Connecticut. However, prices were under pressure from the shift to remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic, which had reduced the necessity of maintaining a physical headquarters on Sand Hill Road. Other issues included the dated appearance of Sand Hill Road's of \"low-rise woody walk-ups, most of them built in the 1970s and \u201980s\", and their distance from the restaurants and stores of downtown Menlo Park and its Caltrain station. After vacancies on Sand Hill Road peaked at around 15 percent at the end of 2020, landlords responded to these issues by renovating buildings and adding amenities like farm-to-table restaurants to justify their demands for high rent.\nVenture Capital and Private Equity Firms.\nVenture capital and private equity firms located on Sand Hill Road include:\nIn popular culture.\nThe season two premiere episode of the HBO television series \"Silicon Valley\", in which the show's protagonists try to secure venture capital for their startup, was titled \"Sand Hill Shuffle\".\nIn the second episode of HBO miniseries \"The Dropout\", Elizabeth Holmes visits several venture capital firms on Sand Hill Road in the hopes of securing investment for Theranos.\nIn the 2010 film \"\", protagonist Rod visits a VC firm on Sand Hill Road to get financing for his solar energy startup.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is considered to be the father of landscape architecture in the United States. Olmsted was famous for co-designing many well-known urban parks with his partner Calvert Vaux, beginning with Central Park in New York City, which led to numerous other urban park designs including Prospect Park in Brooklyn, Cadwalader Park in Trenton, New Jersey, and Forest Park in Portland, Oregon.\nOlmsted's projects encompassed comprehensive park systems, planned communities, and institutional campuses across North America. His major works included the country's first coordinated system of public parks and parkways in Buffalo, New York, the Emerald Necklace in Boston, Massachusetts, the Grand Necklace of Parks in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and parks for the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. He designed one of the first planned communities in the United States, Riverside, Illinois, and created master plans for universities including University of California, Berkeley, Stanford University, and the University of Chicago. Notable individual projects included the Biltmore Estate in Asheville, North Carolina, Mount Royal Park in Montreal, Quebec, and landscape work for the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C.\nIn 1883, Olmsted established his landscape architecture and planning consultancy at Fairsted in Brookline, Massachusetts. The firm was carried on and expanded by his sons, Frederick Jr. and John C., under the name Olmsted Brothers. Beyond design work, Olmsted was an early leader in the conservation movement, contributing to the preservation of Niagara Falls, the Adirondack region, and the National Park system. During the Civil War, he served as head of the U.S. Sanitary Commission, organizing medical services for the Union Army. The quality of his work was widely recognized by contemporaries; Daniel Burnham said of him, \"He paints with lakes and wooded slopes; with lawns and banks and forest-covered hills; with mountainsides and ocean views...\" His work set a standard of excellence that continues to influence landscape architecture in the United States.\nEarly life and education.\nOlmsted was born in Hartford, Connecticut, on April 26, 1822. His father, John Olmsted, was a prosperous merchant who took a lively interest in nature, people, and places; Frederick Law and his younger brother, John Hull Olmsted, also showed this interest. His mother, Charlotte Law (n\u00e9e Hull) Olmsted, died from an overdose before his fourth birthday in 1826. His father remarried in 1827 to Mary Ann Bull, who shared her husband's strong love of nature and had perhaps a more cultivated taste. Their children were Charlotte, Mary, Owen, Bertha, Ada, and Albert Olmsted. The Olmsted ancestors arrived in the early 1600s from Essex, England.\nOlmsted began attending Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, in 1837 to study surveying with Frederick Barton, leaving when Barton left in 1838. When he was almost ready to enter Yale College at a young age, sumac poisoning weakened his eyes, so he abandoned college plans. After working as an apprentice seaman, merchant, and journalist, he settled on a farm in January 1848 on the south shore of Staten Island. His father helped him acquire this farm, and he renamed it from Akerly Homestead to Tosomock Farm. It was later renamed \"The Woods of Arden\" by owner Erastus Wiman. The house in which Olmsted lived still stands at 4515 Hylan Boulevard, near Woods of Arden Road.\nCareer.\nJournalism.\nOlmsted had a significant career in journalism. In 1850 he traveled to England to visit public gardens, where he was greatly impressed by Joseph Paxton's Birkenhead Park. He subsequently wrote and published \"Walks and Talks of an American Farmer in England\" in 1852. This supported his getting additional work. His visit to Birkenhead Park inspired his later contribution to the design of Central Park in New York City.\nInterested in the slave economy, he was commissioned by the \"New York Daily Times\" (now \"The New York Times\") to embark on an extensive research journey through the American South and Texas from 1852 to 1857. His dispatches to the \"Times\" were collected into three volumes: \"A Journey in the Seaboard Slave States\" (1856), \"A Journey Through Texas\" (1857), \"A Journey in the Back Country\" (1860). The critic Charles Eliot Norton described the books as \"the most important contribution to an exact acquaintance with the conditions and result of slavery in this country that have ever been published.\"\nThese are considered vivid first-person accounts of the antebellum South. A one-volume abridgment, \"Journeys and Explorations in the Cotton Kingdom\" (1861), was published in England during the first six months of the American Civil War, at the suggestion of Olmsted's English publisher.\nTo this, he wrote a new introduction (on \"The Present Crisis\"). He stated his views on the effect of slavery on the economy and social conditions of the southern states:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;My own observation of the real condition of the people of our Slave States, gave me ... an impression that the cotton monopoly in some way did them more harm than good; and although the written narration of what I saw was not intended to set this forth, upon reviewing it for the present publication, I find the impression has become a conviction.\nHe argued that slavery had made the slave states inefficient (a set amount of work took 4 times as long in Virginia as in the North) and backward both economically and socially. He said that the profits of slavery were enjoyed by no more than 8,000 owners of large plantations; a somewhat larger group had about the standard of living of a New York City policeman, but the proportion of the free white men who were as well-off as a Northern working man was small. Slavery meant that 'the proportion of men improving their condition was much less than in any Northern community; and that the natural resources of the land were strangely unused, or were used with poor economy.'\nHe thought that the lack of a Southern white middle class and the general poverty of lower-class whites prevented the development of many civil amenities that were taken for granted in the North.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBetween his travels in Europe and the South, Olmsted served as an editor for \"Putnam's Magazine\" for two years and as an agent with Dix, Edwards and Co., before the company's insolvency during the Panic of 1857. Olmsted provided financial support for, and occasionally wrote for, the magazine \"The Nation\", which was founded in 1865. \"Olmsted spent much of his free time working without pay as an editorial assistant to [the magazine's first editor, Edwin L.] Godkin. It was a labor of love.\"\nNew York City's Central Park.\nAndrew Jackson Downing, the landscape architect from Newburgh, New York, was one of the first to propose developing New York City's Central Park in his role as publisher of \"The Horticulturist\" magazine. A friend and mentor to Olmsted, Downing introduced him to the English-born architect Calvert Vaux, whom Downing had brought to the U.S. as his architectural collaborator. After Downing died in July 1852 in a widely publicized fire on the Hudson River steamboat Henry Clay, Olmsted and Vaux entered the Central Park design competition together, against Egbert Ludovicus Viele among others. Vaux had invited the less experienced Olmsted to participate in the design competition with him, having been impressed with Olmsted's theories and political contacts. Prior to this, in contrast with the more experienced Vaux, Olmsted had never designed or executed a landscape design.\nTheir Greensward Plan was announced in 1858 as the winning design. On his return from the South, Olmsted began executing their plan almost immediately. Olmsted and Vaux continued their informal partnership to design Prospect Park in Brooklyn from 1865 to 1873. That was followed by other projects. Vaux remained in the shadow of Olmsted's grand public personality and social connections.\nThe design of Central Park embodies Olmsted's social consciousness and commitment to egalitarian ideals. Influenced by Downing and his observations regarding social class in England, China, and the American South, Olmsted believed that the common green space must always be equally accessible to all citizens, and was to be defended against private encroachment. This principle is now fundamental to the idea of a \"public park\", but was not assumed as necessary then. Olmsted's tenure as Central Park commissioner was a long struggle to preserve that idea.\nU.S. Sanitary Commission.\nIn 1861, Olmsted took leave as director of Central Park to work in Washington, D.C., as Executive Secretary of the U.S. Sanitary Commission, a precursor to the Red Cross. He tended to the wounded during the American Civil War. In 1862, during Union General George B. McClellan's Peninsula Campaign, he headed the medical effort for the sick and wounded at White House plantation in New Kent County, which had a boat landing on the Pamunkey River.\nHe was one of the six founding members of the Union League Club of New York.\nHe helped to recruit and outfit three African-American regiments of the United States Colored Troops in New York City. He contributed to organizing a Sanitary Fair, which raised one million dollars for the United States Sanitary Commission.\nHe worked for the Sanitary Commission to the point of exhaustion: \"Part of the problem was his need to maintain control over all aspects of the commission's work. He refused to delegate and he had an appetite for authority and power.\" By January 1863, a friend wrote: \"Olmsted is in an unhappy, sick, sore mental state... He works like a dog all day and sits up nearly all night ... works with steady, feverish intensity till four in the morning, sleeps on a sofa in his clothes, and breakfasts on strong coffee and pickles!!!\" His overwork and lack of sleep led to his being in a perpetual state of irritability, which wore on the people with whom he worked: \"Exhausted, ill and having lost the support of the men who put him in charge, Olmsted resigned on Sept. 1, 1863.\" Yet within a month he was on his way to California.\nGold mining project in California.\nIn 1863, Olmsted went west to become the manager of the newly established Rancho Las Mariposas\u2013Mariposa gold mining estate in the Sierra Nevada mountains in California. The estate had been sold by John C. Fremont to New York banker, Morris Ketchum, in January of that same year. The mine was unsuccessful. \"By 1865, the Mariposa Company was bankrupt, Olmsted returned to New York, and the land and mines were sold at a sheriff's sale.\"\nBefore he returned to New York, however, he served on the first board of commissioners for managing the newly established Yosemite Valley and Mariposa Grove land grants.\nU.S. park designer.\nIn 1865, he and Vaux formed Olmsted, Vaux &amp; Co. When Olmsted returned to New York, he and Vaux designed Prospect Park; the planned Chicago suburb of Riverside, Illinois; the park system for Buffalo, New York; Milwaukee's grand necklace of parks; and the Niagara Reservation at Niagara Falls and Belle Isle in Detroit.\nOlmsted conceived of entire systems of parks and interconnecting parkways to connect certain cities to green spaces. Some of the best examples of the scale on which he worked are the park system designed for Buffalo, one of the largest projects; the system he designed for Milwaukee, and the park system designed for Louisville, Kentucky, which was one of only four completed Olmsted-designed park systems in the world.\nOlmsted was a frequent collaborator with architect Henry Hobson Richardson, for whom he devised the landscaping schemes for half a dozen projects, including Richardson's commission for the Buffalo State Asylum. In 1871, Olmsted and Vaux designed the grounds for the Hudson River State Hospital for the Insane in Poughkeepsie.\nIn 1883, Olmsted established what is considered to be the first full-time landscape architecture firm in Brookline, Massachusetts. He called the home and office compound \"Fairsted\". It is now the restored Frederick Law Olmsted National Historic Site. From there Olmsted designed Boston's Emerald Necklace, the campuses of Wellesley College, Smith College, Stanford University and the University of Chicago, as well as the 1893 World's Fair in Chicago, among many other projects.\nOlmsted was one of the planners of the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., which was founded in 1889.\nConservationist.\nOlmsted was an important early leader of the conservation movement in the United States. An expert on California, he was likely one of the gentlemen \"of fortune, of taste and of refinement\" who proposed, through Senator John Conness, that Congress designate Yosemite Valley and Mariposa Big Tree Grove as public reserves. This was the first land set aside by Congress for public use. Olmsted served a one-year appointment on the Board of Commissioner of the state reserve, and his 1865 report to Congress on the board's recommendations laid an ethical framework for the government to reserve public lands, to protect their \"value to posterity\". He described the \"sublime\" and \"stately\" landscape, emphasizing that the value of the landscape was not in any one individual waterfall, cliff, or tree, but in the \"miles of scenery where cliffs of awful height and rocks of vast magnitude and of varied and exquisite coloring, are banked and fringed and draped and shadowed by the tender foliage of noble and lovely trees and bushes, reflected from the most placid pools, and associated with the most tranquil meadows, the most playful streams, and every variety of soft and peaceful pastoral beauty\".\nIn the 1880s, he was active in efforts to conserve the natural wonders of Niagara Falls, threatened with industrialization by the building of electrical power plants. At the same time, he campaigned to preserve the Adirondack region in upstate New York. He was one of the founders of the American Society of Landscape Architects in 1898.\nOlmsted was also known to oppose park projects on conservationist grounds. In 1891, Olmsted refused to develop a plan for Presque Isle Park in Marquette, Michigan, saying that it \"should not be marred by the intrusion of artificial objects\".\nLegacy.\nAfter Olmsted's retirement and death, his sons John Charles Olmsted and Frederick Law Olmsted Jr., continued the work of their firm, doing business as the Olmsted Brothers. The firm lasted until 1980. Many works by the Olmsted sons are mistakenly credited to Frederick Law Olmsted today. For instance, the Olmsted Brothers firm did a park plan for Portland, Maine, in 1905, creating a series of connecting parkways between existing parks and suggesting improvements to those parks. The oldest of these parks, Deering Oaks, had been designed by City Engineer William Goodwin in 1879 but is today frequently described as a Frederick Law Olmsted-designed park.\nA residence hall at the University of Hartford was named in his honor. Olmsted Point, located in Yosemite National Park, was named after Olmsted and his son Frederick.\nThe Olmsted Center located in Queens, NY pays an homage to Frederick Law Olmsted.\nThe Frederick Law Olmsted National Historic Site is located in Brookline, Massachusetts in his former home. Olmsted is known as the \"father of American Landscape Architecture\".\nPersonal life.\nOn June 13, 1859, Olmsted married Mary Cleveland (Perkins) Olmsted, the widow of his brother John, who died in 1857. Daniel Fawcett Tiemann, the mayor of New York, officiated the wedding. Olmsted adopted Mary's three children (his nephews and niece), John Charles Olmsted (born 1852), Charlotte Olmsted (born 1855), and Owen Frederick Olmsted (born 1857).\nFrederick and Mary also had two children together who survived infancy: a daughter, Marion (born October 28, 1861), and a son Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. (born July 24, 1870). Their first child, John Theodore Olmsted, was born on June 13, 1860, and died in infancy.\nIn recognition of his services during the Civil War, Olmsted was elected a Third Class member of the Massachusetts Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States (MOLLUS) on May 2, 1888, and was assigned insignia number 6345. Olmsted's election to MOLLUS is significant in that he was one of the few civilians elected to membership in an organization composed almost exclusively of military officers and their descendants. In 1891 he joined the Connecticut Society of the Sons of the American Revolution by right of his descent from his grandfather Benjamin Olmsted who served in the 4th Connecticut Regiment in 1775.\nIn 1895, senility forced Olmsted to retire. By 1898 he moved to Belmont, Massachusetts, and took up residence as a patient at the McLean Hospital, for whose grounds he had submitted a design which was never executed. He remained there until he died in 1903.\nPrinciples of design.\nDrawing influences from English landscape and gardening, Olmsted emphasized design that encourages the full use of the naturally occurring features of a given space, its \"genius\"; the subordination of individual details to the whole so that decorative elements do not take precedence, but rather the whole space is enhanced; concealment of design, design that does not call attention to itself; design that works on the unconscious to produce relaxation; and utility or purpose over ornamentation. A bridge, a pathway, a tree, a pasture: any and all elements are brought together to produce a particular effect.\nOlmsted designed primarily in pastoral and picturesque styles, each to achieve a particular effect. The pastoral style featured vast expanses of green with small lakes, trees, and groves and produced a soothing, restorative effect on the viewer. The picturesque style covered rocky, broken terrain teeming with shrubs and creepers, to express nature's richness. The picturesque style played with light and shade to lend the landscape a sense of mystery.\nScenery was designed to enhance the sense of space: indistinct boundaries using plants, brush, and trees as opposed to sharp ones; the interplay of light and shadow close up, and blurred detail farther away. He employed a vast expanse of greenery at the end of which would lie a grove of yellow poplar; a path that winds through a bit of landscape and intersects with others, dividing the terrain into triangular islands of successive new views.\nSubordination strove to use all objects and features in the service of the design and its intended effect. It can be seen in the subtle use of naturally occurring plants throughout the park. Non-native species planted for the sake of their own uniqueness was seen as defeating the purpose of design, as that very uniqueness would draw attention to itself where the intention is to enable relaxation: utility above all else was an objective. Separation applied to areas designed in different styles and different uses enhancing safety and reducing distraction. A key feature of Central Park is the use of sunken roadways which traverse the park and are specifically dedicated to vehicles as opposed to the winding pathways designated specifically for pedestrians.\nAn example of this mix of principles is seen in the Central Park Mall, a large promenade leading to the Bethesda Terrace, and the single formal feature in Olmsted and Vaux's original naturalistic design. The designers wrote that a \"'grand promenade' was an 'essential feature of a metropolitan park'\"; however, its formal symmetry, its style, although something of an aberration, was designed to be subordinate to the natural view surrounding it. Wealthy passengers were let from their carriages at its south end. The carriage would then drive around to the Terrace, which overlooked the Lake and Ramble to pick them up, saving them the trouble of needing to double back on foot. The Promenade was lined with slender elms and offered views of Sheep Meadow.\nAffluent New Yorkers, who rarely walked through the park, mixed with the less well-to-do in the Terrace areas, and all enjoyed an escape from the hustle and bustle of the surrounding city. However, the most wealthy among them employed the firm to landscape their country estates in a similar fashion for their private enjoyment, such as that of Frederick T. van Beuren Jr. in New Jersey. He is a descendant of a Dutch physician who settled in Manhattan in 1700 and whose family members became prominent property owners in the city and various other locations. Initially, that country estate was one of several self-sufficient retreats from Manhattan held by the family that included a supporting farm for produce, livestock, and a livery as well as several houses for permanent staff. The estate later became a more permanent residence as van Beuren's career shifted to founding a hospital in the growing community nearby. At that time the shingled structure in New Vernon was renovated into a brick structure that is described as one of the notable mansions of the area. At the time of the renovation, the mature landscape plan for the residence was not altered. A widening of Spring Valley Road during the late twentieth century did eliminate some Olmsted landscaping that included a cascading bank of native ferns lining a roadside stretch of the property that extended along the road from Blackberry Lane to the eponymous van Beuren Road that divided the family property from its northern boundary to its southern boundary at Blue Mill Road.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "53324", "revid": "1305204909", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53324", "title": "Othmar Ammann", "text": "Swiss-American civil engineer (1879\u20131965)\nOthmar Hermann Ammann (March 26, 1879 \u2013 September 22, 1965) was a Swiss-American civil engineer whose bridge designs include the George Washington Bridge, Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, and Bayonne Bridge. He also directed the planning and construction of the Lincoln Tunnel.\nBiography.\nOthmar Ammann was born near Schaffhausen, Switzerland, in 1879. His father was a manufacturer and his mother was a hat maker. He received his engineering education at the Polytechnikum in Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland. He studied with Swiss engineer Wilhelm Ritter. In 1904, he emigrated to the United States, spending much of his career working in New York City. He became a naturalized citizen in 1924.\nIn 1905 he briefly returned to Switzerland to marry Lilly Selma Wehrli. Together they had three children\u00a0\u2013 Werner, George, and Margot\u00a0\u2013 before she died in 1933. He then married Klary Vogt Noetzli, herself recently widowed, in 1935 in California.\nAmmann wrote two reports about bridge collapses, the collapse of the Quebec Bridge and the collapse of the original Tacoma Narrows Bridge (Galloping Gertie). It was the report that he wrote about the failure of the Quebec Bridge in 1907 that first earned him recognition in the field of bridge design engineering. Because of this report, he was able to obtain a position working for Gustav Lindenthal on the Hell Gate Bridge. By 1925, he had been appointed bridge engineer to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. His design for a bridge over the Hudson River was accepted over one developed by his mentor, Lindenthal. (Lindenthal's \"North River Bridge\" designs show an enormous, 16+ lane bridge that would have accommodated pedestrians, freight trains, rapid transit, and automobile traffic. The bridge, which would have entered Manhattan at 57th Street, was rejected in favor of Ammann's designs primarily due to cost reasons.)\nDue to his reputation, he was chosen as one of three engineers tasked with investigating the 1940 collapse of the Tacoma Narrows bridge. Along with Theodore Von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n and Glenn B. Woodruff, he published the 1941 report \"The Failure of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge\", which guided the next half century of suspension bridge design.\nUltimately, this became the George Washington Bridge. Under Ammann's direction, it was completed six months ahead of schedule for less than the original $60 million budget. Ammann's designs for the George Washington Bridge, and, later, the Bayonne Bridge, caught the attention of master builder Robert Moses, who drafted Ammann into his service. The last four of Ammann's six New York City bridges \u2014 Triborough, Bronx-Whitestone, Throgs Neck, and Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge were all built for Moses' Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority. In 1946, Ammann and Charles Whitney founded the firm Ammann &amp; Whitney. In 1964, Ammann opened the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge in New York, that had the world's longest suspended span of , and was the world's heaviest suspension bridge of its time. The Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge is currently the eleventh-longest span in the world and longest in the Western Hemisphere. Ammann also assisted in the building of the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, currently ranked twelfth.\nWorks.\nAmmann was known for being able to create bridges that were light and inexpensive, yet they were still simple and beautiful. He was able to do this by using the deflection theory. He believed that the weight per foot of the span and the cables would provide enough stiffness so that the bridge would not need any stiffening trusses. This made him popular during the depression era when being able to reduce the cost was crucial. Famous bridges by Ammann include the following:\nThe George Washington Bridge was originally designed to have its steel structure clad in dressed stone, omitted from the final design due to cost constraints stemming from the Great Depression. Ammann's managerial skills saw the bridge completed ahead of schedule and under budget.\nThe arched Bayonne Bridge is the only Othmar design that is not a suspension bridge.\nThe Bronx-Whitestone Bridge had to be reinforced after only one year of operation because of perceptible movement during high winds. Warren trusses were initially implemented to stiffen the bridge, spoiling its classic streamlined looks. They have been removed and the wind problem solved using triangular shaped lightweight fiberglass aerodynamic fairing along both sides that slices the wind as it passes over the bridge.\nIn addition to his work on bridges, Ammann also directed the planning and construction of the Lincoln Tunnel.\nLegacy.\nAmmann was the recipient of several awards, including the Thomas Fitch Rowland Prize (1919), the Metropolitan Section Civil Engineer of the Year (1958), the Ernest E. Howard Award (1960) and the National Medal of Science (1964).\nIn 1962, a bronze bust of Ammann was unveiled in the lobby of the George Washington Bridge Bus Station. A residence hall called Ammann College was dedicated in his honor on February 18, 1968 on the campus of Stony Brook University. To mark the hundredth anniversary of his birth, a memorial plaque for Ammann was placed near the Verrazzano Narrows Bridge on June 28, 1979.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "53327", "revid": "40943757", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53327", "title": "Val Kilmer", "text": "American actor (1959\u20132025)\nVal Edward Kilmer (December 31, 1959 \u2013 April 1, 2025) was an American actor. Initially a stage actor, he later found fame as a leading man in films in a wide variety of genres, including comedies, dramas, action adventures, westerns, historical films, crime dramas, science fiction films, and fantasy films. Films in which Kilmer appeared grossed more than $3.85\u00a0billion worldwide. In 1992, the film critic Roger Ebert remarked, \"if there is an award for the most unsung leading man of his generation, Kilmer should get it\".\nKilmer started his film career in the comedy films \"Top Secret!\" (1984) and \"Real Genius\" (1985), before transitioning to dramatic films. He rose to prominence for playing Iceman in \"Top Gun\" (1986), Madmartigan in \"Willow\" (1988), Jim Morrison in \"The Doors\" (1991),' (1993), Doc Holliday in \"Tombstone\" (1993), Batman / Bruce Wayne in \"Batman Forever\" (1995), and Chris Shiherlis in \"Heat\" (1995), Kilmer made his final film appearance in \"\" (2022), reprising his role from the original film.\nOn stage, Kilmer made his Broadway theatre debut acting in the John Byrne working class play \"The Slab Boys\" (1983). He also acted in productions of William Shakespeare's history play \"Henry IV, Part 1\" (1981) and in the John Ford tragedy \"'Tis Pity She's a Whore\" (1992) both at The Public Theater. He portrayed Mark Twain in a one-man show he had written titled \"Citizen Twain\" in a 2012 production in Los Angeles.\nIn 2015, Kilmer was diagnosed with throat cancer. He subsequently underwent a tracheal procedure that damaged his vocal cords, leaving him with severe difficulty speaking. He also underwent chemotherapy and two tracheotomies, and released his memoir, \"I'm Your Huckleberry: A Memoir\" (2020), and the documentary \"Val\" (2021), both of which detail his career and health struggles. He died of pneumonia on April 1, 2025 at the age of 65.\nEarly life, family and education.\nVal Edward Kilmer was born on December 31, 1959, in Los Angeles, California, the second of three sons to Gladys Swanette (n\u00e9e\u00a0Ekstadt; 1928\u20132019) and industrialist and developer Eugene Dorris Kilmer (1921\u20131993). His mother was of Swedish descent, and his father's ancestry included Irish, German, and Cherokee roots. His parents divorced in 1968 when he was 8 years old and in 1970, his mother married William Bernard Leach.\nKilmer was raised with Christian Science beliefs, which he maintained for most of his life. In 1977, Kilmer's younger brother Wesley (1961\u20131977), who had epilepsy, drowned in a hot tub at age 16.\nKilmer attended Chatsworth High School where he was friends with actors Kevin Spacey and Mare Winningham, whom Kilmer dated. He became the youngest person at the time to be accepted into the Juilliard School's Drama Division, where he was a member of Group 10. At Juilliard, Kilmer and Spacey's friendship ended over a financial matter.\nCareer.\nEarly roles and comedy films.\nKilmer declined a role in Francis Ford Coppola's 1983 film \"The Outsiders\" because he had prior theater commitments. In 1983, he appeared off Broadway in \"The Slab Boys\" with Kevin Bacon, Sean Penn, and Jackie Earle Haley. That same year, his first off-stage acting role (excluding television commercials) came in the form of an episode of \"ABC Afterschool Special\" called \"One Too Many\", although it did not air until 1985. It was an educational drama on drinking and driving, and co-starred a young Michelle Pfeiffer. Also in 1983, Kilmer self-published a collection of his own poetry entitled \"My Edens After Burns,\" that included poems inspired by his time with Pfeiffer. This book of poems is difficult to obtain and expensive; known second-hand copies cost $300 and up.\nHis big break came when he received top billing in the comedy spoof of spy movies \"Top Secret!\", in which he played an American rock and roll star. Kilmer sang all the songs in the film and released an album under the film character's name, \"Nick Rivers\".\nDuring a brief hiatus, Kilmer backpacked throughout Europe before going on to play the lead character in the 1985 comedy \"Real Genius\". He turned down a role in David Lynch's \"Blue Velvet\" before being cast as naval aviator Tom \"Iceman\" Kazansky in the action film \"Top Gun\" alongside Tom Cruise. \"Top Gun\" grossed a total of over $344\u00a0million worldwide and made Kilmer a major star. Following roles in the television films \"The Murders in the Rue Morgue\" and \"The Man Who Broke 1,000 Chains,\" Kilmer portrayed Madmartigan in the fantasy \"Willow;\" he met his future wife, co-star Joanne Whalley, on the film's set. Kilmer starred in the Colorado Shakespeare Festival production of \"Hamlet\" in 1988. In 1989, Kilmer played the lead in \"Kill Me Again\", again opposite Whalley, and played William H. \"Billy the Kid\" Bonney in \"Gore Vidal's Billy the Kid\".\n1990\u20131995: Stardom with \"The Doors\" and \"Batman\".\nAfter several delays, director Oliver Stone finally started production on the film \"The Doors\", based on the story of the band of the same name. Kilmer spoke with Oliver Stone early on, concerned about what he might want to do with the story because Kilmer did not believe in or want to promote substance abuse. Kilmer saw Jim Morrison as having picked the wrong heroes, who had different issues, which were not part of the creativity or inspiration. Kilmer saw Morrison's story as one that could be told \"a thousand different ways\" and did not want to tell it by playing the role in the style of drugs, with which Oliver Stone agreed. Kilmer memorized the lyrics to all of lead singer Morrison's songs prior to his audition and sent a video of himself performing some Doors songs to director Stone. Stone was not impressed with the tape, but Paul A. Rothchild (the original producer of the Doors) said \"I was shaken by it\" and suggested they record Kilmer in the studio. After Kilmer was cast as Morrison, he prepared for the role by attending Doors tribute concerts and reading Morrison's poetry.\nHe spent close to a year before production dressing in Morrison-like clothes and spent time at Morrison's old hangouts along the Sunset Strip. His portrayal of Morrison was praised and members of the Doors noted that Kilmer did such a convincing job that they had trouble distinguishing his voice from Morrison's. Paul Rothchild played Kilmer's version of \"The End\" for the band's guitarist, Robby Krieger, who told him, \"I'm really glad they got 'The End'. We never got a recording of that live with Jim and now we've got it.\" However, Doors keyboardist Ray Manzarek was less than enthusiastic with how Morrison was portrayed in Stone's interpretation.\nIn the early 1990s, Kilmer starred in the mystery thriller \"Thunderheart\", the action comedy \"The Real McCoy\", and again teamed with \"Top Gun\" director Tony Scott to play Elvis Presley in \"True Romance\", which was written by Quentin Tarantino. In 1993, Kilmer played Doc Holliday in the western \"Tombstone\" alongside Kurt Russell. In the film, Doc Holliday performs Chopin's Nocturne in E minor, Op.72, No. 1; however, Kilmer did not play the piano and he practiced that one piece for months in preparation. In 1995, Kilmer starred in \"Wings of Courage\", a 3D IMAX film, and that same year, he starred opposite Al Pacino and Robert De Niro in \"Heat\", which is now considered one of the best crime/drama films of the 1990s.\nIn December 1993 \"Batman Forever\" director Joel Schumacher had seen \"Tombstone\" and was most impressed with Kilmer's performance as Doc Holliday. Schumacher felt him to be perfect for the role of Batman, though at the time, the role was still Michael Keaton's. In July 1994, Keaton decided not to return for a third Batman film after 1992's \"Batman Returns\", due to \"creative differences\". William Baldwin (who previously worked with Schumacher on \"Flatliners\") was reported to be a top contender, though just days after Keaton dropped out, Kilmer was cast. Kilmer took the role without even knowing who the new director was and without reading the script.\nReleased in June 1995, \"Batman Forever\" was a success at the box office, despite receiving mixed reviews from critics. There was debate about Kilmer's performance: some critics, such as \"The New York Times\"' Janet Maslin, thought Kilmer was a poor successor to Keaton in the part; while others, such as Roger Ebert, had kind words for Kilmer. \"Batman\" co-creator Bob Kane said in a \"Cinescape\" interview that of all the actors to have played Batman up to that point, he felt Kilmer had given the best interpretation. Film critic Leonard Maltin (who criticized the dark tone contained in \"Batman Returns\") complimented Kilmer's portrayal when he reviewed the film in his 2009 movie guide.\nIn February 1996, Kilmer decided not to return for another Batman feature film, feeling that Batman was being marginalized in favor of the villains, as well as his scheduling problems with \"The Saint\", and George Clooney replaced him as Batman in 1997's \"Batman &amp; Robin\". There were also reports that Kilmer had a bad working relationship with Schumacher, as another reason for not reprising the role.\n1996\u20132009: Further career.\nIn 1996 he appeared in a largely unknown film, \"Dead Girl\", and starred alongside Marlon Brando in the poorly received \"The Island of Dr. Moreau\". That year, Kilmer starred alongside Michael Douglas in the thriller \"The Ghost and the Darkness\". In 1997 he played Simon Templar in the popular action film \"The Saint\". Kilmer looked forward to the title role as a change toward a more fun, less serious action thriller, while enjoying the \"master of disguise\" chameleon characters including a mad artist, a nerdy British scientist, a cleaner, and a Russian mob boss. Kilmer also wrote the poetry in the film. He received a salary of $6\u00a0million for the movie. \"The Saint\" was a financial success, grossing $169.4\u00a0million worldwide. In 1998, he voiced both Moses and God in the animated film \"The Prince of Egypt\", before starring in the independent film \"Joe the King\" (1999). Also in 1999, he played a blind man in the drama/romance \"At First Sight\", which he described as being, as of then, the hardest role he had ever had.\nKilmer's first role in 2000 was in the big budget Warner Bros. box office disaster \"Red Planet\". That same year, he had a supporting role as the Dutch-born American abstract expressionist painter Willem DeKooning in the film \"Pollock\" and hosted \"Saturday Night Live\" for the first time. In 2002, he starred in the thriller \"The Salton Sea\", which was generally well-reviewed, but received only a limited release. The same year, he teamed with his \"True Romance\" co-star, Christian Slater, to appear in the low-budget film \"Hard Cash\", also known as \"Run for the Money\".\nIn 2003, Kilmer starred alongside Kate Bosworth in the drama/thriller \"Wonderland\", portraying porn star John Holmes. He also appeared in \"The Missing\", where he again worked with \"Willow\" director Ron Howard. The next year, he starred in David Mamet's \"Spartan\", where he played a United States government secret agent who is assigned the task of rescuing the kidnapped daughter of the president. He received Delta Force-like training in preparation for the role. Subsequently, he had a role in the drama \"Stateside\", and starred (again with Slater) in the thriller \"Mindhunters\", which was filmed in 2003 but not released until 2005. Kilmer next appeared in the big budget Oliver Stone production \"Alexander\", which received poor reviews.\nAlso in 2004, Kilmer returned to the theater to play Moses in a Los Angeles musical production of \"\", produced by BCBG founder Max Azria. The production played at the Kodak Theatre in Hollywood and also featured Adam Lambert. This same year, Kilmer appeared in an episode of \"Entourage\", where he played a Sherpa whose primary source of income was growing, harvesting, and distributing high-quality cannabis, all under a guise of metaphysical insights.\nKilmer was in negotiations with Richard Dutcher (a leading director of Mormon-related films) to play the lead role in a film entitled \"Prophet: The Story of Joseph Smith\", although the project never materialized. Kilmer performed in \"The Postman Always Rings Twice\" on the London stage from June to September 2005. In 2005, he co-starred with Robert Downey, Jr. in the action-comedy film \"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\". His performance was praised and the film was well reviewed, but it received only a limited release. It later won the award for \"Overlooked Film of the Year\" from the Phoenix Film Critics Society.\n\"Filmink\" argued \"we're really surprised Kilmer could not make more of a comeback in the 2000s. Was he too chubby? Had he burned too many bridges? Another '90s movie star who hit a cold streak and got jowly Alec Baldwin came back in a big way via \"30 Rock\", but for whatever reason, Kilmer could never come close to his old glory.\"\nIn 2006, Kilmer reunited with director Tony Scott for a third time for a supporting role opposite Denzel Washington in the box-office hit \"D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu\". The song \"Val Kilmer\" was named after him on Bowling for Soup's 2006 album \"The Great Burrito Extortion Case\". The song was later used for a Ford Motors commercial on season 10 of \"American Idol\" in 2011. In 2007, he guest-starred on the hit TV series \"Numb3rs\" in the episode \"Trust Metric\", portraying torture expert Mason Lancer. That same year, he released a CD, proceeds of which went to his charity interests. In 2008, Kilmer starred alongside Stephen Dorff in the Sony and Stage 6 film \"Felon\". The film was given only a limited theatrical release in New York and Los Angeles in 2008, but it developed into a success secondary to positive word of mouth. Kilmer was the voice of the car KITT for the 2008 \"Knight Rider\" TV pilot film and the following television series. He replaced Will Arnett, who had to step down from the role due to contractual conflict with General Motors. In keeping with tradition established by the original \"Knight Rider\" series and original KITT actor William Daniels, Kilmer was uncredited for the role on-screen. He next starred alongside Nicolas Cage in the Werner Herzog film \"\", and alongside Curtis \"50 Cent\" Jackson in \"Streets of Blood\". Both were released in 2009. He appeared as the main antagonist \"Mongoose\" in a live TV series adaptation of the comic/video game of \"XIII\" on NBC in 2009.\n2010\u20132025: Later work and final projects.\nIn 2010, Kilmer starred in Michael Oblowitz's horror film \"The Traveler\", in which he played the vengeful spirit of a man who had been tortured and murdered while in police custody. In November 2010, Kilmer was filming in Kelseyville, California. He was finally able to work with his lifelong friend Francis Ford Coppola and star in the film \"Twixt\". The film was filmed mostly on Coppola's estate in Napa County. The filming was expected to take five weeks and was being independently funded by Coppola. In 2010, Kilmer appeared as the villain Dieter Von Cunth in \"MacGruber\" and had a small cameo role in the music video for Tenacious D's \"To Be the Best\". Kilmer spoke at the May 5, 2010, commencement ceremonies of William Woods University in Fulton, Missouri. During his week-long visit on campus, he also performed his one-man play, \"Citizen Twain\". He received an honorary doctorate \"in recognition of his creative abilities and his contributions to art and theater\".\nIn 2012, Kilmer received a Grammy nomination for Best Spoken Word. He also starred in Harmony Korine's short film \"The Lotus Community Workshop\", part of the collaborative film \"The Fourth Dimension\". He plays a version of himself from an alternate reality: a former actor turned self-help guru. \"The Fourth Dimension\" is a collection of three standalone short films about parallel universes produced by Vice Films in collaboration with Grolsch Film Works, a new division of the namesake beer company. Kilmer noted that his addition to the list of actors, including John Malkovich (\"Being John Malkovich\") and Al Pacino (\"Jack and Jill\"), that mock their real-life persona in fictional movies was an accident and said that, \"I still love saying the premise because it makes me laugh every time.\"\nIn 2002, Kilmer worked on a film about the life of Mary Baker Eddy, the founder of the Christian Science church, and Mark Twain, one of her most famous critics. The film is about the lives and relationship of Eddy and Twain as \"a quirky, tender, tragicomic portrait of two contrasting lives, set against the backdrop of the United States during the Gilded Age.\" \"Citizen Twain\" was initially performed as a one-man show Hollywood workshop in April 2012; it then became the basis of Kilmer's film project, his directorial debut. The 90-minute film version of his one-man stage show was released as \"Cinema Twain\". In 2013, he reunited with his \"Top Gun\" co-star Anthony Edwards in the Disney animated movie 'Planes'. Kilmer voiced the character Bravo, while Edwards supplied Echo. Kilmer also played the role of Detective Dobson in the series finale of the television show \"Psych\".\nIn 2017, Kilmer appeared in \"Song to Song\" opposite Rooney Mara and Ryan Gosling and directed by Terrence Malick. Kilmer also appeared in the 2017 film \"The Snowman\", opposite Michael Fassbender and Rebecca Ferguson and directed by Tomas Alfredson. In August 2020, Kilmer shared the screen with his daughter, Mercedes Kilmer, for the first time in \"Paydirt\". Kilmer reprised his role as Tom \"Iceman\" Kazansky for the \"Top Gun\" sequel \"\" (2022). The 2021 documentary film \"Val\", which chronicles his health struggles and career, premiered at the Cannes Film Festival to critical acclaim and later earned two Critics' Choice Documentary Awards.\nAs Kilmer's throat problems affected his vocal abilities, technology solutions were sought. In 2021, he collaborated with Sonantic, a London-based software company, to digitally recreate his voice using AI and archived recordings. More than 40 vocal models were created to find the closest match for future projects. For the 2022 film \"\", director Joseph Kosinski stated that, despite reports to the contrary, they did not use Sonantic's AI technology in the film. Instead, Kilmer's actual voice was digitally altered for clarity.\nKilmer had been set to make an appearance at the Beverly Hills Film Festival in Beverly Hills, California on April 1, 2025, hours before his death.\nPersonal life.\nRelationships and family.\nOver the years, Kilmer dated Cher, Lesley Ann Warren, Cindy Crawford, Angelina Jolie, Daryl Hannah and Ellen Barkin.\nKilmer was married to actress Joanne Whalley from March 1988 to February 1996. The two met while working together on the 1988 film \"Willow\". They had two children, Mercedes and Jack Kilmer.\nResidences and activities.\nKilmer owned a ranch in New Mexico, where he would trek, hike, fish, and raise bison. He sold it in 2011. \nKilmer was an avid musician; he released a demo album, \"Sessions with Mick\", in 2007. He was also a painter and photographer.\nReputation.\nKilmer had a reputation for being difficult to work with and having feuds with some of the actors with whom he worked, notably \"The Island of Dr. Moreau\" co-star Marlon Brando and \"Red Planet\" and \"Heat\" co-star Tom Sizemore. Kilmer's \"Tombstone\" co-star, Michael Biehn, said: \"People ask me what it's like to work with Val Kilmer. I don't know. Never met him. Never shook his hand. I know Doc Holliday, but I don't know [Kilmer].\"\nRichard Stanley, who directed Kilmer for three days in \"The Island of Dr. Moreau\" before being fired, recalled, \"Val would arrive, and an argument would happen.\" John Frankenheimer, who replaced Stanley, said, \"I don't like Val Kilmer, I don't like his work ethic, and I don't want to be associated with him ever again.\" \"Batman Forever\" director Joel Schumacher called Kilmer \"childish and impossible\".\nWhen Kilmer's \"At First Sight\" co-star Mira Sorvino was asked about his reputation as \"difficult to work with\", she responded: \"You know what, he was real easy to work with. I just hate furthering rumours about people being difficult, because it can do such enormous damage to their careers. My experience with him was nothing but positive. He was really professional and gentlemanly, and a terrific actor.\" Kurt Russell, Kilmer's co-star in \"Tombstone\", said of working with him: \"If you're asking me if it was great working with Val Kilmer, who played Doc Holliday on \"Tombstone\", the answer is absolutely.\" Drew Barrymore, who costarred with Kilmer in \"Batman Forever\", said of her experience with the actor: \"Val Kilmer was so nice to me. He was so nurturing and kind and safe, which was a very important thing for me.\"\nHilarie Burton, Kilmer's co-star in \"Bloodworth\", called him \"the sweetest man\" and said he cut a gratuitous sex scene between them in the film because \"it didn't service the story or the character\", instead changing it to a scene in which their characters are enjoying barbecued ribs. \"I felt so safe and cared for by that man... He made the scene about us instead of using me as a prop. That one day at work rewired my brain. Val was kind to me. A thoughtful artist. I bought some of his paintings a few years back. I hope every young actor has a Val in their life. That movie was a magical experience,\" she said. David Thewlis, Kilmer's co-star in \"The Island of Dr. Moreau\" said of working with him; \"I spent the most bizarre 5 months of my entire life with Val Kilmer, out in the Australian rainforest, on the ill fated Island of Dr Moreau. It was so spectacularly bleak and awful it was almost wonderful. Look it up sometime. As Val wrote in his final mail to me: 'What an incredible story we lived, you and I. One of the greatest.'\"\nPolitical views and charity work.\nIn 1998, Kilmer traveled to Iraq with AmeriCares to deliver humanitarian aid, the first US humanitarian airlift to Iraq since 1990. Kilmer made several trips to New Orleans to help in the 2005 Hurricane Katrina disaster relief. He was a supporter of Native American affairs and an advocate of environmental protection. Kilmer briefly considered running for Governor of New Mexico in 2010 but decided against it.\nIn May 2013, Kilmer lobbied Congress on behalf of the Equitable Access to Care and Health Act, or EACH Act (H.R. 1814), a bill \"to provide an additional religious exemption from the individual health coverage mandate\" of Obamacare.\nHealth.\nIn 2014, Kilmer was forced to cancel a \"Citizen Twain\" show after losing his voice. He noticed a lump in his throat but did not seek medical care until he started vomiting blood. In January 2015, aged 55, he was hospitalized for what his representative said were tests for a possible tumor. Kilmer stated on social media, \"I have not had a tumor, or tumor operations [\"sic\"], or any operation. I had a complication where the best way to receive care was to stay under the watchful eye of the UCLA ICU.\" Kilmer was a lifelong Christian Scientist, and upon his throat cancer diagnosis referred to it in the press as \"the suggestion of throat cancer\", opting not to explicitly associate himself with such a diagnosis. He underwent recommended chemotherapy following his children's request despite it being conventionally against his religion.\nAfter previously denying persistent rumors that he had been diagnosed with cancer, Kilmer said in April 2017 that he had experienced a \"healing of cancer\". In December 2017, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" revealed that Kilmer had endured a \"two-year battle with throat cancer\" and that \"a procedure on his trachea has reduced his voice to a rasp and rendered him short of breath.\" To speak, Kilmer plugged an electric voice box into his trachea.\nHe ultimately underwent chemotherapy and two tracheotomies. Kilmer reported in 2020 that he had been cancer-free for four years but continued to struggle with medical treatments, including the use of a feeding tube.\nDeath and tributes.\nKilmer died of pneumonia in Los Angeles on April 1, 2025, aged 65. Other contributing underlying factors towards his death included acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, chronic respiratory failure, squamous cell carcinoma on the base of his tongue, malnutrition and tracheocutaneous fistula. Kilmer was cremated on April 7.\nUpon his death, filmmaker Michael Mann wrote, \"While working with Val on \"Heat,\" I always marvelled at the range, the brilliant variability within the powerful current of Val's possessing and expressing character. After so many years of Val battling disease and maintaining his spirit, this is tremendously sad news.\" Director Francis Ford Coppola wrote, \"He was a wonderful person to work with and a joy to know\u00a0\u2014 I will always remember him.\" Tom Cruise honored his \"Top Gun\" co-star at CinemaCon asking for a moment of silence saying, \"I think it would be really nice if we could have a moment together because he loved movies and he gave a lot to all of us.\" Director Oliver Stone wrote: \"Val Kilmer was brilliant, both as Jim Morrison in \"The Doors\" and in \"Alexander\" as King Philip of Macedon. His approach and attitude significantly changed between 1990 and \"Alexander\" in 2004. The results satisfied me on both occasions. To call Val turbulent, contradictory, and tortured is an understatement. But the result was he was exciting on film, always exciting, and fresh. We need more Vals. He was an iconoclast and rebel in his acting, and always kept it exciting in either supporting or main roles. The movies will miss him.\" The Doors' drummer John Densmore wrote: \"As an actor, Val's channeling of Jim (Morrison) was so close, he gave me the creeps on the set of Oliver Stone's biopic. He should have been nominated for an Oscar as Best Actor.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The vivid crimson stigma and styles, called threads, are collected and dried for use mainly as a seasoning and colouring agent in food. The saffron crocus was slowly propagated throughout much of Eurasia and was later brought to parts of North Africa, North America, and Oceania.\nSaffron's taste and iodoform-like or hay-like fragrance result from the phytochemicals picrocrocin and safranal. It also contains a carotenoid pigment, crocin, which imparts a rich golden-yellow hue to dishes and textiles. Its quality is graded by the proportion of red stigma to yellow style, varying by region and affecting both potency and value. As of 2024, Iran produced some 90% of the world total for saffron. At US$5,000 per kg or higher, saffron has long been the world's costliest spice by weight.\nThe English word saffron likely originates from the Old French \"safran\", which traces back through Latin and Persian to the word \"zarpar\u0101n\", meaning 'gold strung'. It is a sterile, human-propagated, autumn-flowering plant descended from wild relatives in the eastern Mediterranean, cultivated for its fragrant purple flowers and valuable red stigmas in sunny, temperate climates. Saffron is primarily used as a culinary spice and natural colourant, with additional historical uses in traditional medicine, dyeing, perfumery, and religious rituals.\nSaffron likely originated in or near Greece, Iran, Kashmir or Mesopotamia. It has been cultivated and traded for over 3,500 years across Eurasia, spreading through Asia via cultural exchange and conquest. Its recorded history is attested in a 7th-century BC Assyrian botanical treatise.\nEtymology.\nThe English word \"saffron\" is a borrowing from French, first found in a Middle English text written around 1200 as \"saffran\". It derives from the 12th-century Old French term \"safran\", which comes from the Medieval Latin word , and from the Arabic (, \"za'far\u0101n\").\nSpecies.\nDescription.\nThe domesticated saffron crocus, \"Crocus sativus\", is an autumn-flowering perennial plant unknown in the wild. It possibly descends from the eastern Mediterranean autumn-flowering \"Crocus cartwrightianus\" which is also known as \"wild saffron\" and is native to mainland Greece, Euboea, Crete, Skyros and some islands of the Cyclades. The similar species \"C.\u00a0thomasii\" and \"C.\u00a0pallasii\" were considered as other possible ancestors. As a genetically monomorphic clone incapable of seed production, it was slowly propagated by humans throughout much of Eurasia. Various origins have been suggested for saffron, including Iran, Greece, Mesopotamia, and Kashmir.\nIt is a sterile triploid form, which means that three homologous sets of chromosomes make up each specimen's genetic complement; \"C.\u00a0sativus\" bears eight chromosomal bodies per set, making for 24 in total. Being sterile, the purple flowers of \"C.\u00a0sativus\" fail to produce viable seeds; reproduction hinges on human assistance: clusters of corms, underground, bulb-like, starch-storing organs, must be dug up, divided, and replanted. A corm survives for one season, producing via vegetative division up to ten \"cormlets\" that can grow into new plants in the next season. The compact corms are small, brown globules that can measure as large as in diameter, have a flat base, and are shrouded in a dense mat of parallel fibres; this coat is referred to as the \"corm tunic\". Corms also bear vertical fibres, thin and net-like, that grow up to above the plant's neck.\nThe plant sprouts 5\u201311 white and non-photosynthetic leaves known as cataphylls. These membrane-like structures cover and protect 5 to 11 true leaves as they bud and develop on the crocus flower. The latter are thin, straight, and blade-like green foliage leaves, which are , in diameter, which either expand after the flowers have opened (\"hysteranthous\") or do so simultaneously with their blooming (\"synanthous\"). \"C.\u00a0sativus\" cataphylls are suspected by some to manifest prior to blooming when the plant is irrigated relatively early in the growing season. Its floral axes, or flower-bearing structures, bear bracteoles, or specialised leaves, that sprout from the flower stems; the latter are known as pedicels. After aestivating in spring, the plant sends up its true leaves, each up to in length. Only in October, after most other flowering plants have released their seeds, do its brilliantly hued flowers develop; they range from a light pastel shade of lilac to a darker and more striated mauve. The flowers possess a sweet, honey-like fragrance. Upon flowering, the plants are in height and bear up to four flowers. A three-pronged style in length, emerges from each flower. Each prong terminates with a vivid crimson stigma, which is the distal end of a carpel.\nCultivation.\nThe saffron crocus, unknown in the wild, probably descends from \"Crocus cartwrightianus\". It is a triploid that is \"self-incompatible\" and male sterile; it undergoes aberrant meiosis and is hence incapable of independent sexual reproduction\u2014all propagation is by vegetative multiplication via manual \"divide-and-set\" of a starter clone or by interspecific hybridisation.\n\"Crocus sativus\" thrives in the Mediterranean maquis, an ecotype superficially resembling the North American chaparral, and similar climates where hot and dry summer breezes sweep semi-arid lands. It can nonetheless survive cold winters, tolerating frosts as low as and short periods of snow cover. Some reports suggest saffron can tolerate an air temperature range from \u221222 to 40\u2009\u00b0C. Irrigation is required if grown outside of moist environments such as Kashmir, where annual rainfall averages ; saffron-growing regions in Greece ( annually) and Spain () are far drier than the main cultivating Iranian regions. What makes this possible is the timing of the local wet seasons; generous spring rains and drier summers are optimal. Rain immediately preceding flowering boosts saffron yields; rainy or cold weather during flowering promotes disease and reduces yields. Persistently damp and hot conditions harm the crops, and rabbits, rats, and birds cause damage by digging up corms. Nematodes, leaf rusts, and corm rot pose other threats. Yet \"Bacillus subtilis\" inoculation may provide some benefit to growers by speeding corm growth and increasing stigma biomass yield.\nThe plants fare poorly in shady conditions; they grow best in full sunlight. Fields that slope towards the sunlight are optimal (i.e., south-sloping in the Northern Hemisphere). Planting is mostly done in June in the Northern Hemisphere, where corms are lodged deep; its roots, stems, and leaves can develop between October and February. Planting depth and corm spacing, in concert with climate, are critical factors in determining yields. Mother corms planted deeper yield higher-quality saffron, though they form fewer flower buds and daughter corms. Italian growers optimise thread yield by planting deep and in rows apart; depths of optimise flower and corm production. Greek, Moroccan, and Spanish growers employ distinct depths and spacings that suit their locales.\n\"C.\u00a0sativus\" prefers friable, loose, low-density, well-watered, and well-drained clay-calcareous soils with high organic content. Traditional raised beds promote good drainage. Soil organic content was historically boosted via application of some of manure. Afterwards, and with no further manure application, corms were planted. After a period of dormancy through the summer, the corms send up their narrow leaves and begin to bud in early autumn. Only in mid-autumn do they flower. Harvests are by necessity a speedy affair: after blossoming at dawn, flowers quickly wilt as the day passes. All plants bloom within a window of one or two weeks. Stigmas are dried quickly upon extraction and (preferably) sealed in airtight containers.\nHarvesting.\nThe high retail value of saffron is maintained on world markets because of labour-intensive harvesting methods, which require some \u2013 equivalently, . Forty hours of labour are needed to pick 150,000 flowers.\nOne freshly picked crocus flower yields on average 30\u00a0mg of fresh saffron or 7\u00a0mg dried; roughly 150 flowers yield of dry saffron threads; to produce of dried saffron, of flowers are needed; the yield of dried spice from fresh saffron is only .\nSpice.\nPhytochemistry and sensory properties.\nSaffron contains some 28 volatile and aroma-yielding compounds, dominated by ketones and aldehydes. Its main aroma-active compounds are safranal \u2013 the main compound responsible for saffron aroma \u2013 4-ketoisophorone, and dihydrooxophorone. Saffron also contains nonvolatile phytochemicals, including the carotenoids zeaxanthin, lycopene, various \u03b1- and \u03b2-carotenes, as well as crocetin and its glycoside crocein, which are the most biologically active components. Because crocetin is smaller and more water-soluble than the other carotenoids, it is more rapidly absorbed.\nThe yellow-orange colour of saffron is primarily the result of \u03b1-crocin. This crocin is trans-crocetin di-(\u03b2-D-gentiobiosyl) ester; it bears the systematic (IUPAC) name 8,8-diapo-8,8-carotenoic acid. This means that the crocin underlying saffron's aroma is a digentiobiose ester of the carotenoid crocetin. Crocins themselves are a series of hydrophilic carotenoids that are either monoglycosyl or diglycosyl polyene esters of crocetin. Crocetin is a conjugated polyene dicarboxylic acid that is hydrophobic, and thus oil-soluble. When crocetin is esterified with two water-soluble gentiobioses, which are sugars, a product results that is itself water-soluble. The resultant \u03b1-crocin is a carotenoid pigment that may make up more than 10% of dry saffron's mass. The two esterified gentiobioses make \u03b1-crocin ideal for colouring water-based and non-fatty foods such as rice dishes.\nThe bitter glucoside picrocrocin is responsible for saffron's pungent flavour. Picrocrocin (chemical formula: ; systematic name: 4-(\u03b2-D-glucopyranosyloxy)-2,6,6-trimethylcyclohex-1-ene-1-carbaldehyde) is a union of an aldehyde sub-molecule known as safranal (systematic name: 2,6,6-trimethylcyclohexa-1,3-diene-1-carbaldehyde) and a carbohydrate. It has insecticidal and pesticidal properties, and may comprise up to 4% of dry saffron. Picrocrocin is a truncated version of the carotenoid zeaxanthin that is produced via oxidative cleavage, and is the glycoside of the terpene aldehyde safranal.\nWhen saffron is dried after its harvest, the heat, combined with enzymatic action, splits picrocrocin to yield D\u2013glucose and a free safranal molecule. Safranal, a volatile oil, gives saffron much of its distinctive aroma. Safranal is less bitter than picrocrocin and may comprise up to 70% of dry saffron's volatile fraction in some samples. A second molecule underlying saffron's aroma is 2-hydroxy-4,4,6-trimethyl-2,5-cyclohexadien-1-one, which produces a scent described as saffron, dried hay-like. Chemists find this is the most powerful contributor to saffron's fragrance, despite its presence in a lesser quantity than safranal. Dry saffron is highly sensitive to fluctuating pH levels, and rapidly breaks down chemically in the presence of light and oxidising agents. It must, therefore, be stored in air-tight containers to minimise contact with atmospheric oxygen. Saffron is somewhat more resistant to heat.\nGrades and ISO 3632 categories.\nSaffron is not all of the same quality and strength. Strength is related to several factors, including age and the amount of yellow style picked relative to red stigma, as colour and flavour are concentrated in the latter. \nSaffron from Iran, Spain, and Kashmir is classified into various grades according to the proportion of stigma to style it contains. Grades of Iranian saffron are: \"sargol\" (, red stigma tips only, strongest grade), \"pushal\" or \"pushali\" (red stigmas plus some yellow style, lower strength), \"bunch\" saffron (red stigmas plus large amount of yellow style, presented in a tiny bundle like a miniature wheatsheaf) and \"konge\" (yellow style only, claimed to have aroma but with very little, if any, colouring potential). Grades of Spanish saffron are \"coup\u00e9\" (the strongest grade, like Iranian sargol), \"mancha\" (like Iranian pushal), and in order of further decreasing strength \"rio\", \"standard\" and \"sierra\" saffron. The word \"mancha\" in the Spanish classification can have two meanings: a general grade of saffron or a very high quality Spanish-grown saffron from a specific geographical origin. Real Spanish-grown La Mancha saffron has PDO protected status, which is displayed on the product packaging. Spanish growers fought hard for Protected Status because they felt that imports of Iranian saffron re-packaged in Spain and sold as \"Spanish Mancha saffron\" were undermining the genuine La Mancha brand. Similar was the case in Kashmir where imported Iranian saffron is mixed with local saffron and sold as \"Kashmir brand\" at a higher price. In Kashmir, saffron is mostly classified into two main categories called \"mongra\" (stigma alone) and \"lachha\" (stigmas attached with parts of the style). Countries producing less saffron do not have specialised words for different grades and may only produce one grade. Artisan producers in Europe and New Zealand have offset their higher labour charges for saffron harvesting by targeting quality, only offering extremely high-grade saffron.\nIn addition to descriptions based on how the saffron is picked, saffron may be categorised under the international standard ISO 3632 after laboratory measurement of crocin (responsible for saffron's colour), picrocrocin (taste), and safranal (fragrance or aroma) content. However, often there is no clear grading information on the product packaging and little of the saffron readily available in the UK is labelled with ISO category. This lack of information makes it hard for customers to make informed choices when comparing prices and buying saffron.\nUnder ISO 3632, determination of non-stigma content (\"floral waste content\") and other extraneous matter such as inorganic material (\"ash\") are also key. Grading standards are set by the International Organization for Standardization, a federation of national standards bodies. ISO 3632 deals exclusively with saffron and establishes three categories: III (poorest quality), II, and I (finest quality). Formerly there was also category IV, which was below category III. Samples are assigned categories by gauging the spice's crocin and picrocrocin content, revealed by measurements of specific spectrophotometric absorbance. Safranal is treated slightly differently and rather than there being threshold levels for each category, samples must give a reading of 20\u201350 for all categories.\nThese data are measured through spectrophotometry reports at certified testing laboratories worldwide. Higher absorbances imply greater levels of crocin, picrocrocin and safranal, and thus a greater colouring potential and therefore strength per gram. The absorbance reading of crocin is known as the \"colouring strength\" of that saffron. Saffron's colouring strength can range from lower than 80 (for all category IV saffron) up to 200 or greater (for category I). The world's finest samples (the selected, most red-maroon, tips of stigmas picked from the finest flowers) receive colouring strengths in excess of 250, making such saffron over three times more powerful than category IV saffron. Market prices for saffron types follow directly from these ISO categories. Sargol and coup\u00e9 saffron would typically fall into ISO 3632 category I. Pushal and Mancha would probably be assigned to category II. On many saffron packaging labels, neither the ISO 3632 category nor the colouring strength (the measurement of crocin content) is displayed.\nHowever, many growers, traders, and consumers reject such lab test numbers. Some people prefer a more holistic method of sampling batches of threads for taste, aroma, pliability, and other traits in a fashion similar to that practised by experienced wine tasters.\nAdulteration.\nDespite attempts at quality control and standardisation, an extensive history of saffron adulteration, particularly among the cheapest grades, continues into modern times. Adulteration was first documented in Europe's Middle Ages, when those found selling adulterated saffron in Nuremberg were executed under the \"Safranschou\" code. Typical methods include mixing in extraneous substances like beetroot, pomegranate fibres, red-dyed silk fibres, or the saffron crocus's tasteless and odourless yellow stamens. Other methods included dousing saffron fibres with viscid substances like honey or vegetable oil to increase their weight. Powdered saffron is more prone to adulteration, with turmeric, paprika, and other powders used as diluting fillers. Adulteration can also consist of selling mislabelled mixes of different saffron grades. Thus, high-grade Kashmiri saffron is often sold and mixed with cheaper Iranian imports; these mixes are then marketed as pure Kashmiri saffron. Safflower is a common substitute sometimes sold as saffron. The spice is reportedly counterfeited with horse hair, corn silk, or shredded paper. Tartrazine or sunset yellow dyes have been used to colour counterfeit powdered saffron.\nIn recent years, saffron adulterated with the colouring extract of gardenia fruits has been detected in the European market. This form of fraud is difficult to detect due to the presence of flavonoids and crocines in the gardenia-extracts similar to those naturally occurring in saffron. Detection methods have been developed by using HPLC and mass spectrometry to determine the presence of geniposide, a compound present in the fruits of gardenia, but not in saffron.\nTypes.\nThe various saffron crocus cultivars give rise to thread types that are often regionally distributed and characteristically distinct. Varieties (not varieties in the botanical sense) from Spain, including the tradenames \"Spanish Superior\" and \"Creme\", are generally mellower in colour, flavour, and aroma; they are graded by government-imposed standards. Italian varieties are slightly more potent than Spanish. Greek saffron produced in the town of Krokos is PDO protected due to its particularly high-quality colour and strong flavour. Various \"boutique\" crops are available from New Zealand, France, Switzerland, England, the United States, and other countries\u2014some of them organically grown. In the US, Pennsylvania Dutch saffron\u2014known for its \"earthy\" notes\u2014is produced in small quantities.\nConsumers may regard certain cultivars as \"premium\" quality. The \"Aquila\" saffron, or \"zafferano dell'Aquila\", is defined by high safranal and crocin content, distinctive thread shape, unusually pungent aroma, and intense colour; it is grown exclusively on eight hectares in the Navelli Valley of Italy's Abruzzo region, near L'Aquila. It was first introduced to Italy by a Dominican friar from inquisition-era Spain. But the biggest saffron cultivation in Italy is in San Gavino Monreale, Sardinia, where it is grown on 40 hectares, representing 60% of Italian production; it too has unusually high crocin, picrocrocin, and safranal content.\nAnother is the \"Mongra\" or \"Lacha\" saffron of Kashmir (\"Crocus sativus\" 'Cashmirianus'), which is among the most difficult for consumers to obtain. Repeated droughts, blights, and crop failures in Kashmir combined with an Indian export ban, contribute to its prohibitive overseas prices. Kashmiri saffron is recognizable by its dark maroon-purple hue, making it among the world's darkest. In 2020, Kashmir Valley saffron was certified with a geographical indication from the Government of India.\nWorld production.\nAlmost all saffron grows in a belt from Spain in the west to India in the east. Iran is responsible for around 88% of global production. In 2024, Iran was the largest producer of saffron, with Afghanistan as the second largest. Saffron is cultivated in 26 of Afghanistan's 34 provinces, with most production concentrated in Herat.\nSpain is the third largest producer, while the United Arab Emirates, Greece, the Indian subcontinent and Morocco are among minor producers.\nTrade.\nSaffron prices at wholesale and retail rates range from . In Western countries, the average retail price in 1974 was . In February 2013, a retail bottle containing could be purchased for $16.26 or the equivalent of , or as little as about in larger quantities. There are between . Vivid crimson colouring, slight moistness, elasticity, and lack of broken-off thread debris are all traits of fresh saffron.\nUses.\nThe primary use of saffron is in food and drink preparation. Saffron has a long history of use in traditional medicine. Saffron has also been used as a fabric dye, particularly in China and India, and in perfumery. It is used for religious purposes in India. It is one of the ingredients used in the making of Arabic coffee in Saudi Arabia.\nIn the European E number categorisation for food elements and additives, Saffron is coded as E164.\nConsumption.\nSaffron's aroma is often described by connoisseurs as reminiscent of metallic honey with grassy or hay-like notes, while its taste has also been noted as hay-like and sweet. Saffron also contributes a luminous yellow-orange colouring to foods. Saffron is widely used in Persian, Indian, European, and Arab cuisines. Confectioneries and liquors also often include saffron. Saffron is used in dishes ranging from the jewelled rice and \"khoresh\" of Iran, the Milanese \"risotto\" of Italy, the \"paella\" of Spain, the \"bouillabaisse\" of France, to the \"biryani\" with various meat accompaniments in South Asia. Saffron is also used in the preparation of the \"Golden Ham\", a precious dry-cured ham made with saffron from San Gimignano in Tuscany. Common saffron substitutes include safflower (\"Carthamus tinctorius\", which is often sold as \"Portuguese saffron\" or \"a\u00e7afr\u00e3o\"), annatto, and turmeric (\"Curcuma longa\"). In Medieval Europe, turmeric was also known as \"Indian saffron\" because of its yellow-orange colour. \nNutrition.\nDried saffron is 65% carbohydrates, 6% fat, 11% protein (table) and 12% water. In one tablespoon (2 grams; a quantity much larger than is likely to be ingested in normal use) manganese is present as 29% of the Daily Value, while other micronutrients have negligible content (table).\nToxicity.\nIngesting less than of saffron is not toxic for humans, but doses greater than can become increasingly toxic. Mild toxicity includes dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, whereas at higher doses there can be reduced platelet count and spontaneous bleeding.\nStorage.\nSaffron will not spoil, but will lose flavour within six months if not stored in an airtight, cool and dark place. Freezer storage can maintain flavour for up to two years.\nResearch.\nSaffron is under preliminary research to assess its potential effect on depression and anxiety.\nSaffron may improve some cardiometabolic markers in overweight diabetic or prediabetic patients, but not lipid profiles or insulin-related measures.\nHistory.\nSaffron likely originated in Iran, Greece, Mesopotamia, or Kashmir. Harold McGee states that it was domesticated in or near Greece during the Bronze Age. \"C.\u00a0sativus\" is probably a triploid form of \"Crocus cartwrightianus\", which is also known as \"wild saffron\". Saffron crocus was slowly propagated by humans throughout much of Eurasia and was later brought to parts of North Africa, North America, and Oceania.\nSeveral wild species of \"Crocus\" similar to the commercial plant are known to have been harvested in recent times for use as saffron. \"Crocus ancyrensis\" was used to make saffron in Sivas in Central Turkey, the corms were also eaten. \"Crocus cartwrightianus\" was harvested on Andros in the islands of the Cyclades, for medicinal purposes and the stigmas for making a pigment called Zafran. \"Crocus longiflorus\" stigmas were used for saffron in Sicily. \"Crocus thomasii\" stigmas were used to flavour dishes around Taranto, South Italy. In Syria the stigmas of an unknown wild species were collected by women and children, sun-dried and pressed into small tablets which were sold in the Bazaars. Not all ancient depictions or descriptions of saffron spice or flowers are certain to be the same species as the modern commercial species used for spice.\nWest Asia.\nDocumentation of saffron's use over the span of 3,500 years has been uncovered. Saffron-based pigments have indeed been found in 50,000-year-old depictions of prehistoric places in northwest Iran. The Sumerians later used wild-growing saffron in their remedies and magical potions. It was also known in ancient Egypt, as indicated by a 2000\u202fBC papyrus. Saffron was an article of long-distance trade before the Minoan palace culture's 2nd millennium BC peak. Ancient Persians cultivated Persian saffron (\"Crocus sativus\" var. \"haussknechtii\" now called \"Crocus haussknechtii\" by botanists) in Derbent, Isfahan, and Khorasan by the 10th century BC. At such sites, saffron threads were woven into textiles, ritually offered to divinities, and used in dyes, perfumes, medicines, and body washes. Saffron threads would thus be scattered across beds and mixed into hot teas as a curative for bouts of melancholy. Non-Persians also feared the Persians' usage of saffron as a drugging agent and aphrodisiac.\nSaffron is featured in trade lists from Mari, Syria, is described in a 7th-century BC Assyrian botanical reference compiled under Ashurbanipal, and is listed among other aromatic plants in the Hebrew Bible, in \"Song of Songs\" 4:14. During his Asian campaigns, Alexander the Great used Persian saffron in his infusions, rice, and baths as a curative for battle wounds. Alexander's troops imitated the practice from the Persians and brought saffron-bathing to Greece.\nSouth Asia.\nConflicting theories explain saffron's arrival in South Asia. Kashmiri and Chinese accounts date its arrival anywhere between 2500 and 900 years ago. Historians studying ancient Persian records date the arrival to sometime prior to 500 BC, attributing it to a Persian transplantation of saffron corms to stock new gardens and parks. Phoenicians then marketed Kashmiri saffron as a dye and a treatment for melancholy. Its use in foods and dyes subsequently spread throughout South Asia. Buddhist monks wear saffron-coloured robes; however, the robes are not dyed with costly saffron but turmeric, a less expensive dye, or jackfruit. Monks' robes are dyed the same colour to show equality with each other, and turmeric or ochre were the cheapest, most readily available dyes. Gamboge is also used to dye the robes.\nEast Asia.\nSome historians believe that saffron came to China with Mongol invaders from Persia. Yet it is mentioned in ancient Chinese medical texts, including the forty-volume \"Shennong Bencaojing\", a pharmacopoeia written around 300\u2013200\u00a0BC. Traditionally credited to the legendary Yan Emperor and the deity Shennong, it discusses 252 plant-based medical treatments for various disorders. Nevertheless, around the 3rd century AD, the Chinese were referring to it as having a Kashmiri provenance. According to the herbalist Wan Zhen, \"the habitat of saffron is in Kashmir, where people grow it principally to offer it to the Buddha\". Wan also reflected on how it was used in his time: \"The flower withers after a few days, and then the saffron is obtained. It is valued for its uniform yellow colour. It can be used to aromatise wine.\"\nSouth East Mediterranean.\nMinoan depictions of saffron are now considered to be \"Crocus cartwrightianus\". The Minoans portrayed saffron in their palace frescoes by 1600\u20131500 BC; they hint at its possible use as a therapeutic drug. Ancient Greek legends told of sea voyages to Cilicia, where adventurers sought what they believed were the world's most valuable threads. Another legend tells of Crocus and Smilax, whereby Crocus is bewitched and transformed into the first saffron crocus. Ancient perfumers in Egypt, physicians in Gaza, townspeople in Rhodes, and the Greek \"hetaerae\" courtesans used saffron in their scented waters, perfumes and potpourris, mascaras and ointments, divine offerings, and medical treatments.\nIn late Ptolemaic Egypt, Cleopatra used saffron in her baths so that lovemaking would be more pleasurable. Egyptian healers used saffron as a treatment for all varieties of gastrointestinal ailments. Saffron was also used as a fabric dye in such Levantine cities as Sidon and Tyre in Lebanon. Aulus Cornelius Celsus prescribes saffron in medicines for wounds, cough, colic, and scabies, and in the mithridatium.\nWestern Europe.\nSaffron was a notable ingredient in certain Roman recipes such as jusselle and conditum. Such was the Romans' love of saffron that Roman colonists took it with them when they settled in southern Gaul, where it was extensively cultivated until Rome's fall. With this fall, European saffron cultivation plummeted. Competing theories state that saffron only returned to France with 8th-century AD Moors or with the Avignon papacy in the 14th century AD. Similarly, the spread of Islamic civilisation may have helped reintroduce the crop to Spain and Italy.\nThe 14th-century Black Death caused demand for saffron-based medicaments to peak, and Europe imported large quantities of threads via Venetian and Genoan ships from southern and Mediterranean lands such as Rhodes. The theft of one such shipment by noblemen sparked the fourteen-week-long Saffron War. The conflict and resulting fear of rampant saffron piracy spurred corm cultivation in Basel; it thereby grew prosperous. The crop then spread to Nuremberg, where endemic and insalubrious adulteration brought on the \"Safranschou\" code\u2014whereby culprits were variously fined, imprisoned, and executed. Meanwhile, cultivation continued in southern France, Italy, and Spain.\nDirect archaeological evidence of mediaeval saffron consumption in Scandinavia comes from the wreck of the royal Danish-Norwegian flagship, Gribshunden. The ship sank in 1495 while on a diplomatic mission to Sweden. Excavations in 2021 revealed concentrations of saffron threads and small \"pucks\" of compressed saffron powder, along with fresh ginger, cloves, and pepper. Surprisingly, the saffron retained its distinctive odour even after more than 500 years of submersion in the Baltic Sea.\nThe Essex town of Saffron Walden, named for its new specialty crop, emerged as a prime saffron growing and trading centre in the 16th and 17th centuries but cultivation there was abandoned; saffron was re-introduced around 2013 as well as other parts of the UK (Cheshire).\nThe Americas.\nEuropeans introduced saffron to the Americas when immigrant members of the Schwenkfelder Church left Europe with a trunk containing its corms. Church members had grown it widely in Europe. By 1730, the Pennsylvania Dutch cultivated saffron throughout eastern Pennsylvania. Spanish colonies in the Caribbean bought large amounts of this new American saffron, and high demand ensured that saffron's list price on the Philadelphia commodities exchange was equal to gold. Trade with the Caribbean later collapsed in the aftermath of the War of 1812, when many saffron-bearing merchant vessels were destroyed. Yet the Pennsylvania Dutch continued to grow lesser amounts of saffron for local trade and use in their cakes, noodles, and chicken or trout dishes. American saffron cultivation survives into modern times, mainly in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.\nAfghanistan.\nSaffron has a long history in Afghanistan, with cultivation believed to date back to before Alexander the Great's conquest of the Persian Empire. Due to prolonged droughts, conflict, and shifts in agricultural focus, saffron farming declined for centuries. Cultivation resumed in the early 2000s as an alternative to opium poppy farming, supported by international organizations and the Afghan government. According to Afghanistan's Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation, and Livestock, production increased from 20 metric tons in 2022 to 46 metric tons in 2024. Key export markets include India, Europe, and the United States, where Afghan saffron is prized for its high quality.\nSaffron cultivation contributes significantly to Afghanistan's economy, supporting thousands of farmers, particularly women. Over 80% of the saffron workforce consists of women, who primarily handle harvesting and processing. The sector has provided employment opportunities for over 40,000 people, playing a role in agricultural sustainability and rural development.\nAfghan saffron is known for its deep red color, strong aroma, and high crocin content, a compound that determines color intensity. It has been ranked among the highest quality saffron varieties in recent years with a 310 Crocin color quality based on ISO 3632.2 standards.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It occurs in humans and a limited number of other mammals that have a menstruation cycle, notably primates. The tissue most often grows on or around the ovaries and fallopian tubes, on the outside surface of the uterus, or the tissues surrounding the uterus and the ovaries. It can also appear on the bowel, or bladder, or, rarely, on the lungs and skin.\nSymptoms can be very different from person to person, varying in range and intensity. Some have no symptoms, while for others it can be a debilitating disease. Common symptoms include pelvic pain, heavy and painful periods, pain with bowel movements, painful urination, pain during sexual intercourse, and infertility. Besides physical symptoms, endometriosis can affect a person's mental health and social life.\nDiagnosis is usually based on symptoms and medical imaging; however, a definitive diagnosis is made through laparoscopy (keyhole surgery). Other causes of similar symptoms include pelvic inflammatory disease, irritable bowel syndrome, interstitial cystitis, and fibromyalgia. Endometriosis is often misdiagnosed and many patients report being incorrectly told their symptoms are trivial or normal. It usually takes between 5 to 12 years after symptom onset before diagnosis.\nWorldwide, around 10% of the female population of reproductive age (190 million women) are affected by endometriosis. Asian women are more likely than White women to be diagnosed with endometriosis. The exact cause of endometriosis is not known. Possible causes include problems with menstrual period flow, genetic factors, hormones, and problems with the immune system. \nWhile there is no cure for endometriosis, several treatments may improve symptoms. This includes pain medication, hormonal treatments or surgery. The recommended pain medication is usually a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), such as naproxen. Taking the birth control pill continuously or using a hormonal IUD (coil) is another first-line treatment. Other types of hormonal treatment can be tried if the pill or IUD are not effective. Surgical removal of endometriosis may be used to treat those whose symptoms are not manageable with other treatments, or to treat infertility.\nSubtypes.\nEndometriosis can be subdivided into four categories:\nSuperficial peritoneal endometriosis\n Small spots of endometriosis grow on the surface layer that covers the organs inside the abdomen or pelvis (the peritoneum)\nDeep infiltrating endometriosis\n Lesions grow into the tissue beneath the lining of the pelvis or into the muscle layers of pelvic organs like the bowel, bladder, or ureter\nEndometriomas (ovarian)\n Cysts that grow in the ovaries\nExtrapelvic endometriosis\n Lesions outside of the pelvic regions, such as in the lungs or diaphragm\nHealth care providers may call areas of endometriosis by different names, such as implants, lesions, or nodules. Larger lesions may be seen within the ovaries as endometriomas or \"chocolate cysts\"; \"chocolate\" because they contain a thick brownish fluid, mostly old blood.\nEndometriosis most commonly affects the ovaries, the fallopian tubes between the ovaries and the womb, the outer surface of the womb and the tissues that hold the womb in place. Less common pelvic sites are the rectum, bladder, bowel, vulva, vagina and cervix Deep infiltrating endometriosis occurs when endometriosis grows more than 5\u00a0mm beneath the peritoneal surface. It can infiltrate the muscles around organs. The prevalence of deep infiltrating endometriosis is estimated to be 1\u20132% in women of reproductive age. Deep endometriosis often looks like nodules, and can include fibrosis and adhesions.\nRarely, endometriosis appears on the lungs, brain, and skin. Diaphragmatic endometriosis forms almost always on the right hemidiaphragm, and may cause the cyclic pain of the right shoulder or neck during a menstrual period. Scar endometriosis can rarely form on the abdominal wall as a complication of surgery, most often following a ceasarean section or other pelvic surgery.\nSigns and symptoms.\nEndometriosis is often associated with pain and infertility. Some women with endometriosis do not have any symptoms, while for others the pain is life-altering. The amount of pain relates poorly to the anatomical extent of endometriosis. Those with 'minimal' endometriosis may have significant pain, while those with 'severe' endometriosis might have few symptoms.\nThe most frequent symptom of endometriosis is pelvic pain, which includes: \nWomen with endometriosis are about twice as likely to experience infertility compared to other women. Between 16% and 40% of women with endometriosis experience difficulty conceiving. In those going through assisted reproductive treatment, endometriosis is found in about 30% to 50% of women. The World Health Organization estimates that endometriosis is the ultimate cause of female infertility in 4.8% of cases.\nEndometriosis can involve symptoms like constipation, diarrhea, nausea, bloating, rectal or abdominal pain. This is sometimes caused by endometriosis on the bowels, but often due to co-occuring irritable bowel syndrome. People with endometriosis often experience fatigue, which is linked to insomnia, depression and anxiety. \nThoracic endometriosis occurs when endometrium-like tissue implants in the lungs or pleura around the lungs. It is rare. When it occurs in the lungs, common signs and symptoms are blood discharge from the lungs during menstruation and nodules which become bigger during menstruation. When it is found in the pleura, symptoms may be a collapsed lung during or outside of menstruation and bleeding into the pleural space. Further symptoms are a cyclical cough and cyclical shoulder pain. Most often, the endometriosis is found in the right lung. Blood in urine may point to endometriosis in the bladder or in the ureter. Sciatic endometriosis is a rare form in which endometrial tissue involves the sciatic nerve, causing cyclic nerve pain in the leg.\nComplications.\nEndometriosis may be associated with complications during pregnancy. Women with endometriosis have a three-fold increased risk of a placenta previa, in which the placenta partially or completely covers the cervical opening. Preterm delivery was almost 50% more likely. Other complications are stillbirth, gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, and placental abruption.\nCardiovascular disease is also associated with endometriosis, in particular in those who have had a surgical removal of the womb (hysterectomy) and ovaries. Cohort studies have found associations with strokes, heart attacks (myocardial infarction), high blood pressure and arrhythmia. Endometriosis increases the risk of developing ovarian and thyroid cancers compared to women without the condition, and slightly increases the risk of breast cancer.\nDepression and anxiety are more common in endometriosis compared to healthy controls, but occur at the same rate as with other chronic pain conditions. It is unclear how much this is caused by shared underlying mechanisms, the impact of severe symptoms, stigma, the related diagnostic delays or the ineffectiveness of treatment.\nRisk factors.\nGenetics.\nInheritance is significant but not the sole risk factor for endometriosis. Studies attribute 50% of the risk to genetics, the other 50% to environmental factors. Overall, 42 different loci (regions on a chromosome) have been associated with endometriosis risk. The genes linked to endometriosis risk help control cancer-related processes, sex-hormone signals, womb development, molecules related to inflammation and adhesions, and the growth of new blood vessels.\nThere is significant overlap between the genetic basis of endometriosis, other pain conditions and inflammationary conditions. For instance, endometriosis shares a genetic underpinning with migraine and neck, shoulder and back pain. Among inflammatory conditions, it shares variants with asthma and osteoarthritis.\nReproductive and environmental factors.\nGirls whose menstrual outflow is obstructed are at risk of developing endometriosis. This could be because of an imperforate hymen (a birth defect where the vagina is completely blocked), or a double uterus with a blocked hemivagina. Other risk factors are having a first period before age 12, a menstrual cycle of fewer than 28 days, a low BMI, and not having had children.\nLittle is known about environmental risk factors. Night work and red meat consumption seems to raise risk, as does exposure to some classes of environmental pollutants. The most studied of these are endocrine disruptors\u2014chemicals that interfere with hormones, such as estrogen. They include dioxins, phthalates, bisphenol A and polychlorinated biphenyl. Based on epidemiological and experimental data, it is possible exposure to some of them increases the risk of endometriosis.\nAutoimmune and autoinflammatory conditions.\nEndometriosis patients show a significantly increased risk of autoimmune, autoinflammatory, and mixed-pattern psoriatic diseases, with two studies in 2025 pointing to the connection. One of the studies suggested that the chances of receiving a diagnosis of at least one of the autoimmune conditions for those with endometriosis was around twice that of a control cohort. The linked conditions include rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, coeliac disease, osteoarthritis, and psoriasis. This reinforces the view that there is a genetic correlation between endometriosis and osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis (MS), and a potential causal link to rheumatoid arthritis. The work suggests a shared biological basis between endometriosis on one side, and autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases, on the other. This suggests that certain autoimmunne treatment pathways could be repurposed to provided alternative therapy options for those with endometriosis.\nMechanism.\nEndometriosis is an inflammatory disease dependent on estrogen. The lesions promote local inflammation and immune system dysregulation. They also trigger the formation of adhesions (fibrous bands that form between tissues and organs) and fibrosis (excess connective tissue from healing). It is not well understood how endometriosis causes infertility and pain.\nFormation.\nOrigin of endometriosis cells.\nThe main theories for the formation of the endometrium-like tissue outside the womb are backward flow of menstrual blood, metastasis via the lymphatic or the circulatory system and local transformation of peritoneal cells into endometrial-like cells (coelomic metaplasia).\nDuring menstruation, some menstrual blood, tissue, and fluid can flow backward through the fallopian tubes into the pelvic area (the peritoneal cavity). This backward flow (called retrograde menstruation) is thought to be the main reason why endometriosis develops inside the pelvic cavity. However, this explanation alone is not enough, because almost all women have some backward flow of menstrual fluid, but only some of them develop endometriosis.\nEvidence supporting the theory comes from retrospective epidemiological studies and DNA analysis. Furthermore, only animals with a menstrual cycle such as rhesus monkeys and baboons develop endometriosis. In contrast, animals like rodents and non-human primates with an estrous cycle in which the endometrium is reabsorbed rather than shed do not develop the disease.\nEndometriosis has been diagnosed in people who have never experienced menstruation including men, female fetuses, and prepubescent girls. One explanation for endometriosis in girls before puberty is coelomic metaplasia: the theory that certain cells in the peritoneum may undergo metaplasia (transformation) into endometrium-like cells. M\u00fcllerian remnants, cells that normally disappear during male embryonic development, may explain rare cases of endometriosis in men. Metastasis via the lymphatic or the circulatory system may explain endometriosis outside of the pelvic region.\nStem cells may contribute to the formation of endometriosis. Stems cells in the basal layer of the endometrium play a role in renewing the tissue after menstruation. In women with endometriosis, more tissue is shed from this layer during menstruation, allowing more stem cells to flow back into the periteneum with retrograde menstruation, and form lesions. Stem cells from bone marrow may drive the further growth of lesions, and also explain the establishment of endometriosis outside of the pelvic region.\nOther factors.\nMost women with retrograde menstruation do not develop endometriosis, so other factors are needed to explain the formation. For endometriosis to develop, as is done by some cancerous tumors, its cells must evade the immune system, attach to a surface, and promote the formation of new blood vessels. Endometriotic lesions differ in their biochemistry, hormonal response, immunology, and inflammatory response compared to the endometrium. \nOestrogen is needed for the growth of endometriosis lesions. This is produced both by lesions locally and in other parts of the body. Progesterone resistance in lesions make them less responsive to the hormone, and allows the lesions to grow outside of the womb.\nImmune dysfunction could be involved in the disease in various ways: it may lead to a decrease in clearance of endometrial cells outside the womb, a local inflammatory environment may make it more likely that the cells attach to a surface, and may reduce programmed cell death (apoptosis).\nAngiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, plays a key role in the maintenance of endometriotic lesions. Gene expression around angiogenesis expressed in the endometrium of women with endometriosis are different from those without. In addition, cells in the periteneum of women with endometriosis release more growth factors that stimulate angiogenesis.\nPain.\nThere are multiple causes of pain. Endometriosis involves the formation of new blood vessels and nerves in a process known as neuroangiogenesis. The inflammation and fibrosis around the lesions gives rise to nociceptive pain. Neuropathic pain can arise from damage to nerves. In rare cases, endometriosis can infiltrate or compress nerves, and damage to nerves might also occur due to surgery. Estrogens can increase communication between immune cells and nerves in lesions, which may contribute to further pain. Finally, there may be systemic (body-wide) inflammation, involving white blood cells. This can lead to nociplastic pain, which amplifies pain signals and reduces pain inhibition. Nociplastic pain also cause poor sleep, memory problems and fatigue.\nInfertility.\nThe infertility associated with endometriosis likely has multiple causes. Inflammation and hormonal dysfunction explain some instances. The ovarian reserve, the amount of viable egg cells in the ovaries, is typically lower in those with endometriosis. In particular, endometriomas may reduce ovarian reserve in affected ovaries. There is contradictory evidence on whether endometriosis causes reduced ovulation. Anatomical distortions, for instance from adhesions, can explain further instances of infertility, and in severe cases, sperm or egg cells may be fully blocked. Pain during sex may lead couples to avoid it, leading to fewer opportunities for natural conception.\nDiagnosis.\nA health history and a physical examination can lead the health care practitioner to suspect endometriosis. Symptoms in combination with ultrasound or MRI imaging can lead to a presumed diagnosis of endometriosis. The gold standard for definite diagnosis is via surgery and a biopsy, but there is a shift away from requiring surgical confirmation before starting treatment to prevent delays. \nDiagnosis takes an average of five to twelve years from the onset of symptoms. This diagnostic delay has remained persistent. On average, it takes between one and four years before women seek medical help, which might be explained by the normalisation of symptoms, the lack of awareness, and lack of access to healthcare. It then takes up to nine years to get a diagnosis. This delay might be explained by a normalisation of symptoms, lack of expertise and tools, and general inefficiencies in healthcare.\nEndometriosis can be classified into four different stages. The American Society of Reproductive Medicine's scale, revised in 1996, gives higher scores to deep, thick lesions or intrusions on the ovaries and dense, enveloping adhesions on the ovaries or fallopian tubes.\nPhysical examination.\nA trauma-informed framework is recommended for a physical examination, where the health practitioner validates pain and fosters trust. The examination focuses on assessing both general symptoms and those linked to deep endometriosis or endometriosis outside the pelvis. Risk factors are also reviewed. The physical examination can include an abdominal exam, a single digit exam of the vagina and pelvic floor, a bimanual exam and examination with a speculum.\nUltrasound.\nVaginal ultrasound can be used to diagnose endometriosis or to localize an endometrioma before surgery. This can be used to identify the spread of disease in individuals with well-established clinical suspicion of endometriosis. Vaginal ultrasound is inexpensive, easily accessible, has no contraindications, and requires no preparation. By extending the ultrasound assessment into the posterior and anterior pelvic compartments, a sonographer can evaluate structural mobility and look for deep infiltrating endometriotic nodules. Better sonographic detection of deep infiltrating endometriosis could reduce the number of diagnostic laparoscopies, as well as guide disease management and enhance patient quality of life.\nUltrasounds cannot be used to exclude a diagnosis of endometriosis. If a transvaginal ultrasound is not suitable or declined, an alternative is an ultrasound via the lower abdomen.\nMagnetic resonance imaging.\nMRI is another means of detecting lesions in a non-invasive manner. MRI is not widely used due to its cost and limited availability. It can reliably detect endometriomas and deep infiltrating endemetriosis. It is sometimes used for planning surgery, for instance if an ultrasound is unclear, or for diagnosis if a transvaginal ultrasound is not appropriate or is declined. The field of view is larger in an MRI compared to an ultrasound, which allows a larger part of the bowel to be assessed.\nLaparoscopy.\nLaparoscopy (keyhole surgery) is a surgical procedure where a camera is used to look inside the abdominal cavity. Laparoscopy with a biopsy is the most accurate way to diagnose endometriosis. It can be used when endometriosis is suspected, but not visible via medical imaging. An alternative after negative imaging is to try out treatment and give a presumed diagnosis if that improves symptoms ('empirical treatment').\nSurgery for diagnosis also allows for surgical treatment of endometriosis at the same time. In nearly 40% of cases, no cause for pelvic pain is discovered during laparoscopy.\nThe lesions of superficial endometriosis often appear dark blue or black. In the earlier stages of disease, they may be white, red or yellow-brown. Ovarian cysts are typically dark brown. Adhesions are made up of fibrous scar tissue. Deep endometriosis looks like multiple distinct nodules.\nA biopsy may be negative even when endometriosis is present, particularly in younger women. As such, it cannot be used to exclude a diagnosis of endometriosis. For confirmation, biopsy samples should show at least two of the following features:\nStages.\nThere are three staging or classification systems commonly used. Fertility is assessed with the Endometriosis Fertility Index (EFI). Endometriosis can be classified as stage I\u2013IV by the revised American Society of Reproductive Medicine (rASRM) staging system. The stages range from minimal (stage I) to severe (stage IV). The scale uses a point system that assesses lesions and adhesions during surgery. The ENZIAN system focuses more on deep endometriosis compared to rASRM. The rASRM and ENZIAN systems correlate poorly with how much pain women have.\nThe American Association of Gynecologic Laparoscopists (AAGL) endometriosis staging system, introduced in 2021, was designed to correlate well with complexity of surgery. Like rASRM, it divides endometriosis into four stages.\nPrevention.\nAccording to the World Health Organization, there is no known way to prevent endometriosis. There are associations between some risk factors and endometriosis: women with endometriosis tend to consume more red meat, trans fats, alcohol and caffeine. Physical activity does not seem to prevent endometriosis, but can lessen pain. It is unclear whether these links are causative.\nManagement.\nWhile there is no cure for endometriosis, there are treatments for pain and endometriosis-associated infertility. Pain can be treated with hormones, painkillers, or, in severe cases, surgery. The goal of management is to provide pain relief, to restrict the progression of the process, and to restore or preserve fertility where needed.\nTreatment with medication for pain management can be initiated based on the presence of symptoms, examination, and ultrasound findings that rule out other potential causes. The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends starting initial medication for those with suspected endometriosis, at the same time as referral for investigations such as ultrasound.\nIn general, the diagnosis of endometriosis is confirmed during surgery, at which time removal can be performed. Further steps depend on circumstances: someone without infertility can manage symptoms with pain medication and hormonal medication that suppresses the natural cycle, while an infertile individual may be treated expectantly after surgery, with fertility medication, or with in vitro fertilisation (IVF).\nHormonal medications.\nProgestin-only hormonal suppression (progestogen) is another first-line therapy. It come in different forms and includes the hormonal coil (intrauterine device), the oral dienogest, an injection of medroxyprogesterone acetate every three months or an implant under the skin. Dienogest, which may better than injections, is not available on its own in the US. Oral progestins likely reduce overall pain and period pain compared to placebo, and may also help with pelvic pain. It is unclear how well they work compared to other hormonal therapies.\nHormonal birth control pills: combined estrogren-progestin birth control pills are a first-line treatment. The recommendation is to use the pills continuously to stop periods. A 2018 Cochrane systematic review found that there is insufficient evidence to make a judgement on the effectiveness of the combined oral contraceptive pill compared with placebo or other medical treatment for managing pain associated with endometriosis partly because of lack of included studies for data analysis (only two for COCP vs placebo).\nGonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) modulators are second-line treatments: These drugs include GnRH agonists such as leuprorelin, and GnRH antagonists such as elagolix and decrease estrogen levels. GnRH agonists mimic the effects of menopause, and seem more effective than placebo or oral progestin at reducing pain. They come with side effects of hot flashes and decreased bone density. GnRHs can be prescribed with hormonal 'add-back' therapy or with calcium-regulating agents to reduce the amount of bone loss.\nAromatase inhibitors are third-line treatments and block estrogen production throughout the body. Examples of aromatase inhibitors include anastrozole and letrozole. Common side effects are hot flashes, night sweats and functional cysts. In premenopausal women, these should be taken with other hormones (such as the combined pill) to prevent ovarian stimulation and to prevent menopause symptoms. They can be a option for post-menopausal women who still have endometriosis symptoms, as their action is not limited to suppressing estrogen from ovaries. Evidence is limited.\nProgesterone receptor modulators like mifepristone and gestrinone have the potential (based on only one randomized controlled trial each) to be used as a treatment to manage pain caused by endometriosis.\nPain medication.\nNSAIDs like naproxen are anti-inflammatory medications commonly used for endometriosis pain. Evidence for their effectiveness is limited, with only one small study conducted. NSAIDs can have side effects, predominantly gastrointestinal, but they are generally safe to try.\nSurgery.\nClinical guidelines recommend surgery when medical treatment does not work sufficiently, has unacceptable side effects or is contraindicated. Large endometriomas can only effectively be treated with surgery. Surgery is also recommended when deep endometriosis causes problems in the bowels or urinary tract, such as obstruction. It is unclear what the effect of surgery is for pain relief in cases of superficial periteneal endometriosis.\nLaparoscopy (keyhole surgery) is the standard surgical approach. Treatment consists of the removal of endometriosis and the restoration of pelvic anatomy via the division of adhesions. The removal takes place via excision (cutting out) or electrosurgery (coagulation or ablation/vaporisation). With laparoscopic surgery, small instruments are inserted through incisions to remove the endometriosis tissue and adhesions. After surgery, people can usually return home the same day.\nTwo literature reviews have compared excision to ablation. A 2017 literature review found that excision improved some outcomes over ablation for endometriosis in general. A 2021 literature review on minimal to mild endometriosis found no difference. For deep endometriosis, excision is the standard therapy, as ablation does not allow the surgeon to see if all endometriosis is removed. In the United States, some specialists trained in excision for endometriosis do not accept health insurance because insurance companies do not reimburse the higher costs of this procedure over ablation.\nEndometriomas are usually excised (removed completely). Compared to drainage and coagulation of the cyst, excision makes it less likely the cysts and pain symptoms come back. However, excision may damage fertility, as it can affect the ovarian reserve, the amount of egg cells that can be fertilised.\nFor deep endometriosis, surgery improves quality of life and pain symptoms. However, the procedure can be complicated, especially if the lesions are in or near the bowel, ureter of the urinary system or the chest, and requires a interdisciplinary surgical team in those cases. For instance, for rectovaginal endometriosis, 7% of surgeries had complications. Sometimes, a part of the bowel or bladder is removed.\nFor women who still have significant pain after hormonal treatment and other surgery, and do not want to become pregnant, a hysterectomy (removal of the womb) can be offered. This is done in combination with removal of endometriosis lesions. Removal of the womb may be beneficial if the uterus itself is affected by adenomyosis. When the ovaries are removed too, women will experience early menopause and may need hormone replacement therapy. Removal of the ovaries comes with cardiovascular, metabolic and mental health risks.\nRecurrence and postoperative hormonal suppression.\nIn an analysis with a medium follow-up of 24 months pain after surgery recurred in about 16% of women. Endometriosis recurrence following surgery is estimated as 21.5% at 2 years and 40\u201350% at 5 years. Hormonal therapy before surgery has little effect on recurrence, but treatment afterwards reduces the risk. At a median follow-up of 18 months, endometriosis recurred in 26% of women without postoperative hormonal suppression, compared with 10% of women who received it. The risk of recurrence is higher in younger women and in those with a less aggressive surgery.\nComparison of interventions.\nA 2021 meta-analysis found that GnRH analogs and combined hormonal contraceptives were the best treatment for reducing dyspareunia and menstrual and non-menstrual pelvic pain. A 2018 Swedish systematic review found several studies but a general lack of scientific evidence for most treatments. There was only one study of sufficient quality and relevance comparing the effect of surgery and non-surgery. Cohort studies indicate that surgery is effective in decreasing pain. Most complications occurred in cases of low intestinal anastomosis, while the risk of fistula occurred in cases of combined abdominal or vaginal surgery, and urinary tract problems were common in intestinal surgery. The evidence was found to be insufficient regarding surgical intervention.\nThe advantages of physical therapy techniques are decreased cost, absence of major side effects, it does not interfere with fertility, and a near-universal increase in sexual function. Disadvantages are that there are no large or long-term studies of its use for treating pain or infertility related to endometriosis.\nTreatment of infertility.\nInfertility can be treated with assistive reproductive technology (ART) such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) or surgery. IVF procedures are effective in improving fertility in many individuals with endometriosis. IVF is increasingly recommended over surgery for older women or for those where there might be multiple reasons why they struggle to conceive. It does not increase recurrence of endometriosis. The Endometriosis Fertility Index can help guide decisions on treatment of infertility. Surgery is typically not recommended before starting ART.\nIn terms of surgery, endometriomas can be cut out (a cystectomy), or drained and destroyed (ablation). The ablation technique may be better able to preserve the number of remaining viable eggs (the ovarian reserve), compared to cutting out the endometrioma. On the other hand, cutting out the endometrioma may help more with pain. Surgery likely also helps with infertility in the case of superficial peritoneal endometriosis. Receiving hormonal suppression therapy after surgery might be help with endometriosis recurrence and pregnancy. but evidence for pregnancy outcomes is mixed and the both NICE and the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology recommend against hormonal suppression to improve fertility.\nPrognosis.\nEndometriosis is often a long-term condition, with symptoms typically emerging during adolescence and easing after menopause. For some women, pain persists after menopause. Treatments, whether medical or surgical, can alleviate symptoms but do not provide a definitive cure. The disease does not always worsen over time; in repeat surgeries, endometriosis became worse in 29%, improved in 42% and stayed the same in 29%. \nThe likelihood of symptoms returning after surgery is highly variable, with studies reporting recurrence rates anywhere between 6% and 67%. For some, endometriosis becomes associated with persistent, complex pain, possibly linked to changes in the nervous system, as part of a constellation of chronic pain disorders.\nEpidemiology.\nEndometriosis is commonly reported to affect approximately 10% of women of reproductive age. Worldwide, an estimated 176\u2013190 million girls and women are affected, with around 22 million having a diagnosis confirmed surgically as of 2021. It is diffucult to determine an exact prevalence, given the large delays in diagnosis and the need for a surgical confirmation for a definite diagnosis. The prevalence depends on the population studied and the way endometriosis is diagnosed (imaging, surgery). Of women with pelvic pain undergoing laparoscopy, 28% are diagnosed with endometriosis. Of those with infertility undergoing laparoscopy, 25% are diagnosed.\nIt is most diagnosed when women are in their 30s, but symptoms typically start in early 20s or in adolescence. People can develop endometriosis symptoms before their first period and in menopause too. Ethnic differences in endometriosis have been observed. The condition is more common in women of East Asian and Southeast Asian descent than in White women.\nHistory.\nThe earliest references to what is now known as endometriosis might be from Ancient Egypt, nearly 4,000 years ago. In Ancient Greece, the Hippocratic Corpus outlines symptoms similar to endometriosis, including uterine ulcers, adhesions, and infertility. Dioscorides, a prominent physician of the time, described 'strangulation of the uterus', associated with pelvic pain and sometimes leading to collapse. He regarded menstrual pain as organic. Women with dysmenorrhea were encouraged to marry and have children at a young age. \nDuring the Middle Ages, there was a shift into believing that women with pelvic pain were mad, immoral, imagining the pain, or simply misbehaving. The symptoms of inexplicable chronic pelvic pain were often attributed to imagined madness, female weakness, promiscuity, or hysteria.\nEndometriosis and adenomyosis were first discovered microscopically by Carl von Rokitansky in 1860. They were initially considered one disease called adenomyoma. The theory of retrograde menstruation as a cause of endometriosis was first proposed by John A. Sampson. \nThe early treatment of endometriosis was surgical and included oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries) and hysterectomy (removal of the uterus). In the 1940s, the only available hormonal therapies for endometriosis were high-dose testosterone and high-dose estrogen therapy. High-dose estrogen therapy with diethylstilbestrol for endometriosis was first reported by Karnaky in 1948 and was the main pharmacological treatment for the condition in the early 1950s. Pseudopregnancy (high-dose estrogen\u2013progestogen therapy) for endometriosis was first described by Kistner in the late 1950s. Pseudopregnancy, as well as progestogen monotherapy, dominated the treatment of endometriosis in the 1960s and 1970s. These agents, although efficacious, were associated with intolerable side effects. Danazol was first described for endometriosis in 1971 and became the main therapy in the 1970s and 1980s. \nIn the 1980s, GnRH agonists gained prominence for the treatment of endometriosis and by the 1990s had become the most widely used therapy. Oral GnRH antagonists such as elagolix were introduced for the treatment of endometriosis in 2018.\nSociety and culture.\nPublic figures.\nSeveral public figures have spoken about their experience with endometriosis, including:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nEconomic burden.\nThe economic burden of endometriosis is widespread and multifaceted. Endometriosis is a chronic disease that has direct and indirect costs, which include loss of work days, direct costs of treatment, symptom management, and treatment of other associated conditions such as depression or chronic pain. One factor that seems to be associated with especially high costs is the delay between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis.\nCosts vary greatly between countries. Two factors that contribute to the economic burden include healthcare costs and losses in productivity. A Swedish study of 400 endometriosis patients found \"Absence from work was reported by 32% of the women, while 36% reported reduced time at work because of endometriosis\". An additional cross sectional study with Puerto Rican women, \"found that endometriosis-related and coexisting symptoms disrupted all aspects of women's daily lives, including physical limitations that affected doing household chores and paid employment. The majority of women (85%) experienced a decrease in the quality of their work; 20% reported being unable to work because of pain, and over two-thirds of the sample continued to work despite their pain.\" A study published in the UK in 2025 found that after women received a diagnosis of endometriosis in an English NHS hospital their earnings were on average \u00a356 per month less in the four to five years after diagnosis than they were in the two years before. There was also a reduction in the proportion of women in employment.\nMedical culture.\nThere are many barriers that those affected face in receiving a diagnosis and treatment for endometriosis. Some of these include outdated standards for laparoscopic evaluation, stigma about discussing menstruation and sex, lack of understanding of the disease, primary-care physicians' lack of knowledge, and assumptions about typical menstrual pain. On average, those later diagnosed with endometriosis waited 2.3 years after the onset of symptoms before seeking treatment, and nearly three-quarters of women receive a misdiagnosis before endometriosis. Self-help groups say practitioners delay making the diagnosis, often because they do not consider it a possibility. There is a typical delay of 7\u201312 years from symptom onset in affected individuals to professional diagnosis. There is a general lack of knowledge about endometriosis among primary care physicians. Half of the general health care providers surveyed in a 2013 study could not name three symptoms of endometriosis. Healthcare providers are also likely to dismiss described symptoms as normal menstruation. Younger patients may also feel uncomfortable discussing symptoms with a physician. Patients are made to categorise their pain using the pain scale. However, this is not representative of endometriosis specific pain levels which impacts diagnosis and treatment.\nRace and ethnicity.\nRace and ethnicity may impact how endometriosis affects one's life. Endometriosis is less thoroughly studied among Black people, and the research that has been done is outdated.\nCultural differences among ethnic groups also contribute to attitudes toward and treatment of endometriosis, especially in Hispanic or Latino communities. A study done in Puerto Rico in 2020 found that health care and interactions with friends and family related to discussing endometriosis were affected by stigma. The most common finding was a referral to those expressing pain related to endometriosis as \"changuer\u00eda\" or \"changas\", terms used in Puerto Rico to describe pointless whining and complaining, often directed at children.\nStigma.\nThe existing stigma surrounding women's health, specifically endometriosis, can lead to patients not seeking diagnoses, lower quality of healthcare, increased barriers to care and treatment, and negative reception from members of society. Additionally, menstrual stigma significantly contributes to the broader issue of endometriosis stigma, creating an interconnected challenge that extends beyond reproductive health.\nWidespread awareness campaigns, developments, and implementations aimed at multilevel anti-stigma organizational and structural changes, as well as more qualitative studies of the endometriosis stigma, help to overcome the harm of the phenomenon.\nResearch directions.\nA priority area of research is the search for endometriosis biomarkers, which can help with earlier diagnoses. Studies have examined potential biomarkers such as microRNAs, glycoproteins, and immune markers in blood, menstrual and urine samples, but none have shown the high accurarcy needed for clinical use yet. CA-125, a tumor marker, has been studied extensively. It is elevated in endometriosis, but also in many other conditions, and cannot be used on its own. MicroRNAs might be most promosing, but the high diversity in expression makes them a challenging target.\nMedical management of endometriosis is typically based on hormonal therapy, but these treatments can produce undesirable side effects, driving the search for alternatives. Emerging strategies target endometriosis as an inflammatory, metabolic, or pain disorder. Anti-inflammatory approaches include anakinra, a drug used in rheumatoid arthritis. Pain-focused treatments under investigation include cannabinoid extracts, migraine medications, and therapies directed at affected nerves. Additionally, the cancer drug dichloroacetic acid is being explored for its potential metabolic effects in endometriosis.\nReferences.\nCited sources.\n\"This article incorporates text in the public domain as a Swedish government \"utterance\" by https://\""}

He agreed with Cyprian of Carthage that those who had lapsed could be restored to communion after varying forms of Reinitiation and Penance. This position was in contrast to the Novatianists, who held that those who failed to maintain their confession of faith under persecution would not be received again into communion with the church. This resulted in a short-lived schism in the Church of Rome that spread as each side sought to gather support. Cornelius held a synod that confirmed his election and excommunicated Novatian, but the controversy regarding lapsed members continued for years.\nThe persecutions resumed in 251 under Emperor Trebonianus Gallus. Cornelius was sent into exile and may have died from the rigours of his banishment; possibly he was beheaded.\nChristian persecution.\nEmperor Decius, who ruled from 249 to 251, persecuted Christians in the Roman Empire rather sporadically and locally, but starting in January of the year 250, he ordered all citizens to perform a religious sacrifice in the presence of commissioners, or else face death. Many Christians refused and were martyred, (including Pope Fabian on 20 January 250), while others partook in the sacrifices in order to save their own lives.\nTwo schools of thought arose after the persecution. One side, led by Novatian, a priest in the diocese of Rome, said those who had stopped practising Christianity during the persecution could not be accepted back into the church, even if they repented. He held that idolatry was an unpardonable sin, and that the Church had no authority to forgive apostates, but that their forgiveness must be left to God; it could not be pronounced in this world. The opposing side, including Cornelius and Cyprian of Carthage, said the \"lapsi\" could be restored to communion through repentance, demonstrated by a period of penance.\nDuring the persecution it proved impossible to elect a successor, and the papal seat remained vacant for a year. During this period the church was governed by several priests, including Novatian. When Decius left Rome to fight the invading Goths, the Roman clergy chose a new bishop. In the fourteen months without a pope, the leading candidate, Moses, had died under the persecution. The more moderate Cornelius was unwillingly elected over Novatian and others as the twenty-first pope in March 251.\nPapacy.\nThose who supported a more rigorist position had Novatian consecrated bishop and refused to recognize Cornelius as Bishop of Rome. Both sides sent out letters to other bishops seeking recognition and support. Cornelius had the support of Cyprian, Dionysius, and most African and Eastern bishops while Novatian had the support of a minority of clergy and laymen in Rome. Cornelius's next action was to convene a synod of 60 bishops to acknowledge him as the rightful pope and the council excommunicated Novatian as well as all Novatianists. Also addressed in the synod was that Christians who stopped practising during Emperor Decius's persecution could be re-admitted into the Christian community only after doing penance.\nThe verdict of the synod was sent to the Christian bishops, most notably the bishop of Antioch, a fierce Novatian supporter, in order to convince him to accept Cornelius as bishop of Rome. The letters that Cornelius sent to surrounding bishops provide information of the size of the church in Rome at that time. Cornelius mentions that the Roman Church had, \"forty six priests, seven deacons, seven sub-deacons, forty two acolytes, fifty two ostiarii, and over one thousand five hundred widows and persons in distress.\" His letters also inform that Cornelius had a staff of over 150 clergy members and the church fed over 1,500 people daily. From these numbers, it has been estimated that there were at least 50,000 Christians in Rome during the papacy of Pope Cornelius.\nDeath and letters.\nIn June 251, Decius was killed in battle with the Goths; and persecutions resumed under his successor, Trebonianus Gallus. Cornelius was exiled to Centumcellae, Italy, where he died in June 253. The Liberian catalogue ascribes his death to the hardships of banishment; later sources say he was beheaded. He was entombed in a catacomb near the chapel of the popes, behind a Latin inscription, not Greek like his predecessor Pope Fabian and successor Lucius I. It translates to \"Cornelius Martyr\". The letters he sent while in exile are all written in the colloquial Latin of the period instead of the classical style used by the educated such as Cyprian, a theologian as well as a bishop, and Novatian, who was also a philosopher. This suggests that Cornelius came from a financially average family and thus was given an ordinary education as a child. One letter mentions an office of \"exorcist\" in the church for the first time.\nVeneration.\nSome of his relics were taken to Germany during the Middle Ages; his head was claimed by Kornelim\u00fcnster Abbey near Aachen.\nIn the Rhineland, he was also a patron saint of lovers. A legend associated with Cornelius tells of a young artist who was commissioned to decorate the Corneliuskapelle in the Selikum quarter of Neuss. The daughter of a local townsman fell in love with the artist, but her father forbade the marriage, remarking that he would only consent if the pope did as well. Miraculously, the statue of Cornelius leaned forward from the altar and blessed the pair, and the two lovers were thus married.\nCornelius, along with Quirinus of Neuss, Hubertus and Anthony the Great, was venerated as one of the Four Holy Marshals in the Rhineland during the late Middle Ages.\nA legend told at Carnac states that its stones were once pagan soldiers who had been turned into stone by Cornelius, who was fleeing from them.\nThe Catholic Church commemorated Cornelius by venerating him, with his Saint's Day on 16 September, which he shares with his friend Cyprian. His Saint's Day was originally on 14 September, the date on which both Cyprian and Cornelius were martyred, according to Jerome. Cornelius's saintly name means \"battle horn\", and he is represented in icons by a pope either holding some form of cow's horn or with a cow nearby. He is the patron against earache, epilepsy, fever, twitching, and also of cattle, domestic animals, earache sufferers, epileptics, and the town of Kornelim\u00fcnster, Germany, where his head is enshrined.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "53338", "revid": "28481209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53338", "title": "Cervical cancer", "text": "Cancer arising from the cervix\nMedical condition&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Infobox/styles-images.css\" /&gt;\nCervical cancer is a type of cancer that develops in the cervix or in any layer of the wall of the cervix. It is due to the abnormal growth of cells that can invade or spread to other parts of the body. Early on, typically no symptoms are seen. Later symptoms may include abnormal vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain or pain during sexual intercourse. While bleeding after sex may not be serious, it may also indicate the presence of cervical cancer.\nVirtually all cervical cancer cases (99%) are linked to genital human papillomavirus infection (HPV); most who have had HPV infections, however, do not develop cervical cancer. HPV 16 and 18 strains are responsible for approximately 70% of cervical cancer cases globally and nearly 50% of high-grade cervical pre-cancers. Minor risk factors include smoking, a weak immune system, birth control pills, starting sex at a young age, and having many sexual partners. Genetic factors also contribute to cervical cancer risk. Cervical cancer typically develops from precancerous changes called cervical intraepithelial neoplasia over 10 to 20 years. About 75% of cervical cancers are squamous cell carcinomas, 20-25% are adenocarcinoma, 3% are adenosquamous carcinomas, and less than 1% are small cell neuroendocrine tumors of the cervix. Diagnosis is typically by cervical screening followed by a biopsy. Medical imaging is then done to determine whether or not the cancer has spread beyond the cervix.\nHPV vaccination is the most cost-effective public health measure against cervical cancer. There are six licensed HPV vaccines. They protect against two to seven high-risk strains of this family of viruses. They may prevent up to 90% of cervical cancers. By the end of 2023, 143 countries (74% of WHO member states) provided the HPV vaccine in their national immunization schedule for girls. As of 2022, 47 countries (24% of WHO member states) also did it for boys.654 As a risk of cancer still exists, guidelines recommend continuing regular Pap tests. Other methods of prevention include having few or no sexual partners and the use of condoms. Cervical cancer screening using the Pap test or acetic acid can identify precancerous changes, which when treated, can prevent the development of cancer. Treatment may consist of some combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. Five-year survival rates in the United States are 68%. Outcomes, however, depend very much on how early the cancer is detected.\nWorldwide, cervical cancer is both the fourth-most common type of cancer and the fourth-most common cause of death from cancer in women, with over 660,000 new cases and around 350,000 deaths in 2022. This is about 8% of the total cases and total deaths from cancer. 88% (2020 figure) of cervical cancers and 90% of deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries and 2% (2020 figure) in high-income countries.650 Of the 20 hardest hit countries by cervical cancer, 19 are in Africa. In low-income countries, it is one of the most common causes of cancer death with an incidence rate of 47.3 per 100,000 women. In developed countries, the widespread use of cervical screening programs has dramatically reduced rates of cervical cancer. Expected scenarios for the reduction of mortality due to cervical cancer worldwide (and specially in low-income countries) have been reviewed, given assumptions with respect to the achievement of recommended prevention targets using triple-intervention strategies defined by WHO. In medical research, the most famous immortalized cell line, known as HeLa, was developed from cervical cancer cells of a woman named Henrietta Lacks.\n17 November is the Cervical Cancer Elimination Day of Action. The date marks the day in 2020 when WHO launched the Global strategy to accelerate the elimination of cervical cancer as a public health problem, with a resolution passed by 194 countries. To eliminate cervical cancer, all countries must reach and maintain an incidence rate of below 4 per 100 000 women.\nSigns and symptoms.\nThe early stages of cervical cancer may be completely free of symptoms. Vaginal bleeding, contact bleeding (one most common form being bleeding after sexual intercourse), or (rarely) a vaginal mass may indicate the presence of cervical cancer. Also, moderate pain during sexual intercourse and vaginal discharge are symptoms of cervical cancer. Bleeding after douching or after a pelvic exam is a common symptom of cervical cancer. In advanced disease, metastases may be present in the abdomen, lungs, or elsewhere.\nSymptoms of advanced cervical cancer may include loss of appetite, weight loss, fatigue, pelvic pain, back pain, leg pain, swollen legs, heavy vaginal bleeding, bone fractures, and (rarely) leakage of urine or faeces from the vagina. Other signs of locally advanced disease (as the cancer invades organs in the pelvis) include hydronephrosis with flank pain as the ureters directing urine from the kidneys to bladder are blocked, leg swelling and blood clots in the legs as pelvic veins are blocked, rectal bleeding, and bleeding in the urine.\nCauses.\nInfection with some types of HPV is the greatest risk factor for cervical cancer, followed by smoking. HIV infection is also a risk factor. Not all of the causes of cervical cancer are known, however, and several other contributing factors have been implicated.\nHuman papillomavirus.\nInfection with HPV is thought to be required for cervical cancer to occur. HPV types 16 and 18 are the cause of 75% of cervical cancer cases globally, while 31 and 45 are the causes of another 10%.\nWomen who have multiple sexual partners, or have partners who have multiple sexual partners, regardless of sex, are at higher risk of cervical cancer.\nOver 200 types of HPV known, 12 are classified as high-risk types (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, and 59), three as probable high-risk (26, 53, and 66), and 12 as low-risk (6, 11, 40, 42, 43, 44, 54, 61, 70, 72, 81, and CP6108). Most cases of squamous cell carcinomas of the cervix are due to HPV type 16 and most cases of adenocarcinoma are due to HPV type 18. High risk HPV viral subtypes can integrate their DNA into the host genome and induce transcription of the viral cancer causing proteins E6 and E7. E6 degrades the tumor suppressing protein p53 and E7 degrades and inactivates the tumor suppressing protein pRb. The loss of p53 and pRb leads to increased blood vessel growth feeding tumors (via vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF) over-expression), loss of tumor cell suppression and cell cycle regulation disruptions, all of which can lead to cervical cancer.\nGenital warts, which are a form of benign tumor of epithelial cells, are also caused by various strains of HPV. However, these serotypes are usually not related to cervical cancer. Having multiple strains at the same time is common, including those that can cause cervical cancer along with those that cause warts.\nSmoking.\nCigarette smoking, both active and passive, increases the risk of cervical cancer. Among HPV-infected women, current and former smokers have roughly two to three times the incidence of invasive cancer. Passive smoking is also associated with increased risk, but to a lesser extent.\nSmoking has also been linked to the development of cervical cancer. Smoking can increase the risk in women a few different ways, which can be by direct and indirect methods of inducing cervical cancer. A direct way of contracting this cancer is that someone who smokes has a higher chance of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN3) occurring, which has the potential of forming cervical cancer. When CIN3 lesions lead to cancer, most of them have the assistance of the HPV virus, but that is not always the case, which is why it can be considered a direct link to cervical cancer. Heavy smoking and long-term smoking seem to have a higher risk of getting the CIN3 lesions than lighter smoking or not smoking at all. Although smoking has been linked to cervical cancer, it aids in the development of HPV, which is the leading cause of this type of cancer. Also, not only does it aid in the development of HPV, but also if the woman is already HPV-positive, she is at an even greater likelihood of contracting cervical cancer.\nOral contraceptives.\nLong-term use of oral contraceptives is associated with increased risk of cervical cancer in women who have had HPV. Women who have used oral contraceptives for 5 to 9 years have about three times the incidence of invasive cancer, and those who used them for 10 years or longer have about four times the risk.\nMultiple pregnancies.\nHaving many pregnancies is associated with an increased risk of cervical cancer. Among HPV-infected women, those who have had seven or more full-term pregnancies have around four times the risk of cancer compared with women with no pregnancies, and two to three times the risk of women who have had one or two full-term pregnancies.\nDiagnosis.\nBiopsy.\nThe Pap test can be used as a screening test, but it produces a false negative in up to 50% of cases of cervical cancer. Another concern is the cost of doing Pap tests, which makes them unaffordable in many areas of the world.\nConfirmation of the diagnosis of cervical cancer or precancer requires a biopsy of the cervix. This is often done through colposcopy, a magnified visual inspection of the cervix aided by using a dilute acetic acid (e.g. vinegar) solution to highlight abnormal cells on the surface of the cervix, with visual contrast provided by staining the normal tissues a mahogany brown with Lugol's iodine. Medical devices used for biopsy of the cervix include punch forceps. Colposcopic impression, the estimate of disease severity based on the visual inspection, forms part of the diagnosis. Further diagnostic and treatment procedures are loop electrical excision procedure and cervical conization, in which the inner lining of the cervix is removed to be examined pathologically. These are carried out if the biopsy confirms severe cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.\nOften, before the biopsy, the doctor asks for medical imaging to rule out other causes of a woman's symptoms. Imaging modalities such as ultrasound, CT scan, and MRI have been used to look for alternative disease, spread of the tumor, and effect on adjacent structures. Typically, they appear as heterogeneous masses on the cervix.\nInterventions such as playing music during the procedure and viewing the procedure on a monitor can reduce the anxiety associated with the examination.\nPrecancerous lesions.\nCervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) means the development of abnormal cells on the surface of the cervix. HPV infections cause CIN, but in most cases, it is resolved by the immune system. However, a small percentage of people might develop a more serious CIN, which, if left untreated, can develop into cervical cancer. CIN is often diagnosed during routine Pap smear examination or colposcopy.\nThe naming and histologic classification of cervical carcinoma precursor lesions has changed many times over the 20th century. The World Health Organization classification system was descriptive of the lesions, naming them mild, moderate, or severe dysplasia or carcinoma \"in situ\" (CIS). The term cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) was developed to place emphasis on the spectrum of abnormality in these lesions and to help standardize treatment. For premalignant dysplastic changes, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grading (CIN 1\u20133) is used. It classifies mild dysplasia as CIN1, moderate dysplasia as CIN2, and severe dysplasia and CIS as CIN3. More recently, CIN2 and CIN3 have been combined into CIN2/3. These results are what a pathologist might report from a biopsy.\nThese should not be confused with the Bethesda system terms for Pap test (cytopathology) results. Among the Bethesda results: Low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL). An LSIL Pap may correspond to CIN1, and HSIL may correspond to CIN2 and CIN3, but they are results of different tests, and the Pap test results need not match the histologic findings.\nCancer subtypes.\nHistologic subtypes of invasive cervical carcinoma include:\nThough squamous cell carcinoma is the cervical cancer with the highest incidence, the incidence of adenocarcinoma of the cervix has been increasing in recent decades. Endocervical adenocarcinoma represents 20\u201325% of the histological types of cervical carcinoma. Gastric-type mucinous adenocarcinoma of the cervix is a rare type of cancer with aggressive behavior. This type of malignancy is not related to high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV).\nNoncarcinoma malignancies, which can rarely occur in the cervix, include melanoma and lymphoma. The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage does not incorporate lymph node involvement in contrast to the TNM staging for most other cancers. For cases treated surgically, information obtained from the pathologist can be used in assigning a separate pathologic stage, but is not to replace the original clinical stage.\nStaging.\nCervical cancer is staged by the FIGO system, which is based on clinical examination rather than surgical findings. Before the 2018 revisions to FIGO staging, the system allowed only these diagnostic tests to be used in determining the stage: palpation, inspection, colposcopy, endocervical curettage, hysteroscopy, cystoscopy, proctoscopy, intravenous urography, and X-ray examination of the lungs and skeleton, and cervical conization. However, the system allows the use of any imaging or pathological methods for staging.\nPrevention.\nScreening.\nChecking cervical cells with the Papanicolaou test (Pap test) for cervical pre-cancer has dramatically reduced the number of cases of, and mortality from, cervical cancer. Liquid-based cytology may reduce the number of inadequate samples. Pap test screening every three to five years with appropriate follow-up can reduce cervical cancer incidence up to 80%.\nPap test screening can reveal abnormal cells on the surface of the cervix called cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), which in a small percentage can develop into cervical cancer. These precancerous changes can be confirmed with further examination known as colposcopy.\nPersonal invitations encouraging women to get screened are effective at increasing the likelihood that they will do so. Educational materials also help increase the likelihood that women will go for screening, but they are not as effective as invitations.\nAccording to the 2010 European guidelines, the age at which to start screening ranges between 20 and 30 years of age, but preferentially not before age 25 or 30 years, and depends on the burden of the disease in the population and the available resources.\nIn the United States, screening is recommended to begin at age 21, regardless of the age at which a woman began having sex or other risk factors. Pap tests should be done every three years between the ages of 21 and 65. In women over the age of 65, screening may be discontinued if no abnormal screening results were seen within the previous 10 years and no history of CIN2 or higher exists. HPV vaccination status does not change screening rates.\nA number of recommended options exist for screening those 30 to 65. This includes cervical cytology every 3 years, HPV testing every 5 years, or HPV testing together with cytology every 5 years. Screening is not beneficial before age 25, as the rate of disease is low. Screening is not beneficial in women older than 60 years if they have a history of negative results. The American Society of Clinical Oncology guideline has recommend for different levels of resource availability.\nPap tests have not been as effective in developing countries. This is in part because many of these countries have an impoverished health care infrastructure, too few trained and skilled professionals to obtain and interpret Pap tests, uninformed women who get lost to follow-up, and a lengthy turn-around time to get results. Visual inspection with acetic acid and HPV DNA testing has been tried, though with mixed success.\nScreening Interventions.\nInterventions can help increase rates of cervical cancer screenings, specifically among low and middle-class countries. 90% of cervical cancer deaths are from women from low and middle-class countries. In efforts to increase life-saving screenings, interventions have proved successful. Single interventions include reminding patients via phone calls, SMS, and subsidized or free services. Combined interventions include multiple steps and can be more effective than single interventions, specifically health education combined with SMS. These interventions make cervical cancer screenings more accessible and less daunting for many at-risk women.\nVaccination.\nThere are six licensed HPV vaccines: three bivalent (protect against two types of HPV), two quadrivalent (against four), and one nonavalent vaccine (against nine) Three HPV vaccines (Gardasil, Gardasil 9, and Cervarix) reduce the risk of cancerous or precancerous changes of the cervix and perineum by about 93% and 62%, respectively. All have excellent safety profiles and are highly efficacious, or have met immunobridging standards.668 The vaccines are between 92% and 100% effective against HPV 16 and 18 up to at least 8 years. \nHPV vaccines are typically given to people ages 9 to 26, as the vaccine is most effective if given before infection occurs. The primary target group in most of the countries recommending HPV vaccination is young adolescent girls, aged 9-14. As of 2022, 125 countries include HPV vaccines in their routine vaccinations for girls, and 47 countries recommend them for boys, as well,654 including Japan.\nThe duration of effectiveness and whether a booster will be needed is unknown. The high cost of this vaccine has been a cause for concern. Several countries have considered (or are considering) programs to fund HPV vaccination. The American Society of Clinical Oncology guideline has recommendations for different levels of resource availability.\nBarrier protection.\nBarrier protection or spermicidal gel use during sexual intercourse decreases but does not eliminate the risk of transmitting the infection. Condoms may protect against genital warts. They also protect against other sexually transmitted infections, such as HIV and \"Chlamydia\", which are associated with greater risks of developing cervical cancer.\nNutrition.\nVitamin A is associated with a lower risk as are vitamin B12, vitamin C, vitamin E, and beta-Carotene.\nTreatment.\nThe treatment of cervical cancer varies worldwide, largely due to access to surgeons skilled in radical pelvic surgery and the emergence of fertility-sparing therapy in developed nations. Less advanced stages of cervical cancer typically have treatment options that allow fertility to be maintained if the patient desires.\nBecause cervical cancers are radiosensitive, radiation may be used in all stages where surgical options do not exist. Surgical intervention may have better outcomes than radiological approaches. In addition, chemotherapy can be used to treat cervical cancer and is more effective than radiation alone. Chemoradiotherapy may increase overall survival and reduce the risk of disease recurrence compared to radiotherapy alone.\nFor surgery to be curative, the entire cancer must be removed with no cancer found at the margins of the removed tissue on examination under a microscope. This procedure is known as exenteration.\nPrecancerous lesions.\nPrecancerous cells (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia) that would lead to cancer and early-stage cervical cancer (IA1) can be treated effectively by various surgical techniques. Surgical treatment methods include excision, where a cone-shaped portion of the cervix is removed, and ablation, which removes only the parts with abnormal tissues. While these effectively reduce the risk of cancer developing or spreading, they cause an increased risk of premature birth in future pregnancies. Surgical techniques that remove more cervical tissue come with less risk of the cancer recurring but a higher chance of giving birth prematurely. Due to this risk, taking into account the age, childbearing plans of the woman, and the size and location of the cancer cells are crucial for choosing the right procedure. There is low-certainty evidence that peri-operative care approaches, such as 'fast-track surgery' or 'enhanced recovery programmes' may lower surgical stress and improve recovery after gynaecological cancer surgery.\nMicroinvasive cancer.\nMicroinvasive cancer (stage IA) may also be treated by hysterectomy (removal of the whole uterus, including part of the vagina). For stage IA2, the lymph nodes are removed as well. Alternatives include local surgical procedures such as a loop electrical excision procedure or cone biopsy. A systematic review concluded that more evidence is needed to inform decisions about different surgical techniques for women with cervical cancer at stage IA2.\nIf a cone biopsy does not produce clear margins (findings on biopsy showing that the tumor is surrounded by cancer free tissue, suggesting all of the tumor is removed), one more possible treatment option for women who want to preserve their fertility is a trachelectomy. This attempts to surgically remove the cancer while preserving the ovaries and uterus, providing for a more conservative operation than a hysterectomy. It is a viable option for those in stage I cervical cancer which has not spread; however, it is not yet considered a standard of care, as few doctors are skilled in this procedure. Even the most experienced surgeon cannot promise that a trachelectomy can be performed until after surgical microscopic examination, as the extent of the spread of cancer is unknown. If the surgeon is not able to microscopically confirm clear margins of cervical tissue once the woman is under general anaesthesia in the operating room, a hysterectomy may still be needed. This can only be done during the same operation if the woman consents. Due to the possible risk of cancer spreading to the lymph nodes in stage 1B cancers and some stage 1A cancers, the surgeon may also need to remove some lymph nodes from around the uterus for pathologic evaluation.\nA radical trachelectomy can be performed abdominally or vaginally and opinions are conflicting as to which is better. A radical abdominal trachelectomy with lymphadenectomy usually only requires a two- to three-day hospital stay, and most women recover very quickly (about six weeks). Complications are uncommon, although women who can conceive after surgery are susceptible to preterm labour and possible late miscarriage. A wait of at least one year is generally recommended before attempting to become pregnant after surgery. Recurrence in the residual cervix is rare if the trachelectomy has cleared the cancer. Yet, women are recommended to practice vigilant prevention and follow-up care, including Pap screenings/colposcopy, with biopsies of the remaining lower uterine segment as needed (every 3\u20134 months for at least 5 years) to monitor for any recurrence in addition to minimizing any new exposures to HPV through safe sex practices until one is actively trying to conceive.\nRadical hysterectomy and chemoradiation.\nEarly stages (IB1 and IIA less than 4\u00a0cm) can be treated with radical hysterectomy with removal of the lymph nodes or radiation therapy. Radiation therapy is given as external beam radiotherapy to the pelvis and brachytherapy (internal radiation). Women treated with surgery who have high-risk features found on pathologic examination are given radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy to reduce the risk of relapse. A Cochrane review has found moderate-certainty evidence that radiation decreases the risk of disease progression in people with stage IB cervical cancer when compared to no further treatment. However, little evidence was found on its effects on overall survival.\nLarger early-stage tumors (IB2 and IIA more than 4\u00a0cm) may be treated with radiation therapy and cisplatin-based chemotherapy, hysterectomy (which then usually requires adjuvant radiation therapy), or cisplatin chemotherapy followed by hysterectomy. When cisplatin is present, it is thought to be the most active single agent in periodic diseases. Such addition of platinum-based chemotherapy to chemoradiation seems not only to improve survival but also reduces risk of recurrence in women with early-stage cervical cancer (IA2\u2013IIA). A Cochrane review found a lack of evidence on the benefits and harms of primary hysterectomy compared to primary chemoradiotherapy for cervical cancer in stage IB2.\nAdvanced-stage tumors (IIB-IVA) are treated with radiation therapy and cisplatin-based chemotherapy. On 15 June 2006, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the use of a combination of two chemotherapy drugs, hycamtin and cisplatin, for women with late-stage (IVB) cervical cancer treatment. Combination treatment has significant risk of neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia side effects.\nThere is insufficient evidence on whether anticancer drugs after standard care help women with locally advanced cervical cancer live longer.\nNo evidence is available to suggest that any form of follow-up approach is better or worse in terms of prolonging survival, improving quality of life, or guiding the management of problems that can arise because of the treatment, and that in the case of radiotherapy treatment, worsen with time. A 2019 review found no controlled trials regarding the efficacy and safety of interventions for vaginal bleeding in women with advanced cervical cancer.\nImmunotherapy.\nImmunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as pembrolizumab (Keytruda), has also been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for certain patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer, demonstrating promising results in ongoing clinical trials. In October 2021, the FDA expanded this approval to include pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab, for people with persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer, underscoring the potential of immunotherapeutic approaches in this setting. Additional immunotherapy agents, including other PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors, are under investigation and have similarly shown encouraging outcomes in clinical studies.\nAnother immune checkpoint inhibitor, cemiplimab-rwlc (Libtayo), received FDA approval in September 2022 for patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer that has progressed on or after chemotherapy, further highlighting the expanding role of immunotherapeutic strategies in advanced disease.\nTisotumab vedotin (Tivdak) was approved for medical use in the United States in September 2021.\nPsychosocial intervention.\nSupportive group psychotherapy can help mitigate feelings of hopelessness among cancer patients, all while giving patients a community that understands what they are going through. Drug therapy, specifically esketamine, can alleviate anxiety and depression that result from cancer through a biological approach. Psychosocial telephone counseling can improve depressive symptoms and increase quality-of-life levels of patients, while being more accessible than many other forms of psychotherapy. Peer education, when combined with specialized nursing care, allows patients to connect and learn from former cancer patients, which increases self-efficacy and quality of life.\nPsychosocial interventions among cervical cancer patients decrease depression and anxiety levels, all while having a positive impact on quality of life, cortisol levels, self-efficacy, fatigue, sleep status, and sexual dysfunction. Mindfulness-based interventions have been proven helpful in additionally decreasing depression and anxiety levels of patients with cervical cancer.\nPrognosis.\nStage.\nThe prognosis depends on the stage of the cancer. The prognosis for squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma of the cervix is the same for each given stage. For intraepithelial cervical neoplasms, the prognosis is good. With treatment, the five-year survival rate for FIGO stage 1 (cancer confined to the cervix) cervical cancer is 85%, and the overall (all stages combined) five-year survival rate is about 66%. Five-year survival in Stage 2 disease (cancer invading beyond upper two-thirds of uterus) is 65%. Stage 3 disease (in which the lower one-third of vagina, pelvic wall is involved or presence of hydronephrosis, pelvic or peri-aortic lymph node involvement) is 35%. Stage 4 disease, in which cancer extends beyond the pelvis, or involves the bladder or rectum, has a 5-year survival rate of 7%.\nAbout 35% of women with invasive cervical cancer have persistent or recurrent disease after treatment.\nBy country.\nThere is an ethnic disparity in five-year survival in the United States. Average survival rates of the dominant squamous cell carcinoma are 72% for Hispanic and Asian-Pacific women, 68% for White women and 61% for Black women.\nRegular screening has meant that precancerous changes and early-stage cervical cancers have been detected and treated early. Figures suggest that cervical screening is saving 5,000 lives each year in the UK by preventing cervical cancer.\nAbout 1,000 women per year die of cervical cancer in the UK. All of the Nordic countries have cervical cancer screening programs in place. The Pap test was integrated into clinical practice in the Nordic countries in the 1960s.\nIn Africa, outcomes are often worse as diagnosis is frequently at a later stage of the disease. In a scoping review of publicly-available cervical cancer prevention and control plans from African countries, plans tended to emphasize survivorship rather than early HPV diagnosis and prevention.\nAdverse effects.\nChemotherapy works by attacking cells that rapidly divide. This kills cancer cells, but can also impact normal cells, leading to adverse side effects. Common chemotherapy side effects include: hair loss, mouth sores, loss of appetite, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, premature menopause, infertility, and damage to the blood-forming cells within bone marrow. Most acute side effects are temporary, dissipating when treatment ceases, but some can be long-lasting or permanent. Long-term chemotherapy side effects include changes in the menstrual cycle, neuropathy, and nephrotoxicity.\nRadiation therapy (RT) adverse effects; for a complete side effect list see \nCurative cervical radiation therapy may affect unintended tissues located within the delivery pathway(s) or adjacent to the target lesion, each tissue with a unique sensitivity and response to radiation injury. Common acute RT effects involve the gastrointestinal system, e.g., diarrhea and constipation; urinary tract, e.g., frequent urination; and may cause cervicitis. Common late RT complications include: infertility or premature ovarian failure; vaginal stenosis; lower motor neuron syndrome; telangiectasias, and subsequent hemorrhage; and progressive myelopathy, which may result in irreversible neurologic deficits ranging from minor sensory symptoms to complete paraplegia. Radiotherapy late effects (with occurrence rates) include osteonecrosis (8-20%), bladder ulceration (&lt;3%), vaginal stenosis (&gt;2.5%) and chronic pelvic radiation disease (1-10%), e.g., irreversible lumbosacral plexopathy.\nPelvic radiation also induces secondary malignancies such as leukemia, lymphoma, bladder cancer, pelvic malignancy, colorectal cancer, bone, and soft-tissue sarcoma with occurrence rates between 0.2 and 1.0% per year for each.\nEpidemiology.\nWorldwide, cervical cancer is both the fourth-most common type of cancer and the fourth-most common cause of death from cancer in women, with over 660,000 new cases and around 350,000 deaths in 2022. It is the second-most common cause of female-specific cancer after breast cancer, accounting for around 8% of both total cancer cases and total cancer deaths in women. 88% (2020 figure) of cervical cancers and 90% of deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and 2% (2020 figure) in high-income countries (HICs).650 It is the most frequently detected cancer during pregnancy, with an occurrence of 1.5 to 12 for every 100,000 pregnancies.\nThe large majority of cervical cancer cases in 2020 (88%) occurred in LMICs, where they account for 17% of all cancers in women, compared with only 2% in high-income countries (HICs). In sub-Saharan Africa, the region with the highest rates of young women living with HIV (WLWH), approximately 20% of cervical cancer cases occur in WLWH. HPV infection is more likely to persist and to progress to cancer in WLWH. Mortality rates vary 50-fold between countries, ranging from &lt;2 per 100,000 women in some HICs to &gt;40 per 100,000 in some countries of sub-Saharan Africa.650\nAfrica.\nOf the 20 hardest hit countries by cervical cancer, 19 are in Africa.\nAustralia.\nAustralia is on target to eliminate cervical cancer. It anticipates achieving this in the next 10 years.\nIn 2022, it is estimated that 942 new cases of cervical cancer will be diagnosed in Australia. In 2022, it is estimated that a female has a 1 in 180 (or 0.56%) risk of being diagnosed with cervical cancer by the age of 85.\nIn 2020, there were 165 women aged 25\u201374 who died from cervical cancer, which is a mortality rate of 2 deaths per 100,000 women in the population. Over the 5 years 2016\u20132020, there were 62 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women aged 25\u201374 who died from cervical cancer, which is a mortality rate of 7 deaths per 100,000 Indigenous women in the population. Over the 5 years 2016\u20132020, the age-standardised mortality rate among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women was 3.8 times the rate of non-Indigenous Australians.\nThe number of women diagnosed with cervical cancer has dropped on average by 4.5% each year since organised screening began in 1991 (1991\u20132005). Regular twice-yearly Pap tests [this is out of date] can reduce the incidence of cervical cancer up to 90% in Australia, and save 1,200 Australian women from dying from the disease each year. It is predicted that because of the success of the primary HPV testing programme there will be fewer than four new cases per 100 000 women annually by 2028.\nNepal.\nHundreds of women in Nepal are diagnosed with cervical cancer each year, primarily caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. In February 2025, Nepal launched a nationwide HPV vaccination campaign targeting over 1.6 million girls aged 10\u201315, supported by WHO, UNICEF, and Gavi, alongside educational programs to raise awareness and prevent cervical cancer \nCanada.\nAn estimated 1,450 Canadians will be diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2022. An estimated 380 will die from it.\nIndia.\nIn India, the number of people with cervical cancer is rising, but overall, the age-adjusted rates are decreasing. Usage of condoms in the female population has improved the survival of women with cancers of the cervix.\nEuropean Union.\nAs of 2022, the World Health Organization announced that \"each year in the WHO European Region, more than 66,000 women are newly diagnosed with cervical cancer and more than 30,000 die from this preventable disease.\"\nUnited Kingdom.\nCervical cancer is the 12th-most common cancer in women in the UK (around 3,100 women were diagnosed with the disease in 2011) and accounts for 1% of cancer deaths (around 920 died in 2012). With a 42% reduction from 1988 to 1997, the NHS-implemented screening programme has been highly successful, screening the highest-risk age group (25\u201349 years) every 3 years, and those ages 50\u201364 every 5 years.\nUnited States.\nAn estimated 13,170 new cervical cancers and 4,250 cervical cancer deaths will occur in the United States in 2019. The median age at diagnosis is 50. The rate of new cases in the United States was 7.3 per 100,000 women, based on rates from 2012 to 2016. Cervical cancer deaths decreased by approximately 74% in the last 50 years, largely due to widespread Pap test screening. The annual direct medical cost of cervical cancer prevention and treatment before the introduction of the HPV vaccine was estimated at $6\u00a0billion.\nNigeria.\nThe Nigerian Institute of Medical Research (NIMR) reports that 28 Nigerian women lose their lives daily due to this disease. This alarming statistic underscores the pressing need for better awareness, prevention, and treatment efforts nationally. Numerous Nigerian women lack access to these preventive measures. In many regions of the country, screening tests such as Pap tests and HPV tests are not easily accessible or affordable\nHistory.\nEpidemiologists working in the early 20th century noted that cervical cancer behaved like a sexually transmitted disease. In summary:\nThese historical observations suggested a sexually transmitted agent caused cervical cancer. Initial research in the 1940s and 1950s attributed cervical cancer to smegma. During the 1960s and 1970s it was suspected that infection with herpes simplex virus (HSV) was the cause of the disease. In summary, HSV was seen as a likely cause because it is known to survive in the female reproductive tract, and to be transmitted sexually in a way compatible with known risk factors, such as promiscuity and low socioeconomic status. Herpes viruses were also implicated in other malignant diseases, including Burkitt's lymphoma, Nasopharyngeal carcinoma, Marek's disease and the Luck\u00e9 renal adenocarcinoma. HSV was recovered from cervical tumour cells.\nA description of human papillomavirus (HPV) by electron microscopy was given in 1949, and HPV-DNA was identified in 1963. It was not until the 1980s that HPV was identified in cervical cancer tissue. It has since been demonstrated that HPV is implicated in virtually all cervical cancers. Specific viral subtypes implicated are HPV 16, 18, 31, 45 and others.\nIn work that was initiated in the mid-1980s, the HPV vaccine was developed, in parallel, by researchers at Georgetown University Medical Center, the University of Rochester, the University of Queensland in Australia, and the U.S. National Cancer Institute. In 2006, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first preventive HPV vaccine, marketed by Merck &amp; Co. under the trade name Gardasil.\n17 November is the Cervical Cancer Elimination Day of Action. The date marks the day in 2020 when WHO launched the Global strategy to accelerate the elimination of cervical cancer as a public health problem, with a resolution passed by 194 countries. In November 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO), under backing from the World Health Assembly, set out a strategy to eliminate cervical cancer by 2050. The strategy involves vaccinating 90% of girls by the age of 15, screening 70% of women by the age of 35 and again by the age of 45, and treating 90% of women identified with cervical disease. To eliminate cervical cancer, all countries must reach and maintain an incidence rate of below 4 per 100 000 women.\nSociety and culture.\nAustralia.\nIn Australia, Aboriginal women are more than five times more likely to die from cervical cancer than non-Aboriginal women, suggesting that Aboriginal women are less likely to have regular Pap tests. Several factors may limit indigenous women from engaging in regular cervical screening practices, including sensitivity in discussing the topic in Aboriginal communities, embarrassment, anxiety and fear about the procedure. Difficulty in accessing screening services (for example, transport difficulties) and a lack of female GPs, trained Pap test providers and trained female Aboriginal Health Workers are also issues.\nThe Australian Cervical Cancer Foundation (ACCF), founded in 2008, promotes 'women's health by eliminating cervical cancer and enabling treatment for women with cervical cancer and related health issues, in Australia and in developing countries.' Ian Frazer, one of the developers of the Gardasil cervical cancer vaccine, is the scientific advisor to ACCF. Janette Howard, the wife of the then-Prime Minister of Australia, John Howard, was diagnosed with cervical cancer in 1996, and first spoke publicly about the disease in 2006.\nUnited States.\nA 2007 survey of American women found 40% had heard of HPV infection, and less than half of those knew it causes cervical cancer. Over a longitudinal study from 1975 to 2000, it was found that people of lower socioeconomic census brackets had higher rates of late-stage cancer diagnosis and higher morbidity rates. After controlling for stage, there still existed differences in survival rates. Women in the US experience stigma around HPV infection, vaccination, and cervical cancer. This is predominantly driven by fear of social judgment and rejection, self-blame, and shame, with notable negative influences from gender and social norms, as both human papillomavirus infection and cervical cancer were stigmatized due to the perception that they arise from reckless behavior such as having multiple sexual partners or neglecting screening.\nLGBTQ populations.\nTransgender men and gender-diverse people who have a cervix (even if partially intact) or have a prior history of cervical cancer or precancerous conditions, and are age 21 or older, who have ever had sex with anyone, need to get screened for cervical cancer. Transmasculine people are just as likely as cisgender women to have cervical cancer, but are less likely to undergo cervical screening, because of dysphoria, gender disaffirmation or disempowerment of the individual by healthcare providers, or being misinformed of HPV and cervical cancer risks as well as many healthcare providers perceiving transmasculine individuals to be at low risk of cervical cancer.\nTransgender women who have not had bottom surgery have no risk of cervical cancer, as they do not have a cervix. Trans women who have had bottom surgery to create a vagina (vaginoplasty) and possibly a cervix, are at low risk to develop cancer in the tissues of their neo-vagina or neo-cervix as these tissues are made up of different cells than a cervix in a cisgender woman Cervical cancer screening is not necessary in trans women who have undergone vaginoplasty because they do not have a cervix.\nIntersex people with a cervix are also able to have cervical cancer.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Even the date of his reign is uncertain. \"Liber Pontificalis\" gives a reign of 8 years and 11 months, from 275 to 283. Eusebius, on the other hand says his reign was only 10 months.\nEutychian is said to have allowed the blessing of grapes and beans on the altar and to have buried 324 martyrs with his own hands. Some historians doubt these traditions, but others assert that persecutions continued until the Edict of Serdica was proclaimed in 311 by Emperor Galerius, making Christianity a legal and acceptable religion.

Little information on Caius is available except that given by the \"Liber Pontificalis\", which relies on a legendary account of the martyrdom of Susanna of Rome for its information. According to legend, Caius baptized the men and women who had been converted by Tiburtius (who is venerated with Susanna) and Castulus. His legend states that Caius took refuge in the catacombs of Rome and died a martyr.\nPontificate.\nChristian tradition makes Caius a native of the Dalmatian city of Salona, the son of a man also named Caius or Gaius, and a member of a noble family related to the Emperor Diocletian. About 280, an early Christian house of worship was established on the site of Santa Susanna, which, like many of the earliest Christian meeting places, was in a house (\"domus ecclesiae\"). The \"domus\" belonged, according to the sixth-century \"acta\", to brothers named Caius and Gabinus, prominent Christians. Caius may be this pope, or Caius the Presbyter. Gabinus is the name given to the father of Susanna. Thus, sources state that Caius was the uncle of Susanna.\nAs pope, Caius decreed that before someone could assume the position of bishop, he must first be porter, lector, exorcist, acolyte, subdeacon, deacon, and priest. He also divided the districts of Rome among the deacons. During his pontificate, anti-Christian measures increased, although new churches were built and cemeteries were expanded. \nMartyrdom.\nPope Caius would go into hiding due to increased persecution of the church, alongside Saints Polycarp, Sebastian, Tranquillinus, Tiburtius, Nicostratus and Zoe, in the house of Castulus, a Christian officer employed at the Imperial Palace. Over the course of the next few years, the entire group would be discovered one by one by Roman authorities and martyred. Caius would be found praying with Tiburtius shortly after the conversion and baptism of Tiburtius' children and the pair was brought to the local Praefectus, a man named Fabian, who ordered the construction of a great bonfire, and ordered the two to either throw frankincense into it to appease the Roman gods, or to cast themselves into it. Although Pope Caius' ultimate fate is unclear, often being associated with beheading, according to legend Tiburtius walked into the fire invoking the name of Christ and remained unhurt, so he was taken out of Rome by the Via Labicana and beheaded. However, Caius' martyrdom is disputed, as the Diocletianic Persecution of Christians began in 303\u00a0AD, after Caius\u2019 alleged death, and Diocletian was not immediately hostile to Christianity upon becoming emperor.\nLegacy.\nCaius is mentioned in the fourth-century \"Depositio Episcoporum\" (therefore not as a martyr): \"X kl maii Caii in Callisti\".\nCaius' tomb, with the original epitaph, was discovered in the catacomb of Callixtus and in it the ring with which he used to seal his letters (see Arringhi, Roma subterr., 1. iv. c. xlviii. p.\u00a0426). In 1631, his alleged residence in Rome was turned into a church. However, it was demolished in 1880 to make room for the Ministry of War, on the Via XX Settembre, and his relics were transferred to the chapel of the Barberini family.\nSaint Caius's feast day is celebrated on 22 April, as is that of Pope Soter. They are celebrated jointly in the Tridentine calendar and in the successive versions of the General Roman Calendar until that of 1969, since when they are omitted. Both are mentioned under 22 April in the Roman Martyrology, the official list of recognized saints. The entry for Saint Caius is as follows: \"At Rome, in the cemetery of Callistus on the Via Appia, the burial of Saint Caius, Pope, who, fleeing from the persecution of Diocletian, died as a confessor of the faith.\"\nSaint Caius is portrayed in art wearing the papal tiara with Saint Nereus. He is venerated in Dalmatia and Venice. In Florence, the church of San Gaggio on the via Senese was dedicated to him; the term \"Gaggio\" is a corruption of the name \"Cajo\". In 2003, plans were put into effect to turn it into residential council housing.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It campaigns on a platform of social democracy and civic nationalism. The party is a supporter of the European Union and is a member of the European Free Alliance (EFA). The party holds 4 of 32 Welsh seats in the UK House of Commons, 14 of 60 seats in the Senedd, and 200 of 1,234 principal local authority councillors. Plaid was formed in 1925 under the name ('the national party of Wales') and Gwynfor Evans won the first Westminster seat for the party at the 1966 Carmarthen by-election.\nIn 1999 (in the first devolved Welsh Assembly election), Plaid Cymru gained considerable ground in traditionally Labour heartlands. These breakthroughs were part of the intentional aim to win more seats in the Welsh valleys and North East Wales, which continues to be an ambition today. The party have mostly been in opposition in the Senedd. Although under the leadership of Ieuan Wyn Jones, the party was part of a coalition as a junior partner with Welsh Labour (See: One Wales, Morgan and Jones governments) between 2007 and 2011. Wyn Jones became the deputy First Minister and Minister for the Economy and Transport, other Plaid Cymru Assembly members were also part of the cabinets.\nAfter losses in the 2011 Assembly elections and dropping down to being the third largest party, Wyn Jones stepped down. He was succeeded by Leanne Wood. In the 2016 Assembly elections Wood managed to win her constituency seat of Rhondda meaning the party gained one seat, and became the official opposition once again, although only for a brief period. In 2018 following internal pressure and a leadership contest, Adam Price defeated Wood and was elected the new leader. Following the 2021 Senedd election Plaid formed a co-operation agreement with the Welsh Labour government. In May 2023 Price resigned as leader following the publication of a report which detailed failings by the party to prevent sexual harassment and bullying. In June 2023 Rhun ap Iorwerth was elected unopposed as leader. The party won the second most seats in Wales in the 2024 general election and won both its target seats.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAims.\nIn September 2008, a senior Plaid assembly member spelled out her party's continuing support for an independent Wales. The then Welsh Minister for Rural Affairs, Elin Jones, told delegates at Plaid's annual conference in Aberystwyth that the party would continue its commitment to independence under the coalition with Welsh Labour.\nIn 2014, the party's constitution included the following aims:\nWhile Wales remains part of the United Kingdom, Plaid Cymru want to see further powers devolved from the UK Government to Wales, including: broadcasting and communication powers, devolution of the Crown Estate, welfare and rail.\nThe party opposes nuclear power and nuclear weapons (including the UK's Trident nuclear weapons programme).\nThe party also favours lowering the voting age to 16 years old. The voting age has already been lowered to include 16- and 17-year-olds for both Senedd elections and local elections in Wales since 2020, but not for UK general elections or police and crime commissioner elections: 18 is the minimum voting age for both of these.\nPlaid Cymru supports making social care \"free at the point of need\".\nIn 2021, Plaid Cymru's policies in its co-operation agreement with Welsh Labour included:\nIn 2025, despite the party's historically strong vocal support for Welsh independence, the party's leader, Rhun ap Iorwerth, stated there was no plan for an independence referendum in the first term of a Plaid Cymru government if they were elected at the next Senedd election, and that talk of a referendum would not take place before 2030. The party does however continue to have an official policy of Welsh independence.\nHistory.\nBeginnings.\nWhile both the Labour and Liberal parties of the early 20th century had accommodated demands for Welsh home rule, no political party existed for the purpose of establishing a Welsh government. was formed on 5 August 1925, by Moses Gruffydd, H. R. Jones and Lewis Valentine, members of ; lit.\u2009'the Self-Rulers' Army of Wales'); and Fred Jones, Saunders Lewis of and D. Edmund Williams. Initially, home rule for Wales was not an explicit aim of the new movement; keeping Wales Welsh-speaking took primacy, with the aim of making Welsh the only official language of Wales.\nIn the 1929 general election, the party contested its first parliamentary constituency, Caernarvonshire, polling 609 votes, or 1.6% of the vote for that seat. The party contested few such elections in its early years, partly due to its ambivalence towards Westminster politics. Indeed, the candidate Lewis Valentine, the party's first president, offered himself in Caernarvonshire on a platform of demonstrating Welsh people's rejection of English dominion.\n1930s.\nBy 1932, the aims of self-government and Welsh representation at the League of Nations had been added to that of preserving Welsh language and culture. However, this move, and the party's early attempts to develop an economic critique, did not broaden its appeal beyond that of an intellectual and socially conservative Welsh language pressure group. The alleged sympathy of the party's leading members (including President Saunders Lewis) towards Europe's totalitarian regimes compromised its early appeal further.\nSaunders Lewis, David John Williams and Lewis Valentine set fire to the newly constructed RAF Penyberth air base on the Ll\u0177n Peninsula in Gwynedd in 1936, in protest at its siting in the Welsh-speaking heartland. The leaders' treatment, including the trial judge's dismissal of the use of Welsh and their subsequent imprisonment in Wormwood Scrubs, led to \"The Three\" becoming a \"cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre\". This heightened the profile of the party dramatically and its membership had doubled to nearly 2,000 by 1939.\n1940s.\nPenyberth, and Plaid Cymru's neutral stance during the Second World War, prompted concerns within the UK Government that it might be used by Germany to insert spies or carry out other covert operations. In fact, the party adopted a neutral standpoint and urged (with only limited success) conscientious objection to war service.\nIn 1943, Saunders Lewis contested the University of Wales parliamentary seat at a by-election, gaining 1,330 votes, or 22%. In the 1945 general election, with party membership at around 2,500, Plaid Cymru contested seven seats, as many as it had in the preceding 20 years, including constituencies in south Wales for the first time. At this time Gwynfor Evans was elected president.\n1950s.\nGwynfor Evans's presidency coincided with the maturation of Plaid Cymru (as it now began to refer to itself) into a more recognisable political party. Its share of the vote increased from 0.7% in the 1951 general election to 3.1% in 1955 and 5.2% in 1959. In the 1959 election, the party contested a majority of Welsh seats for the first time. Proposals to flood the village of Capel Celyn in the Tryweryn valley in Gwynedd in 1957 to supply the city of Liverpool with water played a part in Plaid Cymru's growth. The fact that the parliamentary bill authorising the dam went through without support from any Welsh MPs showed that the MPs' votes in Westminster were not enough to prevent such bills from passing.\n1960s.\nSupport for the party declined slightly in the early 1960s, particularly as support for the Liberal Party began to stabilise from its long-term decline. In 1962, Saunders Lewis gave a radio talk entitled \"Tynged yr Iaith\" (The fate of the language) in which he predicted the extinction of the Welsh language unless action was taken. This led to the formation of Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg (the Welsh Language Society) the same year.\nLabour's return to power in 1964 and the creation of the post of Secretary of State for Wales appeared to represent a continuation of the incremental evolution of a distinctive Welsh polity, following the Conservative government's appointment of a Minister of Welsh Affairs in 1951 and the establishment of Cardiff as Wales's capital in 1955.\nHowever, in 1966, less than four months after coming in third in the constituency of Carmarthen, Gwynfor Evans captured the seat from Labour at a by-election. This was followed by two further by-elections in Rhondda West in 1967 and Caerphilly in 1968 in which the party achieved massive swings of 30% and 40% respectively, coming within a whisker of victory. The results were caused partly by an anti-Labour backlash. Expectations in coal mining communities that the Wilson government would halt the long-term decline in their industry had been dashed by a significant downward revision of coal production estimates. However, particularly in Carmarthen, Plaid also successfully depicted Labour's policies as a threat to the viability of small Welsh communities.\n1970s.\nIn the 1970 general election, Plaid Cymru contested every seat in Wales for the first time and its vote share surged from 4.5% in 1966 to 11.5%. Gwynfor Evans lost Carmarthen to Labour, but regained the seat in October 1974, by which time the party had gained a further two MPs, representing the constituencies of Caernarfon and Merionethshire.\nPlaid Cymru's emergence (along with the Scottish National Party) prompted the Wilson government to establish the Kilbrandon Commission on the constitution. The subsequent proposals for a Welsh Assembly were, however, heavily defeated in a referendum in 1979. Despite Plaid Cymru's ambivalence toward home rule (as opposed to outright independence) the referendum result led many in the party to question its direction.\nPlaid campaigned to leave the Common Market in the 1975 referendum, feeling that the EC's regional aid policies would \"reconcile places like Wales to their subordinate position\". Nevertheless, 65% of Welsh voters voted to remain in the EC during a 1975 referendum. The EC was incorporated into the European Union (EU) in 1993.\nAt the 1979 general election, the party's vote share declined from 10.8% to 8.1% and Carmarthen was again lost to Labour, although Caernarfon and Merionethshire were held by the party.\n1980s.\nCaernarfon MP Dafydd Wigley succeeded Gwynfor Evans as president in 1981, inheriting a party whose morale was at an all-time low. In 1981 the party adopted a policy of \"community socialism\". While the party embarked on a wide-ranging review of its priorities and goals, Gwynfor Evans fought a successful campaign (including the threat of a hunger strike) to oblige the Conservative government to fulfill its promise to establish S4C, a Welsh-language television station. In 1984, Dafydd Elis-Thomas was elected president, defeating Dafydd Iwan, a move that saw the party shift to the left. Ieuan Wyn Jones (later Plaid Cymru leader) captured Ynys M\u00f4n from the Conservatives in 1987. In 1989 Dafydd Wigley once again assumed the presidency of the party.\n1990s.\nIn the 1992 general election, the party added a fourth MP, Cynog Dafis, when he gained Ceredigion and Pembroke North from the Liberal Democrats. Dafis was endorsed by the local branch of the Green Party. The party's vote share recovered to 9.9% at the 1997 general election.\nIn 1997, following the election of a Labour government committed to devolution for Wales, a further referendum was narrowly won, establishing the National Assembly for Wales. Plaid Cymru became the main opposition to the ruling Labour Party, with 17 seats to Labour's 28. In doing so, it appeared to have broken out of its rural Welsh-speaking heartland, and gained seats in traditionally strong Labour areas in industrial South Wales.\nAhead of the 1999 National Assembly for Wales election, Plaid Cymru dropped its policy of Welsh independence in favour of continued membership in the European Union. These changes in policy were made as it was believed that the electorate in Wales did not view independence as an important issue. It also adopted social democracy for its economic policy in an attempt to weaken Labour. These changes in policy have been used to explain the party's subsequent electoral success in Labour's traditional South East Wales heartlands.\nAssembly/Senedd era.\nFirst National Assembly (1999\u20132003).\nIn the 1999 election, Plaid Cymru gained seats in traditional Labour areas such as Rhondda, Islwyn and Llanelli, achieving by far its highest share of the vote in any Wales-wide election. While Plaid Cymru regarded itself as the natural beneficiary of devolution, others attributed its performance in large part to the travails of the Labour Party, whose nomination for Assembly First Secretary, Ron Davies, was forced to stand down in an alleged sex scandal. The ensuing leadership battle, won by Alun Michael, did much to damage Labour, and thus aided Plaid Cymru, whose leader was the more popular and higher profile Dafydd Wigley. The Labour Party's UK national leadership was seen to interfere in the contest and deny the popular Rhodri Morgan victory. Less than two months later, in elections to the European parliament, Labour support slumped further, and Plaid Cymru came within 2.5% of achieving the largest share of the vote in Wales. Under the new system of proportional representation, the party also gained two MEPs.\nPlaid Cymru then developed political problems of its own. Dafydd Wigley resigned, citing health problems but amid rumours of a plot against him. His successor, Ieuan Wyn Jones, struggled to impose his authority, particularly over controversial remarks made by a councillor, Seimon Glyn. At the same time, Labour leader and First Minister Alun Michael was replaced by Rhodri Morgan.\nIn the 2001 general election, notwithstanding Plaid Cymru recording its highest-ever vote share in a general election, 14.3%, the party lost Wyn Jones's former seat of Ynys M\u00f4n to Albert Owen, although it gained Carmarthen East and Dinefwr, where Adam Price was elected.\nSecond National Assembly (2003\u201307).\nThe Assembly elections of May 2003 saw the party's representation drop from 17 to 12, with the seats gained in the 1999 election falling again to Labour and the party's share of the vote declining to 21%. Plaid Cymru narrowly remained the second-largest party in the National Assembly ahead of the Conservatives, Liberal Democrats and a single independent.\nOn 15 September 2003, folk-singer and county councillor Dafydd Iwan was elected as Plaid Cymru's president. Ieuan Wyn Jones, who had resigned from his dual role as president and Assembly group leader following the losses in the 2003 Assembly election, was re-elected in the latter role. Elfyn Llwyd remained the Plaid Cymru leader in the Westminster Parliament. Under Iwan's presidency, the party formally adopted a policy of independence for Wales within Europe at its conference in September 2003. Plaid Cymru had historically supported Welsh independence but dropped this policy ahead of the 1999 devolved election.\nThe 2004 local election saw the party lose control of the two South Wales councils it gained in 1999, Rhondda Cynon Taff and Caerphilly, while retaining its stronghold of Gwynedd in the north-west. The results enabled the party to claim a greater number of ethnic minority councillors than all the other political parties in Wales combined, along with gains in authorities such as Cardiff and Swansea, where Plaid Cymru representation had been minimal. In the European Parliament elections of the same year, the party's vote share fell to 17.4%, and the reduction in the number of Welsh MEPs saw its representation reduced to one.\nIn the general election of 5 May 2005, Plaid Cymru lost the Ceredigion seat to the Liberal Democrats; this result was a disappointment to Plaid, who had hoped to gain Ynys M\u00f4n. Overall therefore, Plaid Cymru's Parliamentary representation fell to three seats, the lowest number for the party since 1992. The party's share of the vote fell to 12.6%.\nSince Plaid Genedlaethol Cymru reformation to 'Plaid Cymru' in 1933, the logo representing the party was the green 'triban' (three peaks) which symbolically represented Plaid's three key goals; self-government, cultural prosperity and economic prosperity, 'anchored in the bedrock of Welsh identity and history that is the Welsh upland landscape', the logo would change in the late stages of 20th century to include the red dragon of Wales, however this version was short-lived. In 2006, the party voted constitutional changes to formally designate the party's leader in the assembly as its overall leader, with Ieuan Wyn Jones being restored to the full leadership and Dafydd Iwan becoming head of the voluntary wing of the party. The party unveiled a radical change of image in 2006. In that year, the party opted to use \"Plaid\" as the party's name, although \"Plaid Cymru \u2014 the Party of Wales\" would remain the official title. Plaid would abandon the triban (apart from the merchandise) and adopt the yellow Welsh poppy (\"Meconopsis cambrica\").\nThird National Assembly (2007\u20132011).\nIn the National Assembly election of 3 May 2007, Plaid Cymru increased its number of seats from 12 to 15, regaining Llanelli, gaining one additional list seat and winning the newly created constituency of Aberconwy. The 2007 election also saw Plaid Cymru's Mohammad Asghar become the first ethnic minority candidate elected to the Welsh Assembly. The party's share of the vote increased to 22.4%.\nAfter weeks of negotiations involving all four parties in the Assembly, Plaid Cymru and Labour agreed to form a coalition government. Their agreed \"One Wales\" programme included a commitment for both parties to campaign for a Yes vote in a referendum on full law-making powers for the Assembly, to be held at a time of the Welsh Assembly Government's choosing. Ieuan Wyn Jones was subsequently confirmed as Deputy First Minister of Wales and Minister for the Economy and Transport. Rhodri Glyn Thomas was appointed Heritage Minister. He later stood down, and Alun Ffred Jones took over. Ceredigion AM Elin Jones was appointed to the Rural Affairs brief in the new 10-member cabinet. Jocelyn Davies became Deputy Minister for Housing, and later, Regeneration.\nIn the 2010 general election, Plaid returned three MPs to Westminster. They took part in the Yes for Wales cross-party campaign for the March 2011 referendum.\nFourth National Assembly (2011\u201316).\nIn the 2011 National Assembly election, Plaid slipped from second place to third, being overtaken by the Welsh Conservatives and losing its deputy leader Helen Mary Jones. The party held an inquiry into the election result. The internal investigation led to the adoption of wide-ranging changes to its constitution, including a streamlining of the leadership structure.\nIn May 2011, Ieuan Wyn Jones announced he would stand down as leader within the first half of the Assembly term. A leadership election was held in which three candidates eventually stood: Elin Jones, Dafydd Elis-Thomas and Leanne Wood; Simon Thomas withdrew his candidacy before ballots were cast.\nOn 15 March 2012, Plaid Cymru elected Leanne Wood as its new leader. She received 55% of the vote, over second-placed Elin Jones with 41%. Wood was the party's first female leader, and its first not to be a fluent Welsh speaker. Soon after her election as leader, she appointed former MP Adam Price to head an economic commission for the party \"focussed on bringing together tailor-made policies in order to transform our economy\". On 1 May 2012, it was confirmed Leanne Wood would not be taking the \u00a323,000 pay increase that every other party leader in the Assembly receives.\nOn 12 November 2012, Wood announced she would aim to abandon her relatively safe list seat by winning a constituency at the 2016 National Assembly elections; she later confirmed she would contest the Rhondda. Adam Price was subsequently selected as the party's candidate for Carmarthen East and Dinefwr. Lindsay Whittle confirmed he would stand solely in Caerphilly.\nOn 20 June 2013, former party leader Ieuan Wyn Jones stood down from the Assembly as the member for Ynys M\u00f4n. Plaid Cymru's candidate Rhun ap Iorwerth was elected as the new Assembly Member for the constituency, receiving 12,601 votes (a 58% share) with a majority of 9,166 over the Labour candidate.\nFifth National Assembly/Senedd (2016\u20132021).\nAt the 2016 Welsh Assembly elections, Plaid Cymru gained one seat, Rhondda from Labour, on what was an otherwise disappointing night, and became the Assembly's second-largest party and briefly became the official opposition to the Welsh Government with 12 seats. By January 2018 Plaid Cymru had been reduced to ten Assembly Members, following the resignation of Dafydd Elis-Thomas in 2016 and the permanent expulsion of Neil McEvoy from Plaid's Assembly group in 2018.\nDespite campaigning to leave in 1975, Plaid campaigned for a Remain vote in the 2016 referendum on the UK's membership of the EU, spending \u00a327,495 on the campaign. In the referendum Wales voted 52.5% in favour of Leave. Immediately after the referendum, Leanne Wood stated that voters 'must be respected' and criticised calls for a second EU referendum. Plaid Cymru later modified their policy to support a People's Vote.\nIn the 2017 United Kingdom general election, Plaid saw their popular vote fall, but narrowly gained Ceredigion and saw Arfon become highly marginal.\nIn September 2018, Adam Price won the party's leadership election, defeating the incumbent Leanne Wood and fellow challenger Rhun ap Iorwerth. In October 2018, it was regarded as left-wing populist by Massetti Emmanuel in the Comparative European Politics academic journal.\nIn the Brecon and Radnorshire by-election Plaid Cymru decided not to put up a candidate, but instead to support the Liberal Democrat candidate Jane Dodds in order to maximise the chance of an anti-Brexit candidate winning.\nIn the 2019 United Kingdom general election, Plaid stood aside in four seats to endorse Unite to Remain candidates. Plaid held their four seats but saw a decrease in their popular vote.\nSixth Senedd (2021\u2013).\nIn the run-up to the 2021 Senedd election, polling suggested that Welsh Labour would win the highest number of seats but fall short of an overall majority. Pollsters and commentators suggested that the most likely outcome would be another Labour\u2013Plaid Cymru coalition, an option First Minister Mark Drakeford said he would be open to. Price insisted that his party would not be Labour's \"junior partner\", nor would they work with the Conservatives under any circumstances. He stated that Plaid would be willing to join forces with Labour, but only if the former were the largest party or if it were an equal partnership. Price also said that he did not consider Welsh independence to be \"a distraction or a constitutional abstraction\", but rather \"a practical necessity\".\nAt the election, Plaid increased their seat total to thirteen, up one from the twelve they won in 2016, but lost out in their target constituencies, and lost Rhondda where former leader Leanne Wood lost her seat to Labour. Price said he would not resign, telling ITV Wales: \"My job is to lead, its not to give up at a set back or disappointment. My job is to sustain the hope \u2013 all those young people who voted for Plaid because they were inspired by our message of the potential we believe is there in Wales to deliver a decent society for our people. I firmly believe that we have sown a lot of seed at this election. A lot of young people in particular who did come with us this time has laid the foundations for the future which I think will set us up for growth in the years to come.\"\nOn 22 November 2021, despite Price's earlier comments about refusing to work with Labour, the two parties announced a co-operation agreement consisting of almost 50 different policies, including providing free school meals for all primary school children, the establishment of a free-at-point-of-need national care system and building a railway between North and South Wales. Price called the agreement \"a down-payment on independence\" and claimed that the results of the Senedd election \"confirmed Wales's status as an indy-curious nation. A curiosity that will give birth \u2013 sooner than many think \u2013 to an independent Wales.\" He went on to say, \"For Wales to be free, we must first be united. And, that is what this Co-operation Agreement sets out to achieve. It launches us on a pathway to a united Wales, one that, sooner than we perhaps think, will find it both comfortable and natural, indeed essential, to join the world community of normal, independent nations.\"\nThe co-operation agreement was ratified by Plaid's conference, with 94% voting in favour. \"This is a huge step forward for Wales and our democracy,\" Price said. \"The co-operation agreement will bring immediate, tangible and long-term benefit for the people of Wales. All primary school children will now receive free school meals; there will be free childcare for all two-year-olds; and radical action to tackle the housing crisis. There will be stability payments to support family farms; exploration of an accelerated pathway to net zero by 2035; the creation of Ynni Cymru \u2013 a company to expand community-owned renewable energy generation; and a new and reformed Senedd \u2013 bigger, more diverse, and gender balanced in law. From feeding our children to caring for our elderly, this is a nation-building Programme for Government which will change the lives of thousands of people the length and breadth of our country for the better. And none of it would be happening without Plaid Cymru.\"\nIn May 2023, the publication of a report which detailed failings by the party to prevent sexual harassment and bullying led to media coverage suggesting that Price had agreed to resign the party leadership, and Price confirmed this in a statement on 10 May. Acknowledging that he \"no longer had the united support of [his] colleagues\", Price stated that he would step down officially at the start of the following week, once the process for electing a new interim leader was finalised. On 11 May Plaid Cymru announced that Llyr Gruffydd, Senedd member for North Wales, would replace him as interim party leader, and that this would be confirmed by the NEC on 13 May. On 16 June 2023 Rhun ap Iorwerth was announced as the new permanent leader after he was elected unopposed.\nAt party conference in Aberystwyth in October 2023, Rhun ap Iorwerth said the party was \"not just for Welsh speakers\". Accomplishments like free school meals with the Drakeford government were promoted.\nIndependence Commission 2020.\nBefore the 2019 general election, Price announced that he would set up a commission to look at the practicality of Welsh independence, and how a Plaid Government would hold an independence referendum. The commission, led by former Plaid Dwyfor Meirionydd MP Elfyn Llwyd, released its report on 25 September 2020. It recommends five key aims for Plaid Cymru:\nIt also recommends that there should be one multiple choice referendum to gauge views and to persuade a UK Westminster government to agree to a referendum on the preferred option.\nThe report was met with criticism from the Welsh Liberal Democrats, describing the report as a mix of \"fanatical politics\" and \"pie in the sky economics\".\nIn December 2020, Price stated that an independence referendum would be held in Plaid Cymru's first term in office, if the party won a majority at the 2021 Senedd election.\n Credit Union Limited is a savings and loans co-operative established for party members in 1986. Based in Roath, Cardiff, it is a member of the Association of British Credit Unions Limited. The credit union is authorised by the Prudential Regulation Authority and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. Ultimately, like the banks and building societies, members' savings are protected against business failure by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.\nParty leadership.\nLeaders.\nThe party leader was referred to in English as the president until March 2000, when the separate role of Leader was created.\nElection results.\nHouse of Commons.\n\"*Six seats (Blaenau Gwent, Ceredigion &amp; Pembroke North, Islwyn, Monmouth, Newport West and Torfaen) contested on a joint Plaid Cymru/Green Party ticket\"\nLocal councils.\nIn 2008, Plaid won 205 seats including six in Anglesey. For the purposes of this table the 205 figure has been reduced to 199 for the 2012 elections where the party lost 41 of the 199 seats it was defending on the night, leaving them with 158 seats.\nIn the 2013 elections in Anglesey, the party won 12 seats, up from the 6 it won in 2008 (although there were significant boundary changes and a reduction in the total number of seats from 40 to 30).\nThe 2017 figures are based on changes from the 2012 and 2013 elections. \"(Hence the slight discrepancy in the percentage increase.)\"\nEuropean Free Alliance.\nPlaid retains strong links with the Scottish National Party (SNP), with both parties' MPs co-operating closely with one another. They work as a single parliamentary group within Westminster, and were involved in joint campaigning, under the banner of a \"Celtic alliance\", during the 2001 and 2010 general elections. Both Plaid and the SNP, along with Mebyon Kernow of Cornwall, are members of the European Free Alliance (EFA), a pan-European political party for regionalist, autonomist and pro-independence political parties across Europe. The EFA co-operates with the larger European Green Party to form The Greens\u2013European Free Alliance (Greens/EFA) political group in the European Parliament, although the UK is no longer a member of the European Union.\nSections.\nPlaid Cymru has several official sections and affiliated groups, with the aim of representing all parts of wider society.

The modern English word is attested already in Old English as (with a diminutive form ). Similar words are attested later in Old Norse (, with related forms including Old Swedish , Icelandic , and Frisian ) but also in the Celtic languages (Welsh , Cornish and Irish ). Most commentators think that the word was borrowed from one of these neighbouring north-west European languages into the others, but it is not certain in what direction the borrowing went, and all vectors have been proposed by scholars. The \"Oxford English Dictionary\" favoured a Scandinavian origin, while the scholarly study by Erin Sebo of Flinders University argues for an Irish origin, on the basis that the word is widely distributed in Irish place-names, whereas \"puck\"-place-names in English are rare and late in the areas showing Old Norse influence, and seem rather to radiate outwards from South West England, which she argues had Irish influence during the Early Middle Ages.\nAlternative names.\nPuck may also be called \"The Goodfellows\" or \"Hobgoblin\", in which \"Hob\" may substitute for \"Rob\" or \"Robin\". This goes back to the character \"Robin Goodfellow\" and his name. The name \"Robin\" is Middle English in origin, deriving from Old French , the pet form for the name Robert. Similar to the use of \"the good folk\" in describing fairies, it reflected a degree of wishful thinking and an attempt to appease the fairies, recognizing their fondness of flattery despite their mischievous nature.\nThe earliest reference to \"Robin Goodfellow\" cited by the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" is from 1531. Anthony Munday mentions Robin Goodfellow in his play \"The Two Italian Gentlemen\", 1584, and he appears in \"Skialtheia, or a Shadowe of Truth\" in 1598. William Shakespeare may have had access to the manuscript of Lewes Lewkenor's translation of \"The Spanish Mandevile of Miracles, or, The Garden of Curious Flowers\" (1600), a translation of Antonio de Torquemada's . The following passage from \"The Spanish Mandeville\" discusses the mischievous spirits:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Luduvico: I pray you let me somewhat understand your opinion as concerning Robingoodfellowes and Hobgoblins, which are said to be so common, that there is scarcely any man but will tell you one tale or other of them, of which for my own part, I believe none, but do make reckoning that every man forgeth herein, what pleaseth him.\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Antonio: Many of them without doubt are forged, and many also true, for these kinds of Spirits are more familiar and domestical than the others, and for some causes to us unknown, abide in one place, more than in another, so that some never almost depart from some particular houses, as though they were their proper mansions, making in them sundry noises, rumours, mockeries, gawdes and jests, without doing any harm at all: and though I am not myself witness thereof, yet I have heard many persons of credit affirm that they have heard them play as it were on Gyterns &amp; Jews Harps, and ring Bells, and that they answer to those that call them, and speak with certain signs, laughters and merry gestures, so that those of the house come at last to be so familiar and well acquainted with them that they fear them not at all. But in truth, as I said before, if they had free power to put in practice their malicious desire, we should find these pranks of theirs, not to be jests, but earnest indeed, tending to the destruction of both our body and soul, but as I told you before, this power of theirs is so restrained and tied, that they can pass no farther than to jests and gawdes: and if they do any harm or hurt at all, it is certain very little, as by experience we daily see.\nAfter Giacomo Meyerbeer's successful opera \"Robert le Diable\" (1831), neo-medievalists and occultists began to apply the name \"Robin Goodfellow\" to the Devil, with appropriately extravagant imagery.\nCharacteristics.\nAccording to \"Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable\" (1898):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\n[Robin Goodfellow is a] \"drudging fiend\", and merry domestic fairy, famous for mischievous pranks and practical jokes. At night-time he will sometimes do little services for the family over which he presides. The Scots call this domestic spirit a brownie; the Germans, Kobold or Knecht Ruprecht. Scandinavians called it Niss\u00eb God-dreng. Puck, the jester of Fairy-court, is the same.\nPuck might do minor housework, quick fine needlework or butter-churning, which could be undone in a moment by his knavish tricks if displeased. A domestic spirit, he would assist housewives with their chores, in expectation of an offering of white bread and milk. If this were neglected he would steal that which he believed was owed.\nPucks are also known to be inherently solitary creatures. Shakespeare's characterization of \"shrewd and knavish\" Puck in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" may have revived flagging interest in Puck.\nNotable cultural references.\nThis list excludes Shakespearean references.

He is the first of the main fairy characters to appear, and he significantly influences events in the play.

Oberon sends Puck to fetch a particular flower, whereof the juice \"on sleeping eyelids laid / Will make or man or woman madly dote / Upon the next live creature that it sees\" (2.1.170\u201372). Puck is told to apply some of it to the \"disdainful youth\" (2.1.261) in \"Athenian garments\" (2.1.264), but Puck mistakes Lysander for Demetrius and applies it to Lysander. Oberon applies some of the juice to Titania, and Titania is waked by a singing Nick Bottom, whose head Puck has changed to that of an ass. Later, Puck is ordered to rectify his mistake with Lysander and Demetrius, and he creates a black fog through which he separates the \"testy rivals\" (3.2.358), imitating their voices until they are asleep.

There are designs made for use on an ice surface, such as in ice hockey, and others for the different variants of floor hockey which includes the wheeled skate variant of inline hockey ( roller hockey). They are all designed to serve the same function a ball does in ball games.\nA closed disk hockey puck having the shape of a short cylinder made of vulcanized rubber is used in the sport of ice hockey. Hockey pucks are designed for use on either an ice surface, dry floor, or underwater, though open disk designs have only been used on floors.\nOpen disk hockey pucks have a hole, forming the shape of a toroid, for use in a particular style of floor hockey. They should not be confused with ringette rings, which are toruses, for use in the sport of ringette. \nThis article deals chiefly with the sport and game pucks which are closed disks.\nEtymology.\nThe origin of the word \"puck\" is vague. The Oxford English Dictionary suggests the name is related to the verb \"to puck\" (a cognate of \"poke\") used in the games of shinty and hurling for striking or pushing the ball, from the Scottish Gaelic \"puc\" or the Irish \"poc\", meaning \"to poke, punch or deliver a blow\":\nIt is possible that settlers of Nova Scotia, many of whom were Scottish and Irish who played shinty and hurling, may have introduced the word to Canada. This is supported by the prevalent use in Canada of the word \"shinny\" for an informal or \"pick-up\" game of hockey, which is also derived from the Scottish game of shinty. The first known printed reference was in Montreal, in 1876 (\"Montreal Gazette\" of February 7, 1876), just a year after the first indoor game was played there.\nA hockey puck is also referred to colloquially as a \"biscuit\". To put the \"biscuit in the basket\" (colloquial for the goal) is to score a goal.\nIn ice hockey.\nIce hockey requires a hard disk of vulcanized rubber. A standard ice hockey puck is black, thick, in diameter, and weighs between ; some pucks are heavier or lighter than standard &lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;. Pucks are often marked with silkscreened team or league logos on one or both faces. Pucks are frozen before the game to reduce bouncing during play.\nHistory.\nThe first hockey pucks.\nThe first hockey pucks were made from frozen cow dung and leather liver pads. These early pucks had a lifespan of about one game before they were too soft or too hard for playability, so they were replaced with wooden pucks.\nBall games on ice.\nThe sport of bandy, prior to its first official organization in Britain, had its informal variants spread to North America where they and game concepts from lacrosse, shinty and hurling served as precursors in some format to ice hockey. These informal games utilized various types of balls while being played on ice until the latter half of 19th century Canada, after which the game of ice hockey and the ice hockey puck began to take their official shape and form.\nShape and material.\nBy the 1870s, flat pucks were made of wood as well as rubber. Records from the first indoor ice hockey game (1875) used a wooden puck, to prevent it from leaving the area of play though new evidence has shown that cuts from large corks have also been used.\nAt first, pucks (of either material) were made in the shape of a square. Rubber pucks were first made by slicing a rubber ball, then trimming the disk square. The original puck used first in the first organized games in Kingston on March 10, 1886 (on display at the Original Hockey Hall of Fame), was made from a cut-down lacrosse ball. It looks like a lump of coal, is made from soft rubber, and bounces far more than a modern hockey puck.\nThe Victoria Hockey Club of Montreal is credited with making and using the first round pucks, in the 1880s.\nVariations.\nThere are several variations on the standard black, hockey puck. One of the most common is a blue, puck that is used for training younger players who are not yet able to use a standard puck. Heavier training pucks, typically reddish pink or reddish orange in colour, are also available for players looking to develop the strength of their shots or improve their stick handling skills. Players looking to increase wrist strength often practice with steel pucks that weigh ; these pucks are not used for shooting, as they could seriously harm other players. White pucks are used for technical handling and goaltender practice. These are regulation size and weight, but made from white rubber. The colour blend in with the ice and rink and requires higher focus on the puck, making handling of the black puck at later stage easier. A hollow, light-weight fluorescent orange puck is available for road or floor hockey. Other variants, some with plastic ball-bearings or glides, are available for use for road or roller hockey.\nTwo major developments have been devised to create better puck visibility on television broadcasts, but both were short-lived:\nFirepuck.\nThe use of a \"Firepuck\" in the early 1990s was the first attempt to improve the visibility of hockey pucks as seen on television. This invention incorporated coloured retro reflective materials of either embedded lens elements or prismatic reflectors laminated into recesses on the flat surfaces and the vertical edge of a standard hockey puck. Yellow was the preferred reflected colour. A spotlight was required to be positioned on the TV camera and focused at the centre of the viewing area.\nA short demonstration tape of the Minnesota North Stars skating with the Firepuck was shown during the period break at the 1993 NHL All-Star Game in Montreal. The International Hockey League (IHL) pursued testing the Firepuck with its inventor, Donald Klassen. The next television viewing was the IHL All-Star Game in Fort Wayne, Indiana, January 1994, where the Firepuck was used for the entire game. The IHL tested the Firepuck in two more games, and finally the East Coast Hockey League used it January 17, 1997, for their all-star game.\nThe use of the Firepuck was discontinued because of these reasons:\nThe Firepuck name was branded during the 1990s but has since been discontinued.\nSmart puck.\nThe FoxTrax \"smart puck\" was developed by the Fox television network when it held National Hockey League (NHL) broadcasting rights for the United States. The puck had integrated electronics to track its position on screen; a blue streak traced the path of the puck across the ice. The streak would turn red if the puck was shot especially hard. This was an experiment in broadcasting intended to help viewers unfamiliar with hockey to better follow the game by making the puck more visible. It was ill-received by many traditional hockey fans, but appreciated by many of the more casual viewers. The system debuted with much publicity in the NHL All-Star game at the Boston Fleet Center on January 20, 1996, but the system was shelved when Fox Sports lost the NHL broadcast rights three years later.\nBallistics.\nMost goals are scored by airborne pucks, sometimes seen to tumble through the air, on their way in to the net. \nRadar guns are commonly used to measure shot speed.\nDuring a game, pucks can reach speeds of or more when struck. The current world record is held by Denis Kulyash of KHL's Avangard Omsk, who slapped a puck at the 2011 KHL All-Star Game skills competition in St. Petersburg, Russia on 5 February 2011 with a speed of .\nZdeno Ch\u00e1ra, whose slapshot clocked in the 2013 NHL All-Star Game SuperSkills competition, broke his own earlier record.\nIn game play.\nFast-flying pucks are potentially dangerous to players and spectators. Puck-related injuries at hockey games are not uncommon. This led to the evolution of various types of protective gear for players, most notably the goaltender mask. The most notable incident involving a spectator took place on March 18, 2002, when a 13-year-old girl, Brittanie Cecil, died two days after being struck on the head by a hockey puck deflected into the crowd at an NHL game between the Calgary Flames and Columbus Blue Jackets in Columbus. This is the only known incident of this type to have occurred in the history of the league. Partly as a result of this event, the glass or plexiglass panels that sit atop the boards of hockey rinks to protect spectators have been supplemented with mesh nets that extend above the upper edge of the glass.\nManufacture.\nNHL regulation pucks were not \"required\" for professional play until the 1990\u201391 season, but were standardized for consistent play and ease of manufacture half a century earlier, by Art Ross, in 1940. Major manufacturers of pucks exist in Canada, Russia, the Czech Republic, the People's Republic of China, and Slovakia.\nThe black rubber of the puck is made up of a mix of natural rubber, antioxidants, bonding materials and other chemicals to achieve a balance of hardness and resilience. This mixture is then turned in a machine with metal rollers, where workers add extra natural rubber, and ensure that the mixing is even. Samples are then put into a machine that analyses if the rubber will harden at the right temperature. An automated apparatus, called a pultrusion machine, extrudes the rubber into long circular logs that are in diameter and then cut into thick pieces while still soft. These pre-forms are then manually put into moulds that are the exact size of a finished puck. There are up to 200 mould cavities per moulding palette, capable of producing up to 5,000 pucks per week. The moulds are then compressed. This compression may be done cold or with the moulds heated to for 18 minutes, depending on the proprietary methods of the manufacturer. They come out hard and then are allowed to sit for 24 hours. Each puck is manually cleaned with a trimmer machine to remove excess rubber. The moulding process adds a diamond cross-hatch texture around the edge of the puck for improved friction between the stick and puck for better control and puck handling.\nPractice pucks are made by a similar but faster process that uses larger pre-forms, thick, puts them into moulds automatically, and applies more pressure and heat over a shorter period of time to compress the puck into the standard size. This allows approximately twice as many pucks to be manufactured in the same time period as the more exacting production of NHL regulation pucks. Pucks are often frozen to prevent them from sticking to the ice.\nThe list of former or present-day major producers includes\nIn roller hockey.\nRoller hockey pucks, in-line hockey pucks, are similar to ice-hockey pucks but are made from plastic and thus lighter. They have small ribs protruding from their tops and bottoms which limit contact with the surface, allowing better sliding motion and less friction. These pucks typically come in light, easily visible colors: mostly commonly red, but also sometimes orange, yellow, pink, or green. Roller hockey pucks were created so inline hockey and street hockey players could play with a puck instead of a ball on surfaces such as hardwood, concrete, and asphalt.\nIn underwater hockey.\nUnderwater hockey uses a type of puck that while similar in appearance to an ice hockey puck, differs in that it has a lead core weighing approximately within a teflon, plastic or rubber coating. This makes the puck dense enough to sink in a swimming pool, though it can be lofted during passes, while affording some protection to the pool tiles.\nA smaller and lighter version of the standard puck exists for junior competition and is approximately 1\u00a0lb 12\u00a0oz (0.80\u20130.85\u00a0kg) and of similar construction to the standard puck.\nWhile there are numerous regional variations in colour, construction and materials all must conform to international regulations stipulating overall dimensions and weight. The regulations state that pucks should be a bright distinctive colour, for example high-visibility pink or orange, and that for World Championships these are the only acceptable colours.\nIn spongee.\nSpongee \"sponge hockey\", is an organized recreational cult game that emerged in Canada around the 1950s and is played in the Canadian city of Winnipeg. It gets its name from the puck that is used: instead of the hard vulcanized rubber puck used in regular ice hockey, a softer sponge puck is used. At one point, some locals referred to it as \"tweeter\" based on the sound the original pucks made. The game is a variant of ice hockey and was influenced by Canadian road-hockey and ice-hockey players playing shinny on outdoor rinks in running shoes and winter boots. The game is played in winter strictly on outdoor rinks, does not use ice skates, and has codes involving less contact. Broomball shoes are sometimes used.\nThe spongee puck originated when someone took a toy red-white-and-blue handball and cut out the center, leaving a rude approximation of a standard hockey puck. Eventually manufactured types of sponge pucks came into use, some of which were developed in Slovakia and had a spring core. Spongee pucks are softer than ice hockey pucks and have more bounce.\nIn other sports and games.\nThe term \"puck\" is sometimes also applied to similar (though often smaller) gaming discs in other sports and games, including novuss, shuffleboard, table shuffleboard, box hockey, floor hockey, and air hockey.\nAlternative uses.\nIce hockey pucks of regulation diameter and thickness may be used as mechanical vibration dampening isolators in places such as feet for light industrial air compressors, and air conditioning units because they are of regulation materials and therefore consistent manufacture, size, and shape, and are constructed of a repeatable and consistent vulcanized rubber material.\nSince the material is rubber, it may be drilled out or milled easily to a fixed depth as rubber feet or used as rubber spacer or gasket material.\nA very common use of a slotted hockey puck is as an adaptor between the metal foot of a trolley jack and the sill (rocker panel) of an automobile. The sill has a spot-welded lip which fits into the slot of the puck and would otherwise be bent or marked by the metal foot.\nIn November 2018, faculty of Oakland University in Michigan received hockey pucks and training to throw them as a possible last-ditch defense against active shooters. The American Association of University Professors distributed pucks to its 800 members, and is working with student groups to distribute an additional 1,700 pucks to students.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was discovered in December 1985 by the \"Voyager 2\" spacecraft. The name \"Puck\" follows the convention of naming Uranus's moons after characters from Shakespeare. The orbit of Puck lies between the rings of Uranus and the first of Uranus's large moons, Miranda. Puck is approximately spherical in shape and has diameter of about . It has a dark, heavily cratered surface, which shows spectral signs of water ice.\nDiscovery and naming.\nPuck\u2014the largest inner moon of Uranus\u2014was discovered from the images taken by \"Voyager 2\" on 30 December 1985. It was given the temporary designation S/1985\u00a0U\u00a01.\nThe moon was later named after the character Puck who appears in Shakespeare's \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\", a little sprite who travels around the globe at night with the fairies. In Celtic mythology and English folklore, a \"Puck\" is a mischievous sprite, imagined as an evil demon by Christians.\nIt is also designated Uranus\u00a0XV.\nPhysical characteristics.\nPuck is the largest inner moon of Uranus, orbiting inside the orbit of Miranda. It is intermediate in size between Portia (the second-largest inner moon) and Miranda (the smallest of the five major moons). Puck's orbit is located between the rings of Uranus and Miranda. Little is known about Puck aside from its orbit, radius of about , and geometric albedo in visible light of approximately 0.11.\nOf the moons discovered by the \"Voyager\u00a02\" imaging team, only Puck was discovered early enough that the probe could be programmed to image it in some detail. Images showed that Puck has a shape of a slightly prolate spheroid (ratio between axes is 0.93\u20131). Its surface is heavily cratered and is grey in color. There are three named craters on the surface of Puck, the largest being about in diameter. Observations with the Hubble Space Telescope and large terrestrial telescopes found water-ice absorption features in the spectrum of Puck.\nLittle is known about the internal structure of Puck. It is probably made of a mixture of water ice, and may have been collisionally disrupted and reaccreted as a rubble pile. The presence of a 3.0 deep 3.0 micron feature attributed to the O-H stretching mode suggests that water ice or hydrated minerals are a common component on Puck's surface. Its surface is coated with a dark material similar to that found in the main rings. The dark material is probably made of rocks or radiation-processed organics; it is possible that material spiralling inwards from Uranus's \u03bc ring coats Puck's leading hemisphere as well. Puck, as well as the other inner satellites of Uranus, is darker than the average inner Neptunian satellite, which could be either due to a higher level of solar irradiation at Uranus as opposed to Neptune, or a distinct composition. The absence of craters with bright rays implies that Puck is not differentiated, meaning that ice and non-ice components have not separated from each other into a core and mantle.\nNamed features.\nPuck has three craters named Bogle, Butz, and Lob, which are named after mischievous spirits from Scottish, German, and British folklore respectively. Details about these craters are currently unknown.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
