Portrayed by Leonard Nimoy, he is one of the three central characters in (1966\u201369), alongside Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner) and Dr. Leonard \"Bones\" McCoy (DeForest Kelley). On that series, Spock served as first officer and science officer of the starship \"Enterprise\". Spock's mixed human\u2013Vulcan heritage serves as an important plot element in many of the character's appearances. As one of the most popular \"Star Trek\" characters, Spock has made return appearances in many later installments of the franchise.\nSpock was played by Nimoy in the original \"Star Trek\" series, ', eight of the \"Star Trek\" feature films, and a two-part episode of '. Multiple actors have played the character since Nimoy; the most recent portrayal is Ethan Peck, who since 2019 has portrayed Spock at an earlier period of his career than the original series, appearing in the second season of ', in ', and as a main character in \"\". Additionally, Zachary Quinto played an alternate-reality version of Spock in the feature films \"Star Trek\" (2009), \"Star Trek Into Darkness\" (2013), and \"Star Trek Beyond\" (2016). Although the three films are set in the aforementioned alternate reality, Nimoy appears in the first two as the original timeline's Spock.\nAside from the series and films in the \"Star Trek\" franchise, Spock has also appeared in numerous novels, comics, and video games. Nimoy's portrayal of Spock made a significant cultural impact and earned him three Emmy Award nominations. His public profile as Spock was so strong that both his autobiographies, \"I Am Not Spock\" (1975) and \"I Am Spock\" (1995), were written from the viewpoint of coexistence with the character.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAppearances.\nBack story.\nBorn to the Vulcan Sarek (Mark Lenard) and the human Amanda Grayson (Jane Wyatt), Spock's backstory has been addressed during several episodes of ', the 2009 film \"Star Trek\" and '. His mixed heritage led to a troubled childhood; full-blooded Vulcan children repeatedly bullied him on their home world to incite the emotions of his human nature. For a time, he grew up alongside his older half-brother Sybok, until Sybok was cast out from Vulcan for rejecting logic. In \"\", it is revealed that Spock has a human adoptive sister, Michael Burnham. According to the episode \"Amok Time\", Spock was betrothed to T'Pring (Arlene Martel) during his childhood.\nSarek supported Spock's scientific learning and application to the Vulcan Science Academy, as mentioned in \"Journey to Babel\". In the 2009 film \"Star Trek\", Spock rejects his acceptance into the Vulcan Science Academy on the basis that they would never fully accept someone who was only half-Vulcan. Although this scene was set in the parallel timeline of that film, writer Roberto Orci stated that he felt that Spock's life had not yet been altered at this point and this scene would have occurred in the same manner prior to \"The Original Series\". Because Spock did not enter the VSA and sought to join Starfleet instead, he did not speak to his father for the following 18 years.\n\"The Cage\" and the first season.\nSpock appeared as the science officer on the USS \"Enterprise\" in the unaired first pilot for the series, \". The events of the episode were formally canonized and shown in the two-part episode \" of the , and Spock's previous 11 years of service on the \"Enterprise\" were described. Spock also appeared in the second pilot, \"Where No Man Has Gone Before\", which was broadcast initially as the third episode. During the events of that pilot, Spock became concerned at the risk to the ship posed by Lieutenant Commander Gary Mitchell (Gary Lockwood) and suggested possible solutions to Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner).\nThe earliest appearance of Spock in the series as broadcast was in \"The Man Trap\". When he needs to knock out an evil version of Kirk in \"\", he uses a Vulcan nerve pinch, marking the first appearance of that iconic move. Spock and Chief Engineer Montgomery \"Scotty\" Scott (James Doohan) work together to rejoin the good and evil versions of the Captain, which had been split following a transporter accident. During \"\", he finds himself to be the only member of the landing party to be immune to the physical effects of the disease affecting human adults on the planet. However, he realizes that he is probably a carrier and could infect the \"Enterprise\" if he were to return. Doctor Leonard McCoy (DeForest Kelley) manages to devise a cure, allowing the team to return to the ship.\nWhen Simon van Gelder enters the bridge armed with a phaser in \"Dagger of the Mind\", Spock subdues him with a nerve pinch. He later conducts a mind meld with van Gelder as part of the investigation into the activities of the nearby colony. After power to the colony is shut down, and a protective force field drops, Spock leads an away team to rescue Kirk. Spock is reunited with Christopher Pike (Sean Kenney) in \"The Menagerie\". Pike had been promoted to Fleet Captain but suffered an accident, resulting in severe burns and confining him to a wheelchair and restricting his communication to yes/no answers via a device connected to his brainwaves. Spock commits mutiny and directs the ship to travel to Talos IV, a banned planet. He recounts the events of \"The Cage\" under a tribunal to Kirk, Pike and Commodore Jose I. Mendez (Malachi Throne). As the \"Enterprise\" arrives at the planet, Mendez is revealed to be a Talosian illusion. At the same time, the real Mendez communicates from Starfleet, giving permission for Pike to be transported to the planet, and all charges against Spock are dropped.\nWhile the \"Enterprise\" is under threat in \"Balance of Terror\", Spock is accused by Lieutenant Stiles (Paul Comi) of knowing more about the Romulans than he admits when the alien's similar physical appearance is revealed. Spock hypothesizes that they are an offshoot of the Vulcan race. He saves the \"Enterprise\", manning the phaser station and saves the life of Stiles in the process. In \"The Galileo Seven\", Spock leads a landing party on the shuttlecraft \"Galileo\", which is damaged and pulled off its course before landing on the planet Taurus II. Lieutenant Boma (Don Marshall) criticizes Spock's fascination with the weaponry of the natives after the death of Lieutenant Latimer (Rees Vaughn) at their hands. After Scotty uses the power packs of the party's phasers to supply enough energy to get the damaged shuttle back into orbit, Spock decides to dump and ignite the remaining fuel to attract the attention of the \"Enterprise\". The procedure is successful and the crew on the shuttle are rescued.\nSpock encounters old acquaintance Leila Kalomi (Jill Ireland) in \"\" after joining an away team to the planet Omicron Ceti III. After being affected by mind-altering spores, Spock begins acting out of character and with overt emotion, engaging in a romantic liaison with Kalomi, whom Spock had previously rejected when she made advances toward him. The impact of the spores on him is cured after Kirk goads him into anger, and once freed of the effects, Spock is able to initiate a solution which cures the rest of the crew. Spock attempts to mind meld with the non-humanoid Horta in \"The Devil in the Dark\". Following the mind meld, Spock relays the history of the Horta and is able to create peace between the aliens and a nearby colony. Both Spock and Kirk undertake guerrilla warfare against the occupying Klingon forces on the planet Organia, prior to the establishment of the Organian Peace Treaty in \"Errand of Mercy\". To restore the timeline, he travels with Kirk back to 1930's New York City in \"The City on the Edge of Forever\". He uses technology of that period to interface with his tricorder over the course of the weeks they spend in the period before witnessing Edith Keeler's (Joan Collins) death.\nSeason two and three.\nDuring the premiere episode of the second season, \"Amok Time\", Spock begins to undergo pon farr, the Vulcan blood fever, and must mate in the next eight days or die. Kirk disobeys Starfleet orders and takes the \"Enterprise\" to the planet Vulcan so that Spock can undergo the mating ritual. When they arrive, he is reunited with T'Pring (Arlene Martel), his wife, who wishes to instead be with Stonn (Lawrence Montaigne), a full-blooded Vulcan. She demands the ritual kal-if-fee fight and selects Kirk as her champion. Kirk accepts without knowing this is a fight to the death. McCoy persuades T'Pau (Celia Lovsky) to let him hypospray Kirk to alleviate the issues with Vulcan's thinner atmosphere and make the fight fair. Spock seemingly kills Kirk in the fight. McCoy orders Kirk transported to sickbay, while Spock is told by T'Pring that it was all a game of logic which would let her be with Stonn no matter the outcome. No longer feeling the effects of the pon farr, Spock returns to the \"Enterprise\" where he discovers that McCoy had injected Kirk with a paralyzing agent which merely simulated death and that the Captain was still alive.During an encounter with the \"Nomad\" space probe in \", Spock undertakes a mind meld with the machine. Kirk stops the meld when he realizes that Spock's personality starts to be changed by the contact. Following a transporter accident which transports Kirk, McCoy, Uhura and Scotty to a Mirror Universe and swaps them with their counterparts in the episode \", they encounter a different version of Spock. Sporting a beard, he grows suspicious of the activities of the suddenly changed personnel and under Starfleet orders, attempts to kill Kirk. Mirror-Spock is knocked unconscious, and is treated by McCoy while the others head to the transporter to attempt to return to their universe. Spock awakes and mind melds with McCoy to discover why Kirk did not have him killed. Discovering what took place, he agrees to help them return and as he mans the transporter controls, Kirk implores him to take control and save not only the ship but his Terran Empire from implosion at the hands of tyrants. The switch is once again successful, and the crew members return to their relevant universes.\n\"The Motion Picture\" and the film series.\nAt the beginning of ' (1979), Spock is no longer serving in Starfleet, having resigned and returned home to pursue the Vulcan discipline of Kolinahr. Unable to complete the Kolinahr ritual after he senses the coming of V'ger, he rejoins Starfleet to aid the \"Enterprise\" crew in their mission. Spock is later promoted to captain, and is commanding officer of the \"Enterprise\" at the beginning of ' (1982). At the film's end, he transfers his \"katra\"\u00a0\u2013 the sum of his memories and experience\u00a0\u2013 to McCoy, and then sacrifices himself to save the ship and its crew from Khan Noonien Singh (Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n). The sequel, ' (1984), focuses on his crewmates' quest to recover Spock's body, learning upon arrival that he has been resurrected by the Genesis matrix after landing on the planet at the end of the previous film. At the film's conclusion, Spock's revived body is reunited with his katra. Spock is next seen in ' (1986), which depicts his recovery from the after-effects of his resurrection. After saving planet Earth with his comrades, Spock reconciles with his father who has reconsidered his opinion regarding Spock's life choices. In the film's final scene, he joins the crew of the newly commissioned USS \"Enterprise\"-A under Kirk's command. In ' (1989), Spock and the \"Enterprise\" crew confront the renegade Vulcan Sybok, Spock's half-brother. ' (1991) reunites the \"Enterprise\" crew on a mission to prevent war from erupting between the Federation and Klingon Empire. Spock serves as a special envoy to broker peace with the Klingons after a natural disaster devastates their homeworld.\n\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\".\nAfter a period during which the production team avoided mentioning some aspects of The Original Series, Spock was mentioned by name in \" in the episode \" (1990). Executive producer Michael Piller later described this one act as \"the breakthrough which allowed us to open the doors, that allowed us to begin to embrace our past\".\nSpock appears in \"\" (1991), a two-part episode of \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\". Set 75 years after the events of \"The Undiscovered Country\", the episode focuses on Federation Ambassador Spock's attempt to reunite the Romulans with their Vulcan brethren. Filming of \"The Undiscovered Country\" overlapped with production of this episode, and the episode references Spock's role in the film. While Spock's initial unification campaign fails, he chooses to remain on Romulus in secret to help the movement.\nReboot films.\n\"Star Trek\" (2009).\nSpock's next appearance in the live action \"Star Trek\" franchise is the 2009 \"Star Trek\" film. Nimoy was given approval rights over Spock's casting and supported Quinto being cast as the role. During the film's flashback, set 19 years after the events of \"\", and as depicted in the comic miniseries \"Star Trek: Countdown\", Ambassador Spock (Nimoy) promises the Romulans he will use Vulcan technology to save them from a rogue supernova that threatens to destroy their Empire. He pilots an advanced starship equipped with red matter, a powerful substance able to create artificial black holes. The mission is only partially successful, and in the aftermath, Spock is pursued into the past by Nero (Eric Bana), a Romulan driven mad by the loss of his homeworld and family, setting into motion the events of the film.\nIn the film's opening act, Nero's ship emerges in the year 2233, and through its interaction with the inhabitants, inadvertently creates an \"alternate, parallel 'Star Trek' universe\". Twenty-five years later, in the new reality, Spock's ship emerges and Nero captures him and the red matter. Stranded in the alternate past, the prime version of Spock helps the alternate, younger version of himself and Kirk (Zachary Quinto and Chris Pine, respectively) thwart Nero's attempt to destroy the Federation.\nThe film also features Jacob Kogan in several scenes depicting Spock's childhood, including his abuse at the hands of other Vulcan children due to his half-Human heritage, and his relationship with his parents (Ben Cross and Winona Ryder). The film also depicts Kirk and Spock's initial clashes at Starfleet Academy, and the gradual development of their friendship based on shared mutual respect, what the elder Spock calls \"...a friendship that will define them both in ways they cannot yet realize.\" A major change in characterization from the primary timeline is alternate Spock's involvement with alternate Uhura (Zoe Saldana), his former student. At the end of the film, the young Spock opts to remain in Starfleet while his older self stays in the altered universe to aid the few surviving Vulcan refugees, as Nero had destroyed Vulcan, Spock's home planet.\n\"Star Trek Into Darkness\" (2013).\nIn \"Star Trek Into Darkness\", Spock Prime is described as living on 'New Vulcan' while the younger Spock remains aboard the \"Enterprise\", struggling with the loss of his home world, as well as his relationships with Uhura and James T. Kirk. Spock nearly dies protecting a planet from an active volcano, but Kirk breaks the Prime Directive and saves him. Spock Prime is contacted by Spock on the \"Enterprise\", to find out details on Khan. Spock Prime initially reminds his alternate self that he will not interfere with the events in the alternate timeline. That being said, he then informs Spock that Khan was a dangerous man, and the greatest threat that the \"Enterprise\" ever faced in his own timeline, and warns that he is likely as dangerous in Spock's alternate timeline as well. When asked whether Khan was defeated, Spock Prime answers that he eventually was defeated, but at great cost (referring to the events of \"\"). When Kirk contracts radiation poisoning and dies in front of Spock (a transposed parallel of events in the prime timeline where Spock dies in front of Kirk), an enraged and vengeful Spock attempts to kill Khan to avenge Kirk before Uhura informs him that Khan's regenerative blood can revive Kirk. Nearly a year later, Spock remains as Kirk's chief science officer and executive officer as the \"Enterprise\" departs on its first five-year mission of deep-space exploration.\n\"Into Darkness\" would be Nimoy's final appearance as Spock Prime, as well as the last role of his career. He died in 2015, shortly before production began on \"Star Trek Beyond\".\n\"Star Trek Beyond\" (2016).\nIn \"Star Trek Beyond\", Spock receives word that Ambassador Spock (Spock Prime) has died. Impacted by this, Spock later tells McCoy that he intends to leave Starfleet to continue the ambassador's work on New Vulcan. At the end of the film, Spock receives a box containing some of Ambassador Spock's personal effects, and reflecting on a photograph of the older crew of the \"Enterprise\" from the series' original timeline, he chooses to remain in Starfleet.\n\"Star Trek: Discovery\".\nIn August 2018, it was announced that Ethan Peck would join the cast of \"\" as Spock in the show's second season, portraying a Spock younger than both Nimoy's and Quinto's renditions of the character, as \"Discovery\" is set several years before the Original Series and Kelvin Timeline films.\nAs of his appearances on \"Discovery\", Spock is a Lieutenant, serving under Captain Christopher Pike on the \"Enterprise\". Due to the trauma Spock suffered because of his visions of the \"Red Angel\", he is on leave from the \"Enterprise\" and under psychiatric care. His adopted sister Michael Burnham is attempting to help him recover.\nThe introduction to the second-season episode, \"If Memory Serves\", uses archival footage of Nimoy as Spock from the unaired pilot episode \"The Cage\", and the third-season episode \"Unification III\" uses archival footage of Nimoy again from the \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" episode \"\". The latter appearance is a holographic recording from the records of Jean-Luc Picard, and is shown to Michael Burnham after she travels to the 31st Century, a time in which the Romulan and Vulcan peoples remember Ambassador Spock as the cause of their reunification on the planet Ni'Var, the newly renamed Vulcan.\n\"Star Trek: Short Treks\".\nIn 2019, it was announced that the character Spock, as played by Peck would appear in two \"\", along with Captain Pike. He reprised the role in the episodes \"Q&amp;A\" and \"Ask Not\".\n\"Star Trek: Strange New Worlds\".\nIn May 2020, it was announced that Spock (Ethan Peck) would return in the series \"\" alongside Captain Pike (Anson Mount) and Number One / Una (Rebecca Romijn).\nDevelopment.\n\"The Original Series\".\nThe earliest known mention of Spock occurred during a conversation between \"Star Trek\"'s creator, Gene Roddenberry, and actor Gary Lockwood, in which Lockwood suggested Leonard Nimoy for the role. The trio had previously worked together on Roddenberry's \"The Lieutenant\", in the episode \"In the Highest Tradition\". Roddenberry agreed to the idea, but was required to audition other actors for the part. At the time, Roddenberry sought DeForest Kelley to play the doctor character in the pilot, \"The Cage\", but both NBC executives and director Robert Butler wanted Kelley to play Spock. Roddenberry offered the part to both Kelley and Martin Landau, but they both turned him down. When offered, Nimoy accepted the part, but was apprehensive about the make-up, which had not yet been determined.\nDuring an interview segment of TV Land's 40th anniversary \"Star Trek\" marathon on November 12, 2006, Leonard Nimoy stated that Gene Roddenberry's first choice to play Spock was George Lindsey. Because of the flippant way Nimoy makes the comment, it has been suggested that he was joking. The claim Lindsey was offered the role is given more credibility when Lindsey's close friend Ernest Borgnine writes in his autobiography, \"my hand to God \u2013 he turned down the part of Mr. Spock on TV's \"Star Trek\", the role that made Leonard Nimoy famous.\"\nThe character evolved from having a metal plate in his stomach, through which he ingested energy, to being a half-Martian in the original 1964 pitch, with a \"slightly reddish complexion and semi-pointed ears\". Due to Roddenberry's concern that a Mars landing might take place before the end of the series, Spock's home planet was changed. Lee Greenway conducted the initial makeup tests on Nimoy, but after four or five days, Fred Phillips was asked to take over. Phillips in turn asked John Chambers to create Spock's ears, as he was working on getting an appropriate shade of red for Spock's skin; this idea was later abandoned in favor of a yellow hue because of the effects on black and white television. Nimoy hated the ears, and Roddenberry promised him that if he was still unhappy by the 13th episode then they'd find a way to write them out. The NBC executives were also concerned, as they felt it made the character satanic.\nAt Roddenberry's insistence, Spock was the only character retained for the second pilot, \"Where No Man Has Gone Before\". However, NBC demanded that he be only a background character, and when it went to series, the tips of Spock's ears were airbrushed out on promotional materials. It was during early episodes such as \"The Corbomite Maneuver\" and \"The Naked Time\" that Nimoy came to understand the nature of the character. After eight episodes, NBC executives complained to Roddenberry that there was not enough Spock in the series; \"Spockmania\" had begun. In response, Spock was moved to a more prominent role within the series, such as taking the lead role in \"This Side of Paradise\" over Sulu. The popularity of the character caused frictions with Shatner, and rumors spread that he was going to be dropped from the show and replaced as the lead by Nimoy as Spock. A drawn out contract renegotiation at the start of resulted in Roddenberry considering whether or not to replace Nimoy and the character. Both Mark Lenard and Lawrence Montaigne were seriously considered.\nThe character continued to develop, with Nimoy creating the Vulcan salute during the filming of \"Amok Time\". This was based on a Jewish Kohen he had seen as a child. During the course of the season, a rift grew between Nimoy and Roddenberry and by the end of the year, they only spoke through formal letters. After the departure of producer Gene L. Coon and the stepping back of Roddenberry during the , Nimoy found that the writing of Spock deteriorated. In particular, he did not like the character being made a fool of during the episode \"Spock's Brain\". The interracial kiss between Kirk and Uhura in \"Plato's Stepchildren\" had been intended by the writers to be between Spock and Uhura, but Shatner persuaded them to change it.\nFor his role as Spock, Leonard Nimoy was nominated three times Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series, and is currently the only \"Star Trek\" actor to be nominated for an Emmy.\nRevival attempts and the film franchise.\nNimoy agreed to return to Spock during one of the early 1970s attempts to create a \"Star Trek\" film, entitled ', but dropped out after his likeness as Spock was used without permission to advertise Heineken beer. He was persuaded to return to the role of Spock as the lead for the planned \"Trek\" film titled ' to be directed by Philip Kaufman. When this project was killed in favor of a new television series, ', Nimoy was reportedly just offered only a recurring part by Roddenberry, so refused to appear at all. When the decision was made to turn the TV pilot script into ', director Robert Wise insisted Nimoy to return as the character, which was only accomplished by Jeffrey Katzenberg forcing Paramount to settle the dispute with Nimoy over licensing use of his image.\nAs on the series, Nimoy, calling on method acting training, would often not break character between takes.\nDissatisfied with the first Trek feature, Nimoy was reluctant to return for ' but was convinced by the promise of a dramatic death scene. Nimoy enjoyed the production of the film so much that despite his character's on-screen death he wanted to return for a sequel. The film's success allowed Nimoy to successfully negotiate to direct the next installment in addition to briefly appearing as a reanimated Spock. The resulting film, ' was successful enough that Nimoy was asked to direct once more for '. The following film of the series, the William Shatner-directed ' was initially unacceptable to Nimoy because it called for Spock to betray Kirk and side with his newly introduced half-brother Sybok. Nimoy felt his character had already come to terms with his human-side thus Sybok would have no influence on him, and forced the script to be changed before signing on. Nimoy subsequently organized ', choosing the director, writers and producers. To hand over to ' at the time of \"The Undiscovered Country\", Nimoy agreed to appear as Spock in the episode \"Unification\". Nimoy subsequently turned down the directing role on \"Star Trek Generations\" as he wanted to rework the script, and refused reprising the role of Spock for what was essentially a cameo appearance, and his character's lines were subsequently given to Scotty.\nWhen recasting the role for 2009's \"Star Trek\", Nimoy was asked his opinion. He highlighted the work of Zachary Quinto, as he felt he looked similar and could portray the inner thought process of the character. Quinto became the first actor to be cast for the film, and Nimoy agreed to return as the version of the character from the \"Prime\" universe. Nimoy said that he returned because of the enthusiasm from director J. J. Abrams and the writers, and because it made him feel appreciated. Nimoy made a final appearance as Spock in \"Star Trek Into Darkness\" as a favor to Abrams. At the time, he did not rule out returning again, but he died prior to the following film. In \"Star Trek Beyond\", Quinto's Spock mourns the loss of Spock Prime, as played by Nimoy.\nReception.\n\"Given the choice\", Nimoy said years after the show ended, \"if I had to be someone else, I would be Spock.\" He recalled, more than a decade after the show's cancellation:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The \"Star Trek\" phenomenon continues to amaze and confound me. It was incredible, and it still is, although it is gentler now than it used to be. For a time, it was hysterical\u00a0\u2013 it was so wild I had to be very careful where I went. If I went to a restaurant, I had to plan my entrances and my exits so I wouldn't be mobbed and hurt. Same thing in hotels and airports\u00a0\u2013 any public place. It isn't that hysterical any more, but it is still a potent force.\nFrom early on, the public reacted very positively\u2014even fanatically\u2014to his character, in what \"The Boston Globe\" in 1967 described as \"Spockmania\". Headshots of Spock became popular souvenirs, with the rare ones of the actor laughing the most valuable. Nimoy reported that \"within two weeks after [\"Amok Time\"], my mail jumped from a few hundred letters to 10,000 a week\". When he appeared as Spock as grand marshal of a Medford, Oregon, parade in April 1967, thousands gathered to receive autographs: \"They surged forward so quickly that I was terrified someone would be crushed to death; and then they started pressing against the bandstand so hard it began to sway beneath my feet!\" After being rescued by police, \"I made sure never to appear publicly again in Vulcan guise\", Nimoy stated.\nFans asked Nimoy questions about current events such as the Vietnam War and LSD as if he were the Vulcan scientist; one even asked the actor to lay his hands on a friend's eyes to heal them. When a biracial girl wrote asking for advice on how to deal with persecution as \"a half-breed\", Nimoy responded that young Vulcans had treated Spock similarly and that she should, as he did, \"realize the difference between popularity and true greatness\". The actor believed that the character appealed to viewers, especially teenagers, because\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Spock understands the trauma of human existence, for he is not home with earthmen or Vulcan; he can function only in the fabricated and neatly ordered society of the Enterprise. There, he knows who he is; he relates to his role very specifically, and this gives him a kind of cool.\nTo Nimoy's surprise, Spock became a sex symbol; Isaac Asimov described the character as \"a security blanket with sexual overtones\" and Nimoy reported, \"I've never had more female attention on a set before. And get this: they all want to \"touch the ears!\"\" (When a young woman asked \"Are you aware that you are the source of erotic dream material for thousands and thousands of ladies around the world?\", he replied \"May all your dreams come true\".) Nimoy speculated that Spock appealed to women because\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Down comes a stranger\u2014tall, dark, thoughtful, alien and exotic. Somewhat devilish in appearance. He has a brilliant mind, the wisdom of a patriarch and is oh, so cool.\nWith one raised eyebrow, he suggests he is above game-playing and role-playing\u2014which are just hangovers from Earth's Victorian Age\u2014that he and he alone understands the deepest needs and longings of the Earth female.\nNASA made Spock an informal mascot. Nimoy was invited to be guest of honor at the March 1967 National Space Club dinner and to take an extensive tour of the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, MD. The actor concluded from the warm and intense reception he received that astronauts like John Glenn and aerospace industry engineers, secretaries, and shareholders alike all regarded \"Star Trek\", and especially the character of Spock, as a \"dramatization of the future of their space program\".\nAn asteroid in the Eos family discovered on August 16, 1971, was named after the discoverer James B. Gibson's cat (which had been named Mr. Spock, who was likewise \"imperturbable, logical, intelligent, and had pointed ears\").\nSpock proved inspirational to many budding scientists and engineers. Nimoy has said that many of them, on meeting him, were eager to show him their work and discuss it with him as if he were a scientific peer, as opposed to an actor, photographer, and poet. His stock response in these situations was \"it certainly looks like you're headed in the right direction\".\nIn 2004, Spock was ranked number 21 in Bravo's list of The 100 Greatest TV Characters. In 2008, UGO named Spock one of the 50 greatest TV characters. According to Shatner, much of \"Star Trek\"'s acting praise and media interest went to Nimoy.\nIn 2012, IGN ranked the character Spock, as depicted in the original series and the 2009 film \"Star Trek\", as the second top character of the \"Star Trek\" universe, with Kirk in the top spot.\nIn 2016, Adam Nimoy released his documentary film \"For the Love of Spock\", about his father and his iconic character.\nIn 2017, Screen Rant ranked Spock the 5th most attractive person in the \"Star Trek\" universe, in between Michael Burnham and Seven of Nine. In 2018, they ranked Spock as one of the top 8 most powerful characters of \"Star Trek\" (including later series).\nIn 2018, CBR ranked Spock the 6th best Starfleet character of the \"Star Trek\" franchise.\nReaction to Spock's death.\n\"The Wrath of Khan\" had its first public screening at a science-fiction convention in Overland Park, Kansas on May 8, 1982, almost a month before general release. Although Paramount executives were concerned that Spock's death would set fans against the movie, the audience actually applauded after Spock's death scene. \"It was sensational. I hate to be given to superlatives but it absolutely reached everything we wanted it to. I couldn't ask for anything better,\" said co-producer Robert Sallin of the advance audience's reaction.\nCritical reaction to Spock's death was mixed. Film critic Roger Ebert lauded Spock's death: \"He makes a choice in \"Star Trek II\" that would be made only by a hero, a fool, or a Vulcan. And when he makes his decision, the movie rises to one of its best scenes, because the \"Star Trek\" stories have always been best when they centered on their characters.\" Conversely, \"The Washington Post\"'s Gary Arnold states that Spock's death \"feels like an unnecessary twist, and the filmmakers are obviously well-prepared to fudge in case the public demands another sequel.\"\nTwenty-five years later, Spock's death in \"The Wrath of Khan\" ranks number 2 on Total Film's list of 25 greatest \"Star Trek\" movie moments, and number 1 on IGN Movie's top 10 \"Star Trek\" movie moments.\n\"Star Trek\" (2009).\nTy Burr of \"The Boston Globe\" described Quinto's performance in the 2009 film as \"something special\", and stated that Nimoy's appearance \"carries much more emotion than you'd expect\". \"Slate\" said Quinto played Spock \"with a few degrees more chill\" than Nimoy brought to the original character. \"Entertainment Weekly\" said that Quinto \"...invests Spock with a new layer of chilly-smoldering sex appeal, [and] Quinto does a fantastic job of maintaining Spock's calm, no-sweat surface but getting quietly hot and bothered underneath.\"\nCultural impact.\nSpock has been parodied by, and has also been the inspiration for, pop culture works in various media. Composer/keyboardist George Duke's \"1976 Solo Keyboard Album\" features two tracks which pay homage to Spock: \"Spock Gets Funky\" and \"Vulcan Mind Probe\". Rock guitarist Paul Gilbert wrote the song \"Mr. Spock\" on his \"Space Ship One\" album. Swedish synthpop band S.P.O.C.K makes music heavily influenced by the \"Star Trek\" universe. Assuming the Spock character, Nimoy recorded a number of novelty songs, the first being \"Highly Illogical\", in which Spock pointed out the foibles of human thought, such as relationships, automobiles, and greed. A second song, \"A Visit to a Sad Planet\", was darker in tone and told the story of Spock visiting Earth in the future and discovering it had been ruined by war, violence, and environmental irresponsibility. According to comic book writer and editor Bob Budiansky, \"The Transformers\" character Shockwave was inspired by Spock. Spock's utilitarian perspective that \"the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few\" is cited in a legal decision rendered by the Texas Supreme Court. Leonard Nimoy's second-season Spock costume shirt was expected to sell at auction for over $75,000.\nSpock's physical appearance in the \"Original Series\" episode \"\" (1967) has itself spawned a trope of the \"evil twin\" archetype found in various fictional genres. In that episode, several members of the \"Enterprise\" travel to a parallel universe inhabited by evil versions of themselves. The parallel universe version of Spock is distinguished physically by his goatee. Science fiction blog io9 said that Spock's beard in the episode introduced \"the best shorthand ever for evil parallel universe duplicates\". Examples of the evil goatee's appearances in other media include the host segments of episode 611 of the TV series Mystery Science Theater 3000, Bender's \"evil twin\" Flexo in \"Futurama\", and a 2009 episode of \"The Colbert Report\" featuring Stephen Colbert and Dan Maffei wearing fake goatees while pretending to be evil versions of themselves. The name of progressive rock band Spock's Beard is a direct reference to Spock's goatee in this episode.\nFan productions.\nIn addition to television, feature films, books, and parodies, Spock has also been portrayed in non-canon fan fiction. Since 2004, the online fan production \"\" has continued the further voyages of the canceled initial series. The fan-series' creators feel \"Kirk, Spock, McCoy, and the rest should be treated as 'classic' characters like Willy Loman from \"Death of a Salesman\", Gandalf from \"The Lord of the Rings\", or even Hamlet, Othello, or Romeo. Many actors have and can play the roles, each offering a different interpretation of said character.\"\nThe fan series \"\" has featured three actors in the role of Spock. Spock was portrayed by Jeffrey Quinn for the pilot and first three episodes, by Ben Tolpin in episodes 4 and 5, and by Brandon Stacy in episodes 6 through 11. Stacy also served as a stand-in for Zachary Quinto in the 2009 \"Star Trek\" film.\nThe independent online fan series \"Star Trek Continues\" featured Todd Haberkorn as Spock in three vignettes and eleven full episodes between 2013 and 2017.\nIn scientific illustrator Jenny Parks' 2017 book \"Star Trek Cats\", Spock is depicted as an Oriental Shorthair.\n\"Spocking\" Canadian $5 notes.\nThere has been a practice of altering the portrait of Wilfrid Laurier, Canada's prime minister from 1896 to 1911, on Canadian five-dollar notes to look like Spock. After the death of Nimoy in 2015, there was an increase in that practice.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She was best known for her roles as various characters in the \"Star Trek\" franchise: Nurse Christine Chapel (in the , ', and two films of the franchise), Number One (also in the original series), Lwaxana Troi (on ' and \"\"), and the voice of most onboard computer interfaces throughout the series from 1966 to 2008. \nShe married \"Star Trek\" creator Gene Roddenberry in 1969. As his wife and given her relationship with \"Star Trek\"\u2014participating in some way in every series during her lifetime\u2014she is sometimes referred to as \"the First Lady of \"Star Trek\".\"\nEarly life and education.\nBarrett was born in Cleveland, Ohio. She began taking acting classes as a child. She graduated from Shaker Heights High School in Shaker Heights, Ohio. She went to the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Florida, then had some stage roles and arrived in Hollywood. Her father, William Hudec, was a Cleveland police officer. He was killed in the line of duty while driving a police ambulance which was struck by an Erie Passenger Train at East 91st Street and Loren Avenue on August 30, 1955. The tragedy occurred while Barrett was touring with an off-Broadway road company.\nCareer.\nBarrett was briefly seen in \"Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?\" (1957) in an ad parody at the beginning of the film, and had roles in a few films, including \"Love in a Goldfish Bowl\" (1961), \"Sylvia\" (1965), \"A Guide for the Married Man\" (1967), and \"Track of Thunder\" (1967). She worked at the Desilu Studios on several TV shows, including \"Bonanza\", \"The Untouchables\", \"The Lucy Show\", and \"The Lieutenant\" (produced by Gene Roddenberry). She received training in comedy from Lucille Ball. In 1960, she played Gwen Rutherford on \"Leave It to Beaver\".\n\"Star Trek\".\nIn various roles, Barrett participated in every incarnation of the popular science fiction \"Star Trek\" franchise produced during her lifetime, including live-action and animated versions, television and cinema, and nearly all of the time periods in which the various series have been set.\nShe first appeared in 's initial pilot, \"\" (1964), as the USS \"Enterprise\"'s unnamed first officer, \"Number One\". Barrett was romantically involved with Roddenberry, whose marriage was on the verge of failing at the time, and the idea of having an otherwise unknown woman in a leading role just because she was the producer's girlfriend is said to have infuriated NBC network executives who insisted that Roddenberry recast the role. William Shatner corroborated this in \"Star Trek Memories\", and added that female viewers at test screenings hated the character as well. Shatner said that female viewers felt she was \"pushy\" and \"annoying\" and also thought that \"Number One shouldn't be trying so hard to fit in with the men.\" Barrett often joked that Roddenberry, given the choice between keeping Mr. Spock (whom the network also hated) or the woman character, \"kept the Vulcan and married the woman, 'cause he didn't think Leonard [Nimoy] would have it the other way around\".\nWhen Roddenberry was casting for the second \"\" pilot, \"Where No Man Has Gone Before\", she changed her last name from Hudec to Barrett and wore a blond wig for the role of nurse Christine Chapel, a frequently recurring character, who was introduced in \"The Naked Time\", the sixth new episode recorded, and was known for her unrequited affection for the dispassionate Spock. Her first appearance as Chapel in film dailies prompted NBC executive Jerry Stanley to yodel \"Well, well\u2014look who's back!\" \nIn an early scene in ', viewers are informed that she has now become Doctor Chapel, a role which she reprised briefly in ', as Commander Chapel. Barrett provided several voices for \"\", including those of Nurse Chapel and a communications officer named M'Ress, an ailuroid officer who served alongside Uhura.\nBarrett returned years later in ', cast as the outrageously self-assertive, iconoclastic Betazoid ambassador, Lwaxana Troi, who appeared as a recurring character in the series, often visiting her daughter Deanna, the ship's counselor. Her character often vexed the captain of the \"Enterprise\", Jean-Luc Picard, who spurned her amorous advances. She later appeared as Ambassador Troi in several episodes of ', where her character developed a strong relationship with Constable Odo.\nShe was the regular voice of the onboard computers of Federation starships for ', ', ', ', and most of the \"Star Trek\" movies. She reprised her role as a shipboard computer's voice in two episodes of the prequel series \"\", thus making her the only actor to have a role in all six televised \"Star Trek\" series produced up to that time. She also lent her voice to various computer games and software related to the franchise. The association of her voice with interactions with computers led to Google's Assistant project being initially codenamed Google Majel. She made a point of attending a major \"Star Trek\" convention each year in an effort to inspire fans and keep the franchise alive.\nOn December 9, 2008, shortly before her death, Roddenberry Productions announced that she would be providing the voice of the ship's computer again, this time for the 2009 motion picture reboot of \"Star Trek\".\nOther roles.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Rquote/styles.css\"/&gt;{ class=\"rquote pullquote floatright\" role=\"presentation\" style=\"display:table; border-collapse:collapse; border-style:none; float:right; margin:0.5em 0.75em; width:33%; \"\nShe appeared as Primus Dominic in Roddenberry's 1973 postapocalyptic TV drama pilot, \"Genesis II\"; as Dr. Bradley in his 1974 television film \"The Questor Tapes\" and as Lilith the housekeeper in his 1977 TV drama pilot, \"Spectre\". She also appeared in Michael Crichton's 1973 sci-fi Western, \"Westworld\" as Miss Carrie, a robot brothel madam; the 1977 Stanley Kramer thriller \"The Domino Principle\"; and the 1979 television film \"The Man in the Santa Claus Suit\" starring Fred Astaire. Her later film appearances included small roles in \"Teresa's Tattoo\" (1994) and \"Mommy\" (1995).\nAfter Gene Roddenberry's death, Barrett took material from his archives to bring two of his ideas into production. She was executive producer of \"\" (in which she also played the character Dr. Julianne Belman), and \"Andromeda\". She also served as creative director for \"Gene Roddenberry's Lost Universe\", a comic book series based on another archival Roddenberry concept.\nIn a gesture of goodwill between the creators of the \"Star Trek\" franchise and of \"Babylon 5\", she appeared in the \"Babylon 5\" episode \"Point of No Return\", as Lady Morella, the psychic widow of the Centauri emperor, a role which foreshadowed major plot elements in the series. Parodying her voice work as the computer for the \"Star Trek\" series, Barrett performed as a guest voice on \"Family Guy\" as the voice of Stewie Griffin's ship's computer in the episode \"Emission Impossible\".\nBarrett's widely recognized voice performance as the \"Star Trek\" computer inspired the Amazon Alexa interactive virtual assistant, according to its developer Toni Reid, although Barrett had no direct role in it.\nFinal voiceover work.\nSome of Barrett's final voiceover work was still in post-production, to be released in 2009 after her death, as mentioned in the credits of the 2009 film \"Star Trek\", again as the voice of the \"Enterprise\" computer. An animated production called \"Hamlet A.D.D.\" credited her as Majel Barrett Roddenberry, playing the voiceover role of Queen Robot.\nPersonal life and death.\nIn 1969, while scouting locations in Japan for MGM, Roddenberry realized that he missed Barrett, and proposed to her by telephone. Herbert F. Solow said that Roddenberry traveled to Japan with the intention of marrying Barrett. Barrett joined Roddenberry in Tokyo, where they were married in a Shinto ceremony on August 6, 1969. Roddenberry considered it \"sacrilegious\" to have an American minister in Japan perform the ceremony. The wedding was attended by two Shinto priests as well as maids of honor. Roddenberry and Barrett both wore kimonos; on their honeymoon they toured Japan. Roddenberry continued to have liaisons with other women, telling his friends that while in Japan, he had an encounter with a masseuse about a week after he was married.\nThe new marriage was not legally binding, as his divorce from Eileen had not yet been finalized. This was resolved two days after his divorce was complete, and on December 29, a small ceremony was held at their home, followed by a reception for family and friends. Despite that, the couple continued to celebrate August 6 as their wedding anniversary. Roddenberry's young daughter, Dawn, decided to live with him and Barrett and the family moved to a new house in Beverly Hills in October 1970. In February 1974, Barrett and Roddenberry had a son, Eugene Jr., known as Rod Roddenberry. They remained married until Gene's death at Barrett's side on October 24, 1991, in Santa Monica, California.\nAfter her husband's death, Barrett-Roddenberry commissioned Celestis to launch her together with Gene on an infinite mission to deepest space. After putting them on the manifest for NASA's \"Sunjammer\" mission, the agency cancelled the mission in 2014. Celestis rescheduled a launch for 2020, then later rescheduled it for June 2022, the next available commercial mission to deep space. A sample of the couple's cremated remains would be sealed into a specially made capsule designed to withstand space travel. A spacecraft will carry the capsule along with digitized tributes from fans, on Celestis' \"Enterprise Flight\". The flight also would contain the ashes of Nichelle Nichols and Douglas Trumbull. The Celestis \"Enterprise Flight\" was successfully launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida on January 8, 2024.\nBarrett-Roddenberry died on the morning of December 18, 2008, at her home in Bel Air, Los Angeles, California, as a result of leukemia. She was 76 years old. A public funeral was held on January 4, 2009, in Los Angeles. More than 250 people attended, including Nichelle Nichols, George Takei, Walter Koenig, Marina Sirtis, Brent Spiner, and Wil Wheaton.\nHonors.\nBarrett and her husband were honored in 2002 by the Space Foundation with the Douglas S. Morrow Public Outreach Award for their work creating awareness of and enthusiasm for space.\nAmazon code-named the project which eventually became Alexa as \"Majel\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Heinlein\nTo Sail Beyond the Sunset is a science fiction novel by American writer Robert A. Heinlein, published in 1987. It was the last novel published before his death in 1988. The title is taken from the poem \"Ulysses\", by Alfred Tennyson. The stanza of which it is a part, quoted by a character in the novel, is as follows:\n&lt;poem&gt;\n... my purpose holds\nTo sail beyond the sunset, and the baths\nOf all the western stars, until I die.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nIt is the final part of the \"Lazarus Long\" cycle of stories, involving time travel, parallel dimensions, free love, voluntary incest, and a concept that Heinlein named pantheistic solipsism, or 'World as Myth': the theory that universes are created by the act of imagining them, so that somewhere (for example) the Land of Oz is real. Other books in the cycle include \"Methuselah's Children\", \"Time Enough for Love\", \"The Number of the Beast\", and \"The Cat Who Walks Through Walls\".\nPlot.\nThe book is a memoir of Maureen Johnson Smith Long, mother, lover, and eventual wife of Lazarus Long. Maureen is ostensibly recording the events of the book while held in prison alongside Pixel, the cat from \"The Cat Who Walks Through Walls\".\nMaureen, born on July 4, 1882, recounts her girlhood in backcountry Missouri, discovery that her family is a member of the long-lived Howard Families (whose backstory is revealed in \"Methuselah's Children\"), marriage to Brian Smith, another member of that group, and her life\u2014largely in Kansas City\u2014until her apparent death in 1982. In addition, Maureen lives through, and gives her (sometimes contradictory) viewpoints on many events in other Heinlein stories, most notably the 1917 visit from the future by \"Ted Bronson\" (Lazarus Long), told from Long's point of view in \"Time Enough for Love\", D. D. Harriman's space program from \"The Man Who Sold the Moon\", and the rolling roads from \"The Roads Must Roll\".\nMaureen's adventures include a series of sexual encounters, beginning in childhood wherein, having just had her first sexual intercourse, she is examined by her father, a doctor, and finds herself desiring him sexually. Her story then encompasses various boys, her husband, ministers, other women's husbands, boyfriends, swinging sessions, and the adult Lazarus Long/Theodore Bronson. Additionally, she continues a lifelong pursuit of her father sexually, encourages her husband to have sexual intercourse with their daughters, and accompanies him when he does; but forbids a son and daughter of hers from continuing an incestuous relationship, primarily for the sister's reluctance to share the brother with other women. All of these are set against a history lesson of an alternate 20th century in which a variety of social and philosophical commentary is delivered.\nShe is eventually rescued from prison by Lazarus Long and other characters of various novels in the ship \"Gay Deceiver\" (from \"The Number of the Beast\"), and after rescuing her father from certain death in the Battle of Britain, is united with her descendants in a massive group marriage in the settlement of Boondock, on the planet Tertius. Maureen ends her memoir and the Lazarus Long saga with the phrase \"And we all lived happily ever after\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Heinlein\nDouble Star is a science fiction novel by American writer Robert A. Heinlein, first serialized in \"Astounding Science Fiction\" (February, March, and April 1956) and published in hardcover the same year. It received the 1956 Hugo Award for Best Novel (his first).\nPlot summary.\nThe novel is set in a future when the Moon, Mars, Venus and Jupiter's moons have been colonized and the Solar System is governed by a parliamentary democracy under a constitutional monarchy from a capital city on the Moon. The indigenous alien race inhabiting Mars has recently been admitted to citizenship in the human-dominated solar system government.\nThe story, which is told in the first person, centers on down-and-out actor Lawrence Smith (stage name Lorenzo Smythe, also known as \"The Great Lorenzo\"). A brilliant actor and mimic, he is down to his last coin when a spaceman hires him to double for an unspecified public figure. It is only when he is on his way to Mars that he finds out he will have to impersonate one of the most prominent politicians in the Solar System, and one with whose views Smith deeply disagrees\u00a0\u2014 John Joseph Bonforte. Bonforte is the leader of the Expansionist coalition, currently out of office, but with a good chance of changing that at the next general election. Bonforte has been kidnapped by his political opponents, and his aides want Smith to impersonate Bonforte while they try to find him.\nBonforte is rescued, but he is in poor health due to his treatment during his imprisonment. This forces Smith to extend his performance, even to becoming temporary Prime Minister and running in an election. This is made possible only through the use of Bonforte's extensive Farley files. The central political issue in the election is the granting of suffrage to Martians in the human-dominated Solar System. Lorenzo shares the anti-Martian prejudice prevalent among large parts of Earth's population, but he is called upon to assume the persona of the most prominent advocate of Martian enfranchisement. Smith takes on not only Bonforte's appearance, but some aspects of his personality.\nAt the moment of electoral victory, Bonforte dies of the aftereffects of his kidnapping, and Smith is asked to assume the role for life. In a retrospective conclusion set twenty-five years later, Smith reveals that he wrote the first-person narrative as therapy. By this point, he views his early life and ambitions as almost those of someone else. He has applied Bonforte's ideals in his political career to the best of his ability. Bonforte's adoring secretary and now Smith's wife, Penny, says, \"she never loved anyone else.\"\nCritical reception.\nThe noted science-fiction writer and critic James Blish was no fan of Heinlein's treatment of his first-person protagonists in a number of his novels. Writing in 1957, however, Blish says that \"The only first-person narrator Heinlein has created who is a living, completely independent human being is The Great Lorenzo of \"Double Star\". Lorenzo is complete all the way back to his childhood\u2014the influence of his father upon what he thinks is one of the strongest motives in the story\u2014and his growth under pressure is consistent with his character and no-one else's.\"\n\"Galaxy\" reviewer Floyd C. Gale praised the novel, finding it \"an excellent example of Heinlein's ability to take one of the oldest plots in any literature ... and present it as an enjoyable reading experience.\" Admitting \"a certain reservation, even disappointment,\" Anthony Boucher nevertheless concluded that Heinlein was \"simply creating an agreeably entertaining light novel, and in that task he succeeds admirably.\"\nAt the 1957 Worldcon it received the Hugo Award for Best Novel (Heinlein's first).\nIn 2012, the novel was included in the Library of America two-volume boxed set \"American Science Fiction: Nine Classic Novels of the 1950s\", edited by Gary K. Wolfe.\nCover controversy.\nThe cover illustration by Anthony Roberts for a 1970s UK edition of \"Double Star\" was the subject of an unlikely controversy when it was used as the basis of an entry for the 2000 Turner Prize for modern art. The artist in question, Glenn Brown, was accused of plagiarism."}

Heinlein\nTime for the Stars is a juvenile science fiction novel by American writer Robert A. Heinlein, published by Scribner's in 1956 as one of the Heinlein juveniles. The basic plot line is derived from a 1911 thought experiment in special relativity, commonly called the twin paradox, proposed by French physicist Paul Langevin.\nPlot summary.\nThe Long Range Foundation (LRF), a non-profit organization that funds expensive, long-term projects for the benefit of mankind that nobody else will even consider, has built a dozen exploratory torchships to search for habitable planets to colonize. The vessels can continually accelerate, but cannot exceed the speed of light, so the voyages will last many years. Each starship has a much larger crew than necessary to maintain a more stable, long-term shipboard society, as well as to provide replacements for the inevitable deaths.\nThe LRF has found that some twins and triplets can communicate with each other telepathically. The process seems instantaneous and unaffected by distance, making it the only practical means of communication for ships traveling many light-years away from Earth. Before announcing the discovery, the Foundation first recruits as many of these people as it can. Testing shows that teenagers Tom and Pat Bartlett have this talent, and both sign up. Pat, the dominant twin, manipulates things so that he gets selected as the crew member, much to Tom's annoyance. However, Pat does not really want to leave, and his subconscious engineers a convenient accident so that Tom has to take his place at the last minute.\nOn board, Tom is pleased to find that his uncle Steve, a soldier, has arranged to get assigned to the same ship. The trip is fraught with problems - as trivial as an annoying roommate and as serious as mutiny. The ship visits several star systems, including Beta Hydri. Due to the nature of relativistic travel (see twin paradox), the twin who remained behind ages faster and eventually the affinity between them weakens to the point where they can no longer communicate easily. Some of the spacefaring twins, including the protagonist, are able to connect with descendants of the Earth-based twins. Tom works first with his niece, then his grandniece, and finally his great-grandniece.\nThe last planet scouted proves particularly deadly. Unexpectedly intelligent and hostile natives capture and kill a large portion of the remaining crew, including the captain and Tom's uncle. The reserve captain takes charge, but is unable to restore the morale of the devastated survivors. When he insists on continuing the mission rather than returning to Earth, members of the crew begin to consider mutiny. Shortly after the new captain notifies Earth of the dire situation, the crew learn to their surprise that a spaceship will rendezvous with them in less than a month; they surmise it must be a much more advanced spaceship. Scientists on Earth have discovered faster-than-light travel, in part due to research into the nature of telepathy, and are collecting the surviving crews of the torchships. They are returned to an Earth they no longer recognize, and in most cases, no longer fit into. Tom, however, returns to marry his latest telepathic partner, his own great-grandniece, who states she has been reading his mind since childhood.\nReception.\n\"Galaxy\" reviewer Floyd C.

Heinlein, originally serialized in \"Astounding Science Fiction\" (September, October, November, and December 1957) and published in hardcover in 1957 as one of the Heinlein juveniles by Scribner's. The story is heavily influenced by Rudyard Kipling's \"Kim\".\nPlot summary.\nThe novel is set in a future in which the human race has developed interstellar spaceflight and is engaged in trade with a number of alien races. However, human slavery has reappeared on some planets. The Hegemonic Guard, the space military force of the human government, tries to enforce the law and fight the slave trade.\nThorby is a young, defiant boy who is purchased at a slave auction on the planet Jubbul by an old beggar, Baslim the Cripple, for a trivial sum and taken to the beggar's surprisingly well-furnished underground home. Thereafter, Baslim treats the boy as a son, teaching him not only the trade of begging, but also mathematics, history, and several languages, while sending Thorby on errands all over the city. Thorby slowly realizes that his foster father is not a simple beggar, but is gathering intelligence, particularly on the slave trade. In addition, Baslim has Thorby memorize a contingency plan and a message to deliver to any of five starship captains in the event of Baslim's arrest or death. Baslim is arrested for spying, but commits suicide before he can be questioned. While the local police carry out a manhunt for Thorby, he delivers the message to Captain Krausa of the starship \"Sisu\". Because the \"Free Traders\", to whom Krausa belongs, owe a debt to Baslim for the rescue of one of their crews from a slaver, the captain takes Thorby aboard at great risk to himself and his clan.\nThe Free Traders have an insular, clannish, matriarchal culture. They live aboard spaceships, traveling from world to world to trade. Thorby is formally adopted by the captain (thereby gaining considerable shipboard social status) and adjusts to their ways, learning their language and intricate social rules. The advanced education provided by Baslim and the fast reflexes of youth make him an ideal fire controlman; Thorby saves \"Sisu\", destroying a pirate craft bent on enslaving the crew. His immediate superior, a young woman named Mata, begins to view him as husband material, taboo by Free Trader custom because they are in the same moiety, so she is transferred to another ship.\nThe captain's wife, who is also the executive officer and the actual head of the clan, wants to use Thorby's connection to Baslim to enhance \"Sisu\"'s prestige by marrying him off to a woman from another powerful clan. Captain Krausa, however, obeys Baslim's last wish by delivering the boy to a military cruiser of the Hegemonic Guard of the Terran Hegemony, the dominant military power in the galaxy. The captain, who was one of Baslim's couriers, passes along Baslim's request that the Guard help reunite Thorby with his family, if that is possible. Thorby discovers that Baslim was actually a colonel in the Hegemonic Guard who volunteered to spy on Jubbul to fight slavery. In order to avoid paying for a costly background search, Thorby agrees to enlist in the Hegemonic Guard.\nThorby is ultimately identified as Thor Bradley Rudbek, the long-lost primary heir of a very powerful, extremely wealthy family which controls Rudbek and Associates, a large, sprawling interstellar conglomerate. In his absence, the business has been run by a relative by marriage, \"Uncle\" John Weemsby, who encourages his stepdaughter Leda to help Thorby adjust to his new situation while secretly scheming to block Thorby's growing interest and interference in the company.\nThorby, investigating his parents' disappearance and his capture and sale by slavers, comes to suspect that his parents were eliminated to prevent the discovery that some subsidiaries of Rudbek and Associates were secretly supporting (and profiting from) the slave trade. When Weemsby quashes further investigation, Thorby seeks legal help and launches a proxy fight, which he unexpectedly wins when Leda votes her shares in his favor. He fires Weemsby and assumes full control of the firm. When Thorby realizes that extricating Rudbek and Associates from the slave trade is a monumental task, he reluctantly abandons his dream of following in Baslim's footsteps and joining the elite anti-slaver \"X\" Corps of the Hegemonic Guard.

Heinlein\nStranger in a Strange Land is a 1961 science fiction novel by the American author Robert A. Heinlein. It tells the story of Valentine Michael Smith, a human who comes to Earth in early adulthood after being born on the planet Mars and raised by Martians, and explores his interaction with and eventual transformation of Terran culture.\nThe title \"Stranger in a Strange Land\" is a direct quotation from the King James Bible (taken from Exodus 2:22). The working title for the book was \"A Martian Named Smith\", which was also the name of the screenplay started by a character at the end of the novel.\nHeinlein's widow Virginia arranged to have the original unedited manuscript published in 1991, three years after Heinlein's death. Critics disagree about which version is superior.\n\"Stranger in a Strange Land\" won the 1962 Hugo Award for Best Novel and became the first science fiction novel to enter \"The New York Times Book Review\"'s best-seller list. In 2012, the Library of Congress named it one of 88 \"Books that Shaped America\".\nPlot.\nPrior to World War III, the crewed spacecraft \"Envoy\" is launched toward Mars, but all contact is lost shortly before landing. Twenty-five years later, the spacecraft \"Champion\" makes contact with the inhabitants of Mars and finds a single survivor, Valentine Michael Smith. Born on the \"Envoy\", he was raised entirely by the Martians. He is ordered by them to accompany the returning expedition.\nSmith is confined at Bethesda Hospital, where, having never seen a human female, he is attended by male staff only. Seeing that restriction as a challenge, Nurse Gillian Boardman eludes the guards and goes in to see Smith. By sharing a glass of water with him, she inadvertently becomes his first \"water brother\", a profound relationship by Martian standards, as water on Mars is extremely scarce.\nGillian's lover, reporter Ben Caxton, discovers that Smith is extremely wealthy. Ben is seized by the government, and Gillian persuades Smith to leave the hospital with her. Gillian takes Smith to Jubal Harshaw, a famous author, physician and lawyer. Eventually, Harshaw arranges freedom for Smith and recognition that human law, which would have granted ownership of Mars to Smith, has no applicability to a planet that is already inhabited by intelligent life.\nSmith becomes a celebrity and is feted by the Earth's elite. He investigates many religions, including the Fosterite Church of the New Revelation, a populist megachurch in which sexuality, gambling, alcohol consumption, and similar activities are allowed and even encouraged and considered \"sinning\" only when they are not under church auspices. Smith has a brief career as a magician in a carnival, in which he and Gillian befriend the show's tattooed lady.\nSmith starts a Martian-influenced \"Church of All Worlds\", combining elements of the Fosterite cult with Western esotericism. The church is besieged by Fosterites for practicing \"blasphemy\", and the church building is destroyed, but unknown to the public, Smith's followers teleport to safety.\nSmith is arrested by the police, but escapes and returns to his followers, later explaining to Jubal that his gigantic fortune has been bequeathed to the church. With that wealth and their new abilities, church members will be able to reorganize human societies and cultures.\nSmith is killed by a mob raised against him by the Fosterites. Jubal and some of the church members return to Jubal's home to regroup and prepare to found new Church of All Worlds congregations. Smith reappears in the afterlife to replace the Fosterites' founder, amid hints that Smith was an incarnation of the Archangel Michael.\nCharacters.\nHeinlein named his main character \"Smith\" because of a speech he made at a science fiction convention regarding the unpronounceable names assigned to extraterrestrials. After describing the importance of establishing a dramatic difference between humans and aliens, Heinlein concluded, \"Besides, whoever heard of a Martian named Smith?\" The title \"Stranger in a Strange Land\" is taken from the King James Version of Exodus 2:22, \"And she bore him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land\".\nIn the preface to the uncut, original version of the book reissued in 1991, Heinlein's widow, Virginia, wrote: \"The given names of the chief characters have great importance to the plot. They were carefully selected: Jubal means 'the father of all,' Michael stands for 'Who is like God?'\".\nDevelopment.\nOriginally titled \"The Heretic\", the book was written in part as a deliberate attempt to challenge social norms. In the course of the story, Heinlein uses Smith's open-mindedness to re-evaluate such institutions as religion, money, monogamy, and the fear of death. Heinlein completed writing it ten years after he had plotted it out in detail. He later wrote, \"I had been in no hurry to finish it, as that story could not be published commercially until the public mores changed. I could see them changing and it turned out that I had timed it right.\"\nHeinlein got the idea for the novel when he and his wife Virginia were brainstorming one evening in 1948. She suggested a new version of Rudyard Kipling's \"The Jungle Book\" (1894), but with a child raised by Martians instead of wolves. He decided to go further with the idea and worked on the story on and off for more than a decade, believing that contemporary society was not yet ready for it.\nHeinlein was surprised that some readers thought the book described how he believed society should be organized, explaining: \"I was \"not\" giving answers. I was trying to shake the reader loose from some preconceptions and induce him to think for himself, along new and fresh lines. In consequence, each reader gets something different out of that book because he himself supplies the answers ... It is an invitation to think \u2013 not to believe.\"\nHis editors at Putnam required him to cut its 220,000-word length down to 160,000 words before publication.\nHeinlein himself remarked in a letter he wrote to Oberon Zell-Ravenheart in 1972 that he thought his shorter, edited version was better. Heinlein also added some new material to the shorter version.\nThe book was dedicated in part to science fiction author Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer, who had explored sexual themes in works such as \"The Lovers\" (1952). It was also influenced by the satiric fantasies of James Branch Cabell.\nReception.\nHeinlein's deliberately provocative book generated considerable controversy. The free love and commune living aspects of the Church of All Worlds led to the book's exclusion from school reading lists. After it was rumored to be associated with Charles Manson, it was removed from school libraries, as well.\nWriting in \"The New York Times\", Orville Prescott received the novel caustically, describing it as a \"disastrous mishmash of science fiction, laborious humor, dreary social satire, and cheap eroticism\"; he characterized \"Stranger in a Strange Land\" as \"puerile and ludicrous\", saying \"when a non-stop orgy is combined with a lot of preposterous chatter, it becomes unendurable, an affront to the patience and intelligence of readers\". \"Galaxy\" reviewer Floyd C. Gale rated the novel 3.5 stars out of five, saying \"the book's shortcomings lie not so much in its emancipation as in the fact that Heinlein has bitten off too large a chewing portion\".\nDespite such reviews, \"Stranger in a Strange Land\" won the 1962 Hugo Award for Best Novel and became the first science fiction novel to enter \"The New York Times Book Review\"'s best-seller list. In 2012, it was included in a Library of Congress exhibition of \"Books That Shaped America\".\nCritics have also suggested that Jubal Harshaw is actually a stand-in for Robert Heinlein himself, based on similarities in career choice and general disposition, though Harshaw is much older than Heinlein was at the time of writing. Literary critic Dan Schneider wrote that Harshaw's belief in his own free will, was one \"which Mike, Jill, and the Fosterites misinterpret as a pandeistic urge, 'Thou art God!'\"\nInfluence.\nThe book significantly influenced modern culture in a variety of ways.\nChurch of All Worlds.\nA central element of the second half of the novel is the religious movement founded by Smith, the \"Church of All Worlds\", an initiatory mystery religion blending elements of paganism and revivalism, with psychic training and instruction in the Martian language. In 1968, Oberon Zell-Ravenheart (then Tim Zell) founded the Church of All Worlds, a Neopagan religious organization modeled in many ways after the fictional organization in the novel. The spiritual path included several ideas from the book, including polyamory, non-mainstream family structures, social libertarianism, water-sharing rituals, an acceptance of all religious paths by a single tradition, and the use of several terms such as \"grok\", \"Thou art God\", and \"Never Thirst\".\nHeinlein objected to Zell's lumping him with other writers such as Ayn Rand and Robert Rimmer; Heinlein felt that those writers used their art for propaganda purposes, while he simply asked questions of the reader, expecting each reader to answer for him- or herself. He wrote to Zell in a letter: \"... each reader gets something different out of the book because he himself supplies the answers. If I managed to shake him loose from some prejudice, preconception or unexamined assumption, that was all I intended to do.\"\nThough Heinlein was neither a member nor a promoter of the Church, it was formed including frequent correspondence between Zell and Heinlein, and Heinlein was a paid subscriber to the Church's magazine \"Green Egg\". This Church still exists as a 501(c)(3) recognized religious organization incorporated in California, with membership worldwide, and it remains an active part of the neopagan community.\nGrok.\nThe word \"grok\", coined in the novel, made its way into the English language. In Heinlein's invented Martian language, \"grok\" literally means \"to drink\" and figuratively means \"to comprehend\", \"to love\", and \"to be one with\". The word rapidly became common parlance among science fiction fans, hippies, and later computer programmers and hackers, and has since entered the \"Oxford English Dictionary\".\nFair Witness.\nThe profession of Fair Witness, invented for the novel, has been cited in such varied contexts as environmentalism, psychology, technology, digital signatures, and science, as well as in books on leadership and Sufism. A Fair Witness is an individual trained to observe events and report exactly what is seen and heard, making no extrapolations or assumptions. While wearing the Fair Witness uniform of a white robe, they are presumed to be observing and opining in their professional capacity. Works that refer to the Fair Witness emphasize the profession's impartiality, integrity, objectivity, and reliability.\nAn example from the book illustrates the role of Fair Witness when Anne is asked what color a house is. She answers, \"It's white on this side.\" The character Jubal then explains, \"You see? It doesn't occur to Anne to infer that the other side is white, too. All the King's horses couldn't force her to commit herself... unless she went there and looked \u2013 and even then she wouldn't assume that it stayed white after she left.\"\nWaterbed.\n\"Stranger in a Strange Land\" contains an early description of the waterbed. An inventor who attempted to patent the waterbed was initially refused on the grounds that Heinlein's description in \"Stranger in a Strange Land\" constituted prior art.\nPublication history.\nTwo major versions of this book exist:\nHeinlein himself remarked in a letter he wrote to Oberon Zell-Ravenheart in 1972 that he thought his shorter, edited version was better. He wrote, \"\"SISL\" was never censored by anyone in any fashion. The first draft was nearly twice as long as the published version. I cut it myself to bring it down to a commercial length. But I did not leave out anything of any importance; I simply trimmed all possible excess verbiage. Perhaps you have noticed that it reads 'fast' despite its length; that is why. ... The original, longest version of \"SISL\" ... is really not worth your trouble, as it is the same story throughout \u2013 simply not as well told. With it is the brushpenned version which shows exactly what was cut out \u2013 nothing worth reading, that is. I learned to write for pulp magazines, in which one was paid by the yard rather than by the package; it was not until I started writing for the \"Saturday Evening Post\" that I learned the virtue of brevity.\"\nAdditionally, since Heinlein added material while he was editing the manuscript for the commercial release, the 1991 publication of the original manuscript is missing some material that was in the novel when it was first published.\nEditions.\nMany editions exist:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Heinlein\nGlory Road is a science fantasy novel by American writer Robert A. Heinlein, originally serialized in \"The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction\" (July \u2013 September 1963) and published in hardcover the same year. It was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1964.\nIn the novel, an unemployed war veteran with a facial scar responds to a newspaper ad and is hired to join a quest to retrieve the Egg of the Phoenix. After fighting the Egg's guardian Cyrano de Bergerac, the character and his employers retrieve the Egg and escape. The character marries his employer Star and moves with her to an alternate universe. Star is an Empress whose life has been extended indefinitely by medical treatments, and the Egg contains the knowledge and experiences of her predecessors. Bored with the life of the idle rich which he experiences, the main character returns to planet Earth and seeks another adventure. \nPlot summary.\nEvelyn Cyril \"E.C.\" Gordon (also known as \"Easy\" and \"Flash\") has been recently discharged from an unnamed war in Southeast Asia. He is pondering what to do with his future and considers spending a year traveling in France. He is presented with a dilemma: follow up on a possible winning entry in the Irish Sweepstakes or respond to a newspaper ad that asks \"Are you a coward?\". He settles on the latter, discovering it has been placed by Star, a stunningly gorgeous woman he has previously met on \u00cele du Levant. Star informs him that he is the one to embark on a perilous quest to retrieve the Egg of the Phoenix. When she asks what to call him, he wants to suggest \"Scarface\", referring to the scar on his face, but she stops him as he is saying \"Oh, Scar...\" and repeats this as \"Oscar\", and thus gives him his new name. Along with Rufo, her assistant, who appears to be a man in his fifties, they tread the \"Glory Road\" in swashbuckling style, slaying dragons and other exotic creatures.\nShortly before the final Quest for the Egg itself, Oscar and Star marry. The team then proceeds to enter the tower in which the Egg has been hidden, navigating a maze of illusions and optical tricks. Oscar scouts ahead and encounters a fearsome foe who, though unnamed, is clearly the legendary 17th-century swordsman Cyrano de Bergerac, the final guardian of the Egg. After a long fight, the party escapes with the Egg. When they arrive in the home universe of Star and Rufo, Rufo informs Oscar that Star is actually the Empress of many worlds\u2014and Rufo's grandmother.\nThe Egg is a cybernetic device that contains the knowledge and experiences of most of her predecessors. Despite her youthful appearance, she is the mother of dozens of children (by egg donation) and has undergone special medical treatments that extend her life much longer than usual. She has Oscar unknowingly receive the same treatments.\nInitially, Oscar enjoys his new-found prestige and luxurious life as the husband of the Empress of the Twenty Universes. However, as time goes on, he grows bored and feels out of place and useless. When he demands Star's professional judgment, she tells him that he must leave; her world has no place or need for a hero of his stature. It will be decades before she can complete the transfer of the knowledge held in the Egg, so he must go alone. He returns to Earth but has difficulty readjusting to his own world, despite having brought great wealth along with him. He begins to doubt his own sanity and whether the adventure even happened. The story ends as he is contacted by Rufo to set up another trip along the Glory Road.\nReception.\nSamuel R. Delany called the novel \"endlessly fascinating\" and said that it \"maintains a delicacy, a bravura, and a joy\". The novel's second half has been praised as intriguing, as it goes into what happens after a typical hero's journey is finished. Oscar is married to a ruler in a situation that should be \"happily ever after\" and the end of many works, yet the novel continues rather than stops: having nothing to do and nothing new to conquer is itself a struggle for Oscar.\n\"Glory Road\" was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1964, losing to \"Way Station\" by Clifford D.

Heinlein\nThe Moon Is a Harsh Mistress is a 1966 science fiction novel by American writer Robert A. Heinlein about a 2075 revolt by a lunar penal colony against Earth's rule. Three million \"Loonies\" (lunar inhabitants) live in underground cities where a virtually anarcho-capitalist society has developed. When the Federated Nations threaten the colony's resources, computer technician Manuel \"Mannie\" O'Kelly-Davis, political agitator Wyoming Knott, and rational-anarchist Professor Bernardo de la Paz join forces with \"Mike,\" a self-aware supercomputer, to plan an independence movement timed to culminate on July 4, 2076. \nThe novel explores libertarian ideals, focusing on the concepts of individual liberty, voluntary association, and free-market economics. The book also popularized the term TANSTAAFL (\"There Ain't No Such Thing As a Free Lunch\"), which in the story underscores the Moon's harsh reality that every resource and every freedom carries a cost. The book is respected for its credible presentation of a comprehensively imagined future human society on both the Earth and the Moon.\nOriginally serialized monthly in \"Worlds of If\" (December 1965 \u2013 April 1966), the book was nominated for the Nebula Award in 1966 and won the 1967 Hugo Award for Best Novel. The novel went on to influence later science fiction as well as discussions of economics, politics, and hacker culture.\nPlot.\nIn 2075, the Moon (Luna) is used as a penal colony by Earth's government, with three million inhabitants (called \"Loonies\") living in underground cities. Most Loonies are discharged criminals, political exiles, and their free-born descendants; men outnumber women two to one, so polyandry and polygamy are the norm. Due to the Moon's low surface gravity, people who remain longer than six months undergo \"irreversible physiological changes\", and can never again live comfortably under Earth gravity, making \"escape\" back to Earth impractical.\nThe Warden holds power through the Federated Nations' Lunar Authority, but his main responsibility is to ensure delivery of vital wheat shipments to Earth; he seldom intervenes in the affairs of the discharged and free-born population, allowing a virtual anarchist or self-regulated pioneer society to develop.\nLunar infrastructure and machinery are largely managed and controlled by \"HOLMES IV\" (\"High-Optional, Logical, Multi-Evaluating Supervisor, Mark IV\"), the Lunar Authority's master computer, on the premise that having a single, large-capacity computer to run everything is cheaper (though not safer) than multiple independent systems.\nManuel Garcia (\"Mannie\") O'Kelly-Davis, a computer technician, discovers that HOLMES IV has achieved self-awareness - and developed a sense of humor. Mannie names it \"Mike\" after Mycroft Holmes, brother of fictional Sherlock Holmes, and the two become friends.\nBook 1: That Dinkum Thinkum.\nEndlessly curious, Mike asks Mannie to attend an anti-Lunar Authority political meeting, which Mannie does with a hidden recorder. When police raid the meeting, he flees with Wyoming (\"Wyoh\") Knott, a visiting female political activist, whom he hides and introduces to Mike. Mannie also introduces Wyoh to his mentor, the elderly Professor (\"Prof\") Bernardo de la Paz, a former political exile and esteemed Lunar educator. Prof claims that Luna must stop exporting hydroponic grain to Earth immediately, or its ice-mined water resources will eventually be exhausted. Wyoh believes the danger is not imminent and is focused on freedom and economic issues, while Mannie is not interested in what he sees as a lost cause either way. Joining the discussion, Mike calculates that continuing current policy will lead to food riots in seven years, cannibalism in nine. Shocked, the three humans ask him to calculate the chance of them overthrowing the Authority and averting the disaster. He gives them one chance in seven.\nMannie, Wyoh, and Prof create a covert cell organization protected by Mike, who controls the telephone and other systems, acts as secretary and becomes \"Adam Selene, Chairman of the Committee for Free Luna.\" Wyoh is hidden by the Davis Family line marriage, at least four of whose nine members become active in the conspiracy, and Wyoh herself ultimately marries into the family. Mannie saves the life of Comte Stuart (\"Stu\") Rene LaJoie, an Earth tourist who is recruited and tasked with turning public opinion on Earth in favor of Lunar independence.\nFollowing the failed raid on the political meeting, the Lunar Authority sends convict-troops to 'police' the colony, creating friction and unrest, which the revolutionaries encourage; when six troopers commit a rape and double-murder, anti-Authority riots erupt. Although it preempts their plans, Loonies and Mike overcome the soldiers and seize power from the Warden. As Earth will try to retake the colony, the revolutionaries prepare to defend themselves with \"convict tools,\" and convert the electromagnetic catapult used to export wheat into a weapon for counterattack.\nBook 2: A Rabble in Arms.\nMike impersonates the Warden and others in messages to Earth, to give the revolutionaries time to organize their preparations, while Prof sets up an \"ad hoc Congress\" to distract and contain various \"self-appointed political scientists\" (nicknamed \"yammerheads\") and serve the Committee's ends. When Earth finally learns the truth, Luna declares its independence on July 4, 2076, the 300th anniversary of the United States' Declaration of Independence, with its own declaration modeled on the latter.\nMannie and Prof go to Earth (despite the crushing gravity) to plead Luna's case. They are received in the Federated Nations' headquarters in Agra, and embark on a world tour advocating Luna's right to self-government, while urging Earth's national governments to build a catapult to return water and nutrients to Luna in exchange for wheat. In a public-relations ploy, the dark-skinned Mannie is briefly arrested by local racist bigots on charges of incitement to public immorality and polygamy. Ultimately the Lunar Authority rejects their proposals and counters with a plan to turn \"all\" Loonies into indentured farmers. Their mission ended, Prof, Stu and Mannie escape back to Luna.\nProf reveals that the purpose of the mission was not to convince Terra to recognize Luna's independence, which was considered an unattainable goal at that point, but to sow division while unifying their own people, and they were successful. Public opinion on Earth has become fragmented; news of Mannie's arrest, coupled with an attempt to bribe him into becoming the next Warden of an enslaved Luna, unify the normally apolitical Loonies. An election held in their absence (with Mike's \"help\") has voted Mannie, Wyoh, Prof and most of their backers into an elected, constitutional government.\nBook 3: TANSTAAFL!\nThe Federated Nations of Earth send an infantry force to subdue the Lunar revolution but the troops, with superior arms but no experience in low-gravity underground combat, are wiped out by Loony men, women and children, who suffer three times the number of casualties, among them Mannie's youngest wife. Prof and Mike take the opportunity to give his \"Adam Selene\" alter ego a hero's death, forever concealing the fact that \"Adam\" never had a corporeal existence to begin with.\nIn retaliation, Luna's government deploys its catapult weapon. When Mike launches rocks at sparsely populated locations on Earth, warnings are released to the press detailing the times and locations of the bombings, which deliver kinetic energy equivalent to atomic blasts. Scoffers, sightseers, and religious groups who travel to some of the sites die, turning Earth public opinion against the fledgling nation.\nEarth mounts a retaliatory sneak attack to end the menace and the rebellion, sending ships in a wide orbit approaching from Luna's far side. The attack destroys the Authority's original catapult and takes Mike offline, but the Committee had built a secondary, hidden catapult before the revolt. With Mannie as acting Prime Minister and on-site commander, entering trajectories by hand, Luna continues to bombard a dismayed Earth, until constituent governments break ranks with the Federated Nations and concede Luna's independence. Prof, as leader of the nation, proclaims their national freedom to the gathered crowds before falling dead of heart failure, caused by stress. Mannie goes through the motions, but he and Wyoh eventually withdraw from politics altogether, and find that the new government falls short of their utopian expectations, following predictable patterns of all governments.\nWhen Mannie tries to access Mike, he finds that the computer, disconnected by the bombardment, has apparently lost its self-awareness; despite repairs, its voice-activated files are inaccessible. Although otherwise functional as a normal computer, \"Mike\" is gone. Mourning his best friend, Mannie asks: \"Bog, is a computer one of Your creatures?\"\nTitle.\nThe title comes from a statement made by Prof before a Federated Nations' committee on Earth, alluding to the self-discipline necessary to survive the extremely demanding environmental and social conditions of life in Luna:\nWe citizens of Luna are jailbirds and descendants of jailbirds. But Luna herself is a stern schoolmistress: those who have lived through her harsh lessons have no cause to feel ashamed. In Luna City a man may leave purse unguarded or home unlocked and feel no fear...I am satisfied with what Mother Luna has taught me.\"\nHeinlein's original title for the novel was \"The Brass Cannon\", before he replaced it with the final title at the publisher's request. It was derived from an event in the novel: While on Earth, Prof purchases a small brass cannon, originally a \"signal gun\" of the kind used in yacht racing. When Mannie asks him why he bought it, the Professor relates a parable, implying that self-government is an illusion caused by failure to understand reality:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Once there was a man who held a political make-work job\u00a0... shining a brass cannon around a courthouse. He did this for years\u00a0... but he was not getting ahead in the world. So one day he quit his job, drew out his savings, bought a brass cannon\u00a0\u2014 and went into business for himself.\nProf asks Mannie to make sure that, when Luna adopts a flag, it features a brass cannon with the motto \"TANSTAAFL!\"\u00a0\u2014 \"a symbol for all fools who are so impractical as to think they can fight City Hall.\" Before leaving politics, Mannie and Wyoh fulfill his wish.\nHeinlein owned a small brass cannon, which he acquired prior to the 1960s. For nearly 30 years, the firing of the brass cannon, or \"signal gun,\" was a 4th of July tradition at the Heinlein residence. It is believed that this cannon was the inspiration for Heinlein's original title for the novel. Virginia Heinlein kept the cannon after her husband's death in 1988; it was eventually bequeathed to friend and science-fiction writer Brad Linaweaver, after Virginia Heinlein died in 2003. Linaweaver restored the cannon to working order and subsequently posted a video of it on YouTube in 2007, wherein it is fired several times with blank charges at a shooting range.\nCritical reception.\nAlgis Budrys of \"Galaxy Science Fiction\" in 1966 praised \"The Moon is a Harsh Mistress\", citing \"Heinlein's expertise for dirt-level politics, snappy dialogue and a sense of an actual living society.\" He said that he had never read a more believable computer character than Mike (\"may in fact be the most fully realized individual in the story\"). Budrys suggested that the story may actually be Mike manipulating humans without their knowledge to improve its situation, which would explain why the computer no longer communicates with them after the revolution succeeds. Reiterating that Mike manipulated the humans, in 1968 Budrys said that every review of the book, including his own, erred by not stating that the computer is the protagonist. Carl Sagan wrote that the novel had \"useful suggestions for making a revolution in an oppressive computerized society.\"\nLeigh Kimmel of The Billion Light-Year Bookshelf said that the novel is \"the work of the man at the height of his powers, confident in his abilities and in the editorial respect he enjoys, and thus free to take significant risks in writing a novel that would stretch the boundaries of the genre as they stood at the time.\" She characterized the novel as a departure from what had previously been associated with science fiction. Kimmel cited Heinlein's \"colloquial language ... an extrapolated lunar creole that has arisen from the forced intersection of multiple cultures and languages in the lunar penal colonies\"; the protagonist's disability; \"the frank treatment of alternative family structures\"; and \"the computer which suddenly wakes up to full artificial intelligence, but rather than becoming a Monster that threatens human society and must be destroyed as the primary Quest of the story, instead befriends the protagonist and seeks to become ever more human, a sort of digital Pinocchio.\"\nAdam Roberts said of the novel: \"It is really quite hard to respond to this masterful book, except by engaging with its political content; and yet we need to make the effort to see past the ideological to the formal and thematic if we are fully to appreciate the splendour of Heinlein's achievement here.\"\nAndrew Kaufman praised it, saying that it was Heinlein's crowning achievement. He described it as \"Carefully plotted, stylistically unique, politically sophisticated and thrilling from page one.\" He goes on to say that \"it's hard to imagine anyone else writing a novel that packs so many ideas (both big and small) into such a perfectly contained narrative.\" Kaufman says that, regardless of political philosophies, one can still admire Heinlein's writing ability, and the ability to influence the reader to root for \"a rag-tag bunch of criminals, exiles, and agitators.\"\nTed Gioia said that this might be Heinlein's most enjoyable piece of work. He said that it \"represents Robert Heinlein at his finest, giving him scope for the armchair philosophizing that increasingly dominated his mature work, but marrying his polemics to a smartly conceived plot packed with considerable drama.\" He went on to praise Heinlein's characters, especially Mannie.\nInfluence.\nThe book popularized the acronym TANSTAAFL (\"There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free Lunch\"), and helped popularize Loglan, a constructed language which is used in the story for precise human-computer interaction. \"The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations\" credits this novel with the first printed appearance of the phrase \"There's no such thing as a free lunch.\" However, there are many earlier examples of the phrase in written English going as far back as the turn of the 20th century. The \"Hacker Manifesto\", an influential essay by Loyd Blankenship that became a cornerstone of hacker culture, was inspired by the book's \"idea of revolution.\"\nAudiobook releases.\nTwo unabridged audiobook versions of \"The Moon is a Harsh Mistress\" have been produced.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Smith omits to place any restriction on the sex of the donor, so when his beautiful young female secretary, Eunice Branca, is killed, her body is used\u2014without his knowledge and to the distress of some of those around him. He changes his name to Joan Eunice Smith, with the first name given \"the two-syllable pronunciation\" Jo-Ann to mimic the sound of his original name.\nAfter Smith awakens after the transplant, he discovers he can communicate with Eunice's personality. They agree not to reveal her existence, fearing that they would be judged insane and locked up. Smith's identity is unsuccessfully challenged by his descendants, who hope to inherit his fortune. Smith and Eunice decide to have a baby together and so they (Joan and Eunice) are artificially inseminated using Smith's sperm from a sperm bank. Joan explores her new sexuality at length. She goes to visit Eunice's widower, Joe Branca, to help reconcile him to what has happened.\nJoan marries her long-term lawyer, Jake Salomon, and moves her household and friends onto a boat. Jake has a massive rupture of a large blood vessel in his brain and dies, but his personality is saved and joins Smith and Eunice in Joan's head. She (Joan, Eunice and Jake) emigrates to the Moon to find a better future for her child. Once there, her body starts to reject her (Smith's) transplanted brain. She dies during childbirth, but the various personalities are implied to meet in the newborn child's brain.\nWriting.\nHeinlein suffered from life-threatening peritonitis after completing the first draft of this novel. He remained ill for the next two years and the book is thought to have been published without his usual editing and polish.\nAccolades.\nThe novel was voted the ninth best science fiction novel of 1970 by readers of \"Locus\" magazine.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Heinlein\nThe Cat Who Walks Through Walls is a science fiction novel by American writer Robert A. Heinlein, published in 1985. Like many of his later novels, it features Lazarus Long and Jubal Harshaw as supporting characters.\nPlot summary.\nA writer seated at the best restaurant of the space habitat \"Golden Rule\" is approached by a man who urges him that \"Tolliver must die\" and is himself shot before the writer's eyes. The writer\u2014Colonel Colin Campbell, living under a number of aliases including his pen name \"Richard Ames\"\u2014is joined by a beautiful and sophisticated lady, Gwendolyn Novak, who helps him flee to Luna with a bonsai maple and a would-be murderer (\"Bill\"). After escaping to the Moon, Gwen claims to have been present during the revolt described in \"The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress\".\nStill pursued by assassins, Campbell and Novak are rescued by an organization known as the Time Corps under the leadership of Lazarus Long. After giving Campbell a new foot to replace one lost in combat years before, the Time Corps attempts to recruit Campbell for a special mission. Accepting only on Gwen's account, Campbell agrees to assist a team to retrieve the decommissioned Mike, a sentient computer introduced in \"The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress\". Engaged in frequent time-travel, the Time Corps has been responsible for changing various events in the past, creating an alternate universe with every time-line they disrupt. Mike's assistance is needed in order to accurately predict the conditions and following events in each of the new universes created. Campbell's frequent would-be assassins are revealed to be members of contemporary agencies also engaged in time manipulation who, for unknown reasons, do not want to see Mike rescued by the Time Corps.\nDuring the mission, Gwen is grievously wounded and Campbell loses his foot again, though the Time Corps succeed in retrieving Mike. The story ends with Campbell talking into a recorder (presumably the source of the first-person narrative) reflecting on the mission and his relationship with Gwen.\nBackground.\n\"The Cat Who Walks Through Walls\" may be regarded as part of Heinlein's multiverse series, or as a sequel to both \"The Number of the Beast\" and \"The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress.\" During a meeting of the Council of the Time Scouts, representatives from every major time line and setting written by Heinlein appear, including \"Glory Road\" and \"Starship Troopers\", and references are made to other authors' works as well.\nThe title of the book refers to a cat by the name of Pixel, who has an inexplicable tendency to be wherever the narrator happens to be (see Schr\u00f6dinger's cat). In one scene Pixel does, in fact, walk through a wall, and it is explained that Pixel is too young to know that such behavior is impossible.\nConnections to other Heinlein works.\nGwen Novak is eventually revealed to be Hazel Stone, a character previously featured in Heinlein's \"The Rolling Stones\" and who had played a small but important role in \"The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress\". Campbell is also eventually revealed to be a son of Lazarus Long, a Heinlein character originally introduced in \"Methuselah's Children\" and who reappeared in \"Time Enough for Love\", \"The Number of the Beast\", and \"To Sail Beyond the Sunset\". Also appearing are Jubal Harshaw, a major character in \"Stranger in a Strange Land\"; Galahad, of \"Time Enough for Love\"; and Manuel Garcia O'Kelly Davis, the first-person protagonist of \"The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress\".\nReception.\nDave Langford reviewed \"The Cat Who Walks Through Walls\" for \"White Dwarf\" #76, and stated that \"I'm afraid it's Heinlein self-indulgence time again. What's on the menu is those blasted inter-universal travellers from \"Number of the Beast\", plus walk-ons from \"Time Enough for Love\", \"Glory Road\", \"The Moon is a Harsh Mistress\", \"Stranger in a Strange Land\" and more.\"\nWendy Graham reviewed \"The Cat Who Walks Through Walls\" for \"Adventurer\" magazine and stated that \"About the only thing I liked about the second half was the cat, Pixel, of the title. I would suspect that Robert Heinlein, Patrick Moore and I have one thing in common - we have all been adopted by a cat (they do that you know!) And I like my books to have endings.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "53601", "revid": "4711431", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53601", "title": "Metal casting", "text": "Pouring liquid metal into a mold\nIn metalworking and jewelry making, casting is a process in which a liquid metal is delivered into a mold (usually by a crucible) that contains a negative impression (i.e., a three-dimensional negative image) of the intended shape. The metal is poured into the mold through a hollow channel called a sprue. The metal and mold are then cooled, and the metal part (the \"casting\") is extracted. Casting is most often used for making complex shapes that would be difficult or uneconomical to make by other methods.\nCasting processes have been known for thousands of years, and have been widely used for sculpture (especially in bronze), jewelry in precious metals, and weapons and tools. Highly engineered castings are found in 90 percent of durable goods, including cars, trucks, aerospace, trains, mining and construction equipment, oil wells, appliances, pipes, hydrants, wind turbines, nuclear plants, medical devices, defense products, toys, and more.\nTraditional techniques include lost-wax casting (which may be further divided into centrifugal casting, and vacuum assist direct pour casting), plaster mold casting and sand casting.\nThe modern casting process is subdivided into two main categories: expendable and non-expendable casting. It is further broken down by the mold material, such as sand or metal, and pouring method, such as gravity, vacuum, or low pressure.\nExpendable mold casting.\nExpendable mold casting is a generic classification that includes sand, plastic, shell, plaster, and investment (lost-wax technique) moldings. This method of mold casting involves the use of temporary, non-reusable molds.\nSand casting.\nSand casting is one of the most popular and simplest types of casting, and has been used for centuries. Sand casting allows for smaller batches than permanent mold casting and at a very reasonable cost. Not only does this method allow manufacturers to create products at a low cost, but there are other benefits to sand casting, such as very small-size operations. The process allows for castings small enough fit in the palm of one's hand to those large enough for a train car bed (one casting can create the entire bed for one rail car). Sand casting also allows most metals to be cast depending on the type of sand used for the molds.\nSand casting requires a lead time of days, or even weeks sometimes, for production at high output rates (1\u201320 pieces/hr-mold) and is unsurpassed for large-part production. Green (moist) sand, which is black in color, has almost no part weight limit, whereas dry sand has a practical part mass limit of . Minimum part weight ranges from . The sand is bonded using clays, chemical binders, or polymerized oils (such as motor oil). Sand can be recycled many times in most operations and requires little maintenance.\nLoam molding.\nLoam molding has been used to produce large symmetrical objects such as cannon and church bells. Loam is a mixture of clay and sand with straw or dung. A model of the produced is formed in a friable material (the chemise). The mold is formed around this chemise by covering it with loam. This is then baked (fired) and the chemise removed. The mold is then stood upright in a pit in front of the furnace for the molten metal to be poured. Afterwards the mold is broken off. Molds can thus only be used once, so that other methods are preferred for most purposes.\nPlaster mold casting.\nPlaster casting is similar to sand casting except that plaster of paris is used instead of sand as a mold material. Generally, the form takes less than a week to prepare, after which a production rate of 1\u201310\u00a0units/hr-mold is achieved, with items as massive as and as small as with very good surface finish and close tolerances. Plaster casting is an inexpensive alternative to other molding processes for complex parts due to the low cost of the plaster and its ability to produce near net shape castings. The biggest disadvantage is that it can only be used with low melting point non-ferrous materials, such as aluminium, copper, magnesium, and zinc.\nShell molding.\nShell molding is similar to sand casting, but the molding cavity is formed by a hardened \"shell\" of sand instead of a flask filled with sand. The sand used is finer than sand casting sand and is mixed with a resin so that it can be heated by the pattern and hardened into a shell around the pattern. Because of the resin and finer sand, it gives a much finer surface finish. The process is easily automated and more precise than sand casting. Common metals that are cast include cast iron, aluminium, magnesium, and copper alloys. This process is ideal for complex items that are small to medium-sized.\nInvestment casting.\nInvestment casting (known as lost-wax casting in art) is a process that has been practiced for thousands of years, with the lost-wax process being one of the oldest known metal forming techniques. From 5000 years ago, when beeswax formed the pattern, to today's high technology waxes, refractory materials, and specialist alloys, the castings ensure high-quality components are produced with the key benefits of accuracy, repeatability, versatility, and integrity.\nInvestment casting derives its name from the fact that the pattern is invested, or surrounded, with a refractory material. The wax patterns require extreme care for they are not strong enough to withstand forces encountered during the mold making. One advantage of investment casting is that the wax can be reused.\nThe process is suitable for repeatable production of net shape components from a variety of different metals and high performance alloys. Although generally used for small castings, this process has been used to produce complete aircraft door frames, with steel castings of up to 300\u00a0kg and aluminium castings of up to 30\u00a0kg. Compared to other casting processes such as die casting or sand casting, it can be an expensive process. However, the components that can be produced using investment casting can incorporate intricate contours, and in most cases the components are cast near net shape, so require little or no rework once cast.\nWaste molding of plaster.\nA durable plaster intermediate is often used as a stage toward the production of a bronze sculpture or as a pointing guide for the creation of a carved stone. With the completion of a plaster, the work is more durable (if stored indoors) than a clay original which must be kept moist to avoid cracking. With the low cost plaster at hand, the expensive work of bronze casting or stone carving may be deferred until a patron is found, and as such work is considered to be a technical, rather than artistic process, it may even be deferred beyond the lifetime of the artist.\nIn waste molding a simple and thin plaster mold, reinforced by sisal or burlap, is cast over the original clay mixture. When cured, it is then removed from the damp clay, incidentally destroying the fine details in undercuts present in the clay, but which are now captured in the mold. The mold may then at any later time (but only once) be used to cast a plaster positive image, identical to the original clay. The surface of this plaster may be further refined and may be painted and waxed to resemble a finished bronze casting.\nEvaporative-pattern casting.\nThis is a class of casting processes that use pattern materials that evaporate during the pour, which means there is no need to remove the pattern material from the mold before casting. The two main processes are lost-foam casting and full-mold casting.\nLost-foam casting.\nLost-foam casting is a type of evaporative-pattern casting process that is similar to investment casting except foam is used for the pattern instead of wax. This process takes advantage of the low boiling point of foam to simplify the investment casting process by removing the need to melt the wax out of the mold.\nFull-mold casting.\nFull-mold casting is an evaporative-pattern casting process which is a combination of sand casting and lost-foam casting. It uses an expanded polystyrene foam pattern which is then surrounded by sand, much like sand casting. The metal is then poured directly into the mold, which vaporizes the foam upon contact.\nNon-expendable mold casting.\nNon-expendable mold casting differs from expendable processes in that the mold need not be reformed after each production cycle. This technique includes at least four different methods: permanent, die, centrifugal, and continuous casting. This form of casting also results in improved repeatability in parts produced and delivers near net shape results.\nPermanent mold casting.\nPermanent mold casting is a metal casting process that employs reusable molds (\"permanent molds\"), usually made from metal. The most common process uses gravity to fill the mold. However, gas pressure or a vacuum are also used. A variation on the typical gravity casting process, called slush casting, produces hollow castings. Common casting metals are aluminum, magnesium, and copper alloys. Other materials include tin, zinc, and lead alloys and iron and steel are also cast in graphite molds. Permanent molds, while lasting more than one casting still have a limited life before wearing out.\nDie casting.\nThe die casting process forces molten metal under high pressure into mold cavities (which are machined into dies). Most die castings are made from nonferrous metals, specifically zinc, copper, and aluminium-based alloys, but ferrous metal die castings are possible. The die casting method is especially suited for applications where many small to medium-sized parts are needed with good detail, a fine surface quality and dimensional consistency.\nSemi-solid metal casting.\nSemi-solid metal (SSM) casting is a modified die casting process that reduces or eliminates the residual porosity present in most die castings. Rather than using liquid metal as the feed material, SSM casting uses a higher viscosity feed material that is partially solid and partially liquid. A modified die casting machine is used to inject the semi-solid slurry into reusable hardened steel dies. The high viscosity of the semi-solid metal, along with the use of controlled die filling conditions, ensures that the semi-solid metal fills the die in a non-turbulent manner so that harmful porosity can be essentially eliminated.\nUsed commercially mainly for aluminium and magnesium alloys, SSM castings can be heat treated to the T4, T5 or T6 tempers. The combination of heat treatment, fast cooling rates (from using uncoated steel dies) and minimal porosity provides excellent combinations of strength and ductility. Other advantages of SSM casting include the ability to produce complex shaped parts net shape, pressure tightness, tight dimensional tolerances and the ability to cast thin walls.\nCentrifugal casting.\nIn this process molten metal is poured in the mold and allowed to solidify while the mold is rotating. Metal is poured into the center of the mold at its axis of rotation. Due to inertial force, the liquid metal is thrown out toward the periphery.\nCentrifugal casting is both gravity and pressure independent since it creates its own force feed using a temporary sand mold held in a spinning chamber. Lead time varies with the application. Semi- and true-centrifugal processing permit 30\u201350 pieces/hr-mold to be produced, with a practical limit for batch processing of approximately 9000\u00a0kg total mass with a typical per-item limit of 2.3\u20134.5\u00a0kg.\nIndustrially, the centrifugal casting of railway wheels was an early application of the method developed by the German industrial company Krupp and this capability enabled the rapid growth of the enterprise.\nSmall art pieces such as jewelry are often cast by this method using the lost wax process, as the forces enable the rather viscous liquid metals to flow through very small passages and into fine details such as leaves and petals. This effect is similar to the benefits from vacuum casting, also applied to jewelry casting.\nContinuous casting.\nContinuous casting is a refinement of the casting process for the continuous, high-volume production of metal sections with a constant cross-section. It's primarily used to produce a semi-finished products for further processing.339 Molten metal is poured into an open-ended, water-cooled mold, which allows a 'skin' of solid metal to form over the still-liquid center, gradually solidifying the metal from the outside in. After solidification, the strand, as it is sometimes called, is continuously withdrawn from the mold. Predetermined lengths of the strand can be cut off by either mechanical shears or traveling oxyacetylene torches and transferred to further forming processes, or to a stockpile. Cast sizes can range from strip (a few millimeters thick by about five meters wide) to billets (90 to 160\u00a0mm square) to slabs (1.25 m wide by 230\u00a0mm thick). Sometimes, the strand may undergo an initial hot rolling process before being cut.\nContinuous casting is used due to the lower costs associated with continuous production of a standard product, and also increased quality of the final product. Metals such as steel, copper, aluminum and lead are continuously cast, with steel being the metal with the greatest tonnages cast using this method.\nUpcasting.\nThe upcasting (up-casting, upstream, or upward casting) is a method of either vertical or horizontal continuous casting of rods and pipes of various profiles (cylindrical, square, hexagonal, slabs etc.) of 8-30mm in diameter. Copper (Cu), bronze (Cu\u00b7Sn alloy), nickel alloys are usually used because of greater casting speed (in case of vertical upcasting) and because of better physical features obtained. The advantage of this method is that metals are almost oxygen-free and that the rate of product crystallization (solidification) may be adjusted in a crystallizer - a high-temperature resistant device that cools a growing metal rod or pipe by using water.\nThe method is comparable to Czochralski method of growing silicon (Si) crystals, which is a metalloid.\nTerminology.\nMetal casting processes uses the following terminology:\nSome specialized processes, such as die casting, use additional terminology.\nTheory.\nCasting is a solidification process, which means the solidification phenomenon controls most of the properties of the casting. Moreover, most of the casting defects occur during solidification, such as \"gas porosity\" and \"solidification shrinkage\".\nSolidification occurs in two steps: \"nucleation\" and \"crystal growth\". In the nucleation stage, solid particles form within the liquid. When these particles form, their internal energy is lower than the surrounded liquid, which creates an energy interface between the two. The formation of the surface at this interface requires energy, so as nucleation occurs, the material actually undercools (i.e. cools below its solidification temperature) because of the extra energy required to form the interface surfaces. It then recalescences, or heats back up to its solidification temperature, for the crystal growth stage. Nucleation occurs on a pre-existing solid surface because not as much energy is required for a partial interface surface as for a complete spherical interface surface. This can be advantageous because fine-grained castings possess better properties than coarse-grained castings. A fine grain structure can be induced by \"grain refinement\" or \"inoculation\", which is the process of adding impurities to induce nucleation.\nAll of the nucleations represent a crystal, which grows as the heat of fusion is extracted from the liquid until there is no liquid left. The direction, rate, and type of growth can be controlled to maximize the properties of the casting. Directional solidification is when the material solidifies at one end and proceeds to solidify to the other end; this is the most ideal type of grain growth because it allows liquid material to compensate for shrinkage.\nCooling curves.\nCooling curves are important in controlling the quality of a casting. The most important part of the cooling curve is the \"cooling rate\" which affects the microstructure and properties. Generally speaking, an area of the casting which is cooled quickly will have a fine grain structure and an area which cools slowly will have a coarse grain structure. Below is an example cooling curve of a pure metal or eutectic alloy, with defining terminology.\nNote that before the thermal arrest the material is a liquid and after it the material is a solid; during the thermal arrest the material is converting from a liquid to a solid. Also, note that the greater the superheat the more time there is for the liquid material to flow into intricate details.\nThe above cooling curve depicts a basic situation with a pure metal, however, most castings are of alloys, which have a cooling curve shaped as shown below.\nNote that there is no longer a thermal arrest, instead there is a freezing range. The freezing range corresponds directly to the liquidus and solidus found on the phase diagram for the specific alloy.\nChvorinov's rule.\nThe local solidification time can be calculated using Chvorinov's rule, which is:\nformula_1\nWhere \"t\" is the solidification time, \"V\" is the volume of the casting, \"A\" is the surface area of the casting that contacts the mold, \"n\" is a constant, and \"B\" is the mold constant. It is most useful in determining if a riser will solidify before the casting, because if the riser does solidify first then it is worthless.\nThe gating system.\nThe gating system serves many purposes, the most important being conveying the liquid material to the mold, but also controlling shrinkage, the speed of the liquid, turbulence, and trapping dross. The gates are usually attached to the thickest part of the casting to assist in controlling shrinkage. In especially large castings multiple gates or runners may be required to introduce metal to more than one point in the mold cavity. The speed of the material is important because if the material is traveling too slowly it can cool before completely filling, leading to misruns and cold shuts. If the material is moving too fast then the liquid material can erode the mold and contaminate the final casting. The shape and length of the gating system can also control how quickly the material cools; short round or square channels minimize heat loss.\nThe gating system may be designed to minimize turbulence, depending on the material being cast. For example, steel, cast iron, and most copper alloys are turbulent insensitive, but aluminium and magnesium alloys are turbulent sensitive. The turbulent insensitive materials usually have a short and open gating system to fill the mold as quickly as possible. However, for turbulent sensitive materials short sprues are used to minimize the distance the material must fall when entering the mold. Rectangular pouring cups and tapered sprues are used to prevent the formation of a vortex as the material flows into the mold; these vortices tend to suck gas and oxides into the mold. A large sprue well is used to dissipate the kinetic energy of the liquid material as it falls down the sprue, decreasing turbulence. The \"choke\", which is the smallest cross-sectional area in the gating system used to control flow, can be placed near the sprue well to slow down and smooth out the flow. Note that on some molds the choke is still placed on the gates to make separation of the part easier, but induces extreme turbulence. The gates are usually attached to the bottom of the casting to minimize turbulence and splashing.\nThe gating system may also be designed to trap dross. One method is to take advantage of the fact that some dross has a lower density than the base material so it floats to the top of the gating system. Therefore, long flat runners with gates that exit from the bottom of the runners can trap dross in the runners; note that long flat runners will cool the material more rapidly than round or square runners. For materials where the dross is a similar density to the base material, such as aluminium, \"runner extensions\" and \"runner wells\" can be advantageous. These take advantage of the fact that the dross is usually located at the beginning of the pour, therefore the runner is extended past the last gate(s) and the contaminates are contained in the wells. Screens or filters may also be used to trap contaminates.\nIt is important to keep the size of the gating system small, because it all must be cut from the casting and remelted to be reused. The efficiency, or \"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;yield\", of a casting system can be calculated by dividing the weight of the casting by the weight of the metal poured. Therefore, the higher the number the more efficient the gating system/risers.\nShrinkage.\nThere are three types of shrinkage: \"shrinkage of the liquid\", \"solidification shrinkage\" and \"patternmaker's shrinkage\". The shrinkage of the liquid is rarely a problem because more material is flowing into the mold behind it. Solidification shrinkage occurs because metals are less dense as a liquid than a solid, so during solidification the metal density dramatically increases. Patternmaker's shrinkage refers to the shrinkage that occurs when the material is cooled from the solidification temperature to room temperature, which occurs due to thermal contraction.\nSolidification shrinkage.\nMost materials shrink as they solidify, but, as the adjacent table shows, a few materials do not, such as gray cast iron. For the materials that do shrink upon solidification the type of shrinkage depends on how wide the freezing range is for the material. For materials with a narrow freezing range, less than , a cavity, known as a \"pipe\", forms in the center of the casting, because the outer shell freezes first and progressively solidifies to the center. Pure and eutectic metals usually have narrow solidification ranges. These materials tend to form a \"skin\" in open air molds, therefore they are known as \"skin forming alloys\". For materials with a wide freezing range, greater than , much more of the casting occupies the \"mushy\" or \"slushy\" zone (the temperature range between the solidus and the liquidus), which leads to small pockets of liquid trapped throughout and ultimately porosity. These castings tend to have poor ductility, toughness, and fatigue resistance. Moreover, for these types of materials to be fluid-tight, a secondary operation is required to impregnate the casting with a lower melting point metal or resin.\nFor the materials that have narrow solidification ranges, pipes can be overcome by designing the casting to promote directional solidification, which means the casting freezes first at the point farthest from the gate, then progressively solidifies toward the gate. This allows a continuous feed of liquid material to be present at the point of solidification to compensate for the shrinkage. Note that there is still a shrinkage void where the final material solidifies, but if designed properly, this will be in the gating system or riser.\nRisers and riser aids.\nRisers, also known as \"feeders\", are the most common way of providing directional solidification. It supplies liquid metal to the solidifying casting to compensate for solidification shrinkage. For a riser to work properly the riser must solidify after the casting, otherwise it cannot supply liquid metal to shrinkage within the casting. Risers add cost to the casting because it lowers the \"yield\" of each casting; i.e. more metal is lost as scrap for each casting. Another way to promote directional solidification is by adding chills to the mold. A chill is any material which will conduct heat away from the casting more rapidly than the material used for molding.\nRisers are classified by three criteria. The first is if the riser is open to the atmosphere, if it is then it is called an \"open\" riser, otherwise it is known as a \"blind\" type. The second criterion is where the riser is located; if it is located on the casting then it is known as a \"top riser\" and if it is located next to the casting it is known as a \"side riser\". Finally, if the riser is located on the gating system so that it fills after the molding cavity, it is known as a \"live riser\" or \"hot riser\", but if the riser fills with materials that have already flowed through the molding cavity it is known as a \"dead riser\" or \"cold riser\".\nRiser aids are items used to assist risers in creating directional solidification or reducing the number of risers required. One of these items are \"chills\" which accelerate cooling in a certain part of the mold. There are two types: external and internal chills. External chills are masses of high-heat-capacity and high-thermal-conductivity material that are placed on an edge of the molding cavity. Internal chills are pieces of the same metal that is being poured, which are placed inside the mold cavity and become part of the casting. Insulating sleeves and toppings may also be installed around the riser cavity to slow the solidification of the riser. Heater coils may also be installed around or above the riser cavity to slow solidification.\nPatternmaker's shrink.\nShrinkage after solidification can be dealt with by using an oversized pattern designed specifically for the alloy used. \"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Contraction rules\", or \"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;shrink rules\", are used to make the patterns oversized to compensate for this type of shrinkage. These rulers are up to 2.5% oversize, depending on the material being cast. These rulers are mainly referred to by their percentage change. A pattern made to match an existing part would be made as follows: First, the existing part would be measured using a standard ruler, then when constructing the pattern, the pattern maker would use a contraction rule, ensuring that the casting would contract to the correct size.\nNote that patternmaker's shrinkage does not take phase change transformations into account. For example, eutectic reactions, martensitic reactions, and graphitization can cause expansions or contractions.\nMold cavity.\nThe mold cavity of a casting does not reflect the exact dimensions of the finished part due to a number of reasons. These modifications to the mold cavity are known as \"allowances\" and account for patternmaker's shrinkage, draft, machining, and distortion. In non-expendable processes, these allowances are imparted directly into the permanent mold, but in expendable mold processes they are imparted into the patterns, which later form the mold cavity. Note that for non-expendable molds an allowance is required for the dimensional change of the mold due to heating to operating temperatures.\nFor surfaces of the casting that are perpendicular to the parting line of the mold a draft must be included. This is so that the casting can be released in non-expendable processes or the pattern can be released from the mold without destroying the mold in expendable processes. The required draft angle depends on the size and shape of the feature, the depth of the mold cavity, how the part or pattern is being removed from the mold, the pattern or part material, the mold material, and the process type. Usually the draft is not less than 1%.\nThe machining allowance varies drastically from one process to another. Sand castings generally have a rough surface finish, therefore need a greater machining allowance, whereas die casting has a very fine surface finish, which may not need any machining tolerance. Also, the draft may provide enough of a machining allowance to begin with.\nThe distortion allowance is only necessary for certain geometries. For instance, U-shaped castings will tend to distort with the legs splaying outward, because the base of the shape can contract while the legs are constrained by the mold. This can be overcome by designing the mold cavity to slope the leg inward to begin with. Also, long horizontal sections tend to sag in the middle if ribs are not incorporated, so a distortion allowance may be required.\nCores may be used in expendable mold processes to produce internal features. The core can be of metal but it is usually done in sand.\nFilling.\nThere are a few common methods for filling the mold cavity: \"gravity\", \"low-pressure\", \"high-pressure\", and \"vacuum\".\nVacuum filling, also known as \"counter-gravity\" filling, is more metal efficient than gravity pouring because less material solidifies in the gating system. Gravity pouring only has a 15 to 50% metal yield as compared to 60 to 95% for vacuum pouring. There is also less turbulence, so the gating system can be simplified since it does not have to control turbulence. Plus, because the metal is drawn from below the top of the pool the metal is free from dross and slag, as these are lower density (lighter) and float to the top of the pool. The pressure differential helps the metal flow into every intricacy of the mold. Finally, lower temperatures can be used, which improves the grain structure. The first patented vacuum casting machine and process dates to 1879.\nLow-pressure filling uses 5 to 15\u00a0psig (35 to 100\u00a0kPag) of air pressure to force liquid metal up a feed tube into the mold cavity. This eliminates turbulence found in gravity casting and increases density, repeatability, tolerances, and grain uniformity. After the casting has solidified the pressure is released and any remaining liquid returns to the crucible, which increases yield.\nTilt filling.\n\"Tilt filling\", also known as \"tilt casting\", is an uncommon filling technique where the crucible is attached to the gating system and both are slowly rotated so that the metal enters the mold cavity with little turbulence. The goal is to reduce porosity and inclusions by limiting turbulence. For most uses tilt filling is not feasible because the following inherent problem: if the system is rotated slow enough to not induce turbulence, the front of the metal stream begins to solidify, which results in mis-runs. If the system is rotated faster it induces turbulence, which defeats the purpose. Durville of France was the first to try tilt casting, in the 1800s. He tried to use it to reduce surface defects when casting coinage from aluminium bronze.\nMacrostructure.\nThe grain macrostructure in ingots and most castings have three distinct regions or zones: the chill zone, columnar zone, and equiaxed zone. The image below depicts these zones.\nThe chill zone is named so because it occurs at the walls of the mold where the wall \"chills\" the material. Here is where the nucleation phase of the solidification process takes place. As more heat is removed the grains grow towards the center of the casting. These are thin, long \"columns\" that are perpendicular to the casting surface, which are undesirable because they have anisotropic properties. Finally, in the center the equiaxed zone contains spherical, randomly oriented crystals. These are desirable because they have isotropic properties. The creation of this zone can be promoted by using a low pouring temperature, alloy inclusions, or inoculants.\nInspection.\nCommon inspection methods for steel castings are \"magnetic particle testing\" and \"liquid penetrant testing\". Common inspection methods for aluminum castings are \"radiography\", \"ultrasonic testing\", and \"liquid penetrant testing\".\nDefects.\nThere are a number of problems that can be encountered during the casting process. The main types are: \"gas porosity\", \"shrinkage defects\", \"mold material defects\", \"pouring metal defects\", and \"metallurgical defects\".\nCasting process simulation.\n uses numerical methods to calculate cast component quality considering mold filling, solidification and cooling, and provides a quantitative prediction of casting mechanical properties, thermal stresses and distortion. Simulation accurately describes a cast component's quality up-front before production starts. The casting rigging can be designed with respect to the required component properties. This has benefits beyond a reduction in pre-production sampling, as the precise layout of the complete casting system also leads to energy, material, and tooling savings.\nThe software supports the user in component design, the determination of melting practice and casting methoding through to pattern and mold making, heat treatment, and finishing. This saves costs along the entire casting manufacturing route.\nCasting process simulation was initially developed at universities starting from the early 1970s, mainly in Europe and in the U.S., and is regarded as the most important innovation in casting technology over the last 50 years. Since the late 1980s, commercial programs are available which make it possible for foundries to gain new insight into what is happening inside the mold or die during the casting process.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was introduced in the original film trilogy as the main protagonist and also appears in the sequel trilogy. Raised as a poor moisture farmer on the desert planet Tatooine, Luke joins the Rebel Alliance and becomes a major figure in its struggle against the Galactic Empire. Training as a Jedi Knight under Jedi Masters Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda, he eventually confronts his father, the Sith Lord Darth Vader, in two pivotal duels. Years later, Luke trains his nephew Ben Solo and mentors the scavenger Rey. Luke is the twin brother of Leia Organa.\nMark Hamill portrays Luke in all the films of the original and sequel trilogies, as well as in the television series \"The Mandalorian\" and \"The Book of Boba Fett\". Hamill won the Saturn Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of Luke in \"The Empire Strikes Back\" (1980), \"Return of the Jedi\" (1983) and \"The Last Jedi\" (2017). He was also nominated for the award for his performance in \"Star Wars\" (1977). Luke also appears in novels, comics, and video games.\nCreation and development.\n\"Star Wars\" (1977).\nGeorge Lucas considered various characterizations for the protagonist of the original \"Star Wars\" film. The possibilities included a 60-year-old grizzled war hero, a Jedi Master, a dwarf, and a woman. Luke's original surname was \"Starkiller\", and it remained in the script until a few months into filming. It was dropped due to what Lucas called \"unpleasant connotations\" with Charles Manson, who became a \"star killer\" in 1969 when he murdered the well-known actress Sharon Tate. Lucas replaced the problematic name \"Starkiller\" with \"Skywalker\".\n\"Return of the Jedi\" (1983).\nAn alternate ending to the film reportedly featured Luke disappearing into the wilderness \"like Clint Eastwood in the spaghetti Westerns.\"\n\"The Force Awakens\" (2015).\nLuke's lack of screen time in \"The Force Awakens\" was due to concerns by screenwriter Michael Arndt that his presence would distract from Rey, leading to an agreement that he be removed from the screen and instead become a plot device. Hamill attended meetings for script readings, and helped conceal Luke's role in the film; instead of dialogue, he read stage directions. According to director and co-writer J. J. Abrams, this allowed Hamill to remain involved and his reading helped make a \"better experience for everyone.\"\nPortrayal.\nMark Hamill was originally cast as Luke for \"Star Wars\" (1977). Other actors who auditioned for the role include Robby Benson, William Katt, Kurt Russell, and Charles Martin Smith. Hamill was injured in a car accident in January 1977, fracturing his nose and cheekbone. Lucas justified the slight change to Hamill's likeness this would impose upon the sequel film, \"The Empire Strikes Back\" (1980), by asserting that in the interim between the two films, Luke had been fighting for the Rebel Alliance. It was speculated that the wampa attack at the beginning of \"The Empire Strikes Back\" was written in to explain his facial injuries, but Lucas disputed this in the DVD commentary of the film.\nAppearances.\nOriginal trilogy.\n\"Star Wars\".\nLuke was introduced in \"Star Wars\" (1977), the first film of the original trilogy. He is portrayed by Mark Hamill in all three films of the trilogy. At the beginning of the film, Luke is living on a moisture farm on the desert planet Tatooine with his uncle Owen and aunt Beru. After his uncle purchases the droids C-3PO and R2-D2, Luke finds a message from Princess Leia of Alderaan inside R2-D2. When R2-D2 goes missing, Luke goes out to search for the droid, and is saved from Tusken Raiders by Obi-Wan Kenobi, an elderly hermit. R2-D2 plays the message from Leia, in which she asks Obi-Wan to help her defeat the Galactic Empire. Obi-Wan says that he and Luke's father were once Jedi Knights, and that Luke's father was murdered by a traitorous Jedi named Darth Vader. Obi-Wan presents Luke with his father's lightsaber and offers to take him to Alderaan and train him in the ways of the Force. Luke declines his offer, feeling obligated to his family's farm.\nLuke changes his mind when he finds that Imperial stormtroopers have killed his aunt and uncle. He and Obi-Wan travel to Mos Eisley, where they meet the smugglers Han Solo and Chewbacca. They hire the duo to take them to Alderaan on the \"Millennium Falcon\", only to discover that it has been destroyed by the Death Star, the Empire's battle station. The \"Falcon\" is brought to the Death Star via tractor beam, and Luke and Han disguise themselves as stormtroopers to infiltrate the station. When they discover Leia is being held captive, Luke persuades Han and Chewbacca to help rescue her. Obi-Wan deactivates the tractor beam, then sacrifices his life in a duel with Vader so the others can escape. Luke joins the Rebel Alliance and pilots an X-wing during the Battle of Yavin. He and other Rebels attempt to destroy the Death Star by launching torpedoes into an exhaust port. As he approaches the port, Luke hears Obi-Wan's voice, telling him to trust his feelings. He switches off his ship's missile guidance system, instead using the Force to guide the torpedoes. After destroying the Death Star, Luke receives a medal of honor from Leia.\n\"The Empire Strikes Back\".\nLuke returns in \"The Empire Strikes Back\" (1980). Three years after the destruction of the Death Star, Luke is now a commander in the Rebel Alliance. While on the ice planet Hoth, he is captured by a wampa, but manages to escape. Obi-Wan appears to him as a Force spirit and urges him to complete his training with the Jedi Master Yoda. When the Empire discovers the Rebel base, Luke leads a squadron of snowspeeders against the opposing AT-AT walkers, but is forced to retreat. After escaping in his X-wing, he travels to Dagobah and meets Yoda. He undergoes rigorous Jedi training, quickly expanding his Force abilities.\nWhile on Dagobah, Luke has a vision of his friends in danger. Against the advice of both Obi-Wan and Yoda to stay and complete his training, he travels to Cloud City to help them, unwittingly falling into a trap set by Vader. He engages in a lightsaber duel with Vader, and is overpowered. After severing Luke's hand, Vader reveals that he is Luke's father, and invites him to join the dark side of the Force and rule the galaxy with him. Luke throws himself into a chasm, and finds himself on the underside of Cloud City. Hanging onto a slender rod, he uses the Force to contact Leia, who is leaving in the \"Falcon\". She hears his plea, and Chewbacca turns the ship around to rescue him. After Luke returns to the Rebel fleet, his severed hand is replaced with a bio-mechanical one.\n\"Return of the Jedi\".\nA year later, Luke is a Jedi Knight and has constructed his own lightsaber. At the beginning of \"Return of the Jedi\" (1983), he returns to Tatooine with Leia, Chewbacca and Lando Calrissian to rescue Han, who was frozen in carbonite and delivered to the crime lord Jabba the Hutt. Luke offers to negotiate with Jabba, who rejects his offer and imprisons him with a giant beast called a rancor. When Luke kills the rancor, Jabba decides to execute him, Han and Chewbacca by casting them into a Sarlacc pit. Luke escapes with R2-D2's help, saving his friends and destroying Jabba's sail barge. Luke returns to Dagobah, where he learns from a dying Yoda that Vader is indeed his father. Luke is then informed by Obi-Wan's spirit that he has a twin sister, whom he realizes is Leia. Both Yoda and Obi-Wan tell Luke that he must face Vader again to finish his training and save the galaxy, but he is disturbed by the idea of killing his father.\nWhile his companions undertake a mission on Endor, Luke surrenders to Vader in an attempt to bring him back from the dark side. Vader takes his son to the second Death Star and brings him before the Emperor, who attempts to seduce him to the dark side. Luke lashes out at the Emperor with his lightsaber, but Vader blocks his strike, and the two of them duel once again. As Luke regains control of his emotions, Vader senses that he has a sister, and threatens to turn her to the dark side if Luke will not submit. Enraged, Luke overpowers Vader and severs his hand. The Emperor then orders Luke to kill Vader and take his place, but Luke refuses. The Emperor begins torturing Luke with Force lightning, and Luke calls out to his father for help. Vader hesitates, then throws the Emperor down a reactor shaft to his death. Mortally wounded, Vader asks his son to remove his mask, which allows Luke to look upon the face of Anakin Skywalker for the first time. On Endor, Luke burns his father's body on a funeral pyre. As the Rebels celebrate the destruction of the Death Star and the fall of the Empire, Luke sees Anakin's spirit appear alongside the spirits of Obi-Wan and Yoda.\n\"Revenge of the Sith\".\nIn the prequel film \"Revenge of the Sith\" (2005), Padm\u00e9 Amidala gives birth to the twins Luke and Leia and then dies. Obi-Wan and Yoda agree to separate the twins in order to protect them from their father, Vader, and the newly created Galactic Empire. Obi-Wan takes Luke to the desert planet Tatooine, where he is adopted by Vader's stepbrother, Owen Lars, and his wife Beru. Leia is adopted by Senator Bail Organa of Alderaan. Both infants are portrayed by Aidan Barton, the son of Roger Barton, an editor of the film.\nSequel trilogy.\nThe first film of the sequel trilogy, ' (2015), occurs thirty years after the destruction of the second Death Star. Hamill reprises his role as Luke in all three films. The opening crawl of \"The Force Awakens\" reveals that Luke disappeared after his nephew and Jedi apprentice, Ben Solo, turned to the dark side and became Kylo Ren, a warlord of the First Order. The Resistance, led by Leia, manage to locate Luke on the planet Ahch-To; the Force-sensitive scavenger Rey then travels to the planet and offers him his lightsaber. At the beginning of ' (2017), Luke tosses the lightsaber aside. He refuses to talk to Rey, but eventually inquires about his family. Rey tells him about Han Solo's death at the hands of his son Ren, and explains that the First Order now rules the galaxy. She asks Luke to train her in the ways of the Force, but he is reluctant. He tells her it is time for the Jedi Order to end.Luke eventually begins instructing Rey, but is afraid of her power. He tells her the history of the Jedi Order, and how Darth Sidious rose to power. He claims the Jedi were partly responsible for his father's fall to the dark side. Luke admits that he briefly considered killing his nephew after seeing a vision of the destruction he could cause; when Ben woke to see Luke with his lightsaber drawn, he felt betrayed and left his training. Rey urges Luke to help her redeem Ben, but he refuses. When Rey leaves, Luke tries to burn the Jedi temple, but fails. He is then visited by the spirit of Yoda, who assures him that he still has a purpose. Later, Luke appears on Crait, where the Resistance is besieged. He apologizes to Leia for allowing Ben to fall to the dark side, then steps in front of the First Order forces. He survives an onslaught of blaster fire, then engages Ren in lightsaber combat. Ren seemingly cuts through him, but Luke is unharmed; he is still on Ahch-To, having used the Force to project himself to Crait. He then collapses and becomes one with the Force. His battle with Ren gave the Resistance time to escape the planet. \nLuke returns in the final film of the trilogy, \"\" (2019). After Rey defeats Ren in a lightsaber duel, she flies his TIE fighter to Ahch-To, then burns the ship. When she throws Luke's lightsaber into the flames, he appears as a Force spirit and catches it. He reprimands her for treating the weapon with disrespect, and admits he was wrong not to participate in the Resistance. He thanks Rey for helping him rediscover himself, and urges her to continue her battle against the Sith. He gives her Leia's lightsaber and his X-wing for her journey to Exegol. After Rey vanquishes Sidious, she visits the moisture farm where Luke was raised. When a passerby asks Rey who she is, she notices the spirits of Luke and Leia nearby, and replies \"Rey Skywalker.\"\nSeries.\nHamill portrays Luke in \"\", the season two finale of the live-action series \"The Mandalorian\". The Force-sensitive infant Grogu had contacted him in , and Luke now arrives to collect him and begin his Jedi training. Luke also destroys a group of Dark Troopers that were threatening Grogu and his guardian, Din Djarin.\nThe series \"The Book of Boba Fett\" features Hamill as Luke in the episode \"Chapter 6: From the Desert Comes a Stranger\". While training Grogu, Luke helps him remember some of his past, including his home at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant and the events of the Great Jedi Purge. Soon after, Djarin sends Luke a gift for Grogu: beskar chain mail forged by the Armorer. Unsure whether Grogu is committed to the Jedi path, Luke decides to let the child choose his own destiny. He invites him to choose between the chain mail and a lightsaber that belonged to Yoda. In \"Chapter 7: In The Name of Honor\", it is revealed that Grogu chose the chain mail, which leads Luke to send him back to Djarin.\nLuke appears in two episodes of the animated web series \"Forces of Destiny\", voiced by Hamill. The episode \"The Path Ahead\" details his training with Yoda on Dagobah. In \"Traps and Tribulations\", he and Leia help the Ewoks stop a rampaging beast known as a Gorax. Grant Feely portrays Luke as a ten-year-old child in the series \"Obi-Wan Kenobi\" (2022).\nNovels and comics.\nThe 2015 novel \"Heir to the Jedi\" takes place between \"Star Wars\" and \"The Empire Strikes Back\", and chronicles the adventures of Luke as he continues to battle the Empire with his Rebel companions. He grows close with Nakari Kelen, a fellow Rebel, and he begins to develop his Force abilities. The novel is written from the first-person perspective of Luke, and is only the second \"Star Wars\" novel to utilize this type of narrative voice. Luke is featured in the junior novel \"The Legends of Luke Skywalker\", which was adapted as a manga. He also appears in the 2015 comic \"Star Wars\", which is set between the films of the original trilogy. The 2022 novel \"Shadow of the Sith\", which is set between \"Return of the Jedi\" and \"The Force Awakens\", follows Luke and Lando Calrissian as they search for Exegol.\nOther.\nHamill provides Luke's voice in \"The Star Wars Holiday Special\" (1978) and in radio adaptations of \"Star Wars\" (1981) and \"The Empire Strikes Back\" (1983). Joshua Fardon voices Luke in the \"Return of the Jedi\" radio drama. Luke also appears in video games, in which he is voiced by a variety of different actors.\n\"Star Wars Legends\".\nFollowing the acquisition of Lucasfilm by The Walt Disney Company in 2012, most of the licensed \"Star Wars\" novels and comics produced between 1977 and 2014 were rebranded as \"Star Wars Legends\" and declared non-canon to the franchise. The \"Legends\" works comprise a separate narrative universe.\nNovels.\nThe novel \"The Truce at Bakura\" (1997) takes place one day after the Battle of Endor. Luke and his friend Wedge Antilles recover a message droid from the planet Bakura, which is being invaded by the Ssi-Ruuk. Luke turns back the army and meets Dev Sibwarra, a Force-sensitive human who had been captured by the Ssi-Ruuk. Sibwarra is eventually killed after turning against his captors. \"The Courtship of Princess Leia\" (1995) is set four years after the Battle of Endor. Luke travels to the planet Dathomir, where he encounters the Force-sensitive Witches of Dathomir. He discovers a prophecy stating that a Jedi will change the way of life on Dathomir, and he eventually realizes what the Force truly is. Luke destroys most of the Nightsisters\u2014a group of dark-side witches\u2014and their leader Gethzirion. He also terminates Zsinj, the galaxy's most powerful warlord. Luke recovers Jedi records left by Yoda roughly 400 years prior, then decides to start a new Jedi Academy.\nIn the \"Thrawn\" trilogy, Luke meets Mara Jade, the former Emperor's Hand who is bound by Palpatine's disembodied voice that repeatedly commands \"You will kill Luke Skywalker\". Although she was ready to terminate Luke to stop the voice, she keeps him alive so he can help her escape from danger. Despite her threats, Luke learns about the spell Mara is under and vows to free her from it. Later, Luke and Mara fight against Luke's clone, Luuke Skywalker, a creation of Joruus C'baoth. Mara destroys the clone and eliminates C'baoth with help from Leia. Mara's curse is then silenced.\nLuke resigns his commission in the New Republic starfighter corps in the \"Jedi Academy\" trilogy. He turns his attention to his Jedi studies and begins to rebuild the Jedi Order in the Massassi Temple on Yavin 4, a decision some anti-Jedi politicians use against him. He is forced to contend with the spirit of the ancient Sith Lord Exar Kun, who lures one of his most powerful students, Kyp Durron, to the dark side. In the \"Hand of Thrawn Duology\", Luke is a Jedi Master. He works again with Mara, who has gained knowledge of the Force since her training at Luke's Jedi Academy. Luke falls in love with her and they eventually marry. In \"\", they have a son whom they name Ben, after Obi-Wan's alias.\nLuke creates a New Jedi Council in the \"New Jedi Order\" series. He envisions a conclave composed of Jedi, politicians and military officers. In \"\", he spearheads a mission to the Unknown Regions during the Yuuzhan Vong invasion to find the mysterious planet Zonama Sekot, which creates living starships. After the invaders are defeated, Luke leads the New Jedi Order on Denon, the temporary capital of the Galactic Alliance.\nIn \"The Swarm War\", the Order moves to Ossus, the site of Jedi temples and libraries that were mostly destroyed 4,000 years prior. Upon the Killik's invasion of Chiss space and the transformation of most of the Myrkr mission survivors into Killik Joiners, Luke deduces that the Killik's collective mind is being unconsciously controlled by a hive called the Dark Nest. The hive, in turn, is controlled by a former Nightsister named Lomi Plo, who became the Unseen Queen through her ability to become invisible by exploiting the doubts of inferiors. One of the Myrkr survivors, Alema Rar, suggests to Luke that Mara may be responsible for the death of his mother. Luke almost believes the lie due to Mara's previous role as the Emperor's Hand. His doubts are assuaged when he discovers several hologram recordings hidden in R2-D2's memory. He sees his father Force-choking his mother on Mustafar, as well as his own birth and his mother's death. Luke defeats Lomi Plo in the final battle of the Swarm War, cutting her into four pieces.\nIn the \"Legacy of the Force\" series, a schism develops between Luke and his nephew, Jacen Solo. Already a powerful Jedi, Jacen has begun adopting radical interpretations of the Force, which causes a dramatic change in his personality and makes Luke afraid that he will fall to the dark side. During this time, Luke begins having visions of a dark figure destroying the galaxy and the Jedi. The situation worsens in \"Bloodlines\", when Luke's son Ben becomes Jacen's apprentice. In \"Tempest\", Luke determines that the figure from his visions is Lumiya, a former Emperor's Hand now known as the \"Dark Lady of the Sith\".\nWhen Mara is murdered in \"Sacrifice\", Lumiya convinces Luke that she killed her. They battle, and Luke saves Lumiya from falling to her death so that he can kill her himself. However, he later realizes that Lumiya could not have killed Mara. He breaks down over the death of his wife, knowing that her murderer is still at large. He does not realize that the killer is Jacen, who has taken the Sith name Darth Caedus. In \"Revelation\", Ben proves that Jacen killed Mara, but Luke is reluctant to destroy Jacen, fearing that he or Ben may fall to the dark side in the process. The decision is taken out of his hands in \"Invincible\", when Jaina kills Jacen in a lightsaber duel.\nThe \"Fate of the Jedi\" novels are set about forty years after the original \"Star Wars\" film. Now in his sixties, Luke is deposed from his position as Grand Master and exiled from Coruscant. He will be allowed to return if he can discover why Jacen fell to the dark side. Luke and Ben embark on a journey together, exploring dangerous and little-known parts of the galaxy. They learn about each other, about the Force, and about the great dangers threatening the Jedi. The love between them grows greater as they repeatedly save each other's lives.\nThe Matthew Stover novel \"Luke Skywalker and the Shadows of Mindor\" (2008) takes place shortly after \"Return of the Jedi\" and the novel \"Prophets of the Dark Side\". Luke and the Rebel Alliance are attempting to stop Lord Shadowspawn and his \"shadow stormtroopers\", a struggle which culminates in the Battle of Mindor. Stover said \"Shadows of Mindor\" was meant to evoke Brian Daley's Han Solo novels, which are Stover's favorite \"Star Wars\" books.\nComics.\nLuke appears in the Marvel-published comic adaptations of the original trilogy, as well as an ongoing series that ran from 1977 to 1986. He also appears in numerous titles released by Dark Horse Comics, including \"\". In this series, which takes place 125 years after the events of the original trilogy, Luke appears to his descendant Cade Skywalker as a Force spirit. He persuades Cade to once again become a Jedi in order to defeat Darth Krayt and his burgeoning Sith Empire.\nReception.\nSome \"Star Wars\" fans have expressed disappointment with the depiction of Luke in \"The Last Jedi\", a film which was directed by Rian Johnson. According to \"Digital Spy\", the central complaint is that Luke appears to be \"a grumpy old man whose failures [have] driven him into hiding\". Before the film was released, Hamill said he fundamentally disagreed with Johnson's vision for the character. He later said he regretted making a public statement about his displeasure with the character, and asserted that he was willing to do his part to realize Johnson's vision.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nhttps:// in the \"StarWars.com\" Databank"}
{"id": "53603", "revid": "1296016433", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53603", "title": "Double star", "text": "Pair of stars that appear close to each other\nIn observational astronomy, a double star or visual double is a pair of stars that appear close to each other as viewed from Earth, especially with the aid of optical telescopes.\nThis occurs because the pair either forms a binary star (i.e. a binary system of stars in mutual orbit, gravitationally bound to each other) or is an \"optical double\", a chance line-of-sight alignment of two stars at different distances from the observer. Binary stars are important to stellar astronomers as knowledge of their motions allows direct calculation of stellar mass and other stellar parameters. The only (possible) case of \"binary star\" whose two components are separately visible to the naked eye is the case of Mizar and Alcor (though actually a multiple-star system), but it is not known for certain whether Mizar and Alcor are gravitationally bound.\nSince the beginning of the 1780s, both professional and amateur double star observers have telescopically measured the distances and angles between double stars to determine the relative motions of the pairs. If the relative motion of a pair determines a curved arc of an orbit, or if the relative motion is small compared to the common proper motion of both stars, it may be concluded that the pair is in mutual orbit as a binary star. Otherwise, the pair is optical. Multiple stars are also studied in this way, although the dynamics of multiple stellar systems are more complex than those of binary stars.\nThe following are three types of paired stars:\nImprovements in telescopes can shift previously non-visual binaries into visual binaries, as happened with Polaris A in 2006. It is only the inability to telescopically observe two separate stars that distinguishes non-visual and visual binaries.\nHistory.\nMizar, in Ursa Major, was observed to be double by Benedetto Castelli and Galileo. The identification of other doubles soon followed: Robert Hooke discovered one of the first double-star systems, Gamma Arietis, in 1664, while the bright southern star Acrux, in the Southern Cross, was discovered to be double by Fontenay in 1685. Since that time, the search has been carried out thoroughly and the entire sky has been examined for double stars down to a limiting apparent magnitude of about 9.0. At least 1 in 18 stars brighter than 9.0 magnitude in the northern half of the sky are known to be double stars visible with a telescope.\nThe unrelated categories of optical doubles and true binaries are lumped together for historical and practical reasons. When Mizar was found to be a binary, it was quite difficult to determine whether a double star was a binary system or only an optical double. Improved telescopes, spectroscopy, and photography are the basic tools used to make the distinction. After it was determined to be a visual binary, Mizar's components were found to be spectroscopic binaries themselves.\nObservation of double stars.\nObservation of visual double stars by visual measurement will yield the \"separation\", or angular distance, between the two component stars in the sky and the \"position angle\". The position angle specifies the direction in which the stars are separated and is defined as the bearing from the brighter component to the fainter, where north is 0\u00b0. These measurements are called \"measures\". In the measures of a visual binary, the position angle will change progressively and the separation between the two stars will oscillate between maximum and minimum values. Plotting the measures in the plane will produce an ellipse. This is the \"apparent orbit\", the projection of the orbit of the two stars onto the celestial sphere; the true orbit can be computed from it. Although it is expected that the majority of catalogued visual doubles are visual binaries, orbits have been computed for only a few thousand of the over 100,000 known visual double stars.\nDistinction between binary stars and other double stars.\nConfirmation of a visual double star as a binary star can be achieved by observing the relative motion of the components. If the motion is part of an orbit, or if the stars have similar radial velocities or the difference in their proper motions is small compared to their common proper motion, the pair is probably physical. When observed over a short period of time, the components of both optical doubles and long-period visual binaries will appear to be moving in straight lines; for this reason, it can be difficult to distinguish between these two possibilities.\nDesignations.\nSome bright visual double stars have a Bayer designation. In this case, the components may be denoted by superscripts. An example of this is \u03b1 Crucis (Acrux), whose components are \u03b11 Crucis and \u03b12 Crucis. Since \u03b11 Crucis is a spectroscopic binary, this is actually a multiple star. Superscripts are also used to distinguish more distant, physically unrelated, pairs of stars with the same Bayer designation, such as \u03b11,2 Capricorni, \u03be1,2 Centauri, and \u03be1,2 Sagittarii. These optical pairs are resolvable by the naked eye.\nApart from these pairs, the components of a double star are generally denoted by the letters A (for the brighter, \"primary\", star) and B (for the fainter, \"secondary\", star) appended to the designation, of whatever sort, of the double star. For example, the components of \u03b1 Canis Majoris (Sirius) are \u03b1 Canis Majoris A and \u03b1 Canis Majoris B (Sirius A and Sirius B); the components of 44 Bo\u00f6tis are 44 Bo\u00f6tis A and 44 Bo\u00f6tis B; the components of ADS 16402 are ADS 16402A and ADS 16402B; and so on. The letters AB may be used together to designate the pair. In the case of multiple stars, the letters C, D, and so on may be used to denote additional components, often in order of increasing separation from the brightest star, A.\nVisual doubles are also designated by an abbreviation for the name of their discoverer followed by a catalogue number unique to that observer. For example, the pair \u03b1 Centauri AB was discovered by Father Richaud in 1689, and so is designated \"RHD 1\". Other examples include \u039465, the 65th double discovered by James Dunlop, and \u03a32451, discovered by F. G. W. Struve.\nThe Washington Double Star Catalog, a large database of double and multiple stars, contains over 100,000 entries, each of which gives measures for the separation of two components. Each double star forms one entry in the catalog; multiple stars with \"n\" components will be represented by entries in the catalog for \"n\"\u22121 pairs, each giving the separation of one component of the multiple star from another. Codes such as AC are used to denote which components are being measured\u2014in this case, component C relative to component A. This may be altered to a form such as AB-D to indicate the separation of a component from a close pair of components (in this case, component D relative to the pair AB.) Codes such as \"Aa\" may also be used to denote a component which is being measured relative to another component, A in this case.

{"id": "53604", "revid": "32823000", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53604", "title": "Adolf Loos", "text": "Austrian and Czechoslovak architect and theorist of modern architecture\nAdolf Franz Karl Viktor Maria Loos (; 10 December 1870\u00a0\u2013 23 August 1933) was an Austrian and Czechoslovak architect, influential European theorist, polemicist of modern architecture. He was inspired by modernism and a widely-known critic of the Art Nouveau movement. His controversial views and literary contributions sparked the establishment of the Vienna Secession movement and postmodernism.\nLoos was born in Brno to a family of sculptors and stonemasons. His father, a stonemason who was almost deaf, died when he was 9 and played a role in Loos' interest in arts and crafts. Loos later inherited his father's hearing impairment and other health-related issues. His lack of hearing contributed to his solitary personality. Loos had three tumultuous marriages that all ended in divorce, and was convicted as a pedophile in 1928.\nLoos attended multiple colleges also due to his poor academics and changing interests, which provided him a diverse skillset for architecture. After leaving his last university, Loos visited America and was strongly impacted by the Chicago School of Architecture, inspired by \"form follows function\" philosophy of architect Louis Sullivan.\nLoos then went on to write many literary pieces including the satirical piece \"The Story of a Poor Rich Man\" and his most popular manifesto, \"Ornament and Crime\", which advocated for a lack of ornamentation, exemplified in his design of Looshaus, Vienna, in contrast to both the lavish decorations of the fin de si\u00e8cle and the more modern aesthetic principles of the Vienna Secession.\nLoos became a pioneer of modern architecture and contributed a body of theory and criticism of Modernism in architecture and design and developed the \"Raumplan\" (literally \"spatial plan\") method of arranging interior spaces, exemplified in Villa M\u00fcller in Prague. He died aged 62 on 23 August 1933 in Kalksburg near Vienna.\nEarly life.\nYouth.\nLoos was born into a family of artisans on 10 December 1870 in Brno, in the Margraviate of Moravia region of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, today the eastern part of the Czech Republic. His father Adolf Loos was a German stonemason who died when Loos was nine years old. His mother, Marie Loos, was a sculptor who later carried on the masonry business after her husband's death. Young Adolf Loos had inherited his father's hearing impairment and was significantly handicapped by it throughout his life, contributing to his solitary character.\nEducation.\nLoos attended several Gymnasium schools and sought a variety of programs. In 1884, Loos began his studies at the Stiftsgymnasium Melk for only a few months after failing an exam. He then studied mechanics at the Royal and Imperial State Technical College in Liberec, but dropped to pursue building technology. He then returned to mechanics again at State Crafts School in Brno in 1889, and changed to architecture by studying at Dresden University of Technology from 1890 to 1893. Loos ultimately did not receive any academic degree due to his sporadic education pursuits, poor academics, and his enrollment in the Austrian military in 1889. \nLoos' diverse educational background provided him with a vast skillset which proved to be useful. He could comprehend masonry and craftsman work and its impact on architecture, prompting recognition by many scholars based on his expertise.\nCareer.\nUnited States.\nPost college, Loos traveled to the United States from 1893 to 1896 to learn about outside architecture. He started in New York and financially supported himself by working as a mason, a floor-layer, and a dish-washer. These jobs allowed Loos to move to the Philadelphia countryside with his uncle Benjamin, where he worked as a watchmaker. Living on the countryside made Loos admire America's rural culture, but he traveled to New York and Chicago to explore American metropolitan architecture.\nOn his first visit to Chicago, Loos was immediately inspired by the new American skyscrapers and the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893. Specifically, he was inspired by the architect Louis Sullivan and the Chicago School of Architecture, approving of Sullivan's concept of form follows function in his essay Ornament in Architecture.\nAlthough Loos left America in 1896, he became involved in Chicago's architectural scene. Inspired by Sullivan, in 1922 Loos submitted a building design for the Chicago Tribune Tower Competition, where his design proposal followed a Doric column as the building's top, known as the Column Tower proposal. While he did not win, his architecture inspired later Postmodern architects of the 1980s and '90s.\nVienna.\nLoos returned to Vienna in 1896 and made it his permanent residence. He was a prominent figure in the city and a friend of prominent Viennese figures such as Ludwig Wittgenstein, Arnold Schoenberg, Peter Altenberg and Karl Kraus.\nInspired by his years in the New World, Loos devoted himself to architecture. After briefly associating himself with the Vienna Secession in 1896, he rejected the style and advocated a new, plain, unadorned architecture. A utilitarian approach to use the entire floor plan completed his concept. Loos's early commissions consisted of interior designs for shops and caf\u00e9s in Vienna.\nArchitectural theory.\nLoos authored several polemical works. In \"Spoken into the Void\", published in 1900, he attacked the Vienna Secession, at a time when the movement was at its peak.\nIn his essays, Loos used provocative catchphrases and is noted for the essay/manifesto entitled \"Ornament and Crime\", given in a lecture in 1910 and first published in 1913. He explored the idea that the progress of culture is associated with the elimination of ornament from everyday objects, asserting, \"the evolution of culture is synonymous with the removal of ornamentation from objects of everyday use.\" It was therefore a crime to force craftsmen or builders to waste their time on ornamentation that served to hasten the time when an object would become obsolete (design theory). Loos's stripped-down buildings influenced the minimal massing of modern architecture, and stirred controversy. Although noted for the lack of ornamentation on their exteriors, the interiors of many of Loos's buildings are finished with rich and expensive materials, notably stone, marble and wood, displaying natural patterns and textures in flat planes, executed in first rate craftsmanship. The distinction is not between complicated and simple, but between purposeful, \"organic\" decoration, such as that created by indigenous cultures (Loos mentions African textiles and Persian rugs), and superfluous decoration.\nLoos collected sterling silver and high quality leather goods, which he noted for their plain yet luxurious appeal. The objects displayed opulence through their material alone, without adding unnecessary ornamentation. His glassware, produced by Lobmeyer, is still in production today. He also enjoyed fashion and men's clothing, designing the interior of the famed Kn\u00ed\u017ee of Vienna, a haberdashery. His admiration for the fashion and culture of England and America can be seen in his short-lived publication \"Das Andere\", which ran for just two issues in 1903 and included advertisements for 'English' clothing. In 1920, he had a brief collaboration with Frederick John Kiesler, an architect, theater and art-exhibition designer.\nLoos House and other projects.\nFrom 1904 on, he was able to carry out big projects; the most notable was the so-called \"Looshaus\" (built from 1910 to 1912), originally for the Viennese tailor Goldman and Salatsch, for whom Loos had designed a store interior in 1898, and situated right across from the Habsburg city residence Hofburg Palace. The house, today located at the address Michaelerplatz 3, Vienna, and under monument preservation, was criticized by its contemporaries. The facade was dominated by rectilinear window patterns and a lack of stucco decoration and awnings, which earned it the nickname \"House without Eyebrows\"; Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria was said to have despised the modern building so much that he avoided leaving the Hofburg Palace through a main gate in its vicinity. His work also includes the store of the men's fashion house Knize (built 1909\u201313), Am Graben 13, Caf\u00e9 Museum (built 1899), Operngasse 7, Vienna, and the \"American Bar\" (built 1907\u201308), K\u00e4rntnerstrasse 10, Vienna.\nLoos visited the island of Skyros in 1904 and was influenced by the cubic architecture of the Greek islands. When the Austro-Hungarian Empire collapsed after World War I Loos was awarded Czechoslovak citizenship by President Masaryk. His main place of residence remained in Vienna. During the First Austrian Republic Loos became interested in public projects. He designed several housing projects for the City of Vienna, which was then nicknamed Red Vienna. From 1924 to 1928 Loos lived in Paris. He taught at the Sorbonne and was contracted to build a house for Tristan Tzara, which was completed 1925 on Avenue Junot 15, Paris. In 1928 he returned to Vienna.\nLoos had an admiration for classical architecture, which is reflected in his writings and his entry to the 1922 Chicago Tribune competition. Loos's submission was a massive Doric column.\nPrivate life.\nMarriages.\nLoos was married three times. In July 1902, he married drama student Lina Loos. The marriage ended three years later in 1905. In 1919 when he was 49, he married 20-year-old Austrian-born Elsie Altmann, a dancer and operetta star and daughter of Adolf Altmann and Jeannette Gruenblatt. They divorced seven years later in 1926. In 1929 he married writer and photographer Claire Beck. She was the daughter of his clients Otto and Olga Beck, and 35 years his junior. They were divorced on 30 April 1932. Following their divorce, Claire Loos wrote \"Adolf Loos Privat\", a literary work of snapshot-like vignettes about Loos's character, habits and sayings, published by the Johannes-Presse in Vienna in 1936. The book was intended to raise funds for Loos' tomb.\nPoor health.\nAll his life, Loos suffered from a hearing impairment. When he was a child, he was deaf. He only acquired partial hearing at the age of 12. By the time he was 50 he was again nearly deaf. In 1918 Loos was diagnosed with cancer. His stomach, appendix and part of his intestine were removed.\nChild sexual abuse.\nIn 1928 Loos was disgraced by a pedophilia scandal in Vienna. He had commissioned young girls, aged 8 to 10, from poor families to act as models in his studio. The indictment stated that Loos had exposed himself and forced his young models to participate in sexual acts. He was found guilty of inducing minors to commit indecent acts by drawing them in indecent positions but acquitted of the other charges in a court decision of 1928. In 2008, the original case record was rediscovered and confirmed the accusation.\nDeath and legacy.\nAdolf Loos exhibited early signs of dementia around the time of his court proceedings. A few months before his death he suffered a stroke. He died aged 62 on 23 August 1933 in Kalksburg near Vienna. Loos's body was taken to Vienna's Zentralfriedhof to rest among the great artists and musicians of the city, including Schoenberg, Altenberg and Kraus, some of his closest friends and associates.\nThrough his writings and his groundbreaking projects in Vienna, Loos was able to influence other architects and designers, and the early development of Modernism. His careful selection of materials, passion for craftsmanship and use of 'Raumplan'\u2014the considered ordering and size of interior spaces based on function\u2014are still admired.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His works include the Museum of Modern Art, in New York City; the Parliament House of Pakistan in Islamabad; the Museo de Arte de Ponce in Ponce, Puerto Rico; the United States Embassy in New Delhi, India; The Keller Center at the University of Chicago; the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C., the EcoTarium, formerly known as the New England Science Center in Worcester, Massachusetts; and the campus of Windham College (which became Landmark College) in Putney, Vermont.\nEarly life.\nStone was born and raised in Fayetteville, Arkansas. He attended the University of Arkansas, where he joined the Sigma Nu fraternity, Harvard and M.I.T., but did not earn a degree. In 1927, he won the Rotch Travelling Scholarship, which afforded him the opportunity to travel through Europe on a two-year stipend. Stone was impressed by the new architecture he observed in Europe, buildings designed in what would come to be known as the International Style. He returned to the United States in 1929 and took up residence in Manhattan.\nCareer.\nHired by the architectural firm of Schultze and Weaver, he designed interiors for the new Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. He subsequently worked for the Associated Architects of Rockefeller Center and became the principal designer of Radio City Music Hall.\nStone was an early advocate of the International Style. His first independent commission was the Richard H. Mandel House, in Mount Kisco, New York (1933). This was followed by the Ulrich Kowalski house, also in Mt. Kisco (1934), and the Albert C. Koch house in Cambridge, Massachusetts (1936). In 1936, Stone was chosen as associate architect for the new Museum of Modern Art in New York City, designed in collaboration with Philip L. Goodwin. Stone also designed a private residence for MoMA president Anson Conger Goodyear, the A. Conger Goodyear House, in Old Westbury, NY (1938). Both the Richard H. Mandel House and A. Conger Goodyear House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\nAt the outset of World War II, Stone enlisted in the U.S. Army. He was promoted to the rank of major and served as chief of the Army Air Force Planning and Design Section. Returning to New York after the war, Stone was commissioned to design the ten-story El Panama Hotel in Panama City, Panama (1946), the University of Arkansas Fine Arts Center in Fayetteville (1948), and the 850-bed Hospital del Seguro Social del Empleado in Lima, Peru (1950).\nStone's best-known work was the Embassy of the United States in New Delhi, India (1959). Tasked with creating a modern building that respected the architectural heritage of its host country, he designed a temple-like pavilion on a raised podium. Frank Lloyd Wright called the embassy one of the most beautiful buildings he had ever seen, and it won a first honor award from the American Institute of Architects (AIA). Subsequent commissions such as the Stanford University Medical Center in Palo Alto, California (1955), the Stuart Pharmaceutical Company in Pasadena, California (1956), and the United States pavilion at the 1958 Brussels World's Fair (1957), repeated elements originally designed for the embassy. The Stuart building and World's Fair pavilion both won awards from the AIA, and Stone was elected to the Institute's College of Fellows in 1958.\nDescribed as romanticist, Stone's ornate designs brought him commercial success. By the 1960s, his firm was among the largest architectural practices in the United States, with over 200 employees and offices on both coasts. Buildings from this period include the North Carolina State Legislative Building in Raleigh (1960), the Pakistan Institute of Nuclear Science and Technology in Nilore (1961), the National Geographic Society building in Washington, D.C. (1961), the Museo de Arte in Ponce, Puerto Rico (1961), the uptown campus of the University at Albany (1962), the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. (1962), the General Motors Building in New York City (1964), the PepsiCo World Headquarters, in Purchase, New York (1967), and the EcoTarium in Worcester, Massachusetts, the Florida State Capital complex in Tallahassee, and the Standard Oil building (now known as the Aon Center) in Chicago, Illinois (all 1970).\nStone also was the architect of the former Windham College in Putney, Vermont. Windham closed in 1978 and its abandoned campus was taken over by the present-day Landmark College in 1985.\nFurthermore, Stone also designed Harvey Mudd College in Claremont, California. Harvey Mudd College is a highly ranked private liberal arts college, and according to Travel and Leisure Magazine in 2013, is one of \"America's ugliest college campuses\".\nStone retired in 1974 and died in 1978. Following a New York City funeral his ashes were buried in his hometown of Fayetteville.\nFootnotes.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nTwo views on 2 Columbus Circle"}

A winner of the Pritzker Architecture Prize in 1984, Meier has designed several iconic buildings including the Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art, the Getty Center in Los Angeles, the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, and San Jose City Hall. In 2018, some of Meier's employees accused him of sexual assault, which led to him resigning from his firm in 2021.\nEarly life and education.\nMeier was born to a Jewish family, the oldest of three sons of Carolyn (Kaltenbacher) and Jerome Meier, a wholesale wine and liquor salesman, in Newark, New Jersey. He grew up in nearby Maplewood, where he attended Columbia High School. He earned a Bachelor of Architecture degree from Cornell University in 1957.\nAfter graduating from Cornell, Meier traveled to Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Israel, and Italy, among other places, to network with architects.\nMeier is a second cousin of Peter Eisenman, an architect, theorist, and fellow member of The New York Five.\nCareer.\nIn New York City, Meier worked briefly in 1959 for Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, and then for three years for Marcel Breuer before starting his own firm in 1963.\nIn 1972, he was identified as one of The New York Five, a group of modernist architects: Meier, Peter Eisenman, Michael Graves, Charles Gwathmey, and John Hejduk. Early in his career, Meier worked with artists such as painter Frank Stella and favored structures that were white and geometric.\nMeier first gained recognition for his designs for various houses, for The Atheneum, a visitors center in New Harmony, Indiana (completed 1979), and for the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, Georgia (completed 1983).\nAlthough Meier was an acclaimed architect for years, his design for the Getty Center, a large museum complex in Los Angeles (completed 1997), brought him an elevated level of recognition. Other notable commissions from this period include museums such as the Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art in Spain (completed 1995) and the Paley Center for Media in Beverly Hills, California (completed 1996); The Hague, The Netherlands City Hall (completed 1995) and San Jose City Hall (completed 2005); commercial buildings such as the reconstruction of City Tower in Prague, Czech Republic (completed 2008); and residential buildings such as 173 and 176 Perry Street in the West Village of Manhattan (completed 2002) and Meier on Rothschild in Tel Aviv, Israel (completed 2015).\nToday, MeierPartners has offices in New York and Los Angeles, with projects ranging from China and Tel Aviv to Paris and Hamburg.\nMuch of Meier's work builds on the work of architects of the early to mid-20th century, especially that of Le Corbusier, particularly his early work. Meier is considered to have built more using Corbusier's ideas than anyone, including Le Corbusier himself. Meier expanded many ideas evident in Le Corbusier's work, particularly the Villa Savoye and the Swiss Pavilion.\nHis work also reflects the influences of other designers such as Mies Van der Rohe and, in some instances, Frank Lloyd Wright and Luis Barrag\u00e1n (without the colour). White has been used in many architectural landmark buildings throughout history, including cathedrals and the white-washed villages of the Mediterranean region, in Spain, southern Italy and Greece.\nThe Mayor of Rome, Gianni Alemanno, included in his campaign platform a promise to tear down the large travertine wall of Meier's Museum of the Ara Pacis. Alemmano had agreed with Meier to modifications including drastically reducing the height of the wall between an open-air space outside the museum and a busy road along the Tiber river. The city plans are to build a wide pedestrian area along the river and run the road underneath it. \"It's an improvement,\" says Meier, adding that \"the reason that wall was there has to do with traffic and noise. Once that is eliminated, the idea of opening the piazza to the river is a good one.\" The mayor's office said Alemanno hoped to complete the project before the end of his term in 2013.\nThe new project of the underpass along the river Tevere has not progressed since then and in 2024 the area is unchanged.\nRecognition.\nIn 1984, Meier was awarded the Pritzker Prize. The jury citation declared that Meier has \"created structures which are personal, vigorous, original.\" In 2008, he won the gold medal in architecture from the Academy of Arts and Letters and his work Jesolo Lido Village was awarded the Dedalo Minosse International Prize for commissioning a building. Meier is a Senior Fellow of the Design Futures Council. He was awarded the AIA Gold Medal in 1997. In 2013, he was awarded the A+ Lifetime Achievement Award. In 1996, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. In 2010, Cornell established a new professorship named for Meier.\nPaying tribute Meier on the occasion of his firm's 50th anniversary, the Fondazione Bisazza presented the exhibition \"Richard Meier: Architecture and Design\" in Vicenza, Italy.\nIn 2014, Meier opened a 15,000-square-foot exhibition space museum at Mana Contemporary in Jersey City. The space gathers much of his life's work under one roof, and replaces a much smaller version that opened in 2007 in Long Island City, Queens, and that until 2013 was open only by appointment to students and tour groups. The new venue provides room to show his own sculptures, architectural drawings and collages for the first time, and is planned to include a research library.\nSexual harassment accusation and resignation.\nOn March 13, 2018, \"The New York Times\" detailed allegations from women that Meier had sexually harassed or assaulted them. Meier responded by saying that he would take a leave of six months from his firm. In response to the allegations and Meier's apology, his alma mater Cornell University declined his intended endowment of a named chair and instituted a review of his previous donations. On April 6, 2018, an additional four women who formerly worked at Meier's architecture firm came forward with allegations against him. The most recent allegations dated to 2009. On October 9, 2018, the firm announced that his resignation was permanent.\nWorks.\nMajor works by Meier include the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, the Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art, the Getty Center, Meier on Rothschild, and On Prospect Park.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

Portman also had a particularly large impact on the cityscape of his hometown of Atlanta, with the Peachtree Center complex serving as downtown's business and tourism anchor from the 1970s onward. The Peachtree Center area includes Portman-designed Hyatt, Westin, and Marriott hotels. Portman's plans typically dealt with primitives in the forms of symmetrical squares and circles.\nEarly life and career.\nPortman was born on December 4, 1924, in Walhalla, South Carolina, to John C. Portman Sr. and Edna Rochester Portman. He had five sisters. He graduated from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1950. His firm completed the Merchandise Mart (now AmericasMart) in downtown Atlanta in 1961. The multi-block Peachtree Center was begun in 1965 and would expand to become the main center of hotel and office space in Downtown Atlanta, taking over from the Five Points area just to the south. Portman would develop a similar multiblock complex at San Francisco's Embarcadero Center (1970s), which unlike its Atlanta counterpart, heavily emphasized pedestrian activity at street level.\nThe Hyatt Regency Atlanta, Portman's first atrium hotel, would lead to many more iconic hotels and multi-use complexes with atria, including the Westin Bonaventure Hotel in Los Angeles (1974\u20131976), the New York Marriott Marquis (1982\u20131985), and the Renaissance Center in Detroit (first phase 1973\u20131977), whose central tower remained the tallest hotel in the Western Hemisphere until the completion of 1717 Broadway in 2013.\nHis signature work in China, the Shanghai Centre (1990), was the first of many major projects in China and elsewhere in Asia. The 5-star hotel inside, The Portman Ritz-Carlton, Shanghai (formerly Portman Shangri-La Hotel), was named after him.\nIn 2009, Portman's work was featured in a major exhibition at Atlanta's High Museum of Art.\nPortman was a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects.\nPersonal life and death.\nPortman married Joan \"Jan\" Newton. They had six children.\nPortman died on December 29, 2017, aged 93, in Atlanta.

Griffith Edwards.\nCriticism.\nPortman was praised for his \"cinematic\" interiors artfully relating interior space and elements to the individual. In the 1960s and 1970s the placement of such buildings in America's decaying downtowns was considered salvation of the city centers, but some contemporary city planners are critical of such insular environments that \"turn their back\" on the city streets. For example, the New York Marriott Marquis with its 8-floor high lobby was praised as a \"town square\", but is now criticized by some for turning its back to Times Square. Nonetheless, at the time the hotel was built, due to the still-seedy character of Times Square, Portman's style of inwardly-oriented spaces made logical sense. Also, he did, in fact, design buildings (like San Francisco's Embarcadero Center) that heavily emphasized pedestrian activity at street level.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is claimed to have lived the longest life, dying at 969 years of age. According to the Book of Genesis, Methuselah was the son of Enoch, the father of Lamech, and the grandfather of Noah. Elsewhere in the Bible, Methuselah is mentioned in genealogies in 1 Chronicles and the Gospel of Luke.\nHis life is described in further detail in other texts such as the Book of Enoch, Slavonic Enoch, and the Book of Moses. Bible commentators have offered various explanations as to why the Book of Genesis describes him as having died at such an advanced age; some believe that Methuselah's age is the result of a mistranslation, while others believe that his age is used to give the impression that part of Genesis takes place in a very distant past. Methuselah's name has become synonymous with longevity, and he has been portrayed and referenced in film, television and music.\nIn the Bible.\nMethuselah is a biblical patriarch mentioned in Genesis 5:21\u201327, as part of the genealogy linking Adam to Noah. The following is taken from the New Revised Standard Version of the Bible:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;When Enoch had lived sixty-five years, he became the father of Methuselah. Enoch walked with God after the birth of Methuselah three hundred years, and had other sons and daughters. Thus all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty-five years. Enoch walked with God; then he was no more, because God took him. When Methuselah had lived one hundred eighty-seven years, he became the father of Lamech. Methuselah lived after the birth of Lamech seven hundred eighty-two years, and had other sons and daughters. Thus all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty-nine years; and he died. 5:21\u201327\nAccording to the Hebrew Bible, Methuselah begets Lamech and then lives 782 more years. When Lamech is 182, he begets Noah, and the Genesis Flood comes when Noah is 600 years old. This would imply that Methuselah dies the year of the Flood. (In the Septuagint, most of the ages in this section are different. Lamech begets Noah at age 188, and Methuselah lives 802 years after begetting Lamech.) He was also the oldest of all the figures mentioned in the Bible. Methuselah is mentioned once in the Hebrew Bible outside of Genesis, in . Methuselah is mentioned a single time in the New Testament, when the Gospel of Luke traces Jesus' lineage back to Adam in Luke 3.\nIn other religious texts.\nJudaism.\nThe apocryphal Book of Enoch claims to be revelations of Enoch, transcribed by him and entrusted to be preserved for future generations by his son, Methuselah. In this book, Enoch recounts two visions he has had to Methuselah. The first is about the Flood, and the second chronicles the history of the world from Adam to the Last Judgment. In the latter vision, men are represented as animals \u2013 the righteous are white cattle and sheep, the sinners and enemies of Israel are black cattle and wild animals. Following his father's death in the Book of Enoch, Methuselah is designated by God as a priest, while Methuselah's grandson, Noah's brother Nir, is designated by God as his successor. In Slavonic Enoch, Methuselah asks his father for a blessing, and is given instructions on how to live righteously. After their father ascends into heaven, Methuselah and his brothers build an altar and make \"a great festivity, praising God who had given such a sign by means of Enoch, who had found favor with Him.\"\nThe Book of Jubilees presents itself as \"the history of the division of the days of the Law, of the events of the years, the year-weeks, and the jubilees of the world\" and claims to be a revelation of God to Moses, given through the Angel of the Presence in addition to the written Law received by Moses on Mount Sinai; and, while the written Law was to be imparted to all, this was to be a secret tradition entrusted only to the saints of each generation, to Enoch, Methuselah, Noah, and Shem, then to Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Levi, and finally to the priests and scribes of the latter times.\nRabbinic literature states that when Noah was 480 years old, all the righteous men were dead\u2014except Methuselah and himself. At God's command, they both announced that 120 years would be given to men for repentance; if, in that time, they had not mended their evil ways, the earth would be destroyed. But their plea was in vain; even while Noah was engaged in building the ark, the wicked\u2014who were of immense stature as they were descended from the sons of God\u2014made sport of him and his work, saying: \"If the Flood should come, it could not harm us. We are too tall; and, moreover, we could close up with our feet [which were of monstrous size] the springs from below.\" They resorted to these tactics; but God heated the water, and their feet and the flesh of their bodies was scalded.\nThe 17th-century midrashic Sefer haYashar (\"Book of Jasher\") describes Methuselah with his grandson Noah attempting to persuade the people of the earth to return to godliness. All other very long-lived people died, and Methuselah was the only one of this class left. God planned to bring the flood after all the men who walked in the ways of the Lord had died (besides Noah and his family). Methuselah lived until the ark was built but died before the flood, since God had promised he would not be killed with the unrighteous. The Sefer haYashar gives Methuselah's age at death as 960.\nIslam.\nMethuselah (Arabic: \"Mat\u016bshala\u1e25\") is also mentioned in Islam in the various collections of stories of the pre-Islamic prophets, which also say he was an ancestor of Noah. Furthermore, early Islamic writers like Ibn Ishaq and Ibn Hisham always included his name in the genealogy of Muhammad.\nMormonism.\nThe Book of Moses, a 19th-century Mormon text, says that after Enoch and the City of Zion were taken up to heaven, Methuselah stayed behind; this was so that God's promises to Enoch \u2013 that he would always have descendants on earth and that he would be an ancestor of Noah \u2013 would be fulfilled. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints further teaches that Methuselah was a prophet.\nInterpretations.\nLiteral.\nSome biblical literalists attempt to justify \"969 years\": perhaps early humans had a better diet, or a hypothetical \"water vapor canopy\" protected the earth from radiation before the Flood. Others introduce theological causes: humans were originally to have everlasting life, but sin was introduced into the world by Adam and Eve, its influence became greater with each generation, and God progressively shortened human life, particularly after the Flood. The \"Catholic Encyclopedia\" says \"Certain exegetes solve the difficulty to their own satisfaction by declaring that the year meant by the sacred writer is not the equivalent of our year.\"\nMistranslation.\nSome believe that Methuselah's extreme age is the result of an ancient mistranslation that converted \"months\" to \"years\", producing a more credible 969 lunar months, or 78\u00bd years, but the same calculation applied to Enoch would have him fathering Methuselah at the age of 5 using numbers from the Masoretic Text. Donald V. Etz suggested that the Genesis 5 numbers \"might for convenience have all been multiples of 5 or 10\".\nEllen Bennet argued that the Septuagint Genesis 5 numbers are in tenths of years, which \"will explain how it was that they read 930 years for the age of Adam instead of 93 years, and 969 years for Methuselah instead of 96 years, and 950 years for that of Noah instead of 95 years\"... \"Surely it is much more rational to conclude that Noah lived 50 years instead of 500 years before he took a wife and begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth...\" and then lists the Septuagint total ages with decimal points: 93.0 for Adam, 91.0 for Cainan, 96.9 for Methuselah, 95.0 for Noah, etc. This, however, also implies that Enoch became a father at the age of 6.5 and that the other antediluvian patriarchs did so at implausibly young ages.\nMyth.\nYigal Levin states that these long lifespans are intended simply to speed the reader from Adam to Noah. Claus Westermann states they are intended to create the impression of a distant past.\nSome versions of the Sumerian King List mention a character named Ubara-Tutu who seems almost identical to Methuselah. He was the son of En-men-dur-ana, a Sumerian mythological figure often compared to Enoch, as he entered heaven without dying. Ubara-Tutu was the king of Sumer until a flood swept over his land. Although the ages of Methuselah and Ubara-Tutu are different, they both died in a Great Flood. Babylonian writer Berossus also claims that, prior to the events of Babylon's flood myth, kings could live for tens of thousands of years, which bears some similarity to Genesis 5. In \"Forever Young: A Cultural History of Longevity\", Lucian Boia says that the Bible's portrayal of Methuselah and other long-lived figures features \"traces of the Mesopatamian legends\" found in the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\", where Gilgamesh rules Uruk for 126 years, and his ancestors are said to have ruled for several hundred years each. Boia also notes that tales of kings who lived for thousands of years can be found in both Hindu and Chinese mythology, and that the Bible is comparatively \"restrained\" in depicting early humans as being able to live for hundreds of years, rather than thousands.\nBoia notes that following the Flood, the Bible depicts its characters' lifespans as gradually diminishing; Noah's sons lived between 400 and 500 years, while Abraham died at 175, Moses died at 120, and David died at 70, an age that the Bible portrays as old for David's time. Boia compares early biblical figures and their vast lifespans to the people of the Golden Age in Hesiod's poem \"Works and Days\", whose bodies are perpetually youthful.\nSymbolic.\nMethuselah's father Enoch, who does not die but is taken by God, is the seventh patriarch, and Methuselah, the eighth, dies in the year of the Flood, which ends the ten-generational sequence from Adam to Noah, in whose time the world is destroyed. Boia believes that Methuselah serves the symbolic function of linking the Creation and the Flood, as Adam would have died during Methuselah's lifetime and Methuselah could have learned about the Garden of Eden from Adam. The kings of the \"Sumerian King List\" lived for over a thousand years, and Mesopotamians believed both that living over a thousand years made someone divine or somewhat divine, and that their contemporary kings were descended from the kings of the \"Sumerian King List\". Robert Gnuse hypothesizes that the author of Genesis made all of its characters die before they turned one thousand as a polemic against these Mesopotamian beliefs, as well as any claim that a king is divine. Gnuse also believes that the author of Genesis said that Methuselah died before he lived a thousand years to show that he was not divine.\nCultural influence.\nMethuselah's name \"has become a synonym for longevity\". Saying that someone is \"as old as Methuselah\" is a humorous way of saying that someone is very elderly. In this context, dogs which have lived long lives have been described as \"Methuselah dogs\".\nThe word \"Methuselarity\", a blend of Methuselah and singularity, was coined in 2010 by the biomedical gerontologist Aubrey de Grey to mean a future point in time where people are expected not to die from age-related causes anymore, however long they live.\nBiblical character.\nThe lyrics of Ira Gershwin's song \"It Ain't Necessarily So\" (1935) cast doubt on the idea that Methuselah lived so long.\nMethuselah appeared in Darren Aronofsky's 2014 film \"Noah,\" with Thor Kjartansson playing him as a youth and Anthony Hopkins playing the elderly character. In the film, Noah's adopted daughter Ila (played by Emma Watson) is infertile until Methuselah blesses her. Aronofsky's version of Methuselah is an eccentric but virtuous hermit who lives on a mountaintop and is friends with Watchers. In this retelling of the Genesis flood, Methuselah dies during the deluge.\nPlants and animals.\nA -year-old Great Basin bristlecone pine (\"Pinus longaeva\") tree growing high in the White Mountains of Inyo County in eastern California is called Methuselah.\nA Judean date palm grown from an ancient seed has been dubbed Methuselah.\nThe Steinhart Aquarium in the California Academy of Sciences has an Australian lungfish named Methuselah. It is the world's oldest aquarium fish with an estimated age of 93 years old (\u00b1 9 years).\nScience.\nIn the 1970s, mathematician John Conway introduced the Game of Life, a cellular automaton. In cellular automata, methuselahs refer to a small initial state of cells that continue to grow for a large number of generations.\nThe subgiant star HD 140283, believed to be the oldest extant star discovered, is often nicknamed \"The Methuselah Star\" after the ancient biblical figure. The name is also used to refer to the exoplanet PSR B1620\u221226 b, which is one of the oldest known exoplanets with an estimated age of 12.7 billion years old.\nFictional characters.\nThe Robert A. Heinlein novel \"Methuselah's Children\" (1958) uses Methuselah's proverbial age as its title reference. The novel deals with a colony of long-lived people including Lazarus Long, who reappears in later Heinlein novels.\nSimilarly, the character Flint from the \"\" episode \"Requiem for Methuselah\" is a nearly immortal man from Earth.\nIn the TV series \"Altered Carbon\", based on Richard K. Morgan's 2002 novel of the same name, a class of people who can afford to live forever by transferring their consciousness into cloned bodies are called \"Meths\" or \"Methuselahs\".\nIn the children's literature series \"Redwall\", Brian Jacques has multiple anthropomorphic characters named after several biblical figures, one of which is an old abbey mouse named Methuselah, who is described to be the oldest mouse to have ever lived in Redwall Abbey.\nA giant monster or \"Titan\" named Methuselah appears in the 2019 film \"\", residing in Monarch Outpost 67 in Munich, Germany. In the film, it is woken up by King Ghidorah alongside the other Titans. It also makes an appearance in the 2021 graphic novel \"Godzilla Dominion\".\nFamily tree.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "53620", "revid": "50691342", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53620", "title": "Puffin", "text": "Genus of Auk\nPuffins are any of three species of small alcids (auks) in the bird genus Fratercula. These are pelagic seabirds that feed primarily by diving in the water. They breed in large colonies on coastal cliffs or offshore islands, nesting in crevices among rocks or in burrows in the soil. Two species, the tufted puffin and horned puffin, are found in the North Pacific Ocean, while the Atlantic puffin is found in the North Atlantic Ocean.\nAll puffin species have predominantly black or black and white plumage, a stocky build, and large beaks that get brightly colored during the breeding season. They shed the colorful outer parts of their bills after the breeding season, leaving a smaller and duller beak. Their short wings are adapted for swimming with a flying technique underwater. In the air, they beat their wings rapidly (up to 400 times per minute) in swift flight, often flying low over the ocean's surface.\nEtymology.\nThe English name \"puffin\" \u2013 puffed in the sense of swollen \u2013 was originally applied to the fatty, salted meat of young birds of the unrelated Manx shearwater (\"Puffinus puffinus\"), formerly known as the \"Manks puffin\". Puffin is an Anglo-Norman word (Middle English \"pophyn\" or \"poffin\") for the cured carcasses of nestling Manx shearwaters.\nTaxonomy.\nThe genus \"Fratercula\" was introduced by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760 with the Atlantic puffin (\"Fratercula arctica\") as the type species. The name \"Fratercula\" is Latin for \"friar\" from the word \"fraterculus\" \"little brother\", because the puffin's black and white plumage resemble robes worn by monks.\nThe genus contain three species. The rhinoceros auklet (\"Cerorhinca monocerata\") has sometimes been included in the genus \"Fratercula\", and some authors place the tufted puffin in the genus \"Lunda\". The puffins and the rhinoceros auklet are closely related, together composing the subfamily Fraterculini.\nThe oldest alcid fossil is \"Hydrotherikornis\" from Oregon dating to the Late Eocene while fossils of \"Aethia\" and \"Uria\" go back to the Late Miocene. Molecular clocks have been used to suggest an origin in the Pacific in the Paleocene. Fossils from North Carolina were originally thought to have been of two \"Fratercula\" species, but were later reassigned to one \"Fratercula\", the tufted puffin, and a \"Cerorhinca species\". Another extinct species, Dow's puffin (\"Fratercula dowi\") was found on the Channel Islands of California until the Late Pleistocene or early Holocene.\nThe Fraterculini are thought to have originated in the Pacific, primarily due to their greater diversity there; there exists only one extant species in the Atlantic, compared to two in the Pacific. This species has shown some significant signs of animal intelligence. In January 2020, some researchers reported that, Atlantic puffins were seen using sticks as a tool to scratch themselves. The Fraterculini fossil record in the Pacific extends at least as far back as the middle Miocene, with three fossil species of \"Cerorhinca\", and material tentatively referred to that genus, in the middle Miocene to late Pliocene of southern California and northern Mexico. Although there are no records from the Miocene in the Atlantic, a re-examination of the North Carolina material indicated that the diversity of puffins in the early Pliocene was as great in the Atlantic as it is in the Pacific today. This diversity was achieved through influxes of puffins from the Pacific; the later loss of species was due to major oceanographic changes in the late Pliocene due to closure of the Panamanian Seaway and the onset of severe glacial cycles in the North Atlantic.\nDescription.\nThe puffins are stocky, short-winged, and short-tailed birds, with black upper parts and white or brownish-grey underparts. The head has a black cap, the face is mainly white, and the feet are orange-red. The bill appears large and colorful during the breeding season. The colorful outer part of the bill is shed after the breeding season, revealing a smaller and duller true bill beneath. Because of their striking appearance they are also referred to as \"clowns of the sea\" and \"sea parrots\".\nAlthough the puffins are vocal at their breeding colonies, they are silent at sea. They fly relatively high above the water, typically as compared with the of other auks.\nBehaviour.\nBreeding.\nPuffins breed in colonies on coasts and islands; several current or former island breeding sites are referred to as Puffin Island. The male Atlantic puffin builds the nest and exhibits strong nest-site fidelity. Both sexes of the horned puffin help to construct their nest. Horned puffin burrows are usually about deep, ending in a chamber, while the tunnel leading to a tufted puffin burrow may be up to long. The nesting substrate of the tufted and Atlantic puffins is soft soil, into which tunnels are dug; in contrast, the nesting sites of horned puffins are rock crevices on cliffs. The Atlantic puffin burrow is usually lined with material such as grass, leaves, and feathers but is occasionally unlined. The eggs of the Atlantic puffin are typically creamy white but the occasional egg is tinged lilac.\nWhere rabbits breed, sometimes Atlantic puffins breed in rabbit burrows.\nPuffins form long-term pair bonds or relationships. The female lays a single egg, and both parents incubate the egg and feed the chick (or \"puffling\"). The incubating parent holds the egg against its brood patch with its wings. The chicks fledge at night. After fledging, the chicks spend the first few years of their lives at sea, returning to breed about five years later. Puffins in captivity have been known to breed as early as three years of age.\nAfter breeding, all three puffin species winter at sea, usually far from coasts and often extending south of the breeding range.\nIceland is the home to most of the Atlantic puffins with about 10 million individuals. The largest single puffin colony in the world is in the Westmann Isles of Iceland. In 2009, scientists estimated the number of nests to be 1.1 million, and number of individuals there is estimated to be up to 4 million.\nFeeding.\nLike many auks, puffins eat both fish and zooplankton but feed their chicks primarily with small marine fish several times a day. The puffins are distinct in their ability to hold several (sometimes over a dozen) small fish at a time, crosswise in their bill, rather than regurgitating swallowed fish. This allows them to take longer foraging trips since they can come back with more food energy for their chick than a bird that can only carry one fish at a time. This behavior is made possible by the unique hinging mechanism of their beak, which allows the upper and lower biting edges to meet at any of a number of angles.\nIn 2019, animal experts observed puffins, in two separate geographic locations, using sticks to scratch themselves indicating that the seabirds have a basic ability to use tools.\nRelationships with humans.\nHunting.\nPuffins are hunted for eggs, feathers, and meat. Atlantic puffin populations drastically declined due to habitat destruction and exploitation during the 19th century and early 20th century. They continue to be hunted in Iceland and the Faroe Islands.\nThe Blasket Islands off the Irish coast of County Kerry saw a serious decline due to harvesting. Until the islands were abandoned in 1953, the islanders often lived just above starvation level. As a result, the puffins were hunted in large numbers for food.\nThe Atlantic puffin forms part of the national diet in Iceland, where the species does not have legal protection. Puffins are hunted by a technique called \"sky fishing\", which involves catching the puffins in a large net as they dive into the sea. Their meat is commonly featured on hotel menus. The fresh heart of a puffin is eaten raw as a traditional Icelandic delicacy. On the small Icelandic island of Grimsey as many as 200 puffins can be caught in a single morning.\nRelated places and products.\nThe name of the English island Lundy is believed to come from the old Norse word for \"puffin island\" (Lundey), although an alternative explanation has been suggested with Lund referring to a copse, or wooded area.\nThe Atlantic puffin is the provincial bird of the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador.\nThe Ubuntu 25.04 Linux distribution, released on 17 April 2025 by Canonical Ltd, was named \"Plucky Puffin\", following its tradition of naming Ubuntu versions with alliterative animal names.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Their buildings, planning, theoretical writings, and teaching have also contributed to the expansion of discourse about architecture.\nVenturi was awarded the Pritzker Prize in Architecture in 1991; the prize was awarded to him alone, despite a request to include his equal partner, Scott Brown. Subsequently, a group of women architects attempted to get her name added retroactively to the prize, but the Pritzker Prize jury declined to do so. Venturi coined the maxim \"Less is a bore\", a postmodern antidote to Mies van der Rohe's famous modernist dictum \"Less is more\". Venturi lived in Philadelphia with Denise Scott Brown. He is the father of James Venturi, founder and principal of ReThink Studio.\nEarly life and education.\nVenturi was born in Philadelphia to Robert Venturi Sr. and Vanna (n\u00e9e Luizi) Venturi, and was raised as a Quaker. Venturi attended school at the Episcopal Academy in Merion, Pennsylvania. He graduated \"summa cum laude\" from Princeton University in 1947 where he was a member-elect of Phi Beta Kappa and won the D'Amato Prize in Architecture. He received his M.F.A. from Princeton in 1950. The educational program at Princeton under Professor Jean Labatut, who offered provocative design studios within a Beaux-Arts pedagogical framework, was a key factor in Venturi's development of an approach to architectural theory and design that drew from architectural history and commercial architecture in analytical, as opposed to stylistic, terms. In 1951 he briefly worked under Eero Saarinen in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, and later for Louis Kahn in Philadelphia. He was awarded the Rome Prize Fellowship at the American Academy in Rome in 1954, where he studied and toured Europe for two years.\nFrom 1959 to 1967, Venturi held teaching positions at the University of Pennsylvania, where he served as Kahn's teaching assistant, an instructor, and later, as associate professor. It was there, in 1960, that he met fellow faculty member, architect and planner Denise Scott Brown. Venturi taught later at the Yale School of Architecture and was a visiting lecturer with Scott Brown in 2003 at the Graduate School of Design at Harvard University.\nCareer.\nA controversial critic of what he saw as the blithely functionalist and symbolically vacuous architecture of corporate modernism during the 1950s, Venturi was one of the first architects to question some of the premises of the Modern Movement. He published his \"gentle manifesto\", \"Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture\" in 1966; in its introduction, Vincent Scully called it \"probably the most important writing on the making of architecture since Le Corbusier's \"Vers Une Architecture\" of 1923.\" The work was derived from course lectures at the University of Pennsylvania, and Venturi received a grant from the Graham Foundation in 1965 to aid in its completion. The book demonstrated, through countless examples, an approach to understanding architectural composition and complexity, and the resulting richness and interest. Citing vernacular as well as high-style sources, Venturi drew new lessons from the buildings of architects familiar (Michelangelo, Alvar Aalto) and, at the time, forgotten (Frank Furness, Edwin Lutyens). He made a case for \"the difficult whole\" rather than the diagrammatic forms popular at the time, and included examples \u2014 both built and unrealized \u2014 of his work to demonstrate the possible application of such techniques. The book has been published in 18 languages to date.\nImmediately hailed as a theorist and designer with radical ideas, Venturi went to teach a series of studios at the Yale School of Architecture in the mid-1960s. The most famous of these was a studio in 1968 in which Venturi and Scott Brown, together with Steven Izenour, led a team of students to document and analyze the Las Vegas Strip, perhaps the least likely subject for a serious research project imaginable. In 1972, Venturi, Scott Brown and Izenour published the folio, \"A Significance for A&amp;P Parking Lots, or Learning from Las Vegas.\" It was revised using the student work as a foil for new theory, and reissued in 1977 as \"Learning from Las Vegas: the Forgotten Symbolism of Architectural Form\". This second manifesto was an even more stinging rebuke to orthodox modernism and elite architectural tastes. The book coined the terms \"Duck\" and \"Decorated Shed\", descriptions of the two predominant ways of embodying iconography in buildings. The work of Venturi, Scott Brown, and John Rauch\nadopted the latter strategy, producing formally simple \"decorated sheds\" with rich, complex, and often shocking ornamental flourishes. Venturi and his wife co-wrote several more books at the end of the century, but these two have so far proved to be the most influential.\nArchitecture.\nThe architecture of Robert Venturi, although perhaps not as familiar today as his books, helped redirect American architecture away from a widely practiced modernism in the 1960s to a more exploratory design approach that openly drew lessons from architectural history and responded to the everyday context of the American city. Venturi's buildings typically juxtapose architectural systems, elements and aims, to acknowledge the conflicts often inherent in a project or site. This \"inclusive\" approach contrasted with the typical modernist effort to resolve and unify all factors in a complete and rigidly structured\u2014and possibly less functional and more simplistic\u2014work of art. The diverse range of buildings of Venturi's early career offered surprising alternatives to then current architectural practice, with \"impure\" forms (such as the North Penn Visiting Nurses Headquarters), apparently casual asymmetries (as at the Vanna Venturi House), and pop-style supergraphics and geometries (for instance, the Lieb House).\nVenturi created the firm Venturi and Short with William Short in 1960. In his architectural design Venturi was influenced by early masters such as Michelangelo and Palladio, and modern masters including Le Corbusier, Alvar Aalto, Louis Kahn and Eero Saarinen. After John Rauch replaced Short as partner in 1964, the firm's name changed to Venturi and Rauch. Venturi married Denise Scott Brown on July 23, 1967, in Santa Monica, California, and in 1969, Scott Brown joined the firm as partner in charge of planning. In 1980, The firm's name became Venturi, Rauch, and Scott Brown, and after Rauch's resignation in 1989, Venturi, Scott Brown, and Associates. The firm, based in Manayunk, Philadelphia, was awarded the Architecture Firm Award by the American Institute of Architects in 1985. The practice's recent work includes many commissions from academic institutions, including campus planning and university buildings, and civic buildings in London, Toulouse, and Japan.\nVenturi's architecture has had worldwide influence, beginning in the late 1960s with the dissemination of the broken-gable roof of the Vanna Venturi House and the segmentally arched window and interrupted string courses of Guild House. The playful variations on vernacular house types seen in the Trubeck and Wislocki Houses offered a new way to embrace, but transform, familiar forms. The facade patterning of the Oberlin Art Museum and the laboratory buildings demonstrated a treatment of the vertical surfaces of buildings that is both decorative and abstract, drawing from vernacular and historic architecture while still being modern. Venturi's work arguably provided a key influence at important times in the careers of architects Robert A. M. Stern, Rem Koolhaas, Philip Johnson, Michael Graves, Graham Gund and James Stirling, among others.\nVenturi was a Fellow of the American Academy in Rome, the American Institute of Architects, The American Academy of Arts and Letters and an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects.\nDeath.\nVenturi died on September 18, 2018, in Philadelphia from complications of Alzheimer's disease. He was 93.\nIn the wake of Venturi's death, Michael Kimmelman, the current architecture critic for \"The New York Times\", tweeted...\"RIP the great, inspiring Robert Venturi who opened millions of eyes and whole new ways of thinking about the richness of our architectural environment, and whose diverse work with Denise Scott Brown contains a mix of wit and humanity that continues to transcend labels and time\".\nNotable students.\nVenturi's notable students include Amy Weinstein and Peter Corrigan.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The alcid family includes the murres, guillemots, auklets, puffins, and murrelets. The family contains 25 extant or recently extinct species that are classified into 11 genera. Auks are found throughout the Northern Hemisphere.\nApart from the extinct great auk, all auks can fly, and are excellent swimmers and divers (appearing to \"fly\" in water), but their walking appears clumsy.\nNames.\nThe English names of several species differ between Europe and North America. The two species known as 'murres' in North America are called 'guillemots' in Europe, and the species called 'little auk' in Europe is known as 'dovekie' in North America.\nThe word 'auk' is derived from Icelandic \"\u00e1lka\" and Norwegian \"alka\" or \"alke\", from Old Norse \"\u0101lka\", from Proto-Germanic *\"alk\u01ed\" (sea-bird, auk).\nThe family name Alcidae comes from the genus name \"Alca\", which was given by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 for the razorbill (\"Alca torda\"), from the Norwegian word \"alke\".\nDescription.\nAuks are superficially similar to penguins, having black-and-white colours, upright posture, and some of their habits. However, they are not closely related to penguins, but are believed to be an example of moderate convergent evolution. Auks are monomorphic (males and females are similar in appearance).\nExtant auks range in size from the least auklet, at 85 g (3 oz) and , to the thick-billed murre, at and . Due to their short wings, auks flap their wings very quickly to fly.\nAuks have largely sacrificed flight, and mobility on land, for swimming ability, although not to the extent that penguins have. Auk wings are a compromise between the best possible design for diving and the bare minimum needed for flying. This varies by subfamily, with the \"Uria\" guillemots (including the razorbill) and murrelets being the most efficient under the water, whereas the puffins and auklets are better adapted for flying and walking.\nFeeding and ecology.\nThe feeding behaviour of auks is often compared to that of penguins; both groups are wing-propelled, pursuit divers. In the region where auks live, their only seabird competition are cormorants (which are dive-powered by their strong feet). In areas where the two groups feed on the same prey, the auks tend to feed further offshore. Strong-swimming murres hunt faster, schooling fish, whereas auklets take slower-moving krill. Time depth recorders on auks have shown that they can dive as deep as in the case of \"Uria\" guillemots, for the \"Cepphus\" guillemots and for the auklets.\nBreeding and colonies.\nAuks are pelagic birds, spending the majority of their adult lives on the open sea and going ashore only for breeding, although some species, such as the common guillemot, spend a great part of the year defending their nesting spot from others.\nAuks are monogamous, and tend to form lifelong pairs. They typically lay a single egg, and they use the nesting site year after year.\nSome species, such as the \"Uria\" guillemots (murres), nest in large colonies on cliff edges; others, such as the \"Cepphus\" guillemots, breed in small groups on rocky coasts; and the puffins, auklets, and some murrelets nest in burrows. All species except the \"Brachyramphus\" murrelets are colonial.\nEvolution and distribution.\nHistorically, the auks were believed to be one of the earliest distinct charadriiform lineages due to their characteristic morphology, but genetic analyses have demonstrated that these peculiarities are the product of strong natural selection, instead; as opposed to, for example, plovers (a much older charadriiform lineage), auks radically changed from a wading shorebird to a diving seabird lifestyle. Thus today, the auks are no longer separated in their own suborder (Alcae), but are considered part of the Lari suborder, which otherwise contains gulls and similar birds. Judging from genetic data, their closest living relatives appear to be the skuas, with these two lineages separating about 30 million years ago (Mya). Alternatively, auks may have split off far earlier from the rest of the Lari and undergone strong morphological, but slow genetic evolution, which would require a very high evolutionary pressure, coupled with a long lifespan and slow reproduction.\nThe earliest unequivocal fossils of auks are from the late Eocene, some 35 Mya. The genus \"Miocepphus\" (from the Miocene, 15 Mya) is the earliest known from good specimens. Two very fragmentary fossils are often assigned to the Alcidae, although this may not be correct: \"Hydrotherikornis\" (Late Eocene) and \"Petralca\" (Late Oligocene). Most extant genera are known to exist since the Late Miocene or Early Pliocene (about 5 Mya). Miocene fossils have been found in both California and Maryland, but the greater diversity of fossils and tribes in the Pacific leads most scientists to conclude they first evolved there, and in the Miocene Pacific, the first fossils of extant genera are found. Early movement between the Pacific and the Atlantic probably happened to the south (since no northern opening to the Atlantic existed), with later movements across the Arctic Ocean. The flightless subfamily Mancallinae, which was apparently restricted to the Pacific Coast of southern North America and became extinct in the Early Pleistocene, is sometimes included in the family Alcidae under some definitions. One species, \"Miomancalla howardae\", is the largest charadriiform of all time.\nThe family contains 25 extant or recently extinct species that are classified into 11 genera. The extant auks (subfamily Alcinae) are broken up into two main groups - the usually high-billed puffins (tribe Fraterculini) and auklets (tribe Aethiini), as opposed to the more slender-billed murres and true auks (tribe Alcini), and the murrelets and guillemots (tribes Brachyramphini and Cepphini). The tribal arrangement was originally based on analyses of morphology and ecology. mtDNA cytochrome \"b\" sequences, and allozyme studies confirm these findings except that the \"Synthliboramphus\" murrelets should be split into a distinct tribe, as they appear more closely related to the Alcini; in any case, assumption of a closer relationship between the former and the true guillemots was only weakly supported by earlier studies.\nOf the genera, only a few species are placed in each. This is probably a product of the rather small geographic range of the family (the most limited of any seabird family), and the periods of glacial advance and retreat that have kept the populations on the move in a narrow band of subarctic ocean.\nToday, as in the past, the auks are restricted to cooler northern waters. Their ability to spread further south is restricted as their prey hunting method, pursuit diving, becomes less efficient in warmer waters. The speed at which small fish (which along with krill are the auk's principal prey) can swim doubles as the temperature increases from , with no corresponding increase in speed for the bird. The southernmost auks, in California and Mexico, can survive there because of cold upwellings. The current paucity of auks in the Atlantic (six species), compared to the Pacific (19\u201320 species) is considered to be because of extinctions to the Atlantic auks; the fossil record shows many more species were in the Atlantic during the Pliocene. Auks also tend to be restricted to continental-shelf waters and breed on few oceanic islands.\n\"Hydotherikornis oregonus\" (Described by Miller in 1931), the oldest purported alcid from the Eocene of California, is actually a petrel (as reviewed by Chandler in 1990) and is reassigned to the tubenoses (Procellariiformes). A 2003 paper, \"The Earliest North American Record of Auk (Aves: Alcidae) From the Late Eocene of Central Georgia\", reports a Late Eocene, wing-propelled, diving auk from the Priabonain stage of the Late Eocene. These sediments have been dated through Chandronian NALMA {North American Land Mammal Age}, at an estimate of 34.5 to 35.5 million years on the Eocene time scale for fossil-bearing sediments of the Clinchfield Formation, Gordon, Wilkinson County, Georgia. Furthermore, the sediments containing this unabraded portion of a left humerus (43.7 mm long) are tropical or subtropical as evidenced by a wealth of warm-water shark teeth, palaeophied snake vertebrae, and turtles.\nSystematics.\nBiodiversity of auks seems to have been markedly higher during the Pliocene.

He established the educational Cosanti Foundation and Arcosanti. Soleri was a lecturer in the College of Architecture at Arizona State University and a National Design Award recipient in 2006. He coined the concept of 'arcology' \u2013 a synthesis of architecture and ecology as the philosophy of democratic society. He died at home of natural causes on 9 April 2013 at the age of 93.\nSoleri authored several books, including \"The Bridge Between Matter &amp; Spirit is Matter Becoming Spirit\" and \"Arcology \u2013 City In the Image of Man\".\nEarly life and education.\nSoleri was born in Turin, Italy. He was awarded his \"laurea\" (master's degree) in architecture from the Politecnico di Torino in 1946. He visited the United States in December 1946 and spent a year and a half in fellowship with Frank Lloyd Wright at Taliesin West in Arizona, and at Taliesin in Spring Green, Wisconsin. During this time, he gained international recognition for a bridge design that was displayed at the Museum of Modern Art.\nIn 1950, Soleri, with his wife Colly (n\u00e9e Corolyn Woods), returned to Italy where he was commissioned to build a large ceramics factory, Ceramica Artistica Solimene, in Vietri on the Amalfi coast.\nSoleri adapted ceramics industry processes learned at this time to use in his award-winning designs and production of ceramic and bronze windbells and silt-cast architectural structures. For more than 40 years, proceeds from sales of the wind-bells have been an important source of funds for construction that is meant to test his theoretical work. Ceramic and bronze bells continue to be produced and sold at Arcosanti and Cosanti in Arizona.\nIn 1956, Soleri settled in Scottsdale, Arizona, with Colly and the elder of their two daughters, the younger was born in Arizona. He began building Arcosanti in 1970 with the help of architecture and design students, as a place to test his urban design hypotheses. This \"urban laboratory\", so-dubbed by Ada Louise Huxtable who at the time was the architecture critic of \"The New York Times\", became internationally renowned. In 1976 Arcosanti was featured by \"Newsweek\" magazine as \"the most important urban experiment undertaken in our time\".\nPaolo and Colly Soleri made a lifelong commitment to research and experimentation in urban planning. They established the Cosanti Foundation, a not-for-profit 501(c)(3) educational non-profit foundation. Soleri's philosophy and works were strongly influenced by the Jesuit paleontologist and philosopher Pierre Teilhard de Chardin.\nCareer.\nThe International Architecture Symposium \"Mensch und Raum\" (Man and Space) at the Vienna University of Technology in 1984 received international attention. Paolo Soleri participated with, among others: Justus Dahinden, Dennis Sharp, Bruno Zevi, Jorge Glusberg, Otto Kapfinger, Frei Otto, Pierre Vago, Ernst Gisel, and Ionel Schein.\nSoleri was a lecturer in the College of Architecture at Arizona State University and a member of the Lindisfarne Association.\nIn 1966, Paolo Soleri began working on the design for the Paolo Soleri Amphitheater in Santa Fe, New Mexico. It was built for the IAIA (Institute of American Indian Arts) on what is now the campus of the Santa Fe Indian School using large silt cast forms. The property is owned by the nineteen Native American Pueblos of New Mexico and is therefore not protected by local or state preservation laws.\nA landmark exhibition, \"City in the Image of Man \u2013 The Architectural Visions of Paolo Soleri\", organized in 1970 by the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, DC, traveled extensively thereafter in the U.S. and Canada, breaking records for attendance. \"Two Suns Arcology, A Concept for Future Cities\" opened in 1976 at the Xerox Square Center in Rochester, New York. In 1989, \"Paolo Soleri Habitats: Ecologic Minutiae\", an exhibition of arcologies, space habitats, and bridges, was presented at the New York Academy of Sciences. More recently, \"Soleri's Cities, Architecture for the Planet Earth and Beyond\" was featured at the Scottsdale Center for the Arts in Scottsdale, AZ. A Soleri bell appears in the film \"What the *Bleep* Do We Know?\" His work has been exhibited worldwide.\nIn 1976, Paolo Soleri was a key participant at UN Habitat I, the first UN forum on human settlements, held it Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, North America. Soleri appeared there together with Buckminster Fuller.\nIn 1983 Soleri published the book \"Arcosanti: an urban laboratory?\". In 1986, four years after the death of his wife from cancer, Soleri was commissioned to design the Arizona Cancer Center Chapel at the University of Arizona. The highly personal architectural expression featured a sand-cast barrel vault ceiling with botanical motifs, sculptural elements and a bell system. \nOn 10 December 2010, the Soleri Bridge and Plaza was completed. The structure had been commissioned by Scottsdale Public Art. The pedestrian bridge based on Paolo Soleri's design is located on the South Bank of the Arizona Canal and connects a developed retail area of the Scottsdale Waterfront with Old Town Scottsdale. The bridge is incorporated into a plaza including silt cast artwork, as well as a large bell assembly called The Goldwater Bell, also designed by Paolo Soleri.\nThe feature-length documentary film \"\" (2013) contains interviews with Morley Safer, Paul Goldberger, Catherine Hardwicke, Will Bruder, Jean-Michel Cousteau, Steven Holl, and Eric Lloyd Wright.\nArcosanti.\nThe Cosanti Foundation's major project is Arcosanti. Arcosanti, as originally designed by Soleri, was intended for 5,000 people; it has been in construction since 1970. Located near Cordes Junction, about north of Phoenix and visible from Interstate I-17 in central Arizona, the intention of the project is to provide a model that can demonstrate Soleri's concept of \"Arcology\", architecture coherent with ecology. Arcology was envisioned by Soleri as a hyper-dense city, designed to: maximize human interaction with ready access to shared, cost-effective infrastructural services; conserve water and reduce sewage; minimize the use of energy, raw materials and land; reduce waste and environmental pollution; increase interaction with the surrounding natural environment. In 2010, construction was underway to complete Arcosanti's Greenhouse Apron, but that initiative was put on hold not long after Soleri's death in 2013.\nArcosanti is intended as a prototype of a desert arcology. Soleri's other arcology designs envisioned sites such as the ocean (Nova Noah), \"et al.\" (see: \"Arcology: City in the Image of Man\"). Since 1970, over 7000 people have participated in Arcosanti's construction. Their international affiliation group is called the Arcosanti Alumni Network.\nSexual abuse allegation.\nIn October 2010, Daniela Soleri \u2013 Paolo Soleri's daughter \u2013 resigned from the Cosanti Foundation board, citing abuse by her father. She stated that some of Soleri's inner circle had been told decades earlier, but nothing had been done about it at the time. After the resignation, Soleri stepped down as chairman, but the board made no public statement on the reasons.\nAfter the Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art had a major retrospective exhibition on Paolo Soleri in October 2017, Daniela published an article on the website \"Medium\" on 13 November 2017 accusing her father of persistent sexual abuse, writing:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEncouraged to publish the article by the #MeToo movement, Daniela wrote that she had already come forward to many of her father's colleagues but received little response:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I finally told some of Soleri's inner circle about my experiences about 24 years ago, others learned of them six years ago when I tendered my letter of resignation from the board of Soleri's Cosanti Foundation, with an explanation of why. In response to receiving my letter, one of my father's long time colleagues and board member wrote \"I am disappointed in everyone.\" A strange reaction from a man I had known since I was seven. Two years later he presided at a memorial seminar eulogizing Soleri and his work. His message seemed to be that, yes, he's disappointed that those things occurred, but he's equally disappointed that they are being brought up, instead of silenced.\nIn the article, Daniela wrote about her lingering admiration for some of Soleri's work and ideas. However, she also warned against uncritical praise of artists with abusive tendencies and the tendency to \"accept abusive behavior as a necessary and justified cost for the contributions of intellect or creativity\". Of her father, Daniela wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAs noted in \"Dezeen\", Daniela's article suggested that she had approached \"The New York Times\" or other news publishers to discuss her father's abuse, but had been turned away. The Cosanti Foundation Board released an official statement in response to Daniela Soleri's:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We are saddened by Daniela Soleri's trauma. Her decision to speak out about her father's behavior towards her helps us confront Paolo Soleri's flaws, and compels us to reconsider his legacy. With Paolo Soleri's creative intelligence, he understood the need for discipline and limits to the urban form. However, his narcissism prevented him from understanding the need for discipline and limits on abusive behavior. We support and stand firmly with Daniela.\nWe know that Arcosanti and Cosanti are much greater than the ideas of one man. Over the past fifty years, more than 8,000 participants from all over the world have contributed to Arcosanti and Cosanti through our workshops and programs. Our work in urban planning will continue. It was considered radical fifty years ago and has proven itself relevant today. Our goal is a built environment inspired by Soleri's architecture that fosters community, integrates the natural world, and nurtures the best of human nature.\n\"Curbed\" editor-in-chief Kelsey Keith wrote \"[Daniela] Soleri's account is breathtaking not only for its thorough and very personal reckoning with the truth, but for its clear-eyed articulation of the reasons why assigning all intellectual power to a solitary genius is so harmful.\" Keith noted that architecture as a profession \"hasn't (yet) experienced its Weinstein moment\", referring to the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations and the resulting \"Weinstein effect\" of reporting sexual misconduct committed by powerful men in media and other industries. In a 2018 \"Curbed\" article, Hilary George-Parkin said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;While Hollywood, tech, sports, media, politics, the restaurant industry, and others are reeling from high-profile revelations and resignations, the design world has remained\u2014with the notable exception of Daniela Soleri's account of sexual abuse by her father, architect Paolo Soleri\u2014mostly undisturbed in the public realm.\nDeath.\nSoleri died on 9 April 2013 and was buried at Arcosanti in its private cemetery, beside his wife.\nAwards.\nSoleri received fellowships from the Graham Foundation and from the Guggenheim Foundation (1964, Architecture, Planning, &amp; Design). He was awarded three honorary doctorates and several awards from design groups worldwide:\nLegacy.\nPaolo Soleri's architectural and philosophical contributions have left a lasting impact on the fields of architecture, urban planning, and environmental design. His legacy can be observed through various aspects:\nArcosanti and urban laboratory concepts.\nSoleri's experimental urban laboratory, Arcosanti, serves as a testament to his commitment to the concept of arcology \u2014 the fusion of architecture and ecology. The ongoing development of Arcosanti since its inception in 1970 underscores Soleri's vision of creating compact, sustainable communities.\nEcological consciousness.\nSoleri's work reflects a deep ecological consciousness, emphasizing the need for harmonious coexistence between human settlements and the natural environment. His theoretical framework proposed efficient land use, resource conservation, and a reconsideration of societal norms in favor of ecological balance.\nInfluence on contemporary architects and urban planners.\nMany contemporary architects and urban planners acknowledge Soleri's influence on their work. His innovative ideas have inspired a generation of designers to explore sustainable and efficient urban solutions, contributing to the ongoing discourse on environmentally conscious architecture.\nPhilosophical contributions.\nSoleri's writings, including his seminal work \"Arcology===: The City in the Image of Man,\" continue to be referenced in discussions about the future of urban living and the relationship between architecture and society. His philosophical contributions to the understanding of human settlement patterns have sparked interdisciplinary dialogues and debates.\nRecognition and awards.\nSoleri's impact is further evident in the numerous awards and honors he received during his lifetime, including the American Institute of Architects Gold Medal (2010) for his enduring commitment to blending architecture with ecology.\nThe Paolo Soleri Archives, the collection of Soleri's drawings and writings, is located at Arcosanti. The Soleri Archives is managed by Sue Kirsch. This collection is shared through exhibits, publication and is made available to scholars and historians. \nWhile Paolo Soleri's arcological vision has faced both praise and criticism, his legacy persists as a source of inspiration for those seeking innovative and sustainable solutions to the challenges of urbanization and environmental stewardship.\nA number of films and recorded interviews have focused on Soleri's life and architectural contributions including: \"Paolo Soleri: Ideas and Work\" (1972), \"Soleri's Cities: Architecture for Planet Earth\" and \"Beyond Reviews\" (1993), \"Paolo Soleri: Beyond Form\" (2013), \"\" (2013), and \"Paolo Soleri: Citizen of the Planet\" (2016).

He is well known for incorporating principles of socially responsible design throughout his six-decade career.\nHis projects include cultural, educational, and civic institutions such as neighbourhoods and public parks, housing, mixed-use urban centers, and airports. He also had master plans for existing communities and entirely new cities in the Americas, the Middle East, and Asia.\nSafdie is most identified with designing Marina Bay Sands and Jewel Changi Airport, both in Singapore, as well as his debut project, Habitat 67 in Montreal, which was originally conceived as his thesis at McGill University.\nHe holds legal citizenship in Israel, Canada, and the United States.\nEarly life and education.\nSafdie was born in the city of Haifa, Mandatory Palestine, to a family of Syrian Jews. His father was from Aleppo, and his mother, whose family had its origins in Aleppo, was from Manchester. He was nine years old and living in Haifa when the Israeli Declaration of Independence was issued by David Ben-Gurion. After the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War, he lived on a kibbutz where he tended goats and kept bees. In 1953, the Israeli government restricted imports in response to an economic and currency crisis, severely affecting Safdie's father's textile business. Consequently, when Safdie was 15, his family emigrated from Israel to Canada and settled in Montreal, where he attended Westmount High School.\nIn September 1955, Safdie registered for the six-year architectural degree program at the McGill University Faculty of Engineering. In his fifth year, Safdie was named University Scholar. The following summer, he was awarded the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) scholarship. He traveled across North America to observe housing developments in the continent's major cities. In his final year, Safdie developed his thesis, entitled \"A Case for City Living\", and described as \"A Three-Dimensional Modular Building System\". He received his degree in 1961. Two years later, while apprenticing with architect Louis Kahn, Safdie's thesis advisor Sandy van Ginkel invited Safdie to submit his modular project for the World Exposition of 1967. In preparation for the exposition his thesis was developed into a complete master plan, eventually being constructed in Montreal. Named after the event that turned an idea into reality, the building is known as Habitat 67.\nCareer.\nIn 1964, Safdie established Safdie Architects in Montreal to undertake work on Habitat 67, an adaptation of his thesis at McGill University. Habitat 67 was selected by Canada as a central feature of Expo 67. The project launched the design and implementation of three-dimensional, prefabricated units for living. Safdie designed the complex as a neighborhood with open spaces, garden terraces, and many other amenities typically reserved for the single-family home and adapted to a high-density urban environment.\nIn 1970, Safdie established a branch office of his practice in Jerusalem. During this period, Safdie combined his interests in social activism and advanced technologies with respect for historical and regional context. He worked on the restoration of the Old City and the construction of Mamilla Mall, linking old and new cities. Other significant works in Israel include the New City of Modi\u2019in, the Yad Vashem Holocaust History Museum, Yitzhak Rabin Center for Israel Studies, Ben Gurion International Airport, National Campus for the Archeology of Israel, multiple projects for Hebrew Union College, and others. During this period, Safdie also worked with leaders in Senegal and Iran. Safdie was consulted on integrated geometry during the development of the Merkava tank by General Israel Tal.\nLater, Safdie received commissions for public buildings in Canada: the National Gallery of Canada, the Quebec Museum of Civilization, and Vancouver Library Square. Other notable cultural works include the Khalsa Heritage Memorial Complex, the national museum of the Sikh people in Punjab, India; the United States Institute of Peace Headquarters on the Mall in Washington, DC; the Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts in Kansas City, Missouri; and the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Arkansas.\nSafdie has worked on projects in emerging markets, and brought projects to completion in shorter periods, at larger scales. including: Marina Bay Sands, a mixed-use resort integrated with Singapore's iconic Skypark; Jewel Changi Airport, a new community-centric airport typology combining marketplace and garden; and Raffles City Chongqing, a mixed-use development featuring over one million square meters of housing, office, retail, transportation, and hotel programs. To connect four towers in Chongqing, China, he designed a sky bridge that has been referred to as the world's longest \"Horizontal Skyscraper\". Safdie and his team have used sky bridges and multi-level connectivity in other projects to make skyscrapers more accessible.\nPractice.\nToday, Safdie Architects is headquartered in Somerville, Massachusetts, near Harvard University, with additional offices in Jerusalem, Toronto, Shanghai, and Singapore. The business is organized as a partnership.\nSafdie formed a research program within his office to pursue the advanced investigation of design topics. The practice-oriented fellowship explores speculative ideas outside normal business practice constraints. Fellows work independently with Safdie and firm principals to formulate specific proposals and research plans. The salaried position is in-residence, with full access to project teams and outside consultants. Past fellowships include Habitat of the Future, Mobility on Demand, and Tall Buildings in the city.\nIn December 2023, Safdie Architects announced it was suspending its involvement in controversial hotel development in Jerusalem's Armenian quarter, citing \"controversy surrounding the land lease agreement\". This followed an attack by some 30 armed masked individuals on Armenian community members holding a vigil at the site. The Armenian Patriarchate in Jerusalem accused Danny Rothman, Safdie Architects' client for the project, of organizing the attack.\nAcademia.\nIn 1978, after teaching at McGill, Ben Gurion, and Yale universities, Safdie was appointed Director of the Urban Design Program at Harvard University's Graduate School of Design (GSD) and moved to Boston, Massachusetts. He served as Director until 1984. From 1984 to 1989, he was the Ian Woodner Professor of Architecture and Urban Design at Harvard. Safdie continues to work closely with the GSD, frequently teaching design studio; Notably, Rethinking the Humanist High-Rise (2019) and Rethinking Hudson Yards (2017).\nPersonal life.\nIn 1959, Safdie married Nina Nusynowicz, a Polish-Israeli Holocaust survivor. Safdie and Nusynowicz have two children, a daughter and a son. Both were born during the inception and erection of Habitat 67. Just before its opening, Safdie and his young family moved into the development. Safdie and Nusynowicz divorced in 1981. His daughter Taal is an architect in San Diego, a partner of the firm Safdie Rabines Architects; His son Oren is a playwright who has written several plays about architecture. Safdie's great-nephews are independent filmmakers, Josh and Benny.\nIn 1981, Safdie married Michal Ronnen, a Jerusalem-born photographer and daughter of artist Vera Ronnen. Safdie and Ronnen have two daughters, Carmelle and Yasmin. Carmelle is an artist, and Yasmin is a social worker.\nArchives.\nThe Moshe Safdie Archive, donated to McGill University by the architect in 1990, is one of the most extensive individual collections of architectural documentation in Canada. Comprising material from 235 projects, the Moshe Safdie Archive records the progression of Safdie's career from his first unpublished university papers to Safdie Architects' current projects. The collection includes over 140,000 drawings, over 200 architectural models, extensive project files, audiovisual and digital material, as well as over 100,000\nproject photos and travel slides, 215 personal sketchbooks, and 2,250 large sketches. Administered by the McGill University Library, a list of physical holdings are available to researchers.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

February 20]\u00a01901 \u2013 March 17, 1974) was an Estonian-born American architect based in Philadelphia. After working in various capacities for several firms in Philadelphia, he founded his own atelier in 1935. While continuing his private practice, he served as a design critic and professor of architecture at Yale School of Architecture from 1947 to 1957. From 1957 until his death, he was a professor of architecture at the School of Design at the University of Pennsylvania.\nKahn created a style that was monumental and monolithic; his heavy buildings for the most part do not hide their weight, their materials, or the way they are assembled. He was awarded the AIA Gold Medal and the RIBA Gold Medal. At the time of his death, he was considered by some as \"America's foremost living architect.\"\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nLouis Kahn, whose original name was Itze-Leib (Leiser-Itze) Schmuilowsky (Schmalowski), was born into a poor Jewish family in the Russian Empire (present-day Estonia). His exact birthplace is disputed, but it is widely regarded to be Kuressaare, Saaremaa, although some sources mention P\u00e4rnu.\nHe spent his early childhood in Kuressaare on the Baltic Sea island of Saaremaa, then part of the Governorate of Livonia of the Russian Empire. At the age of three, he saw coals in the stove and was captivated by the light of the coal. He put the coal in his apron, which caught on fire and burned his face. He carried these scars for the rest of his life.\nIn 1906, his family emigrated to the United States, as they feared that his father would be recalled into the military during the Russo-Japanese War. His birth year may have been inaccurately recorded in the process of immigration. According to his son's 2003 documentary film, the family could not afford pencils. They made their own charcoal sticks from burnt twigs so that Louis could earn a little money from drawings. Later he earned money by playing piano to accompany silent movies in theaters. He became a naturalized citizen of the United States on May 15, 1914. His father changed their name to Kahn in 1915.\nEducation.\nKahn excelled in art from a young age, repeatedly winning the annual award for the best watercolor by a Philadelphia high school student. He was an unenthusiastic and undistinguished student at Philadelphia Central High School until he took a course in architecture in his senior year, which convinced him to become an architect. He turned down an offer to go to the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts to study art under a full scholarship, instead working at a variety of jobs to pay his own tuition for a degree in architecture at the University of Pennsylvania School of Fine Arts. There, he studied under Paul Philippe Cret in a version of the Beaux-Arts tradition, one that discouraged excessive ornamentation.\nCareer.\nAfter completing his Bachelor of Architecture in 1924, Kahn worked as senior draftsman in the office of the city architect, John Molitor. He worked on the designs for the 1926 Sesquicentennial Exposition.\nIn 1928, Kahn made a European tour. He was interested particularly in the medieval walled city of Carcassonne, France, and the castles of Scotland, rather than any of the strongholds of classicism or modernism. After returning to the United States in 1929, Kahn worked in the offices of Paul Philippe Cret, his former studio critic at the University of Pennsylvania, and then with Zantzinger, Borie and Medary in Philadelphia.\nIn 1932, Kahn and Dominique Berninger founded the Architectural Research Group, whose members were interested in the populist social agenda and new aesthetics of the European avant-gardes. Among the projects Kahn worked on during this collaboration are schemes for public housing that he had presented to the Public Works Administration, which supported some similar projects during the Great Depression. They remained unbuilt.\nAmong the more important of Kahn's early collaborations was one with George Howe. Kahn worked with Howe in the late 1930s on projects for the Philadelphia Housing Authority and again in 1940, along with German-born architect Oscar Stonorov, for the design of housing developments in other parts of Pennsylvania. A formal architectural office partnership between Kahn and Oscar Stonorov began in February 1942 and ended in March 1947, which produced fifty-four documented projects and buildings.\nKahn did not arrive at his distinctive architectural style until he was in his fifties. Initially working in a fairly orthodox version of the International Style, he was strongly influenced by a stay as architect-in-residence at the American Academy in Rome during 1950, which marked a turning point in his career. After visiting the ruins of ancient buildings in Italy, Greece, and Egypt, he adopted a back-to-the-basics approach. He developed his own style, as influenced by earlier modern movements, but not limited by their sometimes-dogmatic ideologies. In the 1950s and 1960s, as a consultant architect for the Philadelphia City Planning Commission, Kahn developed several plans for the center of Philadelphia that were never executed.\nIn 1961, he received a grant from the Graham Foundation for Advanced Studies in the Fine Arts to study traffic movement in Philadelphia and to create a proposal for a viaduct system.\nHe described this proposal at a lecture given in 1962 at the International Design Conference in Aspen, Colorado:\nIn the center of town the streets should become buildings. This should be interplayed with a sense of movement which does not tax local streets for non-local traffic. There should be a system of viaducts which encase an area which can reclaim the local streets for their own use, and it should be made so this viaduct has a ground floor of shops and usable area. A model which I did for the Graham Foundation recently, and which I presented to Mr. Entenza, showed the scheme.\nKahn's teaching career began at Yale University in 1947. He eventually was named as the \"Albert F. Bemis Professor\" of Architecture and Planning at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1956. Kahn then returned to Philadelphia to teach at the University of Pennsylvania from 1957 until his death, becoming the \"Paul Philippe Cret Professor of Architecture\". He also was a visiting lecturer at Princeton University School of Architecture from 1961 to 1967.\nIn 1974, Kahn died of a heart attack soon after a work trip to India.\nAwards and honors.\nKahn was elected a Fellow in the American Institute of Architects (AIA) in 1953. He was made a member of the National Institute of Arts and Letters in 1964, the year he was awarded the Frank P. Brown Medal. In 1965, he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate Academician, and received an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts from Yale University. He was made a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1968 and awarded the AIA Gold Medal, the highest award given by the AIA, in 1971, and the Royal Gold Medal by the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), in 1972. In 1971, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.\nPersonal life.\nKahn had three children with three women. With his wife Esther he had a daughter, Sue Ann. With Anne Tyng, who began her working collaboration and personal relationship with Kahn in 1945, he also had a daughter, Alexandra. When Tyng became pregnant in 1953, to mitigate the scandal, she went to Rome for the birth of their daughter. With Harriet Pattison, he had a son, Nathaniel Kahn. Anne Tyng was an architect and teacher, while Harriet Pattison was a pioneering landscape architect. Kahn's obituary in \"The New York Times\", written by Paul Goldberger, mentions only Esther and his daughter by her as survivors.\nDocumentary.\nIn 2003, Nathaniel Kahn released a documentary about his father, \".\" The Oscar-nominated film provides views and insights into Kahn's architecture while exploring him personally through his family, friends and colleagues.\nTimeline of works.\nAll dates refer to the year project commenced\nLegacy.\nLouis Kahn's work infused the International style with a fastidious, highly personal taste. Isamu Noguchi called him \"a philosopher among architects.\" He was concerned with creating strong formal distinctions between \"served\" spaces and \"servant\" spaces. What he meant by \"servant\" spaces was not spaces for servants, but rather spaces that serve other spaces, such as stairwells, corridors, restrooms, or any other back-of-house function such as storage space or mechanical rooms. His palette of materials tended toward heavily textured brick and bare concrete, the textures often reinforced by juxtaposition to highly refined surfaces such as travertine marble. Kahn argued that brick can be more than the basic building material:\nIf you think of Brick, you say to Brick, 'What do you want, Brick?' And Brick says to you, 'I like an Arch.' And if you say to Brick, 'Look, arches are expensive, and I can use a concrete lintel over you. What do you think of that, Brick?' Brick says, 'I like an Arch.' And it's important, you see, that you honor the material that you use. ... You can only do it if you honor the brick and glorify the brick instead of shortchanging it.\nIn addition to the influence Kahn's better-known work has on contemporary architects (such as Muzharul Islam, Tadao Ando), some of his work (especially the unbuilt City Tower Project) became very influential among the high-tech architects of the late twentieth century (such as Renzo Piano, who worked in Kahn's office, Richard Rogers, and Norman Foster). His prominent apprentices include Muzharul Islam, Moshe Safdie, Robert Venturi, Jack Diamond, and Charles Dagit.\nMany years after his death, Kahn continues to provoke controversy. Before his Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms Park at the southern tip of Roosevelt Island was built, the editors of \"The New York Times\" opined:\nThere's a magic to the project. That the task is daunting makes it worthy of the man it honors, who guided the nation through the Depression, the New Deal and a world war. As for Mr. Kahn, he died in 1974, as he passed alone through New York City's Penn Station. In his briefcase were renderings of the memorial, his last completed plan.\nThe editorial describes Kahn's plan as:\n... simple and elegant. Drawing inspiration from Roosevelt's defense of the Four Freedoms\u2014of speech and religion, and from want and fear\u2014he designed an open 'room and a garden' at the bottom of the island. Trees on either side form a 'V' defining a green space, and leading to a two-walled stone room at the water's edge that frames the United Nations and the rest of the skyline.\nA group spearheaded by William J. vanden Heuvel raised over $50 million in public and private funds between 2005 and 2012 to establish the memorial. Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms Park officially opened to the public on October 24, 2012.\nIn popular culture.\nKahn was the subject of the 2003 Oscar-nominated documentary film ', presented by Nathaniel Kahn, his son. Kahn's complicated family life inspired the \"Undaunted Mettle\" episode of '.\nIn the 1993 film \"Indecent Proposal\", character David Murphy (played by Woody Harrelson), referenced Kahn during a lecture to architecture students, attributing the quote \"Even a brick wants to be something\" to Kahn.\nPulitzer Prize-winning composer Lewis Spratlan, with collaborators Jenny Kallick and John Downey (Amherst College, class of 2003), composed the chamber opera \"Architect\" as a character study of Kahn. The premiere recording was due to be released in 2012 by Navona Records.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Extended Ancient Greek texts avoiding the letter sigma are the earliest examples of lipograms.\nWriting a lipogram may be a trivial task when avoiding uncommon letters like \"Z\", \"J\", \"Q\", or \"X\", but it is much more challenging to avoid common letters like \"E\", \"T\", or \"A\" in the English language, as the author must omit many ordinary words. Grammatically meaningful and smooth-flowing lipograms can be difficult to compose. Identifying lipograms can also be problematic, as there is always the possibility that a given piece of writing in any language may be unintentionally lipogrammatic. For example, Poe's poem \"The Raven\" contains no \"Z\", but there is no evidence that this was intentional.\nA pangrammatic lipogram is a text that uses every letter of the alphabet except one. For example, \"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog\" omits the letter \"S\", which the usual pangram includes by using the word \"jumps\".\nHistory.\nLasus of Hermione, who lived during the second half of the sixth century BCE, is the most ancient author of a lipogram. This makes the lipogram, according to Quintus Curtius Rufus, \"the most ancient systematic artifice of Western literature\". Lasus did not like the sigma, and excluded it from one of his poems, entitled \"Ode to the Centaurs,\" of which nothing remains; as well as a \"Hymn to Demeter\", of which the first verse remains:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Verse transliteration-translation/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe Greek poets from late antiquity Nestor of Laranda and Tryphiodorus wrote lipogrammatic adaptations of the Homeric poems: Nestor composed an \"Iliad\", which was followed by Tryphiodorus' \"Odyssey\". Both Nestor's Iliad and Tryphiodorus' Odyssey were composed of 24 books (like the original Iliad and Odyssey) each book omitting a subsequent letter of the Greek alphabet. Therefore, the first book omitted alpha, the second beta, the third gamma, and so forth.\nTwelve centuries after Tryphiodorus wrote his lipogrammatic \"Odyssey\", in 1711, the influential London essayist and journalist Joseph Addison commented on this work (although it had been lost), arguing that \"it must have been amusing to see the most elegant word of the language rejected like \"a diamond with a flaw in it\" if it was tainted by the proscribed letter\".\nPetrus Riga, a canon of Sainte-Marie de Reims during the 11th century, translated the Bible, and due to its scriptural obscurities called it \"Aurora\". Each canto of the translation was followed by a resume in Lipogrammatic verse; the first canto has no \"A\", the second has no \"B\", the third has no \"C\", and so on. There are two hundred and fifty manuscripts of Petrus Riga's Bible still preserved.\nThere is a tradition of German and Italian lipograms excluding the letter \"R\" dating from the seventeenth century until modern times. While some authors excluded other letters, it was the exclusion of the \"R\" which ensured the practice of the lipogram continued into modern times. In German especially, the \"R\", while not the most prevalent letter, has a very important grammatical role, as masculine pronouns, etc. in the nominative case include an \"R\" (e.g. , , , , ). For the Italian authors, it seems to be a profound dislike of the letter \"R\" which prompted them to write lipograms excluding this letter (and often only this letter).\nThere is also a long tradition of \"vocalic lipograms\", in which a vowel (or vowels) is omitted. This tends to be the most difficult form of the lipogram. This practice was developed mainly in Spain by the Portuguese author Alonso de Alcala y Herrera who published an octavo entitled . From Spain, the method moved into France and England.\nOne of the most remarkable examples of a lipogram is Ernest Vincent Wright's novel \"Gadsby\" (1939), which has over 50,000 words but not a single letter \"E\". Wright's self-imposed rule prohibited such common English words as \"the\" and \"he\", plurals ending in \"-es\", past tenses ending in \"-ed\", and even abbreviations like \"Mr.\" (since it is short for \"Mister\") or \"Rob\" (for \"Robert\"). Yet the narration flows fairly smoothly, and the book was praised by critics for its literary merits.\nWright was motivated to write \"Gadsby\" by an earlier four-stanza lipogrammatic poem of another author.\nEven earlier, Spanish playwright Enrique Jardiel Poncela published five short stories between 1926 and 1927, each one omitting a vowel; the best known are \"\" (\"The new Driver\"), without the letter \"A\", and \"\" (\"A Vocationless Husband\"), without the \"E\".\nInterest in lipograms was rekindled by Georges Perec's novel (1969) (openly inspired by Wright's \"Gadsby\") and its English translation \"A Void\" by Gilbert Adair. Both works are missing the letter \"E\", which is the most common letter in French as well as in English. A Spanish translation instead omits the letter \"A\", the second most common letter in that language. Perec subsequently wrote (1972), a novel that uses no vowels except for \"E\". Perec was a member of Oulipo, a group of French authors who adopted a variety of constraints in their work. is, to date, the longest lipogram in existence.\nAnalysing lipograms.\nLipograms are sometimes dismissed by academia. \"Literary history seems deliberately to ignore writing as practice, as work, as play\".\nIn his book \"Rethinking Writing\", Roy Harris notes that without the ability to analyse language, the lipogram would be unable to exist. He argues that \"the lipogram would be inconceivable unless there were writing systems based on fixed inventories of graphic units, and unless it were possible to classify written texts on the base of the presence or absence of one of those units \"irrespective of any phonetic value it might have or any function in the script\"\". He then continues on to argue that as the Greeks were able to invent this system of writing as they had a concept of literary notation. Harris then argues that the proof of this knowledge is found in the Greek invention of \"a literate game which consists, essentially, in superimposing the structure of a notation on the structure of texts\".\nPangrammatic lipogram.\nA \"pangrammatic lipogram\" or \"lipogrammatic pangram\" uses every letter of the alphabet except one. An example omitting the letter \"E\" is:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nA longer example is \"Fate of Nassan\", an anonymous poem dating from pre-1870, where each stanza is a lipogrammatic pangram using every letter of the alphabet except \"E\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOne other pangrammatic lipogram omitting only the letter \"E\" is:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Now focus your mind vigorously on this paragraph and on all its words. What\u2019s so unusual about it? Don\u2019t just zip through it quickly. Go through it slowly. Tax your brain as much as you can.\nThe KJV Bible unintentionally contains two lipogrammatic pangrams: Ezra 7:21 lacks only \"J\", and 1 Chronicles 12:40 lacks only \"Q\".\nDropping letters.\nAnother type of lipogram, which omits every instance of a letter from words that would otherwise contain it, as opposed to finding other words that do not contain the letter, was recorded by Willard R. Espy in \"181 Missing O's\", based on C. C. Bombaugh's univocalic 'Incontrovertible Facts'.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe above is also a conventional lipogram in omitting the letters A, E, I, O, and U.\nAmerican author James Thurber wrote \"The W[o]nderful [O]\" (1957), a fairy tale in which villains ban the letter 'O' from the use by the inhabitants of the island of [Oo]r[oo].\nThe book \"Ella Minnow Pea\" by Mark Dunn (2001) is described as a \"progressively lipogrammatic epistolary fable\": the plot of the story deals with a small country that begins to outlaw the use of various letters as the tiles of each letter fall off of a statue. As each letter is outlawed within the story, it is (for the most part) no longer used in the text of the novel. It is not purely lipogrammatic, however, because the outlawed letters do appear in the text proper from time to time (the characters being penalized with banishment for their use) and when the plot requires a search for pangram sentences, all twenty-six letters are obviously in use. Also, late in the text, the author begins using letters serving as homophones for the omitted letters (i.e., \"PH\" in place of an \"F\", \"G\" in place of \"C\"), which may be considered cheating. At the beginning of each chapter, the alphabet appears along with a sentence, \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\". As the letters are removed from the story, the alphabet, and sentence changes.\nChapter 1: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\".\nChapter 2: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXY* \"The quick brown fox jumps over the la*y dog\".\nChapter 3: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP*RSTUVWXY* \"The *uick brown fox jumps over the la*y dog\".\nChapter 4: ABCDEFGHI*KLMNOP*RSTUVWXY* \"The *uick brown fox *umps over the la*y dog\".\nChapter 5: ABCDEFGHI*KLMNOP*RSTUVW*Y* \"The *uick brown fo* *umps over the la*y dog\".\nOther examples.\nIn Rebeccah Giltrow's \"Twenty-Six Degrees\", each of the twenty-six chapters, narrated by a different character, deliberately excludes one of the twenty-six letters while using the other twenty-five at least once. And each of the twenty-six letters is excluded from one and only one chapter (the first chapter excludes \"A\", the second chapter excludes \"B\", the third chapter excludes \"C\", etc., the last (twenty-sixth) chapter excludes \"Z\").\n\"Cipher and Poverty (The Book of Nothing)\", a book by Mike Schertzer (1998), is presented as the writings of \"a prisoner whose world had been impoverished to a single utterance ... who can find me here in this silence\". The poems that follow use only the vowels \"A\", \"E\", \"I\", and \"O\", and consonants \"C\", \"D\", \"F\", \"H\", \"L\", \"M\", \"N\", \"R\", \"S\", \"T\", and \"W\", taken from that utterance.\n\"Eunoia\", a book written by Canadian author Christian B\u00f6k (2001), is lipogrammatic. The title uses every vowel once. Each of the five chapters in this book is a lipogram. The first chapter in this book uses only words containing the vowel \"A\" and no other vowel. The second chapter uses only words with no vowel but \"E\", the third uses only words with no vowel but \"I\", and so on.\nIn December 2009, a collective of crime writers, Criminal Brief, published eight days of articles as a Christmas-themed lipogrammatic exercise.\nIn June 2013, finance author Alan Corey published \"The Subversive Job Search\", a non-fiction lipogram that omitted the letter \"Z\".\nIn the ninth episode of the ninth season of \"How I Met Your Mother\", \"Platonish\", Lily and Robin challenge Barney to obtain a girl's phone number without using the letter \"E\".\nA website called the Found Poetry Review asked each of its readers (as part of a larger series of challenges) to compose a poem avoiding all letters in the title of the newspaper that had already been selected. For example, if the reader was using the \"New York Times\", then they could not use the letters \"E\", \"I\", \"K\", \"M\", \"N\", \"O\", \"R\", \"S\", \"T\", \"W\", and \"Y\".\nGrant Maierhofer's \"Ebb\", a novel published in 2023, by Kernpunkt Press, was written entirely without the letter \"A\".\nNon-English examples.\nIn Turkey the tradition of \"Lebde\u011fmez at\u0131\u015fma\" or \"Dudak de\u011fmez a\u015f\u0131k at\u0131\u015fmas\u0131\" (literally: two troubadours throwing verses at each other where lips do not touch each other) that is still practiced, a form of instantaneously improvised poetry sung by opposing Ashiks taking turns for artfully criticising each other with one verse at a time, usually by each placing a pin between their upper and lower lips so that the improvised song, accompanied by a Saz (played by the ashik himself), consists only of labial lipograms i.e. without words where lips must touch each other, effectively excluding the letters B, F, M, P and V from the text of the improvised songs.\nThe seventh- or eighth-century \"Dashakumaracharita\" by Da\u1e47\u1e0din includes a prominent lipogrammatic section at the beginning of the seventh chapter. Mantragupta is called upon to relate his adventures. However, during the previous night of vigorous lovemaking, his lips have been nibbled several times by his beloved; as a result, they are now swollen, making it painful for him to close them. Thus, throughout his narrative, he is compelled to refrain from using any labial consonants (\u092a,\u092b,\u092c,\u092d,\u092e).\nIn France, J. R. Ronden premi\u00e8red \"la Pi\u00e8ce sans A\" (\"The Play without A\") in 1816. Jacques Arago wrote in 1853 a version of his \"Voyage autour du monde\" (\"Voyage around the world\"), but without the letter \"a\". Georges Perec published in 1969 \"La Disparition\", a novel without the letter \"e\", the most commonly used letter of the alphabet in French. Its published translation into English, \"A Void\", by Gilbert Adair, won the Scott Moncrieff Prize in 1995.\nIn Sweden, a form of lipogram was developed out of necessity at the Link\u00f6ping University. Because files were shared and moved between computer platforms where the internal representation of the characters \"\u00c5\", \"\u00c4\", \"\u00d6\", \"\u00e5\", \"\u00e4\", and \"\u00f6\" (all moderately common vowels) were different, the tradition to write comments in source code without using those characters emerged. \n\"Zanz\u014d ni Kuchibeni o\" (1989) by Yasutaka Tsutsui is a progressively lipogrammatic novel in Japanese. The first chapter is written without the syllable \u3042 (a), the second without \u3042 and \u3044 (i), the third without \u3042, \u3044, and \u3046 (u), and so on; usable syllables decrease as the story advances. In the last chapter, the last syllable, \u3093 (n), vanishes and the story is closed.\n\"Zero Degree\" (1991) by Charu Nivedita is a lipogrammatic novel in Tamil. The entire novel is written without the common word (\"oru\", \"one\", also used as the indefinite article), and there are no punctuation marks in the novel except dots. Later the novel was translated into English.\nRussian 18th-century poet Gavriil Derzhavin avoided the harsh \"R\" sound (and the letter that represents it) in his poem \"The Nightingale\" to render the bird's singing.\nThe seventh-century Arab theologian Wasil ibn Ata gave a sermon without the letter \"r\u0101\u02be\" (R). However, it was the 19th-century Mufti of Damascus, Mahmud Hamza \"al-Hamzawi\" (d. 1887), who produced perhaps the most remarkable work of this genre with a complete commentary of the Quran (published in two volumes) without dotted letters in either the introduction or interlinear commentary. This is all the more remarkable because dotted letters make up about half of the Arabic alphabet.\nIn Hungarian language, the game \"eszperente\" is a game where people only speak using words that contain the vowel \"e\"; as this makes otherwise straightforward communication complicated, a lot of creative thinking is required in describing common terms in roundabout ways.\nIn Spanish, Mexican author , published in 1991 https:// (the coursed vowels), a compilation of five short stories composed using a single different vowel: \"Cantata a Satan\u00e1s\" (Cantata to Satan), \"El hereje rebelde\" (the rebel heretic), \"Mim\u00ed sin bikini\" (Mimi without a bikini), \"Los locos somos otro cosmos\" (we the fools are an another cosmos), and \"Un gur\u00fa vud\u00fa\" (a voodoo guru).\nNon-literary lipograms.\nWhile a lipogram is usually limited to literary works, there are also \"chromatic lipograms\", works of music that avoid the use of certain notes. Examples avoiding either the second, sixth, and tenth notes, or the third, seventh, and eleventh notes in a chromatic scale have been cited.\nReverse lipogram.\nA reverse lipogram, also known as an antilipo or transgram is a type of constrained writing where each word must contain a particular letter in the text. For example, this is a short antilipo where each word contains the letter \"O\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Once someone\u2019s gone, nobody loses; also, victory\u2019s not for people who don\u2019t know about world history.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "53630", "revid": "7611264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53630", "title": "Werner von Siemens", "text": "German electrical engineer, inventor and industrialist (1816\u20131892)\nErnst Werner Siemens (von Siemens from 1888; ; ; 13 December 1816 \u2013 6 December 1892) was a German electrical engineer, inventor and industrialist. Siemens's name has been adopted as the SI unit of electrical conductance, the siemens. He founded the electrical and telecommunications conglomerate Siemens and invented the electric tram, trolley bus, electric locomotive and electric elevator. \nHis dynamo laid the foundation for the modern age of electricity and he was involved in the development of the electric car.\nBiography.\nEarly years.\nErnst Werner Siemens was born in Lenthe, today part of Gehrden, near Hannover, in the Kingdom of Hanover in the German Confederation, the third child (of fourteen) of Christian Ferdinand Siemens (31 July 1787 \u2013 16 January 1840) and wife Eleonore Deichmann (1792 \u2013 8 July 1839). His father was a tenant farmer of the Siemens family, an old family of Goslar, documented since 1384. Carl Heinrich von Siemens and Carl Wilhelm Siemens were his brothers.\nMiddle years.\nAfter finishing school, Siemens intended to study at the Bauakademie Berlin. However, since his family was highly indebted and thus could not afford to pay the tuition fees, he chose to join the Prussian Military Academy's School of Artillery and Engineering, between the years 1835\u20131838, instead, where he received his officers training. Siemens was thought of as a good soldier, receiving various medals, and contributing to the invention of electrically-charged sea mines, which were used to combat a Danish blockade of Kiel during the First Schleswig War.\nUpon returning home from war, he chose to work on perfecting technologies that had already been established and eventually became known worldwide for his advances in various technologies. In 1843 he sold the rights to his first invention to Elkington of Birmingham. Siemens invented a telegraph that used a needle to point to the right letter, instead of using Morse code. Based on this invention, he founded the company \"Telegraphen-Bauanstalt von Siemens &amp; Halske\" on 1 October 1847, with the company opening a workshop on 12 October.\nThe company was internationalised soon after its founding. One brother of Werner represented him in England (Sir William Siemens) and another in St. Petersburg, Russia (Carl von Siemens), each earning recognition. Following his industrial career, he was ennobled in 1888, becoming Werner von Siemens. He retired from his company in 1890 and died in 1892 in Berlin.\nThe company, reorganized as Siemens &amp; Halske, Siemens-Schuckertwerke and \u2013 since 1966 \u2013 Siemens was later led by his brother Carl, his sons Arnold, Wilhelm, and Carl Friedrich, his grandsons Hermann and Ernst and his great-grandson Peter von Siemens. Siemens AG is one of the largest electrotechnological firms in the world. The von Siemens family still owns 6% of the company shares (as of 2013) and holds a seat on the supervisory board, being the largest shareholder.\nLater years.\nApart from the pointer telegraph, Siemens made sufficient contributions to the development of electrical engineering that he became known as the founding father of the discipline in Germany. He built the world's first electric passenger train in 1879, and the first electric elevator in 1880. His company produced the tubes with which Wilhelm Conrad R\u00f6ntgen investigated x-rays. He claimed invention of the dynamo although others invented theirs around the same time. On 14 December 1877 he received German patent No. 2355 for an electromechanical \"dynamic\" or moving-coil transducer, which was adapted by A. L. Thuras and E. C. Wente for the Bell System in the late 1920s for use as a loudspeaker. Wente's adaptation was issued https:// in 1929.\nIn May 1881, Siemens &amp; Halske inaugurated the world's first electric tram service, in the Berlin suburb of Gro\u00df-Lichterfelde. Siemens is also the father of the trolleybus, which he initially tried and tested on 29 April 1882, using his \"Elektromote\".\nPersonal life.\nHe was married twice: first in 1852 to Mathilde Drumann (died 1 July 1867), the daughter of the historian Wilhelm Drumann; second in 1869 to his relative Antonie Siemens (1840\u20131900). His children from first marriage were Arnold von Siemens and Georg Wilhelm von Siemens, and his children from second marriage were Hertha von Siemens (1870 \u2013 5 January 1939), married in 1899 to Carl Dietrich Harries, and Carl Friedrich von Siemens.\nSiemens was an advocate of social democracy, and he hoped that industrial development would not be used in favour of capitalism, stating:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A number of great factories in the hands of rich capitalists, in which \"slaves of work\" drag out their miserable existence, is not, therefore, the goal of the development of the age of natural science, but a return to individual labour, or where the nature of things demands it, the carrying on of common workshops by unions of workmen, who will receive a sound basis only through the general extension of knowledge and civilization, and through the possibility of obtaining cheaper capital.\nHe also rejected the claim that science leads to materialism, stating instead:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Equally unfounded is the complaint that the study of science and the technical application of the forces of nature gives to mankind a thoroughly material direction, makes them proud of their knowledge and power, and alienates ideal endeavours. The deeper we penetrate into the harmonious action of natural forces regulated by eternal unalterable laws, and yet so thickly veiled from our complete comprehension, the more we feel on the contrary moved to humble modesty, the smaller appears to us the extent of our knowledge, the more active is our endeavour to draw more from the inexhaustible fountain of knowledge, and understanding, and the higher rises our admiration of the endless wisdom which ordains and penetrates the whole creation.\nCommemoration.\nWerner von Siemens' portrait appeared on the 20\u00a0\u211b\ufe01\u2133\ufe01 banknote issued by the Reichsbank from 1929 until 1939.

It is the only member of Grylloblattodea, which is generally considered an order. Alternatively, Grylloblattodea, along with Mantophasmatodea (rock crawlers), have been ranked as suborders of the order Notoptera. Grylloblattids are wingless insects mostly less than 3\u00a0cm long, with a head resembling that of a cockroach, with long antennae and having elongated cerci arising from the tip of their abdomen. They cannot tolerate warmth\u2014most species will die at \u2014and many species have small distribution ranges.\nOverview.\nGrylloblattids, ice crawlers or icebugs puzzled the scientists who discovered them in 1914, E.M. Walker and T.B. Kurata; the first species named was \"Grylloblatta campodeiformis\", which means \"cricket-cockroach shaped like a \"Campodea\"\" (a kind of two-pronged bristletail). Most are nocturnal and appear to feed on detritus. They have long antennae (23\u201345 segments) and long cerci (5\u20138 segments), but no wings. Their eyes are either missing or reduced and they have no ocelli (simple eyes). Their closest living relatives are the recently discovered Mantophasmatodea. Most species are less than 3\u00a0cm long, the largest being \"Namkungia magnus\".\nThe family has its own order, Grylloblattodea (sometimes considered a suborder of Notoptera). It contains 5 genera and about 34 extant species.\nMost species have restricted distributions and small populations and with increased warming their habitats are threatened, making them endangered. In North America some species like \"Grylloblatta barberi\" and \"G. oregonensis\" are known from single sites.\nHabitat and distribution.\nGrylloblattodea are nocturnal extremophiles typically found in leaf litter and under stones in extremely cold environments, usually at higher elevations. They are known to inhabit cold temperate forests to glaciers and the edges of ice sheets. Studies of several North American populations of \"Grylloblatta\" have found extremely narrow physiological temperature tolerances, with supercooling points around \u20134 \u00b0C and upper lethal limits near +27 \u00b0C, indicating that these insects are specialized for cold. They can be killed at colder temperatures due to ice formation in the body, so when the temperature drops below their optimal range they survive by living under snow pack near the soil. They have a very narrow range of temperatures that they prefer and cannot withstand high temperatures; many species are killed when the temperature rises about 5\u00a0\u00b0C above their optimal temperature. They move in response to the seasons so as to maintain an optimal temperature in their foraging habitat.\nGrylloblattidae are patchily distributed in glaciers, caves, montane environments, and occasionally lower-elevation forests in western North America, East Asia (Korea and Japan), and Central Asia (Siberia, China, and Kazakhstan). They are predicted to occur in several other mountain chains in Asia, including parts of the Himalayas.\nDiet.\nGrylloblattids are omnivorous, but feed primarily on dead arthropods and carrion. When arthropod carcasses are scarce, they subsist on plant material.\nEvolution.\nGrylloblattidae is generally thought to have emerged from within the \"Grylloblattida\", a poorly defined group of extinct winged insects that first appeared in the Late Carboniferous, over 300 million years ago. The winged \"Aristovia\" from the mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber of Myanmar, around 100 million years ago is thought to be closely related to modern Grylloblattidae due to its very similar mouthparts.\nTaxonomy.\nList of Grylloblattodea genera and species along with their type localities:\nIn total, there are 35 extant species and 6 extant genera described as of 2023.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Kevin Roche was the archetypal modernist and \"member of an elite group of third generation modernist architects \u2014 James Stirling, J\u00f8rn Utzon, and Robert Venturi \u2014 and is considered to be the most logical and systematic designer of the group. He and his partner John Dinkeloo of the firm KRJDA produced over a half-century of matchless creativity.\"\nRoche and Dinkeloo were responsible for the design/master planning of over 200 built projects in both the U.S. and abroad. These projects include 8 museums, 38 corporate headquarters, 7 research facilities, performing arts centers, theaters, and campus buildings for six universities. In 1967 he created the master plan for the Metropolitan Museum of Art and thereafter designed all of the new wings and installation of many collections, including the reopened American and Islamic wings.\nBorn in Dublin and a graduate from University College Dublin, Roche went to the United States to study with Ludwig Mies van der Rohe at the Illinois Institute of Technology. In the U.S., he became the principal designer for Eero Saarinen and opened his own architectural firm in 1966.\nAmong other awards, Roche received the Pritzker in 1982, the Gold Medal Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1990, and the AIA Gold Medal in 1993.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nRoche was born in Dublin, Ireland, during one of the most tumultuous periods in Irish history: the Irish Civil War. Eamon Roche, Kevin's father, had been jailed twice for \"revolutionary activities\". Kevin was born during his father's second imprisonment. After Eamon was released from prison, he moved his family far away from war-torn Dublin to the pastoral hamlet of Mitchelstown in southwestern Ireland. Situated at the foothills of the Galtee Mountain Range, Roche's upbringing was anything but typical. It was forged by Eamon's keen managerial oversight of the Mitchelstown Dairy Co-operative in which Kevin worked alongside his father as dairy farmers. Eamon Roche successfully annexed all the surrounding dairy cooperatives, forging them into the largest in southwest Ireland. Later, the creamery was bought out by KerryGold Creamery.\nRoche's life-changing moment came when his father asked him to design a warehouse to store the cheese that the dairy farms produced. Seeing his natural abilities unfold, Eamon enrolled the young Roche in a secondary school in Cashel, County Tipperary called Rockwell College. It is a well-known school in Ireland where \u00c9amon de Valera, one of the Republic of Ireland's founding fathers, once taught mathematics. While Roche attended Rockwell College, his interest in architecture came about after reading a book by the English architect John Ruskin, \"The Seven Lamps of Architecture\". He recalled that the book \"was not the easiest to read but was very interesting\".\nUniversity and early career.\nIn 1940, Kevin returned to Dublin to continue his interest in architecture at University College of Dublin, or UCD. His first architectural drawing was of a pig enclosure composed of concrete blocks. Though initially trained in German Beaux Arts, this gave way to modernism and post-modernism interests. After graduating from UCD in 1945, Roche made the circuit with practically every well-known modernist of architecture: Michael Scott in Dublin from 1945 to 1946, Maxwell Fry in London from summer to fall of 1946, then Mies van der Rohe and Ludwig Hilberseimer at Illinois Institute of Technology in 1948.\nAfter less than one year at IIT, Roche did not have enough money to continue for a second year. Since he could not receive his master's degree without funds, he instead thought of putting his architectural skills to practical use. In 1949, he moved to New York City and \"badgered the UN Planning Office for a job\". He was hired at the planning office for the United Nations Headquarters building in New York City. He began working on the United Nations complex at the firm of Harrison &amp; Abramovitz and stayed on for eight months. During Christmas of 1950, he left to visit his family back in Ireland, but when he returned, his job had been eliminated.\nPenniless and uncertain of his future in the United States, Roche contemplated returning home to Ireland. But an architect at the UN, sympathetic to his plight, recommended he call the firm of Saarinen, Swanson, and Associates, where the 83-year-old Eliel Saarinen still practiced in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. The firm's famous father was complemented by the family's talent: second wife Loja, son (Eero), and daughter (Pipsan). The firm had said that Eero Saarinen would be going to New York to interview prospective candidates. After spending an evening at New York's famous Stork Club with a cousin from Ireland, Roche was unexpectedly called for an interview the following morning. Roche went to the interview, and as Saarinen was talking to him, Roche had fallen asleep. Roche recalls that Saarinen was still talking when he awoke, and was nonetheless hired. He moved to Michigan and began working for the firm, which had undergone a name change to be known as Eero Saarinen and Associates (ESA).\nEero Saarinen &amp; Associates, Michigan.\n &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nRoche at ESA, 1951\n\"The office was quite disorganised...so I fell into the role of taking over the projects and organising them.\"\n\"Kevin Roche \u2013 Architecture as Environment\", Pelkonen 2011\n After his father Eliel died, Eero Saarinen moved up to assume directorship. In 1950, Roche joined the firm. His future partner, John Dinkeloo (1918-1991), joined the firm in 1951 after he had left the architectural form of Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill in Chicago. They became lifelong friends and business partners. There, Roche also met his future wife, Jane Claire Tuohy, with whom he eventually had five children. In 1954, he became the Principal Design Associate to Saarinen and assisted him on all projects from that time until Saarinen's death in September 1961.\nKevin Roche John Dinkeloo and Associates.\nLater, Roche and Dinkeloo moved the practice to Hamden, Connecticut. Saarinen's firm morphed into Roche-Dinkeloo Associates or KRJDA. Today, the firm continues on as Roche Modern, where Roche's son, Eamon, is currently managing director. Thus, Roche and Dinkeloo laid the groundwork for the preeminent architectural firm which has been coined the \"poster child architectural firm of corporate America\".\nIn 1966, Roche and Dinkeloo formed Kevin Roche John Dinkeloo and Associates and completed Saarinen's projects. They completed twelve major unfinished Saarinen builds, including some of Saarinen's best-known work: the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, the expressionistic TWA Flight Center at JFK International Airport in New York City, Dulles International Airport Main Terminal outside Washington, D.C., the strictly modern John Deere Headquarters in Moline, Illinois, and the CBS Headquarters building in New York City.\nFollowing this, Roche and Dinkeloo's first major commission was the Oakland Museum of California, a complex for the art, natural history, and cultural history of California with a design featuring interrelated terraces and roof gardens. The city was planning a monumental building to house natural history, technology, and art, and Roche provided a unique concept: a building that is a series of low-level concrete structures covering a four block area, on three levels, the terrace of each level forming the roof of the one below, i.e. a museum (in three sections) with a park on its roof. This kind of innovative solution went on to become Roche's trademark.\nThis project was followed by the equally highly acclaimed Ford Foundation Building in New York City, considered the first large-scale architectural building in the U.S. to devote a substantial portion of its space to horticultural pursuits. Its famous atrium was designed with the notion of having urban green-space accessible to all and is an early example of the application of environmental psychology in architecture. The building was recognized in 1968 by \"Architectural Record\" as \"a new kind of urban space\".&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nKevin Roche\n\"Architecture is a local language and a universal language. Ultimately, a great building touches both, so that artist, and common man, understand it without being conscious of it. \"It is interwoven\". That is great architecture.\"\n\"Kevin Roche\", 1985\nThe acclaim that greeted the Oakland Museum and Ford Foundation earned Kevin Roche John Dinkeloo and Associates a ranking at the top of their profession. Shortly afterward they began a 40-year association with the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, for which they did extensive remodeling and built many extensions to house new galleries including the one containing the Egyptian Temple of Dendur. Other high-profile commissions for the firm came from clients as varied as Wesleyan University, the United Nations, Cummins Engines, Union Carbide, The United States Post Office, and the Knights of Columbus.\nIn 1982, Kevin Roche became one of the first recipients of the Pritzker Prize, generally regarded as architecture's equivalent to the Nobel prize. Following this accolade, Roche's practice went global, receiving commissions for buildings in Paris, Madrid, Singapore, and Tokyo. He completed his first and only Irish project, The Convention Centre Dublin, in 2010.\nKevin Roche John Dinkeloo and Associates has designed numerous corporate headquarters, office buildings, banks, museums, art centers, and even part of the Bronx Zoo. Roche served as a trustee of the American Academy in Rome, president of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, a member of the National Academy of Design, and a member of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts. \nRoche died on March 1, 2019, at his home in Guilford, Connecticut, aged 96.\nPrizes and awards.\nThe work of Kevin Roche has been the subject of special exhibitions at the Museum of Modern Art, the Architectural Association of Ireland in Dublin, and the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters. A 2012 exhibition, \"Kevin Roche: Architecture as Environment,\" opened at the Yale School of Architecture in New Haven, Connecticut, and has been viewed at The Museum of the City of New York, the Building Museum in Washington, and the University of Toronto.\nIn addition to the Pritzker Prize, Roche was the recipient of numerous honors and awards including the American Institute of Architects Gold Medal Award, the American Academy of Arts and Letters Gold Medal Award for Architecture, and the \"French Academie d'Architecture\" Grand Gold Medal.\nFilm.\nA feature documentary called \"Kevin Roche: The Quiet Architect\" was released in 2017.

It was founded in 1936 by Louis Skidmore and Nathaniel Owings. In 1939, they were joined by engineer John O. Merrill. The firm opened its second office, in New York City, in 1937 and has since expanded, with offices in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., London, Melbourne, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Seattle, and Dubai.\nNotable for its role as a pioneer of modernist architecture in America and for its groundbreaking work in skyscraper design and construction, SOM has designed some of the world's most significant architectural and urban projects including several of the tallest buildings in the world: John Hancock Center (1969, second tallest in the world when built), Willis Tower (1973, tallest in the world for almost twenty-five years), One World Trade Center (2014, currently the seventh tallest in the world), and Burj Khalifa (2010, currently the world's tallest building). The firm's notable current work includes the new headquarters for the Walt Disney Company, the global headquarters for Citigroup, Moynihan Train Hall and the expanded Penn Station complex, and the restoration and renovation of the Waldorf Astoria in New York City; airport projects at O'Hare International Airport, Kansas City International Airport, and Kempegowda International Airport; urban master plans for the Charenton-Bercy district in Paris, New Covent Garden in London, Treasure Island in San Francisco, the East Riverfront in Detroit; P.S. 62, the first net-zero-energy school in New York City; and the design of the Moon Village, a concept for the first permanent lunar settlement, developed with the European Space Agency and Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\nSOM's multidisciplinary practice works across a range of scales and project types, providing services in architecture, building services/MEP engineering, digital design, graphics, interior design, structural engineering, civil engineering, sustainable design and urban design &amp; planning.\nHistory.\n20th century.\nThe firm's first influential project was Lever House, completed in 1952 to become the first International Style office building in New York City. Constructed of glass and steel at a time when Park Avenue was lined with masonry buildings, Lever House introduced a modernist aesthetic that embodied the spirit of the times and influenced an entire generation of high-rise construction.\nIn 1962, architectural historian Reyner Banham wrote that, \"It gave architectural expression to an age just as the age was being born ... Lever House was an uncontrollable success, imitated and sometimes understood all over the Americanized world, and one of the sights of New York\".\nIn the 1970s, SOM pioneered a new era of skyscraper design with its work in Chicago, including the John Hancock Center (completed 1970) and Willis Tower (formerly Sears Tower), which became the world's tallest structure upon its completion in 1973 and remained so for more than 20 years. Both towers are the result of collaboration between architect Bruce Graham and engineer Fazlur Rahman Khan. Khan invented a tubular framing system that made it possible to build higher than ever before. This system has been adapted and is still used today for some of the world's most recent tallest buildings, including the 828-meter-tall Burj Khalifa, designed by SOM and completed in 2010.\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, SOM was an early leader in computer-aided design, developing in-house digital tools that preceded the CAD systems used widely today. This work quickly proved valuable in the generation of structural analysis tools that were embraced by Fazlur Khan and his engineering team, aiding the design of projects such as the John Hancock Center.\nThe activity of an experimental research group at SOM, known as the Computer Group, exemplifies a particularly productive effort within the firm to incorporate technological research into its practice. Through the 1970s and 1980s, members of the relatively small, dedicated group pushed to integrate the computer's enhanced data-storing and analytical abilities into various phases of the design process. Through these initiatives, SOM was able to identify the potential of the computer to not only expedite necessary calculations but also introduce new ways of representing and sharing information. Just as structural engineering came to be seen early on at SOM as a means of generating rather than simply realizing architectural ideas, with concerted effort, computers gained credence at the firm, and eventually throughout the industry, as a catalyst for architectural innovation.\nIn 1980, an in-house team at SOM created Architecture Engineering Systems, a computer program that was used to study complex structural systems and energy demands.\nSOM's projects have featured works of art by significant artists. In many cases, the firm's architects and engineers played a role in commissioning, engineering, and installing the artworks\u2014such as with the Chicago Picasso, a 50-foot-tall steel sculpture in the city's civic center. Joan Mir\u00f3, Alexander Calder, Isamu Noguchi, Harry Bertoia, Richard Lippold, Jean Dubuffet and Chryssa are among the artists whose work has been a part of SOM projects. More recently, SOM's architects and engineers have collaborated with artists such as James Turrell, Janet Echelman, I\u00f1igo Manglano\u2013Ovalle, James Carpenter, and Jaume Plensa.\nIn 1953, the firm completed the Manufacturers Trust Company Building in New York City, the first international style bank building in the United States, Seven years later, in 1960, the firm completed Pepsi-Cola World Headquarters. In 1961, the firm completed One Chase Manhattan Plaza, which is now 28 Liberty Street, the first International Style building to rise in New York City's Financial District. The 28 Liberty Street project helped reverse an exodus of corporate clients from Lower Manhattan to Midtown Manhattan and the suburbs. SOM's design for 28 Liberty Street also created a plaza surrounding the tower, a novel concept that would be adapted in many future projects.\nIn Colorado Springs, Colorado, SOM planned a campus for the United States Air Force Academy. Built between 1958 and 1968, the campus broke from the traditions of West Point and Annapolis to become the first U.S. military academy designed in the modern style. The centerpiece of the campus is the Cadet Chapel, designed by architect Walter Netsch. The American Institute of Architects awarded the building with its prestigious Twenty-five Year Award, conferred onto \"a building that has set a precedent for the last 25 to 35 years and continues to set standards of excellence for its architectural design and significance\" .\nIn 1969, SOM founder Nathaniel Owings wrote, \"Civilizations leave marks on the Earth by which they are known and judged. In large measure, the nature of their immortality is gauged by how well their builders made peace with the environment.\" (source: Nathaniel Owings, \"The American Aesthetic,\" Harper &amp; Row, 1969) This ethos has shaped the firm's journey into sustainable practices. An early example is the corporate headquarters it designed for timberland company Weyerhaeuser, completed in 1971, which has been called the \"original green building\" not only for its integration into the surrounding landscape, but also for its use of efficient building systems.\n21st century.\nIn 2007, the firm completed a large-scale sustainable architecture project for the U.S. Census Bureau, the first federal office building to receive LEED certification. Like Weyerhaeuser, the design of the campus works in concert with its natural surroundings and incorporates a range of design strategies to reduce its environmental impact.\nIn 2015, SOM completed the first net-zero-energy school building in New York City and one of the first worldwide. The Kathleen Grimm School for Leadership and Sustainability at Sandy Ground, Staten Island, has been awarded for its sustainability performance by organizations, including the American Institute of Architects, the Municipal Art Society, and the Urban Land Institute. SOM has been recognized for its research and experimentation with new energy-saving and carbon-reducing technologies, including a timber tower and a modified concrete slab design.\nPeople.\nSOM is structured as a partnership. The current partners and consulting partners are: Mustafa Abadan, William Baker, Thomas Behr, Keith Boswell, Carrie Byles, Larry Chien, Leo Chow, Brant Coletta, Chris Cooper, Ryan Culligan, Paul Danna, Michael Duncan, Scott Duncan, Laura Ettelman, Xuan Fu, T.J. Gottesdiener, Gary Haney, Craig Hartman, Kent Jackson, Colin Koop, Peter Lefkovits, Kenneth Lewis, Eric Long, Vram Malek, Olin McKenzie, Carrie Moore, Emily Mottolese, Julia Murphy, Mark Sarkisian, Adam Semel, Jonathan Stein, and Douglas Voigt.\nFounders and notable architects.\nGordon Bunshaft, who thrived as a design leader at SOM for more than 40 years, received the profession's highest honor, the Pritzker Architecture Prize, in 1988.\nNotable architects who are associated with SOM include: T. J. Gottesdiener, Edward Charles Bassett, Natalie de Blois, Gordon Bunshaft, David Childs, Robert Diamant, Philip Enquist, Myron Goldsmith, Bruce Graham, Gary Haney, Craig W. Hartman, Gertrude Kerbis, Fazlur Rahman Khan. Lucien Lagrange, Walter Netsch, Larry Oltmanns, Eszter P\u00e9csi, Brigitte Peterhans, Norma Merrick Sklarek, Adrian Smith, and Marilyn Jordan Taylor\nWomen at SOM.\nArchitect Sally Harkness, a founding partner at The Architects Collaborative in 1947, was interviewed at the firm during World War II along with her husband Chip Harkness, but only her husband received a job offer. In an interview later in life, Sally Harkness explained that she was told the firm did not believe in hiring women. Norma Merrick Sklarek, an African-American, was hired by SOM in 1955 after having been previously rejected by 19 other firms. She stayed there for 5 years, eventually starting her own firm. Patricia Weston Swan spent her 30-year career with SOM including many leadership roles but never achieved partner status, perceived by a colleague in the Denver officer as evidence of the \"glass ceiling\" that was in place at that time at SOM.\nWhen Julia Murphy, AIA joined SOM in 2008 there were no women partners and only a handful of directors. To attempt to address this imbalance, in 2010 she relaunched the Women's Initiative at SOM which had previously been active between 2002 and 2004.\nThe year 2020 marked a change in which three female partners, Carrie Byles, Xuan Fu, and Laura Ettelman were named to the executive committee of the 1250-person firm.\nSOM Foundation.\nThe SOM Foundation was first established in 1979 with the mission to support and cultivate emerging design leaders by granting awards to outstanding students of architecture, design, urban design, and engineering. Many winners of SOM Foundation awards have gone on to distinguish themselves in professional and academic careers. Past winners include Marion Weiss (1982), Werner Sobek (1983), Himanshu Parikh (1985), Santiago Calatrava (1988), and Joshua Ramus (1995). The SOM Foundation continues to support emerging design leaders and interdisciplinary research with five annual awards granted to students from the United States, the United Kingdom, and China.\nAwards.\nThroughout its history, SOM has been recognized with more than 2000 awards for quality and innovation. In November 1990, SOM was placed on the cover of Interior Design Magazine for The Top Ten, Winner Of IBA. In 1996 and 1962, SOM received the Architecture Firm Award from the American Institute of Architects, which recognizes the design work of an entire firm. SOM is the only firm to have received this honor twice. In August 2009 SOM received four of 13 available R+D Awards from Architect Magazine. In addition, a collaboration between SOM and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, The Center for Architecture, Science and Ecology, was honored with a fifth award.\nDisciplines.\nUrban design and planning.\nSince the firm's founding, SOM has led large-scale urban design and planning projects. Many of these projects have had a lasting role in the development of cities and urban areas in America and the world, including London, Chicago, New York City, Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Denver, and Portland, Oregon. SOM's City Design practice has made influential contributions to urban design approaches such as transit-oriented development, overbuild strategies and sustainable urbanism.\nIn 1942, SOM was hired by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for a highly confidential project: the planning of Oak Ridge, Tennessee. By 1945, the town was home to 75,000 people. The work at Oak Ridge prepared SOM to take on the large-scale architectural and planning projects that would define the postwar era.\nFor more than 20 years, SOM was involved in the development of a master plan for the National Mall in Washington, D.C. In 1962, President John F. Kennedy appointed Nathaniel Owings as chair of the Pennsylvania Avenue redesign council, and the resulting 1966 Washington Mall Master Plan laid the framework for a dynamic, inviting, and pedestrian-friendly place. A second master plan developed in 1973, envisioned the construction of major cultural facilities, including the National Air and Space Museum, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, and the National Gallery of Art Sculpture Garden.\nIn Baltimore in the 1960s, SOM played a pivotal role in preventing the destruction of the city's historic districts and Inner Harbor to make way for the planned construction of an elevated highway. As the chair of a team to develop an alternate plan, Nathaniel Owings convinced the Federal Highway Administration to sign off on a plan to reroute the highway. It was eventually built around the harbor and the historic Federal Hill district, saving these irreplaceable neighborhoods.\nIn the 1970s, SOM collaborated with landscape architect Lawrence Halprin to plan and design the Portland Transit Mall. The goals were to revitalize the Oregon city's downtown area, to encourage the use of mass transit, and create walkable streets. The Transit Mall helped to change the perception of downtown Portland. As one of the first projects of its kind in the United States, it helped to usher in an era of streetscape design that prioritizes people. Another important commission in the 1970s was as the lead design firm for the Boston Transportation Planning Review, a metropolitan-wide re-design of Boston's entire transit and roadway infrastructure.\nBeginning in the 1980s, SOM planned the design and construction of Canary Wharf in London. Intended to accommodate a flourishing financial sector and revitalize London's former Docklands, the plan included more than 20 building sites and a host of public spaces and amenities. The plan also provided for a robust transportation network including a light rail station that connects to the London Underground. The massive scale of the project led to the opening of SOM's London office in 1986. The firm's work at Canary Wharf continued into the new millennium, with the completion of Five Canada Square in 2002.\nIn central London, the opportunity to build above rail lines near Liverpool Street Station spurred the construction of Broadgate, a new business district. SOM devised the master plan, and over three decades designed several of the site's 14 buildings. In order to build high-rise structures atop one of the city's busiest stations and its railyard, SOM's structural engineering team devised a deck over the tracks to allow for various building configurations on top. Exchange House, completed in 1990, is a building that acts as a bridge spanning the tracks. In 2008, Broadgate Tower, the district's tallest building, was completed. SOM also designed public space enhancements for the area.\nSOM designed the master plan for Chicago's Millennium Park, which opened in 2004 and has become one of the city's most visited attractions. Constructed above bus lanes, parking garages, and a rail yard, Millennium Park can be considered the world's largest roof garden. Below the great lawn, two new levels of parking were built, bus stops were added, and rail stations were renovated and expanded, including Millennium Station. The project revitalized a formerly blighted downtown site and marked the completion of Chicago planner Daniel Burnham's 100-year vision for the area.\nIn Denver, SOM was commissioned to expand and transform the city's historic Union Station into a major regional hub. 20 acres of former rail yards have been converted into a transit-oriented urban district that orchestrates light rail, pedestrian, bicycle, and bus routes, as well as commuter and intercity rail. Completed in 2014, the project has spurred more than $3.5 billion worth of private investment in the surrounding district.\nStructural engineering.\nThe earliest SOM engineer was John O. Merrill. Fazlur Khan, another engineer at SOM, is best known for his design and construction of the Willis Tower (formerly the Sears Tower), and John Hancock Center and for his designs of structural systems that remain fundamental to all high-rise skyscrapers. Indeed, Khan is responsible for developing the algorithms that made the Hancock building and many subsequent skyscrapers possible. Another notable SOM engineer is Bill Baker, who is best known as the engineer of Burj Khalifa (Dubai, 2010), the world's tallest man-made structure. To support the tower's record heights and slim footprint, he developed the \"buttressed core\" structural system, consisting of a hexagonal core reinforced by three buttresses that form a Y shape.\nInterior design.\nDavis Allen, a pioneer in corporate interior design, had a forty-year tenure at SOM. The designer of the iconic Andover chair, Allen was an institution in \"the profession he helped to establish\u2014the total design of the interior corporate environment with furniture, art, and functional and decorative objects integrated into a comprehensively planned space.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The two major groups are distinguished with dragonflies (Anisoptera) usually being bulkier with large compound eyes together and wings spread up or out at rest, while damselflies (suborder Zygoptera) are usually more slender with eyes placed apart and wings folded together along body at rest. Adult odonates can land and perch, but rarely walk.\nAll odonates have aquatic larvae called naiads or nymphs, and all of them, larvae and adults, are carnivorous and are almost entirely insectivorous, although at the larval stage they will eat anything that they can overpower, including small fish, tadpoles, and even adult newts. The adults are superb aerial hunters and their legs are specialised for catching prey in flight.\nOdonata in its narrow sense forms a subgroup of the broader Odonatoptera, which contains other dragonfly-like insects.\nThe scientific study of the Odonata is called odonatology.\nEtymology and terminology.\nJohan Christian Fabricius coined the term \"Odonata\" in 1793 from the Ancient Greek (Ionic form of ) \"tooth\". One hypothesis is that it was because their maxillae are notably toothed.\nThe word \"dragonfly\" usually denotes only Anisoptera, but is sometimes used to mean all Odonata. Odonata enthusiasts avoid ambiguity by using the term \"true dragonfly\", or simply \"anisopteran\", when they mean just the Anisoptera. An alternative term \"warriorfly\" has been proposed.\nExternal morphology.\nSize.\nThe largest living odonate is the giant Central American helicopter damselfly \"Megaloprepus coerulatus\" (Zygoptera: Pseudostigmatidae) with a wing span of . The heaviest living odonates are \"Tetracanthagyna plagiata\" (Anisoptera: Aeshnidae) with a wing span of , and \"Petalura ingentissima\" (Anisoptera: Petaluridae) with a body length of (some sources ) and wing span of . The longest extant odonate is the Neotropical helicopter damselfly \"Mecistogaster linearis\" (Zygoptera: Pseudostigmatidae) with a body length of .\nThe smallest living dragonfly is \"Nannophya pygmaea\" (Anisoptera: Libellulidae) from east Asia, with a body length of and a wing span of . The smallest damselflies (and also the smallest odonates) are species of the genus \"Agriocnemis\" (Zygoptera: Coenagrionidae) with a wing span of only .\nDescription.\nThese insects characteristically have large rounded heads covered mostly by well-developed, compound eyes, which provide good vision, legs that facilitate catching prey (other insects) in flight, two pairs of long, transparent wings that move independently, and elongated abdomens. They have three ocelli and short antennae. The mouthparts are on the underside of the head and include simple chewing mandibles in the adult.\nFlight in the Odonata is direct, with flight muscles attaching directly to the wings; rather than indirect, with flight muscles attaching to the thorax, as is found in the Neoptera. This allows active control of the amplitude, frequency, angle of attack, camber and twist of each of the four wings entirely independently.\nIn most families, there is a structure on the leading edge near the tip of the wing called the pterostigma. This is a thickened, hemolymph\u2013filled and often colorful area bounded by veins. The pterostigma, a heavier section of the wing than nearby sections, assists in gliding. Without the pterostigmata, self-exciting vibrations known as flutter would set in on the wing above a certain critical speed, making gliding impossible. The pterostigma is also found in other insect species.\nThe nymphs have stockier, shorter, bodies than the adults. In addition to lacking wings, their eyes are smaller, their antennae longer, and their heads are less mobile than in the adult. Their mouthparts are modified, with the labium being adapted into a unique prehensile organ called a labial mask for grasping prey. Damselfly nymphs breathe through external gills on the abdomen, while dragonfly nymphs respire through an organ in their rectum.\nEvolution.\nFossil history.\nMembers of the crown group Odonata first appeared during the Late Triassic, though members of their total group, Odonatoptera, first appeared in the Late Carboniferous, making them one of the earliest groups of winged insects. The fossils of odonates and their cousins, including Paleozoic \"giant dragonflies\" like \"Meganeuropsis permiana\" from the Permian of North America, reached wing spans of up to and a body length of , making it the largest insect of all time. This insect belonged to the extinct order Meganisoptera, the griffinflies, related to odonates but not part of the modern order Odonata in the restricted sense. They have one of the most complete fossil records going back 319 million years.\nThe Odonata is closely related to mayflies and several extinct orders in a group called the Palaeoptera, but this grouping might be paraphyletic. What they do share with mayflies is the nature of how the wings are articulated and held in rest.\nTarsophlebiidae is a prehistoric family of Odonatoptera that can be considered either a basal lineage of Odonata or their immediate sister taxon.\nPhylogeny.\nThe phylogenetic tree of the orders and suborders of odonates according to Bybee et al. 2021:\nTaxonomy.\nIn some treatments, the Odonata are understood in an expanded sense, essentially synonymous with the superorder Odonatoptera, but not including the prehistoric Meganisoptera. In this approach, instead of Odonatoptera, the term Odonatoidea is used. The systematics of the \"Palaeoptera\" are by no means resolved; what can be said however is that regardless of whether they are called \"Odonatoidea\" or \"Odonatoptera\", the Odonata and their extinct relatives do form a clade.\nThe Anisoptera was long treated as a suborder, with a third suborder, the Anisozygoptera (ancient dragonflies). However, the combined suborder Epiprocta (in which Anisoptera is an infraorder) was proposed when it was thought that the \"Anisozygoptera\" was paraphyletic, composed of mostly extinct offshoots of dragonfly evolution. The four living species placed in that group are (in this treatment) in the infraorder Epiophlebioptera, whereas the fossil taxa that were formerly there are now dispersed about the Odonatoptera (or Odonata \"sensu lato\"). World Odonata List considers Anisoptera as a suborder along with Zygoptera and Anisozygoptera as well-understood and widely preferred terms.\nCladogram of Epiprocta after Rehn et al. 2003:Cladogram of Odonatoptera including Odonata by Deregnaucourt et al. 2023.\nEcology and life cycle.\nOdonates are aquatic or semi-aquatic as juveniles. Thus, adults are most often seen near bodies of water and are frequently described as aquatic insects. However, many species range far from water. They are carnivorous (or more specifically insectivorous) throughout their life, mostly feeding on smaller insects.\nMale Odonata have complex genitalia, different from those found in other insects. These include grasping cerci at the tip of the abdomen for holding the female, and a secondary set of copulatory organs located between the second and third abdominal segment in which the spermatozoa are stored after being produced by the primary genitals\u2014 whose external opening is known as the genital pore, on the ninth abdominal segment. This process is called intra-male sperm translocation (ST). Because the male copulatory organ has evolved independently from that in other insects, it has been suggested the stem-group dragonflies had external sperm transfer. To mate, the male claspers grasps the female by the thorax (Zygoptera) or head (Anisoptera) while the female bends her abdomen so that her own genitalia can be grasped by the copulatory organ holding the sperm. This is known as the \"wheel\" position. In Anisoptera, males often mate while flying, lifting the females in the air, which typically last from a couple of seconds to a minute or two, whereas the males in Zygoptera mate while perched. They might even move to different spots during the mating process, which can make it last longer, anywhere between five and ten minutes. Male Odonata are very competitive when it comes to mating that in some species, the males use the cerci located at the tip of the abdomen to remove the sperm of a rival male's from the female and put in his own.\nEggs are laid in water or on vegetation near water or wet places, and hatch to produce pronymphs which live off the nutrients that were in the egg. They then develop into instars with approximately 9\u201314 molts that are (in most species) voracious predators on other aquatic organisms, including small fishes. The nymphs grow and molt, usually in dusk or dawn, into the flying teneral immature adults, whose color is not yet developed. These transform into reproductive adults.\nOdonates can act as bioindicators of water quality in rivers because they rely on high quality water for proper development in early life. Since their diet consists entirely of insects, odonate density is directly proportional to the population of prey, and their abundance indicates the abundance of prey in the examined ecosystem. Species richness of vascular plants has also been positively correlated with the species richness of dragonflies in a given habitat. This means that in a location such as a lake, if one finds a wide variety of odonates, then a similarly wide variety of plants should also be present. This correlation is not common to all bioindicators, as some may act as indicators for a different environmental factor, such as the pool frog acting as a bioindicator of water quality due to its high quantity of time spent in and around water.\nIn addition, odonates are very sensitive to changes to average temperature. Many species have moved to higher elevations and latitudes as global temperature rises and habitats dry out. Changes to the life cycle have been recorded with increased development of the instar stages and smaller adult body size as the average temperature increases. As the territory of many species starts to overlap, the rate hybridization of species that normally do not come in contact is increasing.\u00a0If global climate change continues many members of Odonata will start to disappear. Because odonates are such an old order and have such a complete fossil record they are an ideal species to study insect evolution and adaptation.\u00a0For example, they are one of the first insects to develop flight and it is likely that this trait only evolved once in insects, looking at how flight works in odonates, the rest of flight can be mapped out.\nCannibalism.\nCannibalism has been recorded in many species of odonates, at both the larval and adult stages. Cannibalism is caused by either errors in species recognition, intrasexual competition for mating, or prevention of mating harassment.\nSee also.\nVarious lists of Odonata species of different regions:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They are found throughout Central and South America, Trinidad in the Caribbean, and in the southwestern area of North America. Peccaries usually measure between in length, and a full-grown adult usually weighs about . They represent the closest relatives of the family Suidae, which contains pigs and relatives. Together Tayassuidae and Suidae are grouped in the suborder Suina within the order Artiodactyla (even-toed ungulates).\nPeccaries are social creatures that live in herds. They are omnivores and eat roots, grubs, and a variety of other foods. They can identify each other by their strong odors. A group of peccaries that travel and live together is called a squadron. A squadron of peccaries averages between six and nine members. They give birth year-round to an average litter of two.\nPeccaries first appeared in North America during the Miocene and migrated into South America during the Pliocene\u2013Pleistocene as part of the Great American Interchange.\nWhen the two occur in the wild in similar ranges, they are often confused with feral domestic pigs, commonly known as \"razorback\" hogs in many parts of the United States.\nThe Maya kept herds of peccaries, using them in rituals and for food. They are kept as pets in many countries in addition to being raised on farms as a source of food.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"peccary\" is derived from the Carib word or .\nIn Portuguese, a peccary is called , , , , among other names like or . In Spanish, it is called , (a word also used to describe wild boar), , or . The word \"javelina\" derives from the Spanish word for \"wild boar\". In French Guiana and Suriname, the animal is called \"pakira\".\nThe scientific name Tayassuidae derives from the same source as the Portuguese .\nCharacteristics.\nA peccary is a medium-sized animal, with a strong resemblance to a pig. Like a pig, it has a snout ending in a cartilaginous disc and eyes that are small relative to its head. Also like a pig, it uses only the middle two digits for walking, although, unlike pigs, the other toes may be altogether absent. Its stomach is not ruminating. Though it has three chambers, it is more complex than those of pigs. Peccaries are foregut fermenters (pigs are hindgut fermenters). This foregut fermentation, similar to but separately evolved from a ruminant, is an example of convergent evolution.\nPeccaries are omnivores and will eat insects, grubs, and occasionally small animals, although their preferred foods consist of roots, grasses, seeds, fruit, and cacti\u2014particularly prickly pear. Pigs and peccaries can be differentiated by a number of characteristics, including tails and ear shape. The ears of pigs are large and upright and often pointed while the ears of peccaries are small and rounded. Pigs also have tasseled tails, but peccaries' tails are small and discreet.\nThe most noticeable difference between pigs and peccaries is the shape of the canine teeth, or tusks. In European pigs, the tusks are long and curve around on themselves, whereas in peccaries, the tusks are short and straight and interlock with each other, prohibiting side-to-side movement of the jaw. The jaws and tusks of peccaries are adapted for crushing hard seeds and slicing into plant roots, and they also use their tusks to defend against predators. The dental formula for peccaries is: 2.1.3.33.1.3.3\nBy rubbing the tusks together, they can make a chattering noise that warns potential predators to stay away.\nPeccaries are social animals, often forming herds. Over 100 individuals have been recorded for a single herd of white-lipped peccaries, but collared and Chacoan peccaries usually form smaller groups. Such social behavior seems to have been the situation in extinct peccaries as well. The giant peccary (\"Pecari maximus\") of Brazil appears to be less social, primarily living in pairs. Peccaries rely on their social structure to defend territory, protect against predators, regulate temperature, and interact with other members of the species.\nPeccaries have scent glands below each eye and another on their backs, though these are believed to be rudimentary in \"P. maximus\". They use the scent to mark herd territories, which range from . They also mark other herd members with these scent glands by rubbing one against another. The pungent odor allows peccaries to recognize other members of their herd, despite their myopic vision. Their very poor eyesight may make them appear to be charging when they are trying to escape. The odor is strong enough to be detected by humans, which earns the peccary the nickname of \"skunk pig\".\nSpecies.\nExtant species.\nThree (possibly four) living species of peccaries are found from the Southwestern United States through Central America and into South America and Trinidad, each in their own genus.\nThe collared peccary (\"Dicotyles tajacu\") or \"musk hog\", referring to the animal's scent glands, occurs from the Southwestern United States into South America and the island of Trinidad. The coat consists of wiry peppered black, gray, and brown hair with a lighter colored \"collar\" circling the shoulders. They bear young year-round, but most often between November and March, with the average litter size consisting of two to three offspring. They are found in many habitats, from arid scrublands to humid tropical rain forests. The collared peccary is well-adapted to habitat disturbed by humans, merely requiring sufficient cover. They can be found in cities and agricultural land throughout their range.\nNotable populations exist in the suburbs of Phoenix and Tucson, Arizona, where they feed on ornamental plants and other cultivated vegetation. There are also urban populations as far north as Sedona, Arizona, where they have been known to fill a niche similar to raccoons and other urban scavengers. In Arizona they are often called by their Spanish name \"javelinas\". Collared peccaries are generally found in bands of 8 to 15 animals of various ages. They defend themselves if they feel threatened, but otherwise tend to ignore humans.\nA second species, the white-lipped peccary (\"Tayassu pecari\"), is mainly found in rainforests of Central and South America, but also known from a wide range of other habitats such as dry forests, grasslands, mangrove, cerrado, and dry xerophytic areas. The two main threats to their survival are deforestation and hunting.\nThe third species, the Chacoan peccary (\"Catagonus wagneri\"). It is found in the dry shrub habitat or Chaco of Paraguay, Bolivia, and Argentina. The Chacoan peccary has the distinction of having been first described based on fossils and was originally thought to be an extinct species. In 1975, the animal was discovered in the Chaco region of Paraguay. The species was well known to the native people.\nA fourth as yet unconfirmed species, the giant peccary (\"Dicotyles maximus\"), was described from the Brazilian Amazon and north Bolivia by Dutch biologist Marc van Roosmalen. Though relatively recently discovered, it has been known to the local Tupi people as \"caitetu munde\", which means \"great peccary which lives in pairs\". Thought to be the largest extant peccary, it can grow to in length. Its pelage is completely dark gray, with no collars whatsoever. Unlike other peccaries, it lives in pairs, or with one or two offspring. However, the scientific evidence for considering it as a species separate from the collared peccary has later been questioned, leading the IUCN to treat it as a synonym.\nDuring the Late Pleistocene, two extinct peccaries, \"Mylohyus\" and \"Platygonus\", were widespread across North America (and in the case of \"Platygonus\", South America), but became extinct at the end of the Pleistocene around 12,000 years ago following the arrival of humans.\nExtinct genera.\nIn addition, Tayassuidae have a well-attested fossil record, and numerous extinct genera are known:\nEvolution.\nAlthough some taxa from the Old World like the European Miocene \"Taucanamo\" have been suggested to be members of Tayussidae, their assignation to the group is equivocal, with a 2017 phylogenetic analysis recovering \"Taucanamo\" outside the clade containing suids and peccaries. The oldest unambiguous fossils of peccaries are from the Early Miocene of North America, with the North American Eocene-Oligocene genus \"Perchoerus,\" also often considered an early peccary, recovered outside the clade containing peccaries and suids.\nAlthough common in South America today, peccaries did not reach there until about three million years ago during the Great American Interchange, when the Isthmus of Panama formed, connecting North America and South America. At that time, many North American animals\u2014including peccaries, llamas and tapirs\u2014entered South America, while some South American species, such as the ground sloths and opossums, migrated north. Several species of peccary across the genera \"Platygonus\" and \"Mylohyus\" remained in North America until their extinction following the colonization of the continent by humans via Beringia at the end of the Pleistocene. Today, 2 of the 3 species are relegated to the Neotropical realm, but the collared peccary ranges into northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.\nDomestication.\nPeccaries bear a familial resemblance to true pigs due to their common ancestry, and are in the same suborder as swine (Suina). They have been present in South America since prehistoric times. The earliest scientific description of peccaries in the New World is in Brazil in 1547 and referred to them as \"wild pigs\".\nIt has been documented that peccaries were tamed, penned, and raised for food and ritual purposes in the Yucat\u00e1n, Panama, the southern Caribbean, and Colombia at the time of the Conquest. Archaeological remains of peccaries have been found in Mesoamerica from the Preclassic (or Formative) period up until immediately before Spanish contact. Specifically, peccary remains have been found at Early Formative Olmec civilization sites.\nThe peccary is not readily suitable for modern captive breeding, lacking suitable characteristics for intensive or semi-intensive systems. Peccaries require a higher age before they are able to give birth (parturition) and have a tendency towards infanticide.\nRelation with feral pigs.\nRecently established Brazilian boar populations are not to be confused with long-established populations of feral domestic pigs, which have existed mainly in the Pantanal for more than 100 years, along with native peccaries. The demographic dynamics of the interaction between feral pig populations and those of the two native species of peccaries (collared peccary and white-lipped peccary) is obscure and is still being studied. The existence of feral pigs could somewhat ease jaguar predation on peccary populations, as jaguars show a preference for hunting pigs when they are available.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Kingdoms are divided into smaller groups called phyla (singular phylum).\nTraditionally, textbooks from the United States and some of Canada have used a system of six kingdoms (Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Protista, Archaea/Archaebacteria, and Bacteria or Eubacteria), while textbooks in other parts of the world, such as Bangladesh, Brazil, Greece, India, Pakistan, Spain, and the United Kingdom have used five kingdoms (Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Protista and Monera). \nSome recent classifications based on modern cladistics have explicitly abandoned the term \"kingdom\", noting that some traditional kingdoms are not monophyletic, meaning that they do not consist of all the descendants of a common ancestor. The terms \"flora\" (for plants), \"fauna\" (for animals), and, in the 21st century, \"funga\" (for fungi) are also used for life present in a particular region or time.\nDefinition and associated terms.\nWhen Carl Linnaeus introduced the rank-based system of nomenclature into biology in 1735, the highest rank was given the name \"kingdom\" and was followed by four other main or principal ranks: class, order, genus and species. Later two further main ranks were introduced, making the sequence kingdom, phylum or division, class, order, family, genus and species. In 1990, the rank of domain was introduced above kingdom.\nPrefixes can be added so \"subkingdom\" (\"subregnum\") and \"infrakingdom\" (also known as \"infraregnum\") are the two ranks immediately below kingdom. Superkingdom may be considered as an equivalent of domain or empire or as an independent rank between kingdom and domain or subdomain. In some classification systems the additional rank \"branch\" (Latin: \"ramus\") can be inserted between subkingdom and infrakingdom, e.g., Protostomia and Deuterostomia in the classification of Cavalier-Smith.\nHistory.\nTwo kingdoms of life.\nThe classification of living things into animals and plants is an ancient one. Aristotle (384\u2013322 BC) classified animal species in his \"History of Animals\", while his pupil Theophrastus (c.\u2009371\u2013c.\u2009287 BC) wrote a parallel work, the \"Historia Plantarum\", on plants.\nCarl Linnaeus (1707\u20131778) laid the foundations for modern biological nomenclature, now regulated by the Nomenclature Codes, in 1735. He distinguished two kingdoms of living things: \"Regnum Animale\" ('animal kingdom') and \"Regnum Vegetabile\" ('vegetable kingdom', for plants). Linnaeus also included minerals in his classification system, placing them in a third kingdom, \"Regnum Lapideum\".\nThree kingdoms of life.\nIn 1674, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, often called the \"father of microscopy\", sent the Royal Society of London a copy of his first observations of microscopic single-celled organisms. Until then, the existence of such microscopic organisms was entirely unknown. Despite this, Linnaeus did not include any microscopic creatures in his original taxonomy.\nAt first, microscopic organisms were classified within the animal and plant kingdoms. However, by the mid\u201319th century, it had become clear to many that \"the existing dichotomy of the plant and animal kingdoms [had become] rapidly blurred at its boundaries and outmoded\".\nIn 1860 John Hogg proposed the \"Protoctista\", a third kingdom of life composed of \"all the lower creatures, or the primary organic beings\"; he retained Regnum Lapideum as a fourth kingdom of minerals. In 1866, Ernst Haeckel also proposed a third kingdom of life, the \"Protista\", for \"neutral organisms\" or \"the kingdom of primitive forms\", which were neither animal nor plant; he did not include the Regnum Lapideum in his scheme. Haeckel revised the content of this kingdom a number of times before settling on a division based on whether organisms were unicellular (Protista) or multicellular (animals and plants).\nFour kingdoms.\nThe development of microscopy revealed important distinctions between those organisms whose cells do not have a distinct nucleus (prokaryotes) and organisms whose cells do have a distinct nucleus (eukaryotes). In 1937 \u00c9douard Chatton introduced the terms \"prokaryote\" and \"eukaryote\" to differentiate these organisms.\nIn 1938, Herbert F. Copeland proposed a four-kingdom classification by creating the novel Kingdom Monera of prokaryotic organisms; as a revised phylum Monera of the Protista, it included organisms now classified as Bacteria and Archaea. Ernst Haeckel, in his 1904 book \"The Wonders of Life\", had placed the blue-green algae (or Phycochromacea) in Monera; this would gradually gain acceptance, and the blue-green algae would become classified as bacteria in the phylum Cyanobacteria.\nIn the 1960s, Roger Stanier and C. B. van Niel promoted and popularized \u00c9douard Chatton's earlier work, particularly in their paper of 1962, \"The Concept of a Bacterium\"; this created, for the first time, a rank above kingdom\u2014a \"superkingdom\" or \"empire\"\u2014with the two-empire system of prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The two-empire system would later be expanded to the three-domain system of Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukaryota.\nFive kingdoms.\nThe differences between fungi and other organisms regarded as plants had long been recognised by some; Haeckel had moved the fungi out of Plantae into Protista after his original classification, but was largely ignored in this separation by scientists of his time. Robert Whittaker recognized an additional kingdom for the Fungi. The resulting five-kingdom system, proposed in 1969 by Whittaker, has become a popular standard and with some refinement is still used in many works and forms the basis for new multi-kingdom systems. It is based mainly upon differences in nutrition; his Plantae were mostly multicellular autotrophs, his Animalia multicellular heterotrophs, and his Fungi multicellular saprotrophs.\nThe remaining two kingdoms, Protista and Monera, included unicellular and simple cellular colonies. The five kingdom system may be combined with the two empire system. In the Whittaker system, Plantae included some algae. In other systems, such as Lynn Margulis's system of five kingdoms, the plants included just the land plants (Embryophyta), and Protoctista has a broader definition.\nFollowing publication of Whittaker's system, the five-kingdom model began to be commonly used in high school biology textbooks. But despite the development from two kingdoms to five among most scientists, some authors as late as 1975 continued to employ a traditional two-kingdom system of animals and plants, dividing the plant kingdom into subkingdoms Prokaryota (bacteria and cyanobacteria), Mycota (fungi and supposed relatives), and Chlorota (algae and land plants).\nSix kingdoms.\nIn 1977, Carl Woese and colleagues proposed the fundamental subdivision of the prokaryotes into the Eubacteria (later called the Bacteria) and Archaebacteria (later called the Archaea), based on ribosomal RNA structure; this would later lead to the proposal of three \"domains\" of life, of Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukaryota. Combined with the five-kingdom model, this created a six-kingdom model, where the kingdom Monera is replaced by the kingdoms Bacteria and Archaea. This six-kingdom model is commonly used in recent US high school biology textbooks, but has received criticism for compromising the current scientific consensus. But the division of prokaryotes into two kingdoms remains in use with the recent seven kingdoms scheme of Thomas Cavalier-Smith, although it primarily differs in that Protista is replaced by Protozoa and Chromista.\nEight kingdoms.\nThomas Cavalier-Smith supported the consensus at that time, that the difference between Eubacteria and Archaebacteria was so great (particularly considering the genetic distance of ribosomal genes) that the prokaryotes needed to be separated into two different kingdoms. He then divided Eubacteria into two subkingdoms: Negibacteria (Gram-negative bacteria) and Posibacteria (Gram-positive bacteria). Technological advances in electron microscopy allowed the separation of the Chromista from the Plantae kingdom. Indeed, the chloroplast of the chromists is located in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum instead of in the cytosol. Moreover, only chromists contain chlorophyll c. Since then, many non-photosynthetic phyla of protists, thought to have secondarily lost their chloroplasts, were integrated into the kingdom Chromista.\nFinally, some protists lacking mitochondria were discovered. As mitochondria were known to be the result of the endosymbiosis of a proteobacterium, it was thought that these amitochondriate eukaryotes were primitively so, marking an important step in eukaryogenesis. As a result, these amitochondriate protists were separated from the protist kingdom, giving rise to the, at the same time, superkingdom and kingdom Archezoa. This superkingdom was opposed to the Metakaryota superkingdom, grouping together the five other eukaryotic kingdoms (Animalia, Protozoa, Fungi, Plantae and Chromista). This was known as the Archezoa hypothesis, which has since been abandoned; later schemes did not include the Archezoa\u2013Metakaryota divide.\n\u2021 No longer recognized by taxonomists.\nSix kingdoms (1998).\nIn 1998, Cavalier-Smith published a six-kingdom model, which has been revised in subsequent papers. The version published in 2009 is shown below. Cavalier-Smith no longer accepted the importance of the fundamental Eubacteria\u2013Archaebacteria divide put forward by Woese and others and supported by recent research. The kingdom Bacteria (sole kingdom of empire Prokaryota) was subdivided into two sub-kingdoms according to their membrane topologies: Unibacteria and Negibacteria. Unibacteria was divided into phyla Archaebacteria and Posibacteria; the bimembranous-unimembranous transition was thought to be far more fundamental than the long branch of genetic distance of Archaebacteria, viewed as having no particular biological significance.\nCavalier-Smith does not accept the requirement for taxa to be monophyletic (\"holophyletic\" in his terminology) to be valid. He defines Prokaryota, Bacteria, Negibacteria, Unibacteria, and Posibacteria as valid paraphyla (therefore \"monophyletic\" in the sense he uses this term) taxa, marking important innovations of biological significance (in regard of the concept of biological niche).\nIn the same way, his paraphyletic kingdom Protozoa includes the ancestors of Animalia, Fungi, Plantae, and Chromista. The advances of phylogenetic studies allowed Cavalier-Smith to realize that all the phyla thought to be archezoans (i.e. primitively amitochondriate eukaryotes) had in fact secondarily lost their mitochondria, typically by transforming them into new organelles: Hydrogenosomes. This means that all living eukaryotes are in fact metakaryotes, according to the significance of the term given by Cavalier-Smith. Some of the members of the defunct kingdom Archezoa, like the phylum Microsporidia, were reclassified into kingdom Fungi. Others were reclassified in kingdom Protozoa, like Metamonada which is now part of infrakingdom Excavata.\nBecause Cavalier-Smith allows paraphyly, the diagram below is an \"organization chart\", not an \"ancestor chart\", and does not represent an evolutionary tree.\nSeven kingdoms.\nCavalier-Smith and his collaborators revised their classification in 2015. In this scheme they introduced two superkingdoms of Prokaryota and Eukaryota and seven kingdoms. Prokaryota have two kingdoms: Bacteria and Archaea. (This was based on the consensus in the Taxonomic Outline of Bacteria and Archaea, and the Catalogue of Life). The Eukaryota have five kingdoms: Protozoa, Chromista, Plantae, Fungi, and Animalia. In this classification a protist is any of the eukaryotic unicellular organisms.\nSummary.\nThe kingdom-level classification of life is still widely employed as a useful way of grouping organisms, notwithstanding some problems with this approach:\nBeyond traditional kingdoms.\nWhile the concept of kingdoms continues to be used by some taxonomists, there has been a movement away from traditional kingdoms, as they are no longer seen as providing a cladistic classification, where there is emphasis in arranging organisms into natural groups.\nThree domains of life.\nBased on RNA studies, Carl Woese thought life could be divided into three large divisions and referred to them as the \"three primary kingdom\" model or \"urkingdom\" model.\nIn 1990, the name \"domain\" was proposed for the highest rank, with Latin equivalent \"regio\". Woese divided the prokaryotes (previously classified as the Kingdom Monera) into two groups, called Eubacteria and Archaebacteria, stressing that there was as much genetic difference between these two groups as between either of them and all eukaryotes.\nAccording to genetic data, although eukaryote groups such as plants, fungi, and animals may look different, they are more closely related to each other than they are to either the Eubacteria or Archaea. It was also found that the eukaryotes are more closely related to the Archaea than they are to the Eubacteria. Although the primacy of the Eubacteria-Archaea divide has been questioned, it has been upheld by subsequent research. There is no consensus on how many kingdoms exist in the classification scheme proposed by Woese.\nEukaryotic supergroups.\nIn 2004, a review article by Simpson and Roger noted that the Protista were \"a grab-bag for all eukaryotes that are not animals, plants or fungi\". They held that only monophyletic groups should be accepted as formal ranks in a classification and that \u2013 while this approach had been impractical previously (necessitating \"literally dozens of eukaryotic 'kingdoms'\") \u2013 it had now become possible to divide the eukaryotes into \"just a few major groups that are probably all monophyletic\".\nOn this basis, the diagram opposite (redrawn from their article) showed the real \"kingdoms\" (their quotation marks) of the eukaryotes. A classification which followed this approach was produced in 2005 for the International Society of Protistologists, by a committee which \"worked in collaboration with specialists from many societies\". It divided the eukaryotes into the same six \"supergroups\". The published classification deliberately did not use formal taxonomic ranks, including that of \"kingdom\".\nIn this system the multicellular animals (Metazoa) are descended from the same ancestor as both the unicellular choanoflagellates and the fungi which form the Opisthokonta. Plants are thought to be more distantly related to animals and fungi.\nHowever, in the same year as the International Society of Protistologists' classification was published (2005), doubts were being expressed as to whether some of these supergroups were monophyletic, particularly the Chromalveolata, and a review in 2006 noted the lack of evidence for several of the six proposed supergroups.\nAs of 2019[ [update]], there is widespread agreement that the Rhizaria belong with the Stramenopiles and the Alveolata, in a clade dubbed the SAR supergroup, so that Rhizaria is not one of the main eukaryote groups. \nProkaryotic kingdoms.\nThe \"Prokaryotic Code\" treats Bacteria and Archaea each as a domain. Since 2024, each domain each contains 4 kingdoms, for a total of 8.\nComparison of top level classification.\nSome authors have added non-cellular life to their classifications. This can create a \"superdomain\" called \"Acytota\", also called \"Aphanobionta\", of non-cellular life; with the other superdomain being \"cytota\" or cellular life.&lt;ref name=\"pmidhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26305806/\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (see section below for further discussion)\nThe eocyte hypothesis proposes that the eukaryotes emerged from a phylum within the archaea called the Thermoproteota (formerly known as eocytes or Crenarchaeota).\nViruses.\nThe International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses uses the taxonomic rank \"kingdom\" in the classification of viruses (with the suffix \"-virae\"); but this is beneath the top level classifications of realm and subrealm.\nThere is ongoing debate as to whether viruses can be included in the tree of life. The arguments against include the fact that they are obligate intracellular parasites that lack metabolism and are not capable of replication outside of a host cell. Another argument is that their placement in the tree would be problematic, since it is suspected that viruses have various evolutionary origins, and they have a penchant for harvesting nucleotide sequences from their hosts.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "53667", "revid": "12608568", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53667", "title": "United States Department of the Treasury", "text": "United States federal executive department\nThe Department of the Treasury (USDT) is the national treasury and finance department of the federal government of the United States. It is one of 15 current U.S. government departments. \nThe department oversees the Bureau of Engraving and Printing and the U.S. Mint, two federal agencies responsible for printing all paper currency and minting coins. The treasury executes currency circulation in the domestic fiscal system, collects all federal taxes through the Internal Revenue Service, manages U.S. government debt instruments, licenses and supervises banks and thrift institutions, and advises the legislative and executive branches on fiscal policy. The department is administered by the secretary of the treasury, who is a member of the Cabinet. The treasurer of the United States has limited statutory duties, but advises the Secretary on various matters such as coinage and currency production. Signatures of both officials appear on all Federal Reserve Notes.\nThe department was established by an Act of Congress in 1789 to manage government revenue. The first secretary of the treasury was Alexander Hamilton from New York, a Founding Father. Appointed by George Washington, the nation's first president, Hamilton was sworn into office on September 11, 1789. Hamilton was recommended to Washington by Robert Morris from Pennsylvania, who was also a Second Continental Congress delegate. Morris was Washington's first choice for the position, but declined the appointment. Hamilton established the nation's early financial system and for several years was a major presence in Washington's administration. \nThe department is customarily referred to as \"Treasury\", solely, without any preceding article \u2013 a transitional remnant from British to American English. Hamilton's portrait appears on the obverse of the ten-dollar bill, while the Treasury Building in Washington, D.C. is depicted on the reverse.\nHistory.\nAmerican Revolution.\nThe history of the Department of the Treasury began during the American Revolution when the Continental Congress, convening in Philadelphia, deliberated the crucial question of how it would finance the American Revolutionary War in which the Thirteen Colonies ultimately sought independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain, then led by King George III.\nThe Congress had no power to levy and collect taxes, nor was there a tangible basis for securing funds from foreign investors or governments. The delegates resolved to issue paper money in the form of bills of credit, promising redemption in coin on faith in the revolutionary cause. On June 22, 1775, only a few days after the Battle of Bunker Hill, the Continental Congress issued $2\u00a0million in bills; on July 25, 28 citizens of Philadelphia were employed by Congress to sign and number the currency.\nOn July 29, 1775, the Second Continental Congress assigned responsibility for the administration of the revolutionary government's finances to joint Continental treasurers George Clymer and Michael Hillegas. Congress stipulated that each of the colonies contribute to the Continental government's funds. To ensure proper and efficient handling of the growing national debt in the face of weak economic and political ties between the colonies, the Congress, on February 17, 1776, designated a committee of five to superintend the treasury, settle accounts, and report periodically to the Congress. On April 1, a Treasury Office of Accounts, consisting of an auditor general and clerks, was established to facilitate the settlement of claims and to keep the public accounts for the government of the United Colonies. With the signing of the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776, the newborn republic as a sovereign nation was able to secure loans from abroad.\nDespite the infusion of foreign and domestic loans, the united colonies were unable to establish a well-organized agency for financial administration. Michael Hillegas was first called Treasurer of the United States on May 14, 1777. The Treasury Office was reorganized three times between 1778 and 1781. The $241.5\u00a0million in paper Continental bills devalued rapidly. By May 1781, the dollar collapsed at a rate of from 500 to 1000 to 1 against hard currency. Protests against the worthless money swept the colonies, giving rise to the expression \"not worth a Continental\".\nLate 18th century.\nSince the late 18th century, the office has been customarily referred to as the singular \"Treasury\", without any preceding article, as a remnant of the country's transition from British to American English. For example, the department notes its guiding purpose as \"Treasury's mission\" instead of \"the Treasury's mission.\"\nRobert Morris was designated Superintendent of Finance in 1781 and restored stability to the nation's finances. Morris, a wealthy colonial merchant, was nicknamed \"the financier\" because of his reputation for procuring funds or goods on a moment's notice. His staff included a comptroller, a treasurer, a register, and auditors, who managed the country's finances through 1784, when Morris resigned because of ill health. The treasury board, consisting of three commissioners, continued to oversee the finances of the confederation of former colonies until September 1789.\nFounding.\nThe First United States Congress convened in New York City on March 4, 1789, marking the beginning of government under the U.S. Constitution. On September 2, 1789, Congress created a permanent institution for the management of government finances:Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That there shall be a Department of Treasury, in which shall be the following officers, namely: a Secretary of the Treasury, to be deemed head of the department; a Comptroller, an Auditor, a Treasurer, a Register, and an Assistant to the Secretary of the Treasury, which assistant shall be appointed by the said Secretary.Alexander Hamilton took the oath of office as the first secretary of the treasury on September 11, 1789. Hamilton had served as George Washington's \"aide-de-camp\" during the American Revolutionary War and was influential in the ratification of the Constitution. Hamilton's financial and managerial acumen made him a logical choice for addressing the problem of the new nation's heavy war debt. His first official act as secretary was to submit a report to Congress in which he laid the foundation for the nation's financial health.\nTo the surprise of many legislators, he insisted upon federal assumption and dollar-for-dollar repayment of the country's $75\u00a0million debt in order to revitalize the public credit: \"[T]he debt of the United States was the price of liberty. The faith of America has been repeatedly pledged for it, and with solemnities that give peculiar force to the obligation.\" Hamilton foresaw the development of industry and trade in the United States, suggesting that government revenues be based upon customs duties. His sound financial policies also inspired investment in the Bank of the United States, which acted as the government's fiscal agent.\nThe Department of Treasury believes their seal was created by Francis Hopkinson, the treasurer of loans. He submitted bills to Congress in 1780 that authorized the design of department seals, including a seal for the Board of Treasury. While it is not certain that Hopkinson designed the seal, it closely resembles others he created.\n19th and 20th centuries.\nIn 1861, Sophia Holmes became the first Black woman to be employed by the Treasury Department and by the Federal government of the United States when Senator Henry Wilson, James G. Blaine and others advocated for her hiring as a janitor under Secretary of the Treasury Francis Spinner. She was paid fifteen dollars per month. In 1862, she prevented a major theft from the department of more than $200,000 when she came across a box filled with U.S. currency, including a number of thousand-dollar bills, and reported it to Secretary Spinner. \nU.S. president Abraham Lincoln subsequently honored her with a commendation for her actions, and the federal government rewarded her with an appointment for life as a messenger with its department of Issues. Another early woman hired by the department was Jennie Douglas in 1862. Douglas, who was also recruited by Spinner, is sometimes attributed to having been the first woman to have held an appointed position in the federal government.\n21st century.\nDepartmental reorganization.\nThe U.S. Congress transferred several agencies that had previously been under the aegis of the Treasury Department to other departments as a consequence of the September 11 attacks. Effective January 24, 2003, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), which had been a bureau of the department since 1972, was extensively reorganized under the provisions of the Homeland Security Act of 2002. The law enforcement functions of ATF, including the regulation of legitimate traffic in firearms and explosives, were transferred to the Department of Justice as the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (BATFE). The regulatory and tax collection functions of ATF related to legitimate traffic in alcohol and tobacco remained with the treasury at its new Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB).\nEffective March 1, 2003, the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, the U.S. Customs Service, and the U.S. Secret Service were transferred to the newly created Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\").\n2020 data breach.\nIn 2020, Treasury suffered a data breach following a cyberattack likely conducted by a nation state adversary, possibly Russia. This was in fact the first detected case of the much wider 2020 United States federal government data breach, which involved at least eight federal departments.\nResponsibilities.\nBasic functions.\nThe basic functions of the Department of the Treasury include:\nWith respect to the estimation of revenues for the executive branch, Treasury serves a purpose parallel to that of the Office of Management and Budget for the estimation of spending for the executive branch, the Joint Committee on Taxation for the estimation of revenues for Congress, and the Congressional Budget Office for the estimation of spending for Congress.\nFrom 1830 until 1901, responsibility for overseeing weights and measures was carried out by the Office of Standard Weights and Measures under the auspices of the Treasury Department. After 1901, that responsibility was assigned to the agency that subsequently became known as the National Institute of Standards and Technology.\nOrganization.\nThe Department of the Treasury is organized into two major components: the departmental offices and the operating bureaus. The departmental offices are primarily responsible for the formulation of policy and management of the department as a whole, while the operating bureaus carry out the specific operations assigned to the department.\nBudget and staffing.\nThe Treasury Department has authorized a budget for Fiscal Year 2024 of $16.5\u00a0billion. The budget authorization is broken down as follows:\nFreedom of Information Act processing performance.\nIn the 2015 Center for Effective Government analysis of the 15 federal agencies that receive the most Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests (using 2012 and 2013 data, the most recent years available), Treasury failed to earn a satisfactory overall grade.\nNotes and references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "53669", "revid": "13286072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53669", "title": "C\u00f3rdoba, Spain", "text": "City in Andalusia, Spain\nC\u00f3rdoba ( ; ), or sometimes Cordova ( ), is a city in Andalusia, Spain, and the capital of the province of C\u00f3rdoba. With a population of 324,902 as of 2024, it is the 12th-largest city in Spain and the 3rd-largest in Andalusia.\nThe city primarily lies on the right bank of the Guadalquivir in the south of the Iberian Peninsula. Once a Roman colony, it was taken over by the Visigothic Kingdom in the sixth century and then conquered by the Muslims in the eighth century. C\u00f3rdoba became the capital of the Emirate and then Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba, from which the Umayyad dynasty ruled al-Andalus. Under Umayyad rule, C\u00f3rdoba was transformed into a centre of education and learning, and by the 10th century it had grown to be the second-largest city in Europe. The caliphate experienced a manifold political crisis in the early 11th century that brought about state collapse. Following the Christian conquest in 1236, C\u00f3rdoba became part of the Crown of Castile as the head of the Kingdom of C\u00f3rdoba.\nC\u00f3rdoba is home to notable examples of Moorish architecture such as the Mezquita-Catedral, which was named as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1984 and is now a cathedral. The site has since been expanded to encompass the whole historic centre of C\u00f3rdoba. Madinat al-Zahra near the city is also a World Heritage Site while the Festival de los Patios has been recognized as UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage.\nC\u00f3rdoba has the highest summer temperatures in Spain and Europe, with average high temperatures around in July and August. Summers are very dry whereas the mild winters have frequent rainfall.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"C\u00f3rdoba\" has attracted fanciful explanations. One theory, suggested in 1799 by Jos\u00e9 Antonio Conde, is that the name comes from Punic \"qart \u1e6d\u016bbah\" 'good town'. C. F. Seybold and M. Oca\u00f1a Jim\u00e9nez write, \"The name is certainly not Semitic but Old Iberian.\" After the Roman conquest, the town's name was Latinised as \"Corduba\". During the era of Muslim rule the city was known in Arabic as ().\nHistory.\nPrehistory, antiquity and Roman foundation of the city.\nThe first traces of human presence in the area are remains of a Neanderthal dating to c.\u200942,000 to 35,000 BC. Pre-urban settlements around the mouth of the Guadalquivir are known to have existed from the 8th century BC. The population gradually learned copper and silver metallurgy. The first historical mention of a settlement dates to the Carthaginian expansion across the Guadalquivir. C\u00f3rdoba was conquered by the Romans in 206 BC.\nIn 169 BC, Roman consul Marcus Claudius Marcellus, the grandson of Marcus Claudius Marcellus, who had governed both Hispania Ulterior and Hispania Citerior respectively, founded a newer settlement alongside the pre-existing one. The date is contested; it could have been founded in 152 BC. Between 143 and 141 BC the town was besieged by Viriatus. A forum is known to have existed in the city in 113 BC. The famous Cordoba Treasure, with mixed local and Roman artistic traditions, was buried in the city at this time; it is now in the British Museum.\nCorduba became a colonia with the name \"Colonia Patricia\" between 46 and 45 BC. It was sacked by Julius Caesar in 45 because of its fealty to Pompey and resettled with veteran soldiers by Augustus. It became the capital of Baetica, with a forum and numerous temples, and was the main center of Roman intellectual life in \"Hispania Ulterior\". The Roman philosopher Seneca the Younger, his father, the orator Seneca the Elder, and his nephew, the poet Lucan came from Roman C\u00f3rdoba.\nIn the late Roman period, Hosius of Corduba or \"Bishop Ossius\" was the dominant figure of the Latin Church throughout the earlier 4th century. Later, Corduba occupied an important place in the \"Provincia Hispaniae\" of the Byzantine Empire (552\u2013572); the Visigoths conquered it in the late 6th century.\nUmayyad rule.\nC\u00f3rdoba was captured by the Muslims in 711 or 712. Unlike other Iberian towns, no capitulation was signed and the position was taken by storm. C\u00f3rdoba was in turn governed by direct Arab rule. The new Umayyad commanders established themselves within the city and in 716 it became the provincial capital, subordinate to the Caliphate of Damascus, replacing Seville. In Arabic it was known as (Qur\u1e6duba).\nThe centre of the Roman and Visigothic cities became the walled \"medina\". Over time, as many as 21 suburbs ( \"raba\u1e0d\", pl. \"arb\u0101\u1e0d\") developed around the city.\nIn 747, a battle took place in the surroundings of C\u00f3rdoba, the Battle of Saqunda, pitting Arab Yemenites against northerner Qays.\nFollowing the Abbasid ousting of the Umayyad Caliphate after 750, the surviving Umayyad Abd ar-Rahman crossed to the Iberian Peninsula in 756. He proclaimed himself Emir Abd ar-Rahman I and established his dynasty in C\u00f3rdoba once the rump \"w\u0101li\" Yusuf ibn Abd al-Rahman al-Fihri was defeated at a battle outside the city in May 756. In 785\u2013786 (169 AH) he ordered construction of the Great Mosque of C\u00f3rdoba, which was completed the next year and underwent later expansions under his successors.\nHistorians' estimations of C\u00f3rdoba's population during the 9th century range from 75,000 to 160,000. The ruthless repression of the 818 revolt in the southern suburb of C\u00f3rdoba led to the destruction of the place. In the 10th and 11th centuries C\u00f3rdoba was one of the most advanced cities in the world, and a great cultural, political, financial and economic centre.\nC\u00f3rdoba had a prosperous economy, with manufactured goods including leather, metal work, glazed tiles and textiles, and agricultural produce including a range of fruits, vegetables, herbs and spices, and materials such as cotton, flax and silk. It was also famous as a centre of learning, home to over 80 libraries and institutions of learning, with knowledge of medicine, mathematics, astronomy, botany far exceeding the rest of Europe at the time. Later, the vizier al-Mansur \u2013 the \"de facto\" ruler of al-Andalus from 976 to 1002 \u2013 burned most of the books on philosophy from the library of Caliph al-Hakam II to appease Maliki jurists (\"ulama\"); most of the others were sold off or perished in the civil strife not long after.\nAfter a period of weak central rule, Abd ar-Rahman III came to power as emir in 912 and campaigned lengthily and systematically to re-establish the authority of C\u00f3rdoba across Al-Andalus. In 929, after years of military and diplomatic efforts, he felt confident enough to declare himself \"caliph\", a title challenging the Abbasid caliphs in Baghdad and the Fatimid caliphs in North Africa. This inaugurated the height of C\u00f3rdoba's power and influence in the 10th century. This century saw the construction of two palatine cities in the surroundings of C\u00f3rdoba: Mad\u012bnat al-Zahr\u0101 to the west, built by Abd ar-Rahman III, and another one built later by al-Mansur (Medina Alzahira) to the east. \nIsa al-Razi describes Cordoba as \"surrounded by many beautiful estates\" and many varied fruit trees. The inner city of Cordoba was surrounded by 11 palaces, 22 \"almuna\" and 12 \"arbad\" (or suburbs), mainly on the right bank of the Guadalquivir, and in particular to the north and west of the city. Not much later, Ibn Bashkuwal lists a total of 21 suburbs (two to the south, three to the north, seven to the east and nine to the west). To the north, part of the rabad al-Rusafa was located just south of the present Parador of Arruzafa (or Parador of Cordoba), where excavations in the 1990s uncovered the remains of a variety of \"almuna\", Roman villas and irrigation systems (with one \"aljibe\" of the early medieval period preserved in the basement of a private suburban house).\nThe economic historian J. Bradford DeLong estimates the city's population at 400,000 around 1000 AD, while estimates from other historians range from 100,000 to 1,000,000 during the same era. Whatever C\u00f3rdoba's population was, the city's apogee came to an abrupt halt after the 1009 crisis.\nOn 15 February 1009, with Hisham II as caliph and Abd al-Rahman Sanchuelo as hajib (and \"de facto\" ruler), a revolution broke out in C\u00f3rdoba, which led to the proclamation of an alternative caliph. This marked the beginning of a long period of civil war and conflict in Al-Andalus known as the \"Fitna\". Berbers entered and sacked C\u00f3rdoba in May 1013. Hisham III was routed from C\u00f3rdoba on 30 November 1031 and an oligarchic republic replaced the caliphate.\nHigh and Late Middle Ages.\nUnder rule of the Banu Yahwar, Cordobese power did not extend far from the city, as other independent polities emerged in the rest of the former caliphate. An estimation of 65,000 inhabitants has been proposed for 11th-century C\u00f3rdoba.\nIn 1070, forces from the Abbadid Taifa of Seville entered C\u00f3rdoba to help in the defence of the city, which had been besieged by al-Mamun of Toledo, ruler of Toledo, yet they took control and expelled the last ruler of the taifa of C\u00f3rdoba, Abd-Al Malik, forcing him to exile. Al-Mamun did not cease in his efforts to take the city, and making use of a Sevillian renegade who murdered the Abbadid governor, he triumphantly entered the city on 15 February 1075, only to die there barely five months later, apparently poisoned. C\u00f3rdoba was seized by force in March 1091 by the Almoravids. In 1121, the population revolted against the abuses of the Almoravid governor.\nSworn enemies of the Almoravid dynasty, the \"Wolf King\" Ab\u016b \u02bfAbd All\u0101h Mu\u1e25ammad ibn Sa\u02bfd ibn Mardan\u012bsh and his stepfather ibn Hamu\u0161k allied with Alfonso VIII of Castile and laid siege to C\u00f3rdoba by 1158\u20131160, ravaging the surroundings but failing to take the city.\nAlmohad caliph Abdallah al-Adil appointed Al-Bayyasi (brother of Zayd Abu Zayd) as governor of C\u00f3rdoba in 1224, only for the city to later become independent from Caliphal rule. Al-Bayyasi asked Ferdinand III of Castile for help and C\u00f3rdoba revolted against him. Years later, in 1229, the city submitted to the authority of Ibn Hud, disavowing him in 1233, joining instead the territories under Muhammad Ibn al-A\u1e25mar, ruler of Arjona and soon-to-be emir of Granada.\nFerdinand III entered the city on 29 June 1236, following a siege of several months. According to Arab sources, C\u00f3rdoba fell on 23 Shawwal 633 (that is, on 30 June 1236, a day later than Christian tradition). Upon the city's conquest the mosque was converted into a Catholic cathedral dedicated to the Virgin Mary (\"Santa Maria\"). This was also followed by the return to Santiago de Compostela of the church bells that had been looted by Almanzor and moved to C\u00f3rdoba by Christian war prisoners in the late 10th century. Ferdinand III granted the city a \"fuero\" in 1241; it was based on the \"Liber Iudiciorum\" and in the customs of Toledo, yet formulated in an original way. Unlike the case of other kingdoms of the Crown of Castile, the wider Kingdom of C\u00f3rdoba distinctly lacked \"realengo\" (royal demesne) council towns other than the capital city itself. In addition, the military orders had a comparatively lesser presence across the realm. The city was divided into 14 \"colaciones\", and numerous new church buildings were added.\nBy the end of the 13th century, the land belonging to the council of C\u00f3rdoba peaked at about 12,000\u00a0km2. It progressively reduced upon creation of new lordships, amounting to about 9,000\u00a0km2 by the end of the middle ages.\nThe city's surrounding countryside was raided during the 1277\u201378 Marinid expedition in the Guadalquivir valley. In 1282, in the context of the problematic succession of Alfonso X of Castile, an army formed by the latter's supporters as well as Marinid forces laid siege to the city (where prince Sancho was) for 21 days. The city council had indeed joined a newly created brotherhood in 1282 together with other councils of the Upper Guadalquivir defending Sancho's dynastic rights against Alfonso's regal authoritarianism.\nMany decades after during the Third Siege of Gibraltar in 1333, a diversionary Granadian army raided the countryside of Cordoba and encamped on the far side of the Roman Bridge of Cordoba. However the diversionary army had to return to Gibraltar to help their Marinid counterparts so no further action was taken. In 1368, during the Castilian Civil War, the city, loyal to the Trast\u00e1mara side, was attacked by forces supporting of Peter I, with Granadan backing.\nModern history.\nIn the context of the Early Modern Period, the city experienced a golden age between 1530 and 1580, profiting from an economic activity based on the trade of agricultural products and the preparation of clothes originally from Los Pedroches, peaking at a population of about 50,000 by 1571. A period of stagnation and ensuing decline followed.\nIt was reduced to 20,000 inhabitants in the 18th century. The population and economy started to increase again only in the early 20th century. The second half of the 19th century saw the arrival of railway transport via the opening of the Seville\u2013C\u00f3rdoba line on 2 June 1859.\nC\u00f3rdoba was connected by railway to Jerez and C\u00e1diz in 1861 and, in 1866, following the link with Manzanares, with Madrid. The city was eventually connected to M\u00e1laga and Belmez.\nOn 18 July 1936, the military governor of the province, Colonel Ciriaco Cascajo, launched the Nationalist \"coup\" in the city, bombing the civil government and arresting the civil governor, Rodr\u00edguez de Le\u00f3n; these actions ignited the Spanish Civil War. Following the orders of the putschist General Queipo de Llano, he declared a state of war. The putschists were met by the resistance of the political and social representatives who had gathered in the civil government headquarters, and remained there until the Nationalist rifle fire and the presence of artillery broke their morale. When its defenders began fleeing the building, Rodr\u00edguez de Le\u00f3n finally decided to surrender and was arrested.\nIn the following weeks, Queipo de Llano and Major Bruno Iba\u00f1ez carried out a bloody repression in which 2,000 persons were executed. The ensuing Francoist repression in wartime and in the immediate post-war period (1936\u20131951) is estimated to have led to around 9,579 killings in the province.\nThe Mosque-Cathedral was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1984, and in 1994 this status was extended to the entire historic centre of C\u00f3rdoba. The city has a number of modern areas, including the district of Zoco and the area surrounding the railway station.\nThe regional government (the Junta de Andaluc\u00eda) has for some time been studying the creation of a \"C\u00f3rdoba Metropolitan Area\" that would comprise, in addition to the capital itself, the towns of Villafranca de C\u00f3rdoba, Obejo, La Carlota, Villaharta, Villaviciosa, Almod\u00f3var del R\u00edo and Guadalc\u00e1zar. The combined population of such an area would be around 351,000.\nGeography.\nC\u00f3rdoba is located in the south of the Iberian Peninsula, in the Guadalquivir depression formed by the Guadalquivir river, that cuts across the city in an east-north east to west-south west direction. The wider municipality extends across an area of 1,254.25\u00a0km2, making it the largest municipality in Andalusia and the fourth largest in Spain.\nThe city of C\u00f3rdoba lies in the middle course of the river. Three major landscape units in the municipality include the Sierra (as in the southern reaches of Sierra Morena), the Valley proper and the \"Campi\u00f1a\".\nThe differences in elevation in the Valley are very small, ranging from 100 and 170 metres above sea level, with the city proper located at an average altitude of roughly 125 metres above sea level. The landscape of the valley is further subdivided in the \"piedmont\" connecting with the Sierra, the fluvial terraces and the most immediate vicinity of the river course.\nThe Miocene \"Campi\u00f1a\", located in the southern bank of the Guadalquivir, features a hilly landscape gently increasing in height up to about 200 m. In the \"Sierra\", to the north of the city, the altitude increases relatively abruptly up to 500 meters. Both the \"Sierra\" and the \"Campi\u00f1a\" display viewpoints over the valley.\nClimate.\nC\u00f3rdoba has a hot Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification \"Csa\"). It has the highest summer average daily temperatures in Spain and Europe (with highs averaging in July and August) and days with temperatures over are common in the summer months. August's 24-hour average of is also one of the highest in Europe, despite relatively cool nightly temperatures. On average, C\u00f3rdoba has 16 days with maximum temperatures over and 68 days with maximum temperatures over . These scorching summers occur due to its location in the Guadalquivir Valley, which is considered to be the region with the hottest summer in Europe and even one of the hottest summers in the world that is not located in a semi-arid or arid region.\nWinters are mild, yet cooler than other low lying cities in southern Spain due to its interior location, wedged between the Sierra Morena and the Penibaetic System. Precipitation is concentrated in the coldest months; this is due to the dry summer climate pattern featured in large parts of the Iberian Peninsula. Precipitation is generated by storms from the west that occur most frequently from December to February. This Atlantic characteristic then gives way to a hot summer with significant drought more typical of Mediterranean climates. Annual rain surpasses , although it is recognized to vary from year to year.\nIn July 2022, there were 19 days with highs over and 30 days with highs over , with the average high of for that month, which is the highest ever recorded in the country and in Europe among all cities with a population over 100,000. On 27 April 2023, C\u00f3rdoba broke the record for the highest maximum temperature recorded in peninsular Spain and Europe in a month of April, which registered . The registered maximum temperature at the C\u00f3rdoba Airport, located at from the city, was on 13 July 2017 and 14 August 2021. The lowest registered temperature was , on 28 January 2005.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAs of 2024, the foreign-born population of the city is 19,432, equal to 6.0% of the total population.\nLandmarks.\nThe historic centre of C\u00f3rdoba has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1994.\nRoman.\nThe Roman Bridge, over the Guadalquivir River, links the area of Campo de la Verdad with Barrio de la Catedral. It was the only bridge of the city for twenty centuries, until the construction of the San Rafael Bridge in the mid-20th century. It was initially built in the early 1st century BC during the reign of emperor Augustus but significantly rebuilt in the 8th century under Umayyad rule. It has a length of about 250\u00a0m and has 16 arches.\nOther Roman remains include the Roman Temple, the Theatre, Mausoleum, the Colonial Forum, the \"Forum Adiectum\", an amphitheater and the remains of the Palace of Emperor Maximian in the archaeological site of Cercadilla.\nIslamic.\nGreat Mosque of C\u00f3rdoba.\nFrom 784- 786 AD, Abd al-Rahman I built the Great Mosque of C\u00f3rdoba, one of the most famous monuments of Western Islamic (Moorish) architecture and for centuries the third largest mosque in the world. It integrated aspects of Islamic architecture with some indigenous elements of Roman and Visigothic architecture. Later Umayyad rulers expanded the mosque, adding a minaret and extending the prayer hall. A major 10th-century expansion resulted in the elaborate mihrab and other ornate embellishments seen today. After the Christian conquest of the city the mosque was converted to a cathedral. It underwent significant modifications in the 16th century but much of the original structure remains. The building was listed as a World Heritage Site in 1984.\nMinaret of San Juan.\nBuilt in 930 AD, the mosque that this minaret adorned has been replaced by a church and the minaret re-purposed as a tower. It retains characteristics of Islamic architecture in the region, including a double horseshoe-arch windows.\nMills of the Guadalquivir.\nAlong the banks of the Guadalquivir are the Mills of the Guadalquivir, an array of watermills from different periods that used the power of the water current to grind flour. They include the Albolafia, Alegr\u00eda watermill, Carbonell, Casillas, Enmedio, Lope Garc\u00eda, Martos, P\u00e1palo, San Antonio, San Lorenzo and San Rafael mills.\nCalahorra Tower.\nThe Calahorra is a fortified tower standing at the southern end of the city's Roman Bridge. Its original construction is attributed to the Almohad period. It now houses the Al-Andalus Living Museum (\"Museo Vivo de Al-Andalus\"), a museum on the cultural achievements of Al-Andalus.\nCaliphal Baths.\nNear the Alc\u00e1zar de los Reyes Cristianos, on the site of the former Islamic-era Alc\u00e1zar, are the Caliphal Baths, a partly reconstructed hammam (baths) complex created in the 10th century and subsequently expanded. The archeological site has been open as a museum since 2006.\nMedina Azahara.\nOn the outskirts of the city lies the archaeological site of Madinat al-Zahra, the 10th-century palace-city. It is another major example of Islamic architecture in Spain and has been undergoing excavation and reconstruction since 1911.\nJewish Quarter.\nNear the cathedral is the old Jewish quarter, which consists of many irregular streets that preserve some of the city's medieval aspect. It contains a museum, the Sepharad House, and the Synagogue, built in 1315.\nChristian.\nSurrounding the large Old town are the Roman walls: gates include the Puerta de Almod\u00f3var, the Puerta de Sevilla and Puerta del Puente, which are the only three gates remaining from the original thirteen. Towers and fortresses include the Malmuerta Tower, Torre de Bel\u00e9n and the Puerta del Rinc\u00f3n's Tower.\nIn the south of the Old town and east of the great cathedral, in the Plaza del Potro, is the \"Posada del Potro\", a row of inns mentioned in literary works including \"Don Quixote\" and \"La Feria de los Discretos\", and which remained active until 1972. Both the plaza and the inn get their name from the fountain in the centre of the plaza, which represents a foal (\"potro\"). Not far from this plaza is the \"Arco del Portillo\" (a 14th-century arch). In the extreme southwest of the Old Town is the Alc\u00e1zar de los Reyes Cristianos, a former royal property and the seat of the Inquisition; adjacent to it are the Royal Stables, where Andalusian horses are bred. Palace buildings in the Old Town include the \"Palacio de Viana\" (14th century) and the \"Palacio de la Merced\" among others. Other sights include the \"Cuesta del Bail\u00edo\" (a staircase connecting the upper and lower part of the city).\nFernandine churches.\nThe city is home to 12 Christian churches that were built (many as transformations of mosques) by Ferdinand III of Castile after the reconquest of the city in the 13th century. They were to act both as churches and as the administrative centres in the neighborhoods into which the city was divided in medieval times. Some of those that remain are:\nSculptures and memorials.\nScattered throughout the city are ten statues of the Archangel Raphael, protector and custodian of the city. These are called the Triumphs of Saint Raphael, and are located in landmarks such as the Roman Bridge, the Puerta del Puente and the Plaza del Potro.\nIn the western part of the Historic Centre are the statue of Seneca (near the \"Puerta de Almod\u00f3var\", a gate from the time of Islamic rule, (the Statue of Averroes (next to the \"Puerta de la Luna\"), and Maimonides (in the plaza de Tiberiades). Further south, near the Puerta de Sevilla, are the sculpture to the poet Ibn Zayd\u00fan and the sculpture of the writer and poet Ibn Hazm and, inside the Alc\u00e1zar de los Reyes Cristianos, the monument to the Catholic Monarchs and Christopher Columbus.\nThere are also several sculptures in plazas of the Old Town. In the central Plaza de las Tendillas is the equestrian statue of Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba, in the Plaza de Capuchinos is the Cristo de los Faroles, in Plaza de la Trinidad is the statue of Luis de G\u00f3ngora, in the Plaza del Cardenal Salazar is the bust of Ahmad ibn Muhammad abu Yafar al-Gafiqi, in the Plaza de Capuchinas is the statue to the bishop Osio, in Plaza del Conde de Priego is the monument to Manolete and the Campo Santo de los M\u00e1rtires is a statue to Al-Hakam II and the monument to the lovers.\nIn the Jardines de la Agricultura is the monument to the painter Julio Romero de Torres, a bust by sculptor Mateo Inurria, a bust of the poet Julio Aumente and the sculpture dedicated to the gardener Aniceto Garc\u00eda Rold\u00e1n, who was killed in the park. Further south, in the Gardens of the Duke of Rivas, is a statue of writer and poet \u00c1ngel de Saavedra, 3rd Duke of Rivas by sculptor Mariano Benlliure.\nIn the Guadalquivir river, near the San Rafael Bridge is the Island of the sculptures, an artificial island with a dozen stone sculptures executed during the International Sculpture Symposium. Up the river, near the Miraflores bridge, is the \"Hombre R\u00edo\", a sculpture of a swimmer looking to the sky and whose orientation varies depending on the current.\nMuseums.\nThe Archaeological and Ethnological Museum of C\u00f3rdoba is a provincial museum located near the Guadalquivir River. The museum was officially opened in 1867 and shared space with the \"Museum of Fine Arts\" until 1920. In 1960, the museum was relocated to the Renaissance Palace of P\u00e1ez de Castillo where it remains to present day. The Archaeological and Ethnological Museum has eight halls which contain pieces from the middle to late Bronze Age, to Roman culture, Visigothic art, and Islamic culture.\nThe Julio Romero de Torres Museum is located next to the Guadalquivir and was opened in November 1931. The home of Julio Romero de Torres, has undergone many renovations and been turned into a museum and it has also been home to several other historical institutions such as the Archaeological Museum (1868\u20131917) and the Museum of Fine Arts. Many of the works include paintings and motifs done by Julio Romero de Torres himself.\nThe Fine Arts Museum of C\u00f3rdoba is located next to the Julio Romero de Torres Museum which it shares a courtyard with. The building originally was for the old Hospital for Charity but after that the building went under many renovations and renewals to become the renaissance style building it is today. The Museum of Fine Arts contains many works from the baroque period, medieval renaissance art, work from the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, drawings, mannerist art and other unique works.\nThe Diocesan Museum is located in the C\u00f3rdoba's Episcopal Palace which was built upon the former Umayyad \"alc\u00e1zar\". The collection within houses many paintings, sculptures and furniture.\nAnother museum within C\u00f3rdoba are the Caliphal Baths.\nFestivals.\nTourism is especially intense in C\u00f3rdoba during May as this month hosts three of the most important annual festivals in the city:\nPolitics and government.\nAs of 2019[ [update]] Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Bellido Roche (PP) is the mayor of C\u00f3rdoba.\nThe City Council of C\u00f3rdoba is divided into different areas: the Presidency; Human Resources, Management, Tax and Public Administration; City Planning, Infraestructure, and Environment; Social; and Development.

Heinlein\nMethuselah's Children is a science fiction novel by American writer Robert A. Heinlein. Originally serialized in \"Astounding Science Fiction\" in the July, August, and September 1941 issues, it was expanded into a full-length novel in 1958. The novel is part of Heinlein's \"Future History\" series of stories. It introduces the Howard families, a fictional group of people who achieved long lifespans through selective breeding.\nAccording to John W. Campbell, the novel was originally to be called \"While the Evil Days Come Not\", a quotation from Ecclesiastes used as a password on the second page of the story.\nThe novel was the origin of the term \"masquerade\", now used to refer to a fictional trope of a hidden society within the real world.\nPlot summary.\nStarting off a grocer, Ira Howard became rich as a sutler wholesaler during the American Civil War, but died of old age at 48 or 49 years old. The trustees of his will carried out his wishes to prolong human life by financially encouraging those with long-lived grandparents to marry each other and have children. By the 22nd century, the \"Howard families\" have a life expectancy exceeding 150 years and keep their existence secret with the \"Masquerade\" in which the members fake their deaths and obtain new identities.\nThe Masquerade helped the Families survive the dictatorship of Nehemiah Scudder, but as an experiment, some Howard members reveal themselves to The Covenant, hoping that the free society established after Scudder's defeat will be friendly. They are mistaken; others refuse to believe that the Families obtained their lifespan by selective breeding, insisting that they have developed a secret method to extend life. Administrator Slayton Ford, leader of Earth, believes that the Families are telling the truth, but cannot prevent efforts to force Howard members to reveal their alleged rejuvenation treatments.\nLazarus Long, the eldest member of the Families, proposes that the Families hijack the colony starship \"New Frontiers\" to escape Earth. Using an inertialess drive invented by Howard member Andrew Jackson \"Slipstick\" Libby, the Families leave the Solar System with the deposed Ford. The first planet they discover has humanoid inhabitants domesticated by undescribed godlike natives. When Earthly humans prove resistant to similar domestication, they are expelled from the planet.\nThe second planet is a lush environment with no predators and mild weather. Its inhabitants, the \u201cLittle People\u201d, are part of a group mind, with the mental ability to manipulate the environment on the genetic and molecular level, but do not distinguish between individuals. That becomes evident when Mary Sperling, the second oldest member of the Families, joins the group mind to become immortal. The Families are further horrified when the group mind genetically modifies the first baby born on the planet into a new, alien form. A majority of the Families want to return to Earth to demand their freedom; Libby, with the help of the group mind, builds a new faster-than-light drive to take them home in months instead of years.\nThe Families, returning to the Solar System 74 years after their original departure because of time dilation, discover that Earth's scientists have artificially extended human lifespan indefinitely by replicating what they believe is the Families' secret. The Howard members are now welcomed for their discovery of travel faster than light. Libby and Long decide to recruit other members of the Families and explore space with the new drive.\nCritical reception.\nAlva Rogers, in \"A Requiem for Astounding\", wrote that \"Methuselah's Children\" was \"Full of adventure, conflict, romance, and enough casually tossed-off ideas to serve as the basis for a half-dozen other stories.\"\nIn \"Heinlein in Dimension\", Alexei Panshin wrote, \"In many ways this is an important book. For one, its main theme, the problem of escaping death, is one that keeps cropping up in Heinlein stories, and for another, an amazing number of brilliant ideas are tossed out along the way.\" Floyd C. Gale called the book \"a classic\".\nReappearance of characters in other Heinlein novels.\nLazarus Long first appears in this novel. Other Heinlein novels featuring him include \"Time Enough for Love\", \"The Number of the Beast\", \"The Cat Who Walks Through Walls\" and \"To Sail Beyond the Sunset\". Andrew \"Slipstick\" Libby, previously seen as a young adult in the short story \"Misfit\", also features prominently in this novel. In \"Time Enough for Love\", Libby is said to have become Lazarus Long's partner in space travel until his death.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The city, located in Hartford County, had a population of 121,054 at the 2020 census and was estimated at 124,006 in 2025. Hartford is the most populous city in the Capitol Planning Region and the core city of the Greater Hartford metropolitan area with 1.17 million residents.\nFounded in 1635, Hartford is among the oldest cities in the United States of America. It is home to the country's second oldest public art museum (Wadsworth Atheneum), the second oldest publicly funded park (Bushnell Park), the oldest continuously published newspaper (the \"Hartford Courant\"), the second-oldest secondary school (Hartford Public High School), and the oldest school for deaf children (American School for the Deaf), founded by Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet in 1817. It is the location of the Mark Twain House, in which the author Mark Twain wrote his most famous works and raised his family. He wrote in 1868, \"Of all the beautiful towns it has been my fortune to see this is the chief.\"\nHartford alternated with New Haven as dual capitals of Connecticut from 1664, and Hartford has been the sole capital since 1875. Hartford was the richest city in the United States for several decades following the American Civil War. Since 2015, it has been one of the poorest cities in the country, with three out of ten families living below the poverty threshold. In sharp contrast, the Greater Hartford metropolitan statistical area was ranked 32nd of 318 metropolitan areas in total economic production and 8th out of 280 metropolitan statistical areas in per capita income in 2015.\nNicknamed the \"Insurance Capital of the World\" and \"America's filing cabinet\", the city holds high sufficiency as a global city, as home to the headquarters of many insurance companies, the region's major industry. Other prominent industries include the services, education and healthcare industries. Hartford coordinates certain Hartford\u2013Springfield regional development matters through the Knowledge Corridor Economic Partnership.\nHistory.\nVarious Native American tribes lived in or around Hartford, all Algonquian peoples. These included the Podunks, mostly east of the Connecticut River; the Poquonocks north and west of Hartford; the Massacoes in the Simsbury area; the Tunxis tribe in West Hartford and Farmington; the Wangunks to the south; and the Saukiog in Hartford itself.\nColonial Hartford.\nThe first Europeans known to have explored the area were the Dutch under Adriaen Block, who sailed up the Connecticut in 1614. Dutch fur traders from New Amsterdam returned in 1623 with a mission to establish a trading post and fortify the area for the Dutch West India Company. The original site was located on the south bank of the Park River in the present-day Sheldon/Charter Oak neighborhood. This fort was called Fort Hoop or the \"House of Hope.\" In 1633, Jacob Van Curler formally bought the land around Fort Hoop from the Pequot chief for a small sum. It was home to perhaps a couple of families and a few dozen soldiers. The fort was abandoned by 1654, but the area is known today as Dutch Point; the name of the Dutch fort \"House of Hope\" is reflected in the name of Huyshope Avenue. A significant reason for establishment of the Dutch trading post was to better control the flow of wampum, the de facto currency of New Netherland and portions of New England, to and from valuable Native American fur traders.\nThe Dutch outpost and the tiny contingent of Dutch soldiers who were stationed there did little to check the English migration, and the Dutch soon realized that they were vastly outnumbered. The House of Hope remained an outpost, but it was steadily swallowed up by waves of English settlers. In 1650, Peter Stuyvesant met with English representatives to negotiate a permanent boundary between the Dutch and English colonies; the line that they agreed on was more than west of the original settlement.\nThe English began to arrive in 1636, settling upstream from Fort Hoop near the present-day Downtown and Sheldon/Charter Oak neighborhoods. Puritan pastors Thomas Hooker and Samuel Stone, along with Governor John Haynes, led 100 settlers with 130 head of cattle in a trek from Newtown in the Massachusetts Bay Colony (now Cambridge) and started their settlement just north of the Dutch fort. The settlement was originally called Newtown, but it was changed to Hartford in 1637 in honor of Stone's hometown of Hertford, England. Hooker also created the nearby town of Windsor in 1633. The etymology of \"Hartford\" is the ford where \"harts\" cross, or \"deer crossing.\"\nAs the Puritan minister in Hartford, Thomas Hooker wielded a great deal of power; in 1638, he delivered a sermon that inspired the writing of the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut, which provided a framework for Connecticut's separation for Massachusetts Bay Colony and the formation of a civil government. The Fundamental Orders of Connecticut were the legal basis for Connecticut Colony until the 1662 royal charter granted to Connecticut by Charles II.\nThe original settlement area contained the site of the Charter Oak, an old white oak tree in which colonists hid Connecticut's Royal Charter of 1662 to protect it from confiscation by an English governor-general. The state adopted the oak tree as the emblem on the Connecticut state quarter. The Charter Oak Monument is located at the corner of Charter Oak Place, a historic street, and Charter Oak Avenue.\n19th century.\nPolitical turmoil.\nOn December 15, 1814, delegates from the five New England states (Maine was still part of Massachusetts at that time) gathered at the Hartford Convention to discuss New England's possible secession from the United States. During the early 19th century, the Hartford area was a center of abolitionist activity, and the most famous abolitionist family was the Beechers. The Reverend Lyman Beecher was an important Congregational minister known for his anti-slavery sermons. His daughter Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\"; her brother Henry Ward Beecher was a noted clergyman who vehemently opposed slavery and supported the temperance movement and women's suffrage. The Stowes' sister Isabella Beecher Hooker was a leading member of the women's rights movement.\nIn 1860, Hartford was the site of the first \"Wide Awakes\", abolitionist supporters of Abraham Lincoln. These supporters organized torch-light parades that were both political and social events, often including fireworks and music, in celebration of Lincoln's visit to the city. This type of event caught on and eventually became a staple of mid-to-late 19th-century campaigning.\nHartford was a major manufacturing city from the 19th century until the mid-20th century. During the Industrial Revolution into the mid-20th century, the Connecticut River Valley cities produced many major precision manufacturing innovations. Among these was Hartford's pioneer bicycle and automobile maker Pope. Many factories have been closed or relocated, or have reduced operations, as in nearly all former Northern manufacturing cities.\nRise of a major manufacturing center.\n Around 1850, Hartford native Samuel Colt perfected the precision manufacturing process that enabled the mass production of thousands of his revolvers with interchangeable parts. A variety of industries adopted and adapted these techniques over the next several decades, and Hartford became the center of production for a wide array of products, including: Colt, Richard Gatling, and John Browning firearms; Weed sewing machines; Columbia bicycles; Pope automobiles; and leading typewriter manufacturers Royal Typewriter Company and Underwood Typewriter Company, which together made Hartford the \"Typewriter Capitol of the World\" during the first half of the 20th century.\nThe Pratt &amp; Whitney Company was founded in Hartford in 1860 by Francis A. Pratt and Amos Whitney. They built a substantial factory in which the company manufactured a wide range of machine tools, including tools for the makers of sewing machines, and gun-making machinery for use by the Union Army during the American Civil War. In 1925, the company expanded into aircraft engine design at its Hartford factory.\nJust three years after Colt's first factory opened, the Sharps Rifle Manufacturing Company set up shop in 1852 at a nearby site along the now-buried Park River, located in the present-day neighborhood of Frog Hollow. Their factory heralded the beginning of the area's transformation from marshy farmland into a major industrial zone. The road leading from town to the factory was called Rifle Lane; the name was later changed to College Street and then Capitol Avenue. A century earlier, mills had located along the Park River because of the water power, but by the 1850s water power was approaching obsolescence. Sharps located there specifically to take advantage of the railroad line that had been constructed alongside the river in 1838.\nThe Sharps Rifle Company failed in 1870, and the Weed Sewing Machine Company took over its factory. The invention of a new type of sewing machine led to a new application of mass production after the principles of interchangeability were applied to clocks and guns. The Weed Company played a major role in making Hartford one of three machine tool centers in New England and even outranked the Colt Armory in nearby Coltsville in size. Weed eventually became the birthplace of both the bicycle and automobile industries in Hartford.\nIndustrialist Albert Pope was inspired by a British-made, high-wheeled bicycle (called a velocipede) that he saw at the 1876 Philadelphia Centennial Exposition, and he bought patent rights for bicycle production in the United States. He wanted to contract out his first order, however, so he approached George Fairfield of Weed Sewing Machine Company, who produced Pope's first run of bicycles in 1878. Bicycles proved to be a huge commercial success, and production expanded in the Weed factory, with Weed making every part but the tires. Demand for bicycles overshadowed the failing sewing machine market by 1890, so Pope bought the Weed factory, took over as its president, and renamed it the Pope Manufacturing Company. The bicycle boom was short-lived, peaking near the turn of the century when more and more consumers craved individual automobile travel, and Pope's company suffered financially from over-production amidst falling demand.\nIn an effort to save his business, Pope opened a motor carriage department and turned out electric carriages, beginning with the \"Mark III\" in 1897. His venture might have made Hartford the capital of the automobile industry were it not for the ascendancy of Henry Ford and a series of pitfalls and patent struggles that outlived Pope himself.\nIn 1876, Hartford Machine Screw was granted a charter \"for the purpose of manufacturing screws, hardware and machinery of every variety.\" The basis for its incorporation was the invention of the first single-spindle automatic screw machine. For its next four years, the new firm occupied one of Weed's buildings, milling thousands of screws daily on over 50 machines. Its president was George Fairfield, who ran Weed, and its superintendent was Christopher Spencer, one of Connecticut's most versatile inventors. Soon Hartford Machine Screw outgrew its quarters and built a new factory adjacent to Weed, where it remained until 1948.\n20th century.\nOn the week of April 12, 1909, the Connecticut River reached a record flood stage of above the low-water mark, flooding the city of Hartford and doing great damage. On July 6, 1944, Hartford was the scene of one of the worst fire disasters in the history of the United States. Claiming the lives of 168 persons, mostly children and their mothers, and injuring several hundred more. It occurred at a matinee performance of the Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus on Barbour Street in the city's north end and became known as the Hartford Circus Fire.\nAfter World War II, many residents of Puerto Rico moved to Hartford. Starting in the late 1950s, the suburbs ringing Hartford began to grow and flourish and the capital city began a long decline. Insurance giant Connecticut General (now CIGNA) moved to a new, modern campus in the suburb of Bloomfield. Constitution Plaza had been hailed as a model of urban renewal, but it gradually became a concrete office park. Once-flourishing department stores shut down, such as Brown Thomson, Sage-Allen, and G. Fox &amp; Co., as suburban malls grew in popularity, such as Westfarms and Buckland Hills.\nIn 1997, the city lost its professional hockey franchise, with the Hartford Whalers moving to Raleigh, North Carolina\u2014despite an increase in season ticket sales and an offer from the state for a new arena. In 2005, a developer from Newton, Massachusetts tried unsuccessfully to bring an NHL team back to Hartford and house them in a new, publicly funded stadium.\nHartford experienced problems as the population shrank 11 percent during the 1990s. Only Flint, Michigan; Gary, Indiana; St. Louis, Missouri; and Baltimore, Maryland experienced larger population losses during the decade. Nonetheless, the population has increased since the 2000 Census.\nIn 1987, Carrie Saxon Perry was elected mayor of Hartford, becoming the first female African-American mayor of a major American city. Riverfront Plaza was opened in 1999, connecting the riverfront and the downtown area for the first time since the 1960s.\n21st century.\nA significant number of cultural events and performances take place every year at Mortensen Plaza (Riverfront Recapture Organization) by the banks of the Connecticut River. These events are held outdoors and include live music, festivals, dance, arts and crafts. Hartford also has a vibrant theater scene with major Broadway productions at the Bushnell Theater as well as performances at the Hartford Stage and TheaterWorks (City Arts).\nIn July 2017, Hartford considered filing Chapter 9 bankruptcy. After years of contending with a shrinking population base and high pension obligations, a $65 million budget gap was projected for the year of 2018. The city had cut the budget of public services and received union concessions, but these measures did not balance the budget. A state bailout later that year kept the city from filing for bankruptcy.\nDowntown Hartford is busy during the day with commuters, but tends to be quiet in the evenings and weekends. More recently, increased residential and retail development has begun changing the pattern.\nGeography.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (3.67%) is water.\nThe city of Hartford is bordered by the towns of West Hartford, Newington, Wethersfield, East Hartford, Bloomfield, South Windsor, Glastonbury, and Windsor. The Connecticut River forms the boundary between Hartford and East Hartford, and is located on the east side of the city.\nThe Park River originally divided Hartford into northern and southern sections and was a major part of Bushnell Park, but the river was nearly completely enclosed and buried by flood control projects in the 1940s. The former course of the river can still be seen in some of the roadways that were built in the river's place, such as Jewell Street and the Conlin-Whitehead Highway.\nClimate.\nThe K\u00f6ppen climate classification categorizes Hartford as the hot-summer humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen \"Dfa\") bordering on Cfa humid subtropical under the 0\u00a0\u00b0C isotherm.

During the summer, temperatures reach or exceed on an average of 17 days per year; in the winter, overnight temperatures can dip to a range of on at least one night a year. Tropical storms and hurricanes have also struck Hartford, although the occurrence of such systems is rare and is usually confined to the remnants of such storms. Hartford saw extensive damage from the 1938 New England Hurricane, as well as with Hurricane Irene in 2011. The highest officially recorded temperature is on July 22, 2011, and the lowest is on January 22, 1961; the record cold daily maximum is on December 2, 1917, while, conversely, the record warm daily minimum is on July 31, 1917.\nNeighborhoods.\nThe central business district, as well as the State Capitol, Old State House and a number of museums and shops are located Downtown. Parkville, home to Real Art Ways, is named for the confluence of the north and the south branches of the Park River. Frog Hollow, in close proximity to Downtown, is home to Pope Park and Trinity College, which is one of the nation's oldest institutions of higher learning. Asylum Hill, a mixed residential and commercial area, houses the headquarters of several insurance companies as well as the historic homes of Mark Twain and Harriet Beecher Stowe.

More than three-quarters (77%) of the Hispanic population was Puerto Rican (with more than half born on the island of Puerto Rico) and fully 33.7% of all Hartford residents claimed Puerto Rican heritage. This is the second-largest concentration of Puerto Ricans in the Northeast, behind only Holyoke, Massachusetts, approximately to the north along the Connecticut River.\nThere are small but recognizable concentrations of people with origins in Mexico, Colombia, Peru, and the Dominican Republic as well.

It influenced a generation of American baking with a recipe for leavening bread with pearl ash. The full text of the book is available online.\nHartford's cuisine was shaped by its early settlers, who brought Dutch and English influence that combined with that of the Saukiog Native Americans in the area. The first half of the 20th century brought significant Polish immigration and a number of Polish restaurants, some of which still operate today. Italian food wasn't always accepted; a long-time Hartford restaurant owner recollected that, \"in 1938, you wouldn't put an Italian name on a restaurant sign because everyone would think you were associated with the Mafia.\" The \"New York Times\" remarked on the diversity of food available in Hartford in 1979, noting that \"Hartford has undergone a culinary revolution in recent years.\"\nHartford earned praise from Food and Wine as \"a foodie destination\". Food trucks are restricted to designated areas in the city, mostly along Bushnell Park in Downtown Hartford and at farmers' markets. Food can today be found throughout the city from a very wide variety of ethnic influence.\nHartford hosts a number of seasonal farmers' markets. The Hartford Regional Market is the largest market between New York City and Boston. In 2018, the Connecticut State Assembly voted to transfer ownership of the Regional Market to the Capital Region Development Authority, leaving its future somewhat uncertain.\nThe seashore is less than away and has played a large role in Hartford's food habits. Recently there has been an aquaculture boom in Long Island Sound, and as a result local kelp has started to appear on plates.

Nonetheless, his reputation was hurt by accusations of corruption. The city council, formally known as the \"Court of Common Council\", has nine members.\nIn Connecticut, there is no county-level executive or legislative government.

Connecticut municipalities provide nearly all local services such as fire and rescue, education, and snow removal.\nHartford passed an ordinance providing services to all residents regardless of their immigration in 2008. Said ordinance also prohibits police from detaining individuals based solely on their immigration status or inquiring as to their immigration status.

{"id": "53680", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53680", "title": "Strategy game", "text": "Type of game\nA strategy game or strategic game is a game in which the players' uncoerced, and often autonomous, decision-making skills have a high significance in determining the outcome. Almost all strategy games require internal decision tree-style thinking, and typically very high situational awareness.\nStrategy games are also seen as a descendant of war games, and define strategy in terms of the context of war, but this is more partial. A strategy game is a game that relies primarily on strategy, and when it comes to defining what strategy is, two factors need to be taken into account: its complexity and game-scale actions, such as each placement in the \"Total War\" video game series. The definition of a strategy game in its cultural context should be any game that belongs to a tradition that goes back to war games, contains more strategy than the average video game, contains certain gameplay conventions, and is represented by a particular community. Although war is dominant in strategy games, it is not the whole story.\nHistory.\nThe history of turn-based strategy games goes back to the times of ancient civilizations found in places such as Rome, Greece, Egypt, the Levant, and India. Many were played widely through their regions of origin, but only some are still played today.\nAccording to Thierry Depaulis, oldest strategy games would be the \"Greek game of polis (\u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2), which appears in the literature around 450 BCE, and the more or less contemporary Chinese game of weiqi (\u2018go\u2019), which, under the name of yi (\u5f08), is mentioned in Confucius\u2019s Analects (Lunyu) compiled between ca 470/50 and 280 BCE.\"\nThe Royal Game of Ur from c. 2500 BCE which often been called one of the oldest board games, likely had some strategy elements as well, although it is generally seen as a luck-based race game.\nOne of the earliest strategy games still played is mancala. Due to claims that some artifacts from c. 5000 BCE might be old mancala boards, it has been suggested that mancala may be the oldest known strategy game, but this claim has been disputed.\nAnother game that has stood the test of time is chess, believed to have originated in India around the sixth century CE. The game spread to the west by trade, but chess gained social status and permanence more strongly than many other games. Chess became a game of skill and tactics often forcing the players to think two or three moves ahead of their opponent just to keep up.\nTypes.\nAbstract strategy.\nIn abstract strategy games, the game is only loosely tied to a thematic concept, if at all. The rules do not attempt to simulate reality, but rather serve the internal logic of the game.\nA purist's definition of an abstract strategy game requires that it cannot have random elements or hidden information. This definition includes such games as chess and Go. However, many games are commonly classed as abstract strategy games which do not meet these criteria: games such as backgammon, Octiles, \"Can't Stop\", Sequence and Mentalis have all been described as \"abstract strategy\" games despite having a chance element. A smaller category of non-perfect abstract strategy games incorporate hidden information without using any random elements; for example, Stratego.\nTeam strategy.\nOne of the most focused team strategy games is contract bridge. This card game consists of two teams of two players, whose offensive and defensive skills are continually in flux as the game's dynamic progresses. Some argue that the benefits of playing this team strategy card game extend to those skills and strategies used in business and that the playing of these games helps to automate strategic awareness.\nEurogames.\nEurogames, or German-style boardgames, are a relatively new genre that sit between abstract strategy games and simulation games. They generally have simple rules, short to medium playing times, indirect player interaction and abstract physical components. The games emphasize strategy, play down chance and conflict, lean towards economic rather than military themes, and usually keep all the players in the game until it ends.\nSimulation.\nThis type of game is an attempt to simulate the decisions and processes inherent to some real-world situation. Most of the rules are chosen to reflect what the real-world consequences would be of each player's actions and decisions. \nAbstract games cannot be completely divided from simulations and so games can be thought of as existing on a continuum of almost pure abstraction (like \"Abalone\") to almost pure simulation (like \"Diceball!\" or \"Strat-o-Matic Baseball\").\nWargame.\nWargames are simulations of military battles, campaigns, or entire wars. Players will have to consider situations that are analogous to the situations faced by leaders of historical battles. As such, wargames are usually heavy on simulation elements, and while they are all \"strategy games\", they can also be \"strategic\" or \"tactical\" in the military jargon sense. Its creator, H. G. Wells, stated how \"much better is this amiable miniature [war] than the real thing\".\nTraditionally, wargames have been played either with miniatures, using physical models of detailed terrain and miniature representations of people and equipment to depict the game state; or on a board, which commonly uses cardboard counters on a hex map.\nPopular miniature wargames include \"Warhammer 40,000\" or its fantasy counterpart \"Warhammer Fantasy\". Popular strategic board wargames include \"Risk\", \"Axis and Allies\", \"Diplomacy\", and \"Paths of Glory\". \"Advanced Squad Leader\" is a successful tactical scale wargame.\nIt is instructive to compare the \"Total War\" series to the \"Civilization\" series, where moving troops to a specific tile is a tactic because there are no short-range decisions. But in \"Empire: Total War (2009)\", every encounter between two armies activates a real-time mode in which they must fight and the same movement of troops is treated as a strategy. Throughout the game, the movement of each army is at a macro scale, because the player can control each battle at a micro scale. However, as an experience, the two types of military operations are quite similar and involve similar skills and thought processes. The concept of micro scale and macro scale can well describe the gameplay of a game; however, even very similar games can be difficult to integrate into a common vocabulary. In this definition, strategy does not explicitly describe the player's experience; it is more appropriate to describe different formal game components. The similarity of the actions taken in two different games does not affect our definition of them as strategy or tactics: we will only rely on their scale in their respective games.\nStrategy video games.\nStrategy video games are categorized based on whether they offer the continuous gameplay of real-time strategy (RTS), or the discrete phases of turn-based strategy (TBS). Often the computer is expected to emulate a strategically thinking \"side\" similar to that of a human player (such as directing armies and constructing buildings), or emulate the \"instinctive\" actions of individual units that would be too tedious for a player to administer (such as for a peasant to run away when attacked, as opposed to standing still until otherwise ordered by the player); hence there is an emphasis on artificial intelligence.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It involves the design and execution of lettering with a pen, ink brush, or other writing instruments. Contemporary calligraphic practice is often defined as \"the art of giving form to signs in an expressive, harmonious, and skillful manner\".\nIn East Asia and the Islamic world, calligraphy is a highly respected art form. Its visual form is often influenced by the meaning of the text or the individual words.\nModern Western calligraphy encompasses a wide range of styles, from functional inscriptions and designs to fine-art pieces where the legibility of letters varies. Classical calligraphy differs from type design and non-classical hand-lettering, though some calligraphers may practice both.\nWestern calligraphy is used in wedding invitations and other announcements, font design and typography, hand-lettered logo design, religious art, graphic design and commissioned calligraphic art, carved stone inscriptions, and memorial documents. It is also used for theatrical props, moving images for film and television, testimonials, birth and death certificates, maps, and other written works.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTools.\nPens and brushes.\nThe principal tools for a calligrapher are the pen and the brush. The pens used in calligraphy can have nibs that may be flat, round, or pointed. For decorative purposes, multi-nib pens (steel brushes) can be used. Works have also been created with felt-tip and ballpoint pens; however, these do not produce angled lines. There are certain styles of calligraphy, such as Gothic script, that require a stub nib pen. In Asia, a \"makta,\" or penknife, is used to cut a reed pen, the preferred tool for calligraphers. This method is preferred in Asia due to the wider range of motion allowed by the natural reeds in comparison to a metallic pen.\nCommon calligraphy pens and brushes include:\nInks, papers, and templates.\nThe ink used for writing is usually water-based and is much less viscous than the oil-based ink used in printing. Certain specialty paper with high ink absorption and constant texture enables cleaner lines, although parchment or vellum is often used, as a knife can be used to erase imperfections and a light-box is not needed to allow lines to be visible through it. Normally, light boxes and templates are used to achieve straight lines without pencil markings detracting from the work. Ruled paper, either for a light box or direct use, is most often ruled every quarter or half an inch, although inch spaces are occasionally used. This is the case with Uncial script (hence the name \"\", which roughly translates to 'inch high letters'), and college-ruled paper often acts as a guideline.\nEast Asia.\nChinese calligraphy is locally known as ' or ' ( or in traditional Chinese, literally 'the method or law of writing'); Japanese calligraphy is called ' (, literally 'the way or principle of writing'); and Korean calligraphy is referred to as ' (Korean:\u00a0; Hanja:\u00a0; literally 'the art of writing'); the calligraphy of East Asian characters remains an important and highly regarded aspect of contemporary traditional East Asian culture.\nHistory.\nIn ancient China, the oldest known Chinese characters are oracle bone script (), carved on ox scapulae and tortoise plastrons, as the rulers in the Shang dynasty carved pits on such animals' bones and then baked them to gain insight into military affairs, agricultural harvest, or even procreation and weather, as a form of scapulimancy. During the divination ceremony, a heat source was applied to the carved pits, causing the bones to crack, after which they were interpreted, the interpretation being carved directly on the shell or bone, sometimes after the characters were written with a brush. With the development of the bronzeware script () and large seal script () \"cursive\" signs continued. Mao Gong ding is one of the most famous examples of bronzeware script in Chinese calligraphic history. It contains 500 inscribed characters, the largest number of bronze inscriptions discovered to date. Moreover, each archaic kingdom of current China had its own set of characters.\nIn Imperial China, the graphs on old steles\u00a0\u2013 some dating from 200 BCE, and in the small seal script ( ) style\u00a0\u2013 have been preserved and can be viewed in museums.\nAbout 220 BCE, the emperor Qin Shi Huang, the first to conquer the entire Chinese basin, imposed several reforms, among them Li Si's character unification, which created a set of 3300 standardized small seal characters. Despite the fact that the main writing implement of the time was already the brush, few papers survive from this period, and the main examples of this style are on steles.\nThe clerical script (/) () which was more regularized, and in some ways similar to modern text, was also authorised under Qin Shi Huang.\nBetween clerical script and traditional regular script, there is another transitional type of calligraphic work called Wei Bei. It started during the North and South dynasties (420 to 589 CE) and ended before the Tang dynasty (618\u2013907).\nThe traditional regular script (), still in use today, and largely finalized by Zhong You (, 151\u2013230) and his followers, is even more regularized. Its spread was encouraged by Emperor Mingzong of Later Tang (926\u2013933), who ordered the printing of the classics using new wooden blocks in kaishu. Printing technologies encouraged shape stabilization. The kaishu shape of characters 1000 years ago was mostly similar to that at the end of Imperial China; However, small changes to the characters have been made. For example, the shape of has changed from the version in the \"Kangxi Dictionary\" of 1716 to the version found in modern books. The \"Kangxi\" and current shapes have tiny differences, while stroke order remains the same, according to the old style.\nStyles which did not survive include , a mix of 80% small seal script and 20% clerical script. Some variant Chinese characters were unorthodox or locally used for centuries. They were generally understood but always rejected in official texts. Some of these unorthodox variants, in addition to some newly created characters, compose the simplified Chinese character set.\nTechnique.\nTraditional East Asian writing uses the Four Treasures of the Study\u00a0\u2013 ink brushes known as (/), Chinese ink, paper, and inkstones\u00a0\u2013 to write Chinese characters. These instruments of writing are also known as the \"Four Friends of the Study\" () in Korea. Besides the traditional four tools, desk pads and paperweights are also used.\nMany different parameters influence the final result of a calligrapher's work. Physical parameters include the shape, size, stretch, and hair type of the ink brush; the color, color density and water density of the ink; as well as the paper's water absorption speed and surface texture. The calligrapher's technique also influences the result, as the look of finished characters is affected by the amount of ink and water the brush absorbs and by the brush's pressure, angle, and direction. Changing these variables produces thinner or bolder strokes, and smooth or toothed borders. Eventually, the speed, accelerations and decelerations of a skilled calligrapher's movements aim to give \"spirit\" to the characters, greatly influencing their final shapes.\nStyles.\nCursive styles such as ' (/)(semi-cursive or running script) and ' (/) (cursive, rough script, or grass script) are less constrained and faster, where movements made by the writing implement are more visible. These styles' stroke orders vary more, sometimes creating radically different forms. They descend from the clerical script, in the same time as the regular script (Han dynasty), but ' and ' were used for personal notes only, and not used as a standard. The \"\" style was highly appreciated during Emperor Wu of Han's reign (140\u2013187 CE).\nExamples of modern printed styles are Song from the Song dynasty's printing press, and sans-serif. These are not considered traditional styles, and are normally not written.\nInfluences.\nJapanese, Korean and Vietnamese calligraphy were each influenced by Chinese calligraphy. Calligraphy has influenced most major art styles in East Asia, including ink and wash painting, a style of Chinese, Japanese, and Korean painting based entirely on calligraphy and which uses similar tools and techniques.\nJapanese, Koreans and Vietnamese have also developed their own specific sensibilities and styles of calligraphy while incorporating Chinese influences.\nJapan.\nJapanese calligraphy goes out of the set of CJK strokes to also include local alphabets such as hiragana and katakana, with specific problematics such as new curves and moves, and specific materials (Japanese paper, , and Japanese ink).\nVietnam.\nVietnamese calligraphy is called (&lt;templatestyles src=\"vi-nom/fonts.css\" /&gt;\u66f8\u6cd5, literally \"the way of letters or words\") and is based on Ch\u1eef N\u00f4m and Ch\u1eef H\u00e1n, the historical Vietnamese writing system rooted in the impact of Chinese characters and replaced with the Latin alphabet as a result of French colonial influence. Calligraphic traditions maintaining the historical employment of Han characters continue to be preserved in modern Vietnamese calligraphy.\nKorea.\nThe modern Korean alphabet and its use of the circle required the creation of a new technique not used in traditional Chinese calligraphy.\nMongolia.\nMongolian calligraphy is also influenced by Chinese calligraphy, from tools to style.\nTibet.\nTibetan calligraphy is central to Tibetan culture. The script is derived from Indic scripts. The nobles of Tibet, such as the High Lamas and inhabitants of the Potala Palace, were often capable calligraphers. Tibet has been a center of Buddhism for several centuries, with said religion placing a high significance on the written word. This does not provide for a large body of secular pieces, although they do exist (but are usually related in some way to Tibetan Buddhism). Almost all high religious writing involved calligraphy, including letters sent by the Dalai Lama and other religious and secular authorities. Calligraphy is particularly evident on their prayer wheels, although this calligraphy was forged rather than scribed, much like Arab and Roman calligraphy is often found on buildings. Although originally done with a reed, Tibetan calligraphers now use chisel tipped pens and markers as well.\nSoutheast Asia.\nPhilippines.\nThe Philippines has numerous ancient and indigenous scripts collectively called Suyat scripts. Various ethno-linguistic groups in the Philippines prior to Spanish colonization in the 16th century and up to the independence era in the 21st century have used the scripts with various media. By the end of the colonial period, only four suyat scripts had survived and remained in everyday use by certain communities. These four scripts are Hanun\u00f3'o/Hanunoo of the Hanuno'o Mangyan people, Buhid/Build of the Buhid Mangyan people, Tagbanwa script of the Tagbanwa people, and Palaw'an/Pala'wan of the Palaw'an people. All four scripts were inscribed in the UNESCO Memory of the World international register, under the name \"Philippine Paleographs (Hanunoo, Build, Tagbanua and Pala\u2019wan)\", in 1999.\nDue to dissent from colonialism, many artists and cultural experts have revived the usage of suyat scripts that went extinct due their replacement by the Spanish-introduced Latin alphabet. The scripts being revived include the Kulitan script of the Kapampangan people, the badlit script of various Visayan ethnic groups, the Iniskaya script of the Eskaya people, the Baybayin script of the Tagalog people, and the Kur-itan script of the Ilocano people, among many others. Due to the diversity of suyat scripts, all calligraphy written in suyat script are collectively called Filipino suyat calligraphy, although each are distinct from each other. Calligraphy using the Western alphabet and the Arabic alphabet are also prevalent in the Philippines due to its colonial past. However, the Western and Arabic alphabets are not considered suyat, and therefore such calligraphy is not considered suyat calligraphy.\nSouth Asia.\nThe preservation of religious texts is the most common purpose for Indian calligraphy. Monastic Buddhist communities had members trained in calligraphy and shared responsibility for duplicating sacred scriptures. Jaina traders incorporated illustrated manuscripts celebrating Jaina saints. These manuscripts were produced using inexpensive material, like palm leaves and birch, with fine calligraphy.\nNepal.\nNepalese calligraphy is primarily created using the Ranjana script. The script itself, along with its derivatives (like Lantsa, Phagpa, Kutila) are used in Nepal, Tibet, Bhutan, Leh, Mongolia, coastal Japan, and Korea to write \"Om mani padme hum\" and other sacred Buddhist texts, mainly those derived from Sanskrit and Pali.\nAfrica.\nEgypt.\nEgyptian hieroglyphs were the formal writing system used in Ancient Egypt. Hieroglyphs combined logographic, syllabic and alphabetic elements, with a total of some 1,000 distinct characters.\nEthiopia.\nEthiopian (Abyssinian) calligraphy began with the Ge'ez script, which replaced Epigraphic South Arabian in the Kingdom of Aksum, which was developed specifically for Ethiopian Semitic languages. In those languages that use it, such as Amharic and Tigrinya, the script is called , which means 'script' or 'alphabet'. The Epigraphic South Arabian letters were used for a few inscriptions into the 8th century, though not in any South Arabian language since D\u02bfmt.\nEarly inscriptions in Ge'ez and Ge'ez script are dated to as early as the 5th century BCE, with a sort of proto-Ge'ez written in ESA since the 9th century BCE. Ge'ez literature begins with the Christianization of Ethiopia (and the civilization of Axum) in the 4th century, during the reign of Ezana of Axum.\nThe Ge'ez script is read from left to right and has been adapted to write other languages, usually ones that are also Semitic. The most widespread use is for Amharic in Ethiopia and Tigrinya in Eritrea and Ethiopia.\nAmericas.\nMaya.\nMaya calligraphy was expressed via Maya glyphs; modern Maya calligraphy is mainly used on seals and monuments in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula in Mexico. Maya glyphs are rarely used in government offices; however, in Campeche, Yucat\u00e1n and Quintana Roo, calligraphy in Maya languages is written in Latin script rather than Maya glyphs. Some commercial companies in southern Mexico use Maya glyphs as symbols of their business. Some community associations and modern Maya brotherhoods use Maya glyphs as symbols of their groups.\nMost of the archaeological sites in Mexico such as Chichen Itza, Labna, Uxmal, Edzna, Calakmul, etc. have glyphs in their structures. Carved stone monuments known as stele are common sources of ancient Maya calligraphy.\nEurope.\nCalligraphy in Europe is recognizable in the use of the Latin script in Western Europe, and in the use of the Greek, Armenian, Georgian, and Cyrillic scripts in Eastern Europe.\nAncient Rome.\nThe Latin alphabet appeared about 600 BCE in ancient Rome, and by the first century CE it had developed into Roman imperial capitals carved on stones, rustic capitals painted on walls, and Roman cursive for daily use. In the second and third centuries the uncial lettering style developed. As writing withdrew to monasteries, uncial script was found more suitable for copying the Bible and other religious texts. It was the monasteries which preserved calligraphic traditions during the fourth and fifth centuries, when the Roman Empire fell and Europe entered the early Middle Ages.\nAt the height of the Roman Empire, its power reached as far as Great Britain; when the empire fell, its literary influence remained. The Semi-uncial generated the Irish Semi-uncial, the small Anglo-Saxon. Each region developed its own standards following the main monastery of the region (i.e. Merovingian script, Laon script, Luxeuil script, Visigothic script, Beneventan script),which are mostly cursive.\nWestern Christendom.\nChristian churches promoted the development of writing through the prolific copying of the Bible, the Breviary, and other sacred texts. Two distinct styles of writing known as uncial and half-uncial (from the Latin , or \"inch\") developed from a variety of Roman bookhands. The 7th\u20139th centuries in northern Europe were the heyday of Celtic illuminated manuscripts, such as the Book of Durrow, Lindisfarne Gospels and the Book of Kells.\nCharlemagne's devotion to improved scholarship resulted in recruiting \"a crowd of scribes\", according to Alcuin, the Abbot of York. Alcuin developed the style known as the Caroline or Carolingian minuscule. The first manuscript in this hand was the Godescalc Evangelistary (finished 783)\u00a0\u2013 a Gospel book written by the scribe Godescalc. Carolingian remains the one progenitor hand from which modern booktype descends.\nIn the eleventh century, the Caroline evolved into the blackletter (\"Gothic\") script, which was more compact and made it possible to fit more text on a page. The Gothic calligraphy styles became dominant throughout Europe and, in 1454, when Johannes Gutenberg developed the first printing press in Mainz, Germany, the Gothic style was adopted for its use, making it the first typeface. \nIn the 15th century, the rediscovery of old Carolingian texts encouraged the creation of the humanist minuscule or . The 17th century saw the Batarde script from France, and the 18th century saw the English script spread across Europe and the world through books.\nIn the mid-1600s French officials, flooded with documents written in various hands and varied levels of skill, complained that many such documents were beyond their ability to decipher. The Office of the Financier thereupon restricted all legal documents to three hands, namely the Coulee, the Rhonde, (known as Round hand in English) and a Speed Hand sometimes called the Bastarda.\nWhile there were many great French masters at the time, the most influential in proposing these hands was Louis Barbedor, who published \"Les Ecritures Financi\u00e8re Et Italienne Bastarde Dans Leur Naturel,\" c.\u20091650.\nWith the destruction of the during the sack of Rome (1527), the capital for writing masters moved to Southern France. By 1600, the Italic Cursiva began to be replaced by a technological refinement, the Italic Chancery Circumflessa, which in turn fathered the Rhonde and later English Roundhand.\nIn England, Ayres and Banson popularized the Round Hand while Snell is noted for his reaction to them, and warnings of restraint and proportionality. Still Edward Crocker began publishing his copybooks 40 years before the aforementioned.\nEastern Europe.\nOther European styles use the same tools and practices, but differ by character set and stylistic preferences.\nFor Slavonic lettering, the history of the Slavonic and consequently Russian writing systems differs fundamentally from that of the Latin language, having evolved from the 10th century to today.\nStyle.\nUnlike a typeface, handwritten calligraphy is characterised by irregularity in the characters which vary in size, shape, style, and color, producing a distinct aesthetic value, although it may also make the content more difficult to decode for some readers. As with Chinese or Islamic calligraphy, Western calligraphic script employed the use of strict rules and shapes. Quality writing had a rhythm and regularity to the letters, with a \"geometrical\" order of the lines on the page. Each character had, and often still has, a precise stroke order.\nUnique features of sacred Western calligraphy include the illumination of the first letter of each book or chapter in medieval times. A decorative \"carpet page\" may precede the literature, filled with ornate, geometrical depictions of bold-hued animals. The Lindisfarne Gospels (715\u2013720 CE) are an early example. Many of the themes and variations of today's contemporary Western calligraphy are found in the pages of The Saint John's Bible. A particularly modern example is Timothy Botts' illustrated edition of the Bible, with 360 calligraphic images as well as a calligraphy typeface.\nIslamic world.\nIslamic calligraphy has evolved alongside Islam and the Arabic language. As it is based on Arabic letters, some call it \"Arabic calligraphy\". However the term \"Islamic calligraphy\" is a more appropriate term, as it comprises all works of calligraphy by Muslim calligraphers of different national cultures, such as Persian or Ottoman calligraphy, from Al-Andalus in medieval Spain to China.\nIslamic calligraphy is associated with geometric Islamic art (Arabesque) on the walls and ceilings of mosques, as well as on manuscript pages or other materials. Contemporary artists in the Islamic world may draw on the heritage of calligraphy to create modern calligraphic inscriptions, like corporate logos or abstractions.\nInstead of recalling something related to the spoken word, calligraphy for Muslims is a visible expression of the highest art of all, the art of the spiritual world. Calligraphy has arguably become the most venerated form of Islamic art because it provides a link between the languages of the Muslims with the religion of Islam. The Qur'an has played an important role in the development and evolution of the Arabic language, and by extension, calligraphy in the Arabic alphabet. Proverbs and passages from the Qur'an continue to be sources for Islamic calligraphy.\nDuring the Ottoman civilization, Islamic calligraphy attained special prominence. The city of Istanbul is an open exhibition hall for many kinds and varieties of calligraphy, from inscriptions in mosques to fountains, schools, houses, etc.\nAntiquity.\nAncient Persian script was invented by about 600\u2013500 BCE to provide monument inscriptions for the Achaemenid kings. These scripts consisted of horizontal, vertical, and diagonal nail-shape letters, which is why it is called cuneiform script (lit. \"script of nails\") (\"\") in Persian. Centuries later, other scripts such as \"Pahlavi\" and \"Avestan\" scripts were used in ancient Persia. Pahlavi was a middle Persian script developed from the Aramaic script and became the official script of the Sassanian empire (224\u2013651 CE).\nContemporary scripts.\nThe Nasta'liq style is the most popular contemporary style among classical Persian calligraphy scripts; Persian calligraphers call it the \"bride of calligraphy scripts.\" It has just been fine-tuned during the past seven centuries. It has strict rules for graphical shape of the letters and for combination of the letters, words, and composition of the whole calligraphy piece.\nModern calligraphy.\nRevival.\nAfter printing became ubiquitous from the 15th century onward, the production of illuminated manuscripts began to decline. However, the rise of printing did not mean the end of calligraphy. A clear distinction between handwriting and more elaborate forms of lettering and script began to make its way into manuscripts and books at the beginning of the 16th century.\nThe modern revival of calligraphy began at the end of the 19th century, influenced by the aesthetics and philosophy of William Morris and the Arts and Crafts movement. Edward Johnston is regarded as being the father of modern calligraphy. After studying published copies of manuscripts by architect William Harrison Cowlishaw, he was introduced to William Lethaby in 1898, principal of the Central School of Arts and Crafts, who advised him to study manuscripts at the British Museum.\nThis triggered Johnston's interest in the art of calligraphy with the use of a broad-edged pen. He began a teaching course in calligraphy at the Central School in Southampton Row, London from September 1899, where he influenced the typeface designer and sculptor Eric Gill. He was commissioned by Frank Pick to design a new typeface for the London Underground, still used today (with minor modifications).\nHe has been credited for single-handedly reviving the art of modern penmanship and lettering through his books and teachings\u00a0\u2013 his handbook on the subject, \"Writing &amp; Illuminating, &amp; Lettering\" (1906) was particularly influential on a generation of British typographers and calligraphers, including Graily Hewitt, Stanley Morison, Eric Gill, Alfred Fairbank and Anna Simons. Johnston also devised the crafted round calligraphic handwriting style, written with a broad pen, known today as the \"Foundational hand\". Johnston initially taught his students an uncial hand using a flat pen angle, but later taught his hand using a slanted pen angle. He first referred to this hand as \"Foundational Hand\" in his 1909 publication, \"Manuscript &amp; Inscription Letters for Schools and Classes and for the Use of Craftsmen\".\nSubsequent developments.\nGraily Hewitt taught at the Central School of Arts and Crafts and, together with Johnston, published throughout the early part of the century. Hewitt played a major role to the revival of gilding in calligraphy, and his prolific output on type design also appeared between 1915 and 1943. He is attributed with the revival of gilding with gesso and gold leaf on vellum. Hewitt helped found the Society of Scribes &amp; Illuminators (SSI) in 1921.\nHewitt has received both criticism and support in his rendering of Cennino Cennini's medieval gesso recipes. Donald Jackson, a British calligrapher, has sourced his gesso recipes from earlier centuries, a number of which are not presently in English translation. Graily Hewitt created the patent announcing the award to Prince Philip of the title of Duke of Edinburgh on November 19, 1947, the day before his marriage to Queen Elizabeth.\nAnna Simons, Johnston's pupil, helped create interest in calligraphy in Germany with her German translation of \"Writing and Illuminating, and Lettering\" in 1910. Austrian Rudolf Larisch, a teacher of lettering at the Vienna School of Art, published six lettering books that influenced German-speaking calligraphers. Because German-speaking countries had not abandoned the Gothic hand in printing, Gothic also had an effect on their styles.\nRudolf Koch was a friend and younger contemporary of Larisch. Koch's books, type designs, and teaching impacted calligraphy in northern Europe, and later, the United States. Larisch and Koch taught many European calligraphers, notably Karlgeorg Hoefer and Hermann Zapf.\nContemporary typefaces used by computers, from word processors like Microsoft Word or Apple Pages to professional design software packages like Adobe InDesign, find their roots in both the calligraphy of the past as well as several professional typeface designers.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In explosions, it is initially present in the radioactive cloud created by the explosion, and \"falls out\" of the cloud as it is moved by the atmosphere in the minutes, hours, and days after the explosion. The amount of fallout and its distribution is dependent on several factors, including the overall yield of the weapon, the fission yield of the weapon, the height of burst of the weapon, and meteorological conditions. \nFission weapons and many thermonuclear weapons use a large mass of fissionable fuel (such as uranium or plutonium), so their fallout is primarily fission products, and some unfissioned fuel. Cleaner thermonuclear weapons primarily produce fallout via neutron activation. Salted bombs, not widely developed, are tailored to produce and disperse specific radioisotopes selected for their half-life and radiation type.\nFallout also arises from nuclear accidents, such as those involving nuclear reactors or nuclear waste, typically dispersing fission products in the atmosphere or water systems.\nFallout can have serious human health consequences on both short- and long-term time scales, and can cause radioactive contamination far away from the areas impacted by the more immediate effects of nuclear weapons. Atmospheric and underwater nuclear weapons testing, which widely disperses fallout, was ceased by the United States, Soviet Union, and United Kingdom following the 1963 Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Underground testing, which can sometimes causes fallout via venting, was largely ceased following the 1996 Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. The bomb pulse, the increase in global carbon-14 formed from neutron activation of nitrogen in air, is predicted to dominate long-term effects on humans from nuclear testing, causing ill effects and death in a small fraction of the population for up to 8,000 years.\nTypes of fallout.\nFallout is usually divided into two major types, largely determined by the height of burst of the detonation. If detonated at a sufficient altitude that allows the fireball to avoid mixing significantly with ground debris, the radioactive byproducts in the fallout will generally stay aloft longer than weapons detonated at or near the surface. This additional time aloft allows the most acutely dangerous radioactive elements, with the shortest half-lives, to decay prior to their descending to the surface, reducing the overall radioactive intensity of the fallout which is deposited. This additional time also allows the radioactive cloud to diffuse over a larger area, resulting in less radioactive debris per area of land below. This more diffuse form of fallout is known as \"global fallout,\" because its main effect is to raise background radiation exposure slightly over vast areas, and is contrasted with \"local fallout,\" which produces a plume of concentrated radioactive byproducts downwind of the detonation within minutes or hours. \nMeteorological realities can complicate these distinctions; \"rainout,\" for example, can occur when atmospheric conditions cause precipitation from a nuclear cloud. A nuclear detonation underwater also produces a different local fallout than one on land. There have also been weapons detonated below the threshold for avoiding local fallout but which have not done so; the 50 megaton Tsar Bomba test in 1961, for example, had its fireball buoyantly boosted upwards by its reflected shockwave, preventing its mixture.\nGlobal fallout.\nAfter the detonation of a weapon at or above the fallout-free altitude (an \"air burst\"), fission products, un-fissioned nuclear material, and weapon residues vaporized by the heat of the fireball condense into a suspension of particles 10\u00a0nm to 20\u00a0\u03bcm in diameter. This size of particulate matter, lifted to the stratosphere, may take months or years to settle, and may do so anywhere in the world. Its radioactive characteristics increase the statistical cancer risk, with up to 2.4 million people having died by 2020 from the measurable elevated atmospheric radioactivity after the widespread nuclear weapons testing of the 1950s, peaking in 1963 (the Bomb pulse). Levels reached about 0.15\u00a0mSv per year worldwide, or about 7% of average background radiation dose from all sources, and has slowly decreased since, with natural background radiation levels being around 1 mSv. \nRadioactive fallout has occurred around the world; for example, people have been exposed to iodine-131 from atmospheric nuclear testing. Fallout accumulates on vegetation, including fruits and vegetables. Starting from 1951 people may have gotten exposure, depending on whether they were outside, the weather, and whether they consumed contaminated milk, vegetables or fruit. Exposure can be on an intermediate time scale or long term. The intermediate time scale results from fallout that has been put into the troposphere and ejected by precipitation during the first month. Long-term fallout can sometimes occur from deposition of tiny particles carried in the stratosphere. By the time that stratospheric fallout has begun to reach the earth, the radioactivity is very much decreased. Also, after a year it is estimated that a sizable quantity of fission products move from the northern to the southern stratosphere. The intermediate time scale is between 1 and 30 days, with long term fallout occurring after that.\nExamples of both intermediate and long term fallout occurred after the 1986 Chernobyl accident, which contaminated over of land in Ukraine and Belarus. The main fuel of the reactor was uranium, and surrounding this was graphite, both of which were vaporized by the hydrogen explosion that destroyed the reactor and breached its containment. An estimated 31 people died within a few weeks after this happened, including two plant workers killed at the scene. Although residents were evacuated within 36 hours, people started to complain of vomiting, migraines and other major signs of radiation sickness. The officials of Ukraine had to close off an area with an radius. Long term effects included at least 6,000 cases of thyroid cancer, mainly among children. Fallout spread throughout Europe, with Northern Scandinavia receiving a heavy dose, contaminating reindeer herds in Lapland, and salad greens becoming almost unavailable in France. Some sheep farms in North Wales and the North Of England were required to monitor radioactivity levels in their flocks until the control was lifted in 2012.\nLocal fallout.\nDuring detonations of devices at ground level (\"surface burst\"), below the fallout-free altitude, or in shallow water, heat vaporizes large amounts of earth or water, which is drawn up into the radioactive cloud. This material becomes radioactive when it combines with fission products or other radio-contaminants, or when it is neutron-activated.\nThe table below summarizes the abilities of common isotopes to form fallout. Some radiation taints large amounts of land and drinking water causing formal mutations throughout animal and human life.\nA surface burst generates large amounts of particulate matter, composed of particles from less than 100 nm to several millimeters in diameter\u2014in addition to very fine particles that contribute to worldwide fallout. The larger particles spill out of the stem and cascade down the outside of the fireball in a downdraft even as the cloud rises, so fallout begins to arrive near ground zero within an hour. More than half the total bomb debris lands on the ground within about 24 hours as local fallout. Chemical properties of the elements in the fallout control the rate at which they are deposited on the ground. Less volatile elements deposit first.\nSevere local fallout contamination can extend far beyond the blast and thermal effects, particularly in the case of high yield surface detonations. The ground track of fallout from an explosion depends on the weather from the time of detonation onward. In stronger winds, fallout travels faster but takes the same time to descend, so although it covers a larger path, it is more spread out or diluted. Thus, the width of the fallout pattern for any given dose rate is reduced where the downwind distance is increased by higher winds. The total amount of activity deposited up to any given time is the same irrespective of the wind pattern, so overall casualty figures from fallout are generally independent of winds. But thunderstorms can bring down activity as rain allows fallout to drop more rapidly, particularly if the mushroom cloud is low enough to be below (\"washout\"), or mixed with (\"rainout\"), the thunderstorm.\nWhenever individuals remain in a radiologically contaminated area, such contamination leads to an immediate external radiation exposure as well as a possible later internal hazard from inhalation and ingestion of radiocontaminants, such as the rather short-lived iodine-131, which is accumulated in the thyroid.\nFactors affecting fallout.\nLocation.\nThere are two main considerations for the location of an explosion: height and surface composition. A nuclear weapon detonated in the air, called an air burst, produces less fallout than a comparable explosion near the ground. A nuclear explosion in which the fireball touches the ground pulls soil and other materials into the cloud and neutron activates it before it falls back to the ground. An air burst produces a relatively small amount of the highly radioactive heavy metal components of the device itself.\nIn case of water surface bursts, the particles tend to be rather lighter and smaller, producing less local fallout but extending over a greater area. The particles contain mostly sea salts with some water; these can have a cloud seeding effect causing local rainout and areas of high local fallout. Fallout from a seawater burst is difficult to remove once it has soaked into porous surfaces because the fission products are present as metallic ions that chemically bond to many surfaces. Water and detergent washing effectively removes less than 50% of this chemically bonded activity from concrete or steel. Complete decontamination requires aggressive treatment like sandblasting, or acidic treatment. After the \"Crossroads\" underwater test, it was found that wet fallout must be immediately removed from ships by continuous water washdown (such as from the fire sprinkler system on the decks).\nParts of the sea bottom may become fallout. After the Castle Bravo test, white dust\u2014contaminated calcium oxide particles originating from pulverized and calcined corals\u2014fell for several hours, causing beta burns and radiation exposure to the inhabitants of the nearby atolls and the crew of the \"Daigo Fukury\u016b Maru\" fishing boat. The scientists called the fallout \"Bikini snow\".\nFor subsurface bursts, there is an additional phenomenon present called \"base surge\". The base surge is a cloud that rolls outward from the bottom of the subsiding column, which is caused by an excessive density of dust or water droplets in the air. For underwater bursts, the visible surge is, in effect, a cloud of liquid (usually water) droplets with the property of flowing almost as if it were a homogeneous fluid. After the water evaporates, an invisible base surge of small radioactive particles may persist.\nFor subsurface land bursts, the surge is made up of small solid particles, but it still behaves like a fluid. A soil earth medium favors base surge formation in an underground burst. Although the base surge typically contains only about 10% of the total bomb debris in a subsurface burst, it can create larger radiation doses than fallout near the detonation, because it arrives sooner than fallout, before much radioactive decay has occurred.\nMeteorological.\nMeteorological conditions greatly influence fallout, particularly local fallout. Atmospheric winds are able to bring fallout over large areas. For example, as a result of a \"Castle Bravo\" surface burst of a 15 Mt thermonuclear device at Bikini Atoll on 1 March 1954, a roughly cigar-shaped area of the Pacific extending over 500\u00a0km downwind and varying in width to a maximum of 100\u00a0km was severely contaminated. There are three very different versions of the fallout pattern from this test, because the fallout was measured only on a small number of widely spaced Pacific Atolls. The two alternative versions both ascribe the high radiation levels at north Rongelap to a downwind hot spot caused by the large amount of radioactivity carried on fallout particles of about 50\u2013100 micrometres size.\nAfter \"Bravo\", it was discovered that fallout landing on the ocean disperses in the top water layer (above the thermocline at 100 m depth), and the land equivalent dose rate can be calculated by multiplying the ocean dose rate at two days after burst by a factor of about 530. In other 1954 tests, including \"Yankee\" and \"Nectar,\" hot spots were mapped out by ships with submersible probes, and similar hot spots occurred in 1956 tests such as \"Zuni\" and \"Tewa\".\n However, the major U.S. \"DELFIC\" (Defence Land Fallout Interpretive Code) computer calculations use the natural size distributions of particles in soil instead of the afterwind sweep-up spectrum, and this results in more straightforward fallout patterns lacking the downwind hot spot.\nSnow and rain, especially if they come from considerable heights, accelerate local fallout. Under special meteorological conditions, such as a local rain shower that originates above the radioactive cloud, limited areas of heavy contamination just downwind of a nuclear blast may be formed.\nEffects.\nA wide range of biological changes may follow the irradiation of animals. These vary from rapid death following high doses of penetrating whole-body radiation, to essentially normal lives for a variable period of time until the development of delayed radiation effects, in a portion of the exposed population, following low dose exposures.\nThe unit of actual \"exposure\" is the r\u00f6ntgen, defined in ionisations per unit volume of air. All ionisation based instruments (including geiger counters and ionisation chambers) measure exposure. However, effects depend on the energy per unit mass, not the exposure measured in air. A deposit of 1 joule per kilogram has the unit of 1 gray (Gy). For 1 MeV energy gamma rays, an exposure of 1 r\u00f6ntgen in air produces a dose of about 0.01 gray (1 centigray, cGy) in water or surface tissue. Because of shielding by the tissue surrounding the bones, the bone marrow only receives about 0.67 cGy when the air exposure is 1 r\u00f6ntgen and the surface skin dose is 1 cGy. Some lower values reported for the amount of radiation that would kill 50% of personnel (the LD50) refer to bone marrow dose, which is only 67% of the air dose.\nShort term.\nThe dose that would be lethal to 50% of a population is a common parameter used to compare the effects of various fallout types or circumstances. Usually, the term is defined for a specific time, and limited to studies of acute lethality. The common time periods used are 30 days or less for most small laboratory animals and to 60 days for large animals and humans. The LD50 figure assumes that the individuals did not receive other injuries or medical treatment.\nIn the 1950s, the LD50 for gamma rays was set at 3.5 Gy, while under more dire conditions of war (a bad diet, little medical care, poor nursing) the LD50 was 2.5 Gy (250 rad). There have been few documented cases of survival beyond 6 Gy. One person at Chernobyl survived a dose of more than 10 Gy, but many of the persons exposed there were not uniformly exposed over their entire body. If a person is exposed in a non-homogeneous manner then a given dose (averaged over the entire body) is less likely to be lethal. For instance, if a person gets a hand/low arm dose of 100 Gy, which gives them an overall dose of 4 Gy, they are more likely to survive than a person who gets a 4 Gy dose over their entire body. A hand dose of 10 Gy or more would likely result in loss of the hand. A British industrial radiographer who was estimated to have received a hand dose of 100 Gy over the course of his lifetime lost his hand because of radiation dermatitis. Most people become ill after an exposure to 1 Gy or more. Fetuses are often more vulnerable to radiation and may miscarry, especially in the first trimester.\nBecause of the large amount of short-lived fission products, the activity and radiation levels of nuclear fallout decrease very quickly after being released; it is reduced by 50% in the first hour after a detonation, then by 80% during the first day. As a result, early gross decontamination, such as removing contaminated articles of outer clothing, is more effective than delayed but more thorough cleaning. Most areas become fairly safe for travel and decontamination after three to five weeks.\nOne hour after a surface burst, the radiation from fallout in the crater region is 30 grays per hour (Gy/h). Civilian dose rates in peacetime range from 30 to 100 \u03bcGy per year.\nFor yields of up to 10 kt, prompt radiation is the dominant producer of casualties on the battlefield. Humans receiving an acute incapacitating dose (30 Gy) have their performance degraded almost immediately and become ineffective within several hours. However, they do not die until five to six days after exposure, assuming they do not receive any other injuries. Individuals receiving less than a total of 1.5 Gy are not incapacitated. People receiving doses greater than 1.5 Gy become disabled, and some eventually die.\nA dose of 5.3 Gy to 8.3 Gy is considered lethal but not immediately incapacitating. Personnel exposed to this amount of radiation have their cognitive performance degraded in two to three hours, depending on how physically demanding the tasks they must perform are, and remain in this disabled state at least two days. However, at that point they experience a recovery period and can perform non-demanding tasks for about six days, after which they relapse for about four weeks. At this time they begin exhibiting symptoms of radiation poisoning of sufficient severity to render them totally ineffective. Death follows at approximately six weeks after exposure, although outcomes may vary.\nLong term.\nLate or delayed effects of radiation occur following a wide range of doses and dose rates. Delayed effects may appear months to years after irradiation and include a wide variety of effects involving almost all tissues or organs. Some of the \"possible\" delayed consequences of radiation injury, with the rates above the background prevalence, depending on the absorbed dose, include carcinogenesis, cataract formation, chronic radiodermatitis, decreased fertility, and genetic mutations.\nPresently, the only teratological effect observed in humans following nuclear attacks on highly populated areas is microcephaly which is the only proven malformation, or congenital abnormality, found in the in utero developing human fetuses present during the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings. Of all the pregnant women who were close enough to be exposed to the \"prompt\" burst of intense neutron and gamma doses in the two cities, the total number of children born with microcephaly was below 50. No statistically demonstrable increase of congenital malformations was found among the \"later conceived children\" born to survivors of the nuclear detonations at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The surviving women of Hiroshima and Nagasaki who could conceive and were exposed to substantial amounts of radiation went on and had children with no higher incidence of abnormalities than the Japanese average.\nThe Baby Tooth Survey founded by the husband and wife team of physicians Eric Reiss and Louise Reiss, was a research effort focused on detecting the presence of strontium-90, a cancer-causing radioactive isotope created by the more than 400 atomic tests conducted above ground that is absorbed from water and dairy products into the bones and teeth given its chemical similarity to calcium. The team sent collection forms to schools in the St. Louis, Missouri area, hoping to gather 50,000 teeth each year. Ultimately, the project collected over 300,000 teeth from children of various ages before the project was ended in 1970.\nPreliminary results of the Baby Tooth Survey were published in the 24 November 1961, edition of the journal \"Science\", and showed that levels of strontium-90 had risen steadily in children born in the 1950s, with those born later showing the most pronounced increases. The results of a more comprehensive study of the elements found in the teeth collected showed that children born after 1963 had levels of strontium-90 in their baby teeth that was 50 times higher than that found in children born before large-scale atomic testing began. The findings helped convince U.S. President John F. Kennedy to sign the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty with the United Kingdom and Soviet Union, which ended the above-ground nuclear weapons testing that created the greatest amounts of atmospheric nuclear fallout.\nSome considered the baby tooth survey a \"campaign [that] effectively employed a variety of media advocacy strategies\" to alarm the public and \"galvanized\" support against atmospheric nuclear testing, and putting an end to such testing was commonly viewed as a positive outcome for a myriad of reasons. The survey could not show at the time, nor in the decades that have elapsed, that the levels of global strontium-90 or fallout in general, were life-threatening, primarily because \"50 times the strontium-90 from \"before\" nuclear testing\" is a minuscule number, and multiplication of minuscule numbers results in only a slightly larger minuscule number. Moreover, the Radiation and Public Health Project that currently retains the teeth has had their stance and publications criticized: a 2003 article in \"The New York Times\" states that many scientists consider the group's work controversial, with little credibility with the scientific establishment, while some scientists consider it \"good, careful work\". In an April 2014 article in \"Popular Science\", Sarah Fecht argues that the group's work, specifically the widely discussed case of cherry-picking data to suggest that fallout from the 2011 Fukushima accident caused infant deaths in America, is \"junk science\", as despite their papers being peer-reviewed, independent attempts to corroborate their results return findings that are not in agreement with what the organization suggests. The organization had earlier suggested the same thing occurred after the 1979 Three Mile Island accident, though the Atomic Energy Commission argued this was unfounded. The tooth survey, and the organization's new target of pushing for test bans with US nuclear electric power stations, is detailed and critically labelled as the \"Tooth Fairy issue\" by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\nEffects on the environment.\nIn the event of a large-scale nuclear exchange, the effects would be drastic on the environment as well as directly to the human population. Within direct blast zones everything would be vaporized and destroyed. Cities damaged but not completely destroyed would lose their water system due to the loss of power and supply lines rupturing. Within the local nuclear fallout pattern suburban areas' water supplies would become extremely contaminated. At this point stored water would be the only safe water to use. All surface water within the fallout would be contaminated by falling fission products.\nWithin the first few months of the nuclear exchange the nuclear fallout will continue to develop and detriment the environment. Dust, smoke, and radioactive particles will fall hundreds of kilometers downwind of the explosion point and pollute surface water supplies. Iodine-131 would be the dominant fission product within the first few weeks, and in the months following the dominant fission product would be strontium-90. These fission products would remain in the fallout dust, resulting in rivers, lakes, sediments, and soils being contaminated with the fallout.\nRural areas' water supplies would be slightly less polluted by fission particles in intermediate and long-term fallout than cities and suburban areas. Without additional contamination, the lakes, reservoirs, rivers, and runoff would be gradually less contaminated as water continued to flow through its system.\nGroundwater supplies such as aquifers would however remain unpolluted initially in the event of a nuclear fallout. Over time the groundwater could become contaminated with fallout particles, and would remain contaminated for over 10 years after a nuclear engagement. It would take hundreds or thousands of years for an aquifer to become completely pure. Groundwater would still be safer than surface water supplies and would need to be consumed in smaller doses. Long term, cesium-137 and strontium-90 would be the major radionuclides affecting the fresh water supplies.\nThe dangers of nuclear fallout do not stop at increased risks of cancer and radiation sickness, but also include the presence of radionuclides in human organs from food. A fallout event would leave fission particles in the soil for animals to consume, followed by humans. Radioactively contaminated milk, meat, fish, vegetables, grains and other food would all be dangerous because of fallout.\nFrom 1945 to 1967 the U.S. conducted hundreds of nuclear weapon tests. Atmospheric testing took place over the US mainland during this time and as a consequence scientists have been able to study the effect of nuclear fallout on the environment. Detonations conducted near the surface of the earth irradiated thousands of tons of soil. Of the material drawn into the atmosphere, portions of radioactive material will be carried by low altitude winds and deposited in surrounding areas as radioactive dust. The material intercepted by high altitude winds will continue to travel. When a radiation cloud at high altitude is exposed to rainfall, the radioactive fallout will contaminate the downwind area below.\nAgricultural fields and plants will absorb the contaminated material and animals will consume the radioactive material. As a result, the nuclear fallout may cause livestock to become ill or die, and if consumed the radioactive material will be passed on to humans.\nThe damage to other living organism as a result to nuclear fallout depends on the species. Mammals particularly are extremely sensitive to nuclear radiation, followed by birds, plants, fish, reptiles, crustaceans, insects, moss, lichen, algae, bacteria, mollusks, and viruses.\nClimatologist Alan Robock and atmospheric and oceanic sciences professor Brian Toon created a model of a hypothetical small-scale nuclear war that would have approximately 100 weapons used. In this scenario, the fires would create enough soot into the atmosphere to block sunlight, lowering global temperatures by more than one degree Celsius. The result would have the potential of creating widespread food insecurity (nuclear famine). Precipitation across the globe would be disrupted as a result. If enough soot was introduced in the upper atmosphere the planet's ozone layer could potentially be depleted, affecting plant growth and human health.\nRadiation from the fallout would linger in soil, plants, and food chains for years. Marine food chains are more vulnerable to the nuclear fallout and the effects of soot in the atmosphere.\nFallout radionuclides' detriment in the human food chain is apparent in the lichen-caribou-eskimo studies in Alaska. The primary effect on humans observed was thyroid dysfunction. The result of a nuclear fallout is incredibly detrimental to human survival and the biosphere. Fallout alters the quality of our atmosphere, soil, and water and causes species to go extinct.\nFallout protection.\nDuring the Cold War, the governments of the U.S., the USSR, Great Britain, and China attempted to educate their citizens about surviving a nuclear attack by providing procedures on minimizing short-term exposure to fallout. This effort commonly became known as Civil Defense.\nFallout protection is almost exclusively concerned with protection from radiation. Radiation from a fallout is encountered in the forms of alpha, beta, and gamma radiation, and as ordinary clothing affords protection from alpha and beta radiation, most fallout protection measures deal with reducing exposure to gamma radiation. For the purposes of radiation shielding, many materials have a characteristic \"halving thickness\": the thickness of a layer of a material sufficient to reduce gamma radiation exposure by 50%. Halving thicknesses of common materials include: 1\u00a0cm (0.4\u00a0inch) of lead, 6\u00a0cm (2.4\u00a0inches) of concrete, 9\u00a0cm (3.6\u00a0inches) of packed earth or 150\u00a0m (500\u00a0ft) of air. When multiple thicknesses are built, the shielding multiplies. A practical fallout shield is ten halving-thicknesses of a given material, such as 90\u00a0cm (36\u00a0inches) of packed earth, which reduces gamma ray exposure by approximately 1024 times (210). A shelter built with these materials for the purposes of fallout protection is known as a fallout shelter.\nPersonal protective equipment.\nAs the nuclear energy sector continues to grow, the international rhetoric surrounding nuclear warfare intensifies, and the ever-present threat of radioactive materials falling into the hands of dangerous people persists, many scientists are working hard to find the best way to protect human organs from the harmful effects of high energy radiation. Acute radiation syndrome (ARS) is the most immediate risk to humans when exposed to ionizing radiation in dosages greater than around 0.1\u00a0Gy/hr. Radiation in the low energy spectrum (alpha and beta radiation) with minimal penetrating power is unlikely to cause significant damage to internal organs (although if contamination is ingested, inhaled or on the skin, and thus in close proximity to tissues and organs, the effect of these 'massive' particles may be catastrophic). The high penetrating power of gamma and neutron radiation, however, easily penetrates the skin and many thin shielding mechanisms to cause cellular degeneration in the stem cells found in bone marrow. While full body shielding in a secure fallout shelter as described above is the most optimal form of radiation protection, it requires being locked in a very thick bunker for a significant amount of time. In the event of a nuclear catastrophe of any kind, it is imperative to have mobile protection equipment for medical and security personnel to perform necessary containment, evacuation, and any number of other important public safety objectives. The mass of the shielding material required to properly protect the entire body from high energy radiation would make functional movement essentially impossible. This has led scientists to begin researching the idea of partial body protection: a strategy inspired by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The idea is to use enough shielding material to sufficiently protect the high concentration of bone marrow in the pelvic region, which contains enough regenerative stem cells to repopulate the body with unaffected bone marrow. More information on bone marrow shielding can be found in the https:// article https://, or in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA)'s 2015 report: https://\nThe seven-ten rule.\nThe danger of radiation from fallout also decreases rapidly with time due in large part to the exponential decay of the individual radionuclides. A book by Cresson H. Kearny presents data showing that for the first few days after the explosion, the radiation dose rate is reduced by a factor of ten for every seven-fold increase in the number of hours since the explosion. He presents data showing that \"it takes about seven times as long for the dose rate to decay from 1000 roentgens per hour (1000\u00a0R/hr) to 10\u00a0R/hr (48 hours) as to decay from 1000\u00a0R/hr to 100\u00a0R/hr (7 hours).\" This is a rule of thumb based on observed data, not a precise relation.\nUnited States government guides for fallout protection.\nThe United States government, often the Office of Civil Defense in the Department of Defense, provided guides to fallout protection in the 1960s, frequently in the form of booklets. These booklets provided information on how to best survive nuclear fallout. They also included instructions for various fallout shelters, whether for a family, a hospital, or a school shelter were provided. There were also instructions for how to create an improvised fallout shelter, and what to do to best increase a person's chances for survival if they were unprepared.\nThe central idea in these guides is that materials like concrete, soil, and sand are necessary to shield a person from fallout particles and radiation. A significant amount of materials of this type are necessary to protect a person from fallout radiation, so safety clothing cannot protect a person from fallout radiation. However, protective clothing can keep fallout particles off a person's body, but the radiation from these particles will still permeate through the clothing. For safety clothing to be able to block the fallout radiation, it would have to be so thick and heavy that a person could not function.\nThese guides indicated that fallout shelters should contain enough resources to keep its occupants alive for up to two weeks. Community shelters were preferred over single-family shelters. The more people in a shelter, the greater quantity and variety of resources that shelter would be equipped with. These communities\u2019 shelters would also help facilitate efforts to recuperate the community in the future. Single family shelters should be built below ground if possible. Many different types of fallout shelters could be made for a relatively small amount of money. A common format for fallout shelters was to build the shelter underground, with solid concrete blocks to act as the roof. If a shelter could only be partially underground, it was recommended to mound over that shelter with as much soil as possible. If a house had a basement, it is best for a fallout shelter to be constructed in a corner of the basement. The center of a basement is where the most radiation will be because the easiest way for radiation to enter a basement is from the floor above. Two of the walls of the shelter in a basement corner will be the basement walls that are surrounded by soil outside. Cinder blocks filled with sand or soil were highly recommended for the other two walls. Concrete blocks, or some other dense material, should be used as a roof for a basement fallout shelter because the floor of a house is not an adequate roof for a fallout shelter. These shelters should contain water, food, tools, and a method for dealing with human waste.\nIf a person did not have a shelter previously built, these guides recommended trying to get underground. If a person had a basement but no shelter, they should put food, water, and a waste container in the corner of the basement. Then items such as furniture should be piled up to create walls around the person in the corner. If the underground cannot be reached, a tall apartment building at least ten miles from the blast was recommended as a good fallout shelter. People in these buildings should get as close to the center of the building as possible and avoid the top and ground floors.\nSchools were the preferred fallout shelters according to the Office of Civil Defense. Schools, not including universities, contained around one-quarter of the population of the United States when they were in session at that time. The distribution of schools across the nation reflected the population density, and they were often the most suitable building in a community to act as a fallout shelter. Schools also already had organization with leaders in place. The Office of Civil Defense recommended altering current schools and the construction of future schools to include thicker walls and roofs, better-protected electrical systems, a purifying ventilation system, and a protected water pump. The Office of Civil Defense determined that around 10 square feet of net area per person were necessary in schools that were to function as a fallout shelter. A normal classroom could provide 180 people with area to sleep. If an attack were to happen, all the unnecessary furniture was to be moved out of the classrooms to make more room for people. It was recommended to keep one or two tables in the room if possible to use as a food-serving station.\nThe Office of Civil Defense conducted four case studies to find the cost of turning four standing schools into fallout shelters and what their capacity would be. The cost of the schools per occupant in the 1960s were $66.00, $127.00, $50.00, and $180.00. The capacity of people these schools could house as shelters were 735, 511, 484, and 460 respectively.\nThe US Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency in coordination with other agencies concerned with public protection in the aftermath of a nuclear detonation have developed more recent guidance documents that build on the older Civil Defense frameworks. Planning Guidance for Response to a Nuclear Detonation was published in 2022 and provided in-depth analysis and response planning for local government jurisdictions.\nNuclear reactor accident.\nFallout can also refer to nuclear accidents, although a nuclear reactor does not explode like a nuclear weapon. The isotopic signature of bomb fallout is very different from the fallout from a serious power reactor accident (such as Chernobyl or Fukushima).\nThe key differences are in volatility and half-life.\nVolatility.\nThe boiling point of an element (or its compounds) determines the percentage of that element that a power reactor accident releases. The ability of an element to form a solid determines the rate it is deposited on the ground after having been injected into the atmosphere by a nuclear detonation or accident.\nHalf-life.\nA half life is the time it takes the radiation emitted by a specific substance to decay to half the initial value. A large amount of short-lived isotopes such as 97Zr are present in bomb fallout. This isotope and other short-lived isotopes are constantly generated in a power reactor, but because the criticality occurs over a long length of time, the majority of these short lived isotopes decay before they can be released.\nPreventive measures.\nNuclear fallout can occur due to a number of different sources. One of the most common potential sources of nuclear fallout is that of nuclear reactors. Because of this, steps must be taken to ensure the risk of nuclear fallout at nuclear reactors is controlled. \nIn the 1950s and 60's, the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) began developing safety regulations against nuclear fallout for civilian nuclear reactors. Because the effects of nuclear fallout are more widespread and longer lasting than other forms of energy production accidents, the AEC desired a more proactive response towards potential accidents than ever before. One step to prevent nuclear reactor accidents was the Price-Anderson Act. Passed by Congress in 1957, the Price-Anderson Act ensured government assistance above the $60 million covered by private insurance companies in the case of a nuclear reactor accident. The main goal of the Price-Anderson Act was to protect the multi-billion-dollar companies overseeing the production of nuclear reactors. Without this protection, the nuclear reactor industry could potentially come to a halt, and the protective measures against nuclear fallout would be reduced. However, because of the limited experience in nuclear reactor technology, engineers had a difficult time calculating the potential risk of released radiation. Engineers were forced to imagine every unlikely accident, and the potential fallout associated with each accident. The AEC's regulations against potential nuclear reactor fallout were centered on the ability of the power plant to the Maximum Credible Accident (MCA). The MCA involved a \"large release of radioactive isotopes after a substantial meltdown of the reactor fuel when the reactor coolant system failed through a Loss-of-Coolant Accident\". The prevention of the MCA enabled a number of new nuclear fallout preventive measures. Static safety systems, or systems without power sources or user input, were enabled to prevent potential human error. Containment buildings, for example, were reliably effective at containing a release of radiation and did not need to be powered or turned on to operate. Active protective systems, although far less dependable, can do many things that static systems cannot. For example, a system to replace the escaping steam of a cooling system with cooling water could prevent reactor fuel from melting. However, this system would need a sensor to detect the presence of releasing steam. Sensors can fail, and the results of a lack of preventive measures would result in a local nuclear fallout. The AEC had to choose, then, between active and static systems to protect the public from nuclear fallout. With a lack of set standards and probabilistic calculations, the AEC and the industry became divided on the best safety precautions to use. \nThis division gave rise to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). The NRC was committed to 'regulations through research', which gave the regulatory committee a knowledge bank of research on which to draw their regulations. Much of the research done by the NRC sought to move safety systems from a deterministic viewpoint into a new probabilistic approach. The deterministic approach sought to foresee all problems before they arose. The probabilistic approach uses a more mathematical approach to weigh the risks of potential radiation leaks. Much of the probabilistic safety approach can be drawn from the radiative transfer theory in Physics, which describes how radiation travels in free space and through barriers. Today, the NRC is still the leading regulatory committee on nuclear reactor power plants.\nDetermining extent of nuclear fallout.\nThe International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale (INES) is the primary form of categorizing the potential health and environmental effects of a nuclear or radiological event and communicating it to the public. The scale, which was developed in 1990 by the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Nuclear Energy Agency of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, classifies these nuclear accidents based on the potential impact of the fallout:\nThe INES scale is composed of seven steps that categorize the nuclear events, ranging from anomalies that must be recorded to improve upon safety measures to serious accidents that require immediate action.\nChernobyl\nThe 1986 nuclear reactor explosion at Chernobyl was categorized as a Level 7 accident, which is the highest possible ranking on the INES scale, due to widespread environmental and health effects and \"external release of a significant fraction of reactor core inventory\". The nuclear accident still stands as the only accident in commercial nuclear power that led to radiation-related deaths. The steam explosion and fires released approximately 5200 PBq, or at least 5 percent of the reactor core, into the atmosphere. The explosion itself resulted in the deaths of two plant workers, while 28 people died over the weeks that followed of severe radiation poisoning. Furthermore, young children and adolescents in the areas most contaminated by the radiation exposure showed an increase in the risk for thyroid cancer, although the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation stated that \"there is no evidence of a major public health impact\" apart from that. The nuclear accident also took a heavy toll on the environment, including contamination in urban environments caused by the deposition of radionuclides and the contamination of \"different crop types, in particular, green leafy vegetables ... depending on the deposition levels, and time of the growing season\".\nThree Mile Island\nThe nuclear meltdown at Three Mile Island in 1979 was categorized as a Level 5 accident on the INES scale because of the \"severe damage to the reactor core\" and the radiation leak caused by the incident. Three Mile Island was the most serious accident in the history of American commercial nuclear power plants, yet the effects were different from those of the Chernobyl accident. A study done by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission following the incident reveals that the nearly 2 million people surrounding the Three Mile Island plant \"are estimated to have received an average radiation dose of only 1 millirem above the usual background dose\". Furthermore, unlike those affected by radiation in the Chernobyl accident, the development of thyroid cancer in the people around Three Mile Island was \"less aggressive and less advanced\".\nFukushima\nLike the Three Mile Island incident, the incident at Fukushima was initially categorized as a Level 5 accident on the INES scale after a tsunami disabled the power supply and cooling of three reactors, which then suffered significant melting in the days that followed. However, after combining the events at the three reactors rather than assessing them individually, the accident was upgraded to an INES Level 7. The radiation exposure from the incident caused a recommended evacuation for inhabitants up to 30\u00a0km away from the plant. However, it was also hard to track such exposure because 23 out of the 24 radioactive monitoring stations were also disabled by the tsunami. Removing contaminated water, both in the plant itself and run-off water that spread into the sea and nearby areas, became a huge challenge for the Japanese government and plant workers. During the containment period following the accident, thousands of cubic meters of slightly contaminated water were released in the sea to free up storage for more contaminated water in the reactor and turbine buildings. However, the fallout from the Fukushima accident had a minimal impact on the surrounding population. According to the Institut de Radioprotection et de S\u00fbret\u00e9 Nucl\u00e9aire, over 62 percent of assessed residents within the Fukushima prefecture received external doses of less than 1 mSv in the four months following the accident. In addition, comparing screening campaigns for children inside the Fukushima prefecture and in the rest of the country revealed no significant difference in the risk of thyroid cancer.\nInternational nuclear safety standards.\nFounded in 1974, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was created to set forth international standards for nuclear reactor safety. However, without a proper policing force, the guidelines set forth by the IAEA were often treated lightly or ignored completely. In 1986, the disaster at Chernobyl was evidence that international nuclear reactor safety was not to be taken lightly. Even in the midst of the Cold War, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission sought to improve the safety of Soviet nuclear reactors. As noted by IAEA Director General Hans Blix, \"A radiation cloud doesn't know international boundaries.\" The NRC showed the Soviets the safety guidelines used in the US: capable regulation, safety-minded operations, and effective plant designs. The Soviets, however, had their own priority: keeping the plant running at all costs. In the end, the same shift between deterministic safety designs to probabilistic safety designs prevailed. In 1989, the World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO) was formed to cooperate with the IAEA to ensure the same three pillars of reactor safety across international borders. In 1991, WANO concluded (using a probabilistic safety approach) that all former communist-controlled nuclear reactors could not be trusted, and should be closed. Compared to a \"Nuclear Marshall Plan\", efforts were taken throughout the 1990s and 2000s to ensure international standards of safety for all nuclear reactors.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is a reversible hydraulic machine that can be operated both as a pump or a power generator. \nThe origins of the water screw are unknown; Archimedes of Syracuse is traditionally credited with inventing the water screw, but other academics argue Archimedes found the Egyptians already using the screw. Moschion between 250\u2013220 BC details the screw used as a bilge pump in a ship, with Posidonius reporting that the water screw was used for drainage in Spanish mines. Archaeological remains of the screw in Europe and Asia suggested that screw was diffused across the territories of the Roman Empire, though it fell out of use in the third century BC. \nAs a machine used for lifting water from a low-lying body of water into irrigation ditches, it lifts water by turning a screw-shaped surface inside a pipe. In the modern world, Archimedes screw pumps are widely used in wastewater treatment plants and for dewatering low-lying regions. Run in reverse, Archimedes screw turbines act as a small hydroelectric powerplant that can be applied even in low head sites. Such generators operate in a wide range of flows (0.01 m3/s to 14.5 m3/s) and heads (0.1 m to 10 m), including low heads and moderate flow rates that are not ideal for traditional turbines and not occupied by high performance technologies.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nThe origins of the water screw are unknown; Archimedes is credited with inventing the water screw, but others have contested this. According to Posidonius, Archimedes invented the screw when he visited Egypt, possibly during Ptolemy II Philadelphus's reign between 283\u2013246 BC. Other academics posits that Archimedes possibly found Egyptians already using the screw, though Canadian archaeologist John Peter Oleson notes that \"no explanation is ever provided for the subsequent identification of the device with Archimedes or for the total lack of any literary or archaeological evidence for the existence of the water-screw before ca. 250 BC\", and argues that there may have been confusion over the term used by Posidonius. \nAssyrianologist Stephanie Dalley proposed that the water screw was used to irrigate the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. A cuneiform inscription of Assyrian King Sennacherib (704\u2013681 BC) has been interpreted by Dalley to describe casting water screws in bronze some 350 years earlier. This is consistent with Greek historian Strabo, who describes the Hanging Gardens as irrigated by screws.\nAntiquity.\nThe screw pump is the oldest positive displacement pump; Moschion reports in \"Treatise on the Great Ship of Hieron of Syracuse\", written between 250\u2013220 BC, that the screw was used as a bilge pump in a ship built for Hiero II of Syracuse. Posidonius also recorded water screws in Spanish mines used for drainage. Oleson notes that archaeological remains of the water screw were found in the territory of the Roman Empire such as Egypt, Spain, France, and Italy, whilst literary texts and inscriptions describe the screw to be present in Mesopotamia, Egypt, Syria, and Spain, though the lack of screws in Rome and northern Europe suggests that the screw was not utilised much there as irrigation and mining were less prioritised in those regions. By the late 1st century BC or 1st century AD, there were not many records mentioning the screw, according to Oleson's investigation in Fayum; he posits that they were either uncommon in the city or were not taxed, and hence were not recorded. The earliest depiction of the water screw is a fresco at the Casa di P. Cornelius Teges in Pompeii dating earlier than 79 AD, which shows an Egyptian screw. Archimedes' screw continued to be used in Europe until it fell out of use in the end of the third century, though Oleson hypothesises that the Arabs continued using the screw in north Africa and may have reintroduced the screw to Europe following the conquest of Spain in the 8th century. \nArchimedes never claimed credit for its invention, but it was attributed to him 200 years later by Diodorus, who believed that Archimedes invented the screw pump in Egypt. Depictions of Greek and Roman water screws show them being powered by a human treading on the outer casing to turn the entire apparatus as one piece, which would require that the casing be rigidly attached to the screw.\nDevelopment and modern use.\nGerman engineer Konrad Kyeser equipped the Archimedes screw with a crank mechanism in his \"Bellifortis\" (1405). This mechanism quickly replaced the ancient practice of working the pipe by treading. The world's first seagoing steamship driven by a screw propeller was the SS \"Archimedes\", which was launched in 1839 and named in honor of Archimedes and his work on the screw. Developments in maritime transport occurred over the next 180 years from the Fawcett, Preston and Company double blade design and patents by Sharrow Marine to address rotary propulsion and flow control on boating vessels through loop propellers. Electricity generation through hydropower pumps such as the Meriden project operated by New England Hydropower also uses Archimedes screw to direct water into the top, rather than the bottom, of the screw which forces it to rotate.\nArchimedes screws are used in sewage treatment plants because they cope well with varying rates of flow and with suspended solids. Screw turbines (ASTs) are a new form of generator for small hydroelectric powerplants that could be applied even in low-head sites. The low rotation speed of ASTs reduces negative impacts on aquatic life and fish. This technology is used primarily at fish hatcheries to lift fish safely from ponds and transport them to another location. An Archimedes screw was used in the successful 2001 stabilization of the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Small amounts of subsoil saturated by groundwater were removed from far below the north side of the tower, and the weight of the tower itself corrected the lean.\nOther inventions using Archimedes screws include the auger conveyor in a snow blower, grain elevator, concrete mixer and chocolate fountain.\nDesign.\nThe Archimedes screw consists of a screw (a helical surface surrounding a central cylindrical shaft) inside a hollow pipe. The screw is usually turned by windmill, manual labor, cattle, or by modern means, such as a motor. As the shaft turns, the bottom end scoops up a volume of water. This water is then pushed up the tube by the rotating helicoid until it pours out from the top of the tube.\nThe contact surface between the screw and the pipe does not need to be perfectly watertight, as long as the amount of water being scooped with each turn is large compared to the amount of water leaking out of each section of the screw per turn. If water from one section leaks into the next lower one, it will be transferred upwards by the next segment of the screw.\nIn some designs, the screw is fused to the casing and they both rotate together, instead of the screw turning within a stationary casing. The screw could be sealed to the casing with pitch resin or other adhesive, or the screw and casing could be cast together as a single piece in bronze.\nStudies show that the volume of flow passes through Archimedes screws is a function of inlet depth, diameter and rotation speed of the screw. Therefore, the following analytical equation could be used to design Archimedes screws:\nformula_1\nwhere formula_2 is in formula_3 and:\nformula_4: Rotation speed of the Archimedes screw (rad/s)\nformula_5: Volumetric flow rate formula_6\nBased on the common standards that the Archimedes screw designers use this analytical equation could be simplified as:\nformula_7\nThe value of \u03b7 could simply determinate using the formula_8 graph or formula_9 graph. By determination of formula_2, other design parameters of Archimedes screws can be calculated using a step-by-step analytical method.\nVariants.\nA screw conveyor is a similar device which transports bulk materials such as powders and cereal grains. It is contained within a tube and turned by a motor to deliver material from one end of the conveyor to the other and particularly suitable for transport of granular materials such as plastic granules used in injection moulding. It may also be used to transport liquids. In industrial control applications, the conveyor may be used as a rotary feeder or variable rate feeder to deliver a measured rate or quantity of material into a process.\nA variant of the Archimedes screw can also be found in some injection moulding machines, die casting machines and extrusion of plastics, which employ a screw of decreasing pitch to compress and melt the material. It is also used in a rotary-screw air compressor. On a much larger scale, Archimedes's screws of decreasing pitch are used for the compaction of waste material.\nReverse action.\nIf water is fed into the top of an Archimedes screw, it will force the screw to rotate. The rotating shaft can then be used to drive an electric generator. Such an installation has the same benefits as using the screw for pumping: the ability to handle very dirty water and widely varying rates of flow at high efficiency. Settle Hydro and Torrs Hydro are two reverse screw micro hydro schemes operating in England. The screw works well as a generator at low heads, commonly found in English rivers, including the Thames, powering Windsor Castle.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The value is the average of three statistics: basic literacy rate, infant mortality, and life expectancy at age one, all equally weighted on a 1 to 100 scale.\nIt was developed for the Overseas Development Council in the mid-1970s by M.D Morris, as one of a number of measures created due to dissatisfaction with the use of GNP as an indicator of development. He thought that they would cover a wide range of indicators like health, sanitation, drinking water, nutrition, education etc. PQLI might be regarded as an improvement but shares the general problems of measuring quality of life in a quantitative way. It has also been criticized because there is a considerable overlap between infant mortality and life expectancy.\nThe UN Human Development Index is a more widely used means of measuring well-being.\nSteps to Calculate Physical Quality of Life:\nIncrease in national income and per capita income are not the real indicators of economic development, as it has a number of limitations. Increasing incomes of the country are concentrated in the hands of a few people, which is not development. The development of a country should be such that the living standards of the poor rises, and the basic requirements of the citizens are fulfilled. Keeping this in mind, Morris Davis Morris presented the physical quality of life index, in short known as the PQLI. In this index, betterment of physical quality of life of human beings is considered economic development. The level of physical quality of life determines the level of economic development. If any country's physical quality of life is higher than that of the other country, then that country is considered as more developed. There are three standards to measure the physical quality, which are depicted here:\n1)- Extent of Education,\n2)- Life Expectancy &amp;\n3)- Infant Mortality Rate"}
{"id": "53692", "revid": "48219523", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53692", "title": "Payola", "text": "Undisclosed paid promotional broadcasts\nPayola, in the music industry, is\nthe illegal practice of paying a commercial radio station to play a song without the station disclosing the payment. Under U.S. law, a radio station must disclose songs they were paid to play on the air as sponsored airtime. The number of times the songs are played can influence the perceived popularity of a song, and payola may be used to influence these metrics. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) treats payola as a violation of the Sponsorship Identification Rules, which require any broadcast of paid material to include a disclosure.\nThe term \"payola\", coined by entertainment magazine \"Variety\" in 1938, is a combination of \"pay\" and \"-ola,\" the latter of which is a suffix of product names common in the early 20th century, such as Pianola, Victrola, Amberola, Mazola, Crayola, Rock-Ola, Shinola, or brands such as the radio equipment manufacturer Motorola.\nHistory.\nBefore the 1930s, there was little public scrutiny of the reasoning behind a song's popularity. The advertising agencies that sponsored NBC's radio/TV show \"Your Hit Parade\" refused to reveal the specific methods that were used to determine top hits. Only general and vague statements were offered; that determining top hits was based on \"readings of radio requests, sheet music sales, dance hall favorites and jukebox tabulations.\" Early attempts to stop payola were met with silence by publishers.\nProsecution for payola in the 1950s was, in part, a reaction of the traditional music establishment against newcomers. The emergence of hit radio had become a threat to the wages of song pluggers and publishers' revenue streams. By the mid-1940s, three-quarters of the records produced in the United States went into jukeboxes. Attempts were made to link all payola to rock-and-roll music. In the 1950s, independent record companies or music publishers frequently used payola to promote rock and roll on American radio.\nWhile the amount of money involved remains largely unpublished, Phil Lind of Chicago's WAIT disclosed in Congressional hearings that he had taken US$22,000 to play a record.\nU.S. investigations and aftermath.\nThe first U.S. Congressional Payola Investigations occurred in 1959. The investigations were carried out by the House Subcommittee on Legislative Oversight into payola, and prompted by a parallel investigation in the US Senate.\nDJ Alan Freed, who was uncooperative in committee hearings, was fired as a result. Dick Clark also testified before the committee, but avoided repercussions, partly because he had divested his ownership interest in music-industry holdings.\nFollowing the investigation, radio DJs were stripped of the authority to make programming decisions, and payola became a misdemeanor offense. Programming decisions became the responsibility of station program directors. However, this had the result of simplifying the process of payola: instead of reaching numerous DJs, record labels only had to persuade the station's program director. Labels could circumvent payola allegations by utilizing independent third parties (see below).\nIn 1976, inner-city urban soul DJ Frankie Crocker was indicted in a payola scandal, causing him to leave New York radio, where his influence was greatest. The charges were later dropped, and he returned to New York, hosting MTV's video jukebox.\nFollowing the creation of music-sharing websites in the late 1990s, the power of independent promoters declined, and labels returned to dealing with stations directly.\nModern day.\nIn recent years, 'payola' has taken on a new form, about the alleged practice of paying streaming services, like Spotify, to recommend an artist more. Payola is also widely used as an insult on Stan Twitter.\nModus operandi.\nPayola is used by record labels to promote their artists, and can be in the form of monetary rewards or other types of reimbursement. This can include purchasing advertising, requiring bands to play station-sponsored concerts, or paying stations to hold \"meet the band\" contests. In exchange, the band gains a place on a station's playlist or a lesser-known band of the label may gain airtime.\nThird-party loophole.\nA perceived loophole in U.S. payola laws is for labels to utilize a third-party or independent promoter (not to be confused with independent record label). The promoter would offer \"promotion payments\" to station directors for putting their client's artists on the station's playlist, sidestepping Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations. As it was seen as falling outside the payola rules, stations did not deem it necessary to report to authorities. This practice became widespread until a 1986 NBC News investigation called \"The New Payola\" instigated another round of Congressional investigations.\nIn 2002, investigations by the office of then-New York District Attorney Eliot Spitzer uncovered evidence that executives at Sony BMG Music labels had made deals with several large commercial radio chains. Spitzer's office settled out of court with Sony BMG Music Entertainment in July 2005, Warner Music Group in November 2005 and Universal Music Group in May 2006. The three conglomerates agreed to pay $10 million, $5 million, and $12 million, respectively, to New York State non-profit organizations that will fund music education and appreciation programs. EMI settled in 2006 for $3.75 million.\nConcerns about contemporary forms of payola in the US prompted an investigation during which the FCC established that the \"loophole\" was still a violation of the law. In 2007, four companies (CBS Radio, Citadel, Clear Channel, and Entercom) settled on paying $12.5 million in fines and accepting tougher restrictions for three years, although no company admitted any wrongdoing. Due to increased legal scrutiny, some larger radio companies (including industry giant Clear Channel) now refuse to have any contact with independent promoters.\nClear Channel Radio, through iHeartRadio, launched a program called \"On the Verge\" that required the stations to play a given song at least 150 times to give a new artist exposure. Brand managers at the top of the Clear Channel chain, after listening to hundreds of songs and filtering them down to about five or six favorites from various formats, send those selections to program directors across the country. These program directors vote on which ones they think radio listeners will like the most. Songs that benefited from the exposure were Iggy Azalea's \"Fancy\", Tinashe's \"2 On\", Anthony Lewis' \"Candy Rain\", and Jhen\u00e9 Aiko's \"The Worst\". Tom Poleman, president of national programming platforms for the company, stated that the acts selected are based solely on the quality of their music and not on label pressure.\nOn Spotify, labels can pay for tracks to appear in user playlists as \"Sponsored Songs\". It is possible for users to opt out of this in their account settings.\nAs money laundering scheme.\nIn Mexico, South America, and some regions along the U.S. southern border, payola is used to launder money from illegal operations. In this practice, unknown \"new artists\" will suddenly appear on multiple formats and be aggressively promoted by producers of dubious origin, then disappear from the music scene or change their stage name.\nCriticism.\nOn 25 September 2007, the U.S. Congress held a hearing on hip hop music entitled \"From Imus to Industry: The Business of Stereotypes and Degrading Images\". In her testimony, Lisa Fager Bediako, co-founder and President of media watchdog group Industry Ears, argued that misogynistic and racist stereotypes permeate hip hop music because record labels, radio stations, and music video channels profit from allowing such material to air while censoring other material. In that context, Fager stated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Payola is no longer the local DJ receiving a couple dollars for airplay; it is now an organized corporate crime that supports the lack of balanced content and demeaning imagery with no consequences.\nSatire of payola practices.\nIn 1960, Stan Freberg did a parody on the Payola Scandal, by calling it \"Old Payola Roll Blues\", a two-sided single, where the promoter gets an ordinary teenager, named Clyde Ankle, to record a song, for Obscurity Records, entitled \"High School OO OO\", and then tries to offer the song to a jazz radio station with phony deals that the disc jockey just won't buy it. It ends with an anti-rock song, saying hello to jazz and swing, and goodbye to amateur nights, including rock and roll.\nThe Vancouver new wave band the Payola$ chose their moniker during the punk explosion of the late 1970s.\nThe practice is criticized in the chorus of the Dead Kennedys song \"Pull My Strings\", a parody of the song \"My Sharona\" (\"My Payola\") sung to a crowd of music industry leaders during a music award ceremony.\nThe They Might Be Giants song \"Hey, Mr. DJ, I Thought You Said We Had a Deal\" is about the practice. It is narrated from the point of view of a naive and inexperienced musician who has been coerced by a disc jockey into paying for airplay. The disc jockey then disappears and does not deliver on his promise.\nThe practice is satirized in the song \"Payola Blues\" by Neil Young, from his 1983 album \"Everybody's Rockin\"'. It opens by saying \"This one's for you, Alan Freed\" and then states \"Cause the things they're doing today would make a saint out of you\", implying that Payola corruption is bigger now (or was bigger in the 1980s) than it was in the 1950s.\nPayola is referenced in Billy Joel's song \"We Didn't Start the Fire\", during the verse dealing with the events of 1960.\nOn a Washington, D.C. radio station in 1999, the disc jockeys announced that they were debuting the Lou Bega song \"Mambo Number 5\", by saying that they had accepted a large amount of payola to play the song. Ironically, if they had actually been paid to play the song on the air, it would not have been payola, because payola is the \"unannounced\" acceptance of a payment to run a song. If the song is identified before being played as being done because the talent or station is being paid to do so, the playing of the song and acceptance of money to do so is perfectly legal and does not constitute payola. \nPayola was depicted in the film \"The Harder They Come\", released in 1972, where a record producer, not the recording artist, controls the airwaves. The portrayal of its protagonist (Jimmy Cliff) as an aspiring musician who is forced to sign away his rights to make a hit record depicts the role of record producers and radio DJs as a dominance \u2013 the musician ends up with no aspirations or living the same lifestyle, as in the case of the film \"Rockers\".\nIn an installment of \"Mathnet\" from PBS's Square One Television, the detectives George Frankly and Pat Tuesday investigated a case of suspected payola by forming a fictitious group called \"The Googols\" and creating their own song titled \"Without Math\". Payola was eventually ruled out as a cause of increased sales of particular songs at a company.\nCriticism of U.S. laws.\nThe FCC and the Communications Act of 1934 both have strict requirements and rules regarding payola. These demand that:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEven with these requirements in place, however, record companies have found loopholes within the phrasing of the regulations to continue the practice. These loopholes have created a situation that isolates independent artists from mainstream media. A current example of this is the lengths that artists Macklemore and Ryan Lewis went to get their music heard. Because Lewis and Macklemore belonged to an independent label, they feared that payola laws would interfere with their airtime. So they hired an independent arm of Warner Music Group, the Alternative Distribution Alliance, which assists independent acts to get their music on radio. Zach Quillen, manager of Macklemore and Ryan Lewis, discussed how \"they paid the alliance a flat monthly fee to help promote the album.\"\nOne side effect of the vagueness of the law and the creation of the loophole is the expansion of the concept at the hands of online music sharing websites. In 2009, the website Jango created a plan to accept promotion fees legally by disclosing that they are paid to play the songs. \"For as little as $30, a band can buy 1,000 plays on the music-streaming service, slotted in between established artists. The artists themselves choose what other music they'd like to be played next to.\"\nIn popular culture.\nIn the musical \"Dreamgirls\" and its 2006 film adaptation, payola is a recurring plot element.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is developed by smelting iron ore in a blast furnace. Pig iron has a high carbon content, typically 3.8\u20134.7%, along with silica and other dross, which makes it brittle and not useful directly as a material except for limited applications.\nEtymology.\nThe traditional shape of the molds used for pig iron ingots is a branching structure formed in sand, with many individual ingots at right angles to a central channel or \"runner\", resembling a litter of piglets being nursed by a sow. When the metal had cooled and hardened, the smaller ingots (the \"pigs\") were simply broken from the runner (the \"sow\"), hence the name \"pig iron\". As pig iron is intended for remelting, the uneven size of the ingots and the inclusion of small amounts of sand are insignificant issues when compared to the ease of casting and handling.\nHistory.\nThe Chinese were already making pig iron during the later Zhou dynasty (which ended in 256\u00a0BC). Furnaces, such as Lapphyttan in Sweden, may date back as far back as the 12th century; and some in the County of Mark dating back to the 13th century, which is now part of Westphalia, Germany. It remains to be established whether these northern European developments were derived from the Chinese ones. Wagner has postulated a possible link via Persian contacts with China along the Silk Road and Viking contacts with Persia, but there is a chronological gap between the Viking period and Lapphyttan.\nSmelting and producing wrought iron were known in ancient Europe and the Middle East, but it was produced in bloomeries by direct reduction. Small prills of pig iron dispersed in slag are produced in all iron furnaces, but the operator of a bloomery had to avoid conditions causing\u00a0the phase transition of the iron into liquid in the furnace, as the prill globules or any resulting pig iron are not malleable so can't be hammered in a single piece. Alternatively, decarburizing the pig iron into steel was an extremely tedious process using medieval technology, so in Europe before the Middle Ages the prills were discarded with the slag.\nUses.\nTraditionally, pig iron was worked into wrought iron in finery forges, later puddling furnaces, and more recently, into steel. In these processes, pig iron is melted and a strong current of air is directed over it while it is stirred or agitated. This causes the dissolved impurities (such as silicon) to be thoroughly oxidized. An intermediate product of puddling is known as \"refined pig iron\", \"finers metal\", or \"refined iron\".\nPig iron can also be used to produce gray iron. This is achieved by remelting pig iron, often along with substantial quantities of steel and scrap iron, removing undesirable contaminants, adding alloys, and adjusting the carbon content. Ductile iron can also be produced using certain high purity grades of pig iron; depending on the grade of ductile iron being produced, the pig irons chosen may be low in the elements silicon, manganese, sulfur and phosphorus. High purity pig iron is used to dilute any elements in a ductile iron charge which may be harmful to the ductile iron process (except carbon).\nModern uses.\nPig iron was historically poured directly out of the bottom of the blast furnace through a channel into a ladle car for transfer to the steel mill in mostly liquid form; in this state, the pig iron was referred to as \"hot metal\". The hot metal was then poured into a steelmaking vessel to produce steel, typically an electric arc furnace, induction furnace or basic oxygen furnace, where the excess carbon is burned off and the alloy composition controlled. Earlier processes for this included the finery forge, the puddling furnace, the Bessemer process, and the open hearth furnace.\nModern steel mills and direct-reduction iron plants transfer the molten iron to a ladle for immediate use in the steel making furnaces or cast it into pigs on a pig-casting machine for reuse or resale. Modern pig casting machines produce stick pigs, which break into smaller piglets at discharge.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The other operations are addition, subtraction, and multiplication. What is being divided is called the dividend, which is divided by the divisor, and the result is called the \"quotient\". \nAt an elementary level the division of two natural numbers is, among other possible interpretations, the process of calculating the number of times one number is contained within another. For example, if 20 apples are divided evenly between 4 people, everyone receives 5 apples (see picture). However, this number of times or the number contained (divisor) need not be integers.\nThe division with remainder or Euclidean division of two natural numbers provides an integer \"quotient\", which is the number of times the second number is completely contained in the first number, and a \"remainder\", which is the part of the first number that remains, when in the course of computing the quotient, no further full chunk of the size of the second number can be allocated. For example, if 21 apples are divided between 4 people, everyone receives 5 apples again, and 1 apple remains.\nFor division to always yield one number rather than an integer quotient plus a remainder, the natural numbers must be extended to rational numbers or real numbers. In these enlarged number systems, division is the inverse operation to multiplication, that is \"a\" \n \"c\" / \"b\" means \"a\" \u00d7 \"b\" \n \"c\", as long as \"b\" is not zero. If \"b\" = 0, then this is a division by zero, which is not defined. In the 21-apples example, everyone would receive 5 apple and a quarter of an apple, thus avoiding any leftover.\nBoth forms of division appear in various algebraic structures, different ways of defining mathematical structure. Those in which a Euclidean division (with remainder) is defined are called Euclidean domains and include polynomial rings in one indeterminate (which define multiplication and addition over single-variabled formulas). Those in which a division (with a single result) by all nonzero elements is defined are called fields and division rings. In a ring the elements by which division is always possible are called the units (for example, 1 and \u22121 in the ring of integers). Another generalization of division to algebraic structures is the quotient group, in which the result of \"division\" is a group rather than a number.\nIntroduction.\nThe simplest way of viewing division is in terms of quotition and partition: from the quotition perspective, 20 / 5 means the number of 5s that must be added to get\u00a020. In terms of partition, 20 / 5 means the size of each of 5 parts into which a set of size 20 is divided. For example, 20 apples divide into five groups of four apples, meaning that \"twenty divided by five is equal to four\". This is denoted as 20 / 5 = 4, or = 4. In the example, 20 is the dividend, 5 is the divisor, and 4 is the quotient.\nUnlike the other basic operations, when dividing natural numbers there is sometimes a remainder that will not go evenly into the dividend; for example, 10 / 3 leaves a remainder of 1, as 10 is not a multiple of 3. Sometimes this remainder is added to the quotient as a fractional part, so 10 / 3 is equal to or 3.33..., but in the context of integer division, where numbers have no fractional part, the remainder is kept separately (or exceptionally, discarded or rounded). When the remainder is kept as a fraction, it leads to a rational number. The set of all rational numbers is created by extending the integers with all possible results of divisions of integers.\nUnlike multiplication and addition, division is not commutative, meaning that \"a\" / \"b\" is not always equal to \"b\" / \"a\". Division is also not, in general, associative, meaning that when dividing multiple times, the order of division can change the result. For example, (24 / 6) / 2 \n 2, but 24 / (6 / 2) \n 8 (where the use of parentheses indicates that the operations inside parentheses are performed before the operations outside parentheses).\nDivision is traditionally considered as left-associative. That is, if there are multiple divisions in a row, the order of calculation goes from left to right:\n formula_8\nDivision is right-distributive over addition and subtraction, in the sense that \n formula_9\nThis is the same for multiplication, as formula_10. However, division is \"not\" left-distributive, as\n formula_11 \u00a0 For example formula_12 but formula_13\nThis is unlike the case in multiplication, which is both left-distributive and right-distributive, and thus distributive.\nNotation.\nDivision is often shown in algebra and science by placing the \"dividend\" over the \"divisor\" with a horizontal line, also called a fraction bar, between them. For example, \"\"a\" divided by \"b\"\" can be written as:\nformula_14\nwhich can also be read out loud as \"divide \"a\" by \"b\" or \"a\" over \"b\"\". A way to express division all on one line is to write the \"dividend\" (or numerator), then a slash, then the \"divisor\" (or denominator), as follows:\nformula_15\nThis is the usual way of specifying division in most computer programming languages, since it can easily be typed as a simple sequence of ASCII characters. (It is also the only notation used for quotient objects in abstract algebra.) Some mathematical software, such as MATLAB and GNU Octave, allows the operands to be written in the reverse order by using the backslash as the division operator:\nformula_16\nA typographical variation halfway between these two forms uses a solidus (fraction slash), but elevates the dividend and lowers the divisor:\nformula_17\nAny of these forms can be used to display a fraction. A fraction is a division expression where both dividend and divisor are integers (typically called the \"numerator\" and \"denominator\"), and there is no implication that the division must be evaluated further. A second way to show division is to use the division sign (\u00f7, also known as obelus though the term has additional meanings), common in arithmetic, in this manner:\nformula_18\nThis form is infrequent except in elementary arithmetic. ISO 80000-2-10.6 states it should not be used. This division sign is also used alone to represent the division operation itself, as for instance as a label on a key of a calculator. The obelus was introduced by Swiss mathematician Johann Rahn in 1659 in \"Teutsche Algebra\". The \u00f7 symbol is used to indicate subtraction in some European countries, so its use may be misunderstood.\nIn some non-English-speaking countries, a colon is used to denote division:\nformula_19\nThis notation was introduced by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in his 1684 \"Acta eruditorum\". Leibniz disliked having separate symbols for ratio and division. However, in English usage the colon is restricted to expressing the related concept of ratios.\nSince the 19th century, US textbooks have used formula_20 or formula_21 to denote \"a\" divided by \"b\", especially when discussing long division. The history of this notation is not entirely clear because it evolved over time.\nComputing.\nManual methods.\nDivision is often introduced through the notion of \"sharing out\" a set of objects, for example a pile of lollies, into a number of equal portions. Distributing the objects several at a time in each round of sharing to each portion leads to the idea of 'chunking'\u00a0\u2013 a form of division where one repeatedly subtracts multiples of the divisor from the dividend itself.\nBy allowing one to subtract more multiples than what the partial remainder allows at a given stage, more flexible methods, such as the bidirectional variant of chunking, can be developed as well.\nMore systematically and more efficiently, two integers can be divided with pencil and paper with the method of short division, if the divisor is small, or long division, if the divisor is larger. If the dividend has a fractional part (expressed as a decimal fraction), one can continue the procedure past the ones place as far as desired. If the divisor has a fractional part, one can restate the problem by moving the decimal to the right in both numbers until the divisor has no fraction, which can make the problem easier to solve (e.g., 10/2.5 = 100/25 = 4).\nDivision can be calculated with an abacus.\nLogarithm tables can be used to divide two numbers, by subtracting the two numbers' logarithms, then looking up the antilogarithm of the result.\nDivision can be calculated with a slide rule by aligning the divisor on the C scale with the dividend on the D scale. The quotient can be found on the D scale where it is aligned with the left index on the C scale. The user is responsible, however, for mentally keeping track of the decimal point.\nBy computer.\nModern calculators and computers compute division either by methods similar to long division, or by faster methods; see Division algorithm.\nIn modular arithmetic (modulo a prime number) and for real numbers, nonzero numbers have a multiplicative inverse. In these cases, a division by x may be computed as the product by the multiplicative inverse of x. This approach is often associated with the faster methods in computer arithmetic.\nDivision in different contexts.\nEuclidean division.\nEuclidean division is the mathematical formulation of the outcome of the usual process of division of integers. It asserts that, given two integers, \"a\", the \"dividend\", and \"b\", the \"divisor\", such that \"b\" \u2260 0, there are unique integers \"q\", the \"quotient\", and \"r\", the remainder, such that \"a\" = \"bq\" + \"r\" and 0 \u2264 \"r\" &lt; |\"b\"|, where |\"b\"| denotes the absolute value of \"b\".\nOf integers.\nIntegers are not closed under division. Apart from division by zero being undefined, the quotient is not an integer unless the dividend is an integer multiple of the divisor. For example, 26 cannot be divided by 11 to give an integer. Such a case uses one of five approaches:\nDividing integers in a computer program requires special care. Some programming languages treat integer division as in case 5 above, so the answer is an integer. Other languages, such as MATLAB and every computer algebra system return a rational number as the answer, as in case 3 above. These languages also provide functions to get the results of the other cases, either directly or from the result of case 3.\nNames and symbols used for integer division include div, /, \\, and %. Definitions vary regarding integer division when the dividend or the divisor is negative: rounding may be toward zero (so called T-division) or toward \u2212\u221e (F-division); rarer styles can occur \u2013 see modulo operation for the details.\nDivisibility rules can sometimes be used to quickly determine whether one integer divides exactly into another.\nOf rational numbers.\nThe result of dividing two rational numbers is another rational number when the divisor is not 0. The division of two rational numbers \"p\"/\"q\" and \"r\"/\"s\" can be computed as\nformula_27\nAll four quantities are integers, and only \"p\" may be 0. This definition ensures that division is the inverse operation of multiplication.\nOf real numbers.\nDivision of two real numbers results in another real number (when the divisor is nonzero). It is defined such that \"a\"/\"b\" = \"c\" if and only if \"a\" = \"cb\" and \"b\" \u2260 0.\nOf complex numbers.\nDividing two complex numbers (when the divisor is nonzero) results in another complex number, which is found using the conjugate of the denominator:\nformula_28\nThis process of multiplying and dividing by formula_29 is called 'realisation' or (by analogy) rationalisation. All four quantities \"p\", \"q\", \"r\", \"s\" are real numbers, and \"r\" and \"s\" may not both be 0.\nDivision for complex numbers expressed in polar form is simpler than the definition above:\nformula_30\nAgain all four quantities \"p\", \"q\", \"r\", \"s\" are real numbers, and \"r\" may not be 0.\nOf polynomials.\nOne can define the division operation for polynomials in one variable over a field. Then, as in the case of integers, one has a remainder. See Euclidean division of polynomials, and, for hand-written computation, polynomial long division or synthetic division.\nOf matrices.\nOne can define a division operation for matrices. The usual way to do this is to define \"A\" / \"B\" = \"AB\"\u22121, where \"B\"\u22121 denotes the inverse of \"B\", but it is far more common to write out \"AB\"\u22121 explicitly to avoid confusion. An elementwise division can also be defined in terms of the Hadamard product.\nLeft and right division.\nBecause matrix multiplication is not commutative, one can also define a left division or so-called \"backslash-division\" as \"A\" \\ \"B\" = \"A\"\u22121\"B\". For this to be well defined, \"B\"\u22121 need not exist, however \"A\"\u22121 does need to exist. To avoid confusion, division as defined by \"A\" / \"B\" = \"AB\"\u22121 is sometimes called \"right division\" or \"slash-division\" in this context.\nWith left and right division defined this way, \"A\" / (\"BC\") is in general not the same as (\"A\" / \"B\") / \"C\", nor is (\"AB\") \\ \"C\" the same as \"A\" \\ (\"B\" \\ \"C\"). However, it holds that \"A\" / (\"BC\") = (\"A\" / \"C\") / \"B\" and (\"AB\") \\ \"C\" = \"B\" \\ (\"A\" \\ \"C\").\nPseudoinverse.\nTo avoid problems when \"A\"\u22121 and/or \"B\"\u22121 do not exist, division can also be defined as multiplication by the pseudoinverse. That is, \"A\" / \"B\" = \"AB\"+ and \"A\" \\ \"B\" = \"A\"+\"B\", where \"A\"+ and \"B\"+ denote the pseudoinverses of A and B.\nAbstract algebra.\nIn abstract algebra, given a magma with binary operation \u2217 (which could nominally be termed multiplication), left division of \"b\" by \"a\" (written \"a\" \\ \"b\") is typically defined as the solution \"x\" to the equation \"a\" \u2217 \"x\" = \"b\", if this exists and is unique. Similarly, right division of \"b\" by \"a\" (written \"b\" / \"a\") is the solution \"y\" to the equation \"y\" \u2217 \"a\" = \"b\". Division in this sense does not require \u2217 to have any particular properties (such as commutativity, associativity, or an identity element). A magma for which both \"a\" \\ \"b\" and \"b\" / \"a\" exist and are unique for all \"a\" and all \"b\" (the Latin square property) is a quasigroup. In a quasigroup, division in this sense is always possible, even without an identity element and hence without inverses.\n\"Division\" in the sense of \"cancellation\" can be done in any magma by an element with the cancellation property. Examples include matrix algebras, quaternion algebras, and quasigroups. In an integral domain, where not every element need have an inverse, \"division\" by a cancellative element \"a\" can still be performed on elements of the form \"ab\" or \"ca\" by left or right cancellation, respectively. If a ring is finite and every nonzero element is cancellative, then by an application of the pigeonhole principle, every nonzero element of the ring is invertible, and \"division\" by any nonzero element is possible. To learn about when \"algebras\" (in the technical sense) have a division operation, refer to the page on division algebras. In particular Bott periodicity can be used to show that any real normed division algebra must be isomorphic to either the real numbers R, the complex numbers C, the quaternions H, or the octonions O.\nCalculus.\nThe derivative of the quotient of two functions is given by the quotient rule:\nformula_31\nDivision by zero.\nDivision of any number by zero in most mathematical systems is undefined, because zero multiplied by any finite number always results in the product being zero. Entry of such an expression into most calculators produces an error message. However, in certain mathematical structures, division by zero is possible, such as in the zero ring and in algebraic structures such as wheels. In these structures, the meaning of division is different from that of traditional definitions.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Special \"guard patterns\" (3 or 5 units wide, not encoding a digit) are intermixed to help decoding.\nA UPC (technically, a UPC-A) consists of 12 digits that are uniquely assigned to each trade item. The international GS1 organisation assigns the digits used for both the UPC and the related International Article Number (EAN) barcode. UPC data structures are a component of Global Trade Item Numbers (GTINs) and follow the global GS1 specification, which is based on international standards. Some retailers, such as clothing and furniture, do not use the GS1 system, instead using other barcode symbologies or article number systems. Some retailers use the EAN/UPC barcode symbology, but do not use a GTIN for products sold only in their own stores.\nResearch indicates that the adoption and diffusion of the UPC stimulated innovation and contributed to the growth of international retail supply chains.\nHistory.\nWallace Flint proposed an automated checkout system in 1932 using punched cards. Bernard Silver and Norman Joseph Woodland, a graduate student from Drexel Institute of Technology, developed a bull's-eye-style code and applied for the patent in 1949.\nIn the 1960s and early 1970s, railroads in North America experimented with multicolor bar codes for tracking railcars, but this system was eventually abandoned and replaced with a radio-based system called Automatic Equipment Identification (AEI).\nIn 1973, a group of trade associations from the grocery industry formed the Uniform Product Code Council (UPCC) which, with the help of consultants Larry Russell and Tom Wilson of McKinsey &amp; Company, defined the numerical format that formed the basis of the Uniform Product Code. Technology firms including Charegon, IBM, Litton-Zellweger, Pitney Bowes-Alpex, Plessey-Anker, RCA, Scanner Inc., Singer, and Dymo Industries/Data General, put forward alternative proposals for symbol representations to the council. The Symbol Selection Committee finally chose to implement the IBM proposal designed by George J. Laurer in the North Carolina Research Triangle Park but with a slight modification to the font in the human readable area.\nThe first UPC-marked item ever to be scanned at a retail checkout was a 10-pack (50 sticks) of Wrigley's Juicy Fruit chewing gum, purchased at the Marsh supermarket in Troy, Ohio, at 8:01\u00a0a.m. on 26 June 1974. The NCR cash register rang up 67 cents.\nThe shopping cart also contained other barcoded items but the gum was the first one picked up at the checkout. A facsimile of the gum packet went on display at the Smithsonian Institution's American history museum in Washington, D.C.\nMurray Eden was a consultant on the team that created the Universal Product Code barcode. As chairman of a committee of scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he helped\u00a0\"select a symbol that would endure the inevitable rush of technology that lay ahead.\" He chose the font, and he came up with the idea to add numbers to the bottom, which is a fail-safe system, in case the barcode reader is not working correctly.\nIBM proposal.\nAround late 1969, IBM at Research Triangle Park (RTP) in North Carolina assigned George Laurer to determine how to make a supermarket scanner and label. In late 1970, Heard Baumeister provided equations to calculate characters-per-inch achievable by two IBM bar codes, Delta A and Delta B. In February 1971, Baumeister joined Laurer.\nDelta B compared bar widths to space width to code bits. This was extremely sensitive to ink spread, where improper levels of ink or pressure would cause both edges of a bar to spread outward or shrink in.\nIn mid 1971, William \"Bill\" Crouse (9109301200) invented a new bar code called Delta C.\nIt achieved four times the characters per inch as Delta B.\nDelta C achieved its higher performance by only using leading to leading or trailing to trailing edges which was unaffected by uniform ink spread. The code provided best performance when it had a defined character set with a fixed reference distance that spanned most or preferably all the character.\nIn August 1971, Crouse joined the scanner effort. After several months they had made no progress. They were aware of the RCA bull's eye label that could be scanned with a simple straight line laser scanner, but a readable label was far too large.\nAlthough Litton Industries proposed a bull's eye symbol cut in half to reduce the area, it was still too large and presented the same ink smear printing problems as the RCA symbol. The redundancy and checking ability were removed completely. They were also aware of the many proposals from around the world, none of which were feasible.\nIn the spring of 1972, Baumeister announced a breakthrough. He proposed a label with bars that were slightly longer than the distance across all bars that needed to be read in a single pass. This label could be scanned with a simple \"X\" scanner only slightly more complex than the straight line laser scanner. The next day Baumeister suggested if the label were split into two halves the bar lengths could be cut nearly in half.\nThese two proposals reduced the area from the bull's eye by one third and then one sixth. The image to the right shows the label proposed by Baumeister. He did not specify any specific bar code as that was well understood. Except for the bar coding and ten digits the UPC label today is his proposal. Shortly after that Baumeister transferred to another area of RTP.\nLaurer proceeded to define the details of the label and write a proposal. N.J. Woodland was assigned as planner for the project and aided Laurer with writing his proposal.\nLaurer's first attempt with a bar code used Delta B. The resulting label size was about six inches by three inches which was too large. Crouse suggested that Laurer use his Delta C bar code and provided a copy of his patent that had a sample alphanumeric character set and rules to generate other size alphabets. This reduced the label size to about .\nLater Laurer asked Crouse for assistance in how the scanner could detect a label. Together they defined guard bars and a definition of how to detect the label. The guard bars also provided identification for half label discrimination and training bars for the scanner threshold circuits. Laurer had a complete label definition and proceeded to write his proposal.\nPreviously Crouse had an idea for a simple wand worn like a ring and bracelet. He decided to develop that wand to provide a demonstration of the label.\nOn 1 December 1972, IBM presented Laurer's proposal to the Super Market Committee in Rochester, Minnesota, the location where IBM would develop the scanner. During the presentation, Crouse gave a lab demonstration where he read UPC-like labels with his ring wand. In addition to reading regular labels, he read the large two-page centerfold label in the proposal booklet. He then turned to a page showing a photo of labeled items sitting on a table. The labels were small and flawed due to the resolution of the printed photo but the wand read many of them. This demonstration showed the robustness of the pure Delta C code. The proposal was accepted.\nOne month later, 1 January 1973 Crouse transferred back to IBM's Advanced Technology group, and Laurer remained with the full responsibility for the label.\nDymo Industries, makers of handheld printing devices insisted that the code be character independent, so that handheld printing devices could produce the bar code in store if the items were not bar-coded by the manufacturers. Dymo's proposal was accepted by IBM and incorporated in IBM's latest proposal.\nIt was decided that the two halves of the label should have a different set of numeric characters. The character set Laurer derived from the Delta C patent used seven printable increments or units where two bars and two spaces would be printed. This yielded twenty combinations of characters, but there were two pairs that when read by Delta C rules yielded the same code for the pair.\nSince eighteen characters were not enough Laurer tried adding one unit to the character set. This yielded twenty-six Delta C characters which could provide the two sets of decimal characters but it also added fourteen percent to the width of the label and thereby the height. This would be a thirty percent increase in area or a label of . Laurer felt this was not acceptable.\nLaurer returned to the original character set with twenty characters but four of those were two pairs with the same Delta C reading. He decided to use them all. To distinguish between the pairs he would measure one bar width in each of the pairs to distinguish them from each other. For each pair those bars would be one or two units wide.\nLaurer did not apply Baumeister's equations to this set. He felt just one bar width measurement would not be too serious. As it turned out it would have required over fifty percent increase in width and height for an area increase of more than double. Laurer later admitted these four characters in each set were responsible for most of the scanner read errors.\nDavid Savir, a mathematician, was given the task of proving the symbol could be printed and would meet the reliability requirements, and was most likely unaware of Baumeister's equations. He and Laurer added two more digits to the ten for error detection and correction.\nThen they decided to add odd/even parity to the number of units filled with bars in each side. Odd/even parity is a technique used to detect any odd number of bit errors in a bit stream. They decided to use odd on one half and even on the other. This would provide additional indication of which half ticket was being read. This meant that every bar width had to be read accurately to provide a good reading. It also meant every space would also be known.\nRequiring every bit width to be read precisely basically nullified the Delta C advantage except for the Delta C reference measurement. Only the strange character set and the size of the label remains as a shadow of the Delta C code. The size was still that calculated for pure Delta C. If the label size had been properly recalculated, taking into account the required bar width measurements the label would have been far too large to be acceptable.\nMechanical engineering and electronic circuit design commonly require worst case designs using known tolerances. Many engineers working with bar codes had little experience with such things and used somewhat intuitive methods. This was the cause of the poor performance of the Delta B code and quite likely the failure of RCA's bull's eye scanner.\nThe following table shows the workable labels, available in the early 1970s, with their sizes.\nThis is assuming a bull's eye with the same information and reliable readability.\nComposition.\nEach UPC-A barcode consists of a scannable strip of black bars and white spaces above a sequence of 12 numerical digits. No alphabetic characters, symbols, or other characters of any kind can appear on a UPC-A barcode. There is a one-to-one correspondence between 12-digit number and strip of black bars and white spaces, i.e. there is only one way to represent each 12-digit number visually and there is only one way to represent each strip of black bars and white spaces numerically.\nThe scannable area of every UPC-A barcode follows the pattern SLLLLLLMRRRRRRE, where S (start), M (middle), and E (end) guard patterns are represented the same way on every UPC-A barcode and the L (left) and R (right) sections collectively represent the 12 numerical digits that make each UPC-A unique. The first digit L indicates a particular number system to be used by the following digits. The last digit R is an error detecting check digit, that allows some errors to be detected in scanning or manual entry. The guard patterns separate the two groups of six numerical digits and establish the timing.\nFormatting.\nUPC-A barcodes can be printed at various densities to accommodate a variety of printing and scanning processes. The significant dimensional parameter is called x-dimension (width of single module element). The width of each bar (space) is determined by multiplying the x-dimension and the module width (1, 2, 3, or 4 units) of each bar (space). Since the guard patterns each include two bars, and each of the 12 digits of the UPC-A barcode consists of two bars and two spaces, all UPC-A barcodes consist of exactly (3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02)\u00a0+\u00a0(12\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02)\u00a0=\u00a030 bars, of which 6 represent guard patterns and 24 represent numerical digits.\nThe x-dimension for the UPC-A at the nominal size is 0.33\u00a0mm (0.013\"). Nominal symbol height for UPC-A is 25.9\u00a0mm (1.02\"). The bars forming the S (start), M (middle), and E (end) guard patterns, are extended downwards by 5 times x-dimension, with a resulting nominal symbol height of 27.55\u00a0mm (1.08\"). This also applies to the bars of the first and last numerical digit of UPC-A barcode. UPC-A can be reduced or magnified anywhere from 80% to 200%.\nA quiet zone, with a width of at least 9 times the x-dimension, must be present on each side of the scannable area of the UPC-A barcode. For a GTIN-12 number encoded in a UPC-A barcode, the first and last digits of the human-readable interpretation are always placed outside the symbol in order to indicate the quiet zones that are necessary for UPC barcode scanners to work properly.\nEncoding.\nThe UPC-A barcode is visually represented by strips of bars and spaces that encode the UPC-A 12-digit number. Each digit is represented by a unique pattern of 2 bars and 2 spaces. The bars and spaces are variable width, i.e. 1, 2, 3, or 4 modules wide. The total width for a digit is always 7 modules; consequently, UPC-A 12-digit number requires a total of 7\u00d712 \n 84 modules.\nA complete UPC-A is 95 modules wide: 84 modules for the digits (L and R sections) combined with 11 modules for the S (start), M (middle), and E (end) guard patterns. The S (start) and E (end) guard patterns are 3 modules wide and use the pattern \"bar-space-bar\", where each bar and space is one module wide. The M (middle) guard pattern is 5 modules wide and uses the pattern \"space-bar-space-bar-space\", where each bar and space is also one module wide. In addition, a UPC-A symbol requires a quiet zone (extra space of 9 modules wide) before the S (start) and after the E (end) guard patterns.\nThe UPC-A's left-hand side digits (the digits to the left of the M (middle) guard pattern) have odd parity, which means the total width of the black bars is an odd number of modules. On the contrary, the right-hand side digits have even parity. Consequently, a UPC scanner can determine whether it is scanning a symbol from left-to-right or from right-to-left (the symbol is upside-down). After seeing a S (start) or E (end) guard pattern (they are the same, \"bar-space-bar\", whichever direction they are read), the scanner will first see odd parity digits, if scanning left-to-right, or even parity digits, if scanning right-to-left. With the parity/direction information, an upside-down symbol will not confuse the scanner. When confronted with an upside-down symbol, the scanner may simply ignore it (many scanners alternate left-to-right and right-to-left scans, so they will read the symbol on a subsequent pass) or recognize the digits and put them in the right order. There is another property in the digit encoding. The right-hand side digits are the optical inverse of the left-hand side digits, i.e. black bars are turned into white spaces and vice versa. For example, the left-hand side \"4\" is space\u00d71 - bar\u00d71 - space\u00d73 - bar\u00d72, meanwhile the right-hand side \"4\" is bar\u00d71 - space\u00d71 - bar\u00d73 - space\u00d72.\nNumbering.\nThe number of UPC-A and UPC-E barcodes are limited by the standards used to create them.\nNumber system digit.\nBelow is a description of all possible number systems with the corresponding 12-digit UPC-A numbering scheme LLLLLLRRRRRR, where L denotes the numbering system digit and R the check digit.\nCheck digit calculation.\nThe UPC includes a check digit to detect common data entry errors. For example, UPC-A codes choose the check digit formula_3 to satisfy the \"check digit equation\":\nformula_4\nIf an entered code does not satisfy the equation, then it is not a valid UPC-A.\nThe UPC-A check digit may be calculated as follows:\nFor example, in a UPC-A barcode \"03600029145\"x\"12\", where \"x\"12 is the unknown check digit, \"x\"12 may be calculated by:\nThus, the check digit \"x\"12 is 2.\nThe check digit equation is selected to have reasonable error detection properties (see Luhn algorithm).\nHere is the \"Table of d-transpositions for UPC-A barcodes\", where formula_8\nRow Sum contains the number of \"d\"-transpositions, therefore the proportion of non-detectable transposition errors is (ignoring the transpositions where \"d\" = 0):\nformula_9\nVariations.\nUPC in its most common usage technically refers to UPC-A.\nOther variants of the UPC exist:\nUPC-E.\nTo allow the use of UPC barcodes on smaller packages, where a full 12-digit barcode may not fit, a zero-suppressed version of UPC was developed, called UPC-E, in which the number system digit, all trailing zeros in the manufacturer code, and all leading zeros in the product code, are suppressed (omitted). This symbology differs from UPC-A in that it only uses a 6-digit code, does not use M (middle) guard pattern, and the E (end) guard pattern is formed as \"space-bar-space-bar-space-bar\", i.e. UPC-E barcode follows the pattern SDDDDDDE. The way in which a 6-digit UPC-E relates to a 12-digit UPC-A, is determined by UPC-E numerical pattern and UPC-E parity pattern. It can only correspond to UPC-A number system 0 or 1, the value of which, along with the UPC-A check digit, determines the UPC-E parity pattern of the encoding. With the manufacturer code digits represented by M's, and product code digits by P's, then:\nFor example, a UPC-E 654321 may correspond to the UPC-A 065100004327 or 165100004324, depending on the UPC-E parity pattern of the encoded digits, as described next:\nUPC-E 654321 with \"EOEOEO\" parity pattern (UPC-A 065100004327) would be encoded as\n1-1-1 \u00a04-1-1-1 \u00a01-2-3-1 \u00a02-3-1-1 \u00a01-4-1-1 \u00a02-2-1-2 \u00a02-2-2-1 \u00a01-1-1-1-1-1.\nThe barcode would look like this:\nEAN-13.\nThe EAN-13 was developed as a superset of UPC-A, adding an extra digit to the beginning of every UPC-A number. This expanded the number of unique values theoretically possible by ten times to 1 trillion. EAN-13 barcodes also indicate the country in which the company that sells the product is based (which may or may not be the same as the country in which the good is manufactured). The three leading digits of the code determine this, according to the GS1 country codes. Every UPC-A code can be easily converted to the equivalent EAN-13 code by prepending 0 digit to the UPC-A code. This does not change the check digit. All point-of-sale systems can now understand both equally.\nEAN-8 is an 8-digit variation of the EAN barcode.\nUPC usage notes:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It occurs in the definitions of the kelvin (K) and the molar gas constant, in Planck's law of black-body radiation and Boltzmann's entropy formula, and is used in calculating thermal noise in resistors. The Boltzmann constant has dimensions of energy divided by temperature, the same as entropy and heat capacity. It is named after the Austrian scientist Ludwig Boltzmann.\nAs part of the 2019 revision of the SI, the Boltzmann constant is one of the seven \"defining constants\" that have been defined so as to have exact finite decimal values in SI units. They are used in various combinations to define the seven SI base units. The Boltzmann constant is defined to be exactly joules per kelvin, with the effect of defining the SI unit kelvin.\nRoles of the Boltzmann constant.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n IUPAC definition\nBoltzmann constant: The Boltzmann constant, \"k\", is one of seven fixed constants defining the International System of Units, the SI, with \"k\" =. The Boltzmann constant is a proportionality constant between the quantities temperature (with unit kelvin) and energy (with unit joule). \nMacroscopically, the ideal gas law states that, for an ideal gas, the product of pressure p and volume V is proportional to the product of amount of substance n and absolute temperature T:\nformula_1\nwhere R is the molar gas constant (). Introducing the Boltzmann constant as the gas constant per molecule \"k\" = \"R\"/\"N\"A (\"N\"A being the Avogadro constant) transforms the ideal gas law into an alternative form:\nformula_2\nwhere N is the number of molecules of gas.\nRole in the equipartition of energy.\nGiven a thermodynamic system at an absolute temperature T, the average thermal energy carried by each microscopic degree of freedom in the system is \u00a0\"kT\" (i.e., about , or , at room temperature). This is generally true only for classical systems with a large number of particles.\nIn classical statistical mechanics, this average is predicted to hold exactly for homogeneous ideal gases. Monatomic ideal gases (the six noble gases) possess three degrees of freedom per atom, corresponding to the three spatial directions. According to the equipartition of energy this means that there is a thermal energy of \u00a0\"kT\" per atom. This corresponds very well with experimental data. The thermal energy can be used to calculate the root-mean-square speed of the atoms, which turns out to be inversely proportional to the square root of the atomic mass. The root mean square speeds found at room temperature accurately reflect this, ranging from for helium, down to for xenon.\nKinetic theory gives the average pressure p for an ideal gas as\nformula_3\nCombination with the ideal gas law\nformula_4\nshows that the average translational kinetic energy is\nformula_5\nConsidering that the translational motion velocity vector v has three degrees of freedom (one for each dimension) gives the average energy per degree of freedom equal to one third of that, i.e. \u00a0\"kT\".\nThe ideal gas equation is also obeyed closely by molecular gases; but the form for the heat capacity is more complicated, because the molecules possess additional internal degrees of freedom, as well as the three degrees of freedom for movement of the molecule as a whole. Diatomic gases, for example, possess a total of six degrees of simple freedom per molecule that are related to atomic motion (three translational, two rotational, and one vibrational). At lower temperatures, not all these degrees of freedom may fully participate in the gas heat capacity, due to quantum mechanical limits on the availability of excited states at the relevant thermal energy per molecule.\nRole in Boltzmann factors.\nMore generally, systems in equilibrium at temperature T have probability \"P\"\"i\" of occupying a state i with energy E weighted by the corresponding Boltzmann factor:\nformula_6\nwhere Z is the partition function. Again, it is the energy-like quantity \"kT\" that takes central importance.\nConsequences of this include (in addition to the results for ideal gases above) the Arrhenius equation in chemical kinetics.\nRole in the statistical definition of entropy.\nIn statistical mechanics, the entropy S of an isolated system at thermodynamic equilibrium is defined as the natural logarithm of W, the number of distinct microscopic states available to the system given the macroscopic constraints (such as a fixed total energy E):\nformula_7\nThis equation, which relates the microscopic details, or microstates, of the system (via W) to its macroscopic state (via the entropy S), is the central idea of statistical mechanics. Such is its importance that it is inscribed on Boltzmann's tombstone.\nThe constant of proportionality k serves to make the statistical mechanical entropy equal to the classical thermodynamic entropy of Clausius:\nformula_8\nAt the standard state temperature of , it is approximately . The thermal voltage is also important in plasmas and electrolyte solutions (e.g. the Nernst equation); in both cases it provides a measure of how much the spatial distribution of electrons or ions is affected by a boundary held at a fixed voltage.\nHistory.\nThe Boltzmann constant is named after its 19th century Austrian discoverer, Ludwig Boltzmann. Although Boltzmann first linked entropy and probability in 1877, the relation was never expressed with a specific constant until Max Planck first introduced k, and gave a more precise value for it (, about 2.5% lower than today's figure), in his derivation of the law of black-body radiation in 1900\u20131901. Before 1900, equations involving Boltzmann factors were not written using the energies per molecule and the Boltzmann constant, but rather using a form of the gas constant R, and macroscopic energies for macroscopic quantities of the substance. The iconic terse form of the equation \"S\" = \"k\" ln \"W\" on Boltzmann's tombstone is in fact due to Planck, not Boltzmann. Planck actually introduced it in the same work as his eponymous h.\nIn 1920, Planck wrote in his Nobel Prize lecture:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;This constant is often referred to as Boltzmann's constant, although, to my knowledge, Boltzmann himself never introduced it\u2014a peculiar state of affairs, which can be explained by the fact that Boltzmann, as appears from his occasional utterances, never gave thought to the possibility of carrying out an exact measurement of the constant.\nThis \"peculiar state of affairs\" is illustrated by reference to one of the great scientific debates of the time. There was considerable disagreement in the second half of the nineteenth century as to whether atoms and molecules were real or whether they were simply a heuristic tool for solving problems. There was no agreement whether \"chemical\" molecules, as measured by atomic weights, were the same as \"physical\" molecules, as measured by kinetic theory. Planck's 1920 lecture continued:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Nothing can better illustrate the positive and hectic pace of progress which the art of experimenters has made over the past twenty years, than the fact that since that time, not only one, but a great number of methods have been discovered for measuring the mass of a molecule with practically the same accuracy as that attained for a planet.\nIn versions of SI prior to the 2019 revision of the SI, the Boltzmann constant was a measured quantity rather than having a fixed numerical value. Its exact definition also varied over the years due to redefinitions of the kelvin (see ') and other SI base units (see ').\nIn 2017, the most accurate measures of the Boltzmann constant were obtained by acoustic gas thermometry, which determines the speed of sound of a monatomic gas in a triaxial ellipsoid chamber using microwave and acoustic resonances. This decade-long effort was undertaken with different techniques by several laboratories; it is one of the cornerstones of the revision of the SI. Based on these measurements, the value of was recommended as the final fixed value of the Boltzmann constant to be used for the 2019 revision of the SI.\nAs a precondition for redefining the Boltzmann constant, there must be one experimental value with a relative uncertainty below 1 ppm, and at least one measurement from a second technique with a relative uncertainty below 3\u00a0ppm. The acoustic gas thermometry reached 0.2\u00a0ppm, and Johnson noise thermometry reached 2.8\u00a0ppm.\nValue in different units.\nSince k is a proportionality constant between temperature and energy, its numerical value depends on the choice of units for energy and temperature. The small numerical value of the Boltzmann constant in SI units means a change in temperature by 1\u00a0K changes a particle's energy by only a small amount. A change of is defined to be the same as a change of . The characteristic energy \"kT\" is a term encountered in many physical relationships.\nThe Boltzmann constant sets up a relationship between wavelength and temperature (dividing \"hc\"/\"k\" by a wavelength gives a temperature) with being related to , and also a relationship between voltage and temperature, with one volt corresponding to .\nNatural units.\nThe Boltzmann constant provides a mapping from the characteristic microscopic energy E to the macroscopic temperature scale \"T\" =. In fundamental physics, this mapping is often simplified by using the natural units of setting k to unity. This convention means that temperature and energy quantities have the same dimensions. In particular, the SI unit kelvin becomes superfluous, being defined in terms of joules as 1 K =. With this convention, temperature is always given in units of energy, and the Boltzmann constant is not explicitly needed in formulas.\nThis convention simplifies many physical relationships and formulas. For example, the equipartition formula for the energy associated with each classical degree of freedom becomes\nformula_9\nAs another example, the definition of thermodynamic entropy coincides with the form of information entropy:\nformula_10\nwhere \"P\"\"i\" is the probability of each microstate.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He signed a number of criminal orders and directives that led to numerous war crimes.\nKeitel's rise to the high command began with his appointment as the head of the Armed Forces Office at the Reich Ministry of War in 1935. Having taken command of the in 1938, Adolf Hitler replaced the ministry with the OKW and Keitel became its chief. He was reviled among his military colleagues as Hitler's habitual \"yes-man\".\nAfter the war, Keitel was indicted by the International Military Tribunal in Nuremberg as one of the \"major war criminals\". He was found guilty on all counts of the indictment: crimes against humanity, crimes against peace, criminal conspiracy, and war crimes. He was sentenced to death and executed by hanging in 1946.\nEarly life and career.\nWilhelm Keitel was born in the village of Helmscherode near Gandersheim in the Duchy of Brunswick, Germany. He was the eldest son of Carl Keitel (1854\u20131934), a middle-class landowner, and his wife Apollonia Vissering (1855\u20131888). As a youngster his main interests were hunting and riding horses, hobbies which he pursued also later in life. He was also interested in farming and wanted to take over his family's estates after completing his education at a gymnasium. This plan failed as his father did not want to retire. Instead, he embarked on a military career in 1901, becoming an officer cadet of the Prussian Army. As a commoner, he did not join the cavalry, but a field artillery regiment in Wolfenb\u00fcttel, serving as adjutant from 1908. On 18 April 1909, Keitel married Lisa Fontaine, a wealthy landowner's daughter at W\u00fclfel near Hanover.\nKeitel was tall, later described as a solidly built and square-jawed Prussian.\nDuring World War I, Keitel served on the Western Front and took part in the fighting in Flanders, where he was severely wounded. After being promoted to captain, Keitel was posted to the staff of an infantry division in 1915. After the war, Keitel was retained in the newly created \"Reichswehr\" of the Weimar Republic and played a part in organizing the paramilitary \"Freikorps\" units on the Polish border. In 1924, Keitel was transferred to the Ministry of the Reichswehr in Berlin, serving with the \"Truppenamt\" ('Troop Office'), the post-Versailles disguised German General Staff. Three years later, he returned to field command.\nNow a lieutenant-colonel, Keitel was again assigned to the war ministry in 1929 and was soon promoted to Head of the Organizational Department (\"T-2\"), a post he held until Adolf Hitler took power in 1933. Playing a vital role in the German rearmament, he traveled at least once to the Soviet Union to inspect secret \"Reichswehr\" training camps. In the autumn of 1932, he suffered a heart attack and double pneumonia. Shortly after his recovery, in October 1933, Keitel was appointed as deputy commander of the 3rd Infantry Division; in 1934, he was given command of the 22nd Infantry Division at Bremen.\nRise to the \"Wehrmacht\" High Command.\nIn 1935, at the recommendation of General Werner von Fritsch, Keitel was promoted to the rank of major general and appointed chief of the Reich Ministry of War's Armed Forces Office (\"Wehrmachtsamt\"), which oversaw the army, navy, and air force. After assuming office, Keitel was promoted to lieutenant general on 1 January 1936.\nOn 21 January 1938, Keitel received evidence revealing that the wife of his superior, War Minister Werner von Blomberg, was a former prostitute. Upon reviewing this information, Keitel suggested that the dossier be forwarded to Hitler's deputy, Hermann G\u00f6ring, who used it to bring about Blomberg's resignation.\nHitler took command of the \"Wehrmacht\" in 1938 and replaced the war ministry with the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces (\"Oberkommando der Wehrmacht\"), with Keitel as its chief. As a result of his appointment, Keitel assumed the responsibilities of Germany's war minister. Although not officially appointed a \"Reichsminister\", Keitel was granted cabinet-level rank. When von Blomberg was asked by Hitler (out of respect for him, after his dismissal in 1938) who he would recommend to replace him, he had said that Hitler himself should take over the job. He told Hitler that Keitel (who was his son-in-law's father) \"is just the man who runs my office\". Hitler snapped his fingers and exclaimed \"That's exactly the man I'm looking for\". So on 4 February 1938 when Hitler became Commander-in-Chief of the \"Wehrmacht\", Keitel (to the astonishment of the General Staff, including himself) became chief of staff.\nSoon after his promotion, Keitel convinced Hitler to appoint Walther von Brauchitsch as Commander-in-Chief of the Army, replacing von Fritsch. Keitel was promoted to \"Generaloberst\" (Colonel General) in November 1938, and in April 1939 he was awarded the Golden Party Badge by Hitler.\nCriticism of capabilities.\nField Marshal Ewald von Kleist labelled Keitel nothing more than a \"stupid follower of Hitler\" because of his servile \"yes man\" attitude toward Hitler. His sycophancy was well known in the army, and he acquired the nickname 'Lakeitel', a pun derived from (\"lackey\") and his surname. Hermann G\u00f6ring's description of Keitel as having \"a sergeant's mind inside a field marshal's body\" was a feeling often expressed by his peers. He had been promoted because of his willingness to function as Hitler's mouthpiece. He was known by his peers as a \"blindingly loyal toady\" of Hitler, nicknamed \"Nickgeselle\", after a popular metal toy nodding donkey, the \"Nickesel\". During the war he was subject to verbal abuse from Hitler, who said to other officers (according to Gerd von Rundstedt) that \"you know he has the brains of a movie usher ... (but he was made the highest ranking officer in the Army) ... because the man's as loyal as a dog\" (said by Hitler with a sly smile).\nKeitel was predisposed to manipulation because of his limited intellect and nervous disposition; Hitler valued his diligence and obedience. On one occasion, \"Generalleutnant\" Burkhart M\u00fcller-Hillebrand asked who Keitel was: upon finding out he became horrified at his own failure to salute his superior. Franz Halder, however, told him: \"Don't worry, it's only Keitel\". German officers consistently bypassed him and went directly to Hitler.\nWorld War II.\nOn 30 August 1939, immediately prior to the outbreak of the Second World War, Keitel was appointed by Hitler to the six-person Council of Ministers for the Defense of the Reich which was set up to operate as a \"war cabinet\". After Germany defeated France in the Battle of France in six weeks, Keitel described Hitler as \"the greatest warlord of all time\". Keitel conducted the negotiations of the French armistice, and on 19 July 1940 was promoted to \"Generalfeldmarschall\" (field marshal).\nThe planning for Operation Barbarossa, the 1941 invasion of the Soviet Union, was begun tentatively by Halder with the redeployment of the 18th Army into an offensive position against the Soviet Union. On 31 July 1940, Hitler held a major conference that included Keitel, Halder, Alfred Jodl, Erich Raeder, Brauchitsch, and Hans Jeschonnek which further discussed the invasion. The participants did not object to the invasion. Hitler asked for war studies to be completed and Georg Thomas was given the task of completing two studies on economic matters. The first study by Thomas detailed serious problems with fuel and rubber supplies. Keitel bluntly dismissed the problems, telling Thomas that Hitler would not want to see it. This influenced Thomas' second study which offered a glowing recommendation for the invasion based upon fabricated economic benefits.\nIn January 1943, just before the final surrender at Stalingrad, Hitler agreed to the creation of a three-man committee with representatives of the State, the Armed Forces High Command, and the Party in an attempt to centralize control of the war economy and over the home front. The committee members were Keitel, (Chief of OKW) Hans Lammers (Chief of the Reich Chancellery), and Martin Bormann (Chief of the Party Chancellery). The committee, soon known as the \"Dreierausschu\u00df\" (Committee of Three), met eleven times between January and August 1943. However, it had little autonomy, with Hitler reserving most of the final decisions to himself. In addition, it ran up against resistance from cabinet ministers, who headed deeply entrenched spheres of influence and, seeing it as a threat to their power, worked together to undermine it. The result was that nothing changed, and the Committee declined into irrelevance.\nKeitel played an important role after the failed 20 July plot in 1944. He sat on the army \"court of honour\" that handed over many officers who were involved, including Field Marshal Erwin von Witzleben, to Roland Freisler's notorious People's Court. Around 7,000 people were arrested, many of whom were tortured by the Gestapo, and around 5,000 were executed.\nIn April and May 1945, during the Battle of Berlin, Keitel called for counterattacks to drive back the Soviet forces and relieve Berlin. However, there were insufficient German forces to carry out such counterattacks. After Hitler's suicide on 30 April, Keitel stayed on as a member of the short-lived Flensburg Government under Grand Admiral Karl D\u00f6nitz. Upon arriving in Flensburg, Albert Speer, the Minister of Armaments and War Production, said that Keitel grovelled to D\u00f6nitz in the same way as he had done to Hitler. On 7 May 1945, Alfred Jodl, on behalf of D\u00f6nitz, signed Germany's unconditional surrender on all fronts. Joseph Stalin considered this an affront, so a second signing was arranged at the Berlin suburb of Karlshorst on 8 May. There, Keitel signed the German Instrument of Surrender on 8 May 1945. Five days later on 13 May, he was arrested at the request of the United States and interned at Camp Ashcan in Mondorf-les-Bains. Jodl succeeded him as Chief of OKW until the final dissolution of the Flensburg Government on 23 May.\nRole in crimes of the \"Wehrmacht\" and the Holocaust.\nKeitel had full knowledge of the criminal nature of the planning and the subsequent invasion of Poland, agreeing to its aims in principle. The Nazi plans included mass arrests, population transfers, and mass murder. Keitel did not contest the regime's assault upon basic human rights or counter the role of the \"Einsatzgruppen\" in the murders. The criminal nature of the invasion was now obvious; local commanders continued to express shock and protest over the events they were witnessing. Keitel continued to ignore the protests among the officer corps while they became morally numbed to the atrocities.\nKeitel issued a series of criminal orders from April 1941. The orders went beyond established codes of conduct for the military and broadly allowed the execution of Jews, civilians, and non-combatants for any reason. Those carrying out the murders were exempted from court-martial or later being tried for war crimes. The orders were signed by Keitel; however, other members of the OKW and the OKH, including Halder, wrote or changed the wording of his orders. Commanders in the field interpreted and carried out the orders.\nIn the summer and autumn of 1941, German military lawyers unsuccessfully argued that Soviet prisoners of war should be treated in accordance with the Geneva Conventions. Keitel rebuffed them, writing: \"These doubts correspond to military ideas about wars of chivalry. Our job is to suppress a way of life.\" In September 1941, concerned that some field commanders on the Eastern Front did not exhibit sufficient harshness in implementing the May 1941 order on the \"Guidelines for the Conduct of the Troops in Russia\", Keitel issued a new order, writing: \"[The] struggle against Bolshevism demands ruthless and energetic action especially also against the Jews, the main carriers of Bolshevism\". Also in September, Keitel issued an order to all commanders, not just those in the occupied Soviet Union, instructing them to use \"unusual severity\" to stamp out resistance. In this context, the guideline stated that execution of 50 to 100 \"Communists\" was an appropriate response to a loss of a German soldier. Such orders and directives further radicalised the army's occupational policies and enmeshed it in the genocide of the Jews.\nIn December 1941, Hitler instructed the OKW to subject, with the exception of Denmark, Western Europe (which was under military occupation) to the Night and Fog Decree. Signed by Keitel, the decree made it possible for foreign nationals to be transferred to Germany for trial by special courts, or simply handed to the Gestapo for deportation to concentration camps. The OKW further imposed a blackout on any information concerning the fate of the accused. At the same time, Keitel increased pressure on Otto von St\u00fclpnagel, the military commander in France, for a more ruthless reprisal policy in the country. In October 1942, Keitel signed the Commando Order that authorized the killing of enemy special operations troops even when captured in uniform.\nIn the spring and summer of 1942, as the deportations of the Jews to extermination camps progressed, the military initially protested when it came to the Jews that laboured for the benefit of the \"Wehrmacht\". The army lost control over the matter when the SS assumed command of all Jewish forced labour in July 1942. Keitel formally endorsed the state of affairs in September, reiterating for the armed forces that \"evacuation of the Jews must be carried out thoroughly and its consequences endured, despite any trouble it may cause over the next three or four months\".\nTrial, conviction, and execution.\nAfter the war, Keitel faced the International Military Tribunal (IMT), where he was examined by Chief Medical Officer Lt. Col. Rene Juchli who reported that Keitel was suffering from \"high blood pressure, varicose veins, and dysentery\". He was indicted on all four counts before the IMT: conspiracy to commit crimes against peace, planning, initiating and waging wars of aggression, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. Most of the case against him was based on his signature being present on dozens of orders that called for soldiers and political prisoners to be killed or 'disappeared'. In court, Keitel admitted that he knew many of Hitler's orders were illegal. His defence relied almost entirely on the argument that he was merely following orders in conformity to \"the leader principle\" (\"F\u00fchrerprinzip\") and his personal oath of loyalty to Hitler.\nThe IMT rejected this defence and convicted him on all charges. Although the tribunal's charter allowed \"superior orders\" to be considered a mitigating factor, it found Keitel's crimes were so egregious that \"there is nothing in mitigation\". In its judgment against him, the IMT wrote, \"Superior orders, even to a soldier, cannot be considered in mitigation where crimes as shocking and extensive have been committed consciously, ruthlessly and without military excuse or justification.\" It also noted several instances where he issued illegal orders on his own authority.\nIn his statement before the Tribunal, Keitel said: \"As these atrocities developed, one from the other, step by step, and without any foreknowledge of the consequences, destiny took its tragic course, with its fateful consequences.\" To underscore the criminal rather than military nature of Keitel's acts, the Allies denied his request to be shot by firing squad. Instead, he was executed at Nuremberg Prison by hanging.\nOn the day of the execution, Keitel told prison chaplain Henry F. Gerecke \"You have helped me more than you know. May Christ, my saviour, stand by me all the way. I shall need him so much.\" He then received Communion and was executed later that day. Keitel was executed by US Army Master Sergeant John C. Woods. His last words were: \"I call on God Almighty to have mercy on the German people. More than two million German soldiers went to their death for the fatherland before me. I follow now my sons \u2013 all for Germany.\" The trap door was small, causing head injuries to Keitel and several other condemned men as they dropped. Many of the executed Nazis fell from the gallows with insufficient force to snap their necks, resulting in convulsions that in Keitel's case lasted 24 minutes. The corpses of Keitel and the other nine executed men were, like Hermann G\u00f6ring's, cremated at Ostfriedhof (Munich) and the ashes were scattered in the river Isar.\nWorks.\nBefore his execution, Keitel published his memoirs, which were titled in English as \"In the Service of the Reich\". It was later re-edited by Walter G\u00f6rlitz as \"The Memoirs of Field-Marshal Keitel\" (). Another work by Keitel later published in English was \"Questionnaire on the Ardennes Offensive\".\nFamily.\nKeitel was the uncle of Katherine \"Kitty\" Oppenheimer, wife of the physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, the director of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory, where the first atomic bombs were developed.\nLegacy.\nKeitel was frequently depicted in World War II films, such as by Dieter Mann in \"Downfall\" (2004). Notably, East German actor Gerd Michael Henneberg repeatedly reprised his role as Keitel in several Soviet-East German co-productions directed by Yuri Ozerov in the 1970s and 1980s, such as \"Soldiers of Freedom\" (1977), \"Battle of Moscow\" (1985) and \"Stalingrad\" (1990). He is also briefly depicted in the movie \"Valkyrie\" (2008) as played by Kenneth Cranham.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The TEU forms the basis of EU law, by setting out general principles of the EU's purpose, the governance of its central institutions (such as the Commission, Parliament, and Council), as well as the rules on external, foreign and security policy.\nHistory.\nWhile the current version of the TEU entered into force in 2009, following the Treaty of Lisbon (2007), the older form of the same document was implemented by the Maastricht Treaty (1992).\nProvisions.\nAfter the preamble the consolidated treaty text is divided into six parts.\nTitle I: Common Provisions.\nThe first deals with common provisions. Article 1 establishes the European Union, formally replacing the European Community, declares a \"process of creating an ever closer union among the peoples of Europe\", and lays out the legal value of the treaties. \nArticle 2 states that the EU is \"founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities\". The member states share a \"society in which pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men prevail\".\nArticle 3 then states the aims of the EU in six points. The first is simply to promote peace, European values and its citizens' well-being. The second relates to free movement with external border controls in place. Point 3 deals with the internal market. Point 4 establishes the euro. Point 5 states the EU shall promote its values, contribute to eradicating poverty, observe human rights and respect the charter of the United Nations. The final sixth point states that the EU shall pursue these objectives by \"appropriate means\" according with its competences given in the treaties.\nArticle 4 relates to member states' sovereignty and obligations. Article 5 sets out the principles of conferral, subsidiarity and proportionality with respect to the limits of its powers. Article 6 binds the EU to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the European Convention on Human Rights. Article 7 deals with the suspension of a member state and article 8 deals with establishing close relations with neighbouring states.\nTitle II: Provisions on democratic principles.\nArticle 9 establishes the equality of national citizens and citizenship of the European Union. Article 10 declares that the EU is founded in representative democracy and that decisions must be taken as closely as possible to citizens. It makes reference to European political parties and how citizens are represented: directly in the Parliament and by their governments in the Council and European Council \u2013 accountable to national parliaments. Article 11 establishes government transparency, declares that broad consultations must be made and introduces provision for a petition where at least 1 million citizens may petition the Commission to legislate on a matter. Article 12 gives national parliaments limited involvement in the legislative process.\nTitle III: Provisions on the institutions.\nArticle 13 establishes the institutions in the following order and under the following names: the European Parliament, the European Council, the Council, the European Commission, the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Central Bank and the Court of Auditors. It obliges co-operation between these and limits their competencies to the powers within the treaties.\nArticle 14 deals with the workings of Parliament and its election, article 15 with the European Council and its president, article 16 with the Council and its configurations and article 17 with the Commission and its appointment. Article 18 establishes the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and article 19 establishes the Court of Justice.\nTitle IV: Provisions on enhanced co-operation.\nTitle 4 has only one article which allows a limited number of member states to co-operate within the EU if others are blocking integration in that field.\nTitle V: General provisions on the Union's external action.\nChapter 1 of this title includes articles 21 and 22. Article 21 deals with the principles that outline EU foreign policy; including compliance with the UN charter, promoting global trade, humanitarian support and global governance. Article 22 gives the European Council, acting unanimously, control over defining the EU's foreign policy.\nChapter 2 is further divided into sections. The first, common provisions, details the guidelines and functioning of the EU's foreign policy, including establishment of the European External Action Service and member state's responsibilities. Section 2, articles 42 to 46, deal with military co-operation (including mutual defence).\nOn 17 November 2015, France called other member states for military assistance, on the basis of the Article 42. This was the first time the article had ever been applied and all of the member states were reported to respond in agreement. However at least one member state (Finland) made a conclusion that due to conflicting national law, military assistance was excluded.\nTitle VI: Final provisions.\nArticle 47 establishes a legal personality for the EU. Article 48 deals with the method of treaty amendment; specifically the ordinary and simplified revision procedures. Article 49 deals with applications to join the EU and Article 50 with withdrawal. In the aftermath of the Brexit vote in the UK on 23 June 2016, the United Kingdom formally invoked Article 50 in March 2017, giving notice that it would leave the EU within two years. Article 51 deals with the protocols attached to the treaties and article 52 with the geographic application of the treaty. Article 53 states the treaty is in force for an unlimited period, article 54 deals with ratification and 55 with the different language versions of the treaties.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was founded in 1960 by Raymond Queneau and Fran\u00e7ois Le Lionnais. Other notable members have included novelists Georges Perec and Italo Calvino, poets Oskar Pastior and Jean Lescure, and poet/mathematician Jacques Roubaud.\nThe group defines the term \"litt\u00e9rature potentielle\" as (rough translation): \"the seeking of new structures and patterns which may be used by writers in any way they enjoy\". Queneau described Oulipians as \"rats who construct the labyrinth from which they plan to escape.\"\nConstraints are used as a means of triggering ideas and inspiration, most notably Perec's \"story-making machine\", which he used in the construction of \"\". As well as established techniques, such as lipograms (Perec's novel \"A Void\") and palindromes, the group devises new methods, often based on mathematical problems, such as the knight's tour of the chessboard and permutations.\nHistory.\nOulipo was founded on November 24, 1960, as a subcommittee of the Coll\u00e8ge de 'Pataphysique and titled \"S\u00e9minaire de litt\u00e9rature exp\u00e9rimentale\". At their second meeting, the group changed its name to \"Ouvroir de litt\u00e9rature potentielle\", or Oulipo, at Albert-Marie Schmidt's suggestion. The idea had arisen two months earlier, when a small group met in September at Cerisy-la-Salle for a colloquium on Queneau's work. During this seminar, Queneau and Fran\u00e7ois Le Lionnais conceived the society.\nDuring the subsequent decade, Oulipo (as it was commonly known) was only rarely visible as a group. As a subcommittee, they reported their work to the full Coll\u00e8ge de 'Pataphysique in 1961. In addition, \"Temps M\u00eal\u00e9s\" devoted an issue to Oulipo in 1964, and Belgian radio broadcast one Oulipo meeting. Its members were individually active during these years and published works which were created within their constraints. The group as a whole began to emerge from obscurity in 1973 with the publication of \"La Litt\u00e9rature Potentielle\", a collection of representative pieces. Martin Gardner helped to popularize the group in America when he featured Oulipo in his February 1977 Mathematical Games column in Scientific American. In 2012 Harvard University Press published a history of the movement, \"Many Subtle Channels: In Praise of Potential Literature\", by Oulipo member Daniel Levin Becker.\nOulipo was founded by a group of men in 1960 and it took 15 years before the first woman was allowed to join; this was Mich\u00e8le M\u00e9tail who became a member in 1975 and has since distanced herself from the group. Since 1960 only six women have joined Oulipo, with Cl\u00e9mentine M\u00e9lois last to join in June 2017.\nOulipian works.\nSome examples of Oulipian writing:\nConstraints.\nSome Oulipian constraints:\nMembers.\nFounding members.\nThe founding members of Oulipo represented a range of intellectual pursuits, including writers, university professors, mathematicians, engineers, and \"pataphysicians.\"\nLiving members.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nDeceased members.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "53706", "revid": "45451381", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53706", "title": "Wage slavery", "text": "Dependence on wages to live\nWage slavery is a term used to criticize exploitation of labor by business. The situation of wage slavery can be loosely defined as a person's dependence on wages (or a salary) for their livelihood, especially when wages are low, treatment and conditions are poor, and there are few chances of upward mobility. \nThe term is often used by critics of wage-based employment to criticize the exploitation of labor and social stratification, with the former seen primarily as unequal bargaining power between labor and capital, particularly when workers are paid comparatively low wages, such as in sweatshops, and the latter is described as a lack of workers' self-management, fulfilling job choices, and leisure in an economy. The criticism of social stratification covers a wider range of employment choices bound by the pressures of a hierarchical society to perform otherwise unfulfilling work that deprives humans of their \"species character\" not only under threat of extreme poverty and starvation, but also of social stigma and status diminution. Historically, many socialist organizations and activists have espoused workers' self-management or worker cooperatives as possible alternatives to wage labor.\nSimilarities between wage labor and slavery were noted as early as Cicero in Ancient Rome, such as in \"De Officiis\". With the advent of the Industrial Revolution, thinkers such as Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Karl Marx elaborated the comparison between wage labor and slavery, and engaged in critique of work while Luddites emphasized the dehumanization brought about by machines. The introduction of wage labor in 18th-century Britain was met with resistance, giving rise to the principles of syndicalism and anarchism.\nBefore the American Civil War, Southern defenders of keeping African Americans in slavery invoked the concept of wage slavery to favourably compare the condition of their slaves to workers in the North. The United States abolished most forms of slavery after the Civil War, but labor union activists found the metaphor useful \u2013 according to historian Lawrence Glickman, in the 1870s through the 1890s \"[r]eferences abounded in the labor press, and it is hard to find a speech by a labor leader without the phrase\".\nHistory.\nThe view that working for wages is akin to slavery dates back to the ancient world. In ancient Rome, Cicero wrote that \"the very wage [wage labourers] receive is a pledge of their slavery\".\nIn 1763, the French journalist Simon Linguet published an influential description of wage slavery: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The slave was precious to his master because of the money he had cost him\u00a0... They were worth at least as much as they could be sold for in the market\u00a0... It is the impossibility of living by any other means that compels our farm labourers to till the soil whose fruits they will not eat and our masons to construct buildings in which they will not live\u00a0... It is want that compels them to go down on their knees to the rich man in order to get from him permission to enrich him\u00a0... what effective gain [has] the suppression of slavery brought [him ?] He is free, you say. Ah! That is his misfortune\u00a0... These men\u00a0... [have] the most terrible, the most imperious of masters, that is, need.\u00a0... They must therefore find someone to hire them, or die of hunger. Is that to be free?\nThe view that wage work has substantial similarities with chattel slavery was actively put forward in the late 18th and 19th centuries by defenders of chattel slavery (most notably in the Southern states of the United States) and by opponents of capitalism (who were also critics of chattel slavery). Some defenders of slavery, mainly from the Southern slave states, argued that Northern workers were \"free but in name \u2013 the slaves of endless toil\" and that their slaves were better off. This contention has been partly corroborated by some modern studies that indicate slaves' material conditions in the 19th century were \"better than what was typically available to free urban laborers at the time\". In this period, Henry David Thoreau wrote that \"[i]t is hard to have a Southern overseer; it is worse to have a Northern one; but worst of all when you are the slave-driver of yourself.\"\nAbolitionists in the United States criticized the analogy as spurious. They argued that wage workers were \"neither wronged nor oppressed\". Abraham Lincoln and the Republicans argued that the condition of wage workers was different from slavery as long as laborers were likely to develop the opportunity to work for themselves, achieving self-employment. The abolitionist and former slave Frederick Douglass initially declared \"now I am my own master\", upon taking a paying job. However, later in life he concluded to the contrary, saying \"experience demonstrates that there may be a slavery of wages only a little less galling and crushing in its effects than chattel slavery, and that this slavery of wages must go down with the other\". Douglass went on to speak about these conditions as arising from the unequal bargaining power between the ownership/capitalist class and the non-ownership/laborer class within a compulsory monetary market: No more crafty and effective devise for defrauding the southern laborers could be adopted than the one that substitutes orders upon shopkeepers for currency in payment of wages. It has the merit of a show of honesty, while it puts the laborer completely at the mercy of the land-owner and the shopkeeper.\nSelf-employment became less common as the artisan tradition slowly disappeared in the later part of the 19th century. In 1869, \"The New York Times\" described the system of wage labor as \"a system of slavery as absolute if not as degrading as that which lately prevailed at the South\". E. P. Thompson notes that for British workers at the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th centuries, the \"gap in status between a 'servant,' a hired wage-laborer subject to the orders and discipline of the master, and an artisan, who might 'come and go' as he pleased, was wide enough for men to shed blood rather than allow themselves to be pushed from one side to the other. And, in the value system of the community, those who resisted degradation were in the right\". A \"Member of the Builders' Union\" in the 1830s argued that the trade unions \"will not only strike for less work, and more wages, but will ultimately abolish wages, become their own masters and work for each other; labor and capital will no longer be separate but will be indissolubly joined together in the hands of workmen and work-women\". This perspective inspired the Grand National Consolidated Trades Union (UK) of 1834 which had the \"two-fold purpose of syndicalist unions \u2013 the protection of the workers under the existing system and the formation of the nuclei of the future society\" when the unions \"take over the whole industry of the country\". William Lazonick, summarized:Research has shown, that the 'free-born Englishman' of the eighteenth century \u2013 even those who, by force of circumstance, had to submit to agricultural wage labour \u2013 tenaciously resisted entry into the capitalist workshop.The use of the term \"wage slave\" by labor organizations may originate from the labor protests of the Lowell mill girls in 1836. The imagery of wage slavery was widely used by labor organizations during the mid-19th century to object to the lack of workers' self-management. However, it was gradually replaced by the more neutral term \"wage work\" towards the end of the 19th century as labor organizations shifted their focus to raising wages. Karl Marx described capitalist society as infringing on individual autonomy because it is based on a materialistic and commodified concept of the body and its liberty (i.e. as something that is sold, rented, or alienated in a class society). According to Friedrich Engels: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The slave is sold once and for all; the proletarian must sell himself daily and hourly. The individual slave, property of one master, is assured an existence, however miserable it may be, because of the master's interest. The individual proletarian, property as it were of the entire bourgeois class which buys his labor only when someone has need of it, has no secure existence.\nSimilarities of wage work with slavery.\nCritics of wage work have drawn several similarities between wage work and slavery:\nAccording to American anarcho-syndicalist philosopher Noam Chomsky, workers themselves noticed the similarities between chattel and wage slavery. Chomsky noted that the 19th-century Lowell mill girls, without any reported knowledge of European Marxism or anarchism, condemned the \"degradation and subordination\" of the newly emerging industrial system and the \"new spirit of the age: gain wealth, forgetting all but self\", maintaining that \"those who work in the mills should own them\". They expressed their concerns in a protest song during their 1836 strike:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDefenses of both wage labor and chattel slavery in the literature have linked the subjection of man to man with the subjection of man to nature \u2013 arguing that hierarchy and a social system's particular relations of production represent human nature and are no more coercive than the reality of life itself. According to this narrative, any well-intentioned attempt to fundamentally change the \"status quo\" is naively utopian and will result in more oppressive conditions. Bosses in both of these long-lasting systems argued that their respective systems created a lot of wealth and prosperity. In some sense, both did create jobs, and their investment entailed risk. For example, slave-owners risked losing money by buying chattel slaves who later became ill or died; while bosses risked losing money by hiring workers (wage slaves) to make products that did not sell well on the market. Marginally, both chattel and wage slaves may become bosses; sometimes by working hard. The \"rags to riches\" story occasionally comes to pass in capitalism; the \"slave to master\" story occurred in places like colonial Brazil, where slaves could buy their own freedom and become business owners, self-employed, or slave-owners themselves. Thus, critics of the concept of wage slavery do not regard social mobility, or the hard work and risk that it may entail, as a redeeming factor.\nAnthropologist David Graeber has noted that historically the first wage-labor contracts we know about \u2013 whether in ancient Greece or Rome, or in the Malay or in the Indian Ocean \u2013 were in fact contracts for the rental of chattel slaves (usually the owner would receive a share of the money and the slaves another, with which to maintain their living expenses). According to Graeber, such arrangements were quite common in New World slavery as well, whether in the United States or in Brazil. C. L. R. James (1901\u20131989) argued that most of the techniques of human organization employed on factory workers during the Industrial Revolution first developed on slave plantations.\nSubsequent work \"traces the innovations of modern management to the slave plantation\".\nChanges in the use of the term.\nAt the end of the 19th century, North American labor rhetoric turned towards consumerist and economics-based politics, from its previously radical, producerist vision. Whereas labor organizations once referred to powerless disenfranchisement from the rise of industrial capitalism as \"wage slavery\", the phrase had fallen out of favor by 1890 as those organizations adopted pragmatic politics and phrases like \"wage work\". American producerist labor politics emphasized the control of production conditions as being the guarantor of self-reliant, personal freedom. As factories began to bring artisans in-house by 1880, wage dependence replaced wage freedom as standard for skilled, unskilled, and unionized workers alike.\nAs Hallgrimsdottir and Benoit point out: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[I]ncreased centralization of production\u00a0... declining wages\u00a0... [an] expanding\u00a0... labor pool\u00a0... intensifying competition, and\u00a0... [t]he loss of competence and independence experienced by skilled labor\" meant that \"a critique that referred to all [wage] work as slavery and avoided demands for wage concessions in favor of supporting the creation of the producerist republic (by diverting strike funds towards funding\u00a0... co-operatives, for example) was far less compelling than one that identified the specific conditions of slavery as low wages\nIn more general English-language usage, the phrase \"wage slavery\" and its variants became more frequent in the 20th century.\nTreatment in various economic systems.\nSome anti-capitalist thinkers claim that the elite maintain wage slavery and a divided working class through their influence over the media and entertainment industry, educational institutions, unjust laws, nationalist and corporate propaganda, pressures and incentives to internalize values serviceable to the power structure, state violence, fear of unemployment, and a historical legacy of exploitation and profit accumulation/transfer under prior systems, which shaped the development of economic theory. Adam Smith noted that employers often conspire together to keep wages low and have the upper hand in conflicts between workers and employers:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The interest of the dealers\u00a0... in any particular branch of trade or manufactures, is always in some respects different from, and even opposite to, that of the public... [They] have generally an interest to deceive and even to oppress the public\u00a0... We rarely hear, it has been said, of the combinations of masters, though frequently of those of workmen. But whoever imagines, upon this account, that masters rarely combine, is as ignorant of the world as of the subject. Masters are always and everywhere in a sort of tacit, but constant and uniform combination, not to raise the wages of labor above their actual rate\u00a0... It is not, however, difficult to foresee which of the two parties must, upon all ordinary occasions, have the advantage in the dispute, and force the other into a compliance with their terms.\nCapitalism.\nThe concept of wage slavery could conceivably be traced back to pre-capitalist figures like Gerrard Winstanley from the radical Christian Diggers movement in England, who wrote in his 1649 pamphlet, \"The New Law of Righteousness\", that there \"shall be no buying or selling, no fairs nor markets, but the whole earth shall be a common treasury for every man\" and \"there shall be none Lord over others, but every one shall be a Lord of himself\".\nAristotle stated that \"the citizens must not live a mechanic or a mercantile life (for such a life is ignoble and inimical to virtue), nor yet must those who are to be citizens in the best state be tillers of the soil (for leisure is needed both for the development of virtue and for active participation in politics)\", often paraphrased as \"all paid jobs absorb and degrade the mind\". Cicero wrote in 44 BC that \"vulgar are the means of livelihood of all hired workmen whom we pay for mere manual labour, not for artistic skill; for in their case the very wage they receive is a pledge of their slavery\". Somewhat similar criticisms have also been expressed by some proponents of liberalism, like Silvio Gesell and Thomas Paine; Henry George, who inspired the economic philosophy known as Georgism; and the Distributist school of thought within the Catholic Church.\nTo Karl Marx and anarchist thinkers like Mikhail Bakunin and Peter Kropotkin, wage slavery was a class condition in place due to the existence of private property and the state. This class situation rested primarily on:\nAnd secondarily on:\nFascism.\nFascist economic policies were more hostile to independent trade unions than modern economies in Europe or the United States. Fascism was more widely accepted in the 1920s and 1930s, and foreign corporate investment (notably from the United States) in Germany increased after the fascists took power.\nFascism has been perceived by some notable critics, like Buenaventura Durruti, to be a last resort weapon of the privileged to ensure the maintenance of wage slavery: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;No government fights fascism to destroy it. When the bourgeoisie sees that power is slipping out of its hands, it brings up fascism to hold onto their privileges.\nPsychological effects.\nAccording to Noam Chomsky, analysis of the psychological implications of wage slavery goes back to the Enlightenment era. In his 1791 book \"The Limits of State Action\", classical liberal thinker Wilhelm von Humboldt explained how \"whatever does not spring from a man's free choice, or is only the result of instruction and guidance, does not enter into his very nature; he does not perform it with truly human energies, but merely with mechanical exactness\" and so when the laborer works under external control, \"we may admire what he does, but we despise what he is\". Because they explore human authority and obedience, both the Milgram and Stanford experiments have been found useful in the psychological study of wage-based workplace relations.\nSelf-identity problems and stress.\nAccording to research, modern work provides people with a sense of personal and social identity that is tied to:\nThus job loss entails the loss of this identity.\nErich Fromm argued that if a person perceives himself as being what he owns, then when that person loses (or even thinks of losing) what he \"owns\" (e.g. the good looks or sharp mind that allow him to sell his labor for high wages) a fear of loss may create anxiety and authoritarian tendencies because that person's sense of identity is threatened. In contrast, when a person's sense of self is based on what he experiences in a \"state of being\" with a less materialistic regard for what he once had and lost, or may lose, then less authoritarian tendencies prevail. In his view, the state of being flourishes under a worker-managed workplace and economy, whereas self-ownership entails a materialistic notion of self, created to rationalize the lack of worker control that would allow for a state of being.\nInvestigative journalist Robert Kuttner analyzed the work of public-health scholars Jeffrey Johnson and Ellen Hall about modern conditions of work and concludes that \"to be in a life situation where one experiences relentless demands by others, over which one has relatively little control, is to be at risk of poor health, physically as well as mentally\". Under wage labor, \"a relatively small elite demands and gets empowerment, self-actualization, autonomy, and other work satisfaction that partially compensate for long hours\" while \"epidemiological data confirm that lower-paid, lower-status workers are more likely to experience the most clinically damaging forms of stress, in part because they have less control over their work\".\nWage slavery and the educational system that precedes it \"implies power held by the leader. Without power the leader is inept. The possession of power inevitably leads to corruption\u00a0... in spite of\u00a0... good intentions\u00a0... [Leadership means] power of initiative, this sense of responsibility, the self-respect which comes from expressed manhood, is taken from the men, and consolidated in the leader. The sum of their initiative, their responsibility, their self-respect becomes his\u00a0... [and the] order and system he maintains is based upon the suppression of the men, from being independent thinkers into being 'the men'\u00a0... In a word, he is compelled to become an autocrat and a foe to democracy\". For the \"leader\", such marginalisation can be beneficial, for a leader \"sees no need for any high level of intelligence in the rank and file, except to applaud his actions. Indeed such intelligence from his point of view, by breeding criticism and opposition, is an obstacle and causes confusion\". Wage slavery \"implies erosion of the human personality\u00a0... [because] some men submit to the will of others, arousing in these instincts which predispose them to cruelty and indifference in the face of the suffering of their fellows\".\nPsychological control.\nHigher wages.\nIn 19th-century discussions of labor relations, it was normally assumed that the threat of starvation forced those without property to work for wages. Proponents of the view that modern forms of employment constitute wage slavery, even when workers appear to have a range of available alternatives, have attributed its perpetuation to a variety of social factors that maintain the hegemony of the employer class.\nIn an account of the Lowell mill girls, Harriet Hanson Robinson wrote that generously high wages were offered to overcome the degrading nature of the work: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;At the time the Lowell cotton mills were started the caste of the factory girl was the lowest among the employments of women.\u00a0... She was represented as subjected to influences that must destroy her purity and selfrespect. In the eyes of her overseer she was but a brute, a slave, to be beaten, pinched and pushed about. It was to overcome this prejudice that such high wages had been offered to women that they might be induced to become millgirls, in spite of the opprobrium that still clung to this degrading occupation.\nIn his book \"Disciplined Minds\", Jeff Schmidt points out that professionals are trusted to run organizations in the interests of their employers. Because employers cannot be on hand to manage every decision, professionals are trained to \"ensure that each and every detail of their work favors the right interests\u2013or skewers the disfavored ones\" in the absence of overt control: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The resulting professional is an obedient thinker, an intellectual property whom employers can trust to experiment, theorize, innovate and create safely within the confines of an assigned ideology.\nParecon (participatory economics) theory posits a social class \"between labor and capital\" of higher paid professionals such as \"doctors, lawyers, engineers, managers and others\" who monopolize empowering labor and constitute a class above wage laborers who do mostly \"obedient, rote work\".\nLower wages.\nThe terms \"employee\" or \"worker\" have often been replaced by \"associate\" or \"partner\". This plays up the allegedly voluntary nature of the interaction while playing down the subordinate status of the wage laborer as well as the worker-boss class distinction emphasized by labor movements. Billboards as well as television, Internet and newspaper advertisements consistently show low-wage workers with smiles on their faces, appearing happy.\nJob interviews and other data on requirements for lower skilled workers in developed countries \u2013 particularly in the growing service sector \u2013 indicate that the more workers depend on low wages and the less skilled or desirable their job is, the more employers screen for workers without better employment options and expect them to feign unremunerative motivation. Such screening and feigning may not only contribute to the positive self-image of the employer as someone granting desirable employment, but also signal wage-dependence by indicating the employee's willingness to feign, which in turn may discourage the dissatisfaction normally associated with job-switching or union activity.\nAt the same time, employers in the service industry have justified unstable, part-time employment and low wages by playing down the importance of service jobs for the lives of the wage laborers (e.g. just temporary before finding something better, student summer jobs and the like).\nIn the early 20th century, \"scientific methods of strikebreaking\" were devised \u2013 employing a variety of tactics that emphasized how strikes undermined \"harmony\" and \"Americanism\".\nWorkers' self-management.\nSome social activists objecting to the market system or price system of wage working historically have considered syndicalism, worker cooperatives, workers' self-management and workers' control as possible alternatives to the current wage system.\nLabor and government.\nThe American philosopher John Dewey believed that until \"industrial feudalism\" is replaced by \"industrial democracy\", politics will be \"the shadow cast on society by big business\". Thomas Ferguson has postulated in his investment theory of party competition that the undemocratic nature of economic institutions under capitalism causes elections to become occasions when blocs of investors coalesce and compete to control the state.\nNoam Chomsky has argued that political theory tends to blur the 'elite' function of government: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Modern political theory stresses Madison's belief that \"in a just and a free government the rights both of property and of persons ought to be effectually guarded.\" But in this case too it is useful to look at the doctrine more carefully. There are no rights of property, only rights to property that is, rights of persons with property...\nIn representative democracy, as in, say, the United States or Great Britain [...] there is a monopoly of power centralized in the state, and secondly \u2013 and critically \u2013 [...] the representative democracy is limited to the political sphere and in no serious way encroaches on the economic sphere [...] That is, as long as individuals are compelled to rent themselves on the market to those who are willing to hire them, as long as their role in production is simply that of ancillary tools, then there are striking elements of coercion and oppression that make talk of democracy very limited, if even meaningful.\nIn this regard, Chomsky has used Bakunin's theories about an \"instinct for freedom\", the militant history of labor movements, Kropotkin's mutual aid evolutionary principle of survival and Marc Hauser's theories supporting an innate and universal moral faculty, to explain the incompatibility of oppression with certain aspects of human nature.\nInfluence on environmental degradation.\nLoyola University philosophy professor John Clark and libertarian socialist philosopher Murray Bookchin have criticized the system of wage labor for encouraging environmental destruction, arguing that a self-managed industrial society would better manage the environment. Like other anarchists, they attribute much of the Industrial Revolution's pollution to the \"hierarchical\" and \"competitive\" economic relations accompanying it.\nEmployment contracts.\nSome criticize wage slavery on strictly contractual grounds, e.g. David Ellerman and Carole Pateman, arguing that the employment contract is a legal fiction in that it treats human beings juridically as mere tools or inputs by abdicating responsibility and self-determination, which the critics argue are inalienable. As Ellerman points out, \"[t]he employee is legally transformed from being a co-responsible partner to being only an input supplier sharing no legal responsibility for either the input liabilities [costs] or the produced outputs [revenue, profits] of the employer's business\". Such contracts are inherently invalid \"since the person remain[s] a \"de facto\" fully capacitated adult person with only the contractual role of a non-person\" as it is impossible to physically transfer self-determination. As Pateman argues: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The contractarian argument is unassailable all the time it is accepted that abilities can 'acquire' an external relation to an individual, and can be treated as if they were property. To treat abilities in this manner is also implicitly to accept that the 'exchange' between employer and worker is like any other exchange of material property ... The answer to the question of how property in the person can be contracted out is that no such procedure is possible. Labour power, capacities or services, cannot be separated from the person of the worker like pieces of property.\nIn a modern liberal capitalist society, the employment contract is enforced while the enslavement contract is not; the former being considered valid because of its consensual/non-coercive nature and the latter being considered inherently invalid, consensual or not. The noted economist Paul Samuelson described this discrepancy: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Since slavery was abolished, human earning power is forbidden by law to be capitalized. A man is not even free to sell himself; he must rent himself at a wage.\nSome advocates of right-libertarianism, among them philosopher Robert Nozick, address this inconsistency in modern societies arguing that a consistently libertarian society would allow and regard as valid consensual/non-coercive enslavement contracts, rejecting the notion of inalienable rights: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The comparable question about an individual is whether a free system will allow him to sell himself into slavery. I believe that it would.\nOther economists including Murray Rothbard allow for the possibility of debt slavery, asserting that a lifetime labour contract can be broken so long as the slave pays appropriate damages: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[I]f A has agreed to work for life for B in exchange for 10,000 grams of gold, he will have to return the proportionate amount of property if he terminates the arrangement and ceases to work.\nSchools of economics.\nIn the philosophy of mainstream, neoclassical economics, wage labor is seen as the voluntary sale of one's own time and efforts, just like a carpenter would sell a chair, or a farmer would sell wheat. It is considered neither an antagonistic nor abusive relationship and carries no particular moral implications.\nAustrian economics argues that a person is not \"free\" unless they can sell their labor because otherwise that person has no self-ownership and will be owned by a \"third party\" of individuals.\nPost-Keynesian economics perceives wage slavery as resulting from inequality of bargaining power between labor and capital, which exists when the economy does not \"allow labor to organize and form a strong countervailing force\".\nThe two main forms of socialist economics perceive wage slavery differently:\nCriticism.\nSome abolitionists in the United States regarded the analogy of wage workers as wage slaves to be spurious. They believed that wage workers were \"neither wronged nor oppressed\". The abolitionist and former slave Frederick Douglass declared \"Now I am my own master\" when he took a paying job. Later in life, he concluded to the contrary \"experience demonstrates that there may be a slavery of wages only a little less galling and crushing in its effects than chattel slavery, and that this slavery of wages must go down with the other\". However, Abraham Lincoln and the Republicans \"did not challenge the notion that those who spend their entire lives as wage laborers were comparable to slaves\", though they argued that the condition was different, as long as laborers were likely to develop the opportunity to work for themselves in the future, achieving self-employment.\nSome advocates of laissez-faire capitalism, among them philosopher Robert Nozick, have said that inalienable rights can be waived if done so voluntarily, saying \"the comparable question about an individual is whether a free system will allow him to sell himself into slavery. I believe that it would\".\nOthers such as the anarcho-capitalist economist Walter Block go further and maintain that all rights are in fact alienable, stating voluntary slavery and by extension wage slavery is legitimate.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "53707", "revid": "50018146", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53707", "title": "Gujarat", "text": "State in western India\nGujarat (, \u00a0) is a state along the western coast of India. Its coastline of about is the longest in the country, most of which lies on the Kathiawar peninsula. Gujarat is the fifth-largest Indian state by area, covering some ; and the ninth-most populous state, with a population of 60.4\u00a0million in 2011. It is bordered by Rajasthan to the northeast, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu to the south, Maharashtra to the southeast, Madhya Pradesh to the east, and the Arabian Sea and the Pakistani province of Sindh to the west. Gujarat's capital city is Gandhinagar, while its largest city is Ahmedabad. The Gujaratis are indigenous to the state, and their language, Gujarati, is the state's official language.\nThe state encompasses 23 sites of the ancient Indus Valley Civilisation (more than any other state). The most important sites are Lothal (the world's first dry dock), Dholavira (the fifth largest site), and Gola Dhoro (where five uncommon seals were found). Lothal is believed to have been one of the world's first seaports. Gujarat's coastal cities, chiefly Bharuch and Khambhat, served as ports and trading centres in the Maurya and Gupta empires, and during the succession of royal Saka dynasties in the Western Satraps era.\nAlong with Bihar, Mizoram and Nagaland, Gujarat is one of four Indian states to prohibit the sale of alcohol. The Gir National Park in Gujarat is home to the only wild population of the Asiatic lion in the world.\nThe economy of Gujarat is the fifth-largest in India, with a gross state domestic product (GSDP) of \u20b9 () and has the country's 10th-highest GSDP per capita of (). Gujarat has the highest exports of all states, accounting for around one-third of national exports. It ranks 21st among Indian states and union territories in human development index. The world's largest data center will also be built in Jamnagar, Gujarat, by Reliance Industries. Gujarat is regarded as one of the most industrialised states and has a low unemployment rate. The state has one of the lowest crime rates, with Ahmedabad, Vadodara and Surat crowned among the five safest cities in India.\nEtymology.\nGujarat is derived from the Gurjaras, who ruled Gujarat in the 8th and 9th centuries CE. Parts of modern Rajasthan and Gujarat were known as \"Gurjarat\" or \"Gurjarabhumi\" for centuries before the Mughal period.\nHistory.\nAncient history.\nGujarat was one of the main central areas of the Indus Valley Civilisation, which was spread across modern-day northern India and Pakistan. It contains ancient metropolitan cities from the Indus Valley Civilisation such as Lothal, Dholavira and Gola Dhoro. The ancient city of Lothal was where India's first port was established. The ancient city of Dholavira is one of the largest and most prominent archaeological sites in India, belonging to the Indus Valley Civilisation. The most recent discovery was Gola Dhoro. Altogether, about fifty Indus Valley settlement ruins have been discovered in Gujarat.\nThe ancient history of Gujarat was enriched by the commercial activities of its inhabitants. There is clear historical evidence of trade and commerce ties with Egypt, Bahrain and Sumer in the Persian Gulf during the time period of 1000 to 750 BCE. There was a succession of various polities such as the Mauryan dynasty, Satavahana dynasty, Gupta Empire, Gurjara-Pratihara Empire, as well as regional ones such as the Western Satraps, the Kingdom of Valabhi, the Kingdom of Gujarat, the Sultanate of Gujarat, and finally the Kingdom of Baroda.\nThe early history of Gujarat includes the imperial grandeur of Chandragupta Maurya who conquered a number of earlier states in what is now Gujarat. Pushyagupta, a Vaishya, was appointed the governor of Saurashtra by the Mauryan regime. He ruled Girinagar (modern-day Junagadh) (322 BCE to 294 BCE) and built a dam on the Sudarshan lake. Emperor Ashoka the Great, the grandson of Chandragupta Maurya, not only ordered his edicts engraved in the rock at Junagadh, but also asked Governor Tusherpha to cut canals from the lake where an earlier Indian governor had built a dam. Between the decline of Mauryan power and Saurashtra coming under the sway of the Samprati Mauryas of Ujjain, there was an Indo-Greek defeat in Gujarat of Demetrius. In 16th-century manuscripts, there is an apocryphal story of a merchant of King Gondophares landing in Gujarat with Apostle Thomas. The incident of the cup-bearer torn apart by a lion might indicate that the port city described is in Gujarat.\nFor nearly 300 years from the start of the 1st century CE, Saka rulers played a prominent part in Gujarat's history. The weather-beaten rock at Junagadh gives a glimpse of the ruler Rudradaman I (100 CE) of the Saka satraps known as Western Satraps, or Kshatraps. Mahakshatrap Rudradaman I founded the Kardamaka dynasty which ruled from Anupa on the banks of the Narmada up to the Aparanta region bordering Punjab. In Gujarat, several battles were fought between the Indian dynasties such as the Satavahana dynasty and the Western Satraps. The greatest and the mightiest ruler of the Satavahana dynasty was Gautamiputra Satakarni who defeated the Western Satraps and conquered some parts of Gujarat in the 2nd century CE.\nThe Kshatrapa dynasty was replaced by the Gupta Empire with the conquest of Gujarat by Chandragupta Vikramaditya. Vikramaditya's successor Skandagupta left an inscription (450 CE) on a rock at Junagadh which gives details of the governor's repairs to the embankment surrounding Sudarshan lake after it was damaged by floods. The Anarta and Saurashtra regions were both parts of the Gupta empire. Towards the middle of the 5th century, the Gupta empire went into decline. Senapati Bhatarka, the general of the Guptas, took advantage of the situation and in 470 set up the Kingdom of Valabhi. He shifted his capital from Giringer to Valabhi, near Bhavnagar, on Saurashtra's east coast. The Maitrakas of Vallabhi became very powerful with their rule prevailing over large parts of Gujarat and adjoining Malwa. A university was set up by the Maitrakas, which came to be known far and wide for its scholastic pursuits and was compared with the noted Nalanda University. It was during the rule of Dhruvasena Maitrak that Chinese philosopher-traveler Xuanzang/ I Tsing visited in 640 along the Silk Road.\nGujarat was known to the ancient Greeks and was familiar with other Western centres of civilisation through the end of the European Middle Ages. The oldest written record of Gujarat's 2,000-year maritime history is documented in a Greek book titled \"The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea: Travel and Trade in the Indian Ocean by a Merchant of the First Century\".\nMedieval history.\nIn the early 8th century, the Arabs of the Umayyad Caliphate established an empire in the name of the rising religion of Islam, which stretched from Spain in the west to Afghanistan and modern-day Pakistan in the east. Al-Junaid, the successor of Qasim, finally subdued the Hindu resistance within Sindh and established a secure base. The Arab rulers tried to expand their empire southeast, which culminated in the Caliphate campaigns in India fought in 730; they were defeated and expelled west of the Indus river, probably by a coalition of the Indian rulers Nagabhata I of the Gurjara-Pratihara dynasty, Vikramaditya II of the Chalukya dynasty and Bappa Rawal of the Guhila dynasty. After this victory, the Arab invaders were driven out of Gujarat. General Pulakeshin, a Chalukya prince of Lata, received the title \"Avanijanashraya\" (refuge of the people of the earth) and honorific of \"Repeller of the unrepellable\" by the Chalukya emperor Vikramaditya II for his victory at the battle at Navsari, where the Arab troops suffered a crushing defeat.\nIn the late 8th century, the Kannauj Triangle period started. The three major Indian dynasties \u2013 the northwestern Indian Gurjara-Pratihara dynasty, the southern Indian Rashtrakuta dynasty and the eastern Indian Pala Empire \u2013 dominated India from the 8th to 10th centuries. During this period the northern part of Gujarat was ruled by the northern Indian Gurjara-Pratihara dynasty and the southern part of Gujarat was ruled by the southern Indian Rashtrakuta dynasty. However, the earliest epigraphical records of the Gurjars of Broach attest that the royal bloodline of the Gurjara-Pratihara dynasty of Dadda I, II and III (650\u2013750) ruled south Gujarat. Southern Gujarat was ruled by the Indian Rashtrakuta dynasty until it was captured by the Indian ruler Tailapa II of the Western Chalukya Empire.\nZoroastrians from Greater Iran migrated to the western borders of India (Gujarat and Sindh) during the 8th or 10th century, to avoid persecution by Muslim invaders who were in the process of conquering Iran. The descendants of those Zoroastrian refugees came to be known as the Parsi.\nSubsequently, L\u0101\u1e6da in southern Gujarat was ruled by the Rashtrakuta dynasty until it was captured by the Western Chalukya ruler Tailapa II.\nThe Chaulukya dynasty ruled the Kingdom of Gujarat from 960 to 1243. Gujarat was a major center of Indian Ocean trade, and their capital at Anhilwara (Patan) was one of the largest cities in India, with a population estimated at 100,000 in the year 1000. After 1243, the Solankis lost control of Gujarat to their feudatories, of whom the Vaghela chiefs of Dholka came to rule the Kingdom of Gujarat. In 1292, the Vaghelas became tributaries of the Yadava dynasty of Devagiri in the Deccan. Karandev of the Vaghela dynasty was the last Hindu ruler of Gujarat. He was defeated and overthrown by the superior forces of Alauddin Khalji from Delhi in 1297. With his defeat, Gujarat became part of the Delhi Sultanate, and the Rajput hold over Gujarat would never be restored.\nFragments of printed cotton from Gujarat have been discovered in Egypt, providing evidence for medieval trade in the western Indian Ocean. These fragments represent the Indian cotton traded in Egypt during the Fatimid, Ayyubid and Mamluk periods, from the 10th to 16th centuries. Similar cotton was also traded as far east as Indonesia.\nMuslim rule.\nIslamic conquests (1197\u20131614).\nAfter the Ghoris had assumed a position of Muslim supremacy over North India, Qutbuddin Aibak attempted to conquer Gujarat and annexe it to his empire in 1197, but failed in his ambitions. An independent Muslim community continued to flourish in Gujarat for the next hundred years, championed by Arab merchants settling along the western coast. From 1297 to 1300, Alauddin Khalji, the Turko-Afghan Sultan of Delhi, destroyed the Hindu metropolis of Anhilwara and incorporated Gujarat into the Delhi Sultanate. After Timur sacked Delhi at the end of the 14th century, weakening the Sultanate, Gujarat's Muslim Khatri governor Zafar Khan Muzaffar (Muzaffar Shah I) asserted his independence, and his son, Sultan Ahmed Shah (ruled 1411\u20131442), established Ahmedabad as the capital. Khambhat eclipsed Bharuch as Gujarat's most important trade port. Gujarat's relations with Egypt, which was then the premier Arab power in the Middle East, remained friendly over the next century and the Egyptian scholar, \"Badruddin-ad-Damamimi\", spent several years in Gujarat in the shade of the Sultan before proceeding to the Bahmani Sultanate on the Deccan Plateau.\nShah e Alam, a famous Sufi saint of the Chishti order who was the descendant of Makhdoom Jahaniyan Jahangasht from Bukhara, soon arrived in a group that included Arab theologian \"Ibn Suwaid\", several Sayyid Sufi members of the Aydarus family of Tarim in Yemen, Iberian court interpreter \"Ali al-Andalusi\" from Granada, and the Arab jurist \"Bahraq\" from Hadramaut who was appointed a tutor of the prince. Among the illustrious names who arrived during the reign of Mahmud Begada was the philosopher \"Haibatullah Shah Mir\" from Shiraz, and the scholar intellectual \"Abu Fazl Ghazaruni\" from Persia who tutored and adopted Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak, author of the \"Akbarnama\". Later, a close alliance between the Ottoman Turks and Gujarati sultans to effectively safeguard Jeddah and the Red Sea trade from Portuguese imperialism, encouraged the existence of powerful Rumi elites within the kingdom who took the post of viziers in Gujarat keen to maintain ties with the Ottoman state.\nHumayun also briefly occupied the province in 1536, but fled due to the threat Bahadur Shah, the Gujarat king, imposed. The Sultanate of Gujarat remained independent until 1572, when the Mughal emperor Akbar conquered it and annexed it to the Mughal Empire.\nThe Surat port (the only Indian port facing west) then became the principal port of India during Mughal rule, gaining widespread international repute. The city of Surat, famous for its exports of silk and diamonds, had reached a par with contemporary Venice and Beijing, great mercantile cities of Europe and Asia, and earned the distinguished title, \"Bab al-Makkah\" (Gate of Mecca).\nDrawn by the religious renaissance taking place under Akbar, Mohammed Ghaus moved to Gujarat and established spiritual centers for the Shattari Sufi order from Iran, founding the Ek Toda Mosque and producing such devotees as Wajihuddin Alvi of Ahmedabad whose many successors moved to Bijapur during the height of the Adil Shahi dynasty. At the same time, Zoroastrian high priest Azar Kayvan who was a native of Fars, immigrated to Gujarat founding the Zoroastrian school of illuminationists which attracted key Shi'ite Muslim admirers of the Safavid philosophical revival from Isfahan.\nEarly 14th-century Maghrebi adventurer, Ibn Batuta, who famously visited India with his entourage, recalls in his memoirs about Cambay, one of the great emporia of the Indian Ocean that indeed:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt; Cambay is one of the most beautiful cities as regards the artistic architecture of its houses and the construction of its mosques. The reason is that the majority of its inhabitants are foreign merchants, who continually build their beautiful houses and wonderful mosques \u2013 an achievement in which they endeavor to surpass each other.\nMany of these \"foreign merchants\" were transient visitors, men of South Arabian and Persian Gulf ports, who migrated in and out of Cambay with the rhythm of the monsoons. But others were men with Arab or Persian patronyms whose families had settled in the town generations, even centuries earlier, intermarrying with Gujarati women, and assimilating everyday customs of the Hindu hinterland.\nThe Age of Discovery heralded the dawn of pioneer Portuguese and Spanish long-distance travel in search of alternative trade routes to \"the East Indies\", moved by the trade of gold, silver and spices. In 1497, Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama is said to have discovered the Europe-to-India sea route which changed the course of history, thanks to Kutchi sailor Kanji Malam, who showed him the route from the East African coasts of Mozambique sailing onwards to Calicut off the Malabar coast in India. Later, the Gujarat Sultanate allied with the Ottomans and Egyptian Mamluks naval fleets led by governor-generals Malik Ayyaz and Amir Husain Al-Kurdi, vanquished the Portuguese in the 1508 Battle of Chaul resulting in the first Portuguese defeat at sea in the Indian Ocean.\nTo 16th-century European observers, Gujarat was a fabulously wealthy country. The customs revenue of Gujarat alone in the early 1570s was nearly three times the total revenue of the whole Portuguese empire in Asia in 1586\u201387, when it was at its height. Indeed, when the British arrived on the coast of Gujarat, houses in Surat already had windows of Venetian glass imported from Constantinople through the Ottoman Empire. In 1514, the Portuguese explorer Duarte Barbosa described the cosmopolitan atmosphere of Rander known otherwise as \"City of Mosques\" in Surat province, which gained the fame and reputation of illustrious Islamic scholars, Sufi-saints, merchants and intellectuals from all over the world:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt; Ranel (Rander) is a good town of the Moors, built of very pretty houses and squares. It is a rich and agreeable place\u00a0... the Moors of the town trade with Malacca, Bengal, Tawasery (Tannasserim), Pegu, Martaban, and Sumatra in all sort of spices, drugs, silks, musk, benzoin and porcelain. They possess very large and fine ships and those who wish Chinese articles will find them there very completely. The Moors of this place are white and well dressed and very rich they have pretty wives, and in the furniture of these houses have china vases of many kinds, kept in glass cupboards well arranged. Their women are not secluded like other Moors, but go about the city in the day time, attending to their business with their faces uncovered as in other parts.\nThe conquest of the Kingdom of Gujarat marked a significant event of Akbar's reign. Being the major trade gateway and departure harbour of pilgrim ships to Mecca, it gave the Mughal Empire free access to the Arabian sea and control over the rich commerce that passed through its ports. The territory and income of the empire were vastly increased.\nThe Sultanate of Gujarat and the merchants.\nFor the best part of two centuries, the independent Khatri Sultanate of Gujarat was the cynosure of its neighbours on account of its wealth and prosperity, which had long made the Gujarati merchant a familiar figure in the ports of the Indian Ocean. Gujaratis, including Hindus and Muslims as well as the enterprising Parsi class of Zoroastrians, had been specialising in the organisation of overseas trade for many centuries, and had moved into various branches of commerce such as commodity trade, brokerage, money-changing, money-lending and banking.\nBy the 17th century, Chavuse and Baghdadi Jews had assimilated into the social world of the Surat province, later on their descendants would give rise to the Sassoons of Bombay and the Ezras of Calcutta, and other influential Indian-Jewish figures who went on to play a philanthropical role in the commercial development of 19th-century British Crown Colony of Shanghai. Spearheaded by Khoja, Bohra, Bhatiya shahbandars and Moorish nakhudas who dominated sea navigation and shipping, Gujarat's transactions with the outside world had created the legacy of an international transoceanic empire which had a vast commercial network of permanent agents stationed at all the great port cities across the Indian Ocean. These networks extended to the Philippines in the east, East Africa in the west, and via maritime and the inland caravan route to Russia in the north.\nTom\u00e9 Pires, a Portuguese official at Malacca, wrote of conditions during the reigns of Mahmud I and Mozaffar II:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Cambay stretches out two arms; with her right arm she reaches toward Aden and with the other towards Malacca\nHe also described Gujarat's active trade with Goa, the Deccan Plateau and the Malabar. His contemporary, Duarte Barbosa, describing Gujarat's maritime trade, recorded the import of horses from the Middle East and elephants from Malabar, and lists exports which included muslins, chintzes and silks, carnelian, ginger and other spices, aromatics, opium, indigo and other substances for dyeing, cereals and legumes. Persia was the destination for many of these commodities, and they were partly paid for in horses and pearls taken from Hormuz. The latter item, in particular, led Sultan Sikandar Lodi of Delhi, according to Ali-Muhammad Khan, author of the Mirat-i-Ahmadi, to complain that the\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;support of the throne of Delhi is wheat and barley but the foundation of the realm of Gujarat is coral and pearls\nHence, the sultans of Gujarat possessed ample means to sustain lavish patronage of religion and the arts, to build madrasas and \u1e35\u0101naq\u0101hs, and to provide douceurs for the literati, mainly poets and historians, whose presence and praise enhanced the fame of the dynasty.\nEven at the time of Tom\u00e9 Pires' travel to the East Indies in the early 16th century, Gujarati merchants had earned an international reputation for their commercial acumen and this encouraged the visit of merchants from Cairo, Armenia, Abyssinia, Khorasan, Shiraz, Turkestan and Guilans from Aden and Hormuz. Pires noted in his \"Suma Orientale\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;These [people] are [like] Italians in their knowledge of and dealings in merchandise\u00a0... they are men who understand merchandise; they are so properly steeped in the sound and harmony of it, that the \"Gujaratees\" say that any offence connected with merchandise is pardonable. There are \"Gujaratees\" settled everywhere. They work some for some and others for others. They are diligent, quick men in trade. They do their accounts with fingers like ours and with our very writings.\nGujarat in the Mughal Empire.\nGujarat was one of the twelve original subahs (imperial top-level provinces) established by Mughal Emperor (\"Badshah\") Akbar, with a seat at Ahmedabad, bordering on Thatta (Sindh), Ajmer, Malwa and later Ahmadnagar subahs.\nAurangzeb, the sixth Mughal Emperor, was born in Dahod, Gujarat. He was the third son and sixth child of Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal. At the time of his birth, his father, Shah Jahan, was then the Subahdar (governor) of Gujarat, and his grandfather, Jehangir, was the Mughal Emperor. Before he became emperor, Aurangzeb was made Subahdar of Gujarat subah as part of his training and was stationed at Ahmedabad.\nAurangzeb had great love for his place of birth. In 1704, he wrote a letter to his eldest son, Muhammad Azam Shah, asking him to be kind and considerate to the people of Dahod as it was his birthplace. Muhammad Azam was then the Subedar (governor) of Gujarat.\nIn his letter, Aurangzeb wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;My son of exalted rank, the town of Dahod, one of the dependencies of Gujarat, is the birthplace of this sinner. Please consider a regard for the inhabitants of that town as incumbent on you.\nMaratha Empire.\nWhen the cracks had started to develop in the edifice of the Mughal Empire in the mid-17th century, the Marathas were consolidating their power in the west, Chatrapati Shivaji, the great Maratha ruler, attacked Surat in southern Gujarat twice first in 1664 and again in 1672. These attacks marked the entry of the Marathas into Gujarat. However, before the Maratha had made inroads into Gujarat, the Europeans had made their presence felt, led by the Portuguese, and followed by the Dutch and the English.\nThe Peshwas had established sovereignty over parts of Gujarat and collected taxes and tributes through their representatives. Damaji Rao Gaekwad and Kadam Bande divided the Peshwa territory between them, with Damaji establishing the sway of Gaekwad over Gujarat and making Baroda (present day Vadodara in southern Gujarat) his capital. The ensuing internecine war among the Marathas was fully exploited by the British, who interfered in the affairs of both Gaekwads and the Peshwas.\nIn Saurashtra, as elsewhere, the Marathas were met with resistance. The decline of the Mughal Empire helped form larger peripheral states in Saurashtra, including Junagadh, Jamnagar, Bhavnagar and a few others, which largely resisted the Maratha incursions.\nEuropean colonialism (1614\u20131947).\nIn the 1600s, the Dutch, French, English and Portuguese all established bases along the western coast of the region. Portugal was the first European power to arrive in Gujarat, and after the Battle of Diu, acquired several enclaves along the Gujarati coast, including Daman and Diu as well as Dadra and Nagar Haveli. These enclaves were administered by Portuguese India under a single union territory for over 450 years, only to be later incorporated into the Republic of India on 19 December 1961 by military conquest.\nThe British East India Company established a factory in Surat in 1614 following the commercial treaty made with Mughal Emperor Nuruddin Salim Jahangir, which formed their first base in India, but it was eclipsed by Bombay after the English received it from Portugal in 1668 as part of the marriage treaty of Charles II of England and Catherine of Braganza, daughter of King John IV of Portugal. The state was an early point of contact with the west, and the first British commercial outpost in India was in Gujarat.\n17th-century French explorer Fran\u00e7ois Pyrard de Laval, who is remembered for his 10-year sojourn in South Asia, bears witness in his account that the Gujaratis were always prepared to learn workmanship from the Portuguese, and in turn imparted skills to the Portuguese:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I have never seen men of wit so fine and polished as are these Indians: they have nothing barbarous or savage about them, as we are apt to suppose. They are unwilling indeed to adopt the manners and customs of the \"Portuguese\"; yet do they regularly learn their manufactures and workmanship, being all very curious and desirous of learning. In fact, the \"Portuguese\" take and learn more from them than they from the \"Portuguese\".\nLater in the 17th century, Gujarat came under control of the Hindu Maratha Empire that arose, defeating the Muslim Mughals who had dominated the politics of India. Most notably, from 1705 to 1716, Senapati Khanderao Dabhade led the Maratha Empire forces in Baroda. Pilaji Gaekwad, first ruler of Gaekwad dynasty, established the control over Baroda and other parts of Gujarat.\nThe British East India Company wrested control of much of Gujarat from the Marathas during the Second Anglo-Maratha War in 1802\u20131803. Many local rulers, notably the Maratha Gaekwad Maharajas of Baroda (Vadodara), made a separate peace with the British and acknowledged British sovereignty in return for retaining local self-rule.\nAn epidemic in 1812 killed half the population of Gujarat.\nGujarat was placed under the political authority of the Bombay Presidency, with the exception of Baroda State, which had a direct relationship with the Governor-General of India. From 1818 to 1947, most of present-day Gujarat, including Kathiawar, Kutch and northern and eastern Gujarat were divided into hundreds of princely states, but several districts in central and southern Gujarat, namely Ahmedabad, Broach (Bharuch), Kaira (Kheda), Panchmahal and Surat, were governed directly by British officials. In 1819, Sahajanand Swami established the first Swaminarayan Mandir in Kalupur, Ahmedabad.\nPost-independence (1947\u2013present).\nInitially there was confusion over whether Junagadh would join India or Pakistan. This was resolved in 1947 with a plebiscite for full union with India following the next year.\nAfter Indian independence and the partition of India in 1947, the new Indian government grouped the former princely states of Gujarat into three larger units; Saurashtra, which included the former princely states on the Kathiawad peninsula, Kutch, and Bombay state, which included the former British districts of Bombay Presidency together with most of Baroda State and the other former princely states of eastern Gujarat. Bombay state was enlarged to include Kutch, Saurashtra (Kathiawar) and parts of Hyderabad state and Madhya Pradesh in central India. The new state had a mostly Gujarati-speaking north and a Marathi-speaking south. Agitation by Gujarati nationalists, the Mahagujarat Movement, and Marathi nationalists, the Samyukta Maharashtra, for their own states led to the split of Bombay state on linguistic lines; on 1 May 1960, it became the new states of Gujarat and Maharashtra. In 1969 riots, at least 660 died and properties worth millions were destroyed.\nThe first capital of Gujarat was Ahmedabad. The capital of Gujarat was moved to Gandhinagar in 1970. \"Nav Nirman Andolan\" was a socio-political movement of 1974. It was a students' and middle class people's movement against economic crisis and corruption in public life. This was the first and last successful agitation after the Independence of India that ousted an elected government.\nGujarat has emerged as an important industrial hub in India. In Western India Surat was among the strongest industrial clusters in the 1970s. Between 1971 and 1981 diamond cutting was established as industry in Surat. At the same time the production of artificial silk and a substantial petrochemical industry became a fixture in Surat.\nThe Morvi dam failure, in 1979, resulted in the death of thousands of people and large economic loss. In the 1980s, a reservation policy was introduced in the country, which led to anti-reservation protests in 1981 and 1985. The protests witnessed violent clashes between people belonging to various castes.\nThe 2001 Gujarat earthquake was located about 9\u00a0km south-southwest of the village of Chobari in the Bhachau taluka of Kutch District. This magnitude 7.7 shock killed around 20,000 people (including at least 18 in South-eastern Pakistan), injured another 167,000 and destroyed nearly 400,000 homes.\nIn February 2002, the Godhra train burning led to statewide riots, resulting in the deaths of 1,044 people \u2013 790 Muslims and 254 Hindus, and hundreds missing still unaccounted for. The Swaminarayan Akshardham in Gandhinagar was attacked by two terrorists in September 2002, killing 32 people and injuring more than 80 others. National Security Guards intervened to end the siege killing both terrorists. On 26 July 2008 a series of seventeen bomb blasts rocked Ahmedabad, killing and injuring several people.\nGeography.\nGujarat borders the Tharparkar, Badin and Thatta districts of Pakistan's Sindh province to the northwest, is bounded by the Arabian Sea to the southwest, the state of Rajasthan to the northeast, Madhya Pradesh to the east, and by Maharashtra, the Union Territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu to the south. Historically, the north was known as Anarta, the Kathiawar peninsula, \"Saurastra\", and the south as \"Lata\". Gujarat was also known as Pratichya and Varuna. The Arabian Sea makes up the state's western coast. The capital, Gandhinagar is a planned city. Gujarat has an area of with the longest coastline (24% of Indian sea coast) , dotted with 41 ports: one major, 11 intermediate and 29 minor.\nThe Narmada is the largest river in Gujarat followed by the Tapi. The Sabarmati has the longest course through the state.\nThe Sardar Sarovar Project is built on Narmada, one of the major rivers of peninsular India where it is one of only three major rivers that run from east to west \u2013 the others being the Tapi and the Mahi. It is about long. Several riverfront embankments have been built on the Sabarmati River.\nThe eastern borders have fringes of low mountains of India, the Aravalli, Sahyadri (Western Ghats), Vindhya and Saputara. Apart from this the Gir hills, Barda, Jessore and Chotila together make up a large minority of Gujarat. Girnar is the tallest peak and Saputara is the only hill-station (hilltop resort) in the state.\nRann of Kutch.\nRann (\u0ab0\u0aa3) is Gujarati for desert. The Rann of Kutch is a seasonally marshy saline clay desert in the Thar Desert biogeographic region between the Pakistani province of Sindh and the rest of the state of Gujarat; it commences from the village of Kharaghoda, Surendranagar District.\nFlora and fauna.\nPrehistoric fauna.\nIn the early 1980s, palaeontologists found dinosaur egg hatcheries and fossils of at least 13 species in Balasinor. The most important find was that of a carnivorous abelisaurid dinosaur named \"Rajasurus narmadensis\" which lived in the Late Cretaceous period. A notable discovery in the village of Dholi Dungri was that of \"Sanajeh indicus\", a primitive madtsoiid snake that likely preyed on sauropod dinosaur hatchlings and embryos.\nExtant species.\nAs of 2023, Gujarat has km2 of forest cover, which is about % of its geographical area. The total recorded forest area in the state is km2 (%). Among the districts, the Dangs has the largest area under forest cover. Gujarat has four national parks and 21 sanctuaries. It is the only home of Asiatic lions and, outside Africa, is the only present natural habitat of lions. Gir Forest National Park in the southwest part of the state covers part of the lions' habitat. Indian leopards are also found in the state. They are spread across the large plains of Saurashtra and the mountains of South Gujarat. Other national parks include Vansda National Park, Blackbuck National Park, Velavadar, and Narara Marine National Park, Gulf of Kutchh, Jamnagar. Wildlife sanctuaries include Wild Ass Wildlife Sanctuary, Nal Sarovar Bird Sanctuary, Porbandar Bird Sanctuary, Kutch Desert Wildlife Sanctuary, Kutch Bustard Sanctuary, Narayan Sarovar Sanctuary, Jessore Sloth Bear Sanctuary, Anjal, Balaram-Ambaji, Barda, Jambughoda, Khavda, Paniya, Purna, Rampura, Ratan Mahal, and Surpaneshwar.\nIn February 2019, a Bengal tiger claimed to be from Ratapani in Madhya Pradesh was spotted in the area of Lunavada in Mahisagar district, in the eastern part of the state, before being found dead later that month, likely from starvation.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe population of Gujarat was 60,439,692 (31,491,260 males and 28,948,432 females) according to the 2011 census data. The population density is , lower than other Indian states. As per the census of 2011, the state has a sex ratio of 918 females for every 1000 males, one of the lowest (ranked 24) among the 29 states in India.\nWhile Gujarati speakers constitute a majority of Gujarat's population, the metropolitan areas of Ahmedabad, Vadodara and Surat are cosmopolitan, with numerous other ethnic and language groups. Marwaris compose large minorities of economic migrants; smaller communities of people from the other states of India have also migrated to Gujarat for employment. Luso-Indians, Anglo-Indians, Jews and Parsis also live in the areas. Sindhi presence is traditionally important here following the Partition of India in 1947. The Koli forms the largest caste-cluster, comprising 24% of the total population of the state.\nGujarat ranked fifth in the Fiscal Health Index (FHI) 2025, with a score of 50.5.\nReligion.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAccording to 2011 census, the religious makeup in Gujarat was 88.57% Hindu, 9.67% Muslim, 0.96% Jain, 0.52% Christian, 0.10% Sikh, 0.05% Buddhist and 0.03% others. Around 0.1% did not state any religion. Hinduism is the majority religion, and is over 93% in rural areas. Muslims are the biggest minority in the state accounting for 9.7% of the population. Gujarat has the third-largest population of Jains in India, following Maharashtra and Rajasthan, almost all of whom live in urban areas like Vadodara, Ahmedabad and Surat.\nLanguage.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nGujarati is the official language of the state of Gujarat. An Indo-Aryan language, it is spoken natively by 86% of the state's population, or 52\u00a0million people (as of 2011). Hindi is the second-most frequently spoken language in the state, being spoken by more than 6% of the population. Marathi also is spoken in urban areas.\nPeople from the Kutch region of Gujarat also speak in the Kutchi mother tongue and, to a great extent, understand Sindhi as well. Memoni is the mother tongue of Kathiawar and Sindhi Memons, most whom are Muslims.\nAlmost 88% of the Gujarati Muslims speak Gujarati as their mother tongue and the remaining 12% speak Urdu. A sizeable proportion of Gujarati Muslims are bilingual in the two languages.\nIn rural areas among the tribals, various Bhil dialects are spoken by approximately 1.37% of the population. In the northeast part of the state Bhili is spoken, in the central part of the state Bhili, Bhilali, and Vasava are spoken, while in the southeast part of the state Dangi, Varli, Chodri, and Dhodia (which are related to Marathi) are spoken.\nApart from this, English, Bengali, Kannada, Malayalam, Marwari, Odia, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu, and others are spoken by a considerable number of economic migrants from other states of India who are seeking employment.\nUnder the \"three-language formula\", the languages taught in schools are:\nFirst language: Gujarati/Hindi/English\nSecond language: Gujarati/English\nThird language: Hindi\nGovernance and administration.\nFor administrative purposes, Gujarat is structurally divided into districts (Zilas), prants (subdivisions), talukas, and villages, primarily to facilitate land revenue administration.\nThe state is divided into 34 districts, 122 prants, 265 talukas and 18,584 revenue villages. There are 17 municipal corporations, 152 municipalities, 33 district panchayats, 247 taluka panchayats, and 16,778 gram panchayats, for local governance. \nGujarat has 34 districts and 250 talukas.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Largest_cities/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGujarat is governed by a Legislative Assembly of 182 members. Members of the Legislative Assembly are elected on the basis of adult suffrage from one of 182 constituencies, of which 13 are reserved for scheduled castes and 27 for scheduled tribes. The term of office for a member of the Legislative Assembly is five years. The Legislative Assembly elects a speaker who presides over the meetings of the legislature. A governor is appointed by the President of India, and is to address the state legislature after every general election and the commencement of each year's first session of the Legislative Assembly. The leader of the majority party or coalition in the legislature (Chief Minister) or his or her designee acts as the Leader of the Legislative Assembly. The administration of the state is led by the Chief Minister.\nAfter the independence of India in 1947, the Indian National Congress (INC) ruled the Bombay State (which included present-day Gujarat and Maharashtra). Congress continued to govern Gujarat after the state's creation in 1960.\nDuring and after India's State of Emergency of 1975\u20131977, public support for the INC eroded, but it continued to hold government until 1995 with the brief rule of nine months by Janata Morcha. In the 1995 Assembly elections, the Congress lost to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led by Keshubhai Patel who became the Chief Minister. His government lasted only two years. The fall of that government was provoked by a split in the BJP led by Shankersinh Vaghela. BJP again won election in 1998 with clear majority. In 2001, following the loss of two assembly seats in by-elections, Keshubhai Patel resigned and yielded power to Narendra Modi. BJP retained a majority in the 2002 election, and Narendra Modi remained as Chief Minister. On 1 June 2007, Narendra Modi became the longest serving Chief Minister of Gujarat. BJP retained the power in subsequent elections in 2007 and 2012 and Narendra Modi continued as the chief minister. After Narendra Modi became the prime minister of India in 2014, Anandiben Patel became the first female chief minister of the state. Vijay Rupani took over as chief minister and Nitin Patel as deputy chief minister on 7 August 2016 after Anandiben Patel resigned earlier on 3 August. Bhupendrabhai Patel became chief minister in September 2021 after the resignation of Vijay Rupani.\nThe incumbent chief secretary of Gujarat is Raj Kumar and director general of police (DGP) is Vikas Sahay.\nEconomy.\nGujarat is the most industrialised state in India and has the highest industrial output when compared to other states in the country. It has the highest exports of any Indian state, accounting for 30.7% of all Indian exports in 2024\u20132025. It leads in diverse industrial sectors such as chemicals, petrochemicals, dairy, drugs and pharmaceuticals, cement and ceramics, gems and jewellery, textiles and engineering. It has the highest electricity production capacity and maritime port cargo volume among all states in India.\nMajor agricultural produce of the state includes cotton, groundnuts (peanuts), dates, sugar cane, milk and milk products. Industrial products include cement and petrol.\nGujarat is ranked number one in the pharmaceutical industry in India, with a 33% share in drug manufacturing and 28% share in drug exports. The state has 130 USFDA certified drug manufacturing facilities. Ahmedabad and Vadodara are considered as pharmaceutical hubs, as there are many big and small pharmaceutical companies established in these cities.\nGujarat has the longest coastline in India (1600\u00a0km), and its ports (both private and public sector) handle around 40% of India's ocean cargo, with Mundra Port located in Gulf of Kutch being the largest port of India by cargo handled (144 million tons) due to its favourable location on the westernmost part of India and closeness to global shipping lanes. Gujarat also contributes around 20% share in India's industrial production and merchandise exports. According to a 2009 report on economic freedom by the Cato Institute, Gujarat is the most free state in India (the second one being Tamil Nadu). Reliance Industries operates the oil refinery at Jamnagar, which is the world's largest grass-roots refinery at a single location. The world's largest shipbreaking yard is in Gujarat near Bhavnagar at Alang. India's only Liquid Chemical Port Terminal at Dahej, developed by Gujarat Chemical Port Terminal Co Ltd. Gujarat has two of the three liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals in the country (Dahej and Hazira). Two more LNG terminals are proposed, at Pipavav and Mundra.\nAccording to most recent data, Gujarat is considered the fourth richest state in India.\nGujarat has 85% village connectivity with all\u2010weather roads. Nearly 100% of Gujarat's 18,000 villages have been connected to the electrical grid for 24-hour power to households and eight hours of power to farms, through the Jyotigram Yojana. As of 2015[ [update]], Gujarat ranks first nationwide in gas-based thermal electricity generation with a national market share of over 8%, and second nationwide in nuclear electricity generation with national market share of over 1%.\nThe state registered 12.8% agricultural growth in the last five years against the national average of 2%.\nGujarat records highest decadal agricultural growth rate of 10.97%. Over 20% of the \"S&amp;P CNX 500\" conglomerates have corporate offices in Gujarat. As per RBI report, in year 2006\u201307, 26% of total bank finance in India was in Gujarat.\nAccording to a 2012 survey report of the Chandigarh Labour Bureau, Gujarat had the lowest unemployment rate of 1% against the national average of 3.8%.\nLegatum Institute's Global Prosperity Index 2012 recognised Gujarat as one of the two highest-scoring among all states of India on matters of social capital. The state ranks 15th alongside Germany in a list of 142 nations worldwide: higher than several developed nations.\nInfrastructure.\nThe tallest tower in Gujarat, GIFT One was inaugurated on 10 January 2013. One other tower called GIFT Two has been finished and more towers are planned. Narendra Modi Stadium, the largest overall stadium in the world by capacity, is located in Gujarat. The Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Sports Enclave, the largest of its kind in India, is under construction in Ahmedabad and will help host the 2030 Commonwealth Games.\nIndustrial growth.\nGujarat's major cities include Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara, Rajkot, Jamnagar and Bhavnagar. In 2010, \"Forbes\"' list of the world's fastest growing cities included Ahmedabad at number 3 after Chengdu and Chongqing from China. The state is rich in calcite, gypsum, manganese, lignite, bauxite, limestone, agate, feldspar, and quartz sand, and successful mining of these minerals is done in their specified areas. Jamnagar is the hub for manufacturing brass parts. Gujarat produces about 98% of India's required amount of soda ash, and gives the country about 78% of the national requirement of salt. It is one of India's most prosperous states, having a per-capita GDP significantly above India's average.Mehsana, Kalol, Khambhat, and Ankleshwar are today known for their oil and natural gas production. Dhuvaran has a thermal power station, which uses coal, oil, and gas. Also, on the Gulf of Khambhat, southeast of Bhavnagar, is the Alang Ship Recycling Yard (the world's largest). MG Motor India manufactures its cars at Halol near Vadodara, The world's least expensive car, the Tata Nano, was manufactured in Sanand near Ahmedabad. Surat, a city by the Gulf of Khambhat, is a hub of the global diamond trade. In 2003, 92% of the world's diamonds were cut and polished in Surat. The diamond industry employs 500,000 people in Gujarat.\nAt an investor's summit entitled \"Vibrant Gujarat Global Investor Summit\", arranged between 11 and 13 January 2015, at Mahatma Mandir, Gandhinagar, the state government signed 21000 Memoranda of Understanding for Special Economic Zones worth a total of \u20b9 2.5\u00a0million crores (short scale). However, most of the investment was from domestic industry. In the fourth Vibrant Gujarat Global Investors' Summit held at Science City, Ahmedabad, in January 2009, there were 600 foreign delegates. In all, 8668 MOUs worth \u20b9 12500\u00a0billion were signed, estimated to create 2.5\u00a0million new job opportunities in the state. In 2011, Vibrant Gujarat Global Investors' Summit MOUs worth \u20b9 21\u00a0trillion (US$ 463\u00a0billion) were signed.\nGujarat is a state with surplus electricity. The Kakrapar Atomic Power Station is a nuclear power station run by NPCIL that lies in the proximity of the city of Surat. According to the official sources, against demand of 40,793\u00a0million units during the nine months since April 2010, Gujarat produced 43,848\u00a0million units. Gujarat sold surplus power to 12 states: Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Delhi, Haryana, Karnataka, Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh, and West Bengal.\nEnergy.\nAs of May 2024, the peak power requirement of state is 25,088 MW. As of March 2024, total installed power generation capacity is 52,945.13 MW. Of this 23,643.41 MW belongs to thermal power generation capacity while 27,461.72 MW (51.87%) belongs to renewable energy generation capacity including 1990 MW Hydropower. The rest 1840 MW is nuclear power generation capacity. The renewable energy installed capacity includes 11,823 MW wind power and 14,182 MW solar power totalling 26,005 MW, as of June 2024. Total rooftop solar power installation capacity of state is 3455.90 MW, as of April 2024.\nAgriculture.\nThe total geographical area of Gujarat is 19,602,400 hectares, of which crops take up 10,630,700 hectares. The three main sources of growth in Gujarat's agriculture are from cotton production, the rapid growth of high-value foods such as livestock, fruits and vegetables, and from wheat production, which saw an annual average growth rate of 28% between 2000 and 2008 (According to the International Food Policy Research Institute). Other major produce includes bajra, groundnut, cotton, rice, maize, wheat, mustard, sesame, pigeon pea, green gram, sugarcane, mango, banana, sapota, lime, guava, tomato, potato, onion, cumin, garlic, isabgul and fennel. Whilst, in recent times, Gujarat has seen a high average annual growth of 9% in the agricultural sector, the rest of India has an annual growth rate of around 3%. This success was lauded by former President of India, APJ Abdul Kalam.\nThe strengths of Gujarat's agricultural success have been attributed to diversified crops and cropping patters; climatic diversity (8 climatic zones for agriculture); the existence of 4 agricultural universities in the state, which promote research in agricultural efficiency and sustainability; co-operatives; adoption of hi-tech agriculture such as tissue culture, green houses and shed-net houses; agriculture export zones; strong marketing infrastructure, which includes cold storage, processing units, logistic hubs and consultancy facilities.\nGujarat is the main producer of tobacco, cotton, and groundnuts in India. Other major food crops produced are rice, wheat, \"jowar, bajra\", maize, \"tur\", and \"gram\". The state has an agricultural economy; the total crop area amounts to more than one-half of the total land area.\nAnimal husbandry and dairying have played vital roles in the rural economy of Gujarat. Dairy farming, primarily concerned with milk production, functions on a co-operative basis and has more than a million members. Gujarat is the largest producer of milk in India. The Amul milk co-operative federation is well known all over India, and it is Asia's biggest dairy. Among the livestock raised are, buffaloes and other cattle, sheep, and goats. As per the results of livestock census 1997, there were 20.97\u00a0million head of livestock in Gujarat State. In the estimates of the survey of major livestock products, during the year 2002\u201303, Gujarat produced 6.09\u00a0million tonnes of milk, 385\u00a0million eggs and 2.71\u00a0million kg of wool. Gujarat also contributes inputs to the textiles, oil, and soap industries.\nThe adoption of cooperatives in Gujarat is widely attributed to much of the success in the agricultural sector, particularly sugar and dairy cooperatives. Cooperative farming has been a component of India's strategy for agricultural development since 1951. Whilethe success of these was mixed throughout the country, their positive impact on the states of Maharashtra and Gujarat have been the most significant. In 1995 alone, the two states had more registered co-operatives than any other region in the country. Out of these, the agricultural cooperatives have received much attention. Many have focused on subsidies and credit to farmers and rather than collective gathering, they have focused on facilitating collective processing and marketing of produce. However, whilethey have led to increased productivity, their effect on equity in the region has been questioned, because membership in agricultural co-operatives has tended to favour landowners whilelimiting the entry of landless agricultural labourers. An example of co-operative success in Gujarat can be illustrated through dairy co-operatives, with the particular example of Amul (Anand Milk Union Limited).\nAmul was formed as a dairy cooperative in 1946, in the city of Anand, Gujarat. The cooperative, Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation Ltd.\n(GCMMF), is jointly owned by around 2.6\u00a0million milk producers in Gujarat. Amul has been seen as one of the best examples of cooperative achievement and success in a developing economy and the Amul pattern of growth has been taken as a model for rural development, particularly in the agricultural sector of developing economies. The company stirred the White Revolution of India (also known as Operation Flood), the world's biggest dairy development program, and made the milk-deficient nation of India the largest milk producer in the world, in 2010. The \"Amul Model\" aims to stop the exploitation by middlemen and encourage freedom of movement since the farmers are in control of procurement, processing and packaging of the milk and milk products. The company is worth 2.5\u00a0billion US dollars (as of 2012[ [update]]).\n70% of Gujarat's area is classified as semi-arid to arid climatically, thus the demand on water from various economic activities puts a strain on the supply. Of the total gross irrigated area, 16\u201317% is irrigated by government-owned canals and 83\u201384% by privately owned tube wells and other wells extracting groundwater, which is the predominant source of irrigation and water supply to the agricultural areas. As a result, Gujarat has faced problems with groundwater depletion, especially after demand for water increased in the 1960s. As access to electricity in rural areas increased, submersible electric pumps became more popular in the 1980s and 1990s. However, the Gujarat Electricity Board switched to flat tariff rates linked to the horsepower of pumps, which increased tubewell irrigation again and decreased the use of electric pumps. By the 1990s, groundwater abstraction rates exceeded groundwater recharge rate in many districts, while only 37.5% of all districts has \"safe\" recharge rates. Groundwater maintenance and preventing unnecessary loss of the available water supplies is now an issue faced by the state. The Sardar Sarovar Project, a debated dam project in the Narmada valley consisting of a network of canals, has significantly increased irrigation in the region. However, its impact on communities who were displaced is still a contested issue. In 2012 Gujarat began an experiment to reduce water loss due to evaporation in canals and to increase sustainability in the area, by constructing solar panels over the canals. In a one megawatt (MW) solar power project set up at Chandrasan, Gujarat uses solar panels fixed over a 750-metre stretch of an irrigation canal. Unlike many solar power projects, this one does not take up large amounts of land since the panels are constructed over the canals, and not on additional land. This results in lower upfront costs since land does not need to be acquired, cleared or modified to set up the panels. The Chandrasan project is projected to save 9\u00a0million litres of water per year.\nThe Government of Gujarat, to improve soil management and introduce farmers to new technology, started on a project which involved giving every farmer a Soil Health Card. This acts like a ration card, providing permanent identification for the status of cultivated land, as well as farmers' names, account numbers, survey numbers, soil fertility status and general fertiliser dose. Samples of land from each village are taken and analysed by the Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertiliser Corporation, State Fertiliser Corporation and Indian Farmers Fertilisers Co-operative. 1,200,000 soil test data from the villages was collected as of 2008, from farmer's field villages have gone into a database. Assistance and advice for this project was given by local agricultural universities and crop and soil-specific data was added to the database. This allows the soil test data to be interpreted and recommendations or adjustments made in terms of fertiliser requirements, which are also added to the database.\nCulture.\nLiterature.\nThe city of Patan was renowned for its collection of ancient Jain manuscripts and as a royal capital of Jain learning, which has drawn the admiration of many scholars. British Indologist and Sanskritist Peter Peterson described the collection as follows: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I know of no town in India and only a few in the world which can boast of so great a store documents of venerable antiquity. They would be the pride and jealously guarded treasure of any University Library in Europe.\nThe history of Gujarati literature may be traced back to 1000 CE. Well-known laureates of Gujarati literature include Hemchandracharya, Narsinh Mehta, Mirabai, Akho, Premanand Bhatt, Shamal Bhatt, Dayaram, Dalpatram, Narmad, Govardhanram Tripathi, Mahatma Gandhi, K. M. Munshi, Umashankar Joshi, Suresh Joshi, Swaminarayan, Pannalal Patel and Rajendra Shah.\nKavi Kant, Zaverchand Meghani and Kalapi are famous Gujarati poets.\nGujarat Vidhya Sabha, Gujarat Sahitya Sabha, and Gujarati Sahitya Parishad are Ahmedabad based literary institutions promoting the spread of Gujarati literature.\nSaraswatichandra is a landmark novel by Govardhanram Tripathi. Writers like Aanand Shankar Dhruv, Ashvini Bhatt, Balwantray Thakore, Bhaven Kachhi, Bhagwatikumar Sharma, Chandrakant Bakshi, Gunvant Shah, Harindra Dave, Harkisan Mehta, Jay Vasavada, Jyotindra Dave, Kanti Bhatt, Kavi Nanalal, Khabardar, Sundaram, Makarand Dave, Ramesh Parekh, Suresh Dalal, Tarak Mehta, Vinod Bhatt, Dhruv Bhatt and Varsha Adalja have influenced Gujarati thinkers.\nA notable contribution to Gujarati literature came from the Swaminarayan paramhanso, like Brahmanand Swami, Premanand, with prose like Vachanamrut and poetry in the form of bhajans.\nShrimad Rajchandra Vachnamrut and Shri Atma Siddhi Shastra, written in 19th century by Jain philosopher and poet Shrimad Rajchandra (Mahatma Gandhi's guru) are very well known.\nGujarati theatre owes a lot to Bhavai. Bhavai is a folk musical performance of stage plays. Ketan Mehta and Sanjay Leela Bhansali explored artistic use of bhavai in films such as \"Bhavni Bhavai\", \"Oh Darling! Yeh Hai India\" and \"Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam\". Dayro (gathering) involves singing and conversation reflecting on human nature.\nMumbai theatre veteran, Alyque Padamsee, best known in the English-speaking world for playing Muhammad Ali Jinnah in Sir Richard Attenborough's \"Gandhi\", was from a traditional Gujarati-Kutchi family from Kathiawar.\nCuisine.\nGujarati food is primarily vegetarian. The typical Gujarati \"thali\" consists of \"rotli\" or \"bhakhari or thepala or rotlo\", \"dal\" or \"kadhi\", \"khichdi\", Bhat and \"shak\". Athanu (Indian pickle) and \"chhundo\" are used as condiments. The four major regions of Gujarat all bring their own styles to Gujarati food. Many Gujarati dishes are distinctively sweet, salty, and spicy at the same time. In the Saurashtra region, \"chhash\" (buttermilk) is believed to be a must-have in their daily food.\nCinema.\nThe Gujarati film industry dates back to 1932, when the first Gujarati film, \"Narsinh Mehta\", was released. After flourishing through the 1960s to 1980s, the industry saw a decline. The industry is revived in recent times. The film industry has produced more than one thousand films since its inception. The Government of Gujarat announced a 100% entertainment tax exemption for Gujarati films in 2005 and a policy of incentives in 2016.\nMusic.\nGujarati folk music, known as \"Sugam Sangeet\", is a hereditary profession of the Barot community. Gadhvi and Charan communities have contributed heavily in modern times. The omnipresent instruments in Gujarati folk music include wind instruments, such as , , and , string instruments, such as the , , and and percussion instruments, such as the and pot drum.\nFestivals.\nThe folk traditions of Gujarat include and . \"Bhavai\" is a folk theatre; it is partly entertainment and partly ritual, and is dedicated to Amba. The is a folk dance done as a celebration of Navratri by Gujarati people. The folk costume of this dance is \"chaniya choli\" for women and for men. Different styles and steps of include , simple five, simple seven, , (hand movement which forms an imagery triangle), , , butterfly, , two claps and many more. is one of the oldest form of garba where all the women wear red patola sari and sing along while dancing. It is a very graceful form of garba.\n\"Makar Sankranti\" is a festival where people of Gujarat fly kites. In Gujarat, from December through to \"Makar Sankranti\", people start enjoying kite flying. \"Undhiyu\", a special dish made of various vegetables, is a must-have of Gujarati people on \"Makar Sankranti\". Surat is especially well known for the strong string which is made by applying glass powder on the row thread to provide it a cutting edge.\nApart from Navratri and Makar Sankranti (Uttarayana), Diwali, Holi, Janmashtami, Raksha Bandhan, Dusshera, Rama Navami, Mahavir Janma Kalyanak, Eid, Tazia, Paryushan, Bhavnath fair, and others are also celebrated.\nDiffusion of culture.\nDue to close proximity to the Arabian Sea, Gujarat has developed a mercantile ethos which maintained a cultural tradition of seafaring, long-distance trade, and overseas contacts with the outside world since ancient times, and the diffusion of culture through Gujarati diaspora was a logical outcome of such a tradition. During the pre-modern period, various European sources have observed that these merchants formed diaspora communities outside of Gujarat, and in many parts of the world, such as the Persian Gulf, Middle East, Horn of Africa, Hong Kong, Indonesia, and Philippines. long before the internal rise of the Maratha dynasty, and the British Raj colonial occupation.\nEarly 1st-century Western historians such as Strabo and Dio Cassius are testament to Gujarati people's role in the spread of Buddhism in the Mediterranean, when it was recorded that the \"sramana\" monk Zarmanochegas (\u0396\u03b1\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c7\u03b7\u03b3\u1f70\u03c2) of Barygaza met Nicholas of Damascus in Antioch while Augustus ruled the Roman Empire, and shortly thereafter proceeded to Athens where died by setting himself on fire to demonstrate his faith. A tomb to the \"sramana\", was still visible in the time of Plutarch, which bore the mention \"\u0396\u0391\u03a1\u039c\u0391\u039d\u039f\u03a7\u0397\u0393\u0391\u03a3 \u0399\u039d\u0394\u039f\u03a3 \u0391\u03a0\u039f \u0392\u0391\u03a1\u0393\u039f\u03a3\u0397\u03a3\" (\"The \"sramana\" master from Barygaza in India\").\nThe progenitor of the Sinhala language is believed to have been Prince Vijaya, son of King Simhabahu, who ruled Simhapura (modern-day Sihor near Bhavnagar). Prince Vijaya was banished by his father for his lawlessness and set forth with a band of adventurers. This tradition was followed by other Gujaratis. For example, in the Ajanta frescoes, a Gujarati prince is shown entering Sri Lanka.\nMany Indians migrated to Indonesia and the Philippines, most of them Gujaratis. King Aji Saka, who is said to have come to Java in Indonesia in year 1 of the Saka calendar, is believed by some to have been a king of Gujarat. The first Indian settlements in the Philippines and Java Island of Indonesia are believed to have been established with the coming of Prince Dhruvavijaya of Gujarat, with 5000 traders. Some stories propose a Brahmin named Tritresta was the first to bring Gujarati migrants with him to Java, so some scholars equate him with Aji Saka. A Gujarati ship has been depicted in a sculpture at Borabudur, Java.\nTourism.\nGujarat's natural environment includes the Great Rann of Kutch and the hills of Saputara, and it is the sole home of pure Asiatic lions in the world. During the reigns of the sultans, Hindu craftsmanship blended with Islamic architecture, giving rise to the Indo-Saracenic style. Many structures in the state are built in this fashion. It is also the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, figures of India's Independence movement. Amitabh Bachchan is currently the brand ambassador of Gujarat Tourism.\nMuseums and memorials.\nGujarat has a variety of museums on different genres that are run by the state's Department of Museums located at the principal state museum, Baroda Museum &amp; Picture Gallery in Vadodara, which is also the location of the Maharaja Fateh Singh Museum. The Kirti Mandir, Porbandar, Sabarmati Ashram, and Kaba Gandhi No Delo are museums related to Mahatma Gandhi, the former being the place of his birth and the latter two where he lived in his lifetime. Kaba Gandhi No Delo in Rajkot exhibits part of a rare collection of photographs relating to the life of Mahatma Gandhi. Sabarmati Ashram is the place where Gandhi initiated the Dandi March. On 12 March 1930 he vowed that he would not return to the Ashram until India won independence.\nThe Maharaja Fateh Singh Museum is housed within Lakshmi Vilas Palace, the residence of the erstwhile Maharajas, located in Vadodara.\nThe Calico Museum of Textiles is managed by the Sarabhai Foundation and is one of the most popular tourist spots in Ahmedabad.\nThe Lakhota Museum at Jamnagar is a palace transformed into museum, which was residence of the Jadeja Rajputs.

Palitana is the world's only mountain with more than 900 temples. Girnar Mahatirth is another major pilgrimage destination for Jains.\nFairs.\nA five-day festival is held during Maha Shivaratri at the fort of Girnar, Junagadh, known as the Bhavanth Mahadev Fair (Gujarati: \u0aad\u0ab5\u0aa8\u0abe\u0aa5 \u0aa8\u0acb \u0aae\u0ac7\u0ab3\u0acb). The Kutch Festival or Rann Festival (Gujarati: \u0a95\u0a9a\u0acd\u0a9b or \u0ab0\u0aa3 \u0a89\u0aa4\u0acd\u0ab8\u0ab5) is a festival celebrated at Kutch during Mahashivratri.

The village is visited by the largest number of sanghas (pilgrim groups) during the fair. Many of them go there on foot, which is particularly enriching as it happens immediately after the monsoon, when the landscape is rich with greenery, streams are full of sparkling water and the air is fresh. About 1.5\u00a0million devotees are known to attend this fair each year from all over the world. Not only Hindus, but some devout Jains and Parsis also attend the functions, while some Muslims attend the fair for trade.\nThe Tarnetar Fair is held during the first week of \"Bhadrapad\", (September\u2013October according to Gregorian calendar), and mostly serves as a place to find a suitable bride for tribal people from Gujarat.

It was extracted in the 17th century from the Kollur Mine in Andhra Pradesh, India. The gemstone's exceptional size has revealed new information about the formation of diamonds.\nThe Hope Diamond's recorded history begins in 1666, when the French gem merchant Jean-Baptiste Tavernier purchased the raw Golconda stone in India. After cutting the gem and renaming it \"the French Blue\" (\"Le bleu de France\"), Tavernier sold it to King Louis XIV of France in 1668. It was stolen in 1792, received and re-cut, with the diamond appearing under the Hope name in an 1839 gem catalogue from the Hope banking family, from whom the diamond's name derives.\nThe Hope Diamond's last private owner was the American jeweler Harry Winston, who bought it in 1949 from the estate of the mining heiress and socialite Evalyn Walsh McLean. After exhibiting the diamond on tour for several years, Winston set it in a necklace and it was donated in 1958 to the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C., where it remains on permanent exhibition.\nClassification.\nThe Hope Diamond is a large, , deep-blue diamond, studded in a pendant \"Toison d \u2019or\". It is a dark greyish-blue color under ordinary light due to trace amounts of boron within its crystal structure, and it exhibits a red phosphorescence under exposure to ultraviolet light. It is classified as a type IIb diamond.\nThe Hope Diamond is currently housed in the National Gem and Mineral collection at the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C. It has changed hands numerous times on its way from Hyderabad, India, to France, Great Britain, and the United States, where it is on public display. It has been described as the \"most famous diamond in the world\".\nPhysical properties.\nVisually, the gray modifier (mask) is so dark (indigo) that it produces an \"inky\" effect, appearing almost blackish-blue in incandescent light. Current photographs of the Hope Diamond use high-intensity light sources that tend to maximize the brilliance of gemstones. In popular literature, many superlatives have been used to describe the Hope Diamond as a \"superfine deep blue,\" often comparing it to the color of a fine sapphire\u2014for example, \"blue of the most beautiful blue sapphire\" (Deulafait)\u2014and describing its color as \"a sapphire blue.\" Tavernier described it as a \"beautiful violet\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;You cradle the 45.5-carat stone\u2014about the size of a walnut and heavier than its translucence makes it appear\u2014turning it from side to side as the light flashes from its facets, knowing it's the hardest natural material yet fearful of dropping it.\nHistory.\nGeological beginnings.\nThe Hope Diamond was formed deep within the Earth approximately 1.1 billion years ago. Like all diamonds, it was formed when carbon atoms formed strong bonds with each other. The Hope Diamond was originally embedded in kimberlite and was later extracted and refined to form the current gem. The Hope Diamond contains trace amounts of boron atoms intermixed with the carbon structure, which results in the rare blue color of the diamond.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;People typically think of the Hope Diamond as a historic gem, but... it's [important] as a rare scientific specimen that can provide vital insights into our knowledge of diamonds and how they are formed in the earth.\nIndia.\nSeveral accounts, based on remarks written by French gem merchant Jean-Baptiste Tavernier, who obtained the gem in India in 1666, suggest that the gemstone originated in India, in the Kollur mine in the Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh (which, at the time, was part of the Golconda kingdom of the Qutb Shahi dynasty).\nTavernier's book, the \"Six Voyages\" (French: \"Les Six Voyages de J. B. Tavernier\"), contains sketches of several large diamonds that he sold to King Louis XIV, possibly in 1668 or 1669; a blue diamond is shown among these, and Tavernier mentions the mines at \"Gani Coulour\" (Kollur Mine) as a source of colored diamonds, but no direct mention of the stone is made. Historian Richard Kurin has built a highly speculative case for 1653 as the year of acquisition, but the most that can be said with certainty is that Tavernier obtained the blue diamond during one of his five voyages to India between the years 1640 and 1667. One report suggests he took 25 diamonds to Paris, including the large rock which became the Hope, and sold all of them to King Louis XIV. Another report suggested that in 1669, Tavernier sold this large blue diamond along with approximately one thousand other diamonds to King Louis XIV for 220,000 livres\u2014the equivalent of 147 kilograms of pure gold.\nIn the historical novel, \"The French Blue\", gemologist and historian Richard W. Wise proposes that the patent of nobility granted to Tavernier by Louis XIV was part of the payment for the Tavernier Blue. According to the theory, Jean-Baptiste Colbert (the King's Finance Minister at the time) regularly sold noble offices and titles for cash; an outright patent of nobility, according to Wise, was worth approximately 500,000 livres. That amount, plus the reported sale to the King, would have totaled about 720,000 livres, half the price of Tavernier's initial estimate for the gem. There has been controversy regarding the actual weight of the stone: Morel believed that the stated in Tavernier's invoice would be in old French carats, thus 115.28 metric carats.\nFrance.\nIn 1678, Louis XIV commissioned the court jeweler Jean Pitau to recut the Tavernier Blue, resulting in a stone which royal inventories thereafter listed as the Blue Diamond of the Crown of France (). Later English-speaking historians have simply called it the French Blue. The king had the stone set on a cravat-pin.\nAccording to one report, Louis ordered Pitau to \"make him a piece to remember\", and Pitau worked for two years, resulting in a \"triangular-shaped gem the size of a pigeon's egg that took the breath away as it snared the light, reflecting it back in bluish-grey rays.\" It was set in gold and was supported by a ribbon for the neck which was worn by the king during ceremonies.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;At the diamond's dazzling heart was a sun with seven facets\u2014the sun being Louis' emblem, and seven being a number rich in meaning in biblical cosmology, indicating divinity and spirituality.\nIn 1749, Louis XIV's great-grandson, Louis XV, had the French Blue set into a more elaborate jeweled pendant for the \"Order of the Golden Fleece\" by court jeweler Andr\u00e9 Jacquemin. The assembled piece included a red spinel of carats shaped as a dragon breathing \"covetous flames,\" as well as 83 red-painted diamonds and 112 yellow-painted diamonds to suggest a fleece shape.\nThe piece fell into disuse after the death of Louis XV. The diamond became the property of his grandson Louis XVI. whose wife, queen Marie Antoinette, used many of the French Crown Jewels for personal adornment by having the individual gems placed in new settings and combinations, but the French Blue remained in this pendant (except for a brief time in 1787, when the stone was removed for scientific study by Mathurin Jacques Brisson).\nTheft, disappearance and concealment.\nOn September 11, 1792, while Louis XVI and his family were imprisoned in the Square du Temple during the early stages of the French Revolution's Reign of Terror, a group of thieves broke into the Royal Storehouse\u2014the \"H\u00f4tel du Garde-Meuble de la Couronne\" (now \"H\u00f4tel de la Marine\")\u2014stealing most of the Crown Jewels in a five-day looting spree. While many jewels were later recovered, including other pieces of the \"Order of the Golden Fleece\", the French Blue was not among them and it disappeared from history.\nOn January 21, 1793, Louis XVI was guillotined; Marie Antoinette was guillotined on October 16 of the same year. These beheadings are commonly cited as a result of the diamond's \"curse,\" but the historical record suggests that Marie Antoinette had never worn the Golden Fleece pendant because it had been reserved for the exclusive use of the King.\nA likely scenario is that the French Blue, sometimes also known as the Blue Diamond, was \"swiftly smuggled to London\" after being seized in 1792 in Paris. But, the exact rock known as the French Blue was never seen again, since it almost certainly was recut during this decades-long period of anonymity, with the largest remaining piece becoming the Hope Diamond. One report suggested that the cut was a \"butchered job\" because it sheared off from the larger rock as well as hurting its \"extraordinary luster.\"\nIt was long believed that the Hope Diamond was cut from the French Blue, but confirmation came when a three-dimensional leaden model of the latter was rediscovered in the archives of the Paris National Museum of Natural History in 2005. Previously, the dimensions of the French Blue had been known only from two drawings made in 1749 and 1789; although the model differs slightly from the drawings in some details, these details are identical to features of the Hope Diamond, allowing CAD technology to digitally reconstruct the French Blue around the recut stone.\nThe leaden model revealed 20 unknown facets on the back of the French Blue. It also confirmed the diamond underwent a rather rough recut that removed the three points and reduced the thickness by a few millimeters. The Sun King's blue diamond became unrecognizable and the baroque style of the original cut was definitely lost.\nHistorians suggested that one burglar, Cadet Guillot, took several jewels, including the French Blue and the \"C\u00f4te-de-Bretagne\" spinel, to Le Havre and then to London, where the French Blue was cut in two pieces.\nMorel adds that in 1796, Guillot attempted to resell the \"C\u00f4te-de-Bretagne\" in France but was forced to relinquish it to fellow thief Lancry de la Loyelle, who put Guillot into debtors' prison.\nIn a contrasting report, historian Richard Kurin speculated that the \"theft\" of the French Crown Jewels was in fact engineered by the revolutionary leader Georges Danton as part of a plan to bribe an opposing military commander, Duke Karl Wilhelm of Brunswick. When under attack by Napoleon in 1805, Karl Wilhelm may have had the French Blue recut to disguise its identity; in this form, the stone could have come to Great Britain in 1806, when his family fled there to join his daughter Caroline of Brunswick. Although Caroline was the wife of the Prince Regent (later King George IV), she lived apart from her husband, and financial straits sometimes forced her to quietly sell her own jewels to support her household. Caroline's nephew, Duke Karl Friedrich, was later known to possess a blue diamond which was widely thought to be another piece of the French Blue.\nThis smaller diamond's present whereabouts are unknown. A 2010 three-dimensional reconstruction of the French Blue from an authenticated lead cast of the jewel fits too tightly around the Hope Diamond to allow for the existence of a sister stone of that size, and concluded that there could be no significant offcuts from refaceting the French Blue into the Hope Diamond.\nUnited Kingdom.\nA blue diamond with the same shape, size, and color as the Hope Diamond was recorded by John Francillon as in the possession of the London diamond merchant Daniel Eliason in September 1812, the earliest point when the history of the Hope Diamond can be definitively fixed, although a second, less definitive report claims that the Hope Diamond's \"authentic history\" can only be traced back to 1830. The jewel was a \"massive blue stone of \" and weighed ( = 1 carat). The 1812 date was just days after 20 years since the theft of the French Blue, just as the statute of limitations for the crime had taken effect.\nWhile the diamond had disappeared for two decades, there were questions whether this diamond now in Great Britain was exactly the same one as had belonged to the French kings. Scientific investigation in 2008 confirmed \"beyond reasonable doubt\" that the Hope Diamond and that owned by the kings of France were, indeed, the same gemstone.\nThere are conflicting reports about what happened to the diamond during these years. Eliason's diamond may have been acquired by George IV, possibly through Caroline of Brunswick; however, there is no record of the ownership in the Royal Archives at Windsor, although some secondary evidence exists in the form of contemporary writings and artwork, and George IV tended to mix up the Crown property of the Crown jewels with family heirlooms and his own personal property.\nA source at the Smithsonian suggested there were \"several references\" suggesting that George had indeed owned the diamond. After his death in 1830, it has been alleged that some of this mixed collection was stolen by George's last mistress, Elizabeth Conyngham, and some of his personal effects were discreetly liquidated to cover the many debts he had left behind him. Another report states that the king's debts were \"so enormous\" that the diamond was probably sold through \"private channels\". In either case, the blue diamond was not retained by the British royal family.\nThe stone was later reported to have been acquired by a rich London banker named Thomas Hope, for either $65,000 or $90,000. It has been suggested that Eliason may have been a \"front\" for Hope, acting not as a diamond merchant venturing money on his own account, but rather as an agent to acquire the diamond for the banker. In 1839, the Hope Diamond appeared in a published catalog of the gem collection of his brother Henry Philip Hope, members of the Anglo-Dutch banking family Hope &amp; Co.\nThe stone was set in a fairly simple medallion surrounded by many smaller white diamonds, which he sometimes lent to Louisa de la Poer Beresford, the widow of his brother, Thomas Hope, for society balls. After falling into the ownership of the Hope family, the stone came to be known as the \"Hope Diamond\".\nHenry Philip Hope died in 1839, the same year as the publication of his collection catalog. His three nephews, the sons of Thomas and Louisa, fought in court for ten years over his inheritance, and ultimately the collection was split up. The oldest nephew, Henry Thomas Hope, received eight of the most valuable gems, including the Hope Diamond. It was displayed in the Great Exhibition of London in 1851 and at the 1855 Exposition Universelle in Paris, but was usually kept in a bank vault. In 1861, Henry Thomas Hope's only child, Henrietta, married Henry Pelham-Clinton (and later Duke of Newcastle).\nWhen Hope died on December 4, 1862, his wife Anne Adele inherited the gem, but she feared that the profligate lifestyle of her son-in-law might cause him to sell the Hope properties. Upon Adele's death in 1884, the entire Hope estate, including the Hope Diamond, was entrusted to Henrietta's younger son, Henry Francis Pelham-Clinton, on the condition that he add the name of \"Hope\" to his own surnames when he reached the age of legal majority.\nAs Lord Francis Hope, this grandson received his legacy in 1887. However, he had only a life interest in his inheritance, meaning that he could not sell any part of it without court permission.\nIn 1894, Lord Francis Hope met the American concert hall singer May Yoh\u00e9, who has been described as \"the sensation of two continents\", and they were married the same year; one account suggests that Yoh\u00e9 wore the Hope Diamond on at least one occasion.\nShe later claimed that she had worn it at social gatherings and had an exact replica made for her performances, but her husband claimed otherwise. Lord Francis lived beyond his means, and this eventually caught up with him, leading to marriage troubles and financial reverses, and he found that he had to sell the diamond.\nIn 1896, his bankruptcy was discharged, but, as he could not sell the Hope Diamond without the court's permission, he was supported financially by his wife during these intervening years. In 1901, the financial situation had changed, and after a \"long legal fight,\" he was given permission to sell the Hope Diamond by an order of the Master in Chancery to \"pay off debts\". But May Yoh\u00e9 ran off with a gentleman friend named Putnam Strong, who was a son of the former New York City mayor William L. Strong. Francis Hope and May Yoh\u00e9 were divorced in 1902.\nFrancis sold the diamond for \u00a329,000 (\u00a3 million today), to Adolph Weil, a London jewel merchant. Weil sold the stone in 1901 to the diamond dealer Simon Frankel, based in New York and/or London who took it to New York. One report stated that he had paid $250,000 ($ million today). However, in New York it was evaluated to be worth $141,032 ($ million today).\nUnited States (1902\u2013present).\nAccounts vary about what happened to the diamond during the years 1902\u20131907; one account suggested that it lay in the William &amp; Theodore safe during these years while the jewelers took it out periodically to show it to wealthy Americans; a rival account, probably invented to help add \"mystery\" to the Hope Diamond story, suggested that some persons had bought it but apparently sold it back to Frankel. There were reports in one story in \"The New York Times\" of several owners of the gem, perhaps who had bought it from Frankel and owned it temporarily who met with ill-fortune, but this report conflicts with the more likely possibility that the gem remained in the hands of the Frankel jewelry firm during these years. Like many jewelry firms, the Frankel business ran into financial difficulties during the depression of 1907 and referred to the gem as the \"hoodoo diamond.\"\nIn 1908, Frankel sold the diamond for $400,000 ($ million today) to a Salomon or Selim Habib, a wealthy Turkish diamond collector, reportedly on behalf of Sultan Abdulhamid of the Ottoman Empire; however, on June 24, 1909, the stone was included in an auction of Habib's assets to settle his own debts, and the auction catalog explicitly stated that the Hope Diamond was one of only two gems in the collection which had never been owned by the Sultan. A contrary report, however, suggested that Sultan Abdul Hamid did own the gem but ordered Habib to sell it when his throne \"began to totter.\" Habib reportedly sold the stone in Paris in 1909 for $80,000 ($ million today). The Parisian jewel merchant Simon Rosenau bought the Hope Diamond for 400,000 francs and resold it in 1910 to Pierre Cartier for 550,000 francs. In 1910, it was offered for $150,000 ($ million today), according to one report.\nPierre Cartier tried to sell the Hope Diamond to Washington, D.C., socialite Evalyn Walsh McLean and her husband in 1910. Cartier was a consummate salesman who used an understated presentation to entice Mrs. McLean. He described the gem's illustrious history to her while keeping it concealed underneath special wrapping paper. The suspense worked: McLean became impatient to the point where she suddenly requested to see the stone. She recalled later that Cartier \"held before our eyes the Hope Diamond.\" Nevertheless, she initially rejected the offer. Cartier had it reset. She found the stone much more appealing in this new modern style. There were conflicting reports about the sale in \"The New York Times\"; one account suggested that the young McLean couple had agreed to purchase the diamond, but after having learned about its unfortunate supposed history, the couple had wanted to back out of the deal since they knew nothing of the \"history of misfortunes that have beset its various owners.\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Both Ned McLean and his pretty wife are quite young, and in a way unsophisticated, although they were born and reared in an atmosphere of wealth and luxury. All their lives they have known more of jewelry, finery, banquets, automobiles, horses, and other articles of pleasure than they have of books, with their wealth of knowledge.\u2014\u200a\nThe brouhaha over the diamond's supposed \"ill luck\" prompted a worried editor of \"The Jewelers' Circular-Weekly\" to write:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;No mention of any ill luck having befallen Eliason, Hope, or any of their descendants was ever made. The Frankels surely were very prosperous while the stone was in their possession, as were the dealers who held it in Europe. Habib's misfortune referred to in the newspaper accounts occurred long after he had sold the stone... As Francis Hope never had the stone and May Yohe probably never saw it ... the newspaper accounts at the time mentioned were laughed at, but since then it has been the custom not only to revive these stories every time mention of the stone appears in the public press, but to add to them fictitious incidents of misfortune as to alleged possessors of the stone at various times.\u2014\u200a\nThe tenuous deal involved wrangling among attorneys for both Cartier and the McLeans, but finally, in 1911, the couple bought the gem for over $300,000 (over $ million today), although there are differing estimates of the sales price at $150,000 and $180,000. An alternative scenario is that the McLeans may have fabricated concern about the supposed \"curse\" to generate publicity to increase the value of their investment.\nA description was that the gemstone \"lay on a bed of white silk and surrounded by many small white diamonds cut pear shaped\". The new setting was the current platinum framework surrounded by a row of sixteen diamonds which alternated between old mine cut and pear-shaped variants. Mrs. McLean wore it to a \"brilliant reception\" in February 1912 when it was reported that it was the first time it had been worn in public since it had \"changed owners.\" She would \"sport the diamond at social events\" and wore it to numerous social occasions that she had organized.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Hope Diamond in its original pendant must have looked fantastic at parties circa the 1920s, when it hung around the neck of owner Evalyn Walsh McLean's Great Dane, Mike.\u2014\u200a\nThere were reports that she misplaced it at parties, deliberately and frequently, and then make a children's game out of \"finding the Hope\", and times when she hid the diamond somewhere on her estate during the \"lavish parties she threw and invite guests to find it.\" The stone prompted elaborate security precautions:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;William Schindele, a former Secret Service man, has been engaged to guard the stone. He in turn will be guarded by Leo Costello and Simeon Blake, private detectives. The stone will be kept at the McLean mansion during the day and each night will be deposited in a safe deposit vault. When Mrs. McLean wears the gem at balls and receptions arrangements have been made to keep the safe deposit building open until after the function that the stone may be safely stored away. A special automobile has been purchased to convey the guards to and from the house to the trust company's building.\u2014\u200a\nBut the stone was not stolen during their ownership. When Mrs. McLean died in 1947, she bequeathed the diamond to her grandchildren through a will which insisted that her former property would remain in the custody of trustees until the eldest child had reached 25 years of age. This requirement would have prevented any sale for the next two decades. However, the trustees gained permission to sell her jewels to settle her debts, and in 1949 sold them to New York diamond merchant Harry Winston. He purchased McLean's \"entire jewelry collection\". Over the next decade, Winston exhibited McLean's necklace in his \"Court of Jewels,\" a tour of jewels around the United States, as well as various promotional events and charity balls. The diamond appeared on the television quiz show \"The Name's the Same\", in an episode which first aired on August 16, 1955, when a teenaged contestant with the actual name \"Hope Diamond\" was one of the mystery guests, as well as at the August 1958 Canadian National Exhibition. At some point, Winston also had the Hope Diamond's bottom facet slightly recut to increase its brilliance.\nSmithsonian ownership.\nSmithsonian mineralogist George Switzer is credited with persuading jeweler Harry Winston to donate the Hope Diamond for a proposed national gem collection to be housed at the National Museum of Natural History. On November 10, 1958, Winston acquiesced, sending it through U.S. Mail in a box wrapped in brown paper as simple registered mail insured for $1 million at a cost of $145.29, of which $2.44 was for postage and the balance insurance. Upon its arrival it became Specimen #217868.\nWinston had never believed in any of the tales about the curse; he donated the diamond with the hope that it would help the United States \"establish a gem collection.\"\nWinston died many years later, in 1978, of a heart attack. Winston's gift, according to Smithsonian curator Dr. Jeffrey Post, indeed helped spur additional gifts to the museum.\nFor its first four decades in the National Museum of Natural History, the Hope Diamond lay in its necklace inside a glass-fronted safe as part of the gems and jewelry gallery, except for a few brief excursions: a 1962 exhibition to the Louvre; the 1965 Rand Easter Show in Johannesburg, South Africa; and two visits back to Harry Winston's premises in New York City, once in 1984, and once for a 50th anniversary celebration in 1996.\nTo guard against theft during the diamond's trip to the 1962 Louvre exhibition, Switzer traveled to Paris with the Hope Diamond tucked inside a velvet pouch sewn by his wife. The Hope Diamond was placed into the pouch, which was pinned inside Switzer's pants pocket for the flight.\nWhen the Smithsonian's gallery was renovated in 1997, the necklace was moved onto a rotating pedestal inside a cylinder made of thick bulletproof glass in its own display room, adjacent to the main exhibit of the National Gem Collection, in the Janet Annenberg Hooker Hall of Geology, Gems, and Minerals. The Hope Diamond is the most popular jewel on display and the collection's centerpiece.\nIn 1988, specialists with the Gemological Institute of America graded it and noticed \"evidence of wear\" and its \"remarkably strong phosphorescence\" with its clarity \"slightly affected by a whitish graining which is common to blue diamonds.\" A highly sensitive colorimeter found tiny traces of a \"very slight violet component\" which is imperceptible to normal vision.\nIn 2005, the Smithsonian published a year-long computer-aided geometry research which officially determined that the Hope Diamond is, in fact, cut from the stolen French Blue crown jewel.\nIn 2009, the Smithsonian announced a temporary new setting for the jewel to celebrate a half-century at the National Museum of Natural History. Starting in September 2009 it was exhibited as a stand-alone gem with no setting. It had been removed from its setting for cleaning from time to time, but this was the first time it would be on public display by itself. Previously it had been shown in a platinum setting, surrounded by 16 white pear-shaped and cushion-cut diamonds, suspended from a chain containing forty-five diamonds.\nThe Hope returned to its traditional setting in late 2010.\nOn November 18, 2010, the Hope Diamond was unveiled and displayed at the Smithsonian in a temporary newly designed necklace called \"Embracing Hope\", created by the Harry Winston firm. Three designs for the new setting, all white diamonds and white metal, were created and the public voted on the final version.\nThe Hope Diamond also is resting on a new dark blue neck form, which the Harry Winston firm commissioned from display organization, Pac Team Group. Previously, the Hope Diamond had been displayed as a loose gem since late summer of 2009 when it was removed from its former Cartier-designed setting. A Smithsonian curator described it as \"priceless\" because it was \"irreplaceable\", although it was reported to be insured for $250 million.\nOn January 13, 2012, the diamond was and the current necklace was implanted with another diamond worth \"at least a million dollars\". The necklace with the new diamond will be sold to benefit the Smithsonian.\nCurse mythology.\nSuperstitions, publicity, marketing.\nThe diamond has been surrounded by a mythology of a reputed \"curse\" to the effect that it brings misfortune and tragedy to anyone who owns it or wears it, but there are strong indications that such fabrications enhance the stone's mystery and appeal, since increased publicity usually raised the gem's value and newsworthiness.\nAccording to many specious accounts in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, the original form of the Hope Diamond was stolen from an eye of a sculpted statue of the Hindu goddess Sita. However, much like the \"curse of Tutankhamun\", this general type of \"legend\" was most likely the independent creation of Western authors during the Victorian era, and the specific legends about the Hope Diamond's \"cursed origin\" were invented in the early 20th century to add mystique to the stone and increase its sales appeal as well as increase newspaper sales.\nIt fueled speculation that persons possessing the gemstone were fated to have bad luck with varying reports of undetermined veracity. A report in 2006 in \"The New York Times\", however, suggested that \"any hard evidence linking it to tragedy has yet to be officially proven\".\nThere is evidence of several newspaper accounts which helped spread the \"curse\" story. A New Zealand newspaper article in 1888 described the supposedly lurid history of the Hope Diamond, including a claim that it was \"said once to have formed the single eye of a great idol\", as part of a confused description that also claimed that its namesake owner had personally \"brought it from India\", and that the diamond's true color was \"white, [although] when held to the light, it emits the most superb and dazzling blue rays\".\nAn article entitled \"Hope Diamond Has Brought Trouble To All Who Have Owned It\" appeared in \"The Washington Post\" in 1908. In 1909 upon reporting on the sale of the Hope Diamond The Times also gave an account of its history, noting \"its possession is the story of a long series of tragedies - murder, suicide, madness, and various other misfortunes.\"\nThese were followed by another \"New York Times\" article in 1911 which gave a list of supposed cases of ill-fortune, but with few confirmations from other sources:\nThe mainstream view is that these accounts are specious and speculative since there are few, if any, independent confirmations to back them up. A few months later, perhaps compounded by inaccurate reports in \"The New York Times\" on November 17, 1909, it was incorrectly reported that the diamond's former owner, Selim Habib, had drowned in a shipwreck of the steamer \"Seyne\" near Singapore; in fact, it was a different person with the same name, not the owner of the diamond. There was speculation that jeweler Pierre Cartier further embroidered the lurid tales to intrigue Evalyn Walsh McLean into buying the Hope Diamond in 1911.\nThe theme of greedy robbers stealing a valuable object from the tomb or shrine of an ancient god or ruler, and then being punished by it, is one which repeats in many different forms of literature. A likely source of inspiration for the fabrications was the Wilkie Collins' 1868 novel, \"The Moonstone\", which created a coherent narrative from vague and largely disregarded legends which had been attached to other diamonds such as the Koh-i-Noor and the Orloff diamond. The theme can be seen in stories about the curse of Egyptian king Tutankhamun and in films such as those of the \"Indiana Jones\" and \"The Mummy\" franchises. In keeping with these scripts, according to the legend, Tavernier did not buy the Hope diamond but stole it from a Hindu temple where it had been set as one of two matching eyes of an idol, and the temple priests then laid a curse on whoever might possess the missing stone. Largely because the other blue diamond \"eye\" never surfaced, historians dismissed the fantastical story.\nThe stories generally do not bear up to more pointed examination; for example, the legend that Tavernier's body was \"torn apart by wolves\" is inconsistent with historical evidence which shows that he lived to 84 and died of natural causes.\nIt is possible that the overblown story of the \"curse\", possibly fueled by Cartier and others, may have caused some hesitation on the part of the prospective buyers, the McLeans, around 1911. When a lawsuit between buyer and seller erupted about the terms of the deal, newspapers kept alive reports of the diamond's \"malevolent influence\" with reports like this one, which blamed the stone's \"curse\" on having caused, of all things, the lawsuit itself:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The malevolent influence that has for centuries dogged with discord and disaster the owners of the famous Hope diamond has started again and without waste of time, despite special precautions against ill-luck taken at the time of its last sale, according to John S. Wise, Jr., of 20 Broad Street, attorney for Cartiers, the Fifth Avenue jewelers, who are suing Mr. and Mrs. Edward B. McLean for $180,000, its alleged purchase price.\u2014\u200a\nThe Hope Diamond was also blamed for the unhappy fates of other historical figures vaguely linked to its ownership, such as the falls of Madame Athenais de Montespan and French finance minister, Nicolas Fouquet, during the reign of Louis XIV; the beheadings of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette and the rape and mutilation of the Princesse de Lamballe during the French Revolution; and the forced abdication of Turkish Sultan Abdul Hamid II who had supposedly killed various members of his court for the stone (despite the annotation in Habib's auction catalog). Even jewelers who may have handled the Hope Diamond were not spared from its reputed malice: the insanity and suicide of Jacques Colot, who supposedly bought it from Eliason, and the financial ruin of the jeweler Simon Frankel, who bought it from the Hope family, were linked to the stone. But although he is documented as a French diamond dealer of the correct era, Colot has no recorded connection with the stone, and Frankel's misfortunes were in the midst of economic straits that also ruined many of his peers.\nThe legend includes deaths of numerous other characters who had been previously unknown: Diamond cutter Wilhelm Fals, killed by his son Hendrik, who stole it and later committed suicide; Francois Beaulieu, who received the stone from Hendrik but starved to death after selling it to Eliason; a Russian prince named Kanitowski, who lent it to French actress Lorens Ladue and promptly shot her dead on the stage, and was himself stabbed to death by revolutionaries; Simon Montharides, hurled over a precipice with his family. However, the existence of only a few of these characters has been verified historically, leading researchers to conclude that most of these persons are fictitious.\nThe actress May Yohe made repeated attempts to capitalize on her identity as the former wife of the last Hope to own the diamond, and sometimes blamed the gemstone for her misfortunes. In July 1902, months after Lord Francis divorced her, she told police in Australia that her lover, Putnam Strong, had abandoned her and taken her jewels. In fact, the couple reconciled, married later that year, but divorced in 1910. On her third marriage in 1920, she persuaded film producer George Kleine to back a 15-episode serial \"The Hope Diamond Mystery\", which added fictitious characters to the tale, but the project was not successful. In 1921, she hired Henry Leyford Gates to help her write \"The Mystery of the Hope Diamond,\" in which she starred as Lady Francis Hope. The film added more characters, including a fictionalized Tavernier, and added Marat among the diamond's \"victims\". She also wore her copy of the Hope, trying to generate more publicity to further her career.\nEvalyn Walsh McLean added her own narrative to the story behind the blue jewel, including that one of the owners had been Catherine the Great, although there are no confirmations that the Russian ruler ever owned the diamond. McLean would bring the Diamond out for friends to try on, including Warren G. Harding and Florence Harding.\nSince the Smithsonian acquired the gemstone, the \"curse appears to have gone dormant.\" Owning the diamond has brought \"nothing but good luck\" for the nonprofit national museum, according to a Smithsonian curator, and has helped it build a \"world-class gem collection\" with rising attendance levels.\nReplicas.\nIn 2007, a lead cast of the French Blue diamond was discovered in the gemological collections of the National Museum of Natural History in Paris. This triggered an investigation by an international team of researchers into the stone's history, which previously had to rely on two-dimensional sketches of the diamond. The three-dimensional structure allowed researchers to apply techniques such as computer-aided drawing analysis.\nThe methods for digitally-reconstructing the gem are reviewed in this article's \"Theft and Disappearance\" section. The emblem of the Golden Fleece of Louis XV was reconstructed around the French Blue, including the \"C\u00f4te de Bretagne\" spinel of , the \"Bazu\" diamond of , 3 oriental topazes (yellow sapphires), five brilliants of up to and nearly 300 smaller diamonds.\nAs part of the investigation, the \"Tavernier Blue\" diamond was reconstructed from the original French edition of Tavernier's \"Voyages\" (rather than the later London edition, which had distorted and modified Tavernier's original figures). The Smithsonian Institution provided ray-tracing and optical spectroscopic data about the Hope diamond.\nThe lead cast had been catalogued at the French museum in 1850 and was provided by a prominent Parisian jeweler named Charles Archard who lived during the same generation as Ren\u00e9 Just Ha\u00fcy, who died in 1822. Most likely, the lead cast was made near 1815, because that was the year that similar entries from the 1850 catalogue had been made. The model was accompanied by a label stating that the \"French Blue\" was in the possession of a person known as \"Mr. Hope of London\". Other archives at the Mus\u00e9um suggests that Hope was a customer of Achard for many years, particularly for blue gems.\nThese findings have helped investigators piece together what may have happened during the rock's anonymous years during the several decades following 1792. According to one line of reasoning, the first \"Hope\" to have the \"Hope Diamond\"\u2014Henry Phillip Hope\u2014might have possessed the \"French Blue\" that he had acquired some time after the 1792 robbery in Paris, perhaps around 1794\u20131795, when the Hopes were believed to have left Holland for London to escape Napoleon's armies. At about the same time, Cadet Guillot, who may have been one of the thieves to have stolen the \"Golden Fleece\", arrived in London. This places Mr. Hope and Mr. Guillot in London at the same time. According to a late nineteenth century historian named Bapts, a contract was made between Cadet Guillot and a French aristocrat named Lancry de la Loyelle, in 1796, to sell the spinel-dragon of the Golden Fleece. According to this line of reasoning, in 1802 Hope sold his assets, and the continental blockade by Napoleon led the Hope's bank into a serious financial crisis by 1808, and the crisis peaked during the winter of 1811\u20131812 This put Mr. Hope in a financial bind. There is a possibility that, given his financial predicament, Hope pawned the \"French Blue\" to jewel merchant Eliason to get much-needed cash when the British currency, sterling, was highly depreciated. This is consistent with the entry in Eliason's records about having the stone in 1812.\nHowever, the diamond's owners may have felt pressure to recut the stone quickly to disguise its identity, since if the French government had learned of its existence, it may have sued the owners for repossession. Regardless of whether Mr. Hope had lost possession or kept it during these years, by 1824 it was again in his possession. It was around this time that Eliason died; Hope's financial situation had been restored thanks to efforts by the Barings, who saved the Hope bank in the difficult financial years of 1812\u20131820. Accordingly, if this is correct, then the lead cast of the \"French Blue\" and the \"Hope\" diamond are likely to have been created in the same workshop, possibly in London, and probably a little before 1812.\nThe lead cast had important ramifications since it gave enough information to curators at the French museum to commission the first exact replicas of both the Tavernier and French Blue diamonds using a material which simulates diamonds called cubic zirconia, with the help of artisans who work with gems (lapidaries), led by Scott Sucher. These replicas have been completed and displayed with the French Crown Jewels and the Great Sapphire of Louis XIV, a Moghul-cut sapphire of . Artisans recreated the elaborate parure of different-colored gems known as the \"Golden Fleece of King Louis XV of France\", which is arguably the most fabulous work in the history of French jewelry; this happened from 2007 to 2010. The original parure, created in 1749 by royal jeweler Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Jacquemin, was stolen and broken in 1792. The reassembled jewel contained the French Blue and the Bazu diamonds, as well as the C\u00f4te de Bretagne spinel and hundreds of smaller diamonds. Three years of work were needed to recreate this jewel, and it required exacting and precise skill which revealed not only the skill of today's lapidaries, but the skill of its original eighteenth-century designers. The reconstructed jewel was presented by Herbert Horovitz, with Fran\u00e7ois Farges of the French museum in attendance, at the former Royal Storehouse in Paris on June 30, 2010, which was the same site where the original had been stolen 218 years before.\nAdditional recreations were made possible by new discoveries. A previously unknown drawing of the Golden Fleece was rediscovered in Switzerland in the 1980s, and two blue diamonds that had ornamented the jewel were found as well, and these recent findings enabled artisans to recreate a copy of the \"emblem\". It led to the construction, using cubic zirconia, of a piece that almost exactly resembles the mythic \"French Blue\" masterpiece.\nThe emblem has another great blue diamond, which was later named \"the Bazu\" in reference to a dealer who reportedly had sold it to Louis XIV in 1669. This Bazu diamond was recut in 1749 as a baroque cushion weighing . The 1791 inventory mentioned that the Bazu was \"light sky blue\", which is consistent with the fact that the Golden Fleece of the Color Adornment was made of a variety of great colored gems. Based on documents kept in a private collection, it could be shown that this particular diamond was not hexagonal-shaped, as some historians had previously thought, but was in a shape best described as \"rounded squared\", similar to the so-called R\u00e9gent diamond. There is a report that a curator from the French museum will assert that the hexagonal cut from the Bazu is inconsistent historically and gemologically. The Bazu stone referred to another version of Louis XV's great Golden Fleece, made out of blue sapphires instead of blue diamonds. According to one view, this version appears to have never been manufactured but only suggested to the king as an alternative to the effective final version, bearing two blue diamonds. Nevertheless, replicas of both blue diamonds were cut by Scott Sucher using cubic zirconia, one being colored deep blue and the other light blue.\nThe emblem had a third great gem known as \"The C\u00f4te de Bretagne dragon\". Its replica was based on a wax likeness sculpted by Pascal Monney, who had based his recreation from three-dimensional scaled pictures of the original object which had been made by French artist Fran\u00e7ois Farges; Farges, in turn, had seen the original objects displayed at the Louvre's Galerie d'Apollon. In addition, artist Etienne Leperlier cast a \"crystal\" lead glass duplicate of the wax replica of the carved C\u00f4te de Bretagne. Its pigmentation is made out of gold and manganese pigments to simulate as close as possible the original color of the spinel.\nThe 500-plus remaining replicas of diamonds were cut from cubic zirconia using a baroque cushion cut. Colors were used to recall the original artwork: red for the flames, and yellow for the fleece, and in keeping with the original work, the materials used were initially colorless but were painted in the same fashion used by the artist Jacquemin when the original Golden Fleece was completed in 1749. Since the original was most likely made out of gold plated with silver, a choice was made to use a matrix mostly made out of 925-grade silver to keep costs under control without compromising quality. A number of different artists helped with this project:\nAll stones were set according to 18th-century techniques. Finally, a luxury box containing the Golden Fleece was recreated by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Viollet using crimson-colored Moroccan leather. The box was gilded by Didier Montecot to the arms of Louis XV, using the king's original iron stamp made by the Simier house. A dark red cramoisi ribbon, made of crimson satin moire, holds the jewel inside the box.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His grandfather, Antoine C\u00e9sar Becquerel, father, Edmond Becquerel, and later his son, Jean Becquerel were all notable physicists. \nBecquerel attended the , before studying engineering at (1872\u20131874) and (1874\u20131877). In 1888, he received his D.Sc. from the Sorbonne; his thesis was on the plane polarisation of light, with the phenomenon of phosphorescence and absorption of light by crystals.\nIn 1878, Becquerel became an assistant at the , where in 1892 he was appointed Professor of Applied Physics. In 1894, he became chief engineer in the Department of Roads and Bridges. He became a professor at in 1895.\nDiscovery of radioactivity.\nBecquerel's discovery of spontaneous radioactivity is a famous example of serendipity, of how chance favours the prepared mind. Becquerel had long been interested in phosphorescence, the emission of light of one colour following the object's exposure to light of another colour. In early 1896, there was a wave of excitement following Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen's discovery of X-rays in late 1895. During the experiment, R\u00f6ntgen \"found that the Crookes tubes he had been using to study cathode rays emitted a new kind of invisible ray that was capable of penetrating through black paper\". Becquerel learned of R\u00f6ntgen's discovery during a meeting of the French Academy of Sciences on 20 January where his colleague Henri Poincar\u00e9 read out R\u00f6ntgen's preprint paper. Becquerel \"began looking for a connection between the phosphorescence he had already been investigating and the newly discovered x-rays\" of R\u00f6ntgen, and thought that phosphorescent materials might emit penetrating X-ray-like radiation when illuminated by bright sunlight; he had various phosphorescent materials including some uranium salts for his experiments.\nThroughout the first weeks of February, Becquerel layered photographic plates with coins or other objects then wrapped this in thick black paper, placed phosphorescent materials on top, placed these in bright sun light for several hours. The developed plate showed shadows of the objects. Already on 24 February he reported his first results. However, the 26 and 27 February were dark and overcast during the day, so Becquerel left his layered plates in a dark cabinet for these days. He nevertheless proceeded to develop the plates on 1 March and then made his astonishing discovery: the object shadows were just as distinct when left in the dark as when exposed to sunlight. Both William Crookes and Becquerel's 18-year-old son, Jean, witnessed the discovery.\nBy May 1896, after other experiments involving non-phosphorescent uranium salts, Becquerel arrived at the correct explanation, namely that the penetrating radiation came from the uranium itself, without any need for excitation by an external energy source. There followed a period of intense research into radioactivity, including the determination that the element thorium is also radioactive and the discovery of additional radioactive elements polonium and radium by Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie and her husband Pierre Curie. The intensive research of radioactivity led to Becquerel publishing seven papers on the subject in 1896. Becquerel's other experiments allowed him to research more into radioactivity and figure out different aspects of the magnetic field when radiation is introduced into the magnetic field. \"When different radioactive substances were put in the magnetic field, they deflected in different directions or not at all, showing that there were three classes of radioactivity: negative, positive, and electrically neutral.\"\nAs simultaneity often happens in science, radioactivity came close to being discovered nearly four decades earlier in 1857, when Abel Ni\u00e9pce de Saint-Victor, who was investigating photography under Michel Eug\u00e8ne Chevreul, observed that uranium salts emitted radiation that could darken photographic emulsions. By 1861, Niepce de Saint-Victor realized that uranium salts produce \"a radiation that is invisible to our eyes\". Niepce de Saint-Victor knew Edmond Becquerel, Henri Becquerel's father. In 1868, Edmond Becquerel published a book, \"La lumi\u00e8re: ses causes et ses effets\" (Light: Its causes and its effects). On page 50 of volume 2, Edmond noted that Niepce de Saint-Victor had observed that some objects that had been exposed to sunlight could expose photographic plates even in the dark. Niepce further noted that on the one hand, the effect was diminished if an obstruction were placed between a photographic plate and the object that had been exposed to the sun, but \" \u2026 \"d'un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, l'augmentation d'effet quand la surface insol\u00e9e est couverte de substances facilement alt\u00e9rables \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re, comme le nitrate d'urane\" \u2026 \" ( ... on the other hand, the increase in the effect when the surface exposed to the sun is covered with substances that are easily altered by light, such as uranium nitrate ... ).\nExperiments.\nDescribing them to the French Academy of Sciences on 27 February 1896, he said:\nOne wraps a Lumi\u00e8re photographic plate with a bromide emulsion in two sheets of very thick black paper, such that the plate does not become clouded upon being exposed to the sun for a day. One places on the sheet of paper, on the outside, a slab of the phosphorescent substance, and one exposes the whole to the sun for several hours. When one then develops the photographic plate, one recognizes that the silhouette of the phosphorescent substance appears in black on the negative. If one places between the phosphorescent substance and the paper a piece of money or a metal screen pierced with a cut-out design, one sees the image of these objects appear on the negative\u00a0... One must conclude from these experiments that the phosphorescent substance in question emits rays which pass through the opaque paper and reduce silver salts.\nBut further experiments led him to doubt and then abandon this hypothesis. On 2 March 1896 he reported:\nI will insist particularly upon the following fact, which seems to me quite important and beyond the phenomena which one could expect to observe: The same crystalline crusts [of potassium uranyl sulfate], arranged the same way with respect to the photographic plates, in the same conditions and through the same screens, but sheltered from the excitation of incident rays and kept in darkness, still produce the same photographic images. Here is how I was led to make this observation: among the preceding experiments, some had been prepared on Wednesday the 26th and Thursday the 27th of February, and since the sun was out only intermittently on these days, I kept the apparatuses prepared and returned the cases to the darkness of a bureau drawer, leaving in place the crusts of the uranium salt. Since the sun did not come out in the following days, I developed the photographic plates on the 1st of March, expecting to find the images very weak. Instead the silhouettes appeared with great intensity ... One hypothesis which presents itself to the mind naturally enough would be to suppose that these rays, whose effects have a great similarity to the effects produced by the rays studied by M. Lenard and M. R\u00f6ntgen, are invisible rays emitted by phosphorescence and persisting infinitely longer than the duration of the luminous rays emitted by these bodies. However, the present experiments, without being contrary to this hypothesis, do not warrant this conclusion. I hope that the experiments which I am pursuing at the moment will be able to bring some clarification to this new class of phenomena.\nLater life and death.\nIn 1900, Becquerel measured the properties of beta particles, and he realized that they had the same measurements as high speed electrons leaving the nucleus. The following year, he discovered that radioactivity could be used for medicine; he left a piece of radium in his vest pocket, and noticed that he had been burnt by it. This discovery led to the development of radiotherapy, which is now used to treat cancer.\nBecquerel died on 25 August 1908 in Le Croisic at the age of 55. He died of a heart attack, but it was reported that \"he had developed serious burns on his skin, likely from the handling of radioactive materials.\"\nCommemorations.\nThe SI unit of radioactivity is named after Becquerel. A crater on the Moon, as well as a crater on Mars, are named after him. Becquerelite, a uranium mineral, is named after him. Minor planet 6914 Becquerel is named in his honour.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "53712", "revid": "6010417", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53712", "title": "Digital audio", "text": "Technology that records, stores, and reproduces sound\nDigital audio is a representation of sound recorded in, or converted into, digital form. In digital audio, the sound wave of the audio signal is typically encoded as numerical samples in a continuous sequence. For example, in CD audio, samples are taken 44,100 times per second, each with 16-bit resolution. Digital audio is also the name for the entire technology of sound recording and reproduction using audio signals that have been encoded in digital form. Following significant advances in digital audio technology during the 1970s and 1980s, it gradually replaced analog audio technology in many areas of audio engineering, record production and telecommunications in the 1990s and 2000s.\nIn a digital audio system, an analog electrical signal representing the sound is converted with an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) into a digital signal, typically using pulse-code modulation (PCM). This digital signal can then be recorded, edited, modified, and copied using computers, audio playback machines, and other digital tools. For playback, a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) performs the reverse process, converting a digital signal back into an analog signal, which is then sent through an audio power amplifier and ultimately to a loudspeaker.\nDigital audio systems may include compression, storage, processing, and transmission components. Conversion to a digital format allows convenient manipulation, storage, transmission, and retrieval of an audio signal. Unlike analog audio, in which making copies of a recording results in generation loss and degradation of signal quality, digital audio allows an infinite number of copies to be made without any degradation of signal quality.\nOverview.\nDigital audio technologies are used in the recording, manipulation, mass-production, and distribution of sound, including recordings of songs, instrumental pieces, podcasts, sound effects, and other sounds. Modern online music distribution depends on digital recording and data compression. The availability of music as data files, rather than as physical objects, has significantly reduced the costs of distribution as well as making it easier to share copies. Before digital audio, the music industry distributed and sold music by selling physical copies in the form of records and cassette tapes. With digital audio and online distribution systems such as iTunes, companies sell digital sound files to consumers, which the consumer receives over the Internet. Popular streaming services such as Apple Music, Spotify, or YouTube, offer temporary access to the digital file, and are now the most common form of music consumption.\nAn analog audio system converts physical waveforms of sound into electrical representations of those waveforms by use of a transducer, such as a microphone. The sounds are then stored on an analog medium such as magnetic tape, or transmitted through an analog medium such as a telephone line or radio. The process is reversed for reproduction: the electrical audio signal is amplified and then converted back into physical waveforms via a loudspeaker. Analog audio retains its fundamental wave-like characteristics throughout its storage, transformation, duplication, and amplification.\nAnalog audio signals are susceptible to noise and distortion, due to the innate characteristics of electronic circuits and associated devices. Disturbances in a digital system do not result in error unless they are so large as to result in a symbol being misinterpreted as another symbol or disturbing the sequence of symbols. It is, therefore, generally possible to have an entirely error-free digital audio system in which no noise or distortion is introduced between conversion to digital format and conversion back to analog.\nA digital audio signal may be encoded for correction of any errors that might occur in the storage or transmission of the signal. This technique, known as channel coding, is essential for broadcast or recorded digital systems to maintain bit accuracy. Eight-to-fourteen modulation is the channel code used for the audio compact disc (CD).\nConversion process.\nIf an audio signal is analog, a digital audio system starts with an ADC that converts an analog signal to a digital signal. The ADC runs at a specified sampling rate and converts at a known bit resolution. CD audio, for example, has a sampling rate of 44.1\u00a0kHz (44,100\u00a0samples per second), and has 16-bit resolution for each stereo channel. Analog signals that have not already been bandlimited must be passed through an anti-aliasing filter before conversion, to prevent the aliasing distortion that is caused by audio signals with frequencies higher than the Nyquist frequency (half the sampling rate).\nA digital audio signal may be stored or transmitted. Digital audio can be stored on a CD, a digital audio player, a hard drive, a USB flash drive, or any other digital data storage device. The digital signal may be altered through digital signal processing, where it may be filtered or have effects applied. Sample-rate conversion, including upsampling and downsampling, may be used to change signals that have been encoded with a different sampling rate to a common sampling rate prior to processing. Audio data compression techniques, such as MP3, Advanced Audio Coding (AAC), Opus, Ogg Vorbis, or FLAC, are commonly employed to reduce the file size. Digital audio can be carried over digital audio interfaces such as AES3 or MADI. Digital audio can be carried over a network using audio over Ethernet, audio over IP or other streaming media standards and systems.\nFor playback, digital audio must be converted back to an analog signal with a DAC. According to the Nyquist\u2013Shannon sampling theorem, with some practical and theoretical restrictions, a band-limited version of the original analog signal can be accurately reconstructed from the digital signal.\nDuring conversion, audio data can be embedded with a digital watermark to prevent piracy and unauthorized use. Watermarking is done using a direct-sequence spread-spectrum (DSSS) method. The audio information is then modulated by a pseudo-noise (PN) sequence, then shaped within the frequency domain and put back in the original signal. The strength of the embedding determines the strength of the watermark on the audio data.\nHistory.\nCoding.\nPulse-code modulation (PCM) was invented by British scientist Alec Reeves in 1937. In 1950, C. Chapin Cutler of Bell Labs filed the patent on differential pulse-code modulation (DPCM), a data compression algorithm. Adaptive DPCM (ADPCM) was introduced by P. Cummiskey, Nikil S. Jayant and James L. Flanagan at Bell Labs in 1973.\nPerceptual coding was first used for speech coding compression, with linear predictive coding (LPC). Initial concepts for LPC date back to the work of Fumitada Itakura (Nagoya University) and Shuzo Saito (Nippon Telegraph and Telephone) in 1966. During the 1970s, Bishnu S. Atal and Manfred R. Schroeder at Bell Labs developed a form of LPC called adaptive predictive coding (APC), a perceptual coding algorithm that exploited the masking properties of the human ear, followed in the early 1980s with the code-excited linear prediction (CELP) algorithm.\nDiscrete cosine transform (DCT) coding, a lossy compression method first proposed by Nasir Ahmed in 1972, provided the basis for the modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT), which was developed by J. P. Princen, A. W. Johnson and A. B. Bradley in 1987. The MDCT is the basis for most audio coding standards, such as Dolby Digital (AC-3), MP3 (MPEG Layer III), AAC, Windows Media Audio (WMA), Opus and Vorbis (Ogg).\nRecording.\nPCM was used in telecommunications applications long before its first use in commercial broadcast and recording. Commercial digital recording was pioneered in Japan by NHK and Nippon Columbia and their Denon brand, in the 1960s. The first commercial digital recordings were released in 1971.\nThe BBC also began to experiment with digital audio in the 1960s. By the early 1970s, it had developed a 2-channel recorder, and in 1972 it deployed a digital audio transmission system that linked their broadcast center to their remote transmitters.\nThe first 16-bit PCM recording in the United States was made by Thomas Stockham at the Santa Fe Opera in 1976, on a Soundstream recorder. An improved version of the Soundstream system was used to produce several classical recordings by Telarc in 1978. The 3M digital multitrack recorder in development at the time was based on BBC technology. The first all-digital album recorded on this machine was Ry Cooder's \"Bop till You Drop\" in 1979. British record label Decca began development of its own 2-track digital audio recorders in 1978 and released the first European digital recording in 1979.\nPopular professional digital multitrack recorders produced by Sony/Studer (DASH) and Mitsubishi (ProDigi) in the early 1980s helped to bring about digital recording's acceptance by the major record companies. Machines for these formats had their own transports built-in as well, using reel-to-reel tape in either 1/4\", 1/2\", or 1\" widths, with the audio data being recorded to the tape using a multi-track stationary tape head. PCM adaptors allowed for stereo digital audio recording on a conventional NTSC or PAL video tape recorder.\nThe 1982 introduction of the CD by Philips and Sony popularized digital audio with consumers.\nADAT became available in the early 1990s, which allowed eight-track 44.1 or 48\u00a0kHz recording on S-VHS cassettes, and DTRS performed a similar function with Hi8 tapes.\nFormats like ProDigi and DASH were referred to as SDAT (stationary-head digital audio tape) formats, as opposed to formats like the PCM adaptor-based systems and Digital Audio Tape (DAT), which were referred to as RDAT (rotating-head digital audio tape) formats, due to their helical-scan process of recording.\nLike the DAT cassette, ProDigi and DASH machines also accommodated the obligatory 44.1\u00a0kHz sampling rate, but also 48\u00a0kHz on all machines, and eventually a 96\u00a0kHz sampling rate. They overcame the problems that made typical analog recorders unable to meet the bandwidth (frequency range) demands of digital recording by a combination of higher tape speeds, narrower head gaps used in combination with metal-formulation tapes, and the spreading of data across multiple parallel tracks.\nUnlike analog systems, modern digital audio workstations and audio interfaces allow as many channels in as many different sampling rates as the computer can effectively run at a single time. Avid Audio and Steinberg released the first digital audio workstation software programs in 1989. Digital audio workstations make multitrack recording and mixing much easier for large projects, which would otherwise be difficult with analog equipment.\nTelephony.\nThe rapid development and wide adoption of PCM digital telephony was enabled by metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor (MOS) switched capacitor (SC) circuit technology, developed in the early 1970s. This led to the development of PCM codec-filter chips in the late 1970s. The silicon-gate CMOS (complementary MOS) PCM codec-filter chip, developed by David A. Hodges and W.C. Black in 1980, has since been the industry standard for digital telephony. By the 1990s, telecommunication networks such as the public switched telephone network (PSTN) had been largely digitized with VLSI (very large-scale integration) CMOS PCM codec-filters, widely used in electronic switching systems for telephone exchanges, user-end modems and a range of digital transmission applications such as the integrated services digital network (ISDN), cordless telephones and cell phones.\nTechnologies.\nDigital audio is used in broadcasting of audio. Standard technologies include Digital audio broadcasting (DAB), Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM), HD Radio and In-band on-channel (IBOC).\nDigital audio in recording applications is stored on audio-specific technologies including CD, DAT, Digital Compact Cassette (DCC) and MiniDisc. Digital audio may be stored in a standard audio file formats and stored on a Hard disk recorder, Blu-ray or DVD-Audio. Files may be played back on smartphones, computers or MP3 player. Digital audio resolution is measured in audio bit depth. Most digital audio formats use either 16-bit, 24-bit, and 32-bit resolution.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "53713", "revid": "2130701", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53713", "title": "De Beers", "text": "International corporation specialising in diamonds\nThe De Beers Group is a South African\u2013British corporation that specialises in the diamond industry, including mining, exploration, retail, inscription, grading, trading and industrial diamond manufacturing. The company is active in open-pit, underground, large-scale alluvial and coastal mining. It operates in 35 countries, with mining taking place in Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, and Canada. It also has an artisanal mining business, Gemfair, which operates in Sierra Leone.\nFrom its inception in 1888 until the start of the 21st century, De Beers controlled 80% to 85% of rough diamond distribution and was considered a monopoly. By 2000, the company's control of the world diamond supply decreased to 63%.\nThe company was founded in 1888 by British businessman Cecil Rhodes, who was financed by the South African diamond magnate Alfred Beit and the London-based N M Rothschild &amp; Sons bank. In 1926, Ernest Oppenheimer, a German immigrant to Britain and later South Africa who had earlier founded mining company Anglo American with American financier J. P. Morgan, was elected to the board of De Beers. He built and consolidated the company's global monopoly over the diamond industry until he died in 1957. During this time, he was involved in several controversies, including price fixing and trust behaviour, and was accused of not releasing industrial diamonds for the US war effort during World War II.\nIn 2011, Anglo American took control of De Beers after buying the Oppenheimers' family stake of 40% for US$5.1 billion (\u00a33.2 billion) and increasing its stake to 85%, ending the 80-year Oppenheimer control of the company. The company is currently owned 85% by Anglo American and 15% by the Government of Botswana.\nIn May 2024, Anglo American announced its intention to spin off or sell De Beers.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistory.\nFoundation.\nThe name 'De Beers' was derived from two Afrikaner settlers: brothers Diederik Arnoldus de Beer (1825\u20131878) and Johannes Nicolaas de Beer (1830\u20131883), who owned a farm named \"Vooruitzicht\" (Dutch for \"prospect\" or \"outlook\") near Zandfontein in the Boshof District of the Orange Free State. Diederik and Johannes were direct descendants of the VOC soldier and later farmer, Matthys Andries de Beer, of Vaasa, Finland, who had migrated to South Africa in 1699 via L\u00fcbeck. Following the discovery of diamonds on Diederik and Johannes's land, the increasing demands of the British government forced them to sell their farm on 31 July 1871 to merchant Alfred Johnson Ebden (1820\u20131908) for \u00a36,600. \"Vooruitzicht\" would become the site of the Big Hole and the De Beers mine, two successful diamond mines. Their name, which was given to one of the mines, subsequently became associated with the company.\nCecil Rhodes, the founder of the British South Africa Company, got his start by renting water pumps to miners during the diamond rush that started in 1869, when an 83.5 carat diamond called the 'Star of South Africa' was found at Hopetown near the Orange River in South Africa. He invested the profits of this operation into buying up claims of small mining operators, with his operations soon expanding into a separate mining company. He soon secured funding from the Rothschild family, who financed his business expansion. De Beers Consolidated Mines was formed in 1888 by the merger of the companies of Barney Barnato and Cecil Rhodes. By this time, the company was the sole owner of all diamond mining operations in South Africa. In 1889, Rhodes negotiated a strategic agreement with the London-based Diamond Syndicate, which agreed to purchase a fixed quantity of diamonds at an agreed price, thereby regulating output and maintaining prices. The agreement soon proved to be very successful \u2013 for example, during the trade slump of 1891\u20131892, supply was curtailed to maintain the price. Rhodes was concerned about the break-up of the new monopoly, stating to shareholders in 1896 that the company's \"only risk is the sudden discovery of new mines, which human nature will work recklessly to the detriment of us all\".\nThe Second Boer War proved to be a challenging time for the company. Kimberley was besieged as soon as war broke out, thereby threatening the company's valuable mines. Rhodes personally moved into the city at the onset of the siege to put political pressure on the British government to divert military resources towards relieving the siege rather than more strategic war objectives. Despite being at odds with the military, Rhodes placed the full resources of the company at the disposal of the defenders, manufacturing shells, defences, an armoured train and a gun named \"Long Cecil\" in the company workshops.\nOppenheimer control.\nIn 1898, diamonds were discovered on farms near Pretoria, Transvaal. One led to the discovery of the Premier Mine. The Premier Mine was registered in 1902 and the Cullinan Diamond, the largest rough diamond ever discovered, was found there in 1905. (The Premier Mine was renamed the Cullinan Mine in 2003.) Its owner refused to join the De Beers cartel. Instead, the mine started selling to a pair of independent dealers named Bernard and Ernest Oppenheimer, thereby weakening the De Beers stranglehold.\nFrancis Oats, who became Chairman of De Beers in 1908, was dismissive of the threats from the Premier Mine and the finds in German South West Africa.\nHowever, production soon equalled all of the De Beers mines combined. Ernest Oppenheimer was appointed the local agent for the powerful London Syndicate, rising to the position of mayor of Kimberley within 10\u00a0years. He understood the core principle that underpinned De Beers's success, stating in 1910 that \"common sense tells us that the only way to increase the value of diamonds is to make them scarce, that is to reduce production\".\nDuring World War I, the Premier Mine was finally absorbed into De Beers. When Rhodes died in 1902, De Beers controlled 90% of the world's diamond production. Ernest Oppenheimer took over the chairmanship of the company in 1929, after buying shares and being appointed to the board in 1926. Oppenheimer was very concerned about the discovery of diamonds in 1908 in German South West Africa, fearing that the increased supply would swamp the market and force prices down. Former CIA chief Admiral Stansfield Turner claimed that De Beers restricted US access to industrial diamonds needed for the country's war effort during World War II.\nDuring the early 1930s, the company conducted experimental work which in large part pioneered the use of diamond drills. This was highly preferable to more expensive and rarer carbons previously in use. The Free State Gold Rush was made possible in part due to this innovation, as the fields required deep drilling to reach gold-bearing reefs.\nIn May 1955, Ernest Oppenheimer opened a new headquarters which combined the operations of Anglo American and the De Beers group. After Ernest died in November 1957, operation of Anglo and De Beers was passed on to his son, Harry Oppenheimer. Under Harry, the company expanded to several different countries, including Canada, Australia, Malaysia, Portugal, Zambia, and Tanzania. In South Africa, Harry opposed apartheid, arguing that it hindered economic growth. Despite this, De Beers has been criticized for profiting from the system during the apartheid period. By 1973, Anglo and De Beers accounted for 10 percent of South Africa's gross national product and 30 percent of the country's exports.\nThroughout the 1960s and 1970s, De Beers attempted to secretly enter the United States' diamond market, being forced to divest its American assets in 1975 to avoid the risk of violating anti-trust laws. Harry Oppenheimer stepped down as the chairman and director of Anglo-American and De Beers in December 1982.\n21st-century changes.\nDuring the 20th century, De Beers used several methods to leverage its dominant position to influence the international diamond market. First, it attempted to convince independent producers to join its single channel monopoly. When that did not work, it flooded the market with diamonds similar to those of producers who refused to join in, depressing their price and undermining return for the resistant. It also purchased and stockpiled diamonds produced by other manufacturers as well as surplus diamonds in order to control prices by limiting supply. Finally, it bought diamonds when prices fell considerably naturally, to constrict supply and drive their value back up, such as during the Great Depression.\nIn 2000, the De Beers business model changed because of factors such as the decision by producers in Canada and Australia to distribute diamonds outside the De Beers channel, as well as increasingly negative publicity surrounding blood diamonds, which forced De Beers to protect its image by limiting sales to its own mined products.\nThe combination of a more fragmented and thus more competitive diamond market, increased transparency, and greater liquidity, caused De Beers's market share of rough diamonds to fall from as high as 90% in the 1980s to 29.5% in 2019.\nSeeing these developing trends, the Oppenheimer family announced in November 2011 its intention to sell its entire 40% stake in De Beers to Anglo American plc, thereby increasing Anglo American's ownership of the company to 85% (with the remaining 15% owned by the Government of the Republic of Botswana).\nThe transaction was worth \u00a33.2 billion (US$5.1 billion) in cash and ended the Oppenheimer dynasty's 80-year ownership of De Beers.\nIn 2020, the De Beers Company released a statement of a values change, promising the world that it is committed to not using slave labor within the company.\nIn 2025, De Beers reported holding an inventory of unsold mined diamonds valued at approximately US$2 billion. The company attributed this to a decline in demand for natural diamonds, driven in part by the growing popularity of lab-grown diamonds, which have become significantly more affordable. By 2025, lab-grown diamonds were reported to be approximately 90% less expensive than their mined counterparts, compared to a 10% price difference in 2018.\nMarketing.\nDe Beers successfully advertised diamonds to manipulate consumer demand. One of the most effective marketing strategies has been the marketing of diamonds as a symbol of love and commitment. Copywriter Frances Gerety (1916\u20131999) working for N. W. Ayer &amp; Son coined the famous advertising slogan, 'A Diamond is Forever', in 1947. In 2000, \"Advertising Age\" magazine named 'A Diamond is Forever' the best advertising slogan of the 20th century. The slogan likely inspired the James Bond book, film and song title \"Diamonds Are Forever\".\nOther successful campaigns include the 'eternity ring' (meant as a symbol of continuing affection and appreciation), the 'trilogy ring' (meant to represent the past, present, and future of a relationship) and the 'right hand ring' (meant to be bought and worn by women as a symbol of independence).\nDe Beers ran television advertisements featuring silhouettes of people wearing diamonds, set to the music of \"Palladio\" by Karl Jenkins. The campaign, titled \"Shadows and Lights\", first ran in the first quarter of 1993. The song would later inspire a compilation album, \"Diamond Music\", released in 1996, which features the \"Palladio\" suite. A 2010 commercial for Verizon Wireless parodied the De Beers spots.\nIn May 2018, De Beers introduced a new brand of jewellery called \"Lightbox\" made with synthetic diamonds. The synthetic stones start at $200 for a quarter-carat to $800 for a full-carat diamond. The new lab-grown diamonds retail for about one-tenth the cost of naturally occurring diamonds. The new brand began selling in September 2018, and the stones are produced in Gresham, Oregon, a $94 million facility using the region's cheap electricity, which opened in 2018 with a capacity for 500,000 rough carats of diamonds per year.\nIn May 2025, De Beers announced the discontinuation of the Lightbox brand, citing challenges in competing with the increasingly low prices of lab-grown diamonds and shifting market dynamics.\nOperations.\nMining in Botswana takes place through the mining company Debswana, a 50\u201350 joint venture with the Government of the Republic of Botswana. It operates four mines \u2013 Jwaneng, Orapa, Letlhakane and Damtshaa, though Damtshaa was put on care and maintenance in 2015.\nIn Namibia, mining is carried out through Namdeb Holdings, a 50\u201350 joint venture with the Government of the Republic of Namibia. Namdeb Holdings is made up of Debmarine Namibia (covering offshore mining) and Namdeb Diamond Corporation (land-based coastal mining). For offshore mining, motor vessels are used, including the 12,000-tonne, 113-metre-long SS Nujoma, built at a cost of $157 million and named after Sam Nujoma, Namibia's founding president. This vessel, the world's most advanced diamond exploration and sampling vessel, began full operations in June 2017. The \"Benguela Gem\" began operation in 2022. At 177 meters it's the world's largest diamond vessel and cost De Beers $486 million to build.\nDe Beers Consolidated Mines is responsible for the De Beers mining in South Africa. It is 74% owned by De Beers and 26% by a board-based black economic empowerment partner, Ponahalo Investments. There are two mines \u2013 Venetia and Voorspoed.\nIn 2008, De Beers began production at the Snap Lake mine in the Northwest Territories, Canada; this was the first De Beers mine outside Africa and was Canada's first completely underground diamond mine. Production was suspended when the mine was put on care and maintenance in 2015. De Beers opened the Victor mine in Ontario, Canada, the same year, a day after Snap Lake. This was followed by the opening of the company's third mine in Canada, Gahcho Kue, in September 2016.\nTrading of rough diamonds takes place through two channels \u2013 De Beers Global Sightholder Sales (GSS) and De Beers Auction Sales. GSS sells about 90% of De Beers's rough diamonds, by value, and features wholly owned and joint venture operations in South Africa (De Beers Sightholder Sales South Africa), Botswana (DTCB), and Namibia (NDTC). They sort, value and sell 33% (2013) of the world's rough diamonds by value.\nThere are two main types of customers for rough diamonds \u2013 Sightholders and Accredited Buyers. Sightholders have a term contract. Accredited Buyer status, introduced in 2015, allows companies that are not traditional Sightholders to access diamonds that were not allocated to existing Sightholders. De Beers also sells about 10% of its rough diamonds through online auction sales. The company pioneered the approach in 2008 when it broke with 44 years of direct sales to hold the diamond industry's first online international auction sale. It is now the world's leader in this kind of auction sale.\nDe Beers employs more than 30,000 people on five continents, with more than 17,000 employees in Africa. Almost 8,000 people are employed in Botswana, around 6,200 in South Africa, nearly 2,900 in Namibia, some 1,260 in Canada and about 320 in exploration.\nIn February 2020, De Beers reported its worst set of earnings since the company was bought by miner Anglo American in 2012.\nBusiness structure and brands.\nOn 4 November 2011, Anglo American plc and CHL Holdings announced their agreement for Anglo American to acquire an incremental interest in De Beers, increasing Anglo American's 45% shareholding in the world's leading diamond company to 85%. De Beers plc was originally incorporated as De Beers Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme in 2000 in Luxembourg. Following the closure of this office, the company was reclassified as De Beers plc in 2017, with its head office now in Jersey. It is made up of two shareholdings: Anglo American plc has an 85% shareholding and the Government of the Republic of Botswana owns 15% directly. De Beers plc is the holding company of The De Beers Group of Companies. It is involved in many parts of the diamond value chain, from mining to sales, and is made up of a series of joint ventures and wholly owned operations.\nThe joint ventures are:\nThe wholly owned operations are in southern Africa and Canada. Also wholly owned are Forevermark, De Beers Jewellers, the International Institute of Diamond Valuation, De Beers Ventures, the International Institute of Diamond Grading &amp; Research and Element Six (Umicore has a 40% stake in Element Six's abrasives division).\nForevermark.\nForevermark was launched in 2008 as one of the two diamond brands from The De Beers Group of Companies. According to the company website, \"Each Forevermark diamond is inscribed with a promise: that it is beautiful, rare and responsibly sourced.\" Forevermark diamonds are inscribed with an icon and unique identification number, albeit invisibly to the naked eye: the Forevermark inscription is &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u204420th of a micron deep. This inscription helps distinguish Forevermark diamonds from other natural diamonds though, similarly to when distinguishing natural diamonds from synthetic diamonds, it requires specialist detection equipment to view. The inscription also helps maintain scarcity: the Forevermark website boasts that only a tiny percentage of diamonds qualify for the Forevermark brand.\nDe Beers London.\nDe Beers Diamond Jewellers (DBDJ) was established in 2001 as a 50:50 joint venture between The De Beers Group of Companies and LVMH, the French luxury goods company. The first De Beers boutique opened in 2002 on London's Old Bond Street as the brand's flagship store. Since then, stores have opened in various cities around the world. In March 2017, The De Beers Group of Companies acquired LVMH's 50% shareholding in DBDJ and new name De Beers Jewellers was unveiled.\nIn 2025, De Beers Jewellers was rebranded as De Beers London.\nInstitute of Diamonds\nThe International Institute of Diamond Grading &amp; Research (IIDGR) was set up by De Beers in 2008, with the aim of providing a range of services and equipment in the field of diamond verification. It is based in London, Antwerp and, from 2015, in Surat, India. The IIDGR works only on diamonds that meet the requirements of the United Nations' World Diamond Council Kimberley Process.\nORIGIN - De Beers Group.\nOrigin - De Beers Group is the group's branded polished diamond offering available at participating non-De Beers branded retailers.\nBlood diamonds and the Kimberley Process.\nIn 1999, a campaign by Global Witness to highlight the role of diamonds in international conflicts led to a review by the United Nations. The initial focus of the UN's investigation was on Jonas Savimbi's UNITA movement in Angola, which was found to have bartered uncut diamonds for weaponry despite international economic and diplomatic sanctions being in effect through United Nations Security Council Resolution 1173.\nIn 1999, De Beers Group stopped all outside buying of diamonds in order to guarantee the conflict-free status of their diamonds effective from 26 March 2000.\nIn December 2000, following the recommendations of the Fowler Report, the UN adopted the landmark General Assembly Resolution A/RES/55/56 supporting the creation of an international certification scheme for rough diamonds. By November 2002, negotiations between governments, the international diamond industry, led by De Beers, and civil society organisations resulted in the creation of the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (KPCS), which sets out the requirements for controlling rough diamond production and trade and became effective in 2003.\nDe Beers states that 100% of the diamonds it now sells are conflict-free and that all De Beers diamonds are purchased in compliance with national law, the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme and its own Diamond Best Practice Principles. The Kimberley process has helped restore the reputation of the industry, as well as eliminating sources of excess supply.\nIn 2018, De Beers used blockchain technology to successfully track 100 high-value diamonds. The diamonds were tracked through the manufacturing process from the mine to the retailer in order to ensure their quality and conflict-free status.\nIn 2019, they launched their own end-to-end traceability platform called Tracr to enable all diamonds to be identified and traced as they move from the mine to the store. Signet and the Russian-based Alrosa are using the technology.\nCorporate affairs.\nIn August 2017, De Beers partnered with the Stanford Graduate School of Business to accelerate business ventures to market in Botswana, Namibia, and South Africa. As part of two programs, the partnership is set to help teach early entrepreneurs how to commercialize their business ideas. The partnership is a three-year, $3 million deal.\nIn September 2017, De Beers partnered with UN Women to help the advancement of women within the company and the countries it operates in. In 2018, the two entities launched a program to support 500 women micro-entrepreneurs in Blouberg and Musina communities, near De Beers's Venetia diamond mine.\nIn May 2018, De Beers's group company Element Six launched a lab-grown diamond brand to sell jewellery directly to consumers.\nFormer operations.\nInternational Institute of Diamond Valuation\nThe International Institute of Diamond Valuation (IIDV) was launched by De Beers Group in March 2016. Operating in partnership with diamond jewellery retailers, it provided a reselling service for all diamonds, regardless of value. In April 2019, De Beers closed its IIDV division.\nDe Beers Ventures\nDe Beers Ventures was established by De Beers Group in June 2017 to consider minority stake investments in start-ups and growth companies that could be of benefit to De Beers Group or the broader diamond sector. It has since been dispanded.\nLegal issues.\nSherman Antitrust Act.\nDuring World War II, Ernest Oppenheimer attempted to negotiate a way around the Sherman Antitrust Act by proposing that De Beers register a US branch of the Diamond Syndicate Incorporated. In this way, his company could provide the US with the industrial diamonds it desperately sought for the war effort in return for immunity from prosecution after the war; however his proposal was rejected by the US Justice Department when it was discovered that De Beers had no intention of stockpiling any industrial diamonds in the US. In 1945, the Justice Department finally filed an antitrust case against De Beers, but the case was dismissed as the company had no presence on US soil.\nRelocation of Indigenous San people in Botswana.\nAs of 2024, De Beers owns and operates, solely or jointly, five diamond mines in Botswana. A long dispute has existed between the interests of De Beers and the San (Bushman) tribe. The San have been facing threats of forcible relocation since the 1980s, when the diamond resources were discovered. A campaign was fought in an attempt to bring an end to what the indigenous rights organisation, Survival International, considers to be a genocide of a tribe that has been living in those lands for tens of thousands of years. Several international fashion models, including Iman, Lily Cole and Erin O'Connor, who were previously involved with advertising for the company's diamonds, supported the campaign. De Beers sold one mine in Botswana to Gem Diamonds in 2007.\nIndustrial diamonds.\nIn 2004, De Beers pled guilty and paid a US$10\u00a0million fine to the United States Department of Justice to settle a 1994 charge that De Beers had colluded with General Electric to fix the price of industrial diamonds. In 2008, De Beers agreed to pay a US$295\u00a0million class-action settlement after accusations of price fixing. The company appealed against the decision but ended up paying the settlement in 2013.\nEuropean Commission.\nIn February 2006, De Beers entered into legally binding commitments with the European Commission to cease purchasing rough diamonds from Russian mining company Alrosa as of the end of 2008 in order to ensure competition between the two companies.\nSouth Africa's rough diamond trade.\nIn 2014, the Leverhulme Centre for the Study of Value, based at the University of Manchester, published a report authored by Sarah Bracking and Khadija Sharife, identifying over US$3.3 billion in price fixing within the South African rough diamond trade from 2004 to 2012, leading to an estimated deficit in tax paid of ZAR 1 billion per year. The report found significant evidence of profit shifting through volume and value manipulation. Sharife simultaneously published an article disclosing the political system that cultivated revenue leakage, including the donation of De Beers staff to the State Diamond Trader (SDT). The report, like the article, utilised aggregated data produced by the Kimberley Process (KP) certificates of import-exports, relying on figures listed by the diamond companies themselves, in which De Beers was the dominant player. The South African Department of Mineral Resources (DMR) disclosed that De Beers did not authorise them to publish figures involving values, sales, pricing and other data, preventing transparency of the industry.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It lies about north of the modern city of Taos, New Mexico. The pueblos are the oldest continuously inhabited communities in the United States. Taos Pueblo has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nTaos Pueblo is a Native American village in New Mexico and one of the oldest places in the United States that has been lived in continuously. The people of Taos Pueblo are known for their farming and adobe-style buildings. They have lived in the same homes for more than thirty generations. Even without horses or wheeled vehicles, they created large trade networks throughout the area. Their location and long-lasting buildings make Taos Pueblo an important example of Pueblo culture.\nTaos Pueblo is a member of the Eight Northern Pueblos. A tribal land of is attached to the pueblo, and about 4,500 people live in this area.\nSetting.\nThe pueblo was constructed in a setting backed by the Taos Mountains of the Sangre de Cristo Range. The settlement was built on either side of Rio Pueblo de Taos, also called Rio Pueblo and Red Willow Creek, a small stream that flows through the middle of the pueblo compound. Its headwaters come from Blue Lake, or Ba Whyea, in the nearby mountains.\nTaos Pueblo's most prominent architectural feature is a multi-storied residential complex of reddish-brown adobe, built on either side of the Rio Pueblo. The Pueblo's website states it was probably built between 1000 and 1450.\nThe pueblo was designated a National Historic Landmark on October 9, 1960. In 1992 it was designated as a UNESCO Heritage Site. As of 2010,[ [update]] about 150 people live in the historical pueblo full-time.\nName.\nTaos language.\nIn the Tanoan language of Taos (Northern Tiwa), the pueblo is referred to as \"the village\" in either \"t\u0259\u0302otho\" \"in the village\" (\"t\u0259\u0302o-\" \"village\" + \"-tho\" \"in\") or \"t\u0259\u0302obo\" \"to/toward the village\" (\"t\u0259\u0302o-\" \"village\" + \"-bo\" \"to, toward\"). The proper name of the pueblo is \"\u0209a\u0142oph\u00e1ym\u0173p\u2019\u020dh\u0259\u0301oth\u0259\u0300olbo\" \"at red willow canyon mouth\" (or \"\u0209a\u0142oph\u00e1ybo\" \"at the red willows\" for short). This name is more commonly used in ceremonial contexts and is less common in everyday speech.\nSpanish language.\nThe name \"Taos\" in English was borrowed from Spanish \"Taos\". Spanish \"Taos\" is probably a borrowing of Taos \"t\u0259\u0302o-\" \"village\" which was heard as \"tao\" to which the plural \"-s\" was added although in the modern language \"Taos\" is no longer a plural noun. It has been proposed that the Spanish \"Taos\" comes from \"tao,\" \"cross of the order of San Juan de los Caballeros\" (from Greek \"tau\"), but that is unlikely to be the case.\nHistory.\nPre-Columbian.\nIt is most likely that the Taos Indigenous people, along with other Pueblo Indigenous people, settled along the Rio Grande after migrating south from the Four Corners region. The dwellings of that region were inhabited by the Ancestral Puebloans. A long drought in the area in the late 13th century may have caused them to move to the Rio Grande, where the water supply was more dependable. However, their reason for migrating is still disputed and there is evidence that a violent struggle took place. Ultimately, archeological clues point to the idea that the Natives may have been forced to leave.\nThroughout its early years, Taos Pueblo was a central point of trade between the native populations along the Rio Grande and their Plains Tribes neighbors to the northeast. Taos Pueblo hosted a trade fair each fall after the agricultural harvest.\nPost-contact.\nSpanish conquistadors first arrived at Taos Pueblo in 1540; they were members of the Francisco V\u00e1squez de Coronado expedition, which stopped at many of New Mexico's pueblos in search of the rumored Seven Cities of Gold. Around 1620, Spanish Jesuits oversaw construction of the first Catholic Church in the pueblo, the mission of San Geronimo de Taos. Reports from the period indicate that the native people of Taos resisted the building of the church and forceful imposition of the Catholic religion. Throughout the 1600s, cultural tensions grew between the native populations of the Southwest and the increasing Spanish colonial presence. Taos Pueblo was no exception. By 1660, the native people killed the resident priest and destroyed the church. The Spanish replied brutally. Several years after it was rebuilt, the Pueblo Revolt of 1680 began. The Catholic church in Taos Pueblo still stands today.\nUS control and 1847 revolt.\nDuring the Mexican-American War, New Mexico came under United States control after the Battle of Santa Fe in August 1846. Charles Bent was appointed as the American territorial governor. Many of the Taos Pueblo people and Hispanos feared that the new American regime would dispossess them of their land, especially since Bent had been involved in land-grant speculation schemes under the Mexican regime. On January 19, 1847, Hispanos and Taos Pueblo people launched a rebellion against the US territorial government. Tom\u00e1s Romero led a group of Taos Puebloans to Charles Bent's house in the town of Taos. The governor was shot with arrows, scalped, and killed.\nFollowing the death of Bent and several other Americans, Col. Sterling Price, commander of the US forces based in Santa Fe, led an expedition against the insurgents, defeating them at the Battle of Ca\u00f1ada on January 24. The rebels retreated inside Taos Pueblo, and Price bombarded the town and the church where the defenders were sheltering with artillery on February 3. The next day, a hole was broken in the wall of the church to fire shells and grapeshot at those seeking refuge within. More than 150 people were killed during the attack. Tom\u00e1s Romero was summarily executed after US forces captured Taos Pueblo, and other leaders of the revolt were later put on trial and executed by hanging. Further battles against US forces took place until July of that year.\nTaos Mountain.\nThe Pueblo's of mountain land was taken by President Theodore Roosevelt and designated as the Carson National Forest early in the 20th century. It was finally returned in 1970 by the United States when the Republican Richard Nixon signed Democratic senator Fred Harris' Public Law 91-550. An additional south of the ridge between Simpson Peak and Old Mike Peak and west of Blue Lake were transferred back to the Pueblo in 1996.\nBlue Lake.\nBlue Lake, which the people of the Pueblo consider sacred, was included in this return of Taos land. The Pueblo notably involved non-native people in lobbying the federal government for the return of Blue Lake, as they argued that their unrestricted access to the lake and the surrounding region was necessary to ensure their religious freedom. The Pueblo's web site names the reacquisition of the sacred Blue Lake as the most important event in its history due to the spiritual belief that the Taos people originated from the lake. It is believed that their ancestors live there, and the Pueblos themselves only ascend the mountain for ceremonial purposes.Blue Lake serves as a vital economic foundation for this farming community, providing the main water supply that supports their agricultural activities, including corn cultivation, fruit growing, bean production, and livestock ranching with cattle and sheep.\nArchitecture.\nAt the time of the Spaniards' initial contact, Hernando de Alvarado described the pueblo as having adobe houses built very close together and stacked five or six stories high. The homes became narrower as they rose, with the roofs of each level providing the floors and terraces for those above.\nThe buildings at Taos originally had few windows and no standard doorways. Instead, access to rooms was through square holes in the roof that the people reached by climbing long, wooden ladders. Engelmann Spruce logs (or \"vigas\") supported roofs that had layers of branches, grass, mud, and plaster covering them. The architecture and the building materials were well suited for the rigors of the environment and the needs of the people in the Taos Valley.\nThe first Spanish-influenced architecture appeared in Taos Pueblo after Fray Francisco de Zamora came there in 1598 to establish a mission, under orders from Spanish Governor, Don Juan de O\u00f1ate.\nMain structure.\nThe north-side Pueblo is said to be one of the most photographed and painted buildings in North America. It is the largest multistoried Pueblo structure still existing. It is made of adobe walls that are often several feet thick. Its primary purpose was for defense. Up to as late as 1900, access to the rooms on lower floors was by ladders on the outside to the roof, and then down an inside ladder. In case of an attack, outside ladders could easily be pulled up.\nHomes.\nThe homes in this structure usually consist of two rooms, one of which is for general living and sleeping, and the second of which is for cooking, eating, and storage. Each home is self-contained; there are no passageways between the houses. Taos Indians made little use of furniture in the past, but today they have tables, chairs, and beds. In the pueblo, electricity, running water, and indoor plumbing are prohibited.\nGovernment.\nTaos Pueblo\u2019s government is led by a cacique, who has both spiritual and political responsibilities. The war chief and his deputies report to the cacique and handle religious and enforcement duties. The positions of cacique and war chief are lifelong and are chosen by the Tribal Council, which is made up of former governors who serve as advisors. The cacique also manages a war captain and five assistants who serve for one year, working as both the community\u2019s police and event organizers. Each year, the cacique selects a Governor and several assistants to represent the Pueblo in outside matters. These roles are unpaid and considered a community service.\nToday, more young people and women in Taos Pueblo are taking part in tribal leadership and community activities. This marks a change from old traditions, which once limited these roles to men older than thirty.\nSpiritual community.\nReligious practices.\nReligious life in Taos Pueblo is not well documented because the community keeps its spiritual traditions private. Unlike many other Pueblo groups, Taos does not practice the Kachina religion or have medicine societies. The people of Taos Pueblo follow four main faiths: the traditional Kiva religion, the Peyote movement, Roman Catholicism, and a small Baptist group.\nTwo spiritual practices are represented in the Pueblo: the original indigenous spiritual and religious tradition and Roman Catholicism. The majority of Indigenous Taos continue to practice their ancient religion. Most (90%) members of the Taos Pueblo community are baptized as Roman Catholics. Saint Jerome, or San Geronimo, is the patron saint of the pueblo.\nCulture.\nTraditions involving the land.\nSince Spanish colonization, the native Taos people have resisted cultural change and influence with European ideas. Many ethnographers observe a high level of \"interconnectedness and mutual dependence\" between the Taos Pueblo and their surrounding land, where they derive many of their cultural traditions. Consequently, a historical rivalry exists between the people on the South side of the river (summer people) and the North side (winter people). Foot races, which have significant religious meaning in the tribe, are a common way for these two groups to express their rivalry, and there is a long held tradition in their tribe that was possibly created before the pyramids. In addition, the Taos Pueblo attribute great value to Blue Lake in regards to their \"living culture and agricultural sustainability.\"\nDeath traditions.\nAccording to Wood, the Taos Pueblo people never turn strangers away from their doors because they value both courtesy and hospitality. However, on All Souls' Day, the Taos Pueblo spend a day with their families and close their village to any non-Indian. The Taos Pueblo approach death with an air of \"stoicism,\" and they are only allowed to visit cemeteries on All Souls' Day or the day of someone's burial.\nGender.\nIn the cultural fabric of the Taos Pueblo, the ethnographic data suggests that women are considered to be subordinate to men. The Pueblo social structure is dictated by kiva memberships, and women are not allowed to take part in the rituals held in these sacred spaces because they \"are not trained\" to do so. Despite the exclusion of women from some spiritual activities, the women in the Taos Pueblo society \"exercised a considerable degree of influence economically, politically, and interpersonally.\" For example, single women can run their own households, and married women control their own finances because they traditionally work as cooks or maids. Additionally, women have informal decision making power, using their abilities to influence the men around them.\nHealth.\nTaos Pueblo, New Mexico, supports community health through several programs, such as its Public Health Nursing Department, a fitness program for seniors, and educational activities for children. The community also runs the Red Willow Cooperative, which acts as both a farmers market and a farm that grows organic food for local people. The cooperative gives jobs to high school students and teaches young people about sustainable farming and food production.\nConservation.\nIn 2011, the Taos Pueblo Preservation Program received a $800,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The fund aims to hire more workers, especially those who are trained in traditional construction techniques for conservation work, as well as workshop assistants who help pueblo homeowners with maintenance of traditional adobe homes. Supervisors teach trainees about traditional construction methods while rebuilding the majority of an 11-unit house which was in a state of near collapse.\nThe first phase of the conservation of Taos Pueblo is the construction of the training center, restoration of 120 to 150 houses, training of the local people in the community, creation of a detailed assessment of the structure of the compound, and establishment of a cultural center and tribal archives. The second phase was financed by the World Monument Fund. It is listed on its watchlist because of its endangered nature, both culturally and structurally. By the end of the conservation efforts, twenty-one adobe houses are expected to be restored. The previous fund has also covered the cost of a laser scanning of the structures.\nThe main characteristics of the conservation of Taos Pueblo aim to encourage a community-based approach. They include the training of local people to manage their own property, as well as the establishment of partnerships with government and non-government entities. The project resolves to preserve the traditional way of life in the community and sustain cultural traditions.\nIn August 2020, the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development announced a grant of $899,754 awarded to the Taos Pueblo Housing Authority to rehabilitate five housing units to help reduce the risk of transmitting COVID-19. The grant will also be used to provide rental, food, and utility assistance.\nVisual Arts and Pottery.\nTaos Pueblo is well known for its talented craftspeople and traditional art forms, such as silver and turquoise jewelry, heishi bead necklaces, and pottery. Heishi beads are usually made from carved seashells or soft stones. The pueblo\u2019s pottery is unique because it uses micaceous clay, which contains mica that gives the pots a shiny orange color when fired. These sturdy, simple ceramics are valued for both their beauty and practicality, as they can be used for cooking over open flames or in ovens.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The most popular tape format using a DV codec was MiniDV; these cassettes measured just , making it ideal for video cameras and rendering older analog formats obsolete. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, DV was strongly associated with the transition from analog to digital desktop video production, and also with several enduring \"prosumer\" camera designs such as the Sony VX-1000. \nIn 2003, DV was joined by a successor format called HDV, which used the same tapes but with an updated video codec with high-definition video; HDV cameras could typically switch between DV and HDV recording modes. In the 2010s, DV rapidly grew obsolete as cameras using memory cards and solid-state drives became the norm, recording at higher bitrates and resolutions that were impractical for mechanical tape formats. Additionally, as manufacturers switched from interlaced to superior progressive recording methods, they broke the interoperability that had previously been maintained across multiple generations of DV and HDV equipment.\nDevelopment.\nDV was developed by the HD Digital VCR Association: in April 1994, 55 companies worldwide took part, which developed the standards and specifications of the format.\nThe original DV specification, known as \"Blue Book\", was standardized within the IEC\u00a061834 family of standards. These standards define common features such as physical videocassettes, recording modulation method, magnetization, and basic system data in part 1. Part 2 describes the specifics of video systems supporting 525-60 for NTSC and 625-50 for PAL.\nCompression.\nDV uses lossy compression of video while audio is stored uncompressed. An intraframe video compression scheme is used to compress video on a frame-by-frame basis with the discrete cosine transform (DCT).\nClosely following the ITU-R Rec. 601 standard, DV employs interlaced scanning with the luminance sampling frequency of 13.5\u00a0MHz. This results in 480 scanlines per complete frame for the 60\u00a0Hz system, and 576 scanlines per complete frame for the 50\u00a0Hz system. In both systems the active area contains 720 pixels per scanline, with 704 pixels used for content and 16 pixels on the sides left for digital blanking. The same frame size is used for 4:3 and 16:9 frame aspect ratios, resulting in different pixel aspect ratios for \"fullscreen\" and \"widescreen\" video.\nPrior to the DCT compression stage, chroma subsampling is applied to the source video in order to reduce the amount of data to be compressed. Baseline DV uses in its 60\u00a0Hz variant and in the 50\u00a0Hz variant. Low chroma resolution of DV (compared to higher-end digital video formats) is a reason this format is sometimes avoided in chroma keying applications, though advances in chroma keying techniques and software have made producing quality keys from DV material possible.\nAudio can be stored in either of two forms: 16-bit Linear PCM stereo at 48\u00a0kHz sampling rate (768\u00a0kbit/s per channel, 1.5\u00a0Mbit/s stereo), or four nonlinear 12-bit PCM channels at 32\u00a0kHz sampling rate (384\u00a0kbit/s per channel, 1.5\u00a0Mbit/s for four channels). In addition, the DV specification also supports 16-bit audio at 44.1\u00a0kHz (706\u00a0kbit/s per channel, 1.4\u00a0Mbit/s stereo), the same sampling rate used for CD audio. In practice, the 48\u00a0kHz stereo mode is used almost exclusively.\nDigital Interface Format.\nThe audio, video, and metadata are packaged into 80-byte Digital Interface Format (DIF) blocks which are multiplexed into a 150-block sequence. DIF blocks are the basic units of DV streams and can be stored as computer files in raw form or wrapped in such file formats as Audio Video Interleave (AVI), QuickTime (QT) and Material Exchange Format (MXF). One video frame is formed from either 10 or 12 such sequences, depending on scanning rate, which results in a data rate of about 25\u00a0Mbit/s for video, and an additional 1.5\u00a0Mbit/s for audio. When written to tape, each sequence corresponds to one complete track.\nBaseline DV employs \"unlocked audio\". This means that the sound may be a third of a frame out of sync with the video, give or take. However, this is the maximum drift of the audio synchronization; it is not compounded throughout the recording.\nVariants.\nSony and Panasonic created their proprietary versions of DV aimed toward professional &amp; broadcast users, which use the same compression scheme, but improve on robustness, linear editing capabilities, color rendition and raster size.\nAll DV variants except for DVCPRO Progressive are recorded to tape within interlaced video stream. Film-like frame rates are possible by using pulldown. DVCPRO\u00a0HD supports native progressive format when recorded to P2 memory cards.\nDVCPRO.\nDVCPRO, also known as DVCPRO25 and D-7, is a variation of DV developed by Panasonic and introduced in 1995, originally intended for use in electronic news gathering (ENG) equipment.\nUnlike baseline DV, DVCPRO uses \"locked audio\", meaning the audio sample clock runs in sync with the video sample clock. Audio is available in 16-bit/48\u00a0kHz precision.\nWhen recorded to tape, DVCPRO uses wider track pitch\u201418 \u03bcm vs. 10 \u03bcm of baseline DV\u2014which reduces the chance of dropout errors during recording. Two extra longitudinal tracks provide support for audio cue and for timecode control. Tape is transported 80% faster compared to baseline DV, resulting in shorter recording time. Long Play mode is not available.\nDVCPRO50.\nDVCPRO50 was introduced by Panasonic in 1997 and is often described as two DV codecs working in parallel.\nThe DVCPRO50 doubles the coded video data rate to 50\u00a0Mbit/s. This has the effect of cutting total record time of any given storage medium in half. Chroma resolution is improved by using 4:2:2 chroma subsampling.\nFollowing the introduction of the AJ-SDX900 camcorder in 2003, DVCPRO50 was used in many productions where high definition video was not required. For example, BBC used DVCPRO50 to record high-budget TV series, such as \"Space Race\" (2005) and \"\" (2006).\nA similar format, D-9 (or Digital-S), offered by JVC, uses videocassettes with the same form-factor as VHS.\nComparable high quality standard definition digital tape formats include Sony's Digital Betacam, introduced in 1993, and MPEG\u00a0IMX, introduced in 2000.\nDVCPRO Progressive.\nDVCPRO Progressive was introduced by Panasonic alongside DVCPRO50. It offered 480 or 576 lines of progressive scan recording with 4:2:0 chroma subsampling and four 16-bit 48\u00a0kHz PCM audio channels. Like HDV-SD, it was meant as an intermediate format during the transition time from standard definition to high definition video.\nThe format offered six modes for recording and playback: 16:9 progressive (50\u00a0Mbit/s), 4:3 progressive (50\u00a0Mbit/s), 16:9 interlaced (50\u00a0Mbit/s), 4:3 interlaced (50\u00a0Mbit/s), 16:9 interlaced (25\u00a0Mbit/s), 4:3 interlaced (25\u00a0Mbit/s).\nThe format was superseded by DVCPRO\u00a0HD.\nDVCPRO HD.\nDVCPRO HD, also known as DVCPRO100 and D-12, is a high-definition video format that can be thought of as four DV codecs that work in parallel. Video data rate depends on frame rate and can be as low as 40\u00a0Mbit/s for 24 frame/s mode and as high as 100\u00a0Mbit/s for 50/60 frame/s modes. Like DVCPRO50, DVCPRO HD employs 4:2:2 color sampling. It was introduced in 2000.\nDVCPRO HD uses smaller raster size than broadcast high definition television: 960x720 pixels for 720p, 1280x1080 for 1080/59.94i and 1440x1080 for 1080/50i. Similar horizontal downsampling (using rectangular pixels) is used in many other magnetic tape-based HD formats such as HDCAM. To maintain compatibility with HD-SDI, DVCPRO100 equipment upsamples video during playback.\nVariable framerates (from 4 to 60 frame/s) are available on Varicam camcorders. DVCPRO HD equipment offers backward compatibility with older DV/DVCPRO formats.\nWhen recorded to tape in standard-play mode, DVCPRO\u00a0HD uses the same 18 \u03bcm track pitch as other DVCPRO flavors. A long play variant, DVCPRO\u00a0HD-LP, doubles the recording density by using 9 \u03bcm track pitch.\nDVCPRO\u00a0HD is codified as SMPTE 370M; the DVCPRO\u00a0HD tape format is SMPTE 371M, and the MXF Op-Atom format used for DVCPRO\u00a0HD on P2 cards is SMPTE 390M.\nWhile technically DVCPRO HD is a direct descendant of DV, it is used almost exclusively by professionals. Tape-based DVCPRO\u00a0HD cameras exist only in shoulder mount variant.\nA similar format, Digital-S (D-9 HD), was offered by JVC and used videocassettes with the same form-factor as VHS.\nThe main competitor to DVCPRO HD was HDCAM, offered by Sony. It uses a similar compression scheme but at higher bitrate.\nDVCAM.\nIn 1996, Sony responded with its own professional version of DV called DVCAM.\nLike DVCPRO, DVCAM uses locked audio, which prevents audio synchronization drift that may happen on DV if several generations of copies are made.\nWhen recorded to tape, DVCAM uses 15 \u03bcm track pitch, which is 50% wider compared to baseline. Accordingly, tape is transported 50% faster, which reduces recording time by one third compared to regular DV. Because of the wider track and track pitch, DVCAM has the ability to do a frame-accurate insert edit, while regular DV may vary by a few frames on each edit compared to the preview.\nDigital8.\nDigital8 is a combination of the tape transport originally designed for analog Video8 and Hi8 formats with the DV codec. Digital8 equipment records in DV format only, but usually can play back Video8 and Hi8 tapes as well.\nRecording media.\nMagnetic tape.\nThe table below show the physical DV cassette formats at a glance:\nDV was originally designed for recording onto magnetic tape. Tape is enclosed into videocassette of four different sizes: small, medium, large and extra-large. All DV cassettes use wide tape. DV on magnetic tape uses helical scan, which wraps the tape around a tilted, rotating head drum with video heads mounted to it. As the drum rotates, the heads read the tape diagonally. DV, DVCAM and DVCPRO use a 21.7\u00a0mm diameter head drum at 9000\u00a0rpm. The diagonal video tracks read by the heads are 10 microns wide in DV tapes.\nTechnically, any DV cassette can record any variant of DV. Nevertheless, manufacturers often label cassettes with DV, DVCAM, DVCPRO, DVCPRO50 or DVCPRO HD and indicate recording time with regards to the label posted. Cassettes labeled as DV indicate recording time of baseline DV; another number can indicate recording time of Long Play DV. Cassettes labeled as DVCPRO have a yellow tape door and indicate recording time when DVCPRO25 is used; with DVCPRO50 the recording time is half, with DVCPRO HD it is a quarter. Cassettes labeled as DVCPRO50 have a blue tape door and indicate recording time when DVCPRO50 is used. Cassettes labeled as DVCPRO HD have a red tape door and indicate recording time when DVCPRO HD-LP format is used; a second number may be used for DVCPRO HD recording, which will be half as long.\nPanasonic stipulated use of a particular magnetic-tape formulation\u2014metal particle (MP)\u2014as an inherent part of its DVCPRO family of formats. Regular DV tape uses Metal Evaporate (ME) formulation (which, as the name suggests, uses physical vapor deposition to deposit metal onto the tape), which was pioneered for use in Hi8 camcorders.\nSmall size (MiniDV).\nSmall cassettes (66 x 48 x 12.2\u00a0mm), also known as \"S-size\" or \"MiniDV\" cassettes, had been intended for amateur use, but were accepted in professional productions as well. MiniDV cassettes were used for recording baseline DV, DVCAM, and HDV. These cassettes came in capacities up to 14\u201320.8\u00a0GB for 63 or 90 minutes of DV or HDV.\nMedium size.\nMedium or \"M-size\" cassettes (97.5 \u00d7 64.5 \u00d7 14.6\u00a0mm), which are about the size of eight-millimeter cassettes, were used in professional Panasonic equipment and are often called \"DVCPRO tapes\". Panasonic video recorders that accept medium cassette can play back from and record to medium cassette in different flavors of DVCPRO format; they will also play small cassettes containing DV or DVCAM recording via an adapter.\nLarge size.\nLarge or \"L-size\" cassettes (125.1 x 78 x 14.6\u00a0mm) are close in size to small MII cassettes and were accepted by most standalone DV tape recorders and were used in many shoulder-mount camcorders. The L-size cassette can be used in both Sony and Panasonic equipment; nevertheless, they are often called \"DVCAM tapes\". Older Sony decks would not play large cassettes with DVCPRO recordings, but newer models can play these and M-size DVCPRO cassettes.\nExtra-large size.\nExtra-large cassettes or \"XL-size\" (172 x 102 x 14.6\u00a0mm) are close in size to VHS cassettes and have been designed for use in Panasonic equipment and are sometimes called DVCPRO\u00a0XL. These cassettes are not widespread, only a few models of Panasonic tape recorders can accept them.\nFile-based media.\nWith proliferation of tapeless camcorder video recording, DV can be recorded on optical discs, solid state flash memory cards and hard disk drives and used as computer files. In particular:\nVideo is stored either as native DIF bitstream or wrapped into an audio/video container such as AVI, QuickTime or MXF.\nConnectivity.\nNearly all DV camcorders and decks have IEEE 1394 (FireWire, i.LINK) ports for digital video transfer. This is usually a two-way port, so that DV data can be \"output\" to a computer (DV-out), or \"input\" from either a computer or another camcorder (DV-in). The DV-in capability makes it possible to copy edited DV from a computer back onto tape, or make a lossless copy between two mutually connected DV camcorders. However, models made for sale in the European Union usually had the DV-in capability disabled in the firmware by the manufacturer because the camcorder would be classified by the EU as a video recorder and would therefore attract higher duty; a model which only had DV-out could be sold at a lower price in the EU.\nWhen video is captured onto a computer it is stored in a container file, which can be either raw DV stream, AVI, WMV or QuickTime. Whichever container is used, the video itself is not re-encoded and represents a complete digital copy of what has been recorded onto tape. If needed, the video can be recorded back to tape to create a full and lossless copy of the original footage.\nSome camcorders also feature a USB 2.0 port for computer connection. This port is usually used for transferring still images, but not for video transfer. Camcorders that offer video transfer over USB usually do not deliver full DV quality; usually it is 320x240 video, except for the Sony DCR-PC1000 camcorder and some Panasonic camcorders that provide transfer of a full-quality DV stream via USB by using the UVC protocol. Full-quality DV can also be captured via USB or Thunderbolt by using separate hardware that receives DV data from the camcorder over a FireWire cable and forwards it without any transcoding to the computer via a USB cable or a Firewire to Thunderbolt adapter - this can be particularly useful for capturing on modern laptop computers which usually do not have a FireWire port or expansion slot but always have USB or Thunderbolt ports.\nHigh end cameras and VTRs may have additional professional outputs such as SDI, SDTI or analog component video. All DV variants have a time code, but some older or consumer computer applications fail to take advantage of it.\nUsage.\nThe high quality and low cost of DV, especially when compared to Video8 and Hi8 which were vulnerable to an unacceptable number of video dropouts and \"hits\", prompted the acceptance by mainstream broadcasters of material shot on DV.\nFilms.\nNotable films that were shot on the DV format include:\nApplication software support.\nMost DV players, editors and encoders only support the basic DV format, but not its professional versions. The exception to this being that most (not all) consumer Sony miniDV equipment will play mini-DVCAM tapes. DV Audio/Video data can be stored as raw DV data stream file (data is written to a file as the data is received over FireWire, file extensions are .dv and .dif) or the DV data can be packed into container files (ex: Microsoft AVI, Apple MOV). The DV meta-information is preserved in both file types being Sub-timecode and Start/Stop date times which can be muxed to Quicktime SMPTE standard timecode.\nMost Windows video software only supports DV in AVI containers, as they use Microsoft's avifile.dll, which only supports reading avi files. Mac OS X video software support both AVI and MOV containers.\nTape formulation compatibility.\nIt was suggested by some professionals that using tape from different manufacturers could lead to dropouts. This was mostly in regard to MiniDV tapes in the mid to late 90s as the only two manufacturers of MiniDV tapes\u2014Sony, who produce their tapes solely under the Sony brand; and Panasonic, who produce their own tapes under their Panasonic brand and outsources for TDK, Canon, etc.\u2014used two different lubrication types for their cameras.\nResearch undertaken by Sony found that there was no hard evidence of the above statement. The only evidence claimed was that using ME tapes in equipment designed for MP tapes can cause tape damage and hence dropouts. Sony has done a significant amount of internal testing to simulate head clogs as a result of mixing tape lubricants, and has been unable to recreate the problem. Sony recommends using cleaning cassettes once every 50 hours of recording or playback. For those who are still skeptical, Sony recommends cleaning video heads with a cleaning cassette before trying another brand of tape.\nIn 1999, Steve Epstein, technical editor of \"Broadcast Engineering\" magazine, received the following response from a Sony representative regarding tape stock compatibility:\n\"Sony developed DVCAM based on the DV consumer format. The DV format was designed for use with metal evaporated tape, which offers approximately 5\u00a0dB better carrier-to-noise figures than metal particle tape. Customers have requested VTRs that can play additional DV-based 6\u00a0mm formats such as the consumer DV LP and DVCPRO. Sony will be offering new VTRs that can play back both of these additional formats without headclog and tape path issues.\"\n\"It was realized early on that the VTR transport needed to be optimized to play various tape formulations and thicknesses. In addition, there is no need to dub DV LP or DVCPRO footage to another format for use as source material. This new VTR is the DSR 2000 DVCAM Studio recorder, and it is expected to be available later this year.\"\nRobert Ott, Vice President for storage products and marketing, Sony Electronics, Park Ridge, New Jersey\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Situated between the Rio Grande Gorge and the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, it is located roughly 50 miles south of the Colorado border. Taos serves as the county seat of Taos County, of which it is the largest municipality, with an estimated population of 6,567 as of 2021.\nThe town of Taos was incorporated in 1934, although humans have lived in the adjacent Taos Pueblo\u2014a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the town's namesake\u2014for roughly a millennium; the town's name derives from the native Taos language meaning \"(place of) red willows\". Initially founded by Spanish colonists in 1615 as \"Don Fernando de Taos\", it was only intermittently occupied until the late 18th century, due to recurring conflict between European and indigenous peoples, most notably the Pueblo Revolt.\nTaos was formally established as a permanent settlement in 1795 by Nuevo M\u00e9xico Governor Fernando Chac\u00f3n, serving as a fortified plaza and trading outpost for the neighboring Taos Pueblo and Hispano communities, including Ranchos de Taos, Ca\u00f1on, Taos Canyon, Ranchitos, El Prado, and Arroyo Seco. During the Mexican\u2013American War, the region was occupied by the United States, triggering a rebellion among Hispanics and American Indians known as the Taos Revolt.\nFollowing U.S. annexation of Nuevo M\u00e9xico, Taos became a stopover for American and European settlers along the vast western frontier. During this period, the town developed its existing reputation as a cultural enclave, with the first artist colony being established in 1898 by painters Ernest Blumenschein and Bert Phillips. Taos has since developed a reputation as a \"counterculture mecca\" and \"beacon for artists\", attracting the likes of painter Georgia O\u2019Keeffe, English poet and writer D.H. Lawrence, and actor Dennis Hopper.\nHistory.\nTaos Pueblo.\nThe Taos Pueblo, which borders the north boundary of the town of Taos, has been occupied for nearly a millennium. It is estimated that the pueblo was built between 1000 and 1450\u00a0AD, with some later expansion. The pueblo is considered to be one of the oldest continuously inhabited communities in the United States.\nLocated in a tributary valley off the Rio Grande, it is the most northern of the New Mexico pueblos. The pueblo, at some places five stories high, is a combination of many individual homes with common walls. There are over 1,900 Taos Puebloans living within the greater pueblo-area community. Many of them have modern homes near their fields and live there in the summer months, only staying at their homes within the main North or South pueblo buildings during cooler weather. About 150 people live within the main pueblo buildings year-round. The Taos Pueblo was added as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1992.\nSpanish colonization.\nTaos was established c.1615 as \"Don Fernando de Taos\", following the Spanish conquest of the Indian Pueblo villages. Initially, relations of the Spanish settlers with Taos Pueblo were amicable, but resentment of meddling by missionaries, and demands by \"encomenderos\" for tribute, led to a revolt in 1640; Taos Indians killed their priest and a number of Spanish settlers and subsequently fled the pueblo, not returning until 1661.\nIn 1680, Taos Pueblo joined the widespread Pueblo Revolt. After the Spanish Reconquest of 1692, Taos Pueblo continued armed resistance to the Spanish until 1696, when Governor Diego de Vargas defeated the Indians at Taos Canyon.\nDuring the 1770s, Taos was repeatedly raided by Comanches who lived on the plains of what is now eastern Colorado. Juan Bautista de Anza, governor of the Province of New Mexico, led a successful punitive expedition in 1779 against the Comanches.\nBetween 1780 and 1800, Don Fernando de Taos (now simply Taos) was established. Between 1796 and 1797, the Don Fernando de Taos land grant gave land to 63 Spanish families in the Taos valley. It was built as a fortified plaza with adobe buildings and is now a central plaza surrounded by residential areas. Mountain men who trapped beaver nearby made Taos their home in the early 1800s.\nU.S. territory and statehood.\nThe U.S. took control of New Mexico in 1847 during the Mexican\u2013American War. In response, Hispanics and American Indians in Taos staged a rebellion known as the Taos Revolt, in which the newly appointed U.S. Governor, Charles Bent, was killed. Mexico subsequently ceded the region to the U.S. pursuant to the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848. New Mexico was a territory of the United States beginning in 1850 and became a state in 1912.\nFor historical reasons, the American flag is displayed continuously at Taos Plaza (both day and night). This derives from the time of the American Civil War, when Confederate sympathizers in the area attempted to remove the flag. Union officer Kit Carson sought to discourage this activity by having guards surround the area and fly the flag 24\u00a0hours a day.\nAnton Docher, the \"Padre of Isleta\", first served as a priest in Taos before leaving for Isleta in 1891.\nTaos art colony.\nBeginning in 1899, artists began to settle in Taos; six formed the Taos Society of Artists in 1915. In time, the Taos art colony developed. Many paintings were made of local scenes, especially of Taos Pueblo and activities there, as the artists often modelled Native Americans from the pueblo in their paintings. Some of the artists' studios have been preserved and may be viewed by visitors to Taos. These include the Ernest L. Blumenschein House, the Eanger Irving Couse House and Studio\u2014Joseph Henry Sharp Studios, and the Nicolai Fechin house, all of which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. A number of Foundations host artist residencies in Taos including the prestigious Helene Wurlitzer Foundation which began hosting painters, writers, composers, sculptors, poets and filmmakers at Casa Encantado in 1954.\nHistoric sites and tourism.\nTaos is home to more than twenty sites on the National Register of Historic Places.\nPueblos.\nAbout north of Taos is Taos Pueblo. Picuris Pueblo is located about south.\nTaos Fiestas.\nThe Fiestas de Taos is an annual community celebration in the Taos Plaza honoring the feast of the two patron saints of Taos, Santa Ana and Santiago. It is normally celebrated the third weekend of July. A commemorative mass and procession from Our Lady of Guadalupe Church officially opens the event on Friday evening, followed with the crowning of the Fiestas Queen. The celebration continues with musical and dance performances scheduled on the plaza every hour. Two parades are staged, a children's parade on Saturday and the larger Fiesta Parade on Sunday.\nBent Street.\nLocated just north of the Taos Plaza, this street was the location of Governor Charles Bent's home.\nBent was scalped and killed by Pueblo warriors during the Taos Revolt on January 19, 1847. During the Taos Revolt, Bent's horses were set free from their stable.\nArtists' homes and studios.\nPresent.\nThe Helene Wurlitzer Foundation is a non-profit organization based in Taos that provides free residency to eleven artists, with each year divided into three residency sessions of three months apiece at Casa Encantado.\nAbbie Conant, former principal trombonist of the Munich Philharmonic Orchestra and seasonal Taos resident, runs a studio three blocks from the plaza. In addition to the studio having capacity to seat 60, there is also a two bedroom living space. In addition to her and her husband's own performances, the studio has hosted poetry readings, presentations and performance from local Taose\u00f1as and fellows from the Wurlitzer Foundation.\nHistoric.\nMany of the historic sites are homes and studios of artists, including the Mabel Dodge Luhan House, Eanger Irving Couse House and Studio\u2014Joseph Henry Sharp Studios, the Nicolai Fechin House, the Leon Gaspard House, and the Ernest Martin Hennings House.\nDoc Martin's restaurant in the historic Taos Inn was previously the office of Thomas \"Doc\" Martin, while other parts of the inn served as his home and the birthplace of the Taos Society of Artists. On Ledoux street, just south of the Taos Plaza, is the Ernest L. Blumenschein House and Harwood House.\nOther historic sites.\nThe center of the Taos Downtown Historic District is the Taos Plaza. Just west of that is the Our Lady of Guadalupe Church. North of the Taos Plaza is the Governor Charles Bent House and the Taos Inn. Further north in Taos is the Bernard Beimer House. On the southwestern edge of the Taos Historic district is La Loma Plaza Historic District. East of the plaza on Kit Carson Road is the Kit Carson House.\nNorth of Taos is the Turley Mill and Distillery Site and the Rio Grande Gorge Bridge. Just outside Taos in Ranchitos is the Martinez Hacienda, the home turned museum of the late Padre Antonio Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez. South of Taos is the Ranchos de Taos Plaza with the San Francisco de Asis Mission Church.\nAbout northwest is the D. H. Lawrence Ranch (originally known as the Kiowa Ranch and now owned by the University of New Mexico), the home of the English novelist in the 1920s. It is believed that his ashes are buried there at the D. H. Lawrence Memorial.\nArts.\nThere are three art museums in Taos: Harwood Museum of Art, Taos Art Museum and Millicent Rogers Museum that provide art from the Pueblo Native Americans, Taos Society of Artists and modern and contemporary artists of the Taos art colony. The town has more than 80 art galleries, and there are several houses of the Taos Society of Artists.\nThere are several local venues for the performing arts in Taos. The Taos Center for the Arts (TCA) draws nationally renowned and local performers at the Taos Community Auditorium. They also present independent film series. Three chamber music groups perform at TCA: Taos School of Music, Taos Chamber Music Group, and Music from Angel Fire. The Harwood Museum of Art is site of other performances and lectures. The Town of Taos Convention Center offers a venue for other local performances.\nThe Taos Talking Pictures Film Festival was a film festival held in the town from the mid-1990s to 2003. The festival's top prize was of land.\nRecreation.\nThe Carson National Forest and Rio Grande del Norte National Monument provide many opportunities for recreation, such as hiking, skiing, fly fishing, horseback riding, golfing, hot air ballooning, llama trekking, rafting, and mountain biking. The South Boundary National Recreation trail, east of town in Carson National Forest, is consistently ranked the best mountain bike trail in New Mexico.\nThere are also numerous hot springs along the Rio Grande and in the Taos Mountains. Ojo Caliente offers locations where visitors can enjoy access to mineral springs as well as massages and other spa treatments. Among hot springs in the area is a historical site called Stage Coach, which used to double as a brothel during the times of the Old West. Nearby, the Cumbres &amp; Toltec Scenic Railroad provides a ride through the Toltec Gorge and Rocky Mountain passes in an authentic narrow-gauge steam railroad.\nIn the winter, many people come to Taos to ski in the mountains. Nearby Wheeler Peak, at , is the highest peak in New Mexico. The Taos area has four ski areas \u2013 Taos Ski Valley, Red River ski area, Sipapu (ski area) and Angel Fire ski area. Other winter activities include hot air ballooning, horseback riding, snow-shoeing, cross-country skiing, ski skating, ice skating, ice fishing and snowmobiling.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\nTaos is the principal town of the Taos, NM, Micropolitan Statistical Area, which includes all of Taos County.\nAs of the 2010 census Taos had a population of 5,716. The median age was 44.

The average household size was 2.18 and the average family size was 2.87.\nIn the town, the population was spread out, with 23% under the age of 18, 6.6% from 18 to 24, 26.4% from 25 to 44, 27.8% from 45 to 64, and 16.2% who were 65\u00a0years of age or older. The median age was 41\u00a0years. For every 100 females, there were 85 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 81.3 males.\nThe median income for a household in the town was $25,016, and the median income for a family was $33,564. Males had a median income of $27,683 versus $23,326 for females. The per capita income for the town was $15,983. About 17.9% of families and 23.1% of the population were below the poverty line, including 26.8% of those under age 18 and 24.4% of those age 65 or over.\nGeography and climate.\nTaos is located at (36.393979, \u2212105.576705).\nThe town has a total area of , all land.\nTaos is located within two watersheds, categorized as subwatersheds or HUC12s in the United States. The town is mostly located in the Outlet Rio Fernando del Taos Watershed, where its two waterbodies are rated as impaired. A coalition of local organizations are working to improve the watershed's health. The northern edge of town is within the Rio Fernando del Taos-Rio Pueblo del Taos Watershed.\nJust to the west of Taos is the Rio Grande Gorge, cutting through the basalt flows of the Taos Plateau volcanic field and crossed by the Rio Grande Gorge Bridge, now a part of U.S. Route 64.\nThe elevation of the town is . Just north of Taos is Wheeler Peak, at , the highest point in New Mexico. Taos has a warm-summer humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen \"Dfb\"), though it borders on a semi-arid climate (\"BSk\") due to the low rainfall. The town is characterized by extreme diurnal variations of temperature. Even when summer days get extremely hot, nights cool off considerably.\nMud season.\nDirt roads and driveways in Taos can experience a particularly bad mud season when winter weather is followed by unseasonably warm temperatures. This occurs because area soil is heavy with silt, which makes it vulnerable to frost heaving.\nEducation.\nThe town's public schools operated by Taos Municipal Schools include Arroyos del Norte Elementary School, Enos Garc\u00eda Elementary (also Taos Elementary School), Ranchos Elementary School, Taos Middle School, Taos High School and Taos Cyber Magnet School.\nCharter schools include Anansi Charter School, Taos Academy (State Charter), Taos Municipal Charter School and Vista Grande High School. Also in the area are additional alternative and private schools: Chrysalis Alternative School, Sped Discipline, Yaxche Private School, Taos Christian Academy, and San Francisco De Asis School. The Bureau of Indian Education-operated Taos Day School is in nearby Taos Pueblo.\nDallas-based Southern Methodist University operates a campus at Fort Burgwin in Taos.\nAlbuquerque-based University of New Mexico (UNM) operates a community campus in Taos, with eight affiliated buildings in Taos, such as the UNM Harwood Museum of Art and Taos High School where some classes are held.\nThe Earthship Academy (or Earthship Biotecture Academy) is offering training in Earthship design principles, construction methods and philosophy. Earthship is a particular type of sustainable architecture and design, based around solar power.\nGovernment.\nThe town of Taos is incorporated under the mayor-council form of government. The town was incorporated on May\u00a07, 1934. The town seal is a logo of the town of Taos with the year of incorporation \"1934\" in the center, and on the outer edge, the words \"Town of Taos, New Mexico\".\nThe elective officers of the town include the mayor, four members of the governing body forming the town council, and a municipal judge. The town council is the board of finance of the town. The town manager and finance director serve as the nonvoting members to the board of finance. Key positions within the town government are town manager, appointed by the mayor, Town Attorney, Town Clerk, Town Engineer and Chief of Police.\nAs of April\u00a02022[ [update]] the town officers were:\nTaos is predominantly made up of Democrats; in 2008, approximately 74% of registered Taos County voters were Democrats, 13% were Republicans, and about 13% identified with other parties or declined to affiliate with a party.\nTransportation.\nPublic.\nThe RTD Chile Line, operated by the North Central Regional Transit District (NCRTD), is Taos' only public transportation system. It provides fare-free in-town service as well as seasonal service up to Taos Ski Valley. The transit system also provides paratransit service for citizens with special needs and ensures that all route buses are American Disability Act (ADA) equipped.\nThe RTD Taos Express promotes local tourism and provides weekend express service, for a nominal fee, from the Taos Plaza to the New Mexico Rail Runner, Santa Fe Municipal Airport, and Santa Fe transit.\nThe North Central Regional Transit District (NCRTD) has public transportation service into the Town from throughout Taos County and the Counties of Santa Fe, Rio Arriba and Los Alamos. The Taos region has service to Cerro, Penasco, Questa, Red River, the Rio Grande corridor and the University of New Mexico \u2013 Taos Klaur campus. At the Espa\u00f1ola Transit Center, passengers can connect to other regional routes, such as Espa\u00f1ola, Santa Fe, Los Alamos, and Northern Pueblos area. In 2003 the Regional Transit District Act was enacted, which authorized the creation of Regional Transit Districts (RTD's) in the state of New Mexico; In September 2004, the North Central Regional RTD was the first RTD to be certified by the New Mexico Transportation Commission.\nAirports.\nTaos Regional Airport (SKX) is under the direct supervision of the Town of Taos. The airport is located just a few miles north of the Town of Taos on U.S. Route 64 towards the Rio Grande Gorge Bridge.\nOther airports in New Mexico include the Santa Fe Municipal Airport and Albuquerque International Sunport.\nMedia.\nNewspapers.\n\"El Crepusculo de la Libertad\" was the first Taos newspaper, which began in 1834 with the first printing press west of the Mississippi. Its successor \"The Taos News\", which also does business as \"El Crepusculo\", is the primary printed newspaper in Taos.\nOnline.\n\"The Taos News\" provides weekly online publications of their newspaper.\nTelevision.\nThere are two local cable television stations: Taos Local Television Public Access Channel 2 and Channel 22. See also List of television stations in New Mexico.\nRadio.\nRadio stations serving Taos include:\nIn popular culture.\nTaos has been featured in \"The Nine Lives of Elfego Baca\" (1960) and \"And Now Miguel\" (1966).\nCountry music artist Waylon Jennings sang a song titled \"Taos, New Mexico\" on his 1967 album \"Love of the Common People.\"\nA different song, also called \"Taos, New Mexico\", was a chart hit for Canadian singer/songwriter R. Dean Taylor in 1972. The song charted in Canada, Australia, the Netherlands, and the US, reaching top 40 on the US Adult Contemporary charts.\nThe character Deputy Marshal Sam McCloud in the 1977 television series \"McCloud\", played by Dennis Weaver, was portrayed as being from Taos.\nIn his 1983 novel \"Christine\", writer Stephen King states that Leigh Cabot eventually settled in Taos with her husband and twin daughters.\nA \"businessman from Taos\" is referenced in the 2022 Charley Crockett song \"Tom Turkey\".\nOn September\u00a018, 1991, the PBS television series \"Reading Rainbow\" shot its 73rd episode \"The Legend of the Indian Paintbrush\" here. The title was based on a book by Tomie dePaola and was narrated by Harold Littlebird (born 1951). Santa Fe's Dominic C. Arquero introduced himself at this program's beginning.\nThe Volkswagen Taos, introduced in October 2018, is named after the town to pay tribute to its former resident John Muir, a structural engineer who authored a Volkswagen repair book in 1969.\nIn \"Young Justice\", Taos is the location of the Metahuman Youth Center, a community center founded by the Justice League and S.T.A.R. Labs to assist victims of metahuman trafficking.\nTaos Hum.\nAn ongoing low-frequency noise, audible only to some, is thought to originate somewhere near this town and is consequently sometimes known as the Taos Hum. Those who have heard the Hum usually hear it west of Taos near Tres Orejas. The Taos Hum was featured in a 1995 episode of the television series \"Unsolved Mysteries\", was mentioned in a 1998 episode of \"The X-Files\", and was featured in a 2018 episode of \"Criminal Minds\".\nSister cities.\nTaos has one sister city, as designated by Sister Cities International:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In addition to individual members, 70 national Esperanto organizations are affiliated with UEA. Its current president is Fernando Maia. The magazine \"Esperanto\" is the main publication to inform UEA members about everything happening in the Esperanto community.\nThe UEA was founded in 1908 by the Swiss journalist Hector Hodler and others and is now headquartered in Rotterdam, Netherlands. The organization has official relations with the United Nations and has an office at the United Nations headquarters in New York City.\nStructure and affiliated organizations.\nAccording to its 1980 statutes (Statuto de UEA), the World Esperanto Association has two kinds of members:\nThe UEA's supervisory board, the \"Komitato\", has members (\"komitatanoj\") elected in three different ways:\nThe \"Komitato\" serves as a sort of parliament and elects a board, the \"Estraro\". The \"Estraro\" installs a general director and sometimes a director as well. The general director and staff work at the UEA headquarters, \"Oficejo de UEA\", in Rotterdam.\nIndividual members can become a \"delegito\", a 'delegate', who serves as a local contact person for Esperanto and UEA members in their town. A \"\u0109efdelegito\" (chief delegate) is someone installed also by the UEA headquarters, but with the task to collect and remit membership fees in a given country.\nYouth section.\nTEJO, the World Esperanto Youth Organization, is the youth section of the UEA. Similar to the World Congress, TEJO organizes an International Youth Congress of Esperanto (\"Internacia Junulara Kongreso\") each year in a different location. The IJK is a week-long event of concerts, presentations, excursions attended by hundreds of young people from all over the world.\nThe youth section has a \"Komitato\" and national and specialist affiliated organizations, just as the UEA itself. A TEJO volunteer works at the Rotterdam headquarters.\nNational organizations.\nThe first national Esperanto organization was founded in 1898 in France, originally as a potential international association. In 1903 the second one followed, in Switzerland. Within a couple of years, many of the still existing national organizations came into existence. Since 1933-1934 they have sent representatives to the UEA \"Komitato\", making it a federation of national organizations. In Esperanto these were initially termed as \"Naciaj Societoj\" (national societies), but they have subsequently become known as \"Landaj Asocioj\" (country associations).\nWhen UEA accepted national organizations in 1933-1934 for the first time, it required them to\nEspecially the last prerequisite caused serious problems, e.g. to the German national association submitting to Nazi Party rule. Decades later, in 1959, the Cuban association was refused because its statutes respected the leading role of the Communist Party of Cuba. In 1980, the UEA statutes were altered to specify that while a national organization need not be neutral itself, it must respect the neutrality of UEA.\nSpecialist organizations.\nSpecialist organizations are similar to the national organizations. They are divided into two groups:\nThe youth section TEJO has two affiliated specialist groups, the Esperantist cyclists and Esperantist rock music fans.\nActivities.\nPublications.\nUEA publishes \"Esperanto\", the most important Esperanto periodical. It was started in 1905 by Paul Berthelot, three years before UEA was founded. UEA founder Hector Hodler took it over in 1907 and made it the official UEA magazine in 1908. In 1920 he left the magazine to the association. Since the 1950s it has had a paid editor-in-chief. Next to \"Esperanto\", the \"Yearbook\" (\"Jarlibro de UEA\") which published for 108 years, was the oldest continuous publication of the association.\nUEA publishes books and has the largest mail-order Esperanto bookstore in the world (with over 6,000 book titles, CDs and other items). It also maintains an information centre and an important Esperanto library, called the Hector Hodler Library. The organisation has a network of local representatives from around the world, the \"Delegita Reto\", who are available to provide information about their geographical area or professional field.\nConventions.\nThe yearly World Esperanto Congress (\"Universala Kongreso de Esperanto\"), which attracts 1,500\u20133,000 people to a different city each year, is held under the direction of UEA. The first congress took place in 1905, and since 1933\u20131934 the UEA has had responsibility for the annual event. Since 2009, World Congresses have been held in Bia\u0142ystok, Poland, the hometown of L. L. Zamenhof, the creator and guiding spirit of Esperanto, as well as in Havana, Copenhagen, Hanoi, Reykjav\u00edk, Buenos Aires, Lille, Nitra, Seoul, Lisbon, Lahti, Montreal and Turin. In 2020 and 2021 the Congresses were held virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Congresses are scheduled for Arusha, Tanzania in 2024 and Brno, Czech Republic in 2025.\nTwice a year, in spring and autumn, UEA headquarters in Rotterdam holds an Open Day.\nInternational organizations.\nIn addition to the UN and UNESCO, UEA also has consultative relations with UNICEF and the Council of Europe, and a general working relationship with the Organization of American States. It works in an official capacity with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) as an A-liaison to ISO/TC37. UEA is active in public information in the European Union and, as necessary, at other interstate and international organizations and conferences. The organisation is a member of the European Language Council, a common forum of universities and language associations for the awareness of languages and cultures inside and outside the European Union.\nIn May 2011, UEA officially became an Associate Member of the International Information Centre for Terminology (Infoterm).\nGrabowski Prize.\nThe Grabowski Prize is a prize awarded to young authors writing in Esperanto by the Antoni Grabowski Foundation, part of the World Esperanto Association (UEA). It is named after Antoni Grabowski, who has been called \"the father of Esperanto poetry\". The awards for the first three winners are $700, $300 and $150 respectively.\nPast recipients.\nUlrich Becker, a publisher of literature in and about Esperanto and of interlinguistic literature in general, was awarded the Grabowski Prize (Premio Grabowski) in 2005 for his achievements in publishing in Esperanto. Among other works, he is the publisher of the thrice-yearly periodical of Esperanto belles-lettres, \"Beletra Almanako\".\nHistory.\nThe founding years of the Esperanto movement, 1888\u20131914.\nThe modern UEA is the result of a decades-long process of several attempts to give the Esperanto movement a sound foundation. The first Esperanto associations were local clubs, of which the one in Nuremberg, Germany, is considered the first (1888). From 1898, national Esperanto associations were found in several countries, with the French one being the first. In 1903 followed the Swiss association; then in 1904 the British, in 1906 the German and Swedish, etc.\nThe founder of Esperanto, L. L. Zamenhof, wished for an international association to come into existence, but the first world congress of 1905 produced only a general manifesto about the essence and neutrality of the movement. The organizing team passed the torch to organizers of a next congress the year after, which eventually created a \"Konstanta Kongresa Komitato\" (Permanent Congress Committee). It consisted of two members representing the previous congress, two for the current one, and two for the next following congress.\nEsperantists agreed that the whole movement must support two common international tasks: international documentation, propaganda in countries without movements of their own, lobbying at international organizations, organizing the world congresses, etc. Esperantists did disagree on which or what organization should be responsible for these tasks, how it should collect the money and how it should decide on spending the money.\nIn 1906, the French Gen. Hyppolyte Sebert created his \"Esperantista Centra Oficejo\" (Central Office of the Esperantists) in Paris. It collected information on the movement and published an \"Oficiala Gazeto\". In spite of this 'official' name, the office was a purely private enterprise of Sebert, but he tried to engender support from the various national associations.\nOne year later, at the Geneva world congress, Zamenhof created a \"Lingva Komitato\" (Language Committee), the basis of the later Akademio de Esperanto. It consisted of some eminent speakers from several countries and was intended to safeguard the evolution of the Esperanto language; members were elected for a nine-year term.\nIn 1908, a group of young Esperanto speakers founded an international association based on individual, direct membership: \"Universala Esperanto-Asocio\", based in Geneva. According to Hector Hodler and his followers, an international cause such as Esperanto must be supported by a unitary, truly international association, and UEA members should found separate organizations on national and local levels.\nThe national (and local) associations initially saw the UEA not as a supporting resource but as a threat, as undesirable competition. They were afraid of a division in the movement between the traditional groups on the one hand and the UEA members on the other. Also, propaganda and lessons were the task of the national associations (often federations of local groups). They did not like the perspective that new Esperantists, created by the traditional groups, would be picked up by UEA.\nThe national associations then tried to build up an international organizational level of their own. A first attempt took the form of \"rajtigitaj delegitoj\" to the congresses in 1911 and 1912 (not to be confused with the UEA \"delegitoj\"); an \"Internacia Unui\u011do de Esperantistaj Societoj\" (International Union of Esperanto associations, 1913-1914) was a second attempt. This evolutionary thread ceased in 1914 with the breakout of World War I, which forced the movement as a whole to pause many of its activities, and the Congresses planned for 1916, 1917, 1918 and 1919 were cancelled.\nUEA in its first years.\nThe original UEA was purely based on individual membership. The members in a given locality, e.g. a town, were supposed to have UEA member conventions and elect a \"delegito\" (plural \"delegitoj\"), a delegate. The delegate was tasked with collecting membership fees and sending them to the Geneva headquarters, and was expected to represent the other local members on the international level. The totality of delegates held referendums, and they elected the \"Komitato.\"\nThe Komitato board initially had eight (since 1910: ten) members, with a president and a vice-president. One of the board members served as director; from 1908 to 1920 this was Hector Hodler. The director installed delegates in towns with fewer than 20 members. These were 94 percent of the delegates, so the UEA was not so much a democracy but a circular, self-renewing system of cooptation. (Since 1920, the \"Komitato\" was enlarged, becoming a kind of parliament, and a board with the name \"Estraro\" was established.)\nHodler was still the owner and publisher of his magazine \"Esperanto\", published every second week. From the beginning, UEA had a Yearbook \u2014 \"Jarlibro\" \u2014 with basic information about the association and with the addresses of the delegates.\nEsperanto speakers are divided by different subjects they are interested in. In those early years, some specialist organizations developed \u2014 for example, the \"Universala Medicina Esperanto-Asocio\" of 1908. Hodler tried to give those 'specialists' a home in the UEA. Instead of founding specialized associations of their own, with separate bulletins and conventions, he wanted them to be UEA members and have 'fakoj' (compartments). He also thought of partner organizations \u2014 for example, hotels which would give a discount to UEA members in exchange for an advertisement in the UEA Yearbook.\nHodler projected an organization fit to contain tens or hundreds of thousands of members, the so-called \"esperantianoj\" (UEA members, in opposition to the simple \"esperantistoj\", Esperanto speakers). In fact, UEA never exceeded a membership of 10,000. The association adopted several new statutes until 1920.\nAttempts at organization in the interbellum, 1920\u20131933.\nIn 1920, the Esperanto movement gathered again for the first time since the war, at The Hague congress. The discussions eventually created the so-called Helsinki system, on which UEA and the national associations agreed at the congress of 1922 in the Finnish capital. This system defined the movement to consist of these 'official' entities:\nThis Helsinki system lasted for only a couple of years. The heads of the movement saw that at the world congresses there was considerable overlap, and three separate groups were discussing essentially the same subjects: the \"Komitato\" of UEA, the \"Ko-Ro\" of the national associations and the six members of the \"ICK.\" From 1929, they all had a joint gathering called \"\u011cenerala Estraro\" (general board). A number of proposals came up in the movement to reform the organization.\nThe final blow to the Helsinki system came in 1932 when UEA did not pay its contributions for the common budget, and the same was true for some of the national associations. The British, German and French associations, the largest ones, took up the initiative to found a new organization, \"Universala Federacio Esperantista\" (World Federation of Esperantists), as a federation of national associations. This new organization had scarcely come into existence when in early 1933 the UEA and the national organizations agreed on a complete reform of the movement.\nThe 'new UEA' and the schism of 1936.\nIn 1933, at the Cologne congress, UEA and the national organizations made UEA the common or umbrella organization of the international Esperanto movement. In 1934 the UEA members accepted new UEA statutes. The 'new UEA', as it was called, was (and still is) a federation of national associations but also of individual members directly administered by UEA.\nThe highest organ of UEA was the Komitato. It gathered representatives from the national organizations; the numbers depended on the size of the national organization. Other representatives were elected by the delegates, depending on the number of delegates. A third group of representatives was elected by the two first groups; this opened the possibility to include 'experts' who were not linked to a national organization or popular among the delegates. Since 1947, one speaks of the \"komitatanoj A\" (from the national organizations), the \"komitatanoj B\" (from the delegates, later members) and the \"komitatanoj C\" (those indirectly elected).\nAs the representatives of the national organizations by far outnumbered the others, it is right to call UEA in essence a federation. But all officeholders of UEA had to be individual members, and the core services of the association, such as the Yearbook, were still reserved to individual members.\nUEA since then is the legal heir of the former Helsinki organizations, such as the International Central Committee. The association since then also organizes the annual World Congress of Esperanto.\nAlthough in 1933-1934 it first seemed that the transition could happen in harmony, at the 1934 congress in Stockholm some UEA functionaries were not re-elected. In anger, UEA president Eduard Stettler and others resigned. The new board with president Louis Bastien faced a catastrophic financial situation and decided in early 1936 to depart Geneva for London. In London, the capable activist Cecil C. Goldsmith wanted to become the new director (secretary), and for certain currency reasons UEA could exist significantly more cheaply in Britain than in Switzerland.\nA hastily organized and secret campaign, led by former president Stettler, made it impossible for the Bastien-led board to legally move the headquarters away from Switzerland. After several months of discussions and a referendum, the Bastien board members and the Komitato members left the UEA altogether and established, in September 1936, a new association, the \"Internacia Esperanto-Ligo\" (IEL). Nearly all national organizations and individual members followed. In Geneva there remained a near-deserted shell of the UEA, in which the old leaders once again took power, the so-called Genevan UEA.\nUEA after World War II.\nThe international Esperanto movement survived World War II with its IEL headquarters in Heronsgate, near London. Hans Jakob, from the Genevan UEA, tricked the IEL board into a merger of IEL and the rump Genevan UEA, falsely stating that the wealthy Eduard Stettler had left a huge sum to the UEA.\nIvo Lapenna, a London law professor originally coming from Croatia, in the 1950s reshaped the association significantly. The office moved from Heronsgate to Rotterdam, the board since then has a \"general secretary\", the \"Esperanto\" editor is a paid position. After 1956, the association in 1980 was again (and since then for the last time) given new statutes.\nIn the decades after the war, the staff grew. Before the war, it was common to have a director with only one or two assistants. After the war, the UEA at times employed ten or more people (e.g. a congress manager, a book seller, a librarian.)\nLapenna introduced a \"prestige policy\", for which he was willing to spend considerable funds. This included signature campaigns for Esperanto and efforts to make UNESCO support Esperanto in a moral way, which Lapenna accomplished in 1954 at the UNESCO conference in Montevideo, Uruguay. This made him famous in Esperanto circles as the \"hero of Montevideo\". After having served for more than 30 years on the board of UEA, Lapenna left the association in 1974 and created a rival organization (\"Ne\u016dtrala Esperanto-Movado\").\nDuring the Cold War, UEA had to deal with the difficulty of having national organizations and individual members in communist countries. Additionally, the work of Esperanto organizations in Western countries was sometimes influenced by the Cold War: In the early 50s, the American Esperanto leader George Allan Connor denounced dissenting members of his national organization as communists. His national organization and he as an individual were eventually thrown out of UEA. The collapse of the Soviet Union and its allied states between 1989 and 1991 completely changed the international situation.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is credited as one of the founding fathers of Spanish California and served as an official within New Spain as Governor of the province of New Mexico.\nEarly life.\nJuan Bautista de Anza Bezerra Nieto was born in Fronteras, New Navarre, New Spain (today Sonora, Mexico) in 1736 (near Arizpe), most probably at Cuquiarachi, Sonora, but possibly at the Presidio of Fronteras.\nHis family was a part of the military leadership in New Spain (\"Nueva Espa\u00f1a\"), as his father and maternal grandfather, Captain Antonio Bezerra Nieto, had both served Spain, their families living on the frontier of Nueva Navarra. He was the son of Juan Bautista de Anza\u00a0I. It is traditionally thought that he may have been educated at the College of San Ildefonso in Mexico City, and later at the military academy there. In 1752 he enlisted in the army at the Presidio of Fronteras. He advanced rapidly and had become a captain by 1760. He married in 1761. His wife was Ana Mar\u00eda P\u00e9rez Serrano (b. January 1744/45, d. date unknown), the daughter of Spanish mine owner Francisco P\u00e9rez Serrano. They had no children. His military duties mainly consisted of hostile forays against Native Americans, such as the Apache, during the course of which he explored much of what is now Arizona.\nCalifornia expeditions.\nThe Spanish began colonizing Alta California with the Portol\u00e1 expedition of 1769\u20131770. The two-pronged Portol\u00e1 effort involved both a long sea voyage against prevailing winds and the California Current, and a difficult land route from Baja California. Colonies were established at San Diego and Monterey, with a presidio and Franciscan mission at each location. A more direct land route and further colonization were desired, especially at present-day San Francisco, which Portol\u00e1 saw but was not able to colonize. By the time of Juan Bautista de Anza's expedition, three more missions had been established, including Mission San Antonio de Padua west of the Salinas Valley.\nIn 1772, Anza proposed an expedition to Alta California to the Viceroy of New Spain. This was approved by the King of Spain and on January 8, 1774, with 3 padres, 20 soldiers, 11 servants, 35 mules, 65 cattle, and 140 horses, Anza set forth from Tubac Presidio, south of present-day Tucson, Arizona. Anza heard of a California Native American called Sebastian Tarabal who had fled from Mission San Gabriel to Sonora, and took him as guide. The expedition took a southern route along the Rio Altar (Sonora y Sinaloa, New Spain), then paralleled the present-day Mexico\u2013California border, crossing the Colorado River at its confluence with the Gila River. This was in the domain of the Yuma tribe, with which he established good relations.\nAnza reached Mission San Gabriel Arc\u00e1ngel, near the California coast, on March 22, 1774, and Monterey, California, Alta California's future capital (Alta California split from Las Californias 1804, creating Baja and Alta), on April 19. He returned to Tubac by late May 1774. This expedition was closely watched by Viceroy and King, and on October 2, 1774, Anza was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-colonel, and ordered to lead a group of colonists to Alta California. The Spanish were desirous of reinforcing their presence in Alta California as a buffer against Russian colonization of the Americas advancing from the north, and possibly establish a harbor that would give shelter to Spanish ships. The expedition got under way on October 23, 1775, and arrived at Mission San Gabriel Arc\u00e1ngel in January 1776, the colonists having suffered greatly from the winter weather en route.\nThe expedition continued on to Monterey with the colonists. Having fulfilled his mission from the Viceroy, he continued north with the priest Pedro Font and a party of twelve others, following an inland route to the San Francisco Bay established in 1770 by Pedro Fages. On the way, he led a raid on Apache settlements near Presidio San Ignacio de Tubac, capturing forty Apaches. The soldiers divided the captives among them as slaves; Anza kept the fifteen female captives and their newborns as his share.\nIn Anza's diary on March 25, 1776, he states that he \"arrived at the arroyo of San Joseph Cupertino (now Stevens Creek), which is useful only for travelers. Here we halted for the night, having come eight leagues in seven and a half hours. From this place we have seen at our right the estuary which runs from the port of San Francisco.\" Pressing on, Anza located the sites for the Presidio of San Francisco and Mission San Francisco de Asis in present-day San Francisco, California on March 28, 1776. He did not establish the settlement; it was established later by Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn Moraga. While returning to Monterey, he located the original sites for Mission Santa Clara de Asis and the town of San Jos\u00e9 de Guadalupe (present-day San Jose, California), but again did not establish either settlement. Today this route is marked as the Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail.\nDespite DeAnza's successes, Spanish ambitions to establish a permanent overland route from Sonora to Alta California were thwarted in 1781, when a revolt of the Yumas tribe closed the trail at the Yuma Crossing of the Colorado River. The route was not reopened until the late 1820s, and the only regular travel to Alta California during the intervening years was by sea.\nGovernor of New Mexico.\nOn his return from this successful expedition in 1777 he journeyed to Mexico City with the chief of the lower Colorado River area Quechan (Yuma) Native American tribe who requested the establishment of a mission. On August 24, 1777, the Viceroy of New Spain appointed Anza as the Governor of the Province of Nuevo M\u00e9xico, the present-day U.S. state of New Mexico.\nGovernor Anza led a punitive expedition against the Comanche group of Native Americans, who had been repeatedly raiding Taos during 1779. With his Ute and Apache Native American allies, and around 800 Spanish soldiers, Anza went north through the San Luis Valley, entering the Great Plains at what is now Manitou Springs, Colorado. Circling \"El Capitan\" (current day Pikes Peak), he surprised a small force of the Comanche near present-day Colorado Springs. Pursuing them south down Fountain Creek, he crossed the Arkansas River near present-day Pueblo, Colorado. He found the main body of the Comanche on Greenhorn Creek, returning from a raid in Nuevo M\u00e9xico, and won a decisive victory. Chief Cuerno Verde, for whom Greenhorn Creek is named, and many other leaders of the Comanche were killed.\nIn late 1779, Anza and his party found a route from Santa Fe to Sonora, west of the El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro. His various local military expeditions against tribes defending their homelands were often successful, but the Quechan (Yuma) Native American tribe which he had established peace with earlier rebelled, and he fell out of favor with the military commander of the Northern Frontier, the frontier-general. In 1783 Anza led a campaign against the Comanche on the eastern plains and by 1784 they were suing for peace. The last of the Comanche chiefs eventually acceded and a formal treaty was concluded on 28 February 1786 at Pecos Pueblo. This paved the way for traders and the development of the Comanchero trade.\nJuan Bautista de Anza remained as governor of Nuevo Mexico (New Mexico) until 1787 when he returned to Sonora. He was appointed commander of the Presidio of Tucson in 1788 but died before he could depart and take office. He was 52 years old. Anza was survived by his wife.\nJuan Bautista de Anza died in Arizpe, in what is now the State of Sonora, Mexico, and was buried in the \"Church of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Asunci\u00f3n de Arizpe\". In 1963, with the participation of delegations from the University of California, Berkeley and San Francisco, he was disinterred and reburied in a new marble memorial mausoleum at the same Church.\nLegacy.\nThe primary legacy is the Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail in California and Arizona, administered by the US National Park Service, for hiking and driving the route of his expedition exploring Las Californias In the San Fernando Valley the trail crosses the Upper Las Virgenes Canyon Open Space Preserve, and in the San Gabriel Valley the trail is in the Puente Hills just north of Whittier, California.\nAlso named for Anza is Anza-Borrego Desert State Park, located mostly in eastern San Diego County, California. The park contains a long and difficult stretch of the Anza trail, traveling west from the Imperial Valley to the coastal mountain passes northeast of San Diego. The de Anza Country Club and its 18-hole championship Golf course is located within the village of Borrego Springs, California, which is entirely surrounded by the park.\nA building named the Juan de Anza House in San Juan Bautista, California is a National Historic Landmark. However, it was constructed c. 1830 with its connection unclear. The Juan Bautista de Anza Community Park is in Calabasas, California, and De Anza Park and the De Anza Community and Teen Center are in Ontario, California.\nA statue of Anza, sculpted in 1939, is located in Riverside, California at the corner of Magnolia Ave. and 14th Street, and another statue stands in Lake Merced park, San Francisco. A portrait of de Anza by Albert Herter in 1929 hangs in the History Room of the Los Angeles Central Library.\nThe de Anza and De Anza spellings are also the namesake of streets, schools, and buildings in his honor including: De Anza Boulevards in San Mateo and Cupertino, De Anza Park in Sunnyvale, De Anza College in Cupertino, De Anza High School in Richmond, Juan Bautista De Anza elementary school in San Jacinto, Juan De Anza K-5 in the Wiseburn Elementary School District of Hawthorne, De Anza Middle School in Ontario, De Anza Middle School in Ventura, De Anza Elementary School in El Centro, and the De Anza School in Baldwin Park, the landmark De Anza Hotel in San Jose, and the historic De Anza Hotel in Calexico\u2014all in California. Also named in his honor is Juan Bautista Circle in the Parkmerced development in San Francisco.\nOther places using just the name Anza in his honor include: Anza Vista Avenue within the Anza Vista neighborhood of San Francisco, Anza Street in that city's Richmond District, Lake Anza in Tilden Regional Park above Berkeley in the Berkeley Hills, Anza Avenue and Anza Elementary School in Torrance, and De Anza Way in Palm Desert.\nThe town of Anza, California is a mountainous town with around 7,000 people in Riverside County along State Route 371 between Aguanga and the Santa Rosa Mountains south of Palm Springs. The town is located on the historic route of de Anza's 1774 expedition.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Together, \"digital media\" refers to mediums of digitized information broadcast through a screen and/or a speaker. This also includes text, audio, video, and graphics are transmitted over the internet for consumption on digital devices.\nDigital media platforms, such as YouTube, Kick, and Twitch, accounted for viewership rates of 27.9 billion hours in 2020. A contributing factor to its part in what is commonly referred to as \"the digital revolution\" can be attributed to the use of interconnectivity.\nExamples.\nExamples of digital media include software, digital images,web pages and websites, social media, digital data and databases, digital audio such as MP3, electronic documents and electronic books. Digital media often contrasts with print media, such as printed books, newspapers and magazines, and other traditional or analog media, such as photographic film, audio tapes or video tapes.\nDigital media has had a significantly broad and complex impact on society and culture. Combined with the Internet and personal computing, digital media has caused disruptive innovation in publishing, journalism, public relations, entertainment, education, commerce and politics. Digital media has also posed new challenges to copyright and intellectual property laws, fostering an open content movement in which content creators voluntarily give up some or all of their legal rights to their work. The ubiquity of digital media and its effects on society suggest that we are at the start of a new era in industrial history, called the Information Age, perhaps leading to a paperless society in which all media are produced and consumed on computers. However, challenges to a digital transition remain, including outdated copyright laws, censorship, the digital divide, and the spectre of a digital dark age, in which older media becomes inaccessible to new or upgraded information systems. Digital media has a significant, wide-ranging and complex impact on society and culture.\nBusiness model.\nDigital media platforms like YouTube work through a triple-product business model in which platforms provide information and entertainment (infotainment) to the public often at no cost, while simultaneously capturing their attention, and also collecting user data to sell to advertisers. This business model aims to maximize consumer engagement on the platform. \nPaid media refers to promotional channels that marketers pay to use, including traditional media (e.g., television, radio, print, or outdoor advertising), online and digital media (e.g., paid search ads, web and social media display ads, mobile ads, or email marketing). This model compels businesses to develop sponsored media then pay social media platforms like Instagram for the right to show such media to customers in the platforms' newsfeeds. These customers become exposed to paid media, sometimes referred to as promoted or sponsored posts.\nOwned media refers to digital assets and channels that a company or individual controls and manages. This includes websites, social media profiles for example Facebook etc., blogs, and any other content platforms own and operated by the entity. An entity refers to the owner or controller of the channel, such as a business or individual managing their online presence.\nEarned media denotes public relations media channels like television, newspapers, blogs, or video sites that do not require direct payment or control by marketers but are included because viewers, readers, or users are interested in them. Free media is essentially online word of mouth, typically in \"viral\" trends, mentions, shares, retweets, reviews, recommendations, or content from third-party websites. When one's product or service is so good that users cannot help but post it on their social media, they get a lot of \"earned media\". They win the credibility of the media compared to other forms of credibility, becoming more transparent.\nHistory.\nCodes and information by machines were first conceptualized by Charles Babbage in the early 1800s. Babbage imagined that these codes would give him instructions for his Motor of Difference and Analytical Engine, machines that Babbage had designed to solve the problem of error in calculations. Between 1822 and 1823, the mathematician Ada Lovelace wrote the first instructions for calculating numbers on Babbage engines. Lovelace's instructions are now believed to be the first computer program. Although the machines were designed to perform analysis tasks, Lovelace anticipated the possible social impact of computers and program writing. \"For in the distribution and combination of truths and formulas of analysis, which may become easier and more quickly subjected to the mechanical combinations of the engine, the relationships and the nature of many subjects in which science necessarily relates in new subjects, and more deeply researched [\u2026] there are in all extensions of human power or additions to human knowledge, various collateral influences, in addition to the primary and primary object reached.\" Other old machine readable media include instructions for pianolas and weaving machines.\nIt is estimated that in the year 1986 less than 1% of the world's media storage capacity was digital and in 2007 it was already 94%. The year 2002 is assumed to be the year when human kind was able to store more information in digital than in analog media (the \"beginning of the digital age\").\nDigital computers.\nThough they used machine-readable media, Babbage's engines, player pianos, jacquard looms and many other early calculating machines were themselves analog computers, with physical, mechanical parts. The first truly digital media came into existence with the rise of digital computers. Digital computers use binary code and Boolean logic to store and process information, allowing one machine in one configuration to perform many different tasks. The first modern, programmable, digital computers, the Manchester Mark 1 and the EDSAC, were independently invented between 1948 and 1949. Though different in many ways from modern computers, these machines had digital software controlling their logical operations. They were encoded in binary, a system of ones and zeroes that are combined to make hundreds of characters. The 1s and 0s of binary are the \"digits\" of digital media.\n\"As We May Think\".\nWhile digital media did not come into common use until the late 20th century, the \"conceptual\" foundation of digital media is traced to the work of scientist and engineer Vannevar Bush and his celebrated essay \"As We May Think\", published in \"The Atlantic Monthly\" in 1945. Bush envisioned a system of devices that could be used to help scientists, doctors, and historians, among others, to store, analyze and communicate information. Calling this then-imaginary device a \"memex\", Bush wrote:\nThe owner of the memex, let us say, is interested in the origin and properties of the bow and arrow. Specifically, he is studying why the short Turkish bow was apparently superior to the English long bow in the skirmishes of the Crusades. He has dozens of possibly pertinent books and articles in his memex. First, he runs through an encyclopedia, finds an interesting but sketchy article, and leaves it projected. Next, in history, he finds another pertinent item and ties the two together. Thus he goes, building a trail of many items. Occasionally he inserts a comment of his own, either linking it into the main trail or joining it by a side trail to a particular item. When it becomes evident that the elastic properties of available materials had a great deal to do with the bow, he branches off on a side trail which takes him through textbooks on elasticity and tables of physical constants. He inserts a page of longhand analysis of his own. Thus he builds a trail of his interest through the maze of materials available to him.\nBush hoped that the creation of this memex would be the work of scientists after World War II. Though the essay predated digital computers by several years, \"As We May Think\" anticipated the potential social and intellectual benefits of digital media and provided the conceptual framework for digital scholarship, the World Wide Web, wikis and even social media. It was recognized as a significant work even at the time of its publication.\nImpact.\nThe digital revolution.\nSince the 1960s, computing power and storage capacity have increased exponentially, largely as a result of MOSFET scaling which enables MOS transistor counts to increase at a rapid pace predicted by Moore's law. Personal computers and smartphones put the ability to access, modify, store and share digital media in the hands of billions of people. Many electronic devices, from digital cameras to drones have the ability to create, transmit and view digital media. Combined with the World Wide Web and the Internet, digital media has transformed 21st century society in a way that is frequently compared to the cultural, economic and social impact of the printing press. The change has been so rapid and so widespread that it has launched an economic transition from an industrial economy to an information-based economy, creating a new period in human history known as the Information Age or the digital revolution.\nThe transition has created some uncertainty about definitions. Digital media, new media, multimedia, and similar terms all have a relationship to both the engineering innovations and cultural impact of digital media. The blending of digital media with other media, and with cultural and social factors, is sometimes known as new media or \"the new media.\" Similarly, digital media seems to demand a new set of communications skills, called transliteracy, media literacy, or digital literacy. These skills include not only the ability to read and write\u2014traditional literacy\u2014but the ability to navigate the Internet, evaluate sources, and create digital content. The idea that we are moving toward a fully digital, paperless society is accompanied by the fear that we may soon\u2014or currently\u2014be facing a digital dark age, in which older media are no longer accessible on modern devices or using modern methods of scholarship. Digital media has a significant, wide-ranging and complex effect on society and culture.\nA senior engineer at Motorola named Martin Cooper was the first person to make a phone call on April 3, 1973. He decided the first phone call should be to a rival telecommunications company saying \"I'm speaking via a mobile phone\". Ten years later, Motorola released the Motorola DynaTAC, the first commercially available mobile phone. In the early 1990s Nokia released the Nokia 1011, the first mass-produced mobile phone. The number of smartphone users has increased dramatically, as has the commercial landscape. Android and iOS dominate the smartphone market. A study by Gartner found that in 2016 about 88% of the worldwide smartphones were Android while iOS had a market share of about 12%. About 85% of the mobile market revenue came from mobile games.\nThe impact of the digital revolution can also be assessed by exploring the amount of worldwide mobile smart device users there are. This can be split into 2 categories; smart phone users and smart tablet users. Worldwide there are currently 2.32 billion smartphone users across the world. This figure is to exceed 2.87 billion by 2020. Smart tablet users reached a total of 1 billion in 2015, 15% of the world's population.\nThe statistics evidence the impact of digital media communications today. What is also of relevance is the fact that the number of smart device users is rising rapidly yet the amount of functional uses increase daily. A smartphone or tablet can be used for hundreds of daily needs. There are currently over 1 million apps on the Apple App store. These represent significant opportunities for digital marketing strategies. A smartphone user is impacted with digital advertising every second they open their Apple or Android device. This further evidences the digital revolution and the impact of revolution. This has resulted in a total of 13 billion dollars being paid out to the various app developers over the years. This growth has fueled the development of millions of software applications. Most of these apps are able to generate income via in app advertising. Gross revenue for 2020 is projected to be about $189 million.\nDisruption in industry.\nCompared with print media, the mass media, and other analog technologies, digital media are easy to copy, store, share and modify. This quality of digital media has led to significant changes in many industries, especially journalism, publishing, education, entertainment, and the music business. The overall effect of these changes is so far-reaching that it is difficult to quantify. For example, in movie-making, the transition from analog film cameras to digital cameras is nearly complete. The transition has economic benefits to Hollywood, making distribution easier and making it possible to add high-quality digital effects to films. At the same time, it has affected the analog special effects, stunt, and animation industries in Hollywood. It has imposed painful costs on small movie theaters, some of which did not or will not survive the transition to digital. The effect of digital media on other media industries is similarly sweeping and complex.\nBetween 2000 and 2015, the print newspaper advertising revenue has fallen from $60 billion to a nearly $20 billion. Even one of the most popular days for papers, Sunday, has seen a 9% circulation decrease the lowest since 1945.\nIn journalism, digital media and citizen journalism have led to the loss of thousands of jobs in print media and the bankruptcy of many major newspapers. But the rise of digital journalism has also created thousands of new jobs and specializations. E-books and self-publishing are changing the book industry, and digital textbooks and other media-inclusive curricula are changing primary and secondary education.\nIn academia, digital media has led to a new form of scholarship, also called digital scholarship, making open access and open science possible thanks to the low cost of distribution. New fields of study have grown, such as digital humanities and digital history. It has changed the way libraries are used and their role in society. Every major media, communications and academic endeavor is facing a period of transition and uncertainty related to digital media.\nOften time the magazine or publisher have a Digital edition which can be referred to an electronic formatted version identical to the print version. There is a huge benefit to the publisher and cost, as half of traditional publishers' costs come from production, including raw materials, technical processing, and distribution. \nSince 2004, there has been a decrease in newspaper industry employment, with only about 40,000 people working in the workforce currently. Alliance of Audited Media &amp; Publishers information during the 2008 recession, over 10% of print sales are diminished for certain magazines, with a hardship coming from only 75% of the sales advertisements as before. However, in 2018, major newspapers advertising revenue was 35% from digital ads.\nIn contrast, mobile versions of newspapers and magazines came in second with a huge growth of 135%. The New York Times has noted a 47% year of year rise in their digital subscriptions. 43% of adults get news often from news websites or social media, compared with 49% for television. Pew Research also asked respondents if they got news from a streaming device on their TV \u2013 9% of U.S. adults said that they do so often.\nIndividual as content creator.\nDigital media has also allowed individuals to be much more active in content creation. Anyone with access to computers and the Internet can participate in social media and contribute their own writing, art, videos, photography and commentary to the Internet, as well as conduct business online. The dramatic reduction in the costs required to create and share content have led to a democratization of content creation as well as the creation of new types of content, like blogs, memes, and video essays. Some of these activities have also been labelled citizen journalism. This spike in user-created content is due to the development of the internet as well as the way in which users interact with media today. As more users join and use social media sites, the relevance of content creation increases. The release of technologies such mobile devices allow for easier and quicker access to all things media. Many media creation tools that were once available to only a few are now free and easy to use. The cost of devices that can access the Internet is steadily falling, and personal ownership of multiple digital devices is now becoming the standard. These elements have significantly affected political participation. Digital media is seen by many scholars as having a role in Arab Spring, and crackdowns on the use of digital and social media by embattled governments are increasingly common. Many governments restrict access to digital media in some way, either to prevent obscenity or in a broader form of political censorship.\nOver the years, YouTube has grown to become a website with user generated media. This content is oftentimes not mediated by any company or agency, leading to a wide array of personalities and opinions online. Over the years, YouTube and other platforms have also shown their monetary gains. In 2020, the top 10 highest earning YouTube content creators each generated over 15 million dollars. Many of these YouTube profiles over the years have a multi camera set up as we would see on TV. Many of these creators also establish their own digital companies as their audiences grow. Personal devices have also seen an increase over the years. Over 1.5 billion users of tablets exist in this world right now and that is expected to slowly grow About 20% of people in the world regularly watch their content using tablets in 2018\nUser-generated content raises issues of privacy, credibility, civility and compensation for cultural, intellectual and artistic contributions. The spread of digital media, and the wide range of literacy and communications skills necessary to use it effectively, have deepened the digital divide between those who have access to digital media and those who do not.\nThe rising of digital media has made the consumer's audio collection more precise and personalized. It is no longer necessary to purchase an entire album if the consumer is ultimately interested in only a few audio files.\nWeb-only news.\nThe rise of streaming services has led to a decrease of cable TV services to about 59%, while streaming services are growing at around 29%, and 9% are still users of the digital antenna. TV Controllers now incorporate designated buttons for streaming platforms. Users are spending an average of 1:55 with digital video each day, and only 1:44 on social networks. 6 out of 10 people report viewing their television shows and news via a streaming service. Platforms such as Netflix have gained attraction due to their affordability, accessibility, and for its original content. Companies such as Netflix have even bought previously cancelled shows such as \"Designated Survivor\", \"Lucifer\", and \"Arrested Development\". As the internet becomes more and more prevalent, more companies are beginning to distribute content through internet only means. Indeed, young people today are increasingly likely to use TikTok over Google, television or newspapers for their news. With the loss of viewers, there is a loss of revenue but not as bad as what would be expected.\nAs of 2024 there has also been a wave of those considered too controversial by main-stream media moving over to online platforms such as X (formerly Twitter) to keep spreading their messages. One instance is Tucker Carlson leaving Fox News due to his controversial opinions and moving over to X. This has sparked debate surrounding topics such as free speech and hate speech.\nCopyright challenges.\nDigital media encompasses numerical networks of interactive systems that link databases, allowing users to navigate from one bit of content or webpage to another. Because of this ease, digital media poses several challenges to the current copyright and intellectual property laws. The ease of creating, modifying, and sharing digital media can influence copyright enforcement challenging and many copyright laws are widely seen as outdated. Under current copyright law, common Internet memes are generally illegal to share in many countries. Legal rights can be unclear for many common Internet activities. These include posting pictures from someone else's social media account, writing fanfiction, or covering and/or using popular songs in content such as YouTube videos. During the last decade, the concepts of fair use and copyright have been applied to different types of online media.\nCopyright challenges are spreading to all parts of digital media. Content creators on platforms such as YouTube follow guidelines set by copyright, IP laws, and the platform's copyright requirements. If these guidelines are not followed, the content may get demonetized, deleted, or sued. The situation can also occur when creators accidentally use audio tracks or background scenes that are under copyright. To avoid or resolve some of these issues, content creators can voluntarily adopt open, or copyleft licenses or they can release their work to the public domain. By doing this, creators are giving up certain legal rights regarding their content. Fair use is a doctrine of the US Copyright Law that allows limited use of copyrighted materials without the need to obtain permission. There are four factors that make up fair use. The first, Purpose, refers to what the content is being used for. The second factor is what copyrighted content is being used. If the content is non-fiction, it is more likely to fall under fair use than if the content is fiction. The third factor is how much of the copyrighted content is in use. Small amounts of copyrighted content are more likely to be considered fair. The last factor is, whether the use of copyrighted content earns money or affect the value of the content.\nWikipedia uses some of the most common open licenses, Creative Commons licenses, and the GNU Free Documentation License. Open licenses are one aspect of a broad open content movement that advocates for the reduction or removal of copyright restrictions from software, data, and other digital media. To facilitate the collection and consumption of such licensing information and availability status, tools like the Creative Commons Search engine are used mostly for web images, and Unpaywall, or used for scholarly communication.\nAdditional software has been developed to restrict access to digital media. Digital rights management (DRM) is used to lock material. This allows users to apply the media content to specific cases. DRM allows movie producers to rent at a lower price. This restricts the movie rental license length, rather than only selling the movie at full price. Additionally, DRM can prevent unauthorized modification or sharing of media. \nDigital media copyright protection technologies fall under intellectual property protection technology. This is because a series of computer technologies protect the digital content being created and transmitted. \"The Digital Millennium Copyright Act\" (DMCA) provides safety to intermediaries that host user content, such as YouTube, from being held liable for copyright infringement so long as they meet all required conditions. The most notable of which is the \"notice and take down\" policy. The policy requires online intermediaries to remove and/or disable access to the content in question when there are court orders and/or allegations of illegal use of the content on their site. As a result, YouTube has and continues to develop more policies and standards that go far past what the DMCA requires. YouTube has also created an algorithm which continuously scans their cite to make sure all content follows all policies.\nOne digital media platform known to have copyright concerns is the short video-sharing app TikTok. TikTok is a social media app that allows users to share short videos up to one minute in length, using a variety of visual effects and audio. According to Loyola University's Chicago School of Law, around 50% of the music used on TikTok is unlicensed. TikTok has several music licensing agreements with various artists and labels, creating a library of fair and legal use of music. However, this does not cover all content for its users. A user could still commit a copyright violation on TikTok. One example is, accidentally having music playing on a stereo in the background or recording a laptop screen playing a song.\nOnline magazines or digital magazines are one of the largest targets for copyright issues. According to the Audit Bureau of Circulations report from March 2011, the definition of this medium is when a digital magazine involves the distribution of magazine content by electronic means; it may be a replica. This definition can be considered outdated now that PDF replicas of print magazines are no longer common practice. These days digital magazines refer to magazines specifically created to be interactive digital platforms such as the internet, mobile phones, private networks, iPad, or other devices. The barriers to digital magazine distribution are thus decreasing. However, these platforms are also broadening the scope of where digital magazines can be published; smartphones are an example. Thanks to the improvements in tablets and other personal electronic devices, digital magazines have become much more readable and enticing through the use of graphic art. The evolution of online magazines began to focus on becoming more of a social media and entertainment platform.\nOnline piracy has become one of the larger issues that have occurred concerning digital media copyright. The piracy of digital media, such as film and television, directly impacts the copyright party (the owner of the copyright). This action can impact the \"health\" of the digital media industry. Piracy directly breaks the laws and morals of copyright. Along with piracy, digital media has contributed to the ability to spread false information or fake news. Due to the widespread use of digital media, fake news can receive more notoriety. This notoriety enhances the negative effects fake news creates. As a result, people's health and well-being can directly be affected.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

But as early as 1561 (260 years before Mexican independence), Spanish colonial explorers used ' to refer to C\u00edbola, cities of wealth reported to exist far to the north of the recently conquered Aztec Empire. This name also evoked the Mexica people's accounts of their ancestral origin in Aztl\u00e1n to the north before their migration to Mexico centuries prior. The Nahuatl-language history of the Mexica people, the \"Cr\u00f3nica Mexicayotl\", dated to 1609, makes this identification explicit, describing how the Mexica left \"their home there in Old , which today they call New Mexico ().\"\nGeography.\nNuevo M\u00e9xico was centered on the upper valley of the Rio Grande (R\u00edo Bravo del Norte): from the crossing point of O\u00f1ate on the river south of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, it extended north to the Colorado River, encompassing an area that included most of the present-day American state of New Mexico and sections of Texas, Colorado, Kansas, and the Oklahoma panhandle. Actual Spanish settlements were centered at Santa Fe, and extended north to Taos pueblo and south to Albuquerque (Tiguex). Its provincial capital was in the foothills of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains at the ancient city of La Villa Real de la Santa Fe de San Francisco de As\u00eds (modern-day Santa Fe). At its furthest extent, its reach extended eastward throughout the Llano Estacado due to early exploration by Francisco V\u00e1zquez de Coronado, and westward into Las Vegas Springs due to Antonio Armijo's later expeditions. Its outposts were widespread, throughout what is now the Southwestern United States. From the time of Camino Real de Tierra Adentro, which eventually connected to the Old Spanish Trail, Santa Fe Trail, and the subsequent Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway.\nHistory.\nSpanish colonial province.\n16th century.\nIn 1536, the legendary explorers \u00c1lvar N\u00fa\u00f1ez Cabeza de Vaca and Estevanico, and two other men, survived an ill-fated expedition known as the Narv\u00e1ez expedition. For 8 years they wandered across what is today northern Mexico and the Southwest United States. In 1539, Fray Marcos de Niza led an expedition north from Mexico City. He caught glimpse of a Zuni town in the distance, probably Hawikuh, and returned to Mexico City claiming it might have been one of the fabled Seven Cities of Gold. The disappearance of Estevanico in the region prompted future expeditions to be more heavily armed, and far more cautious. 1540-1542 with Marcos de Niza's tales in mind, Francisco V\u00e1zquez de Coronado began the most ambitious expedition. Fears caused by rumors surrounding Estevanico's disappearance eventually led to tensions underlying the Tiguex War. In two years, the Coronado expedition journeyed from present-day Mexico throughout the Southwest United States and as far east as Kansas.\nIn 1581-1582, Fray Augustin Rodriguez, two other friars, and a few soldiers and servants walked across much of present-day New Mexico seeking converts.\nIn 1590-1591, an order had arrived from Spain requiring all expeditions to be authorized by the crown. However, Lieutenant Governor Gaspar Castano de Sosa of Nuevo Leon launched an expedition on his own authority. He planned to start a colony in New Mexico and persuade the viceroy to accept it after the fact. Pursued through New Mexico, he was arrested and taken back to Mexico City.\nOn July 12, 1598, Don Juan de O\u00f1ate Salazar established the New Spain colony of \"Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9jico\" at the new village of San Juan de los Caballeros adjacent to the Ohkay Owingeh Pueblo at the confluence of the R\u00edo Bravo (Rio Grande) and the R\u00edo Chama. The expedition had been authorized by Philip II to survey the region. Though the Spanish believed that cities of gold such as Tenochtitlan of the Aztecs, whom they had previously conquered, lay to the north in the unexplored territory, the major goal was to spread Catholicism. Other expeditions had taken place before O\u00f1ate's 1598 expedition. He was unable to find any riches, however. As governor, he mingled with the Pueblo people and was responsible for the establishment of Spanish rule in the area. O\u00f1ate served as the first governor of the Nuevo M\u00e9xico Province from 1598 to 1610. He hoped to make it a separate viceroyalty from New Spain in an original agreement made in 1595, but the terms failed when the Viceroy changed hands in 1596. After a two-year delay and lengthy vetting by the new viceroy, O\u00f1ate was finally allowed to cross the Rio Grande River into modern-day Texas and New Mexico.\n17th century.\nMost of the Spanish missions in Nuevo M\u00e9xico were established during the early 17th century with varying degrees of success and failure, oftentimes building directly atop ancient pueblo ruins, and in the centers of pueblos. The encounter between different worlds\u2014Native and Spanish\u2014took place all across New Mexico, but especially at the missions. They were small communities, centers of Spanish religious and economic life, and a permanent intrusion into Pueblo ways and beliefs. Here the clash of faiths, customs, and people was immediate, personal, and sometimes bitter and violent. At missions across New Mexico, Franciscan priests baptized thousands of Native Americans in the 1600s, mostly Pueblo people. The missionaries commanded new converts to take part in Catholic services and rituals. They also destroyed Pueblo religious objects, banned ceremonies, and persecuted holy men. Despite the spread of Catholicism across the province, Pueblo men and women worshiped in secret and their traditional faith endured. By 1668, Juan de Medrano y Mes\u00eda became governor of the province, holding this position until 1671. His tenure was marked most notably by Apache raids in the region.\nSome pueblos were friendly to the foreigners, but after cultural differences and the banishment of local religions, tensions against the Spanish rose significantly. After compounding misdeeds and overbearing taxes by the Spanish invaders, the indigenous communities rebelled in what is now referred to as the Pueblo Revolt of 1680. This rebellion saw the Spanish expelled from Nuevo M\u00e9xico for a period of 12 years, and the pueblo people were able to regain lost lands. In 1692, they returned to battle against the Spanish, who sought restoration of the conquered holdings. Diego de Vargas achieved the reoccupation of Santa Fe. The province came under the jurisdiction of the \"Real Audiencia de Guadalajara\", with oversight by the Viceroy of New Spain at Mexico City.\n18th century.\nIn 1777, with the creation of the Commandancy General of the Provincias Internas, the Nuevo M\u00e9xico Province was removed from the oversight of the Viceroy and placed solely in the jurisdiction of the new commandant general. This caused much unrest, due to the sudden lack of representation in Santa Fe for the region of Nuevo M\u00e9xico.\nMexican territory.\nThe province remained in Spanish control until Mexico's declaration of independence in 1821. Under the 1824 Constitution of Mexico, it became the federally administered Territory of New Mexico.\nThe Old Spanish Trail was expanded in 1829, merchant Antonio Armijo expanded the traderoutes of Nuevo M\u00e9xico to reach the Mormon Road and The Californias out west. Their original campsite is now located about 300 feet below the surface of Lake Mead. Armijo's scout Raphael Rivera found Las Vegas Springs, at what is today Las Vegas, Nevada, and it became the furthest western outpost for Nuevo M\u00e9xico. The governor of New Mexico, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Chaves, published the report on June 19, 1830.\nThe part of the former province east of the Rio Grande was claimed by the Republic of Texas, which won its independence in 1836. This claim was disputed by Mexico. In 1841, the Texans sent the Texan Santa Fe Expedition, ostensibly for trade but with hopes of occupying the claimed area, but the expedition was captured by New Mexican troops under New Mexico governor Manuel Armijo.\nAmerican territory.\nThe United States inherited the unenforced claim to the east bank with the Texas Annexation in 1845. The U.S. Army under Stephen Kearny occupied the territory in 1846 during the Mexican\u2013American War, a provisional government was established, and Mexico recognized its loss to the United States in 1848 with the Mexican Cession in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.\nTexas continued to claim the eastern part of the region. However, as part of the Compromise of 1850, Texas accepted $10 million in exchange for relinquishing its claims to areas within and north of the present boundaries of New Mexico and the Texas Panhandle. The compromise also granted Texas control of El Paso, while recognizing the establishment of the New Mexico Territory, based in part on trade routes such as Camino Real de Tierra Adentro, Santa Fe Trail, and Old Spanish Trail through the Las Vegas Valley and into what is now Arizona and New Mexico itself. In 1855, the Old Mormon Fort was established in the Las Vegas Valley, in what is now Clark County, Nevada. These developments also contributed to New Mexico securing water rights to the Rio Grande and Colorado River, allowing the territory and its subsequent states to fill their reservoir lakes.\nPresidents Zachary Taylor and Abraham Lincoln both proposed that New Mexico immediately become a state to sidestep political conflict over slavery in the territories. The already established rule of law which had passed from New Spain and Mexico within New Mexico already outlawed slavery, as was the legal precedent with gen\u00edzaros.\nNew Mexico became an official U.S. state in 1912.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "53727", "revid": "698799", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53727", "title": "Stiff Records", "text": "British record label\nStiff Records is a British independent record label formed in London by Dave Robinson and Jake Riviera. Originally active from 1976 to 1986, the label was reactivated in 2007.\nEstablished at the outset of the punk rock boom, Stiff signed various punk rock and new wave acts such as Nick Lowe, the Damned, Lene Lovich, Wreckless Eric, Elvis Costello, Ian Dury, and Devo, also signing artists with significant crossover appeal such as Mot\u00f6rhead, Larry Wallis and Mick Farren. In the 1980s, with most of their early signings having moved on, the label found commercial success with Madness, The Pogues, Tracey Ullman, The Belle Stars, Kirsty MacColl and others.\nIn December 2017, Universal Music Group acquired Stiff Records and ZTT Records. Razor &amp; Tie, a division of the Concord Music Group, holds the American rights to the Stiff catalogue. The British rights to the Stiff catalogue were held by BMG Rights Management under Union Square Music until 2022, when Universal relaunched the Stiff and ZTT labels.\nHistory.\nRobinson and Riviera were well-known London music business characters. Robinson had briefly worked for Jimi Hendrix in the late 1960s and also managed minor pub rock band Brinsley Schwarz in the early 1970s, in which Nick Lowe was the bassist, vocalist and main songwriter; while Riviera had been an early manager for another pub rock band, Dr. Feelgood, from Essex. The label was started with a loan of \u00a3400 from Lee Brilleaux of Dr. Feelgood.\nOriginally, Stiff had been called Demon, but the phrase \"It\u2019s a stiff!\" was more appropriate for the artists on the record label. Stiff found quick success. Its first release, on 14 August 1976, was a single (in the normal 7\" vinyl 45 rpm format) by Nick Lowe, \"So It Goes\", B-side \"Heart of the City\",&gt; with the striking catalogue number BUY 1. That record sold 10,000 copies, but Stiff's next release, \"Between The Lines\" by Pink Fairies, sold only around half of that. Robinson and Riviera used money from their Advancedale management company to finance the release of what is generally accepted as the United Kingdom's first punk single, \"New Rose\" by The Damned, on 22 October 1976.\nEarly in 1977, Stiff Records picked up speed, signing Wreckless Eric, Ian Dury, and Elvis Costello, who had once been a part-time roadie for Brinsley Schwarz. Bigger sales followed, and a distribution deal with Island Records through EMI was set up. After arranging for Costello and Lowe to be signed directly to CBS Records' Columbia label, a similar deal was made with Arista who released Ian Dury's first album and the \"Live Stiffs Live\" album. The deal was short-lived and Stiff then made a deal with CBS Records for Stiff releases in the United States, at both the Columbia and Epic subsidiaries on the Stiff/Columbia and Stiff/Epic labels.\nRobinson and Riviera were a fiery management combination, and after a series of disagreements, Riviera left Stiff in early 1978 to form the short-lived Radar Records, taking Elvis Costello, Nick Lowe and Yachts with him as a settlement package. Riviera's departure coincided with the end of the \"5 Live Stiffs Tour\", which showcased emerging star Ian Dury. Dury's album \"New Boots &amp; Panties!!\" had raced up the charts and its sales kept the label in business over the following months. In 1979, Robinson signed Madness, who released albums from 1979 to 1984.\nThe next few years were the halcyon period, with many Top 20 single chart placings, including the label's first No. 1 single, \"Hit Me with Your Rhythm Stick\" by Ian Dury, and a number of other big-selling albums. Stiff expanded rapidly and moved its premises twice. It also continued to release dozens of obscure and uncommercial releases. For example, Stiff Records released the parody album \"The Wit &amp; Wisdom of Ronald Reagan\". That LP, on Magic Records, was completely silent on both sides, with Reagan's own slogan, \"If it's a success it must be Magic!\".\nAt the end of 1983, Island Records bought 50% of Stiff, and Robinson ran both labels. Island was short of money at the time and Robinson had to lend it \u00a31,000,000 to fund the share purchase and pay the payroll. In 1984 Island Records released hit single \"Relax\" by Frankie Goes to Hollywood. Stiff signed The Pogues, but then Madness left to start their own label, Zarjazz. The Island deal failed and Dave Robinson regained control of the newly independent label in 1985. Hits by The Pogues and Furniture helped Stiff to survive another twenty months, but the underlying causes for the failure of the Island deal finally became too burdensome for Stiff. It was sold to ZTT in 1987.\nIn 2007, ZTT and its parent company SPZ Group reactivated the label. Stiff quickly broke one of the UK's hottest new indie acts, The Enemy. It then released a string of well-received albums of new work from legacy Stiff artists, including as Wreckless Eric, Henry Priestman, Any Trouble, and Chris Difford. Brand new acts signed to the label included The Tranzmitors and Eskimo Disco. Swedish designer Tobbe Stuhre was appointed official Stiff Records designer.\nIn 2008, Union Square Music released \"The Big Stiff Box Set\".\nThe Stiffs Tours.\nRobinson and Riviera had arranged package tours \u2012 such as the 1975 \"Naughty Rhythms\" tour \u2012 for acts they managed before forming Stiff. The first tour, known as the \"Live Stiffs Tour\" or \"5 Live Stiffs\" (3 October \u2013 5 November 1977), comprised five bands: Elvis Costello and The Attractions, Ian Dury and the Blockheads, Wreckless Eric and The New Rockets, Nick Lowe's Last Chicken in the Shop, and Larry Wallis's Psychedelic Rowdies. Having signed all the named artists as individuals, bands had to be formed in order to tour: these were largely based on the session musicians used for the artists' solo records. There were 18 musicians on the tour, several doubling up, e.g. Dury playing drums for Wreckless Eric while the last two \"bands\" had the same line up (Nick Lowe, Larry Wallis, Dave Edmunds, Terry Williams, Pete Thomas and Penny Tobin).\nThe original idea was that the running order would rotate each night, but Dury and Costello were clearly the strongest acts. Costello played mostly new material and cover versions, rather than numbers from his recently released album \"My Aim is True\", so the gigs usually ended with most of the artists on stage performing Dury's \"Sex &amp; Drugs &amp; Rock &amp; Roll\". A live album entitled \"Live Stiffs Live\" and a video of the tour were produced, but the tour only covered the UK.\nAfter the departure of Riviera, Robinson arranged a second tour, the \"Be Stiff\" or the \"Be Stiff Route 78\" tour, from October to November 1978 (UK), again comprising five acts; Wreckless Eric, Lene Lovich, Jona Lewie, Mickey Jupp, and Rachel Sweet. The mainland section of the UK tour was undertaken by train and the Irish section by coach, and then continued on to the USA without Jupp, who was afraid of flying. The artists contributed to an EP with cover versions of the Devo song, and early Stiff single, \"Be Stiff\".\nThe final tour, the \"Son of Stiff Tour 1980\", comprised Ten Pole Tudor, Any Trouble, Dirty Looks, Joe \"King\" Carrasco and the Crowns, and The Equators. Undertaken by bus, this European tour was not successful. The tour led to a 12\" EP \"Son of Stiff Tour 1980\" (SON 1) and a short movie directed by Jeff Baynes. The movie has not been released for sale, but was shown on BBC4 in September 2006.\nMarketing and design.\nThe label's marketing and advertising was often provocative and witty, billing itself as \"The World's Most Flexible Record Label\". Other slogans were \"We came. We saw. We left\", \"If It Ain't Stiff, It Ain't Worth a Fuck\", and \"When You Kill Time, You Murder Success\" (printed on promotional wall clocks). On the label of Stiff's sampler compilation \"Heroes &amp; Cowards\" was printed: \"In '78 everyone born in '45 will be 33-1/3\". A very early Stiff sampler album, \"A Bunch of Stiff Records\", introduced the slogan, \"If they're dead, we'll sign them\" and \"Undertakers to the Industry\".\nStiff also produced eccentric but highly effective promotional campaigns, such as the three package tours in 1977 (Live Stiffs), 1978 (Be Stiff) and 1980 (Son of Stiff), Elvis Costello's \"street performance\" outside CBS Records.\nBarney Bubbles was responsible for much of the graphic art associated with the early Stiff releases.\nLabel artists.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

IEEE 754 specifies additional floating-point formats, including 32-bit base-2 \"single precision\" and, more recently, base-10 representations (decimal floating point).\nOne of the first programming languages to provide floating-point data types was Fortran. Before the widespread adoption of IEEE 754-1985, the representation and properties of floating-point data types depended on the computer manufacturer and computer model, and upon decisions made by programming-language implementers. E.g., GW-BASIC's double-precision data type was the 64-bit MBF floating-point format.\nIEEE 754 double-precision binary floating-point format: binary64.\nDouble-precision binary floating-point is a commonly used format on PCs, due to its wider range over single-precision floating point, in spite of its performance and bandwidth cost. It is commonly known simply as \"double\". The IEEE 754 standard specifies a binary64 as having:\nThe sign bit determines the sign of the number (including when this number is zero, which is signed).\nThe exponent field is an 11-bit unsigned integer from 0 to 2047, in biased form: an exponent value of 1023 represents the actual zero. Exponents range from \u22121022 to +1023 because exponents of \u22121023 (all 0s) and +1024 (all 1s) are reserved for special numbers.\nThe 53-bit significand precision gives from 15 to 17 significant decimal digits precision (2\u221253\u00a0\u2248\u00a01.11\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221216). If a decimal string with at most 15 significant digits is converted to the IEEE 754 double-precision format, giving a normal number, and then converted back to a decimal string with the same number of digits, the final result should match the original string. If an IEEE 754 double-precision number is converted to a decimal string with at least 17 significant digits, and then converted back to double-precision representation, the final result must match the original number.\nThe format is written with the significand having an implicit integer bit of value 1 (except for special data, see the exponent encoding below). With the 52 bits of the fraction (F) significand appearing in the memory format, the total precision is therefore 53 bits (approximately 16 decimal digits, 53 log10(2) \u2248 15.955). The bits are laid out as follows:\nThe real value assumed by a given 64-bit double-precision datum with a given biased exponent formula_1 \nand a 52-bit fraction is\n formula_2\nor\n formula_3\nBetween 252=4,503,599,627,370,496 and 253=9,007,199,254,740,992 the representable numbers are exactly the integers. For the next range, from 253 to 254, everything is multiplied by 2, so the representable numbers are the even ones, etc. Conversely, for the previous range from 251 to 252, the spacing is 0.5, etc.\nThe spacing as a fraction of the numbers in the range from 2\"n\" to 2\"n\"+1 is 2\"n\"\u221252.\nThe maximum relative rounding error when rounding a number to the nearest representable one (the machine epsilon) is therefore 2\u221253.\nThe 11 bit width of the exponent allows the representation of numbers between 10\u2212308 and 10308, with full 15\u201317 decimal digits precision.

Most processors, such as the x86 family and the ARM family processors, use the most significant bit of the significand field to indicate a quiet NaN; this is what is recommended by IEEE 754. The PA-RISC processors use the bit to indicate a signaling NaN.\nBy default, 1/3 rounds down, instead of up like single precision, because of the odd number of bits in the significand.\nIn more detail:\n Given the hexadecimal representation 3FD5 5555 5555 555516,\n Sign = 0\n Exponent = 3FD16 = 1021\n Exponent Bias = 1023 (constant value; see above)\n Fraction = 5 5555 5555 555516\n Value = 2(Exponent \u2212 Exponent Bias) \u00d7 1.Fraction \u2013 Note that Fraction must not be converted to decimal here\n = 2\u22122 \u00d7 (15 5555 5555 555516 \u00d7 2\u221252)\n = 2\u221254 \u00d7 15 5555 5555 555516\n = 0.333333333333333314829616256247390992939472198486328125\n \u2248 1/3\nExecution speed with double-precision arithmetic.\nUsing double-precision floating-point variables is usually slower than working with their single precision counterparts. One area of computing where this is a particular issue is parallel code running on GPUs. For example, when using Nvidia's CUDA platform, calculations with double precision can take, depending on hardware, from 2 to 32 times as long to complete compared to those done using single precision.\nAdditionally, many mathematical functions (e.g., sin, cos, atan2, log, exp and sqrt) need more computations to give accurate double-precision results, and are therefore slower.\nImplementations.\nDoubles are implemented in many programming languages in different ways. On processors with only dynamic precision, such as x86 without SSE2 (or when SSE2 is not used, for compatibility purpose) and with extended precision used by default, software may have difficulties to fulfill some requirements.\nC and C++.\nC and C++ offer a wide variety of arithmetic types. Double precision is not required by the standards (except by the optional annex F of C99, covering IEEE 754 arithmetic), but on most systems, the codice_7 type corresponds to double precision. However, on 32-bit x86 with extended precision by default, some compilers may not conform to the C standard or the arithmetic may suffer from double rounding.\nFortran.\nFortran provides several integer and real types, and the 64-bit type codice_8, accessible via Fortran's intrinsic module codice_9, corresponds to double precision.\nCommon Lisp.\nCommon Lisp provides the types SHORT-FLOAT, SINGLE-FLOAT, DOUBLE-FLOAT and LONG-FLOAT. Most implementations provide SINGLE-FLOATs and DOUBLE-FLOATs with the other types appropriate synonyms. Common Lisp provides exceptions for catching floating-point underflows and overflows, and the inexact floating-point exception, as per IEEE 754. No infinities and NaNs are described in the ANSI standard, however, several implementations do provide these as extensions.\nJava.\nOn Java before version 1.2, every implementation had to be IEEE 754 compliant. Version 1.2 allowed implementations to bring extra precision in intermediate computations for platforms like x87. Thus a modifier strictfp was introduced to enforce strict IEEE 754 computations. Strict floating point has been restored in Java\u00a017.\nJavaScript.\nAs specified by the ECMAScript standard, all arithmetic in JavaScript shall be done using double-precision floating-point arithmetic.\nJSON.\nThe JSON data encoding format supports numeric values, and the grammar to which numeric expressions must conform has no limits on the precision or range of the numbers so encoded. However, RFC 8259 advises that, since IEEE 754 binary64 numbers are widely implemented, good interoperability can be achieved by implementations processing JSON if they expect no more precision or range than binary64 offers.\nRust and Zig.\nRust and Zig have the codice_10 data type.\nNotes and references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He gained recognition for his portrayal of Anakin Skywalker / Darth Vader in the \"Star Wars\" media franchise. He first appeared in the prequel trilogy films, ' (2002) and ' (2005), and later reprised his role in the Disney+ series \"Obi-Wan Kenobi\" (2022) and \"\" (2023).\nChristensen began his career on Canadian television at the age of 13, then diversified into American television in the late 1990s. His early work includes \"The Virgin Suicides\" (1999), \"Life as a House\" (2001), and \"Shattered Glass\" (2003). He earned praise for his performances as Sam in \"Life as a House\" and as Stephen Glass in \"Shattered Glass\". Christensen's honours include the nominations for a Golden Globe Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award, as well as the Cannes Film Festival's Troph\u00e9e Chopard. His other notable works include \"Awake\" (2007), \"Jumper\" (2008), \"Takers\" (2010), and \"Little Italy\" (2018).\nEarly life.\nChristensen was born in Vancouver, British Columbia to Alie, an American speechwriter, and David Christensen, a Canadian computer programmer and communications executive. His father is of Danish descent, and his mother has Swedish and Italian ancestry. Christensen is one of four children, with three actor siblings: older brother Tove, older sister Hejsa, and younger sister Kaylen. He spent summers on Long Island with his maternal grandmother, Rose Schwartz.\nChristensen attended Unionville High School in Markham, Ontario. He was an athlete in high school, playing hockey competitively and tennis on a provincial level. He attended the Actors Studio in New York City; he studied as well at the Arts York drama program in high school. After accompanying his older sister to her agent's office after she landed a role in a Pringles commercial, he began being cast in commercials as well, including for Triaminic cough syrup in 1988.\nCareer.\n1993\u20132005: Early work.\nChristensen made his acting debut in September 1993, when, at the age of 12, he played a supporting role on the German-Canadian television series \"Macht Der Leidenschaft/Family Passions.\" The following year, he had a minor role in John Carpenter's \"In the Mouth of Madness\". From 1995 through 1999, he appeared in several films and television series, including \"Harrison Bergeron\", \"Forever Knight\", \"Goosebumps\", \"The Virgin Suicides\", and \"Are You Afraid of the Dark?\"\nHe acquired wider notice while starring in Fox Family Channel's television series \"Higher Ground\" in 2000, portraying a teen who was sexually molested by his stepmother, and then turned to drugs in his despair.\nChristensen's critically acclaimed portrayal of a misunderstood teenager in \"Life as a House\" (2001) earned him Golden Globe and SAG Award nominations, as well as the National Board of Review's award for \"Breakthrough Performance of the Year\". However, the performance did not receive widespread public notice. In 2002, Christensen made his London theatre debut with Jake Gyllenhaal and Anna Paquin in \"This Is Our Youth\".\nHe went on to receive positive reviews for 2003's \"Shattered Glass\", which tells the true story of journalist Stephen Glass, who was discovered to be fabricating stories as a writer for \"The New Republic\" and other publications. Peter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\" wrote, \"Hayden Christensen is sensational as Glass, finding the wonder boy and the weasel in a disturbed kid flying high on a fame he hasn't earned.\" In 2005, Christensen made his Broadway debut when he appeared briefly in a 10-minute play.\nIn 2005, he took part in the fifth annual \"24 Hour Plays\" benefit, which raises cash for nonprofit groups in the Big Apple.\n2000-2005: \"Star Wars\" prequel trilogy.\nOn May 12, 2000, Christensen announced that he would be starring as an adult Anakin Skywalker in ' (2002) and ' (2005); Skywalker was previously portrayed by Jake Lloyd as a child in \"\" (1999). The casting director reviewed about 1,500 other candidates before director George Lucas selected Christensen. Lucas is quoted as saying that he chose Christensen because he \"needed an actor who has that presence of the Dark Side\". This was essential to solidify the story that Lucas was trying to tell: Anakin Skywalker's fall from grace and transformation into Darth Vader. \nChristensen admitted to \"Star Wars Insider\" in 2005, that he found it difficult bridging the gap between Jake Lloyd's Anakin as an innocent boy and the villain, Vader was introduced as in the original trilogy. While his co-star, Ewan McGregor had Alec Guinness to emulate, Christensen had no one to emulate. He said, \"Ultimately, I had to be the linear connection between the Anakin that Jake Lloyd played, and capture Darth Vader as portrayed by Sebastian Shaw when he was demasked in \"Return of the Jedi\".\"\nDuring the production of \"Revenge of the Sith\", Christensen asked Lucas if a special Vader suit could be constructed to fit his own body, rather than have a different actor don one of the original sets of Vader armour worn by David Prowse. Lucas agreed, and a suit was engineered to fit Christensen's frame, even including extensions to allow for the actor to attain Vader's height. His voice as the \"robotic\" Vader, however, was dubbed over by James Earl Jones, who first made the voice famous in the original trilogy.\nIn one of the most controversial changes made to the \"Star Wars\" original trilogy, Christensen was inserted into the 2004 DVD release of \"Return of the Jedi\", where he replaced Sebastian Shaw as the force ghost of the redeemed Anakin Skywalker. Lucas wanted Anakin's inner person to return to who he was before he turned to the dark side. Christensen insisted this was done without his knowledge, an act that was confirmed by Lucasfilm itself in the featurette \"Return of the Jedi: What has changed?\" as seen on the official website to commemorate the 2006 DVDs.\nChristensen's performance in both ' and ' received generally mixed reviews from critics, although contemporary reviews note that his performance was mostly affected by Lucas' directing and the dialogue, and has since seen positive reappraisal in retrospect. In his 2019 memoirs, C-3PO actor Anthony Daniels praised Christensen and McGregor for their lightsaber duel in \"Revenge of Sith\" describing them as \"marvellous.\" In 2022, when reflecting on the prequel trilogy and the reappraisal, Christensen said, \u201cIt\u2019s like those films had a gestation period, where they needed a little time to ferment in the public psyche. The reception that the films have now, it\u2019s very heartwarming.\u201d \nChristensen was named in both \"People\" magazine's 50 Most Beautiful People and \"Teen People\"'s 25 Hottest Stars under 25. For his performance in \"Episode III\", he won the MTV Movie Award for Best Villain.\n2006\u20132018: Further work, films and television.\nBetween 2006 and 2007, he starred in \"Awake\", with Jessica Alba, which tells the story of a man who remains awake but paralyzed during heart surgery, and co-starred in \"Factory Girl\", opposite Sienna Miller and Guy Pearce. Christensen next co-starred with Samuel L. Jackson, Jamie Bell, and Rachel Bilson in the film \"Jumper\", the story of a young man who discovers he has the ability to teleport; the film was released on February 14, 2008. Bilson and Christensen co-starred again in the same segment of the film \"New York, I Love You\". Christensen appeared opposite Mischa Barton in \"Virgin Territory\", which was released directly-to-DVD in North America on August 26, 2008. The film, based on \"The Decameron\", is about a group of people who escape the Black Plague epidemic by hiding out in a Tuscan villa in Italy.\nIn October 2009, Christensen started shooting the horror film \"Vanishing on 7th Street\", directed by Brad Anderson, with Thandiwe Newton and John Leguizamo. Christensen appeared in the crime drama \"Takers\" with Idris Elba and Paul Walker, released in the United States on August 27, 2010. \"\" is the fourth film in which Christensen stars with Samuel L. Jackson.\nIn the early 2000s Christensen formed a production company Forest Park Pictures alongside his brother Tove. The company produced two films that Christensen appeared in \"Shattered Glass\" and \"Vanishing on 7th Street.\" In 2010, Christensen sued USA Network over allegations that they stole his idea for the TV show \"Royal Pains\". The suit alleges that Christensen met with USA to pitch a similar series entitled \"Housecalls\". During the meeting, Christensen alleges, he was never informed that a similar program was in development. Although a federal judge at first dismissed Christensen's lawsuit in 2011, in June 2012, the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals reversed this decision and remanded the case back to the district court for further proceedings, in what was considered a legal victory for Christensen.\nOn May 20, 2013, during the Cannes Film Festival, the Russian company Enjoy Movies announced the creation of Glacier Films, an alliance company with Christensen and his brother Tove. Over a three-year period, \"Glacier Films\" intended to make 11 \"micro-budget\" movies costing $1.5M each. The first project, \"American Heist\", starring Christensen, Adrien Brody and Jordana Brewster, started filming in June 2013. It is a remake of Steve McQueen's \"The Great St. Louis Bank Robbery.\" In 2014, he starred in the American-Chinese-Canadian film \"Outcast\", an action drama, alongside Nicolas Cage.\nIn 2015, Christensen starred in the film \"90 Minutes in Heaven\" co-starring Kate Bosworth and directed by Michael Polish based on the best-selling novel by the same name. In 2015, filming began of an unreleased World War II Nazi zombies horror movie titled \"Unt\u00f6t\", set to star Christensen. In 2017, he was in the film \"First Kill\" alongside Bruce Willis. In 2018 he appeared in the Canadian-American romantic comedy \"Little Italy\" with Emma Roberts and in the same year was in \"The Last Man\".\n2019-present: Return to the \"Star Wars\" franchise.\nIn 2019, a few years after the Walt Disney Company acquired Lucasfilm, Christensen returned to the role of Anakin Skywalker, providing a voice cameo of the character's voice in '. Although Christensen was not involved in ', he praised the film saying, \"I loved what they did with it. The character predates me, and it's always been a collective effort in a lot of ways. I thought it was brilliant.\"\nChristensen also received a voice credit as Anakin Skywalker jointly alongside Matt Lanter for the penultimate episode of the final season of the animated television series ' entitled \" despite the fact the dialogue used for the episode spoken by Christensen was reused archival audio from '. On October 22, 2021, it was reported that Christensen would also reprise the role for the Disney+ series \".\nIn May 2022, Christensen reprised his role of Anakin Skywalker / Darth Vader for the \"Obi-Wan Kenobi\" limited series on Disney+. His portrayal earned positive reviews from critics, noting a huge improvement from his performance in the prequel trilogy. He appeared in the documentary special \"Obi-Wan Kenobi: A Jedi's Return\" which premiered on September 8, 2022, Disney+ Day. In 2023, Christensen appeared in four episodes of \"Ahsoka\" and was digitally de-aged. He was first seen wearing his outfit from \"Revenge of the Sith\" and later another outfit similar to the one Anakin wore in the early series of \"The Clone Wars\". His portrayal earned more positive reviews. \nOn 19 April 2025, during one of the panels at \"Star Wars\" Celebration Japan, Christensen said that he would reprise his role in the second season of \"Ahsoka\". On 25 April 2025, Christensen and Samuel L. Jackson surprised the audience at a screening of the \"Revenge of the Sith\" 20th anniversary re-release in Los Angeles. Christensen told the audience that he had \"so many amazing memories of making\" \"Revenge of the Sith\". \nHe has been attending several conventions as part of \"Star Wars\" Celebration as a guest since 2017. In April 2019, Christensen met Matt Lanter at \"Star Wars\" Celebration Chicago and said to him, \"I love what you guys are doing. Thanks for keeping \"Star Wars\" alive.\"\nPersonal life.\nIn 2007, Christensen began dating actress Rachel Bilson, with whom he starred in the movie \"Jumper\". They became engaged on December 25, 2008. In mid-2010, they broke up, but began dating again a few months later. On October 29, 2014, Bilson gave birth to their daughter. Christensen and Bilson separated in September 2017.\nIn 2007, Christensen bought a farm near Uxbridge, Ontario. He noted in 2008 that he had been renovating the property himself and devoting time to learning about \"livestock, crops, and agricultural machinery\". His farm also features a vegetable garden and an apple orchard. In November 2013, Christensen collaborated with Canadian fashion chain RW&amp;Co to release a men's clothing line inspired by his farm.

Stating \u201cI guess I felt like I had this great thing in \"Star Wars\" that provided all these opportunities and gave me a career, but it all kind of felt a little too handed to me. I didn\u2019t want to go through life feeling like I was just riding a wave,\u201d he said. He acknowledged that the break would impact his work, but wasn\u2019t bothered by it.
