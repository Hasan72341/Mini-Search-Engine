His novelette \"Shanidar\" won the Writers of the Future contest in 1985 and gave rise to his first novel, \"Neverness\" (1988), a science fiction epic. It was followed by a sequel trilogy called \"A Requiem for Homo Sapiens\" (1992-1998). In 2023 he added a new book to the Neverness universe called \"The Remembrancer's Tale\".\nThe Neverness universe has been hailed as Dune for the 1990s. Human civilization has explored and settled the galaxy using ships that interface a pilot's mind to the mathematical underpinnings of the physical universe. Artificial intelligences live as super-intelligent gods running on clusters of moon-sized computer brains. Humans have modified themselves to create a tapestry of religions and philosophies that interweave with alien cultures to amplify human potential and seek transcendence. The books often employ anthropological and ecological perspectives to examine the nature of consciousness, memory and evolution.\nZindell's fantasy epic \"The Ea Cycle\" (2001-2007) examines the evolution of consciousness through the struggle between good and evil, exploring themes of empathy, morality, war and fate. The plot concerns a prince named Valashu Elahad searching for a relic called the Lightstone to stop the immortal Morjin, Lord of Lies, who seeks to create a world filled with madness.\nIn 2015 he published \"Splendor\", a memoir. In 2017 he published \"The Idiot Gods\", a novel told from the point of view of killer whales, which are sapient. It is the first of the Xanayan series, followed by \"If I Am God\" in 2024 and \"The Woman and the Whale\" in 2025.\nZindell's work has been translated into German, Dutch, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese, Russian and Italian.\nReception and themes.\nJohn Clute wrote that Zindell was a \"romantic, ambitious, and skilled\" writer.\n\"New Scientist\" wrote that: \u2018David Zindell writes of interstellar mathematics in poetic prose that is a joy to read\u2019 and that he presents \u2018A disturbing vision of the impending collapse of a transgalactic society\u2026the ideas are hard SF with philosophical undertones, and the story is compelling. Zindell makes you think\u2019.\nZindell has described his style as an attempt to communicate the connectedness of things, the connection between mysticism and evolution, and the possibilities of life, and his fiction as an attempt to heal false dichotomies such as materialism and spirituality.\nPersonal life.\nZindell was born in Toledo, Ohio, and resides today in Boulder, Colorado, where he works as a test coach; he received a BA in mathematics and minored in anthropology at the University of Colorado at Boulder.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "45232", "revid": "4796325", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45232", "title": "Jonathan Livingston Seagull", "text": "1970 novella by Richard Bach\nJonathan Livingston Seagull is an allegorical fable in novella form written by American author Richard Bach and illustrated with black-and-white photographs shot by Russell Munson. It is about a seagull who is trying to learn about flying, personal reflection, freedom, and self-realization. It was first published in book form in 1970 with little advertising or expectations; by the end of 1972, over a million copies were in print, the book having reached the number-one spot on bestseller lists mostly through word of mouth recommendations.\nIn 2014, the book was reissued as Jonathan Livingston Seagull: The Complete Edition, which added a 17-page fourth part to the story.\nPlot.\nPart One.\nJonathan Livingston Seagull is an independent thinker frustrated with the daily squabbles over meager food and sheer survival within his flock of seagulls who have no deeper sense of purpose. Unlike his peers, he is seized with a passion for flight of all kinds, and his soul soars as he aerially experiments and learns more about the nature of his own body and the environment in achieving faster and faster flights. Eventually, his lack of conformity within the Flock causes them to officially banish him with the label \"Outcast\". Undeterred, Jonathan continues his efforts to reach ever-greater flight goals, finding that he is often successful. He lives a long happy life and is sad not due to his loneliness but only due to the fact that the rest of the Flock will never know the full glories of flying, like him. In his old age, he is met by two radiantly-bright seagulls who share his abilities, explaining to him that he has learned much, but that they have come to take him \"home\" where he will go \"higher\".\nPart Two.\nJonathan transcends into a reality, which he assumes is heaven, where all the gulls enjoy practicing incredible maneuvers and speeds, like him. His instructor, Sullivan, explains that a few gulls progress to this higher existence, but most others live through the same world over and over again. The Elder Gull of the community, Chiang, admits that this reality is not heaven, but that heaven is the achieving of perfection itself: an ability beyond any particular time or place. Suddenly, Chiang disappears, then reappears a moment later, displaying his attainment of perfect speed. When Jonathan begs to learn Chiang's skills, Chiang explains that the secret to true flight is to recognize that one's nature exists across all time and space. Jon begins successfully following Chiang's teachings. One day, Chiang slowly transforms into a blindingly luminous being and, just before disappearing for the last time, he gives Jonathan one last tip: \"keep working on love.\" Jonathan ponders Chiang's words and, in a discussion with Sullivan, decides to go back to his own home planet, to teach his original Flock all that he has learned. Returning there, he finds a fellow lover of flying, Fletcher Lynd Seagull, who is angry at recently being \"Outcast\" by the Flock. Jonathan takes on Fletcher as his first pupil.\nPart Three.\nJonathan has now amassed a small group of Outcasts as flying students, with Fletcher the star pupil, and tells them that \"each of us is in truth... an unlimited idea of freedom\". The deeper nature of his words is not yet understood by his pupils, who believe they are just getting basic flying lessons. For a month, Jonathan boldly takes them to perform aerial stunts in front of the bewildered Flock. Some of the Flock slowly join the Outcasts, while others label him a messiah or a devil; Jonathan feels misunderstood. One day, Fletcher dies in a flying collision. Awaking in another reality, he hears Jonathan's voice teasing him that the trick to transcending the limitations of time and space is to take it step by step \u2014 not so quickly. Fletcher is resurrected in the very midst of the flabbergasted Flock, some of whom fear and decry his supernatural reappearance, but Jonathan insists that he must learn to love the ignorant Flock. Jonathan's body suddenly begins to fade away, he requests that Fletcher stop others from thinking of him as anything silly like a god, and he gives a final piece of advice: \"find out what you already know\". Soon, Fletcher faces a group of eager new students of his own. He passes on Jonathan's sentiments that seagulls are limitless ideas of freedom and their bodies nothing more than thought itself, but this only baffles the young gulls. He realizes now why Jonathan taught him to take lessons slowly, step by step. Privately musing on Jonathan's idea that there are no limits, Fletcher smiles at the implication of this: that he will see Jonathan again, one day soon.\nPart Four (in the 2014 reprint, \"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: The Complete Edition\").\nIn 2013, Richard Bach took up a non-published fourth part of the book, which he had written contemporaneously with the original. He edited and polished it and then sent the result to a publisher. Bach reported that he was inspired to finish the fourth part of the novella by a near-death experience which had occurred in relation to a nearly fatal plane crash in August 2012. In February 2014, the 138-page Bach work \"\" was published as a booklet by Kindle Direct Publishing. \"Illusions II\" also contains allusions to and insights regarding the same near-death experience. In October 2014, \"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: The Complete Edition,\" was published, and this edition includes Part Four of the story.\nPart Four focuses on the period several hundred years after Jonathan and his students have left the Flock, and their teachings become venerated rather than practised. The birds spend all their time extolling the virtues of Jonathan and his students and spend no time flying for flying's sake. The seagulls practice strange rituals and use demonstrations of their respect for Jonathan and his students as status symbols. Eventually, some birds reject the ceremony and rituals and just start flying. A bird, named Anthony Gull, questions the value of living since \"life is pointless and since pointless is by definition meaningless then the only proper act is to dive into the ocean and drown. Better not to exist at all than to exist like a seaweed, without meaning or joy [...] He had to die sooner or later anyway, and he saw no reason to prolong the painful boredom of living.\" As Anthony makes a dive-bomb to the sea, at a speed and from an altitude which would kill him, a white blur flashes alongside him. Anthony catches up to the blur, which turns out to be a seagull, and asks what the bird was doing.\nDevelopment.\nBach, who was himself a pilot, said the concept for the book came to him as \"a visionesque spooky thing\". He stopped the project after he wrote 10 pages and didn't pick it up again for a few years. He initially wrote it as a series of short stories that were published in the late 1960s in \"Private Pilot\" magazine, as well as in \"Soaring\", the magazine of the Soaring Society of America.\nThe main character is thought to be named after John H. Livingston, an American air race pilot and Waco Aircraft Company test pilot of the 1920s and 1930. However, in the book \"The Nature of Personal Reality\" by Jane Roberts, Richard Bach states that in 1959 he was walking beside a canal and heard a voice say \"Jonathan Livingston Seagull\" \u2014 putting into question the idea that the protagonist was named after a particular person.\nThe book was rejected by several publishers before coming to the attention of Eleanor Friede at Macmillan in 1969. \"I think it has a chance of growing into a long-lasting standard book for readers of all ages\", she wrote in her acquisition memo. She convinced Macmillan to buy it and Bach received a $2,000 advance ().\nReception.\nThe book was a sleeper hit; the first edition in 1970 was only 3,000 copies and it would take two years before reaching number one on the \"New York Times\" Bestseller List. \"Not a single magazine or newspaper \u2014 including \"The New York Times Book Review\" \u2014 so much as mentioned\" the book when it first came out, \"The Times\" reported in 1972. Macmillan failed to secure any advance publicity for Bach, but he personally took out two very small ads in \"The New York Times Book Review\" and \"Publishers Weekly\". The first printing sold out by the end of 1970, and in 1971 an additional 140,000 copies were printed. Mostly a word of mouth phenomenon, it entered the \"NYT\" Bestseller List on April 20, 1972, where it remained for 37 weeks, and by July 1972 it had 440,000 copies in print. \"Reader's Digest\" published a condensed version. In 1972 and 1973, the book topped the \"Publishers Weekly\" list of bestselling novels in the United States.\nBook sellers didn't know how to classify it. \"Some put it under nature, some under religion, some under photography, some under children\u2019s books.\" Friede's advice was, \"put it next to the cash register.\"\nSeveral early commentators, emphasizing the first part of the book, see it as part of the US self-help and positive thinking culture, epitomized by Norman Vincent Peale and by the New Thought movement. Film critic Roger Ebert wrote that the book was \"so banal that it had to be sold to adults; kids would have seen through it.\"\nThe book is listed as one of fifty \"timeless spiritual classics\" in a book by Tom Butler-Bowdon, who noted that \"it is easy now, thirty-five years on, to overlook the originality of the book's concept, and though some find it rather na\u00efve, in fact it expresses timeless ideas about human potential.\"\nJohn Clute, for \"The Encyclopedia of Fantasy\" (1997), wrote: \"an animal fantasy about a philosophical gull who is profoundly affected by flying, but who demands too much of his community and is cast out by it. He becomes an extremely well-behaved accursed wanderer, then dies, and in posthumous \"fantasy\" sequences--though he is too wise really to question the fact of death, and too calmly confident to have doubts about his continuing upward mobility--he learns greater wisdom. Back on Earth, he continues to preach and heal and finally returns to heaven, where he belongs.\"\nIt has however been very poorly received by the birding community, where it is regarded as sentimental anthropomorphic nonsense; Bill Oddie was particularly scathing, writing \"I mean, no half-serious birdwatcher could enjoy (let alone write!) a book called, with such offensive imprecision, \"Jonathan Livingston-Seagull\" ... I mean, you write me \"Jonathan Livingston-Second Winter Lesser Black-backed Gull\" and I might get off on it\".\nBibliography, editions and translations.\n\"Jonathan Livingston Seagull\" has been translated into over thirty languages. Here is a partial list of editions and translations:\nIn 1980, a Spanish edition was published by Pomaire (Barcelona) featuring illustrations by photographer Jordi Olavarrieta, translated by Carol and Frederick Howell. In 1981, a French edition was published by Flammarion (Paris) featuring illustrations by photographer Jordi Olavarrieta, translated by Pierre Clostermann.\nAdaptations.\nThe novella inspired the production of a film of the same title in 1973. The film was made by Hall Bartlett many years before computer-generated effects were available. In order to make seagulls act on cue and perform aerobatics, Mark Smith of Escondido, California built radio-controlled gliders that looked like real seagulls from a few feet away. This footage was not used in the final cut of the film.\nBach had written the film's original screenplay, but he sued Paramount Pictures before the film's release because he felt that there were too many discrepancies between the film and his script. Director Bartlett had allegedly violated a term in his contract with Bach which stated that no changes could be made to the film's adaptation without Bach's approval. Ultimately, the court ruled that Bach's name would be taken off the screenplay credits, and that the film would be released with a card indicating that Bach disapproved of the final cut. Bach's attorney claimed, \"It took tremendous courage to say this motion picture had to come out of theaters unless it was changed. Paramount was stunned.\"\nThe Grammy Award-winning soundtrack album was composed and performed by Neil Diamond and produced by Tom Catalano. It won the 1974 Grammy Award as Best Original Score Written for a Motion Picture or a Television Special. The album apparently also made more money than the film, selling two million copies in the United States, 400,000 in France, 250,000 in Germany, 200,000 in Canada and 100,000 in the United Kingdom.\nThe Irish actor Richard Harris won a Grammy in 1973 for the Audiobook LP \"Jonathan Livingston Seagull.\" To date, Harris's reading has not been released on any other format. Versions read by the author, Richard Bach, have been released on LP, cassette, and CD.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He previously was Home Secretary twice (1822\u20131827, 1828\u20131830). He is regarded as the father of modern British policing, owing to his founding of the Metropolitan Police while he was Home Secretary. Peel was one of the founders of the modern Conservative Party.\nThe son of a wealthy textile manufacturer and politician, Peel was the first prime minister from an industrial business background. He earned a double first in classics and mathematics from Christ Church, Oxford. He entered the House of Commons in 1809 and became a rising star in the Tory Party. Peel entered the Cabinet as Home Secretary (1822\u20131827), where he reformed and liberalised the criminal law and created the modern police force, leading to a new type of officer known in tribute to him as \"\" and \"peelers\". After a brief period out of office he returned as Home Secretary under his political mentor the Duke of Wellington (1828\u20131830), also serving as Leader of the House of Commons. Initially a supporter of continued legal discrimination against Catholics, Peel reversed his stance and supported the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829 and the 1828 repeal of the Test Act, writing, \"though emancipation was a great danger, civil strife was a greater danger\".\nAfter being in opposition from 1830 to 1834, he became prime minister in November 1834. Peel issued the Tamworth Manifesto in December 1834, laying down the principles upon which the modern Conservative Party is based. His first ministry was a minority government, dependent on Whig support and with Peel serving as his own Chancellor of the Exchequer. After only four months, his government collapsed and he was Leader of the Opposition during the second Melbourne ministry (1835\u20131841). Peel became prime minister again after the 1841 general election. His second ministry lasted five years. He cut tariffs to stimulate trade, replacing the lost revenue with a 3 per cent income tax. He played a central role in making free trade a reality and set up a modern banking system. His government's major legislation included the Mines and Collieries Act 1842, the Income Tax Act 1842, the Factories Act 1844 and the Railway Regulation Act 1844. Peel's government was weakened by anti-Catholic sentiment following the controversial increase in the Maynooth Grant of 1845. After the outbreak of the Great Irish Famine, his decision to join with Whigs and Radicals to repeal the Corn Laws led to his resignation as prime minister in 1846. Peel remained an influential MP and leader of the Peelite faction until his death in 1850.\nPeel often started from a traditional Tory position in opposition to a measure, then reversed his stance and became the leader in supporting liberal legislation. This happened with the Test Act, Catholic emancipation, the Reform Act, income tax and, most notably, the repeal of the Corn Laws. The historian A. J. P. Taylor wrote: \"Peel was in the first rank of 19th-century statesmen. He carried Catholic Emancipation; he repealed the Corn Laws; he created the modern Conservative Party on the ruins of the old Toryism.\"\nEarly life.\nRobert Peel was born on 5 February 1788 at Chamber Hall in Bury, Lancashire, to the industrialist and parliamentarian Sir Robert Peel, 1st Baronet, and his wife, Ellen Yates. The elder Robert was one of the richest textile manufacturers of the early Industrial Revolution and had a distinguished career as a member of parliament, even being consulted on financial matters by Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger. \nThe family's history dates back to the 17th century, where it descends from yeomen in Lancashire. In 1731, a certain William Peele, bought a little estate called Peelfold which it was later inherited by his father. It was the elder Robert who changed the family name from \"Peele\" to \"Peel\", remarking that 'it was of no use as it did not add to the sound.' The family moved from Lancashire to Drayton Manor near Tamworth, Staffordshire; the manor house has since been demolished, and the site occupied by Drayton Manor Theme Park.\nBefore the end of the year, Peel was motherless and according to historian Norman Gash \"the warmth and care that a mother, or even in happier circumstances a stepmother, might have given them.\" Peel's father placed high standards for his children and raised the Peel boys on a discipline of hard work and proper duty. It was said that during the younger Peel's baptism, his father got down on his knees and dedicated his son's life to the country's service. From an early age, it was apparent that Robert was \u201cthe ablest of the family.\u201d His father once asked a tutor if his son would become a \u201cWilliam Pitt,\u201d to which the tutor replied, \u201cI hope so\u2026 but Robert Peel will be Robert Peel.\u201d He would later recall his father saying, \u201cBob, you dog, if you are not prime minister some day, I\u2019ll disinherit you.\u201d\nPeel received his early education from a clergyman tutor in Bury and at a clergyman's local school in Tamworth. There he was schooled in classical studies and emerged as a brilliant student among his peers. The broad park and surrounding countryside of Drayton instilled in Peel a love for the outdoors and led Peel to take up shooting. He may also have attended Bury Grammar School or Hipperholme Grammar School, though evidence for either is anecdotal rather than textual. In Bury, Peel was exposed to \"ridicule and jealousy\" due to the family's standing and according to his brother, Lawrence, Robert 'would walk a mile around rather than encounter the rude jests of the Bury lads'. Peel senior knew the value of elite education and social networks and was \u201ctoo shrewd not to see the advantages of coming into contact at an impressionable age and on equal terms with the future governing class of England.\" Accordingly, Robert was sent to Harrow in 1800 at the age of twelve, making him the first of his siblings to leave home. He started at Harrow School in February 1800.\nAt Harrow he was a contemporary of Lord Byron, who recalled of Peel that \"we were on good terms\" and that \"I was always in scrapes, and he never\". On Harrow's Speech Day in 1804, Peel and Byron acted part of Virgil's \"Aeneid\", Peel playing Turnus and Byron playing Latinus.\nIn 1805 Peel matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford. His tutor was Charles Lloyd, later Regius Professor of Divinity, on Peel's recommendation appointed Bishop of Oxford. In 1808 Peel became the first Oxford student to take a double first in classics and mathematics.\nPeel was a law student at Lincoln's Inn in 1809. He also held military commissions as a captain in the Manchester Regiment of Militia in 1808, and later as lieutenant in the Staffordshire Yeomanry Cavalry in 1820.\nEarly political career: 1809\u20131822.\nMember of Parliament.\nPeel entered politics in 1809 at the age of 21, as the member of Parliament (MP) for the Irish rotten borough of Cashel in County Tipperary. With a scant 24 electors on the rolls, he was elected unopposed. His sponsor for the election (besides his father) was the Chief Secretary for Ireland, Sir Arthur Wellesley, the future Duke of Wellington, with whom Peel's political career would be entwined for the next 25 years. Peel made his maiden speech at the start of the 1810 session, when he was chosen by the Prime Minister, Spencer Perceval, to second the reply to the King's speech. Peel's speech was a sensation, famously described by the Speaker, Charles Abbot, as \"the best first speech since that of William Pitt [the Younger].\"\nPeel changed constituency twice, becoming one of the two members for Chippenham in 1812, and then one of those for Oxford University in 1817.\nJunior minister.\nIn 1810 Peel was appointed an Under-Secretary of State for War and the Colonies; his secretary of state was Lord Liverpool. When Liverpool formed a government in 1812, Peel was appointed Chief Secretary for Ireland. The Peace Preservation Act 1814 authorised the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland to appoint additional magistrates in a county in a state of disturbance, who were authorised to appoint paid special constables (later called \"peelers\"). Peel thus laid the basis for the Royal Irish Constabulary.\nPeel firmly opposed Catholic emancipation, believing that Catholics could not be admitted to Parliament as they refused to swear the Oath of Allegiance to the Crown. In May 1817 Peel delivered the closing speech in opposition to Henry Grattan's Catholic emancipation bill; the bill was defeated by 245 votes to 221. Peel resigned as Chief Secretary and left Ireland in August 1818.\nIn 1819 the House of Commons appointed a select committee, the Bullion Committee, charged with stabilising British finances after the end of the Napoleonic Wars, and Peel was chosen as its chairman. Peel's Bill planned to return British currency to the gold standard, reversing the Bank Restriction Act 1797, within four years (it was actually accomplished by 1821).\nHome Secretary: 1822\u20131830.\nSenior minister.\nPeel was considered one of the rising stars of the Tory party, first entering the cabinet in 1822 as home secretary. As home secretary, he introduced a large number of important reforms to British criminal law.\nReforms and policies.\nIn one of his policies, he reduced the number of crimes punishable by death, and simplified the law by repealing a large number of criminal statutes and consolidating their provisions into what are known as Peel's Acts. He reformed the gaol system, introducing payment for gaolers and education for the inmates in the Gaols Act 1823 (4 Geo. 4. c. 64).\nIn 1827 the Prime Minister, Lord Liverpool, became incapacitated and was replaced by George Canning. Peel resigned as Home Secretary. Canning favoured Catholic emancipation, while Peel had been one of its most outspoken opponents (earning the nickname \"Orange Peel\", with Orange the colour of the Protestant Orange Order). George Canning himself died less than four months later and, after the brief premiership of Lord Goderich, Peel returned to the post of Home Secretary under the premiership of his long-time ally the Duke of Wellington. During this time he was widely perceived as the number-two in the Tory Party, after Wellington himself.\nThe Test and Corporation Acts required many officials to be communicants in the Anglican Church and penalised both nonconformists and Catholics. They were no longer enforced but were a matter of humiliation. Peel at first opposed the repeal, but reversed himself and led the repeal on behalf of the government, after consultation with Anglican Church leaders. The Sacramental Test Act 1828 passed into law in May 1828. In future religious issues he made it a point to consult with church leaders from the major denominations.\nThe 1828 Clare by-election returned the Catholic Irish nationalist leader Daniel O'Connell. By autumn 1828 the Chief Secretary for Ireland was alarmed by the extent of civil disorder and the prospect of a rebellion if O'Connell were barred from Parliament. Wellington and Peel now conceded the necessity of Catholic emancipation, Peel writing to Wellington that \"though emancipation was a great danger, civil strife was a greater danger\".\nPeel drew up the Catholic Relief bill. He felt compelled to stand for re-election to his seat in Oxford, as he was representing the graduates of Oxford University (many of whom were Anglican clergymen), and had previously stood on a platform of opposition to Catholic Emancipation. Peel lost his seat in a by-election in February 1829 to Ultra-Tory Robert Inglis, but soon found another by moving to a rotten borough, Westbury, retaining his Cabinet position. He stood for Tamworth in the general election of 1830, representing Tamworth until his death.\nPeel guided the Catholic Relief (Emancipation) bill through the House of Commons, Wellington through the House of Lords. With many Ultra-Tories vehemently opposed to emancipation, the bill could pass only with Whig support.\nWellington threatened to resign if King George IV did not give royal assent; the King finally relented, and the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829 became law in April. Peel's U-turn cost him the trust of many Tories: according to the historian Norman Gash, Peel had been \"the idolised champion of the Protestant party; that party now regarded him as an outcast\".\nFounding the Metropolitan Police.\nIt was in 1829 that Peel established the Metropolitan Police Force for London based at Scotland Yard. The 1,000 constables employed were affectionately nicknamed 'bobbies' or, somewhat less affectionately, 'peelers'. Although unpopular at first, they proved very successful in cutting crime in London, and, by 1857 all cities in Britain were obliged to form their own police forces. Known as the father of modern policing, Peel is thought to have contributed to the Metropolitan Police's first set of \"Instructions to Police Officers\", emphasising the importance of its civilian nature and policing by consent. However, what are now commonly known as the Peelian Principles were not written by him but were instead produced by Charles Reith in his 1948 book, \"A Short History of the British Police\", as a nine-point summary of the 1829 \"Instructions\".\nOpposition: 1830\u20131834.\nThe middle and working classes in England at that time, however, were clamouring for reform, and Catholic emancipation was only one of the ideas in the air. The Tory ministry refused to bend on other issues and were swept out of office in 1830 in favour of the Whigs. The following few years were extremely turbulent, but eventually enough reforms were passed that King William IV felt confident enough to invite the Tories to form a ministry again in succession to those of Lord Grey and Lord Melbourne in December 1834. Peel was selected as prime minister but was in Italy at the time, so Wellington acted as a caretaker for three weeks until Peel's return.\nFirst premiership: 1834\u20131835.\nAppointment.\nFollowing the resignation of the former prime minister Charles Grey, because of an issue regarding Ireland's conciliatory reform and at the invitation of William IV, Peel became prime minister in early December 1834. Peel formed his own government, though it was a Tory government that was a minority government and depended on Whig goodwill for its continued existence. Parliament was dissolved in late December 1834 and a general election was called. Voting took place in January and February 1835, and Peel's supporters gained around 100 seats, but this was not enough to give them a majority.\nTamworth Manifesto.\nAs his statement of policy at the general election of January 1835, Peel issued the Tamworth Manifesto. This document was the basis on which the modern Conservative Party was founded. In it Peel pledged that the Conservatives would endorse modest reform such as reforms concerning economic and financial affairs, free trade and factory workers' rights.\nThe Whigs formed a compact with Daniel O'Connell's Irish Radical members to repeatedly defeat the government on various bills. Eventually, after only about 100 days in government, Peel's ministry resigned out of frustration and the Whigs under Lord Melbourne returned to power. The only real achievement of Peel's first administration was establishing the Ecclesiastical Commission to review the governance of the Church of England. This ecclesiastical commission was the forerunner of the Church Commissioners.\nConfidence vote and resignation.\nDespite the 1835 general election in January, from which Peel attempted to consolidate his party's majority in Parliament, the Conservatives still remained a minority. This made Peel's position in the Commons precarious from the start.\nThe immediate cause of Peel's downfall was a debate over the Church of Ireland. On 7 April 1835 the Whig MP Ralph Bernal brought forward a report critical of Peel's administration of the Church of Ireland's revenues and proposed reforms. The report was passed in the Commons by a vote of 285 to 258, signifying a lack of confidence in Peel's government. This defeat underscored the government's inability to secure enough support to govern effectively.\nThis loss led to Peel's resignation the following day, on 8 April 1835. The passing of the vote of no confidence highlighted the conditions in British politics at the time in a parliamentary system. After Peel's resignation, William IV invited Lord Melbourne to form a new government, allowing the Whigs to return to power.\nLeader of the Opposition: 1835\u20131841.\nPeel's party was bolstered by the adherence of a number of dissident Whigs associated with the Derby Dilly. These self-described 'moderate Whigs' were led by former cabinet ministers Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby, and Sir James Graham, 2nd Baronet.\nIn May 1839 Peel was offered another chance to form a government, this time by Queen Victoria. However, this too would have been a minority government, and Peel felt he needed a further sign of confidence from the Queen. Lord Melbourne had been Victoria's confidant since her accession in 1837, and many of the higher posts in Victoria's household were held by the wives and female relatives of Whigs; there was some feeling that Victoria had allowed herself to be too closely associated with the Whig party. Peel, therefore, asked for some of this entourage to be dismissed and replaced with their Conservative counterparts, provoking the so-called Bedchamber Crisis. Victoria refused to change her household, and despite pleadings from Wellington, relied on assurances of support from Whig leaders. Peel refused to form a government, and the Whigs returned to power.\nSecond premiership: 1841\u20131846.\nEconomic reforms.\nPeel finally had a chance to head a majority government following the election of July 1841. Peel came to office during an economic recession which had seen a slump in world trade and a budget deficit of \u00a37.5\u00a0million run up by the Whigs. Confidence in banks and businesses was low, and a trade deficit existed.\nTo raise revenue Peel's 1842 budget saw the re-introduction of the income tax, removed previously at the end of the Napoleonic Wars. The rate was 7d in the pound, or just under 3 per cent. The money raised was more than expected and allowed for the removal and reduction of over 1,200 tariffs on imports including the controversial sugar duties. It was also in the 1842 budget that the repeal of the corn laws was first proposed. It was defeated in a Commons vote by a margin of 4:1.\nThe economic historian Charles Read has analysed Peel's economic policies as:(i) Fixing the value of British currency to a gold standard, with the paper pound currency freely convertible to gold.\n(ii) A limited banknote supply based on a fixed relationship to the gold reserve.\n(iii) Free movement of bullion flows from 1819 and lower import tariffs on food and raw materials from 1842 (often loosely referred to as free trade).\n(iv) Control of interest rates and a balanced budget in order to reduce the national debt.\nDomestic policy.\nHealth.\nA Board of Supervision was established, and two measures passed, under which county asylums were erected and prompt medical treatment was ensured. In addition, it was provided \"that a certificate of insanity, signed by two disinterested doctors, had to be presented before any person was confined to an asylum.\" According to one study, \"the whole treatment of lunacy was humanised and lifted out of the atmosphere of profits into that of curative effort and civic responsibility.\"\nFactory Act.\nPeel's promise of modest reform was held to, and the second most famous bill of this ministry, while \"reforming\" in 21st-century eyes, was in fact aimed at the reformers themselves, with their constituency among the new industrial rich. The Factory Act 1844 acted more against these industrialists than it did against the traditional stronghold of the Conservatives, the landed gentry, by restricting the number of hours that children and women could work in a factory and setting rudimentary safety standards for machinery. This was a continuation of his own father's work as an MP, as the elder Robert Peel was most noted for the reform of working conditions during the first part of the 19th century. Helping him was Lord Shaftesbury, a British MP who also established the coal mines act.\nAssassination attempt.\nIn 1843 Peel was the target of a failed assassination attempt; a criminally insane Scottish woodturner named Daniel M'Naghten stalked him for several days before, on 20 January, killing Peel's personal secretary Edward Drummond thinking he was Peel, which led to the formation of the controversial criminal defence of insanity.\nCorn Laws.\nThe most notable act of Peel's second ministry, however, was the one that would bring it down. Peel moved against the landholders by repealing the Corn Laws, which supported agricultural revenues by restricting grain imports. This radical break with Conservative protectionism was triggered by the Great Irish Famine (1845\u20131849). Tory agriculturalists were sceptical of the extent of the problem, and Peel reacted slowly to the famine, famously stating in October 1846 (already in opposition): \"There is such a tendency to exaggeration and inaccuracy in Irish reports that delay in acting on them is always desirable\".\nHis own party failed to support the bill, but it passed with Whig and Radical support. On the third reading of Peel's Bill of Repeal (Importation Act 1846) on 15 May, MPs voted 327 votes to 229 (a majority of 98) to repeal the Corn Laws. On 25 June Wellington persuaded the Lords to pass it. On that same night Peel's Irish Coercion Bill was defeated in the Commons by 292 to 219 by \"a combination of Whigs, Radicals, and Tory protectionists\". Following this, on 29 June 1846, Peel resigned as prime minister.\nFamine in Ireland.\nThough he knew repealing the laws would mean the end of his ministry, Peel decided to do so. It is possible that Peel merely used the Irish Famine as an excuse to repeal the Corn Laws as he had been an intellectual convert to free trade since the 1820s. Blake points out that if Peel had been convinced that total repeal was necessary to stave off the famine, he would have enacted a bill that brought about immediate temporary repeal, not permanent repeal over a three-year period of gradual tapering-off of duties. Peel's support for free trade could already be seen in his 1842 and 1845 budgets; in late 1842 Sir James Graham wrote to Peel that \"the next change in the Corn Laws must be to an open trade\" while arguing that the government should not tackle the issue. Speaking to the cabinet in 1844, Peel argued that the choice was the maintenance of the 1842 Corn Law or total repeal. The historian Boyd Hilton argued that Peel knew from 1844 he was going to be deposed as the Conservative leader. Many of his MPs had taken to voting against him, and the rupture within the party between liberals and paternalists, which had been so damaging in the 1820s but masked by the issue of parliamentary reform in the 1830s, was brought to the surface over the Corn Laws. Hilton's hypothesis is that Peel wished to be deposed on a liberal issue so that he might later lead a Peelite/Whig/Liberal alliance. Peel was magnanimous towards Irish famine and permitted quick settlements of disputes at frontiers in India and America (Treaty of Amritsar (1846) on 16 March 1846 and Oregon Treaty on 15 June 1846) in order to repeal Corn Laws on 29 June 1846. As an aside in reference to the repeal of the Corn Laws, Peel managed to keep minimum casualties of Irish Famine in its first year, Peel did make some moves to subsidise the purchase of food for the Irish, but this attempt was small and had little tangible effect. In the age of laissez-faire, government taxes were small, and subsidies or direct economic interference was almost nonexistent. That subsidies were actually given was very much out of character for the political times; his successor, Lord John Russell, received more criticism than Peel on Irish policy, the worst year being 1847, despite all of Peel's efforts, his reform programmes had little effect on the situation in Ireland. Russell could not manage public distribution system during Irish Famine even though subsidized food from the United States was made available in Ireland. The repeal of the Corn Laws became more political than humanitarian.\nLater career and death.\nPeel did, however, retain a hard core of supporters, known as Peelites, and at one point in 1849 was actively courted by the Whig/Radical coalition. He continued to stand on his conservative principles, however, and refused. Nevertheless, he was influential on several important issues, including the furtherance of British free trade with the repeal of the Navigation Acts. Peel was a member of the committee that controlled the House of Commons Library, and on 16 April 1850 was responsible for passing the motion that controlled its scope and collection policy for the rest of the century.\nPeel was thrown from his horse while riding on Constitution Hill in London on 29 June 1850. The horse stumbled on top of him, and he died three days later on 2 July at the age of 62 due to a broken collarbone rupturing his subclavian vessels.\nHis body was buried in the churchyard of St Peter Church, Drayton\u00a0Bassett. Inside the church is a memorial tablet which reads \"In Memory of / The Rt Hon Sir Robert Peel, Bart. / to whome the People / have raised Monuments /in many places. / His Children / erect this in the place / where his body / has been buried\".\nHis Peelite followers, led by Lord Aberdeen and William Gladstone, went on to fuse with the Whigs as the Liberal Party.\nFamily.\nPeel became engaged to Julia Floyd (1795\u20131859) (daughter of General Sir John Floyd, 1st Baronet, and his first wife Rebecca Darke) in March 1820; they married on 8 June 1820. They had seven children:\nLady Peel died in 1859. Some of their direct descendants now reside in South Africa, the Australian states of New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and Tasmania, and in various parts of the United States and Canada.\nLegacy.\nMemory and recognition.\nIn his lifetime many critics called him a traitor to the Tory cause, or as \"a Liberal wolf in sheep's clothing\", because his final position reflected liberal ideas. Others idealised Peel in heroic terms; Thomas Carlyle referred to him as a \"reforming Hercules\" in \"Latter-Day Pamphlets\" (1850).\nThe latter would become the consensus view of scholars for much of the 20th century. Historian Boyd Hilton wrote that he was portrayed as:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The great Conservative patriot: a pragmatic gradualist, as superb in his grasp of fundamental issues as he was adroit in handling administrative detail, intelligent enough to see through abstract theories, a conciliator who put nation before party and established consensus politics.\nThe biographer Norman Gash wrote that Peel \"looked first, not to party, but to the state; not to programmes, but to national expediency\". Gash added that among his personal qualities were, \"administrative skill, capacity for work, personal integrity, high standards, a sense of duty [and] an outstanding intellect\".\nGash emphasised the role of personality in Peel's political career:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Peel was endowed with great intelligence and integrity, and an immense capacity for hard work. A proud, stubborn, and quick-tempered man he had a passion for creative achievement; and the latter part of his life was dominated by his deep concern for the social condition of the country. Though his great debating and administrative talents secured him an outstanding position in Parliament, his abnormal sensitivity and coldness of manner debarred him from popularity among his political followers, except for the small circle of his intimate friends. As an administrator he was one of the greatest public servants in British history; in politics he was a principal architect of the modern conservative tradition. By insisting on changes unpalatable to many of his party, he helped to preserve the flexibility of the parliamentary system and the survival of aristocratic influence. The repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846 won him immense prestige in the country, and his death in 1850 caused a national demonstration of sorrow unprecedented since the death of William Pitt in 1806.\nPeel was the first British prime minister to have been photographed while in office. He is featured on the cover of the Beatles' \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" album.\nA study in 2021 in \"The Economic Journal\" found that the repeal of the corn laws adversely affected the welfare of the top 10 per cent of income-earners in Britain, whereas the bottom 90 per cent of income-earners gained.\nA student association of the University of Glasgow, the Peel Club was founded in 1836 and named after Peel (who was a patron of the organisation). It later became the Glasgow University Conservative Association. In 2024 a group claiming to be the revived Peel Club was founded in Pall Mall, London.\nArt collector.\nFrom 1820 Peel began amassing a major art collection, acquiring works by Dutch and Flemish Old Masters. He also commissioned a number of paintings by contemporary British artists including \"A Frost Scene\" by William Collins, \"Napoleon Musing at St Helena\" by Benjamin Robert Haydon and \"John Knox Preaching Before the Lords of Congregation\" by David Wilkie.\nThe biggest commissions Peel handed out were to Sir Thomas Lawrence, the President of the Royal Academy, who painted fifteen portraits for him between 1820 and his death in 1830. This made Peel Lawrence's greatest patron after George IV. The works Lawrence produced featured leading politicians and prominent figures of literature as well as portraits of Peel's family, notably his 1827 \"Portrait of Julia, Lady Peel\". Peel displayed his Old Masters in his London residence at Whitehall Gardens, while Lawrence's portraits were located in a dedicated gallery at Drayton Manor. Many of these works were then sold by his son to the National Gallery in London in 1871.\nMemorials.\nStatues.\nStatues of Sir Robert Peel are found in the following British and Australian locations:\nPublic houses and hotels.\nThe following public houses, bars or hotels are named after Peel:\nIn literature.\nLetitia Elizabeth Landon gave her tribute to Peel in her poetical illustration \"Sir Robert Peel\" to Thomas Lawrence's portrait in Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1837.\nRobert Peel is a secondary character in the novel \"Dodger\" by Terry Pratchett.\nPeel is an unseen nemesis of Harry Flashman in the humorous Flashman novels by George MacDonald Fraser. A young Flashman regularly battled with Peel's nascent London police force.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Considered an icon of French cinema in the same way as Jean Gabin and Alain Delon, he has completed over 200 films since 1967, most of which as a lead actor. Depardieu has worked with over 150 film directors including Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, Bertrand Blier, Maurice Pialat, Alain Resnais, Claude Chabrol, Ridley Scott, Peter Weir, Jean-Luc Godard, and Bernardo Bertolucci. He is the second highest-grossing actor in the history of French cinema behind Louis de Fun\u00e8s. Among his films, about 60 sold have more than one million tickets in France. He is known for having portrayed numerous leading historical and fictitious figures including Cyrano de Bergerac, Georges Danton, Christopher Columbus, Honor\u00e9 de Balzac, Alexandre Dumas, Auguste Rodin, Jean Valjean, Edmond Dant\u00e8s, Porthos, commissioner Maigret, Joseph Stalin and Grigori Rasputin, as well as Obelix in four of the live action Asterix films. Depardieu is also a film producer, businessman and vineyard owner. He has occasionally directed films and performed as a singer. His body of work includes many television productions, several records and, as of 2025, 19 stage plays and 9 books.\nGrowing up in poverty in Ch\u00e2teauroux, central France, Depardieu had a difficult youth before settling in Paris where he became an actor. In 1974, he had his breakthrough role in \"Going Places\", becoming an overnight star. Depardieu quickly established himself as a leading actor in European cinema and proved himself a versatile performer by appearing in a wide variety of productions, including drama, comedy, crime and avant-garde films. He has received acclaim for his performances in \"The Last Metro\" (1980), for which he won the C\u00e9sar Award for Best Actor, in \"Police\" (1985), for which he won the Volpi Cup for Best Actor, \"Jean de Florette\" (1986), and \"Cyrano de Bergerac\" (1990), for which he won the Best Actor award at the Cannes Film Festival and his second C\u00e9sar Award for Best Actor as well as garnering a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor. He started a Hollywood career with \"Green Card\" (1990), winning a Golden Globe Award, and later appeared in several big-budget English-language films, including \"\" (1992), \"The Man in the Iron Mask\" (1998), and \"Life of Pi\" (2012).\nDepardieu is a Chevalier of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur and Chevalier of the Ordre national du M\u00e9rite. He was granted citizenship of Russia in January 2013 (officially adopted name in ), and became a cultural ambassador of Montenegro during the same month. During the early 2010s, his tax exile in Russia and his support of Vladimir Putin caused controversy in France.\nDepardieu was accused of sexual misconduct as early as the 1990s, though this did not develop into formal complaints until the late 2010s. In December 2020, French authorities charged him with rape. Depardieu denied any wrongdoing but a number of controversies since 2020, not limited to the accusations of rape, damaged his popularity in France and abroad, resulting in his being stripped in 2023 of the National Order of Quebec. In May 2025, he was convicted of sexual assault against two women in a separate case. He has appealed his sentencing.\nEarly life.\nG\u00e9rard Xavier Marcel Depardieu was born on 27 December 1948 in Ch\u00e2teauroux, Indre, France, to a working-class family. He is the third of six children of Anne Jeanne Jos\u00e8phe (n\u00e9e Marillier), a stay-at-home mother known as \"La Lilette\", and Ren\u00e9 Maxime Lionel Depardieu (better known in his neighborhood as \"D\u00e9d\u00e9\" because he could write only two letters), a metal worker and volunteer fireman. Not wishing to have a child at the time, Depardieu's mother tried unsuccessfully to abort him.\nDepardieu grew up in poverty in a two-room apartment at 39 rue du Mar\u00e9chal-Joffre, Ch\u00e2teauroux, with his five siblings. His mother was not very affectionate, and sometimes violent to her children. His father, who suffered from a severe alcohol addiction, was often absent from home. Depardieu helped his mother when she was in labour with his younger brothers and sisters. His family eventually nicknamed him \"P\u00e9tard\" or \"P\u00e9tarou\", because of the habit he had acquired of breaking wind incessantly. Depardieu's parents were both born in 1923; Anne died of a heart attack in 1988 and Ren\u00e9, who suffered from cirrhosis, died two months after her.\nDepardieu spent more time on the streets than in school, leaving at the age of 13. Practically illiterate and half stammering, he learned to read only later. In his 2014 autobiography, Depardieu revealed that he had prostituted himself as a child, starting when he was 10 years old and could already pass as 15. He would sometimes rob his clients. He was later employed at a printworks, and took part in boxing matches in his spare time. He also supported himself by working as a beach attendant during summers.\nDuring his difficult adolescence, he turned to theft and smuggling all kinds of goods, notably cigarettes and alcohol, to the G.I.s at the large American air base of Ch\u00e2teauroux-D\u00e9ols. He also acted as a bodyguard for two prostitutes who came down from Paris on the G.I.s' payday. Depardieu later credited those two women with teaching him sex. In a 2005 interview, he said that he was arrested several times and put on probation at one point, but never went to prison; in his autobiography, he said that at the age of 16, he had gone to prison for three months for car theft. In 1968, Depardieu's childhood best friend Jacky Merveille, also a hoodlum from Ch\u00e2teauroux, died in a car accident. This prompted Depardieu, who had already moved to Paris at that time, to consider his future and to try and do something with his life.\nCareer.\nEarly roles and stardom.\nAs a teenager, Depardieu befriended Michel Pilorg\u00e9, a slightly older boy from a more affluent background. In 1965, Pilorg\u00e9, whose family owned a flat in Paris and who wanted to settle in the capital to become an actor, proposed Depardieu, then aged 16, to come with him. Depardieu accepted and left Ch\u00e2teauroux for Paris. Out of curiosity, he began attending the acting class Pilorg\u00e9 was taking at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre National Populaire. One day the teacher, Lucien Arnaud, noticed Depardieu and asked him to perform. The experience helped trigger Depardieu's vocation.\nDepardieu next took acting classes with Jean-Laurent Cochet while making a living as a door-to-door salesman. To compensate for his lack of education, he heavily studied the classics. At Cochet's request, he followed a therapy with Alfred A. Tomatis to correct his disastrous diction. \nDepardieu became the boyfriend, and later husband, of actress \u00c9lisabeth Guignot, who introduced him into entertainment circles and the Parisian bourgeoisie. In 1966, Guignot brought him on the first film project he worked on, \"Christmas Carole\", directed by Agn\u00e8s Varda, where he was cast as a beatnik. The film was never completed due to a lack of funding and distribution deal. In 1967, Depardieu made his first actual screen appearance in the short film \"Le Beatnik et le minet\", directed by Roger Leenhardt: his diction was still so bad at the time that his voice had to be dubbed by another actor.\nWorking on stage, Depardieu also appeared in caf\u00e9-th\u00e9\u00e2tres and became a regular performer at the Caf\u00e9 de la Gare headed by Romain Bouteille and Sotha, where he met Patrick Dewaere, Coluche, and Miou-Miou. He acquired a reputation thanks to his \"instinctive\" approach to acting. The first feature film he worked on was Michel Audiard's crime spoof \"Le cri du cormoran, le soir au-dessus des jonques\" (1971). In 1971, Jean-Louis Livi became his agent and \"mentor\", introducing him into Artmedia, France's main casting agency. Theater director Claude R\u00e9gy was enthusiastic about Depardieu, whom he found \"extraordinary\" and gifted in an \"abnormal\" way: he cast him in several plays, including Peter Handke's \"The Ride across Lake Constance\" which Depardieu later credited with jump-starting his career.\nDepardieu appeared in various supporting roles in films and on television, often portraying hoodlums and petty criminals. He played a similar character in the film where he had his first major role, Bertrand Blier's raunchy and controversial comedy \"Les Valseuses\" (\"Going Places\", 1974). Blier was initially reluctant about casting Depardieu but the actor, who felt that the character's background strongly resembled his own, pestered him until he won the role. The film, in which Depardieu co-starred with Dewaere and Miou-Miou, was a huge box office success in France, gaining a cult following and making instant stars of the three actors. Depardieu and Blier subsequently had a long working relationship, making eight more films together. That same year, Depardieu was part of the ensemble cast of Claude Sautet's \"Vincent, Fran\u00e7ois, Paul and the Others\", which came to be regarded as a classic of French cinema.\nDepardieu's other prominent films during the 1970s included the psychological thriller \"Seven Deaths by Prescription\" (1975) which earned him his first C\u00e9sar Award nomination, Barbet Schroeder's controversial \"Ma\u00eetresse\", and Andr\u00e9 T\u00e9chin\u00e9's romantic thriller \"Barocco\" where he co-starred with Isabelle Adjani (both 1976). Also in 1976, Depardieu played a lead role in Bernardo Bertolucci's Italian historical epic \"1900\", where he co-starred with Robert De Niro and an international ensemble cast that included Donald Sutherland, Stefania Sandrelli and Burt Lancaster. The thriller \"This Sweet Sickness\" (1977), directed by Claude Miller, was a box-office failure, but earned Depardieu another C\u00e9sar Award nomination. During that period, Depardieu also appeared in several experimental films, including two by Marco Ferreri, \"The Last Woman\" (1976) and \"Bye Bye Monkey\" (1978), and two by Marguerite Duras, \"The Lorry\" (1977) and \"Baxter, Vera Baxter\" (1978). He worked again with Bertrand Blier on the quirky sex comedy \"Get Out Your Handkerchiefs\" (1978), which won the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film in 1979, and the surreal dark comedy \"Cold Buffet\" (1979), which became a cult film in France.\nPeak of success.\nIn 1980, Depardieu starred in Alain Resnais' internationally successful \"My American Uncle\". That same year, he co-starred with Isabelle Huppert in \"Loulou\", directed by Maurice Pialat. This film marked the beginning of a long collaboration with Pialat, who directed Depardieu in three other films. Also in 1980, Depardieu co-starred with Catherine Deneuve in Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut's \"The Last Metro\", a drama set in Nazi-occupied Paris. The film was a major commercial success and earned Depardieu his first C\u00e9sar Award for Best Actor. Later that year, Depardieu appeared in a second film with Deneuve, Claude Berri's \"Je vous aime\". They subsequently made six more films together. Still in 1980, he co-starred with Coluche in the box-office hit \"Inspector Blunder\", a police comedy where he played the antagonist. He also tried his hand at singing, releasing an LP with lyrics written by his wife.\nDuring the first half of the 1980s, Depardieu enjoyed a series of commercial and critical successes, including his second and last film with Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, the romantic drama \"The Woman Next Door\" (1981). Other notable films included the period drama \"The Return of Martin Guerre\" (1982), Andrzej Wajda's historical drama \"Danton\" (1983), as well as the crime film \"Choice of Arms\" (1981) and the war drama \"Fort Saganne\" (1984), both directed by Alain Corneau. One major disappointment during that period was Jean-Jacques Beineix's \"The Moon in the Gutter\" (1983), which failed to meet box-office expectations. Depardieu later openly disparaged the film. Also in 1984, Depardieu made his first film as a director, \"Le tartuffe\", an adaptation of Moli\u00e8re's classic play with himself in the title role; Depardieu conceived it as a filmed version of the play, which he was performing at the time at the National Theatre of Strasbourg. The reception was disappointing for both the play and the film. Depardieu rarely returned to directing thereafter. For his performance in the crime drama \"Police\" (1985), his second film with Maurice Pialat, he was awarded the Volpi Cup for Best Actor at the Venice Film Festival. Depardieu became at that time one of the most successful and sought after actors in the French film industry.\nAlready an established dramatic performer, Depardieu extended his range and box-office appeal throughout the 1980s by appearing in a series of highly successful, family-friendly comedies. Following \"Inspector Blunder\" in 1980, he co-starred with Pierre Richard in three comedy films directed by Francis Veber, \"Knock on Wood\" (1981), \"ComDads\" (1983) and \"The Fugitives\" (1986), that were major commercial hits in France. Depardieu functioned as the straight man in his pairing with Richard.\nIn 1985, Depardieu co-starred with Sigourney Weaver in the screwball comedy \"One Woman or Two\", which failed to make an impact at the box-office. In 1986, he worked again with Bertrand Blier in \"Evening Dress\", a provocative comedy-drama about homosexuality which was remarkably successful in France, given the subject matter. That same year, his international profile rose as a result of his performance as a doomed, hunchbacked farmer in Claude Berri's period drama \"Jean de Florette\", which won immense public and critical acclaim. Also in 1986, he co-starred with singer Barbara in a musical play she had conceived, \"Lily Passion\". The show enjoyed great success. The next year, he played the lead role in Maurice Pialat's \"Under the Sun of Satan\", which controversially won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. \nIn 1988, Depardieu was Isabelle Adjani's co-star in the successful and critically acclaimed biographical drama \"Camille Claudel\". Several of Depardieu's next films were box-office disappointments, including Fran\u00e7ois Dupeyron's \"A Strange Place to Meet\" (1988) and Alain Resnais' \"I Want to Go Home\" (1989) but, also in 1989, he enjoyed renewed success with Bertrand Blier's \"Too Beautiful for You\" which won the Grand prix at the Cannes Film Festival and the C\u00e9sar Award for Best Film.\nIn 1990, Depardieu received particular notice for his starring role in Jean-Paul Rappeneau's \"Cyrano de Bergerac\", based on Edmond Rostand's 1897 play. The film was an international box-office success and won critical acclaim: Depardieu's performance as Cyrano earned him his second C\u00e9sar Award for Best Actor, the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actor, the London Film Critics' Circle Award for Actor of the Year, as well as a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor. Later that year, Depardieu appeared in the ensemble cast of \"Uranus\", a satirical drama about postwar France directed by Claude Berri.\nDepardieu's next film was the American romantic comedy \"Green Card\", directed by Peter Weir and co-starring Andie MacDowell. His first Hollywood picture, it was specifically conceived as a vehicle to introduce him to a wide English-speaking audience. Though the film performed moderately at the box-office, it earned Depardieu a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor. However, remarks Depardieu had made in a 1978 interview about raping women during his teenage years re-emerged in the American press. The resulting controversy damaged his nascent Hollywood career. It was speculated in the French media that it had also prevented him from winning the Academy Award for \"Cyrano de Bergerac\".\nIn 1991 Depardieu starred in two successful films, the comedy \"My Father the Hero\" and Alain Corneau's period drama \"Tous les Matins du Monde\", which won critical acclaim. In the latter film, he and his son Guillaume portrayed the same character at different ages. Depardieu next started filming Ridley Scott's historical epic \"\", in which he starred as Christopher Columbus. Released in 1992 to celebrate the 500th anniversary of Columbus' voyage, the film flopped in the United States but did good business in Europe. Also in 1992, Depardieu was the Jury President for the Cannes film festival.\nDepardieu also developed a passion for the films directed by John Cassavetes. In the early 1990s, together with Jean-Louis Livi, he bought the distribution rights for most of Cassavetes' films, including some that had never been released in France, to introduce them to a new audience. He later co-produced and appeared in Nick Cassavetes' first film as a director, \"Unhook the Stars\" (1996) and co-produced his next film, \"She's So Lovely\" (1997).\nDepardieu's next box-office successes in France were Claude Berri's epic period drama \"Germinal\" (1993) where he was part of an ensemble cast, Jean Becker's drama \"\u00c9lisa\" (1995) where he played a supporting role alongside Vanessa Paradis, and Jean-Marie Poir\u00e9's comedy \"Guardian Angels\" (also 1995) in which he co-starred with Christian Clavier. In 1993, Depardieu starred in the experimental \"H\u00e9las pour moi\", directed by Jean-Luc Godard, though Godard and Depardieu disliked working together and Depardieu eventually refused to promote the film. During the same period, the science fiction thriller \"The Machine\" (1994) was a box-office flop; Depardieu's performance in that film received unusually poor reviews.\nIn 1994, Depardieu starred in \"My Father the Hero\", the Hollywood remake of his 1991 French film of the same name. His subsequent English-language roles included \"Bogus\" (1994), a cameo in Kenneth Branagh's \"Hamlet\" (1996), \"The Man in the Iron Mask\" (1998), \"Vatel\", \"102 Dalmatians\" (both 2000) and \"CQ\" (2001).\nDuring the late 1990s and early 2000s, Depardieu starred in several successful television miniseries, notably portraying Edmond Dant\u00e8s in \"The Count of Monte Cristo\" (1998) and Jean Valjean in \"Les Mis\u00e9rables\" (2000). In 1999, 15 years after \"Le tartuffe\", he made his second film as a director, \"The Bridge\", a romantic drama starring himself and his real-life partner Carole Bouquet. The film, which Depardieu co-directed with Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Auburtin, was not a success. Depardieu's other films during that period included \"Vidocq\" (2001), a digitally-shot steampunk mystery that did well at the box-office but was panned by critics, as well as the successful comedies \"The Best Job in the World\" (1996), \"The Closet\" (2001) and \"Ruby &amp; Quentin\" (2003). In 1999, Depardieu starred as Obelix in \"Asterix and Obelix vs. Caesar\", the first live action adaptation of the Asterix franchise. He reprised the role in three sequels, most notably Alain Chabat's \"\" (2002), one of the most commercially successful French films ever.\nLater work.\nBy the mid-2000s, though Depardieu remained very active, many of the films he starred in were less successful internationally than before. He readily admitted that some of them were of poor quality. In 2004, the large-budget action comedy \"San-Antonio\" was a major box-office failure in France. Depardieu, who was set to play the protagonist, contributed to the production's troubles by being unable to lose weight for his role as planned, which caused him to be recast as the hero's overweight sidekick. Depardieu's subsequent notable appearances included starring roles in the crime film \"The 36\" (2004), the romantic drama \"When I Was a Singer\" (2006) which won him the Lumi\u00e8re Award for Best Actor, Claude Chabrol's last film, the murder mystery \"Bellamy\" (2009), as well as supporting parts in \"La Vie en Rose\" (2007), \"Mesrine\" (2008) and Ang Lee's \"Life of Pi\" (2012). He also published a cookbook in 2005.\nIn 2010, Depardieu played starring roles in the successful comedy film \"Potiche\", the biographical film \"Dumas\" and the comedy drama \"My Afternoons with Margueritte\". Also in 2010, he starred in the surprise success \"Mammuth\", a low-budget dramedy for which he had agreed to work at the union minimum wage in exchange for a percentage of the revenue.\nIn the early 2010s, Depardieu's popularity in France suffered from the controversies following his tax exile first in Belgium then in Russia, and his public praise of Vladimir Putin. Several of his films performed dismally at the French box-office, including the period drama \"The Man Who Laughs\" (2012) which was released in the midst of the controversy. In 2014, Depardieu starred in Abel Ferrara's controversial \"Welcome to New York\" as a thinly-disguised impersonation of disgraced former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn. The film was released only on VOD. Also in 2014, Depardieu appeared in \"United Passions\", a promotional film about the history of FIFA that bombed at the box-office and was lambasted by critics. Still in 2014, the crime film \"Viktor\", an English-language Russian production, flopped in its limited U.S. release, failed to secure a release in France and was ridiculed by several French media.\nTwo films Depardieu made with director Guillaume Nicloux, \"Valley of Love\", also starring Isabelle Huppert (2015), and \"The End\", a low-budget film released on VOD (2016), while not box-office successes, earned him nominations for the C\u00e9sar Award for Best Actor (for the first film) and the Lumi\u00e8re Award for Best Actor (for both films). Depardieu made two further films with Nicloux, including \"Thalasso\" (2019) where he co-starred with author Michel Houellebecq.\nFrom 2016 to 2018, Depardieu played a starring role in \"Marseille\", Netflix's first French-language original series. He authored or co-authored four books between 2014 and 2020, either to tell his life story or to express his personal philosophy. Starting in 2017, Depardieu performed Barbara's songs on stage as a homage to the late singer. He reprised this show several times in the following years.\nDepardieu next appeared in the drama \"Home Front\" (2020), the literary adaptation \"Lost Illusions\" (2021), the successful comedy \"Retirement home\", the crime film \"Maigret\" and the drama \"The Green Shutters\" (all 2022). His public image was then impacted by the accusations of rape and sexual assault against him. In April 2023, he was excluded from the promotion of his latest film, \"Umami\". Later that year, his public performances of Barbara's songs were disrupted by feminists, causing the cancellation of several shows.\nAs a result of these allegations and the criminal charges brought against him, Depardieu was ostracized by most French filmmakers: in March 2025, while he was on trial, it was reported that he hadn't worked on a film since the completion of \"The Green Shutters\" in 2021. In May 2025, Depardieu began work on his first film in four years, \"Elle regardait sans plus rien voir\", a Portuguese-French coproduction directed by Fanny Ardant.\nPersonal life.\nRelationships and children.\nIn 1970, Depardieu married actress \u00c9lisabeth Guignot (later known professionally as \u00c9lisabeth Depardieu), with whom he had two children: actor Guillaume (1971\u20132008) and actress Julie (b. 1973). They separated in the early 1990s, though their divorce was only finalised in 2006 once a settlement was found after a lengthy court dispute.\nAs his marriage deteriorated, Depardieu met model Karine Silla (sister of producer Virginie Besson-Silla) and began a relationship with her. On 28 January 1992, while Depardieu was separated from Guignot, he and Silla had a daughter, Roxane. Silla remained Depardieu's partner until 1996. Also in 1996, Depardieu and his wife definitely separated following attempts at reconciliation.\nFrom 1996 to 2005, Depardieu was in a relationship with actress Carole Bouquet. On 14 July 2006, he had a son, Jean, with H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Bizot (daughter of Fran\u00e7ois Bizot, not to be confused with the actress of the same name). Between 2005 and 2023, Depardieu was in a relationship with Cl\u00e9mentine Igou. As of 2024, he is in a relationship with Magda Vavrusova.\nOn 13 October 2008, Depardieu's son Guillaume died from pneumonia at the age of 37. Guillaume's health had been adversely affected by drug addiction and a 1995 motorcycle crash that eventually required the amputation of his right leg in 2003. Depardieu and Guillaume had a turbulent relationship, including a public falling out in 2003, but had reconciled prior to Guillaume's death. In his 2014 autobiography, Depardieu acknowledged his shortcomings as a father, saying that he had been unable to provide an answer to Guillaume's suffering. Later on, he blamed his son's death on the prison sentence he had received at the age of 17 for drug offences: he said that Guillaume had never recovered from it and that he had been unfairly treated by the court due to being his son. Depardieu commented that his son had been \"killed\" for two grams of heroin.\nHealth.\nDepardieu's eating and drinking habits have caused his weight to increase noticeably over the years. He managed several times to lose weight through strict diets, only to later gain it back. In the course of the 2000s he became permanently, then severely overweight. In a 2014 film review, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" called Depardieu \"morbidly obese\". As Depardieu weighed at the end of 2008, film critic Pascal M\u00e9rigeau commented on Depardieu's large amounts of food consumption, \"at lunch he ingests of red meat, swallows handfuls of saltine crackers\". Laurent Audiot, the chef of the Parisian restaurant \"La Fontaine Gaillon\", compared Depardieu to the gluttonous giant Gargantua, saying that \"he has excessive energy and he compensates with food, but sometimes it takes on incredible proportions\".\nAccording to a 2024 biography, Depardieu's already heavy drinking worsened after his son Guillaume died in 2008. In September 2014, Depardieu stated he drank twelve, thirteen or fourteen bottles of alcoholic drinks daily, starting at 10:00\u00a0a.m., drinking champagne, wine, and pastis, and ending the day with vodka, whisky, or both. He said: \"I'm never totally drunk, just a bit of a pain in the ass\".\nOn 18 May 1998, Depardieu had a motorcycle accident with a high blood alcohol content, of 2.5 g/L on the way to the shooting of \"Asterix and Obelix vs. Caesar\". He was prescribed forty days off work. In 2000, Depardieu underwent heart bypass surgery after two weeks of chest pains. In 2011, he was removed from a Cityjet flight to Dublin after refusing to sit down due to being refused access to the toilet and urinating in a bottle. Depardieu apologised for this and his fellow actor \u00c9douard Baer attributed it to prostate issues.\nIn 2012, Depardieu was hit by a car while riding his scooter in Paris. The same year, while intoxicated with 1.8 g/L of alcohol in his blood, he had another scooter accident, without injury and without collision with another party. In 2013, it was reported that since the 2000s he had been involved in at least seven motorcycle or scooter accidents.\nIn the context of Depardieu's 2025 trial, it was mentioned by his legal team that he suffered from heart ailments and diabetes, the latter illness dating back to his twenties.\nTax exile and citizenship.\nOn 7 December 2012, after French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande introduced a plan to tax high incomes at 75%, Depardieu registered as a resident of N\u00e9chin, Belgium in a tax avoidance move. French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault criticized Depardieu's move as \"shabby\" and unpatriotic. On 15 December, Depardieu said that he felt \"insulted\" by Ayrault's remarks, commented that in the eyes of the French government, \"success, creation, talent, anything different, must be punished\" and stated he would be handing back his French passport.\nOn 20 December, Russian President Vladimir Putin offered Depardieu Russian citizenship, which the actor accepted. On 3 January 2013, Putin signed an Executive Order granting Russian citizenship to Depardieu. On 5 January, Depardieu met with Putin at the latter's residence in Sochi, to receive his Russian passport. The controversy harmed Depardieu's public image in France. Also in January 2013, Depardieu was appointed a cultural ambassador for Montenegro, a country where he had also considered becoming a tax resident. In February, he registered as a resident of Saransk, Russia. He received a preferential tax treatment in Russia, where he became subject to a 6% tax rate, half as high as the majority of other fiscal residents. In 2018, he stated that he wished to become a citizen of Turkey.\nIn February 2022, Depardieu revealed in an interview that he had become a citizen of the United Arab Emirates, although he did not specify when this occurred. In that same interview, he said that he had retained his French passport, even though he wished to live \"less and less\" in France. Depardieu's friend Guy Roux said that the actor's resentment of France stemmed from the 2008 death of his son Guillaume, which he blamed on the French judiciary.\nWhile residing in Russia part of the year, Depardieu remained registered as a resident of N\u00e9chin. In February 2025, it was reported that the French National Financial Prosecutor's office had opened an investigation into aggravated tax evasion and money laundering pertaining to Depardieu's tax residence in Belgium. Magistrates aimed to establish whether Depardieu really had been living in N\u00e9chin, or if he had instead been staying in France for a period longer than that allowed by his status as a tax resident abroad.\nPolitical views.\nIn 1987, Depardieu published an op-ed in the left-wing newspaper \"Lib\u00e9ration\" in support of socialist French President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, announcing that he would be \"voting for the first time\" on the occasion of Mitterrand's 1988 reelection bid. He later said that he had abstained that year. In 1993, he expressed support for the French Communist Party. Later on, he supported conservative President Jacques Chirac. Following the 2002 presidential election, he supported again the Communist Party, then on the verge of bankruptcy after its electoral failure, by donating 10,000 euros. In 2010, he said that right-wing President Nicolas Sarkozy was the only politician he appreciated. In 2012, during Sarkozy's unsuccessful bid for reelection, Depardieu publicly endorsed him and spoke at one of his rallies. He later said that he had been \"drunk\" that day.\nSince the 1990s, Depardieu has publicly associated himself with authoritarian leaders, based on his economic interests. In the course of that decade, while investing into an oil exploration project in Cuba, he met then-President Fidel Castro and expressed his sympathy for him. In 1998, he supported Slovak Prime Minister Vladim\u00edr Me\u010diar's bid for reelection. It was later revealed that Depardieu had been paid 45,000 euros for his endorsement of Me\u010diar, which he acknowledged in 2004. Depardieu eventually said he had realised afterwards that Me\u010diar was \"a real fascist\". Depardieu also expressed support for Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika after investing into vineyards in Algeria. His associations with political strongmen were long tolerated by the French general public.\nAfter Vladimir Putin granted him Russian citizenship, Depardieu penned an open letter to the Russian President, praising him and calling Russia \"a great democracy\". His support for Putin was widely condemned in France, by a broad spectrum of political actors. That open letter also drew ridicule from the Russian opposition. Depardieu granted his first extensive interview after becoming a Russian national to the state-owned news channel Russia-24: he was dismissive of Putin's opponents, stating that \"The Russian opposition has no programme; it has nothing\". In his autobiography, he commented that Putin \"immediately liked [his] hooligan side.\" Depardieu subsequently made public appearances with Putin's allies, Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, and expressed his support for them. In August 2015, Depardieu's films were banned from television and cinemas in Ukraine after he said \"I love Russia and Ukraine, which is part of Russia\". Following his acquisition of Russian citizenship, Depardieu also expressed anti-American sentiment: in 2015, while in Moscow where he was performing a play, he stated that the United States were \"a people who have constantly destroyed others\".\nOne of Depardieu's biographers, Bernard Violet, stated that the actor's fascination with dictators stemmed in part from his interest in extraordinary characters, whom he saw as \"shakespearian monsters\", and also from his taste for provocation. Another biographer, Lionel Duroy, said that Depardieu had no understanding of politics and was totally naive in this area.\nIn a 2021 interview, Depardieu said that he disliked dictators, had never met one, and did not consider Putin to be one. In March 2022, following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, he distanced himself from Putin, condemning the invasion and accusing the Russian President of \"crazy, unacceptable excesses\".\nReligion.\nThough not baptised at birth, Depardieu had a Catholic upbringing. In the 2010s, he revealed that as a young man, he had converted to Islam as part as his interest in spirituality. Depardieu credited an Umm Kulthum concert he attended in Paris in 1965 with starting his interest in Islam. According to Depardieu, this conversion took place in the late 1960s, though he also said in some interviews that it had occurred during the 1970s. He \"was a Muslim for two years\" before giving up due to his inability to speak Arabic. He later expressed interests in Buddhism and Hinduism.\nIn 2003, following an encounter with Pope John Paul II, Depardieu gave public readings of Saint Augustine's \"Confessions\" at Notre-Dame. Over the years, he gave several other readings of Saint Augustine's works. In September 2020, Depardieu converted to Eastern Orthodox Christianity in the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral in Paris.\nBusiness ventures and wealth.\nIn 1983, Depardieu created the company DD Productions to co-produce films and rent filming equipments. Owning shares of the films he starred in allowed him to earn additional income from box office receipts, home video and television broadcastings.\nApart from his film career, Depardieu is also a viticulturist, having invested in vineyards at the end of the 1980s. He owns wine estates in the M\u00e9doc, H\u00e9rault, Burgundy, Eastern Europe, Maghreb, and South America. In addition, Depardieu is the owner of the \"\" (Tigne Castle) in Anjou. He also collects fine arts and motorcycles. In 2003, Depardieu bought the restaurant \"La Fontaine Gaillon\" in the 2nd arrondissement of Paris. Its wine cellar, which consisted of bottles of Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Brion, Ch\u00e2teau Latour, Meursault and Saint-\u00c9milion, was rewarded by the Gault Millau guide. \"La Fontaine Gaillon\" was described as \"a Parisian institution\". He sold the restaurant in 2019. \nOver the years, Depardieu has invested into various ventures, including in the late 1990s an unsuccessful oil exploration project in Cuba. During the 1990s, he was associated with Planet Hollywood, to which he provided wine. Depardieu has generated additional income by appearing in commercials and advertising campaigns. In the early 1990s, he starred in two Barilla commercials, directed respectively by Ridley Scott and David Lynch. He was later featured in various campaigns aimed exclusively at the Eastern European market.\nIn Paris, Depardieu owns luxury restaurants, a Japanese delicatessen, a wine bar, and a seafood shop. By 2012, he employed over a hundred people in France through fifteen companies. In 2013, Depardieu's wealth was estimated at US$200\u00a0million. He said that the 2006 divorce settlement with his wife cost him 15 million euros. Depardieu owns a luxury hotel built in 1805 in the 6th arrondissement of Paris valued at 50\u00a0million euros ($53.5\u00a0million).\nSexual assault and rape allegations.\nFirst controversy.\nIn 1977, Harry Stein interviewed Depardieu on the set of \"Get Out Your Handkerchiefs\". The interview, which was published in the March\u2013April 1978 issue of \"Film Comment\" under the title \"Depardieu: French Primitive\", addressed the actor's difficult upbringing and turbulent youth: it quoted Depardieu as saying that he had first participated in a rape when he was nine years old and in more rapes since then, and commenting that there were \"too many [rapes] to count... There was nothing wrong with it. The girls wanted to be raped. I mean, there's no such thing as rape. It's only a matter of a girl putting herself in a situation where she wants to be.\". \nThe story re-emerged in February 1991, shortly after the release of \"Green Card\", when \"Time\" published an interview of Depardieu where he appeared to confirm these statements and commented: \"it was absolutely normal in those circumstances. That was part of my childhood.\" On 15 March 1991, Depardieu's American publicist Lois Smith stated: \"He's sorry, but it happened\". The National Organization for Women requested an apology from Depardieu. Later that month, Depardieu's French publicist Claude Devy discounted the statements made by Smith, and Depardieu threatened legal action against any media outlet that published the comments. Depardieu's team said that \"Time\" had mistranslated the French verb \"assister\" as \"participate\", when a more accurate translation would be \"attend\" or \"be witness to\". \"Time\" refused to retract the story and claimed that Depardieu had told them he had \"participated\" in the rapes.\nAt that time, Depardieu received support from the French media, who claimed he was being mistreated and blamed American \"puritanism.\" As a result, his career in France was not affected, and the French general public eventually forgot the controversy over time.\n2018 rape accusation.\nIn August 2018, Depardieu was accused of sexual assault and rape by Charlotte Arnould, a 22-year old actress and dancer. Arnould, whose identity was initially concealed, made her name public in December 2021.\nThe daughter of a longtime friend of Depardieu, Arnould said that on 7 August 2018 she had been invited by the actor to his Parisian home, ostensibly to discuss her career: there, she said, Depardieu had digitally raped her. According to her account, on 13 August she went back to Depardieu's home to confront him, only to be similarly raped a second time.\nArnould made her statement on 27 August to police in Lambesc, southern France, after which the case was passed to prosecutors in the capital. Depardieu denied the allegations. In 2019, the charges were dropped after a nine-month police investigation. Actress Emmanuelle Debever commented the news by accusing Depardieu of groping her on the set of the 1983 film \"Danton\". The case was reopened in October 2020 after Arnould refiled the complaint.\nFollowing Arnould's second complaint, French authorities charged Depardieu with rape on 16 December 2020. The actor rejected the allegation through his lawyer. In March 2022, the Paris Court of Appeal rejected Depardieu's attempt to have the charges dropped and announced that the actor would remain under formal investigation. On 14 August 2024, the Paris Public Prosecutor requested that Depardieu go to trial. On 2 September 2025, judges ordered case to be heard against him on charges of rape and sexual assault, though no trial date was set.\n2023-2024 controversy and further accusations.\nOn 11 April 2023, investigative website \"Mediapart\" reported that 13 women were accusing Depardieu of sexual assault and sexual harassment pertaining to incidents that occurred on film and television sets between 2004 and 2022. Several of these women said that Depardieu's behavior had happened in full view, without anyone objecting. On 23 May, Charlotte Arnould gave a television interview where she recounted her version in detail. On 1 October 2023, after several of his public performances were disrupted by feminist protesters and hecklers, Depardieu published an open letter disputing the accusations.\nIn that context, Depardieu's reputation was further damaged on 7 December 2023, when French television newsmagazine \"Compl\u00e9ment d'enqu\u00eate\" broadcast a segment about the accusations against the actor, which included behind-the-scenes footage from a documentary project Depardieu had worked on with author-director Yann Moix. In that footage, shot in 2018 in North Korea, Depardieu could be seen making multiple obscene, sexist and misogynistic remarks.\nEmmanuelle Debever died on 6 December 2023 after one week in a hospital following a suicide attempt, leading to speculation that her death was connected to the \"Compl\u00e9ment d'enqu\u00eate\" broadcast. On 13 December 2023, G\u00e9rard Depardieu was stripped of the National Order of Quebec, on the grounds of what Quebec premier Fran\u00e7ois Legault called \"scandalous remarks made by G\u00e9rard Depardieu in front of the cameras\". He had been appointed as a Knight of the National Order of Quebec in 2002 by premier Bernard Landry. That segment also caused Radio T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Suisse, the French-language television of Switzerland, to announce that for the time being it would no longer broadcast films starring Depardieu. On 17 December, Depardieu's daughter Julie, her two half-siblings and several other family members signed an op-ed in support of him. \nOn 19 December, Spanish author and photographer Ruth Baza told \"La Vanguardia\" that Depardieu had forcibly kissed and groped her in 1995 when, at age 23, she had interviewed him in Paris. Although the facts were likely time-barred, Baza filed a complaint in Spain, saying that she hoped it would encourage other people to speak out.\nFrench politicians also reacted to the \"Compl\u00e9ment d'enqu\u00eate\" documentary. Culture Minister Rima Abdul Malak expressed outrage at Depardieu's behavior, saying that he brought \"shame\" to France, and launched a disciplinary procedure that could lead to the actor's Legion of Honour being rescinded. On the contrary, when asked for comment on 21 December, President Emmanuel Macron denounced the \"manhunt\" against Depardieu and said that the actor made France \"proud\". Macron later clarified that he was not \"complacent\" about sexual abuse and had defended Depardieu's presumption of innocence. Depardieu later sued France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions over the report.\nDepardieu's former partner Carole Bouquet went on television to defend his character. On 25 December 2023, a group of over 50 French actors and other prominent figures including Bouquet, Charlotte Rampling, Carla Bruni, Fanny Ardant, Nathalie Baye, Bertrand Blier and Roberto Alagna, signed an open letter published in French newspaper \"Le Figaro\" that denounced the \"lynching\" of Depardieu. The text, titled \"Do not cancel G\u00e9rard Depardieu\", claimed that the actor was the victim of a \"torrent of hatred\", adding that he was \"probably the greatest of all actors\" and that attacking him was an attack on art itself. Several signatories, including Bouquet and Pierre Richard, eventually distanced themselves from the op-ed due to its content and after it was revealed that it had been penned by an actor with far-right connections. \nDepardieu's former partner Karine Silla also defended him. Sophie Marceau, who had made two films with Depardieu during the 1980s, said that she had found his attitude \"rude and inappropriate\", though he wouldn't harass famous actresses and instead \"went more for low-level assistants\". On 1 January 2024, over 150 French performers signed an op-ed in \"Lib\u00e9ration\", saying that artists should be held accountable like anyone and expressing support for the victims of sexual assault. That text eventually attracted 500 signatories. In a January 2024 French opinion poll, 23% of respondents stated that they would no longer watch films starring Depardieu. \nIn September 2023 and January 2024 respectively, two women, an actress and an assistant, filed complaints for assault against Depardieu, for incidents they said had occurred on film sets in 2007 and 2014. Both complaints were dismissed as time-barred. In February 2024, two other women, a set decorator and an assistant director, filed complaints against Depardieu for assaulting them in 2021 on the set of the film \"The Green Shutters\". On 29 April 2024, police detained Depardieu for questioning over the sexual assault accusations. He was formally charged for the incidents on the set of \"The Green Shutters\".\n2025 sexual assault trial.\nDepardieu's trial on two counts of sexual assault said to have occurred during the shooting of \"The Green Shutters\" was scheduled to begin on 28 October 2024. That day, Depardieu's lawyer said that health concerns meant he was unable to attend court. The trial was rescheduled, and began on 24 March 2025.\nDepardieu spoke in his own defense, taking the stand for three days. He denied any sexual misconduct, but appeared sometimes confused and unfocused. Several women testified that they had been groped by Depardieu on film sets, or had seen him grope other women. Fanny Ardant, his friend and co-star in several films including \"The Green Shutters\", testified of his good character. Anouk Grinberg, who had also co-starred with Depardieu in that film, attended the trial in support of the two plaintiffs.\nOn 13 May 2025, Depardieu was convicted on both counts of sexual assault. He was handed an 18 month suspended sentence. The court commented that Depardieu did not appear to have \"grasped the notion of consent\". He appealed his conviction. \nAwards.\nDepardieu has been nominated for the C\u00e9sar for Best Actor in a Leading Role 17 times during his career and won it twice, in 1981 and 1991. He was also nominated for an Oscar in 1990 for his role in \"Cyrano de Bergerac\".\nBesides his acting accolades, he has been awarded the following order of merits:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Algebras in universal algebra are far more general: they are a common generalisation of \"all\" algebraic structures. \"Subalgebra\" can refer to either case.\nSubalgebras for algebras over a ring or field.\nA subalgebra of an algebra over a commutative ring or field is a vector subspace which is closed under the multiplication of vectors. The restriction of the algebra multiplication makes it an algebra over the same ring or field. This notion also applies to most specializations, where the multiplication must satisfy additional properties, e.g. to associative algebras or to Lie algebras. Only for unital algebras is there a stronger notion, of unital subalgebra, for which it is also required that the unit of the subalgebra be the unit of the bigger algebra.\nExample.\nThe 2\u00d72-matrices over the reals R, with matrix multiplication, form a four-dimensional unital algebra M(2,R). The 2\u00d72-matrices for which all entries are zero, except for the first one on the diagonal, form a subalgebra. It is also unital, but it is not a unital subalgebra.\nThe identity element of M(2,R) is the identity matrix I, so the unital subalgebras contain the line of diagonal matrices {\"x\" I : \"x\" in R}. For two-dimensional subalgebras, consider\nformula_1\nWhen \"p\" = 0, then E is nilpotent and the subalgebra { \"x\" I + \"y\" E : \"x, y\" in R } is a copy of the dual number plane. When \"p\" is negative, take \"q\" = 1/\u221a\u2212\"p\", so that (\"q\" E)2 = \u2212 I, and subalgebra { \"x\" I + \"y\" (\"q\"E) : \"x,y\" in R } is a copy of the complex plane. Finally, when \"p\" is positive, take \"q\" = 1/\u221a\"p\", so that (\"q\"E)2 = I, and subalgebra { \"x\" I + \"y\" (\"q\"E) : \"x,y\" in R } is a copy of the plane of split-complex numbers. By the law of trichotomy, these are the only planar subalgebras of M(2,R).\nL. E. Dickson noted in 1914, the \"Equivalence of complex quaternion and complex matric algebras\", meaning M(2,C), the 2x2 complex matrices. But he notes also, \"the real quaternion and real matric sub-algebras are not [isomorphic].\" The difference is evident as there are the three isomorphism classes of planar subalgebras of M(2,R), while real quaternions have only one isomorphism class of planar subalgebras as they are all isomorphic to C.\nSubalgebras in universal algebra.\nIn universal algebra, a subalgebra of an algebra \"A\" is a subset \"S\" of \"A\" that also has the structure of an algebra of the same type when the algebraic operations are restricted to \"S\". If the axioms of a kind of algebraic structure is described by equational laws, as is typically the case in universal algebra, then the only thing that needs to be checked is that \"S\" is \"closed\" under the operations.\nSome authors consider algebras with partial functions. There are various ways of defining subalgebras for these. Another generalization of algebras is to allow relations. These more general algebras are usually called structures, and they are studied in model theory and in theoretical computer science. For structures with relations there are notions of weak and of induced substructures.\nExample.\nFor example, the standard signature for groups in universal algebra is (\u2022, \u22121, 1). (Inversion and unit are needed to get the right notions of homomorphism and so that the group laws can be expressed as equations.) Therefore, a subgroup of a group \"G\" is a subset \"S\" of \"G\" such that:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A homomorphism is a function that preserves the underlying algebraic structure in the domain to its image.\nWhen the algebraic structures involved have an underlying group structure, the kernel is taken to be the preimage of the group's identity element in the image, that is, it consists of the elements of the domain mapping to the image's identity. For example, the map that sends every integer to its parity (that is, 0 if the number is even, 1 if the number is odd) would be a homomorphism to the integers modulo 2, and its respective kernel would be the even integers which all have 0 as its parity. The kernel of a homomorphism of group-like structures will only contain the identity if and only if the homomorphism is injective, that is if the inverse image of every element consists of a single element. This means that the kernel can be viewed as a measure of the degree to which the homomorphism fails to be injective.\nFor some types of structure, such as abelian groups and vector spaces, the possible kernels are exactly the substructures of the same type. This is not always the case, and some kernels have received a special name, such as normal subgroups for groups and two-sided ideals for rings. The concept of a kernel has been extended to structures such that the inverse image of a single element is not sufficient for deciding whether a homomorphism is injective. In these cases, the kernel is a congruence relation.\nKernels allow defining quotient objects (also called quotient algebras in universal algebra). For many types of algebraic structure, the fundamental theorem on homomorphisms (or first isomorphism theorem) states that image of a homomorphism is isomorphic to the quotient by the kernel.\nDefinition.\nGroup homomorphisms.\nA group is a set formula_1 with a binary operation formula_2 satisfying the following three properties for all formula_3:\nA group is also called abelian if it also satisfies formula_10.\nLet formula_1 and formula_12 be groups. A group homomorphism from formula_1 to formula_12 is a function formula_15 such that formula_16 for all formula_17. (For simplicity, the operation symbol formula_2 is omitted.) Letting formula_19 be the identity element of formula_12, then the \"kernel\" of formula_21 is the preimage of the singleton set formula_22; that is, the subset of formula_1 consisting of all those elements of formula_1 that are mapped by formula_21 to the element formula_19.\nThe kernel is usually denoted formula_27 (or a variation). In symbols:\n formula_28\nSince a group homomorphism preserves identity elements, the identity element formula_29 of formula_1 must belong to the kernel. The homomorphism formula_21 is injective if and only if its kernel is only the singleton set formula_32.\nformula_27 is a subgroup of formula_1 and further it is a normal subgroup. Thus, there is a corresponding quotient group formula_35. This is isomorphic to formula_36, the image of formula_1 under formula_21 (which is a subgroup of formula_12 also), by the first isomorphism theorem for groups.\nRing homomorphisms.\nA ring with identity (or unity) is a set formula_40 with two binary operations formula_41 and formula_2 satisfying:\nA ring is commutative if the multiplication is commutative, and such a ring is a field when every formula_52 has a multiplicative inverse, that is, some formula_53 where formula_54. Let formula_40 and formula_56 be rings. A ring homomorphism from formula_40 to formula_56 is a function formula_59 satisfying for all formula_60:\nThe \"kernel\" of formula_21 is the kernel as additive groups. It is the preimage of the zero ideal formula_64, that is, the subset of formula_40 consisting of all those elements of formula_40 that are mapped by formula_21 to the element formula_68.\nThe kernel is usually denoted formula_27 (or a variation).\nIn symbols:\n formula_70\nSince a ring homomorphism preserves zero elements, the zero element formula_71 of formula_40 must belong to the kernel.\nThe homomorphism formula_21 is injective if and only if its kernel is only the singleton set formula_74.\nThis is always the case if formula_40 is a field, and formula_56 is not the zero ring.\nSince formula_27 contains the multiplicative identity only when formula_56 is the zero ring, it turns out that the kernel is generally not a subring of formula_40. The kernel is a subrng, and, more precisely, a two-sided ideal of formula_40. Thus, it makes sense to speak of the quotient ring formula_81. The first isomorphism theorem for rings states that this quotient ring is naturally isomorphic to the image of formula_21 (which is a subring of formula_56).\nLinear maps.\nGiven a field formula_84, a vector space (over formula_84) is an abelian group formula_86 (with binary operation formula_41 and identity formula_45) with scalar multiplication from formula_84 satisfying for all formula_90 and formula_91:\nLet formula_86 and formula_97 be vector spaces over the field formula_84. A linear map (or linear transformation) from formula_86 to formula_97 is a function formula_101 satisfying for all formula_91 and formula_103:\nIf formula_106 is the zero vector of formula_97, then the kernel of formula_108 (or null space) is the preimage of the zero subspace formula_109; that is, the subset of formula_86 consisting of all those elements of formula_86 that are mapped by formula_108 to the element formula_106. The kernel is denoted as formula_114, or some variation thereof, and is symbolically defined as:\n formula_115\nSince a linear map preserves zero vectors, the zero vector formula_116 of formula_86 must belong to the kernel. The transformation formula_108 is injective if and only if its kernel is reduced to the zero subspace.\nThe kernel formula_114 is always a linear subspace of formula_86. Thus, it makes sense to speak of the quotient space formula_121. The first isomorphism theorem for vector spaces states that this quotient space is naturally isomorphic to the image of formula_108 (which is a subspace of formula_97). As a consequence, the dimension of formula_86 equals the dimension of the kernel plus the dimension of the image.\nModule homomorphisms.\nLet formula_40 be a ring. A module over formula_40 is defined exactly like a vector space over a field, using the same axioms, except the field is replaced with a ring. In fact, a module over a field is exactly the same as a vector space over a field. Let formula_127 and formula_128 be formula_40-modules. A module homomorphism from formula_127 to formula_128 is also a function formula_132 satisfying the same analogous properties of a linear map. The kernel of formula_133 is defined to be:\n formula_134\nEvery kernel is a submodule of the domain module, which means they always contain 0, the additive identity of the module. Kernels of abelian groups can be considered a particular kind of module kernel when the underlying ring is the integers.\nExamples.\nGroup homomorphisms.\nLet formula_1 be the cyclic group on 6 elements formula_136 with modular addition, formula_12 be the cyclic on 2 elements formula_138 with modular addition, and formula_21 the homomorphism that maps each element formula_140 to the element formula_141 modulo 2 in formula_12. Then formula_143, since all these elements are mapped to formula_144. The quotient group formula_145 has two elements: formula_146 and formula_147, and is isomorphic to formula_12.\nGiven a isomorphism formula_149, one has formula_150. On the other hand, if this mapping is merely a homomorphism where \"H\" is the trivial group, then formula_151 for all formula_140, so thus formula_153.\nLet formula_154 be the map defined as formula_155. Then this is a homomorphism with the kernel consisting precisely the points of the form formula_156. This mapping is considered the \"projection onto the x-axis.\" A similar phenomenon occurs with the mapping formula_157 defined as formula_158, where the kernel is the points of the form formula_159\nFor a non-abelian example, let formula_160 denote the Quaternion group, and formula_161 the Klein 4-group. Define a mapping formula_162 to be:\n formula_163\n formula_164\n formula_165\n formula_166\nThen this mapping is a homomorphism where formula_167.\nLet formula_168 denote the circle group, consisting of all complex numbers with absolute value (or modulus) of formula_51, with the group operation being multiplication. Then the function formula_170 sending formula_171 is a homomorphism with the integers being the kernel. The first isomorphism theorem then implies that formula_172.\nThe symmetric group on formula_173 elements, formula_174, has a surjective homomorphism formula_175 that takes each permutation to the parity of the number of transpositions whose product is that permutation. The alternating group formula_176 is the kernel of this homomorphism, consisting of the even permutations. The alternating group is a non-abelian simple group for formula_177.\nThe determinant of formula_178 invertible matrices of the real numbers formula_179, whose set is denoted formula_180 and called the general linear group of formula_178 matrices of formula_179, is a homomorphism onto the multiplication group formula_183 (consisting of all non-zero real numbers), and the kernel of the determinant is called the special linear group formula_184 of formula_178 matrices of formula_179. These are the matrices whose determinant is precisely formula_51.\nGiven a group formula_1 and an element, the mapping formula_189 is an automorphism - an isomorphism whose domain and image are the same group. This gives a homomorphism from formula_1 to its automorphism group formula_191, mapping each formula_141 to its respective inner automorphism as described, and the kernel of this homomorphism is the center formula_193 of formula_1, consisting of formula_140 where for every formula_196, we have formula_197, or equivalently formula_198. More generally, for every normal subgroup formula_12 of formula_1 (i.e. groups closed under conjugation), this conjugation map is also an automorphism on formula_12, giving another homomorphism formula_1 to formula_203, with the kernel being the centralizer formula_204 of formula_12 in formula_1, being the set of formula_140 where for every formula_208, we have formula_209.\nRing homomorphisms.\nConsider the mapping formula_210 where the later ring is the integers modulo 2 and the map sends each number to its parity; 0 for even numbers, and 1 for odd numbers. This mapping turns out to be a homomorphism, and since the additive identity of the later ring is 0, the kernel is precisely the even numbers.\nLet formula_211 be defined as formula_212. This mapping, which happens to be a homomorphism, sends each polynomial to its constant term. It maps a polynomial to zero if and only if said polynomial's constant term is 0. Polynomials with real coefficients can receive a similar homomorphism, with its kernel being the polynomials with constant term 0.\nLinear maps.\nLet formula_213 be defined as formula_214, then the kernel of formula_133 (that is, the null space) will be the set of points formula_216 such that formula_217, and this set is a subspace of formula_218 (the same is true for every kernel of a linear map).\nIf formula_219 represents the derivative operator on real polynomials, then the kernel of formula_219 will consist of the polynomials with deterivative equal to 0, that is the constant functions.\nConsider the mapping formula_221, where formula_222 is a polynomial with real coefficients. Then formula_108 is a linear map whose kernel is precisely 0, since 0 is the only polynomial to satisfy formula_224 for all formula_225.\nQuotient algebras.\nThe kernel of a homomorphism can be used to define a quotient algebra. Let formula_1 and formula_12 be groups, formula_228 be a group homomorphism, and denote formula_229. Put formula_230 to be the set of fibers of the homomorphism formula_133, where a fiber is the set of points of the domain mapping to a single point in the range. Let formula_232 denotes the fiber of the element formula_233, then a group operation on the set of fibers can be endowed by formula_234, and formula_230 is called the quotient group (or factor group), to be read as \"G modulo K\" or \"G mod K\". The terminology arises from the fact that the kernel represents the fiber of the identity element of the range, formula_12, and that the remaining elements are simply \"translates\" of the kernel, so the quotient group is obtained by \"dividing out\" the kernel.\nThe fibers can also be described by looking at the domain relative to the kernel; given formula_237 and any element formula_238, then formula_239 where:\n formula_240\n formula_241\nthese sets are called the left and right cosets respectively, and can be defined in general for any arbitrary subgroup of formula_1. The group operation can then be defined as formula_243, which is well-defined regardless of the choice of representatives of the fibers.\nAccording to the first isomorphism theorem, there is an isomorphism formula_244, where the later group is the image of the homomorphism formula_133, and the isomorphism is defined as formula_246, and such map is also well-defined.\nFor rings, modules, and vector spaces, one can define the respective quotient algebras via the underlying additive group structure, with cosets represented as formula_247. Ring multiplication can be defined on the quotient algebra as formula_248, and is well-defined. For a ring formula_40 (possibly a field when describing vector spaces) and a module homomorphism formula_250 with kernel formula_251, one can define scalar multiplication on formula_230 by formula_253 for formula_254 and formula_255, which will also be well-defined.\nKernel structures.\nThe structure of kernels allows for the building of quotient algebras from structures satisfying the properties of kernels. Any subgroup formula_128 of a group formula_1 can construct a quotient formula_258 by the set of all cosets of formula_128 in formula_1. The natural way to turn this into a group, similar to the treatment for the quotient by a kernel, is to define an operation on (left) cosets by formula_261, however this operation is well defined if and only if the subgroup formula_128 is closed under conjugation under formula_1, that is, if formula_140 and formula_265, then formula_266. Furthermore, the operation being well defined is sufficient for the quotient to be a group. Subgroups satisfying this property are called normal subgroups. Every kernel of a group is a normal subgroup, and for a given normal subgroup formula_128 of a group formula_1, the natural projection formula_269 defined as formula_270 is a homomorphism with formula_271, so the normal subgroups are precisely the subgroups which are kernels. The closure under conjugation, however, gives a criterion for when a subgroup is a kernel for some homomorphism.\nFor a ring formula_40, treating it as a group, one can take a quotient group via an arbitrary subgroup formula_273 of the ring, which will be normal due to the ring's additive group being abelian. To define multiplication on formula_274, the multiplication of cosets, defined as formula_275 needs to be well-defined. Taking representatives formula_276 and formula_277 of formula_278 and formula_279 respectively, for formula_280 and formula_281, yields:\n formula_282\nSetting formula_283 implies that formula_273 is closed under multiplication, while setting formula_285 shows that formula_286, that is, formula_273 is closed under arbitrary multiplication by elements on the left. Similarly, taking formula_288 implies that formula_273 is also closed under multiplication by arbitrary elements on the right. Any subgroup of formula_40 that is closed under multiplication by any element of the ring is called an ideal. Analogously to normal subgroups, the ideals of a ring are precisely the kernels of homomorphisms.\nExact sequence.\nKernels are used to define exact sequences of homomorphisms for groups and modules. Given modules formula_291, formula_292, and formula_293, a pair of homomorphisms formula_294, written as formula_295 is said to be exact (at formula_292) if formula_297. An exact sequence is then a sequence of modules and homomorphisms formula_298 where each adjacent pair of modules and homomorphisms is exact.\nIt is unnecessary to label the homomorphisms in an exact sequence which start or end at the zero module as there is only one unique map; the map formula_299 when the zero module is the domain, and the map formula_300 when the zero module is the range. Exact sequences can be used to describe when a homomorphism is injective, surjective, or an isomorphism. In particular, the sequences formula_301, formula_302, and formula_303 are exact if and only if the labeled homomorphism are injective, surjective, and an isomorphism respectively.\nA particular kind of exact sequence is a short exact sequence, which is of the form formula_304. These sequences are related to the extension problem: given modules formula_291 and formula_293, determine the modules formula_292 where formula_291 is a submodule of formula_292, and their resulting quotient is isomorphic to formula_293. Such a module is called an extension of formula_293 by formula_291 (or alternatively, an extension of formula_291 by formula_293). The extension problem, when written as exact sequences, can be stated as finding all short exact sequences formula_304 with formula_291 and formula_293 fixed. Such an extension implies that formula_318 and formula_319 is the kernel of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\nUniversal algebra.\nKernels can be generalized in universal algebra for homomorphisms between any two algebraic structures. An operation on a set formula_291 is a function of the form formula_321, where formula_173 is the arity (or rank) of the operation. An formula_173-ary operation takes an ordered list of formula_173 elements from formula_291 and maps them to a single element in formula_291. An algebraic structure is a tuple formula_327 where formula_291 is the underlying set of the algebra, and formula_84 is an indexed set of operations formula_330 on formula_291, with their interpretation denoted formula_332. The set indexing formula_84 is the language, which also maps each operation symbol to their fixed arity (called the rank function). Two algebraic structures are similar when they share the same language, including their rank function.\nLet formula_291 and formula_292 be algebraic structures of a similar type formula_84. A homomorphism is a function formula_337 that respects the interpretation of each formula_330, that is, taking formula_339 to be an formula_173-ary operation, and formula_341 for formula_342: \n formula_343\nThe \"kernel\" of formula_21, denoted formula_27, is the subset of the direct product formula_346 consisting of all ordered pairs of elements of formula_291 whose components are both mapped by formula_21 to the same element in formula_292. In symbols:\n formula_350\nThe homomorphism formula_21 is injective if and only if its kernel is the diagonal set formula_352, which is always contained inside the kernel. formula_27 is an equivalence relation on formula_291, and in fact a congruence relation, meaning that for an n-ary operation formula_330, the relation formula_356 for formula_342 implies formula_358. It makes sense to speak of the quotient algebra formula_359, with the set consisting of the equivalence classes formula_360 of the kernel, and the well-defined operations defined for an formula_173-ary operation formula_330 as: \n formula_363\nThe first isomorphism theorem in universal algebra states that this quotient algebra is naturally isomorphic to the image of formula_21 (which is a subalgebra of formula_292).\nCategory theory.\nKernels of morphisms.\nKernels can be generalized in categories that have zero objects. A category must satisfy having:\nA morphism formula_337 is an isomorphism when there exists a morphism formula_379 such that formula_380 and formula_381 are the identity morphisms. A zero object is an object of a category in which there exists exactly one morphism going to every object and exactly one morphism from every object. Any two zero objects are isomorphic to each other. If the zero object of a category is labeled formula_45, then the composition of the morphisms formula_383 is the formula_45-morphism from formula_291 to formula_292.\nThe kernel of a morphism formula_387 is a morphism formula_388 that is universal to the property that formula_389. In other words, if there is a morphism formula_390 with formula_391, then there exists a unique morphism formula_392 such that formula_393. This is illustrated in the commutative diagram:\nThe kernel is denoted as formula_394. The kernel is the limit of the diagram formula_395. By reversing the direction of the morphisms and compositions given in the definition of a kernel, this defines the notion of a cokernel, denoted as formula_396. The image (category theory) of a morphism is defined as formula_397 when the respective kernel/cokernel exist.\nThe notions of kernels/cokernels gives rise to the definition of an abelian category. A category is additive when it has a zero object, products for any two objects, and the morphisms between any two fixed objects form an abelian group with composition distributing over the addition on this group. Morphisms in an additive category may be called homomorphisms. An additive category is then called an abelian category when every homomorphism has a kernel and cokernel, every monomorphism is the kernel of its cokernel, and every epimorphism is the cokernel of its kernel.\nEqualizer.\nKernels of morphisms can be generalized by the notion of an equalizer. An equalizer for two morphism formula_398 in a category is an object formula_399 and a morphism formula_400 such that formula_401, and moverover it is universal with respect to this property; if formula_402 is another morphism with formula_403, then there exists a unique morphism formula_404 such that formula_405. Any equalizer morphism must be monic; if formula_406 with formula_407, then formula_408.\nFor abelian groups, the equalizer of two homomorphisms is the same as the equalizer between the difference of these two homomorphisms and the zero homomorphism, so the only equalizers that are needed to be considered in the category of abelian groups are the ones between any homomorphism formula_409 and the zero homomorphism formula_410. The object of such an equalizer is (up to isomorphism) formula_411, the kernel of the homomorphism formula_412, and the associated morphism is the inclusion map. This example illustrates that equalizers are a generalization of a kernel of a morphism, in particular, the kernel of a morphism is the equalizer between the morphism with the respective zero morphism.\nKernel pairs.\nThe kernel pair of a morphism formula_413 is defined as the pullback on this morphism paired with itself. It can be visualized with the commutative diagram:\nKernels of functors.\nFunctors between categories can also have a kernel. A (covariant) functor from a category formula_414 to formula_415, denoted formula_416, maps objects and morphisms from formula_414 to formula_415 such that the following hold:\nA congruence on a category formula_414 is an equivalence relation formula_424 on morphisms where formula_425 implies they share the same domain and codomain, and furthermore formula_426 for any applicable morphisms formula_427 and formula_428. A congruence gives rise to an associated congruence category formula_429 with the same objects as formula_414 but with morphisms consisting of formula_431 where formula_425, composition being defined componentwise, and the identity morphism being formula_433. Then a quotient category formula_434 can be formed, where the objects are again the same as formula_414, the morphisms are the equivalence classes formula_436 under the congruence, the identity morphism being its associated equivalence class formula_437, and composition defined as formula_438. There are two projection functors from the congruence category to the original category, labeled as formula_439, and there is a quotient functor formula_440 from the category to its quotient category acting as the coequalizer of the two projection functors.\nA functor formula_416 gives a congruence formula_442 where formula_443 if and only if they share the same domain and codomain, and furthermore formula_444. The kernel of formula_84 is then denoted as the associated congruence category formula_446.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Versions of the theorems exist for groups, rings, vector spaces, modules, Lie algebras, and other algebraic structures. In universal algebra, the isomorphism theorems can be generalized to the context of algebras and congruences.\nHistory.\nThe isomorphism theorems were formulated in some generality for homomorphisms of modules by Emmy Noether in her paper \"Abstrakter Aufbau der Idealtheorie in algebraischen Zahl- und Funktionenk\u00f6rpern\", which was published in 1927 in Mathematische Annalen. Less general versions of these theorems can be found in work of Richard Dedekind and previous papers by Noether.\nThree years later, B.L. van der Waerden published his influential \"Moderne Algebra\", the first abstract algebra textbook that took the groups-rings-fields approach to the subject. Van der Waerden credited lectures by Noether on group theory and Emil Artin on algebra, as well as a seminar conducted by Artin, Wilhelm Blaschke, Otto Schreier, and van der Waerden himself on ideals as the main references. The three isomorphism theorems, called \"homomorphism theorem\", and \"two laws of isomorphism\" when applied to groups, appear explicitly.\nGroups.\nWe first present the isomorphism theorems of the groups.\nTheorem A (groups).\nLet formula_1 and formula_2 be groups, and let formula_3 be a homomorphism. Then:\nIn particular, if formula_4 is surjective then formula_2 is isomorphic to formula_9.\nThis theorem is usually called the \"first isomorphism theorem\".\nTheorem B (groups).\nLet formula_1 be a group. Let formula_14 be a subgroup of formula_1, and let formula_16 be a normal subgroup of formula_1. Then the following hold:\nTechnically, it is not necessary for formula_16 to be a normal subgroup, as long as formula_14 is a subgroup of the normalizer of formula_16 in formula_1. In this case, formula_16 is not a normal subgroup of formula_1, but formula_16 is still a normal subgroup of the product formula_18.\nThis theorem is sometimes called the \"second isomorphism theorem\", \"diamond theorem\" or the \"parallelogram theorem\".\nAn application of the second isomorphism theorem identifies projective linear groups: for example, the group on the complex projective line starts with setting formula_34, the group of invertible 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 complex matrices, formula_35, the subgroup of determinant 1 matrices, and formula_16 the normal subgroup of scalar matrices formula_37, we have formula_38, where formula_39 is the identity matrix, and formula_40. Then the second isomorphism theorem states that:\n formula_41\nTheorem C (groups).\nLet formula_1 be a group, and formula_16 a normal subgroup of formula_1.\nThen\nThe last statement is sometimes referred to as the \"third isomorphism theorem\". The first four statements are often subsumed under Theorem D below, and referred to as the \"lattice theorem\", \"correspondence theorem\", or \"fourth isomorphism theorem\".\nTheorem D (groups).\nLet formula_1 be a group, and formula_16 a normal subgroup of formula_1.\nThe canonical projection homomorphism formula_73 defines a bijective correspondence\nbetween the set of subgroups of formula_1 containing formula_16 and the set of (all) subgroups of formula_48. Under this correspondence normal subgroups correspond to normal subgroups. \nThis theorem is sometimes called the \"correspondence theorem\", the \"lattice theorem\", and the \"fourth isomorphism theorem\".\nThe Zassenhaus lemma (also known as the butterfly lemma) is sometimes called the fourth isomorphism theorem.\nDiscussion.\nThe first isomorphism theorem can be expressed in category theoretical language by saying that the category of groups is (normal epi, mono)-factorizable; in other words, the normal epimorphisms and the monomorphisms form a factorization system for the category. This is captured in the commutative diagram in the margin, which shows the objects and morphisms whose existence can be deduced from the morphism formula_3. The diagram shows that every morphism in the category of groups has a kernel in the category theoretical sense; the arbitrary morphism \"f\" factors into formula_78, where \"\u03b9\" is a monomorphism and \"\u03c0\" is an epimorphism (in a conormal category, all epimorphisms are normal). This is represented in the diagram by an object formula_79 and a monomorphism formula_80 (kernels are always monomorphisms), which complete the short exact sequence running from the lower left to the upper right of the diagram. The use of the exact sequence convention saves us from having to draw the zero morphisms from formula_79 to formula_2 and formula_9.\nIf the sequence is right split (i.e., there is a morphism \"\u03c3\" that maps formula_84 to a \u03c0-preimage of itself), then \"G\" is the semidirect product of the normal subgroup formula_85 and the subgroup formula_86. If it is left split (i.e., there exists some formula_87 such that formula_88), then it must also be right split, and formula_89 is a direct product decomposition of \"G\". In general, the existence of a right split does not imply the existence of a left split; but in an abelian category (such as that of abelian groups), left splits and right splits are equivalent by the splitting lemma, and a right split is sufficient to produce a direct sum decomposition formula_90. In an abelian category, all monomorphisms are also normal, and the diagram may be extended by a second short exact sequence formula_91.\nIn the second isomorphism theorem, the product \"SN\" is the join of \"S\" and \"N\" in the lattice of subgroups of \"G\", while the intersection \"S\"\u00a0\u2229\u00a0\"N\" is the meet.\nThe third isomorphism theorem is generalized by the nine lemma to abelian categories and more general maps between objects.\nNote on numbers and names.\nBelow we present four theorems, labelled A, B, C and D. They are often numbered as \"First isomorphism theorem\", \"Second...\" and so on; however, there is no universal agreement on the numbering. Here we give some examples of the group isomorphism theorems in the literature. Notice that these theorems have analogs for rings and modules.\nIt is less common to include the Theorem D, usually known as the \"lattice theorem\" or the \"correspondence theorem\", as one of isomorphism theorems, but when included, it is the last one.\nRings.\nThe statements of the theorems for rings are similar, with the notion of a normal subgroup replaced by the notion of an ideal.\nTheorem A (rings).\nLet formula_92 and formula_14 be rings, and let formula_94 be a ring homomorphism. Then:\nIn particular, if formula_95 is surjective then formula_14 is isomorphic to formula_100.\nTheorem B (rings).\nLet formula_92 be a ring. Let formula_14 be a subring of formula_92, and let formula_39 be an ideal of formula_92. Then:\nTheorem C (rings).\nLet \"R\" be a ring, and \"I\" an ideal of \"R\". Then\nTheorem D (rings).\nLet formula_39 be an ideal of formula_92. The correspondence formula_142 is an inclusion-preserving bijection between the set of subrings formula_115 of formula_92 that contain formula_39 and the set of subrings of formula_119. Furthermore, formula_115 (a subring containing formula_39) is an ideal of formula_92 if and only if formula_118 is an ideal of formula_119.\nModules.\nThe statements of the isomorphism theorems for modules are particularly simple, since it is possible to form a quotient module from any submodule. The isomorphism theorems for vector spaces (modules over a field) and abelian groups (modules over formula_152) are special cases of these. For finite-dimensional vector spaces, all of these theorems follow from the rank\u2013nullity theorem.\nIn the following, \"module\" will mean \"\"R\"-module\" for some fixed ring \"R\".\nTheorem A (modules).\nLet formula_153 and formula_16 be modules, and let formula_155 be a module homomorphism. Then:\nIn particular, if formula_95 is surjective then formula_16 is isomorphic to formula_161.\nTheorem B (modules).\nLet formula_153 be a module, and let formula_14 and formula_167 be submodules of formula_153. Then:\nTheorem C (modules).\nLet \"M\" be a module, \"T\" a submodule of \"M\".\nTheorem D (modules).\nLet formula_153 be a module, formula_16 a submodule of formula_153. There is a bijection between the submodules of formula_153 that contain formula_16 and the submodules of formula_195. The correspondence is given by formula_196 for all formula_197. This correspondence commutes with the processes of taking sums and intersections (i.e., is a lattice isomorphism between the lattice of submodules of formula_195 and the lattice of submodules of formula_153 that contain formula_16).\nUniversal algebra.\nTo generalise this to universal algebra, normal subgroups need to be replaced by congruence relations.\nA congruence on an algebra formula_115 is an equivalence relation formula_202 that forms a subalgebra of formula_203 considered as an algebra with componentwise operations. One can make the set of equivalence classes formula_204 into an algebra of the same type by defining the operations via representatives; this will be well-defined since formula_205 is a subalgebra of formula_203. The resulting structure is the quotient algebra.\nTheorem A (universal algebra).\nLet formula_207 be an algebra homomorphism. Then the image of formula_4 is a subalgebra of formula_209, the relation given by formula_210 (i.e. the kernel of formula_4) is a congruence on formula_115, and the algebras formula_204 and formula_214 are isomorphic. (Note that in the case of a group, formula_215 iff formula_216, so one recovers the notion of kernel used in group theory in this case.)\nTheorem B (universal algebra).\nGiven an algebra formula_115, a subalgebra formula_209 of formula_115, and a congruence formula_205 on formula_115, let formula_222 be the trace of formula_205 in formula_209 and formula_225 the collection of equivalence classes that intersect formula_209. Then\nTheorem C (universal algebra).\nLet formula_115 be an algebra and formula_234 two congruence relations on formula_115 such that formula_236. Then formula_237 is a congruence on formula_238, and formula_204 is isomorphic to formula_240\nTheorem D (universal algebra).\nLet formula_115 be an algebra and denote formula_242 the set of all congruences on formula_115. The set\nformula_242 is a complete lattice ordered by inclusion.\nIf formula_245 is a congruence and we denote by formula_246 the set of all congruences that contain formula_205 (i.e. formula_248 is a principal filter in formula_242, moreover it is a sublattice), then\nthe map formula_250 is a lattice isomorphism.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Beatty stars in the lead role alongside Diane Keaton as activist Louise Bryant and Jack Nicholson as playwright Eugene O'Neill.\nThe supporting cast includes Edward Herrmann, Jerzy Kosi\u0144ski, Paul Sorvino, Maureen Stapleton, Gene Hackman, Ramon Bieri, Nicolas Coster, and M. Emmet Walsh. The film also features, as \"witnesses\", interviews with the 98-year-old radical educator and peace activist Scott Nearing, author Dorothy Frooks, reporter and author George Seldes, civil liberties advocate Roger Baldwin, and writer Henry Miller, among others. George Jessel, who died shortly before the film was released in December 1981, would make an appearance in \"Reds\" as one of numerous contemporaries of Reed and Bryant who were shown in interviews.\n\"Reds\" was released on December 4, 1981, to widespread critical acclaim. Beatty was awarded the Academy Award for Best Director and the film was nominated for Best Picture, but lost to \"Chariots of Fire\". Beatty, Keaton, Nicholson, and Stapleton were nominated for Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actor, and Best Supporting Actress, respectively, with Stapleton winning her category. Beatty became the third person to be nominated for Academy Awards in the categories Best Director, Actor, and, with co-writer Trevor Griffiths, Original Screenplay\u2014losing again to \"Chariots of Fire\"\u2014for a film nominated for Best Picture.\nIn June 2008, the American Film Institute revealed \"AFI's 10 Top 10\"\u2014the best ten films in ten \"classic\" American film genres\u2014after polling over 1,500 people from the film community. \"Reds\" came in ninth in the epic genre.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPlot.\nIn 1915, married journalist and suffragist Louise Bryant encounters the radical journalist John Reed for the first time at a lecture in Portland, Oregon, and is intrigued with his idealism. After meeting him for an interview on international politics that lasts an entire night, she realizes that writing has been her only escape from her frustrated existence. Inspired to leave her husband, Bryant joins Reed in Greenwich Village, New York City, and becomes acquainted with the local community of activists and artists, including anarchist and author Emma Goldman and playwright Eugene O'Neill.\nLater, they move to Provincetown, Massachusetts, to concentrate on their writing, becoming involved in the local theater scene. Through her writing, Bryant becomes known as a feminist and radical in her own right. Reed becomes involved in labor strikes with the \"Reds\" of the Industrial Workers of the World. Obsessed with changing the world, he grows restless and heads for St. Louis to cover the 1916 Democratic National Convention.\nDuring Reed's absence, Bryant falls into a complicated affair with O'Neill. Upon his return, Reed discovers the affair and realizes he still loves Bryant. The two marry secretly and make a home together in Croton-on-Hudson, New York, but still have conflicting desires. When Reed admits his own infidelities, Bryant takes a ship to Europe to work as a war correspondent.\nAfter a flareup of a kidney disorder results in his having one removed, Reed is warned to avoid excessive travel or stress, but decides to take the same path as Louise and goes to Europe. Reunited as professionals, the two find their passion rekindled as they travel to Russia and are swept up in the fall of the czarist regime and the events of the 1917 Revolution.\nAfter returning to the United States, Reed writes \"Ten Days That Shook the World\", while Louise is called to testify in front of the Overman Committee. In order to implement the communist ideals he saw in Russia, Reed becomes active in the Socialist Party of America's new Left Wing Section. The Socialist Party soon undergoes a major political shift, with Reed and the Left Wing elected to 12 of its National Executive Committee's 15 seats, but the sitting members of the Committee prevent a takeover of the party by invalidating the election and expelling the entire Left Wing. Differing ideology among the expelled members causes them to splinter into two rival organizations, with Reed forming the Communist Labor Party of America. Anxious to establish his group as the United States' true Communist Party, Reed plans to return to Russia to secure official recognition from the Soviet Comintern. Having grown tired of the political infighting, Bryant threatens to end their relationship if he goes, but he does so anyway, promising to be home by Christmas.\nAs it was now illegal to travel to Russia, Reed enters the country by traveling to Finland and sneaking across the border. Once there, though, he grows disillusioned with the authoritarian policies the Bolsheviks have imposed upon communist Russia. Reed attempts to leave and return to Bryant, but is imprisoned in Finland after being caught trying to cross the border. After learning of his arrest, Louise seeks the U.S. government's help in securing his release, but it refuses, as in his absence, he has been indicted on charges of sedition.\nWith no other recourse, Louise illegally travels to Finland herself, but by the time she arrives, Reed has been returned to Russia as part of a prisoner exchange between the two countries.\nNow living in Petrograd, Reed is employed as a propagandist with the Comintern, and shares an apartment with Emma Goldman, who had been deported from the U.S. Unaware that Louise has traveled to Finland, he repeatedly tries to make contact with her by sending telegrams to New York and becomes increasingly frustrated by the lack of response. Louise makes her way to Petrograd, where she is found by Emma, who tells her Reed was sent to deliver a speech in Baku.\nDuring his return to Petrograd, the czarist White Army attacks Reed's train. Reed survives the attack and is reunited with Louise at the train station. Soon thereafter, he is admitted to the hospital with typhus, and Louise cares for him. On his last day, they have loving words for each other. Louise goes down the hall to get him water and returns to find him dead. She enters his room, takes his hand, and sits by his bed.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Warren Beatty as John Silas \"Jack\" Reed\nProduction.\nDevelopment.\nBeatty came across the story of John Reed in the mid-1960s. Executive producer and film editor Dede Allen remembers Beatty's mentioning making a film about Reed's life as early as 1966. Originally titled \"Comrades\", the first script was written by Beatty in 1969, but the process stalled. In 1973, Beatty was offered the role of Reed in Sergei Bondarchuk's Soviet film production \"Red Bells\", but declined, and felt further driven to make his own biopic about Reed to compete with the Soviet version.\nIn 1976, Beatty found a suitable collaborator in Trevor Griffiths, who began work but was delayed by his wife's death in a plane crash. The preliminary draft of the script was finished in 1978. Beatty still had problems with it and he and Griffiths spent four and a half months fixing it. Beatty also collaborated with his friends Robert Towne, Peter Feibleman, and Elaine May to continue polishing the script after shooting had begun.\nFinancing.\nBeatty achieved tremendous success with 1978's \"Heaven Can Wait\", which he produced, starred in, co-wrote and co-directed for Paramount Pictures. The success gave Beatty the clout to seek funding for his long nurtured \"Reds\" project, which was difficult to secure because of the controversial communist subject matter and high price tag. Beatty succeeded in interesting both Warner Bros. and Paramount, before the head of Gulf &amp; Western (Paramount's parent company), Charles Bluhdorn, agreed to finance the project. Bluhdorn soon had second thoughts, and attempted to dissuade Beatty with the promise of underwriting a $25 million alternative to \"Reds\" of Beatty's choice, but Beatty remained committed.\nCasting.\nBeatty originally had no intention of acting in the film or even directing it because he had learned on projects such as \"Bonnie and Clyde\" (1967) and \"Heaven Can Wait\" (1978) that producing a film alone is a difficult task. He briefly considered John Lithgow for the part of John Reed because the two were similar in appearance, but eventually Beatty decided to act in the film and direct it himself. Nicholson was cast as Eugene O'Neill over James Taylor and Sam Shepard. Nicholson was older than the young O'Neill he was playing, and having just completed work on Kubrick's \"The Shining\" (1980), was in a \"most shambolic\" and \"grotesque\" physical state, according to producer Simon Relph. But Nicholson was committed to the role and appeared at the start of filming four months later having lost the weight he had gained and looking much younger.\nBeatty also chose to cast non-actors in supporting roles, including George Plimpton, the editor of \"The Paris Review\", who played the character of Horace Whigham. Jerzy Kosi\u0144ski, a Polish American novelist, was asked to play the role of Grigory Zinoviev, but he initially refused because he was a fierce anti-communist and feared that he might be abducted by the KGB if he went to Finland to film.\nThe Witnesses.\nTo gain perspective on the lives of Reed and Bryant, Beatty filmed interviews with a group of men and women, referred to only as \"The Witnesses\", as early as 1971. \"American Film\" identified the witnesses in its March 1982 issue.\nIn a capsule review for \"The New York Times\", film critic Vincent Canby refers to them as \"more than two dozen very, very old people, billed only as The Witnesses, whom Mr. Beatty interviewed about the Reeds and their long-gone times.\" He went on to say, \"More than anything else in \"Reds,\" these interviews give the film its poignant point of view and separate it from all other romantic adventure films ever made.\" \"The most evocative aspect of the presentation is a documentary enhancement \u2013 interviews with a number of venerable 'witnesses,' whose recollections of the period help to set the scene, bridge transitions and preserve a touching human perspective\", wrote Gary Arnold of \"The Washington Post\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFilming.\nWhen principal photography began in August 1979 the original intention was for a 15- to 16-week shoot, but it ultimately took one year. Filming took place in five countries and at various points the crew had to wait for snow to fall in Helsinki (and other parts of Finland), which stood in for the Soviet Union, and for rain to stop in Spain. Beatty asked the Soviet government for a permit to film in Moscow but was denied. A cottage in Kent was used to depict exteriors of the Reeds' home in Croton-on-Hudson, which in reality was a small early American saltbox house. The interior sets built at Twickenham Studios and EMI-Elstree Studios were also enlarged to evoke the \"flavor\" of the real home without reproducing it exactly.\nOther English locations included Frensham Ponds in Surrey, which stood in for Provincetown, the Smeaton Room of the Institution of Civil Engineers at One Great George Street for the Liberal Club meeting room in Portland, and the interior of Lancaster House for that of the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg. Another round of filming began in 1980 in New York City, Washington D.C., and Los Angeles, including Paramount Studios.\nThe Italian cinematographer Vittorio Storaro was banned from shooting the scenes shot in the U.S. after he was unable to gain an H-1B visa and because local trade unions blocked him from doing work on the film. The film encountered similar problems with trade unions in the United Kingdom, and had to hire a separate British crew and pay British actors enrolled in Equity at Screen Actors Guild-rate salaries in order to allow American actors to film scenes in the U.K. These trade disputes caused the film to run heavily over budget, but the studio ultimately recouped its costs after financing the film with a low-interest loan from Barclays as part of a tax-shelter plan. Later saying the film \"broke even, plus change\", Paramount head Barry Diller added, \"I'm proud we made \"Reds\". I'm also proud we protected ourselves in every way known to man\".\nActress Maureen Stapleton was due to begin shooting her scenes in London in November 1979, but she refused to take a plane because of a fear of flying. Because it was the wrong season for ocean liner travel, the production had to arrange for Stapleton to travel on a tramp steamer, which broke down in the North Atlantic and had to be towed to Amsterdam. This caused another unwelcome delay. Beatty would also not stop the camera between takes, letting it roll continuously, and insisted on a large number of takes. Paul Sorvino said he did as many as 70 takes for one scene; Stapleton had to do 80 takes of one scene, which caused her to say to Beatty, \"Are you out of your fucking mind?\"\nBeatty and Keaton's romantic relationship also began to deteriorate during filming. Peter Biskind wrote about the making of \"Reds\", \"Beatty's relationship with Keaton barely survived the shoot. It is always a dicey proposition when an actress works with a star or director\u2014both, in this case\u2014with whom she has an offscreen relationship. Keaton appeared in more scenes than any other actor save Beatty, and many of them were difficult ones, where she had to assay a wide range of feelings, from romantic passion to anger, and deliver several lengthy, complex, emotional speeches.\" George Plimpton once observed, \"Diane almost got broken. I thought [Beatty] was trying to break her into what Louise Bryant had been like with John Reed.\" Executive producer Simon Relph adds, \"It must have been a strain on their relationship because he was completely obsessive, relentless.\"\nPost-production.\nThe editing process began in early 1980, with as many as 65 people working on editing down and going over approximately 2.5 million feet of film. Post-production ended in November 1981, more than two years after the start of filming. Paramount stated that the final cost of the film was $32 million, the rough equivalent of $80 million in 2007 and $122 million in 2024.\nMusic.\nThe film introduced the song \"Goodbye for Now\", written by Stephen Sondheim, recorded by Jean-Pierre Rampal and Claude Bolling. The song was later recorded by Barbra Streisand for \"The Movie Album\" (2003).\nReception.\nReleased on December 4, 1981, \"Reds\" opened to widespread critical acclaim. Despite its political subject matter and limited promotion by Beatty, the film became the 13th-highest-grossing picture of 1981, grossing $40 million in U.S. box office revenues, a figure that does not include the film's foreign box office revenues or its substantial subsequent earnings in home video, worldwide broadcast and cable television, and subscription television and streaming services. Beatty later remarked that the film \"made a little money\" in box office returns. During the film's second and third weekends, there were concerns that it would become a massive flop like \"Heaven's Gate\", but it performed more strongly over the next month. The film was screened at the White House for President Ronald Reagan.\n\"Reds\" holds a 90% \"Fresh\" rating on the review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes based on 49 reviews, with an average rating of 7.90/10. The site's consensus reads, \"Brawny in both intellect and scope, \"Reds\" is an intimate epic that captures the tumult of revolutionary change and the passion of those navigating through it.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 76 out of 100 based on 15 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\nJohn Simon of the \"National Review\" wrote, \"Never exactly boring, sometimes entertaining, \"Reds\" is frequently irritating and finally disappointing\". \"Commentary\" published a largely negative review by Richard Grenier, who, among other things, saw the film as deliberately obscuring the protagonists' communist politics and as exaggerating Bryant's talent and accomplishments. Conversely, in a retrospective article for \"Jacobin\", Jim Poe called \"Reds\" \"one of the greatest and most faithful depictions of revolutionary politics\", praising its \"light touch and brisk storytelling\" for an epic, as well as its cinematography, shifts in mood and performances, in particular those of Keaton and Beatty.\nThe February 2020 issue of \"New York Magazine\" lists \"Reds\" as among \"The Best Movies That Lost Best Picture at the Oscars.\"\nAwards and nominations.\nThe film is recognized by the American Film Institute in these lists:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "45243", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45243", "title": "Chacmool", "text": "Mesoamerican sculpture\nA chacmool (also spelled chac-mool or Chac Mool) is a form of pre-Columbian Mesoamerican sculpture depicting a reclining figure with its head facing 90 degrees from the front, supporting itself on its elbows and supporting a bowl or a disk upon its stomach. These figures possibly symbolised slain warriors carrying offerings to the gods; the bowl upon the chest was used to hold sacrificial offerings, including pulque, tamales, tortillas, tobacco, turkeys, feathers, and incense. In Aztec examples, the receptacle is a cuauhxicalli (a stone bowl to receive sacrificed human hearts). Chacmools were often associated with sacrificial stones or thrones. The chacmool form of sculpture first appeared around the 9th century AD in the Valley of Mexico and the northern Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula.\nAztec chacmools bore water imagery and were associated with Tlaloc, the rain god. Their symbolism placed them on the frontier between the physical and supernatural realms, as intermediaries with the gods.\nForm.\nThe chacmool is a distinctive form of Mesoamerican sculpture representing a reclining figure with its head facing 90 degrees from the front, leaning on its elbows and supporting a bowl or a disk upon its chest. There is great variation among individual chacmools, with some possessing heads that are right-facing and others left-facing, and some with the heads facing upwards; some examples have movable heads. The figure may be lying on its back or on its side and the abdomen can be sunken below the level of the chest and knees or at the same level. Some chacmools were raised upon rectangular bases. Some of the figures are richly attired whilst others are almost naked.\nThe chacmools of Chichen Itza and Tula depict young men with warrior attributes, while the chacmools of Michoac\u00e1n depict elderly men with wrinkled faces and erect penises. A chacmool from Gu\u00e1cimo, Costa Rica, combines human and jaguar features and grips a bowl. The face of the figure looks upwards and the bowl was apparently used to grind foodstuffs.\nA wide variety of materials were used to sculpt chacmools, including limestone and hard metamorphic and igneous rock types. Other materials employed include ceramic and cement.\nDiscovery and naming.\nThe ancient name for these types of sculptures is unknown. The term \"chacmool\" is derived from the name \"Chaacmol,\" which Augustus Le Plongeon in 1875 gave to a sculpture that he and his wife Alice Dixon Le Plongeon excavated within the Temple of the Eagles and Jaguars at Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 in 1875; he translated \"Chaacmol\" from Yucatecan Mayan as the \"paw swift like thunder.\" Le Plongeon believed the statue, which he had found buried beneath the Platform of the Eagles and the Jaguars, depicted a former ruler of Chichen Itza. Le Plongeon's sponsor, Stephen Salisbury of Worcester, Massachusetts, published Le Plongeon's find, but revised the spelling to \"Chac-Mool.\"\nLe Plongeon sought permission from Mexico's president to display the statue at the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia in 1876, a request that was denied. In 1877 the Yucatecan government seized the statue and brought it to M\u00e9rida. Weeks later Yucat\u00e1n turned over the statue to the federal government, which brought it to Mexico City to the National Museum of Anthropology. Museum worker Jes\u00fas Sanchez realised that the Chichen Itza sculpture was stylistically similar to two sculptures from central Mexico and the wide occurrence of the form within Mesoamerica was first recognised. The 19th century discovery of chacmools in both central Mexico and the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula helped to promote the idea of a Toltec empire although the chacmool sculptures may have originated in the Maya region.\nAlthough the name \"chacmool\" was inappropriately applied, it has become a useful label to link stylistically similar sculptures from different regions and periods without imposing a unified interpretation. Besides these sites, the sculpture was also found in Michoac\u00e1n, where it is called Uaxanoti (The Seated One) in the Pur\u00e9pecha language.\nDistribution.\nExamples of chacmool sculptures have been found widely across Mesoamerica from Michoac\u00e1n in Mexico down to El Salvador. The earliest examples date from the Terminal Classic period of Mesoamerican chronology (c. AD 800\u2013900). Examples are known from the Postclassic Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan, from the central Mexican city of Tula and from the Maya city of Chichen Itza in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. Fourteen chacmools are known from Chichen Itza and twelve from Tula. The chacmool from the palace at Tula is dated to the Early Postclassic (c. AD 900\u20131200). Further examples are known from Acolman, Cempoala, Michoac\u00e1n, Quer\u00e9taro and Tlaxcala.\nIn Chichen Itza, only five of the fourteen chacmools were securely confirmed in architectural contexts, those in the Castillo, the Chacmool Temple, the North Colonnade, the Temple of the Little Tables and the Temple of the Warriors. The rest were found interred in or near important structures. The five that were found in secure architectural contexts were all placed within entrance areas near a ritual seat or throne. The chacmools in Tula also had an association with thrones or raised seating platforms, either in front of the throne or at the entrance to a chamber containing a throne.\nTwo chacmools have been recovered that were associated with the Great Temple of Tenochtitlan, the Aztec capital. The first was discovered in 1943, on the junction of Venustiano Carranza and Pino Suarez, about two blocks south of the temple itself. The second chacmool was excavated in the sacred precinct. This is the only fully polychrome chacmool that has been recovered anywhere; it had an open mouth and exposed teeth and stood in front of the temple of Tlaloc, the Aztec rain god; its sculpted bowl probably received heart and blood sacrifices. This latter sculpture is by far the older of the two.\nChacmools have been reported as far south as the Maya city of Quirigu\u00e1, near the Guatemalan border with Honduras. The Quirigu\u00e1 chacmool most likely dated to the Postclassic period and is stylistically similar to those of Tula rather than Chichen Itza. Two chacmools were reported from Tazumal, a Maya site in western El Salvador. A chacmool was excavated at Las Mercedes in Gu\u00e1cimo, Costa Rica.\nDating and origin.\nThe oldest chacmool ever discovered was the Terminal Classic. The form was unknown in such important Mesoamerican cities as Teotihuacan and Tikal. After the first appearance of the form, it was rapidly disseminated throughout Mesoamerica, spreading as far south as Costa Rica. Although a central Mexican origin is generally assumed, there are no antecedents pre-dating the Toltecs and the form is not present in central Mexican codices.\nThe positioning and context of the chacmool form do have antecedents in Classic Maya art and art historian Mary Ellen Miller has argued that the chacmool developed out of Classic period Maya imagery. No central Mexican chacmool has been found that clearly predates the Chichen Itza examples. However, Tula and Chichen Itza may have developed simultaneously with rapid communication of the chacmool form from one city to the other.\nThe wider variety of chacmool forms at Chichen Itza has also been used to support the development of the form there; no two possess identical form, dress and proportions. At Tula the chacmools have a standardised form with little variation in position or proportions. Miller has proposed that the chacmool developed out of Classic Maya iconography and underwent a transition into three dimensional sculpture at Chichen Itza, perhaps spurred by the influence of central Mexican sculptural forms. A chacmool from Costa Rica was dated by the excavators to approximately AD 1000.\nAztec Chacmool.\nDuring the 1930 excavation of Templo Mayor, the only fully polychrome chacmool to be found at that site was in its original context on the top level of the Tlaloc side (the rain god) of the temple. The position of this chacmool statue mirrored the position of the sacrificial stone on the Huitzilopochtli (the Aztecs' patron deity, associated with war) side of the temple. Archaeologist Eduardo Matos Moctezuma posits that this mirroring confirms his interpretation that the chacmool acted as an \"intermediary between the priest and the god, a divine messenger,\" in the same way the sacrificial stone on the Huitzilopochtli side does.\nThe pigment that remained on this chacmool sculpture was crucial to its identification, as it does not contain any sculpted iconography or symbols associated with the rain god Tlaloc. Archaeologists were able to create a reconstruction of the sculpture's original colors, which they then compared to pictographic representations of Tlaloc. This comparison confirmed that the polychrome chacmool discovered at Tlaloc's side of the Templo Mayor was a representation of the deity itself. Characteristics such as the \"\"chia\" circles on the cheeks, the circular gold pectoral medallion, and the color combination of the petticoat, as well as the black skin, the red hands and feet, and the white headdress and bangles\" echo the iconography of other depictions of Tlaloc. Art historians Leonardo Lopez Lujan and Giacomo Chiari argue that this \"confirms that there is symbolic continuity between the early and late Mexica [Aztec] chacmool,\" due to early Aztec chacmools containing iconographic nods to Tlaloc.\nA second chacmool discovery from the Templo Mayor, dating to a later period, displays iconographic features which are distinct from the larger corpus of chacmool figures but consistent with other sculptures (Tlaloc ritual vessels and bench reliefs) found in a similar context at the Templo Mayor. Whereas Tlaloc's eyes are generally represented with a round goggle-like frame, the later chacmool, the vessels, and the bench relief feature a rectangular eye frame within which almond eyes are engraved. All three sculptures also include large fangs at the corners of the god's mouth. The ornaments worn by the later chacmool and included in the vessels and the bench relief also differ from other representations of Tlaloc. The later chacmool, vessels, and bench relief sport oversized circular earspools, rather than the characteristic earspools with a square plug and central dangal; they are also adorned with a multistrand, beaded collar in which one strand has larger beads that have been interpreted to be hanging bells. The chacmool holds onto a \"cuauhxicalli\" vessel that is engraved with the face of Tlaloc, including the same rectangular eye and mouth features.\nIn 1942, archaeologists recovered another chacmool example located a few blocks away from the Templo Mayor. This chacmool has overt iconographic associations with Tlaloc, wearing his mask and holding a \"cuauhxicalli\" vessel whose top is carved with the face of Tlaloc (rather than being concave and able to hold something). He is wearing several strands of beaded necklaces, with the outer most ring containing oliva shells, which were a characteristic of Maya costuming. Another Maya influence can be seen in his headdress, which scholars Mary Miller and Marco Samayoa compare to a headdress worn by Maya king Shield Jaguar (also known as Itzamnaaj Bahlam III) of Yaxchilan. Perhaps the most interesting iconographic feature of this chacmool, however, is the large necklace pendant he wears, which Miller and Samayoa argue is a representation of an actual heirloom pendant. They suggest that the pendant was looted from a Maya site, probably \"from a stone vessel interred behind a chacmool\" and that \"its subject is probably the enthroned, resurrected Maize God.\" This association between chacmools and maize deities is rooted in Maya examples (from which the Aztecs were clearly drawing inspiration, as this example's headdress and shell necklace demonstrate), but does not necessarily mean that the Aztecs would have associated their chacmools with maize deities. In all likelihood, the Aztecs conceived of chacmools as being connected to Tlaloc, as it is his image and associated iconographic characteristics that cover the majority of discovered Aztec chacmools. This chacmool, for instance, features a carving of Tlaloc on its underside, the symbolic meaning of which Miller explores: \"With their undersides carved with aquatic symbols, these sculptures seem to float on water. This suspension suggests the liminal qualities of the messenger, the link between earth and supernaturals.\"\nInterpretations.\nThe meaning of the chacmool figures varied across time depending upon the geographical and cultural context. Chacmools do not appear to have been worshipped, since they are never found within inner sanctuary of temples or shrines; it appears to have rather been a piece of religious paraphernalia used by the priesthood in the course of their duties. Three uses have generally been attributed to chacmools.\nThe first interpretation is that the chacmool is an offering table (or \"tlamanalco\") to receive gifts such as pulque, tamales, tortillas, tobacco, turkeys, feathers and incense. The second is that the chacmool was a \"cuauhxicalli\" to receive blood and human hearts; this use is particularly relevant to the Aztecs, who used a \"cuauhxicalli\" bowl in place of the usual disc-altar. These bowls may have accepted these blood offerings directly or may have been holders for portable \"cuauhxicalli\" bowls that were placed within them. A chacmool from Tlaxcala has a bloodied heart sculpted on the underside, supporting this interpretation.\nIt has also been suggested that chacmools were used as a \"techcatl\", or sacrificial stone over which victims were stretched so their hearts could be cut from their chests. The \"Cr\u00f3nica Mexicayotl\" describes such a sacrificial stone as sculpted in the form of a person with a twisted head. \"Techcatl\" were not just used for human sacrifice, they were also used in the \"yacaxapotlaliztli\" ceremony, where the nose of a future ruler was pierced. Such rituals may also have been executed upon chacmools, and the presence of small nose jewels sculpted onto various chacmools at Chichen Itza and one at Tula has been used to support this idea.\nThe backward reclining figure of the chacmool presents a defenceless, passive appearance and has been likened by Miller to the positioning of captives in Classic period Maya sculpture and painting. Bent elbows and knees are common in depictions of Maya captives; the full-frontal view of the face is rare in Maya art except among representations of captives. The form of the Chichen Itza chacmools lacks the typical traits of Maya deities and most scholars have assumed that the iconography of Maya chacmools is equivalent to that of the central Mexican examples. Eduard Seler commented in the early 1960s that chacmools in Chichen Itza tended to be located in temple antechambers, where the bowl or disc gripped by the figure served to receive pulque as an offering.\nThe chacmools at Chichen Itza were found in a combination of chacmool, throne and serpent column; this chacmool-throne-serpent complex was associated with rulership during the Early Postclassic period. The original chacmool described by Le Plongeon in the 19th century included small images of the central Mexican deity Tlaloc on its ear ornaments. Among the Classic period Maya, such Tlaloc imagery was associated with war and human sacrifice. Associations between the rain god, war and human sacrifice may have continued into the Postclassic period as demonstrated by the chacmool within the Castillo at Chichen Itza, which bears small images of the Maya rain god Chaac on its ear ornaments. The chacmools at Tula, with contextual similarity to those at Chichen Itza, probably also represent war captives.\nThe lack of the representation of chacmools in Central Mexican codices has led to them being associated with a great variety of deities by scholars, including Cinteotl, Tezcatzoncatl and Tlaloc. Both of the chacmools from the Great Temple of Tenochtitlan were clearly associated with Tlaloc. The chacmool found two blocks south of the temple was sculpted with three images of the deity. These included an elaborate relief image of Tlaloc amongst aquatic symbols on the underside, one on the bowl that the figure grips and the last is the Tlaloc mask with characteristic goggles and fangs that is worn by the chacmool.\nThe fully polychrome chacmool found \"in situ\" in the Great Temple was associated with Tlaloc by its placement on the Tlaloc half of the double pyramid. A further Aztec chacmool was described in the 19th century; it is of uncertain origin but stylistically it is typical of Tenochtitlan. It is sculpted on the underside with aquatic imagery and the figure wears a goggle-and-fangs Tlaloc mask. Spanish observers reported the great quantity of human sacrifices during important ceremonies at the Great Temple and the chacmool was probably used during these rituals to symbolise the sacrificed captives as well as receive their blood.\nThe discs gripped by some chacmools may represent a mirror. Chacmools were placed in entrances in order to receive sacrificial offerings, including human blood and hearts. The aquatic imagery carved onto the underside of some of the figures symbolised that they were floating on water, on the frontier between the physical world and the supernatural realm. This suggests that chacmools acted as messengers between the mortal realm and that of the gods.\nCosta Rican chacmools gripped sculpted bowls; these chacmools also served ceremonial purposes although the bowl was used to grind foodstuffs.\nIn contemporary culture.\nThe short story \"Chac Mool\" by Mexican novelist Carlos Fuentes is found in his book \"Los d\u00edas enmascarados\" (), published in 1954. A man named Filiberto buys a chacmool for his art collection, and discovers that the stone is slowly becoming flesh. The idol eventually becomes fully human, dominating his life, causing flooding and other disasters. Filiberto dies by drowning. His story is found in a diary describing the terrors brought on by the idol, and his plans to escape. According to the author, this short story was inspired by news reports from 1952 when the lending of a representation of the Maya rain deity to a Mexican exhibition in Europe had coincided with wet weather there. The short story was included in the 2008 anthology \"Sun, Stone, and Shadows.\"\nIn Henry Moore's early examples of monumental reclining figures, the artist relied on the cast of a chacmool sculpture he saw in Paris. Commenting on the major impact chacmool sculpted figures had on his early career, Moore stated that \"Its stillness and alertness, a sense of readiness \u2013 and the whole presence of it, and the legs coming down like columns\" were characteristics that inspired his creations.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "45246", "revid": "40943757", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45246", "title": "Korn", "text": "American nu metal band\nKorn (stylized as Ko\u042fn) is an American nu metal band from Bakersfield, California, originally formed in 1993 by James \"Munky\" Shaffer, Reginald \"Fieldy\" Arvizu and David Silveria, who were members of the band L.A.P.D. Their current lineup features Shaffer (guitar), Brian \"Head\" Welch (guitar), Jonathan Davis (vocals), and Ray Luzier (drums), the last of whom replaced Silveria in 2007. The band is notable for pioneering and popularizing the nu metal genre.\nKorn made a demo tape, \"Neidermayer's Mind\", in 1993, which was distributed free to record companies and on request to members of the public. Their debut album \"Korn\" was released in 1994, followed by their commercial breakthrough, \"Life Is Peachy\", in 1996. The band first experienced mainstream success with \"Follow the Leader\" (1998) and \"Issues\" (1999), both of which debuted at number one on the \"Billboard\" 200. The band's mainstream success continued with \"Untouchables\" (2002); \"Take a Look in the Mirror\" (2003); and \"See You on the Other Side\" (2005).\nA compilation album, \"Greatest Hits Vol. 1\", was released in 2004, spanning a decade of singles and concluding the band's recording contract with Immortal Records and Epic Records. They signed to Virgin Records, releasing \"See You on the Other Side\" in 2005, and an untitled album in 2007. The band's other recent albums, \"\" (2010) and \"The Path of Totality\" (2011), were released via Roadrunner Records, with \"The Paradigm Shift\" (2013) being released via Prospect Park and Caroline Records. \"The Serenity of Suffering\" (2016) saw their return to Roadrunner Records, through which \"The Nothing\" was released on September 13, 2019. Their latest album, \"Requiem\", was released via Loma Vista Recordings on February 4, 2022.\nAs of 2021, Korn had sold more than 40 million records worldwide. Several of their releases have been certified gold, platinum or multi-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Fourteen of the band's official releases have peaked in the top ten of the \"Billboard\" 200, eight of which have peaked in the top five. Korn has earned two Grammy Awards out of eight nominations and two MTV Video Music Awards out of 11 nominations. Several of their music videos received substantial play on MTV's \"Total Request Live\", and were among the first to be retired on the show, including \"Got the Life\" and \"Freak on a Leash\".\nHistory.\nEarly years and formation (1989\u20131993).\nBefore Korn was formed, three of the original members of the band were associated with the band L.A.P.D.\u2013James Shaffer, Reginald Arvizu, and David Silveria. \nThe group originally consisted of Shaffer, Arvizu, and lead vocalist Richard Morrill; Silveria joined when he was 16. When the band moved from Bakersfield, California to Los Angeles, Silveria dropped out of high school and Shaffer stayed in Bakersfield. When Shaffer reunited with the band, they found a manager and released an EP entitled \"Love and Peace Dude\" in 1989 through Triple X Records. L.A.P.D. released their sole full-length studio album \"Who's Laughing Now\" on May 3, 1991. After the album's release, Morrill departed from the ensemble. The remaining trio were also briefly known as Creep, recording a demo with a singer named Corey before enlisting Brian Welch and Jonathan Davis to form the band that went on to become Korn.\nWhen thinking of a band name, someone suggested \"corn\", but the band rejected that name, but Shaffer later had the idea to spell the name with a \"K\" instead of a \"C\", and a backwards \"R\", so the band's name would appear as \"Ko\u042fn\". The idea of using a backwards \"R\" came from the logo of toy retailer Toys R Us, for which many of the band members had previously worked. Silveria explained the logo, designed by Davis, \"the music makes the name, because Korn's a dumb name. But once we get established, it makes the name cool.\"\nKorn rented a studio from Jeff Creath called Underground Chicken Sound, in Huntington Beach, California. While they were recording there, a crowd had been loitering outside the studio. The band began playing a prelude to a later song \"Clown\", attracting a larger crowd. Arvizu said the crowd gathered because it sounded so \"different.\" Korn started performing at gigs in the summer of 1993, with members saying that touring was a \"pain-in-the-ass.\" While in Huntington Beach, the band was spotted by Immortal Records A&amp;R employee Paul Pontius. Pontius would describe Korn's sound as \"the new genre of rock.\" In 1993, Korn released their first demo album, \"Neidermayer's Mind,\" which had very limited printing. It was not well received by critics or the public. It was released to record companies and to people who filled out a flyer given out at gigs they played for free with Biohazard and House of Pain. With this demo, Korn pioneered the nu metal sound, riffs, and rhythm.\n\"Korn\", \"Life Is Peachy\" and recognition (1994\u20131997).\nBy May 1994, Korn began recording their self-titled debut album with Ross Robinson. Recording was finished by the end of the following month, and on October 11, the band's debut album was released through Immortal Records (an Epic imprint label); it peaked at number one on the Billboard Heatseekers Albums chart and would eventually reach number 72 on the \"Billboard\" 200 in February 1996. The album received positive reviews by critics, and is said to have established the new wave of metal. As well as sparking the nu metal genre, it also started record producer Ross Robinson's music career and influenced bands such as Slipknot, Coal Chamber, and Limp Bizkit.\nAfter the band finished recording the album, they began touring with Biohazard and House of Pain. Their record company gave them enough money for their own tour bus. Korn's first gig was in Atlanta. About halfway through the tour, the bus that Korn's record company gave them stopped working, and the band had to find a new one. Their first tour was not very successful in promoting the album.\nKorn went on tour with hardcore punk band Sick of It All in January 1995. The band embarked on their first European tour, including at LA2 in London and L'Arapaho in Paris. Later that year, Korn was chosen alongside Deftones as direct support for Ozzy Osbourne. Korn's self-titled album went gold in the midst of the tour and was eventually certified two-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Aside from touring, Korn released four singles. \"Blind\" was released on August 1, 1994, and \"Shoots and Ladders\" was released on October 31, 1995. The latter received a Grammy nomination in 1997 for Best Metal Performance. \"Need To\" was also released in 1995, on April 8. The fourth and final single, \"Clown\", was released on February 2, 1996. \"Blind\" was the only single to chart, peaking at number 15 on the Canadian \"RPM\" Alternative 30.\nAfter the success of their debut, Korn decided to enter the studio again for a second album. By then, the band had created a large fan base, having played between 200 and 250 shows, and the expectations for their follow-up album were high. They went back into the studio in early April 1996 at Indigo Ranch Studios, Malibu, California.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\u2026We went in really fresh, and we wanted to get it done quickly to capture that energy. So it was probably about 60% knowing what I was going to play and 40% just playing whatever came to mind at that moment\u2026 It ended up really good, and it has a kind of energy I probably wouldn't have gotten if I'd worked everything out before hand.\nDavid Silveria on \"Life Is Peachy\"'s drum quality.\n\"Life Is Peachy\" was released October 15, 1996 and despite minimal radio airplay and television attention, the album debuted at number three on the \"Billboard\" 200, and peaked at number one in New Zealand. The album sold 106,000 copies in its first week. Jon Pareles from \"The New York Times\" said that the band was \"mad at everybody, including themselves.\" The album was certified double platinum in the United States, platinum in Australia, and gold in Canada.\nThe first single, \"No Place to Hide\", spawned a Grammy nomination for Best Metal Performance. \"A.D.I.D.A.S.\" was released as the second single on March 4, 1997. It became the band's first charting single on \"Billboard\", peaking at number 13 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart. The third single, \"Good God\", was released on July 14, 1997. A promotional disc was released in 1997 to promote both the band and the Life Is Peachy Tour featuring Incubus and the Urge and included three live tracks.\nKorn gained more popularity after co-headlining the Lollapalooza summer tour festival in 1997 with Tool. However, Korn was forced to stop touring after Shaffer was diagnosed with viral meningitis. The band remained relatively quiet during the end of the year, resting and setting new goals. The band then founded their own label, Elementree Records, to sign and introduce new bands to their fans. The label was run by Davis who first signed Orgy. Silveria influenced Davis to sign them.\nPrior to the release of 1998's \"Follow the Leader\", Gretchen Plewes, a Zeeland, Michigan high school assistant principal, said in an interview for a Michigan newspaper that Korn's music is \"indecent, vulgar, obscene and intends to be insulting\" after giving a student named Eric VanHoven a one-day suspension for wearing a shirt with the Korn logo. FM station WKLQ was filmed giving away hundreds of free Korn T-shirts, donated by the band outside the school. Ottawa County Police were called by the school, but they ended up helping handing out shirts. Korn filed a cease and desist order against Plewes and the school district for their comments. They also threatened a multimillion-dollar lawsuit, but dropped both actions due to the band members' personal lives. The period from 1993 to 1997 was embodied by wearing apparel that contained Adidas clothing brand.\n\"Follow the Leader\" and \"Issues\" (1998\u20132001).\nIn 1998, Korn signed a publishing contract with Warner Chappell Music. While Korn was waiting for a full partnership with Adidas (which had previously sponsored Run-DMC), the sportwear brand refused to sign a contract with Korn. In a contradictory argument, Adidas told them: \"We do sports, not music\". In 1998, Puma seized the opportunity and offered a $500,000 deal to Korn, including their music featured in Kevin Kerslake-directed advertisements. Korn accepted the contract; Davis said, \"That's more than Adidas ever did for us! It wasn't a sell-out thing. It was about respect.\"\nPrior to the release of the band's third album, Korn produced a weekly online TV show called \"KornTV,\" which documented the making of the record and featured special guests such as porn star Ron Jeremy, Limp Bizkit, and 311. The project also gave fans (nicknamed \"nibletz\") the chance to call in and ask the band questions, an approach that represented one of the first times a band utilized the Internet in such a way. Korn released their third album \"Follow the Leader\" on August 18, 1998, which featured a number of guest vocalists such as Ice Cube; Pharcyde member Tre Hardson; Fred Durst of Limp Bizkit; and actor Cheech Marin on the hidden track \"Earache My Eye\" (written by Marin himself).\nKorn launched a political campaign-styled tour to promote \"Follow the Leader\"\u2019s release, which took the group on a chartered jet all over North America. Band members talked to fans and answered questions during special \"fan conferences\" organized at every stop along the tour and signed autographs. Jim Rose of the Jim Rose Circus hosted the entire \"Kampaign\" tour.\nThe album was considered a complete success by the band, debuting at number one on the \"Billboard\" 200 with at least 268,000 copies sold in its first week of release and, among other singles, spawning two of their biggest singles: \"Got the Life\" and \"Freak on a Leash\". They both exposed Korn to a wider mainstream audience, with the music videos being mainstays on MTV's \"Total Request Live\". \"Got the Life\" was the show's very first \"retired\" video, with \"Freak on a Leash\" also reaching retirement several months later. In September 1998, Korn signed with a second music publisher, Zomba Music Group, through negotiations of the band's then-manager Jeff Kwatinetz (the former CEO of The Firm), along with co-founders Peter Katsis and Michael Green.\n\"Freak on a Leash\" won a Grammy for Best Music Video, Short Form, and received a nomination for Best Hard Rock Performance. The video also earned nine MTV Video Music Awards nominations for Video of the Year; Best Rock Video; Breakthrough Video; Best Direction; Best Special Effects; Best Art Direction; Best Cinematography; Best Editing; and Viewer's Choice. It eventually won two awards for Best Rock Video and for Best Editing. \"Freak on a Leash\" failed to enter the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, although it did manage to peak at number six on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart. \"Follow the Leader\" is considered by members of Korn to be the band's most commercially\u2013successful album, being certified five-times platinum by the RIAA and having sold almost 10 million copies worldwide.\nThe band's fourth album, \"Issues\", produced by Brendan O'Brien, was released on November 16, 1999, featuring cover art designed by Alfredo Carlos, who won an MTV contest held for the fans. \"Issues\" was released during a week of many highly anticipated records. It debuted at number one on the \"Billboard\" 200 with at least 573,000 copies sold, keeping Dr. Dre's second album \"2001\" and \"All the Way... A Decade of Song\" by C\u00e9line Dion from hitting number one.\nTo celebrate the album's release, the band performed the record in its entirety in front of a live audience at New York's historic Apollo Theater and broadcast the concert simultaneously across many radio stations. This performance marked the first performance by a rock band since Buddy Holly in the late 1950s. This special event featured the New York Police Department marching drum and bagpipe band conducted by Richard Gibbs, as well as a group of backup singers to enhance the more melodic choruses Davis used on the album. A snippet of \"Falling Away from Me\" was featured on RealVideo with a brief interpretive dance by bassist Reginald Arvizu, and also featured on their official website as an MP3 file, although its release was against the advice of its attorneys and the corporate establishment. The album was also promoted by the band's highly successful Sick and Twisted Tour.\nA little before Korn's album \"Issues\" was released, the band appeared on an episode of \"South Park\" titled \"Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery\", in which the first single from \"Issues\", \"Falling Away from Me\", was premiered. The single became Korn's first entry on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, reaching number 99. \"Make Me Bad\" was released as the album's second single in February 2000, peaking at number 14 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart. A third single, \"Somebody Someone\", followed with more moderate success.\nMusic videos were filmed for all three singles, with long-time friend Fred Durst directing \"Falling Away from Me\" and Martin Weisz directing a concept video for \"Make Me Bad\", as well as a performance-based video for \"Somebody Someone\", which featured CGI effects. Every video was a staple on \"Total Request Live\", two of which made it to retirement. \"Issues\" was described by Stephen Thomas Erlewine to be less hip hop-oriented than \"Follow the Leader\". It was certified three-times Platinum, following up the success of \"Follow the Leader\". In 2001, the brand PONY reappeared in the clothing industry and initiated a partnership with Korn.\n\"Untouchables\", \"Take a Look in the Mirror\" and Welch's departure (2002\u20132005).\nOn June 11, 2002, Korn re-emerged into the media with their fifth album \"Untouchables\". It debuted at number two on the \"Billboard\" 200 with 434,000 in sales. The band has blamed music piracy for the drop in sales, as an unmastered version of the album had leaked three months prior to its official release date. On April 2, 2002, the Opie and Anthony Show began airing songs from \"Untouchables\". After playing a few songs, the broadcasters received a cease-and-desist letter from Sony Music Entertainment. Opie and Anthony said \"The reason for the premature premiere was to infuriate a rival New York station, which disallows their in-studio guests to appear on 'The Opie and Anthony Show.'\" The release of this album was preceded by a show at the Hammerstein Ballroom in New York a day prior to the album's release broadcast digitally throughout movie theatres in the United States.\nThe album contained experiments and styles never previously attempted by Korn. AllMusic related: \"The band is far more experimental this time out, delivering Helmet-like ringing guitars that melt and morph into each other, a mix of Metallica-esque blastbeats and tight funk drumming from the constantly improving David Silveria, and memorable riffs that take the shape of dark sound structures and offer more than just a collection of chords.\" The first two music videos from \"Untouchables\", \"Here to Stay\" and \"Thoughtless\", were directed by the Hughes Brothers. \"Here to Stay\" earned Korn a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance. \"Here to Stay\" peaked at number 72 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. During an interview with Wall of Sound, Munky revealed the album was the band's most expensive to make, but it produced several of his favourite songs, including \"Thoughtless\" and \"Here To Stay\".\nDue to the album \"Untouchables\" leaking onto the Internet, \"Take a Look in the Mirror\" was released on Friday November 21, 2003\u2013 four days earlier than its original release date. The album therefore received a weekend's worth of sales, which resulted in a poor showing on the \"Billboard\" 200. During its first full week, \"Take a Look in the Mirror\" soared ten places from number 19 to number 9, increasing the album's total sales to 179,000.\nIt is the first album self-produced by Korn. The band explained that they wanted fans to hear the music as it should be. The album presented different styles and themes compared to previous albums. Lead vocalist Jonathan Davis related: \"The whole album is about love, hate and my hate of people and just losing my mind. The previous albums I did, I think the last three, I was coming from a place of hurt. And I just finally got to the point where I'm done hurting and I'm just pissed off about it now. It's turned back to just sheer hate and anger. And it definitely comes across on the album.\" MTV News said that Davis convinced his fans that they \"will be shocked, particularly with the album's second track, 'Break Some Off,' which he called 'brutal'.\"\nKorn released the single \"Did My Time\" on July 22, 2003, which was used to promote the film \"\" but did not appear on its soundtrack due to unspecified legal issues. The single debuted and peaked at number 38 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, becoming Korn's first and only top 40 hit in the United States. \"Did My Time\" gave Korn another Grammy nomination in the Best Metal Performance category.\nKorn released their greatest hits album, \"Greatest Hits Vol. 1\", on October 5, 2004. The album debuted at number four on \"Billboard\", selling more than 129,000 copies. This album assembles choice tracks from six Korn studio albums released between 1994 and 2003. The first single was a cover of the song \"Word Up!\" originally composed by Cameo. The single peaked at number 23 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart. Special editions of \"Greatest Hits Vol. 1\" included a DVD titled \"Korn: Live at CBGB,\" featuring seven select songs from their show of November 24, 2003 at CBGB.\nIn early 2005, Brian Welch announced that he would be quitting the band. In front of a crowd of 10,000 in three services at Valley Bible Fellowship in Bakersfield, California, Welch said \"I was addicted to methamphetamines and tried everything ... rehab, stuff on the Internet, but nothing helped me kick it. I was trying on my own to quit and couldn't do it. I wanted to die. No one knew what I was going through. I could not quit. Church was my last shot. I would sit in church high [on drugs]. I would wonder why people would go up to the front after the service. But one day it was for me. I said [to God], 'Show me how to quit.'\"\nIn a 2013 interview with \"Rolling Stone\", Head described his final moments in the band as very tense: \"the last year I was in the band, we were gonna kick out the bass player, Fieldy, and this guy's girlfriend couldn't be on this side of the stage because there were fights with another wife in the band. And obviously the drugs \u2013 it's no secret I was into the drugs, so crazy stuff, like having to finish our blow right before we got to the border because they were gonna come check to see if we had anything.\" Following his departure from Korn, Welch released two autobiographies, a solo album, and formed a band named Love and Death, which released a debut album in 2013.\n\"See You on the Other Side\" and Silveria's departure (2005\u20132007).\nUpon completing their record deal with Sony, Korn partnered with EMI and signed to Virgin Records. As part of this innovative arrangement, Virgin paid Korn $25\u00a0million upfront in exchange for a share in the profits of their next two studio albums, including tours and merchandising. Virgin also received a 30 percent stake in the band's licensing, ticket sales, and other revenue sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIt's taking Korn into another dimension for the listener, I think, that takes you to another world. I think it's really emotional, as far as it's not so anger-based. You know, I think it's a more well-rounded emotional journey it kinda takes you on, the listener.\nJames \"Munky\" Shaffer on \"See You on the Other Side\".\nThe band's first album for Virgin Records, \"See You on the Other Side\", was released on December 6, 2005, and debuted at number three on the \"Billboard\" 200, scanning close to 221,000 copies. The album managed to stay in the top half of the \"Billboard\" 200 for 34 consecutive weeks. The first single from the album, \"Twisted Transistor\", was accompanied by a music video directed by Dave Meyers in which hip hop artists Xzibit, Lil Jon, Snoop Dogg, and David Banner portray Korn. \"Twisted Transistor\" peaked at number 64 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. The second single, \"Coming Undone\", was released in February 2006, peaking at number 79 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. The music video was directed by Little X. \"See You on the Other Side\" was certified Platinum in the United States, and by mid-2007, the album had sold over 2.2\u00a0million copies worldwide.\nKorn held a press conference at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery on January 13, 2006, announcing the \"See You on the Other Side\" Tour. 10 Years and Mudvayne were selected to open all dates of the tour, which kicked off in their hometown of Bakersfield on what Mayor Harvey Hall officially declared as \"Korn Day\", February 24. The resurrection of their Family Values Tour was announced on April 18, 2006, which featured co-headliners Deftones, Stone Sour, Flyleaf, and the Japanese metal group Dir En Grey on the main stage. Korn and Evanescence co-headlined the 2007 edition, with Atreyu, Flyleaf, Hellyeah, and Trivium rounding out the main stage.\nWhile promoting \"See You on the Other Side\" in Europe, Jonathan Davis was diagnosed with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, a blood platelet disorder that hospitalized him for the weekend and prevented him from performing at the renowned Download Festival. Despite the illness, the band still performed with guest singers, including Corey Taylor of Slipknot and Stone Sour fame; Trivium's Matt Heafy; Skindred's Benji Webbe; and Avenged Sevenfold's M. Shadows. This led to Korn canceling the rest of their European bill for 2006, including the Hellfest Summer Open Air. It was originally unknown to the public what his ailment was, but the singer revealed in a letter to fans that he was \"dangerously low on blood platelets and at a high risk of death from a hemorrhage if the problem was not treated\".\nIn early December 2006 it was announced that founding drummer David Silveria would be taking an indefinite \"temporary hiatus\" from the band. Korn then performed at the MTV studios in Times Square on December 9, 2006, for the \"MTV Unplugged\" series, which was broadcast on February 23, 2007, through MTV.com and on March 2, 2007, across North American, South American, European, and Asian MTV stations. Korn played a 14-song acoustic set, complete with guest appearances by the Cure and Amy Lee of Evanescence. The performance was eventually cut down to 11 songs for the album, two of which did not air on MTV. Sales of nearly 51,000 brought \"\" to number nine in its first week out.\nUntitled eighth album, Luzier's addition and \"Korn III: Remember Who You Are\" (2007\u20132011).\nKorn's untitled album was released on July 31, 2007, debuting at number two on the \"Billboard\" 200 with 123,000 copies sold in its first week. The album was certified gold by the RIAA. It concluded Korn's deal with Virgin Records and features touring keyboardist Zac Baird. Drumming duties were left up to Terry Bozzio and Bad Religion's Brooks Wackerman, as David Silveria went on a hiatus. Joey Jordison from Slipknot played drums during Korn's live shows until the permanent addition of Ray Luzier (Army of Anyone, David Lee Roth). This confirmed David's departure.\"Evolution\" and \"Hold On\" were released as singles to promote the untitled album. The former peaked at number seven on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart. A third single, \"Kiss\", had a limited release in April 2008. Korn covered the song \"Kidnap the Sandy Claws\" in 2008, which was originally performed by Paul Reubens, Catherine O'Hara, and Danny Elfman and was released on the compilation album \"Nightmare Revisited\". Ubisoft reported in October 2008 that Korn had \"written and recorded an original song inspired by Ubisoft's \"Haze\" video game, simply entitled \"Haze\", which was released on April 22, 2008. Korn also released a live DVD, \"Live at Montreux 2004\", one of their performances with former guitarist Brian Welch on May 12, 2008.\nIn a YouTube video, bassist Reginald \"Fieldy\" Arvizu affirmed that a charity song titled \"A Song for Chi\" would be released, featuring Slipknot guitarist Jim Root; Clint Lowery of Sevendust; drummer Dave McClain of Machine Head; and former Korn guitarist Brian \"Head\" Welch, among many other musicians. The song was intended to raise money for Deftones bassist Chi Cheng, who fell into a comatose state following a car accident in November 2008.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n...\"Korn III: Remember Who You Are\" isn't a numbering device, it signifies an opening of another phase in Korn's career. Somehow, the band has bypassed a Korn II altogether in their discography, but it's commonly acknowledged that the tail-end of the 2000s found the group floundering a bit, going so far as to flirt with the Matrix in an attempt to figure out which direction to go now that they've hit middle age.\n Stephen Thomas Erlewine on \"\nAlong with the announcement of the Ballroom Blitz Tour in March 2010, the title for the new album was revealed as \"\". Later that month, Munky announced that Korn has officially signed to Roadrunner Records. Jonathan Davis later confirmed the record deal: \"We're going to go to Roadrunner. [It is] real exciting for us, too, because they're one of the last record companies to let you do what you want to do.\" Davis continued, \"All the great bands around are on that label and everything seems to just work out right and it seems like a good home for us right now.\" The lead single, \"Oildale\", was made available for streaming in May 2010. \"Oildale (Leave Me Alone)\" was simultaneously released to radio stations and became a top-10 hit on the \"Billboard\" Mainstream Rock airplay chart. A music video directed by Phil Mucci received an exclusive premiere on MTV2.\n\"Korn III: Remember Who You Are\" was released on July 13, 2010. It debuted and peaked at number two on the \"Billboard\" 200 with 63,000 purchases reported. A second single, \"Let the Guilt Go\", was released that same month, reaching number 23 on Mainstream Rock. \"Pop a Pill\" was scheduled to be the third single from \"Korn III: Remember Who You Are\", but plans were scrapped by Roadrunner Records due to unsatisfactory results with previous singles. Korn co-headlined the Music as a Weapon V tour with Disturbed in late 2010 and early 2011. The tour also featured supporting acts Sevendust and In This Moment.\n\"The Path of Totality\", \"The Paradigm Shift\" and Welch's return (2011\u20132015).\nKorn's tenth studio album, \"The Path of Totality\", was released on December 6, 2011. It was the second and final studio album for Roadrunner Records. The album features contributions from Skrillex; 12th Planet; Excision; Downlink; Kill the Noise; Noisia; and various other EDM artists. \"The Path of Totality\" debuted and peaked at number ten on the \"Billboard\" 200 with 55,000 copies scanned. \"Get Up!\" was premiered as the lead single via \"Spin\" in April 2011. The single managed to peak at number eight on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart. It eventually became their first single to be certified gold in the United States. The second single, \"Narcissistic Cannibal\", was released in October 2011, with its music video being directed and produced by Alexander Bulkley of ShadowMachine Films.\nAfter a stint of festival appearances, Korn promoted \"The Path of Totality\" during a headlining tour of the same name. Korn split their show into three sections. The band kicked off by playing tracks from their first two albums, including the B-side \"Proud\", which was originally included on the soundtrack to the 1997 film \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\". They followed with a different stage set up, playing several of their new songs. The set list ended with hit singles and an encore. Other appearances came from Datsik, Downlink, and Dope D.O.D. A special album release performance filmed and recorded at the Hollywood Palladium was issued in various formats through Shout! Factory in September 2012. \"The Path of Totality\" won Album of the Year at the 2012 Revolver Golden Gods Awards. This was Korn's first victory at the Golden Gods Awards, a ceremony that celebrates the best in hard rock and heavy metal music. Korn was also inducted into the Kerrang! Hall of Fame during the 2011 Kerrang! Awards. On May 5, 2012, guitarist Brian \"Head\" Welch joined Korn on stage at the Carolina Rebellion festival to play \"Blind\" for the first time since his departure. As recalled in the documentary DVD \"Reconciliation\", Welch's appearance was a spur-of-the-moment decision: Welch initially visited the festival because of his daughter, who was a fan of bands performing. Welch joined Red on stage for a song, and would eventually be persuaded to join his old bandmates in Korn for a meet and greet. Upon Korn preparing for the show, the guitar tech prepared an extra guitar and amplifier for Welch, \"just in case\".\nOn July 18, 2012, Jonathan Davis told Billboard.com that Korn was getting ready to start recording their eleventh studio album that would be released independently. It was also announced that their next album would not contain any dubstep influences like \"The Path of Totality\". Guitarist James \"Munky\" Shaffer stated in an interview with the \"Phoenix New Times\" that the new album would be heavier, with more aggressive \"in-your-face\" guitars and vocals. He went on to say that he would be using new recording techniques in the studio to give his riffs a fresh approach.\nIn November 2012, Mudvayne bassist Ryan Martinie toured Korn as a temporary replacement for Reginald Arvizu, who stayed at home during his wife's pregnancy. That month also saw the confirmation of Welch's return to the band. His comeback was initially thought to be temporary as he was only scheduled for two shows in June 2013 at Rock Am Ring and Rock Im Park, but Ray Luzier announced at the January 25 Sabian show during NAMM that Welch would be working the whole tour. In January 2013, techno artist Beta Traxx acknowledged he was working on a new Korn song for their upcoming album, which he commented would sound \"like the past and the future at the same time.\" Luzier affirmed that the album would be produced by Don Gilmore. The BK Entertainment Group updated their clients list on February 12 and attested that Korn had signed to their management's independent label - Prospect Park Productions. On June 1, Caroline Records added Korn to their roster confirming that the band have been signed on to a contract with the label; they are partnered with Korn's management Prospect Park. On February 18, 2013, Korn posted a photo showing Head as part of the line up, which escalated rumors that he was in the process to rejoin Korn permanently. This was confirmed by Head himself in May, when it was also confirmed that he had been recording as part of the band for their upcoming album.\nFieldy has said of the album \"Right now, I will tell you this\u00a0... we've done something we've never done before. Normally if we do a new Korn record, we'll normally put 12 or 13 songs and that's how many we make. This time we've made 20-plus songs, and we'll put the best of what we have on there, whatever the numbers end up being. We have so many to choose from, I think it's going to be a little extra special this time.\" Munky later confirmed this by saying that the band completed 25 songs and 15 of them would be put on the album. Head later elaborated that musically this was Korn's best album.\nKorn's eleventh studio album, \"The Paradigm Shift\", was released on October 8, 2013. Their first single, \"Never Never\" was set to be released August 12, 2013. The band recorded an episode of Guitar Center Sessions for DirecTV on September 11, 2013, which is scheduled to premiere November 1, 2013 on DirecTV Audience Channel. Korn will also be the latest act to be inducted into the world-famous Hollywood Rockwalk on October 8, 2013.\nThe band brought back their Family Values Tour as a one-day festival, on October 5, 2013. The venue and line up were revealed on September 3, 2013. The music video for \"Spike in My Veins\" was released on February 6, 2014. The band performed the entirety of their self-titled debut album on several occasions during 2015.\n\"The Serenity of Suffering\" and \"The Nothing\" (2015\u20132020).\nKorn soon began the process of writing new songs for a twelfth studio album. Guitarist Head described the music on the new album as \"heavier than anyone's heard us in a long time.\" Their twelfth studio album \"The Serenity of Suffering\" was released on October 21, 2016. On July 14, 2016, guitarist James \"Munky\" Shaffer revealed to \"Metal Hammer\" that Corey Taylor of Slipknot/Stone Sour would make a guest appearance on the new album. He also revealed Nick Raskulinecz as the album's producer. On July 16, 2016, Korn premiered a new song, \"Rotting in Vain\", at Chicago Open Air Festival.\nIn late 2016, Zac Baird left the live band after 10 years. Jules Venturini completed the tour before Davey Oberlin was brought into the band. It was later announced that Fieldy would be missing Korn's South American tour and Robert Trujillo's then-12-year-old son Tye was brought in to perform with the band for the tour's duration. In March 2018, Korn embarked on a Japanese tour with support from Deadly Apples, including a stop at Vans Warped Tour Japan. On May 15, 2018, Korn announced the dates of special shows in order to mark the 20th anniversary of their album \"Follow the Leader\". In order to mark the album's 20th anniversary, the band partnered with the clothing company Pleasures to release clothing merchandise dedicated to the album. In August 2018, Luzier reported via Instagram that Korn has begun the process of tracking drums for the upcoming thirteenth album. In a December 2018 interview to \"Revolver Magazine\", Welch revealed that the upcoming album was scheduled for release in fall 2019, with Nick Raskulinecz resuming production duties. He also stated some of the tracks had been co-written with John Feldmann and that the band had tracked demos with Travis Barker on drums.\nOn June 25, 2019, the band revealed that their latest album, \"The Nothing\", would be released on September 13, 2019, and unveiled its first single: \"You'll Never Find Me\". On August 2, the band released a brand new song from \"The Nothing\" called \"Cold\". On August 22, Korn announced their new album by playing a concert in multiplayer game AdventureQuest 3D, complete with in-game merchandise, a virtual meet-and-greet, and performing a new song on a digital stage. In July 2020, Korn released a cover of \"The Devil Went Down to Georgia\" by Charlie Daniels, who had died earlier that year. The cover was recorded during sessions for \"The Nothing\" and featured rapper Yelawolf and proceeds were donated to non-profit \"Awakening Youth\". During an interview with \"Wall of Sound\", Munky spoke about COVID ruining their plans to tour \"The Nothing\", stating \"It was kind of a fucking bummer, I gotta be honest man. I was so excited [with] that album. We put the artwork together, we designed the stages, we got everything ready to roll out, merch and all; you know everything a band does before they go on the road and promote an album.\"\n\"Requiem\", Fieldy's hiatus and upcoming fifteenth studio album (2021\u2013present).\nIn his first online interview of 2021, Brian Welch revealed that the band had plans for 2021 but was coy about what they were, hinting it had something to do with touring in a powerful way. On April 24, 2021, Korn released a one-off, online streaming event entitled \"Monumental\" that was filmed on the top of a parking structure at the \"Stranger Things: A Drive-Into Experience\" set in Los Angeles.\nOn May 12, the band announced a 28-date summer U.S. tour with Staind as the supporting act. The 2021 tour came after Korn was forced to cancel their planned 2020 run with Faith No More due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On June 21, the band announced that their bassist Arvizu would be taking a hiatus and wouldn't be performing with the band on their upcoming summer tour. Ra D\u00edaz of Suicidal Tendencies replaced Arvizu on the tour.\nThe tour was marred by several separate instances where members contracted COVID-19: first, Jonathan Davis tested positive in August, causing several dates to be postponed. Then in September, Munky was forced to sit out several dates, being replaced by Love and Death guitarist JR Bareis while he recovered. Lastly, in October Ray Luzier also tested positive, missing the next three shows while Fever 333 drummer Aric Improta stepped in.\nOn April 23, the band confirmed that they had begun work on a fourteenth studio album, utilizing the period of lockdown due to COVID-19 to begin writing. The album was said to be fully written as of April 2021. A new single was released November 11 entitled \"Start the Healing\", with the music video debuting in a YouTube premiere. On January 13, 2022, the band released the second single from the album entitled \"Forgotten\". The album \"Requiem\" was released on February 4, 2022. On April 21, 2022, the band released a music video for the song, \"Worst Is on Its Way\".\nShortly prior to the release of \"Requiem\", Davis revealed in an interview with Music Feeds that the band were already in the process of working on a follow-up studio album. Welch later stated in a September 2023 interview that a release of new material in 2024 was likely: \"Yeah, [there will be] new music coming out next year. I don't know. We're just kind of in hiding right now, just doing our own thing.\" Welch reiterated in late March 2024 that work was still underway, speaking positively regarding the content recorded thus far. In early December, he stated that while the majority of the album had been written, there were no plans to release anything in the immediate future. Shaffer reiterated once more in 2025 that recording is still underway.\nIn May of 2025, Fieldy clarified his current status with the band, stating that he does not anticipate returning to the band anytime soon.\nArtistry.\nStyle and instrumentation.\nKorn is identified as the pioneers of nu metal music, a form of alternative metal music which began in the mid-1990s. Less common labels applied at some point include heavy metal, rap rock, rap metal, funk metal, groove metal and hard rock. The band is characterized by a style that incorporates downtuned guitars, a groove-heavy rhythm section, haunted atmospheric production, and dark lyrics. Their lyrics focus on pain and personal alienation rather than traditional heavy metal themes.\nHistorically, when \"Life Is Peachy\" was released, the band's music was not yet labeled \"nu metal\". Thus, in November 1996, Korn was described as \"one of the key players in an American metal revival\" alongside Deftones, \"two bands that share the same roots\". In the music community, there have been disagreements whether the band should be considered as \"heavy metal\". In 2015, lead singer Jonathan Davis commented, \"Yeah, we're heavy and downtuned, but metal, to me, is like Judas Priest and Iron Maiden, that's metal man. I always thought of us as a funk band.\" Additionally, in an interview with Metal Hammer, Davis said that he had hated the \"nu metal\" tag. Korn is widely credited as the originators of the nu metal scene. It means that the genre was suddenly inundated with imitators of their sound.\nBassist Reginald Arvizu plays his instrument using both the techniques of fingerstyle and slapping. Jonathan Davis was said by author Doug Small to be \"the eye of the storm around which the music of Korn rages.\" Small described the band as \"a basket-case full of contradictions.\"\nLyrical themes.\nMany of Korn's first works are based on early experiences. The song \"Daddy\" was described by lead singer Jonathan Davis: \"When I was a kid, I was being abused by somebody else and I went to my parents and told them about it, and they thought I was lying and joking around. They never did shit about it. They didn't believe it was happening to their son... I don't really like to talk about that song. This is as much as I've ever talked about it...\" \"Kill You\" was written about Davis's experiences as a child with his stepmother. \"Follow the Leader\" marked the first album where the majority of the lyrics did not have origins relating to early occurrences, with songs like \"Justin\" and \"Pretty\" written about incidents occurring during adulthood.\nInfluences.\nA few years before establishing Korn, James \"Munky\" Shaffer; Reginald \"Fieldy\" Arvizu; and David Silveria (who were three members of the funk metal band L.A.P.D.), alongside friend Brian \"Head\" Welch, all had the common influences of Red Hot Chili Peppers and especially the Faith No More album \"The Real Thing\". Likewise, Davis was greatly inspired by the adventurousness of \"The Real Thing\" upon its 1989 release: \"It showed everybody you could do heavy music and not be 'metal'. It was something completely different.\"\nIn the \"Guitar World\" section \"The Album that Changed My Life\" of January 1997, Welch listed \"The Real Thing\" by Faith No More as the album that changed his life, while Arvizu named both the Red Hot Chili Peppers' \"Freaky Styley\" and Faith No More's \"Introduce Yourself\". Fieldy's biggest bass influences were Flea from Red Hot Chili Peppers and Les Claypool from Primus. He was also greatly inspired by Billy Gould's chemistry with his Faith No More bandmates and Stanley Clarke. In 2015, asked about what record has stuck with him through the years, Munky first named 1992's \"Angel Dust\" by Faith No More, followed by \"Evil Empire\" by Rage Against the Machine and \"The Fragile\" by Nine Inch Nails. For his part, David Silveria named Mike Bordin of Faith No More one of his biggest influences.\nMunky later acknowledged the song structures and instrumentations of Faith No More in inspiring Korn's future songwriting: \"Faith No More steered us in the direction where we ultimately ended up.\" They became \"fanatics\" of Faith No More singer Mike Patton, researched about him, and traveled to the band's hometown of San Francisco in order to watch them play. In this way, they discovered Patton's avant-garde metal band Mr. Bungle, whose 1991 self-titled album had a long-standing impact on Korn's experimentation, dissonance, and eccentric stylings. A notable example of Bungle's influence has been what Korn dubbed the \"Mr. Bungle chord\" (a flat fifth chord or \"tritone\"), which became a band trademark throughout their discography. Many reviewers point out stark similarities between the vocals of Davis and several techniques employed by Patton, such as those from \"Angel Dust\". Davis' rhythmic and aggressive singing was also based on toasting, a reggae/dancehall vocal style that emphasizes rhythm and embellishments.\nBesides the projects of Patton, Korn had a wide range of influences that included groove-oriented metal acts such as Sepultura, Prong, and Biohazard, in addition to the dynamics and live performances of Rage Against the Machine and its frontman Zack de la Rocha. Head later explained that they tried to mix the weird elements of Bungle with catchy choruses and melodies, alongside the songwriting and grooves from those metal bands. On the other hand, Fieldy discards any influence classic rock groups like The Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin have had on Korn; \"Nobody in the band ever listened to that stuff.\" However, Jonathan Davis acknowledged in 2022 that the song that first made him interested in rock music was Led Zeppelin's \"Whole Lotta Love\" (1969).\nGuitarist Munky and Head described their admiration for Steve Vai\u2019s ability to \"make the guitar talk,\" saying it inspired how they approached tone and expression. Head specifically pointed out that Munky\u2019s fascination with Vai\u2019s 7\u2011string work led him to get one, and eventually Head followed suit. That low-register sound helped define Korn\u2019s signature groove, a musical shift they credit directly to Vai.\nMuch of Korn's work has also been inspired by hip hop music, as suggested in the band's song \"All in the Family\" and the cover song of Ice Cube's \"Wicked\". The band imitated the samples used by Cypress Hill, with Davis going as far to say \"If there's no Cypress Hill there would be no Korn.\" The members of Korn are also influenced by Alice in Chains, Pantera, N.W.A, Bauhaus, Geto Boys, Van Halen, The Pharcyde, Nine Inch Nails, Deftones, and John Zorn.\nIn other media.\nThey have contributed music to the soundtracks for movies such as ', \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\", \"Spawn\", \"End of Days\", and '. The music of Korn has also been featured on various television series, including \"South Park\" (which they starred as guests), \"Beavis and Butt-head\", and \"Daria\".\nLegacy.\nThe band has sold over 40 million records worldwide as of 2021. Seven of their official releases are certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA); two are certified double platinum; one is certified triple platinum; one is certified five times platinum; and two are certified Gold. Fourteen of their records have reached the top 10 of the \"Billboard\" 200, with eight reaching the top five; they are tied with Van Halen for the most top 10 records as a rock or metal artist. The band has also won two Grammy Awards from eight nominations.\nKorn's debut album has been recognized for its influence on heavy music. Bands such as Coal Chamber and Limp Bizkit were inspired by the album's \"churning rage, emphasizing similar grooves and song structures\" and \"the sound's hip-hop elements.\" Slipknot, Machine Head, and Sepultura were also inspired by Korn's debut album. The album launched the career of record producer Ross Robinson, who later produced albums such as \"Three Dollar Bill, Yall\" by Limp Bizkit, Sepultura's \"Roots\" and Slipknot's first two albums. Amy Lee of Evanescence also cited Korn as an influence growing up. Mucc guitarist Miya said that Davis' intense personal expressions in Korn influenced him to do the same in his own music. Richard S. He of \"Billboard\" wrote: \"More than any other album, \"Follow the Leader\" opened the floodgates for countless nu-metal acts to infiltrate the mainstream.\" In the book \"Nu-metal: The Next Generation of Rock &amp; Punk\", Korn was marked as the third biggest nu metal band in the world. Korn created a fan-base described by Doug Small and Eaton Entertainment as extremely loyal.\nKorn's music videos received significant play on \"Total Request Live\", and alongside Limp Bizkit were credited with pitting the nu metal genre against pop acts such as Backstreet Boys, NSYNC and Britney Spears. The band's videos had often peaked at the third spot of the show's chart, which was dubbed \"the Korn spot\". Four of their videos had retired from the show. They have also earned two Video Music Awards from 11 nominations.\nBand members.\nCurrent\nFormer\nTouring\nTouring substitutes\nOfficial band members timeline\nTouring musicians timeline\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "45249", "revid": "50527213", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45249", "title": "User interface", "text": "Means by which a user interacts with and controls a machine\nIn the industrial design field of human\u2013computer interaction, a user interface (UI) is the space where interactions between humans and machines occur. The goal of this interaction is to allow effective operation and control of the machine from the human end, while the machine simultaneously feeds back information that aids the operators' decision-making process. Examples of this broad concept of user interfaces include the interactive aspects of computer operating systems, hand tools, heavy machinery operator controls and process controls. The design considerations applicable when creating user interfaces are related to, or involve such disciplines as, ergonomics and psychology.\nGenerally, the goal of user interface design is to produce a user interface that makes it easy, efficient, and enjoyable (user-friendly) to operate a machine in the way which produces the desired result (i.e. maximum usability). This generally means that the operator needs to provide minimal input to achieve the desired output, and also that the machine minimizes undesired outputs to the user.\nUser interfaces are composed of one or more layers, including a human\u2013machine interface (HMI) that typically interfaces machines with physical input hardware (such as keyboards, mice, or game pads) and output hardware (such as computer monitors, speakers, and printers). A device that implements an HMI is called a human interface device (HID). User interfaces that dispense with the physical movement of body parts as an intermediary step between the brain and the machine use no input or output devices except electrodes alone; they are called brain\u2013computer interfaces (BCIs) or brain\u2013machine interfaces (BMIs).\nOther terms for human\u2013machine interfaces are man\u2013machine interface (MMI) and, when the machine in question is a computer, human\u2013computer interface. Additional UI layers may interact with one or more human senses, including: tactile UI (touch), visual UI (sight), auditory UI (sound), olfactory UI (smell), equilibria UI (balance), and gustatory UI (taste).\nComposite user interfaces (CUIs) are UIs that interact with two or more senses. The most common CUI is a \"graphical user interface\" (GUI), which is composed of a tactile UI and a visual UI capable of displaying graphics. When sound is added to a GUI, it becomes a \"multimedia user interface\" (MUI). There are three broad categories of CUI: \"standard\", \"virtual\" and \"augmented\". Standard CUI use standard human interface devices like keyboards, mice, and computer monitors. When the CUI blocks out the real world to create a virtual reality, the CUI is virtual and uses a \"virtual reality interface\". When the CUI does not block out the real world and creates augmented reality, the CUI is augmented and uses an \"augmented reality interface\". When a UI interacts with all human senses, it is called a qualia interface, named after the theory of qualia. CUI may also be classified by how many senses they interact with as either an X-sense virtual reality interface or X-sense augmented reality interface, where X is the number of senses interfaced with. For example, a Smell-O-Vision is a 3-sense (3S) Standard CUI with visual display, sound and smells; when \"virtual reality interfaces\" interface with smells and touch it is said to be a 4-sense (4S) virtual reality interface; and when \"augmented reality interfaces\" interface with smells and touch it is said to be a 4-sense (4S) augmented reality interface.\nOverview.\nThe user interface or \"human\u2013machine interface\" is the part of the machine that handles the human\u2013machine interaction. Membrane switches, rubber keypads and touchscreens are examples of the physical part of the Human Machine Interface which we can see and touch.\nIn complex systems, the human\u2013machine interface is typically computerized. The term \"human\u2013computer interface\" refers to this kind of system. In the context of computing, the term typically extends as well to the software dedicated to control the physical elements used for human\u2013computer interaction.\nThe engineering of human\u2013machine interfaces is enhanced by considering ergonomics (human factors). The corresponding disciplines are human factors engineering (HFE) and usability engineering (UE) which is part of systems engineering.\nTools used for incorporating human factors in the interface design are developed based on knowledge of computer science, such as computer graphics, operating systems, programming languages. Nowadays, we use the expression graphical user interface for human\u2013machine interface on computers, as nearly all of them are now using graphics.\nMultimodal interfaces allow users to interact using more than one modality of user input.\nTerminology.\nThere is a difference between a user interface and an operator interface or a human\u2013machine interface (HMI).\nIn science fiction, HMI is sometimes used to refer to what is better described as a direct neural interface. However, this latter usage is seeing increasing application in the real-life use of (medical) prostheses\u2014the artificial extension that replaces a missing body part (e.g., cochlear implants).\nIn some circumstances, computers might observe the user and react according to their actions without specific commands. A means of tracking parts of the body is required, and sensors noting the position of the head, direction of gaze and so on have been used experimentally. This is particularly relevant to immersive interfaces.\nHistory.\nThe history of user interfaces can be divided into the following phases according to the dominant type of user interface:\n1945\u20131968: Batch interface.\nIn the batch era, computing power was extremely scarce and expensive. User interfaces were rudimentary. Users had to accommodate computers rather than the other way around; user interfaces were considered overhead, and software was designed to keep the processor at maximum utilization with as little overhead as possible.\nThe input side of the user interfaces for batch machines was mainly punched cards or equivalent media like paper tape. The output side added line printers to these media. With the limited exception of the system operator's console, human beings did not interact with batch machines in real time at all.\nSubmitting a job to a batch machine involved first preparing a deck of punched cards that described a program and its dataset. The program cards were not punched on the computer itself but on keypunches, specialized, typewriter-like machines that were notoriously bulky, unforgiving, and prone to mechanical failure. The software interface was similarly unforgiving, with very strict syntaxes designed to be parsed by the smallest possible compilers and interpreters.\nOnce the cards were punched, one would drop them in a job queue and wait. Eventually, operators would feed the deck to the computer, perhaps mounting magnetic tapes to supply another dataset or helper software. The job would generate a printout, containing final results or an abort notice with an attached error log. Successful runs might also write a result on magnetic tape or generate some data cards to be used in a later computation.\nThe turnaround time for a single job often spanned entire days. If one was very lucky, it might be hours; there was no real-time response. But there were worse fates than the card queue; some computers required an even more tedious and error-prone process of toggling in programs in binary code using console switches. The very earliest machines had to be partly rewired to incorporate program logic into themselves, using devices known as plugboards.\nEarly batch systems gave the currently running job the entire computer; program decks and tapes had to include what we would now think of as operating system code to talk to I/O devices and do whatever other housekeeping was needed. Midway through the batch period, after 1957, various groups began to experiment with so-called \"load-and-go\" systems. These used a monitor program which was always resident on the computer. Programs could call the monitor for services. Another function of the monitor was to do better error checking on submitted jobs, catching errors earlier and more intelligently and generating more useful feedback to the users. Thus, monitors represented the first step towards both operating systems and explicitly designed user interfaces.\n1969\u2013present: Command-line user interface.\nCommand-line interfaces (CLIs) evolved from batch monitors connected to the system console. Their interaction model was a series of request-response transactions, with requests expressed as textual commands in a specialized vocabulary. Latency was far lower than for batch systems, dropping from days or hours to seconds. Accordingly, command-line systems allowed the user to change their mind about later stages of the transaction in response to real-time or near-real-time feedback on earlier results. Software could be exploratory and interactive in ways not possible before. But these interfaces still placed a relatively heavy mnemonic load on the user, requiring a serious investment of effort and learning time to master.\nThe earliest command-line systems combined teleprinters with computers, adapting a mature technology that had proven effective for mediating the transfer of information over wires between human beings. Teleprinters had originally been invented as devices for automatic telegraph transmission and reception; they had a history going back to 1902 and had already become well-established in newsrooms and elsewhere by 1920. In reusing them, economy was certainly a consideration, but psychology and the rule of least surprise mattered as well; teleprinters provided a point of interface with the system that was familiar to many engineers and users.\nThe widespread adoption of video-display terminals (VDTs) in the mid-1970s ushered in the second phase of command-line systems. These cut latency further, because characters could be thrown on the phosphor dots of a screen more quickly than a printer head or carriage can move. They helped quell conservative resistance to interactive programming by cutting ink and paper consumables out of the cost picture, and were to the first TV generation of the late 1950s and 60s even more iconic and comfortable than teleprinters had been to the computer pioneers of the 1940s.\nJust as importantly, the existence of an accessible screen\u2014a two-dimensional display of text that could be rapidly and reversibly modified\u2014made it economical for software designers to deploy interfaces that could be described as visual rather than textual. The pioneering applications of this kind were computer games and text editors; close descendants of some of the earliest specimens, such as rogue(6), and vi(1), are still a live part of Unix tradition.\n1985: SAA user interface or text-based user interface.\nIn 1985, with the beginning of Microsoft Windows and other graphical user interfaces, IBM created what is called the Systems Application Architecture (SAA) standard which include the Common User Access (CUA) derivative. CUA successfully created what we know and use today in Windows, and most of the more recent MS-DOS or Windows Console Applications will use that standard as well.\nThis defined that a pulldown menu system should be at the top of the screen, status bar at the bottom, shortcut keys should stay the same for all common functionality (F2 to Open for example would work in all applications that followed the SAA standard). This greatly helped the speed at which users could learn an application so it caught on quick and became an industry standard.\nInterface design.\nPrimary methods used in the interface design include prototyping and simulation.\nTypical human\u2013machine interface design consists of the following stages: interaction specification, interface software specification and prototyping:\nPrinciples of quality.\nIn broad terms, interfaces generally regarded as user friendly, efficient, intuitive, etc. are typified by one or more particular qualities. For the purpose of example, a non-exhaustive list of such characteristics follows:\nPrinciple of least astonishment.\nThe principle of least astonishment (POLA) is a general principle in the design of all kinds of interfaces. It is based on the idea that human beings can only pay full attention to one thing at one time, leading to the conclusion that novelty should be minimized.\nPrinciple of habit formation.\nIf an interface is used persistently, the user will unavoidably develop habits for using the interface. The designer's role can thus be characterized as ensuring the user forms good habits. If the designer is experienced with other interfaces, they will similarly develop habits, and often make unconscious assumptions regarding how the user will interact with the interface.\nA model of design criteria: User Experience Honeycomb.\nPeter Morville of Google designed the User Experience Honeycomb framework in 2004 when leading operations in user interface design. The framework was created to guide user interface design. It would act as a guideline for many web development students for a decade.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Created by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. to refine the bad tendency test, it was never fully adopted and both tests were ultimately replaced in 1969 with \"Brandenburg v. Ohio\"'s \"imminent lawless action\" test.\nHistory.\nBefore the 20th century, most restrictions on free speech issues in the United States were imposed to prevent certain types of speech. Although certain kinds of speech continue to be prohibited in advance, dangerous speech started to be punished after the fact in the early 1900s, at a time when US courts primarily relied on a doctrine known as the \"bad tendency test\". Rooted in English common law, the test permitted speech to be outlawed if it had a tendency to harm public welfare.\nAntiwar protests during World War I gave rise to several important free speech cases related to sedition and inciting violence. In the 1919 case \"Schenck v. United States\", the Supreme Court held that an antiwar activist did not have a First Amendment right to advocate draft resistance. In his majority opinion, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. introduced the \"clear and present danger test\", which would become an important concept in First Amendment law:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The question in every case is whether the words used are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils that the United States Congress has a right to prevent. It is a question of proximity and degree. When a nation is at war, many things that might be said in time of peace are such a hindrance to its effort that their utterance will not be endured so long as men fight, and that no Court could regard them as protected by any constitutional right.\nIn \"Frohwerk v. United States\" (1919) Justice Holmes summarized comments critical of U.S. wartime policies written by a newspaperman and stated about these comments the following: \"It may be that all this might be said or written even in time of war in circumstances that would not make it a crime. We do not lose our right to condemn either measures or men because the country is at war.\" This statement \"represents an important addendum to the original explication of the clear and present danger test in that it specifies that even during war, courts should regard criticism of government policies and officials as protected speech.\"\nThe \"Schenck\" decision did not formally adopt the clear and present danger test. Holmes later wrote that he intended the clear and present danger test to refine, not replace, the bad tendency test. Although sometimes mentioned in subsequent rulings, the \"clear and present danger test\" was never endorsed by the Supreme Court as a test to be used by lower courts when evaluating the constitutionality of legislation that regulated speech.\nThe Court continued to use the bad tendency test during the early 20th century in cases such as 1919's \"Abrams v. United States\", which upheld the conviction of antiwar activists who passed out leaflets encouraging workers to impede the war effort. In \"Abrams\", Holmes and Justice Brandeis dissented and encouraged the use of the clear and present test, which provided more protection for speech. In 1925's \"Gitlow v. New York\", the Court made the First Amendment applicable against the states and upheld the conviction of Gitlow for publishing the \"Left wing manifesto\". \"Gitlow\" was decided based on the bad tendency test, but the majority decision acknowledged the validity of the clear and present danger test, yet concluded that its use was limited to \"Schenck\"-like situations where the speech was not specifically outlawed by the legislature.\nBrandeis and Holmes again promoted the clear and present danger test, this time in a concurring opinion in 1927's \"Whitney v. California\" decision. The majority did not adopt or use the clear and present danger test, but the concurring opinion encouraged the Court to support greater protections for speech, and it suggested that \"imminent danger\"\u00a0\u2013 a more restrictive wording than \"present danger\"\u00a0\u2013 should be required before speech can be outlawed. After \"Whitney\", the bad tendency test continued to be used by the Court in cases such as \"Stromberg v. California\", which held that a 1919 California statute banning red flags was unconstitutional.\nThe clear and present danger test was invoked by the majority in the 1940 \"Thornhill v. Alabama\" decision in which a state anti-picketing law was invalidated. Although the Court referred to the clear and present danger test in a few decisions following \"Thornhill\", the bad tendency test was not explicitly overruled, and the clear and present danger test was not applied in several subsequent free speech cases involving incitement to violence. The importance of freedom of speech in the context of \"clear and present danger\" was emphasized in \"Terminiello v. City of Chicago\" (1949), in which the Supreme Court noted that the vitality of civil and political institutions in society depends on free discussion. Democracy requires free speech because it is only through free debate and free exchange of ideas that government remains responsive to the will of the people and peaceful change is effected. Restrictions on free speech are permissible only when the speech at issue is likely to produce a clear and present danger of a serious substantive evil that rises far above public inconvenience, annoyance, or unrest. Justice William O. Douglas wrote for the Court that \"a function of free speech under our system is to invite dispute. It may indeed best serve its high purpose when it induces a condition of unrest, creates dissatisfaction with conditions as they are, or even stirs people to anger.\"\n\"Dennis v. United States\".\nIn May 1950, one month before the appeals court heard oral arguments in the \"Dennis v. United States\" case, the Supreme Court ruled on free speech issues in \"American Communications Association v. Douds\". In that case, the Court considered the clear and present danger test, but rejected it as too mechanical and instead introduced a balancing test. The federal appeals court heard oral arguments in the CPUSA case on June\u00a021\u201323, 1950. Judge Learned Hand considered the clear and present danger test, but his opinion adopted a balancing approach similar to that suggested in \"American Communications Association v. Douds\".\nThe defendants appealed the Second Circuit's decision to the Supreme Court in \"Dennis v. United States\". The 6\u20132 decision was issued on June 4, 1951, and upheld Hand's decision. Chief Justice Fred Vinson's opinion stated that the First Amendment does not require that the government must wait \"until the putsch is about to be executed, the plans have been laid and the signal is awaited\" before it interrupts seditious plots. In his opinion, Vinson endorsed the balancing approach used by Judge Hand:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Chief Judge Learned Hand ... interpreted the [clear and present danger] phrase as follows: 'In each case, [courts] must ask whether the gravity of the \"evil\", discounted by its improbability, justifies such invasion of free speech as is necessary to avoid the danger.' We adopt this statement of the rule. As articulated by Chief Judge Hand, it is as succinct and inclusive as any other we might devise at this time. It takes into consideration those factors which we deem relevant, and relates their significances. More we cannot expect from words.\nImportance.\nFollowing \"Schenck v. United States\", \"clear and present danger\" became both a public metaphor for First Amendment speech and a standard test in cases before the Court where a United States law limits a citizen's First Amendment rights; the law is deemed to be constitutional if it can be shown that the language it prohibits poses a \"clear and present danger\". However, the \"clear and present danger\" criterion of the \"Schenck\" decision was replaced in 1969 by \"Brandenburg v. Ohio\", and the test refined to determining whether the speech would provoke an \"imminent lawless action\".\nThe vast majority of legal scholars have concluded that in writing the \"Schenck\" opinion, Justice Holmes never meant to replace the \"bad tendency\" test which had been established in the 1868 English case \"R. v. Hicklin\" and incorporated into American jurisprudence in the 1904 Supreme Court case \"U.S. ex rel. Turner v. Williams\". This is demonstrated by the use of the word \"tendency\" in \"Schenck\" itself, a paragraph in \"Schenck\" explaining that the success of speech in causing the actual harm was not a prerequisite for conviction, and use of the bad-tendency test in the simultaneous \"Frohwerk v. United States\" and \"Debs v. United States\" decisions (both of which cite \"Schenck\" without using the words \"clear and present danger\").\nHowever, a subsequent essay by Zechariah Chafee titled \"Freedom of Speech in War Time\" argued despite context that Holmes had intended to substitute clear and present danger for the bad-tendency standard a more protective standard of free speech. Bad tendency was a far more ambiguous standard where speech could be punished even in the absence of identifiable danger, and as such was strongly opposed by the fledgling American Civil Liberties Union and other libertarians of the time.\nHaving read Chafee's article, Holmes decided to retroactively reinterpret what he had meant by \"clear and present danger\" and accepted Chafee's characterization of the new test in his dissent in \"Abrams v. United States\" just six months after \"Schenck\". \"Schenck\", \"Frohwerk\", and \"Debs\" all resulted in unanimous decisions, while \"Abrams\" did not.\nBrandenburg.\nFor two decades after the \"Dennis\" decision, free speech issues related to advocacy of violence were decided using balancing tests such as the one initially articulated in \"Dennis\". In 1969, the court established stronger protections for speech in the landmark case \"Brandenburg v. Ohio\", which held that \"the constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not permit a State to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action\". \"Brandenburg\" is now the standard applied by the Court to free speech issues related to advocacy of violence.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Biosafety is used to protect from harmful incidents. Many laboratories handling biohazards employ an ongoing risk management assessment and enforcement process for biosafety. Failures to follow such protocols can lead to increased risk of exposure to biohazards or pathogens. Human error and poor technique contribute to unnecessary exposure and compromise the best safeguards set into place for protection.\nThe international Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety deals primarily with the agricultural definition but many advocacy groups seek to expand it to include post-genetic threats: new molecules, artificial life forms, and even robots which may compete directly in the natural food chain.\nBiosafety in agriculture, chemistry, medicine, exobiology and beyond will likely require the application of the precautionary principle, and a new definition focused on the biological nature of the threatened organism rather than the nature of the threat.\nWhen biological warfare or new, currently hypothetical, threats (i.e., robots, new artificial bacteria) are considered, biosafety precautions are generally not sufficient. The new field of biosecurity addresses these complex threats.\nBiosafety level refers to the stringency of biocontainment precautions deemed necessary by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for laboratory work with infectious materials.\nTypically, institutions that experiment with or create potentially harmful biological material will have a committee or board of supervisors that is in charge of the institution's biosafety. They create and monitor the biosafety standards that must be met by labs in order to prevent the accidental release of potentially destructive biological material. (In the US, several groups are involved, but there is no unifying regulatory authority for all labs.)\nBiosafety is related to several fields:\nHazards.\nChemical hazards typically found in laboratory settings include carcinogens, toxins, irritants, corrosives, and sensitizers. Biological hazards include viruses, bacteria, fungi, prions, and biologically derived toxins, which may be present in body fluids and tissue, cell culture specimens, and laboratory animals. Routes of exposure for chemical and biological hazards include inhalation, ingestion, skin contact, and eye contact.\nPhysical hazards include ergonomic hazards, ionizing and non-ionizing radiation, and noise hazards. Additional safety hazards include burns and cuts from autoclaves, injuries from centrifuges, compressed gas leaks, cold burns from cryogens, electrical hazards, fires, injuries from machinery, and falls.\nIn synthetic biology.\nA complete understanding of experimental risks associated with synthetic biology is helping to enforce the knowledge and effectiveness of biosafety.\nWith the potential future creation of man-made unicellular organisms, some are beginning to consider the effect that these organisms will have on biomass already present. Scientists estimate that within the next few decades, organism design will be sophisticated enough to accomplish tasks such as creating biofuels and lowering the levels of harmful substances in the atmosphere. Scientist that favor the development of synthetic biology claim that the use of biosafety mechanisms such as suicide genes and nutrient dependencies will ensure the organisms cannot survive outside of the lab setting in which they were originally created. Organizations like the ETC Group argue that regulations should control the creation of organisms that could potentially harm existing life. They also argue that the development of these organisms will simply shift the consumption of petroleum to the utilization of biomass in order to create energy. These organisms can harm existing life by affecting the prey/predator food chain, reproduction between species, as well as competition against other species (species at risk, or act as an invasive species).\nSynthetic vaccines are now being produced in the lab. These have caused a lot of excitement in the pharmaceutical industry as they will be cheaper to produce, allow quicker production, as well as enhance the knowledge of virology and immunology.\nIn medicine, healthcare settings and laboratories.\nBiosafety, in medicine and health care settings, specifically refers to proper handling of organs or tissues from biological origin, or genetic therapy products, viruses with respect to the environment, to ensure the safety of health care workers, researchers, lab staff, patients, and the general public. Laboratories are assigned a biosafety level numbered 1 through 4 based on their potential biohazard risk level. The employing authority, through the laboratory director, is responsible for ensuring that there is adequate surveillance of the health of laboratory personnel. The objective of such surveillance is to monitor for occupationally acquired diseases. The World Health Organization attributes human error and poor technique as the primary cause of mishandling of biohazardous materials.\nBiosafety is also becoming a global concern and requires multilevel resources and international collaboration to monitor, prevent and correct accidents from unintended and malicious release and also to prevent that bioterrorists get their hands-on biologics sample to create biologic weapons of mass destruction. Even people outside of the health sector needs to be involved as in the case of the Ebola outbreak the impact that it had on businesses and travel required that private sectors, international banks together pledged more than $2 billion to combat the epidemic. The bureau of international Security and nonproliferation (ISN) is responsible for managing a broad range of U.S. nonproliferation policies, programs, agreements, and initiatives, and biological weapon is one their concerns\nBiosafety has its risks and benefits. All stakeholders must try to find a balance between cost-effectiveness of safety measures and use evidence-based safety practices and recommendations, measure the outcomes and consistently reevaluate the potential benefits that biosafety represents for human health.\nBiosafety level designations are based on a composite of the design features, construction, containment facilities, equipment, practices and operational procedures required for working with agents from the various risk groups.\nIn particular, there is a concern that so-called \"gain-of-function research\" can pose risks regarding biosafety and biosecurity.\nClassification of biohazardous materials is subjective and the risk assessment is determined by the individuals most familiar with the specific characteristics of the organism. There are several factors taken into account when assessing an organism and the classification process.\nSee World Health Organization Biosafety Laboratory Guidelines (4th edition, 2020): https://\nInvestigations have shown that there are hundreds of unreported biosafety accidents, with laboratories self-policing the handling of biohazardous materials and lack of reporting. Poor record keeping, improper disposal, and mishandling biohazardous materials result in increased risks of biochemical contamination for both the public and environment.\nAlong with the precautions taken during the handling process of biohazardous materials, the World Health Organization recommends: \nStaff training should always include information on safe methods for highly hazardous procedures that are commonly encountered by all laboratory personnel, and which involve:\nBiosafety management in laboratory.\nFirst of all the laboratory director, who holds immediate responsibility for the laboratory, is tasked with ensuring the development and adoption of a biosafety management plan as well as a safety or operations manual. Secondly, the laboratory supervisor, who reports to the laboratory director, is responsible for organizing regular training sessions on laboratory safety.\nThe third point, the personnel must be informed about any special hazards and be required to review the safety or operations manual and adhere to established practices and procedures. The laboratory supervisor is responsible for ensuring that all personnel have a clear understanding of these guidelines, and a copy of the safety or operations manual should be readily available within the laboratory. Finally, adequate medical assessment, monitoring, and treatment must be made available to all personnel when needed, and comprehensive medical records should be maintained.\nPolicy and practice in the United States.\nLegal information.\nIn June 2009, the Trans-Federal Task Force on Optimizing Biosafety and Biocontainment Oversight recommended the formation of an agency to coordinate high safety risk level labs (3 and 4), and voluntary, non-punitive measures for incident reporting. However, it is unclear as to what changes may or may not have been implemented following their recommendations.\nUnited States Code of Federal Regulations.\nThe United States Code of Federal Regulations is the codification (law), or collection of laws specific to a specific to a jurisdiction that represent broad areas subject to federal regulation. Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations addresses laws concerning Public Health issues including biosafety which can be found under the citation 42 CFR 73 to 42 CFR 73.21 by accessing the US Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) website.\nTitle 42 Section 73 of the CFR addresses specific aspects of biosafety including occupational safety and health, transportation of biohazardous materials and safety plans for laboratories using potential biohazards. While biocontainment, as defined in the Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories and Primary Containment for Biohazards: Selection, Installation and Use of Biosafety Cabinets manuals available at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website much of the design, implementation and monitoring of protocols are left up to state and local authorities.\nThe United States CFR states \"An individual or entity required to register [as a user of biological agents] must develop and implement a written biosafety plan that is commensurate with the risk of the select agent or toxin\" which is followed by three recommended sources for laboratory reference:\nWhile clearly the needs of biocontainment and biosafety measures vary across government, academic and private industry laboratories, biological agents pose similar risks independent of their locale. Laws relating to biosafety are not easily accessible and there are few federal regulations that are readily available for a potential trainee to reference outside of the publications recommended in 42 CFR 73.12. Therefore, training is the responsibility of lab employers and is not consistent across various laboratory types thereby increasing the risk of accidental release of biological hazards that pose serious health threats to the humans, animals and the ecosystem as a whole.\nAgency guidance.\nMany government agencies have made guidelines and recommendations in an effort to increase biosafety measures across laboratories in the United States. Agencies involved in producing policies surrounding biosafety within a hospital, pharmacy or clinical research laboratory include: the CDC, FDA, USDA, DHHS, DoT, EPA and potentially other local organizations including public health departments. The federal government does set some standards and recommendations for States to meet their standards, most of which fall under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. but currently, there is no single federal regulating agency directly responsible for ensuring the safety of biohazardous handling, storage, identification, clean-up and disposal. In addition to the CDC, the Environmental Protection Agency has some of the most accessible information on ecological impacts of biohazards, how to handle spills, reporting guidelines and proper disposal of agents dangerous to the environment. Many of these agencies have their own manuals and guidance documents relating to training and certain aspects of biosafety directly tied to their agency's scope, including transportation, storage and handling of blood borne pathogens (OSHA, IATA). The American Biological Safety Association (ABSA) has a list of such agencies and links to their websites, along with links to publications and guidance documents to assist in risk assessment, lab design and adherence to laboratory exposure control plans. Many of these agencies were members of the 2009 Task Force on BioSafety. There was also a formation of a Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense, but this is more concerned with national defense programs and biosecurity.\nUltimately states and local governments, as well as private industry labs, are left to make the final determinants for their own biosafety programs, which vary widely in scope and enforcement across the United States. Not all state programs address biosafety from all necessary perspectives, which should not just include personal safety, but also emphasize an full understanding among laboratory personnel of quality control and assurance, exposure potential impacts on the environment, and general public safety.\nToby Ord puts into question whether the current international conventions regarding biotechnology research and development regulation, and self-regulation by biotechnology companies and the scientific community are adequate.\nState occupational safety plans are often focused on transportation, disposal, and risk assessment, allowing caveats for safety audits, but ultimately leaves the training in the hands of the employer. 22 states have approved Occupational Safety plans by OSHA that are audited annually for effectiveness. These plans apply to private and public sector workers, and not necessarily state/ government workers, and not all specifically have a comprehensive program for all aspects of biohazard management from start to finish. Sometimes biohazard management plans are limited only to workers in transportation specific job titles. The enforcement and training on such regulations can vary from lab to lab based on the State's plans for occupational health and safety. With the exception of DoD lab personnel, CDC lab personnel, First responders, and DoT employees, enforcement of training is inconsistent, and while training is required to be done, specifics on the breadth and frequency of refresher training does not seem consistent from state to state; penalties may never be assessed without larger regulating bodies being aware of non-compliance, and enforcement is limited.\nMedical waste management in the United States.\nMedical waste management was identified as an issue in the 1980s, with the Medical Waste Tracking Act of 1988 becoming the new standard in biohazard waste disposal.\nAlthough the Federal Government, EPA &amp; DOT provide some oversight of regulated medical waste storage, transportation, and disposal the majority of biohazard medical waste is regulated at the state level. Each state is responsible for regulation and management of their own biohazardous waste with each state varying in their regulatory process. Record keeping of biohazardous waste also varies between states.\nMedical healthcare centers, hospitals veterinary clinics, clinical laboratories and other facilities generate over one million tons of waste each year. Although the majority of this waste is as harmless as common household waste, as much as 15 percent of this waste poses a potential infection hazard, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Medical waste is required to be rendered non-infectious before it can be disposed of. There are several different methods to treat and dispose of biohazardous waste. In the United States, the primary methods for treatment and disposal of biohazard, medical and sharps waste may include:\nDifferent forms of biohazardous wasted required different treatments for their proper waste management. This is determined largely be each states regulations.\nIncidents of non-compliance and reform efforts.\nThe United States Government has made it clear that biosafety is to be taken very seriously. In 2014, incidents with anthrax and Ebola pathogens in CDC laboratories prompted the CDC director Tom Frieden to issue a moratorium for research with these types of select agents. An investigation concluded that there was a lack of adherence to safety protocols and \"inadequate safeguards\" in place. This indicated a lack of proper training or reinforcement of training and supervision on regular basis for lab personnel.\nFollowing these incidents, the CDC established an External Laboratory Safety Workgroup (ELSW), and suggestions have been made to reform effectiveness of the Federal Select Agent Program. The White House issued a report on national biosafety priorities in 2015, outlining next steps for a national biosafety and security program, and addressed biological safety needs for health research, national defense, and public safety.\nIn 2016, the Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL) had a presentation at their annual meeting focused on improving biosafety culture. This same year, The UPMC Center for Health Security issued a case study report including reviews of ten different nations' current biosafety regulations, including the United States. Their goal was to \"provide a foundation for identifying national-level biosafety norms and enable initial assessment of biosafety priorities necessary for developing effective national biosafety regulation and oversight.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In agriculture, these measures are aimed at protecting food crops and livestock from pests, invasive species, and other organisms not conducive to the welfare of the human population. The term includes biological threats to people, including those from pandemic diseases and bioterrorism. The definition has sometimes been broadened to embrace other concepts, and it is used for different purposes in different contexts.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is a recent example of a threat for which biosecurity measures have been needed in all countries of the world.\nBackground and terminology.\nThe term \"biosecurity\" has been defined differently by various disciplines. The term was first used by the agricultural and environmental communities to describe preventative measures against threats from naturally occurring diseases and pests, later expanded to introduced species. Australia and New Zealand, among other countries, had incorporated this definition within their legislation by 2010. New Zealand was the earliest adopter of a comprehensive approach with its Biosecurity Act 1993. In 2001, the US National Association of State Departments of Agriculture (NASDA) defined biosecurity as \"the sum of risk management practices in defense against biological threats\", and its main goal as \"protect[ing] against the risk posed by disease and organisms\".\nIn 2010, the World Health Organization (WHO) provided an information note describing biosecurity as a strategic and integrated approach to analysing and managing relevant risks to human, animal and plant life and health and associated risks for the environment. In another document, it describes the aim of biosecurity being \"to enhance the ability to protect human health, agricultural production systems, and the people and industries that depend on them\", with the overarching goal being \"to prevent, control and/or manage risks to life and health as appropriate to the particular biosecurity sector\".\nMeasures taken to counter biosecurity risks typically include compulsory terms of quarantine, and are put in place to minimise the risk of invasive pests or diseases arriving at a specific location that could damage crops and livestock as well as the wider environment.\nIn general, the term is today taken to include managing biological threats to people, industries or environment. These may be from foreign or endemic organisms, but they can also extend to pandemic diseases and the threat of bioterrorism, both of which pose threats to public health.\nLaboratory biosafety and intentional harm.\nThe definition has sometimes been broadened to embrace other concepts, and it is used for different purposes in different contexts. It can be defined as the \"successful minimising of the risks that the biological sciences will be deliberately or accidentally misused in a way which causes harm for humans, animals, plants or the environment, including through awareness and understanding of the risks\".\nFrom the late 1990s, in response to the threat of biological terrorism, the term started to include the prevention of the theft of biological materials from research laboratories, called \"laboratory biosecurity\" by WHO. The term laboratory biosafety refers to the measures taken \"to reduce the risk of accidental release of or exposure to infectious disease agents\", whereas laboratory biosecurity is usually taken to mean \"a set of systems and practices employed in legitimate bioscience facilities to reduce the risk that dangerous biological agents will be stolen and used maliciously\". Joseph Kanabrocki (2017) source elaborates: \"Biosafety focuses on protection of the researcher, their contacts and the environment via accidental release of a pathogen from containment, whether by direct release into the environment or by a laboratory-acquired infection. Conversely, biosecurity focuses on controlling access to pathogens of consequence and on the reliability of the scientists granted this access (thereby reducing the threat of an intentional release of a pathogen) and/or access to sensitive information related to a pathogen's virulence, host-range, transmissibility, resistance to medical countermeasures, and environmental stability, among other things\".\nIn the US, the National Science Advisory Board on Biosecurity was created in 2004 to provide biosecurity oversight of \"dual-use research\", defined as \"biological research with legitimate scientific purpose that may be misused to pose a biological threat to public health and/or national security\". In 2006, the National Academy of Sciences defined biosecurity as \"security against the inadvertent, inappropriate, or intentional malicious or malevolent use of potentially dangerous biological agents or biotechnology, including the development, production, stockpiling, or use of biological weapons as well as outbreaks of newly emergent and epidemic disease\".\nA number of nations have developed biological weapons for military use, and many civilian research projects in medicine have the potential to be used in military applications (dual-use research), so biosecurity protocols are used to prevent dangerous biological materials from falling into the hands of malevolent parties.\nLaboratory program.\nComponents of a laboratory biosecurity program include:\nAnimals and plants.\nThreats to animals and plants, in particular food crops, which may in turn threaten human health, are typically overseen by a government department of agriculture.\nAnimal biosecurity encompasses different means of prevention and containment of disease agents in a specific area. A critical element in animal biosecurity is biocontainment \u2013 the control of disease agents already present in a particular area and work to prevent transmission. Animal biosecurity may protect organisms from infectious agents or noninfectious agents such as toxins or pollutants, and can be executed in areas as large as a nation or as small as a local farm.\nAnimal biosecurity takes into account the epidemiological triad for disease occurrence: the individual host, the disease, and the environment in contributing to disease susceptibility. It aims to improve nonspecific immunity of the host to resist the introduction of an agent, or limit the risk that an agent will be sustained in an environment at adequate levels. Biocontainment works to improve specific immunity towards already present pathogens.\nThe aquaculture industry is also vulnerable to pathogenic organisms, including fungal, bacterial, or viral infections which can affect fish at different stages of their life cycle.\nHuman health.\nDirect threats to human health may come in the form of epidemics or pandemics, such as the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic and other influenza epidemics, MERS, SARS, or the COVID-19 pandemic, or they may be deliberate attacks (bioterrorism). The country/federal and/or state health departments are usually responsible for managing the control of outbreaks and transmission and the supply of information to the public.\nMedical countermeasures.\nMedical countermeasures (MCMs) are products such as biologics and pharmaceutical drugs that can protect from or treat the effects of a chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) attack or in the case of public health emergencies. MCMs can also be used for prevention and diagnosis of symptoms associated with CBRN attacks or threats.\nIn the US, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) runs a program called the \"FDA Medical Countermeasures Initiative\" (MCMi), with programs funded by the federal government. It helps support \"partner\" agencies and organisations prepare for public health emergencies that could require MCMs.\nInternational agreements and guidelines.\nAgricultural biosecurity and human health.\nVarious international organisations, international bodies and legal instruments and agreements make up a worldwide governance framework for biosecurity.\nStandard-setting organisations include the Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC), the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and the Commission on Phytosanitary Measures (CPM) develop standards pertinent to their focuses, which then become international reference points through the World Trade Organization (WTO)'s Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS Agreement), created in 1995. This agreement requires all members of the WTO to consider all import requests concerning agricultural products from other countries. Broadly, the measures covered by the agreement are those aimed at the protection of human, animal or plant life or health from certain risks.\nOther important global and regional agreements include the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005), the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC), the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, the Codex Alimentarius, the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT, 1947).\nThe UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and WHO are the most important organisations associated with biosecurity.\nThe IHR is a legally binding agreement on 196 nations, including all member states of WHO. Its purpose and scope is \"to prevent, protect against, control, and provide a public health response to the international spread of disease in ways that are commensurate with and restricted to public health risks and that avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade\", \"to help the international community prevent and respond to acute public health risks that have the potential to cross borders and threaten people worldwide\".\nAs international security issue.\nFor a long time, health security or biosecurity issues were not considered as an international security issue, especially in the traditional view of international relations. However, some changes in trend have contributed to the inclusion of biosecurity (health security) in discussions of security. As time progressed, there was a movement towards securitisation. Non-traditional security issues such as climate change, organised crime, terrorism, and landmines came to be included in the definition of international security. There was a general realisation that the actors in the international system not only involved nation-states but also included international organisations, institutions, and individuals, which ensured the security of various actors within each nation became an important agenda. Biosecurity is one of the issues to be securitised under this trend. On 10 January 2000, the UN Security Council convened to discuss HIV/AIDS as a security issue in Africa and designated it a threat in the following month. The UNDP Millennium Development Goals also recognise health issues as international security issue.\nSeveral instances of epidemics such as SARS increased awareness of health security (biosecurity). Several factors have rendered biosecurity issues more severe: there is a continuing advancement of biotechnology, which increases the possibility for malevolent use, evolution of infectious diseases, and globalising force which is making the world more interdependent and more susceptible to spread of epidemics.\nControversial experiments in synthetic biology, including the synthesis of poliovirus from its genetic sequence, and the modification of flu type H5N1 for airborne transmission in mammals, led to calls for tighter controls on the materials and information used to perform similar feats. Ideas include better enforcement by national governments and private entities concerning shipments and downloads of such materials, and registration or background check requirements for anyone handling such materials.\nChallenges.\nDiseases caused by emerging viruses are a major threat to global public health. The proliferation of high biosafety level laboratories around the world has resulted in concern about the availability of targets for those that might be interested in stealing dangerous pathogens. The growth in containment laboratories is often in response to emerging diseases, and many new containment labs' main focus is to find ways to control these diseases. By strengthening national disease surveillance, prevention, control and response systems, the labs have improved international public health.\nOne of the major challenges of biosecurity is that harmful technology has become more available and accessible. Biomedical advances and the globalisation of scientific and technical expertise have made it possible to greatly improve public health; however, there is also the risk that these advances can make it easier for terrorists to produce biological weapons.\nCommunication between the citizen and law enforcement officials is important. Indicators of agro-terrorism at a food processing plant may include persons taking notes or photos of a business, theft of employee uniforms, employees changing working hours, or persons attempting to gain information about security measures and personnel. Unusual activity is best handled if reported to law enforcement personnel promptly. Communication between policymakers and life sciences scientists is also important.\nThe MENA (Middle East and North Africa) region, with its socio-political unrest, diverse cultures and societies, and recent biological weapons programs, faces particular challenges.\nFuture.\nBiosecurity requires the cooperation of scientists, technicians, policy makers, security engineers, and law enforcement officials.\nThe emerging nature of newer biosecurity threats means that small-scale risks can blow up rapidly, which makes the development of an effective policy challenging owing to the limitations on time and resources available for analysing threats and estimating the likelihood of their occurrence. It is likely that further synergies with other disciplines, such as virology or the detection of chemical contaminants, will develop over time.\nSome uncertainties about the policy implementation for biosecurity remain for future. In order to carefully plan out preventive policies, policy makers need to be able to somewhat predict the probability and assess the risks; however, as the uncertain nature of the biosecurity issue goes it is largely difficult to predict and also involves a complex process as it requires a multidisciplinary approach. The policy choices they make to address an immediate threat could pose another threat in the future, facing an unintended trade-off.\nPhilosopher Toby Ord, in his 2020 book \"\", puts into question whether the current international conventions regarding biotechnology research and development regulation, and self-regulation by biotechnology companies and the scientific community are adequate.\nAmerican scientists have proposed various policy-based measures to reduce the large risks from life sciences research \u2013 such as pandemics through accident or misapplication. Risk management measures may include novel international guidelines, effective oversight, improvement of US policies to influence policies globally, and identification of gaps in biosecurity policies along with potential approaches to address them.\nResearchers have also warned in 2024 of potential risks from mirror life, a hypothetical form of life whose molecular building blocks have inverted chirality. If mirror bacteria were synthesized, they may be able to evade immune systems and spread in the environment without natural predators. They noted that the technology to create mirror bacteria was still probably more than a decade away, but called for a ban on research aiming to create them.\nRole of education.\nThe advance of the life sciences and biotechnology has the potential to bring great benefits to humankind through responding to societal challenges. However, it is also possible that such advances could be exploited for hostile purposes, something evidenced in a small number of incidents of bioterrorism, particularly by the series of large-scale offensive biological warfare programs carried out by major states in the last century. Dealing with this challenge, which has been labelled the \"dual-use dilemma\", requires a number of different activities. However, one way of ensuring that the life sciences continue to generate significant benefits and do not become subject to misuse for hostile purposes is a process of engagement between scientists and the security community, and the development of strong ethical and normative frameworks to complement legal and regulatory measures that are developed by states.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "45273", "revid": "50959528", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45273", "title": "Infinite loop", "text": "Programming idiom\nIn computer programming, an infinite loop (or endless loop) is a sequence of instructions that, as written, will continue endlessly, unless an external intervention occurs, such as turning off power via a switch or pulling a plug. It may be intentional.\nThere is no general algorithm to determine whether a computer program contains an infinite loop or not; this is the halting problem. \nOverview.\nThis differs from \"a type of computer program that runs the same instructions continuously until it is either stopped or interrupted\". Consider the following pseudocode:\nhow_many = 0\nwhile is_there_more_data() do\n how_many = how_many + 1\nend\ndisplay \"the number of items counted = \" how_many\nThe same instructions are run continuously until it is stopped or interrupted by a FALSE returned at some point by the function \"is_there_more_data\".\nBy contrast, the following loop will not end by itself:\nbirds = 1\nfish = 2\nwhile birds + fish &gt; 1 do\n birds = 3 - birds\n fish = 3 - fish\nend\n\"birds\" will alternate being 1 or 2, while \"fish\" will alternate being 2 or 1. The loop will not stop unless an external intervention occurs (\"pull the plug\").\nDetails.\nAn \"infinite loop\" is a sequence of instructions in a computer program which loops endlessly, either due to the loop having no terminating condition, having one that can never be met, or one that causes the loop to start over. In older operating systems with cooperative multitasking, infinite loops normally caused the entire system to become unresponsive. With the now-prevalent preemptive multitasking model, infinite loops usually cause the program to consume all available processor time, but can usually be terminated by a user. Busy wait loops are also sometimes called \"infinite loops\". Infinite loops are one possible cause for a computer hanging or freezing; others include thrashing, deadlock, and access violations.\nIntended vs unintended looping.\nLooping is repeating a set of instructions until a specific condition is met. An infinite loop occurs when the condition will never be met due to some inherent characteristic of the loop.\nIntentional looping.\nThere are a few situations when this is desired behavior. For example, the games on cartridge-based game consoles typically have no exit condition in their main loop, as there is no operating system for the program to exit to; the loop runs until the console is powered off.\nModern interactive computers require that the computer constantly be monitoring for user input or device activity, so at some fundamental level there is an infinite processing idle loop that must continue until the device is turned off or reset. In the Apollo Guidance Computer, for example, this outer loop was contained in the Exec program, and if the computer had absolutely no other work to do, it would loop run a dummy job that would simply turn off the \"computer activity\" indicator light.\nModern computers also typically do not halt the processor or motherboard circuit-driving clocks when they crash. Instead they fall back to an error condition displaying messages to the operator (such as the blue screen of death), and enter an infinite loop waiting for the user to either respond to a prompt to continue, or reset the device.\nMulti-threading.\nIn multi-threaded programs some threads can be executing inside infinite loops without causing the entire program to be stuck in an infinite loop. If the main thread exits, all threads of the process are forcefully stopped, thus all execution ends and the process/program terminates. The threads inside the infinite loops can perform \"housekeeping\" tasks or they can be in a blocked state waiting for input (from socket/queue) and resume execution every time input is received.\nUnintentional looping.\nMost often, the term is used for those situations when this is not the intended result; that is, when this is a bug. Such errors are most common by novice programmers, but can be made by experienced programmers also, because their causes can be quite subtle.\nOne common cause, for example, is that a programmer intends to iterate over sequence of nodes in a data structure such as a linked list or tree, executing the loop code once for each node. Improperly formed links can create a \"reference loop\" in the data structure, where one node links to another that occurs earlier in the sequence. This makes part of the data structure into a ring, causing naive code to loop forever.\nWhile most infinite loops can be found by close inspection of the code, there is no general method to determine whether a given program will ever halt or will run forever; this is the undecidability of the halting problem.\nInterruption.\nAs long as the system is responsive, infinite loops can often be interrupted by sending a signal to the process (such as SIGINT in Unix), or an interrupt to the processor, causing the current process to be aborted. This can be done in a task manager, in a terminal with the Control-C command, or by using the kill command or system call. However, this does not always work, as the process may not be responding to signals or the processor may be in an uninterruptible state, such as in the Cyrix coma bug (caused by overlapping uninterruptible instructions in an instruction pipeline). In some cases other signals such as SIGKILL can work, as they do not require the process to be responsive, while in other cases the loop cannot be terminated short of system shutdown.\nLanguage support.\nInfinite loops can be implemented using various control flow constructs. Most commonly, in unstructured programming this is jump back up (goto), while in structured programming this is an indefinite loop (while loop) set to never end, either by omitting the condition or explicitly setting it to true, as codice_1.\nSome languages have special constructs for infinite loops, typically by omitting the condition from an indefinite loop. Examples include Ada (codice_2), Fortran (codice_3), Go (codice_4), Ruby (codice_5), and Rust (codice_6).\nExamples of intentional infinite loops.\nThis is a loop that will print \"Infinite loop\" without halting, in C:\nint main() {\n for (;;) {\n printf(\"Infinite loop\\n\");\n return 0;\nThe form codice_7 for an infinite loop is traditional, appearing in the standard reference \"The C Programming Language\", and is often punningly pronounced \"forever.\" However, its presence does not guarantee an infinite loop since the loop can be terminated by breaking using codice_8, returning using codice_9, or jumping using codice_10.\nIn C and C-derived languages, an infinite loop is perhaps more modernly expressed as codice_11:\nint main() {\n while (true) {\n printf(\"Infinite loop\\n\");\n return 0;\nIn the descendant languages of C, such as C++, Java, and C#, it is more idiomatic to use codice_11.\nA similar example in 1980s-era BASIC:\n10 PRINT \"INFINITE LOOP\"\n20 GOTO 10\nA similar example in MS-DOS compatible batch files:\nA\necho Infinite Loop\ngoto :A\nThe while loop never terminates because its condition is always true.\nIn Bourne Again Shell:\nfor ((;;)); do\n echo \"Infinite Loop\"\ndone\nIn Rust:\nloop {\n println!(\"Infinite loop\");\nExamples of unintentional infinite loops.\nMathematical errors.\nHere is one example of an infinite loop in Visual Basic:\ndim x as integer\ndo while x &lt; 5\n x = 1\n x = x + 1\nloop\nThis creates a situation where codice_13 will never be greater than 5, since at the start of the loop code, codice_13 is assigned the value of 1 (regardless of any previous value) before it is changed to codice_13 + 1. Thus the loop will always result in codice_13 = 2 and will never break. This could be fixed by moving the codice_17 instruction outside the loop so that its initial value is set only once.\nIn some languages, programmer confusion about mathematical symbols may lead to an unintentional infinite loop. For example, here is a snippet in C:\nint main(void) {\n int a = 0;\n while (a &lt; 10) {\n printf(\"%d\\n\", a);\n if (a = 5) {\n printf(\"a equals 5!\\n\");\n ++a;\n return 0;\nThe expected output is the numbers 0 through 9, with an interjected \"a equals 5!\" between 5 and 6. However, in the line \"codice_18\" above, the = (assignment) operator was confused with the == (equality test) operator. Instead, this will assign the value of 5 to codice_19 at this point in the program. Thus, codice_19 will never be able to advance to 10, and this loop cannot terminate.\nRounding errors.\nUnexpected behavior in evaluating the terminating condition can also cause this problem. Here is an example in C:\nfloat x = 0.1;\nwhile (x != 1.1) {\n printf(\"x = %22.20f\\n\", x);\n x += 0.1;\nOn some systems, this loop will execute ten times as expected, but on other systems it will never terminate. The problem is that the loop terminating condition codice_21 tests for exact equality of two floating point values, and the way floating point values are represented in many computers will make this test fail, because they cannot represent the value 0.1 exactly, thus introducing rounding errors on each increment (cf. box).\nThe same can happen in Python:\nx: float = 0.1\nwhile x != 1:\n print(x)\n x += 0.1\nBecause of the likelihood of tests for equality or not-equality failing unexpectedly, it is safer to use greater-than or less-than tests when dealing with floating-point values. For example, instead of testing whether codice_13 equals 1.1, one might test whether codice_23, or codice_24, either of which would be certain to exit after a finite number of iterations. Another way to fix this particular example would be to use an integer as a loop index, counting the number of iterations that have been performed.\nA similar problem occurs frequently in numerical analysis: in order to compute a certain result, an iteration is intended to be carried out until the error is smaller than a chosen tolerance. However, because of rounding errors during the iteration, the specified tolerance can never be reached, resulting in an infinite loop.\nMulti-party loops.\nAn infinite loop may be caused by several entities interacting. Consider a server that always replies with an error message if it does not understand the request. Even if there is no possibility for an infinite loop within the server itself, a system comprising two of them (\"A\" and \"B\") may loop endlessly: if \"A\" receives a message of unknown type from \"B\", then \"A\" replies with an error message to \"B\"; if \"B\" does not understand the error message, it replies to \"A\" with its own error message; if \"A\" does not understand the error message from \"B\", it sends yet another error message, and so on.\nOne common example of such situation is an email loop. An example of an email loop is if someone receives mail from a no reply inbox, but their auto-response is on. They will reply to the no reply inbox, triggering the \"this is a no reply inbox\" response. This will be sent to the user, who then sends an auto reply to the no-reply inbox, and so on and so forth.\nPseudo-infinite loops.\nA pseudo-infinite loop is a loop that appears infinite but is really just a very long loop.\nImpossible termination condition.\nAn example for loop in C:\nfor (unsigned int i = 1; i != 0; i++) {\n // loop code\nIt appears that this will go on indefinitely, but in fact the value of codice_25 will eventually reach the maximum value storable in an codice_26 and adding 1 to that number will wrap-around causing an integer overflow, breaking the loop. The actual limit of codice_25 depends on the details of the system and compiler used. With arbitrary-precision arithmetic, this loop would continue until the computer's memory could no longer hold codice_25.

{"id": "45280", "revid": "27823944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45280", "title": "Arthur Sullivan", "text": "British composer (1842\u20131900)\n \nSir Arthur Seymour Sullivan (13 May 1842\u00a0\u2013 22 November 1900) was an English composer. He is best known for 14 comic opera collaborations with the dramatist W.\u00a0S. Gilbert, including \"H.M.S. Pinafore\", \"The Pirates of Penzance\" and \"The Mikado\". His works include 24 operas, 11 major orchestral works, ten choral works and oratorios, two ballets, incidental music to several plays, and numerous church pieces, songs, and piano and chamber pieces. His hymns and songs include \"Onward, Christian Soldiers\" and \"The Lost Chord\".\nThe son of a military bandmaster, Sullivan composed his first anthem at the age of eight and was later a soloist in the boys' choir of the Chapel Royal. In 1856, at 14, he was awarded the first Mendelssohn Scholarship by the Royal Academy of Music, which allowed him to study at the academy and then at the Leipzig Conservatoire in Germany. His graduation piece, incidental music to Shakespeare's \"The Tempest\" (1861), was received with acclaim on its first performance in London. Among his early major works were a ballet, \"L'\u00cele Enchant\u00e9e\" (1864), a symphony, a cello concerto (both 1866), and his \"Overture di Ballo\" (1870). To supplement the income from his concert works he wrote hymns, parlour ballads and other light pieces, and worked as a church organist and music teacher.\nIn 1866 Sullivan composed a one-act comic opera, \"Cox and Box\", which is still widely performed. He wrote his first opera with W. S. Gilbert, \"Thespis\", in 1871. Four years later, the impresario Richard D'Oyly Carte engaged Gilbert and Sullivan to create a one-act piece, \"Trial by Jury\" (1875). Its box-office success led to a series of twelve full-length comic operas by the collaborators. After the extraordinary success of \"H.M.S. Pinafore\" (1878) and \"The Pirates of Penzance\" (1879), Carte used his profits from the partnership to build the Savoy Theatre in 1881, and their joint works became known as the Savoy operas. Among the best known of the later operas are \"The Mikado\" (1885) and \"The Gondoliers\" (1889). Gilbert broke from Sullivan and Carte in 1890, after a quarrel over expenses at the Savoy. They reunited in the 1890s for two more operas, but these did not achieve the popularity of their earlier works.\nSullivan's infrequent serious pieces during the 1880s included two cantatas, \"The Martyr of Antioch\" (1880) and \"The Golden Legend\" (1886), his most popular choral work. He also wrote incidental music for West End productions of several Shakespeare plays, and held conducting and academic appointments. Sullivan's only grand opera, \"Ivanhoe\", though initially successful in 1891, has rarely been revived. In his last decade Sullivan continued to compose comic operas with various librettists and wrote other major and minor works. He died at the age of 58, regarded as Britain's foremost composer. His comic opera style served as a model for generations of musical theatre composers that followed, and his music is still frequently performed, recorded and pastiched.\nLife and career.\nEarly life.\nSullivan was born on 13 May 1842 in Lambeth, London, the younger of the two children, both boys, of Thomas Sullivan (1805\u20131866) and his wife, Mary Clementina \"n\u00e9e\" Coghlan (1811\u20131882). His father was a military bandmaster, clarinettist and music teacher, born in Ireland and raised in Chelsea, London; his mother was English born, of Irish and Italian descent. Thomas Sullivan was based from 1845 to 1857 at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, where he was the bandmaster and taught music privately to supplement his income. Young Arthur became proficient with many of the instruments in the band and composed an anthem, \"By the Waters of Babylon\", when he was eight. He later recalled:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWhile recognising the boy's obvious talent, his father knew the insecurity of a musical career and discouraged him from pursuing it. Sullivan studied at a private school in Bayswater. In 1854 he persuaded his parents and the headmaster to allow him to apply for membership in the choir of the Chapel Royal. Despite concerns that, at nearly 12 years of age, Sullivan was too old to give much service as a treble before his voice broke, he was accepted and soon became a soloist. By 1856, he was promoted to \"first boy\". Even at this age, his health was delicate, and he was easily fatigued.\nSullivan flourished under the training of the Reverend Thomas Helmore, Master of the Children of the Chapel Royal, and began to write anthems and songs. Helmore encouraged his compositional talent and arranged for one of his pieces, \"O Israel\", to be published in 1855, his first published work. Helmore enlisted Sullivan's assistance in creating harmonisations for a volume of \"The Hymnal Noted\" and arranged for the boy's compositions to be performed; one anthem was performed at the Chapel Royal in St James's Palace under the direction of Sir George Smart.\nMendelssohn scholar.\nIn 1856 the Royal Academy of Music awarded the first Mendelssohn Scholarship to the 14-year-old Sullivan, granting him a year's training at the academy. His principal teacher there was John Goss, whose own teacher, Thomas Attwood, had been a pupil of Mozart. He studied piano with William Sterndale Bennett (the future head of the academy) and Arthur O'Leary. During this first year at the academy Sullivan continued to sing solos with the Chapel Royal, which provided a small amount of spending money.\nSullivan's scholarship was extended to a second year, and in 1858, in what his biographer Arthur Jacobs calls an \"extraordinary gesture of confidence\", the scholarship committee extended his grant for a third year so that he could study in Germany, at the Leipzig Conservatoire. There, Sullivan studied composition with Julius Rietz and Carl Reinecke, counterpoint with Moritz Hauptmann and Ernst Richter, and the piano with Louis Plaidy and Ignaz Moscheles. He was trained in Mendelssohn's ideas and techniques but was also exposed to a variety of styles, including those of Schubert, Verdi, Bach and Wagner. Visiting a synagogue, he was so struck by some of the cadences and progressions of the music that thirty years later he could recall them for use in his grand opera, \"Ivanhoe\". He became friendly with the future impresario Carl Rosa and the violinist Joseph Joachim, among others.\nThe academy renewed Sullivan's scholarship to allow him a second year of study at Leipzig. For his third and last year there, his father scraped together the money for living expenses, and the conservatoire assisted by waiving its fees. Sullivan's graduation piece, completed in 1861, was a suite of incidental music to Shakespeare's \"The Tempest\". Revised and expanded, it was performed at the Crystal Palace in 1862, a year after his return to London; \"The Musical Times\" described it as a sensation. He began building a reputation as England's most promising young composer.\nRising composer.\nSullivan embarked on his composing career with a series of ambitious works, interspersed with hymns, parlour songs and other light pieces in a more commercial vein. His compositions were not enough to support him financially, and between 1861 and 1872 he worked as a church organist, which he enjoyed; as a music teacher, which he hated and gave up as soon as he could; and as an arranger of vocal scores of popular operas. He took an early opportunity to compose several pieces for royalty in connection with the wedding of the Prince of Wales in 1863.\nWith \"The Masque at Kenilworth\" (Birmingham Festival, 1864), Sullivan began his association with works for voice and orchestra. While an organist at the Royal Italian Opera, Covent Garden, he composed his first ballet, \"L'\u00cele Enchant\u00e9e\" (1864). His \"\"Irish\" Symphony\" and \"Cello Concerto\" (both 1866) were his only works in their respective genres. In the same year, his Overture in C (\"In Memoriam\"), commemorating the recent death of his father, was a commission from the Norwich Festival. It achieved considerable popularity. In June 1867 the Philharmonic Society gave the first performance of his overture \"Marmion\". The reviewer for \"The Times\" called it \"another step in advance on the part of the only composer of any remarkable promise that just at present we can boast.\" In October, Sullivan travelled with George Grove to Vienna in search of neglected scores by Schubert. They unearthed manuscript copies of symphonies and vocal music, and were particularly elated by their final discovery, the incidental music to \"Rosamunde\".\nSullivan's first attempt at opera, \"The Sapphire Necklace\" (1863\u201364) to a libretto by Henry F. Chorley, was not produced and is now lost, except for the overture and two songs that were separately published. His first surviving opera, \"Cox and Box\" (1866), was written for a private performance. It then received charity performances in London and Manchester, and was later produced at the Gallery of Illustration, where it ran for an extraordinary 264 performances. W. S. Gilbert, writing in \"Fun\" magazine, pronounced the score superior to F. C. Burnand's libretto. Sullivan and Burnand were soon commissioned by Thomas German Reed for a two-act opera, \"The Contrabandista\" (1867; revised and expanded as \"The Chieftain\" in 1894), but it did not do as well. Among Sullivan's early part songs is \"The Long Day Closes\" (1868). Sullivan's last major work of the 1860s was a short oratorio, \"The Prodigal Son\", first given in Worcester Cathedral as part of the 1869 Three Choirs Festival to much praise.\n1870s: first collaborations with Gilbert.\nSullivan's most enduring orchestral work, the \"Overture di Ballo\", was composed for the Birmingham Festival in 1870. The same year, Sullivan first met the poet and dramatist W. S. Gilbert. In 1871 Sullivan published his only song cycle, \"The Window\", to words by Tennyson, and he wrote the first of a series of incidental music scores for productions of Shakespeare plays. He also composed a dramatic cantata, \"On Shore and Sea\", for the opening of the London International Exhibition, and the hymn \"Onward, Christian Soldiers\", with words by Sabine Baring-Gould. The Salvation Army adopted the latter as its favoured processional, and it became Sullivan's best-known hymn.\nAt the end of 1871 John Hollingshead, proprietor of London's Gaiety Theatre, commissioned Sullivan to work with Gilbert to create the burlesque-style comic opera \"Thespis\". Played as a Christmas entertainment, it ran through to Easter 1872, a good run for such a piece. Gilbert and Sullivan then went their separate ways until they collaborated on three parlour ballads in late 1874 and early 1875.\nSullivan's large-scale works of the early 1870s were the \"Festival Te Deum\" (Crystal Palace, 1872) and the oratorio \"The Light of the World\" (Birmingham Festival, 1873). He provided incidental music for productions of \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\" at the Gaiety in 1874 and \"Henry VIII\" at the Theatre Royal, Manchester, in 1877. He continued to compose hymns throughout the decade. In 1873 Sullivan contributed songs to Burnand's Christmas \"drawing room extravaganza\", \"The Miller and His Man\".\nIn 1875 the manager of the Royalty Theatre, Richard D'Oyly Carte, needed a short piece to fill out a bill with Offenbach's \"La P\u00e9richole\". Carte had conducted Sullivan's \"Cox and Box\". Remembering that Gilbert had suggested a libretto to him, Carte engaged Sullivan to set it, and the result was the one-act comic opera \"Trial by Jury\". \"Trial\", starring Sullivan's brother Fred as the Learned Judge, became a surprise hit, earning glowing praise from the critics and playing for 300 performances over its first few seasons. \"The Daily Telegraph\" commented that the piece illustrated the composer's \"great capacity for dramatic writing of the lighter class\", and other reviews emphasised the felicitous combination of Gilbert's words and Sullivan's music. One wrote, \"it seems, as in the great Wagnerian operas, as though poem and music had proceeded simultaneously from one and the same brain.\" A few months later, another Sullivan one-act comic opera opened: \"The Zoo\", with a libretto by B. C. Stephenson. It was less successful than \"Trial\", and for the next 15 years Sullivan's sole operatic collaborator was Gilbert; the partners created a further twelve operas together.\nSullivan also turned out more than 80 popular songs and parlour ballads, most of them written before the end of the 1870s. His first popular song was \"Orpheus with his Lute\" (1866), and a well-received part song was \"Oh! Hush thee, my Babie\" (1867). The best known of his songs is \"The Lost Chord\" (1877, lyrics by Adelaide Anne Procter), written at the bedside of his brother during Fred's last illness. The sheet music for his best-received songs sold in large numbers and was an important part of his income.\nIn this decade, Sullivan's conducting appointments included the Glasgow Choral Union concerts (1875\u201377) and the Royal Aquarium Theatre, London (1876). In addition to his appointment as Professor of Composition at the Royal Academy of Music, of which he was a Fellow, he was appointed as the first Principal of the National Training School of Music in 1876. He accepted the latter post reluctantly, fearing that discharging the duties thoroughly would leave too little time for composing; in this he was correct. He was not effective in the post, and resigned in 1881.\nSullivan's next collaboration with Gilbert, \"The Sorcerer\" (1877), ran for 178 performances, a success by the standards of the day, but \"H.M.S. Pinafore\" (1878), which followed it, turned Gilbert and Sullivan into an international phenomenon. Sullivan composed the bright and cheerful music of \"Pinafore\" while suffering from excruciating pain from a kidney stone. \"Pinafore\" ran for 571 performances in London, then the second-longest theatrical run in history, and more than 150 unauthorised productions were quickly mounted in America alone. Among other favourable reviews, \"The Times\" noted that the opera was an early attempt at the establishment of a \"national musical stage\" free from risqu\u00e9 French \"improprieties\" and without the \"aid\" of Italian and German musical models. \"The Times\" and several of the other papers agreed that although the piece was entertaining, Sullivan was capable of higher art, and frivolous light opera would hold him back. This criticism would follow Sullivan throughout his career.\nIn 1879 Sullivan suggested to a reporter from \"The New York Times\" the secret of his success with Gilbert: \"His ideas are as suggestive for music as they are quaint and laughable. His numbers\u00a0... always give me musical ideas.\" \"Pinafore\" was followed by \"The Pirates of Penzance\" in 1879, which opened in New York and then ran in London for 363 performances.\nEarly 1880s.\nIn 1880 Sullivan was appointed director of the triennial Leeds Music Festival. He had earlier been commissioned to write a sacred choral work for the festival and chose, as its subject, Henry Hart Milman's 1822 dramatic poem based on the life and death of St Margaret of Antioch. \"The Martyr of Antioch\" was first performed at the Leeds Festival in October 1880. Gilbert adapted the libretto for Sullivan, who, in gratitude, presented his collaborator with an engraved silver cup inscribed \"W.S. Gilbert from his friend Arthur Sullivan.\" Sullivan was not a showy conductor, and some thought him dull and old-fashioned on the podium, but \"Martyr\" had an enthusiastic reception and was frequently revived. Other critics and performers had favorable reactions to Sullivan's conducting, and he had a busy conducting career in parallel with his composing career, including seven Leeds Festivals among many other appointments. Sullivan invariably conducted the opening nights of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas.\nCarte opened the next Gilbert and Sullivan piece, \"Patience\", in April 1881 at London's Opera Comique, where their past three operas had played. In October, \"Patience\" transferred to the new, larger, state-of-the-art Savoy Theatre, built with the profits of the previous Gilbert and Sullivan works. The rest of the partnership's collaborations were produced at the Savoy, and are widely known as the \"Savoy operas\". \"Iolanthe\" (1882), the first new opera to open at the Savoy, was Gilbert and Sullivan's fourth hit in a row. Sullivan, despite the financial security of writing for the Savoy, increasingly viewed the composition of comic operas as unimportant, beneath his skills, and also repetitious. After \"Iolanthe\", Sullivan had not intended to write a new work with Gilbert, but he suffered a serious financial loss when his broker went bankrupt in November 1882. Therefore, he concluded that his financial needs obliged him to continue writing Savoy operas. In February 1883, he and Gilbert signed a five-year agreement with Carte, requiring them to produce a new comic opera on six months' notice.\nOn 22 May 1883 Sullivan was knighted by Queen Victoria for his \"services\u00a0... rendered to the promotion of the art of music\" in Britain. The musical establishment, and many critics, believed that this should end his career as a composer of comic opera \u2013 that a musical knight should not stoop below oratorio or grand opera. Having just signed the five-year agreement, Sullivan suddenly felt trapped. The next opera, \"Princess Ida\" (1884, the duo's only three-act, blank verse work), had a shorter run than its four predecessors; Sullivan's score was praised. With box office receipts lagging in March 1884, Carte gave the six months' notice, under the partnership contract, requiring a new opera. Sullivan's close friend, the composer Frederic Clay, had recently suffered a career-ending stroke at the age of 45. Sullivan, reflecting on this, on his own long-standing kidney problems, and on his desire to devote himself to more serious music, replied to Carte, \"[I]t is impossible for me to do another piece of the character of those already written by Gilbert and myself.\"\nGilbert had already started work on a new opera in which the characters fell in love against their wills after taking a magic lozenge. Sullivan wrote on 1 April 1884 that he had \"come to the end of my tether\" with the operas: \"I have been continually keeping down the music in order that not one [syllable] should be lost.\u00a0... I should like to set a story of human interest &amp; probability where the humorous words would come in a humorous (not serious) situation, &amp; where, if the situation were a tender or dramatic one the words would be of similar character.\" In a lengthy exchange of correspondence, Sullivan pronounced Gilbert's plot sketch (particularly the \"lozenge\" element) unacceptably mechanical, and too similar in both its grotesque \"elements of topsyturveydom\" and in actual plot to their earlier work, especially \"The Sorcerer\". He repeatedly requested that Gilbert find a new subject. The impasse was finally resolved on 8 May when Gilbert proposed a plot that did not depend on any supernatural device. The result was Gilbert and Sullivan's most successful work, \"The Mikado\" (1885). The piece ran for 672 performances, which was the second-longest run for any work of musical theatre, and one of the longest runs of any theatre piece, up to that time.\nLater 1880s.\nIn 1886 Sullivan composed his second and last large-scale choral work of the decade. It was a cantata for the Leeds Festival, \"The Golden Legend\", based on Longfellow's poem of the same name. Apart from the comic operas, this proved to be Sullivan's best received full-length work. It was given hundreds of performances during his lifetime, and at one point he declared a moratorium on its presentation, fearing that it would become over-exposed. Only Handel's \"Messiah\" was performed more often in Britain in the 1880s and 1890s. It remained in the repertory until about the 1920s, but since then it has seldom been performed; it received its first professional recording in 2001. The musical scholar and conductor David Russell Hulme writes that the work influenced Elgar and Walton.\n\"Ruddigore\" followed \"The Mikado\" at the Savoy in 1887. It was profitable, but its nine-month run was disappointing compared with most of the earlier Savoy operas. For their next piece, Gilbert submitted another version of the magic lozenge plot, which Sullivan again rejected. Gilbert finally proposed a comparatively serious opera, to which Sullivan agreed. Although it was not a grand opera, \"The Yeomen of the Guard\" (1888) provided him with the opportunity to compose his most ambitious stage work to date. As early as 1883 Sullivan had been under pressure from the musical establishment to write a grand opera. In 1885 he told an interviewer, \"The opera of the future is a compromise [among the French, German and Italian schools] \u2013 a sort of eclectic school, a selection of the merits of each one. I myself will make an attempt to produce a grand opera of this new school.\u00a0... Yes, it will be an historical work, and it is the dream of my life.\" After \"The Yeomen of the Guard\" opened, Sullivan turned again to Shakespeare, composing incidental music for Henry Irving's Lyceum Theatre production of \"Macbeth\" (1888).\nSullivan wished to produce further serious works with Gilbert. He had collaborated with no other librettist since 1875. But Gilbert felt that the reaction to \"The Yeomen of the Guard\" had \"not been so convincing as to warrant us in assuming that the public want something more earnest still\". He proposed instead that Sullivan should go ahead with his plan to write a grand opera, but should continue also to compose comic works for the Savoy. Sullivan was not immediately persuaded. He replied, \"I have lost the liking for writing comic opera, and entertain very grave doubts as to my power of doing it.\" Nevertheless, Sullivan soon commissioned a grand opera libretto from Julian Sturgis (who was recommended by Gilbert), and suggested to Gilbert that he revive an old idea for an opera set in colourful Venice. The comic opera was completed first: \"The Gondoliers\" (1889) was a piece described by Gervase Hughes as a pinnacle of Sullivan's achievement. It was the last great Gilbert and Sullivan success.\n1890s.\nThe relationship between Gilbert and Sullivan suffered its most serious breach in April 1890, during the run of \"The Gondoliers\", when Gilbert objected to Carte's financial accounts for the production, including a charge to the partnership for the cost of new carpeting for the Savoy Theatre lobby. Gilbert believed that this was a maintenance expense that should be charged to Carte alone. Carte was building a new theatre to present Sullivan's forthcoming grand opera, and Sullivan sided with Carte, going so far as to sign an affidavit that contained erroneous information about old debts of the partnership. Gilbert took legal action against Carte and Sullivan, vowing to write no more for the Savoy, and so the partnership came to an acrimonious end. Sullivan wrote to Gilbert in September 1890 that he was \"physically and mentally ill over this wretched business. I have not yet got over the shock of seeing our names coupled\u00a0... in hostile antagonism over a few miserable pounds\".\nSullivan's only grand opera, \"Ivanhoe\", based on Walter Scott's novel, opened at Carte's new Royal English Opera House on 31 January 1891. Sullivan completed the score too late to meet Carte's planned production date, and costs mounted; Sullivan was required to pay Carte a contractual penalty of \u00a33,000 () for his delay. The production lasted for 155 consecutive performances, an unprecedented run for a grand opera, and earned good notices for its music. Afterwards, Carte was unable to fill the new opera house with other opera productions and sold the theatre. Despite the initial success of \"Ivanhoe\", some writers blamed it for the failure of the opera house, and it soon passed into obscurity. Herman Klein called the episode \"the strangest comingling of success and failure ever chronicled in the history of British lyric enterprise!\" Later in 1891 Sullivan composed music for Tennyson's \"The Foresters\", which ran well at Daly's Theatre in New York in 1892, but failed in London the following year.\nSullivan returned to comic opera, but because of the fracture with Gilbert, he and Carte sought other collaborators. Sullivan's next piece was \"Haddon Hall\" (1892), with a libretto by Sydney Grundy based loosely on the legend of the elopement of Dorothy Vernon with John Manners. Although still comic, the tone and style of the work was considerably more serious and romantic than most of the operas with Gilbert. It ran for 204 performances, and was praised by critics. In 1895 Sullivan once more provided incidental music for the Lyceum, this time for J. Comyns Carr's \"\".\nWith the aid of an intermediary, Sullivan's music publisher Tom Chappell, the three partners were reunited in 1892. Their next opera, \"Utopia, Limited\" (1893), ran for 245 performances, barely covering the expenses of the lavish production, although it was the longest run at the Savoy in the 1890s. Sullivan came to disapprove of the leading lady, Nancy McIntosh, and refused to write another piece featuring her; Gilbert insisted that she must appear in his next opera. Instead, Sullivan teamed up again with his old partner, F. C. Burnand. \"The Chieftain\" (1894), a heavily revised version of their earlier two-act opera, \"The Contrabandista\", flopped. Gilbert and Sullivan reunited one more time, after McIntosh announced her retirement from the stage, for \"The Grand Duke\" (1896). It failed, and Sullivan never worked with Gilbert again, although their operas continued to be revived with success at the Savoy.\nIn May 1897 Sullivan's full-length ballet, \"Victoria and Merrie England\", opened at the Alhambra Theatre to celebrate the Queen's Diamond Jubilee. The work celebrates English history and culture, with the Victorian period as the grand finale. Its six-month run was considered a great achievement. \"The Beauty Stone\" (1898), with a libretto by Arthur Wing Pinero and J. Comyns Carr, was based on mediaeval morality plays. The collaboration did not go well: Sullivan wrote that Pinero and Comyns Carr were \"gifted and brilliant men, with \"no\" experience in writing for music\", and, when he asked for alterations to improve the structure, they refused. The opera, moreover, was too serious for the Savoy audiences' tastes. It was a critical failure and ran for only seven weeks.\nIn November 1899, to benefit \"the wives and children of soldiers and sailors\" on active service in the Boer War, Sullivan composed the music of a song, \"The Absent-Minded Beggar\", to a text by Rudyard Kipling, which became an instant sensation and raised an unprecedented \u00a3300,000 () for the fund from performances and the sale of sheet music and related merchandise. In \"The Rose of Persia\" (1899), Sullivan returned to his comic roots, writing to a libretto by Basil Hood that combined an exotic \"Arabian Nights\" setting with plot elements of \"The Mikado\". Sullivan's tuneful score was well received, and the opera proved to be his most successful full-length collaboration apart from those with Gilbert. Another opera with Hood, \"The Emerald Isle\", quickly went into preparation, but Sullivan died before it was completed. The score was finished by Edward German, and produced in 1901.\nDeath, honours and legacy.\nSullivan's health was never robust \u2013 from his thirties his kidney disease often obliged him to conduct sitting down. He died of heart failure, following an attack of bronchitis, at his flat in Westminster on 22 November 1900 at the age of 58. His \"Te Deum Laudamus\", written in expectation of victory in the Boer War, was performed posthumously.\nA monument in the composer's memory featuring a weeping Muse was erected in the Victoria Embankment Gardens in London and is inscribed with Gilbert's words from \"The Yeomen of the Guard\": \"Is life a boon? If so, it must befall that Death, whene'er he call, must call too soon\". Sullivan wished to be buried in Brompton Cemetery with his parents and brother, but by order of the Queen he was buried in St Paul's Cathedral. In addition to his knighthood, honours awarded to Sullivan in his lifetime included Doctor in Music, \"honoris causa\", by the Universities of Cambridge (1876) and Oxford (1879); Chevalier, L\u00e9gion d'honneur, France (1878); Order of the Medjidie conferred by the Sultan of Turkey (1888); and appointment as a Member of the Fourth Class of the Royal Victorian Order (MVO) in 1897.\nSullivan's operas have often been adapted, first in the 19th century as dance pieces and in foreign adaptations of the operas themselves. Since then, his music has been made into ballets (\"Pineapple Poll\" (1951) and \"Pirates of Penzance \u2013 The Ballet!\" (1991)) and musicals (\"The Swing Mikado\" (1938), \"The Hot Mikado\" (1939) and \"Hot Mikado\" (1986), \"Hollywood Pinafore\" and \"Memphis Bound\" (both 1945), \"The Black Mikado\" (1975), etc.). His operas are frequently performed, and also parodied, pastiched, quoted and imitated in comedy routines, advertising, law, film, television, and other popular media. He has been portrayed on screen in \"The Story of Gilbert and Sullivan\" (1953) and \"Topsy-Turvy\" (2000). He is celebrated not only for writing the Savoy operas and his other works, but also for his influence on the development of modern American and British musical theatre.\nPersonal life.\nRomantic life.\nSullivan never married, but he had serious love affairs with several women. The first was with Rachel Scott Russell (1845\u20131882), the daughter of the engineer John Scott Russell. Sullivan was a frequent visitor at the Scott Russell home in the mid-1860s, and by 1865 the affair was in full bloom. Rachel's parents did not approve of a possible union with a young composer of uncertain financial prospects, but the two continued to see each other covertly. At some point in 1868 Sullivan started a simultaneous (and secret) affair with Rachel's sister Louise (1841\u20131878). Both relationships ended by early 1869.\nSullivan's longest love affair was with the American socialite Fanny Ronalds, a woman three years his senior, who had separated from her American husband and was raising her children in Europe. He met her in Paris around 1867, and the affair began in earnest soon after she moved to London in 1871. According to a contemporary description of Ronalds, \"Her face was perfectly divine in its loveliness, her features small and exquisitely regular. Her hair was a dark shade of brown \u2013 \"ch\u00e2tain fonc\u00e9\" [deep chestnut] \u2013 and very abundant\u00a0... a lovely woman, with the most generous smile one could possibly imagine, and the most beautiful teeth.\" Sullivan called her \"the best amateur singer in London\". She often performed Sullivan's songs at her famous Sunday soir\u00e9es. She became particularly associated with \"The Lost Chord\", singing it both in private and in public, often with Sullivan accompanying her. When Sullivan died, he left her the autograph manuscript of that song, along with other bequests.\nRonalds never divorced. Social conventions of the time compelled Sullivan and Ronalds to keep their relationship private. She apparently became pregnant at least twice and procured abortions in 1882 and 1884. Sullivan had a roving eye, and his diary records the occasional quarrels when Ronalds discovered his other liaisons, but he always returned to her. Around 1889 or 1890 the sexual relationship evidently ended \u2013 he started to refer to her in his diary as \"Auntie\" \u2013 but she remained a constant companion for the rest of his life.\nIn 1896 the 54-year-old Sullivan proposed marriage to the 22-year-old Violet Beddington (1874\u20131962), but she refused him.\nLeisure and family life.\nSullivan loved to spend time in France (both in Paris and on the Riviera), where his acquaintances included European royalty and where the casinos enabled him to indulge his passion for gambling. He enjoyed hosting private dinners and entertainments at his home, often featuring famous singers and well-known actors. In 1865 he was initiated into Freemasonry and was Grand Organist of the United Grand Lodge of England in 1887 during Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee. Sullivan's talent and native charm gained him the friendship of many, not only in the musical establishment, such as Grove, Chorley and Herman Klein, but also in society circles, such as Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh. Sullivan enjoyed playing tennis; according to George Grossmith, \"I have seen some bad lawn-tennis players in my time, but I never saw anyone so bad as Arthur Sullivan\".\nSullivan was devoted to his parents, particularly his mother. He corresponded regularly with her when away from London, until her death in 1882. Henry Lytton wrote, \"I believe there was never a more affectionate tie than that which existed between [Sullivan] and his mother, a very witty old lady, and one who took an exceptional pride in her son's accomplishments.\" Sullivan was also very fond of his brother Fred, whose acting career he assisted whenever possible, and of Fred's children. After Fred died at the age of 39, leaving his pregnant wife, Charlotte, with seven children under the age of 14, Sullivan visited the family often and became guardian to the children.\nIn 1883 Charlotte and six of her children emigrated to Los Angeles, California, leaving the oldest boy, \"Bertie\", in Sullivan's sole care. Despite his reservations about the move to the United States, Sullivan paid all the costs and gave substantial financial support to the family. A year later, Charlotte died, leaving the children to be raised mostly by her brother. From June to August 1885, after \"The Mikado\" opened, Sullivan visited the family in Los Angeles and took them on a sightseeing trip of the American west. Throughout the rest of his life, and in his will, he contributed financially to Fred's children, continuing to correspond with them and to be concerned with their education, marriages and financial affairs. Bertie remained with his uncle Arthur for the rest of the composer's life.\nThree of Sullivan's cousins, the daughters of his uncle John Thomas Sullivan, performed with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company: Rose, Jane (\"Jennie\") and Kate Sullivan, the first two of whom used the stage surname Hervey. Kate was a chorister who defected to the Comedy Opera Company's rival production of \"H.M.S. Pinafore\", where she had the opportunity to play the leading soprano role, Josephine, in 1879. Jennie was a D'Oyly Carte chorister for fourteen years. Rose took principal roles in many of the companion pieces that played with the Savoy operas.\nMusic.\nSullivan's works comprise 24 operas, 11 full orchestral works, ten choral works and oratorios, two ballets, one song cycle, incidental music to several plays, more than 70 hymns and anthems, over 80 songs and parlour ballads, and a body of part songs, carols, and piano and chamber pieces. The operatic output spanned his whole career, as did that of his songs and religious music. The solo piano and chamber pieces are mostly from his early years, and are generally in a Mendelssohnian style. With the exception of his \"Imperial March\", composed for a royal occasion in 1893, the large-scale orchestral concert works also date from early in the composer's career.\nInfluences.\nReviewers and scholars often cite Mendelssohn as the most important influence on Sullivan. The music for \"The Tempest\" and the \"Irish Symphony\", among other works, was seen by contemporary writers as strikingly Mendelssohnian. Percy Young writes that Sullivan's early affection for Mendelssohn remained evident throughout his composing career. Hughes remarks that although Sullivan emulated Mendelssohn in certain ways he seldom \"lapsed into those harmonic clich\u00e9s which mar some of Mendelssohn's more sentimental effusions\". When \"The Tempest\" music was first presented the \"Neue Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Musik\" identified Schumann as a stronger influence, and Benedict Taylor, writing in 2017, concurs. In a 2009 study Taylor adds Schubert as another major influence on Sullivan in his orchestral works, although \"from the beginning ... there is the peculiar, intangible stamp of Sullivan emerging confidently\". Meinhard Saremba notes that from Sullivan's first meeting with Rossini in Paris, in 1862, Rossini's output became a model for Sullivan's comic opera music, \"as evidenced in several rhythmic patterns and constructions of long finales\".\nAs a young man, Sullivan's conservative musical education led him to follow in the conventions of his predecessors. Later he became more adventurous; Richard Silverman, writing in 2009, points to the influence of Liszt in later works \u2013 a harmonic ambiguity and chromaticism \u2013 so that by the time of \"The Golden Legend\" Sullivan had abandoned a home key altogether for the prelude. Sullivan disliked much of Wagner's Musikdrama, but he modelled the overture to \"The Yeomen of the Guard\" on the prelude of \"Die Meistersinger\", which he described as \"the greatest comic opera ever written\". Saremba writes that in works from his middle and later years, Sullivan was inspired by Verdi's example both in details of orchestration, and in \"la tinta musical\" \u2013 the individual musical character of a piece \u2013 ranging from the \"nautical air of \"H.M.S Pinafore\"\" to \"the swift Mediterranean lightness of \"The Gondoliers\"\" and \"the bleakness of Torquilstone in \"Ivanhoe\"\".\nMethod of composition and text setting.\nSullivan told an interviewer, Arthur Lawrence, \"I don't use the piano in composition \u2013 that would limit me terribly\". Sullivan explained that his process was not to wait for inspiration, but \"to dig for it.\u00a0... I decide on [the rhythm] before I come to the question of melody.\u00a0... I mark out the metre in dots and dashes, and not until I have quite settled on the rhythm do I proceed to actual notation.\" Sullivan's text setting, compared with that of his 19th century English predecessors or his European contemporaries, was \"vastly more sensitive.\u00a0... Sullivan's operatic style attempts to create for itself a uniquely English text-music synthesis\", and, in addition, by adopting a conservative musical style, he was able to achieve \"the clarity to match Gilbert's finely honed wit with musical wit of his own\".\nIn composing the Savoy operas, Sullivan wrote the vocal lines of the musical numbers first, and these were given to the actors. He, or an assistant, improvised a piano accompaniment at the early rehearsals; he wrote the orchestrations later, after he had seen what Gilbert's stage business would be. He left the overtures until last and sometimes delegated their composition, based on his outlines, to his assistants, often adding his suggestions or corrections. Those Sullivan wrote himself include \"Thespis\", \"Iolanthe\", \"Princess Ida\", \"The Yeomen of the Guard\", \"The Gondoliers\", \"The Grand Duke\" and probably \"Utopia, Limited\". Most of the overtures are structured as a pot-pourri of tunes from the operas in three sections: fast, slow and fast. Those for \"Iolanthe\" and \"The Yeomen of the Guard\" are written in a modified sonata form.\nMelody and rhythm.\n\"The Musical Times\" noted that Sullivan's tunes, at least in the comic operas, appeal to the professional as much as to the layman: his continental contemporaries such as Saint-Sa\u00ebns and the Viennese critic Eduard Hanslick held the Savoy operas in high regard. Hughes writes, \"When Sullivan wrote what we call 'a good tune' it was nearly always 'good music' as well. Outside the ranks of the giants there are few other composers of whom the same could be said.\" Although his melodies sprang from rhythm, some of his themes may have been prompted by his chosen instrumentation or his harmonic techniques.\nIn the comic operas, where many numbers are in verse-plus-refrain form, Sullivan shaped his melodies to provide a climax for the verse, capped by an overall climax in the refrain. Hughes cites \"If you go in\" (\"Iolanthe\") as an example. He adds that Sullivan rarely reached the same class of excellence in instrumental works, where he had no librettist to feed his imagination. Even with Gilbert, on those occasions when the librettist wrote in unvaried metre, Sullivan often followed suit and produced phrases of simple repetition, such as in \"Love Is a Plaintive Song\" (\"Patience\") and \"A Man Who Would Woo a Fair Maid\" (\"The Yeomen of the Guard\").\nSullivan preferred to write in major keys, overwhelmingly in the Savoy operas, and even in his serious works. Examples of his rare excursions into minor keys include the long E minor melody in the first movement of the \"Irish Symphony\", \"Go Away, Madam\" in the Act I finale of \"Iolanthe\" (echoing Verdi and Beethoven) and the execution march in the Act I finale of \"The Yeomen of the Guard\".\nHarmony and counterpoint.\nSullivan was trained in the classical style, and contemporary music did not greatly attract him. Harmonically his early works used the conventional formulae of early-nineteenth-century composers including Mendelssohn, Auber, Donizetti, Balfe and Schubert. Hughes comments that harmonic contrast in the Savoy works is enhanced by Sullivan's characteristic modulation between keys, as in \"Expressive Glances\" (\"Princess Ida\"), where he negotiates smoothly E major, C sharp minor and C major, or \"Then One of Us will Be a Queen\" (\"The Gondoliers\"), where he writes in F major, D flat major and D minor.\nWhen reproached for using consecutive fifths in \"Cox and Box\", Sullivan replied \"if 5ths turn up it doesn't matter, so long as there is no offence to the ear.\" Both Hughes and Jacobs in \"Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians\" comment adversely on Sullivan's overuse of tonic pedals, usually in the bass, which Hughes attributes to \"lack of enterprise or even downright laziness\". Another Sullivan trademark criticised by Hughes is the repeated use of the chord of the augmented fourth at moments of pathos. In his serious works, Sullivan attempted to avoid harmonic devices associated with the Savoy operas, with the result, according to Hughes, that \"The Golden Legend\" is a \"hotch-potch of harmonic styles\".\nOne of Sullivan's best-known devices is what Jacobs terms his \"'counterpoint of characters': the presentation by different personages of two seemingly independent tunes which later come together\" simultaneously. He was not the first composer to combine themes in this way, but in Jacobs's phrase it became almost \"the trademark of Sullivan's operetta style\". Sometimes the melodies were for solo voices, as in \"I Am So Proud\" (\"The Mikado\"), which combines three melodic lines. Other examples are in choruses, where typically a graceful tune for the women is combined with a robust one for the men. Examples include \"When the Foeman Bares his Steel\" (\"The Pirates of Penzance\"), \"In a Doleful Train\" (\"Patience\") and \"Welcome, Gentry\" (\"Ruddigore\"). In \"How Beautifully Blue the Sky\" (\"The Pirates of Penzance\"), one theme is given to the chorus (in 2/4 time) and the other to solo voices (in 3/4).\nSullivan rarely composed fugues. Examples are from the \"Epilogue\" to \"The Golden Legend\" and \"Victoria and Merrie England\". In the Savoy operas, fugal style is reserved for making fun of legal solemnity in \"Trial by Jury\" and \"Iolanthe\" (e.g., the Lord Chancellor's leitmotif in the latter). Less formal counterpoint is employed in numbers such as \"Brightly Dawns Our Wedding Day\" (\"The Mikado\") and \"When the Buds Are Blossoming\" (\"Ruddigore\").\nOrchestration.\nHughes concludes his chapter on Sullivan's orchestration: \"[I]n this vitally important sector of the composer's art he deserves to rank as a master.\" Sullivan was a competent player of at least four orchestral instruments (flute, clarinet, trumpet and trombone) and technically a most skilful orchestrator. Though sometimes inclined to indulge in grandiosity when writing for a full symphony orchestra, he was adept in using smaller forces to the maximum effect. Young writes that orchestral players generally like playing Sullivan's music: \"Sullivan never asked his players to do what was either uncongenial or impracticable.\"\nSullivan's orchestra for the Savoy operas was typical of the theatre orchestra of his era: 2 flutes (+ piccolo), oboe, 2 clarinets, bassoon, 2 horns, 2 cornets, 2 trombones, timpani, percussion and strings. According to Geoffrey Toye, the number of players in Sullivan's Savoy Theatre orchestras was a \"minimum\" of 31. Sullivan argued hard for an increase in the pit orchestra's size, and, starting with \"The Yeomen of the Guard\", the orchestra was augmented with a second bassoon and a second tenor trombone. He generally orchestrated each score at almost the last moment, noting that the accompaniment for an opera had to wait until he saw the staging, so that he could judge how heavily or lightly to orchestrate each part of the music. For his large-scale orchestral pieces, which often employed very large forces, Sullivan added a second oboe part, sometimes double bassoon and bass clarinet, more horns, trumpets, tuba, and occasionally an organ and/or a harp.\nOne of the most recognisable features in Sullivan's orchestration is his woodwind scoring. Hughes especially notes Sullivan's clarinet writing, exploiting all registers and colours of the instrument, and his particular fondness for oboe solos. For instance, the \"Irish Symphony\" contains two long solo oboe passages in succession, and in the Savoy operas there are many shorter examples. In the operas, and also in concert works, another characteristic Sullivan touch is his fondness for pizzicato passages for the string sections. Hughes instances \"Kind Sir, You Cannot Have the Heart\" (\"The Gondoliers\"), \"Free From his Fetters Grim\" (\"The Yeomen of the Guard\") and \"In Vain to Us You Plead\" (\"Iolanthe\").\nMusical quotations and parodies.\nThroughout the Savoy operas, and occasionally in other works, Sullivan quotes or imitates well-known themes or parodies the styles of famous composers. On occasion he may have echoed his predecessors unconsciously: Hughes cites a Handelian influence in \"Hereupon We're Both Agreed\" (\"The Yeomen of the Guard\"), and Rodney Milnes called \"Sighing Softly\" in \"The Pirates of Penzance\" \"a song plainly inspired by \u2013 and indeed worthy of \u2013 Sullivan's hero, Schubert\". Edward Greenfield found a theme in the slow movement of the \"Irish Symphony\" \"an outrageous crib\" from Schubert's \"Unfinished\" Symphony. In early pieces, Sullivan drew on Mendelssohn's style in his music for \"The Tempest\", Auber's in his \"Henry VIII\" music and Gounod's in \"The Light of the World\". The influence of Mendelssohn pervades the fairy music in \"Iolanthe\". \"The Golden Legend\" shows the influence of Liszt and Wagner.\nSullivan adopted traditional musical forms, such as madrigals in \"The Mikado\", \"Ruddigore\" and \"The Yeomen of the Guard\" and glees in \"H.M.S. Pinafore\" and \"The Mikado\", and the Venetian barcarolle in \"The Gondoliers\". He made use of dance styles to enhance the sense of time or place in various scenes: gavottes in \"Ruddigore\" and \"The Gondoliers\"; a country dance in \"The Sorcerer\"; a nautical hornpipe in \"Ruddigore\"; and the Spanish cachucha and Italian saltarello and tarantella in \"The Gondoliers\". Occasionally he drew on influences from further afield. In \"The Mikado\", he used an old Japanese war song, and his 1882 trip to Egypt inspired musical styles in his later opera \"The Rose of Persia\".\nElsewhere, Sullivan wrote undisguised parody. Of the sextet \"I Hear the Soft Note\" in \"Patience\", he said to the singers, \"I think you will like this. It is Dr Arne and Purcell at their best.\" In his comic operas, he followed Offenbach's lead in lampooning the idioms of French and Italian opera, such as those of Donizetti, Bellini and Verdi. Examples of his operatic parody include Mabel's aria \"Poor Wand'ring One\" in \"The Pirates of Penzance\", the duet \"Who Are You, Sir?\" from \"Cox and Box\", and the whispered plans for elopement in \"This Very Night\" in \"H.M.S. Pinafore\", parodying the conspirators' choruses in Verdi's \"Il trovatore\" and \"Rigoletto\". The mock-jingoistic \"He Is an Englishman\" in \"H.M.S. Pinafore\" and choral passages in \"The Zoo\" satirise patriotic British tunes such as Arne's \"Rule, Britannia!\". The chorus \"With Catlike Tread\" from \"The Pirates\" parodies Verdi's \"Anvil Chorus\" from \"Il trovatore\".\nHughes calls Bouncer's song in \"Cox and Box\" \"a jolly Handelian parody\" and notes a strong Handelian flavour to Arac's song in Act III of \"Princess Ida\". In \"A More Humane Mikado\", at the words \"Bach interwoven with Spohr and Beethoven\", the clarinet and bassoon quote the fugue subject of Bach's Fantasia and Fugue in G minor. Sullivan sometimes used Wagnerian leitmotifs for both comic and dramatic effect. In \"Iolanthe\", a distinctive four-note theme is associated with the title character, the Lord Chancellor has a fugal motif, and the Fairy Queen's music parodies that of Wagner heroines such as Br\u00fcnnhilde. In \"The Yeomen of the Guard\" the Tower of London is evoked by its own motif. This use of the leitmotif technique is repeated and developed further in \"Ivanhoe\".\nReputation and criticism.\nEarly reception.\nSullivan's critical reputation has undergone extreme changes since the 1860s when critics, struck by his potential, hailed him as the long-awaited great English composer. His incidental music to \"The Tempest\" was received with acclaim at the Crystal Palace, just before his 20th birthday, in April 1862. \"The Athenaeum\" commented:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It\u00a0... may mark an epoch in English music, or we shall be greatly disappointed. Years on years have elapsed since we have heard a work by so young an artist so full of promise, so full of fancy, showing so much conscientiousness, so much skill, and so few references to any model elect.\nHis \"Irish Symphony\" of 1866 won similarly enthusiastic praise, but as Arthur Jacobs notes, \"The first rapturous outburst of enthusiasm for Sullivan as an orchestral composer did not last.\" A comment typical of those that followed him throughout his career was that \"Sullivan's unquestionable talent should make him doubly careful not to mistake popular applause for artistic appreciation.\"\nWhen Sullivan turned to comic opera with Gilbert, the serious critics began to express disapproval. The music critic Peter Gammond writes of \"misapprehensions and prejudices, delivered to our door by the Victorian firm Musical Snobs Ltd.\u00a0... frivolity and high spirits were sincerely seen as elements that could not be exhibited by anyone who was to be admitted to the sanctified society of Art.\" As early as 1877 \"The London Figaro\" commented that Sullivan \"wilfully throws his opportunity away.\u00a0... He possesses all the natural ability to have given us an English opera, and, instead, he affords us a little more-or-less excellent fooling.\" Few critics denied the excellence of Sullivan's theatre scores. \"The Theatre\" commented, \"\"Iolanthe\" sustains Dr. Sullivan's reputation as the most spontaneous, fertile, and scholarly composer of comic opera this country has ever produced.\" Comic opera, no matter how skilfully crafted, was viewed as an intrinsically lower form of art than oratorio. \"The Athenaeum's\" review of \"The Martyr of Antioch\" declared: \"[I]t is an advantage to have the composer of \"H.M.S. Pinafore\" occupying himself with a worthier form of art.\"\nKnighthood and later years.\nSullivan's knighthood in 1883 gave the serious music critics further ammunition. \"The Musical Review\" of that year observed:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEven Sullivan's friend George Grove wrote: \"Surely the time has come when so able and experienced a master of voice, orchestra, and stage effect \u2013 master, too, of so much genuine sentiment \u2013 may apply his gifts to a serious opera on some subject of abiding human or natural interest.\" Sullivan finally redeemed himself in critical eyes with \"The Golden Legend\" in 1886. \"The Observer\" hailed it as a \"triumph of English art\". \"The World\" called it \"one of the greatest creations we have had for many years. Original, bold, inspired, grand in conception, in execution, in treatment, it is a composition which will make an 'epoch' and which will carry the name of its composer higher on the wings of fame and glory.\u00a0... The effect of the public performance was unprecedented.\"\nHopes for a new departure were expressed in \"The Daily Telegraph's\" review of \"The Yeomen of the Guard\" (1888), Sullivan's most serious opera to that point: \"[T]he music follows the book to a higher plane, and we have a genuine English opera, forerunner of many others, let us hope, and possibly significant of an advance towards a national lyric stage.\" Sullivan's only grand opera, \"Ivanhoe\" (1891), received generally favourable reviews, although J. A. Fuller Maitland, in \"The Times\", expressed reservations, writing that the opera's \"best portions rise so far above anything else that Sir Arthur Sullivan has given to the world, and have such force and dignity, that it is not difficult to forget the drawbacks which may be found in the want of interest in much of the choral writing, and the brevity of the concerted solo parts.\" Sullivan's 1897 ballet \"Victoria and Merrie England\" was one of several late pieces that won praise from most critics: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Sir Arthur Sullivan's music is music for the people. There is no attempt made to force on the public the dullness of academic experience. The melodies are all as fresh as last year's wine, and as exhilarating as sparkling champagne. There is not one tune which tires the hearing, and in the matter of orchestration our only humorist has let himself run riot, not being handicapped with libretto, and the gain is enormous.\u00a0... All through we have orchestration of infinite delicacy, tunes of alarming simplicity, but never a tinge of vulgarity.\nAlthough the more solemn members of the musical establishment could not forgive Sullivan for writing music that was both comic and accessible, he was, nevertheless, \"the nation's \"de facto\" composer laureate\". His obituary in \"The Times\" called him England's \"most conspicuous composer ... the musician who had such power to charm all classes. ... The critic and the student found new beauties at every fresh hearing. What ... set Sullivan in popular esteem far above all the other English composers of his day was the tunefulness of his music, that quality in it by which ... [it] was immediately recognized as a joyous contribution to the gaiety of life. ... Sullivan's name stood as a synonym for music in England.\nPosthumous reputation.\nIn the decade after his death, Sullivan's reputation sank considerably among music critics. In 1901 Fuller Maitland took issue with the generally laudatory tone of the obituaries: \"Is there anywhere a case quite parallel to that of Sir Arthur Sullivan, who began his career with a work which at once stamped him as a genius, and to the height of which he only rarely attained throughout life?\u00a0... It is because such great natural gifts \u2013 gifts greater, perhaps, than fell to any English musician since\u00a0... Purcell \u2013 were so very seldom employed in work worthy of them.\" Edward Elgar, to whom Sullivan had been particularly kind, rose to Sullivan's defence, branding Fuller Maitland's obituary \"the shady side of musical criticism\u00a0... that foul unforgettable episode\".\nFuller Maitland's followers, including Ernest Walker, also dismissed Sullivan as \"merely the idle singer of an empty evening\". As late as 1966 Frank Howes, a music critic for \"The Times\", condemned Sullivan for a \"lack of sustained effort\u00a0... a fundamental lack of seriousness towards his art [and] inability to perceive the smugness, the sentimentality and banality of the Mendelssohnian detritus\u00a0... to remain content with the flattest and most obvious rhythms, this yielding to a fatal facility, that excludes Sullivan from the ranks of the good composers.\" Thomas Dunhill wrote in 1928 that Sullivan's \"music has suffered in an extraordinary degree from the vigorous attacks which have been made upon it in professional circles. These attacks have succeeded in surrounding the composer with a kind of barricade of prejudice which must be swept away before justice can be done to his genius.\"\nSir Henry Wood continued to perform Sullivan's serious music. In 1942 Wood presented a Sullivan centenary concert at the Royal Albert Hall, but it was not until the 1960s that Sullivan's music other than the Savoy operas began to be widely revived. In 1960 Hughes published the first full-length book about Sullivan's music \"which, while taking note of his weaknesses (which are many) and not hesitating to castigate his lapses from good taste (which were comparatively rare) [attempted] to view them in perspective against the wider background of his sound musicianship.\" The work of the Sir Arthur Sullivan Society, founded in 1977, and books about Sullivan by musicians such as Young (1971) and Jacobs (1986) contributed to the re-evaluation of Sullivan's serious music. The \"Irish Symphony\" had its first professional recording in 1968, and many of Sullivan's non-Gilbert works have since been recorded. Scholarly critical editions of an increasing number of Sullivan's works have been published.\nIn 1957 a review in \"The Times\" explained Sullivan's contributions to \"the continued vitality of the Savoy operas\": \"Gilbert's lyrics ... take on extra point and sparkle when set to Sullivan's music.\u00a0... [Sullivan, too, is] a delicate wit, whose airs have a precision, a neatness, a grace, and a flowing melody\". A 2000 article in \"The Musical Times\" by Nigel Burton noted the resurgence of Sullivan's reputation beyond the comic operas:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nRecordings.\nOn 14 August 1888 George Gouraud introduced Thomas Edison's phonograph to London in a press conference, including the playing of a piano and cornet recording of Sullivan's \"The Lost Chord\", one of the first recordings of music ever made. At a party on 5 October 1888 given to demonstrate the technology, Sullivan recorded a speech to be sent to Edison, saying, in part: \"I am astonished and somewhat terrified at the result of this evening's experiments: astonished at the wonderful power you have developed, and terrified at the thought that so much hideous and bad music may be put on record forever. But all the same I think it is the most wonderful thing that I have ever experienced, and I congratulate you with all my heart on this wonderful discovery.\" These recordings were found in the Edison Library in New Jersey in the 1950s:\nThe first commercial recordings of Sullivan's music, beginning in 1898, were of individual numbers from the Savoy operas. In 1917 the Gramophone Company (HMV) produced the first album of a complete Gilbert and Sullivan opera, \"The Mikado\", followed by eight more. Electrical recordings of most of the operas issued by HMV and Victor followed from the 1920s, supervised by Rupert D'Oyly Carte. The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company continued to produce recordings until 1979. After the copyrights expired, recordings were made by opera companies such as Gilbert and Sullivan for All and Australian Opera, and Sir Malcolm Sargent and Sir Charles Mackerras each conducted audio sets of several Savoy operas. Since 1994, the International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival has released professional and amateur CDs and videos of its productions and other Sullivan recordings, and Ohio Light Opera has recorded several of the operas in the 21st century.\nSullivan's non-Savoy works were infrequently recorded until the 1960s. A few of his songs were put on disc in the early years of the 20th century, including versions of \"The Lost Chord\" by Enrico Caruso and Clara Butt. The first of many recordings of the \"Overture di Ballo\" was made in 1932, conducted by Sargent. The \"Irish Symphony\" was first recorded in 1968 under Sir Charles Groves. Since then, much of Sullivan's serious music and his operas without Gilbert have been recorded, including the \"Cello Concerto\" by Julian Lloyd Webber (1986); and \"The Rose of Persia\" (1999); \"The Golden Legend\" (2001); \"Ivanhoe\" (2009); and \"The Masque at Kenilworth\" and \"On Shore and Sea\" (2014), conducted by, respectively, Tom Higgins, Ronald Corp, David Lloyd-Jones and Richard Bonynge. In 2017 Chandos Records released an album, \"Songs\", which includes \"The Window\" and 35 individual Sullivan songs.

The term lacks a precise authoritative definition, although in the 21st century designations of Indigenous peoples have focused on self-identification, cultural difference from other groups in a state, a special relationship with their traditional territory, and an experience of subjugation and discrimination under a dominant cultural model.\nEstimates of the population of Indigenous peoples range from 250 million to 600 million. There are some 5,000 distinct Indigenous peoples spread across every inhabited climate zone and inhabited continent of the world. Most Indigenous peoples are in a minority in the state or traditional territory they inhabit and have experienced domination by other groups, especially non-Indigenous peoples. Although many Indigenous peoples have experienced colonization by settlers from European nations, Indigenous identity is not determined by Western colonization.\nThe rights of Indigenous peoples are outlined in national legislation, treaties and international law. The 1989 International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples protects Indigenous peoples from discrimination and specifies their rights to development, customary laws, lands, territories and resources, employment, education and health. In 2007, the United Nations (UN) adopted a Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples including their rights to self-determination and to protect their cultures, identities, languages, ceremonies, and access to employment, health, education and natural resources.\nIndigenous peoples continue to face threats to their sovereignty, economic well-being, languages, cultural heritage, and access to the resources on which their cultures depend. In the 21st century, Indigenous groups and advocates for Indigenous peoples have highlighted numerous apparent violations of the rights of Indigenous peoples.\nEtymology.\n\"Indigenous\" is derived from the Latin word , meaning \"sprung from the land, native\". The Latin \"\" is based on the Old Latin \"in, within\" + \"gignere\" \"to beget, produce\". \"Indu\" is an extended form of the Proto-Indo-European \"en\" or \"in\".\nDefinitions.\nThere is no generally accepted definition of Indigenous peoples in the United Nations or international law. Various national and international organizations, non-government organizations, governments, Indigenous groups and scholars have developed definitions or have declined to provide a definition.\nHistorical.\nAs a reference to a group of people, the term \"indigenous\" was first used by Europeans to differentiate the Indigenous peoples of the Americas from enslaved Africans. The first known use was by Sir Thomas Browne in 1646, who wrote \"and although in many parts thereof there be at present swarms of \"Negroes\" serving under the \"Spaniard\", yet were they all transported from \"Africa\", since the discovery of \"Columbus\"; and are not indigenous or proper natives of \"America\".\"\nIn the 1970s, the term was used as a way of linking the experiences, issues, and struggles of groups of colonized people across international borders. At this time 'indigenous people(s)' also began to be used to describe a legal category in Indigenous law created in international and national legislation. The use of the plural 'peoples' recognizes the cultural differences between various Indigenous peoples.\nThe first meeting of the United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Populations (WGIP) was on 9 August 1982 and this date is now celebrated as the International Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples.\nRecent.\nIn the 21st century, the concept of Indigenous peoples is understood in a wider context than only the colonial experience. The focus has been on self-identification as indigenous peoples, cultural difference from other groups in a state, a special relationship with their traditional territory, and an experience of subjugation and discrimination under a dominant cultural model.\nUnited Nations.\nNo definition of Indigenous peoples has been adopted by a United Nations agency. The Secretariat of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues states, \"in the case of the concept of 'indigenous peoples', the prevailing view today is that no formal universal definition of the term is necessary, given that a single definition will inevitably be either over- or under-inclusive, making sense in some societies but not in others.\"\nHowever, a number of UN agencies have provided statements of coverage for particular international agreements concerning Indigenous peoples or \"working definitions\" for particular reports.\nThe International Labour Organization's (ILO) Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989 (ILO Convention No. 169), states that the convention covers\npeoples in independent countries who are regarded as indigenous on account of their descent from the populations which inhabited the country, or a geographical region to which the country belongs, at the time of conquest or colonisation or the establishment of present state boundaries and who, irrespective of their legal status, retain some or all of their own social, economic, cultural and political institutions.\nThe convention also covers \"tribal peoples\" who are distinguished from Indigenous peoples and described as \"tribal peoples in independent countries whose social, cultural and economic conditions distinguish them from other sections of the national community and whose status is regulated wholly or partially by their own customs or traditions or by special laws or regulations.\"\nThe convention states that self-identification as indigenous or tribal is a fundamental criterion for determining the groups to which the convention applies. The UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples does not define Indigenous peoples but affirms their right to self-determination including determining their own identity.\nInter-American Commission on Human Rights.\nThe Inter-American Commission on Human Rights does not provide a definition of Indigenous peoples stating that, \"such a definition is not necessary for purposes of protecting their human rights.\" In determining coverage of Indigenous peoples, the commission uses the criteria developed in documents such as ILO Convention No. 169 and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The commission states that self-identification as indigenous is a fundamental criterion.\nWorld Bank.\nThe World Bank states, \"Indigenous Peoples are distinct social and cultural groups that share collective ancestral ties to the lands and natural resources where they live, occupy or from which they have been displaced.\"\nAmnesty International.\nAmnesty International does not provide a definition of Indigenous peoples but states that they can be identified according to certain characteristics:\nScholars.\nAcademics and other scholars have developed various definitions of Indigenous peoples. In 1986\u201387, Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez Cobo, the UN Special Rapporteur on the problem of discrimination against indigenous populations, developed the following \"working definition\":\nIndigenous communities, peoples, and nations are those that, having a historical continuity with pre-invasion and pre-colonial societies that developed on their territories, consider themselves distinct from other sectors of the societies now prevailing in those territories, or parts of them. They form at present non-dominant sectors of society and are determined to preserve, develop, and transmit to future generations their ancestral territories, and their ethnic identity, as the basis of their continued existence as peoples, in accordance with their own cultural patterns, social institutions and legal systems.\nMart\u00ednez Cobo states that the following factors are relevant to historical continuity: occupation of ancestral lands, or at least of part of them; common ancestry with the original occupants of these lands; cultural factors such as religion, tribalism, dress, etc.; language; residence in certain parts of the country, or in certain regions of the world; and other relevant factors.\nIn 2004, professor of human rights law and policy James Anaya, defined Indigenous peoples as \"living descendants of pre-invasion inhabitants of lands now dominated by others. They are culturally distinct groups that find themselves engulfed by other settler societies born of forces of empire and conquest\".\nIn 2012, Indigenous studies scholars Eve Tuck and K. Wayne Yang proposed a criterion based on accounts of origin: \"Indigenous peoples are those who have creation stories, not colonization stories, about how we/they came to be in a particular place \u2013 indeed how we/they came to be a place. Our/their relationships to land comprise our/their epistemologies, ontologies, and cosmologies\". Indigenous peoples such as the Maasai and the M\u0101ori have oral traditional histories involving migration to their current location from somewhere else.\nAnthropologist Manvir Singh states that the term may lack coherence, pointing to inconsistencies in which ethnic groups are called Indigenous or not, and notes several scholars who suggest that it instead acts as a relabeling of discredited and colonial ideas about \"primitive\" people. Singh states that some Indigenous people argue that the term and identity has resulted in pressure to appear \"primordial\" and \"unchanging\", and erases complex and modern identities.\nOther scholars, such as Dominic O'Sullivan and Marjo Lindroth, have analysed and defined Indigenous peoples as those in a specific power-relationship with the state, called \"indigeneity\", that has come about due to the process of settler-colonialism.\nOther views.\nIt is sometimes argued that all Africans are Indigenous to Africa, all Asians are Indigenous to parts of Asia, or that there can be no Indigenous peoples in countries which did not experience large-scale Western settler colonialism. Many countries have avoided the term \"Indigenous peoples\" or have denied that indigenous peoples exist in their territory, and have classified minorities who identify as Indigenous in other ways, such as 'hill tribes' in Thailand, 'scheduled tribes' in India, 'national minorities' in China, 'cultural minorities' in the Philippines, 'isolated and alien peoples' in Indonesia, and various other terms.\nHistory.\nClassical antiquity.\nGreek sources of the Classical period acknowledge Indigenous people whom they referred to as \"Pelasgians\". Ancient writers saw these people either as the ancestors of the Greeks, or as an earlier group of people who inhabited Greece before the Greeks. The disposition and precise identity of this former group is elusive, and sources such as Homer, Hesiod and Herodotus give varying, partially mythological accounts. Dionysius of Halicarnassus in his book, \"Roman Antiquities\", gives a synoptic interpretation of the Pelasgians based on the sources available to him then, concluding that Pelasgians were Greek.\nAfrica.\nIn European late antiquity, many Berbers, Copts and Nubians of north Africa converted to various forms of Christianity under Roman rule, although elements of traditional religious beliefs were retained. Following the Arab invasions of North Africa in the 7th century, many Berbers were enslaved or recruited into the army. The majority of Berbers, however, remained nomadic pastoralists who also engaged in trade as far as sub-Saharan Africa. Coptic Egyptians remained in possession of their lands and many preserved their language and Christian religion. By the 10th century, however, the majority of the population of north Africa spoke Arabic and practiced Islam.From 1402, the Guanche of the Canary Islands resisted Spanish attempts at colonization. The islands finally came under Spanish control in 1496. Mohamed Adhikari has called the conquest of the islands a genocide.\nEarly 15th-century Portuguese exploration of the west coast of Africa was motivated by a quest for gold and crusading against Islam. Portugal's first attempt at colonization in what is now Senegal ended in failure. In the 1470s, the Portuguese established a fortified trading post on the West coast of Africa, south of the Akan goldfields. The Portuguese engaged in extensive trade of goods for gold and, in later years, slaves for their sugar plantations in the islands off West Africa and in the New World. In 1488, Portuguese ships rounded the Cape of Good Hope and by the 17th century, Portugal had established seaborn trading routes and fortified coastal trading posts from West Africa to India and Southern China, and a settler colony in Brazil.\nIn 1532, the first African slaves were transported directly to the Americas. The trade in slaves expanded sharply in the 17th century, with the involvement of the French, Dutch and English, before declining in the 19th century. At least 12\u00a0million slaves were transported from Africa. The slave trade increased inter-tribal warfare and stunted population growth and economic development in the west African interior.\nAmericas.\nIndigenous encounters with Europeans increased during the age of discovery. The Europeans were motivated by a range of factors including trade, the exploitation of natural resources, spreading Christianity, and establishing strategic military bases, colonies and settlements.\nFrom 1492, the Arawak peoples of the Caribbean islands encountered Spanish colonizers initially led by Christopher Columbus. The Spanish enslaved some of the native population and forced others to work on farms and gold mines in a system of labor called \"encomienda\". Spanish settlements spread from Hispaniola to Puerto Rico, the Bahamas and Cuba, leading to a severe decline in the Indigenous populations from disease, malnutrition, settler violence and cultural disruption.\nIn the 1520s, the peoples of Mesoamerica encountered the Spanish who entered their lands in search of gold and other resources. Some indigenous peoples chose to ally with the Spanish to end Aztec rule. The Spanish incursions led to the conquest of the Aztec Empire and its fall. The Cempoalans, Tlaxcalans and other allies of the Spanish were given some autonomy, but the Spanish were de facto rulers of Mexico. Smallpox devastated the indigenous population and aided the Spanish conquest.\nIn 1530, the Spanish sailed south from Panama to the lands of the Inca Empire in the west of South America. The Inca, weakened by a smallpox epidemic and civil war, were defeated by the Spanish at Cajamarca in 1532, and the emperor Atahualpa was captured and executed. The Spanish appointed a puppet emperor and captured the Inca capital of Cuzco with the support of a number of native peoples. The Spanish established a new capital in 1535 and defeated an Inca rebellion in 1537, thus consolidating the conquest of Peru.\nIn the 1560s, the Spanish established colonies in Florida and in 1598 founded a colony in New Mexico. However, the heartland of the Spanish colonies remained New Spain (including Mexico and most of Central America) and Peru (including most of South America).\nIn the 17th century, French, English and Dutch trading posts multiplied in northern America to exploit whaling, fishing and fur trading. French settlements progressed up the St Lawrence river to the Great Lakes and down the Mississippi to Louisiana. English and Dutch settlements multiplied down the Atlantic coast from modern Massachusetts to Georgia. Native peoples formed alliances with the Europeans in order to promote trade, preserve their autonomy, and gain allies in conflicts with other native peoples. However, horses and new weapons made inter-tribal conflicts more deadly and the native population was devastated by introduced diseases. Native peoples also experienced losses from violent conflict with the colonists and the progressive dispossession of their traditional lands.\nIn 1492, the population of the Americas as a whole was about 50 to 100\u00a0million. By 1700, introduced diseases had reduced the native population by 90%. European migration and transfer of slaves from Africa reduced the native population to a minority. By 1800 the population of North America comprised about 5\u00a0million Europeans and their descendants, one million Africans and 600,000 indigenous Americans.\nNative populations also encountered new animals and plants introduced by Europeans. These included pigs, horses, mules, sheep and cattle; wheat, barley, rye, oats, grasses and grapevines. These exotic animals and plants radically transformed the local environment and disrupted traditional agriculture and hunting practices.\nOceania.\nThe indigenous populations of the Pacific had increasing contact with Europeans in the 18th century as British, French and Spanish expeditions explored the region. The natives of Tahiti had encounters with the expeditions of Wallis (1766), Bougainville (1768), Cook (1769) and many others before being colonized by the French. The indigenous inhabitants of the Hawaiian Islands first encountered Europeans in 1778 when Cook explored the region. Following increasing contact with European missionaries, traders and scientific expeditions, the indigenous population fell before their lands were annexed by the United States in 1893.\nThe M\u0101ori of New Zealand also had sporadic encounters with Europeans in the 17th and 18th centuries. Following encounters with Cook's exploration parties in 1769\u201370, New Zealand was visited by numerous European and North American whaling, sealing, and trading ships. From the early 19th century, Christian missionaries began to settle New Zealand, eventually converting most of the M\u0101ori population. The M\u0101ori population declined to around 40% of its pre-contact level during the 19th century; introduced diseases were the major factor. New Zealand became a British Crown colony in 1841.\nThe Aboriginal inhabitants of Australia, after brief encounters with European explorers in the 17th and 18th centuries, had extensive contact with Europeans when the continent was progressively colonized by the British from 1788. During colonization, the Aboriginal people experienced depopulation from disease and settler violence, dispossession of their land, and severe disruption of their traditional cultures. By 1850, indigenous peoples were a minority in Australia.\nEuropean justifications for colonization.\nFrom the 15th to the 19th centuries, European powers used a number of rationales for the colonization of newly encountered lands populated by indigenous peoples. These included a duty to spread the Gospel to non-Christians, to bring civilization to barbarian peoples, a natural law right to explore and trade freely with other peoples, and a right to settle and cultivate uninhabited or uncultivated land which they considered \"terra nullius\" (\"no one's land\").\nRobert J. Miller, Jacinta Ruru, Larissa Behrendt and Tracey Lindberg argue that European powers rationalized their colonization of the New World by the discovery doctrine, which they trace back to papal decrees authorizing Spain and Portugal to conquer newly discovered non-Christian lands and convert their populations to Christianity. Kent McNeil, however, states, \"While Spain and Portugal favoured discovery and papal grants because it was generally in their interests to do so, France and Britain relied more on symbolic acts, colonial charters, and occupation.\" Benton and Strauman argue that European powers often adopted multiple, sometimes contradictory, legal rationales for their acquisition of territory as a deliberate strategy in defending their claims against European rivals.\nSettler independence and continuing colonialism.\nAlthough the establishment of colonies throughout the world by various European powers aimed to expand those powers' wealth and influence, settler populations in some localities became anxious to assert their own autonomy. For example, settler independence movements in thirteen of the British American colonies were successful by 1783, following the American Revolutionary War. This resulted in the establishment of the United States of America as an entity separate from the British Empire. The United States continued and expanded European colonial doctrine through adopting a version of the discovery doctrine as law in 1823 with the US Supreme Court case \"Johnson v. McIntosh\". Statements at the \"Johnson\" court case illuminated the United States' support for the principles of the discovery doctrine:The United States ... [and] its civilized inhabitants now hold this country. They hold, and assert in themselves, the title by which it was acquired. They maintain, as all others have maintained, that discovery gave an exclusive right to extinguish the Indian title of occupancy, either by purchase or by conquest; and gave also a right to such a degree of sovereignty, as the circumstances of the people would allow them to exercise. ... [This loss of native property and sovereignty rights was justified, the Court said, by] the character and religion of its inhabitants ... the superior genius of Europe ... [and] ample compensation to the [Indians] by bestowing on them civilization and Christianity, in exchange for unlimited independence.\nPopulation and distribution.\n21st-century estimates of the population of Indigenous peoples range from 250 million to 750\u00a0million. In 2007, Mirjan Hirch, a researcher with the Center for World Indigenous Studies, estimated the population at 750 million to a billion, comprising six to seven thousand distinct peoples. The United Nations estimated in 2009 that there were over 370\u00a0million Indigenous people living in over 90 countries worldwide, belonging to at least 5,000 distinct peoples. In 2011, the World Bank estimated 300 million indigenous peoples, including 23 million in Latin America, 106 million in China, 95 million in South Asia, 30 million in Southeast Asia, 22 million in Africa, 15 million in the Arab States and 9 million in the rest of the world. The International Labor Organization in 2019 estimated, based on census data, that there were 476 million Indigenous people in 58 countries. Both the UN and the ILO described their estimates as minimums with the latter calculated using \"the most reliable lower bound estimates available.\"\nAs there is no universally accepted definition of Indigenous Peoples, their classification as such varies between countries and organizations. In the Americas, Australia and New Zealand, Indigenous status is often applied unproblematically to groups descended from the peoples who lived there prior to European settlement. However, In Asia and Africa, Indigenous status has sometimes been rejected by certain peoples, denied by governments or applied to peoples who may not be considered \"Indigenous\" in other contexts. The concept of indigenous peoples is rarely used in Europe, where very few indigenous groups are recognized, with the exception of groups such as the S\u00e1mi.\nEnvironmental and economic benefits of the Indigenous stewardship of land.\nA WRI report mentions that \"tenure-secure\" Indigenous lands generates billions and sometimes trillions of dollars' worth of benefits in the form of carbon sequestration, reduced pollution, clean water and more. It says that tenure-secure Indigenous lands have low deforestation rates, they help to reduce GHG emissions, control erosion and flooding by anchoring soil, and provide a suite of other local, regional and global ecosystem services.\nHowever, many of these communities find themselves on the front lines of the deforestation crisis, and their lives and livelihoods threatened.\nIndigenous peoples and the environment.\nMisconceptions about the historical relationship between Indigenous populations and their landbase has informed some Westerners view of California's \"wild Eden\", which may influence policy decisions about the \"wilderness\". Some academics assumed that the only pre-Colonial human interactions with nature were as \"hunter-gatherers\". Others say that the relationship was one of \"calculated tempered use of nature as active agents of environmental change and stewardship\". They argue that a view of \"wilderness\" as uninhabited nature has resulted in removal of Indigenous inhabitants to preserve \"the wild\", and that depriving the land of traditional Indigenous practices such as controlled burns, harvesting, and seed scattering has yielded dense understory shrubbery or tickets of young trees which are inhospitable to life. Recent studies indicate that Indigenous peoples used land sustainably, without causing substantial losses of biodiversity, for thousands of years.\nA goal is to ascertain an unbiased view of Indigenous practices of resource management. Historical literature, archaeological findings, ecological field studies, and Native Peoples' cultures show indications that Indigenous land management practices were largely successful in promoting habitat heterogeneity, increasing biodiversity, and maintaining certain vegetation types, sustaining human lives while conserving natural resources.\nRecently, it has come to light that the deforestation rate of Indonesian rainforests has been far greater than estimated. Such a rate could not have been the product of globalization as understood before; rather, it seemed that ordinary local people dependent on these forests for their livelihoods are in fact \"joining distant corporations in creating uninhabitable landscapes.\"\nIn eastern Penan, three categories of misrepresentation are noticeable: The Molong concept is purely a stewardship notion of resource management. Communities or individuals take ownership of specific trees, maintaining and harvesting from them sustainably over a long period of time. Some feel this practice has been romanticized in environmentalist writings. Landscape features and particularly their names in local languages provided geographical and historical information for Penan people; whereas in environmentalist accounts, it has turned into a spiritual practice where trees and rivers represent forest spirits that are sacred to the Penan people. A typical stereotype of some environmentalists' approach to ecological ethnography is to present Indigenous \"knowledge\" of nature as \"valuable\" to the outside world because of its hidden medicinal benefits. In reality, eastern Penan populations do not identify a medicinal stream of \"knowledge\". These misrepresentations in the \"narrative\" of Indigeneity and \"value\" of Indigenous knowledge might have been helpful for Penan's people in their struggle to protect their environment, but it might also have disastrous consequences. What happens if another case did not fit in this romantic narrative, or another Indigenous knowledge did not seem beneficial to the outside world. These people were being uprooted in the first place because their communities did not fit well with the state's system of values.\nAt the 2024 United Nations Biodiversity Conference (COP16), Nations agreed to a new permanent body for Indigenous peoples, which will allow them to advise and offer their view at biodiversity COPs directly.\nIndigenous peoples by region.\nIndigenous populations are distributed in regions throughout the globe. The numbers, condition and experience of Indigenous groups may vary widely within a given region. A comprehensive survey is further complicated by sometimes contentious membership and identification.\nAfrica.\nSub-Saharan Africa.\nIn the postcolonial period, the concept of specific Indigenous peoples within the African continent has gained wider acceptance, although not without controversy. The highly diverse and numerous ethnic groups that comprise most modern, independent African states contain within them various peoples whose situation, cultures and pastoralist or hunter-gatherer lifestyles are generally marginalized and set apart from the dominant political and economic structures of the nation. Since the late 20th century these peoples have increasingly sought recognition of their rights as distinct Indigenous peoples, in both national and international contexts.\nThough the vast majority of African peoples are indigenous in the sense that they originate from the continent, identity as an \"Indigenous people\" via the modern definition of a political indigenous status is more restrictive, and certainly not every African ethnic group claims identification under these terms. Groups and communities who do claim this recognition are those who, by a variety of historical and environmental circumstances, have been placed outside of the dominant state systems, and whose traditional practices and land claims often come into conflict with the objectives and policies implemented by governments, companies and surrounding dominant societies.\nNorth Africa.\nThe indigenous peoples of North Africa predominantly comprise the Berbers in the Maghreb and the Copts and Nubians in the Nile Valley. The vast majority of them have been Arabized after the Islamic conquests under the Rashidun and Umayyad caliphates.\nAmericas.\nIndigenous peoples of the Americas are broadly recognized as being those groups and their descendants who inhabited the region before the arrival of European colonizers and settlers (i.e., pre-Columbian). Indigenous peoples who maintain, or seek to maintain, traditional ways of life are found from the high Arctic north to the southern extremities of Tierra del Fuego.\nThe impacts of historical and ongoing European colonization of the Americas on Indigenous communities have been in general quite severe, with many authorities estimating ranges of significant population decline primarily due to disease, land theft and violence. Several peoples have become extinct, or very nearly so. But there are and have been many thriving and resilient Indigenous nations and communities.\nNorth America.\nNorth America is sometimes referred to by Indigenous peoples as Abya Yala or Turtle Island.\nIn Mexico, about 11\u00a0million people, or 9% of Mexico's total population, self-reported as Indigenous in 2015, making it the country with the highest Indigenous population in North America. In the southern states of Oaxaca (65.73%) and Yucat\u00e1n (65.40%), the majority of the population is Indigenous, as reported in 2015. Other states with high populations of Indigenous peoples include Campeche (44.54%), Quintana Roo, (44.44%), Hidalgo, (36.21%), Chiapas (36.15%), Puebla (35.28%), and Guerrero (33.92%).\nIndigenous peoples in Canada comprise the First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis. The descriptors \"Indian\" and \"Eskimo\" have fallen into disuse in Canada. More currently, the term \"Aboriginal\" is being replaced with \"Indigenous\". Several national organizations in Canada changed their names from \"Aboriginal\" to \"Indigenous\". Most notable was the change of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada (AANDC) to Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada (INAC) in 2015, which then split into Indigenous Services Canada and Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Development Canada in 2017. According to the 2016 Census, there are around 1,670,000 Indigenous people in Canada. There are currently over 600 recognized First Nations governments or bands spread across Canada, such as the Cree, Mohawk, Mikmaq, Blackfoot, Coast Salish, Innu, Dene and more, with distinctive Indigenous cultures, languages, art, and music. First Nations peoples signed 11 numbered treaties across much of what is now known as Canada between 1871 and 1921, except in parts of British Columbia.\nThe Inuit have achieved a degree of administrative autonomy with the creation in 1999 of the territories of Nunavik (in Northern Quebec), Nunatsiavut (in Northern Labrador) and Nunavut, which was until 1999 a part of the Northwest Territories. The autonomous territory of Greenland within the Kingdom of Denmark is also home to a recognized Indigenous and majority population of Inuit (about 85%) who settled the area in the 13th century, displacing the Indigenous European Greenlandic Norse.\nIn the United States, the combined populations of Native Americans, Inuit and other Indigenous designations totaled 2,786,652 (constituting about 1.5% of 2003 U.S. census figures). Some 563 scheduled tribes are recognized at the federal level, and a number of others recognized at the state level.\nCentral and South America.\nIn some countries (particularly in Latin America), Indigenous peoples form a sizable component of the overall national population\u00a0\u2013 in Bolivia, they account for an estimated 56\u201370% of the total nation, and at least half of the population in Guatemala and the Andean and Amazonian nations of Peru. In English, Indigenous peoples are collectively referred to by different names that vary by region, age and ethnicity of speakers, with no one term being universally accepted. While still in use in-group, and in many names of organizations, \"Indian\" is less popular among younger people, who tend to prefer \"Indigenous\" or simply \"Native\", with most preferring to use the specific name of their tribe or Nation instead of generalities. In Spanish or Portuguese speaking countries, one finds the use of terms such as \u00edndios, \"pueblos ind\u00edgenas\", \"amerindios\", \"povos nativos\", \"povos ind\u00edgenas\", and, in Peru, \"Comunidades Nativas\" (Native Communities), particularly among Amazonian societies like the Urarina and Mats\u00e9s. In Chile, there the most populous indigenous peoples are the Mapuche in the Center-South and the Aymaras in the North. Rapa Nui of Easter Island, who are a Polynesian people, are the only non-Amerindian indigenous people in Chile.\nIndigenous peoples make up 0.4% of all Brazilian population, or about 700,000 people. Indigenous peoples are found in the entire territory of Brazil, although the majority of them live in Indian reservations in the North and Center-Western part of the country. On 18 January 2007, FUNAI reported that it had confirmed the presence of 67 different uncontacted peoples in Brazil, up from 40 in 2005. With this addition Brazil has now overtaken the island of New Guinea as the country having the largest number of uncontacted peoples.\nAsia.\nWest Asia.\nDue to changes in the demographic history of Palestine, there are competing claims that Jews and Palestinian Arabs are indigenous to the region. The argument entered the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict, with Jews claiming indigeneity, citing historical and religious connections to the land as their ancient homeland. Palestinians claim Indigenous status as a pre-existing population displaced by Jewish settlement, and currently constituting a minority in the State of Israel. In 2007, the Negev Bedouin were officially recognized as Indigenous peoples of Israel by the United Nations. This has been criticized both by scholars associated with the Israeli state, who dispute the Bedouin's claim to indigeneity, and those who argue that recognizing just one group of Palestinians as indigenous risks undermining others' claims and \"fetishizing\" nomadic cultures.\nSouth Asia.\nIndia's Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the Indian Ocean are also home to several Indigenous groups such as the Andamanese of Strait Island, the Jarawas of Middle Andaman and South Andaman Islands, the Onge of Little Andaman Island and the uncontacted Sentinelese of North Sentinel Island.\nIn Sri Lanka, the Indigenous Vedda people constitute a small minority of the population today.\nNortheast Asia.\nAinu people are an ethnic group indigenous to Hokkaido, the Kuril Islands, and much of Sakhalin. As Japanese settlement expanded, the Ainu were pushed northward and fought against the Japanese in Shakushain's Revolt and Menashi\u2013Kunashir Rebellion, until by the Meiji period they were confined by the government to a reservation near Lake Akan in Hokkaido. In a ground-breaking 1997 decision involving the Ainu people of Japan, the Japanese courts recognized their claim in law, stating that \"If one minority group lived in an area prior to being ruled over by a majority group and preserved its distinct ethnic culture even after being ruled over by the majority group, while another came to live in an area ruled over by a majority after consenting to the majority rule, it must be recognized that it is only natural that the distinct ethnic culture of the former group requires greater consideration.\"\nThe Dzungar Oirats are indigenous to the Dzungaria in Northern Xinjiang.\nThe Sarikoli Pamiris are indigenous to Tashkurgan in Xinjiang.\nThe Tibetans are indigenous to Tibet.\nThe Ryukyuan people are indigenous to the Ryukyu Islands.\nThe languages of Taiwanese aborigines have significance in historical linguistics, since in all likelihood Taiwan was the place of origin of the entire Austronesian language family, which spread across Oceania.\nIn Hong Kong, the indigenous inhabitants of the New Territories are defined in the Sino-British Joint Declaration as people descended through the male line from a person who was in 1898, before Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory. There are several different groups that make up the indigenous inhabitants, the Punti, Hakka, Hoklo, and Tanka. All are nonetheless considered part of the Cantonese majority, although some like the Tanka have been shown to have genetic and anthropological roots in the Baiyue people, the pre-Han Chinese inhabitants of Southern China.\nThe Russians invaded Siberia and conquered the indigenous people in the 17th\u201318th centuries.\nNivkh people are an ethnic group indigenous to Sakhalin, having a few speakers of the Nivkh language, but their fisher culture has been endangered due to the development of oil field of Sakhalin from 1990s.\nIn Russia, definition of \"Indigenous peoples\" is contested largely referring to a number of population (less than 50,000 people), and neglecting self-identification, origin from indigenous populations who inhabited the country or region upon invasion, colonization or establishment of state frontiers, distinctive social, economic and cultural institutions. Thus, indigenous peoples of Russia such as Sakha, Komi, Karelian and others are not considered as such due to the size of the population (more than 50,000 people), and consequently they \"are not the subjects of the specific legal protections.\" The Russian government recognizes only 40 ethnic groups as indigenous peoples, even though there are 30 other groups to be counted as such. The reason of nonrecognition is the size of the population and relatively late advent to their current regions, thus indigenous peoples in Russia should be numbered less than 50,000 people.\nSoutheast Asia.\nThe Malay Singaporeans are the Indigenous people of Singapore, inhabiting it since the Austronesian migration. They had established the Kingdom of Singapura back in the 13th century. The name \"Singapore\" is an anglicisation of the Malay name \"Singapura\" which is derived from the Sanskrit word for 'lion city'. The native Malay name for the main island of Singapore is \"Pulau Ujong\".\nDayak People are one of the Indigenous groups of Borneo. It is a loose term for over 200 riverine and hill-dwelling ethnic groups, located in Borneo, each with its own dialect, customs, laws, territory, and culture, although common distinguishing traits are readily identifiable.\nThe Cham are the Indigenous people of the former state of Champa which was conquered by Vietnam in the Cham\u2013Vietnamese wars during Nam ti\u1ebfn. The Cham in Vietnam are only recognized as a minority, and not as an Indigenous people by the Vietnamese government despite being indigenous to the region.\nThe Degar (Montagnards) are indigenous to Central Highlands (Vietnam) and were conquered by the Vietnamese in the Nam ti\u1ebfn.\nThe Khmer Krom are the Indigenous people of the Mekong Delta and Saigon which were acquired by Vietnam from Cambodian King Chey Chettha II in exchange for a Vietnamese princess.\nIn Indonesia, there are 50 to 70\u00a0million people who are classified as Indigenous peoples by the local Indigenous rights advocacy group \"Aliansi Masyarakat Adat Nusantara\". However, the Indonesian government does not recognize the existence of indigenous peoples, classifying every Native Indonesian ethnic group as \"indigenous\" despite the clear cultural distinctions of certain groups. This problem is shared by many other countries in the ASEAN region.\nIn the Philippines, there are 135 ethno-linguistic groups, 110 of which are considered as Indigenous peoples by the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples. The Indigenous people of Cordillera Administrative Region and Cagayan Valley in the Philippines are the Igorot people. The Indigenous peoples of Mindanao are the Lumad peoples and the Moro (Tausug, Maguindanao Maranao and others) who also live in the Sulu archipelago. There are also others sets of Indigenous peoples in Palawan, Mindoro, Visayas, and the rest central and south Luzon. The country has one of the largest Indigenous peoples population in the world. The recognition of the rights of Indigenous peoples was legally enshrined in 1997 with the Indigenous Peoples' Rights Act.\nIn Myanmar, indigenous peoples include the Shan, the Karen, the Rakhine, the Karenni, the Chin, the Kachin and the Mon. However, there are more ethnic groups that are considered indigenous, for example, the Akha, the Lisu, the Lahu or the Mru, among others.\nEurope.\nVarious ethnic groups have lived in Europe for millennia. However, the concept of Indigenous peoples is rarely used in the European context.\nIndigenous minority populations in Europe include the S\u00e1mi peoples of northern Norway, Sweden, and Finland and northwestern Russia (in an area also referred to as S\u00e1pmi); the Nenets of northern Russia, the Basques of Spain and France, the Inuit of Greenland, and the Irish travelers (also referred to as Pavees or Minc\u00e9rs) of Ireland. Some sources describe the S\u00e1mi as the only recognized Indigenous peoples in Europe, with others describing them as the only Indigenous people in the European Union.\nOther groups, particularly in Central, Western and Southern Europe, that might be considered to fit the description of Indigenous peoples in the Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989, such as the Sorbs, are generally categorized as national minorities instead.\nOceania.\nAustralia.\nIn Australia, the Indigenous populations are the Aboriginal Australian peoples (comprising many different nations and language groups) and the Torres Strait Islander peoples (also with sub-groups). These two groups are often referred to as Indigenous Australians, although terms such as First Nations and First Peoples are also used.\nPacific Islands.\nPolynesian, Melanesian and Micronesian peoples originally populated many of the present-day Pacific Island countries in the Oceania region over the course of thousands of years. European, American, Chilean and Japanese colonial expansion in the Pacific brought many of these areas under non-Indigenous administration, mainly during the 19th century. During the 20th century, several of these former colonies gained independence and nation-states formed under local control. However, various peoples have put forward claims for Indigenous recognition where their islands are still under external administration; examples include the Chamorros of Guam and the Northern Marianas, and the Marshallese of the Marshall Islands. Some islands remain under administration from Paris, Washington, London or Wellington.\nThe remains of at least 25 miniature humans, who lived between 1,000 and 3,000 years ago, were recently found on the islands of Palau in Micronesia.\nIn most parts of Oceania, Indigenous peoples outnumber the descendants of colonists. Exceptions include Australia, New Zealand and Hawaii. In New Zealand, based on various factors including census data and self-identification, the proportion of full or part M\u0101ori of the population on 30 June 2021 was estimated to be 17%. M\u0101ori developed from Polynesian people who settled in New Zealand after migrations from other Pacific islands, probably in the 13th century. Many leaders of M\u0101ori nations (iwi) signed a written agreement with the British Crown in 1840, known as the Treaty of Waitangi.\nA majority of the Papua New Guinea population is Indigenous, with more than 700 different nationalities recognized in a total population of 8\u00a0million. The country's constitution and key statutes identify traditional or custom-based practices and land tenure, and explicitly set out to promote the viability of these traditional societies within the modern state. However, conflicts and disputes concerning land use and resource rights continue between indigenous groups, the government, and corporate entities.\nIndigenous rights and other issues.\nThe 1989 ILO Convention on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples mainly concerns non-discrimination but also covers indigenous peoples' rights to development, customary laws, lands, territories and resources, employment, education and health. By 2013, the convention had been ratified by 22 countries, mainly in Latin America.\nIn 2007, the United Nations (UN) adopted a Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) specifying the collective rights of Indigenous peoples, including their rights to self-determination and to protect their cultures, identities, languages, ceremonies, and access to employment, health, education and natural resources. The declaration is not a formally binding treaty but some provisions might be considered customary international law. The declaration has been endorsed by at least 148 states but its provisions have not been consistently implemented.\nIndigenous peoples confront a diverse range of concerns associated with their status and interaction with other cultural groups, as well as changes in their inhabited environment. Some challenges are specific to particular groups; however, other challenges are commonly experienced.\nWherever Indigenous cultural identity is asserted, common societal issues and concerns arise. These concerns are often not unique to Indigenous groups. Despite the diversity of Indigenous peoples, they share common problems and issues in dealing with the prevailing, or invading, society. They are generally concerned that the cultures and lands of Indigenous peoples are being lost and that Indigenous peoples suffer both discrimination and pressure to assimilate into the surrounding or colonizing societies. This is borne out by the fact that the lands and cultures of nearly all of the peoples listed at the end of this article are under threat. Notable exceptions are the Sakha and Komi peoples (two northern Indigenous peoples of Russia), who now control their own autonomous republics within the Russian state, and the Canadian Inuit, who form a majority of the territory of Nunavut (created in 1999). Despite the control of their territories, many Sakha people have lost their lands as a result of the Russian Homestead Act, which allows any Russian citizen to own any land in the Far Eastern region of Russia.\nIn Australia, a landmark case, \"Mabo\" v \"Queensland\" (No 2), saw the High Court of Australia reject the idea of . This rejection ended up recognizing that there was a pre-existing system of law practiced by the Meriam people.\nA 2009 United Nations publication says:Although indigenous peoples are often portrayed as a hindrance to development, their cultures and traditional knowledge are also increasingly seen as assets. It is argued that it is important for the human species as a whole to preserve as wide a range of cultural diversity as possible, and that the protection of indigenous cultures is vital to this enterprise.\nHuman rights violations.\nAccording to Samuel Totten, some governments do not respect the rights of Indigenous peoples. In the latter part of the twentieth century the genocide of Indigenous peoples in Australia and Namibia attracted more attention from the international community including scholars and human rights organizations.\nThe Bangladeshi government has stated that there are \"no indigenous peoples in Bangladesh\". This statement has angered the Indigenous peoples of Chittagong Hill Tracts, Bangladesh, collectively known as the Jumma. Experts have protested against this move of the Bangladesh government and have questioned the government's definition of the term \"indigenous peoples\". This move by the Bangladesh government is seen by the Indigenous peoples of Bangladesh as another step by the Government to further erode their already limited rights.\nHindu Chams and Muslim Chams have both experienced religious and ethnic persecution and restrictions on their faith under the current Vietnamese government, with the Vietnamese state confiscating Cham property and forbidding Cham from observing their religious beliefs. Hindu temples were turned into tourist sites against the wishes of the Cham Hindus. In 2010 and 2013 several incidents occurred in Th\u00e0nh T\u00edn and Ph\u01b0\u01a1c Nh\u01a1n villages where Cham were murdered by Vietnamese. In 2012, Vietnamese police in Chau Giang village stormed into a Cham Mosque, stole the electric generator, and also raped Cham girls. Cham in the Mekong Delta have also been economically marginalized, with ethnic Vietnamese settling on land previously owned by Cham people with state support.\nThe Indonesian government has outright denied the existence of Indigenous peoples within the countries' borders. In 2012, Indonesia stated that 'The Government of Indonesia supports the promotion and protection of indigenous people worldwide\u00a0... Indonesia, however, does not recognize the application of the indigenous peoples concept\u00a0... in the country'. Along with the brutal treatment of the country's Papuan people (a conservative estimate places the violent deaths at 100,000 people in West New Guinea since Indonesian occupation in 1963, see Papua conflict) has led to Survival International condemning Indonesia for treating its Indigenous peoples as the worst in the world.\nThe Vietnamese viewed and dealt with the Indigenous Montagnards from the Central Highlands of Vietnam as \"savages\", which caused a Montagnard uprising against the Vietnamese. The Vietnamese were originally centered around the Red River Delta but engaged in conquest and seized new lands such as Champa, the Mekong Delta (from Cambodia) and the Central Highlands during Nam Tien. While the Vietnamese received strong Chinese influence in their culture and civilization and were Sinicized, and the Cambodians and Laotians were Indianized, the Montagnards in the Central Highlands maintained their own Indigenous culture without adopting external culture and were the true Indigenous of the region. To hinder encroachment on the Central Highlands by Vietnamese nationalists, the term \"Pays Montagnard du Sud-Indochinois\" (PMSI) emerged for the Central Highlands along with the indigenous being addressed by the name Montagnard. The tremendous scale of Vietnamese Kinh colonists flooding into the Central Highlands has significantly altered the demographics of the region. The anti-ethnic minority discriminatory policies by the Vietnamese, environmental degradation, deprivation of lands from the Indigenous people, and settlement of Indigenous lands by an overwhelming number of Vietnamese settlers led to massive protests and demonstrations by the Central Highland's indigenous ethnic minorities against the Vietnamese in January\u2013February 2001. This event gave a tremendous blow to the claim often published by the Vietnamese government that in Vietnam \"There has been no ethnic confrontation, no religious war, no ethnic conflict. And no elimination of one culture by another.\"\nIn May 2016, the Fifteenth Session of the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII) affirmed that Indigenous peoples are distinctive groups protected in international or national legislation as having a set of specific rights based on their linguistic and historical ties to a particular territory, prior to later settlement, development or occupation of a region. The session affirms that, since Indigenous peoples are vulnerable to exploitation, marginalization, oppression, forced assimilation, and genocide by nation states formed from colonizing populations or by different, politically dominant ethnic groups, individuals and communities maintaining ways of life indigenous to their regions are entitled to special protection.\nThe Indigenous people from Tanzania's Maasai community were reportedly subjected to eviction from their ancestral land to make way for a luxury game reserve by Otterlo Business Corporation in June 2022. The game reserve was reportedly being set up for the royals of the United Arab Emirates also linked to OBC or the Otterlo Business Corporation. According to lawyers and human rights groups and activists, approximately 30 Maasai people were injured by security forces in the process of eviction and delimiting a land area of . A 2019 UN report has described OBC as a 'UAE-based' luxury-game hunting company, granted a license to hunt by the Tanzanian government in 1992 for \"the UAE royal family to organize private hunting trips\", denying the Maasai people access to their own land.\nHealth issues.\nIn December 1993, the United Nations General Assembly proclaimed the International Decade of the World's Indigenous People, and requested UN specialized agencies to consider with governments and indigenous people how they can contribute to the success of the Decade of Indigenous People, commencing in December 1994. As a consequence, the World Health Organization (WHO), at its Forty-seventh World Health Assembly, established a core advisory group of Indigenous representatives with special knowledge of the health needs and resources of their communities, thus beginning a long-term commitment to the issue of the health of Indigenous peoples.\nThe WHO noted in 2003 that \"Statistical data on the health status of indigenous peoples is scarce. This is especially notable for indigenous peoples in Africa, Asia and eastern Europe\", but snapshots from various countries (where such statistics are available) show that indigenous people are in worse health than the general population, in advanced and developing countries alike: higher incidence of diabetes in some regions of Australia; higher prevalence of poor sanitation and lack of safe water among Twa households in Rwanda; a greater prevalence of childbirths without prenatal care among ethnic minorities in Vietnam; suicide rates among Inuit youth in Canada are eleven times higher than the national average; infant mortality rates are higher for Indigenous peoples everywhere.\nThe first UN publication on the State of the World's Indigenous Peoples revealed alarming statistics about indigenous peoples' health. Health disparities between indigenous and non-indigenous populations are evident in both developed and developing countries. Native Americans in the United States are 600 times more likely to acquire tuberculosis and 62% more likely to commit suicide than the non-Indian population. Tuberculosis, obesity, and type 2 diabetes are major health concerns for the indigenous in developed countries. Globally, health disparities touch upon nearly every health issue, including HIV/AIDS, cancer, malaria, cardiovascular disease, malnutrition, parasitic infections, and respiratory diseases, affecting indigenous peoples at much higher rates. Many causes of Indigenous children's mortality could be prevented. Poorer health conditions amongst indigenous peoples result from longstanding societal issues, such as extreme poverty and racism, but also the intentional marginalization and dispossession of Indigenous peoples by dominant, non-Indigenous populations and societal structures.\nRacism and discrimination.\nIndigenous peoples have frequently been subjected to various forms of racism and discrimination. Indigenous peoples have been denoted as being \"barbaric\", \"primitive\", \"savage\" or \"uncivilized\". These terms were commonly used during the heyday of European colonial expansion, and they are still being used by certain societies in modern times.\nDuring the 17th century, Europeans commonly labeled Indigenous peoples \"uncivilized\". Some philosophers, such as Thomas Hobbes (1588\u20131679), considered Indigenous people mere \"savages\". Others (especially literary figures in the 18th century) popularized the concept of \"noble savages\". Those who were close to the Hobbesian view tended to believe that they had a duty to \"civilize\" and \"modernize\" the Indigenous.\nSurvival International runs a campaign to stamp out media portrayals of Indigenous peoples as \"primitives\" or \"savages\".\nAfter World War I (1914\u20131918), many Europeans came to doubt the morality of the means which were used to \"civilize\" peoples. At the same time, the anti-colonial movement, and advocates for the rights of Indigenous peoples, argued that words such as \"civilized\" and \"savage\" were products and tools of colonialism, and they also argued that colonialism itself was savagely destructive. In the mid-20th century, European attitudes began to shift to the view that Indigenous and tribal peoples are the only peoples who should have the right to decide what should happen to their ancient cultures and their ancestral lands.\nCultural appropriation.\nNew Age and Neopagan adherents often look to the cultures of Indigenous peoples seeking to find ancient traditional truths and spiritual practices to appropriate into their lifestyles and worldviews.\nEnvironmental injustice.\n At an international level, Indigenous peoples have received increased recognition of their environmental rights since 2002, but few countries respect these rights in reality. The UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, adopted by the General Assembly in 2007, established Indigenous peoples' right to self-determination, stating rights to manage natural resources, and cultural and intellectual property. In countries where these rights are recognized, land titling and demarcation procedures are often put on delay, or leased out by the state as concessions for extractive industries without consulting Indigenous communities.\nMany in the United States federal government are in favor of exploiting oil reserves in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, where the Gwich'in Indigenous people rely on herds of caribou. Oil drilling could destroy thousands of years of culture for the Gwich'in. On the other hand, some of the Inupiat people, from another Indigenous community in the region, favor oil drilling because they could benefit economically.\nThe introduction of industrial agricultural technologies such as fertilizers, pesticides, and large plantation schemes have destroyed ecosystems that Indigenous communities formerly depended on, forcing resettlement. Development projects such as dam construction, pipelines and resource extraction have displaced large numbers of Indigenous peoples, often without providing compensation. Governments have forced Indigenous peoples off of their ancestral lands in the name of ecotourism and national park development. Indigenous women are especially affected by land dispossession because they must walk longer distances for water and fuel wood. These women also become economically dependent on men when they lose their livelihoods. Indigenous groups asserting their rights has most often resulted in torture, imprisonment, or death.\nThe building of dams can hurt Indigenous peoples by hurting the ecosystems that provide them water, food. For example, the Munduruku people in the Amazon rainforest are opposing the building of Tapaj\u00f3s dam with the help of Greenpeace.\nMost Indigenous populations are already subject to the deleterious effects of climate change. Climate change has not only environmental, but also human rights and socioeconomic implications for Indigenous communities. The World Bank acknowledges climate change as an obstacle to Millennium Development Goals, notably the fight against poverty, disease, and child mortality, in addition to environmental sustainability.\nUse of indigenous knowledge.\nIndigenous knowledge is considered as very important for issues linked with sustainability. Indigenous peoples play an essential role in conserving biodiversity around the world. An oft-cited statistic is that Indigenous peoples steward lands which comprise 80% of the world's biodiversity. In 2024, Fern\u00e1ndez-Llamazares et al. investigated the origin of this claim in \"Nature\" and found that it is without basis, also stating that \"biodiversity\" is broad and not precisely definable, and that the claim may do more harm than good. With a specific description, such as \"natural lands\" (that being lands with low levels of ecological disturbance), it can be said that at least 37% of remaining natural lands fall within the territories of Indigenous peoples. Fern\u00e1ndez-Llamazares et al. state that the 80% claim \"could undermine these and other rigorous studies \u2014 as well as effective efforts to conserve biodiversity by Indigenous Peoples on the ground\".\nThe Western and Eastern Penan people are two major groups of Indigenous populations in Malaysia. The Eastern Penan are famous for their resistance to loggers threatening their natural resources, specifically Sago palms and various fruit bearing trees. Because of the Penan's international fame, environmentalists often visited the area to document such happenings and learn more about and from the people there, including their perspective on the land's invasion.\nEnvironmentalists such as Davis and Henley, who Brosius writes lumped all native groups of Malaysia into one homogeneous group with the same ideas and traditions, and lacked dialectical connections needed to deeply understand the Penan, lacked full knowledge of the situation's specific weight to the Indigenous peoples. The two embarked on a mission, stating they wished to help with conservation of the Penan's land resources, but Brosious states they were among the many who repackaged traditional knowledge into something that fit a Western narrative and agenda, and that Davis and Henley romanticized and misconstrued the traditional Penan concept of molong (meaning: \"to preserve\"\u00a0\u2013 the Penan marked trees for personal use and to preserve them for future harvesting of fruits or for materials).\nAnother common occurrence is to extend Indigenous knowledge beyond its limits and into unrelated meanings that western consumers find spiritually profound. This tendency of journalists extends beyond Davis and Henley. It serves non-Natives to add a narrative and value beyond that which already exists within the knowledge base of Indigenous peoples. Not only do these fictionalized accounts of some Indigenous knowledge and traditions skew the beliefs of onlookers, but they also contribute to cultural genocide as the actual spiritual and religious beliefs of the Indigenous people are disappeared and replaced with the westernized fiction.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "45286", "revid": "9203640", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45286", "title": "Bonobo", "text": "Species of great ape\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Taxobox/core/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe bonobo (; Pan paniscus), also historically called the pygmy chimpanzee (less often the dwarf chimpanzee or gracile chimpanzee), is an endangered great ape and one of the two species making up the genus \"Pan\" (the other being the common chimpanzee, \"Pan troglodytes\"). While bonobos are today recognized as a distinct species, they were initially thought to be a subspecies of \"Pan troglodytes\", because of the physical similarities between the two species. Taxonomically, members of the chimpanzee/bonobo subtribe Panina\u2014composed entirely by the genus \"Pan\"\u2014are collectively termed \"panins\".\nBonobos are distinguished from common chimpanzees by relatively long limbs, pinker lips, a darker face, a tail-tuft through adulthood, and parted, longer hair on their heads. Some individuals have sparser, thin hair over parts of their bodies. The bonobo is found in a area within the Congo Basin of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Central Africa. It is predominantly frugivorous, compared to the often highly omnivorous diets and hunting of small monkeys, duiker and other antelope exhibited by common chimpanzees. Bonobos inhabit primary and secondary forest, including seasonally inundated swamp forest. Because of political instability in the region, and the general timidity of bonobos, there has been relatively little field work done observing the species in its natural habitat.\nAlong with the common chimpanzee, the bonobo is the closest extant relative to humans. As the two species are not proficient swimmers, the natural formation of the Congo River (around 1.5\u20132 million years ago) possibly led to the isolation and speciation of the bonobo. Bonobos live south of the river, and thereby were separated from the ancestors of the common chimpanzee, which live north of the river. There are no concrete figures regarding population, but the estimate is between 29,500 and 50,000 individuals. The species is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List and is most threatened by habitat destruction, human population growth and movement (as well as ongoing civil unrest and political infighting), with commercial poaching being, by far, the most prominent threat. Bonobos typically live 40 years in captivity; their lifespan in the wild is unknown, but it is almost certainly much shorter.\nEtymology.\nFormerly the bonobo was known as the \"pygmy chimpanzee\", despite the bonobo having a similar body size to the common chimpanzee. The name \"pygmy\" was given by the German zoologist Ernst Schwarz in 1929, who classified the species on the basis of a previously mislabeled bonobo cranium, noting its diminutive size compared to chimpanzee skulls.\nThe name \"bonobo\" first appeared in 1954, when Austrian zoologist Eduard Paul Tratz and German biologist Heinz Heck proposed it as a new and separate generic term for pygmy chimpanzees. The name is thought to derive from a misspelling on a shipping crate from the town of Bolobo on the Congo River near the location from which the first bonobo specimens were collected in the 1920s.\nTaxonomy.\nThe bonobo was first recognised as a distinct taxon in 1928 by German anatomist Ernst Schwarz, based on a skull in the Tervuren Museum in Belgium which had previously been classified as a juvenile chimpanzee (\"Pan troglodytes\"). Schwarz published his findings in 1929, classifying the bonobo as a subspecies of chimpanzee, \"Pan satyrus paniscus\". In 1933, American anatomist Harold Coolidge elevated it to species status. Major behavioural differences between bonobos and chimpanzees were first discussed in detail by Tratz and Heck in the early 1950s. Unaware of any taxonomic distinction with the common chimpanzee, American psychologist and primatologist Robert Yerkes had already noticed an unexpected major behavioural difference in the 1920s.\nBonobos and chimpanzees are the two species which make up the genus \"Pan\", and are the closest living relatives to humans (\"Homo sapiens\").\nBonobos and common chimpanzees show remarkable evolutionary stasis in musculoskeletal anatomy since their split from humans 8\u00a0million years ago, with bonobos exhibiting no changes since diverging from common chimps ~2 million years ago, making them a better anatomical model for the last common ancestor of humans and chimps/bonobos.\nNonetheless, the exact timing of the \"Pan\"\u2013\"Homo\" last common ancestor is contentious, but DNA comparison suggests continual interbreeding between ancestral \"Pan\" and \"Homo\" groups, post-divergence, until about 4 million years ago. DNA evidence suggests the bonobo and common chimpanzee species diverged approximately 890,000\u2013860,000 years ago following separation of these two populations possibly because of acidification and the spread of savannas at this time. Currently, these two species are separated by the Congo River, which had existed well before the divergence date, though ancestral \"Pan\" may have dispersed across the river using corridors which no longer exist. The first \"Pan\" fossils were reported in 2005 from the Middle Pleistocene (after the bonobo\u2013chimpanzee split) of Kenya, alongside early \"Homo\" fossils.\nAccording to A. Zihlman, bonobo body proportions closely resemble those of \"Australopithecus\", leading evolutionary biologist Jeremy Griffith to suggest that bonobos may be a living example of our distant human ancestors. According to Australian anthropologists Gary Clark and Maciej Henneberg, human ancestors went through a bonobo-like phase featuring reduced aggression and associated anatomical changes, exemplified in \"Ardipithecus ramidus\".\nThe first official publication of the sequencing and assembly of the bonobo genome was released in June 2012. The genome of a female bonobo from Leipzig Zoo was deposited with the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank) under the EMBL accession number AJFE01000000 after a previous analysis by the National Human Genome Research Institute confirmed that the bonobo genome is about 0.4% divergent from the chimpanzee genome.\nGenetics and genomics.\nRelationships of bonobos to humans and other apes can be determined by comparing their genes or whole genomes. While the first bonobo genome was published in 2012, a high-quality reference genome became available only in 2021. The overall nucleotide divergence between chimpanzee and bonobo based on the latter is 0.421 \u00b1 0.086% for autosomes and 0.311 \u00b1 0.060% for the X chromosome. The reference genome predicts 22,366 full-length protein-coding genes and 9,066 noncoding genes, although cDNA sequencing confirmed only 20,478 protein-coding and 36,880 noncoding bonobo genes, similar to the number of genes annotated in the human genome. Overall, 206 and 1,576 protein-coding genes are part of gene families that contracted or expanded in the bonobo genome compared to the human genome, respectively, that is, these genes were lost or gained in the bonobo genome compared to humans.\nHybrids.\nResearchers have found that both central (\"Pan troglodytes troglodytes\") and eastern chimpanzees (\"Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii\") share more genetic material with bonobos than other chimpanzee subspecies. It is believed that genetic admixture has occurred at least two times within the past 550,000 years. In modern times hybridization between bonobos and chimpanzees in the wild is prevented as populations are allopatric and kept isolated on different sides of the Congo river.\nWithin captivity, hybrids between bonobos and chimpanzees have been recorded. Between 1990 and 1992, five pregnancies were conceived and studied between a male bonobo and two female chimpanzees. The two initial pregnancies were aborted because of environmental stressors. The following three pregnancies however led to the birth of three hybrid offspring.\nA bonobo and chimpanzee hybrid called Tiby was also featured in the 2017 Swedish film \"The Square\". This same male bonobo and female chimpanzee had several offspring.\nDescription.\nThe bonobo is commonly considered to be more gracile than the common chimpanzee. Although large male chimpanzees can exceed any bonobo in bulk and weight, the two species broadly overlap in body size. Adult female bonobos are somewhat smaller than adult males. Body mass ranges from with an average weight of in males against an average of in females. The total length of bonobos (from the nose to the rump while on all fours) is . Male bonobos average when standing upright, compared to in females. The bonobo's head is relatively smaller than that of the common chimpanzee with less prominent brow ridges above the eyes. It has a black face with pink lips, small ears, wide nostrils, and long hair on its head that forms a parting. Females have slightly more prominent breasts, in contrast to the flat breasts of other female apes, although not so prominent as those of humans. The bonobo also has a slim upper body, narrow shoulders, thin neck, and long legs when compared to the common chimpanzee.\nBonobos are both terrestrial and arboreal. Most ground locomotion is characterized by quadrupedal knuckle-walking. Bipedal walking has been recorded as less than 1% of terrestrial locomotion in the wild, a figure that decreased with habituation, while in captivity there is a wide variation. Bipedal walking in captivity, as a percentage of bipedal plus quadrupedal locomotion bouts, has been observed from 3.9% for spontaneous bouts to nearly 19% when abundant food is provided. These physical characteristics and its posture give the bonobo an appearance more closely resembling that of humans than the common chimpanzee does. The bonobo also has highly individuated facial features, as humans do, so that one individual may look significantly different from another, a characteristic adapted for visual facial recognition in social interaction.\nMultivariate analysis has shown bonobos are more neotenised than the common chimpanzee, taking into account such features as the proportionately long torso length of the bonobo. Other researchers challenged this conclusion.\nBehaviour.\nPrimatologist Frans de Waal states bonobos are capable of altruism, compassion, empathy, kindness, patience, and sensitivity, and described \"bonobo society\" as a \"gynecocracy\" (i.e. a matriarchy). Primatologists who have studied bonobos in the wild have documented a wide range of behaviours, including aggressive behaviour and more cyclic sexual behaviour similar to chimpanzees, even though bonobos show more sexual behaviour in a greater variety of relationships. An analysis of female bonding among wild bonobos by Takeshi Furuichi stresses female sexuality and shows how female bonobos spend much more time in oestrus than female chimpanzees.\nSome primatologists have argued that de Waal's data reflect only the behaviour of captive bonobos, suggesting that wild bonobos show levels of aggression closer to what is found among chimpanzees. De Waal has responded that the contrast in temperament between bonobos and chimpanzees observed in captivity is meaningful, because it controls for the influence of environment. The two species behave quite differently even if kept under identical conditions. A 2014 study also found bonobos to be less aggressive than chimpanzees, particularly eastern chimpanzees. The authors argued that the relative peacefulness of western chimpanzees and bonobos was primarily due to ecological factors. Bonobos warn each other of danger less efficiently than chimpanzees in the same situation.\nNonetheless, in April 2024, biologists reported that bonobos behave more aggressively than thought earlier.\nIn a study published in February 2025, scientists determined that bonobos could tell when humans did not know something. The findings advance researchers' proposal that like humans, chimpanzees and bonobos\u2014humans' closest evolutionary cousins\u2014may also possess theory of mind. \nSocial behaviour.\nBonobos are unusual among apes for their matriarchal social structure (extensive overlap between the male and female hierarchies leads some to refer to them as gender-balanced in their power structure). Bonobos do not have a defined territory and communities will travel over a wide range. Because of the nomadic nature of the females and evenly distributed food in their environment, males do not gain any obvious advantages by forming alliances with other males, or by defending a home range, as chimpanzees do. Female bonobos possess sharper canines than female chimpanzees, further fueling their status in the group. Although a male bonobo is dominant to a female in a dyadic interaction, depending on the community, socially-bonded females may be co-dominant with males or dominant over them, even to the extent that females can coerce reluctant males into mating with them.\nAt the top of the hierarchy is a coalition of high-ranking females and males typically headed by an old, experienced matriarch who acts as the decision-maker and leader of the group. Female bonobos typically earn their rank through experience, age, and ability to forge alliances with other females in their group, rather than physical intimidation, and top-ranking females will protect immigrant females from male harassment. While bonobos are often called matriarchal, and while every community is dominated by a female, some males will still obtain a high rank and act as coalitionary partners to the alpha female, often taking initiative in coordinating the group's movements. These males may outrank not only the other males in the group, but also many females. Certain males alert the group to any possible threats, protecting the group from predators such as pythons and leopards.\nAggressive encounters between males and females are rare, and males are tolerant of infants and juveniles. A male derives his status from the status of his mother. The mother\u2013son bond often stays strong and continues throughout life. While social hierarchies do exist, and although the son of a high ranking female may outrank a lower female, rank plays a less prominent role than in other primate societies. Relationships between different communities are often positive and affiliative, and bonobos are not a territorial species. Bonobos will also share food with others, even unrelated strangers. Bonobos exhibit paedomorphism (retaining infantile physical characteristics and behaviours), which greatly inhibits aggression and enables unfamiliar bonobos to freely mingle and cooperate with each other.\nMales engage in lengthy friendships with females and, in turn, female bonobos prefer to associate with and mate with males who are respectful and easygoing around them. Because female bonobos can use alliances to rebuff coercive and domineering males and select males at their own leisure, they show preference for males who are not aggressive towards them. Aging bonobos lose their playful streak and become noticeably more irritable in old age. Both sexes have a similar level of aggressiveness. Bonobos live in a male philopatric society where the females immigrate to new communities while males remain in their natal troop. However, it is not entirely unheard of for males to occasionally transfer into new groups. Additionally, females with powerful mothers may remain in their natal clan.\nAlliances between males are poorly developed in most bonobo communities, while females will form alliances with each other and alliances between males and females occur, including multisex hunting parties. There is a confirmed case of a grown male bonobo adopting his orphaned infant brother. A mother bonobo will also support her grown son in conflicts with other males and help him secure better ties with other females, enhancing her chance of gaining grandchildren from him. She will even take measures such as physical intervention to prevent other males from breeding with certain females she wants her son to mate with. Although mothers play a role in aiding their sons, and the hierarchy among males is largely reflected by their mother's social status, some motherless males will still successfully dominate some males who do have mothers.\nFemale bonobos have also been observed fostering infants from outside their established community. Bonobos are not known to kill each other, and are generally less violent than chimpanzees, yet aggression still manifests itself in this species. Although female bonobos dominate males and selectively mate with males who do not exhibit aggression toward them, competition between the males themselves is intense and high-ranking males secure more matings than low-ranking ones. Indeed, the size difference between males and females is more pronounced in bonobos than it is in chimpanzees, as male bonobos do not form alliances and therefore have little incentive to hold back when fighting for access to females. Male bonobos are known to attack each other and inflict serious injuries such as missing digits, damaged eyes and torn ears. Some of these injuries may also occur when a male threatens the high ranking females and is injured by them, as the larger male is swarmed and outnumbered by a female mob.\nBecause of the promiscuous mating behaviour of female bonobos, a male cannot be sure which offspring are his. As a result, the entirety of parental care in bonobos is assumed by the mothers. However, bonobos are not as promiscuous as chimpanzees and slightly polygamous tendencies occur, with high-ranking males enjoying greater reproductive success than low-ranking males. Unlike chimpanzees, where any male can coerce a female into mating with him, female bonobos enjoy greater sexual preferences and can rebuff undesirable males, an advantage of female-female bonding, and actively seek out higher-ranking males.\nBonobo party size tends to vary because the groups exhibit a fission\u2013fusion pattern. A community of approximately 100 will split into small groups during the day while looking for food, and then will come back together to sleep. They sleep in nests that they construct in trees. Female bonobos more often than not secure feeding privileges and feed before males do, and although they are rarely successful in one-on-one confrontations with males, a female bonobo with several allies supporting her has extremely high success in monopolizing food sources. Different communities favour different prey. In some communities females exclusively hunt and have a preference for rodents, in others both sexes hunt, and will target monkeys. In captive settings, females exhibit extreme food-based aggression towards males, and forge coalitions against them to monopolize specific food items, often going as far as to mutilate any males who fail to heed their warning. In wild settings, however, female bonobos will quietly ask males for food if they had gotten it first, instead of forcibly confiscating it, suggesting sex-based hierarchy roles are less rigid than in captive colonies. Female bonobos are known to lead hunts on duikers and successfully defend their bounty from marauding males in the wild. They are more tolerant of younger males pestering them yet exhibit heightened aggression towards older males.\nIn a study published in November 2023, scientists reported, for the first time, evidence that groups of primates, particularly bonobos, are capable of cooperating with each other. Researchers observed unprecedented cooperation between two distinct bonobo groups in the Congo's Kokolopori Bonobo Reserve, Ekalakala and Kokoalongo, challenging traditional notions of ape societies. Over two years of observation, researchers witnessed 95 encounters between the groups. Contrary to expectations, these interactions resembled those within a single group. During these encounters, the bonobos engaged in behaviours such as grooming, food sharing, and collective defense against threats like snakes. Notably, the two groups, while displaying cooperative tendencies, maintained distinct identities, and there was no evidence of interbreeding or a blending of cultures. The cooperation observed was not arbitrary but evolved through individual bonds formed by exchanging favors and gifts. Some bonobos even formed alliances to target a third individual, demonstrating a nuanced social dynamic within the groups.\nSociosexual behaviour.\nSexual activity generally plays a major role in bonobo society, being used as what some scientists perceive as a greeting, a means of forming social bonds, a means of conflict resolution, and postconflict reconciliation. Bonobos are the only non-human animal to have been observed engaging in tongue kissing. Bonobos and humans are the only primates to typically engage in face-to-face genital sex, although a pair of western gorillas has also been photographed in this position.\nBonobos do not form permanent monogamous sexual relationships with individual partners. They also do not seem to discriminate in their sexual behaviour by sex or age, with the possible exception of abstaining from sexual activity between mothers and their adult sons. When bonobos come upon a new food source or feeding ground, the increased excitement will usually lead to communal sexual activity, presumably decreasing tension and encouraging peaceful feeding.\nMore often than the males, female bonobos engage in mutual genital-rubbing behaviour, possibly to bond socially with each other, thus forming a female nucleus of bonobo society. The bonding among females enables them to dominate most of the males. Adolescent females often leave their native community to join another community. This migration mixes the bonobo gene pools, providing genetic diversity. Sexual bonding with other females establishes these new females as members of the group.\nBonobo clitorises are larger and more externalized than in most mammals; while the weight of a young adolescent female bonobo \"is maybe half\" that of a human teenager, she has a clitoris that is \"three times bigger than the human equivalent, and visible enough to waggle unmistakably as she walks\". In scientific literature, the female\u2013female behavior of bonobos pressing vulvas together is often referred to as genito-genital (GG) rubbing. This sexual activity happens within the immediate female bonobo community and sometimes outside of it. Ethologist Jonathan Balcombe stated that female bonobos rub their clitorises together rapidly for ten to twenty seconds, and this behaviour, \"which may be repeated in rapid succession, is usually accompanied by grinding, shrieking, and clitoral engorgement\"; he added that it is estimated that they engage in this practice \"about once every two hours\" on average. As bonobos occasionally copulate face-to-face, \"evolutionary biologist Marlene Zuk has suggested that the position of the clitoris in bonobos and some other primates has evolved to maximize stimulation during sexual intercourse\". The position of the clitoris may alternatively permit GG-rubbings, which has been hypothesized to function as a means for female bonobos to evaluate their intrasocial relationships.\nBonobo males engage in various forms of male\u2013male genital behavior. The most common form of male\u2013male mounting is similar to that of a heterosexual mounting: one of the males sits \"passively on his back [with] the other male thrusting on him\", with the penises rubbing together because of both males' erections. In another, rarer form of genital rubbing, two bonobo males hang from a tree limb face-to-face while penis fencing. This also may occur when two males rub their penises together while in face-to-face position. Another form of genital interaction (rump rubbing) often occurs to express reconciliation between two males after a conflict, when they stand back-to-back and rub their scrotal sacs together, but such behaviour also occurs outside agonistic contexts: Kitamura (1989) observed rump\u2013rump contacts between adult males following sexual solicitation behaviours similar to those between female bonobos prior to GG-rubbing. Takayoshi Kano observed similar practices among bonobos in the natural habitat. Tongue kissing, oral sex, and genital massaging have also been recorded among male bonobos.\nWild females give birth for the first time at 13 or 14 years of age. Bonobo reproductive rates are no higher than those of the common chimpanzee. However, female bonobo oestrus periods are longer. During oestrus, females undergo a swelling of the perineal tissue lasting 10 to 20 days. The gestation period is on average 240 days. Postpartum amenorrhea (absence of menstruation) lasts less than one year and a female may resume external signs of oestrus within a year of giving birth, though the female is probably not fertile at this point. Female bonobos carry and nurse their young for four years and give birth on average every 4.6 years. Compared to common chimpanzees, bonobo females resume the genital swelling cycle much sooner after giving birth, enabling them to rejoin the sexual activities of their society. Also, bonobo females which are sterile or too young to reproduce still engage in sexual activity. Mothers will help their sons get more matings from females in oestrus.\nAdult male bonobos have sex with infants, although without penetration. Adult females also have sex with infants, but less frequently. Infants are not passive participants. They quite often initiate contacts with both adult males and females, as well as with peers. They have also been shown to be sexually active even in the absence of any stimulation or learning from adults.\nInfanticide, while well documented in chimpanzees, is apparently absent in bonobo society. Although infanticide has not been directly observed, there have been documented cases of both female and male bonobos kidnapping infants, sometimes resulting in infants dying from dehydration. Although male bonobos have not yet been seen to practice infanticide, there is a documented incident in captivity involving a dominant female abducting an infant from a lower-ranking female, treating the infant roughly and denying it the chance to suckle. During the kidnapping, the infant's mother was clearly distressed and tried to retrieve her infant. Had the zookeepers not intervened, the infant almost certainly would have died from dehydration. This suggests female bonobos can have hostile rivalries with each other and a propensity to carry out infanticide.\nThe highly sexual nature of bonobo society and the fact that there is little competition over mates means that many males and females are mating with each other, in contrast to the one dominant male chimpanzee that fathers most of the offspring in a group. The strategy of bonobo females mating with many males may be a counterstrategy to infanticide because it confuses paternity. If male bonobos cannot distinguish their own offspring from others, the incentive for infanticide essentially disappears. This is a reproductive strategy that seems specific to bonobos; infanticide is observed in all other great apes except orangutans. Bonobos engage in sexual activity numerous times a day.\nIt is unknown how the bonobo avoids simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and its effects.\nPeacefulness.\nObservations in the wild indicate that the males among the related common chimpanzee communities are hostile to males from outside the community. Parties of males 'patrol' for the neighboring males that might be traveling alone, and attack those single males, often killing them. This does not appear to be the behaviour of bonobo males or females, which seem to prefer sexual contact over violent confrontation with outsiders.\nWhile bonobos are more peaceful than chimpanzees, it is not true that they are unaggressive. In the wild, among males, bonobos are more aggressive than chimpanzees, having higher rates of aggressive acts, about three times as much. Although, male chimpanzees are more likely to be aggressive to a lethal degree than male bonobos which are more likely to engage in more frequent, yet less intense squabbling. There is also more female to male aggression with bonobos than there is with chimpanzees. Female bonobos are also more aggressive than female chimpanzees, in general. Both bonobos and chimpanzees exhibit physical aggression more than 100 times as often as humans do.\nAlthough referred to as peaceful, bonobo aggression is not restricted to each other, and humans have also been attacked by bonobos, and suffered serious, albeit non-fatal, injuries. \nBonobos are far less violent than chimpanzees, though, as lethal aggression is essentially nonexistent among bonobos while being not infrequent among chimpanzees.\nIt has been hypothesized that bonobos are able to live a more peaceful lifestyle in part because of an abundance of nutritious vegetation in their natural habitat, allowing them to travel and forage in large parties.\nRecent studies show that there are significant brain differences between bonobos and chimpanzees. Bonobos have more grey matter volume in the right anterior insula, right dorsal amygdala, hypothalamus, and right dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, all of which are regions assumed to be vital for feeling empathy, sensing distress in others and feeling anxiety. They also have a thick connection between the amygdala, an important area that can spark aggression, and the ventral anterior cingulate cortex, which has been shown to help control impulses in humans. This thicker connection may make them better at regulating their emotional impulses and behavior.\nBonobo society is dominated by females, and severing the lifelong alliance between mothers and their male offspring may make them vulnerable to female aggression. De Waal has warned of the danger of romanticizing bonobos: \"All animals are competitive by nature and cooperative only under specific circumstances\" and that \"when first writing about their behaviour, I spoke of 'sex for peace' precisely because bonobos had plenty of conflicts. There would obviously be no need for peacemaking if they lived in perfect harmony.\"\nSurbeck and Hohmann showed in 2008 that bonobos sometimes do hunt monkey species. Five incidents were observed in a group of bonobos in Salonga National Park, which seemed to reflect deliberate cooperative hunting. On three occasions, the hunt was successful, and infant monkeys were captured and eaten.\nThere is one inferred intraspecies killing in the wild, and a confirmed lethal attack in captivity. In both cases, the attackers were female and the victims were male.\nDiet.\nThe bonobo is an omnivorous frugivore; 57% of its diet is fruit, but this is supplemented with leaves, honey, eggs, meat from small vertebrates such as anomalures, flying squirrels and duikers, and invertebrates. The truffle species \"Hysterangium bonobo\" is eaten by bonobos. In some instances, bonobos have been shown to consume lower-order primates. Some claim bonobos have also been known to practise cannibalism in captivity, a claim disputed by others. However, at least one confirmed report of cannibalism in the wild of a dead infant was described in 2008. A 2016 paper reported two more instances of infant cannibalism, although it was not confirmed if infanticide was involved.\nCognitive comparisons to chimpanzees.\nIn 2020, the first whole-genome comparison between chimpanzees and bonobos was published and showed genomic aspects that may underlie or have resulted from their divergence and behavioural differences, including selection for genes related to diet and hormones. A 2010 study found that \"female bonobos displayed a larger range of tool use behaviours than males, a pattern previously described for chimpanzees but not for other great apes\". This finding was affirmed by the results of another 2010 study which also found that \"bonobos were more skilled at solving tasks related to theory of mind or an understanding of social causality, while chimpanzees were more skilled at tasks requiring the use of tools and an understanding of physical causality\". Bonobos have been found to be more risk-averse compared to chimpanzees, preferring immediate rather than delayed rewards when it comes to foraging. Bonobos also have a weaker spatial memory compared to chimpanzees, with adult bonobos performing comparably to juvenile chimpanzees.\nSimilarity to humans.\nBonobos are capable of passing the mirror-recognition test for self-awareness, as are all great apes. They communicate primarily through vocal means, although the meanings of their vocalizations are not currently known. However, most humans do understand their facial expressions and some of their natural hand gestures, such as their invitation to play. The communication system of wild bonobos includes a characteristic that was earlier only known in humans: bonobos use the same call to mean different things in different situations, and the other bonobos have to take the context into account when determining the meaning.\nTwo bonobos at the Great Ape Trust, Kanzi and Panbanisha, were taught how to communicate using a keyboard labeled with lexigrams (geometric symbols) and they could respond to spoken sentences. Kanzi\u2019s vocabulary consisted of more than 500 English words, and he had comprehension of around 3,000 spoken English words.\nKanzi is also known for learning by observing people trying to teach his mother; Kanzi started doing the tasks that his mother was taught just by watching, some of which his mother had failed to learn. Some, such as philosopher and bioethicist Peter Singer, argue that these results qualify them for \"rights to survival and life\"\u2014rights which humans theoretically accord to all persons (See great ape personhood).\nIn the 1990s, Kanzi was taught to make and use simple stone tools. This resulted from a study undertaken by researchers Kathy Schick and Nicholas Toth, and later Gary Garufi. The researchers wanted to know if Kanzi possessed the cognitive and biomechanical abilities required to make and use stone tools. Though Kanzi was able to form flakes, he did not create them in the same way as humans, who hold the core in one hand and knap it with the other; Kanzi threw the cobble against a hard surface or against another cobble. This allowed him to produce a larger force to initiate a fracture as opposed to knapping it in his hands.\nAs in other great apes and humans, third party affiliation toward the victim\u2014the affinitive contact made toward the recipient of an aggression by a group member other than the aggressor\u2014is present in bonobos. A 2013 study found that both the affiliation spontaneously offered by a bystander to the victim and the affiliation requested by the victim (solicited affiliation) can reduce the probability of further aggression by group members on the victim (this fact supporting the \"Victim-Protection Hypothesis\"). Yet, only spontaneous affiliation reduced victim anxiety\u2014measured via self-scratching rates\u2014thus suggesting not only that non-solicited affiliation has a consolatory function but also that the spontaneous gesture\u2014more than the protection itself\u2014works in calming the distressed subject. The authors hypothesize that the victim may perceive the motivational autonomy of the bystander, who does not require an invitation to provide post-conflict affinitive contact. Moreover, spontaneous\u2014but not solicited\u2014third party affiliation was affected by the bond between consoler and victim (this supporting the \"Consolation Hypothesis\"). Importantly, spontaneous affiliation followed the empathic gradient described for humans, being mostly offered to kin, then friends, then acquaintances (these categories having been determined using affiliation rates between individuals). Hence, consolation in the bonobo may be an empathy-based phenomenon.\nInstances in which bonobos have expressed joy have been reported. One study analyzed and recorded sounds made by human infants and bonobos when they were tickled. Although the bonobos' laugh was at a higher frequency, the laugh was found to follow a spectrographic pattern similar to that of human babies.\nDistribution and habitat.\nBonobos are found only south of the Congo River and north of the Kasai River (a tributary of the Congo), in the humid forests of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Ernst Schwarz's 1927 paper \"\", announcing his discovery, has been read as an association between the Parisian Left Bank and the left bank of the Congo River; the bohemian culture in Paris, and an unconventional ape in the Congo.\nThe ranges of bonobos and chimpanzees are separated by the Congo River, with bonobos living to its south and chimpanzees to the north.\nEcological role.\nIn the Congo tropical rainforest, the very great majority of plants need animals to reproduce and disperse their seeds. Bonobos are the second largest frugivorous animals in this region, after elephants. It is estimated that during its life, each bonobo will ingest and disperse nine tons of seeds, from more than 91 species of lianas, grass, trees and shrubs. These seeds travel for about 24 hours in the bonobo digestive tract, which can transfer them over several kilometers (mean 1.3\u00a0km; max: 4.5\u00a0km), far from their parents, where they will be deposited intact in their feces. These dispersed seeds remain viable, germinating better and more quickly than unpassed seeds. For those seeds, diplochory with dung-beetles (Scarabaeidae) improves post-dispersal survival.\nCertain plants such as \"Dialium\" may even be dependent on bonobos to activate the germination of their seeds, characterized by tegumentary dormancy. The first parameters of the effectiveness of seed dispersal by bonobos are present. Behaviour of the bonobo could affect the population structure of plants whose seeds they disperse. The majority of these zoochorous plants cannot recruit without dispersal and the homogeneous spatial structure of the trees suggests a direct link with their dispersal agent. Few species could replace bonobos in terms of seed dispersal services, just as bonobos could not replace elephants. There is little functional redundancy between frugivorous mammals of the Congo, which face severe human hunting pressures and local extinction. The defaunation of the forests, leading to the empty forest syndrome, is critical in conservation biology. The disappearance of the bonobos, which disperse seeds of 40% of the tree species in these forests, or 11.6 million individual seeds during the life of each bonobo, would have consequences for the conservation of the Congo rainforest.\nConservation status.\nThe IUCN Red List classifies bonobos as an endangered species, with conservative population estimates ranging from 29,500 to 50,000 individuals. Major threats to bonobo populations include habitat loss and hunting for bushmeat, the latter activity having increased dramatically during the first and second Congo Wars in the Democratic Republic of Congo, due to the presence of heavily armed militias (even in remote, \"protected\" areas such as Salonga National Park). This is part of a more general trend of ape extinction.\nAs the bonobos' habitat is shared with many people, the ultimate success of conservation efforts still relies on local and community involvement. The issue of parks versus people is salient in the Cuvette Centrale, within the bonobos' range. There is strong local, and broad-based Congolese, resistance to establishing national parks, as indigenous communities have previously been driven from their forest homes by the forming of parks. In Salonga National Park (the only national park in bonobo habitat), there is no local involvement, and surveys undertaken since 2000 indicate the bonobo, the African forest elephant, the okapi, and other rare species have been devastated by poachers and the thriving bushmeat trade. In contrast, areas do exist where the bonobo and ecological biodiversity still thrive without any established park borders, because of the indigenous beliefs/taboos against killing bonobos and other animals.\nDuring the wars in the 1990s, researchers and international non-governmental organisations (NGOs) were driven out of the bonobo habitat. In 2002, the Bonobo Conservation Initiative initiated the Bonobo Peace Forest Project (supported by the Global Conservation Fund of Conservation International), in cooperation with national institutions, local NGOs, and local communities; the Peace Forest Project works with local communities to establish a linked constellation of community-based reserves managed by local and indigenous people. This model, implemented mainly through DRC organisations and local communities, has helped bring about agreements to protect over of the bonobo habitat. According to Amy Parish, the Bonobo Peace Forest \"is going to be a model for conservation in the 21st century\".\nThe port town of Basankusu is situated on the Lulonga River, at the confluence of the Lopori and Maringa Rivers, in the north of the country, making it well placed to receive and transport local goods to the cities of Mbandaka and Kinshasa. With Basankusu being the last port of substance before the wilderness of the Lopori Basin and the Lomako River\u2014the bonobo heartland\u2014conservation efforts for the bonobo use the town as a base.\nIn 1995, concern over declining numbers of bonobos in the wild led the Zoological Society of Milwaukee (ZSM), in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, with contributions from bonobo scientists around the world, to publish the Action Plan for \"Pan paniscus\": A Report on Free Ranging Populations and Proposals for their Preservation. The Action Plan compiles population data on bonobos from 20 years of research conducted at various sites throughout the bonobo's range. The plan identifies priority actions for bonobo conservation and serves as a reference for developing conservation programs for researchers, government officials, and donor agencies.\nActing on Action Plan recommendations, the ZSM developed the Bonobo and Congo Biodiversity Initiative. This program includes habitat and rain-forest preservation, training for Congolese nationals and conservation institutions, wildlife population assessment and monitoring, and education. The ZSM has conducted regional surveys within the range of the bonobo in conjunction with training Congolese researchers in survey methodology and biodiversity monitoring. The ZSM's initial goal was to survey Salonga National Park to determine the conservation status of the bonobo within the park and to provide financial and technical assistance to strengthen park protection. As the project has developed, the ZSM has become more involved in helping the Congolese living in bonobo habitat. They have built schools, hired teachers, provided some medicines, and started an agriculture project to help the Congolese learn to grow crops and depend less on hunting wild animals.\nWith grants from the United Nations, USAID, the U.S. Embassy, the World Wildlife Fund, and many other groups and individuals, the ZSM also has been working to:\nStarting in 2003, the U.S. government allocated $54 million to the Congo Basin Forest Partnership. This significant investment has triggered the involvement of international NGOs to establish bases in the region and work to develop bonobo conservation programs. This initiative should improve the likelihood of bonobo survival, but its success still may depend upon building greater involvement and capability in local and indigenous communities.\nThe bonobo population is believed to have declined sharply in the last 30 years, though surveys have been hard to carry out in war-ravaged central Congo. Estimates range from 60,000 to fewer than 50,000 living, according to the World Wildlife Fund.\nIn addition, concerned parties have addressed the crisis on several science and ecological websites. Organisations such as the World Wide Fund for Nature, the African Wildlife Foundation, and others, are trying to focus attention on the extreme risk to the species. Some have suggested that a reserve be established in a more stable part of Africa, or on an island in a place such as Indonesia. Awareness is ever increasing, and even nonscientific or ecological sites have created various groups to collect donations to help with the conservation of this species.\nIn human culture.\nWorld Bonobo Day is February 14 (Valentine's Day), established in 2017 by the African Wildlife Foundation.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It has been translated into a dozen languages and was the subject of a Harvard Business Review summary.\nContent.\nIn \"Natural Capitalism\" the authors describe the global economy as being dependent on natural resources and ecosystem services that nature provides. Natural Capitalism is a critique of traditional \"Industrial Capitalism\", saying that the traditional system of capitalism \"does not fully conform to its own accounting principles. It liquidates its capital and calls it income. It neglects to assign any value to the largest stocks of capital it employs \u2013 the natural resources and living systems, as well as the social and cultural systems that are the basis of human capital.\"\nNatural capitalism recognizes the critical interdependency between the production and use of human-made capital and the maintenance and supply of natural capital. The authors argue that only through recognizing this essential relationship with the Earth's valuable resources can businesses, and the people they support, continue to exist.\nTheir fundamental questions concern the theoretical properties of an economy that, among other tenets, organizes around a more realistic ideation of the principles of business and industry, and envisioning a world in which this is a reality is a key concern of the argument.\nThe authors of \"Natural Capitalism\" claim that these choices are possible and \"such an economy would offer a stunning new set of opportunities for all of society, amounting to no less than \"the next industrial revolution\".\"\nAccording to the authors, the \"next industrial revolution\" depends on the espousal of four central strategies: \"the conservation of resources through more effective manufacturing processes, the reuse of materials as found in natural systems, a change in values from quantity to quality, and investing in natural capital, or restoring and sustaining natural resources\".\nWhile traditional industrial capitalism primarily recognizes the value of money and goods as capital, \"Natural Capitalism\" extends recognition to natural capital and human capital. Problems such as pollution and social injustice may then be seen as failures to properly account for capital, rather than as inherent failures of capitalism itself.\nThe fundamental assumptions of \"Natural Capitalism\" are as follows:\nMeaning of book's title.\nIn a 2009 interview, Paul Hawken described his motivation behind the title \"Natural Capitalism\". He stated that it was intended to be a pun on \"natural capital\", a term originally coined by E. F. Schumacher in 1973. Hawken endorsed the underlying concept of \"natural capital\", and its implications for society, so added an \"-ism\" at the end of that word as a double entendre.\nDespite this intention from Hawken, many readers interpreted this wordplay in the opposite way. There was dissent from readers who misunderstood the title, believing that \"Capitalism\" was the operative word, and that the authors were therefore justifying or defending the concept of capitalism. Hawken later expressed regret at this confusion, and stated that while he endorses the spirit of commerce and entrepreneurship, he does not endorse the \"pathological\" qualities inherent in pure capitalism.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Both during his life and after his death, he became a popular medieval saint of Northern England, with a cult centred on his tomb at Durham Cathedral. Cuthbert is regarded as the patron saint of Northumbria. His feast days are 20 March (Catholic Church, Church of England, Eastern Orthodox Church, Episcopal Church) and 4 September (Church in Wales, Catholic Church).\nCuthbert grew up in or around Lauderdale, near Old Melrose Abbey, a daughter-house of Lindisfarne, today in Scotland. He decided to become a monk after seeing a vision on the night in 651 that Aidan, the founder of Lindisfarne, died, but he seems to have experienced some period of military service beforehand. He was made guest-master at the new monastery at Ripon, soon after 655, but had to return with Eata of Hexham to Melrose when Wilfrid was given the monastery instead. About 662 he was made prior at Melrose, and around 665 went as prior to Lindisfarne. In 684 he was made bishop of Lindisfarne, but by late 686 he resigned and returned to his hermitage as he felt he was about to die. He was probably in his early 50s.\nLife.\nOrigins and background.\nCuthbert was born (perhaps into a noble family) in Dunbar, then in Anglo-Saxon Northumbria, and now in East Lothian, Scotland, in the mid-630s, some ten years after the conversion of King Edwin of Northumbria to Christianity in 627, which was slowly followed by that of the rest of his people. The politics of the kingdom were violent, and there were later episodes of pagan rule, while spreading understanding of Christianity through the kingdom was a task that lasted throughout Cuthbert's lifetime. Edwin had been baptised by Paulinus of York, a Roman who had come with the Gregorian mission from Rome, but his successor Oswald also invited Irish monks from Iona to found the monastery at Lindisfarne where Cuthbert was to spend much of his life. This was around 635, about the time Cuthbert was born.\nThe tension between the Roman and Celtic Christianity, often exacerbated by Cuthbert's near-contemporary Wilfrid, an intransigent and quarrelsome supporter of Roman ways, was to be a major feature of Cuthbert's lifetime. Cuthbert himself, though educated in the Celtic tradition, followed his mentor Eata in accepting the Roman forms, apparently without difficulty, after the Synod of Whitby in 664. The earliest biographies concentrate on the many miracles that accompanied even his early life, but he was evidently indefatigable as a travelling priest spreading the Christian message to remote villages, and also well able to impress royalty and nobility. Unlike Wilfrid, his style of life was austere, and when he could, he lived the life of a hermit, though still receiving many visitors.\nIn Cuthbert's time the Kingdom of Northumbria included, in modern terms, northern England as well as parts of south-eastern Scotland as far north as the Firth of Forth. Cuthbert may have been from the neighbourhood of Dunbar at the mouth of the Firth of Forth in modern-day Scotland, though \"The Lives of the Fathers, Martyrs and Other Principal Saints\" (\"Butler's Lives\"), by Alban Butler records that he was fostered as a child near Melrose. Fostering is possibly a sign of noble birth, as are references to his riding a horse when young. One night while still a boy, employed as a shepherd, he had a vision of the soul of Aidan being carried to heaven by angels, and later found out that Aidan had died that night. Edwin Burton finds it a suggestion of lowly parentage that as a boy he used to tend sheep on the hills near that monastery. He appears to have undergone military service, but at some point he joined the very new monastery at Melrose, under the prior Boisil. Upon Boisil's death in 661, Cuthbert succeeded him as prior. Cuthbert was possibly a second cousin of King Aldfrith of Northumbria (according to Irish genealogies), which may explain his later proposal that Aldfrith should be crowned as monarch.\nCareer.\nCuthbert's fame for piety, diligence, and obedience grew. When Alchfrith, king of Deira, founded a new monastery at Ripon, Cuthbert became its \"praepositus hospitum\" or guest master under Eata. When Wilfrid was made abbot of the monastery, Eata and Cuthbert returned to Melrose. Illness struck the monastery in 664 and while Cuthbert recovered, the prior died and Cuthbert was made prior in his place. He spent much time among the people, ministering to their spiritual needs, carrying out missionary journeys, and preaching.\nAfter the Synod of Whitby, Cuthbert seems to have accepted the Roman customs, and his old abbot Eata called on him to introduce them at Lindisfarne as prior there. His asceticism was complemented by his charm and generosity to the poor, and his reputation for gifts of healing and insight led many people to consult him, gaining him the name of \"Wonder Worker of Britain\". He continued his missionary work, travelling the breadth of the country from Berwick to Galloway to carry out pastoral work and founding an oratory at Dull, Scotland, complete with a large stone cross, and a little cell for himself. He is also said to have founded St Cuthbert's Church in Edinburgh.\nHermit's life.\nCuthbert retired in 676, moved by the desire for a more contemplative life. With his abbot's leave, he moved to a spot which Archbishop Eyre identifies with St Cuthbert's Island near Lindisfarne, but which Raine thinks was near Holburn, at a place now known as St Cuthbert's Cave. Shortly afterwards, Cuthbert moved to Inner Farne island, two miles from Bamburgh, where he gave himself up to a life of great austerity. At first he received visitors, but later he confined himself to his cell and opened his window only to give his blessing. He could not refuse an interview with the holy abbess and royal virgin Elfleda, the daughter of Oswiu of Northumbria, who succeeded St Hilda as abbess of Whitby in 680. The meeting was held on Coquet Island, further south.\nElection as Bishop, Lindisfarne and death.\nIn 684, Cuthbert was elected Bishop of Hexham at a synod at Twyford (believed to be present-day Alnmouth), but was reluctant to leave his retirement and take up his charge; it was only after a visit from a large group, including King Ecgfrith, that he agreed to return and take up the duties of bishop, but instead as Bishop of Lindisfarne, swapping with Eata, who went to Hexham in Cuthbert's place. Cuthbert was consecrated at York by Archbishop Theodore and six bishops, on 26 March 685. But after Christmas 686, he returned to his cell on Inner Farne Island, where he died on 20 March 687, after a painful illness. He was buried at Lindisfarne the same day, and after long journeys escaping the Danes his remains chose, as was thought, to settle at Durham, causing the foundation of the city and Durham Cathedral. The St Cuthbert Gospel is among the objects later recovered from St Cuthbert's coffin, which is also an important artefact.\nLegacy.\nAfter Cuthbert's death, numerous miracles were attributed to his intercession and to intercessory prayer near his remains. In particular, Alfred the Great, King of Wessex, was inspired and encouraged in his struggle against the Danes by a vision or dream he had of Cuthbert. Thereafter, the royal house of Wessex, who became the kings of England, made a point of devotion to Cuthbert, which also gave a useful political message, as they came from opposite ends of the English nation. Cuthbert was \"a figure of reconciliation and a rallying point for the reformed identity of Northumbria and England\" after the absorption of the Danish populations into Anglo-Saxon society, as Michelle Brown puts it. The 8th-century historian Bede wrote both a verse and a prose life of St Cuthbert around 720. He has been described as \"perhaps the most popular saint in England prior to the death of Thomas Becket in 1170.\" In 698, Cuthbert was reburied at Lindisfarne in the decorated oak coffin now usually meant by St Cuthbert's coffin, though he was to have many more coffins. In 995, the \"community of Cuthbert\" founded and settled at Durham, guided by what they thought was the will of the saint, as the wagon carrying his coffin back to Chester-le-Street after a temporary flight from a Danish invasion became stuck hard on the road.\nDuring the medieval period, Cuthbert became important in defining the identity of the people living in Northumbria north of Tees. Symeon noted that it was the 'people of St Cuthbert', that is, 'the whole people between the river Tees and the river Tweed', who waged an unsuccessful campaign against the Scots at the Battle of Carham in 1018. By the later 11th century the Bishops of Durham had established a semi-autonomous region known as the Liberty of Durham, later the Palatinate of Durham, between the Tyne and Tees. Within this area the Bishop of Durham had almost as much power as the king of England himself, and the saint became a powerful symbol of the autonomy the region enjoyed. The inhabitants of the Palatinate became known as the \"haliwerfolc\", which roughly translates as \"people of the saint\", and Cuthbert gained a reputation as fiercely protective of his domain. For example, there is a story that at the Battle of Neville's Cross in 1346, the Prior of the Abbey at Durham received a vision of Cuthbert, ordering him to take the corporal cloth of the saint and raise it on a spear point near the battlefield as a banner. Doing this, the Prior and his monks found themselves protected \"by the mediation of holy St Cuthbert and the presence of the said holy Relic\". Whether the story of the vision is true or not, the banner of St Cuthbert was regularly carried in battle against the Scots until the Reformation, and it serves as a good example of how St Cuthbert was regarded as a protector of his people. A modern interpretation of the Banner, designed by Northumbria University academic Fiona Raeside-Elliott and embroidered by local textile artist Ruth O'Leary, is on display at the saint's shrine in Durham Cathedral.\nCuthbert's cult also appealed to the converted Danes, who made up much of the population of Kingdom of York, and was also adopted by the Normans when they took over England. Cuthbert's shrine at Durham Cathedral was a major pilgrimage site throughout the Middle Ages, until stripped by Henry VIII's commissioners in the Dissolution of the Monasteries.\nRelics.\nAccording to Bede's life of the saint, when Cuthbert's sarcophagus was opened eleven years after his death, his body was found to have been perfectly preserved or incorrupt. This apparent miracle led to the steady growth of Cuthbert's posthumous cultus, to the point where he became the most popular saint of Northern England. Numerous miracles were attributed to his intercession and to intercessory prayer near his remains.\nIn 875 the Danes took the monastery of Lindisfarne and the monks fled, carrying St Cuthbert's body with them around various places including Melrose. After seven years' wandering it found a resting place at the still existing St Cuthbert's church in Chester-le-Street until 995, when another Danish invasion led to its removal to Ripon. Then the saint intimated, as it was believed, that he wished to remain in Durham. A new stone church\u2014the so-called \"White Church\"\u2014was built, the predecessor of the present grand Cathedral. In 999, his relics were enshrined in the new church on 4 September, which is kept as the feast of his translation at Durham Cathedral and as an optional memorial in the Catholic Church in England.\nIn 1069 Bishop \u00c6thelwine attempted to transport Cuthbert's body to Lindisfarne to escape from King William at the start of the Harrying of the North.\nIn 1104 Cuthbert's tomb was opened again and his relics translated to a new shrine behind the altar of the recently completed Cathedral. When the casket was opened, a small book of the Gospel of John, measuring 138 by 92 millimetres (5.4 \u00d7 3.6 inches), now known as the Saint Cuthbert Gospel (British Library Additional MS 89000, formerly known as the Stonyhurst Gospel), was found. This is the oldest Western book to have retained its original bookbinding, in finely decorated leather. Also recovered much later were a set of vestments of 909\u2013916, made of Byzantine silk with a \"Nature Goddess\" pattern, with a stole and decoration in extremely rare Anglo-Saxon embroidery or \"opus anglicanum\", which had been deposited in his tomb by King \u00c6thelstan (r. 927\u2013939) on a pilgrimage while Cuthbert's shrine was at Chester-le-Street.\nCuthbert's shrine was destroyed in the Dissolution of the Monasteries, but, unusually, his relics survived and are still interred at the site, although they were also disinterred in the 19th century, when his wooden coffin and various relics were removed. St Cuthbert's coffin (actually one of a series of several coffins), as reconstructed by Ernst Kitzinger and others, remains at the cathedral and is an important rare survival of Anglo-Saxon carving on wood. When the coffin was last inspected on 17 May 1827, a 'Saxon' square cross of gold, embellished with garnets, in the characteristic splayed shape, used later as the heraldic emblem of St Cuthbert in the arms of Durham and Newcastle universities, was found.\nNamesakes.\nThe flag of County Durham since 2013 features the Cross of St Cuthbert, counterchanged in the county colours of blue and gold. The flag of Kirkcudbrightshire in Scotland since 2016 likewise features the Cross of St Cuthbert, whose name is the origin of the county's name. The Cross of St Cuthbert features as the principal charge on the coat of arms of the University of Durham, granted in 1843, blazoned \"Argent, a Cross of St Cuthbert Gules, on a canton Azure, a chevron Or, between three lions rampant of the first\" ('A red Cross of St Cuthbert on a silver shield, with three silver fighting lions around a gold chevron on a blue square in the top left-hand corner'). The Cross also features in the arms of many of its constituent colleges. The University of Newcastle upon Tyne, formerly King's College in the University of Durham, also features St Cuthbert's Cross on its arms, granted in 1937. The Newcastle University arms are blazoned \"Azure, a Cross of St Cuthbert Argent, and on a chief of the last a lion passant guardant Gules.\" ('A silver Cross of St Cuthbert on a blue shield, with a red lion walking and looking towards you on the silver top third portion of the shield.') The cross of St Cuthbert also features on the badges of the two Anglican secondary schools in Tyne and Wear, namely Dame Allan's Schools and Sunderland High School.\nSt Cuthbert's Society, a college of Durham University established in 1888, is named after him and is located only a short walk from the coffin of the saint at Durham Cathedral. The Society celebrates St Cuthbert's Day on or around each 20 March with a feast. \"Cuth's Day\", the annual college day, is celebrated in the Easter term with music, entertainment, festivities and drinking. Cuddy's Corse is a waymarked walking route between Chester-le-Street and Durham Cathedral; it marks the journey between two of the last resting places of the coffin.\nWorksop College, founded as St Cuthbert's in 1895, was the last of the Woodard Schools to be opened.\nSt Cuthbert is also the namesake of St Cuthbert's College in Epsom, New Zealand; St Cuthbert's Day on 21 March is a day of school celebration. The school's houses are named after important locations in the life of the saint: Dunblane (yellow), Elgin (green), Iona (purple), Kelso (blue), Lindisfarne (white), Melrose (red), York (orange) and Durham (pink).\nSt Cuthbert's High School, a Roman Catholic school in Newcastle upon Tyne, is named after the saint. St Cuthbert's Day is celebrated with Mass, and the school prayers include reference to their patron saint (always ending with the invocation \"St Cuthbert, pray for us\"). The school badge features a bishop's crook in reference to St Cuthbert's time as a bishop, as well as ducks, reflecting his love of the animals.\nAnother Roman Catholic secondary school to bear the name of St Cuthbert is St Cuthbert's RC High School in Rochdale. Founded in 1968 as Bishop Henshaw School it was renamed to its current name in the late 1980s. The school's badge includes the St Cuthbert Cross and the motto \"In Christ We Serve\".\nSt Cuthbert's Co-operative Society (now Scotmid) opened its first shop in Edinburgh in 1859, and expanded to become one of the largest co-ops in Scotland. Its dairy used horse-drawn delivery floats until 1985, and between 1944 and 1959 employed as a milkman Sean Connery, who later played James Bond.\nThe Roman Catholic Diocese of Hexham and Newcastle holds St Cuthbert as its patron saint, with the consecration of bishops in the diocese always taking place on 20 March, Cuthbert's feast day in the Catholic Church.\nMany churches are named after Cuthbert. An Orthodox Community in Chesterfield, England, has taken St Cuthbert as their patron.\nFossilised crinoid columnals extracted from limestone quarried on Lindisfarne, or found washed up along the foreshore, which were threaded into necklaces or rosaries, became known as St Cuthbert's beads.\nIn Northumberland, the common eider is known as Cuddy's duck, \"Cuddy\" being the familiar form of \"Cuthbert\". While on the Farne Islands, Cuthbert instituted special laws to protect the ducks and other seabirds nesting on the islands. They still breed in their thousands off the Northumberland coast.\nIn Cumbria, the civil parish and hamlet of Holme St Cuthbert are named after him, as is the parish church. It is a rural area, with one larger village and numerous smaller hamlets.\nSt Cuthbert's Way is a long-distance walking route, one of Scotland's Great Trails.\nCuthbert is remembered in the Church of England with a Lesser Festival on 20 March, or alternatively 4 September, including in the Roman Catholic Church in England.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Atmospheric entry may be \"uncontrolled entry,\" as in the entry of astronomical objects, space debris, or bolides. It may be \"controlled entry\" (or \"reentry\") of a spacecraft that can be navigated or follow a predetermined course. Methods for controlled atmospheric \"entry, descent, and landing\" of spacecraft are collectively termed as \"EDL\".\nObjects entering an atmosphere experience atmospheric drag, which puts mechanical stress on the object, and aerodynamic heating\u2014caused mostly by compression of the air in front of the object, but also by drag. These forces can cause loss of mass (ablation) or even complete disintegration of smaller objects, and objects with lower compressive strength can explode.\nObjects have reentered with speeds ranging from 7.8\u00a0km/s for low Earth orbit to around 12.5\u00a0km/s for the Stardust probe. They have high kinetic energies, and atmospheric dissipation is the only way of expending this, as it is highly impractical to use retrorockets for the entire reentry procedure. Crewed space vehicles must be slowed to subsonic speeds before parachutes or air brakes may be deployed. \nBallistic warheads and expendable vehicles do not require slowing at reentry, and in fact, are made streamlined so as to maintain their speed. Furthermore, slow-speed returns to Earth from near-space such as high-altitude parachute jumps from balloons do not require heat shielding because the gravitational acceleration of an object starting at relative rest from within the atmosphere itself (or not far above it) cannot create enough velocity to cause significant atmospheric heating.\nFor Earth, atmospheric entry occurs by convention at the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line at an altitude of above the surface, while at Venus atmospheric entry occurs at and at Mars atmospheric entry occurs at about . Uncontrolled objects reach high velocities while accelerating through space toward the Earth under the influence of Earth's gravity, and are slowed by friction upon encountering Earth's atmosphere. Meteors are also often travelling quite fast relative to the Earth simply because their own orbital path is different from that of the Earth before they encounter Earth's gravity well. Most objects enter at hypersonic speeds due to their sub-orbital (e.g., intercontinental ballistic missile reentry vehicles), orbital (e.g., the Soyuz), or unbounded (e.g., meteors) trajectories. Various advanced technologies have been developed to enable atmospheric reentry and flight at extreme velocities. An alternative method of controlled atmospheric entry is buoyancy which is suitable for planetary entry where thick atmospheres, strong gravity, or both factors complicate high-velocity hyperbolic entry, such as the atmospheres of Venus, Titan and the giant planets.\nHistory.\nThe concept of the ablative heat shield was described as early as 1920 by Robert Goddard: \"In the case of meteors, which enter the atmosphere with speeds as high as per second, the interior of the meteors remains cold, and the erosion is due, to a large extent, to chipping or cracking of the suddenly heated surface. For this reason, if the outer surface of the apparatus were to consist of layers of a very infusible hard substance with layers of a poor heat conductor between, the surface would not be eroded to any considerable extent, especially as the velocity of the apparatus would not be nearly so great as that of the average meteor.\"\nPractical development of reentry systems began as the range, and reentry velocity of ballistic missiles increased. For early short-range missiles, like the V-2, stabilization and aerodynamic stress were important issues (many V-2s broke apart during reentry), but heating was not a serious problem. Medium-range missiles like the Soviet R-5, with a range, required ceramic composite heat shielding on separable reentry vehicles (it was no longer possible for the entire rocket structure to survive reentry). The first ICBMs, with ranges of , were only possible with the development of modern ablative heat shields and blunt-shaped vehicles.\nIn the United States, this technology was pioneered by H. Julian Allen and A. J. Eggers Jr. of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) at Ames Research Center. In 1951, they made the counterintuitive discovery that a blunt shape (high drag) made the most effective heat shield. From simple engineering principles, Allen and Eggers showed that the heat load experienced by an entry vehicle was inversely proportional to the drag coefficient; i.e., the greater the drag, the less the heat load. If the reentry vehicle is made blunt, air cannot \"get out of the way\" quickly enough, and acts as an air cushion to push the shock wave and heated shock layer forward (away from the vehicle). Since most of the hot gases are no longer in direct contact with the vehicle, the heat energy would stay in the shocked gas and simply move around the vehicle to later dissipate into the atmosphere.\nThe Allen and Eggers discovery, though initially treated as a military secret, was eventually published in 1958.\nTerminology, definitions and jargon.\nWhen atmospheric entry is part of a spacecraft landing or recovery, particularly on a planetary body other than Earth, entry is part of a phase referred to as \"entry, descent, and landing\", or EDL. When the atmospheric entry returns to the same body that the vehicle had launched from, the event is referred to as reentry (almost always referring to Earth entry).\nThe fundamental design objective in atmospheric entry of a spacecraft is to dissipate the energy of a spacecraft that is traveling at hypersonic speed as it enters an atmosphere such that equipment, cargo, and any passengers are slowed and land near a specific destination on the surface at zero velocity while keeping stresses on the spacecraft and any passengers within acceptable limits. This may be accomplished by propulsive or aerodynamic (vehicle characteristics or parachute) means, or by some combination.\nEntry vehicle shapes.\nThere are several basic shapes used in designing entry vehicles:\nSphere or spherical section.\nThe simplest axisymmetric shape is the sphere or spherical section. This can either be a complete sphere or a spherical section forebody with a converging conical afterbody. The aerodynamics of a sphere or spherical section are easy to model analytically using Newtonian impact theory. Likewise, the spherical section's heat flux can be accurately modeled with the Fay\u2013Riddell equation. The static stability of a spherical section is assured if the vehicle's center of mass is upstream from the center of curvature (dynamic stability is more problematic). Pure spheres have no lift. However, by flying at an angle of attack, a spherical section has modest aerodynamic lift thus providing some cross-range capability and widening its entry corridor. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, high-speed computers were not yet available and computational fluid dynamics was still embryonic. Because the spherical section was amenable to closed-form analysis, that geometry became the default for conservative design. Consequently, crewed capsules of that era were based upon the spherical section.\nPure spherical entry vehicles were used in the early Soviet Vostok and Voskhod capsules and in Soviet Mars and Venera descent vehicles. The Apollo command module used a spherical section forebody heat shield with a converging conical afterbody. It flew a lifting entry with a hypersonic trim angle of attack of \u221227\u00b0 (0\u00b0 is blunt-end first) to yield an average L/D (lift-to-drag ratio) of 0.368. The resultant lift achieved a measure of cross-range control by offsetting the vehicle's center of mass from its axis of symmetry, allowing the lift force to be directed left or right by rolling the capsule on its longitudinal axis. Other examples of the spherical section geometry in crewed capsules are Soyuz/Zond, Gemini, and Mercury. Even these small amounts of lift allow trajectories that have very significant effects on peak g-force, reducing it from 8\u20139\u00a0g for a purely ballistic (slowed only by drag) trajectory to 4\u20135\u00a0g, as well as greatly reducing the peak reentry heat.\nSphere-cone.\nThe sphere-cone is a spherical section with a frustum or blunted cone attached. The sphere-cone's dynamic stability is typically better than that of a spherical section. The vehicle enters sphere-first. With a sufficiently small half-angle and properly placed center of mass, a sphere-cone can provide aerodynamic stability from Keplerian entry to surface impact. (The \"half-angle\" is the angle between the cone's axis of rotational symmetry and its outer surface, and thus half the angle made by the cone's surface edges.)\nThe original American sphere-cone aeroshell was the Mk-2 RV (reentry vehicle), which was developed in 1955 by the General Electric Corp. The Mk-2's design was derived from blunt-body theory and used a radiatively cooled thermal protection system (TPS) based upon a metallic heat shield (the different TPS types are later described in this article). The Mk-2 had significant defects as a weapon delivery system, i.e., it loitered too long in the upper atmosphere due to its lower ballistic coefficient and also trailed a stream of vaporized metal making it very visible to radar. These defects made the Mk-2 overly susceptible to anti-ballistic missile (ABM) systems. Consequently, an alternative sphere-cone RV to the Mk-2 was developed by General Electric.\nThis new RV was the Mk-6 which used a non-metallic ablative TPS, a nylon phenolic. This new TPS was so effective as a reentry heat shield that significantly reduced bluntness was possible. However, the Mk-6 was a huge RV with an entry mass of 3,360\u00a0kg, a length of 3.1 m and a half-angle of 12.5\u00b0. Subsequent advances in nuclear weapon and ablative TPS design allowed RVs to become significantly smaller with a further reduced bluntness ratio compared to the Mk-6. Since the 1960s, the sphere-cone has become the preferred geometry for modern ICBM RVs with typical half-angles being between 10\u00b0 and 11\u00b0.\nReconnaissance satellite RVs (recovery vehicles) also used a sphere-cone shape and were the first American example of a non-munition entry vehicle (Discoverer-I, launched on 28 February 1959). The sphere-cone was later used for space exploration missions to other celestial bodies or for return from open space; e.g., \"Stardust\" probe. Unlike with military RVs, the advantage of the blunt body's lower TPS mass remained with space exploration entry vehicles like the Galileo Probe with a half-angle of 45\u00b0 or the Viking aeroshell with a half-angle of 70\u00b0. Space exploration sphere-cone entry vehicles have landed on the surface or entered the atmospheres of Mars, Venus, Jupiter, and Titan.\nBiconic.\nThe biconic is a sphere-cone with an additional frustum attached. The biconic offers a significantly improved L/D ratio. A biconic designed for Mars aerocapture typically has an L/D of approximately 1.0 compared to an L/D of 0.368 for the Apollo-CM. The higher L/D makes a biconic shape better suited for transporting people to Mars due to the lower peak deceleration. Arguably, the most significant biconic ever flown was the \"Advanced Maneuverable Reentry Vehicle\" (AMaRV). Four AMaRVs were made by the McDonnell Douglas Corp. and represented a significant leap in RV sophistication. Three AMaRVs were launched by Minuteman-1 ICBMs on 20 December 1979, 8 October 1980 and 4 October 1981. AMaRV had an entry mass of approximately 470\u00a0kg, a nose radius of 2.34\u00a0cm, a forward-frustum half-angle of 10.4\u00b0, an inter-frustum radius of 14.6\u00a0cm, aft-frustum half-angle of 6\u00b0, and an axial length of 2.079 meters. No accurate diagram or picture of AMaRV has ever appeared in the open literature. However, a schematic sketch of an AMaRV-like vehicle along with trajectory plots showing hairpin turns has been published.\nAMaRV's attitude was controlled through a split body flap (also called a \"split-windward flap\") along with two yaw flaps mounted on the vehicle's sides. Hydraulic actuation was used for controlling the flaps. AMaRV was guided by a fully autonomous navigation system designed for evading anti-ballistic missile (ABM) interception. The McDonnell Douglas DC-X (also a biconic) was essentially a scaled-up version of AMaRV. AMaRV and the DC-X also served as the basis for an unsuccessful proposal for what eventually became the Lockheed Martin X-33.\nNon-axisymmetric shapes.\nNon-axisymmetric shapes have been used for crewed entry vehicles. One example is the winged orbit vehicle that uses a delta wing for maneuvering during descent much like a conventional glider. This approach has been used by the American Space Shuttle, the Soviet Buran and the in-development Starship. The lifting body is another entry vehicle geometry and was used with the X-23 PRIME (Precision Recovery Including Maneuvering Entry) vehicle.\nEntry heating.\nObjects entering an atmosphere from space at high velocities relative to the atmosphere will cause very high levels of heating. Atmospheric entry heating comes principally from two sources:\nAs velocity increases, both convective and radiative heating increase, but at different rates. At very high speeds, radiative heating will dominate the convective heat fluxes, as radiative heating is proportional to the eighth power of velocity, while convective heating is proportional to the third power of velocity. Radiative heating thus predominates early in atmospheric entry, while convection predominates in the later phases.\nDuring certain intensity of ionization, a \"radio-blackout\" with the spacecraft is produced.\nWhile NASA's Earth entry interface is at , the main heating during controlled entry takes place at altitudes of , peaking at .\nShock layer gas physics.\nAt typical reentry temperatures, the air in the shock layer is both ionized and dissociated. This chemical dissociation necessitates various physical models to describe the shock layer's thermal and chemical properties. There are four basic physical models of a gas that are important to aeronautical engineers who design heat shields:\nPerfect gas model.\nAlmost all aeronautical engineers are taught the perfect (ideal) gas model during their undergraduate education. Most of the important perfect gas equations along with their corresponding tables and graphs are shown in NACA Report 1135. Excerpts from NACA Report 1135 often appear in the appendices of thermodynamics textbooks and are familiar to most aeronautical engineers who design supersonic aircraft.\nThe perfect gas theory is elegant and extremely useful for designing aircraft but assumes that the gas is chemically inert. From the standpoint of aircraft design, air can be assumed to be inert for temperatures less than at one atmosphere pressure. The perfect gas theory begins to break down at 550 K and is not usable at temperatures greater than . For temperatures greater than 2,000 K, a heat shield designer must use a \"real gas model\".\nReal (equilibrium) gas model.\nAn entry vehicle's pitching moment can be significantly influenced by real-gas effects. Both the Apollo command module and the Space Shuttle were designed using incorrect pitching moments determined through inaccurate real-gas modelling. The Apollo-CM's trim-angle angle of attack was higher than originally estimated, resulting in a narrower lunar return entry corridor. The actual aerodynamic center of the \"Columbia\" was upstream from the calculated value due to real-gas effects. On \"Columbia\"'s maiden flight (STS-1), astronauts John Young and Robert Crippen had some anxious moments during reentry when there was concern about losing control of the vehicle.\nAn equilibrium real-gas model assumes that a gas is chemically reactive, but also assumes all chemical reactions have had time to complete and all components of the gas have the same temperature (this is called \"thermodynamic equilibrium\"). When air is processed by a shock wave, it is superheated by compression and chemically dissociates through many different reactions. Direct friction upon the reentry object is not the main cause of shock-layer heating. It is caused mainly from isentropic heating of the air molecules within the compression wave. Friction based entropy increases of the molecules within the wave also account for some heating. The distance from the shock wave to the stagnation point on the entry vehicle's leading edge is called \"shock wave stand off\". An approximate rule of thumb for shock wave standoff distance is 0.14 times the nose radius. One can estimate the time of travel for a gas molecule from the shock wave to the stagnation point by assuming a free stream velocity of 7.8\u00a0km/s and a nose radius of 1 meter, i.e., time of travel is about 18 microseconds. This is roughly the time required for shock-wave-initiated chemical dissociation to approach chemical equilibrium in a shock layer for a 7.8\u00a0km/s entry into air during peak heat flux. Consequently, as air approaches the entry vehicle's stagnation point, the air effectively reaches chemical equilibrium thus enabling an equilibrium model to be usable. For this case, most of the shock layer between the shock wave and leading edge of an entry vehicle is chemically reacting and \"not\" in a state of equilibrium. The Fay\u2013Riddell equation, which is of extreme importance towards modeling heat flux, owes its validity to the stagnation point being in chemical equilibrium. The time required for the shock layer gas to reach equilibrium is strongly dependent upon the shock layer's pressure. For example, in the case of the \"Galileo\" probe's entry into Jupiter's atmosphere, the shock layer was mostly in equilibrium during peak heat flux due to the very high pressures experienced (this is counterintuitive given the free stream velocity was 39\u00a0km/s during peak heat flux).\nDetermining the thermodynamic state of the stagnation point is more difficult under an equilibrium gas model than a perfect gas model. Under a perfect gas model, the \"ratio of specific heats\" (also called \"isentropic exponent\", adiabatic index, \"gamma\", or \"kappa\") is assumed to be constant along with the gas constant. For a real gas, the ratio of specific heats can wildly oscillate as a function of temperature. Under a perfect gas model there is an elegant set of equations for determining thermodynamic state along a constant entropy stream line called the \"isentropic chain\". For a real gas, the isentropic chain is unusable and a \"Mollier diagram\" would be used instead for manual calculation. However, graphical solution with a Mollier diagram is now considered obsolete with modern heat shield designers using computer programs based upon a digital lookup table (another form of Mollier diagram) or a chemistry based thermodynamics program. The chemical composition of a gas in equilibrium with fixed pressure and temperature can be determined through the \"Gibbs free energy method\". Gibbs free energy is simply the total enthalpy of the gas minus its total entropy times temperature. A chemical equilibrium program normally does not require chemical formulas or reaction-rate equations. The program works by preserving the original elemental abundances specified for the gas and varying the different molecular combinations of the elements through numerical iteration until the lowest possible Gibbs free energy is calculated (a Newton\u2013Raphson method is the usual numerical scheme). The data base for a Gibbs free energy program comes from spectroscopic data used in defining partition functions. Among the best equilibrium codes in existence is the program \"Chemical Equilibrium with Applications\" (CEA) which was written by Bonnie J. McBride and Sanford Gordon at NASA Lewis (now renamed \"NASA Glenn Research Center\"). Other names for CEA are the \"Gordon and McBride Code\" and the \"Lewis Code\". CEA is quite accurate up to 10,000 K for planetary atmospheric gases, but unusable beyond 20,000 K (double ionization is not modelled). https:// along with full documentation and will compile on Linux under the G77 Fortran compiler.\nReal (non-equilibrium) gas model.\nA non-equilibrium real gas model is the most accurate model of a shock layer's gas physics, but is more difficult to solve than an equilibrium model. The simplest non-equilibrium model is the \"Lighthill-Freeman model\" developed in 1958. The Lighthill-Freeman model initially assumes a gas made up of a single diatomic species susceptible to only one chemical formula and its reverse; e.g., N2 = N + N and N + N = N2 (dissociation and recombination). Because of its simplicity, the Lighthill-Freeman model is a useful pedagogical tool, but is too simple for modelling non-equilibrium air. Air is typically assumed to have a mole fraction composition of 0.7812 molecular nitrogen, 0.2095 molecular oxygen and 0.0093 argon. The simplest real gas model for air is the \"five species model\", which is based upon N2, O2, NO, N, and O. The five species model assumes no ionization and ignores trace species like carbon dioxide.\nWhen running a Gibbs free energy equilibrium program, the iterative process from the originally specified molecular composition to the final calculated equilibrium composition is essentially random and not time accurate. With a non-equilibrium program, the computation process is time accurate and follows a solution path dictated by chemical and reaction rate formulas. The five species model has 17 chemical formulas (34 when counting reverse formulas). The Lighthill-Freeman model is based upon a single ordinary differential equation and one algebraic equation. The five species model is based upon 5 ordinary differential equations and 17 algebraic equations. Because the 5 ordinary differential equations are tightly coupled, the system is numerically \"stiff\" and difficult to solve. The five species model is only usable for entry from low Earth orbit where entry velocity is approximately . For lunar return entry of 11\u00a0km/s, the shock layer contains a significant amount of ionized nitrogen and oxygen. The five-species model is no longer accurate and a twelve-species model must be used instead.\nAtmospheric entry interface velocities on a Mars\u2013Earth trajectory are on the order of .\nModeling high-speed Mars atmospheric entry\u2014which involves a carbon dioxide, nitrogen and argon atmosphere\u2014is even more complex requiring a 19-species model.\nAn important aspect of modelling non-equilibrium real gas effects is radiative heat flux. If a vehicle is entering an atmosphere at very high speed (hyperbolic trajectory, lunar return) and has a large nose radius then radiative heat flux can dominate TPS heating. Radiative heat flux during entry into an air or carbon dioxide atmosphere typically comes from asymmetric diatomic molecules; e.g., cyanogen (CN), carbon monoxide, nitric oxide (NO), single ionized molecular nitrogen etc. These molecules are formed by the shock wave dissociating ambient atmospheric gas followed by recombination within the shock layer into new molecular species. The newly formed diatomic molecules initially have a very high vibrational temperature that efficiently transforms the vibrational energy into radiant energy; i.e., radiative heat flux. The whole process takes place in less than a millisecond which makes modelling a challenge. The experimental measurement of radiative heat flux (typically done with shock tubes) along with theoretical calculation through the unsteady Schr\u00f6dinger equation are among the more esoteric aspects of aerospace engineering. Most of the aerospace research work related to understanding radiative heat flux was done in the 1960s, but largely discontinued after conclusion of the Apollo Program. Radiative heat flux in air was just sufficiently understood to ensure Apollo's success. However, radiative heat flux in carbon dioxide (Mars entry) is still barely understood and will require major research.\nFrozen gas model.\nThe frozen gas model describes a special case of a gas that is not in equilibrium. The name \"frozen gas\" can be misleading. A frozen gas is not \"frozen\" like ice is frozen water. Rather a frozen gas is \"frozen\" in time (all chemical reactions are assumed to have stopped). Chemical reactions are normally driven by collisions between molecules. If gas pressure is slowly reduced such that chemical reactions can continue then the gas can remain in equilibrium. However, it is possible for gas pressure to be so suddenly reduced that almost all chemical reactions stop. For that situation the gas is considered frozen.\nThe distinction between equilibrium and frozen is important because it is possible for a gas such as air to have significantly different properties (speed-of-sound, viscosity etc.) for the same thermodynamic state; e.g., pressure and temperature. Frozen gas can be a significant issue in the wake behind an entry vehicle. During reentry, free stream air is compressed to high temperature and pressure by the entry vehicle's shock wave. Non-equilibrium air in the shock layer is then transported past the entry vehicle's leading side into a region of rapidly expanding flow that causes freezing. The frozen air can then be entrained into a trailing vortex behind the entry vehicle. Correctly modelling the flow in the wake of an entry vehicle is very difficult. Thermal protection shield (TPS) heating in the vehicle's afterbody is usually not very high, but the geometry and unsteadiness of the vehicle's wake can significantly influence aerodynamics (pitching moment) and particularly dynamic stability.\nThermal protection systems.\nA thermal protection system, or TPS, is the barrier that protects a spacecraft during the searing heat of atmospheric reentry. Multiple approaches for the thermal protection of spacecraft are in use, among them ablative heat shields, passive cooling, and active cooling of spacecraft surfaces. In general they can be divided into two categories: ablative TPS and reusable TPS. \nAblative TPS are required when space craft reach a relatively low altitude before slowing down. Spacecraft like the space shuttle are designed to slow down at high altitude so that they can use reuseable TPS. (see: Space Shuttle thermal protection system). \nThermal protection systems are tested in high enthalpy ground testing or plasma wind tunnels that reproduce the combination of high enthalpy and high stagnation pressure using Induction plasma or DC plasma.\nAblative.\nThe ablative heat shield functions by lifting the hot shock layer gas away from the heat shield's outer wall (creating a cooler boundary layer). The boundary layer comes from \"blowing\" of gaseous reaction products from the heat shield material and provides protection against all forms of heat flux. The overall process of reducing the heat flux experienced by the heat shield's outer wall by way of a boundary layer is called \"blockage\". Ablation occurs at two levels in an ablative TPS: the outer surface of the TPS material chars, melts, and sublimes, while the bulk of the TPS material undergoes pyrolysis and expels product gases. The gas produced by pyrolysis is what drives blowing and causes blockage of convective and catalytic heat flux. Pyrolysis can be measured in real time using thermogravimetric analysis, so that the ablative performance can be evaluated. Ablation can also provide blockage against radiative heat flux by introducing carbon into the shock layer thus making it optically opaque. Radiative heat flux blockage was the primary thermal protection mechanism of the Galileo Probe TPS material (carbon phenolic). \nEarly research on ablation technology in the United States was centered at NASA's Ames Research Center located at Moffett Field, California. Ames Research Center was ideal, since it had numerous wind tunnels capable of generating varying wind velocities. Initial experiments typically mounted a mock-up of the ablative material to be analyzed within a hypersonic wind tunnel. Testing of ablative materials occurs at the Ames Arc Jet Complex. Many spacecraft thermal protection systems have been tested in this facility, including the Apollo, space shuttle, and Orion heat shield materials.\nCarbon phenolic.\nCarbon phenolic was originally developed as a rocket nozzle throat material (used in the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster) and for reentry-vehicle nose tips.\nThe thermal conductivity of a particular TPS material is usually proportional to the material's density. Carbon phenolic is a very effective ablative material, but also has high density which is undesirable.\nThe NASA Galileo Probe used carbon phenolic for its TPS material.\nIf the heat flux experienced by an entry vehicle is insufficient to cause pyrolysis then the TPS material's conductivity could allow heat flux conduction into the TPS bondline material thus leading to TPS failure. Consequently, for entry trajectories causing lower heat flux, carbon phenolic is sometimes inappropriate and lower-density TPS materials such as the following examples can be better design choices:\nSuper light-weight ablator.\n\"SLA\" in \"SLA-561V\" stands for \"super light-weight ablator\". SLA-561V is a proprietary ablative made by Lockheed Martin that has been used as the primary TPS material on all of the 70\u00b0 sphere-cone entry vehicles sent by NASA to Mars other than the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL). SLA-561V begins significant ablation at a heat flux of approximately 110\u00a0W/cm2, but will fail for heat fluxes greater than 300\u00a0W/cm2. The MSL aeroshell TPS is currently designed to withstand a peak heat flux of 234\u00a0W/cm2. The peak heat flux experienced by the \"Viking 1\" aeroshell which landed on Mars was 21\u00a0W/cm2. For \"Viking 1\", the TPS acted as a charred thermal insulator and never experienced significant ablation. \"Viking 1\" was the first Mars lander and based upon a very conservative design. The Viking aeroshell had a base diameter of 3.54\u00a0meters (the largest used on Mars until Mars Science Laboratory). SLA-561V is applied by packing the ablative material into a honeycomb core that is pre-bonded to the aeroshell's structure thus enabling construction of a large heat shield.\nPhenolic-impregnated carbon ablator.\n\"Phenolic-impregnated carbon ablator\" (PICA), a carbon fiber preform impregnated in phenolic resin, is a modern TPS material and has the advantages of low density (much lighter than carbon phenolic) coupled with efficient ablative ability at high heat flux. It is a good choice for ablative applications such as high-peak-heating conditions found on sample-return missions or lunar-return missions. PICA's thermal conductivity is lower than other high-heat-flux-ablative materials, such as conventional carbon phenolics.\nPICA was patented by NASA Ames Research Center in the 1990s and was the primary TPS material for the Stardust aeroshell. The Stardust sample-return capsule was the fastest man-made object ever to reenter Earth's atmosphere, at 28,000\u00a0mph (ca. 12.5\u00a0km/s) at 135\u00a0km altitude. This was faster than the Apollo mission capsules and 70% faster than the Shuttle. PICA was critical for the viability of the Stardust mission, which returned to Earth in 2006. Stardust's heat shield (0.81\u00a0m base diameter) was made of one monolithic piece sized to withstand a nominal peak heating rate of 1.2\u00a0kW/cm2. A PICA heat shield was also used for the Mars Science Laboratory entry into the Martian atmosphere.\nPICA-X.\nAn improved and easier to produce version called PICA-X was developed by SpaceX in 2006\u20132010 for the Dragon space capsule. The first reentry test of a PICA-X heat shield was on the Dragon C1 mission on 8 December 2010. The PICA-X heat shield was designed, developed and fully qualified by a small team of a dozen engineers and technicians in less than four years.\nPICA-X is ten times less expensive to manufacture than the NASA PICA heat shield material.\nPICA-3.\nA second enhanced version of PICA\u2014called PICA-3\u2014was developed by SpaceX during the mid-2010s. It was first flight tested on the Crew Dragon spacecraft in 2019 during the flight demonstration mission, in April 2019, and put into regular service on that spacecraft in 2020.\nHARLEM.\nPICA and most other ablative TPS materials are either proprietary or classified, with formulations and manufacturing processes not disclosed in the open literature. This limits the ability of researchers to study these materials and hinders the development of thermal protection systems. Thus, the High Enthalpy Flow Diagnostics Group (HEFDiG) at the University of Stuttgart has developed an open carbon-phenolic ablative material, called the HEFDiG Ablation-Research Laboratory Experiment Material (HARLEM), from commercially available materials. HARLEM is prepared by impregnating a preform of a carbon fiber porous monolith (such as Calcarb rigid carbon insulation) with a solution of resole phenolic resin and polyvinylpyrrolidone in ethylene glycol, heating to polymerize the resin and then removing the solvent under vacuum. The resulting material is cured and machined to the desired shape.\nSIRCA.\nSilicone-impregnated reusable ceramic ablator (SIRCA) was also developed at NASA Ames Research Center and was used on the Backshell Interface Plate (BIP) of the \"Mars Pathfinder\" and Mars Exploration Rover (MER) aeroshells. The BIP was at the attachment points between the aeroshell's backshell (also called the afterbody or aft cover) and the cruise ring (also called the cruise stage). SIRCA was also the primary TPS material for the unsuccessful Deep Space 2 (DS/2) Mars impactor probes with their aeroshells. SIRCA is a monolithic, insulating material that can provide thermal protection through ablation. It is the only TPS material that can be machined to custom shapes and then applied directly to the spacecraft. There is no post-processing, heat treating, or additional coatings required (unlike Space Shuttle tiles). Since SIRCA can be machined to precise shapes, it can be applied as tiles, leading edge sections, full nose caps, or in any number of custom shapes or sizes. As of 1996[ [update]], SIRCA had been demonstrated in backshell interface applications, but not yet as a forebody TPS material.\nAVCOAT.\nAVCOAT is a NASA-developed material used in the design of several ablative heat shields.\nNASA originally used it for the Apollo command module in the 1960s, and then utilized the material for its next-generation beyond low Earth orbit Orion crew module, which first flew in a December 2014 test and then operationally in November 2022. The Avcoat to be used on Orion has been reformulated to meet environmental legislation that has been passed since the end of Apollo.\nThermal soak.\nThermal soak is a part of almost all TPS schemes. For example, an ablative heat shield loses most of its thermal protection effectiveness when the outer wall temperature drops below the minimum necessary for pyrolysis. From that time to the end of the heat pulse, heat from the shock layer convects into the heat shield's outer wall and would eventually conduct to the payload. This outcome can be prevented by ejecting the heat shield (with its heat soak) prior to the heat conducting to the inner wall.\nRefractory insulation.\nRefractory insulation keeps the heat in the outermost layer of the spacecraft surface, where it is conducted away by the air. The temperature of the surface rises to incandescent levels, so the material must have a very high melting point, and the material must also exhibit very low thermal conductivity. Materials with these properties tend to be brittle, delicate, and difficult to fabricate in large sizes, so they are generally fabricated as relatively small tiles that are then attached to the structural skin of the spacecraft. There is a tradeoff between toughness and thermal conductivity: less conductive materials are generally more brittle. The space shuttle used multiple types of tiles. Tiles are also used on the Boeing X-37, Dream Chaser, and Starship's upper stage.\nBecause insulation cannot be perfect, some heat energy is stored in the insulation and in the underlying material (\"thermal soaking\") and must be dissipated after the spacecraft exits the high-temperature flight regime. Some of this heat will re-radiate through the surface or will be carried off the surface by convection, but some will heat the spacecraft structure and interior, which may require active cooling after landing.\nTypical Space Shuttle TPS tiles (LI-900) have remarkable thermal protection properties. An LI-900 tile exposed to a temperature of 1,000 K on one side will remain merely warm to the touch on the other side. However, they are relatively brittle and break easily, and cannot survive in-flight rain.\nPassively cooled.\nIn some early ballistic missile RVs (e.g., the Mk-2 and the sub-orbital Mercury spacecraft), \"radiatively cooled TPS\" were used to initially absorb heat flux during the heat pulse, and, then, after the heat pulse, radiate and convect the stored heat back into the atmosphere. However, the earlier version of this technique required a considerable quantity of metal TPS (e.g., titanium, beryllium, copper, etc.). Modern designers prefer to avoid this added mass by using ablative and thermal-soak TPS instead.\nThermal protection systems relying on emissivity use high emissivity coatings (HECs) to facilitate radiative cooling, while an underlying porous ceramic layer serves to protect the structure from high surface temperatures. High thermally stable emissivity values coupled with low thermal conductivity are key to the functionality of such systems.\nRadiatively cooled TPS can be found on modern entry vehicles, but reinforced carbon\u2013carbon (RCC) (also called \"carbon\u2013carbon\") is normally used instead of metal. RCC was the TPS material on the Space Shuttle's nose cone and wing leading edges, and was also proposed as the leading-edge material for the X-33. Carbon is the most refractory material known, with a one-atmosphere sublimation temperature of for graphite. This high temperature made carbon an obvious choice as a radiatively cooled TPS material. Disadvantages of RCC are that it is currently expensive to manufacture, is heavy, and lacks robust impact resistance.\nSome high-velocity aircraft, such as the SR-71 Blackbird and Concorde, deal with heating similar to that experienced by spacecraft, but at much lower intensity, and for hours at a time. Studies of the SR-71's titanium skin revealed that the metal structure was restored to its original strength through annealing due to aerodynamic heating. In the case of the Concorde, the aluminium nose was permitted to reach a maximum operating temperature of (approximately warmer than the normally sub-zero, ambient air); the metallurgical implications (loss of temper) that would be associated with a higher peak temperature were the most significant factors determining the top speed of the aircraft.\nA radiatively cooled TPS for an entry vehicle is often called a \"hot-metal TPS\". Early TPS designs for the Space Shuttle called for a hot-metal TPS based upon a nickel superalloy (dubbed Ren\u00e9 41) and titanium shingles. This Shuttle TPS concept was rejected, because it was believed a silica tile-based TPS would involve lower development and manufacturing costs. A nickel superalloy-shingle TPS was again proposed for the unsuccessful X-33 single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) prototype.\nRecently, newer radiatively cooled TPS materials have been developed that could be superior to RCC. Known as Ultra-High Temperature Ceramics, they were developed for the prototype vehicle Slender Hypervelocity Aerothermodynamic Research Probe (SHARP). These TPS materials are based on zirconium diboride and hafnium diboride. SHARP TPS have suggested performance improvements allowing for sustained Mach 7 flight at sea level, Mach 11 flight at altitudes, and significant improvements for vehicles designed for continuous hypersonic flight. SHARP TPS materials enable sharp leading edges and nose cones to greatly reduce drag for airbreathing combined-cycle-propelled spaceplanes and lifting bodies. SHARP materials have exhibited effective TPS characteristics from zero to more than , with melting points over . They are structurally stronger than RCC, and, thus, do not require structural reinforcement with materials such as Inconel. SHARP materials are extremely efficient at reradiating absorbed heat, thus eliminating the need for additional TPS behind and between the SHARP materials and conventional vehicle structure. NASA initially funded (and discontinued) a multi-phase R&amp;D program through the University of Montana in 2001 to test SHARP materials on test vehicles.\nActively cooled.\nVarious advanced reusable spacecraft and hypersonic aircraft designs have been proposed to employ heat shields made from temperature-resistant metal alloys that incorporate a refrigerant or cryogenic fuel circulating through them.\nSuch a TPS concept was proposed for the X-30 National Aerospace Plane (NASP) in the mid-80s. The NASP was supposed to have been a scramjet powered hypersonic aircraft, but failed in development.\nIn 2005 and 2012, two unmanned lifting body craft with actively cooled hulls were launched as a part of the German Sharp Edge Flight Experiment (SHEFEX).\nIn early 2019, SpaceX was developing an actively cooled heat shield for its Starship spacecraft where a part of the thermal protection system will be a transpirationally cooled outer-skin design for the reentering spaceship. However, SpaceX abandoned this approach in favor of a modern version of heat shield tiles later in 2019.\nThe Stoke Space Nova second stage, announced in October 2023 and not yet flying, uses a regeneratively cooled (by liquid hydrogen) heat shield.\nIn the early 1960s various TPS systems were proposed to use water or other cooling liquid sprayed into the shock layer, or passed through channels in the heat shield. Advantages included the possibility of more all-metal designs which would be cheaper to develop, be more rugged, and eliminate the need for classified and unknown technology. The disadvantages are increased weight and complexity, and lower reliability. The concept has never been flown, but a similar technology (the plug nozzle) did undergo extensive ground testing.\nPropulsive entry.\nFuel permitting, nothing prevents a vehicle from entering the atmosphere with a retrograde engine burn, which has the double effect of slowing the vehicle down much faster than atmospheric drag alone would, and forcing the compressed hot air away from the vehicle's body. During reentry, the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 performs an entry burn to rapidly decelerate from its initial hypersonic speed.\nHigh-drag suborbital entry.\nIn 2004, aircraft designer Burt Rutan demonstrated the feasibility of a shape-changing airfoil for reentry with the sub-orbital SpaceShipOne. The wings on this craft rotate upward into the \"feathered configuration\" that provides a shuttlecock effect. Thus SpaceShipOne achieves much more aerodynamic drag on reentry while not experiencing significant thermal loads.\nThe configuration increases drag, as the craft is now less streamlined and results in more atmospheric gas particles hitting the spacecraft at higher altitudes than otherwise. The aircraft thus slows down more in higher atmospheric layers which is the key to efficient reentry. Secondly, the aircraft will \"automatically\" orient itself in this state to a high drag attitude.\nHowever, the velocity attained by SpaceShipOne prior to reentry is much lower than that of an orbital spacecraft, and engineers, including Rutan, recognize that a feathered reentry technique is not suitable for return from orbit.\nOn 4 May 2011, the first test on the SpaceShipTwo of the feathering mechanism was made during a glideflight after release\nfrom the White Knight Two. Premature deployment of the feathering system was responsible for the 2014 VSS \"Enterprise\" crash, in which the aircraft disintegrated, killing the co-pilot.\nThe feathered reentry was first described by Dean Chapman of NACA in 1958. In the section of his report on \"Composite Entry\", Chapman described a solution to the problem using a high-drag device:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It may be desirable to combine lifting and nonlifting entry in order to achieve some advantages... For landing maneuverability it obviously is advantageous to employ a lifting vehicle. The total heat absorbed by a lifting vehicle, however, is much higher than for a nonlifting vehicle... Nonlifting vehicles can more easily be constructed... by employing, for example, a large, light drag device... The larger the device, the smaller is the heating rate.\nNonlifting vehicles with shuttlecock stability are advantageous also from the viewpoint of minimum control requirements during entry.\n... an evident composite type of entry, which combines some of the desirable features of lifting and nonlifting trajectories, would be to enter first without lift but with a... drag device; then, when the velocity is reduced to a certain value... the device is jettisoned or retracted, leaving a lifting vehicle... for the remainder of the descent.\nInflatable heat shield entry.\nDeceleration for atmospheric reentry, especially for higher-speed Mars-return missions, benefits from maximizing \"the drag area of the entry system. The larger the diameter of the aeroshell, the bigger the payload can be.\" An inflatable aeroshell provides one alternative for enlarging the drag area with a low-mass design.\nRussia.\nSuch an inflatable shield/aerobrake was designed for the penetrators of Mars 96 mission. Since the mission failed due to the launcher malfunction, the NPO Lavochkin and DASA/ESA have designed a mission for Earth orbit. The Inflatable Reentry and Descent Technology (IRDT) demonstrator was launched on Soyuz-Fregat on 8 February 2000. The inflatable shield was designed as a cone with two stages of inflation. Although the second stage of the shield failed to inflate, the demonstrator survived the orbital reentry and was recovered. The subsequent missions flown on the Volna rocket failed due to launcher failure.\nNASA IRVE.\nNASA launched an inflatable heat shield experimental spacecraft on 17 August 2009 with the successful first test flight of the Inflatable Re-entry Vehicle Experiment (IRVE). The heat shield had been vacuum-packed into a payload shroud and launched on a Black Brant 9 sounding rocket from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility on Wallops Island, Virginia. \"Nitrogen inflated the heat shield, made of several layers of silicone-coated [Kevlar] fabric, to a mushroom shape in space several minutes after liftoff.\" The rocket apogee was at an altitude of where it began its descent to supersonic speed. Less than a minute later the shield was released from its cover to inflate at an altitude of . The inflation of the shield took less than 90 seconds.\nNASA HIAD.\nFollowing the success of the initial IRVE experiments, NASA developed the concept into the more ambitious Hypersonic Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerator (HIAD). The current design is shaped like a shallow cone, with the structure built up as a stack of circular inflated tubes of gradually increasing major diameter. The forward (convex) face of the cone is covered with a flexible thermal protection system robust enough to withstand the stresses of atmospheric entry (or reentry).\nIn 2012, a HIAD was tested as Inflatable Reentry Vehicle Experiment 3 (IRVE-3) using a sub-orbital sounding rocket, and worked.\nSee also Low-Density Supersonic Decelerator, a NASA project with tests in 2014 and 2015 of a 6 m diameter SIAD-R.\nLOFTID.\nA inflatable reentry vehicle, \"Low-Earth Orbit Flight Test of an Inflatable Decelerator\" (LOFTID), was launched in November 2022, inflated in orbit, reentered faster than Mach 25, and was successfully recovered on November 10.\nEntry vehicle design considerations.\nThere are four critical parameters considered when designing a vehicle for atmospheric entry:\nPeak heat flux and dynamic pressure selects the TPS material. Heat load selects the thickness of the TPS material stack. Peak deceleration is of major importance for crewed missions. The upper limit for crewed return to Earth from low Earth orbit (LEO) or lunar return is 10\"g\". For Martian atmospheric entry after long exposure to zero gravity, the upper limit is 4\"g\". Peak dynamic pressure can also influence the selection of the outermost TPS material if spallation is an issue. The reentry vehicle's design parameters may be assessed through numerical simulation, including simplifications of the vehicle's dynamics, such as the planar reentry equations and heat flux correlations.\nStarting from the principle of \"conservative design\", the engineer typically considers two worst-case trajectories, the undershoot and overshoot trajectories. The overshoot trajectory is typically defined as the shallowest-allowable entry velocity angle prior to atmospheric skip-off. The overshoot trajectory has the highest heat load and sets the TPS thickness. The undershoot trajectory is defined by the steepest allowable trajectory. For crewed missions the steepest entry angle is limited by the peak deceleration. The undershoot trajectory also has the highest peak heat flux and dynamic pressure. Consequently, the undershoot trajectory is the basis for selecting the TPS material. There is no \"one size fits all\" TPS material. A TPS material that is ideal for high heat flux may be too conductive (too dense) for a long duration heat load. A low-density TPS material might lack the tensile strength to resist spallation if the dynamic pressure is too high. A TPS material can perform well for a specific peak heat flux, but fail catastrophically for the same peak heat flux if the wall pressure is significantly increased (this happened with NASA's R-4 test spacecraft). Older TPS materials tend to be more labor-intensive and expensive to manufacture compared to modern materials. However, modern TPS materials often lack the flight history of the older materials (an important consideration for a risk-averse designer).\nBased upon Allen and Eggers discovery, maximum aeroshell bluntness (maximum drag) yields minimum TPS mass. Maximum bluntness (minimum ballistic coefficient) also yields a minimal terminal velocity at maximum altitude (very important for Mars EDL, but detrimental for military RVs). However, there is an upper limit to bluntness imposed by aerodynamic stability considerations based upon \"shock wave detachment\". A shock wave will remain attached to the tip of a sharp cone if the cone's half-angle is below a critical value. This critical half-angle can be estimated using perfect gas theory (this specific aerodynamic instability occurs below hypersonic speeds). For a nitrogen atmosphere (Earth or Titan), the maximum allowed half-angle is approximately 60\u00b0. For a carbon dioxide atmosphere (Mars or Venus), the maximum-allowed half-angle is approximately 70\u00b0. After shock wave detachment, an entry vehicle must carry significantly more shocklayer gas around the leading edge stagnation point (the subsonic cap). Consequently, the aerodynamic center moves upstream thus causing aerodynamic instability. It is incorrect to reapply an aeroshell design intended for Titan entry (\"Huygens\" probe in a nitrogen atmosphere) for Mars entry (\"Beagle 2\" in a carbon dioxide atmosphere). Prior to being abandoned, the Soviet Mars lander program achieved one successful landing (Mars 3), on the second of three entry attempts (the others were Mars 2 and Mars 6). The Soviet Mars landers were based upon a 60\u00b0 half-angle aeroshell design.\nA 45\u00b0 half-angle sphere-cone is typically used for atmospheric probes (surface landing not intended) even though TPS mass is not minimized. The rationale for a 45\u00b0 half-angle is to have either aerodynamic stability from entry-to-impact (the heat shield is not jettisoned) or a short-and-sharp heat pulse followed by prompt heat shield jettison. A 45\u00b0 sphere-cone design was used with the DS/2 Mars impactor and Pioneer Venus probes.\nAtmospheric entry accidents.\nNot all atmospheric reentries have been completely successful:\nSome reentries have resulted in significant disasters:\nUncontrolled and unprotected entries.\nOf satellites that reenter, approximately 10\u201340% of the mass of the object may reach the surface of the Earth. On average, about one catalogued object reentered per day .\nBecause the Earth's surface is predominantly water, most objects that survive reentry land in one of the world's oceans. The estimated chance that a given person would get hit and injured during their lifetime is around 1 in a trillion.\nOn January 24, 1978, the Soviet Kosmos 954 () reentered and crashed near Great Slave Lake in the Northwest Territories of Canada. The satellite was nuclear-powered and left radioactive debris near its impact site.\nOn July 11, 1979, the US Skylab space station () reentered and spread debris across the Australian Outback. The reentry was a major media event largely due to the Cosmos 954 incident, but not viewed as much as a potential disaster since it did not carry toxic nuclear or hydrazine fuel. NASA had originally hoped to use a Space Shuttle mission to either extend its life or enable a controlled reentry, but delays in the Shuttle program, plus unexpectedly high solar activity, made this impossible.\nOn February 7, 1991, the Soviet Salyut 7 space station (), with the Kosmos 1686 module () attached, reentered and scattered debris over the town of Capit\u00e1n Berm\u00fadez, Argentina. The station had been boosted to a higher orbit in August 1986 in an attempt to keep it up until 1994, but in a scenario similar to Skylab, the planned Buran shuttle was cancelled and high solar activity caused it to come down sooner than expected.\nOn September 7, 2011, NASA announced the impending uncontrolled reentry of the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite () and noted that there was a small risk to the public. The decommissioned satellite reentered the atmosphere on September 24, 2011, and some pieces are presumed to have crashed into the South Pacific Ocean over a debris field long.\nOn April 1, 2018, the Chinese Tiangong-1 space station () reentered over the Pacific Ocean, halfway between Australia and South America. The China Manned Space Engineering Office had intended to control the reentry, but lost telemetry and control in March 2017.\nOn May 11, 2020, the core stage of Chinese Long March 5B (COSPAR ID 2020-027C) weighing roughly ) made an uncontrolled reentry over the Atlantic Ocean, near West African coast. Few pieces of rocket debris reportedly survived reentry and fell over at least two villages in Ivory Coast.\nOn May 8, 2021, the core stage of Chinese Long March 5B (COSPAR ID 2021-0035B) weighing ) made an uncontrolled reentry, just west of the Maldives in the Indian Ocean (approximately 72.47\u00b0E longitude and 2.65\u00b0N latitude). Witnesses reported rocket debris as far away as the Arabian peninsula.\nDeorbit disposal.\nSalyut 1, the world's first space station, was deliberately de-orbited into the Pacific Ocean in 1971 following the Soyuz 11 accident. Its successor, Salyut 6, was de-orbited in a controlled manner as well.\nOn June 4, 2000, the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory was deliberately de-orbited after one of its gyroscopes failed. The debris that did not burn up fell harmlessly into the Pacific Ocean. The observatory was still operational, but the failure of another gyroscope would have made de-orbiting much more difficult and dangerous. With some controversy, NASA decided in the interest of public safety that a controlled crash was preferable to letting the craft come down at random.\nIn 2001, the Russian \"Mir\" space station was deliberately de-orbited, and broke apart in the fashion expected by the command center during atmospheric reentry. Mir entered the Earth's atmosphere on March 23, 2001, near Nadi, Fiji, and fell into the South Pacific Ocean.\nOn February 21, 2008, a disabled U.S. spy satellite, USA-193, was hit at an altitude of approximately with an SM-3 missile fired from the U.S. Navy cruiser off the coast of Hawaii. The satellite was inoperative, having failed to reach its intended orbit when it was launched in 2006. Due to its rapidly deteriorating orbit it was destined for uncontrolled reentry within a month. U.S. Department of Defense expressed concern that the fuel tank containing highly toxic hydrazine might survive reentry to reach the Earth's surface intact. Several governments including those of Russia, China, and Belarus protested the action as a thinly veiled demonstration of US anti-satellite capabilities. China had previously caused an international incident when it tested an anti-satellite missile in 2007.\nEnvironmental impact.\nAtmospheric entry has a measurable impact on Earth's atmosphere, particularly the stratosphere.\nAtmospheric entry mass by spacecraft accounted for 3% compared to entries by meteoroids in 2019, but in a scenario in which large amounts of proposed satellite internet constellations are realized, artificial entries would make up 40% compared to meteoroid entries. The impact of spacecraft burning up in the atmosphere during artificial atmospheric entry is different to meteors due to the spacecraft's generally larger size and different composition. The atmospheric pollutants produced by artificial atmospheric burning-up have been traced in the atmosphere and identified as reacting and possibly negatively impacting the composition of the atmosphere and particularly the ozone layer.\nConsidering space sustainability in regard to atmospheric impact of re-entry is by 2022 just developing and has been identified in 2024 as suffering from \"atmosphere-blindness\", causing global environmental injustice. This is identified as a result of the current end-of life spacecraft management, which favors the station keeping practice of controlled re-entry. This is mainly done to prevent the dangers from uncontrolled atmospheric entries and space debris.\nSuggested alternatives are the use of less polluting materials and by in-orbit servicing and potentially in-space recycling.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "45302", "revid": "50644454", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45302", "title": "Saint Rosalia", "text": "Patron saint of Palermo, Italy\nRosalia (; ; 1130\u20131166), nicknamed (\"the Little Saint\") was a virgin and hermit on Monte Pellegrino. She is venerated as the patroness saint of Palermo in Italy, Camargo in Chihuahua, and three towns in Venezuela: El Hatillo, Zuata, and El Play\u00f3n. She is especially important internationally as a saint invoked in times of plague. From 2020 onwards she has been invoked by some citizens of Palermo to protect the city from COVID-19.\nLife.\nRosalia was born of a Norman noble family that claimed descent from Charlemagne. Devoutly religious, she retired to live as a hermit in a cave on Mount Pellegrino, where she died alone in 1166. Tradition says that she was led to the cave by two angels. On the cave wall she wrote \"I, Rosalia, daughter of Sinibald, Lord of [Monte] delle Rose, and Quisquina, have taken the resolution to live in this cave for the love of my Lord, Jesus Christ.\"\n1624 plague.\nIn 1624, a plague beset Palermo. During this hardship Rosalia reportedly appeared first to a sick woman, then to a hunter, to whom she indicated where her remains were to be found. She ordered him to bring her bones to Palermo and have them carried in procession through the city.\nThe hunter climbed the mountain and found her bones in the cave as described. He did what she had asked in the apparition. After her remains were carried around the city three times, the plague ceased. After this Rosalia was venerated as the patroness saint of Palermo, and a sanctuary was built in the cave where her remains were discovered.\nHer post-1624 iconography is dominated by the work of the Flemish painter Anthony van Dyck, who was trapped in the city during the 1624\u20131625 quarantine, during which time he produced five paintings of Rosalia, now in Madrid, Houston, London, New York and Palermo itself. In 1629 he also produced \"Saint Rosalia Interceding for the City of Palermo\" and \"Coronation of Saint Rosalia\" to assist Jesuit efforts to spread devotion to her beyond Sicily.\nVeneration.\nIn Palermo, the Festino di Santa Rosalia is held each year on 14 July, and continues into the next day. It is a major social and religious event in the city.\nThe feastday of St. Rosalia is on 4 September.\nThe devotion to Santa Rosalia is widespread among the large and mainly Hindu Tamil community of Sri Lankan origin settled in Palermo.\nOn 4 September, a tradition of walking barefoot from Palermo up to the Sanctuary of Santa Rosalia high up on Mount Pellegrino is observed in honor of Rosalia. In Italian-American communities in the United States, the July feast is generally dedicated to Our Lady of Mount Carmel while the September feast, beginning in August, brings large numbers of visitors annually to the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn in New York City.\nSanta Rosalia is venerated as the patroness of the Italian sardine fishing fleet in Monterey, California. \nAlso, although St. Rosalia lived in a period after the Great Schism, some Orthodox faithful today recognise and venerate her as a saint.\nIn biology.\nRosalia was proposed as the patroness saint of evolutionary studies in a paper by G.E. Hutchinson. This was due to a visit he paid to a pool of water downstream from the cave where St. Rosalia's remains were found, where he developed ideas based on observations of water boatmen.\nIn art.\nSaint Rosalia was an important subject in Italian Renaissance and Baroque painting, particularly in sacre conversazioni (group pictures of saints flanking the Virgin Mary) by artists such as Riccardo Quartararo, Mario di Laurito, Vincenzo La Barbara, and possibly Antonello da Messina.\nIt was the Flemish master Anthony van Dyck (1599\u20131637), who was caught up in Palermo during the 1624 plague, who produced the most paintings of her. His depictions \u2013 a young woman with flowing blonde hair, wearing a Franciscan cowl and reaching down toward the city of Palermo in its peril \u2013 became the standard iconography of Rosalia from that time onward. Van Dyck's series of St. Rosalia paintings have been studied by Gauvin Alexander Bailey and Xavier F. Salomon, both of whom curated or co-curated exhibitions devoted to the theme of Italian art and the plague. In March 2020, \"The New York Times\" published an article about the Metropolitan Museum of Art's painting of Saint Rosalia by Van Dyck in the context of COVID-19.\nVan Dyck also made designs for prints which were engraved by Philips van Mallery for the publication \"Vita S. Rosaliae Virginis Panormitanae Pestis Patron\u00e6 iconibus expressa\", which was published by Cornelis Galle the Elder in Antwerp in 1629. Only a few copies of the work, which recounts the life of Saint Rosalia, survive.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In many cases, a thread is a component of a process. \nThe multiple threads of a given process may be executed concurrently (via multithreading capabilities), sharing resources such as memory, while different processes do not share these resources. In particular, the threads of a process share its executable code and the values of its dynamically allocated variables and non-thread-local global variables at any given time. \nThe implementation of threads and processes differs between operating systems. \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistory.\nThreads made an early appearance under the name of \"tasks\" in IBM's batch processing operating system, OS/360, in 1967. It provided users with three available configurations of the OS/360 control system, of which multiprogramming with a variable number of tasks (MVT) was one. Saltzer (1966) credits Victor A. Vyssotsky with the term \"thread\".\nThe Mach implementation of threads was described in the summer of 1986. OS/2 1.0, released in 1987, supported threads. The first version of Windows to have threads was Windows NT, which was released in 1993.\nThe use of threads in software applications became more common in the early 2000s as CPUs began to utilize multiple cores. Applications wishing to take advantage of multiple cores for performance advantages were required to employ concurrency to utilize the multiple cores.\nRelated concepts.\nScheduling can be done at the kernel level or user level, and multitasking can be done preemptively or cooperatively. This yields a variety of related concepts.\nProcesses.\nAt the kernel level, a \"process\" contains one or more \"kernel threads\", which share the process's resources, such as memory and file handles \u2013 a process is a unit of resources, while a thread is a unit of scheduling and execution. Kernel scheduling is typically uniformly done preemptively or, less commonly, cooperatively. At the user level a process such as a runtime system can itself schedule multiple threads of execution. If these do not share data, as in Erlang, they are usually analogously called processes, while if they share data they are usually called \"(user) threads\", particularly if preemptively scheduled. Cooperatively scheduled user threads are known as \"fibers\"; different processes may schedule user threads differently. User threads may be executed by kernel threads in various ways (one-to-one, many-to-one, many-to-many). The term \"light-weight process\" variously refers to user threads or to kernel mechanisms for scheduling user threads onto kernel threads.\nA process is a heavyweight unit of kernel scheduling, as creating, destroying, and switching processes is relatively expensive. Processes own resources allocated by the operating system. Resources include memory (for both code and data), file handles, sockets, device handles, windows, and a process control block. Processes are \"isolated\" by process isolation, and do not share address spaces or file resources except through explicit methods such as inheriting file handles or shared memory segments, or mapping the same file in a shared way \u2013 see Interprocess communication. Creating or destroying a process is relatively expensive, as resources must be acquired or released. Processes are typically preemptively multitasked, and process switching is relatively expensive, beyond basic cost of context switching, due to issues such as cache flushing (in particular, process switching changes virtual memory addressing, causing invalidation and thus flushing of an untagged translation lookaside buffer (TLB), notably on x86).\nKernel threads.\nA \"kernel thread\" is a lightweight unit of kernel scheduling. At least one kernel thread exists within each process. If multiple kernel threads exist within a process, then they share the same memory and file resources. Kernel threads are preemptively multitasked if the operating system's process scheduler is preemptive. Kernel threads do not own resources except for a stack, a copy of the registers including the program counter, and thread-local storage (if any), and are thus relatively cheap to create and destroy. Thread switching is also relatively cheap: it requires a context switch (saving and restoring registers and stack pointer), but does not change virtual memory and is thus cache-friendly (leaving TLB valid). The kernel can assign one or more software threads to each core in a CPU (it being able to assign itself multiple software threads depending on its support for multithreading), and can swap out threads that get blocked. However, kernel threads take much longer than user threads to be swapped.\nUser threads.\nThreads are sometimes implemented in userspace libraries, thus called \"user threads\". The kernel is unaware of them, so they are managed and scheduled in userspace. Some implementations base their user threads on top of several kernel threads, to benefit from multi-processor machines (M:N model). User threads as implemented by virtual machines are also called green threads.\nAs user thread implementations are typically entirely in userspace, context switching between user threads within the same process is extremely efficient because it does not require any interaction with the kernel at all: a context switch can be performed by locally saving the CPU registers used by the currently executing user thread or fiber and then loading the registers required by the user thread or fiber to be executed. Since scheduling occurs in userspace, the scheduling policy can be more easily tailored to the requirements of the program's workload.\nHowever, the use of blocking system calls in user threads (as opposed to kernel threads) can be problematic. If a user thread or a fiber performs a system call that blocks, the other user threads and fibers in the process are unable to run until the system call returns. A typical example of this problem is when performing I/O: most programs are written to perform I/O synchronously. When an I/O operation is initiated, a system call is made, and does not return until the I/O operation has been completed. In the intervening period, the entire process is \"blocked\" by the kernel and cannot run, which starves other user threads and fibers in the same process from executing.\nA common solution to this problem (used, in particular, by many green threads implementations) is providing an I/O API that implements an interface that blocks the calling thread, rather than the entire process, by using non-blocking I/O internally, and scheduling another user thread or fiber while the I/O operation is in progress. Similar solutions can be provided for other blocking system calls. Alternatively, the program can be written to avoid the use of synchronous I/O or other blocking system calls (in particular, using non-blocking I/O, including lambda continuations and/or async/await primitives).\nFibers.\nFibers are an even lighter unit of scheduling which are cooperatively scheduled: a running fiber must explicitly \"yield\" to allow another fiber to run, which makes their implementation much easier than kernel or user threads. A fiber can be scheduled to run in any thread in the same process. This permits applications to gain performance improvements by managing scheduling themselves, instead of relying on the kernel scheduler (which may not be tuned for the application). Some research implementations of the OpenMP parallel programming model implement their tasks through fibers. Closely related to fibers are coroutines, with the distinction being that coroutines are a language-level construct, while fibers are a system-level construct.\nThreads vs processes.\nThreads differ from traditional multitasking operating-system processes in several ways:\nSystems such as Windows NT and OS/2 are said to have \"cheap\" threads and \"expensive\" processes; in other operating systems there is not so great a difference except in the cost of an address-space switch, which on some architectures (notably x86) results in a translation lookaside buffer (TLB) flush.\nAdvantages and disadvantages of threads vs processes include:\nScheduling.\nPreemptive vs cooperative scheduling.\nOperating systems schedule threads either preemptively or cooperatively.Multi-user operating systems generally favor preemptive multithreading for its finer-grained control over execution time via context switching. However, preemptive scheduling may context-switch threads at moments unanticipated by programmers, thus causing lock convoy, priority inversion, or other side-effects. In contrast, cooperative multithreading relies on threads to relinquish control of execution, thus ensuring that threads run to completion. This can cause problems if a cooperatively-multitasked thread blocks by waiting on a resource or if it starves other threads by not yielding control of execution during intensive computation.\nSingle- vs multi-processor systems.\nUntil the early 2000s, most desktop computers had only one single-core CPU, with no support for hardware threads, although threads were still used on such computers because switching between threads was generally still quicker than full-process context switches. In 2002, Intel added support for simultaneous multithreading to the Pentium\u00a04 processor, under the name \"hyper-threading\"; in 2005, they introduced the dual-core Pentium\u00a0D processor and AMD introduced the dual-core Athlon\u00a064\u00a0X2 processor.\nSystems with a single processor generally implement multithreading by time slicing: the central processing unit (CPU) switches between different \"software threads\". This context switching usually occurs frequently enough that users perceive the threads or tasks as running in parallel (for popular server/desktop operating systems, maximum time slice of a thread, when other threads are waiting, is often limited to 100\u2013200ms). On a multiprocessor or multi-core system, multiple threads can execute in parallel, with every processor or core executing a separate thread simultaneously; on a processor or core with \"hardware threads\", separate software threads can also be executed concurrently by separate hardware threads.\nThreading models.\n1:1 (kernel-level threading).\nThreads created by the user in a 1:1 correspondence with schedulable entities in the kernel are the simplest possible threading implementation. OS/2 and Win32 used this approach from the start, while on Linux the GNU C Library implements this approach (via the NPTL or older LinuxThreads). This approach is also used by Solaris, NetBSD, FreeBSD, macOS, and iOS.\n\"M\":1 (user-level threading).\nAn \"M\":1 model implies that all application-level threads map to one kernel-level scheduled entity; the kernel has no knowledge of the application threads. With this approach, context switching can be done very quickly and, in addition, it can be implemented even on simple kernels which do not support threading. One of the major drawbacks, however, is that it cannot benefit from the hardware acceleration on multithreaded processors or multi-processor computers: there is never more than one thread being scheduled at the same time. For example: If one of the threads needs to execute an I/O request, the whole process is blocked and the threading advantage cannot be used. The GNU Portable Threads uses User-level threading, as does State Threads.\n\"M\":\"N\" (hybrid threading).\n\"M\":\"N\" maps some M number of application threads onto some N number of kernel entities, or \"virtual processors.\" This is a compromise between kernel-level (\"1:1\") and user-level (\"\"N\":1\") threading. In general, \"\"M\":\"N\"\" threading systems are more complex to implement than either kernel or user threads, because changes to both kernel and user-space code are required. In the M:N implementation, the threading library is responsible for scheduling user threads on the available schedulable entities; this makes context switching of threads very fast, as it avoids system calls. However, this increases complexity and the likelihood of priority inversion, as well as suboptimal scheduling without extensive (and expensive) coordination between the userland scheduler and the kernel scheduler.\nHistory of threading models in Unix systems.\nSunOS 4.x implemented \"light-weight processes\" or LWPs. NetBSD 2.x+, and DragonFly BSD implement LWPs as kernel threads (1:1 model). SunOS 5.2 through SunOS 5.8 as well as NetBSD 2 to NetBSD 4 implemented a two level model, multiplexing one or more user level threads on each kernel thread (M:N model). SunOS 5.9 and later, as well as NetBSD 5 eliminated user threads support, returning to a 1:1 model. FreeBSD 5 implemented M:N model. FreeBSD 6 supported both 1:1 and M:N, users could choose which one should be used with a given program using /etc/libmap.conf. Starting with FreeBSD 7, the 1:1 became the default. FreeBSD 8 no longer supports the M:N model.\nSingle-threaded vs multithreaded programs.\nIn computer programming, \"single-threading\" is the processing of one instruction at a time. In the formal analysis of the variables' semantics and process state, the term \"single threading\" can be used differently to mean \"backtracking within a single thread\", which is common in the functional programming community.\nMultithreading is mainly found in multitasking operating systems. Multithreading is a widespread programming and execution model that allows multiple threads to exist within the context of one process. These threads share the process's resources, but are able to execute independently. The threaded programming model provides developers with a useful abstraction of concurrent execution. Multithreading can also be applied to one process to enable parallel execution on a multiprocessing system.\nMultithreading libraries tend to provide a function call to create a new thread, which takes a function as a parameter. A concurrent thread is then created which starts running the passed function and ends when the function returns. The thread libraries also offer data synchronization functions.\nThreads and data synchronization.\nThreads in the same process share the same address space. This allows concurrently running code to couple tightly and conveniently exchange data without the overhead or complexity of an IPC. When shared between threads, however, even simple data structures become prone to race conditions if they require more than one CPU instruction to update: two threads may end up attempting to update the data structure at the same time and find it unexpectedly changing underfoot. Bugs caused by race conditions can be very difficult to reproduce and isolate.\nTo prevent this, threading application programming interfaces (APIs) offer synchronization primitives such as mutexes to lock data structures against concurrent access. On uniprocessor systems, a thread running into a locked mutex must sleep and hence trigger a context switch. On multi-processor systems, the thread may instead poll the mutex in a spinlock. Both of these may sap performance and force processors in symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) systems to contend for the memory bus, especially if the granularity of the locking is too fine.\nOther synchronization APIs include condition variables, critical sections, semaphores, and monitors.\nThread pools.\nA popular programming pattern involving threads is that of thread pools where a set number of threads are created at startup that then wait for a task to be assigned. When a new task arrives, it wakes up, completes the task and goes back to waiting. This avoids the relatively expensive thread creation and destruction functions for every task performed and takes thread management out of the application developer's hand and leaves it to a library or the operating system that is better suited to optimize thread management.\nMultithreaded programs vs single-threaded programs pros and cons.\nMultithreaded applications have the following advantages vs single-threaded ones:\nMultithreaded applications have the following drawbacks:\nProgramming language support.\nMany programming languages support threading in some capacity.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}

As \"K\"-algebras, they generalize the real numbers, complex numbers, quaternions and several other hypercomplex number systems. The theory of Clifford algebras is intimately connected with the theory of quadratic forms and orthogonal transformations. Clifford algebras have important applications in a variety of fields including geometry, theoretical physics and digital image processing. They are named after the English mathematician William Kingdon Clifford (1845\u20131879). \nThe most familiar Clifford algebras, the orthogonal Clifford algebras, are also referred to as (\"pseudo-\")\"Riemannian Clifford algebras\", as distinct from \"symplectic Clifford algebras\".\nIntroduction and basic properties.\nA Clifford algebra is a unital associative algebra that contains and is generated by a vector space \"V\" over a field \"K\", where \"V\" is equipped with a quadratic form \"Q\" : \"V\" \u2192 \"K\". The Clifford algebra Cl(\"V\", \"Q\") is the \"freest\" unital associative algebra generated by \"V\" subject to the condition\nformula_1\nwhere the product on the left is that of the algebra, and the 1 on the right is the algebra's multiplicative identity (not to be confused with the multiplicative identity of \"K\"). The idea of being the \"freest\" or \"most general\" algebra subject to this identity can be formally expressed through the notion of a universal property, as done below.\nWhen \"V\" is a finite-dimensional real vector space and \"Q\" is nondegenerate, Cl(\"V\", \"Q\") may be identified by the label Cl\"p\",\"q\"(R), indicating that \"V\" has an orthogonal basis with \"p\" elements with \"e\"\"i\"2 = +1, \"q\" with \"ei\"2 = \u22121, and where R indicates that this is a Clifford algebra over the reals; i.e. coefficients of elements of the algebra are real numbers. Such a basis may be found by orthogonal diagonalization.\nThe free algebra generated by \"V\" may be written as the tensor algebra \u2a01\"n\"\u22650 \"V\" \u2297 \u22ef \u2297 \"V\", that is, the direct sum of the tensor product of \"n\" copies of \"V\" over all \"n\". Therefore one obtains a Clifford algebra as the quotient of this tensor algebra by the two-sided ideal generated by elements of the form \"v\" \u2297 \"v\" \u2212 \"Q\"(\"v\")1 for all elements \"v\" \u2208 \"V\". The product induced by the tensor product in the quotient algebra is written using juxtaposition (e.g. \"uv\"). Its associativity follows from the associativity of the tensor product.\nThe Clifford algebra has a distinguished subspace\u00a0\"V\", being the image of the embedding map. Such a subspace cannot in general be uniquely determined given only a \"K\"-algebra that is isomorphic to the Clifford algebra.\nIf 2 is invertible in the ground field \"K\", then one can rewrite the fundamental identity above in the form\nformula_2\nwhere\nformula_3\nis the symmetric bilinear form associated with \"Q\", via the polarization identity.\nQuadratic forms and Clifford algebras in characteristic 2 form an exceptional case in this respect. In particular, if char(\"K\") = 2 it is not true that a quadratic form necessarily or uniquely determines a symmetric bilinear form that satisfies \"Q\"(\"v\") = \u27e8\"v\", \"v\"\u27e9, Many of the statements in this article include the condition that the characteristic is not 2, and are false if this condition is removed.\nAs a quantization of the exterior algebra.\nClifford algebras are closely related to exterior algebras. Indeed, if \"Q\" = 0 then the Clifford algebra Cl(\"V\", \"Q\") is just the exterior algebra \u22c0\"V\". Whenever 2 is invertible in the ground field\u00a0\"K\", there exists a canonical \"linear\" isomorphism between \u22c0\"V\" and Cl(\"V\", \"Q\"). That is, they are naturally isomorphic as vector spaces, but with different multiplications (in the case of characteristic two, they are still isomorphic as vector spaces, just not naturally). Clifford multiplication together with the distinguished subspace is strictly richer than the exterior product since it makes use of the extra information provided by\u00a0\"Q\".\nThe Clifford algebra is a filtered algebra; the associated graded algebra is the exterior algebra.\nMore precisely, Clifford algebras may be thought of as \"quantizations\" (cf. quantum group) of the exterior algebra, in the same way that the Weyl algebra is a quantization of the symmetric algebra.\nWeyl algebras and Clifford algebras admit a further structure of a *-algebra, and can be unified as even and odd terms of a superalgebra, as discussed in CCR and CAR algebras.\nUniversal property and construction.\nLet \"V\" be a vector space over a field\u00a0\"K\", and let \"Q\" : \"V\" \u2192 \"K\" be a quadratic form on \"V\". In most cases of interest the field \"K\" is either the field of real numbers\u00a0R, or the field of complex numbers\u00a0C, or a finite field.\nA Clifford algebra Cl(\"V\", \"Q\") is a pair (\"B\", \"i\"), where \"B\" is a unital associative algebra over \"K\" and \"i\" is a linear map \"i\" : \"V\" \u2192 \"B\" that satisfies \"i\"(\"v\")2 = \"Q\"(\"v\")1\"B\" for all \"v\" in \"V\", defined by the following universal property: given any unital associative algebra \"A\" over \"K\" and any linear map \"j\" : \"V\" \u2192 \"A\" such that\nformula_4\n(where 1\"A\" denotes the multiplicative identity of \"A\"), there is a unique algebra homomorphism \"f\" : \"B\" \u2192 \"A\" such that the following diagram commutes (i.e. such that \"f\" \u2218 \"i\" = \"j\"):\nThe quadratic form \"Q\" may be replaced by a (not necessarily symmetric) bilinear form that has the property \u27e8\"v\", \"v\"\u27e9 = \"Q\"(\"v\"), \"v\" \u2208 \"V\", in which case an equivalent requirement on \"j\" is\nformula_5\nWhen the characteristic of the field is not 2, this may be replaced by what is then an equivalent requirement,\nformula_6\nwhere the bilinear form may additionally be restricted to being symmetric without loss of generality.\nA Clifford algebra as described above always exists and can be constructed as follows: start with the most general algebra that contains \"V\", namely the tensor algebra \"T\"(\"V\"), and then enforce the fundamental identity by taking a suitable quotient. In our case we want to take the two-sided ideal \"IQ\" in \"T\"(\"V\") generated by all elements of the form\nformula_7 for all formula_8\nand define Cl(\"V\", \"Q\") as the quotient algebra\nformula_9\nThe ring product inherited by this quotient is sometimes referred to as the Clifford product to distinguish it from the exterior product and the scalar product.\nIt is then straightforward to show that Cl(\"V\", \"Q\") contains \"V\" and satisfies the above universal property, so that Cl is unique up to a unique isomorphism; thus one speaks of \"the\" Clifford algebra Cl(\"V\", \"Q\"). It also follows from this construction that \"i\" is injective. One usually drops the\u00a0\"i\" and considers \"V\" as a linear subspace of Cl(\"V\", \"Q\").\nThe universal characterization of the Clifford algebra shows that the construction of Cl(\"V\", \"Q\") is functorial in nature. Namely, Cl can be considered as a functor from the category of vector spaces with quadratic forms (whose morphisms are linear maps that preserve the quadratic form) to the category of associative algebras. The universal property guarantees that linear maps between vector spaces (that preserve the quadratic form) extend uniquely to algebra homomorphisms between the associated Clifford algebras.\nBasis and dimension.\nSince \"V\" comes equipped with a quadratic form\u00a0\"Q\", in characteristic not equal to 2 there exist bases for \"V\" that are orthogonal. An orthogonal basis is one such that for a symmetric bilinear form\nformula_10 for formula_11, and formula_12\nThe fundamental Clifford identity implies that for an orthogonal basis\nformula_13 for formula_14, and formula_15\nThis makes manipulation of orthogonal basis vectors quite simple. Given a product formula_16 of \"distinct\" orthogonal basis vectors of \"V\", one can put them into a standard order while including an overall sign determined by the number of pairwise swaps needed to do so (i.e. the signature of the ordering permutation).\nIf the dimension of \"V\" over \"K\" is \"n\" and {\"e\"1, ..., \"e\"\"n\"} is an orthogonal basis of (\"V\", \"Q\"), then Cl(\"V\", \"Q\") is free over \"K\" with a basis\nformula_17\nThe empty product (\"k\" = 0) is defined as being the multiplicative identity element. For each value of \"k\" there are \"n\" choose \"k\" basis elements, so the total dimension of the Clifford algebra is\nformula_18\nExamples: real and complex Clifford algebras.\nThe most important Clifford algebras are those over real and complex vector spaces equipped with nondegenerate quadratic forms.\nEach of the algebras Cl\"p\",\"q\"(R) and Cl\"n\"(C) is isomorphic to \"A\" or \"A\" \u2295 \"A\", where \"A\" is a full matrix ring with entries from R, C, or\u00a0H. For a complete classification of these algebras see \"Classification of Clifford algebras\".\nReal numbers.\nClifford algebras are also sometimes referred to as geometric algebras, most often over the real numbers.\nEvery nondegenerate quadratic form on a finite-dimensional real vector space is equivalent to the standard diagonal form:\nformula_19\nwhere \"n\" = \"p\" + \"q\" is the dimension of the vector space. The pair of integers (\"p\", \"q\") is called the signature of the quadratic form. The real vector space with this quadratic form is often denoted R\"p\",\"q\". The Clifford algebra on R\"p\",\"q\" is denoted Cl\"p\",\"q\"(R). The symbol Cl\"n\"(R) means either Cl\"n\",0(R) or Cl0,\"n\"(R), depending on whether the author prefers positive-definite or negative-definite spaces.\nA standard basis {\"e\"1, ..., \"e\"\"n\"} for R\"p\",\"q\" consists of \"n\" = \"p\" + \"q\" mutually orthogonal vectors, \"p\" of which square to +1 and \"q\" of which square to\u00a0\u22121. Of such a basis, the algebra Cl\"p\",\"q\"(R) will therefore have \"p\" vectors that square to +1 and \"q\" vectors that square to\u00a0\u22121.\nA few low-dimensional cases are:\nComplex numbers.\nOne can also study Clifford algebras on complex vector spaces. Every nondegenerate quadratic form on a complex vector space of dimension \"n\" is equivalent to the standard diagonal form\nformula_20\nThus, for each dimension \"n\", up to isomorphism there is only one Clifford algebra of a complex vector space with a nondegenerate quadratic form. We will denote the Clifford algebra on C\"n\" with the standard quadratic form by Cl\"n\"(C).\nFor the first few cases one finds that\nwhere M\"n\"(C) denotes the algebra of \"n\" \u00d7 \"n\" matrices over C.\nExamples: constructing quaternions and dual quaternions.\nQuaternions.\nIn this section, Hamilton's quaternions are constructed as the even subalgebra of the Clifford algebra Cl3,0(R).\nLet the vector space \"V\" be real three-dimensional space\u00a0R3, and the quadratic form be the usual quadratic form. Then, for \"v\", \"w\" in R3 we have the bilinear form (or scalar product)\nformula_21\nNow introduce the Clifford product of vectors \"v\" and \"w\" given by\nformula_22\nDenote a set of orthogonal unit vectors of R3 as {\"e\"1, \"e\"2, \"e\"3}, then the Clifford product yields the relations\nformula_23\nand\nformula_24\nThe general element of the Clifford algebra Cl3,0(R) is given by\nformula_25\nThe linear combination of the even degree elements of Cl3,0(R) defines the even subalgebra Cl(R) with the general element\nformula_26\nThe basis elements can be identified with the quaternion basis elements \"i\", \"j\", \"k\" as\nformula_27\nwhich shows that the even subalgebra Cl(R) is Hamilton's real quaternion algebra.\nTo see this, compute\nformula_28\nand\nformula_29\nFinally,\nformula_30\nDual quaternions.\nIn this section, dual quaternions are constructed as the even subalgebra of a Clifford algebra of real four-dimensional space with a degenerate quadratic form.\nLet the vector space \"V\" be real four-dimensional space R4, and let the quadratic form \"Q\" be a degenerate form derived from the Euclidean metric on R3. For \"v\", \"w\" in R4 introduce the degenerate bilinear form\nformula_31\nThis degenerate scalar product projects distance measurements in R4 onto the R3 hyperplane.\nThe Clifford product of vectors \"v\" and \"w\" is given by\nformula_32\nNote the negative sign is introduced to simplify the correspondence with quaternions.\nDenote a set of mutually orthogonal unit vectors of R4 as {\"e\"1, \"e\"2, \"e\"3, \"e\"4}, then the Clifford product yields the relations\nformula_33\nand\nformula_34\nThe general element of the Clifford algebra Cl(R4, \"d\") has 16 components. The linear combination of the even degree elements defines the even subalgebra Cl[0](R4, \"d\") with the general element\nformula_35\nThe basis elements can be identified with the quaternion basis elements \"i\", \"j\", \"k\" and the dual unit \"\u03b5\" as\nformula_36\nThis provides the correspondence of Cl(R) with dual quaternion algebra.\nTo see this, compute\nformula_37\nand\nformula_38\nThe exchanges of \"e\"1 and \"e\"4 alternate signs an even number of times, and show the dual unit \"\u03b5\" commutes with the quaternion basis elements \"i\", \"j\", \"k\".\nExamples: in small dimension.\nLet \"K\" be any field of characteristic not 2.\nDimension 1.\nFor dim \"V\" = 1, if \"Q\" has diagonalization diag(\"a\"), that is there is a non-zero vector \"x\" such that \"Q\"(\"x\") = \"a\", then Cl(\"V\", \"Q\") is algebra-isomorphic to a \"K\"-algebra generated by an element \"x\" that satisfies \"x\"2 = \"a\", the quadratic algebra \"K\"[\"X\"] / (\"X\"2 \u2212 \"a\").\nIn particular, if \"a\" = 0 (that is, \"Q\" is the zero quadratic form) then Cl(\"V\", \"Q\") is algebra-isomorphic to the dual numbers algebra over \"K\".\nIf \"a\" is a non-zero square in \"K\", then Cl(\"V\", \"Q\") \u2243 \"K\" \u2295 \"K\".\nOtherwise, Cl(\"V\", \"Q\") is isomorphic to the quadratic field extension \"K\"(\u221a\"a\") of \"K\".\nDimension 2.\nFor dim \"V\" = 2, if \"Q\" has diagonalization diag(\"a\", \"b\") with non-zero \"a\" and \"b\" (which always exists if \"Q\" is non-degenerate), then Cl(\"V\", \"Q\") is isomorphic to a \"K\"-algebra generated by elements \"x\" and \"y\" that satisfies \"x\"2 = \"a\", \"y\"2 = \"b\" and \"xy\" = \u2212\"yx\".\nThus Cl(\"V\", \"Q\") is isomorphic to the (generalized) quaternion algebra (\"a\", \"b\")\"K\". We retrieve Hamilton's quaternions when \"a\" = \"b\" = \u22121, since H = (\u22121, \u22121)R.\nAs a special case, if some \"x\" in \"V\" satisfies \"Q\"(\"x\") = 1, then Cl(\"V\", \"Q\") \u2243 M2(\"K\").\nProperties.\nRelation to the exterior algebra.\nGiven a vector space\u00a0\"V\", one can construct the exterior algebra \u22c0\"V\", whose definition is independent of any quadratic form on \"V\". It turns out that if \"K\" does not have characteristic 2 then there is a natural isomorphism between \u22c0\"V\" and Cl(\"V\", \"Q\") considered as vector spaces (and there exists an isomorphism in characteristic two, which may not be natural). This is an algebra isomorphism if and only if \"Q\" = 0. One can thus consider the Clifford algebra Cl(\"V\", \"Q\") as an enrichment (or more precisely, a quantization, cf. the Introduction) of the exterior algebra on \"V\" with a multiplication that depends on\u00a0\"Q\" (one can still define the exterior product independently of\u00a0\"Q\").\nThe easiest way to establish the isomorphism is to choose an \"orthogonal\" basis {\"e\"1, ..., \"e\"\"n\"} for \"V\" and extend it to a basis for Cl(\"V\", \"Q\") as described above. The map Cl(\"V\", \"Q\") \u2192 \u22c0\"V\" is determined by\nformula_39\nNote that this works only if the basis {\"e\"1, ..., \"e\"\"n\"} is orthogonal. One can show that this map is independent of the choice of orthogonal basis and so gives a natural isomorphism.\nIf the characteristic of \"K\" is 0, one can also establish the isomorphism by antisymmetrizing. Define functions \"fk\" : \"V\" \u00d7 \u22ef \u00d7 \"V\" \u2192 Cl(\"V\", \"Q\") by\nformula_40\nwhere the sum is taken over the symmetric group on \"k\" elements, S\"k\". Since \"f\"\"k\" is alternating, it induces a unique linear map \u22c0\"k\" \"V\" \u2192 Cl(\"V\", \"Q\"). The direct sum of these maps gives a linear map between \u22c0\"V\" and Cl(\"V\", \"Q\"). This map can be shown to be a linear isomorphism, and it is natural.\nA more sophisticated way to view the relationship is to construct a filtration on Cl(\"V\", \"Q\"). Recall that the tensor algebra \"T\"(\"V\") has a natural filtration: \"F\"0 \u2282 \"F\"1 \u2282 \"F\"2 \u2282 \u22ef, where \"F\"\"k\" contains sums of tensors with order \u2264 \"k\". Projecting this down to the Clifford algebra gives a filtration on Cl(\"V\", \"Q\"). The associated graded algebra\nformula_41\nis naturally isomorphic to the exterior algebra \u22c0\"V\". Since the associated graded algebra of a filtered algebra is always isomorphic to the filtered algebra as filtered vector spaces (by choosing complements of \"Fk\" in \"F\"\"k\"+1 for all\u00a0\"k\"), this provides an isomorphism (although not a natural one) in any characteristic, even two.\nGrading.\nIn the following, assume that the characteristic is not\u00a02.\nClifford algebras are Z2-graded algebras (also known as superalgebras). Indeed, the linear map on \"V\" defined by \"v\" \u21a6 \u2212\"v\" (reflection through the origin) preserves the quadratic form \"Q\" and so by the universal property of Clifford algebras extends to an algebra automorphism\nformula_42\nSince \"\u03b1\" is an involution (i.e. it squares to the identity) one can decompose Cl(\"V\", \"Q\") into positive and negative eigenspaces of\u00a0\"\u03b1\"\nformula_43\nwhere \nformula_44\nSince \"\u03b1\" is an automorphism it follows that:\nformula_45\nwhere the bracketed superscripts are read modulo\u00a02. This gives Cl(\"V\", \"Q\") the structure of a Z2-graded algebra. The subspace Cl[0](\"V\", \"Q\") forms a subalgebra of Cl(\"V\", \"Q\"), called the \"even subalgebra\". The subspace Cl[1](\"V\", \"Q\") is called the \"odd part\" of Cl(\"V\", \"Q\") (it is not a subalgebra). This Z2-grading plays an important role in the analysis and application of Clifford algebras. The automorphism \"\u03b1\" is called the \"main involution\" or \"grade involution\". Elements that are pure in this Z2-grading are simply said to be even or odd.\n\"Remark\". The Clifford algebra is not a Z-graded algebra, but is Z-filtered, where Cl\u2264\"i\"(\"V\", \"Q\") is the subspace spanned by all products of at most \"i\" elements of\u00a0V.\nformula_46\nThe \"degree\" of a Clifford number usually refers to the degree in the Z-grading.\nThe even subalgebra Cl[0](\"V\", \"Q\") of a Clifford algebra is itself isomorphic to a Clifford algebra. If \"V\" is the orthogonal direct sum of a vector \"a\" of nonzero norm \"Q\"(\"a\") and a subspace \"U\", then Cl[0](\"V\", \"Q\") is isomorphic to Cl(\"U\", \u2212\"Q\"(\"a\")\"Q\"|\"U\"), where \"Q\"|\"U\" is the form \"Q\" restricted to \"U\". In particular over the reals this implies that:\nformula_47\nIn the negative-definite case this gives an inclusion Cl0,\"n\" \u2212 1(R) \u2282 Cl0,\"n\"(R), which extends the sequence\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;R \u2282 C \u2282 H \u2282 H \u2295 H \u2282 \u22ef\nLikewise, in the complex case, one can show that the even subalgebra of Cl\"n\"(C) is isomorphic to Cl\"n\"\u22121(C).\nAntiautomorphisms.\nIn addition to the automorphism \"\u03b1\", there are two antiautomorphisms that play an important role in the analysis of Clifford algebras. Recall that the tensor algebra \"T\"(\"V\") comes with an antiautomorphism that reverses the order in all products of vectors:\nformula_48\nSince the ideal \"I\"\"Q\" is invariant under this reversal, this operation descends to an antiautomorphism of Cl(\"V\", \"Q\") called the \"transpose\" or \"reversal\" operation, denoted by \"x\"t. The transpose is an antiautomorphism: (\"xy\")t = \"y\"t \"x\"t. The transpose operation makes no use of the Z2-grading so we define a second antiautomorphism by composing \"\u03b1\" and the transpose. We call this operation \"Clifford conjugation\" denoted formula_49\nformula_50\nOf the two antiautomorphisms, the transpose is the more fundamental.\nNote that all of these operations are involutions. One can show that they act as \u00b11 on elements that are pure in the Z-grading. In fact, all three operations depend on only the degree modulo\u00a04. That is, if \"x\" is pure with degree \"k\" then\nformula_51\nwhere the signs are given by the following table:\nClifford scalar product.\nWhen the characteristic is not 2, the quadratic form \"Q\" on \"V\" can be extended to a quadratic form on all of Cl(\"V\", \"Q\") (which we also denoted by \"Q\"). A basis-independent definition of one such extension is\nformula_52\nwhere \u27e8\"a\"\u27e90 denotes the scalar part of \"a\" (the degree-0 part in the Z-grading). One can show that\nformula_53\nwhere the \"vi\" are elements of \"V\" \u2013 this identity is \"not\" true for arbitrary elements of Cl(\"V\", \"Q\").\nThe associated symmetric bilinear form on Cl(\"V\", \"Q\") is given by\nformula_54\nOne can check that this reduces to the original bilinear form when restricted to \"V\". The bilinear form on all of Cl(\"V\", \"Q\") is nondegenerate if and only if it is nondegenerate on \"V\".\nThe operator of left (respectively right) Clifford multiplication by the transpose \"a\"t of an element \"a\" is the adjoint of left (respectively right) Clifford multiplication by \"a\" with respect to this inner product. That is,\nformula_55\nand\nformula_56\nStructure of Clifford algebras.\n\"In this section we assume that characteristic is not 2, the vector space V is finite-dimensional and that the associated symmetric bilinear form of Q is nondegenerate.\" \nA central simple algebra over \"K\" is a matrix algebra over a (finite-dimensional) division algebra with center \"K\". For example, the central simple algebras over the reals are matrix algebras over either the reals or the quaternions.\nThe structure of Clifford algebras can be worked out explicitly using the following result. Suppose that \"U\" has even dimension and a non-singular bilinear form with discriminant \"d\", and suppose that \"V\" is another vector space with a quadratic form. The Clifford algebra of \"U\" + \"V\" is isomorphic to the tensor product of the Clifford algebras of \"U\" and (\u22121)dim(\"U\")/2\"dV\", which is the space \"V\" with its quadratic form multiplied by (\u22121)dim(\"U\")/2\"d\". Over the reals, this implies in particular that\nformula_57\nformula_58\nformula_59\nThese formulas can be used to find the structure of all real Clifford algebras and all complex Clifford algebras; see the classification of Clifford algebras.\nNotably, the Morita equivalence class of a Clifford algebra (its representation theory: the equivalence class of the category of modules over it) depends on only the signature (\"p\" \u2212 \"q\") mod 8. This is an algebraic form of Bott periodicity.\nLipschitz group.\nThe class of Lipschitz groups ( Clifford groups or Clifford\u2013Lipschitz groups) was discovered by Rudolf Lipschitz.\nIn this section we assume that \"V\" is finite-dimensional and the quadratic form \"Q\" is nondegenerate.\nAn action on the elements of a Clifford algebra by its group of units may be defined in terms of a twisted conjugation: twisted conjugation by \"x\" maps \"y\" \u21a6 \"\u03b1\"(\"x\") \"y\" \"x\"\u22121, where \"\u03b1\" is the \"main involution\" defined above.\nThe Lipschitz group \u0393 is defined to be the set of invertible elements \"x\" that \"stabilize the set of vectors\" under this action, meaning that for all \"v\" in \"V\" we have:\nformula_60\nThis formula also defines an action of the Lipschitz group on the vector space \"V\" that preserves the quadratic form \"Q\", and so gives a homomorphism from the Lipschitz group to the orthogonal group. The Lipschitz group contains all elements \"r\" of \"V\" for which \"Q\"(\"r\") is invertible in \"K\", and these act on \"V\" by the corresponding reflections that take \"v\" to \"v\" \u2212 (\u27e8\"r\", \"v\"\u27e9 + \u27e8\"v\", \"r\"\u27e9)\"r\"\u200d/\u200d\"Q\"(\"r\"). (In characteristic 2 these are called orthogonal transvections rather than reflections.)\nIf \"V\" is a finite-dimensional real vector space with a non-degenerate quadratic form then the Lipschitz group maps onto the orthogonal group of \"V\" with respect to the form (by the Cartan\u2013Dieudonn\u00e9 theorem) and the kernel consists of the nonzero elements of the field\u00a0\"K\". This leads to exact sequences\nformula_61\nformula_62\nOver other fields or with indefinite forms, the map is not in general onto, and the failure is captured by the spinor norm.\nSpinor norm.\nIn arbitrary characteristic, the spinor norm \"Q\" is defined on the Lipschitz group by\nformula_63\nIt is a homomorphism from the Lipschitz group to the group \"K\"\u00d7 of non-zero elements of \"K\". It coincides with the quadratic form \"Q\" of \"V\" when \"V\" is identified with a subspace of the Clifford algebra. Several authors define the spinor norm slightly differently, so that it differs from the one here by a factor of \u22121, 2, or \u22122 on\u00a0\u03931. The difference is not very important in characteristic other than 2.\nThe nonzero elements of \"K\" have spinor norm in the group (\"K\"\u00d7)2 of squares of nonzero elements of the field \"K\". So when \"V\" is finite-dimensional and non-singular we get an induced map from the orthogonal group of \"V\" to the group \"K\"\u00d7\u200d/\u200d(\"K\"\u00d7)2, also called the spinor norm. The spinor norm of the reflection about \"r\"\u22a5, for any vector \"r\", has image \"Q\"(\"r\") in \"K\"\u00d7\u200d/\u200d(\"K\"\u00d7)2, and this property uniquely defines it on the orthogonal group. This gives exact sequences:\nformula_64\nNote that in characteristic 2 the group {\u00b11} has just one element.\nFrom the point of view of Galois cohomology of algebraic groups, the spinor norm is a connecting homomorphism on cohomology. Writing \"\u03bc\"2 for the algebraic group of square roots of 1 (over a field of characteristic not 2 it is roughly the same as a two-element group with trivial Galois action), the short exact sequence\nformula_65\nyields a long exact sequence on cohomology, which begins\nformula_66\nThe 0th Galois cohomology group of an algebraic group with coefficients in \"K\" is just the group of \"K\"-valued points: \"H\"0(\"G\"; \"K\") = \"G\"(\"K\"), and \"H\"1(\u03bc2; \"K\") \u2245 \"K\"\u00d7\u200d/\u200d(\"K\"\u00d7)2, which recovers the previous sequence\nformula_67\nwhere the spinor norm is the connecting homomorphism \"H\"0(O\"V\"; \"K\") \u2192 \"H\"1(\u03bc2; \"K\").\nSpin and pin groups.\nIn this section we assume that \"V\" is finite-dimensional and its bilinear form is non-singular.\nThe pin group Pin\"V\"(\"K\") is the subgroup of the Lipschitz group \u0393 of elements of spinor norm 1, and similarly the spin group Spin\"V\"(\"K\") is the subgroup of elements of Dickson invariant 0 in Pin\"V\"(\"K\"). When the characteristic is not 2, these are the elements of determinant 1. The spin group usually has index 2 in the pin group.\nRecall from the previous section that there is a homomorphism from the Lipschitz group onto the orthogonal group. We define the special orthogonal group to be the image of \u03930. If \"K\" does not have characteristic 2 this is just the group of elements of the orthogonal group of determinant 1. If \"K\" does have characteristic 2, then all elements of the orthogonal group have determinant 1, and the special orthogonal group is the set of elements of Dickson invariant 0.\nThere is a homomorphism from the pin group to the orthogonal group. The image consists of the elements of spinor norm 1 \u2208 \"K\"\u00d7\u200d/\u200d(\"K\"\u00d7)2. The kernel consists of the elements +1 and \u22121, and has order 2 unless \"K\" has characteristic 2. Similarly there is a homomorphism from the Spin group to the special orthogonal group of\u00a0\"V\".\nIn the common case when \"V\" is a positive or negative definite space over the reals, the spin group maps onto the special orthogonal group, and is simply connected when \"V\" has dimension at least 3. Further the kernel of this homomorphism consists of 1 and \u22121. So in this case the spin group, Spin(\"n\"), is a double cover of SO(\"n\"). Note, however, that the simple connectedness of the spin group is not true in general: if \"V\" is R\"p\",\"q\" for \"p\" and \"q\" both at least 2 then the spin group is not simply connected. In this case the algebraic group Spin\"p\",\"q\" is simply connected as an algebraic group, even though its group of real valued points Spin\"p\",\"q\"(R) is not simply connected. This is a rather subtle point, which completely confused the authors of at least one standard book about spin groups.\nSpinors.\nClifford algebras Cl\"p\",\"q\"(C), with \"p\" + \"q\" = 2\"n\" even, are matrix algebras that have a complex representation of dimension 2\"n\". By restricting to the group Pin\"p\",\"q\"(R) we get a complex representation of the Pin group of the same dimension, called the spin representation. If we restrict this to the spin group Spin\"p\",\"q\"(R) then it splits as the sum of two \"half spin representations\" (or \"Weyl representations\") of dimension\u00a02\"n\"\u22121.\nIf \"p\" + \"q\" = 2\"n\" + 1 is odd then the Clifford algebra Cl\"p\",\"q\"(C) is a sum of two matrix algebras, each of which has a representation of dimension 2\"n\", and these are also both representations of the pin group Pin\"p\",\"q\"(R). On restriction to the spin group Spin\"p\",\"q\"(R) these become isomorphic, so the spin group has a complex spinor representation of dimension\u00a02\"n\".\nMore generally, spinor groups and pin groups over any field have similar representations whose exact structure depends on the structure of the corresponding Clifford algebras: whenever a Clifford algebra has a factor that is a matrix algebra over some division algebra, we get a corresponding representation of the pin and spin groups over that division algebra.\nFor examples over the reals see the article on spinors.\nReal spinors.\nTo describe the real spin representations, one must know how the spin group sits inside its Clifford algebra. The pin group, Pin\"p\",\"q\" is the set of invertible elements in Cl\"p\",\"q\" that can be written as a product of unit vectors:\nformula_68\nComparing with the above concrete realizations of the Clifford algebras, the pin group corresponds to the products of arbitrarily many reflections: it is a cover of the full orthogonal group O(\"p\", \"q\"). The spin group consists of those elements of Pin\"p\",\"q\" that are products of an even number of unit vectors. Thus by the Cartan\u2013Dieudonn\u00e9 theorem Spin is a cover of the group of proper rotations SO(\"p\", \"q\").\nLet \"\u03b1\" : Cl \u2192 Cl be the automorphism that is given by the mapping \"v\" \u21a6 \u2212\"v\" acting on pure vectors. Then in particular, Spin\"p\",\"q\" is the subgroup of Pin\"p\",\"q\" whose elements are fixed by \"\u03b1\". Let\nformula_69\n(These are precisely the elements of even degree in Cl\"p\",\"q\".) Then the spin group lies within Cl.\nThe irreducible representations of Cl\"p\",\"q\" restrict to give representations of the pin group. Conversely, since the pin group is generated by unit vectors, all of its irreducible representation are induced in this manner. Thus the two representations coincide. For the same reasons, the irreducible representations of the spin coincide with the irreducible representations of Cl.\nTo classify the pin representations, one need only appeal to the classification of Clifford algebras. To find the spin representations (which are representations of the even subalgebra), one can first make use of either of the isomorphisms (see above)\nformula_70\nformula_71\nand realize a spin representation in signature (\"p\", \"q\") as a pin representation in either signature (\"p\", \"q\" \u2212 1) or (\"q\", \"p\" \u2212 1).\nApplications.\nDifferential geometry.\nOne of the principal applications of the exterior algebra is in differential geometry where it is used to define the bundle of differential forms on a smooth manifold. In the case of a (pseudo-)Riemannian manifold, the tangent spaces come equipped with a natural quadratic form induced by the metric. Thus, one can define a Clifford bundle in analogy with the exterior bundle. This has a number of important applications in Riemannian geometry. Perhaps more important is the link to a spin manifold, its associated spinor bundle and spinc manifolds.\nPhysics.\nClifford algebras have numerous important applications in physics. Physicists usually consider a Clifford algebra to be an algebra that has a basis that is generated by the matrices \"\u03b3\"0, ..., \"\u03b3\"3, called Dirac matrices, which have the property that\nformula_72\nwhere \"\u03b7\" is the matrix of a quadratic form of signature (1, 3) (or (3, 1) corresponding to the two equivalent choices of metric signature). These are exactly the defining relations for the Clifford algebra Cl(R), whose complexification is Cl(R)C, which, by the classification of Clifford algebras, is isomorphic to the algebra of 4 \u00d7 4 complex matrices Cl4(C) \u2248 M4(C). However, it is best to retain the notation Cl(R)C, since any transformation that takes the bilinear form to the canonical form is \"not\" a Lorentz transformation of the underlying spacetime.\nThe Clifford algebra of spacetime used in physics thus has more structure than Cl4(C). It has in addition a set of preferred transformations \u2013 Lorentz transformations. Whether complexification is necessary to begin with depends in part on conventions used and in part on how much one wants to incorporate straightforwardly, but complexification is most often necessary in quantum mechanics where the spin representation of the Lie algebra so(1, 3) sitting inside the Clifford algebra conventionally requires a complex Clifford algebra. For reference, the spin Lie algebra is given by\nformula_73\nThis is in the (3, 1) convention, hence fits in Cl(R)C.\nThe Dirac matrices were first written down by Paul Dirac when he was trying to write a relativistic first-order wave equation for the electron, and give an explicit isomorphism from the Clifford algebra to the algebra of complex matrices. The result was used to define the Dirac equation and introduce the Dirac operator. The entire Clifford algebra shows up in quantum field theory in the form of Dirac field bilinears.\nThe use of Clifford algebras to describe quantum theory has been advanced among others by Mario Sch\u00f6nberg, by David Hestenes in terms of geometric calculus, by David Bohm and Basil Hiley and co-workers in form of a hierarchy of Clifford algebras, and by Elio Conte et al.\nComputer vision.\nClifford algebras have been applied in the problem of action recognition and classification in computer vision. Rodriguez et al propose a Clifford embedding to generalize traditional MACH filters to video (3D spatiotemporal volume), and vector-valued data such as optical flow. Vector-valued data is analyzed using the Clifford Fourier Transform. Based on these vectors action filters are synthesized in the Clifford Fourier domain and recognition of actions is performed using Clifford correlation. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the Clifford embedding by recognizing actions typically performed in classic feature films and sports broadcast television.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its name means 'Red Sand' in Turkic languages. It is located in Central Asia, in the land between the confluent rivers Amu Darya and Syr Darya, a region historically known as Transoxania. Today it is divided among Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. It covers about .\nGeography.\nKyzylkum is mainly located in Uzbekistan. Its territory consists mainly of an extensive plain at an altitude up to above sea level, with a number of depressions and highlands (Sultanuizdag, Bukantau). Most of the area is covered with dunes (barchans); in the northwest large areas are covered with takirs (clay coatings); there are also some oases. There are agricultural settlements along the rivers and in the oases. Temperatures can be very high during the summer months, from mid-May to mid-September. Kerki, one extreme inland city located on the banks of the Amu Darya River, recorded in July 1983.\nFauna.\nDesert fauna include the Russian tortoise (\"Testudo horsfieldii\") and a large lizard known as the Transcaspian or desert monitor (\"Varanus griseus\"), which can reach lengths of . The saiga antelope (\"Saiga tatarica\") also occasionally migrates through the northern part of the desert.\nKyzylkum Nature Reserve in Bukhara Region was established in 1971. The area of the reserve amounts to and it is located on flood-land (tugai) drained by the Amudarya close to the settlement Dargan Ata. Fauna include: Bactrian deer (\"Cervus elaphus bactrianus\"), wild boar (\"Sus scrofa\"), common pheasant (\"Phasianus colchicus\"), golden eagle (\"Aquila chrysaetus\").\nDjeyran Reserve is located south of Bukhara. The total area of this reserve is . It is a breeding centre for rare species such as goitered gazelle (\"Gazella subgutturosa\"), Przewalski's horse (\"Equus ferus przewalskii\"), Turkmenian kulan (\"Equus hemionus kulan\") and MacQueen's bustard (\"Chlamydotis macqueenii\"). The reserve was founded in 1977 on the enclosed area in .\nPaleontology.\nThe Kyzylkum Desert has exposed rock formations that have yielded a number of fossils. Of particular interest is the Bissekty Formation of Uzbekistan, from the early Late Cretaceous, which has produced several species of early birds: \"Incolornis martini\", \"Explorornis walkeri\", \"Kizylkumavis cretacea\", \"Kuszholia mengi\", \"Lenesornis kaskarovi\", \"Sazavis prisca\", \"Zhyraornis kaskarovi\" and \"Z. logunovi\" are recognized as valid species. Tyrannosaurid, therizinosaurid, ornithomimosaur, oviraptorosaurian, troodontid, ankylosaur, hadrosaur, and ceratopsian dinosaurs are also known from this rock unit. Other fossils from the Cretaceous rocks of the Kyzylkum include tree trunks, pelecypods, beetles, sharks, rays, bony fish, frogs, salamanders, turtles, crocodylomorphs, pterosaurs, and a varied fauna of small early mammals. Paleontologists that have worked in this area include J. David Archibald, Alexander Averianov, Sergei Kurzanov, Lev Nessov, Anatoly Riabinin, Anatoly Rozhdestvensky, and Hans-Dieter Sues.\nEconomy.\nThe local population uses the large spaces of the Kyzylkum Desert as a pasture for livestock (mostly sheep, Bactrian camels and dromedaries).\nThe desert is well known for its deposits of gold, uranium, copper, aluminium and silver, natural gas and oil. The development of the most famous gold-field at Muruntau began in the early 1970s. The centres for the mining and smelting industry at the region are Navoi, Zarafshan, Uchkuduk. The major industrial enterprises are: \u041d\u0413\u041c\u041a (Navoi Mining and Smelting Complex) and the Uzbek U.S.A. Joint Venture \"Zarafshan-Newmont\".

The time scale of a quantum jump has not been measured experimentally. However, the Franck\u2013Condon principle binds the upper limit of this parameter to the order of attoseconds.\nElectrons can \"relax\" into states of lower energy by emitting electromagnetic radiation in the form of a photon. Electrons can also absorb passing photons, which \"excites\" the electron into a state of higher energy. The larger the energy separation between the electron's initial and final state, the shorter the photons' wavelength.\nHistory.\nDanish physicist Niels Bohr first theorized that electrons can perform quantum jumps in 1913. Soon after, James Franck and Gustav Ludwig Hertz proved experimentally that atoms have quantized energy states.\nThe observability of quantum jumps was predicted by Hans Dehmelt in 1975, and they were first observed using trapped ions of barium at University of Hamburg and mercury at NIST in 1986.\nTheory.\nAn atom interacts with the oscillating electric field:\nwith amplitude formula_1, angular frequency formula_2, and polarization vector formula_3. Note that the actual phase is formula_4. However, in many cases, the variation of formula_5 is small over the atom (or equivalently, the radiation wavelength is much greater than the size of an atom) and this term can be ignored. This is called the dipole approximation. The atom can also interact with the oscillating magnetic field produced by the radiation, although much more weakly.\nThe Hamiltonian for this interaction, analogous to the energy of a classical dipole in an electric field, is formula_6. The stimulated transition rate can be calculated using time-dependent perturbation theory; however, the result can be summarized using Fermi's golden rule:\nformula_7\nThe dipole matrix element can be decomposed into the product of the radial integral and the angular integral. The angular integral is zero unless the selection rules for the atomic transition are satisfied.\nRecent discoveries.\nIn 2019, it was demonstrated in an experiment with a superconducting artificial atom consisting of two strongly-hybridized transmon qubits placed inside a readout resonator cavity at 15\u00a0mK, that the evolution of some jumps is continuous, coherent, deterministic, and reversible. On the other hand, other quantum jumps are inherently unpredictable.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The depression is part of the Western Desert of Egypt.\nThe Qattara Depression lies below sea level, and its bottom is covered with salt pans, sand dunes, and salt marshes. The depression extends between the latitudes of 28\u00b035' and 30\u00b025' north and the longitudes of 26\u00b020' and 29\u00b002' east.\nThe Qattara Depression was created by the interplay of salt weathering and wind erosion. Some west of the depression lie the oases of Siwa in Egypt and Jaghbub in Libya in smaller but similar depressions.\nThe Qattara Depression contains the second lowest point in Africa at an elevation of below sea level, the lowest point being Lake Assal in Djibouti. The depression covers about , a size comparable with Lake Ontario or twice as large as Lebanon. Due to its size and proximity to the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, studies have been made proposing to flood the area for various usages, such as the potential to generate hydroelectricity there.\nGeography.\nThe Qattara Depression has the shape of a teardrop, with its point facing east and the broad deep area facing southwest. The northern side of the depression is characterised by steep escarpments up to high, marking the edge of the adjacent El Diffa plateau. To the south the depression slopes gently up to the Great Sand Sea.\nWithin the Depression are salt marshes, under the northwestern and northern escarpment edges, and extensive dry lake beds that flood occasionally. The marshes occupy approximately , although wind-blown sands are encroaching in some areas. About a quarter of the region is occupied by dry lakes composed of hard crust and sticky mud. These are occasionally filled with water.\nThe depression was initiated by either wind or fluvial erosion in the late Neogene, but during the Quaternary Period the dominant mechanism was a combination of salt weathering and wind erosion working together. First, the salts break up the depression floor, then the wind blows away the resulting sands. This process is less effective in the eastern part of the depression, due to lower salinity groundwater.\nEcology.\nGroves of umbrella thorn acacia (\"Vachellia tortilis\"), growing in shallow sandy depressions, and \"Phragmites\" swamps represent the only permanent vegetation. The acacia groves vary widely in biodiversity and rely on runoff from rainfall and groundwater to survive. The Moghra Oasis in the northeastern part of the Depression has a brackish lake and a \"Phragmites\" swamp.\nThe southwestern corner of the depression is part of the Siwa Protected Area which protects the wild oasis in and around the Siwa Oasis.\nThe Depression is an important habitat for the cheetah, with the largest number of recent sightings being in areas in the northern, western and northwestern part of the Qattara Depression, including the highly isolated, wild oases of Ain EI Qattara and Ein EI Ghazzalat and numerous acacia groves both inside and outside the depression.\nGazelles (\"Gazella dorcas\" and \"Gazella leptoceros\") also inhabit the Qattara Depression, being an important food source for the cheetah. The largest gazelle population exists in the southwestern part of the Qattara Depression within a vast area of wetlands and soft sand. The area of , includes the wild oases of Hatiyat Tabaghbagh and Hatiyat Umm Kitabain, and is a mosaic of lakes, salt marshes, scrubland, wild palm groves and \"Desmostachya bipinnata\" grassland.\nOther common fauna include the Cape hare (\"Lepus capensis\"), Egyptian jackal (\"Canis aureus hupstar\"), sand fox (\"Vulpes rueppelli\") and more rarely the fennec fox (\"Vulpes zerda\"). Barbary sheep (\"Ammotragus lervia\") were once common here but now they are few in number.\nExtinct species from the area include the scimitar oryx (\"Oryx dammah\"), addax (\"Addax nasomaculatus\") and bubal hartebeest (\"Alcelaphus buselaphus\"). Also the \"Droseridites baculatus\", an extinct plant known only from fossils of its pollen, was found at the Ghazalat-1 Well.\nClimate.\nThe climate of the Qattara Depression is highly arid with annual precipitation between on the northern rim to less than in the south of the depression. The average daily temperature varies between during summer and winter months. The prevailing wind forms a largely bimodal regime with most wind coming from north easterly and westerly directions. This causes the linear dune formations in the Western desert between the Qattara Depression and the Nile valley. Wind speeds peak in March at and minimal in December at .\nThe average wind speed is about . Several days each year in the months March to May khamsin winds blow in from the south and bring extremely high temperatures as well as sand and dust with them.\nLand use.\nThere is one permanent settlement in the Qattara Depression, the Qara Oasis. The oasis is located in the westernmost part of the depression and is inhabited by about 300 people. The Depression is also inhabited by the nomadic Bedouin people and their flocks, with the uninhabited Moghra Oasis being important in times of water scarcity during the dry seasons.\nThe Qattara Depression contains many oil concessions, and several operational oil fields. The drilling companies include Royal Dutch Shell and the Apache Corporation.\nHistory.\nMeasurement.\nThe elevation of the depression was first measured in 1917 by an officer of the British Army leading a light car patrol into the region. The officer took readings of the height of the terrain with an aneroid barometer on behalf of John Ball, who later would also publish on the region. He discovered that the spring Ain EI Qattara lay about below sea level. Because the barometer got lost and the readings were so unexpected, this find had to be verified. During 1924\u201325, Ball again organised a survey party, this time with the sole purpose to triangulate the elevation on a westerly line from Wadi El Natrun. The survey was led by G.F. Walpole who had already distinguished himself by triangulating the terrain across from the Nile to Siwa via Bahariya. He confirmed the earlier readings and proved the presence of a huge area below sea level, with places as deep as below sea level.\nKnowledge about the geology of the Qattara Depression was greatly extended by Ralph Alger Bagnold, a British military commander and explorer, through numerous journeys in the 1920s and 1930s. Most notable was his 1927 journey during which he crossed the depression east to west and visited the oases of Qara and Siwa. Many of these trips used motor vehicles (Ford Model Ts) which used special techniques for driving in desert conditions. These techniques were an important asset of the Long Range Desert Group which Bagnold founded in 1940.\nAfter the discovery of the depression, Ball published the triangulation findings about the region in October 1927 in \"The Geographical Journal\". He also gave the region its name \"Qattara\" after the spring Ain EI Qattara where the first readings were taken. The name literally means \"dripping\" in Arabic. Six years later in 1933, Ball was the first to publish a proposal for flooding the region to generate hydroelectric power in his article \"The Qattara Depression of the Libyan Desert and the possibility of its utilisation for power-production\".\nWorld War II.\nDuring World War II, the depression's presence shaped the First and Second Battles of El Alamein. It was considered impassable by tanks and most other military vehicles because of features such as salt lakes, high cliffs and/or escarpments, and fech fech (very fine powdered sand). The cliffs in particular acted as an edge of the El Alamein battlefield, which meant the Allied forces could not be outflanked to the south. Both Axis and Allied forces built their defences in a line from the Mediterranean Sea to the Qattara Depression. These defences became known as the Devil's gardens, and they are for the most part still there, especially the extensive minefields.\nNo large army units entered the Depression, although German Afrika Korps patrols and the British Long Range Desert Group did operate in the area, since these small units had considerable experience in desert travel. The RAF's repair and salvage units (e.g. 58 RSU) used a route through the depression to salvage or recover aircraft that had landed or crashed in the Western desert away from the coastal plain.\nThe RSUs included six-wheel-drive trucks, Coles cranes, and large trailers, and were particularly active from mid-1941 when Air Vice-Marshal G.G. Dawson arrived in Egypt to address the lack of serviceable aircraft.\nA German communications officer stationed in the depression was cited by Gordon Welchman as being unintentionally helpful in the breaking of the Enigma machine code, due to his regular transmissions stating there was \"nothing to report\".\nQattara Depression Project.\nThe large size of the Qattara Depression and the fact that it falls to a depth of below mean sea level has led to several proposals to create a massive hydroelectric power project in northern Egypt rivalling that of the Aswan High Dam. This project is known as the Qattara Depression Project. The proposals call for a large canal or tunnel being excavated from the Qattara due north of depending on the route chosen to the Mediterranean Sea to bring seawater into the area.\nAn alternative plan involved running a pipeline northeast to the freshwater Nile River at Rosetta. Water would flow into a series of water penstocks which would generate electricity by releasing the water at below sea level. Because the Qattara Depression is in a very hot dry region with very little cloud cover, the water released at the level would spread out from the release point across the basin and evaporate from solar influx. Because of evaporation, more water can flow into the depression, thus forming a continual source of power. Eventually this would result in a hypersaline lake or a salt pan as the water would evaporate and leave behind the salt that it contained.\nPlans to use the Qattara Depression for the generation of electricity date back to 1912 from Berlin geographer Albrecht Penck. The subject was discussed in more detail by Dr. John Ball in 1927, who estimated a hydroelectric potential of 125 to 200 megawatts. In 1957, the American Central Intelligence Agency proposed to President Dwight Eisenhower that peace in the Middle East could be achieved by flooding the Qattara Depression. The resulting lagoon, according to the CIA, would have four benefits:\nIn the 1970s and early 1980s, several proposals to flood the area were made by Friedrich Bassler and the \"Joint Venture Qattara\", a group of mainly German companies. They wanted to make use of peaceful nuclear explosions to construct a tunnel, drastically reducing construction costs compared to conventional methods. This project proposed to use 213 H-bombs, with yields of one to 1.5 megatons, detonated at depths of . That fit within the Atoms for Peace program proposed by US President Dwight Eisenhower in 1953. The Egyptian government turned down the idea.\nPlanning experts and scientists intermittently put forward potentially viable options, whether of a tunnel or canal, as an economic, ecological, and energy solution in Egypt, often coupled with the idea of new settlements.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was launched by CCP chairman Mao Zedong in 1966 and lasted until his death in 1976. Its stated goal was to preserve Chinese communism by purging remnants of capitalist and traditional elements from Chinese society.\nIn May 1966, with the help of the Cultural Revolution Group, Mao launched the Revolution and said that bourgeois elements had infiltrated the government and society with the aim of restoring capitalism. Mao called on young people to bombard the headquarters, and proclaimed that \"to rebel is justified\". Mass upheaval began in Beijing with Red August in 1966. Many young people, mainly students, responded by forming cadres of Red Guards throughout the country. \"Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung\" became revered within his cult of personality. In 1967, emboldened radicals began seizing power from local governments and party branches, establishing new revolutionary committees in their place while smashing public security, procuratorate and judicial systems. These committees often split into rival factions, precipitating armed clashes among the radicals. After the fall of Lin Biao in 1971, the Gang of Four became influential in 1972, and the Revolution continued until Mao's death in 1976, soon followed by the arrest of the Gang of Four.\nThe Cultural Revolution was characterized by violence and chaos across Chinese society. Estimates of the death toll vary widely, typically ranging from 1\u20132 million, including a massacre in Guangxi that included acts of cannibalism, as well as massacres in Beijing, Inner Mongolia, Guangdong, Yunnan, and Hunan. Red Guards sought to destroy the Four Olds (old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits), which often took the form of destroying historical artifacts and cultural and religious sites. Tens of millions were persecuted, including senior officials such as Liu Shaoqi, Deng Xiaoping and Peng Dehuai; millions were persecuted for being members of the Five Black Categories, with intellectuals and scientists labelled as the Stinking Old Ninth. The country's schools and universities were closed, and the National College Entrance Examinations were cancelled. Over 10\u00a0million youth from urban areas were relocated under the Down to the Countryside Movement.\nIn December 1978, Deng Xiaoping became the new paramount leader of China, replacing Mao's successor Hua Guofeng. Deng and his allies introduced the \"Boluan Fanzheng\" program and initiated economic reforms, which, together with the New Enlightenment movement, gradually dismantled the ideology of the Cultural Revolution. In 1981, the Communist Party publicly acknowledged numerous failures of the Cultural Revolution, declaring it \"responsible for the most severe setback and the heaviest losses suffered by the people, the country, and the party since the founding of the People's Republic.\" Given its broad scope and social impact, memories and perspectives of the Cultural Revolution are varied and complex in contemporary China. It is often referred to as the \"ten years of chaos\" () or \"ten years of havoc\" ().\nEtymology.\nThe terminology of cultural revolution appeared in communist party discourses and newspapers prior to the founding of the People's Republic of China. During this period, the term was used interchangeably with \"cultural construction\" and referred to eliminating illiteracy in order to widen public participation in civic matters. This usage of \"cultural revolution\" continued through the 1950s and into the 1960s, and often involved drawing parallels to the May Fourth Movement or the Soviet cultural revolution of 1928\u20131931.\nBackground.\nCreation of the People's Republic.\nOn 1 October 1949, Mao Zedong declared the People's Republic of China, symbolically bringing the decades-long Chinese Civil War to a close. Remaining Republican forces fled to Taiwan and continued to resist the People's Republic in various ways. Many soldiers of the Chinese Republicans were left in mainland China, and Mao Zedong launched the Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries to eliminate these soldiers left behind, as well as elements of Chinese society viewed as potentially dangerous to Mao's new government.\nGreat Leap Forward.\nOn January 11, 1962, an enlarged Central Committee work conference of the CCP was held in Beijing. With over 7,000 participants, it became known as the Seven Thousand Cadres Conference. Liu Shaoqi, Mao Zedong, and others made self-criticisms at the conference. Mao said in the conference that, \"Any mistakes that the Centre has made ought to be my direct responsibility, and I also have an indirect share in the blame because I am the Chairman of the Central Committee. I don't want other people to shirk their responsibility. There are some other comrades who also bear responsibility, but the person primarily responsible should be me.\" He continued: \"If our country does not establish a socialist economy, what kind of situation shall we be in? We shall become a country like Yugoslavia, which has actually become a bourgeois country.\" However, \"during the whole socialist stage there still exist classes and class struggle, and this class struggle is a protracted, complex, sometimes even violent affair.\"\nAfter the meeting, Liu informed the others that \"The errors of the Great Leap Forward were serious, and this is the first time we've summarized the experience. Every year from now on we need to look back and summarize it again.\" Regarding the cannibalism during the Great Leap Forward, he also remarked, \"This will be memorialized as a decree in which the emperor admits his crimes against the people.\" After the Seven Thousand Cadres Conference, Mao Zedong took a backseat in economic matters. However, at the Xilou Conference, Liu Shaoqi still believed that the Seven Thousand Cadres Conference had not sufficiently reflected on the Great Leap Forward.\nIn the first half of 1962, China saw the emergence of a system where individual households were responsible for agricultural output. However, Mao Zedong believed this practice contradicted communism and was something he could not tolerate. In July 1962, Mao Zedong expressed dissatisfaction with Liu Shaoqi, stating: \"The Three Red Banners have been refuted, land is being divided up, and you did nothing? What will happen after I die?\" Liu Shaoqi also argued that \"History will record the role you and I played in the starvation of so many people, and the cannibalism will also be memorialized!\"\nImpact of international tensions and anti-revisionism.\nIn the early 1950s, the PRC and the Soviet Union (USSR) were the world's two largest communist states. Although initially they were mutually supportive, disagreements arose after Nikita Khrushchev took power in the USSR. In 1956, Khrushchev denounced his predecessor Josef Stalin and his policies, and began implementing economic reforms. Mao and many other CCP members opposed these changes, believing that they would damage the worldwide communist movement.\nMao believed that Khrushchev was a revisionist, altering Marxist\u2013Leninist concepts, which Mao claimed would give capitalists control of the USSR. Relations soured. The USSR refused to support China's case for joining the United Nations and reneged on its pledge to supply China with a nuclear weapon.\nMao denounced revisionism in April 1960. Without pointing at the USSR, Mao criticized its Balkan ally, the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. In turn, the USSR criticized China's Balkan ally, the Party of Labour of Albania. In 1963, CCP began to denounce the USSR, publishing nine polemics.\nOther Soviet actions increased concerns about potential fifth columnists. As a result of the tensions following the Sino-Soviet split, Soviet leaders authorized radio broadcasts into China stating that the Soviet Union would assist \"genuine communists\" who overthrew Mao and his \"erroneous course\". Chinese leadership also feared the increasing military conflict between the United States and North Vietnam, concerned that China's support would lead the United States to seek out potential Chinese assets.\nMao contended that capitalist tendencies had begun to grow in China.151 He viewed the Cultural Revolution as perpetual revolution aimed at opposing \"representatives of the bourgeoisie and counterrevolutionary revisionists\" who had \"sneaked into the party, the government, the army, and cultural circles.\"\nThe meaning and nature of revolution was a frequent theme in the speeches of central leadership during the Cultural Revolution.71 They contended that the Cultural Revolution was an unprecedented event that had to be carried out by the people rather than directed from above and that the best test was revolutionary practice.71 Tao Zhu stated:71\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;You can't say you are the true revolutionaries and they are fake. This is mass organizing. Their organizations may also be revolutionary. You may have a revolutionary competition. Good ones will grow, bad ones will collapse ... True or fake revolutionaries will be distinguished in revolutionary practice.\nSocialist Education Movement and \"Hai Rui Dismissed from Office\".\nIn 1963, Mao launched the Socialist Education Movement. Mao set the scene by \"cleansing\" powerful Beijing officials of questionable loyalty. His approach was executed via newspaper articles, internal meetings, and by his network of political allies.\nIn late 1959, historian and deputy mayor of Beijing Wu Han published a historical drama entitled \"Hai Rui Dismissed from Office\". In the play, an honest civil servant, Hai Rui, is dismissed by a corrupt emperor. While Mao initially praised the play, in February 1965, he secretly commissioned Jiang Qing and Yao Wenyuan to publish an article criticizing it. Yao described the play as an allegory attacking Mao; flagging Mao as the emperor, and Peng Dehuai, who had previously questioned Mao during the Lushan Conference, as the honest civil servant.\nYao's article put Beijing mayor Peng Zhen on the defensive. Peng, Wu Han's direct superior, was the head of the Five Man Group, a committee commissioned by Mao to study the potential for a cultural revolution. Peng Zhen, aware that he would be implicated if Wu indeed wrote an \"anti-Mao\" play, wished to contain Yao's influence. Yao's article was initially published only in select local newspapers. Peng forbade its publication in the nationally distributed \"People's Daily\" and other major newspapers under his control, and not pay heed to Yao's petty politics. While the \"literary battle\" against Peng raged, Mao fired Yang Shangkun\u2014director of the party's General Office, an organ that controlled internal communications\u2014making unsubstantiated charges. He installed loyalist Wang Dongxing, head of Mao's security detail. Yang's dismissal likely emboldened Mao's allies to move against their factional rivals.\nOn 12 February 1966, the \"Five Man Group\" issued a report known as the \"February Outline\". The \"Outline\" as sanctioned by the party center defined \"Hai Rui\" as a constructive \"academic\" discussion and aimed to distance Peng Zhen formally from any \"political\" implications. However, Jiang Qing and Yao Wenyuan continued their denunciations. Meanwhile, Mao sacked Propaganda Department director Lu Dingyi, a Peng ally.\nLu's removal gave Maoists unrestricted access to the press. Mao delivered his final blow to Peng at a high-profile Politburo meeting through loyalists Kang Sheng and Chen Boda. They accused Peng of opposing Mao, labeled the \"February Outline\" \"evidence of Peng Zhen's revisionism\", and grouped him with three other disgraced officials as part of the \"Peng-Luo-Lu-Yang Anti-Party Clique\". On 16 May, the Politburo formalized the decisions by releasing an official document condemning Peng and his \"anti-party allies\" in the strongest terms, disbanding his \"Five Man Group\", and replacing it with the Maoist Cultural Revolution Group (CRG).\n1966: Outbreak.\nThe Cultural Revolution can be divided into two main periods:\nThe early phase was characterized by mass movement and political pluralization. Virtually anyone could create a political organization, even without party approval. Known as Red Guards, these organizations originally arose in schools and universities and later in factories and other institutions. After 1968, most of these organizations ceased to exist, although their legacies were a topic of controversy later.\nNotification.\nIn May 1966, an expanded session of the Politburo was called in Beijing. The conference was laden with Maoist political rhetoric on class struggle and filled with meticulously prepared 'indictments' of recently ousted leaders such as Peng Zhen and Luo Ruiqing. One of these documents, distributed on 16 May, was prepared with Mao's personal supervision and was particularly damning:\nThose representatives of the bourgeoisie who have sneaked into the Party, the government, the army, and various spheres of culture are a bunch of counter-revolutionary revisionists. Once conditions are ripe, they will seize political power and turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. Some of them we have already seen through; others we have not. Some are still trusted by us and are being trained as our successors, persons like Khrushchev for example, who are still nestling beside us.47\nLater known as the \"16 May Notification\", this document summarized Mao's ideological justification for CR.40 Initially kept secret, distributed only among high-ranking party members, it was later declassified and published in \"People's Daily\" on 17 May 1967.41 Effectively it implied that enemies of the Communist cause could be found within the Party: class enemies who \"wave the red flag to oppose the red flag.\" The only way to identify these people was through \"the telescope and microscope of Mao Zedong Thought.\"46 While the party leadership was relatively united in approving Mao's agenda, many Politburo members were not enthusiastic, or simply confused about the direction. The charges against party leaders such as Peng disturbed China's intellectual community and the eight non-Communist parties.41\nMass rallies (May\u2013June).\nAfter the purge of Peng Zhen, the Beijing Party Committee effectively ceased to function, paving the way for disorder in the capital. On 25 May, under the guidance of Cao Yi'ou\u2014wife of Mao loyalist Kang Sheng\u2014Nie Yuanzi, a philosophy lecturer at Peking University, authored a big-character poster along with other leftists and posted it to a public bulletin. Nie attacked the university's party administration and its leader Lu Ping. Nie insinuated that the university leadership, much like Peng, were trying to contain revolutionary fervor in a \"sinister\" attempt to oppose the party and advance revisionism.\nMao promptly endorsed Nie's poster as \"the first Marxist big-character poster in China\". Approved by Mao, the poster rippled across educational institutions. Students began to revolt against their school's party establishments. Classes were cancelled in Beijing primary and secondary schools, followed by a decision on 13 June to expand the class suspension nationwide. By early June, throngs of young demonstrators lined the capital's major thoroughfares holding giant portraits of Mao, beating drums, and shouting slogans.\nWhen the dismissal of Peng and the municipal party leadership became public in early June, confusion was widespread. The public and foreign missions were kept in the dark on the reason for Peng's ousting. Top Party leadership was caught off guard by the sudden protest wave and struggled with how to respond. After seeking Mao's guidance in Hangzhou, Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping decided to send in 'work teams'\u2014effectively 'ideological guidance' squads of cadres\u2014to the city's schools and \"People's Daily\" to restore some semblance of order and re-establish party control.\nThe work teams had a poor understanding of student sentiment. Unlike the political movement of the 1950s that squarely targeted intellectuals, the new movement was focused on established party cadres, many of whom were part of the work teams. As a result, the work teams came under increasing suspicion as thwarting revolutionary fervor. Party leadership subsequently became divided over whether or not work teams should continue. Liu Shaoqi insisted on continuing work-team involvement and suppressing the movement's most radical elements, fearing that the movement would spin out of control.\n\"Bombard the Headquarters\" (July).\nIn July, Mao, in Wuhan, crossed the Yangtze River, showing his vigor. He then returned from Wuhan to Beijing and criticized party leadership for its handling of the work-teams issue. Mao accused the work teams of undermining the student movement, calling for their full withdrawal on 24 July. Several days later a rally was held at the Great Hall of the People to announce the decision and reveal the tone of the movement to teachers and students. At the rally, Party leaders encouraged the masses to 'not be afraid' and take charge of the movement, free of Party interference.\nThe work-teams issue marked a decisive defeat for Liu; it also signaled that disagreement over how to handle the CR's unfolding events would irreversibly split Mao from the party leadership. On 1 August, the Eleventh Plenum of the 8th Central Committee was convened to advance Mao's radical agenda. At the plenum, Mao showed disdain for Liu, repeatedly interrupting him as he delivered his opening day speech.\nOn 28 July, Red Guard representatives wrote to Mao, calling for rebellion and upheaval to safeguard the revolution. Mao then responded to the letters by writing his own big-character poster entitled \"Bombard the Headquarters\", rallying people to target the \"command centre (i.e., Headquarters) of counterrevolution.\" Mao wrote that despite having undergone a communist revolution, a \"bourgeois\" elite was still thriving in \"positions of authority\" in the government and Party.\nThis statement has been interpreted as a direct indictment of the party establishment under Liu and Deng\u2014the purported \"bourgeois headquarters\" of China. The personnel changes at the Plenum reflected a radical re-design of the party hierarchy. Liu and Deng kept their seats on the Politburo Standing Committee, but were sidelined from day-to-day party affairs. Lin Biao was elevated to become the CCP's number-two; Liu's rank went from second to eighth and was no longer Mao's heir apparent.\nAlong with the top leadership losing power the entire national Party bureaucracy was purged. The extensive Organization Department, in charge of party personnel, virtually ceased to exist. The top officials in the Propaganda Department were sacked, with many of its functions folded into the CRG.\nRed August and the Sixteen Points.\n\"Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung\" led the Red Guards to commit to their objective as China's future. By December 1967, 350 million copies had been printed.\nDuring the Red August of Beijing, on 8 August 1966, the party's General Committee passed its \"Decision Concerning the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution,\" later to be known as the \"Sixteen Points\". This decision defined the Cultural Revolution as \"a great revolution that touches people to their very souls and constitutes a new stage in the development of the socialist revolution in our country:\"\nAlthough the bourgeoisie has been overthrown, it is still trying to use the old ideas, culture, customs and habits of the exploiting classes to corrupt the masses, capture their minds and endeavour to stage a comeback. The proletariat must do the exact opposite: it must meet head-on every challenge of the bourgeoisie\u00a0... to change the mental outlook of the whole of society. At present, our objective is to struggle against and overthrow those persons in authority who are taking the capitalist road, to criticize and repudiate the reactionary bourgeois academic \"authorities\" and the ideology of the bourgeoisie and all other exploiting classes and to transform education, literature and art and all other parts of the superstructure not in correspondence with the socialist economic base, so as to facilitate the consolidation and development of the socialist system.\nThe implications of the Sixteen Points were far-reaching. It elevated what was previously a student movement to a nationwide mass campaign that would galvanize workers, farmers, soldiers and lower-level party functionaries to rise, challenge authority, and re-shape the superstructure of society.\nOn 18 August in Beijing, over a million Red Guards from across the country gathered in and around Tiananmen Square for an audience with the chairman. Mao mingled with Red Guards and encouraged them, donning a Red Guard armband. Lin also took centre stage, denouncing perceived enemies in society that were impeding the \"progress of the revolution\". Subsequently, violence escalated in Beijing and quickly spread. The 18 August rally was filmed and shown to approximately 100 million people in its first month of release.\nOn 22 August, a central directive was issued to prevent police intervention in Red Guard activities, and those in the police force who defied this notice were labeled counter-revolutionaries. Central officials lifted restraints on violent behavior. Xie Fuzhi, the national police chief, often pardoned Red Guards for their \"crimes\".\nThe campaign included incidents of torture, murder, and public humiliation. Many people who were indicted as counter-revolutionaries died by suicide. During Red August, 1,772 people were murdered in Beijing; many of the victims were teachers who were attacked or killed by their own students. In September, Shanghai experienced 704 suicides and 534 deaths; in Wuhan, 62 suicides and 32 murders occurred during the same period. Peng Dehuai was brought to Beijing to be publicly ridiculed.\nDestruction of the Four Olds (August\u2013November).\nBetween August and November 1966, eight mass rallies were held, drawing in 12\u00a0million people, most of whom were Red Guards. To aid Red Guards in traveling, the Great Exchange of Revolutionary Experience program, which lasted from September 1966 to early 1967, gave them free food and lodging throughout the country.\nAt the rallies, Lin called for the destruction of the Four Olds; namely, old customs, culture, habits, and ideas.146 Some changes associated with the Four Olds campaign were mainly benign, such as assigning new names to city streets, places, and even people; millions of babies were born with \"revolutionary\" names.\nOther aspects were more destructive, particularly in the realms of culture and religion. Historical sites throughout the country were destroyed. The damage was particularly pronounced in the capital, Beijing. Red Guards laid siege to the Temple of Confucius in Qufu, and other historically significant tombs and artifacts.\nLibraries of historical and foreign texts were destroyed; books were burned. Temples, churches, mosques, monasteries, and cemeteries were closed and sometimes converted to other uses, or looted and destroyed. Marxist propaganda depicted Buddhism as superstition, and religion was looked upon as a means of hostile foreign infiltration, as well as an instrument of the ruling class. Clergy were arrested and sent to camps; many Tibetan Buddhists were forced to participate in the destruction of their monasteries at gunpoint.\nIn September 1966, central Party authorities under Zhou Enlai issued the \"Instructions on Grasping Revolution, Promoting Production\", which directed that \"one must grasp revolution on one hand and promote production on the other hand.251\nCentral Work Conference (October).\nIn October 1966, Mao convened a Central Work Conference, mostly to enlist party leaders who had not yet adopted the latest ideology. Liu and Deng were prosecuted and begrudgingly offered self-criticism. After the conference, Liu, once a powerful moderate pundit, was placed under house arrest, then sent to a detention camp, where he was denied medical treatment and died in 1969. Deng was sent away for a period of re-education three times and was eventually sent to work in an engine factory in Jiangxi. Rebellion by party cadres accelerated after the conference.\nEnd of the year.\nOn 5 October, the Central Military Commission and the PLA's Department of General Political Tasks directed military academies to dismiss their classes to allow cadets to become more involved in the Cultural Revolution.147 In doing so, they were acting on Lin Biao's 23 August 1966 for \"three month turmoil\" in the PLA.147\nIn Macau, rioting broke out during the 12-3 incident. The event was prompted by the colonial government's delays in approving a new wing for a CCP elementary school in Taipa. The school board illegally began construction, but the colonial government sent police to stop the workers. Several people were injured in the resulting melee. On December 3, 1966, two days of rioting occurred in which hundreds were injured and six to eight were killed, leading to a total clampdown by the Portuguese government. The event set in motion Portugal's de facto abdication of control over Macau, putting Macau on the path to eventual absorption by China.\nBy the beginning of 1967, a wide variety of grassroots political organizations had formed. Beyond Red Guard and student rebel groups, these included poor peasant associations, workers' pickets, and Mao Zedong Thought study societies, among others. Communist Party leaders encouraged these groups to \"join up\", and these groups joined various coalitions and held various cross-group congresses and assemblies.\n1967: Seizure of power.\nMass organizations coalesced into two factions, the radicals who backed Mao's purge of the Communist party, and the conservatives who backed the moderate party establishment. The \"support the left\" policy was established in January 1967. Mao's policy was to support the rebels in seizing power; it required the PLA to support \"the broad masses of the revolutionary leftists in their struggle to seize power.\"\nIn March 1967, the policy was adapted into the \"Three Supports and Two Militaries\" initiative, in which PLA troops were sent to schools and work units across the country to stabilize political tumult and end factional warfare. The three \"Supports\" were to \"support the left\", \"support the interior\", \"support industry\". The \"two Militaries\" referred to \"military management\" and \"military training\". The policy of supporting the left failed to define \"leftists\" at a time when almost all mass organizations claimed to be \"leftist\" or \"revolutionary\". PLA commanders had developed close working relations with the party establishment, leading many military units to repress radicals.\nSpurred by the events in Beijing, power seizure groups formed across the country and began expanding into factories and the countryside. In Shanghai, a young factory worker named Wang Hongwen organized a far-reaching revolutionary coalition, one that displaced existing Red Guard groups. On 3 January 1967, with support from CRG heavyweights Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan, the group of firebrand activists overthrew the Shanghai municipal government under Chen Pixian in what became known as the January Storm, and formed in its place the Shanghai People's Commune. Mao then expressed his approval.\nShanghai's was the first provincial level government overthrown. Provincial governments and many parts of the state and party bureaucracy were affected, with power seizures taking place. In the next three weeks, 24 more province-level governments were overthrown. \"Revolutionary committees\" were subsequently established, in place of local governments and branches of the Communist Party. For example, in Beijing, three separate revolutionary groups declared power seizures on the same day. In Heilongjiang, local party secretary Pan Fusheng seized power from the party organization under his own leadership. Some leaders even wrote to the CRG asking to be overthrown.\nIn Beijing, Jiang Qing and Zhang Chunqiao targeted Vice-Premier Tao Zhu. The power-seizure movement was appearing in the military as well. In February, prominent generals Ye Jianying and Chen Yi, as well as Vice-Premier Tan Zhenlin, vocally asserted their opposition to the more extreme aspects of the movement, with some party elders insinuating that the CRG's real motives were to remove the revolutionary old guard. Mao, initially ambivalent, took to the Politburo floor on 18 February to denounce the opposition directly, endorsing the radicals' activities. This resistance was branded the February Countercurrent\u2014effectively silencing critics within the party.\nAlthough in early 1967 popular insurgencies were limited outside of the biggest cities, local governments began collapsing all across China. Revolutionaries dismantled ruling government and party organizations, because power seizures lacked centralized leadership, it was no longer clear who believed in Mao's revolutionary vision and who was exploiting the chaos for their own gain. The formation of rival revolutionary groups and manifestations of long-established local feuds, led to violent struggles between factions.\nTension grew between mass organizations and the military. In response, Lin Biao issued a directive for the army to aid the radicals. At the same time, the army took control of some provinces and locales that were deemed incapable of handling the power transition.\nIn Wuhan, as in many other cities, two major revolutionary organizations emerged, one supporting and one attacking the conservative establishment. Chen Zaidao, the Army general in charge of the area, forcibly repressed the anti-establishment demonstrators. Mao flew to Wuhan with a large entourage of central officials in an attempt to secure military loyalty in the area. On 20 July 1967, local agitators in response kidnapped Mao's emissary Wang Li, in what became known as the Wuhan Incident. Subsequently, Chen was sent to Beijing and tried by Jiang Qing and the rest of the CRG. Chen's resistance was the last major open display of opposition within the PLA.\nThe Gang of Four's Zhang Chunqiao admitted that the most crucial factor in the Cultural Revolution was not the Red Guards or the CRG or the \"rebel worker\" organisations, but the PLA. When the PLA local garrison supported Mao's radicals, they were able to take over the local government successfully, but if they were not cooperative, the takeovers were unsuccessful. Violent clashes occurred in virtually all major cities.\nIn response to the Wuhan Incident, Mao and Jiang began establishing a \"workers' armed self-defense force\", a \"revolutionary armed force of mass character\" to counter what he saw as rightism in \"75% of the PLA officer corps\". Meanwhile, a massive movement to \"smash gong-jian-fa\", or to smash the Police, the Procuratorate and the Court, was carried out in mainland China. The few remaining going-jian-fa organizations were later placed under military control.\nIn Chongqing, factional violence was particularly pronounced.178 Violence there was exacerbated because the city had a concentration of munitions factories.336 Violence in Chongqing occurred primarily between two different rebel factions during the period 16 May 1967 to 15 October 1968. Among the major instances of combat there was the 25 July Incident in 1967, during which members of one rebel faction attacked four hundred members of other factions using knives, pistols, rifles, submachine guns, and machine guns, killing ten.64 \nUnconventional weapons, including weapon of mass destruction, were seized during conflicts, but not directly used. Citizens wrote letters to the Zhongnanhai residence of government leaders, warning of attacks on facilities that stored pathogenic bacteria, poisonous plant samples, radioactive substances, poison gas, toxicants, and other dangerous substances. In Changchun, rebels working in geological institutes developed and tested a dirty bomb, a crude radiological weapon, testing two \"radioactive self-defense bombs\" and two \"radioactive self-defense mines\" on 6 and 11 August. \nViolence in 1967 disrupted economic activity and touring Red Guards overburdened China's transportation system. By year end, national industrial output had decreased by 13.8% from the previous year.252\nMilitary control was imposed over the Daqing Oil Field in March 1967 and over the Anshan Iron and Steel Plant in August.\nNationwide, a total of 18.77\u00a0million firearms, 14,828 artillery pieces, 2,719,545 grenades ended up in civilian hands. They were used in the course of violent struggles, which mostly took place from 1967 to 1968. In Chongqing, Xiamen, and Changchun, tanks, armored vehicles and even warships were deployed in combat.\nIn late 1967, the PLA became the most powerful political force in the country.253 In 1967 and 1968, rebel groups supported by the PLA established Revolutionary Committees that replaced government and existing Party organizations at the local and provincial levels.253\nDuring the Cultural Revolution, Mao emphasized the need to improve medical care in rural China.270 The Rural Cooperative Medical System (RCMS) developed in the late 1960s.270 In this system, each large production brigade established a medical cooperative station staffed by barefoot doctors.270 The medical cooperative stations provided primary health care.270 Barefoot doctors brought healthcare to rural areas where urban-trained doctors would not settle. They promoted basic hygiene, preventive healthcare, and family planning and treated common illnesses. Immunizations were provided free of charge.9 Public healthcare was highly effective in curbing infectious diseases in rural China.9 For treatment of major diseases, rural people traveled to state-owned hospitals.270\n1968: Purges.\nIn May 1968, Mao launched a massive political purge. Many people were sent to the countryside to work in reeducation camps. Generally, the campaign targeted rebels from the CR's earlier, more populist, phase. On 27 July, the Red Guards' power over the PLA was officially ended, and the establishment sent in units to besiege areas that remained untouched by the Guards. A year later, the Red Guard factions were dismantled entirely; Mao predicted that the chaos might begin running its own agenda and be tempted to turn against revolutionary ideology. Their purpose had been largely fulfilled; Mao and his radical colleagues had largely overturned established power.\nLiu was expelled from the CCP at the 12th Plenum of the 8th Central Committee in September, and labelled the \"headquarters of the bourgeoisie\".\nMao meets with Red Guard leaders (July).\nAs the Red Guard movement had waned over the preceding year, violence by the remaining Red Guards increased on some Beijing campuses. Violence was particularly pronounced at Tsinghua University, where a few thousand hardliners of two factions continued to fight. At Mao's initiative, on 27 July 1968, tens of thousands of workers entered the Tsinghua campus shouting slogans in opposition to the violence. Red Guards attacked the workers, who remained peaceful. Ultimately, the workers disarmed the students and occupied the campus.\nOn 28 July, Mao and the Central Group met with the five most important remaining Beijing Red Guard leaders to address the movement's excessive violence and political exhaustion. It was the only time during the Cultural Revolution that Mao met and addressed the student leaders directly. In response to a Red Guard leader's telegram sent prior to the meeting, which claimed that some \"Black Hand\" had maneuvered the workers against the Red Guards, Mao told the student leaders, \"The Black Hand is nobody else but me! ... I asked [the workers] how to solve the armed fighting in the universities, and told them to go there to have a look.\"\nDuring the meeting, Mao and the Central Group for the Cultural Revolution stated, \"[W]e want cultural struggle, we do not want armed struggle\" and \"The masses do not want civil war.\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;You have been involved in the Cultural Revolution for two years: struggle-criticism-transformation. Now, first, you're not struggling; second, you're not criticizing; and third, you're not transforming. Or rather, you are struggling, but it's an armed struggle. The people are not happy, the workers are not happy, city residents are not happy, most people in schools are not happy, most of the students even in your schools are not happy. Even within the faction that supports you, there are unhappy people. Is this the way to unify the world?\nMao's cult of personality and \"mango fever\" (August).\nIn the spring of 1968, a massive campaign aimed at enhancing Mao's reputation began. On 4 August, Mao was presented with mangoes by the Pakistani foreign minister Syed Sharifuddin Pirzada, in an apparent diplomatic gesture. Mao had his aide send the box of mangoes to his propaganda team at Tsinghua University on 5 August, who were stationed there to quiet strife among Red Guard factions.\nSeveral months of \"mango fever\" followed as the fruit became a focus of a \"boundless loyalty\" campaign for Mao. More replica mangoes were created, and the replicas were sent on tour around Beijing and elsewhere. Many revolutionary committees visited the mangoes in Beijing from outlying provinces. Approximately half a million people greeted the replicas when they arrived in Chengdu. Badges and wall posters featuring the mangoes and Mao were produced in the millions.\nThe fruit was shared among all institutions that had been a part of the propaganda team, and large processions were organized in support of the \"precious gift\", as the mangoes were known.\nIt has been claimed that Mao used the mangoes to express support for the workers who would go to whatever lengths necessary to end the factional fighting among students, and a \"prime example of Mao's strategy of symbolic support.\" Through early 1969, participants of Mao Zedong Thought study classes in Beijing returned with mass-produced mango facsimiles, gaining media attention in the provinces.\nDown to the Countryside Movement (December).\nIn December 1968, Mao began the Down to the Countryside Movement. During this movement, which lasted for the following decade, young bourgeoisie living in cities were ordered to go to the countryside to experience working life. The term \"young intellectuals\" was used to refer to recent college graduates. In the late 1970s, these students returned to their home cities. Many students who were previously Red Guard supported the movement and Mao's vision. This movement was thus in part a means of moving Red Guards from the cities to the countryside, where they would cause less social disruption. It also served to spread revolutionary ideology geographically.\n1969\u20131971: Lin Biao.\nThe 9th National Congress was held in April 1969. It served as a means to \"revitalize\" the party with fresh thinking\u2014as well as new cadres, after much of the old guard had been destroyed in the struggles of the preceding years. The party framework established two decades earlier broke down almost entirely: rather than through an election by party members, delegates for this Congress were effectively selected by Revolutionary Committees. Representation of the military increased by a large margin from the previous Congress, reflected in the election of more PLA members to the new Central Committee\u2014over 28%. Many officers now elevated to senior positions were loyal to PLA Marshal Lin Biao, which would open a new rift between the military and civilian leadership.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWe do not only feel boundless joy because we have as our great leader the greatest Marxist\u2013Leninist of our era, Chairman Mao, but also great joy because we have Vice Chairman Lin as Chairman Mao's universally recognized successor.\n\u2014 Premier Zhou Enlai at the 9th Party Congress\nReflecting this, Lin was officially elevated to become the Party's preeminent figure outside of Mao, with his name written into the party constitution as his \"closest comrade-in-arms\" and \"universally recognized successor\". At the time, no other Communist parties or governments anywhere in the world had adopted the practice of enshrining a successor to the current leader into their constitutions. Lin delivered the keynote address at the Congress: a document drafted by hardliner leftists Yao Wenyuan and Zhang Chunqiao under Mao's guidance.\nThe report was heavily critical of Liu Shaoqi and other \"counter-revolutionaries\" and drew extensively from quotations in the \"Little Red Book\". The Congress solidified the central role of Maoism within the party, re-introducing Maoism as the official guiding ideology in the party constitution. The Congress elected a new Politburo with Mao, Lin, Chen, Zhou Enlai and Kang as the members of the new Politburo Standing Committee.\nLin, Chen, and Kang were all beneficiaries of the Cultural Revolution. Zhou, who was demoted in rank, voiced his unequivocal support for Lin at the Congress. Mao restored the function of some formal party institutions, such as the operations of the Politburo, which ceased functioning between 1966 and 1968 because the CCRG held de facto control.\nIn early 1970, the nationwide \"One Strike-Three Anti Campaign\" was launched by Mao and the Communist Party Central, aiming to consolidate the new organs of power by targeting counterrevolutionary thoughts and actions. A large number of \"minor criminals\" were executed or forced to commit suicide between 1970 and 1972. According to government statistics released after the Cultural Revolution, during the campaign 1.87 million people were persecuted as traitors, spies, and counterrevolutionaries, and over 284,800 were arrested or killed from February to November 1970 alone.\nPLA encroachment.\nMao's efforts at re-organizing party and state institutions generated mixed results. The situation in some of the provinces remained volatile, even as the political situation in Beijing stabilized. Factional struggles, many violent, continued at a local level despite the declaration that the 9th National Congress marked a temporary victory for the CR. Furthermore, despite Mao's efforts to put on a show of unity at the Congress, the factional divide between Lin's PLA camp and the Jiang-led radical camp was intensifying. Indeed, a personal dislike of Jiang drew many civilian leaders, including Chen, closer to Lin.\nBetween 1966 and 1968, China was isolated internationally, having declared its enmity towards both the USSR and the US. The friction with the USSR intensified after border clashes on the Ussuri River in March 1969 as Chinese leaders prepared for all-out war. In June 1969, the PLA's enforcement of political discipline and suppression of the factions that had emerged during the Cultural Revolution became intertwined with the central Party's efforts to accelerate Third Front. Those who did not return to work would be viewed as engaging in 'schismatic activity' which risked undermining preparations to defend China from potential invasion.\nIn October 1969, the Party attempted to focus more on war preparedness and less on suppressing factions. That month, senior leaders were evacuated from Beijing. Amid the tension, Lin issued the \"Order Number One\", which appeared to be an executive order to prepare for war to the PLA's eleven military regions on October 18 without going through Mao. This drew the ire of the chairman, who saw it as evidence that his declared successor was usurping his authority.\nThe prospect of war elevated the PLA to greater prominence in domestic politics, increasing Lin's stature at Mao's expense. Some evidence suggests that Mao was pushed to seek closer relations with the US as a means to avoid PLA dominance that would result from a military confrontation with the Soviet Union. During his later meeting with Richard Nixon in 1972, Mao hinted that Lin had opposed better relations with the U.S.\nRestoration of State Chairman position.\nAfter Lin was confirmed as Mao's successor, his supporters focused on the restoration of the position of State Chairman, which had been abolished by Mao after Liu's purge. They hoped that by allowing Lin to ease into a constitutionally sanctioned role, whether Chairman or vice-chairman, Lin's succession would be institutionalized. The consensus within the Politburo was that Mao should assume the office with Lin as vice-chairman; but perhaps wary of Lin's ambitions or for other unknown reasons, Mao voiced his explicit opposition.\nFactional rivalries intensified at the Second Plenum of the Ninth Congress in Lushan held in late August 1970. Chen, now aligned with the PLA faction loyal to Lin, galvanized support for the restoration of the office of President of China, despite Mao's wishes. Moreover, Chen launched an assault on Zhang, a staunch Maoist who embodied the chaos of the Cultural Revolution, over the evaluation of Mao's legacy.\nThe attacks on Zhang found favour with many Plenum attendees and may have been construed by Mao as an indirect attack on the CR. Mao confronted Chen openly, denouncing him as a \"false Marxist\", and removed him from the Politburo Standing Committee. In addition to the purge of Chen, Mao asked Lin's principal generals to write self-criticisms on their political positions as a warning to Lin. Mao also inducted several of his supporters to the Central Military Commission and placed loyalists in leadership roles of the Beijing Military Region.\nProject 571.\nBy 1971, the diverging interests of the civilian and military leaders was apparent. Mao was troubled by the PLA's newfound prominence, and the purge of Chen marked the beginning of a gradual scaling-down of the PLA's political involvement. According to official sources, sensing the reduction of Lin's power base and his declining health, Lin's supporters plotted to use the military power still at their disposal to oust Mao in a coup.\nLin's son Lin Liguo, along with other high-ranking military conspirators, formed a coup apparatus in Shanghai and dubbed the plan to oust Mao \"Outline for Project 571\"\u00a0\u2013 in the original Mandarin, the phrase sounds similar to the term for 'military uprising'. It is disputed whether Lin Biao was directly involved in this process. While official sources maintain that Lin did plan and execute the coup attempt, scholars such as Jin Qiu portray Lin as passive, cajoled by elements among his family and supporters. Qiu contests that Lin Biao was ever personally involved in drafting the \"Outline\", with evidence suggesting that Lin Liguo was directly responsible for the draft.\nLin's flight and plane crash.\nAccording to the official narrative, on 13 September Lin Biao, his wife Ye Qun, Lin Liguo, and members of his staff attempted to flee to the USSR ostensibly to seek political asylum. En route, Lin's plane crashed in Mongolia, killing all on board. The plane apparently ran out of fuel. A Soviet investigative team was not able to determine the cause of the crash but hypothesized that the pilot was flying low to evade radar and misjudged the plane's altitude.\nThe account was questioned by those who raised doubts over Lin's choice of the USSR as a destination, the plane's route, the identity of the passengers, and whether or not a coup was actually taking place.\nOn 13 September, the Politburo met in an emergency session to discuss Lin. His death was confirmed in Beijing only on 30 September, which led to the cancellation of the National Day celebration events the following day. The Central Committee did not release news of Lin's death to the public until two months later. Many Lin supporters sought refuge in Hong Kong. Those who remained on the mainland were purged.\nThe event caught the party leadership off guard: the concept that Lin could betray Mao de-legitimized a vast body of Cultural Revolution political rhetoric and by extension, Mao's absolute authority. For several months following the incident, the party information apparatus struggled to find a \"correct way\" to frame the incident for public consumption, but as the details came to light, the majority of the Chinese public felt disillusioned and realised they had been manipulated for political purposes.\n1972\u20131976: The Gang of Four.\nMao became depressed and reclusive after the Lin incident. Sensing a sudden loss of direction, Mao reached out to old comrades whom he had denounced in the past. Meanwhile, in September 1972, Mao transferred a 38-year-old cadre from Shanghai, Wang Hongwen, to Beijing and made him Party vice-chairman. Wang, a former factory worker from a peasant background, was seemingly getting groomed for succession.\nJiang's position strengthened after Lin's flight. She held tremendous influence with the radical camp. With Mao's health on the decline, Jiang's political ambitions began to emerge. She allied herself with Wang and propaganda specialists Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan, forming a political clique later pejoratively dubbed as the Gang of Four.\nBy 1973, round after round of political struggles had left many lower-level institutions, including local government, factories, and railways, short of competent staff to carry out basic functions. China's economy had fallen into disarray, which led to the rehabilitation of purged lower-level officials. The party's core became heavily dominated by Cultural Revolution beneficiaries and radicals, whose focus remained ideological purity over economic productivity. The economy remained mostly Zhou's domain, one of the few remaining moderates. Zhou attempted to restore the economy, but was resented by the Gang of Four, who identified him as their primary political succession threat.\nIn late 1973, to weaken Zhou's political position and to distance themselves from Lin's apparent betrayal, the Criticize Lin, Criticize Confucius campaign began under Jiang's leadership. Its stated goals were to purge China of New Confucianist thinking and denounce Lin's actions as traitorous and regressive.\nDeng Xiaoping's rehabilitation (1975).\nDeng Xiaoping returned to the political scene, assuming the post of Vice-Premier in March 1973, in the first of a series of Mao-approved promotions. After Zhou withdrew from active politics in January 1975, Deng was effectively put in charge of the government, party, and military, then adding the additional titles of PLA General Chief of Staff, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, and vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission.\nMao wanted to use Deng as a counterweight to the military faction in government to suppress former Lin loyalists. In addition, Mao had also lost confidence in the Gang of Four and saw Deng as the alternative. Leaving the country in grinding poverty would damage the positive legacy of the CR, which Mao worked hard to protect. Deng's return set the scene for a protracted factional struggle between the radical Gang of Four and moderates led by Zhou and Deng.\nAt the time, Jiang and associates held effective control of mass media and the party's propaganda network, while Zhou and Deng held control of most government organs. On some decisions, Mao sought to mitigate the Gang's influence, but on others, he acquiesced to their demands. The Gang of Four's political and media control did not prevent Deng from enacting his economic policies. Deng emphatically opposed Party factionalism, and his policies aimed to promote unity to restore economic productivity. Much like the post-Great Leap restructuring led by Liu Shaoqi, Deng streamlined the railway system, steel production, etc. By late 1975, however, Mao saw that Deng's economic restructuring might negate the CR's legacy and launched the Counterattack the Right-Deviationist Reversal-of-Verdicts Trend, a campaign to oppose \"rehabilitating the case for the rightists\", alluding to Deng as the country's foremost \"rightist\". Mao directed Deng to write self-criticisms in November 1975, a move lauded by the Gang of Four.\nDeath of Zhou Enlai.\nOn 8 January 1976, Zhou Enlai died of bladder cancer. On 15 January, Deng delivered Zhou's eulogy in a funeral attended by all of China's most senior leaders with the notable absence of Mao, who had grown increasingly critical of Zhou. After Zhou's death, Mao selected the relatively unknown Hua Guofeng instead of a member of the Gang of Four or Deng to become Premier.\nThe Gang of Four grew apprehensive that spontaneous, large-scale popular support for Zhou could turn the political tide against them. They acted through the media to impose restrictions on public displays of mourning for Zhou. Years of resentment over the CR, the public persecution of Deng\u2014seen as Zhou's ally\u2014and the prohibition against public mourning led to a rise in popular discontent against Mao and the Gang of Four. Official attempts to enforce the mourning restrictions included removing public memorials and tearing down posters commemorating Zhou's achievements. On 25 March 1976, Shanghai's \"Wen Hui Bao\" published an article calling Zhou \"the capitalist roader inside the Party [who] wanted to help the unrepentant capitalist roader [Deng] regain his power.\" These propaganda efforts at smearing Zhou's image, however, only strengthened public attachment to Zhou's memory.\nTiananmen incident.\nOn 4 April 1976, on the eve of China's annual Qingming Festival, a traditional day of mourning, thousands of people gathered around the Monument to the People's Heroes in Tiananmen Square to commemorate Zhou. They honored Zhou by laying wreaths, banners, poems, placards, and flowers at the foot of the Monument. The most apparent purpose of this memorial was to eulogize Zhou, but the Gang of Four were also attacked for their actions against the Premier. A small number of slogans left at Tiananmen even attacked Mao and his Cultural Revolution.\nUp to two million people may have visited Tiananmen Square on 4 April. All levels of society, from the most impoverished peasants to high-ranking PLA officers and the children of high-ranking cadres, were represented in the activities. Those who participated were motivated by a mixture of anger over Zhou's treatment, revolt against the Cultural Revolution and apprehension for China's future. The event did not appear to have coordinated leadership.\nThe Central Committee, under the leadership of Jiang Qing, labelled the event 'counter-revolutionary' and cleared the square of memorial items shortly after midnight on April 6. Attempts to suppress the mourners led to a riot. Police cars were set on fire, and a crowd of over 100,000 people forced its way into several government buildings surrounding the square. Many of those arrested were later sentenced to prison. Similar incidents occurred in other major cities. Jiang and her allies attacked Deng as the incident's 'mastermind', and issued reports on official media to that effect. Deng was formally stripped of all positions inside and outside the Party on 7 April. This marked Deng's second purge.\nDeath of Mao Zedong and the Gang of Four's downfall.\nOn 9 September 1976, Mao Zedong died. To Mao's supporters, his death symbolized the loss of China's revolutionary foundation. His death was announced on 9 September. The nation descended into grief and mourning, with people weeping in the streets and public institutions closing for over a week. Hua Guofeng chaired the Funeral Committee and delivered the memorial speech.\nShortly before dying, Mao had allegedly written the message \"With you in charge, I'm at ease,\" to Hua. Hua used this message to substantiate his position as successor. Hua had been widely considered to be lacking in political skill and ambitions, and seemingly posed no serious threat to the Gang of Four in the race for succession. However, the Gang's radical ideas also clashed with influential elders and many Party reformers. With army backing and the support of Marshal Ye Jianying, Director of Central Office Wang Dongxing, Vice Premier Li Xiannian and party elder Chen Yun, on 6 October, the Central Security Bureau's Special Unit 8341 had all members of the Gang of Four arrested in a bloodless coup.\nAfter Mao's death, people characterized as 'beating-smashing-looting elements', who were seen as having disturbed the social order during the CR, were purged or punished. \"Beating-smashing-looting elements\" had typically been aligned with rebel factions.\nAftermath.\nTransitional period.\nAlthough Hua denounced the Gang of Four in 1976, he continued to invoke Mao's name to justify Mao-era policies. Hua spearheaded what became known as the Two Whatevers. Like Deng, Hua wanted to reverse the CR's damage; but unlike Deng, who wanted new economic models for China, Hua intended to move the Chinese economic and political system towards Soviet-style planning.\nOn 10 October, Deng wrote a letter to Hua asking to be transferred back to state and party affairs; party elders also called for Deng's return. With increasing pressure from all sides, Premier Hua named Deng Vice-Premier in July 1977, and later promoted him to various other positions, effectively elevating Deng to be China's second-most powerful figure. In August, the 11th National Congress was held in Beijing, officially naming (in ranking order) Hua Guofeng, Ye Jianying, Deng Xiaoping, Li Xiannian and Wang Dongxing as new members of the Politburo Standing Committee.\nRepudiation and reform under Deng.\nDeng Xiaoping first proposed what he called \"Boluan Fanzheng\" in September 1977 in order to correct the mistakes of the Cultural Revolution. In May 1978, Deng seized the opportunity to elevate his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Hu Yaobang to power. Hu published an article in the \"Guangming Daily\", making clever use of Mao's quotations, while lauding Deng's ideas. Following this article, Hua began to shift his tone in support of Deng. On 1 July, Deng publicized Mao's self-criticism report of 1962 regarding the failure of the Great Leap Forward. As his power base expanded, in September Deng began openly attacking Hua Guofeng's \"Two Whatevers\". The \"1978 Truth Criterion Discussion\", launched by Deng and Hu and their allies, also triggered a decade-long New Enlightenment movement in mainland China, promoting democracy, humanism and universal values, while opposing the ideology of Cultural Revolution.\nOn 18 December 1978, Third Plenum of the 11th Central Committee was held. Deng called for \"a liberation of thoughts\" and urged the party to \"seek truth from facts\" and abandon ideological dogma. The Plenum officially marked the beginning of the economic reform era. Hua Guofeng engaged in self-criticism and called his \"Two Whatevers\" a mistake. At the Plenum, the Party reversed its verdict on the Tiananmen Incident. Former Chinese president Liu Shaoqi was given a belated state funeral. Peng Dehuai, who was persecuted to death during the Cultural Revolution was rehabilitated in 1978.\nAt the Fifth Plenum held in 1980, Peng Zhen, He Long and other leaders who had been purged during the Cultural Revolution were rehabilitated. Hu Yaobang became head of the party secretariat as its secretary-general. In September, Hua Guofeng resigned, and Zhao Ziyang, another Deng ally, was named premier. Hua remained on the Central Military Commission, but formal power was transferred to a new generation of pragmatic reformers, who reversed Cultural Revolution policies to a large extent. Within a few years, Deng and Hu helped rehabilitate over 3\u00a0million \"unjust, false, erroneous\" cases. In particular, the trial of the Gang of Four took place in Beijing from 1980 to 1981, and the court stated that 729,511 people had been persecuted by the Gang, of whom 34,800 were said to have died.\nIn 1981, the Chinese Communist Party passed a resolution and declared that the Cultural Revolution was \"responsible for the most severe setback and the heaviest losses suffered by the Party, the country, and the people since the founding of the People's Republic.\"\nAtrocities.\nDeath toll.\nFatality estimates vary across different sources, usually ranging from hundreds of thousands to millions. In addition to various regimes of secrecy and obfuscation concerning the Revolution, both top-down as perpetuated by authorities, as well as laterally among the Chinese public in the decades since, the discrepancies are due in large part to the totalistic nature of the Revolution itself: it is a significant challenge for historians to discern whether and in what ways discrete events that took place during the Cultural Revolution should be ascribed to it.\nMost deaths occurred after the mass movements ended,23 when organized campaigns attempted to consolidate order in workplaces and communities. As Andrew G. Walder summarizes, \"The cure for factional warfare was far worse than the disease.\"23 Serious man-made disasters such as the 1975 Banqiao Dam failure, also caused many deaths.\nLiterature reviews of the overall death toll due to the Cultural Revolution usually include the following:\nMassacres.\nMassacres took place across China, including in Guangxi, Inner Mongolia, Guangdong, Yunnan, Hunan, Ruijin, and Qinghai, as well as Red August in Beijing.\nThese massacres were mainly led and organized by local revolutionary committees, Communist Party branches, militia, and the military. Most victims were members of the Five Black Categories as well as their children, or members of \"rebel groups\". Chinese scholars have estimated that at least 300,000 people died in these massacres. Collective killings in Guangxi and Guangdong were among the most serious. In Guangxi, the official annals of at least 43 counties have records of massacres, with 15 of them reporting a death toll of over 1,000, while in Guangdong at least 28 county annals record massacres, with 6 of them reporting a death toll of over 1,000.\nOfficial sources in 1980 revealed that, during the Red August, at least 1,772 people were killed by Red Guards, including teachers and principals of many schools, meanwhile 33,695 homes were ransacked and 85,196 families were forced to flee. The Daxing Massacre in rural Beijing caused the deaths of 325 people from 27 August to 1 September 1966; those killed ranged from 80 years old to a 38-day old baby, with 22 families being completely wiped out.\nIn Dao County, Hunan, a total of 7,696 people were killed from 13 August to 17 October 1967, in addition to 1,397 forced to commit suicide, and 2,146 becoming permanently disabled. \nIn the Guangxi Massacre, the official record shows an estimated death toll from 100,000 to 150,000 as well as cannibalism primarily between 1967 and 1968 in Guangxi, where one of the worst violent struggles of the Revolution took place, before Zhou sent the PLA to intervene.\nIn 1975, the PLA led a massacre in Yunnan around the town of Shadian, targeting Hui people, resulting in the deaths of more than 1,600 civilians, including 300 children, and the destruction of 4,400 homes.\nViolent struggles, struggle sessions, and purges.\n\"Violent struggles\" were factional conflicts (mostly among Red Guards and \"rebel groups\") that began in Shanghai and then spread to other areas in 1967. They brought the country to a state of civil war. Weapons used included some 18.77\u00a0million guns, 2.72\u00a0million grenades, 14,828 cannons, millions of other ammunition and even armored cars and tanks. Notable violent struggles include the battles in Chongqing, in Sichuan, and in Xuzhou. Researchers claimed that the nationwide death toll in violent struggles ranged from 300,000 to 500,000.\nThe recorded rate of violence rose in 1967, reaching a peak that summer before dropping suddenly.143 During 1967, casualties were relatively low as the weapons used were primarily clubs, spears, and rocks until late July.143 Although firearms and heavier weapons began to spread during summer, most were neither trained nor committed fighters and therefore casualties remained relatively low.143 The peak of collective violence in summer 1967 dropped sharply after August, when Mao became concerned about rebel attacks on local army units and thereafter made clear that his prior calls to \"drag out\" army commanders was a mistake and he would instead support besieged army commands.\nThe greatest number of casualties occurred during the process of restoring order in 1968, although the overall number of violent conflicts was lower. Walder stated that while \"rising casualties from a smaller number of insurgent conflicts surely reflected the increasing scale and organizational coherence of rebel factions, and their growing access to military weaponry[,]\" another important factor was that \"[t]he longer that local factional warfare continued without the prospect of an equitable political settlement, the greater the stakes for the participants and the more intense the collective violence as factions fought to avoid the consequence of losing.\"\nIn addition to violent struggles, millions of Chinese were violently persecuted, especially via struggle sessions. Those identified as spies, \"running dogs\", \"revisionists\", or coming from a suspect class (including those related to former landlords or rich peasants) were subject to beating, imprisonment, rape, torture, sustained and systematic harassment and abuse, seizure of property, denial of medical attention, and erasure of social identity. Some people were not able to stand the torture and committed suicide. Researchers claimed that at least 100,000 to 200,000 people committed suicide during the early CR. \nAt the same time, many \"unjust, false, and mistaken\" cases appeared due to political purges. In addition to those who died in massacres, a large number of people died or became permanently disabled due to lynching or other forms of persecution. From 1968 to 1969, the Cleansing the Class Ranks purge caused the deaths of at least 500,000 people. Purges of similar nature such as the One Strike-Three Anti Campaign and the campaign towards the May Sixteenth elements were launched in the 1970s. For example, a political purge in Yunnan province, the Zhao Jianmin spy case, resulted in 17,000 deaths and wrongfully persecuted a total of 1.38 million people. \nRepression of ethnic minorities.\nThe Cultural Revolution wrought havoc on minority cultures and ethnicities. Languages and customs of ethnic minorities in China were labeled as part of the Four Olds, texts in ethnic languages were burned, and bilingual education was suppressed. In Inner Mongolia, some 790,000 people were persecuted during the Inner Mongolia incident. Of these, 22,900 were beaten to death, and 120,000 were maimed, during a witch hunt to find members of the alleged separatist New Inner Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party. In Xinjiang, copies of the Qur'an and other books of the Uyghur people were apparently burned. Muslim imams reportedly were paraded around with paint splashed on their bodies. In the ethnic Korean areas of northeast China, clashes took place.\nIn Yunnan Province, the palace of the Dai people's king was torched, and a massacre of Muslim Hui people at the hands of the PLA in Yunnan, known as the Shadian incident, reportedly claimed over 1,600 lives in 1975. After the Cultural Revolution, the government gave reparations for the Shadian Incident, including the erection of a Martyr's Memorial in Shadian.\nConcessions to minorities were abolished during the Cultural Revolution as part of the Red Guards' attack on the \"Four Olds\". People's communes, previously only established in parts of Tibet, were established throughout Tibet Autonomous Region in 1966, removing Tibet's exemption from China's land reform, and reimposed in other minority areas. The effect on Tibet was particularly severe as it came following the repression after the 1959 Tibetan uprising. The destruction of nearly all of its over 6,000 monasteries, which began before the Cultural Revolution, were often conducted with the complicity of local ethnic Tibetan Red Guards. Only eight were intact by the end of the 1970s.\nMany monks and nuns were killed, and the general population was subjected to physical and psychological torture. An estimated 600,000 monks and nuns lived in Tibet in 1950, but by 1979, most were dead, imprisoned or had disappeared. The Tibetan government in exile claimed that many Tibetans died from famines in 1961\u20131964 and 1968\u20131973 as a result of forced collectivization, however, the number of Tibetan deaths or whether famines, in fact, took place in these periods is disputed. Despite persecution, some local leaders and minority ethnic practices survived in remote regions.\nIt was felt that pushing minority groups too hard would compromise China's border defenses. This was especially important as minorities make up a large percentage of the population that live in border regions. In the late 1960s, China experienced a period of strained relations with some of its neighbors, notably with the Soviet Union and India.\nRape and sexual abuse.\nPan Suiming, Emily Honig, and others documented that rape and sexual abuse of sent-down women were common during the Cultural Revolution's height. Tania Branigan documented that women raped tended to be from educated urban backgrounds while their rapists were poor peasants or local officials.\nCultural impact and influence.\nRed Guards riot.\nThe revolution aimed to destroy the Four Olds and establish the corresponding Four News, which ranged from changing of names and cutting of hair to ransacking homes, vandalizing cultural treasures, and desecrating temples.\nThe revolution aimed to eliminate cow demons and snake spirits - the class enemies who promoted bourgeois ideas, as well as those from an exploitative family background or who belonged to one of the Five Black Categories. Large numbers of people perceived to be \"monsters and demons\" regardless of guilt or innocence were publicly denounced, humiliated, and beaten. In their revolutionary fervor, students, especially the Red Guards, denounced their teachers, and children denounced their parents. Many died from ill-treatment or committed suicide. In 1968, youths were mobilized to go to the countryside in the Down to the Countryside Movement so they may learn from the peasantry, and the departure of millions from the cities helped end the most violent phase of the Cultural Revolution.\nAcademics and intellectuals.\nAcademics and intellectuals were regarded as the \"Stinking Old Ninth\" and were widely persecuted. Many were sent to rural labor camps such as the May Seventh Cadre School. The prosecution of the Gang of Four revealed that 142,000 cadres and teachers in the education circles were persecuted. Academics, scientists, and educators who died included Xiong Qinglai, Jian Bozan, Wu Han, Rao Yutai, Wu Dingliang, Yao Tongbin and Zhao Jiuzhang. As of 1968, among the 171 senior members who worked at the headquarters of Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, 131 were persecuted. Among the members of the academy, 229 died. As of September 1971, more than 4,000 staff members of China's nuclear center in Qinghai had been persecuted, while more than 310 were disabled, over 40 committed suicide, and 5 were executed. \nDespite the hardships, some significant achievements came in science and technology: scientists tested the first missile, created China's first hydrogen bomb and launched China's first satellite in the \"Two Bombs, One Satellite\" program. \nMany health personnel were deployed to the countryside as barefoot doctors. Some farmers were given informal medical training, and health-care centers were established in rural communities. This process led to a marked improvement in health and life expectancy.\nEducation system.\nIn the early months of Cultural Revolution, schools and universities were closed. Secondary school classes of 1966, 1967, and 1968 were unable to graduate on time later and became known as the \"Old Three Cohort (\u8001\u4e09\u5c4a)\". Colleges and universities were closed until 1970, and most universities did not reopen until 1972. University entrance exams were cancelled after 1966 (until the beginning of \"Boluan Fanzheng\" period in 1977), replaced by a system whereby students were recommended by factories, villages and military units. Traditional values were abandoned. \nOn the other hand, industrial Universities were established in factories to supply technical and engineering programs for industrial workers, inspired by Mao's July 1968 remarks advocating vocational education. Factories around the country therefore established their own educational programs for technicians and engineers, and by 1976, there were 15,000 such 21 July Universities. Gao Mobo observes that in many underprivileged areas, political campaigns brought improvements in education and public health.\nIn the initial stage of the Down to the Countryside Movement, most of the youth who took part volunteered. Later on, the government forced them to move. Between 1968 and 1979, 17\u00a0million urban youth left for the countryside. Living in the rural areas deprived them of higher education. This generation is sometimes referred to as the \"lost generation\". In the post-Mao period, many of those forcibly moved attacked the policy as a violation of their human rights. Formal literacy measurements did not resume until the 1980s. Some counties in Zhanjiang had literacy rates as low as 59% 20 years after the revolution. This was amplified by the elimination of qualified teachers\u2014many districts were forced to rely on students to teach. \nPrimary and middle schools gradually reopened during the Cultural Revolution. Schooling years were reduced and education standards fell, but the proportion of Chinese children who completed primary education increased from less than half to almost all, and the fraction who completed junior middle school rose from 15% to over two-thirds. Educational opportunities for rural children expanded, while education of the urban elite were restricted by anti-elitist policies. Radical policies provided many in rural communities with middle school education for the first time. Rural infrastructure developed during this period, facilitated by the political changes that empowered ordinary rural people.\nSlogans and rhetoric.\nHuang claimed that the Cultural Revolution had massive effects on Chinese society because of the extensive use of political slogans. He claimed that slogans played a central role in rallying Party leadership and citizens. For example, the slogan \"to rebel is justified\" () affected many views.\nHuang asserted that slogans were ubiquitous in people's lives, printed onto everyday items such as bus tickets, cigarette packets, and mirror tables. Workers were supposed to \"grasp revolution and promote production\".\nPolitical slogans had three sources: Mao, Party media such as \"People's Daily\", and the Red Guards. Mao often offered vague, yet powerful directives that divided the Red Guards. These directives could be interpreted to suit personal interests, in turn aiding factions' goals in claiming loyalty to Mao.\nDittmer and Ruoxi claim that the Chinese language had historically been defined by subtlety, delicacy, moderation, and honesty, as well as the cultivation of a \"refined and elegant literary style\". This changed during the CR. These slogans were an effective method of \"thought reform\", mobilizing millions in a concerted attack upon the subjective world, \"while at the same time reforming their objective world.\"\nDittmer and Chen argued that the emphasis on politics made language into effective propaganda, but \"also transformed it into a jargon of stereotypes\u2014pompous, repetitive, and boring\". To distance itself from the era, Deng's government cut back on political slogans. During a eulogy for Deng's death, CCP general secretary Jiang Zemin called the Cultural Revolution a \"grave mistake\".\nArts and literature.\nIn 1966, Jiang Qing advanced the \"Theory of the Dictatorship of the Black Line\". Those perceived to be bourgeois, anti-socialist or anti-Mao (black line) should be cast aside, and called for the creation of new literature and arts. Disseminators of the \"old culture\" would be eradicated. The majority of writers and artists were seen as \"black line figures\" and \"reactionary literati\", and were persecuted, and subjected to \"criticism and denunciation\" where they could be humiliated and ravaged, and be imprisoned or sent to hard labour. For instance, Mei Zhi and her husband were sent to a tea farm in Lushan County, Sichuan. She did not resume writing until the 1980s. \nIn 1970, the CCP came to view the Ministry of Culture as so disruptive that it decided to dissolve the Ministry and establish a Culture Group within the State Council in an effort to rein in cultural politics. The principles for cultural production laid out by Mao in the 1942 Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Art and Literature became dogmatized. The literary situation eased after 1972, as more were allowed to write, and many provincial literary periodicals resumed publication, but the majority of writers still could not work. Documents released in 1980 regarding the prosecution of the Gang of Four show that more than 2,600 people in the field of arts and literature were persecuted by the Ministry of Culture. Many died: the names of 200 writers and artists who were persecuted to death were commemorated in 1979. These include writers such as Lao She, Fu Lei, Deng Tuo, Baren, Li Guangtian, Yang Shuo and Zhao Shuli.\nDepictions of iron girls became a frequent subject of art during the Cultural Revolution, often shown in spaces and activities traditionally associated with male authority as part of an effort to develop the new socialist woman.100\nOpera and music.\nJiang took control of the stage and introduced revolutionary operas under her direct supervision. Traditional operas were banned as they were considered feudalistic and bourgeois, but revolutionary opera, which modified Peking opera in both content and form, was promoted. Six operas and two ballets were produced in the first three years, most notably the opera \"The Legend of the Red Lantern\". These operas were the only approved opera form. Other opera troupes were required to adopt or change their repertoire. Loyalty dances became common and were performed throughout the country by both professional cultural workers and ordinary people. The model operas were broadcast on the radio, made into films, blared from public loudspeakers, taught to students in schools and workers in factories, and became ubiquitous as a form of popular entertainment and were the only theatrical entertainment for millions. Most model dramas featured women as their leads and promoted Chinese state feminism. Their narratives begin with them oppressed by misogyny, class position, and imperialism before liberating themselves through the discovery of internal strength and the CCP.\nDuring the Cultural Revolution, composers of \"Yellow Music\", which had already been banned following the communist revolution, were persecuted, including Li Jinhui who was killed in 1967. Revolution-themed songs instead were promoted, and songs such as \"Ode to the Motherland\", \"Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman\", \"The East Is Red\" and \"Without the Communist Party, There Would Be No New China\" were either written or became popular during this period. \"The East Is Red\", especially, became popular; it \"de facto\" supplanted \"March of the Volunteers\" (lyrics author Tian Han persecuted to death) as the national anthem of China, though the latter was later restored to its previous place. \n\"Quotation songs\", in which Mao's quotations were set to music, were particularly popular during the early years of the Cultural Revolution. Composer Li Jiefu first published quotation songs in \"People's Daily\" in September 1966 and they were promoted thereafter as a means for studying \"Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong\".47 Records of quotation songs were played over loudspeakers, their primary means of distribution, as the use of transistor radios lagged until 1976. Rusticated youths with an interest in broadcast technology frequently operated rural radio stations after 1968. At the 9th National Congress of the Communist Party, Jiang Qing condemned quotation songs, which she had come to view as comparable to yellow music.43\nVisual arts.\nAesthetic principles emphasized during the Cultural Revolution included the \"tall, big, complete,\" \"red, bright, shining,\" and \"the three prominences\". According to the principle of the \"three prominences,\" the good are more prominent than the bad, the very good are more prominent than the good, and the one outstanding figure is more prominent than the very good.4 Other stylistic principles of the Cultural Revolution included \"tall, large, and full\".96 \nAmong the most significant visual works of the Cultural Revolution was Liu Chunhua's 1967 oil painting, \"Chairman Mao Goes to Anyuan\".132 Another influential painting was Pan Jiajun's 1972 \"I Am a Petrel\", which depicts a young woman soldier repairing a telegraph cables during a storm. Praised as a new classic of depicting a revolutionary heroine, it inspired the creation of similar works and was itself widely distributed as a poster.95\nA Red Guard art movement developed, reaching its peak in 1967.128 Red Guards from fine arts academies organized large art exhibitions, often in cooperation with rebel groups in work units or the army, which included many amateur art works.132 The most significant Red Guard art exhibition was \"Long Live the Triumph of Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Line\" which opened 1 October 1967 in Beijing and featured more than 1,600 art works in a variety of media produced by artists and amateurs from around the country.132 Following the exhibition, traveling teams toured art works from the exhibition through rural China and into remote areas.132 The Red Guard art movement favored forms of art deemed public or anti-elitist, such as black and white woodcuts (or brush and marker illustrations in the style of a woodcut), satirical cartoons, paper cut outs, and forms of folk art. Among the most popular motifs in Red Guard art was the image of a worker, peasant, and soldier conducting criticism or Red Guards doing so.173 Red Guard groups in fine arts academies also published journals, pamphlets, and manifestos through which they criticized the old art institutions.131\nTraditional themes were sidelined and artists such as Feng Zikai, Shi Lu, and Pan Tianshou were persecuted. Many of the artists were assigned to manual labour, and artists were expected to depict subjects that glorified the Cultural Revolution related to their labour. In 1971, in part to alleviate their suffering, several leading artists were recalled from manual labour or freed from captivity under a Zhou initiative to decorate hotels and railway stations defaced by Red Guard slogans. Zhou said that the artworks were meant for foreigners, therefore were \"outer\" art and not under the obligations and restrictions placed on \"inner\" art meant for Chinese citizens. He claimed that landscape paintings should not be considered one of the \"Four Olds\". However, Zhou was weakened by cancer, and in 1974, the Jiang faction seized these and other paintings and mounted exhibitions in Beijing, Shanghai and other cities denouncing the artworks as Black Paintings.\nPropaganda in posters was used as a mass communication device and often served as the people's leading source of information. They were produced in large numbers and widely disseminated to propagate ideological positions. The two main posters genres were the big-character poster or \"dazibao\" and commercial propaganda poster.\nAfter decreasing in prominence throughout the 1980s, Cultural Revolution posters became prominent in public life again in the 1990s in connection with red tourism, as collectibles, in commercial advertising, and in contemporary art.9 In contemporary China, they continue to be reproduced in large amounts and sold commercially.87 Historic posters are have been the subject of exhibitions and auctions, including in the United States and Europe.92 \nBefore the Cultural Revolution, relatively few cultural productions reflected the lives of peasants and workers; during it, the struggles of workers, peasants, and revolutionary soldiers became frequent artistic subjects, often created by peasants and workers themselves. Among the most prominent examples of this style included the peasant paintings of Huxian.133 In the early 1970s, worker, peasant, and soldier-created art was promoted as the paradigm of socialist art.133 The spread of peasant paintings in rural China, for example, became one of the newborn things celebrated in a socialist society.\nLiterature.\nLiterature adapted the aesthetic themes from the model works, such as the \"three prominences\".179 Applied in the literary context, the principle of the three prominences was that texts should demonstrate the struggle between revolutionary and reactionary forces in a stark and dichotomous manner.179\nDuring the Cultural Revolution, the long-form novel was an emphasized form of literature.179 Among the major genres were novels about the experiences of sent-down youth.179 These included novels written by sent-down youths themselves, such as Zhang Kangkang's 1975 novel \"Dividing Line\" and Zhang Changgong's 1973 novel \"Youth\".179\nAmong the amateur writers who became prominent during the Cultural Revolution was Duan Ruixia for the 1973 short story, \"Not Just One of the Audience\".187 \nWriting about the romantic relationships of revolutionary martyrs became one of the taboo topics during the Cultural Revolution. \nFilm.\nThe \"Four Hundred Films to be Criticized\" booklet was distributed, and film directors and actors/actresses were criticized with some tortured and imprisoned. These included many of Jiang Qing's rivals and former friends. Those who died in the period included Cai Chusheng, Zheng Junli, Shangguan Yunzhu, Wang Ying, and Xu Lai. No feature films were produced in mainland China for seven years apart from a few approved \"Model dramas\" and highly ideological films. A notable example is \"Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy\". China rejected Hollywood films and most foreign films. Albanian films and North Korean films developed mass audiences in China. In 1972, Chinese officials invited Michelangelo Antonioni to China to film the achievements of the Cultural Revolution. Antonioni made the documentary \"Chung Kuo, Cina\". When it was released in 1974, CCP leadership in China interpreted the film as reactionary and anti-Chinese. Viewing art through the principles of the Yan'an Talks, particularly the concept that there is no such thing as art-for-art's-sake, party leadership construed Antonioni's aesthetic choices as politically motivated and banned the film.\nMobile film units brought Chinese cinema to the countryside and were crucial to the standardization and popularization of culture during this period, particularly including revolutionary model operas. During the Cultural Revolution's early years, mobile film teams traveled to rural areas with news reels of Mao meeting with Red Guards and Tiananmen Square parades, which became known as \"red treasure films\". The release of the filmed versions of the revolutionary model operas resulted in a re-organization and expansion of China's film exhibition network. From 1965 to 1976, the number of film projection units in China quadrupled, total film audiences nearly tripled, and the national film attendance rate doubled. The Cultural Revolution Group drastically reduced ticket prices which, in its view, would allow film to better serve the needs of workers and of socialism.\nHistorical sites.\nChina's historical sites, artifacts and archives suffered devastating damage, as they were thought to be at the root of \"old ways of thinking\". Artifacts were seized, museums and private homes ransacked, and any item found that was thought to represent bourgeois or feudal ideas was destroyed. Few records relate how much was destroyed\u2014Western observers suggest that much of China's thousands of years of history was in effect destroyed, or, later, smuggled abroad for sale. Chinese historians compare the suppression to Qin Shi Huang's great Confucian purge. Religious persecution intensified during this period, as religion was viewed in opposition to Marxist\u2013Leninist and Maoist thinking.\nThe destruction of historical relics was never formally sanctioned by the Party, whose official policy was instead to protect such items. On 14 May 1967, the Central Committee issued \"Several suggestions for the protection of cultural relics and books during the Cultural Revolution\". Despite this, enormous damage was inflicted on China's cultural heritage. For example, a survey in 1972 in Beijing of 18 cultural heritage sites, including the Temple of Heaven and Ming Tombs, showed extensive damage. Of the 80 cultural heritage sites in Beijing under municipal protection, 30 were destroyed, and of the 6,843 cultural sites under protection by Beijing government decision in 1958, 4,922 were damaged or destroyed. Numerous valuable old books, paintings, and other cultural relics were burnt.\nLater archaeological excavation and preservation after the destructive period were protected, and several significant discoveries, such as the Terracotta Army and the Mawangdui, occurred after the peak of the Revolution. Nevertheless, the most prominent medium of academic research in archaeology, the journal \"Kaogu\", did not publish. After the most violent phase, the attack on traditional culture continued in 1973 with the \"Anti-Lin Biao, Anti-Confucius Campaign\" as part of the struggle against moderate Party elements.\nMedia.\nDuring the early period of the Cultural Revolution, freedom of the press in China was at its peak. While the number of newspapers declined in this period, the number of independent publications by mass political organizations grew. According to China's National Bureau of Statistics, the number of newspapers dropped from 343 in 1965, to 49 in 1966, and then to a 20th-century low of 43 in 1967. At the same time, the number of publications by mass organizations such as Red Guards grew to an estimated number as high as 10,000.\nIndependent political groups could publish broadsheets and handbills, as well as leaders' speeches and meeting transcripts which would normally have been considered highly classified. From 1966 to 1969, at least 5,000 new broadsheets by independent political groups were published. Several Red Guard organizations also operated independent printing presses to publish newspapers, articles, speeches, and big-character posters. For example, the largest student organization in Shanghai, the Red Revolutionaries, established a newspaper that had a print run of 800,000 copies by the end of 1966.\nForeign relations.\nThe functions of China's embassies abroad were disrupted during the early part of the Cultural Revolution. In a 22 March 1969 meeting on the Sino-Soviet border clashes, Mao stated that in foreign relations, China was \"now isolated\" and \"we need to relax a little\". Later that year, China began to restore its embassies to normal functioning. \nHowever, the Sino-Soviet conflict culminated in 1969, and according to declassified documents from both China and the United States, the Soviet Union planned to launch a large-scale nuclear strike on China after the Zhenbao Island incident in 1969. The planned targets include Beijing, Changchun, Anshan and China's missile-launch centers of Jiuquan, Xichang and Lop Nur. This crisis almost led to a major nuclear war, seven years after the Cuban missile crisis. Eventually, the Soviets called off the attack due to the intervention from the United States.\nChina exported communist revolutions as well as communist ideologies to multiple countries in Southeast Asia, supporting parties in Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar and the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia. It is estimated that at least 90% of the Khmer Rouge's foreign aid came from China. In 1975 alone at least US$1 billion in interest-free economic and military aid and US$20\u00a0million came from China. China's economic malaise impacted China's ability to assist North Vietnam in its war against South Vietnam by the 1970s, which cooled relations between the once allied nations.\nEvaluations.\nOn 27 June 1981, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party adopted the \"Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party Since the Founding of the People's Republic of China\", an official assessment of major historical events since 1949. The Resolution declared that the Cultural Revolution was \"responsible for the most severe setback and the heaviest losses suffered by the people, the country, and the party since the founding of the People's Republic.\" \nAfter the Cultural Revolution, a massive social and cultural movement known as the New Enlightenment took place in mainland China since the late 1970s. The movement lasted throughout the 1980s, and opposed the ideology of Cultural Revolution and feudalism. The New Enlightenment movement ended due to the Tiananmen Square protests and massacre in June 1989. After Deng Xiaoping's southern tour in early 1992, however, intellectuals in mainland China became divided and formed two major schools of thought, the \"Liberalism\" and the \"New Left\", which held different views on the Cultural Revolution. Meanwhile Maoist scholars hold another view. \nTo this day, public discussion of the Cultural Revolution is still limited within mainland China. The Chinese government continues to prohibit news organizations from mentioning details, and online discussions and books about the topic are subject to official scrutiny. Textbooks abide by the \"official view\" of the events. Many government documents from the 1960s onward remain classified. Despite inroads by prominent sinologists, independent scholarly research is discouraged.\nMao Zedong's legacy remains in some dispute. During the anniversary of his birth, many people viewed Mao as a godlike figure and referred to him as \"the people's great savior\". Contemporary discussions in the CCP-owned tabloid \"Global Times\" continue to glorify Mao. Rather than focus on consequences, state media newspapers claim that revolutions typically have a brutal side and are unable to be viewed from the \"humanitarian perspective\". Critics of Mao Zedong look at the actions that occurred under his leadership from the point of view that \"he was better at conquering power than at ruling the country and developing a socialist economy\". Mao went to extreme measures on his path to power, costing millions of lives then and during his rule.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the capital of Qashqadaryo Region. Administratively, Qarshi is a district-level city, that includes the urban-type settlement Qashqadaryo. It has a population of 278,300 (2021 estimate). It is about 520\u00a0km south-southwest of Tashkent, and about 335\u00a0km north of Uzbekistan's border with Afghanistan. It is located at latitude 38\u00b0 51' 48N; longitude 65\u00b0 47' 52E at an altitude of 374 meters. The city is important in natural gas production, but Qarshi is also famous for its production of woven flat carpets.\nHistory.\nOriginally the Sogdian city of Nakhshab (which could be possibly named Eucratideia during the rule of Greco-Bactrian Kingdom), and the Islamic Uzbek (Turkic) city of Nasaf, and the Chagatay city of Qarshi (pronounced \"Kharsh\"), Qarshi was the second city of the Emirate of Bukhara. It is in the center of a fertile oasis that produces wheat, cotton, and silk and was a stop on the 11-day caravan route between Balkh and Bukhara. The Mongol Chagataid khans Kebek and Qazan built palaces here on the site of Chinggis Khaan's summer pasture. In 1364, Timur also built a fortified palace with moats in what is now the southern part of the city. The modern name \"Qarshi\" means fort.\nQarshi developed steadily from the 14th century. During the Sheyban dynasty the town grew violently (16th century). It was the second largest town of Bukhara Khanate in the 18th century. During these centuries much of the city's magnificent architectural monuments were built.https:// With the decline of Shahrisabz in the 18th century, Qarshi grew in importance, and was the seat of the Crown Prince to the Emirate of Bukhara. The city had a double set of walls, 10 caravanserais and 4 madrassahs during this time. By 1868, the Russians had annexed the Zarafshan Valley, and in 1873, the treaty turning Bukhara into a Russian protectorate was signed in Qarshi, much to the dismay of the Emir's son, Abdul Malik, who took to the hills in rebellion.\nIn the early 1970s, the first section of a major irrigation project was completed to divert water from the Amu Darya River in Turkmenistan eastward into Uzbekistan in order to irrigate the land surrounding Qarshi. Almost all of these irrigated lands around Qarshi are planted with cotton.\nClimate.\nK\u00f6ppen climate classification system classifies its climate as cold semi-arid (BSk).\nIndustry.\nA gas-to-liquids (GTL) plant, located 40\u00a0km south of Qarshi, is under construction. This plant will be based on Sasol\u2019s GTL technology and will have a capacity of 1.4\u00a0million metric tons per year, with following product slate: GTL diesel, kerosene, naphtha and liquid petroleum gas. The total cost of the project is around $4 billion and it is the first such a high-tech plant on the Eurasian continent. The joint project GTL Uzbekistan, where Sasol and Uzbekistan's state oil company Uzbekneftgas each hold 44.5% interest, and the rest 11% belonging to Malaysian Petronas, was founded in 2009. The plant will be built on the basis of the Shurtan gas and chemical complex.\nCulture.\nSports.\nQarshi is home to FC Nasaf which was founded in 1986. Nasaf plays its home matches at the Markaziy Stadium, built in 2006.\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\n \nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "45315", "revid": "50889894", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45315", "title": "History of Jordan", "text": "The history of Jordan refers to the history of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and the background period of the Emirate of Transjordan under the British Mandate as well as the general history of the region of Transjordan.\nThere is evidence of human activity in Transjordan as early as the Paleolithic period. The area was settled by nomadic tribes in the Bronze Age, which consolidated in small kingdoms during the Iron Age. In the classic period, Transjordan came under Greek and later Roman influence. Under the Romans and the Byzantines, Transjordan was home to the Decapolis in the north, with much of the region being designated as Byzantine Arabia. Classical kingdoms located in the region of Transjordan, such as the Roman-era Nabatean kingdom, which had its capital at Petra, left particularly dramatic ruins popular today with tourists and filmmakers. The history of Transjordan continued with the Muslim empires starting in the 7th century, partial crusader control in the mid-Middle Ages (country of Oultrejordain) and finally, Mamluk rule from the 13th century and Ottoman rule between the 16th century and the First World War.\nWith the Great Arab Revolt in 1916 and the consequent British invasion, the area came under the Anglo-Arab ruled Occupied Enemy Territory Administration East in 1917, which was declared as the Arab Kingdom of Syria in 1920. Following the French occupation of only the northern part of the Syrian Kingdom, Transjordan was left in a period of interregnum. A few months later, Abdullah, the second son of Sharif Hussein, arrived in Transjordan. With the Transjordan memorandum to the Mandate for Palestine in the early 1920s, it became the Emirate of Transjordan under the Hashemite Emir. In 1946, independent Hashemite Kingdom of Transjordan was formed and shortly admitted to the United Nations and the Arab League. In 1948, Jordan fought with the newly born state of Israel over lands of former Mandatory Palestine, effectively gaining control of the West Bank and annexing it with its Palestinian population. Jordan lost the West Bank in the 1967 War with Israel, and since became the central base of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) in its struggle against Israel. The alliance between the PLO and the Jordanians, active during the War of Attrition, came to an end in the bloody Black September in Jordan in 1970, when a civil war between Jordanians and Palestinians (with Syrian Ba'athist support) took thousands of lives. In the aftermath, the defeated PLO was forced out of Jordan together with tens of thousands of its fighters and their Palestinian families, relocating to South Lebanon.\nStone Age.\nEvidence of human activity in Jordan dates back to the Paleolithic period. While there is no architectural evidence from this era, archaeologists have found tools, such as flint and basalt hand-axes, knives and scraping implements.\nIn the Neolithic period (8500\u20134500 BC) three major shifts occurred. First, people became sedentary, living in small villages, and discovering and domesticating new food sources such as cereal grains, peas and lentils, as well as goats. The human population increased to tens of thousands.\nSecond, this shift in settlement pattern appears to have been catalyzed by a marked change in climate. The eastern desert, in particular, grew warmer and drier, eventually to the point where it became uninhabitable for most of the year. This watershed climate change is believed to have occurred between 6500 and 5500 BC.\nThird, beginning sometime between 5500 and 4500 BC, the inhabitants began to make pottery from clay rather than plaster. Pottery-making technologies were probably introduced to the area by craftsmen from Mesopotamia.\nThe largest Neolithic site in Jordan is at Ein Ghazal in Amman. The many buildings were divided into three distinct districts. Houses were rectangular and had several rooms, some with plastered floors. Archaeologists have unearthed skulls covered with plaster and with bitumen in the eye sockets at sites throughout Jordan, Israel, the Palestinian Territories and Syria. A statue discovered at Ein Ghazal is thought to be 8,000 years old. Just over one meter high, it depicts a woman with huge eyes, skinny arms, knobby knees and a detailed rendering of her toes.\nChalcolithic.\nDuring the Chalcolithic period (4500\u20133200 BC), copper began to be smelted and used to make axes, arrowheads and hooks. The cultivation of barley, dates, olives and lentils, and the domestication of sheep and goats, rather than hunting, predominated. The lifestyle in the desert was probably very similar to that of modern Bedouins.\nTuleitat Ghassul is a large Chalcolithic era village located in the Jordan Valley. The walls of its houses were made of sun-dried mud bricks; its roofs of wood, reeds and mud. Some had stone foundations, and many had large central courtyards. The walls are often painted with bright images of masked men, stars, and geometric motifs, which may have been connected to religious beliefs.\nBronze Age.\nMany of the villages built during the Early Bronze Age (3200\u20131950 BC) included simple water infrastructures, as well as defensive fortifications probably designed to protect against raids by neighboring nomadic tribes.\nAt Bab al-Dhra in Wadi `Araba, archaeologists discovered more than 20,000 shaft tombs with multiple chambers as well as houses of mud-brick containing human bones, pots, jewelry and weapons. Hundreds of dolmens scattered throughout the mountains have been dated to the late Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Ages.\nAlthough writing was developed before 3000 BC in Egypt and Mesopotamia, it was generally not used in Jordan, Canaan and Syria until some thousand years later, even though archaeological evidence indicates that the inhabitants of Transjordan were trading with Egypt and Mesopotamia.\nBetween 2300 and 1950 BC, many of the large, fortified hilltop towns were abandoned in favor of either small, unfortified villages or a pastoral lifestyle. There is no consensus on what caused this shift, though it is thought to have been a combination of climatic and political changes that brought an end to the city-state network.\nDuring the Middle Bronze Age (1950\u20131550 BC), migration across the Middle East increased. Trading continued to develop between Egypt, Syria, Arabia, and Canaan including Transjordan, resulting in the spread of technology and other hallmarks of civilization. Bronze, forged from copper and tin, enabled the production of more durable axes, knives, and other tools and weapons. Large, distinct communities seem to have arisen in northern and central Jordan, while the south was populated by a nomadic, Bedouin-type of people known as the Shasu.\nNew fortifications appeared at sites like Amman's Citadel, Irbid, and Tabaqat Fahl (or Pella). Towns were surrounded by ramparts made of earth embankments, and the slopes were covered in hard plaster, making the climb slippery and difficult. Pella was enclosed by massive walls and watch towers.\nArchaeologists usually date the end of the Middle Bronze Age to about 1550 BC, when the Hyksos were driven out of Egypt during the 17th and 18th Dynasties. A number of Middle Bronze Age towns in Canaan including Transjordan were destroyed during this time.\nIron Age.\nDuring the Iron Age (1200\u2013332 BC), Transjordan was home to the Kingdoms of Ammon, Edom and Moab. The peoples of these kingdoms spoke Semitic languages of the Canaanite group; their polities are considered to be tribal kingdoms rather than states. Ammon was located in the Amman plateau, and its capital was Rabbath Ammon; Moab was located in the highlands east of the Dead Sea with the capital at Kir of Moab (Kerak); and Edom in the area around Wadi Araba in the south, with the capital at Bozrah. The northwestern region of the Transjordan, known then as Gilead, was inhabited by the Israelites. According to the Bible, the Transjordan was home to the Israelite tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.\nThe Transjordanian kingdoms of Ammon, Edom and Moab continually clashed with the neighboring Hebrew kingdoms of Israel and Judah, centered west of the Jordan River. One record of this is the Mesha Stele, erected by the Moabite king Mesha in 840 BC; on it he lauds himself for the building projects that he initiated in Moab and commemorates his glory and victory against the Israelites. The stele, found in Dhiban in 1868, constitutes one of the most important archeological parallels of accounts recorded in the Bible.\nAt the same time, Israel and the Kingdom of Aram-Damascus competed for control of the Gilead. Around 720 BC Israel and Aram Damascus were conquered by the Neo-Assyrian Empire. Meanwhile, the kingdoms of Ammon, Edom and Moab benefited from trade between Syria and Arabia. In 701 BC, they submitted to the Assyrians to avoid retribution. Babylonians took over the Assyrians' empire after its disintegration in 627 BC. Although the kingdoms supported the Babylonians against Judah in the 597 BC sack of Jerusalem, they rebelled against Babylon a decade later. The kingdoms were reduced to vassals, a status they retained under the Persian and Hellenic Empires.\nClassical period.\nAlexander the Great's conquest of the Persian Empire in 332 BC introduced Hellenistic culture to the Middle East. Little is known about Greek/Macedonian control over the Levantine coast (southern Syria, Lebanon, Palestine) and Transjordan until 301 BCE, when the Ptolemies took control over this area. After Alexander's death in 323 BC, the empire split among his generals, and in the end much of Transjordan was disputed between the Ptolemies based in Egypt and the Seleucids based in Syria. By the late Hellenistic period, the area had a mixed population of Jews, Greeks, Nabataeans, other Arabs, and descendants of Ammonites. One of the best surviving structures from that period is Qasr al-Abd, a Hellenistic palace built by the Jewish Tobiad family, close to the village of Iraq al-Amir.The Nabataeans, nomadic Arabs based south of Edom, managed to establish an independent kingdom in the southern parts of Jordan in 169 BC by exploiting the struggle between the two Greek powers. The Jewish Hasmonean Kingdom also took advantage of the growing geopolitical vacuum, seizing the area east of the Jordan River valley. The Nabataean Kingdom gradually expanded to control much of the trade routes of the region, and it stretched south along the Red Sea coast into the Hejaz desert, up to as far north as Damascus, which it controlled for a short period (85\u201371) BC. The Nabataeans massed a fortune from their control of the trade routes, often drawing the envy of their neighbours. They also had monopolistic control over the Dead Sea. Petra, Nabataea's barren capital, flourished in the 1st century AD, driven by its extensive water irrigation systems and agriculture. The Nabataeans were also talented stone carvers, building their most elaborate structure, Al-Khazneh, in the first century AD. It is believed to be the mausoleum of the Arab Nabataean King Aretas IV.\nRoman legions under Pompey conquered much of the Levant in 63 BC, inaugurating a period of Roman rule that lasted four centuries. The eastern side of the Jordan River valley, known then as Perea, was part of the Herodian Kingdom of Judea, a vassal state of the Roman Empire. By this time, the kingdoms of Ammon, Edom and Moab lost their distinct identities, and were assimilated into the Roman culture. Some Edomites survived longer - driven by the Nabataeans due to sedition, they had migrated to southern Judea, which became known as Idumaea; They were later converted to Judaism by the Hasmoneans. However, it is likely that Edomite migration to southern Judea has an older history, dating back to Nebuchadnezzar II's reign.\nThe area also became the setting for some important events in Christianity, including the Baptism of Jesus. In 106 AD, Emperor Trajan annexed the Nabataean Kingdom unopposed, and rebuilt the King's Highway which became known as the Via Traiana Nova road. The Romans gave the Greek cities of Transjordan\u2013Philadelphia (Amman), Gerasa (Jerash), Gedara (Umm Quays), Pella (Tabaqat Fahl) and Arbila (Irbid)\u2013and other Hellenistic cities in Palestine and southern Syria, a level of autonomy by forming the \"Decapolis\", a ten-city league. Jerash is one of the best preserved Roman cities in the East; it was even visited by Emperor Hadrian during his journey to Syria Palaestina.\nIn 324 AD, the Roman Empire split, and the Eastern Roman Empire\u2013later known as the Byzantine Empire\u2013continued to control or influence the region until 636 AD. Christianity had become legal within the empire in 313 AD after Emperor Constantine converted to Christianity. The Edict of Thessalonka made Christianity the official state religion in 380 AD. Transjordan prospered during the Byzantine era, and Christian churches were built everywhere. The Aqaba Church in Ayla was built during this era, it is considered to be the world's first purpose built Christian church. Umm ar-Rasas in southern Amman contains at least 16 Byzantine churches. Meanwhile, Petra's importance declined as sea trade routes emerged, and after a 363 earthquake destroyed many structures, it declined further, eventually being abandoned. The Sassanian Empire in the east became the Byzantines' rivals, and frequent confrontations sometimes led to the Sassanids controlling some parts of the region, including Transjordan.\nMiddle Ages.\nIn the early 7th century, the area of modern Jordan became integrated into the new Arab-Islamic Umayyad Empire (the first Muslim dynasty), which ruled much of the Middle East from 661 until 750 AD. At the time, Amman, today the capital of the Kingdom of Jordan, became a major town in \"Jund Dimashq\" (the military district of Damascus, itself a subsection of the Bilad al-Sham province), and became the seat of the provincial governor. Incidentally, there was also a \"Jund al-Urdunn\" (\"Realm of Jordan\") district, but that encompassed a more northerly area than modern Jordan.\nUnder the Umayyad's successors, the Abbasids (750\u20131258), Jordan was neglected and began to languish due to the geopolitical shift that occurred when the Abassids moved their capital from Damascus to Kufa and later to Baghdad.\nAfter the decline of the Abbasids, parts of Jordan were ruled by various powers and empires including the Crusaders, the Ayyubids, the Mamluks as well as the Ottomans, who captured most of the Arab world around 1517.\nOttoman period.\nEarly Ottoman period.\nThe Levant, which has been under Mamluk control since 1250 and specifically the Burji dynasty since 1382, was lost to the Ottomans after their victory in the Battle of Marj Dabiq that ended with the killing of the ruling Qansuh al-Ghuri in August 1516. Initially, the Ottomans didn't interfere much east of the Jordan river, but the increased trade activity passing through Jordan and their new responsibilities towards the Hajj soon caused the establishment of a Government in Al-Karak and a Garrison in Al Shobak. Agricultural villages in Jordan witnessed a period of relative prosperity in the 16th century, benefiting from the stability and administrative structures the Ottomans brought. The region saw tribes vie for regional hegemony, as in contrast to other regions such as Palestine or Damascus, the Jordanian territory would have less Ottoman oversight, and at times virtually absent and reduced to annual tax collection visits. This allowed the tribes in the area to have much more autonomy. The Ottoman period would see the power players inside Jordan which were the Bani Amr-Banu Oqbah, the Mihaydat, and Al-Fadl, be replaced roughly by Al-Majali, Al-Fayez-Bani Sakher, and the Adwan respectively.\nArrival of the Bani Sakher and the Adwan.\nAround the end of the 16th century, a portion of the ancient tribes of Bani Sakher and of the Suwiet clan of the Bani Dhafir, both descendants of Tayy, were heading northwards, with the Sakherites migrating from their ancestral home of Al Ula and the Dhafirites leaving also from an area close to Medina. The Bani Sakher have up until then been roaming the areas from south of Al Ula to as far north as the Golan Heights, and as far East as Fayum in Egypt since at least the Early Mamluk age, but the migration that was about to occur was more permanent and significant in nature. Enmity between the two migrating tribes would soon begin as they collided in battle in Southern Jordan which resulted in a decisive victory for the Bani Sakher. The Dhafir's would flee to Al Azraq where the Bani Sakher tracked them and battle with them again, decimating their forces and killing their Sheikh, Sultan Al-Suwiet. After this defeat, the tribe would split into two, one continued eastwards into Iraq, and the other remained in Jordan, going westwards and become the ancestors of the Adwan tribe. The Bani Sakher also collided with the Wuld Ali Anazzah on the way who migrated northwards at the same time, the battle ended with a Bani Sakher victory and would set the stage for further enmities between the two tribes later in the 18th century.\nAl-Majali of Al-Karak.\nAround the year 1565, the Tamimi tribe, well established in Al-Karak at the time, raised a rebellion which proved too costly to send a regular force to quench. Lala Mustafa Pasha, Wali of Damascus at the time, asked for Yusuf Al-Nimer of Nablus's aide. Al-Nimer marched on Al-Karak with his forces and captured Al-Karak, fleeing the Tamimi to their relatives in Hebron, the Al-Tamimi who left Al-Karak were now nicknamed Al-Majali and it became their family name. He left behind some of the forces with one of his brothers, who held the area until a Turkish Ottoman governor arrived. The following period would see Al-Karak have a balanced power balance between the Turks, the Aghawat (the descendants of Yusuf's brother who remained), and the Emiri Banu Oqbah tribe of Banu Harb that held power in Al-Karak since the Mamluk age. 60 years later, after the death of Omar Agha Al-Nimr, Jalal Ibn Shadid Al-Majali went back to Al-Karak.\nStruggle for the Hauran and Ahl Al-Shamal confederacy.\nThe Hauran, a region extending from northern Suwayda to Northeast Al Mafraq in Jordan, alongside the Wadi Al-Azraq, commonly named as Wadi Al-Sirhan after the tribe, were some of the most coveted fertile grazing lands for Arab tribes up until the modern era. The Sirhan tribe, was the paramount tribe in both regions and lead a confederacy called Ahl Al-Shamal (people of the north) which included other tribes like the Al Issa and the Al Fheili. The neighboring tribe of Al Sardiya, led by Muhammed Al-Mheidi, attacked the Sirhan tribe near Damascus and killing their sheikh Shafi Al Sirhan circa 1650. The Sardiya would claim the Hauran and the Wadi as their own and would rule the region very strictly. The Al Issa and the Al Fheili deserted and would ally with the new lords, leading the Sirhan to migrate to the Al-Jawf region and not counterattack.\nAnazah Invasion and Bani Sakher wars.\nThe end of the 17th century saw the Wuld Ali tribe of the Anazah confederation, led by their paramount sheikhs Al-Tayyar and Ibn Smeir, began migrating deeper northwards out of Khaybar and into the Jawf region, which the Sirhan now inhabited. The Anazeh intended on violent conquest and would siege the Sirhan in the Jawf, reportedly causing a mass starvation for the tribe. At the time the Bani Sakher the two halves of the Bani Sakher, headed by the Al-Fayez and the Khreisha, would regularly camp in the Beersheba and Gaza districts respectively. A Bani Sakher tribesmen left the sieged area and informed the Sheikh Sulayman Al-Khreisha of the Bani Sakher who was camped in the Gaza, as I'dbeys Al-Fayez was involved with a conflict with the Emir of Beersheba at the time that led to the Emir's death. Al-Khreisha rode from Gaza to the Jawf, gathering the Bani Sakher forces on the way, and broke the Anazah siege on the Sirhan. However the Anazah kept pursuing the two tribes and led the tribes to flee to the northwards. This pushed the Bani Sakher, with their new allies the Sirhan, further north into Jordan and into Sardiya territory. The Bani Sakher and the Anazzah would however maintain political ties, especially in raiding such as the Hajj Caravan raids of 1700 and 1703.\nAround the year 1720, a ploy set up by Sheikh I'dbeys Al-Fayez and Sheikh Sulayman Al Khreisha of the Bani Sakher succeeded against the Mahfuz (chief) of the Sardiya. This event would see the Bani Sakher's number of horsemen rise greatly, and would permanently damage the prestige of the Sardiya. The Al-Fayez were soon bestowed as commanders of the Hajj Caravans as the most capable tribe in defending them. In one of the following years, the Anazah battled the Sardiya in Muyzarib, a village northeast of Irbid, and would kill their Sheikh and end the Ahl Al Shamal Confederacy. After which the Bani Sakher, Sirhan, Sardiya, Al Issa, Al Fheili, and some minor tribes would take refuge in Palestine, while the tribes that remained agreed to a Khawa or a tax to be paid to their new Anazah overlords. Al Fheili would permanently settle in Palestinian cities as land tillers and gave up their Bedouin status. For the majority of the rest of the century, the Anazah would rule large swathes of modern-day eastern Jordan, from the Hauran to the Jawf, and occasionally the Balqa region and its surrounding regions.\nThe Bani Sakher, having lost many of its lands in the east, would set their attention to their western lands in the Balqa and Al-Karak and would even get involved in Palestinian power struggles and politics for the rest of the 18th century. In 1730 they challenged Adwan dominance in the Balqa and were established enough in the Balqa to not pay to graze on Adwani lands. In the 1750s they extended their influence deeper into Al-Karak and imposed Khawa on many tribes of Al-Karak including the Tarawna, Dhmur, Atawna, Sarayra, Nawaysa, Maayta, Habashna, and the Christians of Al-Karak. Both of these expansions were under I'dbeys Al-Fayez's, which began a rivalry between the Bani Sakher and the Majali to their south and the Bani Sakher and the Adwan to their north.\nIn 1757, owing to a missed payment by the Ottomans to the Bani Sakher for their help in the siege of Tiberias and a drought in the previous year, Qa'dan, I'dbeys's brother and successor, attacked the advance guard of the Hajj caravan under the Ottoman command Musa Pasha in Al-Qatranah. Husayn Pasha had also been alerted of the advance guard's plunder and the relief guard's dispersal, and attempted to reach out to Sheikh Qa'dan. The Wali of Damascus Husayn Pasha sent representatives who offered Sheikh Qa'dan to negotiate for safe passage to Damascus but were refused. This led to the Hajj Caravan Raid of 1757 which had reverberating effects across the entire Ottoman Empire and greatly affected the Empire's prestige.\nAdwan rise to power.\nAround 1640, the dynamics of power within the Belqa District began to shift dramatically with the arrival of two brothers, Fayez and Fauzan of the Al Dhafir tribe, who sought refuge with the Al Kinda tribe near Jebel Samik. The death of Fauzan shortly after their arrival left Fayez to integrate into the local tribal hierarchy through a pivotal marriage to the daughter of the Sheikh of Kinda. This union bore a son named Adwan, who would later forge an alliance through marriage with a daughter of the Mihdawiya sheikhs, thereby knitting together significant tribal relations that would lay the groundwork for future confrontations and territorial expansions.\nAdwan's son, Hamdan, became a notable figure in these tribal narratives, distinguishing himself through a successful raid on a caravan traveling from northern Iraq to Mecca. The raid, which occurred as the caravan crossed the stream at Al Zarqa, not only bolstered Hamdan's reputation but also resulted in the acquisition of a she-camel named \"Al Zabta,\" a prize that would become a war cry for the Adwan. Over time, Hamdan's ambition and growing discontent with his master, Jaudat, the Mihdawiya Emir, drove him to secretly amass a loyal group of followers known as the Al Qradha, or \"The Borrowed.\" This group proved pivotal in Hamdan's strategies, remaining loyal throughout the ensuing turbulent periods.\nThe tension between Hamdan and Jaudat escalated to a breaking point when Jaudat's oppressive demands led to a revolt, sparked by an incident where a tribesman was forced to substitute for an ox in plowing fields. This revolt, smoldering over two decades, eventually led to Hamdan's death. His sons, however, continued the struggle, leveraging the Mihdawiya Amir's controversial attempt to forcibly marry the daughter of a Christian priest from Al Fheis. This situation presented an opportunity for the Adwan to strategically intervene by allying with the Al Ajarmah tribe and setting a trap for Jaudat under the guise of a reconciliatory wedding feast in Al Fheis. The resulting ambush was deadly; Jaudat and several of his men were killed, a pivotal moment still commemorated by Al Mihdawi's tree in the village.\nIn the aftermath, Jaudat's son, Dhamman, unable to maintain control, retreated with his followers to the Ghors al-Kafrain, Al Rameh, and Al Shunnet Nimrin, effectively ceding significant upland territories to the Adwan. Adwan bin Hamdan who succeeded his father capitalized on this retreat by pursuing Dhaman's son, Mashhur, to the modern Dharset Mashhur, where Mashhur was killed. The victory allowed Adwan to consolidate control over the Ghor, distributing the newly acquired lands among his sons and relatives, at the cost of Dhamman who took refuge at the Balawna tribe. His eldest son, Kayid, received the comparatively smaller Ghor al-Rameh and was encouraged to further expand territory by challenging Dhamman and the Balawna.\nThe battle that followed, taking place at the banks of the Zarqa stream, was costly; Kayid was mortally wounded, and significant losses were suffered. Despite these setbacks, the Adwan, reinforced by their allies, the Qradha, advanced again, decisively defeating the Balawna and driving the Mihdawiya further north, beyond Beisan and into the Ajlun District. This series of conflicts not only solidified Adwan control over the Belqa but also marked the decline of the Mihdawiya as a regional power by 1750, now under Kayid's brother, Diyab.\nHostilities soon arose between the Al-Adwan and Zahir Al Omar, the latter sent a force under Qasim Al-Said to attack Al-Adwan and successfully captured Al-Salt in 1760, and leading the Diyab and his followers to flee to Al-Karak. Salih, Diyab's brother, remained on his lands and would stage a successful raid on a caravan loaded with weapons sent from Nablus to Al-Said. Al-Said turned his attention to Salih but was defeated at Al Ghor, with Salih seizing the chieftainship of the Adwan and the Balqa from Diyab. A succession crisis followed, with Diyab's failed attempt at battling his brother, he asked for Turkish help which led Salih to stay inside Al Salt. Salih failed to recognize the contempt that the urbanites of Al Salt had for the Adwan and was captured and executed, with his head sent to the Turks as a gift. Diyab regained his position momentarily until another revolt caused his death and the Adwan to flee to Jabal Al Druze for half a year, coming back under the leadership of the famous poet Nimr Al-Adwan.\nMajali rise to power in Al-Karak.\nUpon Jalal's arrival, Al-Karak was dominated by two influential factions: the Imamiya, descendants of Turkish officials, and the Amr, who traced their lineage back to Banu Oqbah of Harb, a participant in the historic defeat at Mu'tah in 629. The Majali remained relatively obscure until Salim, Jalal's grandson, rose to prominence as the Chief of the tribe. Salim was instrumental in leveraging the internal strife between the Imamiya and the Amr. Around the year 1700, Salim, sensing an opportunity, allied with the Amr to confront the Imamiya during a large feast at the Bairam festival. An ambush was organized near the west gate of Al-Karak; the signal for attack\u2014a white flag\u2014was raised if the feast included an ox, indicating the presence of numerous Imamiya leaders. When this signal was confirmed, Salim and his 25 men launched a decisive attack, annihilating the Imamiya's presence in Al-Karak.\nThe leadership of Al-Karak then passed to Muhammed Ibn Salim, and then to Hamad, who engaged\nthe Amr over land disputes near Mezar. Using traditional boundary-setting techniques, Hamad managed to expand Majali territory significantly, a crucial step in securing the tribe's future prosperity. Salim ibn Muhammed succeeded his brother Hamad and sought the support of neighboring tribes such as the Bani Hamida, the Hajaya, and the Bani Sakhr, with which Salim successfully expelled the Amr from Al-Karak. However, the victory was bittersweet as the allied tribes demanded their share of the spoils, leading to continued strife and tributes imposed on various groups within the region, with the Bani Sakher levying khawa on most of the tribes in Al-Karak.\nKhalil Majali, succeeding Salim around 1760. The Majali's dominance was challenged during a severe famine of 1779 when Khalil, who controlled the local grain supplies planned to leverage the famine to acquire land from desperate locals . However, his plans were disrupted when Salim's grandson Yusef ibn Sulayman Majali, responding to the community's urgent needs, led a grain caravan from Jerusalem back to Al-Karak. Despite attempts by Khalil to intercept and rob the caravan, Yusef's diplomatic skills ensured its safe passage, which earned him great favor with the local Al-Karaki people.\nKhalil's death soon after marked another pivotal moment for the Majali. Yusef, who was very popular in Al-Karak was elected head of the tribe. He invited the Amr back to Al-Karak in 1804 to strategically incite conflict with the Bani Hamida, ultimately leading to the Amr's expulsion once again. Yusef then incited the Al-Karaki's to attack the Bani Hamida, blaming them for the misfortunes and wars of the region. After a successful attack, Yusef seized the fertile lands north of Al-Karak for himself, securing Majali power and riches in Al Al-Karak.\nAl-Fayez Period.\nThe Beni Sakher under Awad bin Thiab Al-Fayez reinstated the Ahl Al-Shamal confederacy at the beginning of the 19th century with Al Sirhan, Al Sardiya, and the Al Issa as junior tribes, and would raid the Wuld Ali Anazah from Palestine and the Balwa for many decades, until their gradual weakening, ending with the Bani Sakher regaining their lands to the east. The Wuld Ali Anazah were finally pushed out and northwards into Al Mafraq. Around that time, in 1803 the Wahhabi's began occupying lands in Southern Jordan, until they reached Al-Karak in 1808. The Karakis, under Yusuf Al-Majali, refused to pay the Wahhabis, which might've been the reason for Ibn Sa'ud conferring on title of \"Emir of all the Bedouins to the south of Damascus, as far as the Red Sea.\" on Yusuf. This title would prove to be short-lived as by 1812 the Bani Sakher were so overwhelming that they defeated the joint-forces of the Adwan, the Wali of Damascus Sulayman Pasha, and the newly arrived but powerful Ruwalla tribe to occupy and seize the Balqa and flee the Adwan to Ajloun where Al Freihat and Al Schreideh were the paramount powers. A power struggle between Al Freihat and al Schreideh allowed the Bani Sakher to extend further into Jabal Ajloun. In the same year, Johann L. Burckhardt would become the first westerner to see the ancient city of Petra in over a thousand years. In 1820, a battle took place between the Bani Sakher, now led by a young Fendi Al-Fayez and the Adwan led by Diyab and their allies the Bani Hassan north of the Balqa where \"much blood was spilt\".\nIn 1822, Syria was ceded to Ismail Pasha and the growing Muhammad Ali dynasty in Egypt, however rule of the tribes still remained lax and more powerful tribes would see the say autonomy during this period. In 1825, the Al-Freihat and their allies sided with the Adwan and their Balqa coalition which included a list of tribes in Al Qradha and the Bani Hassan, successfully pushed the Bani Sakher out of Jabal Ajloun. In 1833 Ibrahim Pasha turned on the Ottomans and established his rule, whose oppressive policies led to the unsuccessful Peasants' revolt in Palestine in 1834. Jordanian cities of Al-Salt and Al-Karak were destroyed by Ibrahim Pasha's forces for harboring a fled Palestinian revolt leader. Egyptian rule was forcibly ended in 1841 with the help of western intervention, the Ottoman rule was restored. The middle of the 18th century so the rapid expansion\nof the Bani Sakher, under now Emir Fendi Al-Fayez who has seemingly overshadowed his Khreisha counterpart and would gain effective control of the whole tribe. In 1848, an expedition by American Naval Officer William Lynch had him encounter the Bani Sakher during negotiations with Aqil Agha. Already by then, Lynch, noted that the tribe at this point was the most powerful force east of the Jordan, and that Fendi Al-Fayez was referred to as prince, and his son and successor Sattam as the young prince. Around this time Fendi would send Sattam as an emissary to Muhammad Ali Pasha of Egypt bearing horses for gifts.\nDuring that period, the tribe succeeded in establishing vassalage over a significant number of tribes and villages across Jordan, including Al Sardiya, Al Sirhan, Bani Abbad, Bani Hamida, and notably, the influential Majali. The vassalizing of Al-Karak and the Majalis under the sway of Al-Fayez was notably documented in 1863 by Italian explorer Carlo Guarmani.\nA pivotal event in these power dynamics involved the Majalli family, detailed in Carlo Guarmani's account in his book, \"Northern Nejd\". The villagers of Al Tafilah, traditionally under the jurisdiction of Mohammad Al-Majalli and accustomed to paying annual tributes, expressed dissatisfaction with the Majalis' dwindling protection. Led by Abdullah Al-Huara, chief of Al Tafilah, they collectively decided to renounce their vassal status, proposing instead to offer yearly gifts as a token of homage. This shift did not sit well with the Al-Majalli chief, who intended to reassert control. However, intervention by the Bani Sakher, under the leadership of Fendi, whose diplomatic efforts led to a compromise that averted immediate conflict.\nThe tension resurfaced in January 1864 when Al-Majalli sought to reclaim authority over Tafilah. This move triggered a formal declaration of war from Fendi. Shlash Al-Bakhit Al-Fayez led a successful tactical assault against Qoblan Al-Mkheisen, appointed by Al-Majalli to manage Tafilah. In response, Fendi deployed 200 warriors who faced a formidable opposition of 2000 riflemen mounted on dromedaries. As the standoff prolonged, the people of Al-Kerak found themselves in an effective state of siege, grappling with food shortages and growing discontent. In a strategic move, Al-Majalli covertly approached Fendi under the cover of night to formally concede defeat, agreeing to make amends to those affected by the hostilities, including reinstating Al-Huara's son as the Chief of Al-Tafilah. This resolution solidified Al-Fayez's influential role in mediating and resolving tribal conflicts, further instated their leadership and diplomatic prowess in the region.Around the late 1860s Fendi began sharing many of his responsibilities with his son Sattam, who would become the first tribal Sheikh in Jordan since the early Mamluk age to focus on administration, agriculture, and state-building in Jordan outside the urban centers of Al Salt and Al Karak. A formal alliance was struck between the Bani Sakher and the Adwan since the beginning of their hostilities in the 1620s, with the marriage of Alia, the sister of Ali ibn Diyab Al Adwan, to Sattam. Henry Tristram's expedition to the area was right after this marriage, and he was guided by Sheikh Sattam Al-Fayez around much of the country in a 3-month journey, showing signs of much greater stability than what was the case in the previous centuries. Al-Fayez would introduce Henry to the Moabite stone which was in the vassal Bani Hamida lands. The stone was a great discovery, and after strained negotiations it was finally sent to Paris where it now resides in the Louvre.\nThe alliance between the Bani Sakher and the Adwan posed a threat to the Ottoman administration, preceding the Great Arab Revolt by half a century. The mid-1860s would see the Ottomans send multiple forces under Mehmet Rashid Pasha in 1867 into the Adwan lands. The Ottomans instated Mohammad Sa'id Agha as the governor of the Balqa which greatly affected Adwan prestige. Another force was sent against the Adwan who were supported by the Adwan, culminating in another defeat and forcing the Adwan to pay 225,000 piasters as a fine. Another force sent by Rashid Pasha into the Bani Sakher lands in 1869 but the area was too costly to maintain for the Ottomans due to the frequency of attacks.\nRussian persecution of Sunni Muslim Circassians in Circassia, forced their immigration into the region in 1867, where they today form a small part of the country's ethnic fabric. Oppression and neglect for the people of the region forced the population to decline, the only people left were nomadic Bedouins. Urban settlements with small populations included; Al-Salt, Irbid, Jerash and Al-Karak. What added to the under-development of the urban life in Jordan was the fact that the settlements were raided by the Bedouins as a source of living, the urbanites had to pay them to stay\nsafe.\nThe Circassians, supported by the Ottomans, were resettled in Amman, which was a huge loss to the prestige and riches of Adwan. In a balancing act the Ottomans then resettled the Christians of Al Karak which have been paying tribute to the Al-Fayez since 1750 in Madaba, the stronghold of Al-Fayez. This greatly angered Sheikh Sattam who was by now the effectively the paramount Sheikh of the Bani Sakher. Sattam first protested, and with the Ottoman's firm resolution, resorted to violence in order to drive them out. Instead of a prolonged battle, the Ottomans appeased the young Emir by officially giving him the office of Emir Al Jizah, which included the titles Bey and Agha.\nLate Ottoman Period.\nOttoman oppression provoked a revolt, Most notably the Shoubak revolt and the Karak revolt, they were only suppressed with great difficulty.\nEmirate of Transjordan.\nAfter four centuries of stagnant and many times nominal Ottoman rule (1516\u20131918), Turkish control over Transjordan came to an end during World War I when the Hashemite Army of the Great Arab Revolt, took over and secured present-day Jordan with the help and support of the region's local Bedouin tribes, Circassians, and Christians. The revolt was launched by the Hashemites and led by Sharif Hussein of Mecca against the Ottoman Empire. The revolt was supported by the Allies of World War\u00a0I, including Britain and France. Sharif Hussein's sons, Faisal and Abdullah, were promised territorial rule in return.\nWith the break-up of the Ottoman Empire at the end of World War I, the League of Nations and the occupying powers, Britain and France, redrew the borders of the Middle East. Their decisions, most notably the Sykes\u2013Picot Agreement, led to the establishment of the French Mandate for Syria and British Mandate for Palestine. The latter included the territory of Transjordan, which had been already allocated to Abdullah approximately a year prior to the finalization of the Mandate document (the Mandate officially introduced in 1923).\nOne reason was that the British government had at that point to find a role for Abdullah, after his brother Faisal had lost his control in Syria. Jordan had been a \"staging area\" for Faisal's and the Arab nationalists' attempted takeover of Syria in 1918, which was ultimately defeated by the French. Following this, Transjordan was left in a period of interregnum. A few months later, Abdullah, the second son of Sharif Hussein, arrived into Transjordan. Faisal was subsequently given the role of the king of Iraq and the British made Abdullah emir of the newly created Transjordanian state. At first, Abdullah was displeased with the territory given to him, and hoped it was only a temporary allocation, to be replaced by Syria or Palestine. Historian Joseph Massad has described the founding of Jordan as a state in 1921 as \"a hesitant act by its architects, the British and the Hashemites.\"\nThe Permanent Court of International Justice and an International Court of Arbitration established by the Council of the League of Nations handed down rulings in 1925 which determined that Palestine and Transjordan were newly created successor states of the Ottoman Empire as defined by international law.\nThe most serious threats to Emir Abdullah's position in Transjordan were repeated Wahhabi incursions from Najd into southern parts of his territory. The emir was powerless to repel those raids by himself, thus the British maintained a military base, with a small air force, at Marka, close to Amman.\nIn 1928, Britain officially provided King Abdullah with full autonomy, though the British RAF continued to provide security to the emirate.\nThe Emirate of Transjordan had a population of 200,000 in 1920, 225,000 in 1922 and 400,000 (as Kingdom) in 1948. Almost half of the population in 1922 (around 103,000) was nomadic.\nKingdom of Transjordan/Jordan.\nEstablishment.\nOn 17 January 1946 the British Foreign Secretary, Ernest Bevin, announced in a speech at the General Assembly of the United Nations that the British Government intended to take steps in the near future to establish Transjordan as a fully independent and sovereign state. The Treaty of London was signed by the British Government and the Emir of Transjordan on 22 March 1946 as a mechanism to recognise the full independence of Transjordan upon ratification by both countries' parliaments. Transjordan's impending independence was recognized on April 18, 1946, by the League of Nations during the last meeting of that organization. On 25 May 1946 the Transjordan became the \"Hashemite Kingdom of Transjordan\" when the ruling 'Amir' was re-designated as 'King' by the parliament of Transjordan on the day it ratified the Treaty of London. 25 May is still celebrated as independence day in Jordan although legally the mandate for Transjordan ended on 17 June 1946 when, in accordance with the Treaty of London, the ratifications were exchanged in Amman and Transjordan gained full independence. When King Abdullah applied for membership in the newly formed United Nations, his request was vetoed by the Soviet Union, citing that the nation was not \"fully independent\" of British control. This resulted in another treaty in March 1948 with Britain in which all restrictions on sovereignty were removed. Despite this, Jordan was not a full member of the United Nations until December 14, 1955.\nIn April 1949, after the country gained control of the West Bank, the country's official name became the \"Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan\".\n1948 War and annexation of the West Bank.\nTransjordan was one of the Arab states opposed to the partition of Palestine and creation of Israel in May 1948. It participated in the war between the Arab states and the newly founded State of Israel. Thousands of Palestinians fled the Arab-Israeli fighting to the West Bank and Jordan. The Armistice Agreements of 3 April 1949 left Jordan in control of the West Bank and provided that the armistice demarcation lines were without prejudice to future territorial settlements or boundary lines.\nThe United Nations General Assembly adopted a plan for the future government of Palestine which called for termination of the Mandate not later than 1 August 1948.\nThe works of Benny Morris, Avi Shlaim, Ilan Pappe, Mary Wilson, Eugene Rogan, and other historians outline a \"modus vivendi\" agreement between Abdullah and the Yishuv. Those works are taught in most Israeli university courses on the history, political science, and sociology of the region. Archival materials reveal that the parties had negotiated the non-belligerent partition of Palestine between themselves, and that initially they had agreed to abide by the terms of the UN resolution. John Baggot Glubb, the commander of the Arab Legion, wrote that British Foreign Secretary Bevin had given the green light for the Arab Legion to occupy the territory allocated to the Arab state. The Prime Minister of Transjordan explained that Abdullah had received hundreds of petitions from Palestinian notables requesting protection upon the withdrawal of the British forces. Eugene Rogan says that those petitions, from nearly every town and village in Palestine, are preserved in \"The Hashemite Documents: The Papers of Abdullah bin al-Husayn, volume V: Palestine 1948\" (Amman 1995).\nAfter the mandate was terminated, the armed forces of Transjordan entered Palestine. The Security Council adopted a US-backed resolution that inquired about the number and disposition of Transjordan's armed forces in Palestine. The Foreign Minister of Transjordan replied in a telegram \"that neither the UN nor US recognized Transjordan, although they both had been given the opportunity for more than two years. Yet the US had recognized the Jewish state immediately, although the factors for this recognition were lacking.\"\nIn explaining to the Security Council why Transjordan's armed forces had entered Palestine, Abdullah said: \"we were compelled to enter Palestine to protect unarmed Arabs against massacres similar to those of Deir Yassin.\"\nAfter capturing the West Bank during the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War, Abdullah was proclaimed King of Palestine by the Jericho Conference. The following year, Jordan annexed the West Bank.\nThe United States extended \"de jure\" recognition to the government of Transjordan and the government of Israel on the same day, 31 January 1949. Clea Bunch said that \"President Truman crafted a balanced policy between Israel and its moderate Hashemite neighbours when he simultaneously extended formal recognition to the newly created state of Israel and the Kingdom of Transjordan. These two nations were inevitably linked in the President's mind as twin emergent states: one serving the needs of the refugee Jew, the other absorbing recently displaced Palestinian Arabs. In addition, Truman was aware of the private agreements that existed between Jewish Agency leaders and King Abdullah I of Jordan. Thus, it made perfect sense to Truman to favour both states with de jure recognition.\"\nIn 1978, the U.S. State Department published a memorandum of conversation between Mr. Stuart W. Rockwell of the Office of African and Near Eastern Affairs and Abdel Monem Rifai, a Counselor of the Jordan Legation, on 5 June 1950. Mr. Rifai asked when the United States was going to recognize the union of Arab Palestine and Jordan. Mr. Rockwell explained the Department's position, stating that it was not the custom of the United States to issue formal statements of recognition every time a foreign country changed its territorial area. The union of Arab Palestine and Jordan had been brought about as a result of the will of the people and the US accepted the fact that Jordanian sovereignty had been extended to the new area. Mr. Rifai said he had not realized this and that he was very pleased to learn that the US did in fact recognize the union.\nJordan was admitted as a member state of the United Nations on 14 December 1955.\nOn 24 April 1950, Jordan formally annexed the West Bank (including East Jerusalem) declaring \"complete unity between the two sides of the Jordan and their union in one state... at whose head reigns King Abdullah Ibn al Hussain\". All West Bank residents were granted Jordanian citizenship. The December 1948 Jericho Conference, a meeting of prominent Palestinian leaders and King Abdullah, voted in favor of annexation into what was then Transjordan.\nJordan's annexation was regarded as illegal and void by the Arab League and others. It was recognized by Britain, Iraq and Pakistan. The annexation of the West Bank more than doubled the population of Jordan. Both Irbid and Zarqa more than doubled their population from less than 10,000 each to more than, respectively, 23,000 and 28,000.\nReign of King Hussein.\nKing Abdullah's eldest son, Talal of Jordan, was proclaimed king in 1951, but he was declared mentally unfit to rule and deposed in 1952. His son, Hussein Ibn Talal, became king on his eighteenth birthday, in 1953.\nThe 1950s have been labelled as a time of \"Jordan's Experiment with Liberalism\". Freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of association were guaranteed in the newly written constitution as with the already firmly established freedom of religion doctrine. Jordan had one of the freest and most liberal societies in the Middle East and in the greater Arab world during the 1950s and early 1960s.\nJordan ended its special defense treaty relationship with the United Kingdom and British troops completed their withdrawal in 1957. In February 1958, following announcement of the merger of Syria and Egypt into the United Arab Republic, Iraq and Jordan announced the Arab Federation of Iraq and Jordan, also known as the Arab Union. The Union was dissolved in August 1958.\nIn 1965 Jordan and Saudi Arabia concluded a bilateral agreement that realigned the border. The realignment resulted in some exchange of territory, and Jordan's coastline on the Gulf of Aqaba was lengthened by about eighteen kilometers. The new boundary enabled Jordan to expand its port facilities and established a zone in which the two parties agreed to share petroleum revenues equally if oil were discovered. The agreement also protected the pasturage and watering rights of nomadic tribes inside the exchanged territories.\nJordan signed a mutual defense pact in May 1967 with Egypt, and it participated, along with Syria, Egypt, and Iraq in the Six-Day War of June 1967 against Israel. During the war, Israel took control of East Jerusalem and West Bank, leading to another major influx of Palestinian refugees into Jordan. Its Palestinian refugee population\u2014700,000 in 1966\u2014grew by another 300,000 from the West Bank. The result of the 29 August 1967 Arab League summit was the Khartoum Resolution, which according to Abd al Azim Ramadan, left only one option -a war with Israel.\nThe period following the 1967 war saw an upsurge in the power and importance of Palestinian militants (\"fedayeen\") in Jordan. Other Arab governments attempted to work out a peaceful solution, but by September 1970, known as the Black September in Jordan, continuing \"fedayeen\" actions in Jordan \u2014 including the destruction of three international airliners hijacked and held in the desert east of Amman \u2014 prompted the Jordanian government to take action. In the ensuing heavy fighting, a Syrian tank force took up positions in northern Jordan to support the \"fedayeen\" but was forced to retreat. By September 22, Arab foreign ministers meeting at Cairo had arranged a cease-fire beginning the following day. Sporadic violence continued, however, until Jordanian forces won a decisive victory over the \"fedayeen\" in July 1971, expelling them from the country.\nAn attempted military coup was thwarted in 1972. No fighting occurred along the 1967 cease-fire line during the Yom Kippur War in 1973, but Jordan sent a brigade to Syria to fight Israeli units on Syrian territory.\nIn 1974, King Hussein recognised the PLO as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. However, in 1986, Hussein severed political links with the PLO and ordered its main offices to be closed. In 1988, Jordan renounced all claims to the West Bank but retained an administrative role pending a final settlement. Hussein also publicly backed the Palestinian uprising, or First Intifada, against Israeli rule.\nJordan witnessed some of the most severe protests and social upheavals in its history during the 1980s. Protests in Jordanian universities especially Yarmouk University and urban areas protested inflation and lack of political freedom. A massive upheaval occurred in the southern city of Ma'an. There was rioting in several cities over price increases in 1989. The same year saw the first general election since 1967. It was contested only by independent candidates because of the ban on political parties in 1963. Martial law was lifted and a period of rapid political liberalization began. Parliament was restored and some thirty political parties, including the Islamic Action Front, were created.\nJordan did not participate directly in the Gulf War of 1990\u201391, but it broke with the Arab majority and supported the Iraqi position of Saddam Hussein. This position led to the temporary repeal of U.S. aid to Jordan. As a result, Jordan came under severe economic and diplomatic strain. After the Iraqi defeat in 1991, Jordan, along with Syria, Lebanon, and Palestinian representatives, agreed to participate in direct peace negotiations with Israel sponsored by the U.S. and Russia. Eventually, Jordan negotiated an end to hostilities with Israel and signed a declaration to that effect on July 25, 1994; the Israel-Jordan Peace Treaty was concluded on October 26, 1994, ending 46-year official state of war.\nFood price riots occurred in 1996, after subsidies were removed under an economic plan supervised by the International Monetary Fund. By the late 1990s, Jordan's unemployment rate was almost 25%, while nearly 50% of those who were employed were on the government payroll. The 1997 parliamentary elections were boycotted by several parties, associations and leading figures.\nIn 1998, King Hussein was treated for lymphatic cancer in the United States. After six months of treatment he returned home to a rousing welcome in January 1999. Soon after, however, he had to fly back to the US for further treatment. King Hussein died in February 1999. More than 50 heads of state attended his funeral. His eldest son, Crown Prince Abdullah, succeeded to the throne.\nReign of King Abdullah II.\nEconomy.\nEconomic liberalization policies under King Abdullah II have helped to create one of the freest economies in the Middle East.\nIn March 2001, King Abdullah and presidents Bashar al-Assad of Syria and Hosni Mubarak of Egypt inaugurated a $300m (\u00a3207m) electricity line linking the grids of the three countries. In September 2002, Jordan and Israel agreed on a plan to pipe water from the Red Sea to the shrinking Dead Sea. The project, costing $800m, is the two nations' biggest joint venture to date. King Abdullah and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad launched the Wahdah Dam project at a ceremony on the Yarmuk River in February 2004.\nForeign relations.\nJordan has sought to remain at peace with all of its neighbors. In September 2000, a military court sentenced six men to death for plotting attacks against Israeli and US targets. Following the outbreak of Israeli-Palestinian fighting in September 2000, Amman withdrew its ambassador to Israel for four years. In 2003, Jordan's Central Bank retracted an earlier decision to freeze accounts belonging to leaders of Hamas. When senior US diplomat Laurence Foley was gunned down outside his home in Amman in October 2002, in the first assassination of a Western diplomat in Jordan, scores of political activists were rounded up. Eight militants were later found guilty and executed in 2004. King Abdullah did, however, criticise the United States and Israel over the conflict in Lebanon in 2006.\nPolitics.\nJordan's gradual institution of political and civil liberty has continued, but the slow pace of reform has led to increasing discontent. Following the death of a youth in custody, riots erupted in the southern town of Ma'an in January 2002, the worst public disturbances in more than three years.\nThe first parliamentary elections under King Abdullah II were held in June 2003. Independent candidates loyal to the king won two-thirds of the seats. A new cabinet was appointed in October 2003 following the resignation of Prime Minister Ali Abu al-Ragheb. Faisal al-Fayez was appointed prime minister. The king also appointed three female ministers. However, in April 2005, amid reports of the king's dissatisfaction with the slow pace of reforms, the government resigned and a new cabinet was sworn in, led by Prime Minister Adnan Badran.\nThe first local elections since 1999 were held in July 2007. The main opposition party, the Islamist Action Front, withdrew after accusing the government of vote-rigging. The parliamentary elections of November 2007 strengthened the position of tribal leaders and other pro-government candidates. Support for the opposition Islamic Action Front declined. Political moderate Nader Dahabi was appointed prime minister.\nIn November 2009, the King once more dissolved parliament halfway through its four-year term. The following month, he appointed a new premier to push through economic reform. A new electoral law was introduced May 2010, but pro-reform campaigners said it did little to make the system more representational. The parliamentary elections of November 2010 were boycotted by the opposition Islamic Action Front. Riots broke out after it was announced that pro-government candidates had won a sweeping victory.\nArab Spring.\nOn 14 January, the Jordanian protests began in Jordan's capital Amman, and at Ma'an, Al Karak, Salt and Irbid, and other cities. The following month, King Abdullah appointed a new prime minister, former army general Marouf Bakhit, and charged him with quelling the protests whilst carrying out political reforms. The street protests continued through the summer, albeit on a smaller scale, prompting the King to replace Bakhit with Awn al-Khasawneh, a judge at the International Court of Justice (October 2011). However, Prime Minister Awn al-Khasawneh resigned abruptly after just six months having been unable to satisfy either the demands for reform or allay establishment fears of empowering the Islamist opposition. King Abdullah appointed former prime minister Fayez al-Tarawneh to succeed him.\nIn October 2012, King Abdullah called for early parliamentary elections, to be held at some time in 2013. The Islamic Action Front, continued in its calls for broader political representation and a more democratic parliament. The King appointed Abdullah Ensour, a former minister and vocal advocate of democratic reform, as prime minister.\nMass demonstrations took place in Amman (November 2012) against the lifting of fuel subsidies. Public calls for the end of the monarchy were heard. Clashes between protesters and supporters of the king followed. The government reversed the fuel price rise following the protest. \"Al Jazeera\" stated that protests are expected to continue for several weeks because of increasing food prices.\nArab Winter.\nWith the rapid expansion of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant into northern and eastern Iraq in summer of 2014, Jordan became threatened by the radical Jihadist organization, and deployed more troops on the Iraqi and Syrian borders.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}

{"id": "45317", "revid": "1319976379", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45317", "title": "Flange", "text": "External or internal ridge, or rim which provides strength\nA flange is a protruded ridge, lip or rim, either external or internal, that serves to increase strength (as the flange of a steel beam such as an I-beam or a T-beam); for easy attachment/transfer of contact force with another object (as the flange on the end of a pipe, steam cylinder, etc., the circular or oval flange for securing truck and trailer tail lights, or on the lens mount of a camera); or for stabilizing and guiding the movements of a machine or its parts (as the inside flange of a rail car or tram wheel, which keep the wheels from running off the rails). Flanges are often attached using bolts in the pattern of a bolt circle.\nFlanges play a pivotal role in piping systems by allowing easy access for maintenance, inspection, and modification. They provide a means to connect or disconnect pipes and equipment without the need for welding, which simplifies installation and reduces downtime during repairs or upgrades. Additionally, flanges facilitate the alignment of pipes, ensuring a proper fit and minimizing stress on the system.\nPlumbing or piping.\nA flange can also be a plate or ring to form a rim at the end of a pipe when fastened to the pipe (for example, a closet flange). A blind flange is a plate for covering or closing the end of a pipe. A flange joint is a connection of pipes, where the connecting pieces have flanges by which the parts are bolted together.\nAlthough the word 'flange' generally refers to the actual raised rim or lip of a fitting, many flanged plumbing fittings are themselves known as flanges.\nCommon flanges used in plumbing are the Surrey flange or Danzey flange, York flange, Sussex flange and Essex flange.\nSurrey and York flanges fit to the top of the hot water tank allowing all the water to be taken without disturbance to the tank. They are often used to ensure an even flow of water to showers. An Essex flange requires a hole to be drilled in the side of the tank.\nThere is also a Warix flange which is the same as a York flange but the shower output is on the top of the flange and the vent on the side. The York and Warix flange have female adapters so that they fit onto a male tank, whereas the Surrey flange connects to a female tank.\nA closet flange provides the mount for a toilet.\nPipe flanges.\nPiping components can be bolted together between flanges. Flanges are used to connect pipes with each other, to valves, to fittings, and to specialty items such as strainers and pressure vessels. A cover plate can be connected to create a \"blind flange\". Flanges are joined by bolting, and sealing is often completed with the use of gaskets or other methods. Mechanical means to mitigate effects of leaks, like spray guards or specific spray flanges, may be included. Industries where flammable, volatile, toxic or corrosive substances are being processed have greater need of special protection at flanged connections.\nFlange guards can provide that added level of protection to ensure safety.\nThere are many different flange standards to be found worldwide. To allow easy functionality and interchangeability, these are designed to have standardised dimensions. Common world standards include ASA/ASME (USA), PN/DIN (European), BS10 (British/Australian), and JIS/KS (Japanese/Korean). In the USA, the standard is ASME B16.5 (ANSI stopped publishing B16.5 in 1996). ASME B16.5 covers flanges up to 24 inches size and up to pressure rating of Class 2500. Flanges larger than 24 inches are covered in ASME B16.47.\nIn most cases, standards are interchangeable, as most local standards have been aligned to ISO standards; however, some local standards still differ. For example, an ASME flange will not mate against an ISO flange. Further, many of the flanges in each standard are divided into \"pressure classes\", allowing flanges to be capable of taking different pressure ratings. Again these are not generally interchangeable (e.g. an ASME 150 will not mate with an ASME 300).\nThese pressure classes also have differing pressure and temperature ratings for different materials. Unique pressure classes for piping can also be developed for a process plant or power generating station; these may be specific to the corporation, engineering procurement and construction (EPC) contractor, or the process plant owner. The ASME pressure classes for flat-face flanges are Class 125 and Class 250. The classes for ring-joint, tongue and groove, and raised-face flanges are Class 150, Class 300, Class 400 (unusual), Class 600, Class 900, Class 1500, and Class 2500.\nThe flange faces are also made to standardized dimensions and are typically \"flat face\", \"raised face\", \"tongue and groove\", or \"ring joint\" styles, although other obscure styles are possible.\nFlange designs are available as \"weld neck\", \"slip-on\", \"lap joint\", \"socket weld\", \"threaded\", and also \"blind\".\nTypes of flanges.\nFlanges come in various types, each designed to meet specific requirements based on factors such as pressure, temperature, and application. Some common types include:\nASME standards (U.S.).\nPipe flanges that are made to standards called out by ASME B16.5 or ASME B16.47, and MSS SP-44. They are typically made from forged materials and have machined surfaces. ASME B16.5 refers to nominal pipe sizes (NPS) from &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20442\" to 24\". B16.47 covers NPSs from 26\" to 60\". Each specification further delineates flanges into pressure classes: 150, 300, 400, 600, 900, 1500 and 2500 for B16.5, and B16.47 delineates its flanges into pressure classes 75, 150, 300, 400, 600, 900. However these classes do not correspond to maximum pressures in psi. Instead, the maximum pressure depends on the material of the flange and the temperature. For example, the maximum pressure for a Class 150 flange is 285 psi, and for a Class 300 flange it is 740 psi (both are for ASTM a105 carbon steel and temperatures below 100\u00a0\u00b0F).\nThe gasket type and bolt type are generally specified by the standard(s); however, sometimes the standards refer to the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (B&amp;PVC) for details (see ASME Code Section VIII Division 1 \u2013 Appendix 2). These flanges are recognized by ASME Pipe Codes such as ASME B31.1 Power Piping, and ASME B31.3 Process Piping.\nMaterials for flanges are usually under ASME designation: SA-105 (Specification for Carbon Steel Forgings for Piping Applications), SA-266 (Specification for Carbon Steel Forgings for Pressure Vessel Components), or SA-182 (Specification for Forged or Rolled Alloy-Steel Pipe Flanges, Forged Fittings, and Valves and Parts for High-Temperature Service). In addition, there are many \"industry standard\" flanges that in some circumstance may be used on ASME work.\nThe product range includes SORF, SOFF, BLRF, BLFF, WNRF (XS, XXS, STD and Schedule 20, 40, 80), WNFF (XS, XXS, STD and Schedule 20, 40, 80), SWRF (XS and STD), SWFF (XS and STD), Threaded RF, Threaded FF and LJ, with sizes from 1/2\" to 16\". The bolting material used for flange connection is stud bolts mated with two nut (washer when required). In petrochemical industries, ASTM A193 B7 STUD and ASTM A193 B16 stud bolts are used as these have high tensile strength.\nEuropean dimensions (EN / DIN) Hygienic Flange STC DIN11853-2.\nMost countries in Europe mainly install flanges according to standard DIN EN 1092-1 (forged stainless or steel flanges). Similar to the ASME flange standard, the EN 1092-1 standard has the basic flange forms, such as weld neck flange, blind flange, lapped flange, threaded flange (thread ISO7-1 instead of NPT), weld on collar, pressed collars, and adapter flange such as flange coupling GD press fittings. The different forms of flanges within the EN 1092-1 (European Norm/Euronorm) is indicated within the flange name through the type. \nSimilar to ASME flanges, EN1092-1 steel and stainless flanges, have several different versions of raised or none raised faces. According to the European form the seals are indicated by different form:\nFurthermore, for sanitary applications such as in the food and beverage and pharmaceutical industries, sanitary flanges according to DIN 11853-2 STC are utilized. The primary distinction between sanitary flanges according to DIN 11853-2 and DIN/EN flanges lies in the restricted dead-room and the interior polishing according to hygienic levels of H1 to H4. Usually the flange traders that hold the Standard DIN EN 1092-1 such as Hage Fittings, do not hold Sanitary flanges as the storage requirements are different. Sanitary flanges are more delicate and need to stay clean. Usually the O-Rings, according to DIn 11853, are made out of FPM or EPDM.\nOther countries.\nFlanges in the rest of the world are manufactured according to the ISO standards for materials, pressure ratings, etc. to which local standards including DIN, BS, and others, have been aligned.\nCompact flanges.\nAs the size of a compact flange increases it becomes relatively increasingly heavy and complex resulting in high procurement, installation and maintenance costs.\nLarge flange diameters in particular are difficult to work with, and inevitably require more space and have a more challenging handling and installation procedure, particularly on remote installations such as oil rigs.\nThe design of the flange face includes two independent seals. The first seal is created by application of seal seating stress at the flange heel, but it is not straight forward to ensure the function of this seal.\nTheoretically, the heel contact will be maintained for pressure values up to 1.8 times the flange rating at room temperature.\nTheoretically, the flange also remains in contact along its outer circumference at the flange faces for all allowable load levels that it is designed for.\nThe main seal is the IX seal ring. The seal ring force is provided by the elastic stored energy in the stressed seal ring. Any heel leakage will give internal pressure acting on the seal ring inside intensifying the sealing action. This however requires the IX ring to be retained in the theoretical location in the ring groove which is difficult to ensure and verify during installation.\nThe design aims at preventing exposure to oxygen and other corrosive agents. Thus, this prevents corrosion of the flange faces, the stressed length of the bolts and the seal ring. This however depends on the outer dust rim to remain in satisfactory contact and that the inside fluid is not corrosive in case of leaking into the bolt circle void.\nApplications of compact flanges.\nThe initial cost of the theoretical higher performance compact flange is inevitably higher than a regular flange due to the closer tolerances and significantly more sophisticated design and installation requirements.\nBy way of example, compact flanges are often used across the following applications: subsea oil and gas or riser, cold work and cryogenics, gas injection, high temperature, and nuclear applications.\nTrain wheels.\nMost trains and trams stay on their tracks primarily due to the conical geometry of their wheels. They also have a flange on one side to keep the wheels, and hence the train, running on the rails when the limits of the geometry-based alignment are reached, either due to some emergency or defect, or simply because the curve radius is so small that self-steering normally provided by the coned wheel tread is no longer effective.\nVacuum flanges.\nA vacuum flange is a flange at the end of a tube used to connect vacuum chambers, tubing and vacuum pumps to each other.\nMicrowave.\nIn microwave telecommunications, a flange is a type of cable joint that allows different types of waveguide to connect.\nSeveral different microwave RF flange types exist, such as CAR, CBR, OPC, PAR, PBJ, PBR, PDR, UAR, UBR, UDR, icp and UPX.\nSki boots.\nSki boots use flanges at the toe or heel to connect to the binding of the ski. The size and shape for flanges on alpine skiing boots is standardized in ISO 5355. Traditional telemark and cross country boots use the 75\u00a0mm Nordic Norm, but the toe flange is informally known as the \"duckbill\". New cross country bindings eliminate the flange entirely and use a steel bar embedded within the sole instead.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Born into a relatively minor noble family, Rudolf succeeded his father as Count of Habsburg in 1240, gradually expanding his power through military campaigns, political alliances, and the construction of key fortresses such as Neuhabsburg Castle. His marriage to Gertrude of Hohenberg further strengthened his position among the Swabian nobility. During the turbulent period of the Great Interregnum, Rudolf distinguished himself both as a formidable military leader\u2014participating in regional conflicts and even joining the Prussian Crusade in 1254\u2014and as a restorer of order, often intervening against robber barons and feuding nobles. Despite facing excommunication due to disputes with the Church, Rudolf ultimately reconciled with ecclesiastical authorities and built a reputation for fairness and pragmatism. In 1273, he was elected King of the Romans, ending decades of imperial vacancy and division. As king, Rudolf reasserted imperial authority in Germany, notably defeating King Ottokar II of Bohemia and securing Habsburg control over Austria, Styria, and Carinthia. His reign laid the foundations for the rise of the Habsburg dynasty, which would become one of the most influential royal houses in European history. Rudolf died in 1291, leaving a legacy of restored stability and dynastic ambition within the Holy Roman Empire.\nEarly life.\nRudolf was born on 1 May 1218 at Limburgh Castle near Sasbach am Kaiserstuhl in the Breisgau region of present-day southwestern Germany. He was the son of Count Albert IV of Habsburg and Hedwig, daughter of Count Ulrich of Kyburg. The Habsburgs derive their name from Habichtsburg Castle near Brugg in Aargau, which was probably built by Guntram the Rich in 1020. According to the chronicler Matthias of Neuch\u00e2tel from the mid-14th century, Emperor Frederick II was Rudolf's godfather. However, Rudolf was not educated at the royal court and probably knew neither writing nor Latin. Rudolf had four siblings: two brothers, Albrecht and Hartmann, and two sisters, Kunigunde and another whose name is unknown. Rudolf's father Albrecht IV joined the Barons' Crusade in the summer of 1239. When news of his death arrived in 1240, Rudolf assumed sole rule of the main Habsburg line.\nCount of Habsburg.\nAt his father's death in 1239, Rudolf inherited from him large estates around the ancestral seat of Habsburg Castle in the Aargau region of present-day Switzerland as well as in Alsace. Thus, in 1240, Early in his rule, Rudolf became embroiled in disputes with neighboring nobles such as Hugo von Tiefenstein, which led to military confrontations and the eventual destruction of Tiefenstein\u2019s stronghold. Around 1244, Rudolf constructed Neuhabsburg Castle on Lake Lucerne, strengthening his family's presence in central Switzerland and consolidating his territorial base. In 1253, Rudolf married Gertrude of Hohenberg, an alliance that enhanced his political standing and brought valuable connections, particularly in Swabia. Amidst the ongoing conflicts between secular and ecclesiastical authorities, Rudolf sometimes clashed with church officials; at one point, his actions against the Bishop of Basel resulted in his excommunication, though he later reconciled with the Church. In 1254, Rudolf joined the Prussian Crusade, a campaign led by the Teutonic Order against pagan Prussian tribes, which not only enhanced his reputation as a Christian knight but also expanded his network among the German nobility.\nRise to power.\nAfter the death of Frederick II in 1250, the Holy Roman Empire plunged into a period of political turmoil known as the Great Interregnum. Frederick\u2019s son, Conrad IV, briefly attempted to assert his claim to the throne but faced strong opposition from the papacy and rival princes, ultimately dying in 1254 without consolidating his rule. In the ensuing chaos, William of Holland was elected king by a faction of princes but struggled to establish authority beyond his core territories and died in 1256. The double election of 1257 resulted in two kings being installed in the empire: Alfonso X of Castile and Richard of Cornwall. However neither of them was able to secure effective control over the Holy Roman Empire or achieve imperial coronation by the pope. Richard visited Germany only a few times and lacked a strong power base there, while Alfonso, ruling from Spain, never set foot in Germany and was unable to assert his authority. Both men struggled to gain widespread recognition, enforce their rule, or gain the papal approval necessary for imperial coronation.\nThe disorder in Germany during the interregnum afforded an opportunity for Count Rudolf to increase his possessions. His wife was a Hohenberg heiress; and on the death of his childless maternal uncle Count Hartmann IV of Kyburg in 1264, Rudolf seized Hartmann's valuable estates. Successful feuds with the Bishops of Strasbourg and Basel further augmented his wealth and reputation, including rights over various tracts of land that he purchased from abbots and others.\nIn August 1273, in view of the situation in the Holy Roman Empire, the pope Gregory X issued an ultimatum to the electors to choose a king. The pope added the threat that he would appoint an emperor if the electors could not agree on the election of a king. In September 1273, the electors, with the exception of Ottokar II, agreed on Rudolf. Ottokar II stayed away from the election; his place was taken by Henry XIII, Duke of Lower Bavaria.The electors assembled in Frankfurt unanimously elected Rudolf on October 1, 1273. Soon after, Rudolf reached Frankfurt and proceeded to Aachen with the princes, where on October 24, 1273, Archbishop Engelbert II of Cologne formally crowned him in Charlemagne's cathedral. Rudolf ignored Pope Gregory X's claim to approval. Despite the Curia's reluctance, the Habsburg's support for the Staufers, for which he had been excommunicated in 1248, had not yet been forgotten, the pope eventually acknowledged Rudolf's election on September 20, 1274.\nRudolf met with Gregory X on October 20, 1275, to discuss the Lausanne Cathedral's consecration. King Rudolf promised the pope during this meeting that he would defend the Church's rights and property and that Sicily and the Empire would not be merged. The king's legally enforceable pledge marked a break from the Staufer dynasty's power-politics strategy. Rudolf was invited to Rome for his imperial coronation after he accepted the cross from the pope's hand and was officially acknowledged as king. It was widely accepted that the coronation date would be February 2, 1276. Before the agreed date, Pope Gregory X died on January 10, 1276, and the king was initially busy dealing with the aftermath of the interregnum and fully occupied with the fight against King Ottokar II of Bohemia.\nKing of the Germans.\nIn November 1274, the Imperial Diet at Nuremberg decided that all Crown estates seized since the death of the Emperor Frederick II must be restored, and that King Ottokar II must answer to the Diet for not recognising the new king. Ottokar refused to appear or to restore the duchies of Austria, Styria and Carinthia together with the March of Carniola, which he had claimed through his first wife, a Babenberg heiress, and which he had seized while disputing them with another Babenberg heir, Margrave Hermann VI of Baden. Rudolf refused to accept Ottokar's succession to the Babenberg patrimony, declaring that the provinces reverted to the Imperial crown due to the lack of male-line heirs. King Ottokar was placed under the imperial ban; and in June 1276 war was declared against him.\nHaving persuaded Ottokar's former ally Duke Henry XIII of Lower Bavaria to switch sides, Rudolf compelled the Bohemian king to cede the four provinces to the control of the royal administration in November 1276. Rudolf then re-invested Ottokar with the Kingdom of Bohemia, betrothed one of his daughters to Ottokar's son Wenceslaus II, and made a triumphal entry into Vienna. Ottokar, however, raised questions about the execution of the treaty, and procured the support of several German princes, again including Henry XIII of Lower Bavaria. To meet this coalition, Rudolf formed an alliance with King Ladislaus IV of Hungary and gave additional privileges to the Viennese citizens. On 26 August 1278, the rival armies met at the Battle on the Marchfeld, where Ottokar was defeated and killed. The Margraviate of Moravia was subdued and its government entrusted to Rudolf's representatives, leaving Ottokar's widow Kunigunda of Slavonia in control of only the province surrounding Prague, while the young Wenceslaus II was again betrothed to Rudolf's youngest daughter Judith.\nRudolf's attention next turned to the possessions in Austria and the adjacent provinces, which were taken into the royal domain. He spent several years establishing his authority there but found some difficulty in establishing his family as successors to the rule of those provinces. At length, the hostility of the princes was overcome. In December 1282, at the Hoftag (imperial diet) in Augsburg, Rudolf invested his sons, Albert and Rudolf II, with the duchies of Austria and Styria and so laid the foundation of the House of Habsburg. Additionally, he made the twelve-year-old Rudolf Duke of Swabia, a merely titular dignity, as the duchy had been without an actual ruler since Conradin's execution. The 27-year-old Duke Albert, married since 1274 to a daughter of Count Meinhard II of Gorizia-Tyrol (1238\u201395), was capable enough to hold some sway in the new patrimony.\nIn 1286, King Rudolf fully invested Albert's father-in-law Count Meinhard with the Duchy of Carinthia, one of the conquered provinces taken from Ottokar. The Princes of the Empire did not allow Rudolf to give everything that was recovered to the royal domain to his own sons, and his allies needed their rewards too. Turning to the west, in 1281 he compelled Count Philip I of Savoy to cede some territory to him, then forced the citizens of Bern to pay the tribute that they had been refusing. After his son Rudolf II defeated Bern at the Battle of Schosshalde, he strengthened his authority in Switzerland. He further expanded his Swiss possessions and granted some ecclesiastical posts to his family. In 1289 he marched against Count Philip's successor, Otto IV, compelling him to do homage.\nIn 1281, Rudolf's first wife died. On 5 February 1284, he married Isabella, daughter of Duke Hugh IV of Burgundy, the Empire's western neighbor in the Kingdom of France.\nRudolf was not very successful in restoring internal peace. Orders were indeed issued for the establishment of territorial peaces in Bavaria, Franconia and Swabia, and at the Synod of W\u00fcrzburg in March 1287 for the whole Empire. But the king lacked the power, resources, and determination to enforce them, although in December 1289 he led an expedition into Thuringia, where he destroyed a number of robber castles. In 1291, he attempted to secure the election of his son Albert as German king. The electors refused, however, claiming inability to support two kings, but in reality, perhaps, wary of the increasing power of the House of Habsburg. Upon Rudolf's death they elected Count Adolf of Nassau.\nPersecution of the Jews.\nIn 1286, Rudolf I instituted a new persecution of the Jews, declaring them \"servi camerae\" (\"serfs of the treasury\"), which had the effect of negating their political freedoms. Along with many others, Rabbi Meir of Rothenburg left Germany with family and followers, but was captured in Lombardy and imprisoned in a fortress in Alsace. Tradition has it that a large ransom of 23,000 marks silver was raised for him (by the Rosh), but Rabbi Meir refused it, for fear of encouraging the imprisonment of other rabbis. He died in prison after seven years. Fourteen years after his death a ransom was paid for his body by Alexander ben Shlomo (Susskind) Wimpfen, who was subsequently laid to rest beside the Maharam.\nDeath.\nRudolf died in Speyer on 15 July 1291 and was buried in Speyer Cathedral. Only one of his sons survived him: Albert I. Most of his daughters outlived him, apart from Catherine who had died in 1282 during childbirth and Hedwig who had died in 1285/6.\nRudolf's reign is most memorable for his establishment of the House of Habsburg as a powerful dynasty in the southeastern part of the realm.

{"id": "45322", "revid": "37599202", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45322", "title": "Albus Dumbledore", "text": "Fictional character from Harry Potter\nAlbus Dumbledore is a fictional character in the \"Harry Potter\" series of novels by J. K. Rowling. For most of the series, he is the headmaster of the wizarding school Hogwarts. He is also the founder and leader of the Order of the Phoenix, an organisation dedicated to fighting the Dark wizard Lord Voldemort.\nIn the novels, Dumbledore is widely regarded as one of the most powerful and influential wizards of his time. Renowned for his wisdom, kindness, and formidable magical abilities, he plays a crucial role in shaping the events of the wizarding world. As a mentor to Harry Potter, he provides guidance and crucial knowledge in the fight against Voldemort. Despite his benevolent image, Dumbledore's past is marked by tragedy and complexity, including his youthful association with Gellert Grindelwald, a Dark wizard he later defeated. His philosophical views on power, love, and death are central themes in the series. \nDumbledore is portrayed by Richard Harris in the film adaptations of \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\" (2001) and \"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\" (2002). Following Harris's death in October 2002, Michael Gambon was cast in the role. He plays Dumbledore in six \"Harry Potter\" films, which were released from 2004 to 2011. Jude Law portrays a middle-aged version of the character in the prequel films ' (2018) and ' (2022). John Lithgow is set to portray him in the upcoming HBO series \"Harry Potter\".\nCreation and development.\nRowling has described Dumbledore as \"the epitome of goodness\". She said that he speaks for her, as he \"knows pretty much everything\" about the \"Harry Potter\" universe. Rowling mentioned that Dumbledore regrets \"that he has always had to be the one who knew, and who had the burden of knowing. And he would rather not know.\" As a mentor to the central character Harry Potter, she said that \"Dumbledore is a very wise man who knows that Harry is going to have to learn a few hard lessons to prepare him for what may be coming in his life. He allows Harry to get into what he would not allow another pupil to do, and he also unwillingly permits Harry to confront things he'd rather protect him from.\" In a 1999 interview, Rowling stated that she imagined Dumbledore as elderly and stately, and compared him to John Gielgud.\" In a 2000 interview, Rowling said that Dumbledore is a hundred and fifty years old during the events of the novels. However, she has stated on her website that he was born in 1881, which makes him either 115 or 116 at the time of his death.\nIn 2007, Rowling was asked whether Dumbledore finds \"true love\". Rowling said that she always thought of Dumbledore as being homosexual and that he had fallen in love with the corrupt wizard Gellert Grindelwald, which was Dumbledore's \"great tragedy\"; Rowling did not explicitly state whether Grindelwald returned his affections. Rowling explains this further by elaborating on the motivations behind Dumbledore's flirtation with the idea of wizard domination of Muggles: \"He lost his moral compass completely when he fell in love and I think subsequently became very mistrustful of his own judgement in those matters so became quite asexual. He led a celibate and a bookish life.\"\nEtymology.\nThe name \"Dumbledore\" is borrowed from a dialectal word for \"bumblebee\". Rowling chose the name because Dumbledore loves music, and she imagined him walking around and humming to himself frequently.\nAppearances in novels.\n\"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\".\nDumbledore is introduced in the opening chapter of the first novel in the series, \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\" (1997). Under cover of night, he brings the infant Harry Potter to the home of Harry's uncle and aunt, Vernon and Petunia Dursley. Harry's parents were killed by the Dark wizard Voldemort, and Dumbledore hopes he will be safe with the Dursleys. He leaves Harry on the doorstep with a letter explaining the situation. When Harry arrives at Hogwarts ten years later, Dumbledore tells him about the Mirror of Erised, a magical object that protects the Philosopher's Stone. Dumbledore is summoned to the Ministry of Magic by a false message on the night when Harry, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, and Professor Quirinus Quirrell enter the dungeons to retrieve the Stone. He realises during the trip that he is needed at Hogwarts, and returns in time to rescue Harry from Quirrell and Voldemort.\n\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\".\nDumbledore returns in the second novel, \"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\" (1998). Through a magical diary, Harry sees a younger Dumbledore in a series of flashbacks. The diary once belonged to Tom Riddle, who eventually became Voldemort. In one flashback, Harry sees Dumbledore questioning Riddle about a series of attacks on Muggle-born students. In the present, a basilisk emerges from the Chamber of Secrets and begins attacking people in Hogwarts. Following the attacks, Lucius Malfoy convinces the governors of Hogwarts to suspend Dumbledore from his position as Headmaster. Dumbledore is reinstated when it is revealed that Lucius coerced the governors into suspending him.\n\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\".\nAt the beginning of \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\" (1999), Dumbledore is forced to accept the presence of Dementors at Hogwarts. The Dementors have been sent to protect the students from Sirius Black, a supposed murderer who escaped from the wizard prison Azkaban. When Black breaches Hogwarts, Dumbledore closes every entrance to the school and grounds. After the Dementors cause Harry to fall off his broom during a Quidditch match, Dumbledore becomes angry and uses his wand to help Harry return safely to the ground. Later, Dumbledore suggests that Hermione use her Time-Turner to save Black and Buckbeak the hippogriff from execution.\n\"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\".\nIn \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\" (2000), Dumbledore brings the Triwizard Tournament to Hogwarts. He also serves as a judge throughout the event. After the final task of the tournament, Harry returns from an encounter with Voldemort. Professor Mad-Eye Moody escorts Harry into the castle, and Dumbledore becomes suspicious. He discovers that Moody is actually Barty Crouch Jr., and that the real Moody is being held prisoner by Crouch. Later, Dumbledore listens to Harry's account of Voldemort's return.\n\"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\".\nIn the fifth novel in the series, \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" (2003), Dumbledore is removed from his position as Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, voted out of the Chairmanship of the International Confederation of Wizards, and is almost stripped of his Order of Merlin First Class due to his speeches regarding the return of Voldemort. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Magic attempts to discredit him and Harry, often through the \"Daily Prophet\". Dumbledore enrages Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge when he intercedes at a hearing to prevent Harry from being expelled from Hogwarts.\nThe Ministry passes Educational Decree Twenty-two, which allows Fudge to appoint Dolores Umbridge as the professor of Defence Against the Dark Arts. Through her, Fudge gradually gains power over Hogwarts and Dumbledore, whom he fears is amassing an underage wizard army to overthrow the Ministry. Umbridge forbids students from practicing defensive spells in her class, which prompts Harry, Ron, and Hermione to form a secret practice group called Dumbledore's Army. When the Ministry discovers the group, Dumbledore shields his students from punishment by falsely claiming that it was his idea. He is removed from the position of headmaster for the second time.\nWhen the Order of the Phoenix battles Voldemort's Death Eaters in the Department of Mysteries, Dumbledore arrives to aid them. He subdues most of the Death Eaters and binds them with an Anti-Disapparition Jinx to prevent them from escaping. He then engages in a duel with Voldemort, who tries to possess Harry so Dumbledore will kill him. After this ruse fails, Voldemort is forced to flee with Bellatrix Lestrange. Several Ministry officials witness the end of the battle, which leads to Dumbledore being reinstated as headmaster. Dumbledore explains to Harry that Voldemort chose Harry as his equal, and that either he or Voldemort must eventually kill the other.\n\"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\".\nIn \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\" (2005), Dumbledore brings Harry along as he attempts to persuade Horace Slughorn to rejoin the Hogwarts faculty. Harry notices that Dumbledore's right hand is shrivelled and blackened. During the school year, Dumbledore uses the Pensieve to teach Harry about Voldemort's life and his rise to power. In one of the Pensieve visions, Harry witnesses Dumbledore's first encounter with the young Tom Riddle. Dumbledore had known from the beginning that Riddle was dangerous, but believed that Hogwarts would change him.\nDumbledore and Harry learn that Voldemort created six Horcruxes to gain immortality, and that they must be destroyed before Voldemort can be killed. Harry repeatedly warns Dumbledore that Draco Malfoy is an agent of Voldemort, but Dumbledore refuses to take action against Draco. He tells Harry that he already knows more about what is happening than Harry does. Near the end of the novel, Dumbledore and Harry enter a cave in search of a Horcrux. Dumbledore drinks a potion inside the Horcrux's container and begins to scream in agony. When Harry attempts to retrieve some lake water for Dumbledore to drink, he is attacked by Inferi that reside in the lake. They try to drown Harry, but Dumbledore rescues him.\nDumbledore and Harry arrive in the Hogwarts Astronomy Tower with the Horcrux. Dumbledore asks Harry not to interfere in the events that are about to take place, and puts him in a body-binding curse. Immobilized, Harry is unable to intervene as Draco arrives and disarms Dumbledore. Several other Death Eaters then enter the tower and try to persuade Draco to kill Dumbledore. When Draco hesitates, Severus Snape appears and performs the killing curse on the headmaster. His funeral is attended by students, Hogwarts staff, members of the Ministry of Magic and others. He is entombed in a marble sarcophagus beside the Hogwarts lake.\n\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\".\nDetails of Dumbledore's earlier life are revealed in \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\" (2007). The novel introduces his parents, Percival and Kendra Dumbledore, and his younger sister, Ariana (his younger brother, Aberforth, is mentioned in previous books). At the age of six, Ariana was attacked by three Muggle boys who witnessed her performing magic. She was deeply traumatised and was never able to control her magic again. Enraged, Percival attacked the boys and was given a life sentence in Azkaban. Kendra subsequently moved the family to the village of Godric's Hollow. Around the time that Albus completed his education, Ariana accidentally killed their mother. Albus became the head of the family and remained in their house with Ariana while Aberforth finished school.\nSoon afterward, Dumbledore befriended the young wizard Gellert Grindelwald. They dreamed of uniting the three Deathly Hallows \u2013 the Elder Wand, the Resurrection Stone and the Cloak of Invisibility \u2013 and creating a world in which wizards rule over Muggles. One day, an argument between Albus, Aberforth, and Grindelwald led to a duel that resulted in Ariana's death. For the rest of his life, Albus felt guilty, never certain whether it was his own curse or another's that killed his sister. He felt he could not be trusted with power and turned down the position of Minister for Magic multiple times, eventually returning to Hogwarts as a professor of Transfiguration. Decades later, Dumbledore faced and defeated Grindelwald, who had become a Dark wizard and had obtained the Elder Wand. Dumbledore now possessed not only the Elder Wand but also the Cloak of Invisibility, which he had borrowed from James Potter before his death. Dumbledore would eventually pass the cloak on to Harry.\nThe truth about Dumbledore's death is revealed to Harry through Snape's memories in the Pensieve. Harry learns that Dumbledore put on a cursed ring that held the Resurrection Stone, which he hoped would allow him to apologise to his sister and parents. The curse damaged his hand, and Snape told him he would die in about a year. Dumbledore then revealed to Snape that he knew about Draco's attempts to kill him. Since Dumbledore was close to death, he asked Snape to use the killing curse on him. This act of self-sacrifice would prevent Draco's soul from being damaged by committing murder, and would cause Voldemort to trust Snape completely.\nNear the end of the novel, Harry is struck by Voldemort's killing curse. He finds himself in an ethereal realm with Dumbledore, who confesses many regrets from earlier in his life. He informs Harry that he can return to his body and face the Dark Lord again. Harry returns, kills Voldemort, then places the Elder Wand in Dumbledore's tomb. In the book's epilogue, it is revealed that Harry named his second son Albus Severus Potter, after Dumbledore and Snape.\nPortrayal in other media.\nFilm.\nIn the film adaptations of \"Philosopher's Stone\" (2001) and \"Chamber of Secrets\" (2002), Dumbledore is portrayed by Richard Harris, who was expected to play the character throughout the series. Before Harris was cast, Patrick McGoohan reportedly had an interest in the role, but could not commit due to health issues. Sean Connery was approached, but declined due to the film's subject matter. Harris turned down the role three times but eventually accepted it because his 11-year-old granddaughter threatened to never speak to him again if he did not take it. Harris was determined to portray Dumbledore again in \"Prisoner of Azkaban\" (2004), despite having been diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma, and asked David Heyman not to recast the role. However, his death in October 2002 necessitated recasting.\nChristopher Lee was the producer's immediate choice for replacing Harris, but scheduling conflicts due to Lee's commitments as Saruman in \"The Lord of the Rings\" trilogy and Count Dooku in the \"Star Wars\" prequels forced him to decline. Ian McKellen was also offered the role, but he turned it down, having played the similar character Gandalf in \"The Lord of the Rings\" trilogy, as well as feeling it would have been inappropriate to take Harris's role, as Harris had called McKellen a \"dreadful\" actor. Harris's family had expressed an interest in seeing Peter O'Toole being chosen as his replacement. Harry Robinson, who doubled for Harris in the first two films, and who also lent his voice in the first \"Harry Potter\" video game, was also considered for the role of Dumbledore. Four months after Harris's death, Michael Gambon was cast as his replacement. Gambon adopted a slight Irish accent for the role. He plays the character in all the remaining \"Harry Potter\" films.\nIn flashback scenes in \"Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1\" and \"Part 2\", a young Dumbledore is portrayed by Toby Regbo. In the prequel films ' (2018) and ' (2022), Dumbledore is played by Jude Law.\nTelevision.\nDumbledore is set to be portrayed by John Lithgow in the HBO television adaption of the \"Harry Potter\" series.\nStage.\nDumbledore appears in the play \"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child\" (2016). The play is written by Jack Thorne from a story by Thorne, J. K. Rowling and John Tiffany. The plot occurs nineteen years after the events of \"Deathly Hallows\", and features time-travel elements.\nCharacterisation.\nOutward appearance.\nIn the novels, Dumbledore is described as tall, thin and elderly. His hair and beard are long and silver. He has a long and crooked nose, long fingers and bright blue eyes. He wears half-moon spectacles and a colourful array of robes. He once claimed to have a scar above his left knee in the shape of a map of the London Underground. At some point between the fifth and sixth novels, Dumbledore puts on a cursed ring, which causes his right hand to become blackened and disfigured.\nPersonality.\nDumbledore is described as benevolent and wise. His demeanour is often described as serene, ethereal and composed, and he rarely displays strong emotions. He is eccentric, slightly effeminate and fond of knitting. He is known for his odd displays of whimsicality, and he often uses humour to put others at ease. His eyes are sometimes described as twinkling with kindness or mischief. Dumbledore is highly perceptive and emotionally intelligent, and has a deep capacity for love. He sees the good in every person, and insists on giving people second chances. Dumbledore's personality also has a more steely aspect. When he apprehends Barty Crouch Jr in \"Goblet of Fire\", the look upon his face is described as \"more terrible than Harry could have ever imagined.\" As Harry observes the \"cold fury\" in Dumbledore's visage, he understands why Voldemort fears him.\nIn spite of Dumbledore's many extraordinary qualities, he is a flawed character. According to Rowling, \"Although Dumbledore seems to be so benign for six books, he's quite a Machiavellian figure, really. He's been pulling a lot of strings.\" In a 2005 interview, Rowling commented: \"Immense brainpower does not protect you from emotional mistakes, and I think Dumbledore really exemplifies that.\" Dumbledore's greatest flaw, which he admits to Harry, is his desire for power. He eventually finds that those best suited for power are those who do not seek it. When he and Grindelwald first meet, they make plans to enslave Muggles and re-establish wizards as the natural rulers of the world. However, Dumbledore becomes disillusioned of this fantasy after his sister Ariana is killed during a duel between himself, his brother Aberforth, and Grindelwald.\nDumbledore is riddled with guilt over the circumstances surrounding the death of his sister. He feels enormous remorse for his selfishness in getting involved in the circumstances that led to her death, and is tortured for the rest of his life by the possibility that he might have been the one who cast the spell that killed her. When he looks into the Mirror of Erised, he sees himself redeemed in the eyes of his brother and his entire family alive and together.\nMagical abilities and skills.\nDumbledore is considered by many characters to be the most powerful wizard alive. Some say he is the only wizard Voldemort ever feared. During his education at Hogwarts, Dumbledore was known as the most brilliant student to have ever stepped into the school, winning \"every prize of note that the school offered\", and doing \"things with a wand [the examiner had] never seen before\". Rowling has said that Dumbledore is primarily self-taught, although he \"had access to superb teachers at Hogwarts\". Dumbledore readily acknowledges that he is unusually intelligent and an exceptionally powerful wizard. He admits a number of times to Harry in that he makes mistakes, and since he is smarter than most people, his mistakes \"tend to be correspondingly huger\". Dumbledore is also skilled in Occlumency, Legilimency and Transfiguration. During his time as a student, Dumbledore was in Gryffindor House.\nPossessions.\nDumbledore is the owner and master of the Elder Wand, an extremely powerful object which is one of the Deathly Hallows. He also has a pet phoenix named Fawkes. It is revealed in \"Philosopher's Stone\" by Mr. Ollivander that Harry's wand carries a phoenix feather as its magical core and that particular phoenix only gave one other feather, the one in Voldemort's wand that gave Harry his scar. It is later revealed in \"Goblet of Fire\" that Fawkes was the phoenix whose feathers provide the magical core in Harry's and Voldemort's wands.\nReception.\nThe character of Albus Dumbledore has been compared to other archetypal \"wise old man\" characters. Dumbledore acts much like Merlin from \"The Sword in the Stone\", in the manner of an \"absent-minded professor\"; both Merlin and Dumbledore educate a story's main character in a castle. As writer Evelyn Perry notes, \"Dumbledore resembles Merlin both personally and physically; he is an avid lover of books and wisdom who wears flowing robes and a long, white beard.\" Dumbledore has also been compared with Gandalf from J. R. R. Tolkien's \"The Lord of the Rings\". Dave Kopel draws comparisons between Rowling's writing and John Bunyan's \"The Pilgrim's Progress\" and states that, among the Christian symbols that Rowling has used in her books, Dumbledore acts like \"the bearded God the Father\" figure in which Harry puts his faith to be saved from Voldemort and his servants. IGN also listed Dumbledore as their fifth favourite \"Harry Potter\" character, saying that \"[f]or a character that was introduced into popular culture a mere twelve years ago, it speaks volumes that Professor Dumbledore has already taken his place among the great mentor figures in literature and film\". IGN's Joe Utichi called Dumbledore his third favourite \"Harry Potter\" character, calling the revelation that he wasn't so \"infallible\" one of the most heartbreaking themes of the final book. Actor Michael Gambon received some criticism for his louder, more aggressive, portrayal of the character, who is depicted as exhibiting a more subdued, unflappable calm in the books. This has been attributed to Gambon's policy of not reading the source material from which his films are adapted.\nAs a main character of the series, major facts relating to Dumbledore have generated a vast number of essays and discussions. The death of Dumbledore at the end of \"Half-Blood Prince\" was discussed by fans and critics alike. A website named DumbledoreIsNotDead.com sought to understand the events of the sixth book in a different way and provided arguments to claim that the character did not really die. However, Rowling confirmed on 2 August 2006 that Dumbledore was, in fact, dead, humorously apologising to the website as she did so. Along with DumbledoreIsNotDead.com, a collection of essays, \"Who Killed Albus Dumbledore?: What Really Happened in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince? Six Expert Harry Potter Detectives Examine the Evidence\", was published by Zossima Press in November 2006. In NextMovie.com's \"Harry Potter\" Mega Poll, Dumbledore's death was voted as the most unforgettable moment in the whole series.\nIn the \"Chamber of Secrets\" DVD interview, screenwriter Steve Kloves stated that he considers Dumbledore a fascinating character because of the wisdom he provides, but he feels that \"Dumbledore bears such a tremendous dark burden, and he knows secrets and I think in many ways he bears the weight of the future of the wizard world\" and the \"only way that he can keep that at bay, the darkness, is to be whimsical and humorous\".\nSexuality.\nIn October 2007, while answering reader questions during a book reading at Carnegie Hall, Rowling was asked if Dumbledore had ever been in love. She answered, \"I always thought Dumbledore is gay\". She discussed for the first time his romantic relationship with his rival Gellert Grindelwald, describing it as a \"great tragedy\". She said she had informed David Yates, the director of \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\", of Dumbledore's sexuality by writing a note in the screenplay. She had crossed out a section where Dumbledore describes his attraction to a woman, and had written \"Dumbledore is gay.\" When Yates learned about Dumbledore's sexuality, he recalled thinking it was \"pretty cool\". Michael Gambon, who portrays Dumbledore in six of the eight \"Harry Potter\" films, was reportedly amused by the revelation. Daniel Radcliffe, who plays Harry in the film series, found the news \"hilarious\".\nThe revelation of Dumbledore's sexuality occurred after the publication of the final novel, and made international news. Some gay rights activists and organizations praised Rowling, while others wished she had gone further to promote acceptance of homosexuality. A spokesman for the advocacy group Stonewall applauded the revelation, saying \"It's great that JK has said this. It shows that there's no limit to what gay and lesbian people can do, even being a wizard headmaster.\" The gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell welcomed the news about Dumbledore, but was disappointed that Rowling did not mention his sexuality in the novels. In an editorial for \"The Guardian\", the journalist James Ball wrote that depicting \"the respected, heroic and beloved Albus Dumbledore as [a] fully realised gay character\u2014whose sexuality was merely incidental to his achievements\u2014would have provided a fictional role model like no other. With homophobic bullying still such a significant issue in schools, this is a missed opportunity with a real sting in the tail.\" Writing for \"Time\", John Cloud argued that Dumbledore's silence about his sexuality implies that he is ashamed of it. Cloud claimed this silence \"suggests a lack of personal integrity that is completely out of character\".\nMelissa Anelli, the webmaster of the fan site The Leaky Cauldron, praised the revelation, saying it promoted tolerance towards homosexuality. She added, \"By dubbing someone so respected, so talented and so kind, as someone who just happens to be also homosexual, [Rowling is] reinforcing the idea that a person's gayness is not something of which they should be ashamed.\" Mark Harris of \"Entertainment Weekly\" said Rowling's choice \"to make a beloved professor-mentor gay in a world where gay teachers are still routinely slandered as malign influences was, I am certain, no accident.\" Mike Thomas of the \"Orlando Sentinel\" claimed that Rowling displayed great skill by writing a gay character without labelling him as gay. \nIn a 2016 article, Aja Romano of \"Vox\" observed a critical stance among many \"Harry Potter\" fans towards Rowling's revelation. Romano asserted that because Dumbledore's homosexuality was revealed after his death, certain fans felt that Rowling contributed to a \"longstanding, problematic 'dead gays' trope\" instead of showing the headmaster \"living out his queer identity\". After the release of the film \"\" (2018), Delia Harrington of \"Den of Geek\" criticised the film's failure to mention Dumbledore's homosexuality. She claimed that Rowling, who wrote the screenplay, put Dumbledore back in \"the closet\". In a 2019 opinion piece in \"The Washington Post\", Richard Morgan also expressed frustration that the headmaster is not portrayed as gay in the film. He quoted Matt Collette, the producer of the Nancy podcast, who had discussed the topic in a 2017 episode. Collette called Rowling a \"queerbaiter\", which Collette defined as \"a writer who puts in just enough of a queer story line to appease the fans who'd like one, but not so much as to offend anyone who doesn't like gay people.\"\nEdward Rothstein of \"The New York Times\" questioned whether Dumbledore's sexuality should be considered canon. He said that \"Rowling may think of Dumbledore as gay\" but \"there is no reason why anyone else should\". The student newspaper of East Tennessee State University accused Rowling of lying, claiming her revelation was a publicity stunt. Other critics quoted the Death of the Author principle; they claimed that Rowling's commentary about characters after the novels were published is irrelevant to an understanding of the books.\nIn the third film in the series, \"\" (2022), Dumbledore mentions that he was in love with Grindelwald, and tells other characters about their romantic relationship. After these lines were cut from the film's Chinese release, the filmmakers faced additional criticism from fans.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The most familiar colour variant is the \"British Blue\", with a solid grey-blue coat, copper-coloured eyes, and a medium-sized tail. The breed has also been bred in a wide range of other colours and patterns, including tabby and colourpoint.\nIt ranks among the oldest known cat landraces. This ancient British landrace was selectively bred into one of the first pedigreed cat breeds at the end of the 19th century, and today holds full recognition status in all major cat registries. It remains the most popular pedigreed breed in its native country, as registered by the UK's Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF). Half of all kittens registered with the GCCF each year are British Shorthairs, making the British the most popular pedigree cat in the UK.\nThe breed's relatively calm temperament make it a frequent media star, notably as the inspiration for John Tenniel's famous illustration of the Cheshire Cat from \"Alice in Wonderland\". The Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) profile reads: \"When gracelessness is observed, the British Shorthair is duly embarrassed, quickly recovering with a 'Cheshire cat smile'.\"\nHistory.\nResearchers are not sure how cats first reached the British Isles. In many other parts of Europe, cats became common at the same time as the spread of the Roman Empire. However, it appears that housecats reached the British Isles before the Romans did.\nThese cats then interbred with the local European wildcat population. Over the centuries, their naturally isolated descendants developed into distinctively large, robust cats with a short but very thick coat, to better withstand conditions on their native islands. Based on artists' representations, the modern British Shorthair is unchanged from this initial type.\nSelective breeding of the best examples of the type began in the nineteenth century, with emphasis on developing the unusual blue-grey variant called the \"British Blue\" or \"English type\" (to distinguish it from the more fine-boned \"Russian type\"). Some sources directly credit UK artist and pioneering cat fancier Harrison Weir with the initial concept of standardising the breed. Others suggest a group of breeders may have been involved. The new British Shorthair was featured at the first-ever cat show, organised by Weir and held at the Crystal Palace in London in 1871, and enjoyed great initial popularity.\nBy the 1900s with the advent of the newly imported Persian and other long-haired breeds, the British Shorthair had fallen out of favour, and breeding stock had become critically rare by World War I. At least partially to alleviate this, British Shorthair breeders mixed Persians, Russian Blue, Burmese, and Chartreux into their bloodlines. Part of the genes thus introduced would eventually become the basis for the British Longhair. At the time, any long-haired cats produced were placed into the Persian breeding program. As all cats with the blue colouration were then judged together as variants on a \"de facto\" single breed, the Blue Shorthair, outcrossings of the British with the Russian Blue were also common.\nAfter the war, in an attempt to maintain the breed standard, the GCCF decided to accept only third-generation Persian x British Shorthair crosses. This contributed to another shortage of pure breeding stock by World War II, at which point the Persian and Russian Blue were reintroduced into the mix. \nBritish Shorthair breeders also worked with the French Chartreux, another ancient breed, which although genetically unrelated to the British Blue, is very similar in appearance. Breeders worked to reestablish the true British type, and by the late 1970s the distinctive British Shorthair had achieved full recognition status from all major cat registries, including the CFA, F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale F\u00e9line (FIFe), and The International Cat Association (TICA). According to the GCCF's 2024 registry data, it is once again the most popular pedigreed breed in its native country, accounting for about half of the annually registered kittens. And it has held the title of the UK's most popular cat breed for decades.\nDescription.\nAppearance.\nThe British Shorthair is a relatively powerful-looking, large cat having a broad chest, strong thick-set legs with rounded paws, and a medium-length, blunt-tipped tail. The head is relatively large and rounded, with a short muzzle, broad cheeks (most noticeable in mature males, who tend to develop prominent jowls) and large round eyes that are deep copper orange in the British Blue, and otherwise vary in colour depending on the coat. Their large ears are broad and widely set.\nThey are slow to mature in comparison with most cat breeds, reaching full physical development at approximately three years of age. Unusually among domestic cats, they are a noticeably sexually dimorphic breed, with males averaging and females .\nCoat, colour, and patterns.\nThe British Shorthair's coat is one of the breed's defining features. It is very dense, the texture being plush rather than woolly or fluffy, with a firm, \"crisp\" pile that breaks noticeably over the cat's body as it moves.\nAlthough the \"British Blue\" remains the most familiar variant, British Shorthairs have been developed in many other colours and patterns. White, black, blue, red, cream and\u2014most recently\u2014cinnamon and fawn are accepted by all official standards. The GCCF, FIFe and TICA also accept chocolate and its dilute lilac, disallowed in the CFA standard. All base colours can be affected by the silver and golden genes in the smoke, shaded and tipped variants. These coat colours are present in either a solid or one of the four acknowledged tabby patterns (\"classic, mackerel, spotted,\" and \"ticked tabby\"). All colours and patterns also occur in the variants resulting from the combination with colourpoint, bicolour (white spotting) and/or tortoiseshell.\nCat shows.\nFirst introduced to Britain by the Romans, the British Shorthair was one of the domestic cats originally bred for its hunting prowess. In the last 150 years, breeding has emphasised physical qualities. The British Shorthair breed debuted \u2014 along with a wide range of other selectively bred felines \u2014 in the first organised cat show arranged by Harrison Weir at London's Crystal Palace in 1871. British Shorthairs remained the premiere pedigree at cat shows up until 1895.\nShortly after the British Shorthair exhibit in the Crystal Palace show, the popularity of British Shorthair increased. The public began searching for breeders of British Shorthairs with various character and colour traits, all in the pursuit of \"exoticness\". From the late 19th century to the early 20th century, certain British Shorthairs would occasionally earn notoriety or decorated titles in Cat Competitions. The British Shorthair publicity from 19th and 20th century cat shows helped British Shorthairs become one of the most popular pet cat breeds today. For example, in the 1980s, the British Shorthair was featured in competition by the CFA, which led to an increased demand for British Shorthairs as household pets. As of 2023, the British Shorthair ranks as the 6th most popular cat breed in the United States.\nAs of 2015,[ [update]] the TICA cat show competition standards for British Shorthairs judge the cats for their circular head shape, muzzle, and cheeks. Small to medium ears are desired, with large, round, leveled eyes. Eye shape is more important than colour. The muzzle and chin shape should complement the circular face; the profile and nose should be short, further complementing the circular face. The neck should give the illusion of the cat having no neck, blending in with the cheeks. The body of the cat should have a sturdy and muscular torso, complemented by medium to short legs, finished with round medium to large feet. The tail should be thick at the base and taper to a rounded tip, totaling about two thirds of the body length. The cat should have substantial bone and a firm, sturdy musculature. No preference on colour is stated for the cat's coat, but the coat should be straight, dense, and even in length.\nBritish Longhair.\nThe British Longhair, also known as the Highlander or Highland Straight, is a longhaired variant of the British Shorthair. Some registries such as TICA recognise it as a distinct breed, others such as the GCCF treat it as a variant of the British Shorthair, which may be referred to as simply 'British'.\nThe breed is identical to the British Shorthair aside from its longer and denser coat.\nHealth.\nA UK study looking at veterinary records found a life expectancy of 9.58 years for the British Shorthair and British Longhair compared to 11.74 years overall. Swedish insurance data puts the median lifespan of the breed at &gt;12.5 years. 82% of British Shorthairs lived to 10 years or more, and 54% lived to 12.5 years or more.\nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) can be a problem in the breed. A Danish prevalence study with more than 329 cats showed that 20.4% of males and 2.1% of the females had HCM, with an additional 6.4% of males and 3.5% of females judged to be equivocal.&lt;ref name=\"doi10.1111/j.1939-1676.2011.0751.x\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; HCM testing of males used for breeding is now mandatory for breeders organised under the Danish Fife member, Felis Danica.\nThe breed is thought to be at high risk of polycystic kidney disease (PKD).\nA study of over 190,000 patient records in England found the British Shorthair to be less than half as likely to acquire diabetes mellitus as either moggies or the overall cat population; 0.24% of British Shorthairs were diagnosed with the condition compared to 0.58% for both non-pedigree cats and the overall prevalence.\nCommemoration.\nIn 2022, the British Shorthair was one of eight cats featured on a series of UK postage stamps issued by the Royal Mail.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

K. Rowling. It is the primary setting for the first six novels and films and also serves as a major setting in the \"Wizarding World\" media franchise.\nIn the novels, Hogwarts is described as a coeducational, secondary boarding school that enrolls children from ages eleven to eighteen. According to Rowling, any child in Britain who shows magical ability is invited to attend the school. The Wizarding World website states that Hogwarts was founded in the Highlands of Scotland sometime between the 9th and 10th century by Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw and Salazar Slytherin. Rowling has offered varying accounts of how many students are enrolled at Hogwarts at any given time.\nIn a 1999 interview, Rowling said she envisioned Hogwarts as a place that offers security to the orphaned Harry Potter. She said that she made Hogwarts a boarding school because many important plot events occur at night. Several writers have suggested that Rowling took the name \"Hogwarts\" from the 1954 book \"How to Be Topp\" by Geoffrey Willans. This book describes a fictional play titled \"The Hogwarts\" and a fictional school headmaster named \"Hoggwart\". Rowling, however, said she may have unknowingly derived the name \"Hogwarts\" from the name of the hogwort plant.\nCastle and grounds.\nRowling has described Hogwarts as a \"huge, rambling, quite scary-looking castle, with a jumble of towers and battlements\". She said the castle is supported by magic. The school grounds have sloping lawns, vegetable gardens and greenhouses. There is a pitch for playing the wizard sport Quidditch, and a large wooded area known as the Forbidden Forest. There is also a lake, which is home to merpeople, grindylows and a giant squid. Wizards cannot Apparate (teleport) on Hogwarts grounds, but there are several hidden passages that lead into and out of the school. In \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\" (2000), it is explained that Muggles (non-magical people) cannot see Hogwarts because there are numerous enchantments on it.\nA subterranean area of the castle known as the Chamber of Secrets is introduced in the second novel, \"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\" (1998). In the novel, the young student Ginny Weasley is forced to open the Chamber by the Dark wizard Voldemort. From the Chamber emerges a deadly Basilisk, which attacks students until Harry kills it. A magical room called the &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Room of Requirement is also located in Hogwarts. It only appears when someone needs it, and contains whatever the person requires. In \"Order of the Phoenix\" (2003), Harry holds meetings of his student group Dumbledore's Army in the Room of Requirement. In \"Half-Blood Prince\" (2005), Draco Malfoy uses the room to hide and repair a Vanishing Cabinet, which allows him to smuggle Voldemort's Death Eaters into Hogwarts.\nHouses.\nWhen a first-year student arrives at Hogwarts, the magical Sorting Hat is placed on their head. It examines their mind and assigns them to a House based on their abilities, personality, and preferences. Hogwarts has four Houses, each named after one of the founders of the school. Throughout the school year, the Houses compete for the House Cup, gaining and losing points based on actions such as performance in class and rule violations. The House with the highest end-of-year total wins and has its colours displayed in the Great Hall during the following school year. Each House also has its own Quidditch team that competes for the Quidditch Cup. Each House is under the authority of one of the Hogwarts professors. The four Houses are described below.\nEach year, two fifth-year students from each House are selected as prefects. The position grants them certain privileges and the authority to give detentions for infractions. The leaders of the student body, the head girl and head boy, are chosen from among the seventh-year students. Hogwarts students in their third year or higher are allowed to visit the nearby wizarding village of Hogsmeade.\nHogwarts Express.\nThe Hogwarts Express is described as a steam train that transports students to and from Hogwarts. At the beginning of each school year, the train departs from the fictional Platform 9\u00be at London's King's Cross station and delivers students to Hogsmeade Station. A functioning full-scale replica of the Hogwarts Express was created for The Wizarding World of Harry Potter themed area at Universal Orlando Resort. The train transports visitors from a life-size replica of Hogsmeade Village to a replica of Diagon Alley.\nIn film.\nHogwarts is featured in the \"Harry Potter\" film adaptations. England's Alnwick Castle was used for many scenes depicting exterior parts of the school. Shots of the entire school were created by adding a digital spire to images of Durham Cathedral, which also served as a set for the interior of Hogwarts. A detailed scale model of Hogwarts was also used during production of the films.\nCultural impact.\nIn 2008, the Independent Schools Network Rankings website featured Hogwarts on a list of the best schools in Scotland. Frank Tiarks, the managing director of the website, said Hogwarts was included on the list for fun. It was ranked as the 36th-best school, surpassing Edinburgh's Loretto School.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 3,186,989, making it the third most populous county in California, the sixth most populous in the United States, and more populous than 19 U.S. states and Washington, D.C. Although mostly suburban, it is the second most densely populated county in the state behind San Francisco County. The county's three most populous cities are Anaheim, Santa Ana and Irvine, each of which has a population surpassing 300,000. Santa Ana is also the county seat. Six cities in Orange County lie along the Pacific Coast: Seal Beach, Huntington Beach, Newport Beach, Laguna Beach, Dana Point and San Clemente.\nOrange County is included in the Los Angeles\u2013Long Beach\u2013Anaheim Metropolitan Statistical Area. The county has 34 incorporated cities. Older cities such as Tustin, Santa Ana, Anaheim, Orange and Fullerton have traditional downtowns dating back to the 19th century, while newer commercial development or \"edge cities\" stretch along the Interstate 5 (Santa Ana) Freeway between Disneyland and Santa Ana and between South Coast Plaza and the Irvine Business Complex and cluster at Irvine Spectrum.\nThe county is a tourist center, with attractions such as Disneyland Resort, Knott's Berry Farm, Mission San Juan Capistrano, Huntington Beach Pier, the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum, Orange County Zoo, Modjeska House, Segerstrom Center for the Arts, Yost Theater, Bowers Museum, Balboa Island, Angel Stadium, Downtown Santa Ana, Crystal Cove Historic District, Honda Center, the Old Orange County Courthouse, Orange County Fair, the Irvine Ranch Natural Landmarks, Heritage Hills Historic Park, Ocean Institute and several popular beaches along its more than of coastline. It is also home to a major research university, the University of California, Irvine (UCI), along with a number of other notable colleges and universities such as Chapman University and Cal State Fullerton.\nHistory.\nThe history of Orange County, California, spans thousands of years, beginning with Acjachemen indigenous peoples who lived off the land through hunting, fishing, and gathering. Later, Shoshonean-speaking tribes, including the Juane\u00f1o and Gabrielino, settled in the area. Spanish colonization began in 1769 with expeditions and the establishment of missions like Mission San Juan Capistrano. Under Spanish and later Mexican rule, large land grants formed ranchos, which dominated the economy through cattle ranching.\nOne of the first land grants in Orange County under Spanish Rule was Rancho Santiago de Santa Ana which was given to Jos\u00e9 Antonio Yorba and Juan Pablo Peralta (nephew) in 1810, the year of the commencement of the war of Mexican Independence.\nAfter California became part of the United States in 1850, the Gold Rush spurred demand for beef, boosting the local economy. However, environmental challenges and legal disputes over land ownership led many rancheros to sell their lands, often to American settlers. The first American-founded town, Anaheim, was established in 1857 by German immigrants. Other towns like Santa Ana and Orange soon followed, supported by agriculture and improved irrigation.\nThe arrival of railroads in the 1870s and a real estate boom in the 1880s fueled rapid growth. In 1889, Orange County officially separated from Los Angeles County, with Santa Ana as its seat. Agriculture, especially citrus, dominated until the mid-20th century, alongside oil discoveries and transportation developments like highways and railways.\nWorld War II brought military bases and postwar population growth. By the 1950s, suburban development replaced farmland, and cities rapidly incorporated. The Disneyland Resort 1955 opening marked the rise of tourism.\nIn 1994, Robert Citron was serving as Treasurer-Tax Collector and chose leveraging strategies with county investments that ended in Chapter 9 bankruptcy for the County, costing 3,000 jobs at the county and $1.64 billion in losses.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (16.6%) is water. It is the smallest county by area in Southern California, being just over 40% the size of the region's next smallest county, Ventura. The average annual temperature is about .\nOrange County is bordered on the southwest by the Pacific Ocean, on the north by Los Angeles County, on the northeast by San Bernardino County, on the east by Riverside County, and on the southeast by San Diego County.\nThe northwestern part of the county lies on the coastal plain of the Los Angeles Basin, while the southeastern end rises into the foothills of the Santa Ana Mountains. Most of Orange County's population reside in one of two shallow coastal valleys that lie in the basin, the Santa Ana Valley and the Saddleback Valley. The Santa Ana Mountains lie within the eastern boundaries of the county and of the Cleveland National Forest. The high point is Santiago Peak (), about east of Santa Ana. Santiago Peak and nearby Modjeska Peak, just shorter, form a ridge known as Saddleback, visible from almost everywhere in the county. The Peralta Hills extend westward from the Santa Ana Mountains through the communities of Anaheim Hills, Orange, and ending in Olive. The Loma Ridge is another prominent feature, running parallel to the Santa Ana Mountains through the central part of the county, separated from the taller mountains to the east by Santiago Canyon.\nThe Santa Ana River is the county's principal watercourse, flowing through the middle of the county from northeast to southwest. Its major tributary to the south and east is Santiago Creek. Other watercourses within the county include Aliso Creek, San Juan Creek, and Horsethief Creek. In the North, the San Gabriel River also briefly crosses into Orange County and exits into the Pacific on the Los Angeles-Orange County line between the cities of Long Beach and Seal Beach. Laguna Beach is home to the county's only natural lakes, Laguna Lakes, which are formed by water rising up against an underground fault.\nRegions of Orange County.\nOrange County is sometimes divided into northern and southern regions. There are significant political, demographic, economic and cultural distinctions between North and South Orange County. A popular dividing line between the two regions is the Costa Mesa Freeway.\nNorthern Orange County, including Anaheim, Fullerton, Garden Grove and Santa Ana, was the first part of the county to be developed and is culturally closer to neighboring Los Angeles County. This region is more Hispanic (mostly Mexican) and Asian (predominantly Vietnamese and Korean), more densely populated (Santa Ana is the among the most densely populated cities in the United States), younger, less wealthy and with higher unemployment. It has more renters and fewer homeowners and generally votes Democratic. There are notable exceptions to these general trends, such as strongly Republican Yorba Linda and affluent Anaheim Hills, North Tustin, and Villa Park. Northern Orange County is predominantly flat, giving way to the Santa Ana Mountains in the Northeast.\nSouthern Orange County is wealthier, more residential, more Republican, predominantly non-Hispanic white, and more recently developed. Irvine, the largest city in the region, is an exception to some of these trends, being not only a major employment center, but also a major tech hub and education center with UCI. Furthermore, the city is an Asian plurality (both South and East Asian), and votes reliably Democratic in recent years. Southern Orange County almost always includes Irvine, Newport Beach, and the cities to their southeast, including Lake Forest, Laguna Hills, Laguna Niguel, Laguna Beach, Laguna Woods, Mission Viejo, San Juan Capistrano, Aliso Viejo, and San Clemente.\nAnother region of Orange County is the Orange Coast, which includes the six cities bordering the Pacific Ocean.\nCommercial districts and edge cities.\nOlder cities in North Orange County like Santa Ana, Anaheim, Orange and Fullerton have traditional downtowns dating to the late 19th century, with Downtown Santa Ana being the home of the county, state and federal institutions. However, far more commercial activity is concentrated in clusters of newer commercial development located further south in the county's edge cities which include:\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2020 census.\nFrom the 2020 United States census, Orange County had a population of 3,186,989. \nThe racial makeup of Orange County was 1,383,257 (43.7%) White (37.6% non-Hispanic white), 53,842 (1.7%) African American, 38,322 (1.2%) \nNative American, 706,813 (22.2%) Asian, 9,035 (0.3%) Pacific Islander, 548,539 (17.2%) from other races, and 447,181 (14.0%) from two or more races. \nHispanic or Latino of any race were 1,086,834 persons (34.1%).\n2010.\nThe 2010 United States census reported that Orange County had a population of 3,010,232. The racial makeup of Orange County was 1,830,758 (60.8%) White (44.0% non-Hispanic white), 50,744 (1.7%) African American, 18,132 (0.6%) Native American, 537,804 (17.9%) Asian, 9,354 (0.3%) Pacific Islander, 435,641 (14.5%) from other races, and 127,799 (4.2%) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1,012,973 persons (33.7%).\nThe Hispanic and Latino population is predominantly of Mexican origin; this group accounts for 28.5% of the county's population, followed by Salvadorans (0.8%), Guatemalans (0.5%), Puerto Ricans (0.4%), Cubans (0.3%), Colombians (0.3%), and Peruvians (0.3%). Santa Ana with its population reportedly 75 percent Hispanic/Latino, is among the most Hispanic/Latino percentage cities in both California and the U.S., esp. of Mexican-American descent.\nAmong the Asian population, 6.1% are Vietnamese, followed by Koreans (2.9%), Chinese (2.7%), Filipinos (2.4%), Indians (1.4%), Japanese (1.1%), Cambodians (0.2%), Pakistanis (0.2%), Thais (0.1%), Indonesians (0.1%), and Laotians (0.1%). According to KPCC in 2014, Orange County has the largest proportion of Asian Americans in Southern California, where one in five residents are Asian American. There is also a significant Muslim population in the county.\n2000.\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 2,846,289 people, 935,287 households, and 667,794 families living in the county, making Orange County the second most populous county in California. The population density was 1,392/km2 (3,606/sq\u00a0mi). There were 969,484 housing units at an average density of 474/km2 (1,228/sq\u00a0mi). The racial makeup of the county was 64.8% White, 13.6% Asian, 1.7% African American, 0.7% Native American, 0.3% Pacific Islander, 14.8% from other races, and 4.1% from two or more races. 30.8% were Hispanic or Latino of any race. 8.9% were of German, 6.9% English and 6.0% Irish ancestry according to Census 2000. 58.6% spoke only English at home; 25.3% spoke Spanish, 4.7% Vietnamese, 1.9% Korean, 1.5% Chinese (Cantonese or Mandarin) and 1.2% Tagalog.\nIn 1990, still according to the census there were 2,410,556 people living in the county. The racial makeup of the county was 78.6% White, 10.3% Asian or Pacific Islander, 1.8% African American, 0.5% Native American, and 8.8% from other races. 23.4% were Hispanic or Latino of any race.\nOut of 935,287 households, 37.0% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 55.9% married couples were living together, 10.7% had a female householder with no husband present, and 28.6% were non-families. 21.1% of all households were made up of individuals, and 7.2% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 3.00 and the average family size was 3.48.\nEthnic change has been transforming the population. By 2009, nearly 45 percent of the residents spoke a language other than English at home. Whites now comprise only 45 percent of the population, while the numbers of Hispanics grow steadily, along with Vietnamese, Korean and Chinese families. The percentage of foreign-born residents jumped to 30 percent in 2008 from 6 percent in 1970. The mayor of Irvine, Sukhee Kang, was born in Korea, making him the first Korean-American to run a major American city. \"We have 35 languages spoken in our city,\" Kang observed. The population is diverse age-wise, with 27.0% under the age of 18, 9.4% from 18 to 24, 33.2% from 25 to 44, 20.6% from 45 to 64, and 9.9% 65 years of age or older. The median age is 33 years. For every 100 females, there were 99.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 96.7 males.\nThe median income for a household in the county was $61,899, and the median income for a family was $75,700 (these figures had risen to $71,601 and $81,260 respectively as of a 2007 estimate). Males had a median income of $45,059 versus $34,026 for females. The per capita income for the county was $25,826. About 7.0% of families and 10.3% of the population were below the poverty line, including 13.2% of those under age 18 and 6.2% of those age 65 or over.\nResidents of Orange County are known as \"Orange Countians\".\nIn 2016, The top countries of origin for Orange County's immigrants were Mexico, Vietnam, Korea, the Philippines, China, India, Iran, Japan and El Salvador.\nGovernment.\nThe Government of Orange County is defined and authorized under the California Constitution, California law and the Charter of the County of Orange. Much of the Government of California is in practice the responsibility of local governments such as the Government of Orange County.\nOrange County is a charter county of California; its seat is Santa Ana.\nThe elected offices of the county government consist of the five-member board of supervisors, assessor, auditor-controller, clerk-recorder, district attorney-public administrator, sheriff-coroner, and treasurer-tax collector. Except for the board of supervisors, each of these elected officers are elected by the voters of the entire county and oversee their own county departments.\nA seventh countywide elected officer, the County Superintendent of Schools (jointly with an independently elected County Board of Education) oversees the independent Orange County Department of Education.\nAs of 2025, the Board of Supervisors oversees a $10.8billion annual budget and over 16,000 employees. The county government is managed on a day-to-day basis by a county executive officer and is organized into many departments. Outside of the elected official departments (named above), the board of supervisors manage the following departments: Clerk of the Board, County Counsel, Orange County Ethics Commission, Office of Independent Review and \nInternal Audit. Other major departments are grouped into four categories.\nPublic Protection\nCommunity Services\nInfrastructure &amp; Environmental Resources\nDepartment of Education.\nThe County Department of Education is wholly separate from the County government and is jointly overseen by the elected County Superintendent of Schools and the five-member Orange County Board of Education, whose trustees are popularly elected from five separate trustee areas.\nCounty-level scandals.\nIn October 2024, Supervisor Andrew Do submitted a guilty plea to conspiracy to commit bribery as a result of taking more than $550,000 in bribes for directing and voting in favor of more than $10 million in COVID funds to his daughter's charity. His plea deal included paying back bribes that he and his daughters had received. He was sentenced to 5 years in federal prison.\nOn July 12, 2010, it was revealed that former Sheriff Mike Carona received over $215,000 in pension checks in 2009, despite his felony conviction for attempting to obstruct a grand jury investigation. A 2005 state law denied a public pension to public officials convicted of wrongdoing in office, however, that law only applied to benefits accrued after December 2005. Carona became eligible for his pension at age 50, and is also entitled, by law, to medical and dental benefits. The county pension program continues to pay out his pension through 2023.\nPolitics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPolitical history.\nFrom the mid-20th century until the 2010s, Orange County was known as a Republican stronghold and consistently sent Republican representatives to the state and federal legislatures\u2014so strongly that Ronald Reagan described it as the place that \"all the good Republicans go to die.\" It was one of five counties in the state that voted for Barry Goldwater in 1964. During most of the 20th century and up until 2016, Orange County was known for its political conservatism and for being a bastion for the Republican Party, with a 2005 academic study listing three Orange County cities as among America's 25 most conservative. Orange County's Republican registration reached its apex in 1991, 55.6% of registered voters. But with the 2008 election it began trending Democratic until Hillary Clinton won the county with an eight-point majority in 2016.\nHillary Clinton became the first Democrat since 1936 to carry Orange County in a presidential election and in the 2018 midterm elections the Democratic Party gained control of every Congressional seat in the county. Although Democrats controlled all congressional districts in Orange County at the time, Republicans maintained a lead in voter registration numbers (although it shrunk to less than a percentage point as of February 10, 2019, as compared with over 10% on February 10, 2013). The number of registered Democrats surpassed the number of registered Republicans in the county in August 2019. As the number of Democrats increased, the number of voters not aligned with a political party increased to comprise 27.4% of the county's voters in 2019. Republicans held a majority on the county Board of Supervisors until 2022, when Democrats established a 3\u20132 control of the body. Seven out of the 12 state legislators from Orange County are also Republicans.\nIn 2020, Joe Biden further improved slightly on Clinton's 2016 margin of victory. In 2023, the Republican party's registration was 33%, while the Democratic party's registration was 37.5%. In 2024, Orange County again voted for the Democratic nominee and California native Kamala Harris, though Harris only won a plurality by a smaller margin than Biden or Hillary Clinton. Orange County is one of six \"reverse pivot counties\", counties that voted Republican in 2008 and 2012 before voting Democratic in 2016 onward.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Hidden begin/styles.css\"/&gt;Gubernatorial elections results\nThe Republican margin began to narrow in the 1990s and 2000s as the state trended Democratic until the mid- to late-2010s when it voted for the Democratic Party in 2016 and in 2018, when the Democratic party won every United States House District anchored in the county, including four that had previously been held by Republicans. This prompted media outlets to declare Orange County's Republican leanings \"dead\", with the \"Los Angeles Times\" running an op-ed titled, \"An obituary to old Orange County, dead at age 129.\" While Republicans were able to recapture two of the seven U.S. House seats in Orange County in 2020, Democrats continued to hold the other five, Biden won the county by a slightly greater margin than Clinton had, and Democrats received a majority of the votes in each of the seven congressional districts. Republicans still carry more weight at the local level, and in 2020 for the State Assembly elections, they won 50.2% of the vote and four out of seven seats of the county. In the 2022 midterm elections, no congressional districts flipped, though Republicans performed strongly in Orange County, with every statewide GOP candidate carrying it.\nFor the 119th United States Congress in the United States House of Representatives, Orange County is split between six congressional districts:\nThe 40th, 45th, 46th, and 47th districts are all centered in Orange County. The 38th has its population center in Los Angeles County, while the 49th is primarily San Diego County-based.\n132, 154, 188\nIn the California State Senate, Orange County is split into 6 districts:\nIn the California State Assembly, Orange County is split into 9 districts:\nOverview.\nAccording to the California Secretary of State, as of February 10, 2019, Orange County has 1,591,543 registered voters. Of these, 34% (541,711) are registered Republicans, and 33.3% (529,651) are registered Democrats. An additional 28.5% (453,343) declined to state a political party.\nOrange County has produced notable Republicans, such as President Richard Nixon (born in Yorba Linda and lived in Fullerton and San Clemente), U.S. Senator John F. Seymour (previously mayor of Anaheim), and U.S. Senator Thomas Kuchel (of Anaheim). Former Congressman Christopher Cox (of Newport Beach), a White House counsel for President Reagan, is also a former chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Orange County was also home to former Republican Congressman John G. Schmitz, a presidential candidate in 1972 from the ultra-conservative American Independent Party, John Birch Society member, and the father of Mary Kay Letourneau. In 1996, Curt Pringle (later mayor of Anaheim) became the first Republican Speaker of the California State Assembly in decades.\nWhile the growth of the county's Hispanic and Asian populations in recent decades has significantly influenced Orange County's culture, its conservative reputation has remained largely intact. Partisan voter registration patterns of Hispanics, Asians and other ethnic minorities in the county have tended to reflect the surrounding demographics, with resultant Republican majorities in all but the central portion of the county. When Loretta Sanchez, a Blue Dog Democrat, defeated veteran Republican Bob Dornan in 1996, she was continuing a trend of Democratic representation of that district that had been interrupted by Dornan's 1984 upset of former Congressman Jerry Patterson. Until 1992, Sanchez herself was a moderate Republican, and she is viewed as somewhat more moderate than other Democrats from Southern California.\nThe county is featured prominently in Lisa McGirr's book \"Suburban Warriors: The Origins of the New American Right\". She argues that its conservative political orientation in the 20th century owed much to its settlement by farmers from the Great Plains, who reacted strongly to communist sympathies, the civil rights movement, and the turmoil of the 1960s in nearby Los Angeles \u2014 across the \"Orange Curtain\". In the 1970s and 1980s, Orange County was one of California's leading Republican voting blocs and a subculture of residents with \"Middle American\" values that emphasized capitalist religious morality in contrast to West coast liberalism.\nOrange County has many Republican voters from culturally conservative Asian-American, Middle Eastern and Latino immigrant groups. The large Vietnamese-American communities in Garden Grove and Westminster are predominantly Republican; Vietnamese Americans registered Republicans outnumber those registered as Democrats, 55% to 22% as of 2007, while as of 2017 that figure is 42% to 36%. Republican Assemblyman Van Tran was the first Vietnamese-American elected to a state legislature and joined with Texan Hubert Vo as the highest-ranking elected Vietnamese-American in the United States until the 2008 election of Joseph Cao in Louisiana's 2nd congressional district. In the 2007 special election for the vacant county supervisor seat following Democrat Lou Correa's election to the state senate, two Vietnamese-American Republican candidates topped the list of 10 candidates, separated from each other by only seven votes, making the Orange County Board of Supervisors entirely Republican; Correa is first of only two Democrats to have served on the Board since 1987 and only the fifth since 1963.\nEven with the Democratic sweep of Orange County's congressional seats in 2018, as well as a steady trend of Democratic gains in voter registration, the county remains very Republican downballot. Generally, larger cities\u2013those with a population over 100,000, such as Anaheim, Santa Ana, and Irvine \u2013 feature a registration advantage for Democrats, while the other municipalities still have a Republican voter registration advantage. This is especially true in Newport Beach, Yorba Linda, and Villa Park, the three cities where the Republican advantage is largest. As of February 10, 2019, the only exceptions to the former are Huntington Beach and Orange, while exceptions to the latter include Buena Park, Laguna Beach and Stanton.\nSimilarly, despite Orange County supporting Democratic candidates for president in 2016, and 2020, there are still several smaller municipalities in the county that have continued to vote Republican for president. In addition to the aforementioned Newport Beach, Yorba Linda, and Villa Park, the cities of Huntington Beach, Dana Point, San Juan Capistrano, and San Clemente also supported Republican nominee Donald Trump for president twice.\nEducation.\nOrange County is the home of many colleges and universities, including:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSome institutions not based in Orange County operate satellite campuses, including the University of Southern California, National University, Pepperdine University, and Springfield College.\nThe Orange County Department of Education oversees 28 school districts.\nEconomy.\nBusiness.\nOrange County is the headquarters of many Fortune 1000 companies including Ingram Micro (#95) in Irvine, Pacific Life (#272) and Chipotle Mexican Grill (#372) in Newport Beach, Edwards Lifesciences (#566) in Irvine, and First American Corporation (#570) in Santa Ana. Other headquarters in Orange County include medical device companies Beckman Coulter in Brea and Masimo in Irvine, and the staffing company Allied Universal in Santa Ana.

There are two major outlet malls, The Outlets at Orange and The Outlets at San Clemente.\nTourism.\nTourism remains a vital aspect of Orange County's economy. Anaheim is the main tourist hub, with the Disneyland Resort's Disneyland being the second most visited theme park in the world. Also, Knott's Berry Farm gets about 7\u00a0million visitors annually and is located in the city of Buena Park. The Anaheim Convention Center holds many major conventions throughout the year. Resorts within the Beach Cities receive visitors throughout the year due to their close proximity to the beach, biking paths, mountain hiking trails, golf courses, shopping and dining.\nArts and culture.\nThe area's warm Mediterranean climate and of year-round beaches attract millions of tourists annually. Huntington Beach is a hot spot for sunbathing and surfing; nicknamed Surf City USA, it is home to many surfing competitions. \"The Wedge\", at the tip of The Balboa Peninsula in Newport Beach, is one of the most famous body surfing spots in the world. Southern California surf culture is prominent in Orange County's beach cities. Another one of these beach cities being Laguna Beach, just south of Newport Beach. A few popular beaches include A Thousand Steps on 9th Street, Main Street Beach, and The Montage.\nOther tourist destinations include the theme parks Disneyland Park and Disney California Adventure Park in Anaheim and Knott's Berry Farm in Buena Park. Due to the 2022 reopening of Wild Rivers in Irvine, the county is home to three water parks along with Soak City in Buena Park and Great Wolf Lodge in Anaheim. The Anaheim Convention Center is the largest such facility on the West Coast. The Old Towne, Orange Historic District in the City of Orange (the traffic circle at the middle of Chapman Avenue at Glassell Street) still maintains its 1950s image, and appeared in the movie \"That Thing You Do!\".\nLittle Saigon is another tourist destination, home to the largest concentration of Vietnamese people outside Vietnam. There are also sizable Taiwanese, Filipino, Chinese, and Korean communities, particularly in western Orange County. This is evident in several Asian-influenced shopping centers in Asian American hubs like Irvine. Popular food festival 626 Night Market has a location at OC Fair &amp; Event Center in Costa Mesa and is a popular attraction for Asian and fusion food, as well as an Art Walk and live entertainment.\nHistorical points of interest include Mission San Juan Capistrano, the destination of migrating swallows.

It was also the shooting location for Pro Beach Hockey. USA Water Polo, Inc. has moved its headquarters to Irvine, California. Orange County's active outdoor culture is home to many surfers, skateboarders, mountain bikers, cyclists, climbers, hikers, kayaking, sailing and sand volleyball.\nThe Major League Baseball team in Orange County is the Los Angeles Angels. The team won the World Series under manager Mike Scioscia in 2002. In 2005, new owner Arte Moreno wanted to change the name to \"Los Angeles Angels\" in order to better tap into the Los Angeles media market, the second largest in the country. However, the standing agreement with the city of Anaheim demanded that they have \"Anaheim\" in the name, so they became the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. This name change was hotly disputed by the city of Anaheim, but the change stood, which prompted a lawsuit by the city of Anaheim against Arte Moreno, won by the latter. Prior to the 2016 season Moreno and the club officially dropped the Anaheim moniker now simply going by the Los Angeles Angels.\nThe county's National Hockey League team, the Anaheim Ducks, won the 2007 Stanley Cup beating the Ottawa Senators. They also came close to winning the 2003 Stanley Cup finals after losing in Game 7 against the New Jersey Devils.\nThe Toshiba Classic, the only PGA Champions Tour event in the area, is held each March at The Newport Beach Country Club. Past champions include Fred Couples (2010), Hale Irwin (1998 and 2002), Nick Price (2011), Bernhard Langer (2008) and Jay Haas (2007). The tournament benefits the Hoag Hospital Foundation and has raised over $16\u00a0million in its first 16 years.\nOrange County SC is a United Soccer League team and are the only professional soccer club in Orange County. The team's first season was in 2011 and it was successful as Charlie Naimo's team made it to the quarter-finals of the playoffs. With home games played at Championship Soccer Stadium in Orange County Great Park the team looks to grow in the Orange County community and reach continued success. Former and current Orange County SC players include Richard Chaplow, Bright Dike, Maykel Galindo, Carlos Borja, and goalkeeper Amir Abedzadeh.\nProfessional football made its debut in 1960 when the Los Angeles Chargers of the American Football League held their inaugural training camp at Chapman University, then known as Chapman College. In 1966, the AFL considered expansion into the Southern California market and staged a doubleader exhibition at the newly-opened Anaheim Stadium. A year later, the National Football League's Los Angeles Rams began holding one preseason game at The Big A for the next three seasons before making a permanent move in time for the 1980 season. Though the team had some success, the Rams stayed for only 15 years before relocating to St. Louis in 1995.\nThe National Basketball Association's Los Angeles Clippers played some home games at The Arrowhead Pond, now known as the Honda Center, from 1994 to 1999, before moving to Staples Center (now Crypto.com Arena), which they shared with the Los Angeles Lakers. In 2011, a relocation bid was launched by the Sacramento Kings to move to Anaheim, but the effort was denied in a vote by the NBA Board of Governors and the franchise ultimately remained in Sacramento.\nMedia.\nOrange County is served by media in Los Angeles, including its TV and radio stations. Two television stations\u2014KOCE-TV, the main PBS member station in the Southland and KDOC-TV, a Tri-State Christian Television (TCT) owned-and-operated station\u2014are located in Orange County.\nThere are a few radio stations that are actually located in Orange County.

A few communities are served by the \"Los Angeles Times\"' publication of the \"Daily Pilot\". \"Orange Coast\" was established in 1974 and is the oldest continuously published lifestyle magazine in the region. \"OC Music Magazine\" is also based out of Orange County, serving local musicians and artists.\nThe \"Orange County Plain Dealer\" (January 1898 to May 8, 1925), was a mostly Anaheim-based newspaper, and successor to \"The Independent\", bought by James E. Valjean, a Republican and edited by him, a former editor of the Portsmouth Blade (Ohio).\nOther newspapers were: \"Anaheim Daily Herald\", \"Anaheim Gazette\", \"Anaheim Bulletin\".\nTransportation.\nTransit in Orange County is offered primarily by the Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA). OCTA manages the county's bus network and funds the construction and maintenance of local streets, highways, and freeways; regulates taxicab services; maintains express toll lanes through the median of California State Route 91; and works with Southern California's Metrolink to provide commuter rail service along three lines: the Orange County Line, the 91/Perris Valley Line, and the Inland Empire\u2013Orange County Line, along with owning the land on which the Surf Line rests upon from the county line just north of Trestles Bridge until the wye adjacent to Fullerton Station.\nMajor highways.\nGround transportation in Orange County relies heavily on three major interstate highways: the Santa Ana Freeway (I-5), the San Diego Freeway (I-405 and I-5 south of Irvine), and the San Gabriel River Freeway (I-605), which briefly passes through northwestern Orange County. The other freeways in the county are state highways, and include the Riverside and Artesia Freeway (SR 91) and the Garden Grove Freeway (SR 22) running east\u2013west, and the Orange Freeway (SR 57), the Costa Mesa Freeway (SR 55), the Laguna Freeway (SR 133), the San Joaquin Transportation Corridor (SR 73), the Eastern Transportation Corridor (SR 261, SR 133, SR 241), and the Foothill Transportation Corridor (SR 241) running north\u2013south. Minor stub freeways include the Richard M. Nixon Freeway (SR 90), also known as Imperial Highway, and the southern terminus of Pacific Coast Highway (SR 1). There are no U.S. Highways in Orange County, though two existed in the county until the mid-1960s: 91 and 101. US 91 went through what is now the state route of the same number, and US 101 was replaced by Interstate 5. SR 1 was once a bypass of US 101 (Route 101A).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nBus.\nThe bus network comprises 6,542 stops on 51 lines, running along most major streets, and accounts for 210,000 boardings a day. The fleet of 508 buses is gradually being replaced by CNG (Compressed natural gas)-powered vehicles and electric powered buses, which already represent over 70% of the total fleet. Service is operated by OCTA employees and First Transit under contract. OCTA operates four bus rapid transit service, Rapid, on Harbor Boulevard, Beach Boulevard, Main St and 17th/Westminister. In addition, OCTA offers paratransit service for the disabled (OC ACCESS), also operated by MV. OCTA offers OC flex for the rural areas of Orange County.\nRail.\nSince 1992, Metrolink has operated three commuter rail lines through Orange County, and has also maintained Rail-to-Rail service with parallel Amtrak service. On a typical weekday, over 40 trains run along the Orange County Line, the 91/Perris Valley Line and the Inland Empire\u2013Orange County Line. Along with Metrolink riders on parallel Amtrak lines, these lines generate approximately 15,000 boardings per weekday. Metrolink also began offering weekend service on the Orange County Line and the Inland Empire-Orange County line in the summer of 2006. As ridership has steadily increased in the region, new stations have opened at Anaheim Canyon, Buena Park, Tustin, and Laguna Niguel/Mission Viejo. Plans for a future station in Placentia are underway and is expected to be completed by 2020.\nSince 1938, the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroad and later Amtrak, has operated the \"Pacific Surfliner\" regional passenger train route (previously named the \"San Diegan\" until 2000) through Orange County. The route includes stops at eight stations in Orange County including, in northbound order, San Clemente Pier (selected trips), San Juan Capistrano, Laguna Niguel/Mission Viejo (formerly), Irvine Transportation Center, Santa Ana Regional Transportation Center, Orange (formerly), Anaheim Regional Transportation Intermodal Center (ARTIC), and Fullerton Transportation Center.\nOC Streetcar, formerly known as the Santa Ana/Garden Grove Fixed Guideway Project, is a streetcar line connecting Downtown Santa Ana to the Depot at Santa Ana which is currently under construction and expected to open in 2026. OCTA has also proposed connecting the two systems via Harbor Boulevard and the West Santa Ana Branch corridor. Plans for a streetcar for Harbor Boulevard in Fullerton, Anaheim, and Garden Grove \u2014 the Anaheim Rapid Connection \u2014 were shelved in 2018.\nSea.\nA car and passenger ferry service, the Balboa Island Ferry, comprising three ferries running every five minutes, operates within Newport Harbor between Balboa Peninsula and Balboa Island in Newport Beach. The Catalina Flyer connects the Balboa Peninsula to Avalon with daily round-trip passage through about nine months of the year. The Catalina Express connects Dana Point to Avalon (with departures from two greater Long Beach ports also connecting to Two Harbors).\nAir.\nOrange County's only major airport is John Wayne Airport; its abbreviation (SNA) refers to Santa Ana, the closest large town in the early 20th century. The airport is located in unincorporated territory surrounded by Newport Beach, Costa Mesa, and Irvine. On destination monitors with flights to SNA, the airport is usually described as \"Orange County, CA\" or \"Santa Ana/Orange County\". In 2014, its Thomas F. Riley Terminal handled over 9\u00a0million passengers annually and as of 2019, seven airline brands provide scheduled service. Los Angeles International Airport, is frequently used by Orange County residents which provides more domestic and international destinations.\nCommunities.\nCities.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nUnincorporated communities.\nThese communities are outside city limits in unincorporated county territory.\nPlanned communities.\nOrange County has a history of large planned communities. Nearly 30 percent of the county was created as master planned communities, the most notable being the City of Irvine, Coto de Caza, Anaheim Hills, Tustin Ranch, Tustin Legacy, Ladera Ranch, Talega, Rancho Santa Margarita, and Mission Viejo. Irvine is often referred to as a model master-planned city because its original seven villages (College Park, The Colony, The Ranch, Culverdale, The Racket Club, University Park, and Turtle Rock) were laid out by the Irvine Company of the mid-1960s before it was bought by a group of investors including Donald Bren.\nIn culture.\nOrange County has been the setting for numerous written works and motion pictures, as well as a popular location for shooting motion pictures.\nThe city of San Juan Capistrano is where writer Johnston McCulley set the first novella about Zorro, \"The Curse of Capistrano\". It was published in 1919 and later renamed \"The Mark of Zorro\". Science fiction novels set in Orange County include \"A Scanner Darkly\" (1977) by Philip K.

{"id": "45332", "revid": "47571603", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45332", "title": "Gresham's law", "text": "Monetary principle\nIn economics, Gresham's law is a monetary principle stating that \"bad money drives out good\". For example, if there are two coins in circulation containing metal of different value, which are accepted by law as having similar face value, the more valuable coin based on the inherent value of its component metals will gradually disappear from circulation.\nThe law was named in 1857 by economist Henry Dunning Macleod after Sir Thomas Gresham (1519\u20131579), an English financier during the Tudor dynasty. Gresham had urged Queen Elizabeth to restore confidence in the then-debased English currency.\nThe concept was thoroughly defined in Renaissance Europe by Nicolaus Copernicus and known centuries earlier in classical Antiquity, the Near East and China.\n\"Good money\" and \"bad money\".\nUnder Gresham's law, \"good money\" is money that shows little difference between its nominal value (the face value of the coin) and its melt value (the intrinsic value of the metal item based on solely market value of the metal of which it is made, often precious metals, such as gold or silver).\nThe price spread between face value and commodity value when it is minted is called seigniorage. As some coins do not circulate, remaining in the possession of coin collectors, this can increase demand for coinage.\nOn the other hand, \"bad money\" is money that has a commodity value considerably lower than its face value and is in circulation along with good money, where both forms are required to be accepted at equal value as legal tender.\nIn Gresham's day, bad money included any coin that had been debased. Debasement was often done by the issuing body, where less than the officially specified amount of precious metal was contained in an issue of coinage, usually by alloying it with a base metal. The public could also debase coins, usually by clipping or scraping off small portions of the precious metal, also known as \"stemming\" (reeded edges on coins were intended to make clipping evident). Other examples of bad money include counterfeit coins made from base metal. Today virtually all circulating coins are made from base metals, often the cheapest available, durable base metal; collectively these monies are known as fiat money. While virtually all contemporary coinage is composed solely of base metals, there have been periods during the 21st century in which the market values of some base metals, like copper, have been high enough that at least one common coin (the U.S. nickel) still maintained \"good money\" status.\nIn the case of clipped, scraped, or counterfeit coins, the commodity value was reduced by fraud. The face value remains at the previous higher level. On the other hand, with a coinage debased by a government issuer, the commodity value of the coinage was often reduced quite openly, while the face value of the debased coins was held at the higher level by legal tender laws.\nThe old saying, \"a bad penny always turns up\" is a colloquial recognition of Gresham's law.\nTheory.\nThe law states that any circulating currency consisting of both \"good\" and \"bad\" money (both forms required to be accepted at equal value under legal tender law) quickly becomes dominated by the \"bad\" money. This is because people spending money will hand over the \"bad\" coins rather than the \"good\" ones, keeping the \"good\" ones for themselves. Legal tender laws act as a form of price control. In such a case, the intrinsically less valuable money is preferred in exchange, because people prefer to save the intrinsically more valuable money.\nImagine that a customer with several silver sixpence coins purchases an item which costs five pence. Some of the customer's coins are more debased, while others are less so \u2013 but legally, they are all mandated to be of equal value. The customer would prefer to retain the better coins, and so offers the shopkeeper the most debased one. In turn, the shopkeeper must give one penny in change, and has every reason to give the most debased penny. Thus, the coins that circulate in the transaction will tend to be of the most debased sort available to the parties.\nIf \"good\" coins have a face value below that of their metallic content, individuals may be motivated to melt them down and sell the metal for its higher intrinsic value, even if such destruction is illegal. The 1965 United States half-dollar coins contained 40% silver; in previous years these coins were 90% silver (.900, or \"one nine fine\"). With the release of the 1965 half-dollar, which was legally required to be accepted at the same value as the earlier 90% halves, the older 90% silver coinage quickly disappeared from circulation, while the newer debased coins remained in use. As the value of the dollar (Federal Reserve notes) continued to decline, resulting in the value of the silver content exceeding the face value of the coins, many of the older half dollars were melted down or removed from circulation and into private collections and hoards. Beginning in 1971, the U.S. government abandoned including any silver in half dollars. The metal value of the 40% silver coins began to exceed their face value, which resulted in a repeat of the previous event. The 40% silver coins also began to vanish from circulation and into coin hoards.\nA similar situation occurred in 2007 in the United States with the rising price of copper, zinc, and nickel, which led the U.S. government to ban the melting or mass exportation of one-cent and five-cent coins.\nIn addition to being melted down for its bullion value, money that is considered to be \"good\" tends to leave an economy through international trade. International traders are not bound by legal tender laws as citizens of the issuing country are, so they will offer higher value for good coins than bad ones. The good coins may leave their country of origin to become part of international trade, escaping that country's legal tender laws and leaving the \"bad\" money behind. This occurred in Britain during the period of adoption of the gold standard: In 1717 Isaac Newton, then Master of the Mint, declared the gold guinea to be worth 21 silver shillings. This overvalued the gold guinea in Britain, making it \"bad\", and encouraged people to send \"good\" silver shillings abroad, where it could buy more gold than at home. This gold was then minted as currency, which bought silver shillings, which were sent abroad for gold, and so on. For a century hardly any silver coins were minted in Britain, and Britain moved onto a \"de facto\" gold standard.\nAustrian economist Hans-Hermann Hoppe said that \"so-called Gresham's law\" only applies under certain conditions, largely a result of governmental interventionist policies. In his 2021 book, \"Economy, Society, and History\" Hoppe states:You might have heard about the so-called Gresham's law, which states that bad money drives out good money, but this law only holds if there are price controls in effect, only if the exchange ratios of different monies are fixed and no longer reflect market forces. Is it the case that bad money drives out good money under normal circumstances without any interference? No, for money holds to exactly the same law that holds for every other good. Good goods drive out bad goods. Good money drives out bad money, so this bezant was for something like 800 years considered to be the best money available and was preferred by merchants from India to Rome to the Baltic Sea.\nHistory of the concept.\nGresham was not the first to state the law which took his name. The phenomenon had been noted by Aristophanes in his play \"The Frogs\", which dates from around the end of the 5th century BC. The referenced passage from \"The Frogs\" is as follows (usually dated at 405 BC):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAccording to Ben Tamari, the currency devaluation phenomenon was already recognized in ancient sources. He brings some examples which include the Machpela Cave transaction and the building of the Temple from the Bible and the Mishna in tractate Bava Metzia () from the Talmud.\nIn China, Yuan dynasty economic authors Yeh Shih and Yuan Hsieh (c. 1223) were aware of the same phenomenon.\nIbn Taimiyyah (1263\u20131328) described the phenomenon as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If the ruler cancels the use of a certain coin and mints another kind of money for the people, he will spoil the riches (amwal) which they possess, by decreasing their value as the old coins will now become merely a commodity. He will do injustice to them by depriving them of the higher values originally owned by them. Moreover, if the intrinsic values of coins are different it will become a source of profit for the wicked to collect the small (bad) coins and exchange them (for good money) and then they will take them to another country and shift the small (bad) money of that country (to this country). So (the value of) people's goods will be damaged.\nNotably this passage mentions only the flight of good money abroad and says nothing of its disappearance due to hoarding or melting. Palestinian economist Adel Zagha also attributes a similar concept to medieval Islamic thinker Al-Maqrizi (1364\u20131442), who offered, claims Zagha, a close approximation to what would become known as Gresham's law centuries later.\nIn the 14th century it was noted by Nicole Oresme c.\u20091350, in his treatise \"On the Origin, Nature, Law, and Alterations of Money\", and by jurist and historian Al-Maqrizi in the Mamluk Empire.\nJohannes de Strigys, an agent of Ludovico III Gonzaga, Marquis of Mantua in Venice, wrote in a June 1472 report (\"that the bad money will chase out the good\").\nIn the year that Gresham was born, 1519, it was described by Nicolaus Copernicus in a treatise called : \"bad (debased) coinage drives good (un-debased) coinage out of circulation\". Copernicus was aware of the practice of exchanging bad coins for good ones and melting down the latter or sending them abroad, and he seems to have drawn up some notes on this subject while he was at Olsztyn in 1519. He made them the basis of a report which he presented to the Prussian Diet held in 1522, attending the session with his friend Tiedemann Giese to represent his chapter. Copernicus's was an enlarged, Latin version of that report, setting forth a general theory of money for the 1528 diet. He also formulated a version of the quantity theory of money. For this reason, it is occasionally known as the Gresham\u2013Copernicus law.\nSir Thomas Gresham, a 16th century financial agent of the English Crown in the city of Antwerp, was one in a long series of proponents of the law, which he did to explain to Queen Elizabeth I what was happening to the English shilling. Her father, Henry VIII, had replaced 40% of the silver in the coin with base metals, to increase the government's income without raising taxes. Astute English merchants and ordinary subjects saved the good shillings from pure silver and circulated the bad ones. Hence, the bad money would be used whenever possible, and the good coinage would be saved and disappear from circulation.\nAccording to the economist George Selgin in his paper \"Gresham's Law\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;As for Gresham himself, he observed \"that good and bad coin cannot circulate together\" in a letter written to Queen Elizabeth on the occasion of her accession in 1558. The statement was part of Gresham's explanation for the \"unexampled state of badness\" that England's coinage had been left in following the \"Great Debasements\" of Henry VIII and Edward VI, which reduced the metallic value of English silver coins to a small fraction of what it had been at the time of Henry VII. Owing to these debasements, Gresham observed to the Queen, that \"all your fine gold was convayed out of this your realm\".\nGresham made his observations of good and bad money while in the service of Queen Elizabeth, with respect only to the observed poor quality of British coinage. Earlier monarchs, Henry VIII and Edward VI, had forced the people to accept debased coinage by means of legal tender laws. Gresham also made his comparison of good and bad money where the precious metal in the money was the same metal, but of different weight. He did not compare silver to gold, or gold to paper.\nIn his \"Gresham's Law\" article, Selgin also offers the following comments regarding the origin of the name:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The expression \"Gresham's Law\" dates back only to 1858, when British economist Henry Dunning Macleod (1858, pp. 476\u20138) decided to name the tendency for bad money to drive good money out of circulation after Sir Thomas Gresham (1519\u20131579). However, references to such a tendency, sometimes accompanied by discussion of conditions promoting it, occur in various medieval writings, most notably Nicholas Oresme's (c. 1357) \"Treatise on money\". The concept can be traced to ancient works, including Aristophanes' \"The Frogs\", where the prevalence of bad politicians is attributed to forces similar to those favoring bad money over good.\nReverse of Gresham's law (Thiers' law).\nThe experiences of dollarization in countries with weak economies and currencies (such as Israel in the 1980s, Eastern Europe and countries in the period immediately after the collapse of the Soviet bloc, or Ecuador throughout the late 20th and early 21st century) may be seen as Gresham's law operating in its reverse form (Guidotti &amp; Rodriguez, 1992) because in general, the dollar has not been legal tender in such situations, and in some cases, its use has been illegal.\nAdam Fergusson (in: ) and Costantino Bresciani-Turroni (in , published in 1931) pointed out that, during the great inflation in the Weimar Republic in 1923, as the official money became so worthless that virtually nobody would take it, people simply stopped accepting the currency in exchange for goods. That was particularly serious because farmers began to hoard food. Accordingly, any currency backed by any sort of value became a circulating medium of exchange. In 2009, hyperinflation in Zimbabwe began to show similar characteristics.\nThose examples show that in the absence of effective legal tender laws, Gresham's law works in reverse. If given the choice of what money to accept, people will accept the money they believe to be of highest long-term value, and not accept what they believe to be of low long-term value. If not given the choice and required to accept all money, good and bad, they will tend to keep the money of greater perceived value in their own possession and pass the bad money to others.\nIn short, in the absence of legal tender laws, the seller will not accept anything but money of certain value (good money), but the existence of legal tender laws will cause the buyer to offer only money with the lowest commodity value (bad money), as the creditor must accept such money at face value.\nNobel Prize winner Robert Mundell believes that Gresham's law could be more accurately rendered, taking care of the reverse, if it were expressed as: \"Bad money drives out good \"if they exchange for the same price\".\"\nThe reverse of Gresham's law, that good money drives out bad money whenever the bad money becomes nearly worthless, has been named \"Thiers' law\" by economist Peter Bernholz in honor of French politician and historian Adolphe Thiers. \"Thiers' Law will only operate later [in the inflation] when the increase of the new flexible exchange rate and of the rate of inflation lower the real demand for the inflating money.\"\nAnalogs in other fields.\nThe principles of Gresham's law can sometimes be applied to different fields of study. Gresham's law may be generally applied to any circumstance in which the true value of something is markedly different from the value people are required to accept, due to factors such as lack of information or governmental decree.\nFormer United States Vice President Spiro Agnew used Gresham's law in describing American news media, stating that \"Bad news drives out good news\", although his argument was closer to that of a race to the bottom for higher ratings rather than over- and under-valuing certain kinds of news.\nGregory Bateson postulated an analogue to Gresham's law operating in cultural evolution, in which \"the oversimplified ideas will always displace the sophisticated and the vulgar and hateful will always displace the beautiful. And yet the beautiful persists.\"\nIn the market for used cars, lemon automobiles (analogous to bad currency) will drive out the good cars. The problem is one of asymmetry of information. Sellers have a strong financial incentive to pass all used cars off as good cars, especially lemons. This makes it difficult to buy a good car at a fair price, as the buyer risks overpaying for a lemon. The result is that buyers will only pay the fair price of a lemon, so at least they reduce the risk of overpaying. High-quality cars tend to be pushed out of the market, because there is no good way to establish that they really are worth more. Certified pre-owned programs are an attempt to mitigate this problem by providing a warranty and other guarantees of quality. \"The Market for Lemons\" is a work that examines this problem in more detail.\nCory Doctorow wrote that a similar effect to Gresham's law occurred in carbon offset trading. The alleged information asymmetry is that people find it difficult to distinguish just how effective credits purchased are, but can easily tell the price. As a result, cheap credits that are ineffective can displace expensive but worthwhile carbon credits. The example given was The Nature Conservancy offering cheap, yet \"meaningless\", carbon credits by purchasing cheap land unlikely to be logged anyway, rather than expensive and valuable land at risk of logging.\nA corollary, Hughes' law, exists in moral philosophy, stating that, \"The evil acts of bad men elicit from better men acts which, under better circumstances, would also be called evil.\"\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "45333", "revid": "199747", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45333", "title": "Magna Graecia", "text": "Historical region of Italy\nMagna Graecia was the historical Greek-speaking area of southern Italy. It encompassed the modern Italian regions of Calabria, Apulia, Basilicata, Campania, and Sicily. These regions were extensively settled by Greeks beginning in the 8th century BC.\nInitially founded by their \"metropoleis\" (mother cities), the settlements evolved into independent and powerful Greek city-states (\"poleis\"). The settlers brought with them Hellenic civilization, which over time developed distinct local forms due to both their distance from Greece and the influence of the indigenous peoples of southern Italy. This interaction left a lasting imprint on Italy, including on Roman culture. The Greek settlers also influenced native groups such as the Sicels and the Oenotrians, many of whom adopted Greek culture and became Hellenized. In areas like architecture and urban planning, the colonies sometimes surpassed the achievements of the motherland. The ancient inhabitants of Magna Graecia are referred to as \"Italiotes\" and \"Siceliotes\".\nRuins of several cities from Magna Graecia remain visible today, including Neapolis (\"New City\", now Naples), Syrakousai (Syracuse), Akragas (Agrigento), Taras (Taranto), Rhegion (Reggio Calabria), and Kroton (Crotone). The most populous city was Sybaris (now Sibari), with an estimated population of between 300,000 and 500,000, from 600 to 510 BC.\nGovernments in these city-states were typically aristocratic, and the cities often engaged in warfare with one another. Their independence came to an end during the Second Punic War, when they were annexed by the Roman Republic in 205 BC.\nDespite the political changes, cultural life in Magna Graecia flourished. Greek art, literature, and philosophy had a decisive influence on the region, especially in cities like Taras. South Italian Greek pottery, particularly from the 4th century BC, is a notable cultural contribution. Settlers from Magna Graecia also achieved great success in the Ancient Olympic Games\u2014athletes from Crotone alone won 18 titles over 25 Olympiads.\nAlthough most Greek inhabitants of Magna Graecia were fully Latinized during the Middle Ages, traces of Greek language and culture persisted. The Griko people of Calabria (Bovesia) and Salento (Grec\u00eca Salentina) still maintain aspects of their Greek heritage, including the Griko language. This language is the last living trace of the once-vibrant Greek presence in Magna Graecia.\nTerminology.\nThe original Greek expression \"Meg\u00e1l\u0113 Hell\u00e1s\" (lit.\u2009'Great[er] Greece'), later translated into Latin as , is attested for the first time in a passage from the 2nd century BC by the Greek historian Polybius (written around 150 BC), where he ascribed the term to Pythagoras and his philosophical school.\nAncient authors use \"Magna Graecia\" to mean different parts of southern Italy, including or excluding Sicily, Strabo and Livy being the most prominent advocates of the wider definitions. Strabo used the term to refer to the territory that had been conquered by the Greeks.\nThere are various hypotheses on the origin of the name \"Meg\u00e1l\u0113 Hell\u00e1s\". The term could be explained by the prosperity and cultural and economic splendour of the region (6th\u20135th century BC); notably by the Achaeans of the city of Kroton, to refer to the network of colonies they founded or controlled between the end of the 6th and mid-5th centuries at the time of the Pythagoreans.\nContext.\nThere were several reasons for the Greeks to establish overseas colonies; demographic crises (famine, overcrowding, etc.), \"stasis\", a developing need for new commercial outlets and ports, and expulsion from their homeland after wars.\nDuring the Archaic period, the Greek population grew beyond the capacity of the limited arable land of Greece proper, resulting in the large-scale establishment of colonies elsewhere: according to one estimate, the population of the widening area of Greek settlement increased roughly tenfold from 800 BC to 400 BC, from 800,000 to as many as &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;7+1\u20442-10\u00a0million. This was not simply for trade, but also to found settlements. These Greek colonies were not, as Roman colonies were, dependent on their mother-city, but were independent city-states in their own right.\nAnother reason was the strong economic growth with the consequent overpopulation of the motherland. The terrain that some of these Greek city-states were in could not support a large city. Politics was also the reason as refugees from Greek city-states tended to settle away from these cities in the colonies.\nGreeks settled outside of Greece in two distinct ways. The first was in permanent settlements founded by the Greeks, which formed as independent poleis. The second form was in what historians refer to as \"emporia\"; trading posts which were occupied by both Greeks and non-Greeks and which were primarily concerned with the manufacture and sale of goods. Examples of this latter type of settlement are found at Al Mina in the east and Pithekoussai in the west.\nFrom about 750 BC the Greeks began 250 years of expansion, settling colonies in all directions.\nHistory.\nGreek colonisation.\nAccording to Strabo's \"Geographica\", the colonisation of Magna Graecia had already begun by the time of the Trojan War and lasted for several centuries.\nGreeks began to settle in southern Italy in the 8th century BC. Their first great migratory wave was by the Euboeans aimed at the Gulf of Naples (Pithecusae, Cumae) and the Strait of Messina (Zancle, Rhegium). Pithecusae on the island of Ischia is considered the oldest Greek settlement in Italy, and Cumae their first colony on the mainland of Italy.\nThe second wave was of the Achaeans who concentrated initially on the Ionian coast (Metapontion, Poseidonia, Sybaris, Kroton), shortly before 720BC. At an unknown date between the 8th and 6th centuries BC the Athenians, of Ionian lineage, founded Scylletium (near today's Catanzaro).\nWith colonisation, Greek culture was exported to Italy with its dialects of the Ancient Greek language, its religious rites, and its traditions of the independent \"polis\". An original Hellenic civilization soon developed, and later interacted with the native Italic civilisations. The most important cultural transplant was the Chalcidean/Cumaean variety of the Greek alphabet, which was adopted by the Etruscans; the Old Italic alphabet subsequently evolved into the Latin alphabet, which became the most widely used alphabet in the world.\nRemains of some of these Greek colonies can be seen today, such as those of Neapolis ('new city', now Naples), Syracusae (Syracuse), Akragas (Agrigento), Taras (Taranto), and Rhegion (Reggio Calabria).\nSecondary colonisation.\nOver time, due to overpopulation and other political and commercial reasons, the new cities expanded their presence in Italy by founding other Greek cities; effectively expanding the Greek civilisation to the whole territory known today as Magna Graecia.\nAn intense colonisation program was undertaken by Syracuse, at the time of the tyranny of Dionysius I of Syracuse, around 387\u2013385 BC. This phenomenon affected the entire Adriatic coast, and in particular led to the foundation in Italy of Anc\u00f3n (now Ancona) and Adria; in the Dalmatian coast he saw the foundation of Issa (current Vis), Pharos (Stari Grad), Dimos (Hvar); Lissos (now Lezh\u00eb) was founded on the Albanian coast. Issa in turn then founded Tragurium (now Trogir), Melaina Corcyra (now Kor\u010dula) and Epetium (now Stobre\u010d, a suburb of Split).\nRhegium (now Reggio Calabria) founded Pyxus (Policastro Bussentino) in Lucania; Locri founded Medma (Rosarno), Polyxena and Hipponium (Vibo Valentia) in present-day Calabria; Sybaris (now Sibari) revitalised the indigenous centres of La\u00fcs and Scydrus in Calabria and founded Poseidonia (Paestum), in Campania; Kroton (now Crotone) founded Terina and participated in the foundation of Caulonia (near Monasterace marina) in Calabria; Messana (now Messina), in collaboration with Rhegium, founded Metaurus (Gioia Tauro); Taras together with Thurii founded Heracleia (Policoro) in Lucania in 434 BC, and also Callipolis ('beautiful city').\nExpansion and conflict.\nAt the beginning of the 6th century BC, all the main cities of Magna Graecia on the Ionian Sea had achieved a high economic and cultural development, which shifted their interests towards expansion of their territory by waging war on neighbouring cities. The 6th century was therefore characterised by great clashes between the colonies. Some of the clashes that established the new balance and the new relationships of force were the Battle of the Sagra river (the clash between Locri Epizefiri and Kroton), the destruction of Siris (by Sybaris and Metapontum), and the clash between Kroton and Sybaris (which ended with the destruction of the latter).\nAs with all the events of this period precise dates are unknown, but the destruction of Sybaris may have occurred around 510 BC, while the two other clashes are placed around 580-560 BC, with the destruction of Siris before the Battle of the Sagra.\nRoman Era.\nThe first Greek city to be absorbed into the Roman Republic was Ne\u00e0polis in 327BC.\nAt the beginning of the 3rd century, Rome was a great power but had not yet entered into conflict with most of Magna Graecia, which had been allies of the Samnites. However, the needs of the Roman populace determined their need for territorial expansion towards the south. As the Greek cities of southern Italy came under threat from the Bruttii and Lucanians from the end of the 4th century BC, they asked for help from Rome, which exploited this opportunity by sending military garrisons in the 280s BC.\nFollowing Rome's victory over Taras after the Pyrrhic War in 272BC, most of the cities of southern Italy were linked to Rome with pacts and treaties (\"foedera\") which sanctioned a sort of indirect control.\nSicily was conquered by Rome during the First Punic War. Only Syracuse remained independent until 212 because its king Hiero II was a devoted ally of the Romans. His grandson Hieronymus however allied with Hannibal, which prompted the Romans to besiege the city, which fell in 212BC.\nAfter the second Punic War, Rome pursued an unprecedented program of reorganisation in the rest of Magna Graecia, where many of the cities were annexed to the Roman Republic in 205BC, as a consequence of their defection to Hannibal. Roman colonies (\"civium romanorum\") were the main element of the new territorial control plan starting from the \"lex Atinia\" of 197BC. In 194BC, garrisons of 300 Roman veterans were implanted in Volturnum, Liternum, Puteoli, Salernum and Buxentum, and to Sipontum on the Adriatic. This model was replicated in the territory of the Brettii; 194BC saw the foundation of the Roman colonies of Kroton and Tempsa, followed by the Latin colonies of Copia (193BC) and Valentia (192BC).\nThe social, linguistic and administrative changes arising from the Roman conquest only took root in this region by the 1st century AD, while Greek culture remained strong and was actively cultivated as shown by epigraphic evidence.\nMiddle Ages.\nDuring the Early Middle Ages, following the disastrous Gothic War, new waves of Byzantine Christian Greeks fleeing the Slavic invasion of Peloponnese settled in Calabria, further strengthened the Hellenic element in the region. The iconoclast emperor Leo III appropriated lands that had been granted to the Papacy in southern Italy and the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire continued to govern the area in the form of the Catapanate of Italy (965 -1071) through the Middle Ages, well after northern Italy fell to the Lombards.\nAt the time of the Normans' late medieval conquest of southern Italy and Sicily (in the late 12th century), the Salento peninsula (the \"heel\" of Italy), up to one-third of Sicily (concentrated in the Val Demone), and much of Calabria and Lucania were still largely Greek-speaking. Some regions of southern Italy experienced demographic shifts as Greeks began to migrate northwards in significant numbers from regions further south; one such region was Cilento, which came to have a Greek-speaking majority. At this time the language had evolved into medieval Greek, also known as Byzantine Greek, and its speakers were known as Byzantine Greeks. The resultant fusion of local Byzantine Greek culture with Norman and Arab culture (from the Arab occupation of Sicily) gave rise to Norman-Arab-Byzantine culture in Sicily.\nList of Greek \"poleis\".\nSouthern mainland Italy.\nThis is a list of the 22 \"poleis\" (\"city-states\") in Italy, according to Mogens Herman Hansen. It does not list all the Hellenic settlements, only those organised around a \"polis\" structure.\nSicily.\nThis is a list of the 46 \"poleis\" (\"city-states\") in Sicily, according to Mogens Herman Hansen. It does not list all the Hellenic settlements, only those organised around a \"polis\" structure.\nAdministration.\nThe administrative organisation of Magna Graecia was inherited from the Hellenic poleis, taking up the concept of \"city-states\" administered by the aristocracy. The cities of Magna Graecia were independent like the Greek \"poleis\" of the motherland, and had an army and a military fleet. There were also cases of tyranny as in Syracuse, governed by the tyrant Dionysius, who fought the Carthaginians until his death.\nEconomy.\nIn the cities of Magna Graecia, trade, agriculture and crafts developed. Initially oriented to the indigenous Italic populations, the trade was immediately an excellent channel of exchange with the Greeks of the motherland, even if today it is difficult to establish precisely the type of goods traded and the volume of these exchanges.\nCoinage.\nGreek coinage of Italy and Sicily originated from local Italiotes and Siceliotes who formed numerous city-states. These Hellenistic communities descended from Greek migrants. Southern Italy was so thoroughly Hellenized that it was known as the Magna Graecia. Each of the polities struck their own coinage.\nTaras (or Tarentum) was among the most prominent city-states.\nBy the second century BC, some of these Greek coinages evolved under Roman rule, and can be classified as the first Roman provincial currencies.\nCulture.\nThe Greek colonists of Magna Graecia elaborated a civilization, which had peculiar characteristics, due to the distance from the motherland and the influence of the indigenous peoples of southern Italy. From the motherland Greece, art, literature and philosophy decisively influenced the life of the colonies. In Magna Graecia much impetus was given to culture, especially in some cities, such as Taras (now Taranto). Pythagoras moved to Crotone where he founded his school in 530 BC. Among others, Aeschylus, Herodotus, Xenophanes and Plato visited Magna Graecia.\nAmong the illustrious characters born in Magna Graecia are the philosophers Parmenides of Elea, Zeno of Elea, Gorgias of Lentini and Empedocles of Agrigento; the Pythagoreans Philolaus of Crotone, Archytas of Taranto, Lysis of Taranto, Echecrates and Timaeus of Locri; the mathematician Archimedes of Syracuse; the poets Theocritus of Syracuse, Stesichorus, Ibycus of Reggio Calabria, Nossis of Locri, Alexis of Thuri and Leonidas of Taranto; the doctors Alcmeon of Crotone and Democedes of Crotone; the sculptor from Reggio Clearchus; the painter Zeuxis, the musicologist Aristoxenus of Taranto and the legislator Zaleucus of Locri.\nLanguage.\nA remnant of Greek influence can be found in the survival of the Greek language in some villages of the above-mentioned Salento peninsula (the \"heel\" of Italy). This living dialect of Greek, known locally as Griko, is found in the Italian regions of Calabria and Apulia. \"Griko\" is considered by linguists to be a descendant of Byzantine Greek, which had been the majority language of Salento through the Middle Ages, combining also some ancient Doric and local romance elements. There is a rich oral tradition and Griko folklore, limited now but once numerous, to around 30,000 people, most of them having abandoned their language in favour of Italian. Some scholars, such as Gerhard Rohlfs, argue that the origins of Griko may ultimately be traced to the colonies of Magna Graecia.\nArt and architecture.\nMagna Graecia, in some fields such as architecture and urban planning, sometimes surpassed the mother country and the other Greek colonies. In Magna Graecia, as well as in the other Greek colonies, the Doric style enriched with showy decorations was adopted as the dominant architectural style. In Magna Graecia, in particular, a Doric style influenced by the Ionic one was also used, especially in Sicily in the Achaean colonies. In Magna Graecia, limestone was used as a building material due to the difficulty in finding other materials. The Doric style in Magna Graecia reached its apogee, surpassing that of the motherland and the other Greek colonies.\nRegarding urban planning, the cities of Magna Graecia, as well as many cities of Greek colonies in other regions, were more orderly and rational in the distribution of spaces than those of the mother country, making the urban fabric more practical. The first examples of urbanistically more rational Greek cities belonged to Magna Graecia, in this case Taranto, Metapontum and Megara Hyblaea. Characteristic of this new urban concept, which later spread also in the motherland to Rhodes and Miletus, was a checkerboard road network.\nIn Magna Graecia painting and sculpture also reached a notable level of quality. In Magna Graecia there were examples of excellence in sculpture, coroplastics and bronzes. As for vase painting, many famous Athenian potters moved to Magna Graecia creating works influenced by the culture of the place, making their paintings peculiar and different from those of the motherland, giving rise to the South Italian ancient Greek pottery. Also noteworthy are the mosaics, the goldsmith's art and wall painting.\nNoteworthy sculptures from Magna Graecia are the Apollo of Gaza, the Apollo of Piombino, the Dancing Satyr of Mazara del Vallo, the Head of a Philosopher and the \"Riace bronzes\", while notable vases from Magna Graecia are the Darius Vase and the Nestor's Cup. Noteworthy temples of Magna Graecia are the Temple of Concordia, Agrigento, the Temple of Hera Lacinia, the Temple of Heracles, Agrigento, The Temple of Juno in Agrigento, the Temple of Olympian Zeus, Agrigento, the Temple of Apollo (Syracuse), the Temple of Athena (Syracuse), the Temple of Athena (Paestum), the Temple C (Selinus), the Temple E (Selinus), the Temple F (Selinus), the Temple of Juno Lacinia (Crotone), the Second Temple of Hera (Paestum), the Heraion at Foce del Sele, the Temple of Poseidon (Taranto), the Tavole Palatine and the Temple of Victory (Himera).\nTheatre.\nThe Sicilian Greek colonists in Magna Graecia, but also from Campania and Apulia, also brought theatrical art from their motherland. The Greek Theatre of Syracuse, the Greek Theatre of Segesta, the Greek Theatre of Tindari, the Greek Theatre of Hippana, the Greek Theatre of Akrai, the Greek Theatre of Monte Jato, the Greek Theatre of Morgantina and the most famous Greek Theater of Taormina, amply demonstrate this.\nOnly fragments of original dramaturgical works are left, but the tragedies of the three great giants Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides and the comedies of Aristophanes are known.\nSome famous playwrights in the Greek language came directly from Magna Graecia. Others, such as Aeschylus and Epicharmus, worked for a long time in Sicily. Epicharmus can be considered Syracusan in all respects, having worked all his life with the tyrants of Syracuse. His comedy preceded that of the more famous Aristophanes by staging the gods for the first time in comedy. While Aeschylus, after a long stay in the Sicilian colonies, died in Sicily in the colony of Gela in 456 BC. Epicarmus and Phormis, both of 6th century BC, are the basis, for Aristotle, of the invention of the Greek comedy, as he says in his book on \"Poetics\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;As for the composition of the stories (Epicharmus and Phormis) it came in the beginning from Sicily\u2014\u200a\nOther native dramatic authors of Magna Graecia, in addition to the Syracusan Phormis mentioned, are Achaeus of Syracuse, Apollodorus of Gela, Philemon of Syracuse and his son Philemon the younger. From Calabria, precisely from the colony of Thurii, came the playwright Alexis. While Rhinthon, although Sicilian from Syracuse, worked almost exclusively for the colony of Taranto.\nSport.\nThe colonies sent athletes of all disciplines to the Ancient Olympic Games which were periodically held at Olympia and Delphi in Greece.\nThe colonists of Magna Graecia were very fond of the Hellenic games where they could prove to the Greeks that they belonged to the same place of origin, their physical strength and skills in the games were also played by their ancestors dozens of generations earlier. And for this reason the greatest sovereigns demanded that teams be trained to be sent to Greece.\nSport was therefore a channel of communication with the Hellenic peninsula, a means by which the colonies of Magna Graecia showed themselves to the rest of the Hellenic world. The settlers of Magna Graecia had great success in sporting competitions in their homeland. Crotone's athletes won 18 titles in 25 Olympics.\nModern and contemporary Italy.\nGreek nobles started taking refuge in Italy following the Fall of Constantinople in 1453. Greeks immigrated once again to the region in the 16th and 17th centuries in reaction to the conquest of the Peloponnese by the Ottoman Empire. Especially after the end of the Siege of Coron (1534), large numbers of Greeks took refuge in the areas of Calabria, Salento and Sicily. Greeks from Coroni, the so-called Coronians, were nobles, who brought with them substantial movable property.\nOther Greeks who moved to Italy came from the Mani Peninsula of the Peloponnese. The Maniots (their name originating from the Greek word \"mania\") were known for their proud military traditions and for their bloody vendettas, many of which continue today. Another group of Maniot Greeks moved to Corsica in the 17th century under the protection of the Republic of Genoa.\nAlthough many of the Greek inhabitants of Magna Graecia were entirely Latinized during the Middle Ages, pockets of Greek culture and language remained and have survived to the present day. One example is the Griko people in Calabria (Bovesia) and Salento (Grec\u00eca Salentina), some of whom still maintain their Greek language (Griko language) and customs. The Griko language is the last living trace of the Greek elements that once formed Magna Graecia. Their working practices have been passed down through generations through storytelling and allowing the observation of work. The Italian parliament recognizes the Griko people as an ethnolinguistic minority under the official name of \"Minoranze linguistiche Grike dell'Etnia Griko-Calabrese e Salentina\".\nMessina in Sicily is home to a small Greek-speaking minority, which arrived from the Peloponnese between 1533 and 1534 when fleeing the expansion of the Ottoman Empire. They were officially recognised in 2012.\nUNESCO World Heritage Sites related to Magna Graecia.\nValle dei Templi.\nThe Valle dei Templi, or Valley of the Temples, is an archaeological site in Agrigento (ancient Greek \"Akragas\"), Sicily. It is one of the most outstanding examples of ancient Greek art and architecture of Magna Graecia. The term \"valley\" is a misnomer, the site is located on a ridge outside the town of Agrigento.\nSince 1997, the entire area has been included in the UNESCO World Heritage List. The archaeological and landscape park of the Valle dei Templi, with its 1,300 hectares, is the largest archaeological park in Europe and the Mediterranean basin.\nThe Valley includes remains of seven temples, all in Doric style. The ascription of the names, apart from that of the \"Olympeion\", is a mere tradition established in Renaissance times. The temples are:\nThe Valley is also home to the so-called Tomb of Theron, a large tuff monument of pyramidal shape; scholars suppose it was built to commemorate the Romans killed in the Second Punic War.\nPoseidonia and Elea.\nCilento, Vallo di Diano and Alburni National Park (Italian \"Parco Nazionale del Cilento, Vallo di Diano e Alburni\") is an Italian national park in the Province of Salerno, in Campania in southern Italy. It includes much of the Cilento, the Vallo di Diano and the Monti Alburni. It was founded in 1991, and was formerly known as the Parco Nazionale del Cilento e Vallo di Diano. In 1998 it became a World Heritage Site of UNESCO, along with the ancient Greek towns of Poseidonia, Elea and the Padula Charterhouse.\nMuch of the most celebrated features of the Poseidonia site today are the three large temples in the Archaic version of the Greek Doric order, dating from about 550 to 450 BC. All are typical of the period, with massive colonnades having a very pronounced entasis (widening as they go down), and very wide capitals resembling upturned mushrooms. Above the columns, only the second Temple of Hera retains most of its entablature, the other two having only the architrave in place. These were dedicated to Hera and Athena (Juno and Minerva to the Romans), although previously they often have been identified otherwise, following eighteenth-century arguments. The two temples of Hera are right next to each other, while the Temple of Athena is on the other side of the town centre. There were other temples, both Greek and Roman, which are far less well preserved.\nRemains of Elea walls, with traces of one gate and several towers, of a total length of over three miles, still exist, and belong to three different periods, in all of which the crystalline limestone of the locality is used. Bricks were also employed in later times; their form is peculiar to this place, each having two rectangular channels on one side, and being about 1.5 inches square, with a thickness of nearly 4 inches They all bear Greek brick-stamps. There are some remains of cisterns on the site, and, various other traces of buildings.\nSyracuse.\nSyracuse was founded in 733\u00a0BC by Greek settlers from Corinth and Tenea, led by the \"oecist\" (colonizer) Archias.

Before his election to the papacy, he was abbot of St. Stephen's monastery, which served pilgrims. In Rome in 823 he crowned Lothair I as Holy Roman Emperor. He rebuilt a number of churches in Rome, including three basilicas.\nEarly life.\nAccording to the \"Liber Pontificalis\", Paschal was a native of Lazio Rome born Pascale Massimi and son of Bonosus and Episcopa Theodora. The \"Liber Censuum\" says that Paschal was from the Massimi branch of the Massimo family, as was his predecessor, Stephen IV.\nPope Leo III placed Paschal in charge of the monastery of St Stephen of the Abyssinians, where his responsibilities included the care of pilgrims visiting Rome. According to early modern accounts, Leo III may have elevated Paschal as the cardinal priest of Santa Prassede. Goodson attributes this account to a \"desire to explain the attention that the pope so lavishly and prominently paid to that church later in his career.\"\nAccession.\nPaschal became pope on 25 January 817, just one day after the sudden death of Stephen IV. This decision was made without the sanction of Emperor Louis the Pious. Paschal began his pontificate apologizing for this slight, stressing that the office had been thrust upon him. He claimed that the decision had been made to avoid factional strife in Rome. According to the \"Liber Pontificalis\", Pope Paschal's legate Theodore returned with a document titled \"Pactum cum Paschali pontifice\", in which the emperor congratulated Paschal, recognized his sovereignty over the Papal States, and guaranteed the free election of future pontiffs. This document has since been challenged by historians as a forgery.\nPapacy.\nAt first, Emperor Louis confirmed the agreement reached in Rheims with Paschal's predecessor, Stephen IV, and detailed in the document \"Pactum Ludovicanum\" about free papal elections and noninterference in Church affairs unless officially asked for help. The two worked together to send Archbishop Ebbo of Rheims to evangelize the Danes in 822.\nOn Easter Sunday of 823, Paschal crowned and anointed Louis's son Lothair I. Lothair was less amenable to cooperating with the Papal Curia than his father. He held a court and declared Farfa Abbey, just north of Rome, exempt from papal taxation. Paschal's aristocratic opponents in the papal palace, especially his former legate, Theodore, and his son-in-law, Leo, who turned to the young leader of the Franks for support in their opposition to Paschal. The decision outraged the Roman nobility and led to an uprising against the authority of the Roman Curia in northern Italy led by Theodore and Leo. The revolt was quickly suppressed, and two of its leaders were seized, blinded, and afterwards beheaded by members of the papal household. Paschal denied any involvement, but the Emperor remained suspicious and sent two commissioners to investigate. Paschal refused to submit to the authority of the imperial court, but he did take an oath of purgation before a synod of thirty-four bishops. The commissioners returned to Aachen, and Emperor Louis let the matter drop.\nConstruction projects.\nPaschal gave shelter to exiled monks from the Byzantine Empire who had fled persecution for their opposition to iconoclasm. He both offered the exiled Byzantine mosaic artists work decorating churches in Rome and wrote to Louis the Pious and the Byzantine emperor Leo the Armenian in support of those who opposed iconoclasm.\nPaschal rebuilt three basilicas of Rome: Santa Prassede, Santa Maria in Domnica, and Santa Cecilia in Trastevere. These churches contain mosaics with lifelike portraits of Paschal. Paschal is credited with finding the body of Saint Cecilia in the Catacomb of Callixtus and translating it to the rebuild the basilica of Santa Cecilia in Trastevere. Paschal also undertook significant renovations on Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore. In addition, Paschal added two oratories to Old St. Peter's Basilica, SS. Processus et Martinianus and SS. Xistus et Fabianus, which did not survive the 16th century renovation of St. Peter's.\nPaschal is also sometimes credited with the renovation of Santo Stefano del Cacco in early modern sources, but this renovation was actually undertaken by Pope Paschal II.\nAccording to Goodson, Paschal \"used church-building to express the authority of the papacy as an independent state.\"\nWritings.\nOnly six known letters written by Paschal remain. The first (Jaff\u00e9 2546) confirms the possessions of the Territorial Abbey of Farfa. The second and third (Jaff\u00e9 2547 and Jaff\u00e9 2548) were written to a Frankish abbot prior to and after his elevation as archbishop of Vienne. The fourth (Jaff\u00e9 2550) was written to Louis the Pious. The fifth (Jaff\u00e9 2551, preserved in the Biblioteca Ambrosiana) confirms the privileges of the church of Ravenna. The last (Jaff\u00e9 2553) was written to Ebbo, the archbishop of Reims.\nDeath.\nPaschal died on 11 February 824. The Roman Curia refused him the honour of burial within St. Peter's Basilica because of his harsh government of the Roman people. He was instead buried in the Basilica of Santa Prassede, which also contains the famous \"Episcopa Theodora\" mosaic of his mother.\nPaschal was canonized in the late sixteenth century. His feast day in the Roman calendar prior to 1963 was 14 May. It is currently celebrated on 11 February.\nPope and Patriarch of Rome (817\u2013824), confessor is honored in Orthodox Church on 14 May.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Nash equilibrium is the most commonly used solution concept for non-cooperative games.\nIf each player has chosen a strategy\u00a0\u2013 an action plan based on what has happened so far in the game\u00a0\u2013 and no one can increase one's own expected payoff by changing one's strategy while the other players keep theirs unchanged, then the current set of strategy choices constitutes a Nash equilibrium.\nIf two players Alice and Bob choose strategies A and B, (A, B) is a Nash equilibrium if Alice has no other strategy available that does better than A at maximizing her payoff in response to Bob choosing B, and Bob has no other strategy available that does better than B at maximizing his payoff in response to Alice choosing A. In a game in which Carol and Dan are also players, (A, B, C, D) is a Nash equilibrium if A is Alice's best response to (B, C, D), B is Bob's best response to (A, C, D), and so forth.\nThe idea of Nash equilibrium dates back to the time of Cournot, who in 1838 applied it to his model of competition in an oligopoly. John Nash showed that there is a Nash equilibrium, possibly in mixed strategies, for every finite game.\nApplications.\nGame theorists use Nash equilibrium to analyze the outcome of the strategic interaction of several decision makers. In a strategic interaction, the outcome for each decision-maker depends on the decisions of the others as well as their own. The simple insight underlying Nash's idea is that one cannot predict the choices of multiple decision makers if one analyzes those decisions in isolation. Instead, one must ask what each player would do taking into account what the player expects the others to do. Nash equilibrium is achieved when no player can improve their outcome by changing their decision, assuming the other players' choices remain unchanged.\nThe concept has been used to analyze hostile situations such as wars and arms races (see prisoner's dilemma), and also how conflict may be mitigated by repeated interaction (see tit-for-tat). It has also been used to study to what extent people with different preferences can cooperate (see battle of the sexes), and whether they will take risks to achieve a cooperative outcome (see stag hunt). It has been used to study the adoption of technical standards, and also the occurrence of bank runs and currency crises (see coordination game). Other applications include traffic flow (see Wardrop's principle), how to organize auctions (see auction theory), the outcome of efforts exerted by multiple parties in the education process, regulatory legislation such as environmental regulations (see tragedy of the commons), natural resource management, analysing strategies in marketing, penalty kicks in football (i.e., soccer; see matching pennies), robot navigation in crowds, energy systems, transportation systems, evacuation problems and wireless communications.\nHistory.\nNash equilibrium is named after American mathematician John Forbes Nash Jr. The same idea was used in a particular application in 1838 by Antoine Augustin Cournot in his theory of oligopoly. In Cournot's theory, each of several firms choose how much output to produce to maximize its profit. The best output for one firm depends on the outputs of the others. A Cournot equilibrium occurs when each firm's output maximizes its profits given the output of the other firms, which is a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium. Cournot also introduced the concept of best response dynamics in his analysis of the stability of equilibrium. Cournot did not use the idea in any other applications, however, or define it generally.\nThe modern concept of Nash equilibrium is instead defined in terms of mixed strategies, where players choose a probability distribution over possible pure strategies (which might put 100% of the probability on one pure strategy; such pure strategies are a subset of mixed strategies). The concept of a mixed-strategy equilibrium was introduced by John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern in their 1944 book \"The Theory of Games and Economic Behavior\", but their analysis was restricted to the special case of zero-sum games. They showed that a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium will exist for any zero-sum game with a finite set of actions. The contribution of Nash in his 1951 article \"Non-Cooperative Games\" was to define a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium for any game with a finite set of actions and prove that at least one (mixed-strategy) Nash equilibrium must exist in such a game. The key to Nash's ability to prove existence far more generally than von Neumann lay in his definition of equilibrium. According to Nash, \"an equilibrium point is an n-tuple such that each player's mixed strategy maximizes [their] payoff if the strategies of the others are held fixed. Thus each player's strategy is optimal against those of the others.\" Putting the problem in this framework allowed Nash to employ the Kakutani fixed-point theorem in his 1950 paper to prove existence of equilibria. His 1951 paper used the simpler Brouwer fixed-point theorem for the same purpose.\nGame theorists have discovered that in some circumstances Nash equilibrium makes invalid predictions or fails to make a unique prediction. They have proposed many solution concepts ('refinements' of Nash equilibria) designed to rule out implausible Nash equilibria. One particularly important issue is that some Nash equilibria may be based on threats that are not 'credible'. In 1965 Reinhard Selten proposed subgame perfect equilibrium as a refinement that eliminates equilibria which depend on non-credible threats. Other extensions of the Nash equilibrium concept have addressed what happens if a game is repeated, or what happens if a game is played in the absence of complete information. However, subsequent refinements and extensions of Nash equilibrium share the main insight on which Nash's concept rests: the equilibrium is a set of strategies such that each player's strategy is optimal given the choices of the others.\nDefinitions.\nA strategy profile is a set of strategies, one for each player. Informally, a strategy profile is a Nash equilibrium if no player can do better by unilaterally changing their strategy. To see what this means, imagine that each player is told the strategies of the others. Suppose then that each player asks themselves: \"Knowing the strategies of the other players, and treating the strategies of the other players as set in stone, can I benefit by changing my strategy?\"\nFor instance if a player prefers \"Yes\", then that set of strategies is not a Nash equilibrium. But if every player prefers not to switch (or is indifferent between switching and not) then the strategy profile is a Nash equilibrium. Thus, each strategy in a Nash equilibrium is a best response to the other players' strategies in that equilibrium.\nFormally, let formula_1 be the set of all possible strategies for player formula_2, where formula_3. Let formula_4 be a strategy profile, a set consisting of one strategy for each player, where formula_5 denotes the formula_6 strategies of all the players except formula_2. Let formula_8 be player \"i\"'s payoff as a function of the strategies. The strategy profile formula_9 is a Nash equilibrium if \nformula_10\nA game can have more than one Nash equilibrium. Even if the equilibrium is unique, it might be \"weak\": a player might be indifferent among several strategies given the other players' choices. It is unique and called a \"strict Nash equilibrium\" if the inequality is strict so one strategy is the unique best response: \nformula_11\nThe strategy set formula_1 can be different for different players, and its elements can be a variety of mathematical objects. Most simply, a player might choose between two strategies, e.g. formula_13 Or the strategy set might be a finite set of conditional strategies responding to other players, e.g. formula_14 Or it might be an infinite set, a continuum or unbounded, e.g. formula_15 such that formula_16 is a non-negative real number. Nash's existence proofs assume a finite strategy set, but the concept of Nash equilibrium does not require it.\nVariants.\nPure/mixed equilibrium.\nA game can have a pure-strategy or a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium. In the latter, not every player always plays the same strategy. Instead, there is a probability distribution over different strategies.\nStrict/non-strict equilibrium.\nSuppose that in the Nash equilibrium, each player asks themselves: \"Knowing the strategies of the other players, and treating the strategies of the other players as set in stone, would I suffer a loss by changing my strategy?\"\nIf every player's answer is \"Yes\", then the equilibrium is classified as a \"strict Nash equilibrium\".\nIf instead, for some player, there is exact equality between the strategy in Nash equilibrium and some other strategy that gives exactly the same payout (i.e., the player is indifferent between switching and not), then the equilibrium is classified as a \"weak\" or \"non-strict Nash equilibrium\".\nEquilibria for coalitions.\nThe Nash equilibrium defines stability only in terms of individual player deviations. In cooperative games such a concept is not convincing enough. Strong Nash equilibrium allows for deviations by every conceivable coalition. Formally, a strong Nash equilibrium is a Nash equilibrium in which no coalition, taking the actions of its complements as given, can cooperatively deviate in a way that benefits all of its members. However, the strong Nash concept is sometimes perceived as too \"strong\" in that the environment allows for unlimited private communication. In fact, strong Nash equilibrium has to be weakly Pareto efficient. As a result of these requirements, strong Nash is too rare to be useful in many branches of game theory. However, in games such as elections with many more players than possible outcomes, it can be more common than a stable equilibrium.\nA refined Nash equilibrium known as coalition-proof Nash equilibrium (CPNE) occurs when players cannot do better even if they are allowed to communicate and make \"self-enforcing\" agreement to deviate. Every correlated strategy supported by iterated strict dominance and on the Pareto frontier is a CPNE. Further, it is possible for a game to have a Nash equilibrium that is resilient against coalitions less than a specified size, k. CPNE is related to the theory of the core.\nExistence.\nNash proved that if mixed strategies (where a player chooses probabilities of using various pure strategies) are allowed, then every game with a finite number of players in which each player can choose from finitely many pure strategies has at least one Nash equilibrium, which might be a pure strategy for each player or might be a probability distribution over strategies for each player.\nNash equilibria need not exist if the set of choices is infinite and non-compact. For example:\nHowever, a Nash equilibrium exists if the set of choices is compact with each player's payoff continuous in the strategies of all the players.\nGeneralizations.\nNash's existence theorem has been extended to more general classes of games.\nGames with coupled constraints.\nIn Nash's model, the set of strategies available to each player is fixed and does not depend on the other players' strategies. A more general model allows these sets to depend on other players' strategies; this is often called coupled constraints. In Nash's model, the set of possible strategy-profiles is a Cartesian product of the players' strategy sets, whereas in the more general model it can be an arbitrary set. When there are coupled constraints, the equilibrium is often called Generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE).\nRosen proved that, if the set of strategy-profiles is any convex set, and the utility function of each player is continuous in all strategies and a concave function of the player's own strategy, then a GNE exists; see concave games.\nNon-atomic games.\nNash considered games with finitely many players, in non-atomic games the set of players is infinite - there is a continuum of players David Schmeidler proved that an equilibrium exists under certain conditions.\nRationality.\nThe Nash equilibrium may sometimes appear non-rational in a third-person perspective. This is because a Nash equilibrium is not necessarily Pareto optimal.\nNash equilibrium may also have non-rational consequences in sequential games because players may \"threaten\" each other with threats they would not actually carry out. For such games the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium may be more meaningful as a tool of analysis.\nExamples.\nCoordination game.\nThe \"coordination game\" is a classic two-player, two-strategy game, as shown in the example payoff matrix to the right. There are two pure-strategy equilibria, (A,A) with payoff 4 for each player and (B,B) with payoff 2 for each. The combination (B,B) is a Nash equilibrium because if either player unilaterally changes their strategy from B to A, their payoff will fall from 2 to 1.\nA famous example of a coordination game is the stag hunt. Two players may choose to hunt a stag or a rabbit, the stag providing more meat (4 utility units, 2 for each player) than the rabbit (1 utility unit). The caveat is that the stag must be cooperatively hunted, so if one player attempts to hunt the stag, while the other hunts the rabbit, the stag hunter will totally fail, for a payoff of 0, whereas the rabbit hunter will succeed, for a payoff of 1. The game has two equilibria, (stag, stag) and (rabbit, rabbit), because a player's optimal strategy depends on their expectation on what the other player will do. If one hunter trusts that the other will hunt the stag, they should hunt the stag; however if they think the other will hunt the rabbit, they too will hunt the rabbit. This game is used as an analogy for social cooperation, since much of the benefit that people gain in society depends upon people cooperating and implicitly trusting one another to act in a manner corresponding with cooperation.\nDriving on a road against an oncoming car, and having to choose either to swerve on the left or to swerve on the right of the road, is also a coordination game. For example, with payoffs 10 meaning no crash and 0 meaning a crash, the coordination game can be defined with the following payoff matrix:\nIn this case there are two pure-strategy Nash equilibria, when both choose to either drive on the left or on the right. If we admit mixed strategies (where a pure strategy is chosen at random, subject to some fixed probability), then there are three Nash equilibria for the same case: two we have seen from the pure-strategy form, where the probabilities are (0%, 100%) for player one, (0%, 100%) for player two; and (100%, 0%) for player one, (100%, 0%) for player two respectively. We add another where the probabilities for each player are (50%, 50%).\nNetwork traffic.\nAn application of Nash equilibria is in determining the expected flow of traffic in a network. Consider the graph on the right. If we assume that there are formula_17 \"cars\" traveling from A to D, what is the expected distribution of traffic in the network?\nThis situation can be modeled as a \"game\", where every traveler has a choice of 3 strategies and where each strategy is a route from A to D (one of ABD, ABCD, or ACD). The \"payoff\" of each strategy is the travel time of each route. In the graph on the right, a car travelling via ABD experiences travel time of formula_18, where formula_17 is the number of cars traveling on edge AB. Thus, payoffs for any given strategy depend on the choices of the other players, as is usual. However, the goal, in this case, is to minimize travel time, not maximize it. Equilibrium will occur when the time on all paths is exactly the same. When that happens, no single driver has any incentive to switch routes, since it can only add to their travel time. For the graph on the right, if, for example, 100 cars are travelling from A to D, then equilibrium will occur when 25 drivers travel via ABD, 50 via ABCD, and 25 via ACD. Every driver now has a total travel time of 3.75 (to see this, a total of 75 cars take the AB edge, and likewise, 75 cars take the CD edge).\nNotice that this distribution is not, actually, socially optimal. If the 100 cars agreed that 50 travel via ABD and the other 50 through ACD, then travel time for any single car would actually be 3.5, which is less than 3.75. This is also the Nash equilibrium if the path between B and C is removed, which means that adding another possible route can decrease the efficiency of the system, a phenomenon known as Braess's paradox.\nCompetition game.\nThis can be illustrated by a two-player game in which both players simultaneously choose an integer from 0 to 3 and they both win the smaller of the two numbers in points. In addition, if one player chooses a larger number than the other, then they have to give up two points to the other.\nThis game has a unique pure-strategy Nash equilibrium: both players choosing 0 (highlighted in light red). Any other strategy can be improved by a player switching their number to one less than that of the other player. In the adjacent table, if the game begins at the green square, it is in player 1's interest to move to the purple square and it is in player 2's interest to move to the blue square. Although it would not fit the definition of a competition game, if the game is modified so that the two players win the named amount if they both choose the same number, and otherwise win nothing, then there are 4 Nash equilibria: (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), and (3,3).\nNash equilibria in a payoff matrix.\nThere is an easy numerical way to identify Nash equilibria on a payoff matrix. It is especially helpful in two-person games where players have more than two strategies. In this case formal analysis may become too long. This rule does not apply to the case where mixed (stochastic) strategies are of interest. The rule goes as follows: if the first payoff number, in the payoff pair of the cell, is the maximum of the column of the cell and if the second number is the maximum of the row of the cell\u00a0\u2013 then the cell represents a Nash equilibrium.\nWe can apply this rule to a 3\u00d73 matrix:\nUsing the rule, we can very quickly (much faster than with formal analysis) see that the Nash equilibria cells are (B,A), (A,B), and (C,C). Indeed, for cell (B,A), 40 is the maximum of the first column and 25 is the maximum of the second row. For (A,B), 25 is the maximum of the second column and 40 is the maximum of the first row; the same applies for cell (C,C). For other cells, either one or both of the duplet members are not the maximum of the corresponding rows and columns.\nThis said, the actual mechanics of finding equilibrium cells is obvious: find the maximum of a column and check if the second member of the pair is the maximum of the row. If these conditions are met, the cell represents a Nash equilibrium. Check all columns this way to find all NE cells. An N\u00d7N matrix may have between 0 and N\u00d7N pure-strategy Nash equilibria.\nStability.\nThe concept of stability, useful in the analysis of many kinds of equilibria, can also be applied to Nash equilibria.\nA Nash equilibrium for a mixed-strategy game is stable if a small change (specifically, an infinitesimal change) in probabilities for one player leads to a situation where two conditions hold:\nIf these cases are both met, then a player with the small change in their mixed strategy will return immediately to the Nash equilibrium. The equilibrium is said to be stable. If condition one does not hold then the equilibrium is unstable. If only condition one holds then there are likely to be an infinite number of optimal strategies for the player who changed.\nIn the \"driving game\" example above there are both stable and unstable equilibria. The equilibria involving mixed strategies with 100% probabilities are stable. If either player changes their probabilities slightly, they will be both at a disadvantage, and their opponent will have no reason to change their strategy in turn. The (50%,50%) equilibrium is unstable. If either player changes their probabilities (which would neither benefit or damage the expectation of the player who did the change, if the other player's mixed strategy is still (50%,50%)), then the other player immediately has a better strategy at either (0%, 100%) or (100%, 0%).\nStability is crucial in practical applications of Nash equilibria, since the mixed strategy of each player is not perfectly known, but has to be inferred from statistical distribution of their actions in the game. In this case unstable equilibria are very unlikely to arise in practice, since any minute change in the proportions of each strategy seen will lead to a change in strategy and the breakdown of the equilibrium.\nFinally in the eighties, building with great depth on such ideas Mertens-stable equilibria were introduced as a solution concept. Mertens stable equilibria satisfy both forward induction and backward induction. In a game theory context stable equilibria now usually refer to Mertens stable equilibria.\nOccurrence.\nIf a game has a unique Nash equilibrium and is played among players under certain conditions, then the NE strategy set will be adopted. Sufficient conditions to guarantee that the Nash equilibrium is played are:\nWhere the conditions are not met.\nExamples of game theory problems in which these conditions are not met:\nWhere the conditions are met.\nIn his Ph.D. dissertation, John Nash proposed two interpretations of his equilibrium concept, with the objective of showing how equilibrium points can be connected with observable phenomenon.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;(...) \"One interpretation is rationalistic: if we assume that players are rational, know the full structure of the game, the game is played just once, and there is just one Nash equilibrium, then players will play according to that equilibrium\".\nThis idea was formalized by R. Aumann and A. Brandenburger, 1995, \"Epistemic Conditions for Nash Equilibrium\", Econometrica, 63, 1161-1180 who interpreted each player's mixed strategy as a conjecture about the behaviour of other players and have shown that if the game and the rationality of players is mutually known and these conjectures are commonly known, then the conjectures must be a Nash equilibrium (a common prior assumption is needed for this result in general, but not in the case of two players. In this case, the conjectures need only be mutually known).\nA second interpretation, that Nash referred to by the mass action interpretation, is less demanding on players:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[i]t is unnecessary to assume that the participants have full knowledge of the total structure of the game, or the ability and inclination to go through any complex reasoning processes. \"What is assumed is that there is a population of participants for each position in the game, which will be played throughout time by participants drawn at random from the different populations. If there is a stable average frequency with which each pure strategy is employed by the \"average member\" of the appropriate population, then this stable average frequency constitutes a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.\"\nFor a formal result along these lines, see Kuhn, H. and et al., 1996, \"The Work of John Nash in Game Theory\", \"Journal of Economic Theory\", 69, 153\u2013185.\nDue to the limited conditions in which NE can actually be observed, they are rarely treated as a guide to day-to-day behaviour, or observed in practice in human negotiations. However, as a theoretical concept in economics and evolutionary biology, the NE has explanatory power. The payoff in economics is utility (or sometimes money), and in evolutionary biology is gene transmission; both are the fundamental bottom line of survival. Researchers who apply games theory in these fields claim that strategies failing to maximize these for whatever reason will be competed out of the market or environment, which are ascribed the ability to test all strategies. This conclusion is drawn from the \"stability\" theory above. In these situations the assumption that the strategy observed is actually a NE has often been borne out by research.\nNE and non-credible threats.\nThe Nash equilibrium is a superset of the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium. The subgame perfect equilibrium in addition to the Nash equilibrium requires that the strategy also is a Nash equilibrium in every subgame of that game. This eliminates all non-credible threats, that is, strategies that contain non-rational moves in order to make the counter-player change their strategy.\nThe image to the right shows a simple sequential game that illustrates the issue with subgame imperfect Nash equilibria. In this game player one chooses left(L) or right(R), which is followed by player two being called upon to be kind (K) or unkind (U) to player one, However, player two only stands to gain from being unkind if player one goes left. If player one goes right the rational player two would de facto be kind to her/him in that subgame. However, The non-credible threat of being unkind at 2(2) is still part of the blue (L, (U,U)) Nash equilibrium. Therefore, if rational behavior can be expected by both parties the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium may be a more meaningful solution concept when such dynamic inconsistencies arise.\nProof of existence.\nProof using the Kakutani fixed-point theorem.\nNash's original proof (in his thesis) used Brouwer's fixed-point theorem (e.g., see below for a variant). This section presents a simpler proof via the Kakutani fixed-point theorem, following Nash's 1950 paper (he credits David Gale with the observation that such a simplification is possible).\nTo prove the existence of a Nash equilibrium, let formula_20 be the best response of player i to the strategies of all other players.\nformula_21\nHere, formula_22, where formula_23, is a mixed-strategy profile in the set of all mixed strategies and formula_24 is the payoff function for player i. Define a set-valued function formula_25 such that formula_26. The existence of a Nash equilibrium is equivalent to formula_27 having a fixed point.\nKakutani's fixed point theorem guarantees the existence of a fixed point if the following four conditions are satisfied.\nCondition 1. is satisfied from the fact that formula_32 is a simplex and thus compact. Convexity follows from players' ability to mix strategies. formula_32 is nonempty as long as players have strategies.\nCondition 2. and 3. are satisfied by way of Berge's maximum theorem. Because formula_24 is continuous and compact, formula_35 is non-empty and upper hemicontinuous.\nCondition 4. is satisfied as a result of mixed strategies. Suppose formula_36, then formula_37. i.e. if two strategies maximize payoffs, then a mix between the two strategies will yield the same payoff.\nTherefore, there exists a fixed point in formula_38 and a Nash equilibrium.\nWhen Nash made this point to John von Neumann in 1949, von Neumann famously dismissed it with the words, \"That's trivial, you know. That's just a fixed-point theorem.\" (See Nasar, 1998, p.\u00a094.)\nAlternate proof using the Brouwer fixed-point theorem.\nWe have a game formula_39 where formula_40 is the number of players and formula_41 is the action set for the players. All of the action sets formula_42 are finite. Let formula_43 denote the set of mixed strategies for the players. The finiteness of the formula_42s ensures the compactness of formula_45.\nWe can now define the gain functions. For a mixed strategy formula_46, we let the gain for player formula_2 on action formula_48 be\nformula_49\nThe gain function represents the benefit a player gets by unilaterally changing their strategy. We now define formula_50 where\nformula_51\nfor formula_52. We see that\nformula_53\nNext we define:\nformula_54\nIt is easy to see that each formula_55 is a valid mixed strategy in formula_56. It is also easy to check that each formula_55 is a continuous function of formula_58, and hence formula_59 is a continuous function. As the cross product of a finite number of compact convex sets, formula_45 is also compact and convex. Applying the Brouwer fixed point theorem to formula_59 and formula_45 we conclude that formula_59 has a fixed point in formula_45, call it formula_65. We claim that formula_65 is a Nash equilibrium in formula_67. For this purpose, it suffices to show that\nformula_68\nThis simply states that each player gains no benefit by unilaterally changing their strategy, which is exactly the necessary condition for a Nash equilibrium.\nNow assume that the gains are not all zero. Therefore, formula_69 and formula_48 such that formula_71. Then\nformula_72\nSo let\nformula_73\nAlso we shall denote formula_74 as the gain vector indexed by actions in formula_42. Since formula_65 is the fixed point we have:\nformula_77\nSince formula_78 we have that formula_79 is some positive scaling of the vector formula_80. Now we claim that\nformula_81\nTo see this, first if formula_71 then this is true by definition of the gain function. Now assume that formula_83. By our previous statements we have that\nformula_84\nand so the left term is zero, giving us that the entire expression is formula_85 as needed.\nSo we finally have that\nformula_86\nwhere the last inequality follows since formula_79 is a non-zero vector. But this is a clear contradiction, so all the gains must indeed be zero. Therefore, formula_65 is a Nash equilibrium for formula_67 as needed.\nComputing Nash equilibria.\nIf a player A has a dominant strategy formula_90 then there exists a Nash equilibrium in which A plays formula_90. In the case of two players A and B, there exists a Nash equilibrium in which A plays formula_90 and B plays a best response to formula_90. If formula_90 is a strictly dominant strategy, A plays formula_90 in all Nash equilibria. If both A and B have strictly dominant strategies, there exists a unique Nash equilibrium in which each plays their strictly dominant strategy.\nIn games with mixed-strategy Nash equilibria, the probability of a player choosing any particular (so pure) strategy can be computed by assigning a variable to each strategy that represents a fixed probability for choosing that strategy. In order for a player to be willing to randomize, their expected payoff for each (pure) strategy should be the same. In addition, the sum of the probabilities for each strategy of a particular player should be 1. This creates a system of equations from which the probabilities of choosing each strategy can be derived.\nExamples.\nIn the matching pennies game, player A loses a point to B if A and B play the same strategy and wins a point from B if they play different strategies. To compute the mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium, assign A the probability formula_96 of playing H and formula_97 of playing T, and assign B the probability formula_98 of playing H and formula_99 of playing T.\nformula_100\nThus, a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium in this game is for each player to randomly choose H or T with formula_101 and formula_102.\nOddness of equilibrium points.\nIn 1971, Robert Wilson came up with the \"oddness theorem\", which says that \"almost all\" finite games have a finite and odd number of Nash equilibria. In 1973, Harsanyi published an alternative proof of the result. \"Almost all\" here means that any game with an infinite or even number of equilibria is very special in the sense that if its payoffs were even slightly randomly perturbed, with probability one it would have an odd number of equilibria instead.\nThe prisoner's dilemma, for example, has one equilibrium, while the battle of the sexes has three\u2014two pure and one mixed, and this remains true even if the payoffs change slightly. The free money game is an example of a \"special\" game with an even number of equilibria. In it, two players have to both vote \"yes\" rather than \"no\" to get a reward and the votes are simultaneous. There are two pure-strategy Nash equilibria, (yes, yes) and (no, no), and no mixed strategy equilibria, because the strategy \"yes\" weakly dominates \"no\". \"Yes\" is as good as \"no\" regardless of the other player's action, but if there is any chance the other player chooses \"yes\" then \"yes\" is the best reply. Under a small random perturbation of the payoffs, however, the probability that any two payoffs would remain tied, whether at 0 or some other number, is vanishingly small, and the game would have either one or three equilibria instead.\nNash-solvability in Pure Strategies.\nIn 1950 Nash proved that every formula_103-person normal form game has a Nash equilibrium (NE) in mixed strategies. Yet, there are large families of games that have NE in pure strategies, for example, finite formula_103-person positional (graphical) games with perfect information. In case of two players, Nash solvability in pure strategies is equivalent to duality of hypergraphs. For zero-sum games this was shown by J. Edmonds and D. R. Fulkerson. Later this result was extended for the non-zero sum case. Interestingly, in such NE the strategy of one player doesn't depend on the preferences of the other.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\nGame theory textbooks.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOriginal Nash papers.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOther references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The origins of the city can be traced to a small fishing port; antique graves testify to a fisherman's village in the fourth century BC. The position of the future city offered a valid landing to the commerce of Roman Rubo. The first indication of a toponym on the coast between \"Turenum\" (Trani) and \"Natiolum\" (Giovinazzo) is in the \"Itinerarium Provinciarum Antonini Augusti\", edited from a third-century core. The place denominated \"Respa\" was probably a wrong transcript of the toponym \"Melpha\", referring to a small village of fishermen.\nThe first official document that mentions the city dates to November 925; it documents a \"civitas\" denominated Melfi, situated on a peninsula named Sant'Andrea. The city developed under Byzantine dominion, and was later conquered by the Lombards, who included it in the Duchy of Benevento. The city repelled repeated assaults by the Emirate of Bari. As an independent seaport, Molfetta traded with other Mediterranean markets, including Venice, Alexandria, Constantinople, Syria, Amalfi and Ragusa.\nAt the beginning of the 11th century the Normans arrived, and the autonomy that the city preserved helped foster its development as both a commercial port with the east, and as port of embarcation for pilgrims heading to the Holy Land. The Crusades permitted the city to assume a wider importance. Among the many pilgrims was Conrad of Bavaria, who was so enamoured of the city that he became venerated as San Corrado, the protecting saint of Molfetta. During the Angevin dominion the city succeeded in remaining autonomous. However, the arrival of the Aragonese kingdom to Southern Italy, spurred turbulent struggles between French, Spanish and Italians. These wars provoked death and destruction in the whole south of Italy: the Sack of Molfetta at the hands of the French, 18\u201319 July 1529, was an episode that stalled the economic rebirth of the city.\nIn February 2006, Molfetta hosted International Youth Parliament, an event which took place the previous year in Canterbury.\nGeography.\nLocated in the north-western corner of its province, near the borders with the one of Barletta-Andria-Trani, and by the Adriatic Coast, Molfetta borders with the municipalities of Bisceglie (BT), Giovinazzo, Terlizzi and Ruvo di Puglia. The town is 27\u00a0km from Andria, 31 from Barletta and 34 from Bari.\nMigration.\nDuring the times of the mass migration of Italians, mainly following World War II, many Molfettese residents migrated to Fremantle in Western Australia and to a town in South Australia called Port Pirie. The culture of Molfetta is celebrated in Fremantle and Port Pirie. Officials of both Port Pirie and Molfetta have close links today. In the United States, many Molfettese immigrants settled in the city of Hoboken, New Jersey, where a substantial enclave still exists today.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A monk of the Abbey of Cluny, he was created the cardinal-priest of San Clemente by Pope Gregory VII (1073\u201385) in 1073. He was consecrated as pope in succession to Pope Urban II (1088\u201399) on 19 August 1099. His reign of almost twenty years was exceptionally long for a medieval pope.\nEarly career.\nRanierius was born in Bleda, near Forl\u00ec, Romagna. He became a monk at Cluny at an early age.\nPapacy.\nAfter Pope Urban II's death, Paschal reacted to the success of the First Crusade by preaching the penitential Crusade of 1101. \nDuring the long struggle of the papacy with the Holy Roman emperors over investiture, Paschal II zealously carried on the Hildebrandine policy in favor of papal privilege, but with only partial success. Henry V, son of Emperor Henry IV, took advantage of his father's excommunication to rebel, even to the point of seeking out Paschal II for absolution for associating with his father. But, Henry V was even more persistent in maintaining the right of investiture than Emperor Henry IV had been before his death in 1106. The imperial Diet at Mainz invited Paschal II to visit Germany and settle the trouble in January 1106, but the pope in the Council of Guastalla (October 1106) simply renewed the prohibition of investiture.\nIn the same year, he brought to an end the investiture struggle in England, in which Anselm, archbishop of Canterbury, had been engaged with King Henry I, by retaining to himself exclusive right to invest with the ring and crozier, but recognizing the royal nomination to vacate benefices and the oath of fealty for temporal domains. Paschal went to France at the close of 1106 to seek the mediation of King Philip I and his son Louis in the imperial struggle, but he returned to Italy in September 1107, his negotiations remaining without result. When Henry V advanced with an army into Italy in order to be crowned, the pope agreed to a compact in February 1111 which stipulated that before receiving the imperial crown, Henry was to abjure all claims to investitures, whilst the pope undertook to compel the prelates and abbots of the empire to restore all the temporal rights and privileges which they held from the crown. Preparations were made for the coronation on 12 February 1111, but the Romans rose in revolt against Henry, and the German king retired, taking the pope and Curia with him.\nAfter 61 days of harsh imprisonment, during which Prince Robert I of Capua's Norman army was repulsed on its rescue mission, Paschal II yielded and guaranteed investiture to the emperor. Henry V was then crowned in St. Peter's on 13 April 1111, and, after exacting a promise that no revenge would be taken for what had happened, withdrew beyond the Alps. The Hildebrandine party was aroused to action, however; a Lateran council of March 1112 declared null and void the concessions extorted by violence; a council held at Vienne in October 1111 excommunicated the emperor; and Paschal II sanctioned the proceeding.\nPope Paschal II ordered the building of the basilica of Santi Quattro Coronati on the ashes of the one burned during the Norman sack of Rome in 1084.\nDuring Paschal's trip to France in 1106\u20131107, he consecrated the Cluniac church of Notre Dame at La Charit\u00e9-sur-Loire, the second largest church in Europe at the time.\nToward the end of his pontificate trouble began anew in England; Paschal II complained in 1115 that councils were held and bishops translated without his authorization, and he threatened Henry I with excommunication. Matilda of Tuscany was said to have bequeathed all her allodial lands to the Church upon her death in 1115, but the donation was neither publicly acknowledged in Rome nor is any documentary record of the donation preserved. Emperor Henry V at once laid claim to Matilda's lands as imperial fiefs and forced the pope to flee from Rome. Paschal II returned after the emperor's withdrawal at the beginning of 1118, but died within a few days, on 21 January 1118.\nIn 1116, Paschal II, at the behest of Count Ramon Berenguer III of Barcelona, issued a crusade for the capture of Tarragona.\nDuring Paschal's papacy some efforts were made by the Byzantine Emperor Alexios I to bridge the schism between the Orthodox and the Catholic Church, but these failed, as Paschal pressed the demand that the patriarch of Constantinople recognise the pope's primacy over \"all the churches of God throughout the world\" in late 1112. This was something Orthodox Patriarchs Nicholas Grammaticus and John Agapetus could not do in face of opposition from the majority of clergy, the monastic world, and the laity.\nPope Paschal II issued the bull \"Pie postulatio voluntatis\" on 15 February 1113. It brought under Papal protection and confirmed as a religious order the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem, later known as the Knights Hospitaller and today known as the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. It also confirmed the order's acquisitions and donations in Europe and Asia and exempted it from all authority save that of the pope.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
