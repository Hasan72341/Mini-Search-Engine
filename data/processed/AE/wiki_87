{"id": "55503", "revid": "3096637", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55503", "title": "Elizabeth Gaskell", "text": "English novelist, biographer, and short story writer (1810\u20131865)\nElizabeth Cleghorn Gaskell (\"n\u00e9e\" Stevenson; 29 September 1810 \u2013 12 November 1865), often referred to as Mrs Gaskell, was an English novelist, biographer, and short story writer. Her novels offer detailed studies of Victorian society, including the lives of the very poor. Her first novel, \"Mary Barton\", was published in 1848. Her only biography \"The Life of Charlotte Bront\u00eb\", published in 1857, was controversial and significant in establishing the Bront\u00eb family's lasting fame. Among Gaskell's best known novels are \"Cranford\" (1851\u20131853), \"North and South\" (1854\u20131855), and \"Wives and Daughters\" (1864\u20131866), all of which have been adapted for television by the BBC.\nEarly life.\nShe was born Elizabeth Cleghorn Stevenson on 29 September 1810 in Lindsey Row, Chelsea, London, now 93 Cheyne Walk. The doctor who delivered her was Anthony Todd Thomson, whose sister Catherine later became Gaskell's stepmother. She was the youngest of eight children; only she and her brother John survived infancy. Her father, William Stevenson, a Unitarian from Berwick-upon-Tweed, was minister at Failsworth, Lancashire, but resigned his orders on conscientious grounds. He moved to London in 1806 on the understanding that he would be appointed private secretary to James Maitland, 8th Earl of Lauderdale, who was to become Governor General of India. That position did not materialise, however, and Stevenson was nominated Keeper of the Treasury Records.\nHis wife, Elizabeth Holland, came from a family established in Lancashire and Cheshire that was connected with other prominent Unitarian families, including the Wedgwoods, the Martineaus, the Turners and the Darwins. When she died 13 months after giving birth to Gaskell, her husband sent the baby to live with Elizabeth's sister, Hannah Lumb, in Knutsford, Cheshire.\nHer father remarried to Catherine Thomson, in 1814. They had a son, William, in 1815, and a daughter, Catherine, in 1816. Although Elizabeth spent several years without seeing her father, to whom she was devoted, her older brother John often visited her in Knutsford. John was destined for the Royal Navy from an early age, like his grandfathers and uncles, but he did not obtain preferment into the Service and had to join the Merchant Navy with the East India Company's fleet. John went missing in 1827 during an expedition to India.\nCharacter and influences.\nMuch of Gaskell's childhood was spent in Cheshire, where she lived with her aunt Hannah Lumb in Knutsford, the town she immortalized as \"Cranford\". They lived in a large red-brick house called The Heath (now Heathwaite). She grew to be a beautiful young woman, well-groomed, tidily dressed, kind, gentle, and considerate of others. Her temperament was calm and collected, joyous and innocent, she revelled in the simplicity of rural life.\nFrom 1821 to 1826 she attended a school in Warwickshire run by the Misses Byerley, first at Barford and from 1824 at Avonbank outside Stratford-on-Avon, where she received the traditional education in arts, the classics, decorum and propriety given to young ladies from relatively wealthy families at the time. Her aunts gave her the classics to read, and she was encouraged by her father in her studies and writing. Her brother John sent her modern books, and descriptions of his life at sea and his experiences abroad.\nAfter leaving school at the age of 16, she travelled to London to spend time with her Holland cousins. She also spent some time in Newcastle upon Tyne (with the Rev William Turner's family) and from there made the journey to Edinburgh. Her stepmother's brother was the miniature artist William John Thomson, who in 1832 painted her portrait (see top right). A bust was sculpted by David Dunbar at the same time.\nMarried life and writing career.\nOn 30 August 1832 Mrs. Gaskell married Unitarian minister William Gaskell, in Knutsford. They spent their honeymoon in North Wales, staying with her uncle, Samuel Holland, at Plas-yn-Penrhyn near Porthmadog. The Gaskells then settled in Manchester, where William was the minister at Cross Street Unitarian Chapel and longest-serving chair of the Portico Library. Manchester's industrial surroundings and books borrowed from the library influenced Elizabeth's writing in the industrial genre. Their first daughter was stillborn in 1833. Their other children were Marianne (1834), Margaret Emily, known as Meta (1837), Florence Elizabeth (1842), and Julia Bradford (1846). Marianne and Meta boarded at the private school conducted by Rachel Martineau, sister of Harriet, a close friend of Elizabeth. Florence married Charles Crompton, a barrister and Liberal politician, in 1863.\nIn March 1835 Mrs. Gaskell began a diary documenting the development of her daughter Marianne: she explored parenthood, the values she placed on her role as a mother; her faith, and, later, relations between Marianne and her sister, Meta. In 1836 she co-authored with her husband a cycle of poems, \"Sketches among the Poor\", which was published in \"Blackwood's Magazine\" in January 1837. In 1840 William Howitt published \"Visits to Remarkable Places\" containing a contribution entitled \"Clopton Hall\" by \"A Lady\", the first work written and published solely by her. In April 1840 Howitt published \"The Rural Life of England\", which included a second work titled \"Notes on Cheshire Customs\".\nIn July 1841, the Gaskells travelled to Belgium and Germany. German literature came to have a strong influence on her short stories, the first of which she published in 1847 as \"Libbie Marsh's Three Eras\", in \"Howitt's Journal\", under the pseudonym \"Cotton Mather Mills\". But other influences including Adam Smith's \"Social Politics\" enabled a much wider understanding of the cultural milieu in which her works were set. Her second story printed under the pseudonym was \"The Sexton's Hero\". And she made her last use of it in 1848, with the publication of her story \"Christmas Storms and Sunshine\".\nFor some 20 years beginning in 1843, the Gaskells took holidays at Silverdale on Morecambe Bay, and in particular stayed at Lindeth Tower. Daughters Meta and Julia later built a house, \"The Shieling\", in Silverdale.\nA son, William, (1844\u201345), died in infancy, and this tragedy was the catalyst for Gaskell's first novel, \"Mary Barton\". It was ready for publication in October 1848, shortly before they made the move south. It was an enormous success, selling thousands of copies. Ritchie called it a \"great and remarkable sensation.\" It was praised by Thomas Carlyle and Maria Edgeworth. She brought the teeming slums of manufacturing in Manchester alive to readers as yet unacquainted with crowded narrow alleyways. Her obvious depth of feeling was evident, while her turn of phrase and description was described as the greatest since Jane Austen.\nIn 1850, the Gaskells moved to a villa at 84 Plymouth Grove. She took her cow with her. For exercise, she would happily walk three miles to help another person in distress. In Manchester, Elizabeth wrote her remaining literary works, while her husband held welfare committees and tutored the poor in his study. The Gaskells' social circle included writers, journalists, religious dissenters, and social reformers such as William and Mary Howitt and Harriet Martineau. Poets, patrons of literature and writers such as Lord Houghton, Charles Dickens and John Ruskin visited Plymouth Grove, as did the American writers Harriet Beecher Stowe and Charles Eliot Norton, while the conductor Charles Hall\u00e9, who lived close by, taught piano to one of their daughters. Elizabeth's friend Charlotte Bront\u00eb stayed there three times, and on one occasion hid behind the drawing room curtains as she was too shy to meet the Gaskells' other visitors.\nIn early 1850 Gaskell wrote to Charles Dickens asking for advice about assisting a girl named Pasley whom she had visited in prison. Pasley provided her with a model for the title character of \"Ruth\" in 1853. \"Lizzie Leigh\" was published in March and April 1850, in the first numbers of Dickens's journal \"Household Words\", in which many of her works were to be published, including \"Cranford\" and \"North and South\", her novella \"My Lady Ludlow\", and short stories.\nIn June 1855, Patrick Bront\u00eb asked Gaskell to write a biography of his daughter Charlotte, and consequently she published \"The Life of Charlotte Bront\u00eb\" in 1857, a significant development in Gaskell's literary career. Her choice to privilege Bront\u00eb's private life over her public literary career was unconventional and proved controversial. In 1859 Gaskell travelled to Whitby to gather material for \"Sylvia's Lovers\", which was published in 1863. Her novella \"Cousin Phyllis\" was serialized in \"The Cornhill Magazine\" from November 1863 to February 1864. The serialization of her last novel, \"Wives and Daughters\", began in August 1864 in \"The Cornhill\". She died of a heart attack in 1865, while visiting a house she had purchased in Holybourne, Hampshire. \"Wives and Daughters\" was published in book form in early 1866, first in the United States and then, ten days later, in Britain.\nHer grave is near the Brook Street Chapel, Knutsford.\nReputation and re-evaluation.\nMrs. Gaskell's reputation from her death to the 1950s was epitomised by Lord David Cecil's assessment in \"Early Victorian Novelists\" (1934) that she was \"all woman\" and \"makes a creditable effort to overcome her natural deficiencies but all in vain\" (quoted in Stoneman, 1987, from Cecil, p.\u00a0235). A scathing unsigned review of \"North and South\" in \"The Leader\" accused Gaskell of making errors about Lancashire which a resident of Manchester would not make and said that a woman (or clergymen and women) could not \"understand industrial problems\", would \"know too little about the cotton industry\" and had no \"right to add to the confusion by writing about it\".\nMrs. Gaskell's novels, with the exception of \"Cranford\", gradually slipped into obscurity during the late 19th century; before 1950, she was dismissed as a minor author with good judgment and \"feminine\" sensibilities. Archie Stanton Whitfield said her work was \"like a nosegay of violets, honeysuckle, lavender, mignonette and sweet briar\" in 1929. Cecil (1934) said that she lacked the \"masculinity\" necessary to properly deal with social problems (Chapman, 1999, pp.\u00a039\u201340).\nHowever, the critical tide began to turn in Mrs. Gaskell's favour when, in the 1950s and 1960s, socialist critics like Kathleen Tillotson, Arnold Kettle and Raymond Williams re-evaluated the description of social and industrial problems in her novels (see Moore, 1999 for an elaboration), and\u2014realising that her vision went against the prevailing views of the time\u2014saw it as preparing the way for vocal feminist movements.\nIn the early 21st century, with Mrs. Gaskell's work \"enlisted in contemporary negotiations of nationhood as well as gender and class identities\", \"North and South\" \u2013 one of the first industrial novels describing the conflict between employers and workers \u2013 was recognized as depicting complex social conflicts and offering more satisfactory solutions through Margaret Hale: spokesperson for the author and Gaskell's most mature creation.\nIn her introduction to \"The Cambridge Companion to Elizabeth Gaskell\" (2007), a collection of essays representing the current Gaskell scholarship, Jill L. Matus stresses the author's growing stature in Victorian literary studies and how her innovative, versatile storytelling addressed the rapid changes during her lifetime.\nLiterary style and themes.\nGaskell's first novel, \"Mary Barton\", was published anonymously in 1848. The best-known of her remaining novels are \"Cranford\" (1851\u20131853), \"North and South\" (1854\u20131855), and \"Wives and Daughters\" (1864\u20131866). She became popular for her writing, especially her ghost stories, aided by Charles Dickens, who published her work in his magazine \"Household Words\". Her ghost stories are in the \"Gothic\" vein, making them quite distinct from her \"industrial\" fiction.\nEven though her writing conforms to Victorian conventions, including the use of the name \"Mrs. Gaskell\", she usually framed her stories as critiques of contemporary attitudes. Her early works were highly influenced by the social analysis of Thomas Carlyle and focused on factory work in the Midlands. She usually emphasized the role of women, with complex narratives and realistic female characters. Gaskell was influenced by the writings of Jane Austen, especially in \"North and South,\" which borrows liberally from the courtship plot of \"Pride and Prejudice\". She was an established novelist when Patrick Bront\u00eb invited her to write a biography of his daughter, though she worried, as a writer of fiction, that it would be \"a difficult thing\" to \"be accurate and keep to the facts.\" Her treatment of class continues to interest social historians as well as fiction readers.\nThemes.\nUnitarianism urges comprehension and tolerance toward all religions and even though Gaskell tried to keep her own beliefs hidden, she felt strongly about these values which permeated her works; in \"North and South\", \"Margaret the Churchwoman, her father the Dissenter, Higgins the Infidel, knelt down together. It did them no harm.\"\nDialect usage.\nGaskell's style is notable for putting local dialect words into the mouths of middle-class characters and the narrator. In \"North and South\" Margaret Hale suggests \"redding up\" (tidying) the Bouchers' house and even offers jokingly to teach her mother words such as \"knobstick\" (strike-breaker). In 1854 she defended her use of dialect to express otherwise inexpressible concepts in a letter to Walter Savage Landor:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;...\u00a0you will remember the country people's use of the word \"unked\". I can't find any other word to express the exact feeling of strange unusual desolate discomfort, and I sometimes \"potter\" and \"mither\" people by using it.\nShe also used the dialect word \"nesh\" (a person who feels the cold easily or often feels cold is said to be 'nesh'), which goes back to Old English, in \"Mary Barton\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Sit you down here: the grass is well nigh dry by this time; and you're neither of you nesh folk about taking cold.\nalso in \"North and South\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;And I did na like to be reckoned nesh and soft,\nand later in \"The Manchester Marriage\" (1858):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Now, I'm not above being nesh for other folks myself. I can stand a good blow, and never change colour; but, set me in the operating-room in the Infirmary, and I turn as sick as a girl.\nand:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;At Mrs Wilson's death Norah came back to them, as a nurse to the newly-born little Edwin; into which post she was not installed without a pretty strong oration on the part of the proud and happy father; who declared that if he found out that Norah ever tried to screen the boy by falsehood, or to make him nesh either in body or mind, she should go that very day.\nPublications.\nSource:\nNovellas and collections.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nShort stories.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMedia portrayal.\nGaskell appears in the 1973 Yorkshire Television series \"The Bront\u00ebs of Haworth\", written by Christopher Fry, and her words are used to narrate the story. Gaskell is played by Barbara Leigh Hunt.\nLegacy.\nThe house on Plymouth Grove remained in the Gaskell family until 1913, after which it stood empty and fell into disrepair. The University of Manchester acquired it in 1969 and in 2004 it was acquired by the Manchester Historic Buildings Trust, which then raised money to restore it. Exterior renovations were completed in 2011; it is now open to the public as a historic house museum. In 2010, a memorial to Gaskell was unveiled in Poets' Corner in Westminster Abbey. The panel was dedicated by her great-great-great-granddaughter Sarah Prince and a wreath was laid. Manchester City Council have created an award in Gaskell's name, given to recognize women's involvement in charitable work and improvement of lives. A bibliomemoir \"Mrs. Gaskell and me: Two Women, Two Love Stories, Two centuries Apart\", by Nell Stevens was published in 2018.\nThe playwright Margaret Macnamara wrote a play based on the novel which was performed in 1949. Her novel \"Wives and Daughters\" aired on BBC television in 1999. In 2004, a television film miniseries aired on BBC television of her 1854 novel \"North and South\". In 2007, her three part novella \"Cranford\" starring Judi Dench aired on BBC television.\nThe Gaskell Memorial Hall, Silverdale's village hall, is so named because while funds were being raised for the building of the hall in 1928 a donor offered \u00a350, or \u00a3100 if it was named thus: the conversation is recorded by novelist Willie Riley in his autobiography.\nThe rebuilt Cross Street Chapel in Manchester houses a collection of memorabilia of the writer in the Gaskell Room of the new building.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nDigital collections\nPhysical collections\nOther resources"}

{"id": "55510", "revid": "12607721", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55510", "title": "Indigenous peoples in Brazil", "text": "Indigenous peoples in Brazil or Native Brazilians () are the peoples whose ancestors lived in Brazil before European contact around 1500 and those pre-Columbian forebears. Indigenous peoples once comprised an estimated 2,000 distinct tribes and nations inhabiting what is now Brazil. The 2010 Brazil census recorded 305 Indigenous ethnic groups.\nHistorically, many Indigenous peoples of Brazil were semi-nomadic and combined hunting, fishing, and gathering with migratory agriculture. Many tribes were massacred by European settlers, and others assimilated into the growing Brazilian population.\nThe Indigenous population was decimated by European diseases, declining from a pre-Columbian high of 2 million to 3 million to approximately 300,000 by 1997, distributed among 200 tribes. According to the 2022 IBGE census, 1,693,535 Brazilians classified themselves as Indigenous, divided into 391 ethnic groups and the census recorded 295 Indigenous languages. Almost 77% of Indigenous Brazilians speak Portuguese.\nOn 18 January 2007, Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Nacional do \u00cdndio reported 67 remaining uncontacted tribes in Brazil, up from 40 known in 2005. With this increase, Brazil surpassed New Guinea, becoming the country with the largest number of uncontacted peoples in the world.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nQuestions about the original settlement of the Americas have led to various hypothetical models. The origins of these Indigenous peoples remain a matter of debate among archaeologists.\nMigration into the continents.\nIn Brazil, most Native tribes living in the land by 1500 are thought to be descended from the first wave of Siberian migrants to the Americas, who are believed to have crossed the Bering Land Bridge at the end of the last Ice Age, between 13,000 and 17,000 years ago.\nGenetic studies.\nY-chromosome DNA.\nAn analysis of Amerindian Y-chromosome DNA reveals specific clustering within much of the South American population. The micro-satellite diversity and distributions of Y-chromosome lineages specific to South America suggest that certain Amerindian populations have been isolated since the initial colonization of the region.\nAutosomal DNA.\nAccording to a 2012 autosomal DNA genetic study, Indigenous peoples of the Americas descend from at least three main migrant waves from Siberia. Most of their ancestry traces back to a single ancestral population, referred to as the 'First Americans'. However, Inuit-speaking populations from the Arctic inherited nearly half of their ancestry from a second Siberian migrant wave, while Na-dene speakers inherited about one-tenth of their ancestry from a third migrant wave. The initial settlement of the Americas was followed by a rapid expansion southward along the coast, with limited gene flow later, especially in South America. An exception to this is the Chibcha speakers, whose ancestry includes contributions from both North and South America.\nmtDNA.\nAnother study, focused on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which is inherited only through the maternal line, revealed that the maternal ancestry of the Indigenous peoples of the Americas traces back to a few founding lineages from Siberia, likely arriving via the Bering Strait. According to this study, the ancestors of Indigenous peoples of the Americas likely remained near the Bering Strait for a time before rapidly spreading throughout the Americas and eventually reaching South America. A 2016 study on mtDNA lineages found that \"a small population entered the Americas via a coastal route around 16,000 years ago, following a period of isolation in eastern Beringia for approximately 2,400 to 9,000 years after separating from eastern Siberian populations. After spreading rapidly throughout the Americas, limited gene flow in South America resulted in a distinct phylogeographic structure of populations, which persisted over time. All ancient mitochondrial lineages detected in this study were absent from modern data sets, suggesting a high extinction rate. To investigate this further, we applied a novel principal components multiple logistic regression test to Bayesian serial coalescent simulations. The analysis supported a scenario in which European colonization caused a substantial loss of pre-Columbian lineages.\"\nThe Oceanic component in the Amazon region.\nTwo 2015 autosomal DNA genetic studies confirmed the Siberian origins of the Native peoples of the Americas. However, an ancient signal of shared ancestry with the Indigenous peoples of Australia and Melanesia was detected among the Native populations of the Amazon region. This migration from Siberia is estimated to have occurred around 23,000 years ago.\nArchaeological remains.\nIndigenous peoples of Brazil, unlike those in Mesoamerica or the Andes, did not keep written records or erect stone monuments. The humid climate and acidic soil have destroyed almost all traces of their material culture, including wood and bones. Therefore, what is known about the region's history before 1500 has been inferred and reconstructed from limited archaeological evidence, such as ceramics and stone arrowheads.\nThe most conspicuous remains of these societies are vast mounds of discarded shellfish, known as \"sambaquis\", found at some coastal sites that were continuously inhabited for more than 5,000 years. Additionally, substantial \"black earth\" (\"terra preta\") deposits in several places along the Amazon are believed to be ancient garbage dumps (middens). Recent excavations of these deposits in the middle and upper Amazon have uncovered remains of massive settlements, containing tens of thousands of homes, indicating a complex social and economic structure.\nStudies of the wear patterns of precontact inhabitants of coastal Brazil found that the surfaces of anterior teeth facing the tongue were more worn than those facing the lips. Researchers believe this wear was caused by using teeth to peel and shred abrasive plants.\nMarajoara culture.\nThe Marajoara culture flourished on Maraj\u00f3 island at the mouth of the Amazon River. Archaeologists have uncovered sophisticated pottery in their excavations on the island. These pieces are large, elaborately painted, and incised with representations of plants and animals. This discovery provided the first evidence of a complex society on Maraj\u00f3. Further evidence of mound building suggests that well-populated, complex, and sophisticated settlements developed on the island, as only such settlements were believed capable of undertaking extensive projects like major earthworks.\nThe extent, level of complexity, and resource interactions of the Marajoara culture have been subjects of dispute. In the 1950s, American archaeologist Betty Meggers, in some of her earliest research, suggested that the society migrated from the Andes and settled on the island. Many researchers believed that the Andes were populated by Paleoindian migrants from North America, who gradually moved south after being hunters on the plains.\nIn the 1980s, American archaeologist Anna Curtenius Roosevelt led excavations and geophysical surveys of the mound Teso dos Bichos. She concluded that the society that constructed the mounds originated on the island itself.\nThe pre-Columbian culture of Maraj\u00f3 may have developed social stratification and supported a population as large as 100,000 people. The Indigenous peoples of the Amazon rainforest may have used their method of developing and working in terra preta to make the land suitable for the large-scale agriculture to support large populations and complex social formations.\nXinguano civilisation.\nThe Xingu peoples built large settlements connected by roads and bridges, often featuring moats. Their development peaked between 13th and 17th century, with their population reaching into the tens of thousands.\nNative people after the European colonisation.\nDistribution.\nOn the eve of the Portuguese arrival in 1500, the coastal areas of Brazil were dominated by two major groups: the \"Tupi\" (speakers of Tupi\u2013Guarani languages), who occupied almost the entire length of the Brazilian coast, and the \"Tapuia\" (a general term for non-Tupi groups, usually J\u00ea-speaking peoples), who primarily resided in the interior. The Portuguese arrived at the end of a long pre-colonial conflict between the Tupis and Tapuias, which had led to the defeat and expulsion of the Tapuias from most coastal areas.\nAlthough the coastal Tupi were divided into sub-tribes that were frequently hostile to each other, they were culturally and linguistically homogeneous. The fact that early Europeans encountered essentially the same people and language along the Brazilian coast greatly facilitated communication and interaction.\nCoastal Sequence c. 1500 (north to south):\nWith the exception of the hunter-gatherer Goitacases, the coastal Tupi and Tapuia tribes were primarily agriculturalists. The subtropical Guarani cultivated maize, tropical Tupi cultivated manioc (cassava), and highland J\u00eas cultivated peanuts as the staple of their diet. Supplementary crops included beans, sweet potatoes, car\u00e1 (yam), \"jerimum\" (pumpkin), and \"cumari\" (capsicum pepper).\nBehind the coasts, the interior of Brazil was primarily dominated by Tapuia (J\u00ea) people, although significant sections of the interior (notably the upper reaches of the Xingu, Teles Pires, and Juruena Rivers, roughly corresponding to modern Mato Grosso state) were the original pre-migration Tupi-Guarani homelands. In addition to the Tupi and Tapuia, two other Indigenous mega-groups were commonly identified in the interior: the Caribs, who inhabited much of what is now northwestern Brazil, including both shores of the Amazon River up to the delta, and the Nuaraque group, whose constituent tribes inhabited several areas, including most of the upper Amazon (west of present-day Manaus) and significant pockets in modern Amap\u00e1 and Roraima states.\nThe names by which different Tupi tribes were recorded by Portuguese and French authors in the 16th century are poorly understood. Most do not seem to be proper names but rather descriptions of relationships, usually familial\u2014e.g., \"Tupi\" means \"first father,\" \"Tupinamb\u00e1\" means \"relatives of the ancestors,\" \"Tupiniquim\" means \"side-neighbors,\" \"Tamoio\" means \"grandfather,\" \"Temimin\u00f3\" means \"grandson,\" \"Tabajara\" means \"in-laws,\" and so on. Some etymologists believe these names reflect the ordering of migration waves of Tupi people from the interior to the coasts. For example, the first Tupi wave to reach the coast might have been referred to as \"grandfathers\" (Tamoio), soon joined by the \"relatives of the ancients\" (Tupinamb\u00e1), which could mean relatives of the Tamoio or a Tamoio term for relatives of the old Tupi in the upper Amazon basin. The \"grandsons\" (Temimin\u00f3) might represent a splinter group, while the \"side-neighbors\" (Tupiniquim) could denote recent arrivals still establishing their presence. However, by 1870, the Tupi tribes' population had declined to 250,000 Indigenous people, and by 1890, it had diminished to approximately 100,000.\nFirst contacts.\nWhen the Portuguese explorers first arrived in Brazil in April 1500, they found, to their astonishment, a wide coastline rich in resources and teeming with hundreds of thousands of Indigenous people living in a \"paradise\" of natural abundance. Pero Vaz de Caminha, the official scribe of Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral, the commander of the discovery fleet that landed in the present state of Bahia, wrote a letter to the King of Portugal describing in glowing terms the beauty of the land.\nIn \"Histoire des d\u00e9couvertes et conqu\u00eates des Portugais dans le Nouveau Monde,\" Lafitau described Indigenous Brazilians as not wearing clothing but painting their entire bodies red. Their ears, noses, lips, and cheeks were pierced. The men shaved the front, top of the head, and over the ears, while women typically wore their hair loose or in braids. Both men and women accessorized with musical porcelain collars and bracelets, feathers, and dried fruits. Lafitau also described the ritualistic nature of their cannibalism practices and highlighted the important role of women in the household.\nBefore the arrival of Europeans, the territory of present-day Brazil had an estimated population of between 1 and 11.25 million inhabitants. During the first 100 years of contact, the Amerindian population was reduced by 90%. This drastic decline was primarily due to diseases and illnesses brought by the colonists, compounded by slavery and European violence. The Indigenous people were traditionally semi-nomadic tribes who subsisted on hunting, fishing, gathering, and migratory agriculture. For centuries, they lived semi-nomadic lives, managing the forests to meet their needs.\nWhen the Portuguese arrived in 1500, the Native peoples primarily inhabited the coast and the banks of major rivers. Initially, Europeans viewed them as noble savages, and miscegenation began almost immediately. Portuguese claims of tribal warfare, cannibalism, and the pursuit of Amazonian brazilwood for its prized red dye convinced the colonists that they needed to \"civilize\" the Native peoples (originally, the Portuguese named Brazil Terra de Santa Cruz, but it later acquired its current name (see List of meanings of countries' names) from the brazilwood). However, like the Spanish in North America, the Portuguese brought diseases to which many Amerindians had no immunity. Measles, smallpox, tuberculosis, and influenza caused the deaths of tens of thousands. The diseases spread rapidly along Indigenous trade routes, likely leading to the annihilation of entire tribes without direct contact with Europeans.\nBy 1800, the population of Colonial Brazil had reached approximately 2.33 million, of which only around 174,900 were Indigenous. By 1850, that number had dwindled to an estimated 78,400 out of a total population of 5.8 million.\nSlavery and the bandeiras.\nThe mutual feeling of wonderment and goodwill was to end in the subsequent years. The Portuguese colonists, all males, began to have children with female Amerindians, creating a new generation of mixed-race people who spoke Amerindian languages, including a Tupi language called Nheengatu. The children of these Portuguese men and Amerindian women soon formed the majority of the population. Groups of fierce explorers organized expeditions known as \"bandeiras\" (flags) into the interior to claim territory for the Portuguese crown and to search for gold and precious stones.\nIntending to profit from the sugar trade, the Portuguese decided to cultivate sugar cane in Brazil and to use Indigenous slaves as the workforce, following the example of the Spanish colonies. However, capturing Indigenous people proved difficult. They were soon afflicted by diseases brought by the Europeans, against which they had no natural immunity, leading to high mortality rates.\nThe Jesuits.\nJesuit priests arrived with the first Governor General as clerical assistants to the colonists, with the intention of converting the Indigenous people to Catholicism. They argued that the Indigenous people should be regarded as human and succeeded in obtaining a Papal bull, \"Sublimis Deus,\" which declared that, regardless of their beliefs, they should be recognized as fully rational human beings with rights to freedom and private property, and thus should not be enslaved.\nJesuit priests, such as Fathers Jos\u00e9 de Anchieta and Manuel da N\u00f3brega, studied and recorded the Indigenous languages and founded mixed settlements, such as S\u00e3o Paulo dos Campos de Piratininga, where colonists and Amerindians lived side by side, spoke the same \"L\u00edngua Geral\" (common language), and freely intermarried. They also began to establish more remote villages inhabited only by \"civilized\" Amerindians, known as Missions or reductions (see the article on the Guarani people for more details).\nBy the middle of the 16th century, Jesuit priests, at the behest of Portugal's monarchy, had established missions throughout the country's colonies. They aimed to Europeanize and convert the Indigenous populations to Catholicism. Some historians argue that the Jesuits provided a period of relative stability for the Amerindians and opposed using them for slave labor. However, the Jesuits also contributed to European imperialism. Many historians view Jesuit involvement as an ethnocide of Indigenous culture, where the Jesuits attempted to 'Europeanize' the Indigenous Peoples of Brazil.\nIn the mid-1770s, the fragile coexistence between the Indigenous peoples and the colonists was once again threatened. Due to a complex diplomatic situation involving Portugal, Spain, and the Vatican, the Jesuits were expelled from Brazil, and their missions were confiscated and sold.\nWars.\nA number of wars broke out between various tribes, such as the Tamoio Confederation, and the Portuguese. Occasionally, the Amerindians allied with Portugal's enemies, such as the French during the France Antarctique episode in Rio de Janeiro. At other times, they sided with Portugal against rival tribes. During this period, a German soldier named Hans Staden was captured by the Tupinamb\u00e1 and later released. He documented his experiences in his famous book \"Warhaftige Historia und Beschreibung eyner Landtschafft der Wilden Nacketen, Grimmigen Menschfresser-Leuthen in der Newenwelt America gelegen\" (1557), which translates to \"True Story and Description of a Country of Wild, Naked, Grim, Man-Eating People in the New World, America\".\nThere are documented accounts of smallpox being used as a biological weapon by some Brazilian villagers seeking to eliminate nearby Amerindian tribes, not always aggressively. One notable instance, according to anthropologist M\u00e9rcio Pereira Gomes, occurred in Caxias, in southern Maranh\u00e3o. Local farmers, desiring more land for their cattle farms, gave clothing from sick villagers (which would normally have been burned to prevent further infection) to the Timbira. The clothing infected the entire tribe, who had neither immunity nor a cure. Similar incidents occurred in other villages throughout South America.\nThe rubber trade.\nThe 1840s brought trade and wealth to the Amazon with the development of the vulcanization process for rubber, leading to a worldwide surge in demand. The best rubber trees in the world grew in the Amazon, and thousands of rubber tappers began working the plantations. When the Amerindians proved to be a difficult labor force, peasants from surrounding areas were brought in. This created ongoing tension between the Indigenous population and the new arrivals, as the Amerindians felt their lands were being invaded in the pursuit of wealth.\nThe legacy of C\u00e2ndido Rondon.\nIn the 20th century, the Brazilian government adopted a more humanitarian approach and began offering official protection to the Indigenous people, including establishing the first Indigenous reserves. The situation for the Amerindians improved around the turn of the century when C\u00e2ndido Rondon, a man of both Portuguese and Bororo ancestry, and an explorer and progressive officer in the Brazilian army, began working to gain the Amerindians' trust and establish peace. Rondon, assigned to extend telegraph communications into the Amazon, was a natural explorer with a keen curiosity. In 1910, he helped establish the \"Servi\u00e7o de Prote\u00e7\u00e3o aos \u00cdndios (SPI),\" now known as FUNAI (\"Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Nacional do \u00cdndio\", National Foundation for Indians). SPI was the first federal agency tasked with protecting Amerindians and preserving their culture. In 1914, Rondon accompanied Theodore Roosevelt on his famous expedition to map the Amazon and discover new species. During these travels, Rondon was appalled by the treatment of the Indigenous people by settlers and developers, and he became their lifelong friend and protector.\nRondon, who died in 1958, is considered a national hero in Brazil. The Brazilian state of Rond\u00f4nia is named in his honor.\nSPI failure and FUNAI.\nAfter Rondon's pioneering work, the SPI was handed over to bureaucrats and military officers, and its effectiveness declined after 1957. The new officials did not share Rondon's deep commitment to the Amerindians. Instead, the SPI sought to integrate tribal groups into mainstream Brazilian society. The promise of wealth from reservation lands attracted cattle ranchers and settlers, who continued encroaching on Indigenous territories, with the SPI facilitating this intrusion. Between 1900 and 1967, an estimated 98 Indigenous tribes were wiped out.\nDue largely to the efforts of the Villas-B\u00f4as brothers, Brazil's first Indigenous reserve, the Xingu National Park, was established by the federal government in 1961.\nDuring the social and political upheaval of the 1960s, reports of mistreatment of Amerindians increasingly reached Brazil's urban centers and began to affect public opinion. In 1967, following the publication of the \"Figueiredo Report\", commissioned by the Ministry of the Interior, the military government launched an investigation into the SPI. It was soon revealed that the SPI was corrupt and failing to protect Native peoples, their lands, and their culture. The 5,000-page report cataloged atrocities including slavery, sexual abuse, torture, and mass murder. \nThe same year, the government established the Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Nacional do \u00cdndio (National Indian Foundation), known as FUNAI, which is responsible for protecting the interests, cultures, and rights of Indigenous peoples in Brazil. Some tribes have become significantly integrated into Brazilian society. The unacculturated tribes that have been contacted by FUNAI are supposed to be protected and accommodated within Brazilian society to varying degrees. By 1987, it was recognized that unnecessary contact with these tribes was causing illness and social disintegration. Uncontacted tribes are now meant to be shielded from intrusion and interference in their lifestyle and territory.\nThe military government.\nIn 1964, a seismic political shift occurred when the Brazilian military took control of the government and abolished all existing political parties, creating a two-party system. For the next two decades, Brazil was ruled by a series of generals. The country's mantra was \"Brazil, the Country of the Future,\" which the military government used to justify a massive push into the Amazon to exploit its resources, aiming to transform Brazil into one of the leading economies of the world.\nConstruction began on a transcontinental highway across the Amazon basin, designed to encourage migration to the region and facilitate trade. Funded by the World Bank, thousands of square miles of forest were cleared without regard for reservation status. Following the highway projects, giant hydroelectric projects were initiated, and vast areas of forest were cleared for cattle ranching. As a result, reservation lands suffered massive deforestation and flooding. The public works projects attracted very few migrants, but those who did arrive\u2014largely poor settlers\u2014brought new diseases that further devastated the Amerindian population.\nContemporary situation.\nThe 1988 Brazilian Constitution recognizes the right of Indigenous peoples to pursue their traditional ways of life and to the permanent and exclusive possession of their \"traditional lands,\" which are demarcated as Indigenous Territories. Additionally, Indigenous peoples are legally recognized as one of several \"traditional peoples\". In practice, however, Brazil's Indigenous people still face significant threats and challenges to their continued existence and cultural heritage. \nThe process of land demarcation is slow, often involving protracted legal battles, and FUNAI lacks sufficient resources to enforce legal protections on Indigenous lands. Since the 1980s, exploitation of the Amazon Rainforest for mining, logging, and cattle ranching had surged, which poses a severe threat to the region's Indigenous population. Settlers illegally encroaching on Indigenous land continue to destroy the environment necessary for traditional ways of life, provoke violent confrontations, and spread disease. \nGroups such as the Akuntsu and Kano\u00ea have been pushed to the brink of extinction in the past three decades. Deforestation for mining also affects the daily lives of Indigenous tribes in Brazil. For example, the Munduruku Amerindians have higher levels of mercury poisoning due to gold production in their area. On 13 November 2012, the national Indigenous people association from Brazil, APIB, submitted a human rights document to the United Nations, detailing complaints about proposed laws in Brazil that would further undermine their rights if approved.\nMany terms from Native languages have been incorporated into official Brazilian Portuguese. For example, \"Carioca,\" the term used to describe people born in the city of Rio de Janeiro, derives from the Tupi-Guaran\u00ed word meaning \"house of the white (people).\"\nWithin hours of taking office in January 2019, Bolsonaro made two major changes to FUNAI, affecting its responsibility to identify and demarcate Indigenous territories. He moved FUNAI from under the Ministry of Justice to the newly created Ministry of Human Rights, Family, and Women, and he delegated the identification of traditional habitats of Indigenous people and their designation as protected territories\u2014a task attributed to FUNAI by the constitution\u2014to the Agriculture Ministry. Bolsonaro argued that these territories had tiny, isolated populations and proposed integrating them into larger Brazilian society. Critics feared that such integration would lead to cultural assimilation of the Brazilian Natives. Several months later, Brazil's National Congress overturned these changes.\nThe European Union\u2013Mercosur free trade agreement, which aims to create one of the world's largest free trade areas, has been denounced by environmental activists and Indigenous rights campaigners. They fear that the deal could lead to increased deforestation of the Amazon rainforest by expanding market access for Brazilian beef.\nA 2019 report by the Indigenous Missionary Council on Violence Against Indigenous Peoples in Brazil documented an increase in invasions of Indigenous lands by loggers, miners, and land grabbers. The report recorded 160 cases in the first nine months of 2019, up from 96 cases for all of 2017. Additionally, the number of reported killings increased from 110 in 2017 to 135 in 2018.\nOn 5 May 2020, following an investigation by Human Rights Watch (HRW), Brazilian lawmakers released a report examining violence against Indigenous people, Afro-Brazilian rural communities, and others involved in illegal logging, mining, and land grabbing.\nIndigenous rights movements.\nUrban rights movement.\nThe urban rights movement is a recent development in the advocacy for Indigenous peoples' rights. Brazil has one of the highest levels of income inequality in the world, and a significant portion of its population includes Indigenous tribes migrating towards urban areas, both by choice and due to displacement. Beyond the urban rights movement, studies have shown that the suicide risk among the Indigenous population is 8.1 times higher than that of the non-Indigenous population.\nMany Indigenous rights movements have been created through the gathering of various Indigenous tribes in urban areas. For example, in Barcelos, an Indigenous rights movement emerged due to \"local migratory circulation.\" This is how many alliances form, creating a stronger network for mobilization. Indigenous populations living in urban areas also face struggles related to work, often being pressured into low-paying jobs. Programs like Oxfam have been used to help Indigenous people gain partnerships and start grassroots movements. Some of these projects overlap with environmental activism.\nMany Brazilian youths are mobilizing due to increased social contact, as some Indigenous tribes remain isolated while others adapt to change. Access to education also affects these youths, prompting more groups to mobilize and fight for Indigenous rights.\nEnvironmental and territorial rights movement.\nDynamics favouring recognition.\nMany of the rights and claims of Indigenous tribes align with the environmental and territorial rights movement. Although Indigenous people have secured 21% of the Brazilian Amazon as Indigenous land, many issues still threaten the sustainability of these territories today. Climate change is one reason Indigenous tribes emphasize the importance of retaining their territory.\nSome Indigenous peoples and conservation organizations in the Brazilian Amazon have formed alliances, such as the partnership between the A'ukre Kayapo village and the Instituto Socioambiental (ISA) environmental organization. They focus on environmental, educational, and developmental rights. For example, Amazon Watch collaborates with various Indigenous organizations in Brazil to fight for both territorial and environmental rights. Activists emphasize traditional conservation efforts and expanding territorial rights for Indigenous people, given that \"access to natural resources by Indigenous and peasant communities in Brazil has been considerably less and much more insecure.\" \nTerritorial rights for the Indigenous populations of Brazil are largely intertwined with socio-economic issues. There have been violent conflicts over land rights between the government and the Indigenous population, with political rights doing little to stop them. Movements like the Landless Workers' Movement (MST) work to prevent land from being concentrated in the hands of the elite in Brazil.\nDynamics opposing recognition.\nEnvironmentalists and Indigenous peoples are often viewed as opponents to economic growth and barriers to development. This perception arises because much of the land inhabited by Indigenous tribes could potentially be used for development projects, including dams and industrialization.\nGroups self-identifying as Indigenous may lack intersubjective recognition. As a result, their claims to Indigenous Territories (TIs), which often involve the demarcation of large areas of land and may dispossess established local communities, can be challenged by others. Even neighboring kinship groups might dispute these claims, arguing that those making them are not \"real Indians\" due to factors like historical intermarriage (miscegenation), cultural assimilation, and stigma against self-identifying as Indigenous. Additionally, claims to TIs can be opposed by major landowning families from the rubber era or by peasants working the land, who might instead prefer the concept of extractive reserve.\nEducation.\nThe Afro-Brazilian and Indigenous History and Culture Law (Law No. 11.645/2008) mandates the teaching of Afro-Brazilian and Indigenous History and Culture in Brazil. The law was enacted on 10 March 2008, amending Law No. 9.394 of 20 December 1996, as modified by Law No. 10.639 of 9 January 2003. It requires that the official curriculum of the Brazilian education system include the mandatory theme of Afro-Brazilian and Indigenous History and Culture.\nMajor ethnic groups.\nFor a complete list, see List of Indigenous peoples in Brazil.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "55519", "revid": "63286", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55519", "title": "NeWS", "text": "Discontinued windowing system developed by Sun Microsystems\nNeWS (Network extensible Window System) is a discontinued windowing system developed by Sun Microsystems in the mid-1980s. Originally known as \"SunDew\", its primary authors were James Gosling and David S. H. Rosenthal. The NeWS interpreter was based on PostScript (as was the later Display PostScript, although the two projects were otherwise unrelated) extending it to allow interaction and multiple \"contexts\" to support windows. Like PostScript, NeWS could be used as a complete programming language, but unlike PostScript, NeWS could be used to make complete interactive programs with mouse support and a GUI.\nDesign.\nNeWS started by implementing a PostScript interpreter running in a cooperative multitasking fashion, since, unlike PostScript in a printer, NeWS would be displaying a number of PostScript programs at the same time on one screen. It also added a complete view hierarchy, based on viewports known as \"canvases\", and a synchronous event distribution system, supporting \"events\", \"interests\", \"threads\" and \"monitors\".\nLike the view system in most GUIs, NeWS included the concept of a tree of embedded views along which events were passed. For instance, a mouse click would generate an event that would be passed to the object directly under the mouse pointer, say a button. If this object did not respond to the event, the object \"under\" the button would then receive the message, and so on. NeWS included a complete model for these events, including timers and other automatic events, input queues for devices such as mice and keyboards, and other functionality required for full interaction. The input handling system was designed to provide strong event synchronization guarantees that were not possible with asynchronous protocols like X.\nTo support user interface widgets, NeWS expanded the original PostScript stack-based language into a complete object-oriented (OO) programming style with inheritance. This eliminated the need for an external OO language to build a complete application. Since all of these additions were implemented as extensions to PostScript, it was possible to write simple PostScript code that would result in a running, onscreen, interactive program. Two popular demonstration programs were an onscreen clock, which required about two pages of code, and a program which drew a pair of eyes that followed the cursor as it moved around the screen. The eyeball program was shown at SIGGRAPH in 1988 and was the inspiration for the later well-known X application xeyes.\nNeWS included several libraries of user interface elements (widgets), themselves written in NeWS. These widgets ran all of their behavior in the NeWS interpreter, and only required communications to an outside program (or more NeWS code) when the widget demanded it. For example, a toggle button's display routine can query the button's state (pressed or not) and change its display accordingly. The button's PostScript code can also react to mouse clicks by changing its state from \"pressed\" to \"not pressed\" and vice versa. All this can happen in the windowing server without interaction with the client program, and only when the mouse is released on the button will an event be sent off for handling. This was more sophisticated than the X Window System server model, which can only report \"mouse button was clicked down here\", \"mouse is now here\", \"mouse button was released here\" events to a client, which then has to figure out if the event is in the button, switch the state, and finally instruct the server to display the new state. If client and server are not on the same machine, these interactions must travel over the network, which results in a delay in responding.\nThe best example of such a library is TNT (\"The NeWS Toolkit\") which Sun released in 1989. Sun also shipped an earlier \"Lite\" toolkit intended for example purposes and making small programs.\nPorting.\nAlthough adoption was never widespread, several companies and universities licensed NeWS and adapted it for various uses, creating both commercial and non-commercial ports.\nApplications.\nThe OPEN LOOK version of the FrameMaker desktop publishing program, developed by Frame Technology Corp. with funding mainly from Sun Microsystems and NSA, was one of the few commercial products that ran on NeWS. HyperLook, developed by Arthur van Hoff at The Turing Institute, was an interactive application design system. Don Hopkins developed a NeWS version of \"SimCity\" that was built with HyperLook.\nA commercial drawing program, Altsys Virtuoso, was produced for NeWS; it was a port of FreeHand with additional functionality that took advantage of the PostScript environment. Unfortunately Sun announced the end of support for NeWS just as Virtuoso became ready to ship.\nCompetition with X Window System.\nCompared to X, NeWS was vastly more powerful, but also slower (especially for local connections). The C API was very low level and difficult to use, so most NeWS programs tended to be entirely written in PostScript. Another factor in the popularity was that Sun charged a fee to license the NeWS source code, while the MIT X11 code was free of cost.\nThe first versions of NeWS emulated the X10 protocol by translating the calls into NeWS PostScript. Speed problems plus the existence of programs that relied on the exact pixel results of X10 calls, and the obsolescence of X10, forced Sun to release an X11/NeWS hybrid called \"Xnews\" which ran an X11 server in parallel with the PostScript interpreter. This seriously degraded the NeWS interpreter performance and was not considered a very good X11 server either. Sun also implemented the OPEN LOOK user interface specification in several toolkits: The NeWS Toolkit (TNT) was an OPEN LOOK toolkit written in PostScript that ran in the NeWS server. OLIT was built on the same Xt (X Intrinsics) base as Motif, and XView used the same APIs as Sun's earlier SunView window system.\nAfter it was clear that OPEN LOOK had lost out to Motif in popularity, and after Adobe acquired FrameMaker, Sun stopped supporting NeWS. Products based on NeWS stopped being developed.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Kelly", "text": "American R&amp;B singer (born 1967)\nRobert Sylvester Kelly (born January 8, 1967) is an American former singer and convicted sex offender. He is credited with prolific commercial success in R&amp;B, hip hop, and pop music recordings, earning nicknames such as \"the King of R&amp;B\", \"the King of Pop-Soul\", and \"the Pied Piper of R&amp;B\". In 2025, \"Billboard\" ranked him 9th on their list of the \"Best R&amp;B Artists of All Time\". In 2021 and 2022, Kelly was convicted of multiple charges of child sexual abuse, and was sentenced to 31 years in prison, effectively ending his career.\nBorn on the South Side of Chicago, Illinois, Kelly began performing in the subway under the Chicago \"L\" tracks, and regularly busked at the \"L\" stop on the Red Line's Jackson station in the Loop. During his recording career, Kelly released 18 studio albums which yielded a number of hit singles, including \"I Believe I Can Fly\", \"Bump N' Grind\", \"Your Body's Callin'\", \"Fiesta (Remix)\", \"Ignition (Remix)\", \"Step in the Name of Love (Remix)\", \"If I Could Turn Back the Hands of Time\", \"The World's Greatest\", \"I'm a Flirt (Remix)\", and the hip hopera \"Trapped in the Closet\". In 1998, he won three Grammy Awards for \"I Believe I Can Fly\". \nAlongside his recording career, Kelly's songwriting and production work was credited on albums by Michael Jackson, Britney Spears, Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, Celine Dion, Justin Bieber, Janet Jackson, Chris Brown, Aaliyah, Usher, Ciara, Toni Braxton, Luther Vandross, and Mary J. Blige. Kelly received a Grammy Award nomination for his contributions to Jackson's 1995 single, \"You Are Not Alone\", which earned a Guinness World Record as the first song to debut atop the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 in the chart's history. Kelly's 1998 collaboration with Dion, \"I'm Your Angel\", did so once more.\nKelly sold over 75 million albums and singles worldwide, making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time, and the most successful R&amp;B male artist of the 1990s. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) has recognized Kelly as one of the best-selling artists in the United States with 40 million albums sold. In 2011, Kelly was named the most successful R&amp;B artist of the last 25 years by \"Billboard\". Kelly won Grammy Awards, BET Awards, Soul Train Music Awards, \"Billboard\" Music Awards, NAACP Image Awards, and American Music Awards.\nKelly had long been the subject of accusations of sexual abuse, including that of minors, dating back to the 1990s. Following leaked video recordings, Kelly was prosecuted on child pornography charges in 2002, leading to a controversial trial that ended with his acquittal in 2008 on all charges. The 2019 documentary \"Surviving R. Kelly\" re-examined Kelly's alleged sexual misconduct with minors, prompting RCA Records to terminate his contract. Renewed interest in the allegations resulted in additional investigations by law enforcement beginning in 2019, which led to multiple indictments and Kelly's arrest. In 2021 and 2022, he was convicted on multiple charges involving child sexual abuse. As of 2025, he is serving a 31-year combined sentence at FCI Butner Medium I in North Carolina.\nEarly life.\nRobert Sylvester Kelly was born on the South Side of Chicago, Illinois, on January 8, 1967, at Chicago Lying-In Hospital (now University of Chicago Medical Center) in the city's Hyde Park neighborhood. He has five siblings (three of whom are half): two older sisters and brother, along with a younger brother and sister. His mother, Joanne, was a schoolteacher and devout Baptist. She was born in Arkansas. The identity of his father, who was absent from Kelly's life and later raised two children, is not known. His family lived in the Ida B. Wells Homes public housing project in the Black Metropolis\u2013Bronzeville District of Chicago's Douglas neighborhood, also on the city's south side. Around the time he was five years old, Kelly's mother married his stepfather, Lucious, who reportedly worked for an airline. Kelly began singing in the church choir at age eight.\nTrauma and abuse.\nKelly described having a girlfriend, Lulu, at age eight, in his 2012 autobiography \"Soulacoaster: The Diary of Me\". He stated that their last play date turned tragic when, after fighting with older children over a play area by a creek, she was pushed into the water, swept downstream by a fast-moving current, and drowned. Kelly called Lulu his first musical inspiration.\nKelly said members of his household would act differently when his mother and grandparents were not home. This included highly provocative dress and behavior. Kelly stated that when he was eight, an adult woman in the household coerced him into photographing her while having intercourse with an adult male partner.\nFrom age 8 to 14, he was often sexually abused by an older female family member. Kelly's younger brother, Carey, stated that he suffered from years of sexual abuse at the hands of their older sister, Theresa, who was entrusted with babysitting the siblings. Carey stated that although their older brother, Bruce, was spared and allowed to play outside, both he and Kelly were punished at separate times indoors by Theresa, who refused to acknowledge the abuse when confronted years later.\nExplaining why he never told anyone, Kelly wrote in his autobiography that he was \"too afraid and too ashamed\". Around age 10, Kelly was also sexually abused by an older male who was a friend of the family. In his autobiography, Kelly describes being shot in the shoulder at age 13 by boys who were attempting to steal his bike, although a family friend claims his mother disputed this, stating that the gunshot was self-inflicted during a suicide attempt.\nTurn toward music.\nIn September 1980, Kelly entered Kenwood Academy in the city's Hyde Park-Kenwood district, where he met music teacher Lena McLin, who encouraged Kelly to perform Stevie Wonder's \"Ribbon in the Sky\" in the high school talent show. A shy Kelly put on sunglasses, was escorted onto the stage, performed the song, and was awarded first prize. McLin encouraged Kelly to leave the high school basketball team and concentrate on music. She said he was furious at first, but after his performance in the talent show, he changed his mind. Kelly was diagnosed with dyslexia, which left him unable to read or write. Kelly dropped out of high school after attending Kenwood Academy for one year. He began performing in the subway under the Chicago \"L\" tracks. He regularly busked at the \"L\" stop on the Red Line's Jackson station in the Loop.\nIn his youth, Kelly played basketball with Illinois state champion basketball player Ben Wilson and later sang \"It's So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday\" at Wilson's funeral.\nCareer.\nDuring his recording career, Kelly sold over 75 million records worldwide, making him the most commercially successful male R&amp;B artist of the 1990s and one of the world's best-selling music artists. He won three Grammys for his song \"I Believe I Can Fly\", and was also nominated for his song \"You Are Not Alone\" recorded by Michael Jackson. Critics dubbed him \"the King of R&amp;B\" while he billed himself the \"Pied Piper of R&amp;B\".\n1989\u20131994: \"Born into the 90's and\" \"12 Play\".\nMGM (Musically Gifted Men or Mentally Gifted Men) was formed in 1989 with Robert Kelly, Marc McWilliams, Vincent Walker and Shawn Brooks. In 1990, MGM were offered a contract with an independent label, Tavdash Records. Shortly after, they recorded and released one single, \"Why You Wanna Play Me\". Kelly gained national recognition when MGM participated on the talent TV show \"Big Break\", hosted by Natalie Cole. MGM performed \"All My Love\", which would become a demo for Kelly's song \"She's Got That Vibe\". The group went on to win the $100,000 grand prize in 1991 before they disbanded.\nIn 1991, Kelly signed with Jive Records. Kelly's debut album, \"Born into the 90's\", was released in early 1992 (credited as R. Kelly and Public Announcement). The album, released during the new jack swing period of the early 1990s, yielded the R&amp;B hits \"She's Got That Vibe\", \"Honey Love\", \"Dedicated\", and \"Slow Dance (Hey Mr. DJ)\", with Kelly singing lead vocals. During late 1992, Kelly and Public Announcement embarked on a tour entitled \"60653\" after the zip code of their Chicago neighborhood. This would be the only album co-credited with Public Announcement. Kelly separated from the group in 1993.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWhen I create a song for myself or another artist, I see the entire thing\u2014what the song should be like, how it should be produced, how the video should look, the image of the artist for the single\u2014it's a package deal.\n\u2014 R. Kelly (1994)\nKelly's first solo album, \"12 Play\", was released on November 9, 1993, and yielded the singer's first number-one hit, \"Bump N' Grind\", which spent a record-breaking 12 weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot R&amp;B Singles chart. Subsequent hit singles: \"Your Body's Callin'\" (U.S. Hot 100: No. 13, U.S. R&amp;B: No. 2) and \"Sex Me\" (U.S. Hot 100: No. 20, U.S. R&amp;B: No. 8). Both singles sold 500,000 copies in the United States and were certified Gold by the RIAA. In 1994, \"12 Play\" was certified Gold by the RIAA, eventually going six times platinum.\nIn 1994, Kelly established himself as a leading producer by producing songs for various artists, including Aaliyah, Janet Jackson, and Changing Faces. He co-headlined a tour with Salt-N-Pepa and headlined the Budweiser Superfest tour.\n1995\u20131996 \"R. Kelly\" and \"I Believe I Can Fly\".\nIn 1995, Kelly garnered his first Grammy nominations; two for writing, producing, and composing Michael Jackson's last number-one hit, \"You Are Not Alone\".\nKelly's success continued with the November 14, 1995, release of \"R. Kelly\", his eponymous second studio album. Critics praised him for his departure from salacious bedroom songs to embracing vulnerability. \"New York Times\" contributor Stephen Holden described Kelly as \"The reigning king of pop-soul sex talks a lot tougher than Barry White, the father of such fluffed-up pillow talks and along with Marvin Gaye and Donny Hathaway, [both] major influences for Kelly.\" In December 1995, Professor Michael Eric Dyson critiqued Kelly's self-titled album \"R. Kelly\" for \"VIBE\". Dyson described Kelly's growth from the \"12 Play\" album: \"Kelly reshapes his personal turmoil to artistic benefit\" and noted that Kelly is \"reborn before our very own ears\".\nThe album reached number one on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart, becoming Kelly's first number one album on the chart, and reached number one on the R&amp;B album charts; his second. The \"R. Kelly\" album spawned three platinum hit singles: \"You Remind Me of Something\" (U.S. Hot 100: No. 4, U.S. R&amp;B: No. 1), \"I Can't Sleep Baby (If I)\" (U.S. Hot 100: No. 5, U.S. R&amp;B: No. 1), and \"Down Low (Nobody Has To Know)\" (U.S. Hot 100: No. 4, U.S. R&amp;B: No. 1); a duet with Ronald Isley. Kelly's self-titled album sold four million copies, receiving 4\u00d7 platinum certification from the RIAA. He promoted the album with a 50-city \"Down Low Top Secret Tour\" with LL Cool J, Xscape, and Solo.\nOn November 26, 1996, Kelly released \"I Believe I Can Fly\", an inspirational song originally released on the soundtrack for the film \"Space Jam\". \"I Believe I Can Fly\" reached No. 2 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, and No. 1 on the UK charts for three weeks and won three Grammy Awards in 1998. In that same year, he contributed to \"Freak Tonight\" for the \"A Thin Line Between Love and Hate\" soundtrack.\n1997\u20132001: Basketball, \"R.\", \"TP-2.com\", and Rockland Records.\nIn 1997, Kelly signed a contract to play professional basketball with the Atlantic City Seagulls of the USBL. He wore the number 12 in honor of his album \"12 Play\". Kelly said \"I love basketball enough to not totally let go of my music, but just put it to the side for a minute and fulfill some dreams of mine that I've had for a long time.\" Kelly's USBL contract contained a clause that would allow him to fulfill a music obligation when necessary. \"If Whitney Houston needs a song written\", said Ken Gross, the Seagulls owner who signed Kelly, \"he would be able to leave the team to do that and come back\". \"It wasn't a gimmick\", Gross continued, \"he's a ballplayer. He can play.\"\nIn the same year, Kelly collaborated with American rapper The Notorious B.I.G. for the song \"Fuck You Tonight\" on the posthumous album \"Life After Death\".\nIn 1998, he launched his own label, Rockland Records, in a distribution deal with Jimmy Iovine's Interscope Records. The label's roster included artists Sparkle, Boo &amp; Gotti, Talent, Vegas Cats, Lady, Frankie, Secret Weapon, and Rebecca F. That May, Sparkle, Rockland's first signed artist, released her eponymous debut album. In addition to producing and writing the project, Kelly made vocal contribution to the hit duet \"Be Careful\", which became a serious factor as to why the album was certified platinum in December 2000.\nOn November 17, 1998, Kelly released his fourth studio and first double album, \"R.\" Musically, the album spans different genres from pop (Celine Dion), street rap (Nas and Jay-Z) to Blues (\"Suicide\"). Dave Hoekstra of the \"Los Angeles Times\" described the album as \"easily the most ambitious project of his career\". In the summer of 1999, he wrote and produced a majority of the soundtrack to the Martin Lawrence and Eddie Murphy film, \"Life\", which features tracks from K-Ci &amp; JoJo, Maxwell, M\u00fda, and Destiny's Child, among others. The soundtrack was also released on the Rockland imprint.\nIn early 2000, Kelly received multiple awards reflecting his status as an established R&amp;B superstar. In January 2000, he won Favorite Male Soul/R&amp;B Artist at the American Music Awards and, in February, was nominated for several Grammy Awards, including Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance (\"When a Woman's Fed Up\"), Best R&amp;B Album (\"R.\"), and Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group (\"Satisfy You\") with P. Diddy.\nOn November 7, 2000, he released his fifth studio album, \"TP-2.com\", a project aligned with his breakthrough album, \"12 Play\". Unlike \"R.\", all songs on \"TP-2.com\" were written, arranged, and produced by Kelly. AllMusic's Jason Birchmeier gave \"TP-2.com\" 4 stars and stated: \"Kelly knows how to take proven formulas and funnel them through his own stylistic aesthetic, which usually means slowing down the tempo, laying on lush choruses of strings and background vocals, taming down the lyrics for radio, and catering his pitch primarily to wistful women.\nIn 2001, Kelly won the Outstanding Achievement Award at the Music of Black Origin or MOBO Awards and \"Billboard\" magazine ranked \"TP-2.com\" number 94 on the magazine's Top 200 Albums of the Decade. Kelly's song, \"The World's Greatest\", from the soundtrack to the 2001 autobiographical film, \"Ali\", was a hit.\n2002\u20132003: \"The Best of Both Worlds\" and \"Chocolate Factory\".\nOn January 24, 2002, at a press conference announcing the completion of Kelly and Jay-Z's first collaborative album, \"The Best of Both Worlds\", celebrities such as Johnnie Cochran, Russell Simmons, Luther Vandross, and Sean Combs praised the album, with Jay-Z stating that he hoped the collaboration represents \"more unity for black people on a whole\". MTV's Shaheem Reid wrote: \"And if Jay and Kelly can put their egos to the side long enough to wrap up and promote their album, then their labels\u2014Def Jam and Jive, respectively\u2014can surely figure out a way to join forces and make cheddar together.\"\nOn February 8, 2002, Kelly performed at the opening ceremony of the 2002 Winter Olympics, a week after a news scandal broke of a sex tape that appeared to show Kelly with an underage girl.\nFollowing a leak of the joint album on February 22, 2002, Roc-A-Fella and Jive moved the release date one week earlier in an effort to curtail piracy. Jay-Z expressed frustration about the album leak to MTV News, describing the event as both a \"gift\" and a \"curse.\" Upon release on March 19, 2002, \"The Best of Both Worlds\" sold 285,000 copies in its opening week and debuted at number two on the \"Billboard\" 200. It was a critical and commercial disappointment.\nIn May 2002, six months prior to the scheduled release of Kelly's sixth studio album, \"Loveland\", a bootleg copy containing 15 tracks had been leaked. In response, Kelly began work on the album now known as \"Chocolate Factory\", opting to release \"Loveland\" as a deluxe edition bonus disc. In October of that year, Kelly released \"Ignition (Remix)\", the lead single from the album. It would spend 42 weeks on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, peaking at number two.\nOn February 18, 2003, Kelly released \"Chocolate Factory\", which debuted as the number-one album on the \"Billboard\" 200. It sold 532,000 copies in its first week. The album was met with critical acclaim, and supported by two more singles. \"Snake\", the album's second single, was followed by \"Step in the Name of Love (Remix)\", which charted for 70 weeks, reaching number one on the R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Airplay chart. Later that year, in September, Kelly's first greatest hits album, \"The R. in R&amp;B Collection, Vol. 1\", was released which included \"Thoia Thoing\" and two other previously unreleased songs.\n2004\u20132005: \"Unfinished Business, Happy People/U Saved Me\" and \"TP.3 Reloaded\".\nBetween mid-2003 and early 2004, Kelly began work on a double CD album, one with \"happy\" tracks and another with \"inspirational\" tracks. The double album, \"Happy People/U Saved Me\", was released on August 24, 2004. It debuted at number two on the \"Billboard\" 200, with first week sales of 264,000 copies. Both of the album's title tracks respectively performed underwhelmingly; \"Happy People\" charted at number twenty-nine on the Adult R&amp;B Songs chart while \"U Saved Me\" peaked at number fifty-two on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100.\nTwo months later, Kelly and Jay-Z reunited to release their second collaborative album, \"Unfinished Business\". The album received criticism and, as with the pair's previous collaboration, it was also a commercial failure, despite debuting at number one on the \"Billboard\" 200. Album promotion and its \"Best of Both Worlds\" tour were both plagued by tension between the stars, with Kelly reportedly showing up late or not at all to gigs. Kelly complained that the touring lights were not directed towards him and allegedly assaulted the tour's lighting director.\nJay-Z eventually removed Kelly halfway through the tour, after a member of Jay-Z's entourage pepper sprayed Kelly on October 29, 2004. Tyran \"Ty Ty\" Smith was charged with assault, but took a plea deal for disorderly conduct. Kelly bounced back commercially after appearing on Ja Rule's single, \"Wonderful\" alongside Ashanti. In November 2004, \"Wonderful\" charted at number five on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and topped the UK Singles Chart. The single was certified gold by the RIAA in May 2005.\nAfter finishing \"Happy People/U Saved Me\" and \"Unfinished Business\" in 2004, Kelly released \"TP.3 Reloaded\" in July 2005. It became Kelly's fifth consecutive number-one album in his career. \"TP.3 Reloaded\" was heavily cross-promoted alongside the first five chapters of Kelly's musical serial, the \"hip hopera\" \"Trapped in the Closet\".\n2006\u20132009: \"Double Up\" and \"Untitled\", Africa.\nIn December 2006, Kelly built momentum for his eighth solo studio album, \"Double Up\", after guest-appearing on Bow Wow's \"I'm a Flirt\". Three months later, Kelly's remix of \"I'm a Flirt\" was released, but instead of Bow Wow, it featured T.I. and T-Pain. On May 29, 2007, the album was released. It became Kelly's sixth and final album in his career to chart at number one on the \"Billboard\" 200. Kelly's other singles from \"Double Up\" titled \"Same Girl\" was a duet of Kelly and Usher, while \"Rise Up\" was a tribute to the victims of the Virginia Tech shooting that occurred earlier that year in April, a month before the album was released. The song was previously released as a digital download on May 15, 2007. Proceeds were donated to the Hokie Spirit Memorial Fund to help family members of the victims of the shootings.\nKelly began his \"Double Up\" tour with Ne-Yo, Keyshia Cole and J. Holiday opening for him. One week into the tour, promoter Leonard Rowe had Ne-Yo removed from the tour because of a contract dispute. However, Ne-Yo alleges that the reason for the dropout was because Ne-Yo believes he received a better response from critics and fans. Ne-Yo won a lawsuit that he filed against Rowe Entertainment in 2008. Kelly was not mentioned in the lawsuit. In December 2007, Kelly failed to appear at another preliminary court hearing on his case due to his tour bus being held up in Utah. The judge threatened to revoke Kelly's bond, but eventually decided against it. In 2008, Kelly released a rap track titled \"I'm a Beast\" in which he coarsely attacked his detractors, yet did not name the subjects of the song.\nIn 2008, before and after being acquitted on charges of producing child sexual abuse material, \"Billboard\" reported that Kelly had plans to release his newest album titled \"12 Play: Fourth Quarter\" in the summer of that year but the album was postponed. \"Billboard\" named Kelly among the most successful artists ever for its 50th Anniversary List. In the spring, the promotional single \"Hair Braider\", peaked at No. 56 on \"Billboard\"'s R&amp;B chart. On July 28, the entire album leaked online, causing the title to be scrapped.\nIn February 2009, Kelly announced that he was working on a new album called \"Untitled\" with a projected release date of September 29, but it had been delayed to December. In June 2009, he released his first mixtape, \"The \"Demo\" Tape,\" presented by DJ Skee and DJ Drama.\nKelly headlined the Arise African Fashion Awards in Johannesburg, South Africa, on June 20, 2009. He performed in Cape Town, followed by Nigeria as part of the annual ThisDay music and fashion festival in July. That same month, he released \"Number One\", featuring singer-songwriter Keri Hilson. Then, on December 1, Kelly's untitled ninth solo album was released. It charted on the \"Billboard\" 200 at number four. More singles from the album include \"Echo\", \"Supaman High\" and \"Be My No. 2\". In January 2010, Kelly performed in Kampala, Uganda. \"I'm very excited about my first visit to Africa, I've dreamed about this for a long time and it's finally here\", Kelly said in a statement. \"It will be one of the highlights of not only my career but my life. I can't wait to perform in front of my fans in Africa\u2014who have been some of the best in the world.\"\n2010\u20132012: \"Epic\", \"Love Letter\", throat surgery, and \"Write Me Back\".\nKelly performed at the 2010 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony on June 11, 2010. In an interview in the September 2010 issue of \"XXL\" magazine, Kelly said he was working on three new albums (\"Epic\", \"Love Letter\", and \"Zodiac\") which he described as \"remixing himself\". \"Epic\", a compilation filled with powerful ballads including \"The World's Greatest\" and \"Sign of a Victory\", only saw a European release on September 21, 2010. However, it is also available for streaming worldwide.\nIn November 2010, Kelly collaborated with several African musicians forming a supergroup known as One8. The group featured 2Face from Nigeria, Ali Kiba from Tanzania, Congolese singer Fally Ipupa, 4X4 from Ghana, hip-hop artist Movaizhaleine from Gabon, Zambia's JK, Ugandan hip-hop star Navio and Kenya's Amani, the only female in the group. The first release from the group was \"Hands Across the World\" written and produced by Kelly.\nKelly's tenth album \"Love Letter\", released on December 14, 2010, included 15 songs, one of which was Kelly singing \"You Are Not Alone\", a track Kelly originally wrote for Michael Jackson. The first single \"When a Woman Loves\" was nominated for a Grammy for Best Traditional R&amp;B Vocal Performance at the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards.\nAt the 2011 Pre-Grammy Gala in Los Angeles, Kelly performed a medley of hits, and, in March 2011, Kelly was named the No. 1 R&amp;B artist of the last 25 years by \"Billboard\".\nOn July 19, 2011, Kelly was admitted to the Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago to undergo emergency throat surgery to drain an abscess on one of his tonsils, and was released on July 21, 2011. He canceled his performance at the Reggae Sumfest in Jamaica that was scheduled for the following Friday. Johnny Gourzong, Sumfest Productions executive director, commented, \"We are truly going to miss his presence on the festival.\" On September 23, 2011, \"Variety\" confirmed that Kelly had signed on to write original music for the \"Sparkle\" soundtrack.\nIn 2011, Kelly worked with writer David Ritz on an autobiography entitled \"Soulacoaster: The Diary of Me\", which was later released in the summer of 2012.\nOn October 7, 2011, after Sony's RCA Music Group announced the consolidation of Jive, Arista and J Records into RCA Records, Kelly was set to release music under the RCA brand.\nFollowing his throat surgery, Kelly released \"Shut Up\" to generally favorable reviews: \"Spin\" magazine said, \"Kelly taking aim at the haters who said \"he's washed up, he's lost it.\" He hasn't. Dude's voice is in prime smooth R&amp;B form\". On December 21, 2011, Kelly made a live appearance on \"The X Factor\" and gave his first performance after the surgery. Kelly revealed to \"Rolling Stone\" that he felt like he was \"just starting out\" and how the performance was a \"wake up call\" for him.\nIn 2012, Kelly made a series of announcements including a follow-up to the \"Love Letter\" album titled \"Write Me Back\", which was released on June 26 to little fanfare, as well as a third installment of \"Trapped in the Closet\" and The Single Ladies Tour featuring R&amp;B singer, Tamia. In February 2012, Kelly performed \"I Look to You\", a song he wrote for Whitney Houston, at Houston's homegoing.\n2013\u20132017: \"Black Panties\", \"The Buffet\", and \"12 Nights of Christmas\".\nDuring 2013, Kelly continued his \"The Single Ladies Tour\". He performed at music festivals across North America, including Bonnaroo, Pitchfork, and Macy's Music Festival. On June 30, 2013, R. Kelly performed live at the BET Awards Show singing hits as well as his new track \"My Story\" featuring Atlanta rapper 2 Chainz. The song was the lead single for Kelly's twelfth studio album \"Black Panties\". released on December 10, 2013. Writing for \"New York\" magazine, David Marchese stated that \"Black Panties\" \"was like a dare to the world: After all that he'd been accused of, after avoiding conviction, could R. Kelly still get away with making sex-obsessed music?\"\nIn 2013, Kelly collaborated with several artists including Celine Dion, Mariah Carey, Mary J. Blige, and Jennifer Hudson. In an interview with \"Global Grind\" in November, he described follow up work with Celine Dion after their number-one single \"I'm Your Angel\" from 1998. Kelly worked with singer Mariah Carey for her album \"Me. I Am Mariah... The Elusive Chanteuse\".\nKelly co-wrote and sang on Lady Gaga's song \"Do What U Want\" from her 2013 album \"Artpop\", performing the duet with her on \"Saturday Night Live\" on November 16, 2013, and at the 2013 American Music Awards. \"Do What U Want\" was later removed from streaming services and re-releases of Gaga's \"Artpop\" album following sexual misconduct allegations against Kelly in early 2019. He also collaborated with Birdman and Lil Wayne on \"We Been On\", a single from the Cash Money Records compilation, \"Rich Gang\". He also appeared on Twista's first single on his ninth album, \"Dark Horse\". On November 17, 2013, Kelly and Justin Bieber debuted a collaboration titled \"PYD\".\nKelly was featured on the soundtrack album of the film \"The Best Man Holiday\" with his song \"Christmas, I'll Be Steppin'\". Kelly stated his intention to tour with R&amp;B singer Mary J. Blige on \"The King &amp; Queen Tour\" prior to the Black Panties Tour while continuing to create segments of the hip hopera \"Trapped in the Closet\". In July 2014, Kelly announced that he was working on a house music album.\nIn November 2015, Kelly released \"Switch Up\" featuring fellow Chicagoan Jeremih and Lil Wayne, followed by \"Wake Up Everybody\", \"Marching Band\" and \"Backyard Party\". The following month, the album containing those singles, \"The Buffet\", was released. It charted poorly on the \"Billboard\" 200 at number sixteen with first-week sales of 39,000 album-equivalent copies. During November 2015, R. Kelly released a song with Ty Dolla Sign called \"Actress\" off the album \"Free TC\". The following year, after a two-and-a-half-year delay, Kelly presented his only Christmas album, also his fourteenth and final studio album in his career thus far, \"12 Nights of Christmas\", which was released on October 21, 2016.\n2017\u20132022: Guest appearances, \"I Admit\".\nOn March 17, 2017, Pitbull released the song \"Dedicated\" off his album \"Climate Change\" featuring guest appearances from Kelly and Austin Mahone.\nKelly released the 19-minute-long \"I Admit\" on SoundCloud on July 23, 2018, as a response to his accusers. The song does not contain any criminal admissions despite its title and chorus, which repeats the lyric \"I admit it, I did it\". In \"I Admit\", Kelly denies allegations of domestic violence and pedophilia, asserting that they are matters of opinion. Kelly also denounces Jim DeRogatis and repudiates his investigative report's claim of Kelly operating a \"sex cult\". Addressing the Mute R. Kelly social media campaign, Kelly sings, \"only God can mute me\".\nThe song was criticized by reviewers, who described it as an act of trolling. Many outlets compared the song to that of his \"Heaven I Need a Hug\" extended version, \"Trapped in the Closet\" opera, \"I Believe I Can Fly\" concert remix, and O. J. Simpson's autobiographical novel \"If I Did It\". Andrea Kelly and Carey Killa Kelly (R. Kelly's ex-wife and brother, respectively) responded to \"I Admit\" with songs that contain additional allegations against R. Kelly.\nAn album credited to Kelly titled \"I Admit It\" after and including the 19-minute song from 2018 was released on streaming services on December 9, 2022, but was taken down after it was not approved by Sony or R. Kelly's team. The album was credited to Sony's Legacy Recordings but actually uploaded by Real Talk Entertainment, who had released the album through a sub-label also named Legacy Recordings. This resulted in the credited distributor, Universal Music Group\u2013owned Ingrooves, cutting ties with Real Talk Entertainment.\nArtistry.\nMusical style and influences.\nKelly's music took root in R&amp;B, hip hop and soul. He was influenced by listening to his mother, Joanne Kelly, sing. She played records by Stevie Wonder, Donny Hathaway and Marvin Gaye, inspirations for Kelly. In reference to Hathaway, Kelly stated: \"A guy like Donny Hathaway had a focused, sexual texture in his voice that I always wanted in mine. He had smooth, soulful tones, but he was spiritual at the same time. In his autobiography, Kelly stated that he was heavily influenced by Marvin Gaye's R&amp;B Lothario image. \"I had to make a 'baby-makin'' album. If Marvin Gaye did it, I wanted to do it\", Kelly said.\nWhile Kelly created a smooth, professional mixture of hip-hop beats, soulman crooning and funk, the most distinctive element of his music is its explicit sensuality. \"Sex Me\", \"Bump n' Grind\", \"Your Body's Callin'\", and \"Feelin' on Yo Booty\" are considered to be examples, as their productions were seductive enough to sell such blatant come-ons. Kelly's crossover appeal was also sustained by his development of a flair for pop balladry.\nVocal style and lyrical themes.\nWriting for the \"New York Daily News\" in 1997, Nunyo Demasio stated \"With a voice that easily shifts from booming baritone to seductive alto, Kelly has gained international celebrity by combining streetwise rhythms with sexually explicit lyrics.\" Love and sex are the topics of the majority of Kelly's lyrical content, although he has written about a wide variety of themes such as inspiration and spirituality. \"Chicago Sun-Times\" reporters Jim DeRogatis and Abdon Pallasch observed about the contrasting themes: \"... the image he liked to project was that of the \"R&amp;B Thug\"... bringing the streetwise persona of the gangsta rapper into the more polite world of R&amp;B.\"\nKelly expressed that he writes from everyday experiences and prides himself on being versatile. Larry Khan, senior vice president of Jive's urban marketing and promotion, said that Kelly's musical compass is second to none. DeRogatis and Pallasch reported that at concerts where Kelly would go from singing \"Like a Real Freak\" to \"I Wish\": \"Many fans found these abrupt shifts between the transcendent and the venal, the inspirational and the X-rated jarring.\"\nInfluence.\nKelly is considered to be one of the most successful R&amp;B artists since the mid-1980s. He is also one of the bestselling music artists in the United States, with over 30 million albums sold, as well as only the fifth black artist to enter the top 50 of the same list. \"Rolling Stone\" magazine called him \"arguably the most important R&amp;B figure of the 1990s and 2000s\". \"Billboard\", ranking him the 9th greatest R&amp;B artist of all time, said \"from a purely musical perspective, there\u2019s no denying that Kelly is one of the best contemporary R&amp;B artists to ever pick up a microphone.\" Music executive Barry Weiss described Kelly as \"the modern-day Prince, although there's a bit of Marvin Gaye in him, and a bit of Irving Berlin\". R. Kelly has also been compared to artists like Sam Cooke and Bobby Brown.\nIn addition to his solo and collaboration success, Kelly has also written and produced several hit songs, such as \"Age Ain't Nothing but a Number\" for Aaliyah, \"Fortunate\" for Maxwell, \"You Are Not Alone\" for Michael Jackson, \"G.H.E.T.T.O.U.T.\" for Changing Faces, \"Bump, Bump, Bump\" for B2K, and many more.\nHonors and awards.\nKelly has received and been nominated for multiple awards, as a songwriter, producer, and singer. He won three Grammy Awards for his song \"I Believe I Can Fly\": Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance, Best Rhythm and Blues Song, and Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or for Television. After Kelly's federal conviction in New York, The Recording Academy stated in 2021 they wouldn't strip Kelly of his awards despite his \"disturbing\" actions.\nKelly was given a key to the city of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in 2013 as \"an artist whose music brings generations together\". On September 30, 2021, following his New York conviction of multiple sex crimes, the key was rescinded.\nLegal issues.\nKelly has faced repeated accusations of sexual abuse for incidents dating from 1991 to 2018 and has been the subject of a long-term investigation by the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" since August 2000. He has been tried in multiple civil suits and criminal trials, starting in 1996 when Tiffany Hawkins alleged that, starting in 1991 when she was age 15, Kelly, aged 24, had sexual relations with her and encouraged her to entice underaged friends. Following leaked video recordings, Kelly was prosecuted on child pornography charges in 2002, leading to a controversial trial that ended with his acquittal in 2008 on all charges. The 2019 documentary \"Surviving R. Kelly\" reexamined Kelly's alleged sexual misconduct with minors, prompting RCA Records to terminate his contract and resulted in additional investigations by law enforcement beginning in 2019. This culminated in a 2021 conviction for violations of the Mann Act and Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, and a 2022 conviction for production of child pornography. As of 2023, he is serving a 31-year combined sentence at FCI Butner Medium I. On July 30, 2024, multiple news outlets reported that Kelly, alongside his lawyer Jennifer Bonjean, had asked the Supreme Court to review his child pornography case, which could potentially drop 20 years off his sentence. On June 13, 2025, Kelly was hospitalized following an apparent overdose while incarcerated at the Federal Correctional Institute in North Carolina. His attorneys allege that after being placed in solitary confinement on June 10, he was initially given anxiety medication, followed by an increased dosage on June 12. They claim this led to dizziness and vision loss before he collapsed. He was transported to Duke University Hospital, where medical evaluations reportedly revealed blood clots in his lungs and legs. Despite these concerns, Kelly remained under medical observation for two days before being discharged and returned to prison on June 15 against medical advice. His attorneys subsequently filed an emergency motion for release, citing mistreatment and concerns over his safety in custody.\nOther court cases.\nOther than the federal sex abuse cases, Kelly has been involved in several high-profile criminal cases and lawsuits.\nPersonal life.\nKelly's mother, Joanne, died from cancer in 1993. He has given conflicting accounts of where he was during his mother's death. His oldest daughter, JoAnn (b. 1998), was named after the singer's mother, but is also known as Buku Abi.\nIn 1996, Kelly married Andrea Kelly (n\u00e9e Lee), his former backup dancer and mother of his three children, the aforementioned JoAnn, as well as Jaah (b. 2000), and Robert Jr. (b. 2002). Andrea filed a restraining order against Kelly in September 2005 after a physical altercation, ultimately filing for divorce in 2006. In January 2009, their divorce was finalized after 13 years of marriage. In later years, Andrea accused Kelly of physical, verbal, and mental abuse, including in \"Surviving R. Kelly\" (2019).\nKelly reportedly had a long relationship with gospel singer Deleon Richards in the 1990s. In 2005, a Chicago man was charged for attempting to extort Richards' husband, Gary Sheffield, by allegedly threatening to release a sex tape of Richards with an ex-boyfriend, reportedly Kelly. In January 2006, the man was sentenced to 27 months in prison.\nPhilanthropy.\nIn April 2007, Kelly released the song \"Rise Up\" for Virginia Tech after the 2007 school shooting and donated the net proceeds to the families of the victims. In 2010, he penned the song \"Sign of a Victory\" for the FIFA World Cup, with all proceeds benefiting African charities. On April 6, 2011, he performed at a charity event in Chicago benefiting Clara's House, a facility designed to build employment, housing, health care, and education in the projects of Chicago. In 2016, Kelly donated cases of water to the Flint water crisis.\nDiscography.\nSolo studio albums\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCollaborative studio albums\nTours.\nKelly toured extensively as a live musician.

The dates of the festivals vary somewhat among the different churches, although the sequence and logic is largely the same.\nLiturgical cycle.\nThe liturgical cycle divides the year into a series of seasons, each with their own mood, theological emphases, and modes of prayer, which can be signified by different ways of decorating churches, colours of paraments and vestments for clergy, scriptural readings, themes for preaching and even different traditions and practices often observed personally or in the home. In churches that follow the liturgical year, the scripture passages for each Sunday (and even each day of the year in some traditions) are specified in a lectionary.\nAfter the Protestant Reformation, Anglicans and Lutherans continued to follow the lectionary of the Roman Rite. Following a decision of the Second Vatican Council, the Catholic Church revised that lectionary in 1969, adopting a three-year cycle of readings for Sundays and a two-year cycle for weekdays.\nAdaptations of the revised Roman Rite lectionary were adopted by Protestants, leading to the publication in 1994 of the Revised Common Lectionary for Sundays and major feasts, which is now used by many Protestant denominations, including also Methodists, United, some Reformed, etc. This has led to a greater awareness of the traditional Christian year among Protestants, especially among mainline denominations.\nBiblical calendars.\nScholars are not in agreement about whether the calendars used by the Jews before the Babylonian exile were solar (based on the return of the same relative position between the Sun and the Earth), lunisolar (based on months that corresponded to the cycle of the moon, with periodic additional months to bring the calendar back into agreement with the solar cycle) like the present-day Jewish calendar of Hillel II, or lunar, such as the Hijri calendar.\nThe first month of the Hebrew year was called (Aviv), meaning the month of green ears of grain. Having to occur at the appropriate time in the spring, it thus was originally part of a tropical calendar. At about the time of the Babylonian exile, when using the Babylonian civil calendar, the Jews adopted the term (Nisan) as the name for the month, based on the Babylonian name Nisanu. Thomas J Talley says that the adoption of the Babylonian term occurred even before the exile.\nIn the earlier calendar, most of the months were simply called by a number (such as \"the fifth month\"). The Babylonian-derived names of the month that are used by Jews are:\nIn Biblical times, the following Jewish religious feasts were celebrated:\nEastern Christianity.\nEast Syriac Rite.\nThe Liturgical Calendar of the East Syriac Rite is fixed according to the flow of salvation history. With a focus upon the historical life of Jesus Christ, believers are led to the eschatological fulfillment (i.e. the heavenly bliss) through this special arrangement of liturgical seasons. The liturgical year is divided into 8 seasons of approximately 7 weeks each but adjusted to fit the solar calendar. The arrangement of the Seasons in the Liturgical Year is based on seven central events on celebrations of the Salvation History. They are:\nOne of the oldest available records mentioning the liturgical cycle of east-syriac rite is handwritten manuscript named 'Preface to Hudra' written by Rabban Brick-Iso in 14th century. The manuscript mentions that the liturgical year is divided into nine seasons starting from Subara and ends with Qudas Edta. Catholic churches of east-syriac rite maintains the same liturgical calendar until the current date except that many consider 7th and 8th seasons as a single one. The biblical reading and prayers during Mass and Liturgy of the Hours vary according to different seasons in the liturgical calendar.\nLiturgical Calendar.\nThe various seasons of the liturgical calendar of Syro-Malabar Church and Chaldean Catholic Church are given below.\nAnnunciation (Subara).\nWeeks of Annunciation (Subara) is the first season of the liturgical year. The liturgical year begins with the commemoration of biblical events leading to the annunciation and birth of Jesus as expected savior in the old testament. The season begins on the Sunday just before the first of December and ends with the feast of Epiphany that is the Feast of the Baptism of Jesus. The faithful practice abstinence during December 1\u201325 in preparation for Christmas; this period is called \"25 days Lent\".\nFeasts celebrated during this season\nEpiphany (Denha).\nWeeks of Epiphany begins on the Sunday closest to the feast of Epiphany and runs to the beginning of Great Fast. The word \"denha\" in Syriac means sunrise. Church considers the baptism of Jesus in the River Jordan as the first historical event in which the Trinity was revealed to humankind in the person of Jesus Christ. Thus the season commemorates the manifestation or revelation of Jesus and Trinity to the world. During the season the church celebrates the feasts of Saints in connection with the manifestation of the Lord.\nFeasts celebrated during the period\nGreat Fast (Sawma Rabba).\nDuring these weeks the faithful meditate over the 40-day fast of Jesus and the culmination of his public life in passion, death and burial. The season begins 50 days before Easter on Peturta Sunday and comprises the whole period of Great Lent and culminates on Resurrection Sunday. Word Peturta in Syriac means \"looking back\" or \"reconciliation\". \nFaithful enter the weeks of Great Fast, celebrating the memory of all the Faithful Departed on the last Friday of Denha.\nAccording to the ecclesial tradition, the weeks of Great Fast is also an occasion to keep up the memory of the beloved Departed through special prayers, renunciation, almsgiving, and so on and thus prepare oneself for a good death and resurrection in Jesus Christ. During the fast faithful of Syro Malabar Church do not use meat, fish, egg, many dairy products, and most favorite food items, and avoid sexual contacts on all days including Sundays and Feast days. Before European colonization, Indian Nasranis used to have food only once a day (after 3:00 pm) on all days during Great Fast.\nFeasts in the Lenten Season\nThe following feasts are always in the Lenten Season:\nResurrection (Qyamta).\nThe weeks of Great Resurrection begin on the Resurrection Sunday and run to the feast of Pentecost. The Church celebrates the Resurrection of our Lord during these seven weeks: Jesus' victory over death, sin, suffering and Satan. The church also commemorates various events that occurred after the resurrection of Christ, such as the visits of Jesus to the Apostles and the ascension of Jesus.\nAccording to eastern Christianity, the Feast of Resurrection is the most important and the greatest feast in a liturgical year. Therefore, the season commemorating the resurrection of Christ is also of prime importance in the church liturgy. The first week of the season is celebrated as the 'Week of weeks' as it is the week of the resurrection of Christ.\nFeasts celebrated during the period:\nThe following feasts are always in the season of resurrection:\nApostles (Slihe).\nWeeks of apostles (Slihe) starts on the feast of Pentecost, fiftieth day of the Resurrection Sunday. During these days the church commemorates the inauguration of church and the acts of apostles and church fathers through which the foundation of the church was laid. Church meditates on the virtues of the early church: fellowship, breaking of bread and sharing of wealth, and the fruits and gifts of Holy Spirit. The spread of the church all over the world as well as her growth is also remembered during this season.\nFeast celebrated during the season:\nThe following feasts are commemorated in the season of Slihe\nQaita (Summer).\nAlong the weeks of Qaita maturity and fruitfulness of church are commemorated. The Syriac word Qaita means \"summer\" and it is a time of harvest for the Church. The fruits of the Church are those of holiness and martyrdom. While the sprouting and infancy of the Church were celebrated in 'the Weeks of the Apostles,' her development in different parts of the world by reflecting the image of the heavenly Kingdom and giving birth to many saints and martyrs are proclaimed during this season. Fridays of this Season are set apart for honoring saints and martyrs.\nFeast celebrated during the season:\nThe following feasts are commemorated in the season of Qaita\nEliyah-Sliba-Moses.\nThe name of the seasons of Eliyah-Sliba-Moses takes their origin from the feast of the transfiguration of Jesus. And the seasons revolve around the exaltation of the cross on the feast of the glorious cross on September 14. During the seasons of Eliyah and Sliba church reminds the faithful of the heavenly bliss which is promised to be inherited at the end of earthly life and the church commemorates the exaltic experience of the bliss through various sacraments. While during the season of Moses church meditates upon the end of time and the last judgment. Many at times the season of Moses is regarded as a distinct and separate season from the other two since it has a distinct theme.\nThe season of Eliyah has a length of one to three Sundays. Season of Sliba starts on Sunday on or after the feast of the glorious cross and has a length of three to four weeks. The first Sunday of Sliba is always considered as the fourth Sunday of the combined season. The season of Moses always has four weeks.\nFeast celebrated during the seasons:\nThe following feasts are commemorated in the seasons of Eliyah-Sliba-Moses\nDedication of the church (Qudas Edta).\nThe weeks of the dedication of the church is the last liturgical season in the East Syriac rite. It consists of four weeks and ends on the Saturday before Sunday between November 27 and December 3. The theme of the season is that the church is presented by Christ as his eternal bride before his father at the heavenly bride chamber. The period has its origin in the feast of the dedication of the church of Sephelcure or the Jewish feast of Hanukkah. However, the season was officially instituted by Patriarch Isho-Yahb III of Seleucia-Ctesiphon (647\u2013657) by separating it from the season of Moses.\nFeasts celebrated during the season:\nEastern Orthodox Church.\nThe liturgical year in the Eastern Orthodox Church is characterized by alternating fasts and feasts, and is in many ways similar to the Catholic year. However, Church New Year (Indiction) traditionally begins on September 1 (Old Style or New Style), rather than the first Sunday of Advent. It includes both feasts on the Fixed Cycle and the Paschal Cycle (or Moveable Cycle). The most important feast day by far is the Feast of Pascha (Easter) \u2013 the Feast of Feasts. Then the Twelve Great Feasts, which commemorate various significant events in the lives of Jesus Christ and of the Theotokos (Virgin Mary).\nThe majority of Orthodox Christians (Russians, in particular) follow the Julian Calendar in calculating their ecclesiastical feasts, but many (including the Ecumenical Patriarchate and the Church of Greece), while preserving the Julian calculation for feasts on the Paschal Cycle, have adopted the Revised Julian Calendar (at present coinciding with the Gregorian Calendar) to calculate those feasts which are fixed according to the calendar date.\nBetween 1900 and 2100, there is a thirteen-day difference between the dates of the Julian and the Revised Julian and Gregorian calendars. Thus, for example, where Christmas is celebrated on December 25 O.S. (Old Style), the celebration coincides with January 7 in the Revised Calendar. The computation of the day of Pascha (Easter) is, however, always computed according to a lunar calendar based on the Julian Calendar, even by those churches which observe the Revised Calendar.\nThere are four fasting seasons during the year: The most important fast is Great Lent which is an intense time of fasting, almsgiving and prayer, extending for forty days prior to Palm Sunday and Holy Week, as a preparation for Pascha. The Nativity Fast (Winter Lent) is a time of preparation for the Feast of the Nativity of Christ (Christmas), but whereas Advent in the West lasts only four weeks, Nativity Fast lasts a full forty days. The Apostles' Fast is variable in length, lasting anywhere from eight days to six weeks, in preparation for the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul (June 29). The Dormition Fast lasts for two weeks from August 1 to August 14 in preparation for the Feast of the Dormition of the Theotokos (August 15). The liturgical year is so constructed that during each of these fasting seasons, one of the Great Feasts occurs, so that fasting may be tempered with joy.\nIn addition to these fasting seasons, Orthodox Christians fast on Wednesdays and Fridays throughout the year (and some Orthodox monasteries also observe Monday as a fast day). Certain fixed days are always fast days, even if they fall on a Saturday or Sunday (in which case the fast is lessened somewhat, but not abrogated altogether); these are: The Decollation of St. John the Baptist, the Exaltation of the Cross and the day before the Epiphany (January 5). There are several fast-free periods, when it is forbidden to fast, even on Wednesday and Friday. These are: the week following Pascha, the week following Pentecost, the period from the Nativity of Christ until January the 5th and the first week of the Triodion (the week following the 17th Sunday before Pentecost).\nPascha.\nThe greatest feast is Pascha. Easter for both East and West is calculated as the first Sunday after the full moon that falls on or after March 21 (nominally the day of the vernal equinox), but the Orthodox calculations are based on the Julian calendar, whose March 21 corresponds at present with April 3 of the Gregorian calendar, and on calculations of the date of full moon different from those used in the West (see computus for further details).\nThe date of Pascha is central to the entire ecclesiastical year, determining not only the date for the beginning of Great Lent and Pentecost, but affecting the cycle of moveable feasts, of scriptural readings and the Octoechos (texts chanted according to the eight ecclesiastical modes) throughout the year. There are also a number of lesser feasts throughout the year that are based upon the date of Pascha. The moveable cycle begins on the Zacchaeus Sunday (the first Sunday in preparation for Great Lent or the 33rd Sunday after Pentecost as it is known), though the cycle of the Octoechos continues until Palm Sunday.\nThe date of Pascha affects the following liturgical seasons:\nThe twelve Great Feasts.\nSome of these feasts follow the Fixed Cycle, and some follow the Moveable (Paschal) Cycle. Most of those on the Fixed Cycle have a period of preparation called a Forefeast, and a period of celebration afterward, similar to the Western Octave, called an Afterfeast. Great Feasts on the Paschal Cycle do not have Forefeasts. The lengths of Forefeasts and Afterfeasts vary, according to the feast.\nNote: In Eastern practice, should this feast fall during Holy Week or on Pascha itself, the feast of the Annunciation is not transferred to another day. In fact, the conjunction of the feasts of the Annunciation and Pascha (\"dipli Paschalia\", ) is considered an extremely festive event.\nOther feasts.\nSome additional feasts are observed as though they were Great Feasts:\nEvery day throughout the year commemorates some saint or some event in the lives of Christ or the Theotokos. When a feast on the moveable cycle occurs, the feast on the fixed cycle that was set for that calendar day is transferred, with the propers of the feast often being chanted at Compline on the nearest convenient day.\nCycles.\nIn addition to the Fixed and Moveable Cycles, there are a number of other liturgical cycles in the ecclesiastical year that affect the celebration of the divine services. These include, the Daily Cycle, the Weekly Cycle, the Cycle of Matins Gospels, and the Octoechos.\nWestern Christianity.\nWestern Christian liturgical calendars are based on the cycle of the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church, and are also followed in many Protestant churches, including the Lutheran, Anglican, and other traditions. Generally, the seasons in liturgical western Christianity are Advent, Christmas, Ordinary Time (Time after Epiphany), Lent, Easter, and Ordinary Time (Time after Pentecost). Some Protestant traditions do not include Ordinary Time: every day falls into a denominated season. Other Protestant churches, such as a minority in the Reformed tradition, reject the liturgical year entirely on the grounds that its observance is not directed in scripture.\nFor those that follow the Western liturgical year, the Revised Common Lectionary provides scriptural structure for the patterns of the seasons. Protestant denominations that follow this lectionary include Methodists, Anglicans/Episcopalians, Lutherans, Presbyterians, some Baptists and Anabaptists, among others. With regard to the calendars of the Western Christian Churches that use the Revised Common Lectionary, Vanderbilt University Professor Hoyt L. Hickman, states that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;All these calendars agree that the Lord's Day is of primary importance among the observances of the year and that the Christian Year contains two central cycles \u2013 the Easter cycle and the Christmas cycle. Each cycle includes a festival season (Easter and Christmas), preceded by a season of preparation and anticipation (Lent and Advent). In most denominational versions and in the \"Common Lectionary\", Lent and Advent are immediately preceded by a transitional Sunday (Transfiguration and Christ the King), and the Easter and Christmas Seasons are immediately followed by a transitional Sunday (Trinity and Baptism of the Lord).\nProtestant Churches, with exception of the Lutheran and Anglican, generally observe fewer if any feasts with regard to the saints than the aforementioned liturgical denominations, in addition to the Catholic and Orthodox Churches.\nDenominational specifics.\nCatholic Church.\nIn summary, the Catholic Church \"unfolds within the cycle of a year ... the whole mystery of Christ, from the incarnation and birth until the ascension, the day of Pentecost, and the expectation of blessed hope and of the coming of the Lord. Recalling thus the mysteries of redemption, the Church opens to the faithful the riches of her Lord's powers and merits, so that these are in some way made present for all time, and the faithful are enabled to lay hold upon them and become filled with saving grace.\" Within this cycle, the resurrection of Jesus is celebrated both weekly, on Sundays, and annually, at Easter, \"together with His blessed passion\". A number of changes to the Catholic Church's liturgical year were put in place by the Second Vatican Council.\nVarious other events in the life of Christ and his saints are also recalled and celebrated on specific days or seasons of each year.\nThere are many forms of liturgy in the Catholic Church. Even putting aside the many Eastern rites in use, the Latin liturgical rites alone include the Ambrosian Rite, the Mozarabic Rite, and the Cistercian Rite, as well as other forms that have been largely abandoned in favour of adopting the Roman Rite. There are also historical versions of the liturgy that varied greatly from the present one, such those used by the Anglo-Saxon Church.\nThe liturgical calendar in that form of the Roman Rite (see General Roman Calendar) of 1960 differs in some respects from that of the present form of the Roman Rite.\nAnglican Church.\nThe Church of England, Mother Church of the Anglican Communion, uses a liturgical year that is in most respects identical to that of the 1969 Catholic Common Lectionary. While the calendars contained within the \"Book of Common Prayer\" and the \"Alternative Service Book\" (1980) have no \"Ordinary Time\", \"Common Worship\" (2000) adopted the ecumenical 1983 Revised Common Lectionary. The few exceptions are Sundays following Christmas and Transfiguration, observed on the last Sunday before Lent instead of on \"Reminiscere\".\nIn some Anglican traditions (including the Church of England) the Christmas season is followed by an Epiphany season, which begins on the Eve of the Epiphany (on January 6 or the Sunday after January 1) and ends on the Feast of the Presentation (on February 2 or the Sunday after January 27). Ordinary Time begins after this period.\nThe \"Book of Common Prayer\" contains within it the traditional Western Eucharistic lectionary which traces its roots to the \"Comes\" of St. Jerome in the 5th century. Its similarity to the ancient lectionary is particularly obvious during Trinity season (Sundays after the Sunday after Pentecost), reflecting that understanding of sanctification.\nReformed Churches.\nReformed Christians emphasize weekly celebration of the Lord's Day. While some of them celebrate also what they call the five evangelical feasts, others celebrate no holy days but the Lord's Day and reject the liturgical year as non-scriptural, and as therefore inconsistent with the regulative principle of worship.\nLiturgical calendar.\nAdvent.\nAdvent (from the Latin word \"adventus\", which means \"arrival\" or \"coming\") is the first season of the liturgical year. It begins four Sundays before Christmas, the Sunday falling on or nearest to November 30, and ends on Christmas Eve. Traditionally observed as a \"fast\", it focuses on preparation for the coming of Christ, not only the coming of the Christ-child at Christmas, but also, in the first weeks, on the eschatological final coming of Christ, making Advent \"a period for devout and joyful expectation\".\nThis season is often marked by the Advent Wreath, a garland of evergreens with four candles. Although the main symbolism of the advent wreath is simply marking the progression of time, many churches attach themes to each candle, most often 'hope', 'faith', 'joy', and 'love'. Other popular devotions during Advent include the use of the Advent Calendar or the Tree of Jesse to count down the days to Christmas.\n\"Liturgical colour\": violet or purple; blue in some traditions, such as Anglican/Episcopalian, Methodist, and Lutheran.\nChristmastide.\nThe Christmas season immediately follows Advent. The traditional Twelve Days of Christmas begin with Christmas Eve on the evening of December 24 and continue until the feast of Epiphany. The actual Christmas season continues until the Feast of the Baptism of Christ, which is celebrated on the Sunday after January 6, or the following Monday if that Sunday is kept as Epiphany.\nIn the pre-1970 form, this feast is celebrated on January 13, unless January 13 is a Sunday, in which case the feast of the Holy Family is celebrated instead. Until the suppression of the Octave of the Epiphany in the 1960 reforms, January 13 was the Octave day of the Epiphany, providing the date for the end of the season.\nTraditionally, the end of Christmastide was February 2, or the Feast of the Presentation of the Lord, also known as Candlemas. This feast recounts the 40 days of rest Mary took before being purified and presenting her first-born son to the Temple in Jerusalem. In medieval times, Candlemas eve (Feb. 1st) marked the day when all Christmas decorations, including the Christmas tree and the Nativity scene, were taken down. However, the tradition of ending Christmastide on Candlemas has slowly waned, except in some pockets of the Hispanic world where Candlemas (or La Fiesta de la Candelaria) is still an important feast and the unofficial end of the Christmas season.\n\"Liturgical colour\": white\nOrdinary Time.\n\"Ordinary\" comes from the same root as our word \"ordinal\", and in this sense means \"the counted weeks\". In the Catholic Church and in some Protestant traditions, these are the common weeks which do not belong to a proper season. In Latin, these seasons are called the weeks , or \"through the year\".\nIn the current form of the Roman Rite adopted following the Second Vatican Council, Ordinary Time consists of 33 or 34 Sundays and is divided into two sections. The first portion extends from the day following the Feast of the Baptism of Christ until the day before Ash Wednesday (the beginning of Lent). It contains anywhere from three to eight Sundays, depending on how early or late Easter falls.\nThe main focus in the readings of the Mass is Christ's earthly ministry, rather than any one particular event. The counting of the Sundays resumes following Eastertide; however, two Sundays are replaced by Pentecost and Trinity Sunday, and depending on whether the year has 52 or 53 weeks, one may be omitted.\nIn the pre-1970 form of the Roman Rite, the Time after Epiphany has anywhere from one to six Sundays. As in the current form of the rite, the season mainly concerns Christ's preaching and ministry, with many of his parables read as the Gospel readings. The season begins on January 14 and ends on the Saturday before Septuagesima Sunday. Omitted Sundays after Epiphany are transferred to Time after Pentecost and celebrated between the Twenty-Third and the Last Sunday after Pentecost according to an order indicated in the Code of Rubrics, 18, with complete omission of any for which there is no Sunday available in the current year. Before the 1960 revisions, the omitted Sunday would be celebrated on the Saturday before Septuagesima Sunday, or, in the case of the Twenty-Third Sunday after Pentecost, on the Saturday before the Last Sunday after Pentecost.\n\"Liturgical colour\": green\nPre-Lent.\nGregory the Great is the first to document a period of preparation for Easter beginning with Septuagesima, whose name refers to a period of around seventy days before Easter. This pre-Lenten period lasts two and a half weeks, encompassing Sexagesima and Quinquagesima. It concludes with Carnival and Shrove Tuesday.\nThis period opens an educational period leading up to the reception of catechumens at Easter. Events such as mystery plays from the Old Testament performed during this period historically supported this instructional campaign, reflecting the traditional lectionary for the Canonical hours, which begins on Septuagesima with the Book of Genesis, as is still reflected in the \"Book of Common Prayer\".\nThe pre-Lenten liturgy introduces some customs of Lent, including the suppression of the Alleluia and its replacement at Mass with the Tract. The Gloria is no longer said on Sundays.\nThe 1969 reform of the Roman Rite subsumed these weeks liturgically into Ordinary Time, but Carnival is still widely celebrated. A pre-Lenten provision continues in many Anglican and Lutheran liturgies.\n\"Liturgical colour\" (where observed): violet or purple\nLent and Passiontide.\nLent is a major penitential season of preparation for Easter. It begins on Ash Wednesday and, if the penitential days of Good Friday and Holy Saturday are included, lasts for forty days, since the six Sundays within the season are not counted.\nIn the Roman Rite, the Gloria in Excelsis Deo and the Te Deum are not used in the Mass and Liturgy of the Hours respectively, except on Solemnities and Feasts, and the Alleluia and verse that usually precede the reading of the Gospel is either omitted or replaced with another acclamation.\nLutheran churches make these same omissions.\nAs in Advent, the deacon and subdeacon of the pre-1970 form of the Roman Rite do not wear their habitual dalmatic and tunicle (signs of joy) in Masses of the season during Lent; instead they wear \"folded chasubles\", in accordance with the ancient custom.\nIn the pre-1970 form of the Roman Rite, the two weeks before Easter form the season of Passiontide, a subsection of the Lenten season that begins with Matins of Ash Wednesday and ends immediately before the Mass of the Easter Vigil. In this form, what used to be officially called Passion Sunday, has the official name of the First Sunday in Passiontide, and Palm Sunday has the additional name of the Second Sunday in Passiontide. In Sunday and ferial Masses (but not on feasts celebrated in the first of these two weeks) the Gloria Patri is omitted at the Entrance Antiphon and at the Lavabo, as well as in the responds in the Divine Office.\nIn the post-1969 form of the Roman Rite, \"Passion Sunday\" and \"Palm Sunday\" are both names for the Sunday before Easter, officially called \"Palm Sunday of the Lord's Passion\". The former Passion Sunday became a fifth Sunday of Lent. The earlier form reads Matthew's account on Sunday, Mark's on Tuesday, and Luke's on Wednesday, while the post-1969 form reads the Passion only on Palm Sunday (with the three Synoptic Gospels arranged in a three-year cycle) and on Good Friday, when it reads the Passion according to John, as also do earlier forms of the Roman Rite.\nThe veiling of crucifixes and images of the saints with violet cloth, which was obligatory before 1970, is left to the decision of the national bishops' conferences. In the United States, it is permitted but not required, at the discretion of the pastor. In all forms, the readings concern the events leading up to the Last Supper and the betrayal, Passion, and death of Christ.\nThe week before Easter is called Holy Week.\nIn the Roman Rite, feasts that fall within that week are simply omitted, unless they have the rank of Solemnity, in which case they are transferred to another date. The only solemnities inscribed in the General Calendar that can fall within that week are those of Saint Joseph and the Annunciation.\n\"Liturgical colour\": violet or purple. The colour rose may be used, where it is the practice, on Laetare Sunday (4th Sunday of Lent). On Palm Sunday the colour since 1970 is red, by earlier rules violet or purple, with red being used after 1955 for the blessing of the palms.\nEaster Triduum.\nThe Easter Triduum consists of Good Friday, Holy Saturday and Easter Sunday. Each of these days begins liturgically not with the morning but with the preceding evening.\nThe triduum begins on the evening before Good Friday with Mass of the Lord's Supper, celebrated with white vestments, and often includes a ritual of ceremonial footwashing. It is customary on this night for a vigil involving private prayer to take place, beginning after the evening service and continuing until midnight. This vigil is occasionally renewed at dawn, continuing until the Good Friday liturgy.\nDuring the day of Good Friday Mass is not celebrated in the Catholic Church. Instead a Celebration of the Passion of the Lord is held in the afternoon or evening. It consists of three parts: a Liturgy of the Word that includes the reading of the account of the Passion by John the Evangelist and concludes with a solemn Universal Prayer. Other churches also have their Good Friday commemoration of the Passion.\nThe colour of vestments varies: no colour, red, or black are used in different traditions. Coloured hangings may be removed. Lutheran churches often either remove colourful adornments and icons, or veil them with drab cloth. The service is usually plain with somber music, ending with the congregation leaving in silence. In the Catholic, some Lutheran, and High Anglican rites, a crucifix (not necessarily the one which stands on or near the altar on other days of the year) is ceremoniously unveiled. Other crucifixes are unveiled, without ceremony, after the service.\nHoly Saturday commemorates the day during which Christ lay in the tomb. In the Catholic Church, there is no Mass on this day; the Easter Vigil Mass, which, though celebrated properly at the following midnight, is often celebrated in the evening, is an Easter Mass. With no liturgical celebration, there is no question of a liturgical colour.\nThe Easter Vigil is held in the night between Holy Saturday and Easter Sunday, to celebrate the resurrection of Jesus. See also Paschal candle. The liturgical colour is white, often together with gold. In the Roman Rite, during the \"Gloria in Excelsis Deo\" the organ and bells are used in the liturgy for the first time in two days, and the statues, which have been veiled during Passiontide (at least in the Roman Rite through the 1962 version), are unveiled. In Lutheran churches, colours and icons are re-displayed as well.\nEastertide.\nEaster is the celebration of Jesus' Resurrection. The date of Easter varies from year to year, according to a lunar-calendar dating system (see computus for details). In the Roman Rite, the Easter season extends from the Easter Vigil through Pentecost Sunday. In the pre-1970 form of the rite, this season includes also the Octave of Pentecost, so Eastertide lasts until None of the following Saturday.\nIn the Roman Rite, the Easter octave allows no other feasts to be celebrated or commemorated during it; a solemnity, such as the Annunciation, falling within it is transferred to the following Monday. If Easter Sunday or Easter Monday falls on April 25, the Greater Litanies, which in the pre-1970 form of the Roman Rite are on that day, are transferred to the following Tuesday.\nBy a decree of May 5, 2000, the Second Sunday of Easter (the Sunday after Easter Day itself), is known also in the Roman Rite as the Feast of the Divine Mercy.\nAscension Thursday, which celebrates the return of Jesus to heaven following his resurrection, is the fortieth day of Easter, but, in places where it is not observed as a Holy Day of Obligation, the post-1969 form of the Roman rite transfers it to the following Sunday.\nPentecost is the fiftieth and last day of the Easter season. It celebrates the sending of the Holy Spirit to the Apostles, which traditionally marks the birth of the Church, see also Apostolic Age.\n\"Liturgical colour\": white, but red on the feast of Pentecost.\nOrdinary Time, Time after Pentecost, Time after Trinity, or Kingdomtide.\nThis season, under various names, follows the Easter season and the feasts of Easter, Ascension, and Pentecost. In the post-1969 form of the Roman rite, Ordinary Time resumes on Pentecost Monday, omitting the Sunday which would have fallen on Pentecost. In the earlier form, where Pentecost is celebrated with an octave, the Time after Pentecost begins at Vespers on the Saturday after Pentecost. The Sundays resume their numbering at the point that will make the Sunday before Advent the thirty-fourth, omitting any weeks for which there is no room (present-day form of the Roman Rite) or are numbered as \"Sundays after Pentecost\" (pre-1970 Roman Rite, Eastern Orthodoxy and some Protestants) or as \"Sundays after Trinity\" (some Protestants). This season ends on the Saturday before the First Sunday of Advent.\nFeasts during this season include:\nIn the final few weeks of Ordinary Time, many churches direct attention to the coming of the Kingdom of God, thus ending the liturgical year with an eschatological theme that is one of the predominant themes of the season of Advent that began the liturgical year. For instance, in the extraordinary form of the Roman Rite, the Gospel of the Last Sunday is and in the ordinary form of the Roman Rite all the last three Sundays of the liturgical year are affected by the theme of the Second Coming.\nWhile the Roman Rite adopts no special designation for this final part of Ordinary Time, some denominations do, and may also change the liturgical colour. The Church of England uses the term \"Sundays before Advent\" for the final four Sundays and permits red vestments as an alternative. The United Methodist Church may use the name \"Kingdomtide\". The Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod (LCMS) uses the terms \"Third-Last, Second-Last and Last Sunday in the Church Year\" and does not change from green. The LCMS does not officially celebrate a \"Feast of Christ the King\". The Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS) uses the term \"Period of End Times\" and assigns red vestments to the first and second Sundays.\nCalendar of saints.\n\"Liturgical colours\": white if the saint was not martyred; red if the saint was martyred\nHierarchy of feast days.\nThere are degrees of solemnity of the office of the feast days of saints. In the 13th century, the Roman Rite distinguished three ranks: simple, semidouble and double, with consequent differences in the recitation of the Divine Office or Breviary. The simple feast commenced with the chapter (\"capitulum\") of First Vespers, and ended with None. It had three lessons and took the psalms of Matins from the ferial office; the rest of the office was like the semidouble. The semidouble feast had two Vespers, nine lessons in Matins, and ended with Compline. The antiphons before the psalms were only intoned.\nIn the Mass, the semidouble had always at least three \"orationes\" or collects. On a double feast the antiphons were sung in their entirety, before and after the psalms, while in Lauds and Vespers there were no \"suffragia\" of the saints, and the Mass had only one \"oratio\" (if no commemoration was prescribed). If ordinary double feasts (referred to also as lesser doubles) occurred with feasts of a higher rank, they could be simplified, except the octave days of some feasts and the feasts of the Doctors of the Church, which were transferred.\nTo the existing distinction between major and ordinary or minor doubles, Pope Clement VIII added two more ranks, those of first-class or second-class doubles. Some of these two classes were kept with octaves. This was still the situation when the 1907 article http:// in the Catholic Encyclopedia was written. In accordance with the rules then in force, feast days of any form of double, if impeded by \"occurrence\" (falling on the same day) with a feast day of higher class, were transferred to another day.\nPope Pius X simplified matters considerably in his 1911 reform of the Roman Breviary. In the case of occurrence the lower-ranking feast day could become a commemoration within the celebration of the higher-ranking one. Until then, ordinary doubles took precedence over most of the semidouble Sundays, resulting in many of the Sunday Masses rarely being said. While retaining the semidouble rite for Sundays, Pius X's reform permitted only the most important feast days to be celebrated on Sunday, although commemorations were still made until Pope John XXIII's reform of 1960.\nThe division into doubles (of various kinds) semidoubles and simples continued until 1955, when Pope Pius XII abolished the rank of semidouble, making all the previous semidoubles simples, and reducing the previous simples to a mere commemoration in the Mass of another feast day or of the feria on which they fell (see General Roman Calendar of Pope Pius XII).\nThen, in 1960, Pope John XXIII issued the Code of Rubrics, completely ending the ranking of feast days by doubles etc., and replacing it by a ranking, applied not only to feast days but to all liturgical days, as I, II, III, and IV class days.\nThe 1969 revision by Pope Paul VI divided feast days into \"solemnities\", \"feasts\" and \"memorials\", corresponding approximately to Pope John XXIII's I, II and III class feast days. Commemorations were abolished. While some of the memorials are considered obligatory, others are optional, permitting a choice on some days between two or three memorials, or between one or more memorials and the celebration of the feria. On a day to which no obligatory celebration is assigned, the Mass may be of any saint mentioned in the Roman Martyrology for that day.\nAssumption of Mary.\nObserved by Catholics and some Anglicans on August 15, which is the same as the Eastern and Orthodox feast of the Dormition, the end of the earthly life of the Virgin Mary and, for some, her bodily Assumption into heaven, is celebrated. The teaching on this dogma was summmed by Pope Pius XII in his bull \"Munificentissimus Deus\" of 1 November, 1950.\nIn other Anglican and Lutheran traditions, as well as a few others, August 15 is celebrated as St. Mary, Mother of the Lord.\n\"Liturgical colour\": white\nSecular observance.\nBecause of the dominance of Christianity in Europe throughout the Middle Ages, many features of the Christian year became incorporated into the secular calendar. Many of its feasts (e.g., Christmas, Mardi Gras, Saint Patrick's Day) remain holidays, and are now celebrated by people of all faiths and none\u2014in some cases worldwide. The secular celebrations bear varying degrees of likeness to the religious feasts from which they derived, often also including elements of ritual from pagan festivals of similar date.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It derives from the African wild ass, \"Equus africanus\", and may be classified either as a subspecies thereof, Equus africanus asinus, or as a separate species, Equus asinus.1 It was domesticated in Africa some years ago,23715 and has been used mainly as a working animal since that time. \nThere are more than 40 million donkeys in the world, mostly in underdeveloped countries, where they are used principally as draught or pack animals. While working donkeys are often associated with those living at or below subsistence, small numbers of donkeys or asses are kept for breeding, as pets, and for livestock protection in developed countries.\nAn adult male donkey is a \"jack\" or \"jackass\", an adult female is a \"jenny\" or \"jennet\", and an immature donkey of either sex is a \"foal\". Jacks are often mated with female horses (mares) to produce \"mules\"; the less common hybrid of a male horse (stallion) and jenny is a \"hinny\".\nNomenclature.\nTraditionally, the scientific name for the donkey is \"Equus asinus asinus\", on the basis of the principle of priority used for scientific names of animals. However, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature ruled in 2003 that if the domestic and the wild species are considered subspecies of a common species, the scientific name of the wild species has priority, even when that subspecies was described after the domestic subspecies. This means that the proper scientific name for the donkey is \"Equus africanus asinus\" when it is considered a subspecies and \"Equus asinus\" when it is considered a species.\nAt one time, the synonym \"ass\" was the more common term for the donkey. The first recorded use of \"donkey\" was in either 1784 or 1785.239 While the word \"ass\" has cognates in most other Indo-European languages, \"donkey\" is an etymologically obscure word for which no credible cognate has been identified. Hypotheses on its derivation include the following:\nFrom the 18th century, \"donkey\" gradually replaced \"ass\" and \"jenny\" replaced \"she-ass\", which is now considered archaic. The change may have come about through a tendency to avoid pejorative terms in speech and may be comparable to the substitution in North American English of \"rooster\" for \"cock\", or that of \"rabbit\" for \"coney\", which was formerly homophonic with \"cunny\" (a variation of the word cunt). By the end of the 17th century, changes in pronunciation of both \"ass\" and \"arse\" had caused them to become homophones in some varieties of English.239 Other words used for the ass in English from this time include \"cuddy\" in Scotland, \"neddy\" in southwestern England and \"dicky\" in southeastern England;239 \"moke\" is documented in the 19th century and may be of Welsh or Romani origin.\n\"Burro\" is a word for donkey in both Spanish and Portuguese. In the United States, it is commonly applied to the feral donkeys that live west of the Rocky Mountains; it may also refer to any small donkey.147\nHistory.\nThe genus \"Equus\", which includes all extant equines, is believed to have evolved from \"Dinohippus\", via the intermediate form \"Plesippus\". One of the oldest species is \"Equus simplicidens\", described as zebra-like with a donkey-shaped head. The oldest fossil to date is approximately 3.5 million years old, and was located in the US state of Idaho. The genus appears to have spread quickly into the Old World, with the similarly aged \"Equus livenzovensis\" documented from western Europe and Russia.\nMolecular phylogenies indicate the most recent common ancestor of all modern equids (members of the genus \"Equus\") lived ~5.6 (3.9\u20137.8) mya. Direct paleogenomic sequencing of a 700,000-year-old middle Pleistocene horse metapodial bone from Canada implies a more recent 4.07 Myr before present date for the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) within the range of 4.0 to 4.5 Myr BP. The oldest divergencies are the Asian hemiones (subgenus \"E. (Asinus)\", including the kulan, onager, and kiang), followed by the African zebras (subgenera \"E. (Dolichohippus)\", and \"E. (Hippotigris)\"). All other modern forms including the domesticated horse (and many fossil Pliocene and Pleistocene forms) belong to the subgenus \"E. (Equus)\" which diverged ~4.8 (3.2\u20136.5) million years ago.\nThe ancestors of the modern donkey are the Nubian and Somalian subspecies of African wild ass. Remains of domestic donkeys dating to the fourth millennium BC have been found in Ma'adi in Lower Egypt, and it is believed that the domestication of the donkey was accomplished long after the domestication of cattle, sheep and goats in the seventh and eighth millennia BC. Donkeys were probably first domesticated by pastoral people in Nubia, and they supplanted the ox as the chief pack animal of that culture. Genetic evidence indicates that the Cushitic-speaking peoples in the Horn of Africa and along the Red Sea Hills separately domesticated the animal. The domestication of donkeys served to increase the mobility of pastoral cultures, having the advantage over ruminants of not needing time to chew their cud, and were vital in the development of long-distance trade across Egypt. In the Dynasty IV era of Egypt, between 2675 and 2565 BC, wealthy members of society were known to own over 1,000 donkeys, employed in agriculture, as dairy and meat animals and as pack animals. In 2003, the tomb of either King Narmer or King Hor-Aha (two of the first Egyptian pharaohs) was excavated and the skeletons of ten donkeys were found buried in a manner usually used with high ranking humans. These burials show the importance of donkeys to the early Egyptian state and its ruler.\nBy the end of the fourth millennium BC, the donkey had spread to Southwest Asia, and the main breeding centre had shifted to Mesopotamia by 1800 BC. The breeding of large, white riding asses made Damascus famous, while Syrian breeders developed at least three other breeds, including one preferred by women for its easy gait. The Muscat or Yemen ass was developed in Arabia. By the second millennium BC, the donkey was brought to Europe, possibly at the same time as viticulture was introduced, as the donkey is associated with the Syrian god of wine, Dionysus. Greeks spread both of these to many of their colonies, including those in what are now Italy, France and Spain; Romans dispersed them throughout their empire.\nThe first donkeys came to the Americas on ships of the Second Voyage of Christopher Columbus, and were landed at Hispaniola in 1495. The first to reach North America may have been two animals taken to Mexico by Juan de Zum\u00e1rraga, the first bishop of Mexico, who arrived there on 6 December 1528, while the first donkeys to reach what is now the United States may have crossed the Rio Grande with Juan de O\u00f1ate in April 1598. From that time on they spread northward, finding use in missions and mines. Donkeys were documented as present in what today is Arizona in 1679. By the Gold Rush years of the 19th century, the burro was the beast of burden of choice of early prospectors in the western United States. By the end of the placer mining boom, many of them escaped or were abandoned, and a feral population established itself.\nConservation status.\nAbout 41 million donkeys were reported worldwide in 2006. China had the most with 11 million, followed by Pakistan, Ethiopia and Mexico. As of 2017, however, the Chinese population was reported to have dropped to 3 million, with African populations under pressure as well, due to increasing trade and demand for donkey products in China. Some researchers believe the actual number may be somewhat higher since many donkeys go uncounted. The number of breeds and percentage of world population for each of the FAO's world regions was in 2006:\nIn 1997, the number of donkeys in the world was reported to be continuing to grow, as it had steadily done throughout most of history; factors cited as contributing to this were increasing human population, progress in economic development and social stability in some poorer nations, conversion of forests to farm and range land, rising prices of motor vehicles and fuel, and the popularity of donkeys as pets.\nSince then, the world population of donkeys is reported to be rapidly shrinking, falling from 43.7 million to 43.5 million between 1995 and 2000, and to only 41 million in 2006. The fall in population is pronounced in developed countries; in Europe, the total number of donkeys fell from 3 million in 1944 to just over 1 million in 1994.\nThe Domestic Animal Diversity Information System (DAD-IS) of the FAO listed 189 breeds of ass in June 2011. In 2000 the number of breeds of donkey recorded worldwide was 97, and in 1995 it was 77. The rapid increase is attributed to attention paid to identification and recognition of donkey breeds by the FAO's Animal Genetic Resources project. The rate of recognition of new breeds has been particularly high in some developed countries. In France only one breed, the Baudet du Poitou, was recognised until the early 1990s; by 2005, a further six donkey breeds had official recognition.\nIn developed countries, the welfare of donkeys both at home and abroad has become a concern, and a number of sanctuaries for retired and rescued donkeys have been set up. The largest is The Donkey Sanctuary near Sidmouth, England, which also supports donkey welfare projects in Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Kenya, and Mexico.\nIn 2017, a drop in the number of Chinese donkeys, combined with the fact that they are slow to reproduce, meant that Chinese suppliers began to look to Africa. As a result of the increase in demand, and the price that could be charged, Kenya opened three donkey abattoirs. Concerns for donkeys' well-being have resulted in a number of African countries (including Uganda, Tanzania, Botswana, Niger, Burkina Faso, Mali, and Senegal) banning China from buying their donkey products.\nIn 2019, The Donkey Sanctuary warned that the global donkey population could be reduced by half over the next half decade as the demand for ejiao increases in China.\nCharacteristics.\nDonkeys vary considerably in size, depending on both breed and environmental conditions, and heights at the withers range from less than to approximately .6 Working donkeys in the poorest countries have a life expectancy of 12 to 15 years; in more prosperous countries, they may have a lifespan of 30 to 50 years.\nDonkeys are adapted to marginal desert lands. Unlike wild and feral horses, wild donkeys in dry areas are solitary and do not form harems. Each adult donkey establishes a home range; breeding over a large area may be dominated by one jack. The loud call or bray of the donkey, which typically lasts for twenty seconds and can be heard for over three kilometres, may help keep in contact with other donkeys over the wide spaces of the desert. Donkeys have large ears, which may pick up more distant sounds, and may help cool the donkey's blood. Donkeys can defend themselves by biting, striking with the front hooves or kicking with the hind legs. Their vocalization, called a bray, is often represented in English as \"hee haw\".\nCross on back.\nMost donkeys have dorsal and shoulder stripes, primitive markings which form a distinctive cross pattern on their backs.\nBreeding.\nA jenny is normally pregnant for about 12 months, though the gestation period varies from 11 to 14 months, and usually gives birth to a single foal. Births of twins are rare, though less so than in horses. About 1.7 percent of donkey pregnancies result in twins; both foals survive in about 14 percent of those. In general jennies have a conception rate that is lower than that of horses (i.e., less than the 60\u201365% rate for mares).\nAlthough jennies come into heat within 9 or 10 days of giving birth, their fertility remains low, and it is likely the reproductive tract has not returned to normal. Thus it is usual to wait one or two further oestrous cycles before rebreeding, unlike the practice with mares. Jennies are usually very protective of their foals, and some will not come into estrus while they have a foal at side. The time lapse involved in rebreeding, and the length of a jenny's gestation, means that a jenny will have fewer than one foal per year. Because of this and the longer gestation period, donkey breeders do not expect to obtain a foal every year, as horse breeders often do, but may plan for three foals in four years.\nDonkeys can interbreed with other members of the family Equidae, and are commonly interbred with horses. The hybrid between a jack and a mare is a mule, valued as a working and riding animal in many countries. Some large donkey breeds such as the Asino di Martina Franca, the Baudet du Poitou and the Mammoth Jack are raised only for mule production. The hybrid between a stallion and a jenny is a hinny, and is less common. Like other inter-species hybrids, mules and hinnies are usually sterile. Donkeys can also breed with zebras, in which case the offspring is called a zonkey (among other names).\nBehaviour.\nDonkeys have a notorious reputation for stubbornness, but this has been attributed to a much stronger sense of self-preservation than exhibited by horses. Likely based on a stronger prey instinct and a weaker connection with humans, it is considerably more difficult to force or frighten a donkey into doing something it perceives to be dangerous for whatever reason. Once a person has earned their confidence they can be willing and companionable partners and very dependable in work.\nAlthough formal studies of their behaviour and cognition are rather limited, donkeys appear to be quite intelligent, cautious, friendly, playful, and eager to learn.\nUses.\nThe donkey has been used as a working animal for at least years. Of the more than 40 million donkeys in the world, about 96% are in underdeveloped countries, where they are used principally as pack animals or for draught work in transport or agriculture. After human labour, the donkey is the cheapest form of agricultural power. They may also be ridden, or used for threshing, raising water, milling and other work. Some cultures that prohibit women from working with oxen in agriculture do not extend this taboo to donkeys.\nIn developed countries where their use as beasts of burden has disappeared, donkeys are used to sire mules, to guard sheep, for donkey rides for children or tourists, and as pets. Donkeys may be pastured or stabled with horses and ponies, and are thought to have a calming effect on nervous horses. If a donkey is introduced to a mare and foal, the foal may turn to the donkey for support after it has been weaned from its mother.\nIn the United States, Canada, and Australia, donkeys are used as livestock guard animals for smaller livestock such as sheep. When working as livestock guard animals, also called predator control animals or mobile flock protectors, donkeys will bray loudly and attack potential predators by kicking out with their front hooves. In 2019, donkeys comprised 14.2% of livestock guard animals in the United States.\nA few donkeys are milked or raised for meat. Approximately 3.5 million donkeys and mules are slaughtered each year for meat worldwide. In Italy, which has the highest consumption of equine meat in Europe and where donkey meat is the main ingredient of several regional dishes, about 1,000 donkeys were slaughtered in 2010, yielding approximately of meat. Asses' milk may command good prices: the average price in Italy in 2009 was \u20ac15 per litre, and a price of \u20ac6 per 100 ml was reported from Croatia in 2008; it is used for soaps and cosmetics as well as dietary purposes. The niche markets for both milk and meat are expanding. In the past, donkey skin was used in the production of parchment. In 2017, the UK based charity The Donkey Sanctuary estimated that 1.8 million skins were traded every year, but the demand could be as high as 10 million. \nIn China, donkey meat is considered a delicacy with some restaurants specializing in such dishes, and Guo Li Zhuang restaurants offer the genitals of donkeys in dishes. Donkey-hide gelatin is produced by soaking and stewing the hide to make a traditional Chinese medicine product. Ejiao, the gelatine produced by boiling donkey skins, can sell for up to $388 per kilogram, at October 2017 prices. \nIn warfare.\nDuring World War I John Simpson Kirkpatrick, a British stretcher bearer serving with the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, and Richard Alexander \"Dick\" Henderson of the New Zealand Medical Corps used donkeys to rescue wounded soldiers from the battlefield at Gallipoli.\nAccording to British food writer Matthew Fort, donkeys were used in the Italian Army. The Mountain Fusiliers each had a donkey to carry their gear, and in extreme circumstances the animal could be eaten.\nDonkeys have also been used to carry explosives in conflicts that include the war in Afghanistan and others. In 2025 Donkeys were issued to Russian forces participating in the invasion of Ukraine to ferry supplies, with Russian officials stating logistical issues as the reason.\nCare.\nShoeing.\nDonkey hooves are more elastic than those of horses, and do not naturally wear down as fast. Regular clipping may be required; neglect can lead to permanent damage. Working donkeys may need to be shod. Donkey shoes are similar to horseshoes, but usually smaller and without toe-clips.\nNutrition.\nIn their native arid and semi-arid climates, donkeys spend more than half of each day foraging and feeding, often on poor quality scrub. The donkey has a tough digestive system in which roughage is efficiently broken down by hind gut fermentation, microbial action in the caecum and large intestine. While there is no marked structural difference between the gastro-intestinal tract of a donkey and that of a horse, the digestion of the donkey is more efficient. It needs less food than a horse or pony of comparable height and weight, approximately 1.5 percent of body weight per day in dry matter, compared to the 2\u20132.5 percent consumption rate possible for a horse. Donkeys are also less prone to colic. The reasons for this difference are not fully understood; the donkey may have different intestinal flora to the horse, or a longer gut retention time. \nDonkeys obtain most of their energy from structural carbohydrates. Some suggest that a donkey needs to be fed only straw (preferably barley straw), supplemented with controlled grazing in the summer or hay in the winter, to get all the energy, protein, fat and vitamins it requires; others recommend some grain to be fed, particularly to working animals, and others advise against feeding straw. They do best when allowed to consume small amounts of food over long periods. They can meet their nutritional needs on 6 to 7 hours of grazing per day on average dryland pasture that is not stressed by drought. If they are worked long hours or do not have access to pasture, they require hay or a similar dried forage, with no more than a 1:4 ratio of legumes to grass. They also require salt and mineral supplements, and access to clean, fresh water. In temperate climates the forage available is often too abundant and too rich; over-feeding may cause weight gain and obesity, and lead to metabolic disorders such as founder (laminitis) and hyperlipaemia, or to gastric ulcers.\nThroughout the world, working donkeys are associated with the very poor, with those living at or below subsistence level. Few receive adequate food, and in general donkeys throughout the Third World are under-nourished and over-worked.\nFeral populations.\nIn some areas domestic donkeys have returned to the wild and established feral populations such as those of the burro of North America and the Asinara donkey of Sardinia, Italy, both of which have protected status. Feral donkeys can also cause problems, notably in environments that have evolved free of any form of equid, such as Hawaii. There is a small community of feral donkeys on St. John, U.S. Virgin Islands, that descend from the animals brought by Danish colonists for agricultural work. While they add to the island's charm, they also cause issues such as vegetation damage and road hazards, leading to population management efforts. In Australia, where there may be 5 million feral donkeys, they are regarded as an invasive pest and have a serious impact on the environment. They may compete with livestock and native animals for resources, spread weeds and diseases, foul or damage watering holes and cause erosion.\nDonkey hybrids.\nThe earliest documented donkey hybrid was the kunga, which was used as a draft animal in the Syrian and Mesopotamian kingdoms of the second half of the 3rd millennium BCE. A cross between a captive male Syrian wild ass and a female domesticated donkey (jenny), they represent the earliest known example of human-directed animal hybridization. They were produced at a breeding center at Nagar (modern Tell Brak) and were sold or given as gifts throughout the region, where they became significant status symbols, pulling battle wagons and the chariots of kings, and also being sacrificed to bury with high-status people. They fell out of favor following the introduction of the domestic horse and its donkey hybrid, the mule, into the region at the end of the 3rd millennium BCE.\nA male donkey (jack) crossed with a female horse produces a mule, while a male horse crossed with a jenny produces a hinny. Horse\u2013donkey hybrids are almost always sterile because of a failure of their developing gametes to complete meiosis. The lower progesterone production of the jenny may also lead to early embryonic loss. In addition, there are reasons not directly related to reproductive biology. Due to different mating behavior, jacks are often more willing to cover mares than stallions are to breed jennies. Further, mares are usually larger than jennies and thus have more room for the ensuing foal to grow in the womb, resulting in a larger animal at birth. It is commonly believed that mules are more easily handled and also physically stronger than hinnies, making them more desirable for breeders to produce.\nThe offspring of a zebra\u2013donkey cross is called a zonkey, zebroid, zebrass, or zedonk; \"zebra mule\" is an older term, but still used in some regions today. The foregoing terms generally refer to hybrids produced by breeding a male zebra to a female donkey. \"Zebra hinny, zebret\" and \"zebrinny\" all refer to the cross of a female zebra with a male donkey. Zebrinnies are rarer than zedonkies because female zebras in captivity are most valuable when used to produce full-blooded zebras. There are not enough female zebras breeding in captivity to spare them for hybridizing; there is no such limitation on the number of female donkeys breeding.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "55528", "revid": "1315667320", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55528", "title": "Clam", "text": "Common name for several kinds of bivalve mollusc\nClam is a common name for several species of bivalve mollusc. The word is often applied only to those that are deemed edible and live as infauna, spending most of their lives halfway buried in the sand of the sea floor or riverbeds. Clams have two shells of equal size connected by two adductor muscles and have a powerful burrowing foot. They live in both freshwater and marine environments; in salt water they prefer to burrow down into the mud and the turbidity of the water required varies with species and location; the greatest diversity of these is in North America.\nClams in the culinary sense do not live attached to a substrate (whereas oysters and mussels do) and do not live near the bottom (whereas scallops do). In culinary usage, clams are commonly eaten marine bivalves, as in clam digging and the resulting soup, clam chowder. Many edible clams such as palourde clams are ovoid or triangular; however, razor clams have an elongated parallel-sided shell, suggesting an old-fashioned straight razor.\nSome clams have life cycles of only one year, whilst at least one reached an age of more than 500 years. All clams have two calcareous shells or valves joined near a hinge with a flexible ligament and all are filter feeders.\nAnatomy.\nA clam's shell consists of two (usually equal) valves, which are connected by a hinge joint and a ligament that can be internal or external. The ligament provides tension to bring the valves apart, whilst one or two adductor muscles can contract to close the valves. Clams also have kidneys, a heart, a mouth, a stomach, and a nervous system. Many have a siphon.\nFood source and ecology.\nClams are shellfish that make up an important part of the web of life that keeps the seas functioning, both as filter feeders and as a food source for many different animals. Extant mammals that eat clams include both the Pacific and Atlantic species of walrus, all known subspecies of harbour seals in both the Atlantic and Pacific, most species of sea lions, including the California sea lion, bearded seals and even species of river otters that will consume the freshwater species found in Asia and North America. Birds of all kinds will also eat clams if they can catch them in the littoral zone: roseate spoonbills of North and South America, the Eurasian oystercatcher, whooping crane and common crane, the American flamingo of Florida and the Caribbean Sea, and the common sandpiper are just a handful of the numerous birds that feast on clams all over the world. Most species of octopus have clams as a staple of their diet, up to and including the giants like the Giant Pacific octopus.\nCulinary.\nCultures around the world eat clams along with many other types of shellfish.\nNorth America.\nIn culinary use, within the eastern coast of the United States and large swathes of the Maritimes of Canada, the term \"clam\" most often refers to the hard clam, \"Mercenaria mercenaria\". It may also refer to a few other common edible species, such as the soft-shell clam, \"Mya arenaria\", and the ocean quahog, \"Arctica islandica\". Another species commercially exploited on the Atlantic Coast of the United States is the surf clam, \"Spisula solidissima\". Scallops are also used for food nationwide, but not cockles: they are more difficult to get than in Europe because of their habit of being further out in the tide than European species on the West Coast, and on the East Coast they are often found in salt marshes and mudflats where mosquitoes are abundant. There are several edible species in the Eastern United States: \"Americardia media,\" also known as the strawberry cockle, is found from Cape Hatteras down into the Caribbean Sea and all of Florida; \"Trachycardium muricatum\" has a similar range to the strawberry cockle; and \"Dinocardium robustum\", which grows to be many times the size of the European cockle. Historically, they were caught on a small scale on the Outer Banks, barrier islands off North Carolina, and put in soups, steamed or pickled.\nUp and down the coast of the Eastern U.S., the bamboo clam, \"Ensis directus\", is prized by Americans for making clam strips, although because of its nature of burrowing into the sand very close to the beach, it cannot be harvested by mechanical means without damaging the beaches. The bamboo clam is also notorious for having a very sharp edge of its shell, and when harvested by hand must be handled with great care.\nOn the U.S. West Coast, there are several species that have been consumed for thousands of years, evidenced by middens full of clamshells near the shore and their consumption by nations including the Chumash of California, the Nisqually of Washington state and the Tsawwassen of British Columbia. The butter clam, \"Saxidomus gigantea\", the Pacific razor clam, \"Siliqua patula,\" gaper clams \"Tresus capax\", the geoduck clam, \"Panopea generosa\" and the Pismo clam, \"Tivela stultorum\" are all eaten as delicacies.\nClams can be eaten raw, steamed, boiled, baked or fried. They can also be made into clam chowder, clams casino, clam cakes, or stuffies, or they can be cooked using hot rocks and seaweed in a New England clam bake. On the West Coast, they are an ingredient in making cioppino and local variants of ceviche.\nAsia.\nIndia.\nClams are eaten more in the coastal regions of India, especially in the Konkan, Kerala, Bengal and coastal regions of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu regions.\nIn Kerala, clams are used to make curries and fried with coconut. In the Malabar region it is known as \"elambakka\" and in middle kerala it is known as \"kakka\". Clam curry made with coconut is a dish from Malabar especially in the Thalassery region. On the southwestern coast of India, also known as the Konkan region of Maharashtra, clams are used in curries and side dishes, like Tisaryachi Ekshipi, which is clams with one shell on. Beary Muslim households in the Mangalore region prepare a main dish with clams called Kowldo Pinde. In Udupi and Mangalore regions, it is called in the local Tulu language. It is used to prepare many dishes like , , and .\nJapan.\nIn Japan, clams are often an ingredient of mixed seafood dishes. They can also be made into hot pot, miso soup or tsukudani. The more commonly used varieties of clams in Japanese cooking are the Shijimi (\"Corbicula japonica\"), the Asari (\"Venerupis philippinarum\") and the Hamaguri (\"Meretrix lusoria\").\nEurope.\nGreat Britain.\nThe rocky terrain and pebbly shores of the seacoast that surrounds Great Britain provide ample habitat for shellfish including clams. Historically, British cuisine has been more heavily based on beef and dairy products than seafood, although there is evidence going back to before most recorded history of coastal shell middens near Weymouth and present day York. 70% of the seafood cultivated for aquaculture or commercial harvesting is exported to the continent, though present-day younger populations are eating more of the catch than a generation ago.\nStaple favourites of the British public and local scavengers include the razorfish, \"Ensis siliqua\", a slightly smaller cousin of the bamboo clam of eastern North America. These can be found for sale in open-air markets like Billingsgate Market in London; they have a similar taste to their North American cousin. Cockles, specifically the common cockle, are a staple find on beaches in western Wales and further north in the Dee Estuary. The accidentally introduced hard-shell quahog is also found in British waters, mainly those near England, and does see some use in British cuisine. The Palourde clam by far is the most common native clam and it is both commercially harvested as well as locally collected, and \"Spisula solida\", a relative of the Atlantic surf clam on the other side of the Atlantic, is seeing increased interest as a food source and aquaculture candidate; it is mainly found in the British Isles in Europe.\nItaly.\nIn Italy, clams are often an ingredient of mixed seafood dishes or are eaten together with pasta. The more commonly used variety of clams in Italian cooking is the \"vongola\" \"(Venerupis decussata)\", although regional cuisines include the \"tellina\" or \"(Donax trunculus)\", the o \"(Callista chione)\", the (\"Solen marginatus\", a kind of \"Razor clam\"), and the \"(Venus verrucosa)\".\nReligion.\nIn Islam, clams are considered halal in three Sunni sects, but not in Hanafi, as only fish are considered halal in Hanafi jurisprudence, not other aquatic animals. In Judaism, clams are not kosher.\nAs currency.\nSome species of clam, particularly \"Mercenaria mercenaria\", were in the past used by the Algonquians of Eastern North America to manufacture wampum, a type of sacred jewellery; and to make shell money.\nSpecies.\nEdible:\nNot usually considered edible:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "55530", "revid": "20483999", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55530", "title": "Personal protective equipment", "text": "Equipment designed to help protect an individual from hazards\nPersonal protective equipment (PPE) is protective clothing, helmets, goggles, or other garments or equipment designed to protect the wearer's body from injury or infection. The hazards addressed by protective equipment include physical, electrical, heat, chemical, biohazards, and airborne particulate matter. Protective equipment may be worn for job-related occupational safety and health purposes, as well as for sports and other recreational activities. \"Protective clothing\" is applied to traditional categories of clothing, and \"protective gear\" applies to items such as pads, guards, shields, or masks, and others. PPE suits can be similar in appearance to a cleanroom suit.\nThe purpose of personal protective equipment is to reduce employee exposure to hazards when engineering controls and administrative controls are not feasible or effective to reduce these risks to acceptable levels. PPE is needed when there are hazards present. PPE has the serious limitation that it does not eliminate the hazard at the source and may result in employees being exposed to the hazard if the equipment fails.\nAny item of PPE imposes a barrier between the wearer/user and the working environment. This can create additional strains on the wearer, impair their ability to carry out their work and create significant levels of discomfort. Any of these can discourage wearers from using PPE correctly, therefore placing them at risk of injury, ill-health or, under extreme circumstances, death. Good ergonomic design can help to minimise these barriers and can therefore help to ensure safe and healthy working conditions through the correct use of PPE.\nPractices of occupational safety and health can use hazard controls and interventions to mitigate workplace hazards, which pose a threat to the safety and quality of life of workers. The hierarchy of hazard controls provides a policy framework which ranks the types of hazard controls in terms of absolute risk reduction. At the top of the hierarchy are elimination and substitution, which remove the hazard entirely or replace the hazard with a safer alternative. If elimination or substitution measures cannot be applied, engineering controls and administrative controls\u00a0\u2013 which seek to design safer mechanisms and coach safer human behavior\u00a0\u2013 are implemented. Personal protective equipment ranks last on the hierarchy of controls, as the workers are regularly exposed to the hazard, with a barrier of protection. The hierarchy of controls is important in acknowledging that, while personal protective equipment has tremendous utility, it is not the desired mechanism of control in terms of worker safety.\nHistory.\nEarly PPE such as body armor, boots and gloves focused on protecting the wearer's body from physical injury. The plague doctors of sixteenth-century Europe also wore protective uniforms consisting of a full-length gown, helmet, glass eye coverings, gloves and boots (see Plague doctor costume) to prevent contagion when dealing with plague victims. These were made of thick material which was then covered in wax to make it water-resistant. A mask with a beak-like structure was filled with pleasant-smelling flowers, herbs and spices to prevent the spread of miasma, the prescientific belief of bad smells which spread disease through the air. In more recent years, scientific personal protective equipment is generally believed to have begun with the cloth facemasks promoted by Wu Lien-teh in the 1910\u201311 Manchurian pneumonic plague outbreak, although some doctors and scientists of the time doubted the efficacy of facemasks in preventing the spread of that disease since they didn't believe it was transmitted through the air.\nTypes.\nPersonal protective equipment can be categorized by the area of the body protected, by the type of hazard, and by the type of garment or accessory. A single item\u00a0\u2013 for example, boots\u00a0\u2013 may provide multiple forms of protection: a steel toe cap and steel insoles for protection of the feet from crushing or puncture injuries, impervious rubber and lining for protection from water and chemicals, high reflectivity and heat resistance for protection from radiant heat, and high electrical resistivity for protection from electric shock. The protective attributes of each piece of equipment must be compared with the hazards expected to be found in the workplace. More breathable types of personal protective equipment may not lead to more contamination but do result in greater user satisfaction.\nRespirators.\nRespirators are protective breathing equipment, which protect the user from inhaling contaminants in the air, thus preserving the health of their respiratory tract. There are two main types of respirators. One type of respirator functions by filtering out chemicals and gases, or airborne particles, from the air breathed by the user. The filtration may be either passive or active (powered). Gas masks and particulate respirators (like N95 masks) are examples of this type of respirator. A second type of respirator protects users by providing clean, respirable air from another source. This type includes airline respirators and self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). In work environments, respirators are relied upon when adequate ventilation is not available or other engineering control systems are not feasible or inadequate.\nIn the United Kingdom, an organization that has extensive expertise in respiratory protective equipment is the Institute of Occupational Medicine. This expertise has been built on a long-standing and varied research programme that has included the setting of workplace protection factors to the assessment of efficacy of masks available through high street retail outlets.\nThe Health and Safety Executive (HSE), NHS Health Scotland and Healthy Working Lives (HWL) have jointly developed the RPE (Respiratory Protective Equipment) Selector Tool, which is web-based. This interactive tool provides descriptions of different types of respirators and breathing apparatuses, as well as \"dos and don'ts\" for each type.\nIn the United States, The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) provides recommendations on respirator use, in accordance to NIOSH federal respiratory regulations 42 CFR Part 84. The National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory (NPPTL) of NIOSH is tasked towards actively conducting studies on respirators and providing recommendations.\nSurgical masks.\nSurgical masks are sometimes considered as PPE, but are not considered as respirators, being unable to stop submicron particles from passing through, and also having unrestricted air flow at the edges of the masks.\nSurgical masks are not certified for the prevention of tuberculosis.\nSkin protection.\nOccupational skin diseases such as contact dermatitis, skin cancers, and other skin injuries and infections are the second-most common type of occupational disease and can be very costly. Skin hazards, which lead to occupational skin disease, can be classified into four groups. Chemical agents can come into contact with the skin through direct contact with contaminated surfaces, deposition of aerosols, immersion or splashes. Physical agents such as extreme temperatures and ultraviolet or solar radiation can be damaging to the skin over prolonged exposure. Mechanical trauma occurs in the form of friction, pressure, abrasions, lacerations and contusions. Biological agents such as parasites, microorganisms, plants and animals can have varied effects when exposed to the skin.\nAny form of PPE that acts as a barrier between the skin and the agent of exposure can be considered skin protection. Because much work is done with the hands, gloves are an essential item in providing skin protection. Some examples of gloves commonly used as PPE include rubber gloves, cut-resistant gloves, chainsaw gloves and heat-resistant gloves. For sports and other recreational activities, many different gloves are used for protection, generally against mechanical trauma.\nOther than gloves, any other article of clothing or protection worn for a purpose serve to protect the skin. Lab coats for example, are worn to protect against potential splashes of chemicals. Face shields serve to protect one's face from potential impact hazards, chemical splashes or possible infectious fluid.\nMany migrant workers need training in PPE for Heat Related Illnesses prevention (HRI). Based on study results, research identified some potential gaps in heat safety education. While some farm workers reported receiving limited training on pesticide safety, others did not. This could be remedied by incoming groups of farm workers receiving video and in-person training on HRI prevention. These educational programs for farm workers are most effective when they are based on health behavior theories, use adult learning principles and employ train-the-trainer approaches.\nEye protection.\nEach day, about 2,000 US workers have a job-related eye injury that requires medical attention. Eye injuries can happen through a variety of means. Most eye injuries occur when solid particles such as metal slivers, wood chips, sand or cement chips get into the eye. Smaller particles in smokes and larger particles such as broken glass also account for particulate matter-causing eye injuries. Blunt force trauma can occur to the eye when excessive force comes into contact with the eye. Chemical burns, biological agents, and thermal agents, from sources such as welding torches and UV light, also contribute to occupational eye injury.\nWhile the required eye protection varies by occupation, the safety provided can be generalized. Safety glasses provide protection from external debris, and should provide side protection via a wrap-around design or side shields.\nHearing protection.\nIndustrial noise is often overlooked as an occupational hazard, as it is not visible to the eye. Overall, about 22\u00a0million workers in the United States are exposed to potentially damaging noise levels each year. Occupational hearing loss accounted for 14% of all occupational illnesses in 2007, with about 23,000 cases significant enough to cause permanent hearing impairment. About 82% of occupational hearing loss cases occurred to workers in the manufacturing sector. In the US the Occupational Safety and Health Administration establishes occupational noise exposure standards. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recommends that worker exposures to noise be reduced to a level equivalent to 85\u00a0dBA for eight hours to reduce occupational noise-induced hearing loss.\nPPE for hearing protection consists of earplugs and earmuffs. Workers who are regularly exposed to noise levels above the NIOSH recommendation should be provided with hearing protection by the employers, as they are a low-cost intervention. A personal attenuation rating can be objectively measured through a hearing protection fit-testing system. The effectiveness of hearing protection varies with the training offered on their use. On January 2025 NIOSH published a Science Policy Update recommending employers use individual, quantitative fit testing to evaluate the attenuation received by workers from their hearing protection devices.\nProtective clothing and ensembles.\nThis form of PPE is all-encompassing and refers to the various suits and uniforms worn to protect the user from harm. Lab coats worn by scientists and ballistic vests worn by law enforcement officials, which are worn on a regular basis, would fall into this category. Entire sets of PPE, worn together in a combined suit, are also in this category.\nEnsembles.\nBelow are some examples of ensembles of personal protective equipment, worn together for a specific occupation or task, to provide maximum protection for the user:\nIn sports.\nParticipants in sports often wear protective equipment. Studies performed on the injuries of professional athletes, such as that on NFL players, question the effectiveness of existing personal protective equipment.\nLimits of the definition.\nThe definition of what constitutes personal protective equipment varies by country. In the United States, the laws regarding PPE also vary by state. In 2011, workplace safety complaints were brought against Hustler and other adult film production companies by the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, leading to several citations brought by Cal/OSHA. The failure to use condoms by adult film stars was a violation of Cal/OSHA's Blood borne Pathogens Program, Personal Protective Equipment. This example shows that personal protective equipment can cover a variety of occupations in the United States, and has a wide-ranging definition.\nLegislation.\nUnited States.\nThe National Defense Authorization Act for 2022 defines personal protective equipment as &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nUnder this Act, US military services are prohibited from purchasing PPE from suppliers in North Korea, China, Russia or Iran, unless there are problems with the supply or cost of PPE of \"satisfactory quality and quantity\".\nEuropean Union.\nAt the European Union level, personal protective equipment is governed by Directive 89/686/EEC on personal protective equipment (PPE). The Directive is designed to ensure that PPE meets common quality and safety standards by setting out basic safety requirements for personal protective equipment, as well as conditions for its placement on the market and free movement within the EU single market. It covers \"any device or appliance designed to be worn or held by an individual for protection against one or more health and safety hazards\". The directive was adopted on 21 January 1989 and came into force on 1 July 1992. The European Commission additionally allowed for a transition period until 30 June 1995 to give companies sufficient time to adapt to the legislation. After this date, all PPE placed on the market in EU Member States was required to comply with the requirements of Directive 89/686/EEC and carry the CE Marking.\nArticle 1 of Directive 89/686/EEC defines personal protective equipment as any device or appliance designed to be worn or held by an individual for protection against one or more health and safety hazards. PPE which falls under the scope of the Directive is divided into three categories:\nDirective 89/686/EEC on personal protective equipment does not distinguish between PPE for professional use and PPE for leisure purposes.\nPersonal protective equipment falling within the scope of the Directive must comply with the basic health and safety requirements set out in Annex II of the Directive. To facilitate conformity with these requirements, harmonized standards are developed at the European or international level by the European Committee for Standardization (CEN, CENELEC) and the International Organization for Standardization in relation to the design and manufacture of the product. Usage of the harmonized standards is voluntary and provides presumption of conformity. However, manufacturers may choose an alternative method of complying with the requirements of the Directive.\nPersonal protective equipment excluded from the scope of the Directive includes:\nThe European Commission is currently working to revise Directive 89/686/EEC. The revision will look at the scope of the Directive, the conformity assessment procedures and technical requirements regarding market surveillance. It will also align the Directive with the New Legislative Framework. The European Commission is likely to publish its proposal in 2013. It will then be discussed by the European Parliament and Council of the European Union under the ordinary legislative procedure before being published in the Official Journal of the European Union and becoming law.\nResearch.\nResearch studies in the form of randomized controlled trials and simulation studies are needed to determine the most effective types of PPE for preventing the transmission of infectious diseases to healthcare workers.\nThere is low certainty evidence that supports making improvements or modifications to PPE in order to help decrease contamination. Examples of modifications include adding tabs to masks or gloves to ease removal and designing protective gowns so that gloves are removed at the same time. In addition, there is low certainty evidence that the following PPE approaches or techniques may lead to reduced contamination and improved compliance with PPE protocols: Wearing double gloves, following specific doffing (removal) procedures such as those from the CDC, and providing people with spoken instructions while removing PPE.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

What is regarded as conventional sex depends on cultural and subcultural norms. It can also describe penetrative sex which does not have any element of BDSM, kink or fetish.\nConventional sexual acts in the Western world.\nAmong heterosexual couples in the Western world, for example, conventional sex often refers to sexual intercourse in the missionary position. \nThe \"British Medical Journal\" regards conventional sex between homosexual couples as \"sex that does not extend beyond affection, mutual masturbation, and oral and anal sex.\" In addition to mutual masturbation (including manual sex), penetrative sexual activity among same-sex pairings is contrasted by non-insertive acts such as intercrural sex, frot and tribadism, although tribadism has been cited as a common but rarely discussed sexual practice among lesbians.\n\"Vanilla sex\".\nThe term \"vanilla sex\" is often used to describe conventional sex which does not include explicit elements of BDSM, kink or fetishism.\nIn relationships where only one partner enjoys less conventional forms of sexual expression, the partner who does not enjoy such activities as much as the other is often referred to as the \"vanilla partner\". As such, it is easy for them to be erroneously branded unadventurous in sexual matters. Through exploration with their partner, it may be possible for a more vanilla-minded person to discover new facets of their sexuality. As with any sexually active person, they may find their preferences on the commonly termed \"vanilla-kink spectrum\" are sufficient for their full satisfaction.\nThe term \"vanilla\" in \"vanilla sex\" leverages the polysemic nature of the term, meaning both literally \"vanilla\", the flavour of as the pod of the \"Vanilla\" genus or the orchid \"Vanilla planifolia,\" or \"conventional\", depending on the context.\nVanilla flavour has been the most common flavour for ice cream for over 200 years, leading to the flavor being associated with being plain, basic, or conventional. The figurative meaning was added in the 1970s, though earlier examples exist.\nA notable early instance appears in a 1942 \"LIFE\" magazine article, suggesting the metaphorical use was already familiar to the public. In 1997, the OED expanded the definition to include sexual contexts, particularly \"vanilla sex,\" referring to conventional, non-kinky activity. Several citations stem from 1970s gay and lesbian discourse, coinciding with a rise in visibility and activism, indicating cultural shifts shaped the modern usage.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was first shown on Monday evenings at around 5:15-5:20pm, beginning on 28 September 1970, in all ITV regions, apart from Thames (London) and Southern which broadcast the series the following Friday.\nOverview.\nThe series is centred on two children, Simon Randall (Spencer Banks) and Liz Skinner (Cheryl Burfield), who discover a strange anomaly, known as the Time Barrier, which enables them to travel in time, and visit the past as well as alternative futures. The time barrier, which operates in a field at a disused military base, moves the children not only through time but also through space: for example, they travel from St Oswald's in the UK in 1940 to the Antarctic in one projection of 1990.\nThe children have contrasting personalities: Simon is studious, but Liz is something of a crybaby. This often leads to conflict, but as the series progresses, their antagonism matures into a deep bond of friendship.\nThe main theme of the series is the way humankind uses and abuses science and technology, and tends to support the idea that the pursuit of scientific knowledge and advancement leads to the depersonalisation of individuals and the abandonment of moral principles. A secondary theme, explored in the instances where Liz and Simon encounter potential future versions of themselves, is the extent to which an individual can change, or be changed, depending on the situations he or she encounters.\nSummary.\n\"The Wrong End of Time\".\nSimon, whose mother has recently died, has been taken on holiday in 1970 by the Skinner family \u2013 father Frank (Derek Benfield), mother Jean (Iris Russell) and daughter Liz \u2013 to the village of St Oswald. Frank had served at the (now abandoned) naval research base in St Oswald during World War II, where he had suffered amnesia. This has left him with no recollection of what happened during his time there. A local girl, Sarah, disappears through an invisible time barrier, witnessed by a local man, but nobody believes him when he tells the story in the pub where the Skinners are staying; but his story attracts a man called Charles Traynor (Denis Quilley), who arrives in the village and reveals that he was Skinner's commanding officer at the base during the war. Traynor had ordered Skinner to destroy the apparatus which the scientists at the base were working on, and he is eager to learn from Skinner if he succeeded in the task. This is because a German expeditionary team attacked and took over the base for a short time in 1940. The German commander, Gottfried (Sandor El\u00e8s), is now a prominent scientist, kidnapped and forced to work on the other side of the Iron Curtain, and Traynor is concerned that if the research work done at the base had fallen into his hands, it could be used against the West. While out playing near the ruins of the naval base, Liz and Simon encounter the Time Barrier for the first time. They are transported back to 1940, to the very day the Germans took over the base. There they encounter both Traynor, who is commander of the base, and Liz's father, a young naval recruit (played by John Alkin). A link is maintained to the present via Liz's mother, who is able to communicate telepathically with her daughter. After crossing the Time Barrier, Liz and Simon encounter Sarah, the teenage girl who fell through the barrier, and help her return to the present day. When the Germans arrive, Liz and Simon are initially captured, but then escape and succeed in helping young Frank Skinner carry out Traynor's orders to destroy the secret apparatus \u2013 a prototype laser weapon \u2013 before the Germans can seize it. They escape back through the Time Barrier, but instead of returning to St Oswald in their time of 1970, they find themselves in an icy wilderness.\nDuring their experience in 1940, Liz is shot yet the bullet does not harm her, which seems to confirm Traynor's advice to Liz's parents (in 1970) that the children are not actually in any danger from the time travel because they are only hallucinating about it and the past cannot harm them.\n\"The Time of the Ice Box\".\nThe icy wilderness is revealed to be Antarctica in the year 1990. Liz and Simon are rescued from the ice and brought to a research base \u2013 the International Institute for Biological Research, nicknamed the \"Ice Box\" - headed by Morgan C. Devereaux (John Barron). Liz and Simon manage to escape and return to the present time, but only just after Liz believes she has seen her mother in the Ice Box. In the present, Traynor is amazed to learn of Devereaux's presence in the future; he had been a student of Devereaux's and believed he had died in 1969. Using Simon's curiosity about these events, Traynor persuades the children to return to the Ice Box and Liz is stunned when she encounters first her mother, and then her future self, a cold and emotionless scientist going by the name Beth (Mary Preston), working in the Ice Box. The staff of the Ice Box are conducting controlled experiments on human volunteers, including tests of a longevity drug called HA57. A catalogue of failures has been plaguing the research effort, but Devereaux refuses to entertain the possibility that the base computer is making errors. The failures get worse, and Devereaux's behaviour becomes more and more erratic. Liz and Simon learn that Devereaux is a clone of the original Devereaux, the first in the world. Investigating further, Liz and Simon discover that the purpose of the computer is to create a new clone of Devereaux. This is so that the formula for the longevity drug, which is known only to Devereaux and not written down, can be preserved and kept secret. Liz discovers to her horror and disgust that her father Frank is also in the Ice Box, but has been buried under the ice for ten years as part of an experiment, but the experiment fails when the Ice Box temperature controls fail. The Ice Box researchers confront Devereaux, attempting to convince him that the computer is malfunctioning. Devereaux is unable to accept his failing and, suffering a mental breakdown, escapes out into the Antarctic ice. As the computer fails, the base begins to freeze over. The staff, including Jean and Beth, each take a dose of an anti-freeze formula in the hope of surviving the cold until rescue arrives. Liz and Simon depart; as they approach the Time Barrier, they discover the frozen body of Devereaux.\n\"The Year of the Burn Up\".\nThe Time Barrier returns Simon and Liz to 1970. Traynor warns them not to use the Time Barrier again. Determined to prevent the future of the Ice Box that they have witnessed, and curious as to what Traynor is afraid they might discover, they disobey him and once more enter the Time Barrier. Once again, they end up in 1990, but in an alternate future from that of the Ice Box. In this future, England is covered in tropical rainforest. Once again, Liz encounters her future self, Beth (once more played by Mary Preston). This time, however, she is a hippy Earth mother type who has rebelled against the technocracy that rules this future world, and lives in a primitive village with similar misfits. Simon also encounters his future self \u2013 a technocrat known as Controller 2957 (David Graham), charged with implementing the Master Plan intended to reshape the Earth to the benefit of humankind. The Master Plan had originally been devised in 1970 by Traynor. However, 2957 has since usurped him, and now Traynor, who is still alive in 1990, is determined to wreak his revenge. Traynor sabotages the computer managing the Master Plan. His interference ruins the Earth's climate, causing global temperatures to soar and leading to an environmental collapse of devastating proportions. Beth aids Liz and Simon in returning through the Time Barrier before heading for the safety of some caves with the misfits and 2957, who has seen the error of his ways, where there is water and they might stand a chance of survival.\n\"The Day of the Clone\".\nThe final serial ties together many of the elements of the previous serials. Believing that Beth needs her help, Liz attempts to return to 1990 via the Time Barrier, but is kidnapped by Traynor. Simon goes looking for Liz and tracks her to R1, a secret research establishment under Traynor's command, that is located at St. Oswald's and next to the Time Barrier. The children learn that R1 was established by Morgan C. Devereaux to research into the longevity drug \u2013 HA57 \u2013 that the children previously encountered in the Ice Box. They break out of R1 and, with Traynor in pursuit, they make their escape through the Time Barrier, which transports them to the year 1965. Realising that Devereaux would have been alive in this time, they return to R1. There the children learn that R1 is not only researching longevity, but also cloning. Devereaux believes that for the cloning and longevity process to be a success, subjects must also undergo psychological reconditioning, but Traynor, who is working at R1 as the Government's representative, disagrees, believing that Devereaux is turning the volunteer subjects into brainwashed puppets. When Traynor threatens to shut down R1, Devereaux has him detained and replaced by a clone. Devereaux's experiments fail and the young people Simon and Liz encounter at R1 in 1965, they meet again in 1970 only now they are all very old men and women on the point of dying. Simon realises that it is Devereaux who is the source of the dystopian futures they have witnessed, and that the Traynor they know has been a clone all along. The Time Barrier created a clone projection of Devereaux in the Ice Box in the hope that the children could return a working formula for HA57 to the Traynor clone in 1970. The Traynor clone is also a projection of the Time Barrier, charged with implementing Devereaux's vision of the future: the catastrophic Master Plan that will lead to the \"Burn Up\". Returning to 1970, Liz and Simon discover the real Traynor, locked up in a secret room in R1 since 1965. The children and the real Traynor confront the clone Traynor at the Time Barrier at St Oswald. Traynor tells the clone that he does not exist, that he is a projection. As the clone nears the Barrier, an invisible force grabs him and he disappears into the Time Barrier. Liz and Simon return to their families, leaving the real Traynor alone.\nProduction.\n\"Timeslip\" was devised by ATV script editor Ruth Boswell, who developed the format and the outline of the first story with her husband James. Its development was instigated by ATV producer Renee Goddard, who wanted to produce a programme that could challenge the popularity among children of the BBC's science fiction series \"Doctor Who\" (1963\u201389; 1996; 2005\u2013present). Boswell was determined to come up with a show that was rooted more firmly in everyday life than \"Doctor Who\", which at the time she felt had become progressively more outlandish. Much of the show's time travel concepts were based on the book \"An Experiment with Time\" by J. W. Dunne. However, in order to give the series as authentic a veneer as possible, Geoffrey Hoyle, son of physicist Fred Hoyle and a noted science fiction author in his own right, gave his advice regarding how time travel might be possible. In addition, the opening episodes of the first two serials - \"The Wrong End of Time\" and \"The Time of the Ice Box\" - were introduced by Peter Fairley, who was science correspondent for ITN.\nThe plot of the first serial, \"The Wrong End of Time\", was inspired by an \u2013 initially apocryphal (but according to some accounts confirmed after remaining a State Secret for more than 70 years) \u2013 story of a German Expeditionary Force that landed in Britain to carry out a raid on an Isle of Wight radar station in 1940 (or 1943), during World War II. The later stories were inspired by ecological concerns that were beginning to make headlines at the time \u2013 this has led to Jeff Arnold in the telefantasy journal \"Timescreen\" to draw parallels between \"Timeslip\" and the similarly inspired adult drama series \"Doomwatch\" (1970\u201372). This view was echoed by an article in \"TV Zone\" magazine, which noted that \"Timeslip\" \"was probably the general public's first introduction to what are now everyday scientific concepts, such as cloning and climate change\".\nAlthough Boswell originally conceived \"Timeslip\" as a single-story six-part serial, the concept was soon expanded into a much longer series of 26 episodes. New Zealander Bruce Stewart, who had adapted various science fiction short stories for the anthology series \"Out of this World\" (1962) and \"Out of the Unknown\" (1965\u201371), was tasked with developing Boswell's outline into scripts. Eighteen of the scripts were written by Stewart, before pressure of other work meant that Stewart had to move on, and the final serial, \"The Day of the Clone\", was written by Victor Pemberton. Pemberton is also credited with the script of the final episode of \"The Year of the Burn Up\", which acts as a bridge into \"The Day of the Clone\". Pemberton had previously served as script editor of \"Doctor Who\" and had penned the serial \"Fury from the Deep\".\nThe iconic opening titles for the series, using 3D lettering altered for each of the four stories. The light source moving round the letters to give shadows reminiscent of a sun dial. A standard 2D graphic of the same type face was used for the \"End of Part One\", \"Part Two\" and the closing credit captions in all four stories. In all cases, there was no consistency in the way the letter 'I' was arranged. It varied for each use, providing inconsistent 'logos' for the programme name. The first story's typeface used Westminster, a typeface designed for Westminster Bank to be used on cheques as it is easily recognisable by optical character recognition.\n\"Timeslip\" was recorded mainly in the studio. The most notable location used was that of the Ministry Field where Liz and Simon discover the Time Barrier \u2013 this was in fact the Burnt Farm Army Camp near Goff's Oak, Hertfordshire. The effect of the children passing through the Time Barrier was achieved by way of a simple split screen effect.\nA sequel series was mooted, but was not made, as John Cooper felt that the idea had run its natural course. Additionally, the series went well over budget, and the potential for sales of the series was lost because some episodes were made in black and white.\nVictor Pemberton acquired the rights to \"Timeslip\" in the early 1990s, intending to produce either a re-make or sequel series. Nothing came of this attempt, however.\nCast and crew.\nCheryl Burfield, who played Liz Skinner, had begun her career as a child model. For her audition as Liz, she dressed in trousers and sported a pigtail to emphasise the tomboy nature of the character \u2013 an image that stuck for the duration of the series. The character of Liz was originally written as a 13-year-old; however, when the 18-year-old Burfield was cast, Liz's age was upped to 15.\n\"Timeslip\" was the first major television role for Spencer Banks, who played Simon Randall. Unlike his co-star, no change was needed to the age of his character; even though he was 15 at the time, he was able to pass as younger. Regarding the age difference between the two, Banks recalled that on their first meeting Cheryl Burfield remarked that she looked \"positively matronly beside him\". However, over the course of production, Banks grew and matured and his voice broke. Banks went on to star in the children's series \"Tightrope\" (1972) (made by the same team behind \"Timeslip\") and \"The Georgian House\" (1976). He also starred in the highly acclaimed TV drama \"Penda's Fen\" (1974) by David Rudkin.\nIn 2015, Banks and Burfield played characters called Rev. Simon Randall and Liz Randall in \"The Amityville Playhouse\".\nDenis Quilley went on to become a leading figure in the National Theatre and was awarded the O.B.E. He died in 2003.\nIris Russell was best known for her role as Matron Stevenson in \"Emergency - Ward 10\" (1957\u201367) and appeared in the role of \"Father\" in \"The Avengers\" episode \"Stay Tuned\" (1969).\nDerek Benfield later went on to appear in regular roles in \"The Brothers\" (1972\u201376) and \"Hetty Wainthropp Investigates\" (1996\u201398). He also enjoyed a successful career as a playwright. He died in 2009.\nDavid Graham (Controller 2957/Simon Randall) was a regular voice artist in the Gerry Anderson Century 21 Supermarionation series. He voiced \"Parker\", \"Brains\" and \"Gordon Tracy\" as well as others in \"Thunderbirds\"; also voicing characters in \"Stingray\", \"Fireball XL5\", \"Four Feather Falls\", \"The Secret Service\" and \"Supercar\". He appeared in \"Doctor Who\" in the stories \"The Gunfighters\" and \"City of Death\", in addition to voicing Daleks in several episodes.\nIan Fairbairn (Alpha 4 and Doctor Frazer) had minor roles on \"Doctor Who\", including the Patrick Troughton stories \"The Macra Terror\" and \"The Invasion\", \"Inferno\" with Jon Pertwee and Tom Baker's \"The Seeds of Doom\", the latter three directed by Douglas Camfield.\nContinuing Cast:\nThe Wrong End of Time:\nThe Time of the Ice Box:\nThe Year of the Burn Up:\nThe Day of the Clone:\nRuth Boswell went on to adapt Catherine Storr's novel \"Marianne Dreams\", as the children's television serial \"Escape Into Night\" (1972) and produced the first season of \"The Tomorrow People\" (1973\u201379; 1992\u201395).\nCritical reception.\nReviewing the first episode in \"The Stage\", John Lawrence said, \"I always feel wary of programmes that are announced as \"science fiction\" since too often the description is applied to something that uses wild and improbable events to jump gaps in otherwise badly conceived stories... Judging by the first episode of ATV's new series, \"Timeslip\", by Bruce Stewart, however, this programme looks like it might prove to be a welcome exception. [...] Its strength lies in the fact that it is imaginatively conceived in terms of the detailed development of the plot, and well written. ...if the standard is maintained, it will be a series well worth watching, and not just by the children, either\". Later, during the broadcast of \"The Time of the Ice Box\", many of the children watching were frightened by the scene where Edith Joynton (Peggy Thorpe-Bates) ages to death thanks to an incorrect dosage of HA57; this scene was edited slightly when the series was repeated in 1973.\n\"Timeslip\" has generally remained well-regarded in the years since first broadcast. A retrospective of the series in \"Dreamwatch\" magazine in 1996 concluded that \"Timeslip\" was \"a series that demanded much of the viewer over 26 weeks and rewarded those who persevered\". In 1999, when science fiction magazine \"SFX\" asked an expert panel from the SF field, including Terry Pratchett and Stephen Baxter, to compile a list of the top 50 SF shows of all time, \"Timeslip\" came thirtieth on the list. Later, in 2005, \"SFX\" went on to poll its readers for their list of the top 50 British telefantasy shows and \"Timeslip\" was voted into twenty-eighth position on the list, the magazine describing it as \"surprisingly intelligent and thoughtful SF with some ambitious ideas\" and a series that \"dared to be more adventurous with its science fiction than most so-called grown-up SF shows\".\nArchive status.\nMost of \"Timeslip\" was originally recorded on 625 line PAL colour videotape. An exception was episodes 23 and 24, which were recorded in black-and-white due to the so-called colour strike, an industrial action by technicians that affected many ITV programmes at this time. Today, only the final episode of \"The Time of the Ice Box\" survives in its original colour format. The remaining episodes exist as 16mm black-and-white telerecordings, which were made for overseas sales to countries not yet broadcasting in colour. Research for the 2009 documentary 'Timeslip: Behind the Barrier' revealed that only two episodes were recorded in black-and-white. An extra scene for episode 25 had to be taped during the same recording session, meaning that this episode was broadcast only in black-and-white.\nIt is believed the original videotapes for the wiped episodes were wiped and reused by Central in 1982 or '83 after they took over from ATV providing ITV programmes to the Midlands during an archive purge of programmes of their predecessors. At the time, these programmes were seen to have no commercial value and were deemed worthless. Other sources claim that when Central had taken over, it was found that the videotapes had been badly damaged by age and poor storage conditions and were disposed of on the grounds of poor technical quality unsuitable for broadcast.\nHome video release.\n\"Timeslip\" was released on VHS videotape by ITC Home Entertainment in 1992, with each serial issued as a double-pack. It was released entirely in black-and-white. \nThe complete series \u2013 including the now-found colour episode \u2013 was released in a four-disc region 2 DVD box set by Carlton in 2004. \nA region 1 DVD, containing a restored and uncut version of the series, included the documentary \"Beyond the Barrier\". This was issued in 2005 by A&amp;E Home Video, under license from Granada International Media Limited. A new DVD release by Network Distributing was released in 2016 in black-and-white.\n\"Timeslip: Behind the Barrier\", an independent documentary chronicling the making of Timeslip was produced in 2009. It features interviews with many of the surviving cast members, including Cheryl Burfield, Spencer Banks, David Graham, Ian Fairbairn and Iris Russell as well as creator Ruth Boswell, writers Bruce Stewart and Victor Pemberton and director Ron Francis. It was produced by the owners of the official Timeslip website.\nOther media.\nA comic strip, which depicted several new adventures for Liz and Simon, appeared concurrently with the broadcast of the series in \"Look-In\", a juvenile spin-off of the listings magazine \"TV Times\". The comic strip was drawn by Mike Noble.\"Look-In\" also published a number of interviews with the show's two young stars.\nA novelisation of the first two serials - \"The Wrong End of Time\" and \"The Time of the Ice Box\" - was written by James Boswell and published by Pan Books to coincide with the broadcast of the series in 1970. It is visible on-screen in episode 6 of the series \"Tightrope\" on a rack of books in the village shop/post office.\nBig Finish.\nIn 2020, Big Finish Productions released a new series of \"Timeslip\". This comprised two box sets as full cast audio productions with original cast members Spencer Banks and Cheryl Burfield. The first box set was released on \"Timeslip\"'s 50th Anniversary in May 2020, with the second set following in June 2020. Two more box sets were released in July 2023 and then August 2023.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The city is also the administrative centre of the Odesa Raion and Odesa Oblast, as well as a multiethnic cultural centre. As of January 2021, Odesa's population was approximately On 25 January 2023, its historic city centre was declared a World Heritage Site and added to the List of World Heritage in Danger by the UNESCO World Heritage Committee in recognition of its multiculturality and 19th-century urban planning. The declaration was made in response to the bombing of Odesa during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which has damaged or destroyed buildings across the city.\nIn classical antiquity a large Greek settlement existed at its location no later than the middle of the 6th century BC. It has been researched as a possible site of the ancient Greek settlement of Histria. The first chronicle mention of the Slavic settlement-port of Kotsiubijiv, which was part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, dates back to 1415, when a ship was sent from here to Constantinople by sea. After the Grand Duchy lost control, the port and its surroundings became part of the domain of the Ottoman Empire in 1529, under the name Hacibey, and remained in it until the Ottomans' defeat in the Russo-Turkish War (1787\u20131792). In 1794, a decree of the Russian empress Catherine II was issued to establish a navy harbor and trading place in Khadjibey, which was named Odessa soon after. From 1819 to 1858, Odesa was a free port. During the Soviet period, it was an important trading port and a naval base. During the 19th century, Odesa was the fourth largest city of the Russian Empire, after Moscow, Saint Petersburg and Warsaw. Its historical architecture is more Mediterranean than Russian, having been heavily influenced by French and Italian styles. Some buildings are built in a mixture of different styles, including Art Nouveau, Renaissance and Classicist.\nOdesa is a warm-water port. The city of Odesa hosts both the Port of Odesa and Port Pivdennyi, a significant oil terminal situated in the city's suburbs. Another notable port, Chornomorsk, is located in the same oblast, to the south-west of Odesa. Together they represent a major transport hub integrating with railways. Odesa's oil and chemical processing facilities are connected to the Russian and other European networks by strategic pipelines. In 2000, the Quarantine Pier at Odesa Commercial Sea Port was declared a free port and free economic zone for a period of 25 years.\nName.\nOdesa is sometimes called the Pearl by the Sea, the Southern Capital, Odesa-mama and the Humour Capital, as well as Southern Palmyra.\nIn 1795 the city was named Odessa in accordance with the Greek Plan of Empress Catherine II. Catherine's Secretary of State Adrian Gribovsky claimed in his memoirs that the name was his suggestion. Some expressed doubts about this claim, while others noted the reputation of Gribovsky as an honest and modest man. Odesa is located between the ancient Greek cities of Tyras and Olbia and it was named using a Slavic feminine form for the ancient Greek city of Odessos (; in Roman times, Odessus). This refers to the second ancient Odessos, founded between the end of the 5th and beginning of the 4th centuries BC (the first one, identified with modern Varna in Bulgaria, is the older of the two, founded c.\u2009610 BC). The exact location of this ancient Odessos is unknown, but modern efforts have attempted to localize it 40\u00a0km northeast of Odesa, near the village of Koshary, Odesa Oblast., near the Tylihul Estuary.\n\"Odessa\", the transliteration of the name from Russian, was the traditional English spelling of the city's name favoured before Ukraine's independence in 1991 (similar to the spelling of Kiev versus Kyiv). It remained the predominant spelling until the mid-2010s, when international usage began to adopt the official transliteration \"Odesa\" as endorsed by the Ukrainian government.\n\"Odesa\" became the internationally standardized Latin-alphabet transliteration of the Ukrainian name according to the Ukrainian National romanization system, which was adopted for official use by Ukraine's cabinet in 2010, approved by the UN Group of Experts on Geographical Names in 2012, and adopted by the BGN/PCGN in 2019. This spelling appears in \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\" and in dictionaries as the spelling for the Ukrainian city. The spelling \"Odesa\" has also been adopted as the Library of Congress Name Authority Heading. As noted by the \"Christian Science Monitor\", many in the English-language media outlets historically spelled the city \"Odessa\", even after changing the spelling of Kiev to Kyiv, but since the beginning of Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine more outlets and style guides have been shifting away from Russian transliterations.\nHistory.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTimeline of Odesa\n Grand Duchy of Lithuania 1415\u201384\n Ottoman Empire 1484\u20131789\n Russian Empire 1789\u20131917\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n1917-1922 Revolution\n &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Hidden begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\n Russian Provisional Government 1917\n UPR Dec 1917\u2013Nov 1918\n OSR Jan\u2013March 1918\n Ukrainian State March\u2013Dec 1918\n AFSR Dec 1918\u2013April 1919\n PWPGU/ UkSSR April\u2013Aug 1919\n AFSR Aug 1919\u2013Feb 1920\n// UkSSR Feb 1920\u2013Dec 1922\n USSR 1922\u201341\n Kingdom of Romania (occupation) 1941\u201344 \n USSR 1944\u201391\n Ukraine 1991\u2013present\nEarly history.\nOdesa was the site of a large Greek settlement no later than the middle of the 6th century BC (a necropolis from the 5th\u20133rd centuries BC has long been known in this area). Some scholars believe it to have been a trade settlement established by the Greek city of Histria. Whether the Bay of Odesa is the ancient \"Port of the Histrians\" cannot yet be considered a settled question based on the available evidence. Archaeological artifacts confirm extensive links between the Odesa area and the eastern Mediterranean.\nIn the Middle Ages successive rulers of the Odesa region included various nomadic tribes (Petchenegs, Cumans), the Golden Horde, the Crimean Khanate, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and the Ottoman Empire. Yedisan Crimean Tatars traded there in the 14th century.\nSince the middle of the 13th century the city's territory belonged to the Golden Horde domain. On Italian navigational maps of 14th century on the place of Odesa is indicated the castle of Ginestra, at the time the center of a Gazarian colony of the Republic of Genoa. During the reign of Khan Hac\u0131 I Giray of Crimea (1441\u20131466), the Khanate was endangered by the Golden Horde and the Ottoman Turks and, in search of allies, the khan agreed to cede the area to Lithuania. The site of present-day Odesa was then a fortress known as Khadjibey (named for Hac\u0131 I Giray, and also spelled Kocibey in English, Hac\u0131bey or Hocabey in Turkish, and Hac\u0131bey in Crimean Tatar). Khadjibey was first mentioned in 1415 in Polish chronicles by Jan D\u0142ugosz, when a ship with grain sailed from there to Constantinople. By the middle of the 15th century, the settlement was depopulated.\nOttoman conquest.\nKhadjibey came under direct control of the Ottoman Empire after 1529. In the mid-18th century, the Ottomans rebuilt the fortress at Khadjibey (also known as Hocabey), which was named \"Yeni D\u00fcnya\" (literally \"New World\").\nRussian conquest of Sanjak of \u00d6zi (Ochakiv Oblast).\nA series of wars between the Russian Empire and the Ottoman Empire, as well as the demise of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, allowed Russia to start to fully exploit the ancient Black Sea trade across the coastal area through the steppe across southern and eastern Ukraine, into the hinterland of East Central Europe. Stable commercial activity in this region in practice in the past required both security through the overland routes, and knowledge of where products could go overseas. In antiquity, various Greek colonies had taken this role, followed by the Varangians who established Kievan Rus' in the 9th century, as well as various Italian colonies after the Mongol invasion of Europe.1-3 Under Catherine the Great, Russia gained, via the Treaty of K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Kaynarca, the lands where Mariupol, Kherson, and Mykolaiv would be founded. However, they were all handicapped in various ways relative to how much commercial interest there was. For example, the latter two cities were situated in lowlands near marshes, which provided for poor sanitary conditions in the technology available at that time.5\nThe sleepy fishing village of Odesa had witnessed a sea-change in its fortunes when the wealthy magnate and future Voivode of Kiev (1791), Antoni Protazy Potocki, established trade routes through the port for the \"Polish Black Sea Trading Company\" and set up the infrastructure in the 1780s.\nDuring the Russian-Turkish War of 1787\u20131792, on 25 September 1789, a detachment of Russian forces, including Zaporozhian Cossacks under Alexander Suvorov and Ivan Gudovich, took Khadjibey and Yeni D\u00fcnya for the Russian Empire. One section of the troops came under command of a Spaniard in Russian service: Major General Jos\u00e9 de Ribas (known in Russia as Osip Mikhailovich Deribas); today, the main street in Odesa, Deribasivska Street, is named after him.\nRussia formally gained possession of the Sanjak of \u00d6zi (Ochakiv Oblast) as a result of the Treaty of Jassy (Ia\u015fi) in 1792 and it became a part of Yekaterinoslav Viceroyalty. The Russian Empire took full control of Crimea, as well as land between the Southern Bug and the Dniester, including the Khadzhibey Estuary where the Turkish fortress of Khadjibey was located. The newly acquired Ochakov Oblast was promised to the Cossacks by the Russian government for resettlement. On permission of the Archbishop of Yekaterinoslav Amvrosiy, the Black Sea Kosh Host, that was located around the area between Bender and Ochakiv, built a second wooden church of Saint Nicholas, after the one in Sucleia.\nBy the Highest rescript of 17 June 1792 addressed to General Kakhovsky it was ordered to establish the Dniester Border Line of fortresses. The commander of the land forces in Ochakiv Oblast was appointed Graf (Count) Suvorov-Rymnikskiy. The main fortress was built near Sucleia at the mouth of river Botna as the Head Dniester Fortress by Engineer-Major de Wollant. Near the new fortress saw the formation of a new \"Vorstadt\" (suburb) where people moved from Sucleia and Parkan. With the establishment of the Voznesensk Governorate on 27 January 1795, the Vorstadt was named Tiraspol.\nThe Flemish engineer working for the Russian Empress Catherine the Great, Jos\u00e9 de Ribas's collaborator Franz de Voland recommended the area of Khadjibey fortress as the site for the region's basic port: it had an ice-free harbor, breakwaters could be cheaply constructed that would render the harbor safe and it would have the capacity to accommodate large fleets. The Namestnik of Yekaterinoslav and Voznesensk, Platon Zubov (one of Catherine's favorites), supported this proposal. In 1794 Catherine issued a Rescript to Jos\u00e9 de Ribas: \"Considering favorable Khadjibey location... I order to establish here a navy harbor and trading pierce...\" and invested the first money (26.000 rubles) in construction. Franz de Voland drew up a plan that would end up being the city's plan.7\nHowever, adjacent to the new official locality, a Moldavian colony already existed, which by the end of the 18th century was an independent settlement named Moldavanka. Some local historians consider that the settlement predates Odesa by about thirty years and assert that the locality was founded by Moldavians who came to build the fortress of Yeni Dunia for the Ottomans and eventually settled in the area in the late 1760s, right next to the settlement of Khadjibey, on what later became the Primorsky Boulevard. Another version posits that the settlement appeared after Odesa itself was founded, as a settlement of Moldavians, Greeks, and Albanians fleeing the Ottoman yoke.\nUnder Paul I of Russia, construction of Odesa was stopped, Franz de Voland was removed from the project, and Jos\u00e9 de Ribas was implicated in a plot to assassinate the Emperor. After Paul's assassination in 1801, the city resumed construction, and used a plan largely from de Voland's work. It was thus one of the few master planned cities in the Russian Empire.13\nRenaming of the settlement and establishment of sea port.\nIn 1795, Khadjibey was officially renamed with the feminine name \" ()\" after a Greek colony of Odessos that supposedly was located in the area. The first census that was conducted in Odesa was in 1797 which accounted for 3,455 people. Since 1795, the city had its own city magistrate, and since 1796 a city council of six members and the Odesa Commodity Exchange. In 1801, in Odesa had opened the first commercial bank. In 1803, the city accounted for 9,000 people.\nIn their settlement, also known as Novaya Slobodka, the Moldavians owned relatively small plots on which they built village-style houses and cultivated vineyards and gardens. What became Mykhailovsky Square was the center of this settlement and the site of its first Orthodox church, the Church of the Dormition, built in 1821 close to the seashore, as well as a cemetery. Nearby stood the military barracks and the country houses (\"dacha\") of the city's wealthy residents, including that of the Duc de Richelieu, appointed by Tsar Alexander I as Governor of Odesa in 1803. Richelieu played a role during Ottoman plague epidemic which hit Odesa in the autumn 1812. Dismissive of any attempt to forge a compromise between quarantine requirements and free trade, Prince Kuriakin (the Saint Petersburg-based High Commissioner for Sanitation) countermanded Richelieu's orders.\nIn the period from 1795 to 1814, the population of Odesa increased 15 times over and reached almost 20 thousand people. The first city plan was designed by the engineer F. Devollan in the late 18th century. Colonists of various ethnicities settled mainly in the area of the former colony, outside of the official boundaries, and as a consequence, in the first third of the 19th century, Moldavanka emerged as the dominant settlement. After planning by the official architects who designed buildings in Odesa's central district, such as the Italians Francesco Carlo Boffo and Giovanni Torricelli (see Italians of Odesa), Moldovanka was included in the general city plan, though the original grid-like plan of Moldovankan streets, lanes, and squares remained unchanged.\nThe new city quickly became a major success although initially, it received little state funding and privileges. Its early growth owed much to the work of the Duc de Richelieu, who served as the city's governor between 1803 and 1814. Having fled the French Revolution, he had served in Catherine's army against the Turks. He is credited with designing the city and organizing its amenities and infrastructure, and is considered one of the founding fathers of Odesa, together with another Frenchman, Count Andrault de Langeron, who succeeded him in office.\nRichelieu is commemorated by a bronze statue, unveiled in 1828 to a design by Ivan Martos. His contributions to the city are mentioned by Mark Twain in his travelogue \"Innocents Abroad\": \"I mention this statue and this stairway because they have their story. Richelieu founded Odessa \u2013 watched over it with paternal care \u2013 labored with a fertile brain and a wise understanding for its best interests \u2013 spent his fortune freely to the same end \u2013 endowed it with a sound prosperity, and one which will yet make it one of the great cities of the Old World\".\nIn 1819, Odesa became a free port, a status it retained until 1859. Odesa became home to an extremely diverse population of Albanians, Armenians, Azeris, Bulgarians, Crimean Tatars, Frenchmen, Germans (including Mennonites), Greeks, Italians, Jews, Poles, Romanians, Russians, Turks, Ukrainians, and traders representing many other nationalities (hence numerous \"ethnic\" names on the city's map, for example \"Frantsuzky\" (French) and \"Italiansky\" (Italian) Boulevards, \"Grecheskaya\" (Greek), \"Yevreyskaya\" (Jewish), \"Arnautskaya\" (Albanian) Streets).\nThe Filiki Eteria, a Greek freemasonry-style society that was to play an important role in the Greek War of Independence, was founded in Odesa in 1814 before relocating to Constantinople in 1818. Hundreds of refugees from the Chios massacre settled in Odesa. Odesa's cosmopolitan nature was documented by the great Russian poet Alexander Pushkin, who lived in internal exile in Odesa between 1823 and 1824. In his letters, he wrote that Odesa was a city where \"the air is filled with all Europe, French is spoken and there are European papers and magazines to read\".\nOdesa's growth was interrupted by the Crimean War of 1853\u20131856, during which it was bombarded by British and Imperial French naval forces. It soon recovered and the growth in trade made Odesa Russia's largest grain-exporting port. In 1866, the city was linked by rail with Kyiv and Kharkiv as well as with Ia\u015fi in Romania.\nThe city became the home of a large Jewish community during the 19th century, and by 1897 Jews were estimated to comprise some 37% of the population. The community, however, was repeatedly subjected to anti-Semitism and anti-Jewish agitation from almost all Christian segments of the population. Pogroms were carried out in 1821, 1859, 1871, 1881 and 1905. Many Odesan Jews fled abroad after 1882, particularly to the Ottoman region that became Palestine, and the city became an important base of support for Zionism.\nUntil the 1870s, Odesa's Italian population grew steadily. From the following decade this growth stopped, and the decline of the Italian community in Odesa began. The reason was mainly one, namely the gradual integration into the Slavic population of Odesa, i.e. Russians and Ukrainians. Surnames began to be Russianized and Ukrainianized. The revolution of 1917 sent many of them to Italy, or to other cities in Europe. In Soviet times, only a few dozen Italians remained in Odesa, most of whom no longer knew their own language. Over time they merged with the local population, losing the ethnic connotations of origin. They disappeared completely by World War II.\nBeginnings of revolution.\nIn 1905, Odesa was the site of a workers' uprising supported by the crew of the Russian battleship \"Potemkin\" and the Menshevik's Iskra. Sergei Eisenstein's famous motion picture \"The Battleship Potemkin\" commemorated the uprising and included a scene where hundreds of Odesan citizens were murdered on the great stone staircase (now popularly known as the \"Potemkin Steps\"), in one of the most famous scenes in motion picture history. At the top of the steps, which lead down to the port, stands a statue of the Duc de Richelieu.\nThe actual massacre took place in streets nearby, not on the steps themselves, but the film caused many to visit Odesa to see the site of the \"slaughter\". The \"Odesa Steps\" continue to be a tourist attraction in Odesa. The film was made at Odesa's Cinema Factory, one of the oldest cinema studios in the former Soviet Union.\nFollowing the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917 during Ukrainian-Soviet War, Odesa saw two Bolshevik armed insurgencies, the second of which succeeded in establishing their control over the city; for the following months, the city became a center of the Odesa Soviet Republic. After signing of the Brest-Litovsk Treaty all Bolshevik forces were driven out by 13 March 1918 by the combined armed forces of the Austro-Hungarian Army, providing support to the Ukrainian People's Republic.\nWith the end of the World War I and the withdrawal of armies of Central Powers, the Soviet forces fought for control over the country with the army of the Ukrainian People's Republic. A few months later the city was occupied by the French Army and the Greek Army that supported the Russian White Army in its struggle with the Bolsheviks. The Ukrainian general Nykyfor Hryhoriv who sided with Bolsheviks managed to drive the Triple Entente forces out of the city, but Odesa was soon retaken by the Russian White Army. By 1920 the Soviet Red Army managed to overpower both the Ukrainian and Russian White Army and secure the city.\nThe people of Odesa suffered badly from a famine that resulted from the Russian Civil War in 1921\u20131922 due to the Soviet policies of prodrazverstka. In 1937, around 1,000 Poles were executed in Odesa during the Polish Operation of the NKVD.\nWorld War II.\nDuring World War II, Odesa was attacked by Romanian and German troops in August 1941. The Siege of Odessa (1941) started on 5 August and lasted for 73 days. The defense was organized on three lines with emplacements consisting of trenches, anti-tank ditches and pillboxes. The first line was long and situated some from the city. The second and main line of defense was situated from the city and was about long. The third and last line of defense was organized inside the city itself. Lyudmila Pavlichenko, the famous female sniper, took part in the battle for Odesa. She recorded 187 confirmed kills during the defense of Odesa. Pavlichenko's confirmed kills during World War II totaled 309 (including 36 enemy snipers).\nThe city fell to the Axis on 16 October 1941, and it was henceforth subject to Romanian administration. By that time, the Soviet authorities had been able to evacuate 200,000 people as well as weaponry and industrial equipment. A day later, Odesa was made the capital of Transnistria. Partisan fighting continued, however, in the city's catacombs.\nFollowing the siege, and the Axis occupation, approximately 25,000 Odesans were murdered in the outskirts of the city and over 35,000 deported; this came to be known as the 1941 Odessa massacre. Most of the atrocities were committed during the first six months of the occupation which officially began on 17 October 1941, when 80 per cent of the 210,000 Jews in the region were killed, compared to Jews in Romania proper where the majority survived. After the Nazi forces began to lose ground on the Eastern Front, the Romanian administration changed its policy, refusing to deport the remaining Jewish population to extermination camps in German occupied Poland, and allowing Jews to work as hired labourers. As a result, despite the events of 1941, the survival of the Jewish population in this area was higher than in other areas of occupied eastern Europe.\nA Soviet medal, \"For the Defence of Odesa\", was established on 22 December 1942. It was one of the first four Soviet cities to be awarded the title of \"Hero City\" in 1945. (The others were Leningrad, Stalingrad, and Sevastopol). The city suffered severe damage and sustained many casualties over the course of the war. Many parts of Odesa were damaged during both its siege and recapture on 10 April 1944, when the city was finally liberated by the Red Army. Some of the Odesans had a more favourable view of the Romanian occupation, in contrast with the Soviet official view that the period was exclusively a time of hardship, deprivation, oppression and suffering \u2013 claims embodied in public monuments and disseminated through the media to this day. Subsequent Soviet policies imprisoned and executed numerous Odesans (and deported most of the German population) on account of collaboration with the occupiers.\nPostwar Soviet period.\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, the city grew. Nevertheless, the majority of Odesa's Jews emigrated to Israel, the United States and other Western countries between the 1970s and 1990s. Many ended up in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Brighton Beach, sometimes known as \"Little Odesa\". Domestic migration of the Odesan middle and upper classes to Moscow and Leningrad, cities that offered even greater opportunities for career advancement, also occurred on a large scale. Despite this, the city grew rapidly by filling the void of those left with new migrants from rural Ukraine and industrial professionals invited from all over the Soviet Union.\nAs a part of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, the city preserved and somewhat reinforced its unique cosmopolitan mix of Russian/Ukrainian/Jewish culture and a predominantly Russophone environment with the uniquely accented dialect of Russian spoken in the city. The city's unique identity has been formed largely thanks to its varied demography; all the city's communities have influenced aspects of Odesan life in some way or form.\nIndependent Ukraine.\nIn the 1991 Ukrainian independence referendum 85.38% of Odesa Oblast voted for independence.\nOdesa is a city of more than 1 million people. The city's industries include shipbuilding, oil refining, chemicals, metalworking, and food processing. Odesa is also a Ukrainian naval base and home to a fishing fleet. It is known for its large outdoor market \u2013 the Seventh-Kilometer Market, the largest of its kind in Europe.\nOdesa was a contender for hosting Euro 2012 football matches in, but lost the competition to other cities in Ukraine.\nThe city saw violence in the 2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine during the 2014 Odesa clashes. The 2 May 2014 Odesa clashes between pro-Ukrainian and pro-Russian protestors killed 42 people. Four were killed during the protests, and at least 32 people were killed after a trade union building was set on fire after Molotov cocktails exchange between sides. Polls conducted from September to December 2014 found no support for joining Russia.\nOdesa was struck by three bomb blasts in December 2014, one of which killed one person (the injuries sustained by the victim indicated that he had dealt with explosives). Internal Affairs Ministry advisor Zorian Shkiryak said on 25 December that Odesa and Kharkiv had become \"cities which are being used to escalate tensions\" in Ukraine. Shkiryak said that he suspected that these cities were singled out because of their \"geographic position\". On 5 January 2015 the city's Euromaidan Coordination Center and a cargo train car were (non-lethally) bombed.\nUntil 18 July 2020, Odesa was incorporated as a city of oblast significance. In July 2020, as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Odesa Oblast to seven, the city of Odesa was merged into newly established Odesa Raion.\nIn the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the city faced some Russian bombing attacks. On 23 April 2022, Russian troops bombarded Odesa with cruise missiles. They destroyed both the city's military infrastructure and residential buildings, killing eight people and wounding another eighteen people. In addition, the Russian military destroyed more than 1,000\u00a0m2 of the territory of the cemetery. The city suffered further aerial attacks on regional infrastructure facilities in October 2022, cutting off power to 10,500 households and injuring three people.\nOn 25 January 2023, UNESCO announced that the historical city center of Odesa was added to UNESCO's World Heritage List. In order to provide technical and financial assistance if needed, it was also included into the list of world heritage sites in danger.\nGeography.\nLocation.\nOdesa is located () in the Black Sea Lowland in Southern Ukraine which being part of the greater Eastern European Plain gradually slopes towards the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. The city lies on the northwestern coast of the Black Sea along the southwestern shore of the Gulf of Odesa, approximately north of the estuary of the Dniester river and some south of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv. The international border between Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova lies some west of the city.\nThe city is situated on terraced hills overlooking a small harbor. The average elevation at which the city is located is around . The maximum is and minimum (on the coast) amounts to above sea level. There are three large estuaries near the city: Kuialnyk, Khadzhibey and Sukhyi.\nThe city currently covers a territory of . The population density for which is around 6,139 persons/km2. Sources of running water in the city include the Dniester River, from which water is taken and then purified at a processing plant just outside the city. Being located in the south of Ukraine, the topography of the area surrounding the city is typically flat and there are no large mountains or hills for many kilometres around. Flora is of the deciduous variety and Odesa is known for its tree-lined avenues which, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, made the city a favourite year-round retreat for the Russian aristocracy.\nThe city's location on the coast of the Black Sea has also helped to create a booming tourist industry in Odesa. The city's Arkadia beach has long been a favourite place for relaxation, both for the city's inhabitants and its visitors. This is a large sandy beach which is located to the south of the city centre. Odesa's many sandy beaches are considered to be quite unique in Ukraine, as the country's southern coast (particularly in the Crimea) tends to be a location in which the formation of stoney and pebble beaches has proliferated.\nThe coastal cliffs adjacent to the city are home to frequent landslides, resulting in a typical change of landscape along the Black Sea. Due to the fluctuating slopes of land, city planners are responsible for monitoring the stability of such areas, and for preserving potentially threatened building and other structures of the city above sea level near water. Also a potential danger to the infrastructure and architecture of the city is the presence of multiple openings underground. These cavities can cause buildings to collapse, resulting in a loss of money and business. Due to the effects of climate and weather on sedimentary rocks beneath the city, the result is instability under some buildings' foundations.\nClimate.\nOdesa has a hot-summer humid continental climate (\"Dfa\", using the isotherm), bordering a cold semi-arid (\"BSk\") as well as a humid subtropical climate (\"Cfa\"). This has, over the past few centuries, aided the city greatly in creating conditions necessary for the development of summer tourism. During the tsarist era, Odesa's climate was considered to be beneficial for the body, and thus many wealthy but sickly persons were sent to the city in order to relax and recuperate. This resulted in the development of spa culture and the establishment of a number of luxury hotels in the city. The average annual temperature of the sea is . Seasonal sea temperatures range from an average of from January to March, to in August. Typically, for a total of 4 months \u2013 from June to September \u2013 the average sea temperature in the Gulf of Odesa and the city's bay area exceeds .\nThe city typically experiences dry, cold winters which are relatively mild when compared to most of Ukraine, as they are marked by temperatures that rarely fall below . Summers see an increased level of precipitation, and the city often experiences warm weather with temperatures often reaching the high 20s and low 30s \u00b0C. Snow cover is light to moderate due to the city's location on the northern coast of the Black Sea, and municipal services rarely experience problems that can often be found in other, more northern Ukrainian cities. The city hardly ever faces sea ice formation.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nHistorical ethnic and national composition.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOdesa Oblast is also home to many different nationalities and minority ethnic groups, including Albanians, Armenians, Azeris, Crimean Tatars, Bulgarians, Georgians, Greeks, Jews, Poles, Roma, Romanians, Turks, among others. Up until the early 1940s the city had a large Jewish population. As the result of mass deportation to extermination camps during the Second World War, the city's Jewish population declined considerably. Since the 1970s, the majority of the remaining Jewish population emigrated to Israel and other countries, shrinking the Jewish community. Through most of the 19th century and until the mid-20th century, the largest ethnic group in Odesa was Russians, with the second largest ethnic group being Jews.\nItalians trace their presence in what later would become Odessa to as early as 1200, when Genoese \"Ginestra\" trade ships anchored there. In 1797 there were about 800 Italians in Odesa, equal to 10% of the total population. For more than a century the Italians of Odesa greatly influenced the culture, art, industry, society, architecture, politics and economy of the city. Among the works created by the Italians of Odesa there were the Potemkin Stairs and the Odesa Opera and Ballet Theater. At the beginning of the 19th century the Italian language became the second official language in Odesa, after Russian. Until the 1870s, Odesa's Italian population grew steadily. From the following decade this growth stopped, and the decline of the Italian community in Odesa began. The reason was mainly one, namely the gradual integration into the Slavic population of Odesa, i.e. Russians and Ukrainians. Surnames began to be Russianized and Ukrainianized. The revolution of 1917 sent many of them to Italy, or to other cities in Europe. In Soviet times, only a few dozen Italians remained in Odesa, most of whom no longer knew their own language. Over time they merged with the local population, losing the ethnic connotations of origin. They disappeared completely by World War II.\nThe peculiarity of the ethnic composition of the modern population of the city of Odesa is its ethnic diversity. According to the 2001 Ukrainian census, Ukrainians made up 62% of the Odesa's inhabitants, Russians 29%, Bulgarians 6.1%, Moldovans 5%, Gagauz 1.1%, Jews 0.6%, Belarusians 0.5%, Armenians 0.3%, Roma 0.2%, Poles, Germans, Georgians, Azerbaijanis, Tartars, Greeks, Albanians and Arabs each 0.1%, and 1.9% were people of other nationalities. A 2015 study by the International Republican Institute found that 68% of Odesa's population were ethnic Ukrainians, and 25% were ethnic Russians.\nLanguage.\nDistribution of the population of the city of Odesa by native language according to the 2001 census:\nAccording to the Seventh Annual Ukrainian Municipal Survey, 96% of the residents of Odesa spoke some Russian at home and 29% spoke some Ukrainian at home (overlap due to a lot of people speaking both languages). Ukrainian is gaining in popularity: in 2021, the share of residents speaking some Ukrainian at home has increased almost 5 times from 6% in 2015 to 29% in 2021.\nAccording to a survey conducted by the International Republican Institute in April\u2013May 2023, 53% of the city's population has higher or incomplete higher education, 16% spoke Ukrainian at home and 80% spoke Russian.\n58% of Odesa Oblast's population consider Ukrainian their native language, and 39% of population in Ukraine's South who consider Ukrainian their native language mostly speak Russian at home.\nAccording to a sociological survey conducted by the Ilko Kucheriv Democratic Initiatives Foundation from 10 to 21 July 2023 in Odesa Oblast, the share of respondents who speak Ukrainian at home has increased to 42% (from 26% in 2021), while the share of those who speak Russian at home has dropped to 54%.\nGovernment and administrative divisions.\nOdesa is the administrative centre of Odesa Raion and Odesa Oblast, and it is the only constituent of Odesa urban hromada, one of the hromadas of Ukraine. The city of Odesa was previously governed by a mayor and city council which work cooperatively to ensure the smooth-running of the city and procure its municipal bylaws. The city's budget was also controlled by the administration. The mayoralty played the role of the executive in the city's municipal administration. Above all came the mayor who was elected by the city's electorate for five years in a direct election. In the 2015 mayoral election Hennadii Trukhanov was re-elected in the first round with 52,9% of the vote, and again in the second round of the 2020 election, receiving 54.28% of the vote.&lt;ref name=\"tyzhden.ua/post/249910\"&gt; https:// , The Ukrainian Week (17 November 2020)&lt;/ref&gt;\nOn 15 October 2025 Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy created the Odesa city military administration. Serhiy Lysak was appointed head of the military administration. Mayor Trukhanov was deemed ineligible to continue in office, as Ukrainian law prohibits officials from holding dual citizenship. One day earlier, Zelensky had signed a decree revoking Trukhanov\u2019s Ukrainian citizenship after the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) released a Russian passport it said belonged to him.\nThere are five deputy mayors, each of which is responsible for a certain particular part of the city's public policy.\nThe City Council of the city makes up the administration's legislative branch, thus effectively making it a city 'parliament' or rada. The municipal council is made up of 120 elected members, who are each elected to represent a certain district of the city for a four-year term. The current council is the fifth in the city's modern history, and was elected in January 2011. In the regular meetings of the municipal council, problems facing the city are discussed, and annually the city's budget is drawn up. The council has seventeen standing commissions which play an important role in controlling the finances and trading practices of the city and its merchants.\nThe territory of Odesa is divided into four administrative urban districts:\nIn addition, every district has its own administration, subordinate to the Odesa City council, and with limited responsibilities.\nCityscape.\nMany of Odesa's buildings have, rather uniquely for a Ukrainian city, been influenced by the Mediterranean style of classical architecture. This is particularly noticeable in buildings built by architects such as the Italian of Odesa Francesco Boffo, who in the early 19th-century built a palace and colonnade for the Governor of Odesa, Prince Mikhail Vorontsov, the Potocki Palace and many other public buildings.\nIn 1887 one of the city's most well known architectural monuments was completed \u2013 the theatre, which still hosts a range of performances to this day; it is widely regarded as one of the world's finest opera houses. The first opera house was opened in 1810 and destroyed by fire in 1873. The modern building was constructed by Fellner and Helmer in neo-baroque; its luxurious hall was built in the rococo style. It is said that thanks to its unique acoustics, even a whisper from the stage can be heard in any part of the hall. The theatre was projected along the lines of Dresden's Semperoper built in 1878, with its nontraditional foyer following the curvatures of the auditorium; the building's most recent renovation was completed in 2007.\nOdesa's most iconic symbol, the Potemkin Stairs, is a vast staircase that conjures an illusion so that those at the top only see a series of large steps, while at the bottom all the steps appear to merge into one pyramid-shaped mass. The original 200 steps (now reduced to 192) were designed by Italian architect Francesco Boffo and built between 1837 and 1841. The steps were made famous by Sergei Eisenstein in his film, \"Battleship Potemkin\".\nMost of the city's 19th-century houses were built of limestone mined nearby. Abandoned mines were later used and broadened by local smugglers. This created a gigantic, complicated labyrinth of tunnels beneath Odesa, known as the Odesa catacombs. During World War II, the catacombs served as a hiding place for partisans and natural shelter for civilians, who were escaping airplane bombing.\nDerybasivska Street, an attractive pedestrian avenue named after Jos\u00e9 de Ribas, the Neapolitan-born founder of Odesa and decorated Russian Navy Admiral from the Russo-Turkish War, is famous by its unique character and architecture. During the summer it is common to find large crowds of people leisurely sitting and talking on the outdoor terraces of numerous caf\u00e9s, bars and restaurants, or simply enjoying a walk along the cobblestone street, which is not open to vehicular traffic and is kept shaded by the linden trees which line its route. A similar streetscape can also be found in that of Prymorsky Bulvar, a grand thoroughfare which runs along the edge of the plateau upon which the city is situated, and where many of the city's most imposing buildings are to be found.\nAs one of the biggest on the Black Sea, Odesa's port is busy all year round. The Odesa Seaport is located on an artificial stretch of the Black Sea coast, along with the north-western part of the Gulf of Odesa. The total shoreline length of Odesa's seaport is around . The port, which includes an oil refinery, container handling facility, passenger area and numerous areas for handling dry cargo, is lucky in that its work does not depend on seasonal weather; the harbour itself is defended from the elements by breakwaters. The port is able to handle up to 14 million tons of cargo and about 24 million tons of oil products annually, whilst its passenger terminals can cater for around 4 million passengers a year at full capacity.\nAs Odesa has been inhabited by peoples of different religions, it has a variety of religious buildings, such as the Orthodox Transfiguration Cathedral, Catholic Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary Cathedral, Lutheran St. Paul's Church, Brodsky Synagogue, and Al-Salam Mosque. There is also a number of historic cemeteries, including the Cossack Kuialnyk Cemetery.\nIn late 2022 one of the city's former central landmarks, the monument to the founders of Odesa with its statue of Catherine the Great, was dismantled and temporarily moved to the Odesa Fine Arts Museum.\nParks and gardens.\nThere are a number of public parks and gardens in Odesa, among these are the Preobrazhensky, Gorky and Victory parks, the latter of which is an arboretum. The city is also home to a university botanical garden, which recently celebrated its 200th anniversary, and a number of other smaller gardens.\nThe City Garden, or Gorodskoy Sad, is perhaps the most famous of Odesa's gardens. Laid out in 1803 by Felix De Ribas (brother of the founder of Odesa, Jos\u00e9 de Ribas) on a plot of urban land he owned, the garden is located right in the heart of the city. When Felix decided that he was no longer able to provide enough money for the garden's upkeep, he decided to present it to the people of Odesa in 1806.\nThe garden is home to a bandstand and is the traditional location for outdoor theater in the summertime. Numerous sculptures can also be found within the grounds, as well as a musical fountain, the waters of which are computer controlled to coordinate with the musical melody being played.\nOdesa's largest park, Shevchenko Park (previously Alexander Park), was founded in 1875, during a visit to the city by Emperor Alexander II. The park covers an area of around and is located near the centre of the city, on the side closest to the sea. Within the park there are a variety of cultural and entertainment facilities, and wide pedestrian avenues.\nIn the center of the park is the local top-flight football team's Chornomorets Stadium, the Alexander Column and municipal observatory. The Baryatinsky Bulvar is popular for its route, which starts at the park's gate before winding its way along the edge of the coastal plateau. There are a number of monuments and memorials in the park, one of which is dedicated to the park's namesake, the Ukrainian national poet Taras Shevchenko.\nEducation.\nOdesa is home to several universities and other institutions of higher education. The city's best-known and most prestigious university is the Odesa 'I.I. Mechnykov' National University. This university is the oldest in the city and was first founded by an edict of Tsar Alexander II of Russia in 1865 as the Imperial Novorossian University. Since then the university has developed to become one of modern Ukraine's leading research and teaching universities, with staff of around 1,800 and total of thirteen academic faculties. Other than the National University, the city is also home to the 1921-inaugurated Odesa National Economic University, the Odesa National Medical University (founded 1900), the 1918-founded Odesa National Polytechnic University.\nIn addition to these universities, the city is home to the National University \"Odesa Law Academy\", the National Academy of Telecommunications, the Odesa State Environmental University and the Odesa National Maritime Academy. The last of these institutions is a highly specialised and prestigious establishment for the preparation and training of merchant mariners which sees around 1,000 newly qualified officer cadets graduate each year and take up employment in the merchant marines of numerous countries around the world. The South Ukrainian National Pedagogical University is also based in the city, this is one of the largest institutions for the preparation of educational specialists in Ukraine and is recognised as one of the country's finest of such universities.\nIn addition to all the state-run universities mentioned above, Odesa is also home to many private educational institutes and academies which offer highly specified courses in a range of different subjects.\nWith regard to primary and secondary education, Odesa has many schools catering for all ages from kindergarten through to lyceum (final secondary school level) age. Most of these schools are state-owned and operated, and all schools have to be state-accredited in order to teach children.\nCulture.\nMuseums, art and music.\nFine Arts museum is the biggest art gallery in the city, which collection includes canvas mostly of Russian painters from 17th-21st centuries, icon collection and modern art. The Odesa Museum of Western and Eastern Art is big art museum; it has large European collections from the 16\u201320th centuries along with the art from the East on display. There are paintings from Caravaggio, Mignard, Hals, Teniers and Del Piombo.\nOf note is Odesa's Alexander Pushkin Museum, which is dedicated to detailing the short time Pushkin spent in exile in Odesa, a period during which he continued to write. The poet also has a city street named after him, as well as a statue. Other museums in the city include the Odesa Archeological Museum, which is housed in a neoclassical building, the Odesa Numismatics Museum, the Odesa Museum of the Regional History, Museum of Heroic Defense of Odesa (411th Battery).\nAmong the city's public sculptures, two sets of \"Medici lions\" can be noted, at the Vorontsov Palace as well as in the Starosinnyi Garden.\nJacob Adler, the major star of the Yiddish theatre in New York and father of the actor, director and teacher Stella Adler, was born and spent his youth in Odesa. The most popular Russian show business people from Odesa are Yakov Smirnoff (comedian), Mikhail Zhvanetsky (legendary humorist writer, who began his career as a port engineer) and Roman Kartsev (comedian). Zhvanetsky's and Kartsev's success in the 1970s, along with Odesa's KVN team, contributed to Odesa's established status as \"capital of Soviet humor\", culminating in the annual Humoryna festival, carried out around the beginning of April.\nOdesa was also the home of the late Armenian painter Sarkis Ordyan (1918\u20132003), the Ukrainian painter Mickola Vorokhta and the Greek philologist, author and promoter of Demotic Greek Ioannis Psycharis (1854\u20131929). Yuri Siritsov, bass player of the Israeli Metal band PallaneX is originally from Odesa. Igor Glazer Production Manager Baruch Agadati (1895\u20131976), the Israeli classical ballet dancer, choreographer, painter, and film producer and director grew up in Odesa, as did Franco-Israeli \u00c9cole de Paris painter and sculptor Isaac Frenkel Frenel, Israeli artist and author Nachum Gutman (1898\u20131980). Israeli painter Avigdor Stematsky (1908\u201389) was born in Odesa.\nOdesa produced one of the founders of the Soviet violin school, Pyotr Stolyarsky. It has also produced many musicians, including the violinists Nathan Milstein, David Oistrakh and Igor Oistrakh, Boris Goldstein, Zakhar Bron and pianists Sviatoslav Richter, Benno Moiseiwitsch, Vladimir de Pachmann, Shura Cherkassky, Emil Gilels, Maria Grinberg, Simon Barere, Leo Podolsky and Yakov Zak. (Note: Richter studied in Odesa but was not born there.)\nThe Odesa International Film Festival is also held in this city annually since 2010.\nLiterature.\nPoet Anna Akhmatova was born in Bolshoy Fontan near Odesa, however her further work was not connected with the city and its literary tradition. Odesa has produced many writers, including Isaac Babel, whose series of short stories, Odessa Tales, are set in the city.\nEdmund de Waal's best selling memoire, \"The Hare with the Amber Eyes\" is the story of his family, the Ephrussi, once a great banking dynasty based in Odesa.\nOther Odesans are the duo Ilf and Petrov\u2014authors of \"The Twelve Chairs\", and Yuri Olesha, author of \"The Three Fat Men\". Vera Inber, a poet and writer, as well as the poet and journalist Margarita Aliger, were both born in Odesa. The Italian writer, Slavist and anti-fascist dissident Leone Ginzburg was born in Odesa into a Jewish family, and then went to Italy where he grew up and lived. The Hebrew author and poet Haim Bialik established a publishing house and worked in the city from the 1890s to 1911.\nOne of the most prominent pre-war Soviet writers, Valentin Kataev, was born here and began his writing career as early as high school (gymnasia). Before moving to Moscow in 1922, he made quite a few acquaintances here, including Yury Olesha and Ilya Ilf (Ilf's co-author Petrov was in fact Kataev's brother, Petrov being his pen-name). Kataev became a benefactor for these young authors, who would become some of the most talented and popular Russian writers of this period. In 1955 Kataev became the first chief editor of the \"Youth\" (), one of the leading literature magazines of the Ottepel of the 1950s and 1960s. \nThese authors and comedians played a great role in establishing the \"Odesa myth\" in the Soviet Union. Odesans were and are viewed in the ethnic stereotype as sharp-witted, street-wise and eternally optimistic. These qualities are reflected in the \"Odesa dialect\", which borrows chiefly from the characteristic speech of the Odesan Jews, and is enriched by a plethora of influences common for the port city.\nThe \"Odesite speech\" became a staple of the \"Soviet Jew\" depicted in a multitude of jokes and comedy acts, in which a Jewish adherent served as a wise and subtle dissenter and opportunist, always pursuing his own well-being, but unwittingly pointing out the flaws and absurdities of the Soviet regime. The Odesan Jew in the jokes always \"came out clean\" and was, in the end, a lovable character \u2013 unlike some of other jocular nation stereotypes such as The Chukcha, The Ukrainian, The Estonian or The American.\nResorts and health care.\nOdesa is a popular tourist destination, with many therapeutic resorts in and around the city. The city's Filatov Institute of Eye Diseases &amp; Tissue Therapy is one of the world's leading ophthalmology clinics.\nCelebrations and holidays.\nApril Fools' Day, held annually on 1 April, is one of the most celebrated festivals in the city. Practical joking is a central theme throughout, and Odesans dress in unique, colorful attire to express their spontaneous and comedic selves. The tradition has been celebrated since the early 1970s, when the humor of Ukraine's citizens were drawn to television and the media, further developing into a mass festival. Large amounts of money are made from the festivities, supporting Odesa's local entertainers and shops.\nEconomy.\nOdesa's economy largely stems from its traditional role as a port city. The nearly ice-free port lies near the mouths of the Dnieper, the Southern Bug, the Dniester and the Danube rivers, which provide good links to the hinterland.\nDuring the Soviet period (until 1991) the city functioned as the USSR's largest trading port; it continues in a similar role as independent Ukraine's busiest international port. The port complex contains an oil and gas transfer and storage facility, a cargo-handling area and a large passenger port. In 2007 the Port of Odesa handled 31,368,000 tonnes of cargo.\nThe port of Odesa is one of the Ukrainian Navy's most important bases on the Black Sea. Rail transport is an important sector of the economy in Odesa \u2013 largely due to the role it plays in delivering goods and imports to and from the city's port. The Container Terminal Odesa (CTO) in the port is the largest container terminal in Ukraine. It has been operated by the Hamburg-based HHLA Group since 2001 and, in addition to containers, also handles bulk goods, general cargo and project cargo. This means that Odesa is networked with the ports of Hamburg, Muuga and Trieste via the logistics group HHLA.\nIndustrial enterprises located in and around the city include those dedicated to fuel refinement, machine building, metallurgy, and other types of light industry such as food preparation, timber plants and chemical industry. Agriculture is a relatively important sector in the territories surrounding the city. The Seventh-Kilometer Market is a major commercial complex on the outskirts of the city where private traders now operate one of the largest market complexes in Eastern Europe. The market has roughly 6,000 traders and an estimated 150,000 customers per day.\nDaily sales, according to the Ukrainian periodical \"Dzerkalo Tyzhnia\", were believed to be as high as US$20 million in 2004. With a staff of 1,200 (mostly guards and janitors), the market is also the region's largest employer. It is owned by local land and agriculture tycoon Viktor A. Dobrianskyi and three partners of his. Tavria-V is the most popular retail chain in Odesa. Key areas of business include: retail, wholesale, catering, production, construction and development, private label. Consumer recognition is mainly attributed to the high level of service and the quality of services. Tavria-V is the biggest private company and the biggest tax payer.\nDeribasivska Street is one of the city's most important commercial streets, hosting many of the city's boutiques and higher-end shops. In addition to this there are a number of large commercial shopping centres in the city. The 19th-century shopping gallery Passage was, for a long time, the city's most upscale shopping district, and remains to this day[ [update]] an important landmark of Odesa.\nThe tourism sector is of great importance to Odesa, which is currently the second most-visited Ukrainian city. In 2003 this sector recorded a total revenue of \u20b4189.2 million. Other sectors of the city's economy include the banking sector: the city hosts a branch of the National Bank of Ukraine. Imexbank, one of Ukraine's largest commercial banks, was based in the city, however on 27 May 2015, the Deposit Guarantee Fund of Ukraine made a decision to liquidate the bank.\nForeign business ventures have thrived in the area, as since 1 January 2000, much of the city and its surrounding area has been declared a free economic zone \u2013 this has aided the foundation of foreign companies' and corporations' Ukrainian divisions and allowed them to more easily invest in the Ukrainian manufacturing and service sectors. To date a number of Japanese and Chinese companies, as well as a host of European enterprises, have invested in the development of the free economic zone, to this end private investors in the city have invested a great deal of money into the provision of quality office real estate and modern manufacturing facilities such as warehouses and plant complexes.\nOdesa also has a well-developed IT industry with large number of IT outsourcing companies and IT product startups. Among most famous startups is Looksery and AI Factory both developed in Odesa and acquired by Snap Inc.\nScientists.\nA number of scientists have lived and worked in Odesa. They include: Illya Mechnikov (Nobel Prize in Medicine 1908), Igor Tamm (Nobel Prize in Physics 1958), Selman Waksman (Nobel Prize in Medicine 1952), Dmitri Mendeleev, Nikolay Pirogov, Ivan Sechenov, Vladimir Filatov, Nikolay Umov, Leonid Mandelstam, Aleksandr Lyapunov, Mark Krein, Alexander Smakula, Waldemar Haffkine, Valentin Glushko, Israel Dostrovsky, Catherine Chami\u00e9, and George Gamow.\nTransport.\nMaritime transport.\nOdesa is a major maritime-transport hub that includes several ports including Port of Odesa, Port of Chornomorsk (ferry, freight), Pivdennyi (freight only). The Port of Odesa became a provisional headquarters for the Ukrainian Navy, following the Russian occupation of Crimea in 2014. Before the fall of the Soviet Union, the Port of Odesa harbored the major Soviet cruise line Black Sea Shipping Company.\nPassenger ships and ferries connect Odesa with Istanbul, Haifa and Varna, whilst river cruises can occasionally be booked for travel up the Dnieper River to cities such as Kherson, Dnipro and Kyiv.\nRoads and automotive transport.\nThe first car in the Russian Empire, a Mercedes-Benz belonging to V. Navrotsky, came to Odesa from France in 1891. He was a popular city publisher of the newspaper \"Odesskii listok\" (\"Odesa leaf\").\nOdesa is linked to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, by the M05 Highway, a high quality multi-lane road which is set to be re-designated, after further reconstructive works, as an 'Avtomagistral' (motorway) in the near future. Other routes of national significance, passing through Odesa, include the M16 Highway to Moldova, M15 to Izmail and Romania, and the M14 which runs from Odesa, through Mykolaiv and Kherson to Ukraine's eastern border with Russia. The M14 is of particular importance to Odesa's maritime and shipbuilding industries as it links the city with Ukraine's other large deep water port Mariupol which is located in the south east of the country.\nOdesa also has a well-developed system of inter-urban municipal roads and minor beltways. However, the city is still lacking an extra-urban bypass for transit traffic which does not wish to proceed through the city centre.\nIntercity bus services are available from Odesa to many cities in Russia (Moscow, Rostov-on-Don, Krasnodar, Pyatigorsk), Germany (Berlin, Hamburg and Munich), Greece (Thessaloniki and Athens), Bulgaria (Varna and Sofia) and several cities of Ukraine and Europe.\nRailways.\nOdesa is served by a number of railway stations and halts, the largest of which is Odesa Holovna (Main Station). From this station services connect Odesa with Warsaw, Prague, Bratislava, Vienna, Berlin, Moscow, St. Petersburg, the cities of Ukraine and many other cities of the former USSR. The city's first railway station was opened in the 1880s. During the Second World War, the iconic building of the main station, which had long been considered to be one of the Russian Empire's premier stations, was destroyed through enemy action.\nIn 1952 the station was rebuilt to the designs of A Chuprina. The current station, which is characterised by its many socialist-realist architectural details and grand scale, was renovated by the state railway operator Ukrainian Railways in 2006.\nPublic transport.\nIn 1881, Odesa became the first city in Imperial Russia to have steam tramway lines, an innovation that came only one year after the establishment of horse tramway services in 1880 operated by the \"Tramways d'Odessa\", a Belgian owned company. The first metre-gauge steam tramway line ran from Railway Station to Great Fontaine and the second one to Hadzhi Bey Liman. These routes were both operated by the same Belgian company. Electric tramway started to operate on 22 August 1907. Trams were imported from Germany.\nThe city's public transit system is currently made up of trams, trolleybuses, buses and fixed-route taxis (marshrutkas). Odesa also has a cable car to Vidrada Beach, and recreational ferry service. There are two routes of public transport which connect Odesa Airport with the city center: trolley-bus No.14 and marshrutka No.117.\nOne additional mode of transport in Odesa is the Potemkin Stairs funicular railway, which runs between the city's Primorsky Bulvar and the sea terminal, has been in service since 1902. In 1998, after many years of neglect, the city decided to raise funds for a replacement track and cars. This project was delayed on multiple occasions but was finally completed eight years later in 2005. The funicular has now become as much a part of historic Odesa as the staircase to which it runs parallel.\nAir transport.\nOdesa International Airport, which is located to the south-west of the city centre, is served by a number of airlines. The airport is also often used by citizens of neighbouring countries for whom Odesa is the nearest large city and who can travel visa-free to Ukraine.\nTransit flights from the Americas, Africa, Asia, Europe and the Middle East to Odesa are offered by Ukraine International Airlines through their hub at Kyiv's Boryspil International Airport.\nSport.\nThe most popular sport in Odesa is football. The main professional football club in the city is FC Chornomorets Odesa, who play in the Ukrainian Premier League. Chornomorets play their home games at the Chornomorets Stadium, an elite-class stadium which has a maximum capacity of 34,164. The second football team in Odesa is FC Real Pharma Odesa, another team dissolved in 2013 was FC Odesa.Basketball is also a prominent sport in Odesa, with BC Odesa representing the city in the Ukrainian Basketball League, the highest tier basketball league in Ukraine. Odesa will become one of five Ukrainian cities to host the 39th European Basketball Championship in 2015.\nAthletes.\nThe cyclist and aviator Sergei Utochkin was one of the most famous natives of Odesa in the years before the Russian Revolution. Chess player Efim Geller was born in the city. Gymnast Tatiana Gutsu (known as \"The Painted Bird of Odesa\") brought home Ukraine's first Olympic gold medal as an independent nation when she outscored the USA's Shannon Miller in the women's all-around event at 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain.\nFigure skaters Oksana Grishuk and Evgeny Platov won the 1994 and 1998 Olympic gold medals as well as the 1994, 1995, 1996, and 1997 World Championships in ice dance. Both were born and raised in the city, though they skated at first for the Soviet Union, in the Unified Team, the Commonwealth of Independent States, and then Russia. Hennadiy Avdyeyenko won a 1988 Olympic gold medal in the high jump, setting an Olympic record at .\nOther notable athletes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nOdesa is twinned with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPartner cities.\nOdesa cooperated with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Named after its chief congressional sponsors, Senator Reed Smoot and Representative Willis C. Hawley, the act raised tariffs on over 20,000 imported goods in an effort to shield American industries from foreign competition during the onset of the Great Depression, which had started in October 1929.\nHoover signed the bill against the advice of many senior economists, yielding to pressure from his party and business leaders. Intended to bolster domestic employment and manufacturing, the tariffs instead deepened the Depression because the U.S.'s trading partners retaliated with tariffs of their own, leading to U.S. exports and global trade plummeting. Economists and historians widely regard the act as a policy misstep, and it remains a cautionary example of protectionist policy in modern economic debates. It was followed by more liberal trade agreements, such as the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934.\nSponsors and legislative history.\nIn 1927, the League of Nations held a World Economic Conference in Geneva. Their final report concluded that \"the time has come to put an end to tariffs, and to move in the opposite direction\". Vast debts and reparations from World War I could be repaid only through gold, services, or goods, but the only items available on that scale were goods. Many of the governments represented by the delegates to the conference did the opposite. In 1928, France was the first, enacting a new tariff law and quota system.\nBy the late 1920s, the U.S. economy had made exceptional gains in productivity because of electrification, which was a critical factor in mass production. Further factors in economic growth were US oil refineries, replacing horses and mules with motor vehicles. One-sixth to one-quarter of farmland that had been devoted to feeding horses and mules was freed up, contributing to a surplus in farm produce. Nominal and real wages increased, but did not keep up with the productivity gains.\nSenator Smoot contended that raising the tariff on imports would alleviate the overproduction problem, but the market reality was that the United States had been running a trade account surplus. Although manufactured goods imports were rising, manufactured exports were rising even faster. Food exports had been falling and were in a trade account deficit, but the approximate values of food imports only amounted to half the value of manufactured imports.\nIn late 1929, as the global economy entered the first stages of the Great Depression, the main policy goal of the United States federal government was to protect its jobs and farmers from foreign competition. In 1929, Smoot championed another tariff increase within the United States, which became the Smoot\u2013Hawley Tariff Bill. In his memoirs, Smoot made it abundantly clear: \"The world is paying for its ruthless destruction of life and property in the World War and for its failure to adjust purchasing power to productive capacity during the Industrial Revolution of the decade following the war.\"\nSmoot was a Republican from Utah and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. Willis C. Hawley, a Republican from Oregon, was chairman of the House Committee on Ways and Means. During the 1928 United States presidential election, one of Herbert Hoover's campaign promises was to help beleaguered farmers by increasing tariffs on agricultural products. Hoover won, and Republicans maintained comfortable majorities in the House and the Senate in 1928.\nThe House passed a version of the act in May 1929, increasing tariffs on agricultural and industrial goods. The House bill passed on a vote of 264 to 147, with 244 Republicans and 20 Democrats voting in favor of the bill. The Senate debated its bill until March 1930, with many members trading votes based on industries in their states. The Senate bill passed on a vote of 44 to 42, with 39 Republicans and 5 Democrats voting in favor of the bill. The conference committee then unified the two versions, largely by raising tariffs to the higher levels passed by the House. The House passed the conference bill on a vote of 222 to 153, with the support of 208 Republicans and 14 Democrats.\nOpponents.\nIn May 1930, a petition was signed by 1,028 economists in the United States asking President Hoover to veto the legislation. The petition was organized by Paul Douglas, Irving Fisher, James T. F. G. Wood, Frank Graham, Ernest Patterson, Henry Seager, Frank Taussig, and Clair Wilcox. Automobile executive Henry Ford also spent an evening at the White House trying to convince Hoover to veto the bill, calling it \"an economic stupidity\". J. P. Morgan's Chief Executive Thomas W. Lamont said he \"almost went down on [his] knees to beg Herbert Hoover to veto the asinine Hawley\u2013Smoot tariff\".\nWhile Hoover joined the economists in opposing the bill, calling it \"vicious, extortionate, and obnoxious\" because he felt it would undermine the commitment he had pledged to international cooperation, he eventually signed the bill after he yielded to influence from his own political party (Republican), his Cabinet (who had threatened to resign), and other business leaders. After the bill became law, in retaliation, Canada and other countries raised their own tariffs on U.S. goods. Franklin D. Roosevelt spoke against the act during his successful campaign for president in 1932.\nRetaliation.\nMost of the decline in trade was due to a plunge in GDP in the U.S. and worldwide. Beyond that was an additional decline. Some countries protested and others also retaliated with trade restrictions and tariffs. American exports to the protesters fell by 18%, and exports to those which retaliated fell by 31%. Threats of retaliation by other countries began long before the bill was enacted into law in June 1930. As the House of Representatives passed it in May 1929, boycotts broke out, and foreign governments moved to increase rates against American products, although US rates could be increased or decreased by the Senate or by the conference committee.\nBy September 1929, Hoover's administration had received protest notes from 23 trading partners, but the threats of retaliatory actions were ignored. In May 1930, Canada, the most loyal trading partner for the U.S., took action by imposing new tariffs on 16 products which accounted altogether for approximately 30% of U.S. exports to Canada. Later, Canada forged closer economic links with the British Empire via the British Empire Economic Conference of 1932. Nations other than Canada that enacted retaliatory tariffs included Cuba, Mexico, France, Italy, Spain, Argentina, Australia, New Zealand, and Switzerland. France and Britain protested and developed new trading partners. Germany developed a system of trade via clearing. \nThe economic depression worsened for workers and farmers despite Smoot and Hawley's promises of prosperity from high tariffs. Consequently, Hawley lost re-nomination, while Smoot was one of 12 Republican senators who lost their seats in the 1932 elections, with the swing being the largest in Senate history, being equaled in 1958 and 1980.\nTariff levels.\nIn the two-volume series published by the U.S. Bureau of the Census, \"The Historical Statistics of the United States, Colonial Times to 1970, Bicentennial Edition\", tariff rates have been represented in two forms. The dutiable tariff rate peak of 1932 was 59.1%, second only to the 61.7% rate of 1830.\nHowever, 63% of all imports in 1933 were not taxed, which the dutiable tariff rate does not reflect. The free and dutiable rate in 1929 was 13.5% and peaked under Smoot\u2013Hawley in 1933 at 19.8%, one-third below the average 29.7% \"free and dutiable rate\" in the United States from 1821 to 1900. The average tariff rate, which was applied on dutiable imports, increased from 40.1% in 1929 to 59.1% in 1932 (+19%).\nAfter enactment.\nThe tariffs initially appeared to be a success; according to historian Robert Sobel, \"Factory payrolls, construction contracts, and industrial production all increased sharply.\" However, larger economic problems loomed in the guise of weak banks. When the Creditanstalt of Austria failed in 1931, the global deficiencies of the Smoot\u2013Hawley Tariff became apparent. \nU.S. imports decreased 66% from $4.4 billion (1929) to $1.5 billion (1933), and exports decreased 61% from $5.4 billion to $2.1 billion. US gross national product fell from $103.1 billion in 1929 to $75.8 billion in 1931 and bottomed out at $55.6 billion in 1933. Imports from Europe decreased from a 1929 high of $1.3 billion, to $390 million in 1932. U.S. exports to Europe decreased from $2.3 billion in 1929 to $784 million in 1932. Overall, world trade decreased by some 66% between 1929 and 1934.\nUnemployment was 8% in 1930 when the Smoot\u2013Hawley Act was passed but the new law failed to lower it. The rate jumped to 16% in 1931 and to 25% in 1932\u20131933. There is some contention about whether this can necessarily be attributed to the tariff. The Great Depression was already in motion before Smoot-Hawley, mainly due to financial instability, falling demand, and poor banking practices. However, the tariff worsened the crisis by shrinking global trade, hurting farmers, and reducing employment in export-dependent industries. Had it not passed, the Depression still would have occurred, but perhaps with less severity.\nIt was only during World War II, when \"the American economy expanded at an unprecedented rate\", that unemployment fell below 1930s levels. Imports in 1929 were only 4.2% of the U.S. GNP, and exports were only 5.0%. Monetarists, such as Milton Friedman, who emphasized the central role of the money supply in causing the depression, considered the Smoot\u2013Hawley Act to be only a minor cause of the Great Depression in the United States.\nEnd of tariffs.\nThe 1932 Democratic campaign platform pledged to lower tariffs. After winning the election, President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the now-Democratic Congress passed the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934. This act allowed the president to negotiate tariff reductions on a bilateral basis and treated such a tariff agreement as regular legislation, requiring only a majority, rather than as a treaty requiring a two-thirds vote. This was one of the core components of the trade negotiating framework that developed after World War II. \nAfter World War II, that understanding supported a push toward multilateral trading agreements that would prevent similar situations in the future. While the Bretton Woods Agreement of 1944 focused on foreign exchange and did not directly address tariffs, those involved wanted a similar framework for international trade. President Harry S. Truman launched this process in November 1945 with negotiations for the creation of a proposed International Trade Organization (ITO).\nAs it happened, separate negotiations on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) moved more quickly, with an agreement signed in October 1947. In the end, the United States never signed the ITO agreement. Adding a multilateral \"most-favored-nation\" component to that of reciprocity, the GATT served as a framework for the gradual reduction of tariffs over the subsequent half century. \nPostwar changes to the Smoot\u2013Hawley tariffs reflected a general tendency of the United States to reduce its tariff levels unilaterally while its trading partners retained their high levels. The American Tariff League Study of 1951 compared the free and dutiable tariff rates of 43 countries. It found that only seven nations had a lower tariff level than the United States (5.1%), and eleven nations had free and dutiable tariff rates higher than the Smoot\u2013Hawley peak of 19.8%, including the United Kingdom with 25.6%. The 43-country average was 14.4%, which was 0.9% higher than the U.S. level of 1929, demonstrating that few nations were reciprocating in reducing their levels, as the United States reduced its own.\nEnsuing political dialogue.\nIn 1993, in discussion leading up to the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), then-Vice President Al Gore mentioned the Smoot\u2013Hawley Tariff as a response to NAFTA objections voiced by Ross Perot during a debate they had on \"The Larry King Show\". He gave Perot a framed photograph of Smoot and Hawley shaking hands after passage of the act. \nIn April 2009, then-Representative Michele Bachmann made news when, during a speech, she referred incorrectly to the Smoot\u2013Hawley Tariff as \"the Hoot\u2013Smalley Act\", misattributed its signing to Franklin D. Roosevelt, and blamed him for the Great Depression. The act has been compared to the 2010 Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA), with Andrew Quinlan from the Center for Freedom and Prosperity calling FATCA \"the worst economic idea to come out of Congress since Smoot\u2013Hawley\". \nIn the second Trump administration.\nDuring his 2024 political campaign, Donald Trump pledged to institute similar tariffs. \nIn its annual forecast supplement for the global economy that was published in November 2024 ('Year Ahead' for 2025), \"The Economist\" observed that [in the wake of the Tariff Act] \"... global trade fell by two-thirds. It was so catastrophic for growth in America and around the world that legislators have not touched the issue since. 'Smoot-Hawley' became synonymous with disastrous policy making\". \nThe tariffs announced on April 2, 2025, which could raise tariff levels higher than the rates during the Smoot\u2013Hawley Tariffs, brought renewed attention to the Smoot\u2013Hawley Act.\nConvict-made goods.\nPrior to 2016, the Tariff Act provided that \"[a]ll goods, wares, articles, and merchandise mined, produced, or manufactured wholly or in part in any foreign country by convict labor or/and forced labor or/and indentured labor under penal sanctions shall not be entitled to entry at any of the ports of the United States\" with a specific exception known as the \"consumptive demand exception\", which allowed forced labor-based imports of goods where United States domestic production was not sufficient to meet consumer demand. The exception was removed under Wisconsin Representative Ron Kind's amendment bill, which was incorporated into the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 and signed by President Barack Obama in February 2016.\nIn popular culture.\nIn the 1986 film, \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\", Ben Stein, playing a high school economics teacher, references the tariff in a lecture to his students. \nThe tariff act is heavily featured in the 1989 book \"Dave Barry Slept Here: A Sort of History of the United States\" by author and columnist Dave Barry.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The act was passed by Congress on March 4, 1980, was signed by President Jimmy Carter on March 17, 1980, and became effective on April 1, 1980. This was the first comprehensive amendment of U.S. general immigration laws designed to face up to the realities of modern refugee situations by stating a clear-cut national policy and providing a flexible mechanism to meet the rapidly shifting developments of today's world policy. The main objectives of the act were to create a new, American definition of refugee based on the one created at the 1951 UN Convention and 1967 Protocol on the Status of Refugees; raise the limitation from 17,400 to 50,000 refugees admitted each fiscal year; provide emergency procedures for when that number exceeds 50,000; require annual consultation between Congress and the President on refugee admissions; and establish the Office of U.S. Coordinator for Refugee Affairs and the Office of Refugee Resettlement. Most importantly, it established explicit procedures on how to deal with refugees in the U.S. by creating a uniform and effective resettlement and absorption policy.\nPurpose.\nThe Act recognizes that it has been the historic policy of the United States to respond to the urgent needs of persons subject to persecution in their homelands and to provide assistance, asylum, and resettlement opportunities to admitted refugees. The goal of the Refugee Act was to create a uniform procedure with which to provide these opportunities to refugees.\nPolicy specifications.\nThe Act amended the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 by defining a refugee as any person who is outside his or her country of residence or nationality, or without nationality, and is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. This was necessary to guarantee the United States followed the definition used by the 1951 Refugee Convention. so that American law was in line with international law.\nThe annual admission of refugees is set to a 50,000 cap per fiscal year, but in an emergency situation, the President may change the number for a period of twelve months. The Attorney General is also granted power to admit additional refugees and grant asylum to current aliens, but all admissions must be reported to Congress and be limited to 5,000 people.\nThe Act created the position of U.S. Coordinator for Refugee Affairs who was initially responsible to the president for the development of overall US refugee admission and resettlement policy. However, the agency that now coordinates these issues is the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which falls within the division of Administration for Children and Families in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\nTitle IV of the Immigration and Nationality Act was amended here when the Act created the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is responsible for funding and administering federal programs for domestic resettlement and assistance to refugees. The office must make available resources for employment training and placement for refugees to be economically self-sufficient, provide opportunities for English language training, ensure cash assistance, and guarantee gender equality in all training and instruction. The Office must also create grants for these projects, consult with state and local governments about sponsorship and distribution of refugees, and develop a system to monitor the use of government funds using evaluations, auditing and data collection. To receive assistance for programs, the States must first explain how they plan to accomplish the goals of these programs, meet the director's standards, and submit a report at the end of each fiscal year.\nThe Secretary of State was authorized to take on the role from 1980 to 1981, and the new director worked with them to develop and implement programs for existing refugees and eventually took up the position from 1982 onward. The director must submit a congressional report at the end of each fiscal year to committees on the Judiciary of the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate. The reports should contain information on the geographic location, employment status, and problems of the refugees and also contain suggestions for alternative resettlement strategies. The Office was authorized $200,000,000 during 1980 and 1981, and that number is now decided at the beginning of each fiscal year based on the results received at the end of each year.\nHowever, not all states have resettlement programs; Wyoming has the distinction of being the only U.S. state that has never resettled refugees.\nHistory.\nIt was only after World War II that the United States began to differentiate the term \"refugee\" from \"immigrant\" and began creating policy that dealt specifically with refugees while working outside of immigration policy. Early action came in the form of the Displaced Persons Act of 1948, the Refugee Relief Act of 1953, and the Refugee-Escapee Act of 1957. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, which was later amended in 1965 to include policy for refugees on a case-by-case basis, was the first Act that consolidated U.S. immigration policy into one body of text.\nThe creation of the Refugee Act began with hearings by the United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Refugees and Border Security from 1965 to 1968, which recommended for Congress create a uniform system for refugees, but received little support. Edward Kennedy began writing to propose a bill to reform refugee policy in 1978 and first introduced the idea to the United States Senate in 1979. With his proposal, he hoped to address the need for a reformed policy that was not specifically designed for people from communist regimes in Eastern Europe or repressive governments in the Middle East, as it was in the past. At the time, there was an average of 200,000 refugees coming to the United States, most of which were Indochinese and Soviet Jews. The cost of resettlement was close to $4000, but most refugees eventually paid that amount in federal income taxes.\nThe House version of the bill did not have as easy a path as Kennedy's Senate bill, but ultimately both bills achieved synchronicity through a conference committee vote of 207 to 192 on March 4, 1980. One key element of the House bill, was a legislative veto if the president requested more than 50,000 refugee admissions, but this feature was removed from the final version that went to the conference report.\nMany Americans feared a floodgate scenario with a large and sudden increase of the refugee population, but the 50,000 cap would account for only 10% of immigration flow to the U.S. and would allow one refugee for every 4000 Americans, small numbers compared to those of countries like Canada, France, and Australia. The bill was adopted by the Senate by a unanimous vote on September 6, 1979, and it remained essentially intact until it was signed in 1980. However, not long after, the United States was hit with an influx of Cuban refugees as a result of the Cuban crisis, about 115,000 Cuban refugees arrived in Florida. This caused the administration to temporarily pause the use of the act. On April 14, 1980, President Carter signed an executive order for the emergency provisions of the Refugee Act to respond to an appeal on behalf of 12,000 Cubans in Havana. The United States welcomed 3,500 Cubans after partaking in international resettlement efforts. Eventually the Cuban refugee influx was significantly Controlled to the point where the United States was able to return to the practice of the Refugee Act.\nLegacy.\nIn 2020, HIAS commemorated the Refugee Act with the following statement:\"Fortieth birthdays are opportunities to celebrate one\u2019s hard-earned accomplishments and an opportunity to look ahead to what the future might bring. It is no different for the United States Refugee Act of 1980, the landmark piece of legislation that established the contemporary U.S. refugee resettlement program and asylum system. Nearly 40 years ago President Jimmy Carter signed the Act into law\u2013March 17, 1980. It is a good time to remember what this legislation has meant to our country.\"Between 1975 and 2023 (Sept. 30th), the United States accepted 3,552,558 refugees from every continent except Antarctica. Although there were years where the government accepted fewer than the 50,000 refugee-ceiling cap set by the 1980 Act, those often followed specific events. For example, 146,158 refugees were admitted in 1975, but certain states felt overwhelmed by the numbers, so admissions fell to 27,206 in 1976. Admissions also dropped from 69,886 in 2001 to 27,131 in 2002, ostensibly due to post-9/11 restrictionist policies. President George H.W. Bush had the highest number of admissions per year for a presidential term (just under 120,000) and the only president to \"lower\" the refugee ceiling was President Donald Trump during his first term.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "55551", "revid": "248739", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55551", "title": "Tariff", "text": "Goods import or export tax\nA tariff or import tax is a duty imposed by a national government, customs territory, or supranational union on imports of goods and is paid by the importer. Exceptionally, an export tax may be levied on exports of goods or raw materials and is paid by the exporter. Besides being a source of revenue, import duties can also be a form of regulation of foreign trade and policy that burden foreign products to encourage or safeguard domestic industry. Protective tariffs are among the most widely used instruments of protectionism, along with import quotas and export quotas and other non-tariff barriers to trade.\nTariffs can be fixed (a constant sum per unit of imported goods or a percentage of the price) or variable (the amount varies according to the price). Tariffs on imports are designed to raise the price of imported goods to discourage consumption. The intention is for citizens to buy local products instead, which, according to supporters, would stimulate their country's economy. Tariffs therefore provide an incentive to develop production and replace imports with domestic products. Tariffs are meant to reduce pressure from foreign competition and, according to supporters, would help reduce the trade deficit. They have historically been justified as a means to protect infant industries and to allow import substitution industrialisation (industrializing a nation by replacing imported goods with domestic production). Tariffs may also be used to rectify artificially low prices for certain imported goods, due to dumping, export subsidies or currency manipulation. The effect is to raise the price of the goods in the destination country.\nThere is near unanimous consensus among economists that tariffs are self-defeating and have a negative effect on economic growth and economic welfare, while free trade and the reduction of trade barriers has a positive effect on economic growth. American economist Milton Friedman said of tariffs: \"We call a tariff a protective measure. It does protect . . . It protects the consumer against low prices.\" Although trade liberalisation can sometimes result in unequally distributed losses and gains, and can, in the short run, cause economic dislocation of workers in import-competing sectors, the advantages of free trade are lowering costs of goods for both producers and consumers. The economic burden of tariffs falls on the importer, the exporter, and the consumer. Often intended to protect specific industries, tariffs can end up backfiring and harming the industries they were intended to protect through rising input costs and retaliatory tariffs. Import tariffs can also harm domestic exporters by disrupting their supply chains and raising their input costs.\nEtymology.\nThe English term \"tariff\" derives from the which is itself a descendant of the which derives from . This term was introduced to the Latin-speaking world through contact with the Turks and derives from the . The Ottoman Turkish term derives from which is the verbal noun of .\nHistory.\nAncient Greece.\nIn the city state of Athens, the port of Piraeus enforced a system of levies to raise taxes for the Athenian government. Grain was a key commodity that was imported through the port, and Piraeus was one of the main ports in the east Mediterranean. A levy of two percent was placed on goods arriving in the market through the docks of Piraeus. The Athenian government also placed restrictions on the lending of money and transport of grain to only be allowed through the port of Piraeus.\nBritain.\nIn the 14th century, Edward III took interventionist measures, such as banning the import of woollen cloth in an attempt to develop local manufacturing. Beginning in 1489, Henry VII took actions such as increasing export duties on raw wool. The Tudor monarchs, especially Henry VIII and Elizabeth I, used protectionism, subsidies, distribution of monopoly rights, government-sponsored industrial espionage and other means of government intervention to protect the wool industry.\nA protectionist turning point in British economic policy came in 1721, when policies to promote manufacturing industries were introduced by Robert Walpole. These included, for example, increased tariffs on imported foreign manufactured goods, export subsidies, reduced tariffs on imported raw materials used for manufactured goods and the abolition of export duties on most manufactured goods. Britain was thus among the first countries to pursue a strategy of large-scale infant-industry development. Outlining his policy, Walpole declared:Nothing contributes as much to the promotion of public welfare as the export of manufactured goods and the import of foreign raw materials.\nBritish protectionist policies continued over the next century, with Britain remained a highly protectionist country until the mid-19th century. By 1820, the UK's average tariff rate on manufactured imports was 45\u201355%. In 1815 the Corn Laws were enforced: tariffs and other trade restrictions on imported food and corn. The laws were designed to keep corn prices high to favour domestic farmers, and represented British mercantilism. The Corn Laws enhanced the profits and political power associated with land ownership. The laws raised food prices and the costs of living for the British public, and hampered the growth of other British economic sectors, such as manufacturing, by reducing the disposable income of the British public.\nIn 1846 the Corn Laws were repealed, so tariffs were significantly reduced. Economic historians see the repeal of the Corn Laws as a decisive shift towards free trade in Britain. According to a 2021 study, the repeal of the Corn Laws benefitted the bottom 90% of income earners in the United Kingdom economically, while causing income losses for the top 10% of income earners.\nIn the UK customs duties on many manufactured goods were also abolished. The Navigation Acts were abolished in 1849 when free traders won the public debate in the UK. But while free trade progressed in the UK, protectionism continued on the Continent. The UK unilaterally pursued free trade, even as most other large industrial powers retained protectionist policies. For example, the USA emerged from the Civil War even more explicitly protectionist than before, Germany under Bismarck rejected free trade, and the rest of Europe followed suit. Countries such as the Netherlands, Denmark, Portugal and Switzerland, and arguably Sweden and Belgium, had fully moved towards free trade prior to 1860.\nOn June 15, 1903, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 5th Marquess of Lansdowne, made a speech in the House of Lords in which he defended fiscal retaliation against countries that applied high tariffs and whose governments subsidised products sold in Britain (known as \"premium products\", later called \"dumping\"). The retaliation was to take the form of threats to impose duties in response to goods from that country. Liberal unionists had split from the liberals, who advocated free trade, and this speech marked a turning point in the group's slide toward protectionism. Lansdowne argued that the threat of retaliatory tariffs was similar to gaining respect in a room of gunmen by pointing a big gun (his exact words were \"a gun a little bigger than everyone else's\"). The \"Big Revolver\" became a slogan of the time, often used in speeches and cartoons.\nIn response to the Great Depression, Britain temporarily abandoned free trade in 1932. The country reintroduced large-scale tariffs.\nUnited States.\nAccording to Douglas Irwin, tariffs have historically served three main purposes: generating revenue for the federal government, restricting imports to protect domestic producers, and securing reciprocity through trade agreements that reduce barriers. The history of U.S. trade policy can be divided into three distinct eras, each characterized by the predominance of one goal. From 1790 to 1860, revenue considerations dominated, as import duties accounted for approximately 90% of federal government receipts. From 1861 to 1933, the growing reliance on domestic taxation shifted the focus of tariffs toward protecting domestic industries. From 1934 to 2016, the primary objective of trade policy became the negotiation of trade agreements with other countries. The three eras of U.S. tariff history were separated by two major shocks\u2014the Civil War and the Great Depression\u2014that realigned political power and shifted trade policy objectives.\nPolitical support by members of Congress often reflects the economic interests of producers rather than consumers, as producers tend to be better organized politically and employ many voting workers. Trade-related interests differ across industries, depending on whether they focus on exports or face import competition. In general, workers in export-oriented sectors favor lower tariffs, while those in import-competing industries support higher tariffs.\nBecause congressional representation is geographically based, regional economic interests tend to shape consistent voting patterns over time. For much of U.S. history, the primary division over trade policy has been along the North\u2013South axis. In the early 19th century, a manufacturing corridor developed in the Northeast, including textile production in New England and iron industries in Pennsylvania and Ohio, which often faced import competition. By contrast, the South specialized in agricultural exports such as cotton and tobacco.\nIn more recent times, representatives from the Rust Belt\u2014spanning from Upstate New York through the industrial Midwest\u2014have often opposed trade agreements, while those from the South and the West have generally supported them. The regional variation in trade-related interests implies that political parties may adopt opposing positions on trade policy when their electoral bases differ geographically. Each of the three trade policy eras\u2014focused respectively on revenue, restriction, and reciprocity\u2014occurred during periods of political dominance by a single party able to implement its preferred policies.\nColonial period.\nTrade policy was a subject of controversy even prior to the independence of the United States. The thirteen North American colonies were subject to the restrictive framework of the Navigation Acts, which directed most colonial trade through Britain. Approximately three-quarters of colonial exports were enumerated goods that had to pass through a British port before being reexported elsewhere, a policy that reduced the prices received by American planters.\nHistorians have debated whether British mercantilist policies harmed American colonial interests and fueled the American Revolution. Harper estimated that trade restrictions cost the colonies about 2.3% of their income in 1773, though this excluded benefits of empire, such as defense and lower shipping insurance. The economic burden of the Navigation Acts fell mostly on the southern colonies, especially tobacco planters in Maryland and Virginia, potentially reducing regional income by up to 2.5% and strengthening support for independence. American foreign trade declined sharply during the Revolutionary War and remained subdued into the 1780s. Trade revived during the 1790s but remained volatile due to ongoing military conflicts in Europe.\nRevenue period (1790\u20131860).\nBeginning in 1790, the newly established federal government adopted tariffs as its primary source of revenue. There was a consensus among the Founding Fathers that tariffs were the most efficient way of raising public funds as well as the most politically acceptable. Early sales taxes in the post-colonial period were highly controversial, difficult to enforce, and costly to administer. This was evident during events like the Whiskey Rebellion, where the enforcement of sales taxes led to significant resistance. Similarly, an income tax did not make sense for numerous reasons, particularly due to the complexities of tracking and collecting it. In contrast, tariffs were a simpler solution. Imports entered the United States primarily through a limited number of ports, such as Boston, New York City, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Charleston, South Carolina. This concentration of imports made it easier to impose taxes directly at these points, streamlining the process of collection. Furthermore, tariffs were less visible to the general public because they were built into the price of goods, reducing political resistance. The system allowed for efficient revenue generation without the immediate visibility or perceived burden of other tax forms, contributing to its political acceptability among the Founders.\nPresident Thomas Jefferson initiated a notable policy experiment by enacting a complete embargo on maritime commerce, with Congressional support, beginning in December 1807. The stated objective of the embargo was to protect American vessels and sailors from becoming entangled in the Anglo-French naval conflict (the Napoleonic Wars). By mid-1808, the United States had reached near-autarkic conditions, representing one of the most extreme peacetime interruptions of international trade in its history. The embargo, which remained in effect from December 1807 to March 1809, imposed significant economic costs. Irwin (2005) estimates that the static welfare loss associated with the embargo was approximately 5% of GDP.\nFrom 1837 to 1860, spanning the Second Party System and ending with the Civil War, the Democratic Party held political dominance in the United States. The Democrats drew support primarily from the export-oriented South and promoted the slogan \u201ca tariff for revenue only\u201d to express their opposition to protective tariffs. As a result, the average tariff declined from early 1830s levels to under 20% by 1860. During this period, there were 12 sessions of Congress: 7 under unified government (6 led by Democrats, 1 by Whigs) and 5 under divided control. This meant that over the 34-year span, the pro-tariff Whig Party, based in the North, held power for only two years. They succeeded in raising tariffs in 1842, but this was reversed in 1846 after Democrats returned to power. Throughout the 10 years of divided government, tariff policy remained unchanged.\nCivil War (1861\u20131865).\nSome non-academic commentators have argued that trade restrictions were a major factor in the South\u2019s decision to secede during the Civil War, although this view is not widely supported among academic historians. After the 1828 Tariff of Abominations, South Carolina threatened secession, but the crisis was resolved through the Compromise of 1833, which led to a steady decline in tariffs. Further reductions followed in 1846 and 1857, bringing the average tariff below 20% on the eve of the war\u2014one of the lowest levels in the antebellum period. Irwin notes that Southern Democrats had substantial influence over trade policy until the Civil War. He rejects the revisionist claim\u2014often associated with the Lost Cause narrative\u2014that the Morrill Tariff triggered the conflict. Instead, Irwin argues that the Morrill Tariff only passed because Southern states had already seceded and their representatives were no longer in Congress to oppose it. It was signed by President James Buchanan, a Democrat, before Lincoln took office. In short, Irwin finds no evidence that tariffs were a major cause of the Civil War.\nRestriction period (1866\u20131928).\nThe Civil War shifted political power from the South to the North, benefiting the Republican Party, which favored protective tariffs. As a result, trade policy focused more on restriction than revenue, and average tariffs increased. From 1861 to 1932, the Republicans dominated American politics and drew their political support from the North, where manufacturing interests were concentrated. Republicans supported high tariffs to limit imports, leading to rates rising to 40\u201350% during the Civil War and remaining at that level for several decades. During this time, there were 35 sessions of Congress, including 21 under unified government (17 Republican, 4 Democratic) and 14 under divided control. Over the span of 72 years, Democrats succeeded in reducing tariffs only twice, in 1894 and 1913, but both efforts were swiftly reversed when Republicans regained power. Although trade policy was often contested, it remained relatively stable due to prolonged one-party dominance and institutional barriers to change.\nAccording to Irwin, a common myth about U.S. trade policy is that high tariffs made the United States into a great industrial power in the late 19th century. As its share of global manufacturing powered from 23% in 1870 to 36% in 1913, the admittedly high tariffs of the time came with a cost, estimated at around 0.5% of GDP in the mid-1870s. In some industries, they might have sped up development by a few years. U.S. economic growth during its protectionist era was driven more by its abundant natural resources and openness to people and ideas, including large-scale immigration, foreign capital, and imported technologies. While tariffs on manufactured goods were high, the country remained open in other respects, and much of the economic growth occurred in services such as railroads and telecommunications rather than in manufacturing, which had already expanded significantly before the Civil War when tariffs were lower.\nGreat Depression and Smoot\u2013Hawley Tariff (1929\u20131933).\nThe Tariff Act of 1930, commonly known as the Smoot\u2013Hawley Tariff, is considered one of the most controversial tariff laws ever enacted by the United States Congress. The act raised the average tariff on dutiable imports from approximately 40% to 47%, though price deflation during the Great Depression caused the effective rate to rise to nearly 60% by 1932. The Smoot\u2013Hawley Tariff was implemented as the global economy was entering a severe downturn. The Great Depression of 1929\u20131933 represented an economic collapse for both the United States\u2014where real GDP declined by about 25% and unemployment exceeded 20%\u2014and much of the world. As international trade contracted, trade barriers multiplied, unemployment increased, and industrial output declined worldwide, leading many to attribute part of the global economic crisis to the Smoot\u2013Hawley Tariff. The extent to which this legislation contributed to the depth of the Great Depression has remained a subject of ongoing debate.\nIrwin argues that while the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act was not the primary cause of the Great Depression, it contributed to its severity by provoking international retaliation and reducing global trade. What mitigated the impact of Smoot-Hawley was the small size of the trade sector at the time. Only a third of total imports to the United States in 1930 were subject to duties, and those dutiable imports represented only 1.4 percent of GDP. According to Irwin, there is no evidence that the legislation achieved its goals of net job creation or economic recovery. Even from a Keynesian perspective, the policy was counterproductive, as the decline in exports exceeded the reduction in imports. While falling foreign incomes were a key factor in the collapse of U.S. exports, the tariff also limited foreign access to U.S. dollars, appreciating the currency and making American goods less competitive abroad. Irwin emphasizes that one of the most damaging consequences of the Act was the deterioration of the United States' trade relations with key partners. Enacted at a time when the League of Nations was seeking to implement a global \"tariff truce\", the Smoot-Hawley Tariff was widely perceived as a unilateral and hostile move, undermining international cooperation. In his assessment, the most significant long-term impact was that the resentment it generated encouraged other countries to form discriminatory trading blocs. These preferential arrangements, diverted trade away from the United States and hindered the global economic recovery.\nIn a November 2024 article, \"The Economist\" observed that the Act, \"which raised average tariffs on imports by around 20% and incited a tit-for-tat trade war, was devastatingly effective: global trade fell by two-thirds. It was so catastrophic global trade fell by two-thirds. It was so catastrophic for growth in America and around the world that legislators have not touched the issue since. 'Smoot-Hawley' became synonymous with disastrous policy making\".\nEconomist Paul Krugman argues that protectionism does not necessarily cause recessions, since a reduction in imports resulting from tariffs can have an expansionary effect that offsets the decline in exports. In his view, trade wars tend to reduce exports and imports symmetrically, with limited net impact on economic growth. He contends that the Smoot\u2013Hawley Tariff Act was not the cause of the Great Depression; instead, he sees the sharp decline in trade between 1929 and 1933 as a consequence of the Depression, with trade barriers representing a policy response rather than a trigger.\nEconomist Milton Friedman argued that while the tariffs of 1930 caused harm, they were not the main cause for the Great Depression. He placed greater blame on the lack of sufficient action on the part of the Federal Reserve. Peter Temin, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has agreed that the contractionary effect of the tariff was small. Other economists have contended that the record tariffs of the 1920s and early 1930s exacerbated the Great Depression in the U.S., in part because of retaliatory tariffs imposed by other countries on the United States.\nReciprocity period (1934\u20132016).\nThe Great Depression led to a political realignment following the Democratic victory in the 1932 election. This election ended decades of Republican dominance and initiated a period of Democratic control over the federal government that lasted from 1933 to 1993. The realignment shifted influence toward the party that prioritized export-oriented interests in the South. Consequently, the focus of trade policy moved from protectionism to reciprocity, and average tariff levels declined significantly. During this period, there were 30 sessions of Congress, with 16 under unified government (15 Democratic, 1 Republican) and 14 under divided government. Over these 60 years, the overarching goal of promoting reciprocal trade agreements remained largely unchanged, including during the two-year span (1953\u20131955) when Republicans held unified control.\nFollowing World War II, and in contrast to earlier periods, the Republican Party began supporting trade liberalization. From the early 1950s through the early 1990s, an unusual era of bipartisan consensus emerged, during which both parties generally aligned on trade policy. This occurred during the Cold War, when foreign policy concerns were prominent and partisan divisions were subdued (Bailey 2003).\nAfter the 1993 vote on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Democratic support for trade liberalization declined significantly. By that time, the two major parties had effectively reversed their positions on trade policy. This shift in party alignment primarily reflects changes in regional representation: the South transitioned from being a Democratic stronghold to a Republican one, while the Northeast became increasingly Democratic. As a result, regional views on trade policy remained largely consistent, but the parties came to represent different geographic constituencies.\nBasic economic analysis.\nEconomic analyses of tariffs generally find that tariffs distort the free market and increase prices of both foreign and domestic products. The welfare effects of tariffs on an importing country are usually negative, even if other countries do not retaliate, as the loss of foreign competition drives up prices for domestic goods by the amount of the tariff. The diagrams at right show the costs and benefits of imposing a tariff on a good in the domestic economy under the standard model of tariffs in a competitive economy. Because of its importance, simplicity, and widespread applicability, this microeconomic model of tariffs is usually taught in introductory (first-year) microeconomics courses.\nImposing an import tariff has the following effects, shown in the first diagram in a hypothetical domestic market for televisions:\nThe overall change in welfare = Change in Consumer Surplus + Change in Producer Surplus + Change in Government Revenue = (\u2212A\u2212B\u2212C\u2212D) + A + C = \u2212B\u2212D. The final state after imposition of the tariff has overall welfare reduced by the areas B and D. The losses to domestic consumers are greater than the combined benefits to domestic producers and government.\nTariffs are generally more inefficient than consumption taxes.\nOptimal tariff.\nFor economic efficiency, \"free trade\" is often the best policy, however levying a tariff is sometimes \"second best\".\nA tariff is called an optimal tariff if it is set to maximise the welfare of the country imposing the tariff. It is a tariff derived from the intersection between the \"trade indifference curve\" of that country and the offer curve of another country. In this case, the welfare of the other country grows worse simultaneously, thus the policy is a kind of \"beggar thy neighbor policy\". If the offer curve of the other country is a line through the origin point, the original country is in the \"condition of a small country\", so any tariff worsens the welfare of the original country.\nIt is possible to levy a tariff as a political policy choice, and to consider a theoretical optimum tariff rate. However, imposing an optimal tariff will often lead to the foreign country increasing their tariffs as well, leading to a loss of welfare in both countries. When countries impose tariffs on each other, they will reach a position off the contract curve, meaning that both countries' welfare could be increased by reducing tariffs.\nImpact.\nDomestic output, productivity and welfare.\nAn empirical study by Furceri et al. (2019) found that protectionist policies like raising tariffs significantly reduce domestic output and productivity. A study from 1999 by Frankel and Romer showed that, after accounting for other factors, countries with more trade tend to have higher growth and income. The effect is quantitatively large and statistically significant.\nThat tariffs overall reduce welfare is not controversial among economists. In a 2018 survey by the University of Chicago, about 40 top economists were asked whether new U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum would benefit Americans. Two-thirds strongly disagreed, and the rest simply disagreed. None agreed. Several explained that these tariffs would help a small number of Americans but harm many more. This is consistent with the basic economic analysis provided above, which shows that the costs to consumers are larger than the combined gains for domestic producers and the government, resulting in net losses known as deadweight loss.\nA 2021 study covering 151 countries from 1963 to 2014 found that raising tariffs leads to long-term drops in output and productivity, along with more unemployment and inequality. It also found that tariffs tend to push up the value of the currency, while trade balances stay largely unchanged.\nA 2025 study into the effect of tariffs ranging from 8 to 30 percent on over 170 steel products, imposed in 2002 by George W. Bush, showed that those tariffs created persistent negative employment effects in manufacturing industries that rely on steel as an input\u2014despite being removed after just 18 months.\nDeveloping countries.\nSome commentators note a correlation between protectionist (mercantilist) policies and strong economic growth in countries such as China, South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan. However, there is broad consensus among economists that free trade helps workers in developing countries, even if those countries have lower labor and environmental standards. This is because \"the growth of manufacturing\u2014and of the myriad other jobs that the new export sector creates\u2014has a ripple effect throughout the economy\" that creates competition among producers, lifting wages and living conditions.\nCaliendo, Feenstra, Romalis, and Taylor (2015) used a global economic model covering 189 countries and 15 industries to study the impact of lower tariffs from 1990 to 2010. They found that cutting tariffs increased trade, allowed more firms to start up, and raised overall welfare. Some countries, like India and Vietnam, might have gained even more from fully open trade or even import subsidies, meaning their \"optimal\" tariff could be negative.\nThe OECD (2005) simulated the effects of tariff reductions in 24 developing countries and showed that a well-designed combination of tariff cuts and tax reform (e.g., replacing lost tariff revenues with consumption taxes) can lead to net welfare gains.\nHowever, some studies point to possible negative effects. For instance, Topalova (2007) shows that tariff reductions in India during the 1990s were associated with slower progress in poverty reduction, particularly in areas lacking social safety nets and little labor mobility. She argues that policy changes that policymakers should implement complementary measures to ensure a fairer distribution of the gains from liberalization. In particular, reforms that enhance labor mobility, such as changes to labor market policies, can help mitigate the negative effects and reduce inequality.\nArguments used by proponents of tariffs.\nProtection of domestic industry.\nOne of the most common arguments for imposing tariffs is the protection of domestic industries that are struggling to survive against foreign competition. However, most economists, particularly those adhering to the theory of comparative advantage, argue that such industries should not be maintained through protection. Instead, the resources employed in these industries should be reallocated to sectors where the country has a comparative advantage, thereby increasing overall economic efficiency. According to this view, the gains in national welfare would outweigh the losses experienced by specific groups affected by import competition, resulting in higher real national income overall.\nEconomists also recognize, however, that the adjustment process\u2014moving labor and capital from less efficient to more efficient sectors\u2014can be slow and socially costly. As a result, while there is broad consensus against increasing tariffs, many economists support a gradual reduction of existing trade barriers rather than abrupt removal. This approach is seen as a way to avoid further misallocation of resources while minimizing disruption to affected workers and communities.\nInfant industry argument.\nProtectionists argue that emerging industries, especially in less-developed countries, may need temporary protection from established foreign competitors in order to develop and become competitive. Mainstream economists do acknowledge that tariffs can in the short-term help domestic industries to develop but this depends on the short-term nature of the protective tariffs and the ability of the government to pick the winners. In practice, tariffs often remain in place after the industry matures, and governments frequently fail to pick winners. Multiple empirical studies across different countries\u2014such as Turkey in the 1960s and several Latin American nations\u2014document failed attempts at infant industry protection. In many developing countries, industries have failed to attain international competitiveness even after 15 or 20 years of operation and might not survive if protective tariffs were removed. Moreover, economists argue that infant-industry protection can be harmful not only at the national level but also internationally. If multiple countries pursue such protection simultaneously, it can fragment global markets, preventing firms from achieving economies of scale through exports, and leading to inefficient, small-scale production across countries.\nUnemployment.\nTariffs are sometimes proposed as a means to protect domestic employment during economic downturns. However, there is near-unanimous agreement among modern economists that this approach is misguided. Tariffs may shift unemployment abroad without increasing overall output and often provoke retaliatory measures. Economists generally agree that unemployment is more effectively addressed through appropriate fiscal and monetary policies.\nNational defense.\nIndustries often invoke national security to justify tariff protection, arguing that certain products are essential in times of war when imports may be disrupted. Economists generally consider this a weak argument, noting that tariffs are an inefficient way to ensure the survival of critical industries. Instead, they recommend direct subsidies as a more transparent and effective means of supporting sectors deemed vital for national defense.\nAutarky.\nSome protectionist arguments are rooted in autarkic sentiment\u2014the desire for national self-sufficiency and independence from global economic risks. However, there is general agreement that no modern nation, regardless of how rich and varied its resources, could really practice self-sufficiency, and attempts in that direction could produce sharp drops in real income.\nTrade deficits.\nAccording to some proponents of tariffs, trade deficits are seen as inherently harmful and in need of removal, a view many economists rejected as a flawed understanding of trade. The notion that bilateral trade deficits are per se detrimental to the respective national economies is overwhelmingly rejected by trade experts and economists.\nAccording to proponents tariffs can help reduce trade deficits, but according to economists tariffs do not determine the size of trade deficits and trade balances are driven by consumption. Rather, it is that a strong economy creates rich consumers who in turn create the demand for imports. Industries protected by tariffs expand their domestic market share but an additional effect is that their need to be efficient and cost-effective is reduced. This cost is imposed on (domestic) purchasers of the products of those industries, a cost that is eventually passed on to the end consumer. Finally, other countries must be expected to retaliate by imposing countervailing tariffs, a lose-lose situation that would lead to increased world-wide inflation.\nProtection against environmental dumping.\nSome argue in favor of tariffs in cases of environmental dumping, where companies benefit from weaker environmental regulations than in other countries, leading to unfair competition. For example, the European Union starts its carbon border-adjustment mechanism in 2026 to level the playing field with firms not subject to European carbon pricing. In 2019, more than 3,500 U.S. economists, including 45 Nobel laureates and former Federal Reserve chairmen, signed the \"Economists' Statement on Carbon Dividends.\" This statement advocates for a border carbon adjustment system that will prevent carbon leakage and enhance the competitiveness of American firms that are more energy-efficient than their foreign competitors.\nModern tariff practices.\nRussia.\nThe Russian Federation adopted more protectionist trade measures in 2013 than any other country, making it the world leader in protectionism. It alone introduced 20% of protectionist measures worldwide and one-third of measures in the G20 countries. Russia's protectionist policies include tariff measures, import restrictions, sanitary measures, and direct subsidies to local companies. For example, the government supported several economic sectors such as agriculture, space, automotive, electronics, chemistry, and energy.\nIndia.\nFrom 2017, as part of the promotion of its \"Make in India\" programme to stimulate and protect domestic manufacturing industry and to combat current account deficits, India has introduced tariffs on several electronic products and \"non-essential items\". This concerns items imported from countries such as China and South Korea. For example, India's national solar energy programme favours domestic producers by requiring the use of Indian-made solar cells.\nArmenia.\nArmenia established its customs service in 1992 after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Since joining the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) in 2015, it has benefited from mostly tariff-free trade within the Eurasian Customs Union, while applying more import tariffs on goods from outside. Armenia does not impose export taxes, nor does it declare temporary import duties or credits on government or international assistance imports.\nUpon joining Eurasian Economic Union in 2015, led by Russians, Armenia set tariffs at 0\u201310%, rising over time, especially on agricultural goods. It committed to adopt the EAEU's common tariff schedule, but until 2022, it was allowed to apply non-EAEU rates to certain goods, including meat, dairy, cereals, oils, and some processed foods. EAEU membership requires Armenia to follow stricter EAEU (largely Russian) standards, including sanitary and phytosanitary measures. It has ceded control over much of its trade regime, and rising tariffs offer more protection to domestic industries. Armenian goods must comply with EAEU standards as transition periods expire.\nArmenia joined the WTO in 2003, gaining Most Favored Nation (MFN) status. Its average tariff rate of 2.7% is among the lowest in the WTO. It is also a member of the World Customs Organization, using a harmonized tariff classification system.\nSwitzerland.\nIn 2024, Switzerland abolished tariffs on industrial products imported into the country. Using 2016 trade figures, the Swiss government estimated the move could have economic benefits of 860 million CHF per year.\nUnited States.\nTariffs during the first presidency of Donald Trump involved protectionist trade initiatives against other countries, most notably against China. In January 2018, Trump imposed tariffs on solar panels and washing machines of 30\u201350%. In March 2018, he imposed tariffs on steel (25%) and aluminum (10%) from most countries, which, according to Morgan Stanley, covered an estimated 4.1% of U.S. imports. In June 2018, this was extended to the European Union, Canada, and Mexico. The Trump administration separately set and escalated tariffs on goods imported from China, leading to a trade war.\nIn April 2025, President Donald Trump announced a substantial increase in tariffs and a 10% base tariff on all imported products, resulting in the US trade-weighted average tariff rising from 2% to an estimated 24%, the highest level in over a century, including under the Smoot\u2013Hawley Tariff Act of 1930.\nPolitical analysis.\nThe tariff has been used as a political tool to establish an independent nation; for example, the United States Tariff Act of 1789, signed specifically on July 4, was called the \"Second Declaration of Independence\" by newspapers because it was intended to be the economic means to achieve the political goal of a sovereign and independent United States.\nThe political impact of tariffs is judged depending on the political perspective; for example, the 2002 United States steel tariff imposed a 30% tariff on a variety of imported steel products for a period of three years and American steel producers supported the tariff.\nTariffs can emerge as a political issue prior to an election. The Nullification Crisis of 1832 arose from the passage of a new tariff by the United States Congress, a few months before that year's federal elections; the state of South Carolina was outraged by the new tariff, and civil war nearly resulted. In the leadup to the 2007 Australian Federal election, the Australian Labor Party announced it would undertake a review of Australian car tariffs if elected. The Liberal Party made a similar commitment, while independent candidate Nick Xenophon announced his intention to introduce tariff-based legislation as \"a matter of urgency\".\nUnpopular tariffs are known to have ignited social unrest, for example the 1905 meat riots in Chile that developed in protest against tariffs applied to the cattle imports from Argentina.\nAdditional information on tariffs.\nCalculation of customs duty.\nCustoms duty is calculated on the determination of the 'assess-able value' in case of those items for which the duty is levied . This is often the transaction value unless a customs officer determines assess-able value in accordance with the Harmonized System.\nHarmonized System of Nomenclature.\nFor the purpose of assessment of customs duty, products are given an identification code that has come to be known as the Harmonized System code. This code was developed by the World Customs Organization based in Brussels. A 'Harmonized System' code may be from four to ten digits. For example, 17.03 is the HS code for \"molasses from the extraction or refining of sugar\". However, within 17.03, the number 17.03.90 stands for \"Molasses (Excluding Cane Molasses)\".\nCustoms authority.\nThe national customs authority in each country is responsible for collecting taxes on the import into or export of goods out of the country.\nEvasion.\nEvasion of customs duties takes place mainly in two ways. In one, the trader under-declares the value so that the assessable value is lower than actual. In a similar vein, a trader can evade customs duty by understatement of quantity or volume of the product of trade. A trader may also evade duty by misrepresenting traded goods, categorizing goods as items which attract lower customs duties. The evasion of customs duty may take place with or without the collaboration of customs officials.\nDuty-free goods.\nMany countries allow a traveller to bring goods into the country duty-free. These goods may be bought at ports and airports or sometimes within one country without attracting the usual government taxes and then brought into another country duty-free. Some countries specify 'duty-free allowances' which limit the number or value of duty-free items that one person can bring into the country. These restrictions often apply to tobacco, wine, spirits, cosmetics, gifts and souvenirs.\nDeferment of tariffs and duties.\nProducts may sometimes be imported into a free economic zone (or 'free port'), processed there, then re-exported without being subject to tariffs or duties. According to the 1999 Revised Kyoto Convention, a \"'free zone' means a part of the territory of a contracting party where any goods introduced are generally regarded, insofar as import duties and taxes are concerned, as being outside the customs territory\".\nDigital goods and services.\nDigital goods and services generally do not pass through customs, making monitoring and application of tariffs more difficult. Non-tariff barriers to trade of services can be higher than tariffs on goods.\nExport taxes.\nExport taxes have historically been commonplace in developing countries. In recent decades, export taxes have become a rarity. By 2025, Argentina was one of few countries with export taxes.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In the past, the country's economic policy had been defined by the Employment Act of 1946, which encouraged the federal government to pursue \"maximum employment, production, and purchasing power\" by cooperation with private enterprise. Some Representatives, dissatisfied with the vague wording of this act, sought to create an amendment that would strengthen and clarify the country's economic policy.\nThe Act's sponsors embraced a form of Keynesian economics, advocating public intervention to increase economic demand and to secure full employment. Economists in the Carter administration, in particular the Council of Economic Advisers, pushed for an inflation target in the bill. The economists made references to the Phillips curve, arguing that there was a trade-off between unemployment and inflation.\nConsistent with Keynesian theory, the Act provides for measures to create public jobs to reduce unemployment, as applied during the Great Depression.\nThe Act also encouraged the government to develop a sound monetary policy, to minimize inflation, and to push toward full employment by managing the amount and liquidity of currency in circulation.\nOverall, the Act sought to formalize and expand Congress's role in the economic policy process, as governed by the Federal Reserve and the President.\nOverview.\nIn response to rising unemployment levels in the 1970s, Representative Augustus Hawkins and Senator Hubert Humphrey created the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act. It was signed into law by President Jimmy Carter on October 27, 1978, and codified as 15 USC \u00a7 3101. The Act explicitly instructs the nation to strive toward four ultimate goals: full employment, growth in production, price stability, and balance of trade and budget. By explicitly setting requirements and goals for the federal government to attain, the Act is markedly stronger than its predecessor (an alternate view is that the 1946 Act concentrated on employment, and Humphrey\u2013Hawkins, by specifying four competing and possibly inconsistent goals, de-emphasized full employment as the sole primary national economic goal). In brief, the Act:\nThe Act set specific numerical goals for the President to attain. By 1983, unemployment rates should be not more than 3% for persons aged 20 or over and not more than 4% for persons aged 16 or over, and inflation rates should not be over 4%. By 1988, inflation rates should be 0%. The Act allows Congress to revise these goals over time. (As of 2017 the Federal Reserve has had a target inflation rate of 2%, not 0%. 0% inflation is not considered ideal and can lead to deflation which can hurt the economy.)\nIf private enterprise appeared not to be meeting these goals, the Act in its original form, though not in its ultimate iteration, expressly allowed the federal government to create a \"reservoir of public employment,\" provided of course that the legislation to establish the \"reservoir\" managed to become ratified. These jobs would have been required to be in the lower ranges of skill and pay to minimize competition with the private sector.\nThe Act directly prohibits discrimination on account of sex, religion, race, age, and national origin in any program created under the Act.\nAmendments.\nThe language of the Act was amended twice by riders, attached to unrelated or distantly related legislation.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is typically a graphic design showing a long bar labelled with dates paralleling it, and usually contemporaneous events.\nTimelines can use any suitable scale representing time, suiting the subject and data; many use a linear scale, in which a unit of distance is equal to a set amount of time. This timescale is dependent on the events in the timeline. A timeline of evolution can be over millions of years, whereas a timeline for the day of the September 11 attacks can take place over minutes, and that of an explosion over milliseconds. While many timelines use a linear timescale\u2014especially where very large or small timespans are relevant -- logarithmic timelines entail a logarithmic scale of time; some \"hurry up and wait\" chronologies are depicted with zoom lens metaphors.\nMore usually, \"timeline\" refers merely to a data set which could be displayed as described above. For example, this meaning is used in the titles of many Wikipedia articles starting \"Timeline of ...\"\nHistory.\nTime and space are variously intertwined concepts. The line is ubiquitous in clocks in the form of a circle, time is spoken of in terms of length, intervals, a before and an after. The idea of orderly, segmented time is also represented in almanacs, calendars, charts, graphs, genealogical and evolutionary trees, where the line is central.\nOriginally, chronological events were arranged in a mostly textual form. This took form in annals, like king lists. Alongside them, the table was used like in the Greek tables of Olympiads and Roman lists of consuls and triumphs. Annals had little narrative and noted what happened to people, making no distinction between natural and human actions.\nIn Europe, from the 4th century, the dominant chronological notation was the table. This can be partially credited to Eusebius, who laid out the relations between Jewish, pagan, and Christian histories in parallel columns, culminating in the Roman Empire, according to the Christian view when Christ was born to spread salvation as far as possible. His work was widely copied and was among the first printed books. This served the idea of Christian world history and providential time. The table is easy to produce, append, and read with indices, so it also fit the Renaissance scholars' absorption of a wide variety of sources with its focus on commonalities. These uses made the table with years in one column and places of events (kingdoms) on the top the dominant visual structure of time.\nBy the 17th century, chronology and geography became the two sources of precise information for European early modern historians. In geography, Renaissance mapmakers updated Ptolemy's maps and the map became a symbol of the power of monarchs, and knowledge. Likewise, the idea that a singular chronology of world history from contemporary sources is possible affected historians. The want for precision in chronology gave rise to historical eclipses in tables, like in the case of Gerardus Mercator. Various graphical experiments emerged, from fitting the whole of history on a calendar year to series of historical drawings, in the hopes of making a metaphorical map of time. Developments in printing and engraving that made practical larger and more detailed book illustrations allowed these changes, but in the 17th century, the table with some modifications continued to dominate.\nThe modern timeline emerged in Joseph Priestley's \"A Chart of Biography\", published in 1765. It presented dates simply and provided an analogue for the concept of historical progress that was becoming popular in the 18th century. However, as Priestley recognized, history is not totally linear. The table has the advantage in that it can present many of these intersections and branching paths.\u00a0For Priestley, its main use was a \"mechanical help to the knowledge of history\", not as an image of history. Regardless, the timeline had become very popular during the 18th and 19th centuries. Positivism emerged in the 19th century and the development of chronophotography and tree ring analysis made visible time taking place at various speeds. This encouraged people to think that events might be truly objectively recorded.\nHowever, in some cases, filling in a timeline with more data only pushed it towards impracticality. Jacques Barbeu-Duborg's 1753 \"Chronologie Universelle\" was mounted on a 54-feet-long (16\u00bd m) scroll. Charles Joseph Minard's 1869 thematic map of casualties of the French army in its Russian campaign put much less focus on the one-directional line. Charles Renouvier's 1876 \"Uchronie\", a branching map of the history of Europe, depicted both the actual course of history and counterfactual paths. At the end of the 19th century, Henri Bergson declared the metaphor of the timeline to be deceiving in \"Time and Free Will\". The question of big history and deep time engendered estranging forms of the timeline, like in Olaf Stapledon's 1930 work \"Last and First Men\" where timelines are drawn on scales from the historical to the cosmological. Similar techniques are used by the Long Now Foundation, and the difficulties of chronological representation have been presented by visual artists including Francis Picabia, On Kawara, J. J. Grandville, and Saul Steinberg.\nTypes.\nThere are different types of timelines:\nThere are many methods to visualize timelines. Historically, timelines were static images and were generally drawn or printed on paper. Timelines relied heavily on graphic design, and the ability of the artist to visualize the data.\nUses.\nTimelines are often used in education to help students and researchers with understanding the order or chronology of historical events and trends for a subject. To show time on a specific scale on an axis, a timeline can visualize time lapses between events, durations (such as lifetimes or wars), and the simultaneity or the overlap of spans and events.\nIn historical studies.\nTimelines are particularly useful for studying history, as they convey a sense of change over time. Wars and social movements are often shown as timelines. Timelines are also useful for biographies. Examples include:\nIn natural sciences.\nTimelines are also used in the natural world and sciences, such as in astronomy, biology, chemistry, and geology:\nIn project management.\nAnother type of timeline is used for project management. Timelines help team members know what milestones need to be achieved and under what time schedule. An example is establishing a project timeline in the implementation phase of the life cycle of a computer system.\nSoftware.\nTimelines (no longer constrained by previous space and functional limitations) are now digital and interactive, generally created with computer software. Microsoft Encarta encyclopedia provided one of the earliest multimedia timelines intended for students and the general public. ChronoZoom is another example of interactive timeline software.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It had three purposes: to support government, to protect manufacturing industries developing in the nation, and to raise revenue for the federal debt. It was sponsored by Congressman James Madison, passed by the 1st United States Congress, and signed into law by President George Washington. The act levied a 50\u00a2 per ton duty on goods imported by foreign ships, a 30\u00a2 per ton duty on American made ships owned by foreign entities, and a 6\u00a2 per ton duty on American-owned vessels. \nIn the aftermath of the American Revolution, the weak Congress of the Confederation had been unable to impose a tariff or reach reciprocal trade agreements with most European powers, creating a situation in which the country was unable to prevent a flood of European goods which were damaging domestic manufacturers even while Britain and other countries placed high duties on U.S. goods. The country also faced major debts left over from the Revolutionary War, and needed new sources of funding to maintain financial solvency. One of the major powers granted under the new Constitution was the ability to levy tariffs, and after the 1st Congress was seated, passage of a tariff bill became one of the most pressing issues.\nThe debates over the purpose of the tariff exposed the sectional interests at stake: Northern manufacturers favored high duties to protect industry; Southern planters desired a low tariff that would foster cheap consumer imports. Ultimately, Madison navigated the tariff to passage, but he was unable to include a provision in the final bill that would have discriminated against British imports. After passing both houses of Congress, President Washington signed the act in law on July 6, 1789 when they used it to pay off the US war debt.\nEconomic conditions prior to passage.\nThe American Revolution was followed by an economic reorganization, which carried in its wake a period of uncertainty and hard times. During the conflict, labor and investment had been diverted from agriculture and legitimate trade to manufacturing and privateers. Men had gone into occupations that ceased with the end of the war. Lowered prices, resulting from the cessation of war demands, in combination with the importation of the cheaper goods of Europe, were fast ruining such infant manufacturing concerns as had sprung up during the war, some of which were at a comparative disadvantage with the resumption of normal foreign trading relations.\nAnother factor which made the situation even more distressing was the British Navigation Acts. The only clause in the 1783 Paris peace treaty concerning commerce was a stipulation guaranteeing that the navigation of the Mississippi would be forever free to the United States. John Jay had tried to secure some reciprocal trade provisions with Great Britain but without result. William Pitt, in 1783, introduced a bill into the British Parliament providing for free trade between the United States and the British colonies, but instead of passing the bill, Parliament enacted the British Navigation Act 1783, which admitted only British built and manned ships to the ports of the West Indies, and imposed heavy tonnage dues upon American ships in other British ports. It was amplified in 1786 by another act designed to prevent the fraudulent registration of American vessels and by still another in 1787, which prohibited the importation of American goods by way of foreign islands. The favorable features of the old Navigation Acts that had granted bounties and reserved the English markets in certain cases to colonial products were gone; the unfavorable ones were left. The British market was further curtailed by the depression there after 1783. Although the French treaty of 1778 had promised \"perfect equality and reciprocity\" in commercial relations, it was found impossible to make a commercial treaty on that basis. Spain demanded, as the price for reciprocal trading relations, a surrender by the United States for 25 years the right of navigating the Mississippi, a price that the New England merchants would have been glad to pay.\nFrance (1778) and the Netherlands (1782) made treaties but not on even terms; Portugal refused all advances. Only Sweden (1783) and Prussia (1785) made treaties guaranteeing reciprocal commercial privileges.\nThe weakness of the Continental Congress under the Articles of Confederation prevented retaliation by the central government. Congress repeatedly asked for power to regulate commerce, but was refused by the states upon which rested the execution of such commercial treaties as Congress might negotiate. Eventually, the states themselves attempted retaliatory measures, and from 1783 to 1788, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia levied tonnage dues upon British vessels or discriminating tariffs upon British goods. Whatever effect these efforts might have had were neutralized by the fact that the duties varied 0% to 100%, which simply drove British ships to the free or cheapest ports to flood the market with their goods. Commercial war between the states followed and turned futility into chaos.\nAdoption of the Constitution meant the elimination of many of the economic ills under which industry and commerce had struggled since the war. A reorganization was essential and the immediate economic results were salutary. Its most important additions to the power of Congress were those relating to finance and commerce: it enabled the federal government to levy taxes, regulate trade, coin money, protect industry, and direct the settlement of the West, and, as later events proved, to establish credit and redeem its securities. Under it, freedom of trade was ensured throughout the young republic.\nIn the months leading up to the passage of the Tariff Act, Congress received several petitions from different cities representing manufacturing groups asking for relief from the flood of European imported goods.\nThe United States Congress answered the petitions of these groups for urgent attention, by making the Tariff of 1789 the first major bill to be considered in its first session and passed.\nImport duty legislation and American sectional interests.\nThe import fees \"represented a compromise between the advocates of a high protective tariff and those who favored a tariff for revenue only [to maintain the central government].\" Charges up to fifty percent were imposed on selected manufactured and agricultural goods, including \"steel, ships, cordage, tobacco, salt, indigo [and] cloth.\" On the majority of items subject to duty, a five percent fee was levied, \"ad valorem\". Molasses, an indispensable ingredient for Northeastern rum producers, was lowered from 6\u00a2 per gallon to 2.5\u00a2. \nJames Madison modified the terms of the tariff to balance sectional conflicts but conceded that articles subject to high duties \"were pretty generally taxed for the benefit of the manufacturing part of the northern community.\" He acknowledged the South, the main wealth-producing part of the nation, would inevitably \"shoulder a disproportionate share of the financial burden involved in the transforming the United States into a commercial, manufacturing, and maritime power.\"\nTonnage duty legislation and US foreign relations with European powers.\nIn its final form, the tariff erected \"an American navigation system,\" superseding the individual state sanctioned fees designed to protect domestic shipping during the Articles of Confederation period from 1781 to 1789.\nThe act established tonnage rates favorable to American carriers by charging them lower cargo fees than those imposed on foreign boats importing similar goods. Coastal trade was reserved exclusively for American flag vessels. These provisions were consistent with mercantilist policies practice by European powers at the time.\nDating from the Treaty of Paris, ending the War for Independence in 1783, Great Britain had declined to seek a commercial treaty with the United States. In addition, provisions of the treaty had gone unfulfilled, including compensation to slaveholders for slaves emancipated by the British Navy during the War and the failure to abandon military posts in the Northwest Territory. Still, Great Britain remained the dominant trading partner for the United States, the countries reverting to an essentially colonial-era trade relationship. \nRepresentative James Madison, presiding over the tariff debates in Congress, attempted to introduce discriminatory provisions into the tonnage legislation that would favor France and its colonial possessions and shift American trade away from Great Britain.\nTo effect this, Madison called for a 60\u00a2 per ton fee upon foreign carriers lacking a commercial agreement with the United States, while France, which possessed a treaty, would be charged tonnage at 30\u00a2. This measure alone \"was equivalent to levying economic war\" upon Great Britain.\nMadison's proposals were intended to unify politically the agricultural and manufacturing interests in support of that commercial realignment at the national level, damaging to Great Britain and beneficial to revolutionary France.\nMany representatives of northern business were wary of abandoning Great Britain as their primary trading partner and merchant marine and questioned whether France could ever act \"as the principle supplier and market for the United States.\"\nThe House of Representatives, nevertheless, initially passed Madison's \"controversial\" legislation, with the discriminatory provision intact. The Senate, however, removed it from the bill and sent it back to the House, where it was passed, without amendment, 31 to 19, on July 4, 1789. President Washington signed the act into law on July 4, 1789. The final bill extracted concessions from both interests, but delivered a distinct advantage to maritime and manufacturing regions of the country.\nThe Tariff of 1789 placed France and Great Britain on an equal footing with regard to shipping, manufactures, and raw products delivered to American ports. All foreign-owned or foreign-built ships paid 50\u00a2 per ton duty; American-owned vessels were charged 6\u00a2 per ton.\nTo enable the federal government to collect the import duties, Congress also passed the Collection Act of 1789, which established the United States Customs Service and designated ports of entry. The tariffs established by this and later acts would make up the vast majority of government revenue; more than 87 percent of the federal government's revenue between 1789 and 1800 came from import duties. The tariff would continue to make up the bulk of federal revenue until the 20th century.\nPolitical and sectional responses to the tariff.\nMadison's attempt to enlist northern merchants and businessmen in supporting an economic contest with Great Britain elicited a cool response. Firstly, British capital and markets contributed to the general prosperity of the North, and secondly, a shift towards France would mean aligning the United States with a revolutionary government that exhibited what Federalist leadership regarded as \"an excess of democracy.\" \nAlexander Hamilton, soon to enter the executive branch as Secretary of the Treasury, declined to support Madison's proposal and warned that economic warfare with Great Britain would drastically reduce the import duty revenue that the tariff legislation called for, placing at risk the funds anticipated to run the new federal government and finance the national debt.\nThis dispute between Madison and Hamilton marked \"the first important breach\" between these two Federalist leaders, which would deepen when Hamilton, as Treasury Secretary, launched his fiscal and economic programs, ending their long collaboration. The legislation produced the first sectional strains within \"the Federalist coalition of northern businessmen and southern planters.\" In the South, \"agricultural interests\" viewed the high tariff and tonnage rates as a triumph for northern merchants and manufacturers, the burden of which fell on southern staple crop exporters.\nThis early application of constitutional authority highlighted north-south social and economic differences and presaged the dissolution of the Federalist coalition, the formation of an agrarian alliance, and the rise of the First Party System.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Surveyors ran a alignment over the Allegheny Mountains to Wheeling, Virginia, on the Ohio River by 1818, building a stone\u2011surfaced, cambered roadway, masonry bridges, culverts, and cast\u2011iron mileposts that set standards for antebellum turnpikes.\nBetween 1825 and 1838, Congress approved successive appropriations that pushed the highway westward across Ohio, Indiana, and into Illinois. Construction gangs reached Zanesville in 1833, Columbus in 1834, the eastern outskirts of Indianapolis in 1836, Terre Haute in 1838, and the then\u2011capital of Vandalia, Illinois\u2014591\u00a0mi (951\u00a0km) from Cumberland\u2014by 1839, when federal contracts ceased.\nFrom 1806 to 1838, Congress appropriated about $6.8\u00a0million for surveys, right\u2011of\u2011way acquisition, grading, stone surfacing, and masonry\u2014an unprecedented federal outlay for transportation infrastructure. The project triggered widespread debates over the constitutional scope of \"internal improvements\".\nThe operation and maintenance of completed segments were transferred to the states in stages\u2014Maryland\u00a0(1833), Pennsylvania\u00a0(1836), Virginia (now West\u00a0Virginia)\u00a0(1838), Ohio\u00a0(1849), Indiana\u00a0(1849), and Illinois\u00a0(1856). Traffic declined with the rise of canals and railroads, but many portions were rebuilt in concrete or brick during the 1910s\u20131930s and incorporated into U.S. Route\u00a040.\nIn the 20th century, with the advent of the automobile, the National Road was connected with other historic routes to California under the title, National Old Trails Road. Today, much of the alignment is followed by U.S. Route 40 (US\u00a040), with various portions bearing the Alternate U.S. Route 40 (Alt. US\u00a040) designation, or various state-road numbers (such as Maryland Route 144 for several sections between Baltimore and Cumberland). Scholars regard the National Road as a foundational step toward the modern Interstate Highway System.\nIn 1976, the American Society of Civil Engineers designated the National Road as a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark. In 2002, the entire road, including extensions east to Baltimore and west to St. Louis, was designated the Historic National Road, an All-American Road. The surviving corridor, which includes historic tollhouses, stone\u2011arch and iron bridges, and intact macadam sections, is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\nHistory.\nBraddock Road.\nThe Braddock Road had been opened by the Ohio Company in 1751 between Fort Cumberland, the limit of navigation on the upper Potomac River, and the French military station at Fort Duquesne at the forks of the Ohio River, (at the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers), an important trading and military point where the city of Pittsburgh now stands. It received its name during the colonial-era French and Indian War of 1753\u20131763 (also known as the Seven Years' War in Europe), when it was constructed by British General Edward Braddock, who was accompanied by Colonel George Washington of the Virginia militia regiment in the ill-fated July 1755 Braddock expedition, an attempt to assault the French-held Fort Duquesne.\nCumberland Road.\nConstruction of the Cumberland Road (which later became part of the longer National Road) was authorized on March 29, 1806, by Congress. The new Cumberland Road would replace the wagon and foot paths of the Braddock Road for travel between the Potomac and Ohio Rivers, following roughly the same alignment until just east of Uniontown, Pennsylvania. From there, where the Braddock Road turned north towards Pittsburgh, the new National Road/Cumberland Road continued west to Wheeling, Virginia (now West Virginia), also on the Ohio River.\nThe contract for the construction of the first section was awarded to Henry McKinley on May 8, 1811, and construction began later that year, with the road reaching Wheeling on August 1, 1818. For more than 100 years, a simple granite stone was the only marker of the road's beginning in Cumberland, Maryland. In June 2012, a monument and plaza were built in that town's Riverside Park, next to the historic original starting point.\nBeyond the National Road's eastern terminus at Cumberland and toward the Atlantic coast, a series of private toll roads and turnpikes were constructed, connecting the National Road (also known as the Old National Pike) with Baltimore, then the third-largest city in the country, and a major maritime port on Chesapeake Bay. Completed in 1824, these feeder routes formed what is referred to as an eastern extension of the federal National Road.\nWestward extension.\nOn May 15, 1820, Congress authorized an extension of the road to St. Louis, on the Mississippi River, and on March 3, 1825, across the Mississippi and to Jefferson City, Missouri. Work on the extension between Wheeling and Zanesville, Ohio, used the pre-existing Zane's Trace of Ebenezer Zane, and was completed in 1833 to the new state capital of Columbus, Ohio, and in 1838 to the college town of Springfield, Ohio.\nIn 1849, a bridge was completed to carry the National Road across the Ohio River at Wheeling. The Wheeling Suspension Bridge, designed by Charles Ellet Jr., was at the time the world's longest bridge span at from tower to tower.\nTransfer to states.\nMaintenance costs on the Cumberland Road were becoming more than Congress was willing to bear. In agreements with Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania, the road was to be reconstructed and resurfaced. The section that ran over Haystack Mountain, just west of Cumberland, was abandoned and a new road was built through the Cumberland Narrows.\nOn April 1, 1835, the section from Wheeling to Cumberland was transferred to Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Virginia (now West Virginia). The last congressional appropriation was made May 25, 1838, and in 1840, Congress voted against completing the unfinished portion of the road, with the deciding vote being cast by Henry Clay. By that time, railroads were beginning to compete for long-distance transportation. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad was being built west from Baltimore to Cumberland, mostly along the Potomac River, which was a more direct route than the National Road across the Allegheny Plateau of West Virginia (then Virginia) to Wheeling. Construction of the National Road stopped in 1839. Portions of the road through Indiana and Illinois remained unpaved or otherwise rudimentary and were transferred to the states.\nFederal construction of the road stopped at Vandalia, Illinois, which at that time was the state's capital. Illinois officials decided not to continue construction without the federal funds because two state roads from Vandalia to the St. Louis area, today's US\u00a040 and Illinois Route 140 (known then as the Alton Road), already existed.\nSubsequent events.\nIn 1912, the National Road was chosen to become part of the National Old Trails Road, which would extend further east to New York City and west to Los Angeles, California. Five \"Madonna of the Trail\" monuments, donated by the Daughters of the American Revolution, were erected along the National Road section; others were erected further west.\nIn 1927, the National Road was designated as the eastern part of US\u00a040, which still generally follows the National Road's alignment with occasional bypasses, realignments, and newer bridges. The mostly parallel Interstate 70 (I-70) now provides a faster route for through travel without the many sharp curves, steep grades, and narrow bridges of US\u00a040 and other segments of the National Road. Heading west from Hancock in western Maryland, I-70 takes a more northerly path to connect with and follow the Pennsylvania Turnpike (also designated as I-76) across the mountains between Breezewood and New Stanton, where I-70 turns west to rejoin the National Road's route (and US\u00a040) near Washington, Pennsylvania.\nThe more recently constructed I-68 parallels the old road from Hancock through Cumberland west to Keyser's Ridge, Maryland, where the National Road and US\u00a040 turn northwest into Pennsylvania, but I-68 continues directly west to meet I-79 near Morgantown, West Virginia. The portion of I-68 in Maryland is designated as the National Freeway.\nHistorical structures.\nMany of the National Road's original stone arch bridges also remain on former alignments, including:\nAnother remaining National Road bridge is the Wheeling Suspension Bridge at Wheeling, West Virginia. Opened in 1849 to carry the road over the Ohio River, it was the largest suspension bridge in the world until 1851, and until 2019 was the oldest vehicular suspension bridge in the United States still in use, although it has since been closed to vehicular traffic due to repeated overweight vehicles ignoring the weight limits and damaging the bridge. A newer bridge now carries the realigned US\u00a040 and I-70 across the river nearby.\nThree of the road's original toll houses are preserved:\nAdditionally, several Old National Pike Milestones\u2014some well-maintained, others deteriorating, and yet others represented by modern replacements\u2014remain intact along the route.\nRoute description.\nIn general, the road climbed westwards along the Amerindian trail known as Chief Nemacolin's Path, once followed and improved by a young George Washington, then also followed by the Braddock Expedition. Using the Cumberland Narrows, its first phase of construction crossed the Allegheny Mountains entered southwestern Pennsylvania, reaching the Allegheny Plateau in Somerset County, Pennsylvania. There, travelers could turn off to Pittsburgh or continue west through Uniontown and reach navigable water, the Monongahela River, at Brownsville, Pennsylvania, which was by then a major outfitting center and riverboat-building emporium. Many settlers boarded boats there to travel down the Ohio and up the Missouri, or elsewhere on the Mississippi watershed.\nBy 1818, travelers could press on, still following Chief Nemacolin's trail across the ford, or taking a ferry to West Brownsville, moving through Washington County, Pennsylvania, and passing into Wheeling, Virginia (now West Virginia), away on the Ohio River. Subsequent efforts pushed the road across the states of Ohio and Indiana and into the Illinois Territory. The western terminus of the National Road at its greatest extent was at the Kaskaskia River in Vandalia, Illinois, near the intersection of modern US\u00a051 and US\u00a040.\nToday, travelers driving east from Vandalia travel along modern US\u00a040 through south-central Illinois. The National Road continued into Indiana along modern US\u00a040, passing through the cities of Terre Haute and Indianapolis. Within Indianapolis, the National Road used the original alignment of US\u00a040 along West and East Washington Street (modern US\u00a040 is now routed along I-465). East of Indianapolis, the road went through the city of Richmond before entering Ohio, where the road continued along modern US\u00a040 and passed through the northern suburbs of Dayton, Springfield, and Columbus.\nWest of Zanesville, Ohio, despite US\u00a040's predominantly following the original route, many segments of the original road can still be found. Between Old Washington and Morristown, the original roadbed has been overlaid by I-70. The road then continued east across the Ohio River into Wheeling in West Virginia, the original western end of the National Road when it was first paved. After running in West Virginia, the National Road then entered Pennsylvania.\nThe road cut across southwestern Pennsylvania, heading southeast for about before entering Maryland. East of Keyser's Ridge, the road used modern Alt US\u00a040 to the city of Cumberland (modern US\u00a040 is now routed along I-68). Cumberland was the original eastern terminus of the road.\nIn the mid-19th century, a turnpike extension to Baltimore was approved\u2014along what is now Maryland Route 144 from Cumberland to Hancock, US\u00a040 from Hancock to Hagerstown, Alternate US\u00a040 from Hagerstown to Frederick, and Maryland Route 144 from Frederick to Baltimore. The approval process was a hotly debated subject because of the removal of the original macadam construction that made this road famous.\nThe road's route between Baltimore and Cumberland continues to use the name National Pike or Baltimore National Pike and as Main Street in Ohio today, with various portions now signed as US\u00a040, Alt. US\u00a040, or Maryland Route 144. A spur between Frederick, Maryland, and Georgetown (Washington, D.C.), now Maryland Route 355, bears various local names, but is sometimes referred to as the Washington National Pike; it is now paralleled by I-270 between the Capital Beltway (I-495) and Frederick.\nMillionaires' Row.\nNicknamed the \"Main Street of America\", the road's presence in towns on its route and effective access to surrounding towns attracted wealthy residents to build their houses along the road in towns such as in Richmond, Indiana, and Springfield, Ohio, creating Millionaires' Rows.\nHistoric designations.\nIn 1976, the American Society of Civil Engineers designated the National Road as a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark.\nThere are several structures associated with the National Road that are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Some are listed below.\nPennsylvania.\nThe Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission has installed five historical markers noting the historic importance of the road: one in Somerset County on August 10, 1947, one in Washington County on April 1, 1949, and three in Fayette County on October 12, 1948, October 12, 1948, and May 19, 1996.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "55564", "revid": "4842600", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55564", "title": "Embargo Act of 1807", "text": "1807 U.S. law forbidding trade with all other countries\nThe Embargo Act of 1807 was a general trade embargo on all foreign nations that was enacted by the United States Congress. Much broader than the ineffectual 1806 Non-importation Act, it represented an escalation of attempts to persuade Britain to cease impressment of American sailors and to respect American sovereignty and neutrality as the Napoleonic Wars continued. It was also intended to pressure France and other nations, in pursuit of general diplomatic and economic leverage.\nIn the first decade of the 19th century, American shipping grew. During the Napoleonic Wars, rival nations Britain and France targeted neutral American shipping as a means of disrupting the trade of the other nation. American merchantmen bound for trade with \"enemy nations\" were seized as contraband of war by both European navies. The British Royal Navy were impressing American sailors into service, even if they claimed, or could present evidence of, U.S. citizenship. Many either were British-born or had previously served on British ships, or were genuinely British deserters. Incidents such as the \"Chesapeake\"\u2013\"Leopard\" affair outraged Americans.\nCongress imposed the embargo in direct response to these events. President Thomas Jefferson weighed public support for retaliation, but recognized that the United States was militarily far weaker than either Britain or France. He recommended Congress respond instead with commercial warfare. The experiment appealed to Jefferson and would harm his Northeastern opponents more than his domestic allies, irrespective of any actual impact on the European belligerents. The 10th Congress, controlled by his allies, agreed to the Act, which was signed into law on December 22, 1807.\nThe Embargo failed to improve the American diplomatic position, and sharply increased international tensions. Both widespread evasion of the embargo and loopholes in the legislation reduced the intended economic impact. British commercial shipping, which already dominated global trade, was successfully adapting to Napoleon's Continental System by pursuing new markets\u2014particularly in the restive Spanish and Portuguese colonies in South America.\nThe Act's prohibition on imports protected nascent US domestic industries across the board, particularly the textile industry, marking the beginning of a United States manufacturing system, and reducing the nation's dependence upon imported manufactured goods.\nAmericans opposed to the Act launched bitter protests, particularly in New England commercial centers. Support for the declining Federalist Party, which intensely opposed Jefferson, temporarily rebounded and drove electoral gains in 1808 (Senate and House). In the waning days of Jefferson's presidency, the Non-Intercourse Act lifted all embargoes on American shipping except cargoes bound for Britain or France. Enacted March 1, 1809, that law exacerbated tensions with Britain, eventually leading to the War of 1812.\nBackground.\nAfter a short truce between the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars during 1802\u20131803, the European conflicts resumed and continued until the defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1814. The wars caused American relations with both Britain and France to deteriorate rapidly. There was grave risk of war with one or the other. With Britain supreme on the sea and France on the land, the war developed into a struggle of blockade and counterblockade. The commercial war peaked in 1806 and 1807. The Royal Navy shut down most European harbors to American ships unless they first traded through British ports. France declared a paper blockade of Britain, but lacked a navy that could enforce it, and seized American ships that obeyed British regulations. The Royal Navy needed large numbers of sailors, and was deeply angered by the American merchant fleet as a haven for British deserters.\nBritish impressment of sailors from American merchantmen humiliated the United States, showing it unable to protect its ships and sailors. The Royal Navy's impressment of American seamen increased sharply after 1803, causing bitter anger in the U.S. On June 21, 1807, the American warship USS \"Chesapeake\" was boarded on the high seas off the coast of Norfolk, Virginia by the British warship HMS \"Leopard\". The \"Chesapeake\" had been carrying four deserters from the Royal Navy, three of them American and one British. The four deserters, who had been issued American papers, were removed from the \"Chesapeake\" and taken to Halifax, Nova Scotia, where the lone Briton was hanged. The three Americans were initially sentenced to 500 lashes. American diplomatic pressure led Britain to return them with no punishment. But an outraged American public demanded action, and President Jefferson ordered all British warships out of U.S. waters.\nInitial legislation.\nPassed on December 22, 1807, the Act did the following:\nThe shipping embargo was a cumulative addition to the Non-importation Act of 1806 (2 Stat. 379), which was a \"Prohibition of the Importation of certain Goods and Merchandise from the Kingdom of Great Britain,\" the prohibited imported goods being defined where their chief value, which consists of leather, silk, hemp or flax, tin or brass, wool, glass, and paper goods, nails, hats, clothing, and beer.\nThe Embargo Act of 1807 was codified at 2 Stat. 451 and formally titled \"An Embargo laid on Ships and Vessels in the Ports and Harbours of the United States\". The bill was drafted at the request of President Thomas Jefferson and was passed by the 10th Congress on December 22, 1807, during Session 1; Chapter 5. Congress initially acted to enforce a bill prohibiting only imports, but supplements to the bill eventually banned exports as well.\nImpact on US trade.\nThe embargo had the dual effect of severely curtailing American overseas trade, while forcing industrial concerns to invest new capital into domestic manufacturing in the United States. In commercial New England and the Middle Atlantic, ships sat idle. In agricultural areas, particularly the South, farmers and planters could not sell crops internationally. The scarcity of European goods stimulated American manufacturing, particularly in the North, and textile manufacturers began to make massive investments in cotton mills. However, as Britain was still able to export to America particularly through Canada, that benefit did not immediately compensate for present loss of trade and economic momentum. A 2005 study by the economic historian Douglas Irwin estimates that the embargo cost about 5% of America's 1807 gross national product.\nMiniature teapots were manufactured, engraved with slogans intended to bolster flagging popular support for the Embargo Act.\nCase studies.\nA case study of Rhode Island shows the embargo to have devastated shipping-related industries, wrecked existing markets, and broadened opposition to the Democratic\u2013Republican Party. Much of the U.S. approved of smuggling, holding that the embargo violated their rights. Public outcry helped the Federalists regain control of Rhode Island state government in 1808\u20131809. The case is a rare example of American national foreign policy altering local patterns of political allegiance.\nDespite its unpopularity, the Embargo Act yielded limited and unintended benefits to the Northeast, driving capital and labor into New England textile and other manufacturing industries. It reduced U.S. reliance on British manufactured goods. But the growth in domestic industries didn't make up for the damage caused by the embargo.\nIn Vermont, the embargo was doomed to failure on the Lake Champlain\u2013Richeleiu River water route because of the state's dependence on a Canadian outlet for produce. At St. John, Lower Canada, \u00a3140,000 worth of goods smuggled by water were recorded there in 1808, a 31% increase over 1807. Shipments of ashes to make soap nearly doubled to \u00a354,000, but those of lumber dropped by 23% to \u00a311,200. Manufactured goods, which had expanded to \u00a350,000 since Jay's Treaty in 1795, fell by over 20%, especially articles made near tidewater. Newspapers and manuscripts recorded more lake activity than usual, despite the theoretical reduction in shipping that should accompany an embargo. The smuggling was not restricted to water routes, as herds were readily driven across the uncontrollable land border. Southbound commerce gained two thirds overall, but furs dropped a third. Customs officials maintained a stance of vigorous enforcement throughout, and Gallatin's Enforcement Act (1809) was a party issue. Many Vermonters preferred the embargo's exciting game of revenuers versus smugglers, which brought high profits, versus mundane, low-profit normal trade.\nThe New England merchants who evaded the embargo were imaginative, daring, and versatile in their violation of federal law. Gordinier (2001) examines how the merchants of New London, Connecticut, organized and managed the cargoes purchased and sold and the vessels that were used during the years before, during, and after the embargo. Trade routes and cargoes, both foreign and domestic, along with the vessel types, and the ways that their ownership and management were organized show the merchants of southeastern Connecticut evinced versatility in the face of crisis.\nGordinier (2001) concludes that the versatile merchants sought alternative strategies for their commerce and, to a lesser extent, for their navigation. They tried extralegal activities, a reduction in the size of the foreign fleet, and the redocumentation of foreign trading vessels into domestic carriage. Most importantly, they sought new domestic trading partners and took advantage of the political power of Jedidiah Huntington, the Customs Collector. Huntington was an influential member of the Connecticut leadership class (called \"the Standing Order\") and allowed scores of embargoed vessels to depart for foreign ports under the guise of \"special permission\". Old modes of sharing vessel ownership to share the risk proved to be difficult to modify. Instead, established relationships continued through the embargo crisis despite numerous bankruptcies.\nEnforcement efforts.\nJefferson's Secretary of the Treasury, Albert Gallatin, was against the entire embargo and foresaw correctly the impossibility of enforcing the policy and the negative public reaction. \"As to the hope that it may... induce England to treat us better,\" wrote Gallatin to Jefferson shortly after the bill had become law, \"I think is entirely groundless... government prohibitions do always more mischief than had been calculated; and it is not without much hesitation that a statesman should hazard to regulate the concerns of individuals as if he could do it better than themselves.\"\nSince the bill hindered US ships from leaving American ports bound for foreign trade, it had the side effect of hindering American exploration.\nFirst supplementary act.\nJust weeks later, on January 8, 1808, legislation again passed the 10th Congress, Session 1; Chapter 8: \"An Act supplementary...\" to the Embargo Act (2 Stat. 453). As the historian Forrest McDonald wrote, \"A loophole had been discovered\" in the initial enactment, \"namely that coasting vessels, and fishing and whaling boats\" had been exempt from the embargo, and they had been circumventing it, primarily via Canada. The supplementary act extended the bonding provision (Section 2 of the initial Embargo Act) to those of purely-domestic trades:\nMeanwhile, Jefferson requested authorization from Congress to raise 30,000 troops from the current standing army of 2,800, but Congress refused. With their harbors for the most part unusable in the winter anyway, New England and the northern ports of the mid-Atlantic states had paid little notice to the previous embargo acts. That was to change with the spring thaw and the passing of yet another embargo act.147\nWith the coming of the spring, the effect of the previous acts were immediately felt throughout the coastal states, especially in New England. An economic downturn turned into a depression and caused increasing unemployment. Protests occurred up and down the eastern coast. Most merchants and shippers simply ignored the laws. On the Canada\u2013United States border, especially in Upstate New York and in Vermont, the embargo laws were openly flouted. Federal officials believed parts of Maine, such as Passamaquoddy Bay on the border with the British territory of New Brunswick, were in open rebellion. By March, an increasingly-frustrated Jefferson had become resolved to enforce the embargo to the letter.\nOther supplements to Act.\nOn March 12, 1808, Congress passed and Jefferson signed into law yet another supplement to the Embargo Act. It prohibited for the first time all exports of any goods, whether by land or by sea. Violators were subject to a fine of $10,000, plus forfeiture of goods, per offense. It granted the President broad discretionary authority to enforce, deny, or grant exceptions to the embargo.144 Port authorities were authorized to seize cargoes without a warrant and to try any shipper or merchant who was thought to have merely contemplated violating the embargo.\nDespite the added penalties, citizens and shippers openly ignored the embargo. Protests continued to grow and so the Jefferson administration requested and Congress rendered yet another embargo act.\nConsequences.\nThe immediate effect of the embargo hurt the United States as much as it did Britain and France. Britain, expecting to suffer most from the American regulations, built up a new South American market for its exports, and the British shipowners were pleased that American competition had been removed by the action of the US government.\nJefferson placed himself in a strange position with his embargo policy. Though he had frequently argued for as little government intervention as possible, he now found himself assuming extraordinary powers in an attempt to enforce his policy. The presidential election of 1808 had James Madison defeat Charles Cotesworth Pinckney but showed that the Federalists were regaining strength and helped to convince Jefferson and Madison that the embargo should end. Shortly before leaving office in March 1809, Jefferson signed the repeal of the embargo.\nDespite its unpopular nature, the Embargo Act had one longterm positive impact. Unfulfilled domestic demand for manufactured goods stimulated the growth of the Industrial Revolution in the United States, resulting in an emerging American domestic manufacturing system.\nRepeal.\nOn March 1, 1809, Congress passed the Non-Intercourse Act. The law enabled the President, once the wars of Europe had ended, to declare the country sufficiently safe and to allow foreign trade with certain nations.\nIn 1810, the government was ready to try yet another tactic of economic coercion, the desperate measure known as Macon's Bill Number 2. The bill became law on May 1, 1810, and replaced the Non-Intercourse Act. It was an acknowledgment of the failure of economic pressure to coerce the European powers. Trade with both Britain and France was now thrown open, and the US attempted to bargain with the two belligerents. If either power removed its restrictions on American commerce, the US would reapply non-intercourse against the power that had not done so.\nNapoleon quickly took advantage of that opportunity. He promised that his Berlin and Milan Decrees would be repealed, and Madison reinstated non-intercourse against Britain in the fall of 1810. Though Napoleon did not fulfill his promise, the strained Anglo-American relations prevented him from being brought to task for his duplicity.\nThe attempts of Jefferson and Madison to secure recognition of American neutrality via peaceful means gained a belated success in June 1812, when Britain finally promised to repeal their 1807 Orders in Council. The British concession was too late since when the news had reached America, the United States had already declared the War of 1812 against Britain.\nSubsequent Wartime legislation.\nAmerica's declaration of war in mid-June 1812 was followed shortly by the Enemy Trade Act of 1812 on July 6, which employed similar restrictions as previous legislation. it was likewise ineffective and tightened in December 1813 and debated for further tightening in December 1814. After existing embargoes expired with the onset of war, the Embargo Act of 1813 was signed into law December 17, 1813. Four new restrictions were included: an embargo prohibiting all American ships and goods from leaving port, a complete ban on certain commodities customarily produced in the British Empire, a ban against foreign ships trading in American ports unless 75% of the crew were citizens of the ship's flag, and a ban on ransoming ships. The Embargo of 1813 was the nation's last great trade restriction. Never again would the US government cut off all trade to achieve a foreign policy objective. The Act particularly hurt the Northeast since the British kept a tighter blockade on the South and thus encouraged American opposition to the administration. To make his point, the Act was not lifted by Madison until after the defeat of Napoleon, and the point was moot.\nOn February 15, 1815, Madison signed the Enemy Trade Act of 1815, which was tighter than any previous trade restriction including the Enforcement Act of 1809 (January 9) and the Embargo of 1813, but it would expire two weeks later when official word of peace from Ghent was received.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It took effect on January 1, 1808, the earliest date permitted by the United States Constitution.\nThis legislation was promoted by President Thomas Jefferson, who called for its enactment in his 1806 State of the Union Address. He and others had promoted the idea since the 1770s. It reflected the general trend toward abolishing the international slave trade, which Virginia, followed by all the other states, had prohibited or restricted since then (South Carolina, however, had reopened its trade). Congress first regulated against the trade in the Slave Trade Act of 1794, which made it illegal for American ships to participate in the trade. The 1807 law took matters further by criminalizing all importation from abroad, even on foreign ships.\nThe domestic slave trade within the United States was not affected by the 1807 law. Indeed, with the legal supply of imported slaves terminated, the domestic trade increased in importance. In addition, some smuggling of slaves persisted.\nBackground.\nThe Act affected only the import or export of slaves, and did not affect the internal trade in states or between states. During the American Revolution, all of the Thirteen Colonies prohibited their involvement in the international slave trade (some also internally abolished slavery), but three states later reopened the international slave trade (North Carolina banned slave imports in 1794, and strengthened the law in 1795. Georgia received transatlantic slave ships until 1798. South Carolina reopened the transatlantic slave trade in December 1803 and imported 39,075 enslaved people of African descent between 1804 and 1808). protected a state's involvement in the Atlantic slave trade for twenty years from federal prohibition. Article 5 said that this clause could not be affected by constitutional amendment. Only starting on January 1, 1808, could there be a federal law to abolish the international slave trade in all states, although individual states could and did ban it before such time.\nThe Migration or Importation of such Persons as any of the States now existing shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by the Congress prior to the Year one thousand eight hundred and eight, but a tax or duty may be imposed on such Importation, not exceeding ten dollars for each Person.\nBy 1775, Africans both free and enslaved made up 20% of the population in the Thirteen Colonies, which made them the second-largest ethnic group after English Americans. In 1774, the influential, revolutionary Fairfax Resolves, called for an end to the \"wicked, cruel, and unnatural\" Atlantic slave trade. During the Revolutionary War, the United Colonies all pledged to ban their involvement in the transatlantic slave trade. This was done for a variety of economic, political, and moral reasons depending on the colony. After the American victory in 1783, South Carolina reopened its involvement in the slave trade until prohibiting it again in 1787, but then reopened it in 1803; while North Carolina allowed the trade beginning after the Treaty of Paris (1783) until abolishing its involvement in slave trading in 1794; and Georgia allowed the slave trade between 1783, until it closed its international trade in 1798. By 1807, only South Carolina allowed the Atlantic slave trade.\nOn March 22, 1794, Congress passed the Slave Trade Act of 1794, which prohibited making, loading, outfitting, equipping or dispatching of any ship to be used in the trade of slaves, essentially limiting the trade to foreign ships. On August 5, 1797, John Brown of Providence, Rhode Island became the first American to be tried in federal court under the 1794 law. Brown was convicted and was forced to forfeit his ship \"Hope\". In the 1798 act creating the Mississippi Territory, Congress allowed slaves to be transferred from the rest of the United States to Mississippi Territory, and exempted the territory from the part of the 1787 Northwest Ordinance that abolished slavery in the Northwest Territory (modern-day Midwest) after 1800. However, the same act also abolished the importation of slaves to the Mississippi Territory from \"foreign parts\" (foreign nations). The penalty for illegally importing slaves from abroad to the territory was a fine of $300. In the Slave Trade Act of 1800, Congress outlawed U.S. citizens' investment in the trade and the employment of U.S. citizens on ships involved in the trade.\nPassage of the Act.\nOn March 3, 1805, Joseph Bradley Varnum submitted a Massachusetts Proposition to amend the Constitution and Abolish the Slave Trade. This proposition was tabled until 1807.\nOn December 2, 1806, in his annual message to Congress, widely reprinted in most newspapers, President Thomas Jefferson denounced the \"violations of human rights.\" He said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I congratulate you, fellow-citizens, on the approach of the period at which you may interpose your authority constitutionally, to withdraw the citizens of the United States from all further participation in those violations of human rights which have been so long continued on the unoffending inhabitants of Africa, and which the morality, the reputation, and the best interests of our country, have long been eager to proscribe.\nUnder Varnum's leadership, legislation moved through Congress and passed both houses on March 2, 1807. The House and Senate agreed on a bill, approved on March 2, 1807, called \"An Act to prohibit the importation of slaves into any port or place within the jurisdiction of the United States, from and after the first day of January, in the year of our Lord, One Thousand Eight Hundred and Eight.\" The measure also regulated the coastwise slave trade. President Thomas Jefferson signed the bill into law on March 2, 1807. Many in Congress believed the act would doom slavery in the South, but they were mistaken.\nThe role of the Navy was expanded to include patrols off the coasts of Cuba and South America. The effective date of the Act, January 1, 1808, was celebrated by Peter Williams, Jr., in \"An Oration on the Abolition of the Slave Trade\" delivered in New York City.\nEffectiveness and prosecutions for slaving.\nWhile there are no exact figures known, historians estimate that up to 50,000 slaves were illegally imported into the United States after 1808, mostly through Spanish Florida and Texas, before those states were admitted to the Union. However, South Carolina Governor Henry Middleton estimated in 1819 that 13,000 smuggled African slaves arrived every year.\nCarl C. Cutler's book on American clippers records:\nThe act outlawing the slave trade in 1808 furnished another source of demand for fast vessels, and for another half century ships continued to be fitted out and financed in this trade by many a respectable citizen in the majority of American ports. Newspapers of the fifties contain occasional references to the number of ships sailing from the various cities in this traffic. One account stated that as late as 1859 there were seven slavers regularly fitted out in New York, and many more in all the larger ports.\nIn 1820, slave trading became a capital offense with an amendment to the 1819 Act to Protect the Commerce of the United States and Punish the Crime of Piracy. A total of 74 cases of slaving were brought in the United States between 1837 and 1860, \"but few captains had been convicted, and those had received trifling sentences, which they had usually been able to avoid\". Nathaniel Gordon, who was hanged in 1862, was the only person to be executed for illegal slave-trading in the United States.\nIn addition, after the 1808 abolition of the slave trade to the United States, many Americans continued to engage in the slave trade by transporting Africans to Cuba. From 1808 to 1860, almost one-third of all slave ships either were owned by American merchants or were built and outfitted in American ports. It is possible that U.S. citizens \"may have transported twice as many Africans to other countries such as Cuba and Brazil as they did to their own ports\".\nThe U.S. Navy was slow to institute anti-slaving patrols off the slave ports of Africa\u2014it was not until the 1820 legislation that authority was given to the president to use naval vessels for this task. Even then, enforcement activity was sporadic and largely ineffective. The U.S. position meant that many slave ships from other countries falsely flew the American flag to avoid being seized by British anti-slaving patrols. The first U.S. warship sent to the African coast to intercept U.S. vessels operating in the illegal trade was the USS \"Cyane\". A total of five U.S. Navy ships were on station there in 1820 and 1821, arresting 11 American slavers. No further U.S. anti-slaving patrols were carried out until 1842, and then with limited effectiveness due to political pressure from the slave-owning states. The Atlantic slave trade was not ended until the U.S. Civil War, when American-built and -managed ships were prevented from operating.\nAntebellum proposals by Fire-Eaters to reopen.\nIn the South, the Fire-Eaters\u2014antebellum pro-slavery extremists\u2014proposed repealing the act and once more legalizing the international slave trade in the United States. Historian Erskine Clarke writes that this call \"was a shameless expression of their contempt for any antislavery sentiment and a part of their stratagem to divide the nation and create a slaveholding confederacy. Among other things, the Fire-Eaters hoped that a reopened international slave trade would incense the North, and that Northern outrage would cause white Southerns to unite and move toward secession.\"\nIn addition to whipping up sectional tensions, Fire-Eaters advocated the reopening of the slave trade in order to drive down the price of slaves; to balance the millions of European immigrants who had settled in the North and maintain Southern representation in Congress; and assert the morality of slavery: \"Slave trading had to be made right, otherwise slavery was imperiled.\" Fire-Eaters essentially desired to \"legitimize the slave trade in order to make the point that both slavery and the African slave trade were morally acceptable practices\"\u2014a view intended to be precisely opposite that of the abolitionists, who affirmed the immorality of both slavery and the slave trade. The view alarmed even pro-slavery figures, such as former President John Tyler, who in retirement wrote a widely republished letter condemning the Fire-Eaters' call to abrogate Article 8 of the Webster\u2013Ashburton Treaty (which barred the slave trade). Tyler noted that the South had voted to ratify the treaty.\nSlavery and the cotton economy boomed during the 1850s, and cotton prices were resurgent after a decline in the 1840s. This, in turn, drove up the price of slaves, which led to further pressure to re-open the slave trade to meet demand or bring down prices. Not all Southerners felt this way, however, as the high price of slaves benefitted slave owners and slave merchants. But the general sentiment called for a re-opening of the trade as a logical extension of the support for slavery. Southerners reasoned that, if slavery was good, then putting more people into slavery must also be good, and that, if trading slaves in the South was okay, then trading them from Africa must also be okay. Conventions of Southern planters repeatedly called for the trade to re-open. This, of course, was a non-starter in Congress. There were also attempts from state legislatures to allow the importation of \"apprentices\" from Africa, but without success. When trying to repeal the slave act failed, some turned to simply ignoring it. Notable cases during the 1850s included slaves smuggled aboard the \"Wanderer\" and the \"Clotilda\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Macon's Bill Number 2 was the fourth in a series of embargo measures, coming after the Non-Importation Act, the Embargo Act, and the Non-Intercourse Act (1809). Macon neither wrote the bill nor approved it.\nThe law lifted all embargoes with Britain and France for three months. It stated that if either belligerent ceased intercepting American shipping, the United States would embargo the other, unless that other country also agreed to cease intercepting American shipping.\nNapoleon successfully exploited the bill to further his Continental System, effectively a French embargo on Britain that France tried to enforce on continental Europe, and to damage Anglo-American relations. A message was sent to the United States, purporting to agree to the law's demand. President James Madison, a staunch opponent of the bill, had little choice but to accept Napoleon's ostensibly sincere offer. However, as Madison suspected, Napoleon's purpose was manipulative.

Located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the bank was chartered from February 1816 to January 1836. The bank's formal name, according to section 9 of its charter as passed by Congress, was \"The President, Directors, and Company, of the Bank of the United States\". While other banks in the US were chartered by and only allowed to have branches in a single state, it was authorized to have branches in multiple states and lend money to the US government.\nA private corporation with public duties, the bank handled all fiscal transactions for the U.S. government, and was accountable to Congress and the U.S. Treasury. Twenty percent of its capital was owned by the federal government, the bank's single largest stockholder. Four thousand private investors held 80 percent of the bank's capital, including three thousand Europeans. The bulk of the stocks were held by a few hundred wealthy Americans. In its time, the institution was the largest monied corporation in the world.\nThe essential function of the bank was to regulate the public credit issued by private banking institutions through the fiscal duties it performed for the U.S. Treasury, and to establish a sound and stable national currency. The federal deposits endowed the bank with its regulatory capacity.\nModeled on Alexander Hamilton's First Bank of the United States, the Second Bank was chartered by President James Madison, who in 1791 had attacked the First Bank as unconstitutional, in 1816 and began operations at its main branch in Philadelphia on January 7, 1817, managing 25 branch offices nationwide by 1832.\nThe efforts to renew the bank's charter put the institution at the center of the general election of 1832, in which the bank's president Nicholas Biddle and pro-bank National Republicans led by Henry Clay clashed with the \"hard-money\" Andrew Jackson administration and eastern banking interests in the Bank War. Failing to secure recharter, the Second Bank became a private corporation in 1836, and underwent liquidation in 1841. There would not be national banks again until the passage of the National Bank Act in 1863\u20131864.\nHistory.\nEstablishment.\nThe political support for the revival of a national banking system was rooted in the early 19th century transformation of the country from simple Jeffersonian agrarianism towards one interdependent with industrialization and finance. In the aftermath of the War of 1812, the federal government suffered from the disarray of an unregulated currency and a lack of fiscal order; business interests sought security for their government bonds. A national alliance arose to legislate a national bank to address these needs.\nThe political climate\u2014dubbed the Era of Good Feelings\u2014favored the development of national programs and institutions, including a protective tariff, internal improvements and the revival of a Bank of the United States. Southern and western support for a bank, led by Republican nationalists John C. Calhoun of South Carolina and Henry Clay of Kentucky, was decisive in the successful chartering effort. The charter was signed into law by James Madison on April 10, 1816. Subsequent efforts by Calhoun and Clay to earmark the bank's $1.5 million establishment \"bonus\", and annual dividends estimated at $650,000, as a fund for internal improvements, were vetoed by President Madison, on strict constructionist grounds.\nOpposition to a new bank emanated from two interests. Old Republicans, represented by John Taylor of Caroline and John Randolph of Roanoke, characterized the Second Bank as both constitutionally illegitimate and a direct threat to Jeffersonian agrarianism, state sovereignty and the institution of slavery, expressed by Taylor's statement that \"...if Congress could incorporate a bank, it might emancipate a slave.\" Hostile to the regulatory effects of the national bank, private banks\u2014proliferating with or without state charters\u2014had scuttled rechartering of the First Bank in 1811. These interests played significant roles in undermining the institution during the administration of U.S. President Andrew Jackson (1829\u20131837).\nEconomic functions.\nThe Second Bank was a national bank. However, it did not serve the functions of a modern central bank: It did not set monetary policy, regulate private banks, hold their excess reserves, or act as a lender of last resort.\nThe bank was launched in the midst of a major global market readjustment as Europe recovered from the Napoleonic Wars. It was charged with restraining uninhibited private bank note issue\u2014already in progress\u2014that threatened to create a credit bubble and the risks of a financial collapse. Government land sales in the West, fueled by European demand for agricultural products, ensured that a speculative bubble would form. Simultaneously, the national bank was engaged in promoting a democratized expansion of credit to accommodate laissez-faire impulses among eastern business entrepreneurs and credit-hungry western and southern farmers.\nUnder the management of its first president William Jones, the bank failed to control paper money issued from its branch banks in the West and South, contributing to the post-war speculative land boom. When the U.S. markets collapsed in the Panic of 1819\u2014a result of global economic adjustments\u2014the bank came under withering criticism for its belated tight money policies\u2014policies that exacerbated mass unemployment and plunging property values. Further, it transpired that branch directors for the Baltimore office had engaged in fraud and larceny.\nResigning in January 1819, Jones was replaced by Langdon Cheves, who continued the contraction in credit in an effort to stop inflation and stabilize the bank, even as the economy began to correct. The bank's reaction to the crisis\u2014a clumsy expansion, then a sharp contraction of credit\u2014indicated its weakness, not its strength. The effects were catastrophic, resulting in a protracted recession with mass unemployment and a sharp drop in property values that persisted until 1822. The financial crisis raised doubts among the American public as to the efficacy of paper money, and in whose interests a national system of finance operated. Upon this widespread disaffection the anti-bank Jacksonian Democrats would mobilize opposition to the bank in the 1830s. The bank was in general disrepute among most Americans when Nicholas Biddle, the third and last president of the bank, was appointed by President James Monroe in 1823.\nUnder Biddle's guidance, the bank evolved into a powerful institution that produced a strong and sound system of national credit and currency. From 1823 to 1833, Biddle expanded credit steadily, but with restraint, in a manner that served the needs of the expanding American economy. Albert Gallatin, former Secretary of the Treasury under Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, wrote in 1831 that the bank was fulfilling its charter expectations.\nJackson's Bank War.\nBy the time of Jackson's inauguration in 1829, the bank appeared to be on solid footing. The Supreme Court had affirmed its constitutionality in \"McCulloch v. Maryland\", the 1819 case which Daniel Webster had argued successfully on its behalf a decade earlier, the Treasury recognized the useful services it provided, and the American currency was healthy and stable. Public perceptions of the national bank were generally positive. The bank first came under attack by the Jackson administration in December 1829, on the grounds that it had failed to produce a stable national currency, and that it lacked constitutional legitimacy. Both houses of Congress responded with committee investigations and reports affirming the historical precedents for the bank's constitutionality and its pivotal role in furnishing a uniform currency. Jackson rejected these findings, and privately characterized the bank as a corrupt institution, dangerous to American liberties.\nBiddle made repeated overtures to Jackson and his cabinet to secure a compromise on the bank's rechartering (its term due to expire in 1836) without success. Jackson and the anti-bank forces persisted in their condemnation of the bank, provoking an early recharter campaign by pro-bank National Republicans under Henry Clay. Clay's political ultimatum to Jackson\u2014with Biddle's financial and political support\u2014sparked the Bank War and placed the fate of the bank at center of the 1832 presidential election.\nJackson mobilized his political base by vetoing the recharter bill and, the veto sustained, easily won reelection on his anti-bank platform. Jackson proceeded to destroy the bank as a financial and political force by removing its federal deposits, and in 1833, federal revenue was diverted into selected private banks by executive order, ending the regulatory role of the Second Bank.\nIn hopes of extorting a rescue of the bank, Biddle induced a short-lived financial crisis that was initially blamed on Jackson's executive action. By 1834, a general backlash against Biddle's tactics developed, ending the panic, and all recharter efforts were abandoned.\nState bank.\nIn February 1836, the bank became a private corporation under Pennsylvania law. A shortage of hard currency ensued, causing the Panic of 1837 and lasting approximately seven years. The bank suspended payment from October 1839 to January 1841, and permanently in February 1841. It then started a lengthy liquidation process, complicated by lawsuits, that ended in 1852 when it assigned its remaining assets to trustees and surrendered the state charter.\nBranches.\nThe bank maintained the following branches. Listed is the year each branch opened.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nTerms of charter.\nThe Second Bank was America's national bank, comparable to the Bank of England and the Bank of France, with one key distinction \u2013 the United States government owned one-fifth (20 percent) of its capital. Whereas other national banks of that era were wholly private, the Second Bank was more characteristic of a government bank.\nUnder its charter, the bank had a capital limit of $35\u00a0million, $7.5\u00a0million of which represented the government-owned share. It was required to remit a \"bonus\" payment of $1.5 million, payable in three installments, to the government for the privilege of using the public funds, interest free, in its private banking ventures. The institution was answerable for its performance to the U.S. Treasury and Congress and subject to Treasury Department inspection.\nAs exclusive fiscal agent for the federal government, it provided a number of services as part of its charter, including holding and transfer of all U.S. deposits, payment and receipt of all government transactions, and processing of tax payments. In other words, the bank was \"the depository of the federal government, which was its principal stockholder and customer.\"\nThe chief personnel for the bank comprised 25 directors, five of whom were appointed by the President of the United States, subject to Senate approval. Federally appointed directors were barred from acting as officials in other banks. Two of the three Bank presidents, William Jones and Nicholas Biddle, were chosen from among these government directors.\nHeadquartered in Philadelphia, the bank was authorized to establish branch offices where it deemed suitable, and these were immune from state taxation.\nRegulatory mechanisms.\nThe primary regulatory task of the Second Bank, as chartered by Congress in 1816, was to restrain the uninhibited proliferation of paper money (bank notes) by state or private lenders, which was highly profitable to these institutions. In this capacity, the bank would preside over this democratization of credit, contributing to a vast and profitable disbursement of bank loans to farmers, small manufacturers and entrepreneurs, encouraging rapid and healthy economic expansion. Historian Bray Hammond describes the mechanism by which the bank exerted its anti-inflationary influence:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Receiving the checks and notes of local banks deposited with the [Bank] by government collectors of revenue, the [Bank] had constantly to come back on the local banks for settlements of the amounts which the checks and notes called for. It had to do so because it made those amounts immediately available to the Treasury, wherever desired. Since settlement by the local banks was in specie i.e. silver and gold coin, the pressure for settlement automatically regulated local banking lending: for the more the local banks lent the larger amount of their notes and checks in use and the larger the sums they had to settle in specie. This loss of specie reduced their power to lend.\nUnder this banking regime, the impulse towards over-speculation, with the risks of creating a national financial crisis, would be avoided, or at least mitigated. It was just this mechanism that the local private banks found objectionable, because it yoked their lending strategies to the fiscal operations of the national government, requiring them to maintain adequate gold and silver reserves to meet their debt obligations to the U.S. Treasury. The proliferation of private-sector banking institutions \u2013 from 31 banks in 1801 to 788 in 1837 \u2013 meant that the Second Bank faced strong opposition from this sector during the Jackson administration.\nArchitecture.\nThe architect of the Second Bank was William Strickland (1788\u20131854), a former student of Benjamin Latrobe (1764\u20131820), the man who is often called the first professionally trained American architect. Latrobe and Strickland were both disciples of the Greek Revival style. Strickland went on to design many other American public buildings in this style, including financial structures such as the Mechanics National Bank (also in Philadelphia). He also designed the second building for the main U.S. Mint in Philadelphia in 1833, as well as the New Orleans, Dahlonega, and Charlotte branch mints in the mid-to-late 1830s.\nStrickland's design for the Second Bank is in essence based on the Parthenon in Athens, and is a significant early and monumental example of Greek Revival architecture. The hallmarks of the Greek Revival style can be seen immediately in the north and south fa\u00e7ades, which use a large set of steps leading up to the main level platform, known as the stylobate. On top of these, Strickland placed eight severe Doric columns, which are crowned by an entablature containing a triglyph frieze and simple triangular pediment. The building appears much as an ancient Greek temple, hence the stylistic name. The interior consists of an entrance hallway in the center of the north fa\u00e7ade flanked by two rooms on either side. The entry leads into two central rooms, one after the other, that span the width of the structure east to west. The east and west sides of the first large room are each pierced by a large arched fan window. The building's exterior uses Pennsylvania blue marble, which, due to the manner in which it was cut, has begun to deteriorate due to weak parts of the stone being exposed to the elements. This phenomenon is most visible on the Doric columns of the south fa\u00e7ade. Construction lasted from 1819 to 1824.\nThe Greek Revival style used for the Second Bank contrasts with the earlier, Federal style in architecture used for the First Bank of the United States, which also still stands and is located nearby in Philadelphia. This can be seen in the more Roman-influenced Federal structure's ornate, colossal Corinthian columns of its fa\u00e7ade, which is also embellished by Corinthian pilasters and a symmetric arrangement of sash windows piercing the two stories of the fa\u00e7ade. The roofline is also topped by a balustrade, and the heavy modillions adorning the pediment give the First Bank an appearance more like a Roman villa than a Greek temple.\nCurrent building use.\nSince the bank's closing in 1841, the edifice has performed a variety of functions. Today, it is part of Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia. The structure is open to the public free of charge and serves as an art gallery, housing a large collection of portraits of prominent early Americans painted by Charles Willson Peale and many others. The portrait gallery also includes the wooden statue of George Washington by William Rush.\nThe building was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1987 for its architectural and historic significance.\nThe Wall Street branch in New York City was converted into the United States Assay Office before it was demolished in 1915. The federal-style fa\u00e7ade was saved and installed in the American Wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1924.\nIn popular culture.\nThe Second Bank building was described by Charles Dickens in a chapter of his 1842 travelogue \"American Notes for General Circulation\", Philadelphia, and its solitary prison: We reached the city, late that night. Looking out of my chamber-window, before going to bed, I saw, on the opposite side of the way, a handsome building of white marble, which had a mournful ghost-like aspect, dreary to behold. I attributed this to the sombre influence of the night, and on rising in the morning looked out again, expecting to see its steps and portico thronged with groups of people passing in and out. The door was still tight shut, however; the same cold cheerless air prevailed: and the building looked as if the marble statue of Don Guzman could alone have any business to transact within its gloomy walls. I hastened to inquire its name and purpose, and then my surprise vanished. It was the Tomb of many fortunes; the Great Catacomb of investment; the memorable United States Bank.\nThe stoppage of this bank, with all its ruinous consequences, had cast (as I was told on every side) a gloom on Philadelphia, under the depressing effect of which it yet laboured.

It followed the Bank of North America, the nation's first \"de facto\" national bank. However, neither served the functions of a modern central bank: They did not set monetary policy, regulate private banks, hold their excess reserves, or act as a lender of last resort. They were national insofar as they were allowed to have branches in multiple states and lend money to the US government. Other banks in the US were each chartered by, and only allowed to have branches in, a single state.\nEstablishment of the Bank of the United States was part of a three-part expansion of federal fiscal and monetary power, along with a federal mint and excise taxes, championed by Alexander Hamilton, first secretary of the treasury. Hamilton believed a national bank was necessary to stabilize and improve the nation's credit, and to improve handling of the financial business of the United States government under the newly enacted Constitution.\nThe First Bank building, located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, within Independence National Historical Park, was completed in 1797, and is a National Historic Landmark for its historic and architectural significance.\nOrigins and history.\nBackground.\nAlexander Hamilton was the first Secretary of the Treasury. In addition to sponsoring a national bank, Hamilton's other measures included an assumption of the state war debts by the U.S. government, establishment of a mint and imposition of a federal excise tax. The goals of Hamilton's measures were to:\nIn simpler words, Hamilton's four goals were to:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe tendency of a national bank is to increase public and private credit. The former gives power to the state for the protection of its rights and interests, and the latter facilitates and extends the operations of commerce amongst individuals.\n\u2014 Alexander Hamilton, December 1790 report to George Washington\nProposal.\nAccording to the plan put before the first session of the First Congress in 1790, Hamilton proposed establishing the initial funding for the First Bank of the United States through the sale of $10 million in stock of which the United States government would purchase the first $2 million in shares. Hamilton, foreseeing the objection that this could not be done since the U.S. government did not have $2 million, proposed that the government purchase the stock using money lent to it by the bank; the loan to be paid back in ten equal annual installments. The remaining $8 million of stock would be available to the public, both in the United States and overseas. The chief requirement of these non-government purchases was that one-quarter of the purchase price had to be paid in gold or silver; the remaining balance could be paid in bonds, acceptable scrip, etc.\nUnlike the Bank of England, the primary function of the bank would be to issue credit to the government and private interests, for internal improvements and other economic development, per Hamilton's system of Public Credit. The business would be involved in on behalf of the federal government\u2014a depository for collected taxes, making short-term loans to the government to cover real or potential temporary income gaps, serving as a holding site for both incoming and outgoing monies\u2014was considered highly important but still secondary in nature.\nThere were other, non-negotiable conditions for the establishment of the First Bank of the United States. Among these were:\nTo ensure that the government could meet both the current and future demands of its governmental accounts, an additional source of funding was required, \"for interest payments on the assumed state debts would begin to fall due at the end of 1791...those payments would require $788,333 annually, and... an additional $38,291 was needed to cover deficiencies in the funds that had been appropriated for existing commitments.\" To achieve this, Hamilton repeated a suggestion he had made nearly a year before\u2014increase the duty on imported spirits, plus raise the excise tax on domestically distilled whiskey and other liquors. Local opposition to the tax led to the Whiskey Rebellion.\nOpposition.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nJefferson's views:\"Hamilton's financial system had then passed. It had two objects; 1st, like a puzzle, to exclude popular understanding and inquiry; 2nd, as a machine for the corruption of the legislature; for he avowed the opinion, that man could be governed by one of two motives only, force or interest; force, he observed, in this country was out of the question, and the interests, therefore, of the members must be laid hold of, to keep the legislative in unison with the executive. And with grief and shame, it must be acknowledged that his machine was not without effect; that even in this, the birth of our government, some members were found sordid enough to bend their duty to their interests, and to look after personal rather than public good.\nIt is well known that during the war the greatest difficulty we encountered was the want of money or means to pay our soldiers who fought, or our farmers, manufacturers, and merchants, who furnished the necessary supplies of food and clothing for them. After the expedient of paper money had exhausted itself, certificates of debt were given to the individual creditors, with an assurance of payment so soon as the United States should be able. But the distresses of these people often obliged them to part with these for the half, the fifth, and even a tenth of their value; and speculators had made a trade of cozening them from the holders by the most fraudulent practices, and persuasions that they would never be paid. In the bill for funding and paying these, Hamilton made no difference between the original holders and the fraudulent purchasers of this paper.\"\n \u2014 Thomas Jefferson, February 4 entry in \"The Anas\"\nHamilton's bank proposal faced widespread resistance from opponents of increased federal power. Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson and James Madison led the opposition, which claimed that the bank was unconstitutional, and that it benefited merchants and investors at the expense of the majority of the population.\nLike most of the Southern members of Congress, Jefferson and Madison also opposed a second of the three proposals of Hamilton: establishing an official government Mint. They believed this centralization of power away from local banks was dangerous to a sound monetary system and was mostly to the benefit of business interests in the commercial north, not southern agricultural interests, arguing that the right to own property would be infringed by these proposals. Furthermore, they contended that the creation of such a bank violated the Constitution, which specifically stated that Congress was to regulate weights and measures and issue coined money (rather than mint and bills of credit).\nThe first part of the bill, the concept, and establishment of a national mint, met with no real objection, and sailed through; it was assumed the second and third part (the bank and an excise tax to finance it) would likewise glide through, and in their own way they did: The House version of the bill, despite some heated objections, easily passed. The Senate version of the bill did likewise, with considerably fewer, and milder, objections. It was when \"the two bills changed houses, complications set in. In the Senate, Hamilton's supporters objected to the House's alteration of the plans for the excise tax.\"\nThe establishment of the bank also raised early questions of constitutionality in the new government. Hamilton, then Secretary of the Treasury, argued that the bank was an effective means to utilize the authorized powers of the government implied under the law of the Constitution. Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson argued that the bank violated traditional property laws and that its relevance to constitutionally authorized powers was weak. Another argument came from James Madison, who believed Congress had not received the power to incorporate a bank or any other governmental agency. His argument rested primarily on the Tenth Amendment: that all powers not endowed to Congress are retained by the States (or the people). Additionally, his belief was that if the Constitution's writers had wanted Congress to have such power, they would have made it explicit. The decision would ultimately fall on President George Washington, following his deliberate investigation of the cabinet members' opinions.\nPresidential approval.\nGeorge Washington initially declared that he was hesitant to sign the \"bank bill\" into law. Washington asked for the written advice and supporting reasons from all his cabinet members\u2014most particularly from Hamilton. Attorney General Edmund Randolph from Virginia felt that the bill was unconstitutional. Jefferson, also from Virginia, agreed that Hamilton's proposal was against both the spirit and letter of the Constitution. Hamilton, who, unlike his fellow cabinet members, came from New York, quickly responded to those who claimed incorporation of the bank unconstitutional. While Hamilton's rebuttals were many and varied, chief among them were these two:\nOn February 25, 1791, convinced that the constitution authorized the measure, Washington signed the \"bank bill\" into law.\nOn March 19, 1791 Washington appointed three Commissioners for the taking of subscriptions for this new bank: Thomas Willing, David Rittenhouse, and Samuel Howell.\nWilling was later elected as President on October 25, 1791, until he resigned due to ill health on November 10, 1807. The bank's Philadelphia branch opened its doors on December 12, 1791. Willing was succeeded by David Lenox, serving until the expiration of its charter on March 4, 1811.\nExpiration of charter.\nAfter Hamilton left office in 1795, the new Secretary of the Treasury Oliver Wolcott Jr. informed Congress that, due to the existing state of government finances, more money was needed. This could be achieved either by selling the government's shares of stock in the bank or by raising taxes. Wolcott advised the first choice. Congress quickly agreed. Hamilton objected, believing that the dividends on that stock had been inviolably pledged for the support of the sinking fund to retire the debt. Hamilton tried to organize opposition to the measure but was unsuccessful.\nIn 1816, the bank was succeeded by the Second Bank of the United States.\nPurchase by Girard.\nAfter the charter for the First Bank of the United States expired in 1811, Stephen Girard purchased most of its stock as well as the building and its furnishings on South Third Street in Philadelphia and opened his own bank, later known as Girard Bank. Girard hired George Simpson, the cashier of the First Bank of the United States, as cashier of the new bank, and with seven other employees, opened for business on May 18, 1812. He allowed the Trustees of the First Bank of the United States to use some offices and space in the vaults to continue the process of winding down the affairs of the closed bank at a nominal rent.\nOver its early history the bank was known as \"Girard's Bank,\" or as \"Girard Bank\" or also as \"Stephen Girard's Bank\" or even the \"Bank of Stephen Girard.\" Girard was the sole proprietor of his bank, and thus avoided the Pennsylvania state law which prohibited an unincorporated association of persons from establishing a bank, and which required a charter from the legislature for a banking corporation.\nBank building and branches.\nThe First Bank of the United States was established in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, while the city served as the national capital, from 1790 to 1800. The bank began operations in Carpenters' Hall in 1791, some 200 feet from its permanent home. Branches opened in Boston, New York, Charleston, and Baltimore in 1792, followed by branches in Norfolk (1800), Savannah (1802), Washington, D.C. (1802), and New Orleans (1805).\nDesign of the bank building is credited to Samuel Blodgett, Superintendent of Buildings for the new capital in Washington, DC., although it has also been attributed to James Hoban. It was completed in 1797 and was the first building specifically for the new federal government.\nThe First Bank of the United States has received various designations as a historic building. It was included in Independence National Historical Park when the park was formed in 1956. The building's architecture was studied by the Historic American Buildings Survey in 1958. With the rest of Independence National Historical Park, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966, and the bank was then declared a National Historic Landmark on May 4, 1987. It is described in the landmark designation as an early masterpiece of monumental Classical Revival design.\nThe building has been closed to the public since the 1970s. Until about 2000, the building housed offices for Independence National Historical Park. A proposal to have it house the collection of the Philadelphia Civil War Museum was abandoned when funding from the state of Pennsylvania was not forthcoming.\nIn June 2023, Independence National Historical Park received $22 million from the Great American Outdoors Act to renovate the building and develop a museum about the early American economy, planned to open in 2026.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was chartered by the Congress of the Confederation on May 26, 1781, and opened in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on January 7, 1782. \nThe bank's founding was based on a plan presented by Superintendent of Finance Robert Morris on May 17, 1781, including recommendations by Revolutionary-era Founding Father Alexander Hamilton, who was appointed the first U.S. Secretary of the Treasury by George Washington. Although Hamilton later noted the bank's \"essential\" contribution to the American Revolutionary War, the Pennsylvania government objected to its privileges and reincorporated it under state law, making it unsuitable as a national bank under the U.S. Constitution. Congress instead chartered the First Bank of the United States, a new bank, in 1791, while the Bank of North America continued as a private concern.\nRevolutionary war period.\nCongressional charter.\nIn May 1781, Alexander Hamilton revealed that he had recommended Robert Morris for the position of Superintendent of Finance of the United States the previous summer when the constitution of the Articles of Confederation-era executive was being solidified. He also proceeded to lay out a proposal for a national bank that would serve as a \"de facto\" central bank. \nMorris corresponded with Hamilton previously on the subject of funding the war, and immediately drafted a legislative proposal based on Hamilton's suggestion and submitted it to the Congress. Morris persuaded Congress to charter the Bank of North America, the first private commercial bank in the United States. His friend, Dr. Hugh Shiell, paid \u00a35000 to the capital stock.\nStock offering.\nThe original charter as outlined by Hamilton called for the disbursement of 1,000 shares priced at $400 each. Benjamin Franklin purchased a single token share as a sign of good faith to Federalists and their new bank. Hamilton used his pseudonym \"Publius\", later immortalized in the Federalist Papers advocating in the late 1780s for adoption of the United States Constitution, to endorse the bank.\nWilliam Bingham, rumored to be the richest man in America after the Revolutionary War, purchased 9.5% of the available shares. The greatest share, however, 63.3%, was purchased on behalf of the United States government by Robert Morris, using a gift in the form of a loan from France and a loan from Netherlands. This had the effect of capitalizing the bank with large deposits of gold and silver coin and bills of exchange. He then issued new paper currency backed by this supply.\nOfficers.\nThomas Willing, who served two terms as mayor of Philadelphia and was a partner with Morris in an import-export firm that once dominated the city's slave trade, was named the bank's first president. He held that office from 1781 to 1791, being succeeded by John Nixon, and moving immediately on to become the first president of the First Bank of the United States, a position he held from 1791 to 1807.\nBanknotes.\nThe bank issued its own notes that superseded the troubled Continental currency bills. These notes were printed on paper with colored fibers pressed into the reverse side as an anti-counterfeiting measure. Unlike the Continental bills, the new notes carried a promise to pay silver on demand. Despite these changes, the bank had difficulty at first persuading people of its good credit, and at one point it employed repossessors to follow people who redeemed notes and urge them to deposit the money back. To promote the impression that it had a large reserve, the bank made a show of moving cash boxes to and from its cellar. Once the stock was fully subscribed and paid, doubts subsided and the notes rose to par value. By 1783, several states including Massachusetts enacted legislation allowing Americans to pay taxes with Bank of North America notes, giving them a crucial aspect of legal tender.\nPrivate bank.\nIn the economic turmoil that followed the American Revolutionary War, the bank's strictness in collecting debts drew opposition from Pennsylvania residents, who petitioned the Pennsylvania General Assembly to revoke the state charter granted to it in 1782. The charter was revoked in 1785, although the bank continued to operate with difficulty under its congressional charter and then under a Delaware charter. The following year, the Pennsylvania General Assembly granted a new charter with several restrictions, including that it could not trade any merchandise other than bullion. The Bank of North America, First Bank of the United States, and Bank of New York were the first shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange.\nAfter the passage of the National Bank Act in 1862, the Bank of North America converted its business to operate under the new law. Its unique history presented a problem: the act required a national bank to include the word \"national\" in its name. The bank's management considered its original name a matter of prestige and took the position that the name remained fixed by the Confederation and state charters. The Comptroller of the Currency chose not to press these legal questions and admitted the bank without a name change.\nThe bank merged in 1923 with the Commercial Trust Company to become the Bank of North America and Trust Company, which merged in 1929 with the Pennsylvania Company for Insurances on Lives and Granting Annuities. That company, operating as the Pennsylvania Company for Banking and Trust, merged with the First National Bank in 1955 to become The First Pennsylvania Banking and Trust Company, which was acquired by CoreStates Financial Corporation in 1991, by First Union/Wachovia in 1998, and by Wells Fargo in 2008.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was a bill designed to fail in Congress because it was seen by free trade supporters as hurting both industry and farming, but it passed anyway. The bill was vehemently denounced in the South and escalated to a threat of civil war in the nullification crisis of 1832\u201333. The tariff was replaced in 1833, and the crisis ended. It was called the \"Tariff of Abominations\" by its Southern detractors because of the effects it had on the Southern economy. It set a 38% tax on some imported goods and a 45% tax on certain imported raw materials. \nThe manufacturing-based economy in the Northeastern states felt that it was suffering from low-priced imported manufactured items from Britain. The major goal of the tariff was to protect the factories by taxing imports from Europe. Southerners from the Cotton Belt, particularly those from South Carolina, felt they were harmed directly by having to pay more for imports from Europe. Allegedly, the South was also harmed indirectly because reducing exports of British goods to the U.S would make it difficult for the British to pay for Southern cotton. The reaction in the South, particularly in South Carolina, led to the nullification crisis.\nBackground.\nThe 1828 tariff was part of a series of tariffs that began after the War of 1812 and the Napoleonic Wars, when the blockade of Europe led British manufacturers to offer goods in America at low prices that American manufacturers often could not match. The first protective tariff was passed by Congress in 1816, and its rates were increased in 1824. Southern states such as South Carolina contended that the tariff was unconstitutional and were opposed to the newer protectionist tariffs, as they would have to pay, but Northern states favored them because they helped strengthen their industrial-based economy.\nIn an elaborate scheme to prevent passage of still higher tariffs, while at the same time appealing to Andrew Jackson's supporters in the North, John C. Calhoun and other Southerners joined Martin Van Buren in crafting a tariff bill that would also weigh heavily on materials imported by the New England states. It was believed that President John Quincy Adams's supporters in New England would uniformly oppose the bill for this reason and that the Southern legislators could then withdraw their support, killing the legislation while blaming it on the New Englanders. The goal was to write a bill so bad\u2014so \"abominable\"\u2014that it would never pass but would help Van Buren and the Southerners while hurting the Adams-Clay coalition.\nBill passage.\nThe House committee drafted a bill that imposed very high duties on raw materials, including iron, hemp (for rope) and flax, but eliminated the protective features on woolen goods. The alliance organized by Van Buren that included the middle states and the south voted down every attempt by New Englanders to amend the bill. The alliance was confident the bill was so unfavorable that it would be defeated in Congress, hurting Adams and Clay in the process. To the astonishment of the alliance, a substantial minority of New England's members of Congress voted for the final bill, on the grounds that the principle of protection was of enormous value (and to agree with the Southerners). The bill passed the house 105 to 94 on April 23 and passed the Senate 26 to 21 on May 13. President Adams signed it and the tariff became law. Adams became a hated man in the South.\nFarmers in Western states and manufacturers in the Mid-Atlantic states argued that the strengthening of the nation was in the interest of the entire country. This same reasoning swayed two-fifths of U.S. Representatives in the New England states to vote for the tariff increase. In 1824, New England was on the verge of bankruptcy due to the influx of the use of European cloth. New England was in favor of the tariff increase for entering goods from Europe to aid in the country's economic success.\nA substantial minority of New England Congressmen (41%) saw what they believed to be long-term national benefits of an increased tariff, and voted for it; they believed the tariff would strengthen the manufacturing industry nationally (see table).\nThe Democratic Party had miscalculated: despite the insertion by Democrats of import duties calculated to be unpalatable to New England industries, most specifically on raw wool imports, essential to the wool textile industry, the New Englanders failed to sink the legislation, and the Southerners' plan backfired.\nThe 1828 tariff was signed by President Adams, although he realized it could weaken him politically. In the presidential election of 1828, Andrew Jackson defeated Adams with a popular tally of 642,553 votes and an electoral count of 178 as opposed to Adams's 500,897 tally and 83 electoral votes.\nEffects of the tariff in 1828.\nVice President John C. Calhoun of South Carolina strongly opposed the tariff, anonymously authoring a pamphlet in December 1828 titled the \"South Carolina Exposition and Protest\", in which he urged nullification of the tariff within South Carolina. The South Carolina legislature, although it printed and distributed 5,000 copies of the pamphlet, took none of the legislative action that the pamphlet urged.\nThe expectation of the tariff's opponents was that with the election of Jackson in 1828, the tariff would be significantly reduced. Jackson in 1829 said the 1828 tariff was constitutional. In response, the most radical faction in South Carolina began to advocate that the state itself declare the tariff null and void within South Carolina.\nIn Washington, an open split on the issue occurred between Jackson and Vice-President Calhoun. On July 14, 1832, Jackson signed into law the Tariff of 1832 which made some reductions in tariff rates. Calhoun finally resigned.\nThe reductions were too little for South Carolina\u2014the \"abominations\" of 1828 were still there. In November 1832 the state called for a convention. By a vote of 136 to 26, the convention overwhelmingly adopted an ordinance of nullification drawn by Chancellor William Harper. It declared that the tariffs of both 1828 and 1832 were unconstitutional and unenforceable in South Carolina. President Jackson could not tolerate the nullification of a federal law by a state. He threatened war with South Carolina and Congress passed the Force Act. Cooler heads ultimately prevailed; the tariff was reduced. Thereafter, South Carolina withdrew its nullification of the tariff, but nullified the Force Act. When the federal government dispersed surplus revenue to the States, South Carolina rejected its portion out of principle. The nullification crisis was resolved with the Tariff of 1833, a compromise.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Calhoun and other leading South Carolinians. Among other things, the legislation stipulated that the president could, if he deemed it necessary, deploy the U.S. Army to force South Carolina to comply with the law.\nThe relevant sections of the Force Bill are:\nBackground behind implementation.\nSouth Carolina had been sorely disappointed by negotiations surrounding the Tariffs of 1828 and 1832. The state declared the two acts unconstitutional and refused to collect federal import tariffs. President Andrew Jackson saw the nullification doctrine as being equivalent to treason.\nIn an early draft of what would eventually become his \"Proclamation to the People of South Carolina\" on December 10, 1832, Jackson declared to the South Carolina government:\nSeduced as you have been, my fellow countrymen by the delusion theories and misrepresentation of ambitious, \"deluded\" &amp; designing men, I call upon you in the language of truth, and with the feelings of a Father to retrace your steps. As you value liberty and the blessings of peace blot out from the page of your history a record so fatal to their security as this ordinance will become if it be obeyed. Rally again under the banners of the union whose obligations you in common with all your countrymen have, with an appeal to heaven, sworn to support, and which must be indissoluble as long as we are capable of enjoying freedom. Recollect that the first act of resistance to the laws which have been denounced as void by those who abuse your confidence and falsify your hopes is Treason, and subjects you to all the pains and penalties that are provided for the highest offence against your country. Can (you)...consent to become Traitors? Forbid it Heaven!\nMeanwhile, Congress passed the Force Bill, which was enacted on March 2, 1833. It authorized the president to use whatever force he deemed necessary to enforce federal tariffs. As a matter of principle, the South Carolina legislature voted to nullify the Force Bill, but simultaneously, a Compromise Tariff was passed by Congress, defusing the crisis.\nWhile the Force Bill rejected the concept of individual states' rights to nullify federal law or to secede from the Union, this was not universally accepted. It would arise again in the buildup to the American Civil War.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

First passed in 1836 and renewed in some form in every legislative session until its repeal in 1844, the gag rule played a key role in escalating sectional tensions over slavery and galvanizing support for its abolition.\nBackground.\nCongress regularly received petitions asking for various types of relief or action. Before the gag rules, House rules required that the first thirty days of each session of Congress be devoted to the reading of petitions from constituents. Each petition was read aloud, printed, and assigned to an appropriate committee, which could choose to address or ignore it. After those thirty days, petitions were read in the House every other Monday.\nThis procedure became unworkable in 1835, when, at the instigation of the new American Anti-Slavery Society, petitions arrived in Congress in quantities never before seen. Over the gag rule period, well over 1,000 petitions, with 130,000 signatures, poured into the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate praying for the abolition or the restriction of that allegedly beneficial \"peculiar institution\", as it was called in the South. There was a special focus on slavery in the District of Columbia, where policy was a federal, rather than state, matter. The petitions also asked Congress to use its Constitutional power to regulate interstate commerce to end the interstate slave trade. These petitions were usually presented by former president John Quincy Adams, who, as a member of the House of Representatives from strongly anti-slavery Massachusetts, identified particularly with the struggle against any Congressional abridgement of the right of citizens to petition the government.\nPro-slavery politicians controlled Congress and responded to this influx of petitions with a series of gag rules that, much to the disgust of Northerners, automatically \"tabled\" all such petitions, prohibiting them from being printed, read, discussed, or voted on, stating that \"the effect of these petitions was to create much irritation and ill feeling between different parts of the Union.\"\nPinckney Resolutions (1836).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Hidden begin/styles.css\"/&gt;Events leading to the American Civil War\nThe House of Representatives passed the Pinckney Resolutions, authored by Henry L. Pinckney of South Carolina, on May 26, 1836. The first stated that Congress had no constitutional authority to interfere with slavery in the states, and the second that it \"ought not\" to interfere with slavery in the District of Columbia. The third was known from the beginning as the \"gag rule\", and passed with a vote of 117 to 68:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;All petitions, memorials, resolutions, propositions, or papers, relating in any way, or to any extent whatsoever, to the subject of slavery or the abolition of slavery, shall, without being either printed or referred, be laid on the table and...no further action whatever shall be had thereon.\nFrom the inception of the gag resolutions, Adams was a central figure in the opposition to them. He argued that they were a direct violation of the First Amendment right \"to petition the Government for a redress of grievances\". A majority of Northern Whigs supported him. Rather than suppress anti-slavery petitions, however, the gag rules only served to outrage Americans from Northern states, contributing to the country's growing polarization over slavery. The growing objection to the gag rule, as well as the Panic of 1837, may have contributed to the Whig majority in the 27th Congress, the party's first such majority.\nSince the original gag was a resolution, not a standing House Rule, it had to be renewed every session, and Adams and others had free rein at the beginning of each session until this was done. In January 1837, the Pinckney Resolutions were substantially renewed, more than a month into the session. The pro-gag forces gradually succeeded in shortening the debate at the beginning of each session, and tightening the gag.\nUnited States Senate (1836).\nSenator John C. Calhoun of South Carolina attempted to create a Senate gag rule in 1836. The Senate rejected this proposal, which pro-slavery senators thought would have the rebound (reverse) effect of strengthening the abolition movement. They agreed on a method which, while technically not a gag that violated the right to petition, had the same effect. If an anti-slavery petition were presented, the Senate would vote not on whether to accept the petition, but on whether to consider the question of accepting the petition. The Senate never voted in favor of considering the acceptance of any petition.\nPatton (1837) and Atherton (1838) gag rules.\nIn December 1837, the Congress passed the Patton Resolutions, introduced by John M. Patton of Virginia. In December 1838, the Congress passed the Atherton gag, composed by Democratic \"states' rights\" Congressman Charles G. Atherton of New Hampshire, on the first petition day of the session.\nExample of petitions presented on a single day (February 18, 1839).\nFrom December 1838 to March 1839, the Twenty-Fifth Congress received \"almost fifteen hundred petitions signed by more than one hundred thousand people. Eighty percent of the signatories supported abolition in the capital\".\nIt is estimated that by 1840, 415,000 petitions had been submitted to members of Congress.\nTwenty-first rule (1840).\nIn January 1840, the House of Representatives passed the Twenty-first Rule, which greatly changed the nature of the fight: it prohibited even the reception of anti-slavery petitions and was a standing House rule. Before, the pro-slavery forces had to struggle to impose a gag before the anti-slavery forces got the floor. Now men like Adams or William Slade were trying to revoke a standing rule. However, it had less support than the original Pinckney gag, passing only by 114 to 108, with substantial opposition among Northern Democrats and even some Southern Whigs, and with serious doubts about its constitutionality. Throughout the gag period, Adams' \"superior talent in using and abusing parliamentary rules\" and skill in baiting his enemies into making mistakes, enabled him to evade the rule.\nRepeal of the gag rule (1844).\nThe gag was finally rescinded on December 3, 1844, by a vote of 108\u201380, all the Northern and four Southern Whigs voting for repeal, along with 78% of the Northern Democrats. It was John Quincy Adams who wrote the repeal resolution and created the coalition necessary to pass it.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It required payment for government land to be in gold and silver (specie). It was repealed by a joint act of Congress on 21 May 1838.\nHistory.\nThe Specie Circular was a reaction to the growing concerns about excessive speculations of land after the Indian removal, which was mostly done with soft currency. The sale of public lands increased five times between 1834 and 1836. Speculators paid for these purchases with depreciating paper money. While government law already demanded that land purchases be completed with specie or paper notes from specie-backed banks, a large portion of buyers used paper money from state banks not backed by hard money as a consequence of Jackson's veto of the rechartering of the Second Bank of the United States.\nExecutive order.\nOn July 11, 1836, Jackson ordered Secretary of the Treasury Levi Woodbury to issue the Specie Circular under federal law whereby the government refused to take anything but gold and silver specie for sales of public lands of over 320 acres after August 15, 1836. It did make a special exception to accept certain types of Virginia scrip. The executive order allowed legitimate settlers (non-speculators, or those purchasing plots of 320 acres or less) to use paper until December 15, 1836.\nConsequences.\nBecause the order was one of Jackson's last acts in office, most of its consequences occurred during and were attributed to the presidency of Martin Van Buren. The devaluation of paper currency only increased with Jackson's proclamation. This sent inflation and prices upwards. Many at the time (and historians subsequently) blamed the Specie Circular for the rise in prices and the following Panic of 1837. Cries of \"Rescind the circular!\" went up and former President Jackson sent word to Van Buren asking him not to rescind the order. Jackson believed that it had to be given enough time to work. Lobbying efforts, especially by bankers, increased in Washington in an attempt to revoke the Specie Circular. Others, like Nicholas Biddle, believed that Jackson's defeat of the Second Bank of the United States was directly responsible for the irresponsible creation of paper money by the state banks which had precipitated this crisis.\nThe restrictions on credit caused by the order resulted in numerous bankruptcies and the failure of smaller banks. In the South the resulting recession drove down cotton prices well into the 1840s. Small farmers who had bought land on credit were unable to meet their loan repayments with their income from staple crops cut by a half. When they defaulted, \"[t]heir land and slaves were repossessed and sold at auction, usually to already well-established slaveholders. ... Some farmers were able to keep a few acres and eke out a living as lesser yeomen. But many lost everything and fell into tenancy and sharecropping. When the cotton market finally recovered, affluent slaveholders held nearly all the South\u2019s best land.\"\nDemocratic split.\nThe Democratic party split in two ways regarding the order. Some, like Thomas Hart Benton, supported the use of sound money. The Locofoco wing of the party also agreed with Benton. Senators Nathaniel P. Tallmadge and William C. Rives supported the other side of the party, in favor of paper money. Senator John Pendleton King of Georgia blamed Jackson for the effects of the circular (among other policies), stating in an 1837 speech that he \"had not the slightest doubt that our present difficulties were owing entirely to the unfortunate policy and violent measures of the Executive for several years past. This was the only cause, and this was abundantly sufficient.\" In the United States House of Representatives, John Bell even challenged his own party member, James K. Polk, for his position as Speaker of the House of Representatives over the issue.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The conflict over the Wilmot Proviso was one of the major events leading to the American Civil War.\nCongressman David Wilmot of Pennsylvania first introduced the proviso in the House of Representatives on August 8, 1846, as a rider on a $2,000,000 appropriations bill intended for the final negotiations to resolve the Mexican\u2013American War (this was only three months into the two-year war). It passed the House largely on sectional lines between a generally anti-slavery North in favor and a pro-slavery South against, foreshadowing coming conflicts. It failed in the Senate, where the South had greater representation. The proviso was reintroduced in February 1847 and again passed the House and failed in the Senate. In 1848, an attempt to make it part of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo also failed. Sectional political disputes over slavery in the Southwest continued through the Compromise of 1850.\nBackground.\nAfter an earlier attempt to acquire Texas by treaty had failed to receive the necessary two-thirds approval of the Senate, the United States annexed the Republic of Texas by a joint resolution of Congress that required simply a majority vote in each house of Congress. President John Tyler signed the bill on March 1, 1845, a few days before his term ended. As many expected, the annexation led to war with Mexico. After the Capture of New Mexico and California in the first phases of the war, the political focus shifted to how much territory would be acquired from Mexico. The key to this was the determination of the future status of slavery in any new territory.\nBoth major political parties had labored long to keep divisive slavery issues out of national politics. The Democrats had generally been successful in portraying those within their party attempting to push a purely sectional issue as extremists that were well outside the normal scope of traditional politics. However, midway through Polk's term, Democratic dissatisfaction with the administration was growing within the Martin Van Buren, or Barnburner, wing of the Democratic Party over other issues. Many felt that Van Buren had been unfairly denied the party's nomination in 1844 when southern delegates resurrected a convention rule, last used in 1832, requiring that the nominee had to receive two-thirds of the delegate votes. Many in the North were also upset with the Walker tariff which reduced the tariff rates; others were opposed to Polk's veto of a popular river and harbor improvements bill, and still others were upset over the Oregon settlement with Great Britain where it appeared that Polk did not pursue the northern territory with the same vigor he used to acquire Texas. Polk was seen more and more as enforcing strict party loyalty primarily to serve southern interests.\nThe Whigs faced a different scenario. The narrow victory of James K. Polk (Democrat) over Henry Clay (Whig) in the 1844 presidential election had caught the Southern Whigs by surprise. The key element of this defeat, which carried over into the congressional and local races in 1845 and 1846 throughout the South, was the party's failure to take a strong stand favoring Texas annexation. Southern Whigs were reluctant to repeat their mistakes on Texas, but, at the same time, Whigs from both sections realized that victory and territorial acquisition would again bring out the issue of slavery and the territories. In the South in particular, there was already the realization, or perhaps fear, that the old economic issues that had defined the Second Party System were already dead. Their political goal was to avoid any sectional debate over slavery which would expose the sectional divisions within the party.\nThe Mexican\u2013American War was seen by many as an effort to gain more territory for the establishment of slave states. It was popular in the South, and much less so in the North, where opposition took many forms. For example, Henry David Thoreau refused to pay his poll tax, arguing that the money would be used to prosecute the war and gain slave territory.\nIntroduction and debate on the proviso.\nOn Saturday, August 8, 1846, President Polk submitted to Congress a request for $2,000,000 (~$ in 2024) in order to facilitate negotiations with Mexico over the final settlement of the war. The request came with no public warning after Polk had failed to arrange for approval of the bill with no Congressional debate. With Congress scheduled to adjourn that Monday, Democratic leadership arranged for the bill to be immediately considered in a special night session. The debate was to be limited to two hours with no individual speech to last more than ten minutes.\nDavid Wilmot, a Democratic congressman from Pennsylvania, and a group of other Barnburner Democrats including Preston King and Timothy Jenkins of New York, Hannibal Hamlin of Maine, Gideon Welles of Connecticut, and Jacob Brinkerhoff of Ohio, had already been meeting in early August strategy meetings. Wilmot had a strong record of supporting the Polk Administration and was close to many Southerners. With the likelihood that Wilmot would have no trouble gaining the floor in the House debate, he was chosen to present the amendment to the appropriations bill that would carry his name. Wilmot offered the following to the House in language modeled after the Northwest Ordinance of 1787:\nProvided, That, as an express and fundamental condition to the acquisition of any territory from the Republic of Mexico by the United States, by virtue of any treaty which may be negotiated between them, and to the use by the Executive of the moneys herein appropriated, neither slavery nor involuntary servitude shall ever exist in any part of said territory, except for crime, whereof the party shall first be duly convicted.\nWilliam W. Wick, Democrat of Indiana, attempted to eliminate total restriction of slavery by proposing an amendment that the Missouri Compromise line of latitude 36\u00b030' simply be extended west to the Pacific. This was voted down 89\u201354. The vote to add the proviso to the bill was then called, and it passed by 83\u201364. A last-ditch effort by southerners to table the entire bill was defeated by 94\u201378, and then the entire bill was approved 85\u201380. These votes fell overwhelmingly along sectional rather than party lines.\nThe Senate took up the bill late in its Monday session. Southern Democrats hoped to reject the Wilmot Proviso and send the bill back to the House for a quick approval of the bill without the restrictions on slavery. Whig John Davis of Massachusetts attempted to forestall this effort by holding the floor until it would be too late to return the bill to the House, forcing the Senate to accept or reject the appropriation with the proviso intact. However, before he could call the vote, due to an eight-minute difference in the official House and Senate clocks, the House had adjourned and the Congress was officially out of session.\nThe issue resurfaced at the end of the year when Polk, in his annual message to Congress, renewed his request with the amount needed increasing to three million dollars. Polk argued that, while the original intent of the war had never been to acquire territory (a view hotly contested by his opponents), an honorable peace required territorial compensation to the United States. The Three Million Dollar Bill, as it was called, was the sole item of business in the House from February 8, 1847, until February 15. Preston King reintroduced the Wilmot Proviso, but this time the exclusion of slavery was expanded beyond merely the Mexican territory to include \"any territory on the continent of America which shall hereafter be acquired\". This time Representative Stephen Douglas, Democrat of Illinois, reintroduced the proposal to simply extend the Missouri Compromise line to the west coast, and this was again defeated 109\u201382. The Three Million Dollar Bill with the proviso was then passed by the House 115\u2013106. In the Senate, led by Thomas Hart Benton (Democrat), the bill was passed without the proviso. When the bill was returned to the House the Senate bill prevailed; every Northern Whig still supported the proviso, but 22 Northern Democrats voted with the South.\nIn 1848, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ending the war was submitted to the Senate for approval. Douglas, now in the Senate, was among those who joined with the South to defeat an effort to attach the Wilmot Proviso to the treaty. In the prior year's debate in the House, Douglas had argued that all of the debate over slavery in the territories was premature; the time to deal with that issue was when the territory was actually organized by Congress. Lewis Cass (Democrat) in December 1847, in his famous letter to A. O. P. Nicholson in Tennessee, further underlined the principle of appealing to popular sovereignty which would soon evolve as the mainstream Democratic alternative to the Wilmot Proviso:\nLeave it to the people, who will be affected by this question to adjust it upon their own responsibility, and in their own manner, and we shall render another tribute to the original principles of our government, and furnish another for its permanence and prosperity.\nAftermath.\nWith the approval of the treaty, the issue moved from one of abstraction to one involving practical matters. The nature of the Constitution, slavery, the value of free labor, political power, and ultimately political realignment were all involved in the debate. Historian Michael Morrison argues that from 1820 to 1846 a combination of \"racism and veneration of the Union\" had prevented a direct Northern attack on slavery. While the original Southern response to the Wilmot Proviso was measured, it soon became clear to the South that this long postponed attack on slavery had finally occurred. Rather than simply discuss the politics of the issue, historian William Freehling noted, \"Most Southerners raged primarily because David Wilmot's holier-than-thou stance was so insulting.\"\nIn the North, the most immediate repercussions involved Martin Van Buren and the state of New York. The Barnburners were successfully opposed by their conservative opposition, the Hunkers, in their efforts to send a pro-proviso batch of delegates to the 1848 Democratic National Convention. The Barnburners held their own separate convention and sent their own slate of delegates to the convention in Baltimore. Both delegations were seated with the state's total votes split between them. When the convention rejected a pro-proviso plank and selected Lewis Cass as the nominee, the Barnburners again bolted and were the nucleus of forming the Free Soil Party. Historian Leonard Richards writes of these disaffected Democrats:\nOverall, then, Southern Democrats during the 1840s lost the hard core of their original doughface support. No longer could they count on New England and New York Democrats to provide them with winning margins in the House. ...To them [Free Soil Democrats] the movement to acquire Texas, and the fight over the Wilmot Proviso, marked the turning point, when aggressive slavemasters stole the heart and soul of the Democratic Party and began dictating the course of the nation's destiny.\nHistorian William Cooper presents the exactly opposite Southern perspective:\nSouthern Democrats, for whom slavery had always been central, had little difficulty in perceiving exactly what the proviso meant for them and their party. In the first place the mere existence of the proviso meant the sectional strains that had plagued the Whigs on Texas now beset the Democrats on expansion, the issue the Democrats themselves had chosen as their own. The proviso also announced to southerners that they had to face the challenge of certain northern Democrats who indicated their unwillingness to follow any longer the southern lead on slavery. That circumstance struck at the very roots of the southern conception of party. The southerners had always felt that their Northern colleagues must toe the southern line on all slavery-related issues.\nIn Alabama, with no available candidate sufficiently opposed to the proviso, William L. Yancey secured the adoption by the state Democratic convention of the so-called \"Alabama Platform\", which was endorsed by the legislatures of Alabama and Georgia and by Democratic state conventions in Florida and Virginia. The platform called for no federal restrictions of slavery in the territories, no restrictions on slavery by territorial governments until the point where they were drafting a state constitution in order to petition Congress for statehood, opposition to any candidates supporting either the proviso or popular sovereignty, and positive federal legislation overruling Mexican anti-slavery laws in the Mexican Cession. However, the same Democratic Convention that had refused to endorse the proviso also rejected incorporating the Yancey proposal into the national platform by a 216\u201336 vote. Unlike the Barnburner walkout, however, only Yancey and one other Alabama delegate left the convention. Yancey's efforts to stir up a third party movement in the state failed.\nSoutherner Whigs looked hopefully to slaveholder and war hero General Zachary Taylor as the solution to the widening sectional divide even though he took no public stance on the Wilmot Proviso. However, Taylor, once nominated and elected, showed that he had his own plans. Taylor hoped to create a new non-partisan coalition that would once again remove slavery from the national stage. He expected to be able to accomplish this by freezing slavery at its 1849 boundaries and by immediately bypassing the territory stage and creating two new states out of the Mexican Cession.\nThe opening salvo in a new level of sectional conflict occurred on December 13, 1848, when John G. Palfrey (Whig) of Massachusetts introduced a bill to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia. Throughout 1849 in the South \"the rhetoric of resistance to the North escalated and spread\". The potentially secessionist Nashville Convention was scheduled for June 1850. When President Taylor in his December 1849 message to Congress urged the admission of California as a free state, a state of crisis was further aggravated. Historian Allan Nevins sums up the situation which had been created by the Wilmot Proviso:\nThus the contest was joined on the central issue which was to dominate all American history for the next dozen years, the disposition of the Territories. Two sets of extremists had arisen: Northerners who demanded no new slave territories under any circumstances, and Southerners who demanded free entry for slavery into all territories, the penalty for denial to be secession. For the time being, moderates who hoped to find a way of compromise and to repress the underlying issue of slavery itself \u2013 its toleration or non-toleration by a great free Christian state \u2013 were overwhelmingly in the majority. But history showed that in crises of this sort the two sets of extremists were almost certain to grow in power, swallowing up more and more members of the conciliatory center.\nCombined with other slavery-related issues, the Wilmot Proviso led to the Compromise of 1850, which helped buy another uncertain decade of peace. Radical secessionists were temporarily at bay as the Nashville Convention failed to endorse secession. Moderates rallied around the Compromise as the final solution to the sectional issues involving slavery and the territories. At the same time, however, the language of the Georgia Platform, widely accepted throughout the South, made it clear that the South's commitment to Union was not unqualified; they fully expected the North to adhere to their part of the agreement.\nIn regard to the territory the Proviso would have covered, California had a brief period of slavery due to slave owning settlers arriving during the 1848 California Gold Rush. Since there were no slave patrols or laws protecting slavery in the territory, slave escapes were quite common. Ultimately, California decided to ban slavery in their 1849 constitution and was admitted to the Union as a free state in 1850. Nevada would never have legal slavery and was admitted to the Union as a free state in 1864. The territories of Utah and New Mexico would have slavery from the time they were acquired by America in 1848 until July 1862, when the United States banned slavery in all federal territories. However, Utah had just 29 slaves (0.07% of the total population) and New Mexico had no slaves in the 1860 census.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Full employment does not entail the disappearance of all unemployment, as other kinds of unemployment, namely structural and frictional, may remain. Full employment does not entail 100% employment-to-population ratio. For instance, workers who are \"between jobs\" for short periods of time as they search for better employment are not counted against full employment, as such unemployment is frictional rather than cyclical. An economy with full employment might also have unemployment or underemployment where part-time workers cannot find jobs appropriate to their skill level, as such unemployment is considered structural rather than cyclical. Full employment marks the point past which expansionary fiscal and/or monetary policy cannot reduce unemployment any further without causing inflation.\nSome economists define full employment somewhat differently, as the unemployment rate at which inflation does not continuously increase. Advocacy of avoiding accelerating inflation is based on a theory centered on the concept of the Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment (NAIRU) and those who hold it usually mean NAIRU when speaking of full employment. The NAIRU has also been described by Milton Friedman, among others, as the \"natural\" rate of unemployment. Such views tend to emphasize sustainability, noting that a government cannot sustain unemployment rates below the NAIRU forever: inflation will continue to grow so long as unemployment lies below the NAIRU.\nFor the United States, economist William T. Dickens found that full-employment unemployment rate varied a lot over time but equaled about 5.5 percent of the civilian labor force during the 2000s. Recently, economists have emphasized the idea that full employment represents a \"range\" of possible unemployment rates. For example, in 1999, in the United States, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) gives an estimate of the \"full-employment unemployment rate\" of 4 to 6.4%. This is the estimated unemployment rate at full employment, plus or minus the standard error of the estimate.\nThe concept of full employment of labor corresponds to the concept of potential output or potential real GDP and the long run aggregate supply (LRAS) curve. In neoclassical macroeconomics, the highest sustainable level of aggregate real GDP or \"potential\" is seen as corresponding to a vertical LRAS curve: any increase in the demand for real GDP can only lead to rising prices in the long run, while any increase in output is temporary.\nEconomic concept.\nWhat most neoclassical economists mean by \"full\" employment is a rate somewhat less than 100% employment. Others, such as the late James Tobin, have been accused of disagreeing, considering full employment as 0% unemployment. However, this was not Tobin's perspective in his later work.\nSome see John Maynard Keynes as attacking the existence of rates of unemployment substantially above 0%:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Conservative belief that there is some law of nature which prevents men from being employed, that it is 'rash' to employ men, and that it is financially 'sound' to maintain a tenth of the population in idleness for an indefinite period, is crazily improbable \u2013 the sort of thing which no man could believe who had not had his head fuddled with nonsense for years and years. The objections which are raised are mostly not the objections of experience or of practical men. They are based on highly abstract theories \u2013 venerable, academic inventions, half misunderstood by those who are applying them today, and based on assumptions which are contrary to the facts\u2026 Our main task, therefore, will be to confirm the reader's instinct that what seems sensible is sensible, and what seems nonsense is nonsense.\u2014\u200a\nMost readers would interpret this statement as referring to only cyclical, deficient-demand, or \"involuntary unemployment\" (discussed below) but not to unemployment existing as \"full employment\" (mismatch and frictional unemployment). This is because, writing in 1929, Keynes was discussing a period in which the unemployment rate had been persistently above most conceptions of what corresponds to full employment. That is, a situation where a tenth of the population (and thus a larger percentage of the labor force) is unemployed involves a disaster.\nOne major difference between Keynes and the Classical economists was that while the latter saw \"full employment\" as the normal state of affairs with a free-market economy (except for short periods of adjustment), Keynes saw the possibility of persistent aggregate-demand failure causing unemployment rates to exceed those corresponding to full employment. Put differently, while Classical economists saw all unemployment as \"voluntary\", Keynes saw the possibility that involuntary unemployment can exist when the demand for final products is low compared to potential output.\nThis can be seen in his later and more serious work. In his \"General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money\", chapter 2, he used a definition that should be familiar to modern macroeconomics:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;This state of affairs we shall describe as \"full\" employment, both \"frictional\" and \"voluntary\" unemployment being consistent with \"full\" employment thus defined.\nThe only difference from the usual definitions is that, as discussed below, most economists would add skill/location mismatch or structural unemployment as existing at full employment. More theoretically, Keynes had two main definitions of full employment, which he saw as equivalent. His first main definition of full employment involves the absence of involuntary unemployment:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;the equality of the real wage to the marginal disutility of employment ... realistically interpreted, corresponds to the absence of \"involuntary\" unemployment.\nPut another way, the full employment and the absence of involuntary unemployment correspond to the case where the real wage equals the marginal cost to workers of supplying labor for hire on the market (the \"marginal disutility of employment\"). That is, the real wage rate and the amount of employment correspond to a point on the aggregate supply curve of labor that is assumed to exist. In contrast, a situation with less than full employment and thus involuntary unemployment would have the real wage above the supply price of labor. That is, the employment situation corresponds to a point above and to the left of the aggregate supply curve of labor: the real wage would be above the point on the aggregate supply curve of labor at the current level of employment; alternatively, the level of employment would be below the point on that supply curve at the current real wage.\nSecond, in chapter 3, Keynes saw full employment as a situation where \"a further increase in the value of the effective demand will no longer be accompanied by any increase in output.\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In the previous chapter we have given a definition of full employment in terms of the behavior of labor. An alternative, though equivalent, criterion is that at which we have now arrived, namely a situation, in which aggregate employment is inelastic in response to an increase in the effective demand for its output.\nThis means that at and above full employment, any increase in aggregate demand and employment corresponds primarily to increases in prices rather than output. Thus, full employment of labor corresponds to potential output.\nWhilst full employment is often an aim for an economy, most economists see it as more beneficial to have some level of unemployment, especially of the frictional sort. In theory, this keeps the labor market flexible, allowing room for new innovations and investment. As in the NAIRU theory, the existence of some unemployment is required to avoid accelerating inflation.\nUncertainty.\nWhatever the definition of full employment, it is difficult to discover exactly what unemployment rate it corresponds to. In the United States, for example, the economy saw stable inflation \"despite\" low unemployment during the late 1990s, contradicting most economists' estimates of the NAIRU.\nThe idea that the full-employment unemployment rate (NAIRU) is not a unique number has been seen in recent empirical research. Staiger, Stock, and Watson found that the range of possible values of the NAIRU (from 4.3 to 7.3% unemployment) was too large to be useful to macroeconomic policy-makers. Robert Eisner suggested that for 1956\u20131995 there was a zone from about 5% to about 10% unemployment between the low-unemployment realm of accelerating inflation and the high-unemployment realm of disinflation. In between, he found that inflation falls with falling unemployment.\nMeasurement.\nFor the United Kingdom, the OECD estimated the NAIRU (or structural unemployment) rate as being equal to 8.5% on average between 1988 and 1997, 5.9% between 1998 and 2007, 6.2%, 6.6%, and 6.7 in 2008, 2009, and 2010, then staying at 6.9% in 2011\u20132013. For the United States, they estimate it as being 5.8% on average between 1988 and 1997, 5.5% between 1998 and 2007, 5.8% in 2008, 6.0% in 2009, and then staying at 6.1% from 2010 to 2013. They also estimate the NAIRU for other countries. These calculations have been criticised as lacking any foundation in evidence.\nThe era after the 2007\u20132009 Great Recession shows the relevance of this concept, for example as seen in the United States. On the one hand, in 2013 Keynesian economists such as Paul Krugman of Princeton University see unemployment rates as too high relative to full employment and the NAIRU and thus favor increasing the aggregate demand for goods and services and thus labor in order to reduce unemployment. On the other hand, pointing to shortages of some skilled workers, some businesspeople and Classical economists suggest that the U.S. economy is already at full employment, so that any demand stimulus will lead to nothing but rising inflation rates. One example was Narayana Kocherlakota, President of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank, who has since changed his mind.\nUnemployment.\nWilliam Beveridge defined \"full employment\" as where the number of unemployed workers equaled the number of job vacancies available (while preferring that the economy be kept above that full employment level in order to allow maximum economic production).\nThis definition allows for certain kinds of unemployment, where the number of unemployed workers equals the number of vacancies. Unemployment of this kind can take two forms: frictional and structural. Frictional unemployment is where the unemployed are searching for the best possible jobs whilst employers are also searching for the best possible employees to fulfil those jobs. Structural unemployment exists when the skills and geographical locations of the unemployed workers do not correspond to the skill requirements and locations of the vacancies. In either case, there exists a job for every worker, and a worker for every job.\nAn economy with less than full employment in Beveridge's sense will have either classical unemployment, cyclical unemployment, or both. Classical unemployment results from the actual real wage rising above the equilibrium real wage, so that the quantity of labor demanded (and the number of vacancies) is less than the quantity of labor supplied (and the number of unemployed workers). This might occur because of inefficient interference in the market; for example, a minimum wage set above the equilibrium wage; but also because of market failure, such as that caused by cartels.\nUnder classical unemployment, the ways by which a return to Beveridge full employment can occur depend on the nature of the rise in wages- if it is only \"nominal\" wages that are rigid (failing to return to equilibrium), then real wages can decrease if prices rise relative to the rigid nominal wages. If nominal wages track price levels, however, then changes to prices will not affect the real wage- and thus employment will remain below Beveridge full employment.\nCyclical, deficient-demand, or Keynesian unemployment occurs when there is not enough aggregate demand in the economy to provide jobs for everyone who wants to work. If demand for most goods and services falls, less production is needed and consequently fewer workers are needed: if wages are sticky and do not fall to meet the new equilibrium level, unemployment results, because (as with classical unemployment) there are more prospective workers than there are vacancies.\nRelation to inflation.\nThe theories behind the Phillips curve point to the inflationary costs of lowering the unemployment rate. That is, as unemployment rates fell and the economy approached full employment, the inflation rate would rise. But this theory also says that there is no single unemployment number that one can point to as the \"full employment\" rate. Instead, there is a trade-off between unemployment and inflation: a government might choose to attain a lower unemployment rate but would pay for it with higher inflation rates. In essence, in this view, the meaning of \"full employment\" is really nothing but a matter of opinion based on how the benefits of lowering the unemployment rate compare to the costs of raising the inflation rate.\nThough their theory had been proposed by the Keynesian economist Abba Lerner several years before, it was the work of Milton Friedman, leader of the monetarist school of economics, and Edmund Phelps that ended the popularity of this concept of full employment. In 1968, Friedman posited the theory that full employment rate of unemployment was \"unique\" at any given time. He called it the \"natural\" rate of unemployment. Instead of being a matter of opinion and normative judgment, it is something we are stuck with, even if it is unknown. As discussed further, below, inflation/unemployment trade-offs cannot be relied upon. Further, rather than trying to attain full employment, Friedman argues that policy-makers should try to keep prices stable (meaning a low or even a zero inflation rate). If this policy is sustained, he suggests that a free-market economy will gravitate to the \"natural\" rate of unemployment automatically.\nNAIRU.\nIn an effort to avoid the normative connotations of the word \"natural\", James Tobin (following the lead of Franco Modigliani), introduced the term the \"non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment\" (NAIRU), which corresponds to the situation where the real gross domestic product equals potential output. It has been called the \"inflation threshold\" unemployment rate or the inflation barrier. This concept is identical to Milton Friedman's concept of the \"natural\" rate but reflects the fact that there is nothing \"natural\" about an economy. The level of the NAIRU depends on the degree of \"supply side\" unemployment, i.e., joblessness that can't be abolished by high demand. This includes frictional, mismatch, and Classical unemployment. When the actual unemployment rate equals the NAIRU, there is no cyclical or deficient-demand unemployment. That is, Keynes' involuntary unemployment does not exist.\nTo understand this concept, start with the actual unemployment equal to the NAIRU. Then, assume that a country's government and its central bank use demand-side policy to reduce the unemployment rate and then attempt to keep the rate at a specific low level: rising budget deficits or falling interest rates increase aggregate demand and raise employment of labor. Thus, the actual unemployment rate falls, as going from point \"A\" to \"B\" in the nearby graph. Unemployment then stays below the NAIRU for years or more, as at point \"B\". In this situation, the theory behind the NAIRU posits that inflation will accelerate, i.e. get worse and worse (in the absence of wage and price controls). As the short-run Phillips curve theory indicates, higher inflation rate results from low unemployment. That is, in terms of the \"trade-off\" theory, low unemployment can be \"bought\", paid for by suffering from higher inflation. But the NAIRU theory says that this is not the whole story, so that the trade-off breaks down: a persistently higher inflation rate is eventually incorporated as higher \"inflationary expectations\". Then, if workers and employers expect higher inflation, it results in higher inflation, as higher money wages are passed on to consumers as higher prices. This causes the short run Phillips curve to shift to the right and upward, worsening the trade-off between inflation and unemployment. At a given unemployment rate, inflation accelerates. But if the unemployment rate rises to equal the NAIRU, we see higher inflation than before the expansionary policies, as at point \"C\" in the nearby diagram. The fall of the unemployment rate was temporary because it could not be sustained. In sum, the trade-off between inflation and unemployment cannot be relied upon to be stable: taking advantage of it causes it to disappear. This story fits the experience of the United States during the late 1960s, during which unemployment rates stayed low (below 4% of the civilian labor force) and inflation rates rose significantly.\nSecond, examine the other main case. Again start with the unemployment rate equal to the NAIRU. Then, either shrinking government budget deficits (or rising government surpluses) or rising real interest rates encourage higher unemployment. In this situation, the NAIRU theory says that inflation will get better (decelerate) if unemployment rates exceed the NAIRU for a long time. High unemployment leads to lower inflation, which in turn causes lower inflationary expectations and a further round of lower inflation. High unemployment causes the short-run inflation/unemployment trade-off to improve. This story fits the experience of the United States during the early 1980s (Paul Volcker's war against inflation), during which unemployment rates stayed high (at about 10% of the civilian labor force) and inflation rates fell significantly.\nFinally, the NAIRU theory says that the inflation rate does not rise or fall when the unemployment equals the \"natural\" rate. This is where the term NAIRU is derived. In macroeconomics, the case where the actual unemployment rate equals the NAIRU is seen as the long-run equilibrium because there are no forces inside the normal workings of the economy that cause the inflation rate to rise or fall. The NAIRU corresponds to the \"long-run Phillips curve\". While the short-run Phillips curve is based on a constant rate of inflationary expectations, the long-run Phillips curve reflects full adjustment of inflationary expectations to the actual experience of inflation in the economy.\nAs mentioned above, Abba Lerner had developed a version of the NAIRU before the modern \"natural\" rate or NAIRU theories were developed. Unlike the currently dominant view, Lerner saw a range of \"full employment\" unemployment rates. Crucially, the unemployment rate depended on the economy's institution. Lerner distinguished between \"high\" full employment, which was the lowest sustainable unemployment under incomes policies, and \"low\" full employment, i.e., the lowest sustainable unemployment rate without these policies.\nFurther, it is possible that the value of the NAIRU depends on government policy, rather than being \"natural\" and unvarying. A government can attempt to make people \"employable\" by both positive means (e.g. using training courses) and negative means (e.g. cuts in unemployment insurance benefits). These policies do not necessarily create full employment. Instead, the point is to reduces the amount of mismatch unemployment by facilitating the linking of unemployed workers with the available jobs by training them and or subsidizing their moving to the geographic location of the jobs.\nIn addition, the hysteresis hypothesis says that the NAIRU does not stay the same over time\u2014and can change due to economic policy. A persistently low unemployment rate makes it easier for those workers who are unemployed for \"mismatch\" reasons to move to where the jobs are and/or to attain the training necessary for the available vacancies (often by getting those jobs and receiving on-the-job training). On the other hand, high unemployment makes it more difficult for those workers to adjust, while hurting their morale, job-seeking skills, and the value of their work skills. Thus, some economists argue that British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's anti-inflation policies using persistently high unemployment led to higher mismatch or structural unemployment and a higher NAIRU.\nPolicy.\nThe active pursuit of national full employment through interventionist government policies is associated with Keynesian economics and marked the postwar agenda of many Western nations, until the stagflation of the 1970s. Interventionist full employment policies, targeted especially at young people, remain in place in the Nordic countries. A commitment to full employment was also restored in the United Kingdom under New Labour (1997\u20132010), which manifested in the New Deal which lasted from 1998 until 2010.\nAustralia.\nIn 1945, the government of Australian Labor Party Prime Minister John Curtin submitted to the Parliament of Australia the white paper \"Full Employment in Australia\"; full employment remained the government's policy until 1975.\nUnited States.\nAs economics supplanted political economy, the meaning of full employment shifted from decent jobs for all to a macroeconomic variable of unemployment. The United States is, as a statutory matter, committed to full employment; the government is empowered to effect this goal. The relevant legislation is the Employment Act (1946), initially the \"Full Employment Act,\" later amended in the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act (1978). The 1946 act was passed in the aftermath of World War II, when it was feared that demobilization would result in a depression, as it had following World War I in the Depression of 1920\u201321, while the 1978 act was passed following the 1973\u201375 recession and in the midst of continuing high inflation.\nThe law states that full employment is one of four economic goals, in concert with growth in production, price stability, balance of trade, and budget, and that the US shall rely primarily on private enterprise to achieve these goals. Specifically, the Act is committed to an unemployment rate of no more than 3% for persons aged 20 or over, and not more than 4% for persons aged 16 or over (from 1983 onwards), and the Act expressly \"allows\" (but does not \"require\") the government to create a \"reservoir of public employment\" to affect this level of employment. These jobs are required to be in the lower ranges of skill and pay so as to not draw the workforce away from the private sector.\nHowever, since the passage of this Act in 1978, the US has, as of 2017[ [update]], only briefly achieved this level of employment on the national level in the late 1990s, though some states have neared it or met it, nor has such a reservoir of public employment been created.\nPost-Keynesian policy.\nPost-Keynesian economists have suggested ensuring full employment via a job guarantee program, where those who are unable to find work in the private sector are employed by the government, the stock of thus employed public sector workers fulfilling the same function as the unemployed do in controlling inflation, without the human costs of unemployment.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Developed in 1959 at the University of Michigan by Bernard Galler, Bruce Arden and Robert M. Graham, MAD is a variant of the ALGOL language. It was widely used to teach programming at colleges and universities during the 1960s and played a minor role in the development of Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS), Multics, and the Michigan Terminal System computer operating systems. The original version of the chatbot ELIZA was written in MAD-SLIP.\nThe archives at the Bentley Historical Library of the University of Michigan contain reference materials on the development of MAD and MAD/I, including three linear feet of printouts with hand-written notations and original printed manuals.\nMAD, MAD/I, and GOM.\nThree MAD compilers exist:\nHistory.\nWhile MAD was motivated by ALGOL 58, it does not resemble ALGOL 58 in any significant way.\nPrograms written in MAD included MAIL, RUNOFF, one of the first text processing systems, and several other utilities all under Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS). Work was done on a design for a MAD compiler for Multics, but it was never implemented.\nThe following is an interesting quote from \"An Interview with Brian Kernighan\" when he was asked \"What hooked you on programming?\":\nI think that the most fun I had programming was a summer job at Project MAC at MIT in the summer of 1966, where I worked on a program that created a job tape for the brand new GE 645 in the earliest days of Multics. I was writing in MAD, which was much easier and more pleasant than the FORTRAN and COBOL that I had written earlier, and I was using CTSS, the first time-sharing system, which was infinitely easier and more pleasant than punch cards.\nMAD was quite fast compared to some of the other compilers of its day. Because a number of people were interested in using the FORTRAN language and yet wanted to obtain the speed of the MAD compiler, a system called MADTRAN (written in MAD) was developed. MADTRAN was simply a translator from FORTRAN to MAD, which then produced machine code. MADTRAN was distributed through SHARE.\nMAD/I has a syntactic structure similar to ALGOL 60 together with important features from the original MAD and from PL/I. MAD/I was designed as an extensible language. It was available for use under MTS and provided many new ideas which made their way into other languages, but MAD/I compilations were slow and MAD/I never extended itself into widespread use when compared to the original 7090 MAD.\nGOM is essentially the 7090 MAD language modified and extended for the 360/370 architecture with some judicious tailoring to better fit current programming practices and problems. The MTS Message System was written in GOM.\nMAD, Mad magazine, and Alfred E. Neuman.\nIn a pre-release version of the original MAD, as a reference to MAD's namesake, \"Mad\" magazine, when a program contained too many compile time errors the compiler would print a full-page picture of Alfred E. Neuman using ASCII art. The caption read, \"See this man about your program--He might want to publish it. He never worries--but from the looks of your program, you should.\" This feature was not included in the final official version. However, it was included in the production version for the IBM 7040.\nAnd Bernie Galler remembers:\nBy the time we designed the language that we thought would be worth doing and for which we could do a compiler, we couldn't call it Algol anymore; it really was different. That's when we adopted the name MAD, for the Michigan Algorithm Decoder. We had some funny interaction with the Mad magazine people, when we asked for permission to use the name MAD. In a very funny letter, they told us that they would take us to court and everything else, but ended the threat with a P.S. at the bottom - \"Sure, go ahead.\" Unfortunately, that letter is lost.\n\"Hello, world\" example.\nThe \"hello, world\" example program prints the string \"Hello, world\" to a terminal or screen display.\n PRINT FORMAT HELLOW\n VECTOR VALUES HELLOW=$13h0Hello, world*$\n END OF PROGRAM\nThe first character of the line is treated as logical carriage control, in this example the character \"0\" which causes a double-spaced line to be printed.\nAlternatively, contractions can be used, and the compiler will expand them in the listing:\n P'T HELLOW\n V'S HELLOW=$13h0Hello, world*$\n E'M\nLanguage elements.\nMAD and GOM, but not MAD/I, are composed of the following elements:\nInput format.\nMAD programs are a series of statements written on punched cards, generally one statement per card, although a statement can be continued to multiple cards. Columns 1-10 contains an optional statement label, comments or remarks are flagged using the letter \"R\" in column 11, and columns 73-80 are unused and could contain a sequence identifier. Spaces are not significant anywhere other than within character constants. For GOM input is free form with no sequence field and lines may be up to 255 characters long; lines that start with an asterisk (*) are comments; and lines that start with a plus-sign (+) are continuation lines.\nNames.\nVariable names, function names, and statement labels have the same form, a letter followed by zero to five letters or digits. Function names end with a period. All names can be subscripted (the name followed by parentheses, with multiple subscripts separated by commas). For GOM names may be up to 24 characters long and may include the underscore (_) character.\nFew keywords in the language are reserved words since most are longer than six letters or are surrounded by periods. There is a standard set of abbreviations which can be used to replace the longer words. These consist of the first and last letters of the keywords with an apostrophe between them, such as W'R for WHENEVER and D'N for DIMENSION.\nData types.\nMAD uses the term \"mode\" for its data types. Five basic modes are supported:\nThe mode of a constant can be redefined by adding the character M followed by a single digit at the end of the constant, where 0 indicates floating point, 1 integer, 2 boolean, 3 function name, and 4 statement label.\nFor GOM six additional modes are added: CHARACTER, SHORT INTEGER, BYTE INTEGER, LONG INTEGER, POINTER, and DYNAMIC RECORD.\nAlphabetic or character constants are stored as integers and written using the dollar sign as a delimiter ($ABCDEF$) with double dollar-signs used to enter a true dollar sign ($$$.56$ is 56 cents). Strings longer than six characters are represented using arrays.\nArrays and matrices.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Hidden begin/styles.css\"/&gt;List of operators, statements, and functions\nOperators.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nDeclaration statements.\nVariables may be implicitly or explicitly declared.

Internal and external functions are supported. Internal functions are compiled as part of the program in which they are used and share declarations and variables with the main program.

Recursive functions are permitted, although the function must do some of the required saving and restoring work itself.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOperator definition and redefinition.\nOne of the most interesting features in MAD is the ability to extend the language by redefining existing operators, defining new operators, or defining new data types (modes).

Pain typically comes on rapidly, reaching maximal intensity in less than 12 hours. In about half of cases, the joint at the base of the big toe is affected (\"Podagra\"). It may also result in tophi, kidney stones, or kidney damage.\nGout is due to persistently elevated levels of uric acid (urate) in the blood (hyperuricemia). This occurs from a combination of diet, other health problems, and genetic factors. At high levels, uric acid crystallizes and the crystals deposit in joints, tendons, and surrounding tissues, resulting in an attack of gout. Gout occurs more commonly in those who regularly drink beer or sugar-sweetened beverages; eat foods that are high in purines such as liver, shellfish, or anchovies; or are overweight. Diagnosis of gout may be confirmed by the presence of crystals in the joint fluid or in a deposit outside the joint. Blood uric acid levels may be normal during an attack.\nTreatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), glucocorticoids, or colchicine improves symptoms. Once the acute attack subsides, levels of uric acid can be lowered via lifestyle changes and in those with frequent attacks, allopurinol or probenecid provides long-term prevention. Taking vitamin C and having a diet high in low-fat dairy products may be preventive.\nGout affects about 1\u20132% of adults in the developed world at some point in their lives. It has become more common in recent decades. This is believed to be due to increasing risk factors in the population, such as metabolic syndrome, longer life expectancy, and changes in diet. Older males are most commonly affected. Gout was historically known as \"the disease of kings\" or \"rich man's disease\". It has been recognized at least since the time of the ancient Egyptians.\nSigns and symptoms.\nGout can present in several ways, although the most common is a recurrent attack of acute inflammatory arthritis (a red, tender, hot, swollen joint). The metatarsophalangeal joint at the base of the big toe is affected most often, accounting for half of cases. It can also involve midfoot structures, including the cuneiform bones. Other joints, such as the heels, knees, wrists, and fingers, may also be affected. Joint pain usually begins during the night and peaks within 24 hours of onset. This is mainly due to lower body temperature. Other symptoms may rarely occur along with the joint pain, including fatigue and high fever.\nLong-standing elevated uric acid levels (hyperuricemia) may result in other symptoms, including hard, painless deposits of uric acid crystals called \"tophi\". Extensive tophi may lead to chronic arthritis due to bone erosion. Elevated levels of uric acid may also lead to crystals precipitating in the kidneys, resulting in kidney stone formation and subsequent acute uric acid nephropathy.\nCause.\nThe crystallization of uric acid, often related to relatively high levels in the blood, is the underlying cause of gout. This can occur because of diet, genetic predisposition, or underexcretion of urate, the salts of uric acid. Underexcretion of uric acid by the kidney is the primary cause of hyperuricemia in about 90% of cases, while overproduction is the cause in less than 10%. About 10% of people with hyperuricemia develop gout at some point in their lifetimes. The risk, however, varies depending on the degree of hyperuricemia. When levels are between 415 and 530\u00a0\u03bcmol/L (7 and 8.9\u00a0mg/dL), the risk is 0.5% per year, while in those with a level greater than 535\u00a0\u03bcmol/L (9\u00a0mg/dL), the risk is 4.5% per year.\nLifestyle.\nDietary causes account for about 12% of gout, and include a strong association with the consumption of alcohol, sugar-sweetened beverages, meat, and seafood. The dietary mechanisms and nutritional basis involved in gout provide evidence for strategies of prevention and improvement of gout, and dietary modifications based on effective regulatory mechanisms may be a promising strategy to reduce the high prevalence of gout. Among foods richest in purines yielding high amounts of uric acid are dried anchovies, shrimp, organ meat, dried mushrooms, seaweed, and beer yeast. Chicken and potatoes also appear related. Other triggers include physical trauma and surgery.\nStudies in the early 2000s found that other dietary factors are not relevant. Specifically, a diet with moderate purine-rich vegetables (e.g., beans, peas, lentils, and spinach) is not associated with gout. Neither is total dietary protein. Alcohol consumption is strongly associated with increased risk, with wine presenting somewhat less of a risk than beer or spirits. Eating skim milk powder enriched with glycomacropeptide (GMP) and G600 milk fat extract may reduce pain but may result in diarrhea and nausea.\nPhysical fitness, healthy weight, low-fat dairy products, and to a lesser extent, coffee and taking vitamin C, appear to decrease the risk of gout; however, taking vitamin C supplements does not appear to have a significant effect in people who already have established gout. Peanuts, brown bread, and fruit also appear protective. This is believed to be partly due to their effect in reducing insulin resistance.\nOther than dietary and lifestyle choices, the recurrence of gout attacks is also linked to the weather. High ambient temperature and low relative humidity may increase the risk of a gout attack.\nGenetics.\nGout is partly genetic, contributing to about 60% of variability in uric acid level. The \"SLC2A9\", \"SLC22A12\", and \"ABCG2\" genes are commonly associated with gout and variations in them can approximately double the risk. Loss-of-function mutations in \"SLC2A9\" and \"SLC22A12\" causes low blood uric acid levels by reducing urate absorption and unopposed urate secretion. The rare genetic disorders familial juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy, medullary cystic kidney disease, phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase superactivity and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency as seen in Lesch\u2013Nyhan syndrome, are complicated by gout.\nMedical conditions.\nGout frequently occurs in combination with other medical problems. Metabolic syndrome, a combination of abdominal obesity, hypertension, insulin resistance, and abnormal lipid levels, occurs in nearly 75% of cases. Other conditions commonly complicated by gout include lead poisoning, kidney failure, hemolytic anemia, psoriasis, solid organ transplants, and myeloproliferative disorders such as polycythemia. A body mass index greater than or equal to 35 increases male risk of gout threefold. Chronic lead exposure and lead-contaminated alcohol are risk factors for gout due to the harmful effect of lead on kidney function.\nMedication.\nDiuretics have been associated with attacks of gout, but a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide does not seem to increase risk. Other medications that increase the risk include niacin, aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta blockers, ritonavir, and pyrazinamide. The immunosuppressive drugs ciclosporin and tacrolimus are also associated with gout, the former more so when used in combination with hydrochlorothiazide.\nPathophysiology.\nGout is a disorder of purine metabolism, and occurs when its final metabolite, uric acid, crystallizes in the form of monosodium urate, precipitating and forming deposits (tophi) in joints, on tendons, and in the surrounding tissues. Microscopic tophi may be walled off by a ring of proteins, which blocks interaction of the crystals with cells and therefore avoids inflammation. Naked crystals may break out of walled-off tophi due to minor physical damage to the joint, medical or surgical stress, or rapid changes in uric acid levels. When they break through the tophi, they trigger a local immune-mediated inflammatory reaction in macrophages, which is initiated by the NLRP3 inflammasome protein complex. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome recruits the enzyme caspase 1, which converts pro-interleukin 1\u03b2 into active interleukin 1\u03b2, one of the key proteins in the inflammatory cascade. An evolutionary loss of urate oxidase (uricase), which breaks down uric acid, in humans and higher primates has made this condition common.\nThe triggers for the precipitation of uric acid are not well understood. While it may crystallize at normal levels, it is more likely to do so as levels increase. Other triggers believed to be important in acute episodes of arthritis include cool temperatures, rapid changes in uric acid levels, acidosis, articular hydration and extracellular matrix proteins. The increased precipitation at low temperatures partly explains why the joints in the feet are most commonly affected. Rapid changes in uric acid may occur due to factors including trauma, surgery, chemotherapy and diuretics. The starting or increasing of urate-lowering medications can lead to an acute attack of gout with febuxostat of a particularly high risk. Calcium channel blockers and losartan are associated with a lower risk of gout compared to other medications for hypertension.\nDiagnosis.\nGout may be diagnosed and treated without further investigations in someone with hyperuricemia and the classic acute arthritis of the base of the great toe (known as podagra). Synovial fluid analysis should be done if the diagnosis is in doubt. Plain X-rays are usually normal and are not useful for confirming a diagnosis of early gout. They may show signs of chronic gout, such as bone erosion.\nSynovial fluid.\nA definitive diagnosis of gout is based upon the identification of monosodium urate crystals in synovial fluid or a tophus. All synovial fluid samples obtained from undiagnosed inflamed joints by arthrocentesis should be examined for these crystals. Under polarized light microscopy, they have a needle-like morphology and strong negative birefringence. This test is difficult to perform and requires a trained observer. The fluid must be examined relatively soon after aspiration, as temperature and pH affect solubility.\nBlood tests.\nHyperuricemia is a classic feature of gout, but nearly half of the time gout occurs without hyperuricemia and most people with raised uric acid levels never develop gout. Thus, the diagnostic utility of measuring uric acid levels is limited. Hyperuricemia is defined as a plasma urate level greater than 420 \u03bcmol/L (7.0\u00a0mg/dL) in males and 360 \u03bcmol/L (6.0\u00a0mg/dL) in females. Other blood tests commonly performed are white blood cell count, electrolytes, kidney function and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). However, both the white blood cells and ESR may be elevated due to gout in the absence of infection. A white blood cell count as high as 40.0\u00d7109/l (40,000/mm3) has been documented.\nDifferential diagnosis.\nThe most important differential diagnosis in gout is septic arthritis. This should be considered in those with signs of infection or those who do not improve with treatment. To help with diagnosis, a synovial fluid Gram stain and culture may be performed. Other conditions that can look similar include CPPD (pseudogout), rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, palindromic rheumatism, and reactive arthritis. Gouty tophi, in particular when not located in a joint, can be mistaken for basal cell carcinoma or other neoplasms.\nPrevention.\nRisk of gout attacks can be lowered by complete abstinence from drinking alcoholic beverages, reducing the intake of fructose (e.g., high fructose corn syrup), sucrose, and purine-rich foods of animal origin, such as organ meats and seafood. Eating dairy products, vitamin C-rich foods, coffee, and cherries may help prevent gout attacks, as does losing weight. Gout may be secondary to sleep apnea via the release of purines from oxygen-starved cells. Treatment of apnea can lessen the occurrence of attacks.\nMedications.\nAs of 2020, allopurinol is generally the recommended preventative treatment if medications are used. A number of other medications may occasionally be considered to prevent further episodes of gout, including probenecid, febuxostat, benzbromarone, and colchicine. Long term medications are not recommended until a person has had two attacks of gout, unless destructive joint changes, tophi, or urate nephropathy exist. It is not until this point that medications are cost-effective. They are not usually started until one to two weeks after an acute flare has resolved, due to theoretical concerns of worsening the attack. They are often used in combination with either an NSAID or colchicine for the first three to six months.\nWhile it has been recommended that urate-lowering measures should be increased until serum uric acid levels are below 300\u2013360\u00a0\u03bcmol/L (5.0\u20136.0\u00a0mg/dL), there is little evidence to support this practice over simply putting people on a standard dose of allopurinol. If these medications are in chronic use at the time of an attack, it is recommended that they be continued. Levels that cannot be brought below 6.0\u00a0mg/dL while attacks continue indicates refractory gout.\nWhile historically it is not recommended to start allopurinol during an acute attack of gout, this practice appears acceptable. Allopurinol blocks uric acid production, and is the most commonly used agent. Long term therapy is safe and well-tolerated and can be used in people with renal impairment or urate stones, although hypersensitivity occurs in a small number of individuals. The \"HLA-B*58:01\" allele of the human leukocyte antigen B (\"HLA-B\") is strongly associated with severe cutaneous adverse reactions during treatment with allopurinol and is most common among Asian subpopulations, notably those of Korean, Han-Chinese, or Thai descent.\nFebuxostat is only recommended in those who cannot tolerate allopurinol. There are concerns about more deaths with febuxostat compared to allopurinol. Febuxostat may also increase the rate of gout flares during early treatment. However, there is tentative evidence that febuxostat may bring down urate levels more than allopurinol.\nProbenecid appears to be less effective than allopurinol and is a second-line agent. Probenecid may be used if undersecretion of uric acid is present (24-hour urine uric acid less than 800\u00a0mg). It is, however, not recommended if a person has a history of kidney stones. Probenecid can be used in a combined therapy with allopurinol is more effective than allopurinol monotherapy.\nPegloticase is an option for the 3% of people who are intolerant to other medications. It is a third line agent. Pegloticase is given as an intravenous infusion every two weeks, and reduces uric acid levels. Pegloticase is useful decreasing tophi but has a high rate of side effects and many people develop resistance to it. Using lesinurad plus febuxostat is more beneficial for tophi resolution than lesinural with febuxostat, with similar side effects. Lesinural plus allopurinol is not effective for tophi resolution. Potential side effects include kidney stones, anemia and joint pain. In 2016, it was withdrawn from the European market.\nLesinurad reduces blood uric acid levels by preventing uric acid absorption in the kidneys. It was approved in the United States for use together with allopurinol, among those who were unable to reach their uric acid level targets. Side effects include kidney problems and kidney stones.\nTreatment.\nThe initial aim of treatment is to settle the symptoms of an acute attack. Repeated attacks can be prevented by medications that reduce serum uric acid levels. Tentative evidence supports the application of ice for 20 to 30 minutes several times a day to decrease pain. Options for acute treatment include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine, and glucocorticoids. While glucocorticoids and NSAIDs work equally well, glucocorticoids may be safer. Options for prevention include allopurinol, febuxostat, and probenecid. Lowering uric acid levels can cure the disease. Treatment of associated health problems is also important. Lifestyle interventions have been poorly studied. It is unclear whether dietary supplements have an effect in people with gout.\nNSAIDs.\nNSAIDs are the usual first-line treatment for gout. No specific agent is significantly more or less effective than any other. Improvement may be seen within four hours, and treatment is recommended for one to two weeks. They are not recommended for those with certain other health problems, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, kidney failure, or heart failure. While indometacin has historically been the most commonly used NSAID, an alternative, such as ibuprofen, may be preferred due to its better side effect profile in the absence of superior effectiveness. For those at risk of gastric side effects from NSAIDs, an additional proton pump inhibitor may be given. There is some evidence that COX-2 inhibitors may work as well as nonselective NSAIDs for acute gout attack with fewer side effects.\nColchicine.\nColchicine is an alternative for those unable to tolerate NSAIDs. At high doses, side effects (primarily gastrointestinal upset) limit its usage. At lower doses, which are still effective, it is well tolerated. Colchicine may interact with other commonly prescribed drugs, such as atorvastatin and erythromycin, among others.\nGlucocorticoids.\nGlucocorticoids have been found to be as effective as NSAIDs and may be used if contraindications exist for NSAIDs. They also lead to improvement when injected into the joint. A joint infection must be excluded, however, as glucocorticoids worsen this condition. There were no short-term adverse effects reported.\nOthers.\nInterleukin-1 inhibitors, such as canakinumab, showed moderate effectiveness for pain relief and reduction of joint swelling, but have increased risk of adverse events, such as back pain, headache, and increased blood pressure. They, however, may work less well than usual doses of NSAIDS. The high cost of this class of drugs may also discourage their use for treating gout.\nPrognosis.\nWithout treatment, an acute attack of gout usually resolves in five to seven days; however, 60% of people have a second attack within one year. Those with gout are at increased risk of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, and kidney and cardiovascular disease and thus are at increased risk of death. It is unclear whether medications that lower urate affect cardiovascular disease risks. This may be partly due to its association with insulin resistance and obesity, but some of the increased risk appears to be independent.\nWithout treatment, episodes of acute gout may develop into chronic gout with destruction of joint surfaces, joint deformity, and painless tophi. These tophi occur in 30% of those who are untreated for five years, often in the helix of the ear, over the olecranon processes, or on the Achilles tendons. With aggressive treatment, they may dissolve. Kidney stones also frequently complicate gout, affecting between 10 and 40% of people, and occur due to low urine pH, promoting the precipitation of uric acid. Other forms of chronic kidney dysfunction may occur.\nEpidemiology.\nGout affects around 1\u20132% of people in the Western world at some point in their lifetimes and is becoming more common. Some 5.8 million people were affected in 2013. Rates of gout approximately doubled between 1990 and 2010. This rise is believed to be due to increasing life expectancy, changes in diet, and an increase in diseases associated with gout, such as metabolic syndrome and high blood pressure. Factors that influence rates of gout include age, race, and the season of the year. In men over 30 and women over 50, the rates are 2%.\nIn the United States, gout is twice as likely in males of African descent than those of European descent. Rates are high among Polynesians, but the disease is rare in aboriginal Australians, despite a higher mean uric acid serum concentration in the latter group. It has become common in China, Polynesia, and urban Sub-Saharan Africa. Some studies found that attacks of gout occur more frequently in the spring. This has been attributed to seasonal changes in diet, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and temperature.\nTaiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore have a relatively higher prevalence of gout. A study based on the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) estimated that 4.92% of Taiwanese residents had gout in 2004. A survey held by the Hong Kong government found that 5.1% of Hong Kong residents between 45\u201359 years and 6.1% of those older than 60 years have gout. A study held in Singapore found that 2,117 out of 52,322 people between 45\u201374 years have gout, roughly equal to 4.1%.\nHistory.\nThe English term \"gout\" first occurs in the work of Randolphus of Bocking, around 1200 AD.\nIt derives from the Latin word , meaning \"a drop\" (of liquid). According to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", this originates from humorism and \"the notion of the 'dropping' of a morbid material from the blood in and around the joints\".\nGout has been known since antiquity. Historically, wits have referred to it as \"the king of diseases and the disease of kings\" or as \"rich man's disease\". The Ebers papyrus and the Edwin Smith papyrus, (c.\u20091550 BC) each mention arthritis of the first metacarpophalangeal joint as a distinct type of arthritis. These ancient manuscripts cite (now missing) Egyptian texts about gout that are claimed to have been written 1,000 years earlier and ascribed to Imhotep. Greek physician Hippocrates around 400 BC commented on it in his \"Aphorisms\", noting its absence in eunuchs and premenopausal women. Aulus Cornelius Celsus (30 AD) described the linkage with alcohol, later onset in women and associated kidney problems:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Again thick urine, the sediment from which is white, indicates that pain and disease are to be apprehended in the region of joints or viscera... Joint troubles in the hands and feet are very frequent and persistent, such as occur in cases of podagra and cheiragra. These seldom attack eunuchs or boys before coition with a woman, or women except those in whom the menses have become suppressed... some have obtained lifelong security by refraining from wine, mead and venery.\nBenjamin Welles, an English physician, authored the first medical book on gout, \"A Treatise of the Gout, or Joint Evil\", in 1669. In 1683, Thomas Sydenham, an English physician, described its occurrence in the early hours of the morning and its predilection for older males:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Gouty patients are, generally, either old men or men who have so worn themselves out in youth as to have brought on a premature old age\u2014of such dissolute habits none being more common than the premature and excessive indulgence in venery and the like exhausting passions. The victim goes to bed and sleeps in good health. About two o'clock in the morning he is awakened by a severe pain in the great toe; more rarely in the heel, ankle, or instep. The pain is like that of a dislocation and yet parts feel as if cold water were poured over them. Then follows chills and shivers and a little fever... The night is passed in torture, sleeplessness, turning the part affected and perpetual change of posture; the tossing about of body being as incessant as the pain of the tortured joint and being worse as the fit comes on.\nIn the 18th century, Thomas Marryat distinguished different manifestations of gout:\nThe Gout is a chronical disease most commonly affecting the feet. If it attacks the knees, it is called Gonagra; if the hands, Chiragra; if the elbow, Onagra; if the shoulder, Omagra; if the back or loins, Lumbago.\nDutch scientist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek first described the microscopic appearance of urate crystals in 1679. In 1848, English physician Alfred Baring Garrod identified excess uric acid in the blood as the cause of gout.\nOther animals.\nGout is rare in most other animals due to their ability to produce uricase, which breaks down uric acid. Humans and other great apes do not have this ability; thus, gout is common. Other animals with uricase include fish, amphibians, and most non-primate mammals. The \"Tyrannosaurus rex\" specimen known as \"Sue\" is believed to have had gout.\nResearch.\nSeveral new medications are under study for treating gout, including anakinra, canakinumab, and rilonacept. Canakinumab may result in better outcomes than a low dose of a glucocorticoid, but costs five thousand times more. A recombinant uricase enzyme (rasburicase) is available but its use is limited, as it triggers an immune response. Versions that are less antigenic are in development.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Enacted by the Democrats, it made substantial cuts in the high rates of the \"Black Tariff\" of 1842, enacted by the Whigs. It was based on a report by Secretary of the Treasury Robert J. Walker.\nThe Walker Tariff reduced tariff rates from 32% to 25%. Coinciding with Britain's repeal of the Corn Laws, it led to an increase in trade. The tariff still remained higher than the 20% universal tariff that existed before the Tyler tariffs were imposed. \nAdoption.\nDemocrat James Polk was elected President in 1844 over Henry Clay, a Whig who advocated a high tariff.\nPresident Polk declared that reduction of the \"Black Tariff\" would be the first of the \"four great measures\" that would define his administration. He directed Walker to work out the details. In 1846, Polk delivered Walker's tariff proposal to Congress. Walker urged its adoption to increase commerce between the US and Britain. He also predicted that a reduction in tariff rates would stimulate trade, including imports. The result, asserted Walker, would be a net increase in customs revenue, despite the reduced rates.\nCongress, then controlled by Democrats, acted quickly on Walker's recommendations. Southern Democrats, who had little industry in their states, were especially supportive.\nThe Walker Tariff produced the nation's first standardized tariff: rather than setting fixed rates for specific items on a case-by-case basis, it established general schedules into which all goods could be classified, subject to defined ad valorem rates. The bill reduced rates across the board on most major import items save luxury goods, such as tobacco and alcoholic beverages.\nImpact.\nThe bill made moderate reductions in many tariff rates. As Walker had predicted, trade increased substantially, and net revenue collected also increased, from $30 million annually under the Black Tariff in 1845 to almost $45 million annually by 1850. It also improved relations with Britain that had soured over the Oregon boundary dispute.\nIt was passed along with a series of financial reforms proposed by Walker including the Warehousing Act of 1846. The 1846 tariff rates initiated a fourteen-year period of relative free trade by nineteenth century standards lasting until the high Morrill Tariff of 1861.\nThe Walker Tariff remained in effect until the Tariff of 1857, which used it as a base and reduced rates further.\nThe 1861 Morril Tariff raised the effective rate collected on dutiable imports by approximately 70%. Customs revenue from tariffs totaled $345 million from 1861 through 1865.\nThe tariff act of 1842 had a significant impact on railroad building. The duty of $17/ton of hammered bar iron and $25/ton of rolled bar iron raised costs by 50 to 80%. The Walker tariff of 1846 reduced the duty to 30% and set off a railroad building boom in the 1850s.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "55586", "revid": "7098284", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55586", "title": "Seneca Falls Convention", "text": "First women's rights convention (1848)\nThe Seneca Falls Convention was the first women's rights convention. Its organizers advertised it as \"a convention to discuss the social, civil, and religious condition and rights of woman\". Held in the Wesleyan Chapel of the town of Seneca Falls, New York, it spanned two days over July 19\u201320, 1848. Attracting widespread attention, it was soon followed by other women's rights conventions, including the Rochester Women's Rights Convention in Rochester, New York, two weeks later. In 1850 the first in a series of annual National Women's Rights Conventions met in Worcester, Massachusetts.\nFemale Quakers local to the area organized the meeting along with Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who was not a Quaker. They planned the event during a visit to the area by Philadelphia-based Lucretia Mott. Mott, a Quaker, was famous for her oratorical ability, which was rare for non-Quaker women during an era in which women were often not allowed to speak in public.\nThe meeting comprised six sessions including a lecture on law, a humorous presentation, and multiple discussions about the role of women in society. Stanton and the Quaker women presented two prepared documents, the Declaration of Sentiments and an accompanying list of resolutions, to be debated and modified before being put forward for signatures. A heated debate sprang up regarding women's right to vote, with many \u2013 including Mott \u2013 urging the removal of this concept, but Frederick Douglass, who was the convention's sole African American attendee, argued eloquently for its inclusion, and the suffrage resolution was retained. Exactly 100 of approximately 300 attendees signed the document, mostly women.\nThe convention was seen by some of its contemporaries, including featured speaker Mott, as one important step among many others in the continuing effort by women to gain for themselves a greater proportion of social, civil and moral rights,\nwhile it was viewed by others as a revolutionary beginning to the struggle by women for complete equality with men. Stanton considered the Seneca Falls Convention to be the beginning of the women's rights movement, an opinion that was echoed in the \"History of Woman Suffrage\", which Stanton co-wrote.\nThe convention's Declaration of Sentiments became \"the single most important factor in spreading news of the women's rights movement around the country in 1848 and into the future\", according to Judith Wellman, a historian of the convention. By the time of the National Women's Rights Convention of 1851, the issue of women's right to vote had become a central tenet of the United States women's rights movement. These conventions became annual events until the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861.\nBackground.\nReform movement.\nIn the decades leading up to 1848, a small number of women began to push against restrictions imposed upon them by society. A few men aided in this effort. In 1831, Reverend Charles Grandison Finney began allowing women to pray aloud in gatherings of men and women. The Second Great Awakening was challenging women's traditional roles in religion. Recalling the era in 1870, Paulina Wright Davis set Finney's decision as the beginning of the American women's reform movement.\nWomen in abolition.\nStarting in 1832, abolitionist and journalist William Lloyd Garrison organized anti-slavery associations which encouraged the full participation of women. Garrison's ideas were not welcomed by a majority of other abolitionists, and those unwilling to include women split from his American Anti-Slavery Society to form other abolitionist societies.\nA few women began to gain fame as writers and speakers on the subject of abolition. In the 1830s, Lydia Maria Child wrote to encourage women to write a will, and Frances Wright wrote books on women's rights and social reform. The Grimk\u00e9 sisters published their views against slavery in the late 1830s, and they began speaking to mixed gatherings of men and women for Garrison's American Anti-Slavery Society, as did Abby Kelley. Although these women lectured primarily on the evils of slavery, the fact that a woman was speaking in public was itself a noteworthy stand for the cause of women's rights. Ernestine Rose began lecturing in 1836 to groups of women on the subject of the \"Science of Government\" which included the enfranchisement of women.\nIn 1840, at the urging of Garrison and Wendell Phillips, Lucretia Coffin Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton traveled with their husbands and a dozen other American male and female abolitionists to London for the first World's Anti-Slavery Convention, with the expectation that the motion put forward by Phillips to include women's participation in the convention would be controversial. In London, the proposal was rebuffed after a full day of debate; the women were allowed to listen from the gallery but not allowed to speak or vote. Mott and Stanton became friends in London and on the return voyage and together planned to organize their own convention to further the cause of women's rights, separate from abolition concerns. In 1842 Thomas M'Clintock and his wife Mary Ann became founding members of the Western New York Anti-Slavery Society and helped write its constitution. When he moved to Rochester in 1847, Frederick Douglass joined Amy and Isaac Post and the M'Clintocks in this Rochester-based chapter of the American Anti-Slavery Society.\nWomen's rights.\nIn 1839 in Boston, Margaret Fuller began hosting conversations, akin to French \" salons\", among women interested in discussing the \"great questions\" facing their sex. Sophia Ripley was one of the participants. In 1843, Fuller published \"The Great Lawsuit\", asking women to claim themselves as self-dependent.\nIn the 1840s, women in America were reaching out for greater control of their lives. Husbands and fathers directed the lives of women, and many doors were closed to female participation. State statutes and common law prohibited women from inheriting property, signing contracts, serving on juries and voting in elections. Women's prospects in employment were dim: they could expect only to gain a very few service-related jobs and were paid about half of what men were paid for the same work. In Massachusetts, Brook Farm was founded by Sophia Ripley and her husband George Ripley in 1841 as an attempt to find a way in which men and women could work together, with women receiving the same compensation as men. The experiment failed.\nIn the fall of 1841, Elizabeth Cady Stanton gave her first public speech, on the subject of the Temperance movement, in front of 100 women in Seneca Falls. She wrote to her friend Elizabeth J. Neal that she moved both the audience and herself to tears, saying \"I infused into my speech a Homeopathic dose of woman's rights, as I take good care to do in many private conversations.\"\nLucretia Mott met with Elizabeth Cady Stanton in Boston in 1842, and discussed again the possibility of a woman's rights convention. They talked once more in 1847, prior to Stanton moving from Boston to Seneca Falls.\nWomen's groups led by Lucretia Mott and Paulina Wright Davis held public meetings in Philadelphia beginning in 1846. A wide circle of abolitionists friendly to women's rights began in 1847 to discuss the possibility of holding a convention wholly devoted to women's rights. In October 1847, Lucy Stone gave her first public speech on the subject of women's rights, entitled \"The Province of Women\", at her brother Bowman Stone's church in Gardner, Massachusetts.\nIn March 1848, Garrison, the Motts, Abby Kelley Foster, Stephen Symonds Foster and others hosted an Anti-Sabbath meeting in Boston, to work toward the elimination of laws that apply only to Sunday, and to gain for the laborer more time away from toil than just one day of rest per week. Lucretia Mott and two other women were active within the executive committee, and Mott spoke to the assemblage. Lucretia Mott raised questions about the validity of blindly following religious and social tradition.\nPolitical gains.\nOn April 7, 1848, in response to a citizen's petition, the New York State Assembly passed the Married Woman's Property Act, giving women the right to retain the property they brought into a marriage, as well as property they acquired during the marriage. Creditors could not seize a wife's property to pay a husband's debts. Leading up to the passage of this law, in 1846, supporters issued a pamphlet, probably authored by Judge John Fine, which relied on its readers' familiarity with the United States Declaration of Independence to demand \"That all are created free and equal\u00a0...\", and that this idea should apply equally to the sexes. \"Women, as well as men, are entitled to the full enjoyment of its practical blessings\". A group of 44\u00a0married women of western New York wrote to the Assembly in March 1848, saying \"your Declaration of Independence declares, that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. And as women have never consented to, been represented in, or recognized by this government, it is evident that in justice no allegiance can be claimed from them\u00a0... Our numerous and yearly petitions for this most desirable object having been disregarded, we now ask your august body, to abolish all laws which hold married women more accountable for their acts than infants, idiots, and lunatics.\"\nNew York, however, was not the pioneer in this case. Already, in February 1839, Mississippi had enacted its own Married Women's Property Act, the first state law anywhere to allow married women to independently own and administer property, a statute which was expanded in 1846, 1857, 1868, 1880, and 1890. The General Assembly in Pennsylvania passed a similar married woman's property law a few weeks after New York, one which Lucretia Mott and others had championed. These progressive state laws were seen by American women as a sign of new hope for women's rights.\nOn June 2, 1848, in Rochester, New York, Gerrit Smith was nominated as the Liberty Party's presidential candidate. Smith was Elizabeth Cady Stanton's first cousin, and the two enjoyed debating and discussing political and social issues with each other whenever he came to visit. At the National Liberty Convention, held June 14\u201315 in Buffalo, New York, Smith gave a major address, including in his speech a demand for \"universal suffrage in its broadest sense, females as well as males being entitled to vote.\" The delegates approved a passage in their party platform addressing votes for women: \"Neither here, nor in any other part of the world, is the right of suffrage allowed to extend beyond one of the sexes. This universal exclusion of woman\u00a0... argues, conclusively, that, not as yet, is there one nation so far emerged from barbarism, and so far practically Christian, as to permit woman to rise up to the one level of the human family.\" At this convention, five votes were placed calling for Lucretia Mott to be Smith's vice-president\u2014the first time in the United States that a woman was suggested for federal executive office.\nQuaker influence.\nMany members of the Religious Society of Friends, known as Quakers, made their homes in western New York state, near Seneca Falls. A particularly progressive branch lived in and around Waterloo in Seneca County, New York. These Quakers strove for marital relationships in which men and women worked and lived in equality.\nThe M'Clintocks came to Waterloo from a Quaker community in Philadelphia. They rented property from Richard P. Hunt, a wealthy Quaker and businessman. The M'Clintock and Hunt families opposed slavery; both participated in the free produce movement, and their houses served as stations on the Underground Railroad.\nThough women Friends had since the 1660s publicly preached, written and led, and traditional Quaker tenets held that men and women were equals, Quaker women met separately from the men to consider and decide a congregation's business. By the 1840s, some Hicksite Quakers determined to bring women and men together in their business meetings as an expression of their spiritual equality. In June 1848, approximately 200\u00a0Hicksites, including the Hunts and the M'Clintocks, formed an even more radical Quaker group, known as the Yearly Meeting of Congregational Friends, or Progressive Friends. The Progressive Friends intended to further elevate the influence of women in affairs of the faith. They introduced joint business meetings of men and women, giving women an equal voice.\nPlanning.\nLucretia and James Mott visited central and western New York in the summer of 1848 for a number of reasons. They visited the Cattaraugus Reservation of the Seneca Nation, which was then part of the Iroquois Confederacy; women of that nation were known to enjoy a strong position. The Motts also visited former slaves living in the province of Ontario, Canada. Mott was present at the meeting in which the Progressive Friends left the Hicksite Quakers. They also visited Lucretia's sister Martha Coffin Wright in Auburn, NY, where Mott preached to prisoners at the Auburn State Penitentiary. Her skill and fame as an orator drew crowds wherever she went.\nAnnouncement.\nAfter Quaker worship on Sunday July 9, 1848, Lucretia Coffin Mott joined Mary Ann M'Clintock, Martha Coffin Wright (Mott's witty sister, several months pregnant), Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Jane Hunt for tea at the Hunt home in Waterloo. The two eldest M'Clintock daughters, Elizabeth and Mary Ann Jr. may have accompanied their mother. Jane Hunt had given birth two weeks earlier, and was tending the baby at home. Over tea, Stanton, the only non-Quaker present, vented a lifetime's worth of pent-up frustration, her \"long-accumulating discontent\" about women's subservient place in society. The five women decided to hold a women's rights convention in the immediate future, while the Motts were still in the area, and drew up an announcement to run in the \"Seneca County Courier\". The announcement began with these words: \"WOMAN'S RIGHTS CONVENTION.\u2014A Convention to discuss the social, civil, and religious condition and rights of woman\".\nThe notice specified that only women were invited to the first day's meetings on July 19, but both women and men could attend on the second day to hear Lucretia Mott speak, among others. On July 11, the announcement first appeared, giving readers just eight days' notice until the first day of convention. Other papers such as Douglass's \"North Star\" picked up the notice, printing it on July 14. The meeting place was to be the Wesleyan Methodist Chapel in Seneca Falls. Built by a congregation of abolitionists and financed in part by Richard Hunt, the chapel had been the scene of many reform lectures, and was considered the only large building in the area that would open its doors to a women's rights convention.\nDeclaration, grievances, resolutions.\nAt their home in Waterloo on Sunday, July 16, the M'Clintocks hosted a smaller planning session for the convention. Mary Ann M'Clintock and her eldest daughters, Elizabeth and Mary Ann Jr., discussed with Stanton the makeup of the resolutions that would be presented to the convention for approval. Each woman made certain her concerns were appropriately represented among the ten resolutions that they composed. Taken together, the resolutions demanded that women should have equality in the family, education, jobs, religion, and morals. One of the M'Clintock women selected the Declaration of Independence from 1776 as a model for the declaration they wanted to make at their convention. The Declaration of Sentiments was then drafted in the parlor on a round, three-legged, mahogany tea table. Stanton changed a few words of the Declaration of Independence to make it appropriate for a statement by women, replacing \"The history of the present King of Great Britain\" with \"The history of mankind\" as the basis for \"usurpations on the part of man toward woman.\" The women added the phrase \"and women\" to make \"...\u00a0all men \"and women\" are created equal\u00a0...\" A list of grievances was composed to form the second part of the Declaration.\nBetween July 16 and July 19, at home on her own writing desk, Stanton edited the grievances and resolutions. Henry Brewster Stanton, a lawyer, politician and Stanton's husband, helped substantiate the document by locating \"extracts from laws bearing unjustly against woman's property interests.\" On her own, Stanton added a more radical point to the list of grievances and to the resolutions: the issue of women's voting rights. To the grievances, she added \"He has never permitted her to exercise her inalienable right to the elective franchise\", and to the Sentiments, she added a line about man depriving woman of \"the elective franchise, thereby leaving her without representation in the halls of legislation ...\" Stanton then copied the Declaration and resolutions into final draft form for presentation at the meeting. When he saw the addition of woman suffrage, Henry Stanton warned his wife \"you will turn the proceedings into a farce.\" He, like most men of his day, was not in favor of women gaining voting rights. Because he intended to run for elective office, he left Seneca Falls to avoid being connected with a convention promoting such an unpopular cause. Elizabeth Cady Stanton asked her sister Harriet Cady Eaton to accompany her; Eaton brought her young son Daniel.\nOn July 16, Lucretia Mott sent a note to Stanton apologizing in advance for James Mott not being able to attend the first day, as he was feeling \"quite unwell\". Lucretia Mott wrote to say she would bring her sister, Martha Wright, and that the two women would participate in both days of the convention.\nFirst day.\nOn July 19, 1848, the morning of the first day of convention, the organizing committee arrived at the Wesleyan Methodist Chapel shortly before ten o'clock on a hot, sunny day to find a crowd gathered outside and the church doors locked\u2014an overlooked detail. Stanton's young nephew Daniel was lifted through an open window so that he could unbar the doors from the inside. Even though the first session had been announced as being exclusively for women, some young children of both sexes had been brought by their mothers, and about 40 men were there expecting to attend. The men were not turned away, but were asked to remain silent. Mary Ann M'Clintock Jr., 26 years old, was appointed secretary, to take notes.\nMorning session.\nStarting at 11 o'clock, Elizabeth Cady Stanton spoke first, exhorting each woman in the audience to accept responsibility for her own life, and to \"understand the height, the depth, the length, and the breadth of her own degradation.\" Lucretia Mott then spoke, encouraging all to take up the cause. Stanton read the Declaration of Sentiments in its entirety, then re-read each paragraph so that it could be discussed at length, and changes incorporated. The question of whether men's signatures would be sought for the Declaration was discussed, with the vote looking favorable for including men, but the motion was tabled until the following day when men themselves could participate. The first session adjourned at 2:30\u00a0p.m.\nAfternoon session.\nAfter a pause for refreshment in the 90\u00b0 heat, an afternoon session began with Stanton and then Mott addressing the audience. The Declaration of Sentiments was read again and more changes were made to it. The resolutions, now numbering eleven with Stanton's addition of women's suffrage, were read aloud and discussed. Lucretia Mott read a humorous newspaper piece written by her sister Martha Wright in which Wright questioned why, after an overworked mother completed the myriad daily tasks that were required of her but not of her husband, \"she\" was the one upon whom written advice was \"so lavishly bestowed.\" Twenty-seven-year-old Elizabeth W. M'Clintock then delivered a speech, and the first day's business was called to a close.\nEvening speech.\nIn the evening, the meeting was opened to all persons, and Lucretia Mott addressed a large audience. She spoke of the progress of other reform movements and so framed for her listeners the social and moral context for the struggle for women's rights. She asked the men present to help women gain the equality they deserved. The editor of the \"National Reformer\", a paper in Auburn, New York, reported that Mott's extemporaneous evening speech was \"one of the most eloquent, logical, and philosophical discourses which we ever listened to.\"\nSecond day.\nA larger crowd attended on the second day, including more men. Amelia Bloomer arrived late and took a seat in the upstairs gallery, there being none left in the main seating area. Quaker James Mott was well enough to attend, and he chaired the morning meeting; it was still too radical a concept that a woman serve as chair in front of both men and women.\nMorning session, day two.\nAfter Mott opened the meeting, the minutes of the previous day were read, and Stanton presented the Declaration of Sentiments. In regard to the grievance \"He has taken from her all right in property, even to the wages she earns,\" Assemblyman Ansel Bascom stood to say that he had recently been at the New York State Assembly which passed the Married Woman's Property Act. Bascom spoke at length about the property rights it secured for married women, including property acquired after marriage. Further discussion of the Declaration ensued, including comments by Frederick Douglass, Thomas and Mary Ann M'Clintock, and Amy Post; the document was adopted unanimously. The question of men's signatures was solved by having two sections of signatures, one for women followed by one for men. One hundred of the 300 present signed the Declaration of Sentiments, including 68 women and 32 men. Amelia Bloomer was one of the participants who did \"not\" endorse the Declaration; she was focused at that time on the temperance movement. Ansel Bascom was the most conspicuous attendee who chose not to sign the Declaration. The \"National Reformer\" reported that those in the audience who evidently regarded the Declaration as \"too bold and ultra\", including the lawyers known to be opposed to the equal rights of women, \"failed to call out any opposition, except in a neighboring .\"\nAfternoon session, day two.\nAt the afternoon session, the eleven resolutions were read again, and each one was voted on individually. The only one that was materially questioned was the ninth, the one Stanton had added regarding women's right to vote. It read: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThose who opposed this resolution argued that its presence would cause the other, more rational resolutions to lose support. Others argued that only the social, civil and religious rights of women should be addressed, not the political rights. James and Lucretia Mott were against the resolution; Lucretia said to Stanton, \"Why Lizzie, thee will make us ridiculous.\" Stanton defended the concept of woman suffrage, saying women would then be able to affect future legislation and gain further rights. Frederick Douglass, the only African American at the meeting, stood and spoke eloquently in favor; he said that he could not accept the right to vote himself as a black man if women could not also claim that right. Douglass projected that the world would be a better place if women were involved in the political sphere. \"In this denial of the right to participate in government, not merely the degradation of woman and the perpetuation of a great injustice happens, but the maiming and repudiation of one-half of the moral and intellectual power of the government of the world.\" Douglass's powerful words rang true with many in attendance, and the resolution passed by a large majority. Lucretia Mott spoke to end the session.\nEvening session, day two.\nQuaker Thomas M'Clintock served as chair for the evening session, opening it at half-past seven. The minutes were read, then Stanton spoke in defense of the many severe accusations brought against the much-abused \"Lords of Creation.\" Following Stanton, Thomas M'Clintock read several passages from Sir William Blackstone's laws, to expose for the audience the basis of woman's current legal condition of servitude to man. Lucretia Mott stood to offer another resolution: \"Resolved, That the speedy success of our cause depends upon the zealous and untiring efforts of both men and women, for the overthrow of the monopoly of the pulpit, and for the securing to woman an equal participation with men in the various trades, professions and commerce.\" This, the twelfth resolution, passed.\nMary Ann M'Clintock Jr. spoke briefly, calling upon woman to arouse from her lethargy and be true to herself and her God. Douglass again rose to speak in support of the cause of woman. Lucretia Mott spoke for an hour with one of her \"most beautiful and spiritual appeals\". Although Lucretia Mott's reputation as a speaker drew the audience, Mott recognized Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Mary Ann M'Clintock as the \"chief planners and architects\" of the convention. To close the meeting, a committee was appointed to edit and publish the convention proceedings, with Amy Post, Eunice Newton Foote, Mary Ann M'Clintock Jr., Elizabeth W. M'Clintock and Stanton serving.\nAfterward.\nNews reports.\nLocal newspapers printed reports of the convention, some positive, others not. The \"National Reformer\" reported that the convention \"forms an era in the progress of the age; it being the first convention of the kind ever held, and one whose influence shall not cease until woman is guaranteed all the rights now enjoyed by the other half of creation\u2014Social, Civil and .\" The \"Oneida Whig\" did not approve of the convention, writing of the Declaration: \"This bolt is the most shocking and unnatural incident ever recorded in the history of womanity. If our ladies will insist on voting and legislating, where, gentleman, will be our dinners and our elbows? Where our domestic firesides and the holes in our stockings?\"\nSoon, newspapers across the country picked up the story. Reactions varied widely. In Massachusetts, the \"Lowell Courier\" published its opinion that, with women's equality, \"the lords must wash the dishes, scour up, be put to the tub, handle the broom, darn stockings.\" In St. Louis, Missouri, the \"Daily Reveille\" trumpeted that \"the flag of independence has been hoisted for the second time on this side of the Atlantic.\" Horace Greeley in the \"New York Tribune\" wrote \"When a sincere republican is asked to say in sober earnest what adequate reason he can give, for refusing the demand of women to an equal participation with men in political rights, he must answer, None at all. However unwise and mistaken the demand, it is but the assertion of a natural right, and such must be conceded.\"\nReligious reaction.\nSome of the ministers heading congregations in the area attended the Seneca Falls Convention, but none spoke out during the sessions, not even when comments from the floor were invited. On Sunday, July 23, many who had attended, and more who had not, attacked the Convention, the Declaration of Sentiments, and the resolutions. Women in the congregations reported to Stanton, who saw the actions of the ministers as cowardly; in their congregations, no one would be allowed to reply.\nFurther conventions.\nSigners of the Declaration of Sentiments hoped for \"a series of Conventions, embracing every part of the country\" to follow their own meeting. Because of the fame and drawing power of Lucretia Mott, who would not be staying in the Upstate New York area for much longer, some of the participants at Seneca Falls organized the Rochester Women's Rights Convention two weeks later in Rochester, New York, with Lucretia Mott as its featured speaker. Unlike the Seneca Falls convention, the Rochester convention took the controversial step of electing a woman, Abigail Bush, as its presiding officer. In the next two years, \"the infancy\u00a0... of the movement\", other local and state women's rights conventions were called in Ohio, Indiana, and Pennsylvania.\nCharlotte Woodward, alone among all 100 signers, was the only one still alive in 1920 when the Nineteenth Amendment passed. Woodward was not well enough to vote herself.\nRemembrances.\nA stamp was issued in 1948 in remembrance of the Seneca Falls Convention, featuring Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Carrie Chapman Catt, and Lucretia Mott as part of a Centennial Celebration in Seneca Falls.\nThe Women's Rights National Historical Park was established in 1980, and covers a total of 6.83 acres (27,600 m2) of land in Seneca Falls and nearby Waterloo, New York, USA.\nThe park consists of four major historical properties, including the Wesleyan Methodist Church, which was the site of the Seneca Falls Convention, Elizabeth Cady Stanton's home, and the M'Clintock House, which was where the Declaration of Sentiments, resolutions, and speeches were drawn up for the Seneca Falls Convention. The Wesleyan Methodist Church and the M'Clintock House were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.\nIn 1998 First Lady Hillary Clinton gave a speech on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the Seneca Falls Convention.\nIn 2015, #FindtheSentiments was launched by the White House under Barack Obama in an effort to find an original of the Declaration of Sentiments. The call to action was picked up by social media and several historical sites. To date, the Sentiments have not been found.\nHistoriography.\nIn 1870, Paulina Wright Davis authored a history of the antebellum women's rights movement, \"The History of the National Woman's Rights Movement\", and received approval of her account from many of the involved suffragists including Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. Davis' version gave the Seneca Falls meeting in 1848 a minor role, equivalent to other local meetings that had been held by women's groups in the late 1840s. Davis set the beginning of the national and international women's rights movement at Worcester, Massachusetts, in 1850, at the National Women's Rights Convention when women from many states were invited, the influence of which was felt across the continent and in Great Britain. Stanton seemed to agree; in an address to the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA) convention in 1870, on the subject of the women's rights movement, she said \"The movement in England, as in America, may be dated from the first National Convention, held at Worcester, Mass., October, 1850.\"\nIn 1876, in the spirit of the nation's centennial celebrations, Stanton and Susan B. Anthony decided to write a more expansive history of the women's rights movement. They invited Lucy Stone to help, but Stone declined to be part of the project; she was of the opinion that Stanton and Anthony would not fairly portray the divisive split between NWSA and American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA). Stanton and Anthony wrote without her and, in 1881, they published the first volume of the \"History of Woman Suffrage\", and placed themselves at each of its most important events, marginalizing Stone's contribution.\nAccording to Lisa Tetrault, a professor of women's history, the Seneca Falls Convention was central to their rendition of the movement's history. Neither Stanton nor Anthony had been at the 1850 convention, which was associated with their rivals. Stanton, however, had played a key role at the Seneca Falls Convention in 1848, at which Stone had not been present. In the early 1870s, Stanton and Anthony began to present Seneca Falls as the beginning of the women's rights movement, an origin story that downplayed Stone's role. Pointing out that the women's rights movement could be said to have begun even earlier than Seneca Falls, Tetrault said the \"History of Woman Suffrage\" dealt with these earlier events relatively briefly in its first three chapters, the first of which is titled \"Preceding Causes.\" In the volume, Stanton did not mention the Liberty Party's plank on woman suffrage pre-dating the Seneca Falls Convention by a month, and she did not describe the Worcester National Women's Rights Convention, organized by Stone and Davis in 1850, as the beginning of the women's rights movement. Rather, Stanton named the 1840 Anti-Slavery Convention in London as the birth of the \"movement for woman's suffrage, in both England and America\". She positioned the Seneca Falls meeting as her own political debut, and characterized it as the beginning of the women's rights movement, which she called \"the greatest movement for human liberty recorded on the pages of history\u2014a demand for freedom to one-half the entire race.\"\nStanton worked to enshrine the Declaration of Sentiments as a foundational treatise in a number of ways, not the least of which was by imbuing the small, three-legged tea table upon which the first draft of it was composed with an importance similar to that of Thomas Jefferson's desk upon which he wrote the Declaration of Independence. The M'Clintocks gave Stanton the table, then Stanton gave it to Susan B. Anthony on the occasion of her 80th birthday, though Anthony had no part in the Seneca Falls meeting. In keeping with Stanton's promotion of the table as an iconic relic, women's rights activists put it in a place of honor at the head of the casket at the funeral of Susan B. Anthony on March 14, 1906. Subsequently, it was displayed prominently on the stage at each of the most important suffrage meetings until 1920, even though the grievance and resolution about woman suffrage was not written on it. The table is kept at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C.\nLucretia Mott reflected in August 1848 upon the two women's rights conventions in which she had participated that summer, and assessed them no greater than other projects and missions she was involved with. She wrote that the two gatherings were \"greatly encouraging; and give hope that this long neglected subject will soon begin to receive the attention that its importance demands.\"\nHistorian Gerda Lerner has pointed out that religious ideas provided a fundamental source for the \"Declaration of Sentiments\". Most of the women attending the convention were active in Quaker or evangelical Methodist movements. The document itself drew from writings by the evangelical Quaker Sarah Grimk\u00e9 to make biblical claims that God had created woman equal to man and that man had usurped God's authority by establishing \"absolute tyranny\" over woman. According to author Jami Carlacio, Grimk\u00e9's writings opened the public's eyes to ideas like women's rights, and for the first time they were willing to question conventional notions about the subordination of women.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSecondary sources\nPrimary sources\nExternal links.\n "}

It was the twelfth of the seventeen planks in the platform of the incoming Republican Party, which had not yet been inaugurated, and the tariff appealed to industrialists and factory workers as a way to foster rapid industrial growth.\nIt was named for its sponsor, Representative Justin Smith Morrill of Vermont, who drafted it with the advice of the economist Henry Charles Carey. The eventual passage of the tariff in the US Senate was assisted by multiple opponent senators from the South resigning from Congress after their states declared their secession from the Union. The tariff rates were raised to both make up for a federal deficit that had led to increased government debt in recent years and to encourage domestic industry and foster high wages for industrial workers.\nThe Morrill Tariff replaced a lower Tariff of 1857 which had been developed in response to a federal budget surplus in the mid-1850s.\nTwo additional tariffs sponsored by Morrill, each higher than the previous one, were passed under President Abraham Lincoln to raise revenue that was urgently needed during the American Civil War.\nThe tariff inaugurated a period of continuous protectionism in the United States, and that policy remained until the adoption of the Revenue Act of 1913, or Underwood Tariff. The schedule of the Morrill Tariff and both of its successors were retained long after the end of the Civil War.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nTariff in United States history has often been made high to encourage the development of domestic industry, and had been advocated, especially by the Whig Party and its longtime leader, Henry Clay. Such a tariff was enacted in 1842, but in 1846 the Democratic Party enacted the Walker Tariff, which cut tariff rates substantially. The Democrats cut rates even further in the Tariff of 1857, which was highly favorable to the South.\nMeanwhile, the Whig Party collapsed, and tariffs were taken up by the new Republican Party, which ran its first national ticket in 1856. Some former Whigs from the border states and the Upper South remained in Congress as \"Opposition,\" \"Unionist,\" or \"American,\" (Know Nothing) members and supported higher tariffs.\nThe Panic of 1857 led to calls for protectionist tariff revision. The famous economist Henry C. Carey blamed the panic on the new tariff. His opinion was widely circulated in the protectionist media for higher tariffs.\nEfforts to raise the tariffs began in earnest in the 35th Congress of 1857\u20131859. Two proposals were submitted in the US House of Representatives.\nHouse Ways and Means Committee Chairman John S. Phelps, Democrat from Missouri, wrote the Democrats' plan, which retained most of the low rates of the Tariff of 1857, with minor revisions to stimulate revenue.\nWays and Means members Morrill and Henry Winter Davis, a Maryland \"American,\" produced the Republican proposal to raise the tariffs. It replaced the existing \"ad valorem\" tariff schedule with specific duties and drastically increased tariff rates on goods that were produced by popular \"protected\" industries, such as iron, textiles, and other manufactured goods. The economic historian Frank Taussig argued that in many cases, the substitution of specific duties was used to disguise the extent of the rate increases. Supporters of the specific rates argued that they were necessary because European exporters routinely provided US customers with fake invoices showing lower prices for goods than were actually paid. Specific rates made such subterfuge pointless.\nHowever, the House took no action on either tariff bill during the 35th Congress.\nHouse actions.\nWhen the 36th Congress met in 1859, action remained blocked by a dispute until 1860 over who would be elected the Speaker of the House. In 1860, the Republican William Pennington of New Jersey was elected as speaker. Pennington appointed a pro-tariff Republican majority to the Ways and Means Committee, with John Sherman of Ohio its chairman.\nThe Morrill bill was passed out of the Ways and Means Committee. Near the end of first session of the Congress (December 1859\u2013June 1860), on May 10, 1860, the bill was brought up for a floor vote and passed 105\u201364.\nThe vote was largely but not entirely sectional. Republicans, all from the northern states, voted 89\u20132 for the bill. They were joined by 7 northern Democrats from New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. Five of them were \"anti-Lecompton Democrats,\" who opposed the pro-slavery Lecompton Constitution for Kansas.\nAlso, 14 northern Democrats voted against the bill.\nIn the Border States, four \"Opposition\" Representatives from Kentucky voted for it, as did its cosponsor, Winter of Maryland, a Maryland \"Unionist,\" and a Democrat from Delaware. Eight Democrats from the Border States and a member of the American Party from Missouri voted against it.\nThirty-five southern Democrats and three Oppositionists voted against it; one Oppositionist from Tennessee voted for it.\nThus the sectional breakdown was 96\u201315 in the North, 7\u20139 in the Border States, and 1\u201339 in the South.\nThere were 55 abstentions, including 13 Republicans, 12 northern Democrats, 13 southern Democrats, and 8 southern \"Oppositionists\" and \"Americans.\" (The remaining Representatives were mostly \"paired\" with opposing Representatives who could not be present.\nSenate action.\nThe Morrill bill was sent on to the US Senate. However, the Senate was controlled by Democrats and so it was bottled up in the Finance Committee, chaired by Robert M. T. Hunter of Virginia.\nThat ensured that the Senate vote would be put off until the second session in December 1860 and meant that the tariff would be a prominent issue in the 1860 election.\n1860 election.\nThe Republican Party included a strong pro-tariff plank in its 1860 platform and sent prominent tariff advocates touting the bill, such as Morrill and Sherman, to campaign in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, where the tariff was popular. Both Democratic candidates, John C. Breckinridge and Stephen Douglas, opposed all high tariffs and protectionism in general.\nThe historian Reinhard H. Luthin documents the importance of the Morrill Tariff to the Republicans in the 1860 presidential election. Lincoln's record as a protectionist and support for the Morrill bill, he notes, helped him to secure support in the important state of Pennsylvania and neighboring New Jersey. Lincoln carried Pennsylvania handily in November, as part of his sweep of the North.\nOn February 14, 1861, President-elect Lincoln told an audience in Pittsburgh that he would make a new tariff his priority in the next session if the bill did not pass by his inauguration, on March 4.\nRenewed Senate action.\nThe second session of the 36th Congress began in December 1860. At first, it appeared that Hunter would keep the Morrill bill tabled until the end of the term in March.\nHowever, in December 1860 and January 1861, seven southern states seceded, and their low-tariff senators withdrew. Republicans took control of the Senate in February, and Hunter lost his hold on the Finance Committee.\nMeanwhile, the Treasury was in financial crisis, with less than $500,000 on hand and millions in unpaid bills. The Union urgently needed new revenue. A recent historian concludes that \"the impetus for revising the tariff arose as an attempt to augment revenue, stave off 'ruin,' and address the accumulating debt.\"\nThe Morrill bill was brought to the Senate floor for a vote on February 20 and passed 25 to 14. The vote was split almost completely down party lines. It was supported by 24 Republicans and the Democrat William Bigler of Pennsylvania. It was opposed by 10 Southern Democrats, 2 Northern Democrats, and 2 Far West Democrats. Twelve Senators abstained, including 3 Northern Democrats, 1 California Democrat, 5 Southern Democrats, 2 Republicans, and 1 Unionist from Maryland.\nThere were some minor amendments related to the tariffs on tea and coffee, which required a conference committee with the House, but they were resolved, and the final bill was approved by unanimous consent on March 2.\nThough a Democrat himself, President James Buchanan favored the bill because of the interests of his home state, Pennsylvania. He signed the bill into law as one of his last acts in office.\nAdoption and amendments.\nThe tariff took effect one month after it was signed into law. Besides setting tariff rates, the bill altered and restricted the Warehousing Act of 1846.\nThe tariff was drafted and passed the House before the Civil War began or was expected, and it was passed by the Senate after seven States had seceded.\nAt least one author has argued that the first Morrill should not be considered \"Civil War\" legislation.\nIn fact, the tariff proved to be too low for the revenue needs of the Civil War and was quickly raised by the Second Morrill Tariff, or Revenue Act of 1861, later that Fall.\nImpact.\nIn its first year of operation, the Morrill Tariff increased the effective rate collected on dutiable imports by approximately 70%. In 1860, American tariff rates were among the lowest in the world and also at historical lows by 19th-century standards, the average rate for 1857 to 1860 being around 17% overall (\"ad valorem\"), 21% on dutiable items only. The Morrill Tariff immediately raised those averages to about 26% overall, or 36% on dutiable items. Further increases by 1865 left the comparable rates at 38% and 48%. Although higher than in the immediate antebellum period, the new rates were still significantly lower than between 1825 and 1830, when rates had sometimes been over 50%.\nThe United States needed $3 billion to pay for the immense armies and fleets raised to fight the Civil War, over $400\u00a0million for 1862 alone. The chief source of revenue had been tariffs. Therefore, Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase, despite being a longtime free-trader, worked with Morrill to pass a second tariff bill in summer 1861, which raised rates another 10% to generate more revenue. The subsequent bills were primarily revenue driven to meet the war's needs but enjoyed the support of protectionists such as Carey, who again assisted Morrill in the bill's drafting.\nHowever, the tariff played only a modest role in financing the war and was far less important than other measures, such as $2.8 billion in bond sales and some printing of greenbacks. Customs revenue from tariffs totaled $345\u00a0million from 1861 to 1865, or 43% of all federal tax revenue, but military spending totaled $3,065\u00a0million.\nReception abroad.\nThe Morrill Tariff was met with intense hostility in Britain, where free trade dominated public opinion. Southern diplomats and agents sought to use British ire towards the Morrill Tariff to garner sympathy, with the aim of obtaining British recognition for the Confederacy. The new tariff schedule heavily penalized British iron, clothing, and manufactured exports by making them more costly and sparked public outcry from many British politicians. The expectation of high tax rates probably caused British shippers to hasten their deliveries before the new rates took effect in the early summer of 1861.\nWhen complaints were heard from London, Congress counterattacked. The Senate Finance Committee chairman snapped, \"What right has a foreign country to make any question about what we choose to do?\"\nWhen the American Civil War broke out in 1861, British public opinion was sympathetic to the Confederacy, in part because of lingering agitation over the tariff. As one diplomatic historian has explained, the Morrill Tariff:\nnot unnaturally gave great displeasure to England. It greatly lessened the profits of the American markets to English manufacturers and merchants, to a degree which caused serious mercantile distress in that country. Moreover, the British nation was then in the first flush of enthusiasm over free trade, and, under the lead of extremists like Cobden and Gladstone, was inclined to regard a protective tariff as essentially and intrinsically immoral, scarcely less so than larceny or murder. Indeed, the tariff was seriously regarded as comparable in offensiveness with slavery itself, and Englishmen were inclined to condemn the North for the one as much as the South for the other. \"We do not like slavery,\" said Palmerston to Adams, \"but we want cotton, and we dislike very much your Morrill tariff.\"\nMany prominent British writers condemned the Morrill Tariff in the strongest terms. The economist William Stanley Jevons denounced it as a \"retrograde\" law. The famous novelist Charles Dickens used his magazine, \"All the Year Round,\" to attack the new tariff. On December 28, 1861, Dickens published a lengthy article, believed to be written by Henry Morley,\nwhich blamed the American Civil War on the Morrill Tariff:\nIf it be not slavery, where lies the partition of the interests that has led at last to actual separation of the Southern from the Northern States?... Every year, for some years back, this or that Southern state had declared that it would submit to this extortion only while it had not the strength for resistance. With the election of Lincoln and an exclusive Northern party taking over the federal government, the time for withdrawal had arrived... The conflict is between semi-independent communities [in which] every feeling and interest [in the South] calls for political partition, and every pocket interest [in the North] calls for union... So the case stands, and under all the passion of the parties and the cries of battle lie the two chief moving causes of the struggle. Union means so many millions a year lost to the South; secession means the loss of the same millions to the North. The love of money is the root of this, as of many other evils... [T]he quarrel between the North and South is, as it stands, solely a fiscal quarrel.\nOthers, such as John Stuart Mill, denied tariffs had anything to do with the conflict:\n...what are the Southern chiefs fighting about? Their apologists in England say that it is about tariffs, and similar trumpery. They say nothing of the kind. They tell the world, and they told their own citizens when they wanted their votes, that the object of the fight was slavery. Many years ago, when General Jackson was President, South Carolina did nearly rebel (she never was near separating) about a tariff; but no other State abetted her, and a strong adverse demonstration from Virginia brought the matter to a close. Yet the tariff of that day was rigidly protective. Compared with that, the one in force at the time of the secession was a free-trade tariff: This latter was the result of several successive modifications in the direction of freedom; and its principle was not protection for protection, but as much of it only as might incidentally result from duties imposed for revenue. Even the Morrill tariff (which never could have been passed but for the Southern secession) is stated by the high authority of Mr. H. C. Carey to be considerably more liberal than the reformed French tariff under Mr. Cobden's treaty; insomuch that he, a Protectionist, would be glad to exchange his own protective tariff for Louis Napoleon's free-trade one. But why discuss, on probable evidence, notorious facts? The world knows what the question between the North and South has been for many years, and still is. Slavery alone was thought of, alone talked of. Slavery was battled for and against, on the floor of Congress and in the plains of Kansas; on the slavery question exclusively was the party constituted which now rules the United States: on slavery Fremont was rejected, on slavery Lincoln was elected; the South separated on slavery, and proclaimed slavery as the one cause of separation.\nThe communist philosopher Karl Marx also saw slavery as the major cause of the war. Marx wrote extensively in the British press and served as a London correspondent for several North American newspapers including Horace Greeley's \"New York Tribune.\" Marx reacted to those who blamed the war on the Morrill Tariff and argued instead that slavery had induced secession and that the tariff was just a pretext. In October 1861, he wrote:\nNaturally, in America everyone knew that from 1846 to 1861 a free trade system prevailed, and that Representative Morrill carried his protectionist tariff through Congress only in 1861, after the rebellion had already broken out. Secession, therefore, did not take place because the Morrill tariff had gone through Congress, but, at most, the Morrill tariff went through Congress because secession had taken place.\nSeven of the 11 Confederate states had already seceded before the signing of the Morrill Tariff, making it all the more dubious that tariffs caused the Civil War. \nRationale.\nAccording to the historian Heather Cox Richardson, Morrill intended to offer protection to both the usual manufacturing recipients and a broad group of agricultural interests. The purpose was to appease interests beyond the Northeast, which traditionally supported protection. For the first time, protection was extended to every major farm product:\nPlanning to distribute the benefits of a tariff to all sectors of the economy, and also hoping to broaden support for his party, Morrill rejected the traditional system of protection by proposing tariff duties on agricultural, mining, and fishing products, as well as on manufactures. Sugar, wool, flaxseed, hides, beef, pork, corn, grain, hemp, wool, and minerals would all be protected by the Morrill Tariff. The duty on sugar might well be expected to appease Southerners opposed to tariffs, and, notably, wool and flaxseed production were growing industries in the West. The new tariff bill also would protect coal, lead, copper, zinc, and other minerals, all of which the new northwestern states were beginning to produce. The Eastern fishing industry would receive a duty on dried, pickled, and salted fish. \"In adjusting the details of a tariff,\" Morrill explained with a rhetorical flourish in his introduction of the bill, \"I would treat agriculture, manufactures, mining, and commerce, as I would our whole people\u2014as members of one family, all entitled to equal favor, and no one to be made the beast of burden to carry the packs of others.\"\nAccording to Taussig, \"Morrill and the other supporters of the act of 1861 declared that their intention was simply to restore the rates of 1846.\" However, he also gives reason to suspect that the bill's motives were intended to put high rates of protection on iron and wool to attract the West and Pennsylvania:\nThe important change which they (the sponsors) proposed to make from the provisions of the tariff of 1846 was to substitute specific for ad-valorem duties. Such a change from ad-valorem to specific duties is in itself by no means objectionable; but it has usually been made a pretext on the part of protectionists for a considerable increase in the actual duties paid. When protectionists make a change of this kind, they almost invariably make the specific duties higher than the ad-valorem duties for which they are supposed to be an equivalent... The Morrill tariff formed no exception to the usual course of things in this respect. The specific duties which it established were in many cases considerably above the ad-valorem duties of 1846. The most important direct changes made by the act of 1861 were in the increased duties on iron and on wool, by which it was hoped to attach to the Republican party Pennsylvania and some of the Western States\"\nHenry C. Carey, who assisted Morrill in drafting the bill and was one of its most vocal supporters, strongly emphasized its importance to the Republican Party in his January 2, 1861 letter to Lincoln: \"the success of your administration is wholly dependent upon the passage of the Morrill bill at the present session.\" According to Carey:\nWith it, the people will be relieved \u2014 your term will commence with a rising wave of prosperity \u2014 the Treasury will be filled and the party that elected you will be increased and strengthened. Without it, there will be much suffering among the people \u2014 much dissatisfaction with their duties \u2014 much borrowing on the part of the Government \u2014 &amp; very much trouble among the Republican Party when the people shall come to vote two years hence. There is but one way to make the Party a permanent one, &amp; that is, by the prompt repudiation to the free trade system.\nRepresentative John Sherman later wrote:\nThe Morrill tariff bill came nearer than any other to meeting the double requirement of providing ample revenue for the support of the government and of rendering the proper protection to home industries. No national taxes, except duties on imported goods, were imposed at the time of its passage. The Civil War changed all this, reducing importations and adding tenfold to the revenue required. The government was justified in increasing existing rates of duty, and in adding to the dutiable list all articles imported, thus including articles of prime necessity and of universal use. In addition to these duties, it was compelled to add taxes on all articles of home production, on incomes not required for the supply of actual wants, and, especially, on articles of doubtful necessity, such as spirits, tobacco and beer. These taxes were absolutely required to meet expenditures for the army and navy, for the interest on the war debts and just pensions to those who were disabled by the war, and to their widows and orphans.\nSecession.\nRelation to tariff.\nWhile slavery dominated the secession debate in the south, the Morrill tariff provided an issue for secessionist agitation in some southern states. The law's critics compared it to the 1828 Tariff of Abominations, which sparked the Nullification Crisis, but its average rate was significantly lower.\nRobert Barnwell Rhett railed against the pending Morrill Tariff before the 1860 South Carolina convention. Rhett included a lengthy attack on tariffs in the \"Address of South Carolina to Slaveholding States\", which the convention adopted on December 25, 1860, to accompany its secession ordinance:\nAnd so with the Southern States, towards the Northern States, in the vital matter of taxation. They are in a minority in Congress. Their representation in Congress, is useless to protect them against unjust taxation; and they are taxed by the people of the North for their benefit, exactly as the people of Great Britain taxed our ancestors in the British parliament for their benefit. For the last forty years, the taxes laid by the Congress of the United States have been laid with a view of subserving the interests of the North. The people of the South have been taxed by duties on imports, not for revenue, but for an object inconsistent with revenue\u2014 to promote, by prohibitions, Northern interests in the productions of their mines and manufactures.\nThe Morrill Tariff played less prominently elsewhere in the South. In some portions of Virginia, secessionists promised a new protective tariff to assist the state's fledgling industries.\nIn the North, enforcement of the tariff contributed to support for the Union cause by industrialists and merchant interests. The abolitionist Orestes Brownson derisively remarked that \"the Morrill Tariff moved them more than the fall of Sumter.\" In one such example, the \"New York Times\", which had opposed Morrill's bill on free trade grounds, editorialized that the tariff imbalance would bring commercial ruin to the North and urged its suspension until the secession crisis passed: \"We have imposed high duties on our commerce at the very moment the seceding states are inviting commerce to their ports by low duties.\" As secession became more evident and the fledgling Confederacy adopted a much lower tariff, the paper urged military action to enforce the Morrill Tariff in the South.\nHistoriography.\nHistorians, James Huston notes, have been baffled by the role of high tariffs in general and have offered multiple conflicting interpretations over the years. (Low tariffs, all historians agree, were noncontroversial and needed to fund the federal government.) One school of thought says the Republicans were the willing tools of would-be monopolists. A second school says the Republicans truly believed that tariffs would promote nationalism and prosperity for everyone along with balanced growth in every region, as opposed to growth only in the cotton South. A third school emphasizes the undeniable importance of the tariff in cementing party loyalty, especially in industrial states. Another approach emphasizes that factory workers were eager for high tariffs to protect their high wages from European competition.\nCharles A. Beard argued in the 1920s that very long-term economic issues were critical, with the pro-tariff industrial Northeast forming a coalition with the anti-tariff agrarian Midwest against the plantation South.\nAccording to Luthin in the 1940s, \"Historians are not unanimous as to the relative importance which Southern fear and hatred of a high tariff had in causing the secession of the slave states.\" However, none of the statesmen seeking a compromise in 1860\u201361 to avert the war ever suggested the tariff might be either the key to a solution or a cause of the secession.\nIn the 1950s, historians began to move away from the Beard thesis of economic causality. In its place, historians, led by Richard Hofstadter, began to emphasize the social causes of the war as centered on the issue of slavery.\nThe Beard thesis has enjoyed a recent revival among economists, pro-Confederate historians, and neo-Beardian scholars. A 2002 study by economists Robert McGuire and T. Norman Van Cott concluded:\nA de facto constitutional mandate that tariffs lie on the lower end of the Laffer relationship means that the Confederacy went beyond simply observing that a given tax revenue is obtainable with a \"high\" and \"low\" tax rate, a\u00a0la Alexander Hamilton and others. Indeed, the constitutional action suggests that the tariff issue may in fact have been even more important in the North\u2013South tensions that led to the Civil War than many economists and historians currently believe.\nRather than contributing to secession, Marc-William Palen notes how the tariff was passed through Congress only by the secession of Southern states. Thus, secession itself allowed for the bill's passage, rather than the other way around.\nAllan Nevins and James M. McPherson downplay the significance of the tariff; argue that it was peripheral to the issue of slavery; and note that slavery dominated the secessionist declarations, speeches, and pamphlets. Nevins also points to the argument of Alexander Stephens, who disputed Toombs's claims about the severity of the Morrill Tariff. Though initially opposed to secession, Stephens would later cite slavery as the \"cornerstone\" for his support of secession.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In all, more than of public land, or nearly 10\u00a0percent of the total area of the United States, were given away free to 1.6\u00a0million homesteaders; most of the homesteads were west of the Mississippi River.\nAn extension of the homestead principle in law, the Homestead Acts were an expression of the Free Soil policy of Northerners who wanted individual farmers to own and operate their own farms, as opposed to Southern slave owners who wanted to buy up large tracts of land and use slave labor, thereby shutting out free white farmers.\nFor a number of years individual Congressmen put forward bills providing for homesteading, but it was not until 1862 that the first homestead act was passed. The Homestead Act of 1862 opened up millions of acres. Any adult who had never taken up arms against the federal government of the United States could apply. Women and immigrants who had applied for citizenship were eligible. Most homesteading occurred during the period of 1900\u20131930. As of 2017, around 93 million Americans were descendants of people who received land through the Homestead Acts.\nBackground.\nLand-grant laws similar to the Homestead Acts had been proposed by northern Republicans prior to Civil War but they had been repeatedly blocked in Congress by Democrats who wanted western lands open for purchase by slave owners. The Homestead Act of 1860 passed in Congress but was vetoed by President James Buchanan, a Democrat. After the Southern states seceded from the Union in 1861 (and their representatives had left Congress), the bill passed and was signed into law by President Abraham Lincoln (May 20, 1862). Daniel Freeman became the first person to file a claim under the new act.\nBetween 1862 and 1934, the federal government granted 1.6 million homesteads and distributed of federal land for private ownership. This was a total of 10% of all land in the United States. Homesteading was discontinued in 1976, except in Alaska, where it continued until 1986. About 40% of the applicants who started the process were able to complete it and obtain title to their homesteaded land after paying a small fee in cash.\nHomestead laws depleted Native American resources as much of the land they relied on was taken by the federal government and sold to settlers. Native ancestral lands had been limited through history, mainly through land allotments and reservations, causing a gradual decrease in this Indigenous land. Many of these land-grabs occurred during and after treaty negotiations between Indigenous tribes and the United States. Native Americans often traded their land in exchange for citizenship and civil rights. Due to the United States' economic power, these tribes had little leverage and millions of acres of land were transferred from their ownership. It was difficult for Indigenous people to legally challenge this infringement because they lacked legal rights and legal standing. These treaties were used to naturalize and civilize Native Americans. Native Americans were not allowed to file land claims under the Homestead Acts unless they renounced their tribal citizenship.\nAs an indirect, de facto way to secure the dispossessed land, the US government allowed late homesteading during the early twentieth century. This acted as a way to solidify settlements and permanently disrupt tribal land practices in the face of backlash.\nThis Homestead Acts also resulted in tensions between settlers and Indigenous people, partly due to settlers moving onto Indigenous territory while it was still occupied. Settlements excused Indian removal and culminated in multiple wars waged by settler militia.\nAlso involved in the acts were Buffalo soldiers, African-American soldiers who were key in building the American frontier in the West. They often engaged in wars with Native Americans, led by the government, to take over Indigenous land.\nSome settlers in the Dakota Territory, and later in South Dakota and North Dakota, who gained land through the Homestead Acts were Jewish or Muslim. Jewish homesteaders were largely Russian Jews fleeing pogroms in the Russian Empire. Syro-Lebanese Muslim settlers who gained land through the Homestead Acts created a settlement in Ross, North Dakota, where they would later found the first mosque in the United States.\nSome homesteaders were Hispanics and Latinos. Hispanic and Latino homesteaders included Chilean immigrants, Mexican immigrants, and US-born Latinos. Some US-born Latinos from New Mexico moved north to Colorado to become homesteaders.\nFew homesteaders were Asian during the 1800s, as the Naturalization Act denied citizenship to Asians. The Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Wong Kim Ark (1898), which affirmed birthright citizenship for Chinese Americans, opened the Homestead Acts to Asian Americans.\nHistory.\nPreemption Act of 1841.\nThe Preemption Act of 1841 allowed settlers to claim up to 160 acres of federal land for themselves and prevent its sale to others including large landowners or corporations; they paid only a low fixed price of $1.25 per acre ($3.09 per hectare). To qualify, a person had to be either 21 years old or a \"head of household\" (such as a parent or surviving sibling supporting a family), a citizen or an immigrant declaring to become a citizen, and a resident on that land for a minimum of 14 months. To get permanent title to the land, the person had to accomplish certain actions, such as continue to reside on it or improve it for at least five years; they could not leave or abandon it for more than six months at a time.\nDonation Land Claim Act of 1850.\nThe Donation Land Claim Act allowed settlers to claim land in the Oregon Territory, then including the modern states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho and parts of Wyoming. The Oregon Donation Land Claim Act was passed in 1850 and allowed white settlers to claim 320 acres or 640 to married couples between 1850 and 1855 when the act was repealed. Before it was repealed in 1855, the land was sold for $1.25 per acre. After the creation of the Oregon territory in 1848, the US government had passed the most generous land distribution bill in US history.\nThe Oregon Land Donation Act of 1850 had many negative effects on Indigenous people as well as Black people in the Pacific Northwest. Not only did the act use the land taken away from the Indigenous people in the Pacific Northwest, but the act also barred Black citizens from owning land and real estate. The act guaranteed land for White settlers and \"half-breed\" Indian men to the Oregon territory. This act followed the passing of the 1848 territorial organic act which allowed any white settler to claim a maximum of six hundred and forty acres. The Land Donation Act, however, also acknowledged women's property rights due to Congress allowing the donation of four hundred acres to settlers\u2014land that could be claimed by heads of households\u2014including women. This act differed from the Homestead Act of 1866 due to the ineligibility of Black citizens from applying.\nHomestead Act of 1862.\nThe \"yeoman farmer\" ideal of Jeffersonian democracy was still a powerful influence in American politics during the 1840\u20131850s, with many politicians believing a homestead act would help increase the number of \"virtuous yeomen\". The Free Soil Party of 1848\u201352, and the new Republican Party after 1854, demanded that the new lands opening up in the west be made available to independent farmers, rather than wealthy planters who would develop it with the use of slaves forcing the yeomen farmers onto marginal lands. Southern Democrats had continually fought (and defeated) previous homestead law proposals, as they feared free land would attract European immigrants and poor Southern whites to the west.\nThe intent of the Homestead Act of 1862 was to reduce the cost of homesteading under the Preemption Act; after the South seceded and their delegates left Congress in 1861, the Republicans and supporters from the upper South passed a homestead act signed by Abraham Lincoln on May 20, 1862, which went into effect on Jan. 1st, 1863. Its leading advocates were Andrew Johnson, George Henry Evans, and Horace Greeley. George Henry Evans famously coined the phrase \"Vote Yourself a Farm\" in a bid to garner support for the movement.\nIn addition to the previous requirement in the Preemption Act of being either 21 years old or the head of a family, the 1862 act also allowed for persons under 21 who had served in the regular or volunteer forces of the U.S. army or navy for at least 14 days during \"the existence of an actual war domestic or foreign\".\nThe new act also required that the person \"has never borne arms against the United States Government or given aid and comfort to its enemies\"; unlike the 1848 and 1850 laws, it did not have any provision mentioning race. The act gave citizens or intended citizens 160 acres of surveyed public land if they improved their plot by cultivating the land.\nThe Homestead act expanded, rather than changed, the 1841 Preemption Act. The claimed homestead could include the same land which they had previously filed a preemption claim (on up to 160 acres at $1.25 per acre, or up to 80 acres of subdivided and surveyed land at $2.50 per acre), and they could expand their current ownership to contiguous adjacent land up to 160 acres total.\nThe homestead application must be \"made for his or her exclusive use and benefit, and that said entry [onto public land] is made for the purpose of actual settlement and cultivation, and not either directly or indirectly for the use or benefit of any other person or persons whomsoever\". The acquired land would not be liable for any debts incurred prior to the issuance of the patent for it.\nThe time requirement for residence or cultivation was set at 5 years; if it was proven \"after due notice\" that they moved residence or abandoned the land for more than six months at a time, then the land reverted to the government. A homesteader could also pay the $1.25 (or the current rate) per acre price after proof of the less-stringent requirements set in the Preemption Act.\nAfter filing an affidavit with the government's agent, and paying him a $10 fee, the homesteader could begin occupying their claim. The government agent received the same fee for homestead land as he would have received if that land was sold for cash, 1/2 from the homesteader's filing fee and the other half from the patent (certificate) fee. The homesteader did not get a certificate or patent until they or their heirs filed, after 5 years (but before 7 years), further affidavits from two neighbors or \"credible witnesses\" and an additional $8 fee. Those affidavits affirmed the 5 years of residence or cultivation and that \"no part of said land has been alienated [transferred or mortgaged], and that he [the homesteader] has borne true allegiance to the Government of the United States\".\nIf both parents died and all the children were under 21, an executor under state law could sell (for the benefit of the children, and not the estate) an absolute title to the land within two years of the parent's death. The purchaser would pay office fees for a patent to the land.\nSouthern Homestead Act of 1866.\nThe act was enacted to allow poor tenant farmers and sharecroppers in the South to become landowners in the Southern United States during Reconstruction. In the South, poor farmers and sharecroppers made up the majority of the population so the act sold land at a lower price to decrease poverty among the working class.\nIt was not very successful, as even the low prices and fees were often too much for the applicants to afford. The land made available was also mostly undeveloped forestry, and only white people had the means to make them productive.\nTimber Culture Act of 1873.\nThe Timber Culture Act granted up to 160 acres of land to a homesteader who would plant at least 40 acres (revised to 10) of trees over a period of several years. This quarter-section could be added to an existing homestead claim, offering a total of 320 acres to a settler.\nIndian Homestead Act of 1875.\nThe 1862 Homestead Act did not include Indigenous peoples, so Congress passed the Indian Homestead Act to give Native family heads the opportunity to purchase homesteads from unclaimed public lands. This was under the condition that the individual relinquished their tribal identity and relations, along with the land improvement requirements. The federal land title was not officially granted to Native Americans until a period of five years had passed.\nBecause the US government did not issue fee waivers, many poor non-reservation Natives were unable to pay filing fees to claim homesteads. Access to such homesteads was further complicated by delays in resolving border disputes due to distance and discord between the US Land Office and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. This made white settlements easier to finalize.\nKinkaid Amendment of 1904.\nRecognizing that the Sandhills of north-central Nebraska required more than 160 acres for a claimant to support a family, Congress passed the Kinkaid Act, which granted larger homestead tracts, up to 640 acres, to homesteaders in Nebraska.\nForest Homestead Act of 1906.\nThis act allowed homesteads within Forest Reserves (created from 1891 on) and National Forests (from 1905? on), responding to opponents of the nation's Forest Reserves who felt land suited for agriculture was being withheld from private development. Homestead applications were reviewed by the U.S. Forest Service (created in 1905). While at first five years residency was required (per the 1862 Act), in 1913 this act was amended to allow proving up in just three years.\nEnlarged Homestead Act of 1909.\nBecause by the early 1900s much of the prime low-lying alluvial land along rivers had been homesteaded, the \"Enlarged Homestead Act\" was passed in 1909. To enable dryland farming, it increased the number of acres for a homestead to given to farmers who accepted more marginal lands (especially in the Great Plains), which could not be easily irrigated.\nA massive influx of these new farmers, combined with inappropriate cultivation techniques and misunderstanding of the ecology, led to immense land erosion and eventually the Dust Bowl of the 1930s.\nStock-Raising Homestead Act of 1916.\nIn 1916, the \"Stock-Raising Homestead Act\" was passed for settlers seeking of public land for ranching purposes.\nSubsistence Homesteads provisions under the New Deal \u2013 1930s.\nRenewed interest in homesteading was brought about by U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt's program of Subsistence Homesteading implemented in the 1930s under the New Deal.\nSmall Tracts Act.\nIn 1938 Congress passed a law, called the Small Tract Act (STA) of 1938, by which it is possible for any citizen to obtain certain lands from the Federal Government for residence, recreation, or business purposes. These tracts may not usually be larger than 5 acres. A 5-acre tract would be one which is 660 feet long and 330 feet wide, or its equivalent. The property was to be improved with a building. Starting July 1955, improvement was required to be minimum of 400 sq. feet of space. 4,000 previously classified Small Tracts were offered at public auction at fair market value, circa 1958, by the Los Angeles Office of BLM.\nIn practice.\nSettlers found land and filed their claims at the regional land office, usually in individual family units, although others formed closer-knit communities. Often, the homestead consisted of several buildings or structures besides the main house.\nThe Homestead Act of 1862 gave rise later to a new phenomenon, large land rushes, such as the Oklahoma Land Runs of the 1880s and 90s.\nEnd under Federal Land Policy and Management Act.\nThe Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 ended homesteading; by that time, federal government policy had shifted to retaining control of western public lands. The only exception to this new policy was in Alaska, for which the law allowed homesteading until 1986.\nElizabeth (Betty) Clouse-Smith was the last woman homesteader to successfully prove up land in her own name. She was among a group of people, including her son William J. Smith, who filed for homestead west of Big Delta, Alaska. On October 18, 1984, she received a patent for her .\nThe last claim under this Act was made by Ken Deardorff for of land on the Stony River in southwestern Alaska. He fulfilled all requirements of the homestead act in 1979 but did not receive his deed until May 1988. He is the last person to receive a title to land claimed under the Homestead Acts.\nIssues and concerns.\nThe Homestead Acts were sometimes abused, but historians continue to debate the extent. In the 1950s and 1960s, historians Fred Albert Shannon, Roy Robbins, and Paul Wallace Gates emphasized fraudulent episodes, and historians largely turned away from the issue. In recent decades, however, the argument has mostly been that on the whole fraud was a relatively minor element and that strongly positive impacts regarding women and the family have only recently been appreciated. Robert Higgs argues that the Homestead Act induced no long-term misallocation of resources. In 1995, a random survey of 178 members of the Economic History Association found that 70 percent of economists and 84 percent of economic historians disagreed with the statement \"Nineteenth-century U.S. land policy, which attempted to give away free land, probably represented a net drain on the productive capacity of the country.\"\nSome scholars believe the acreage limits were reasonable when the act was written but argue that no one understood the physical conditions of the plains. After a few generations, a family could build up a sizable estate.\nAccording to Hugh Nibley, much of the rainforest west of Portland, Oregon, was acquired by the Oregon Lumber Company by illegal claims under the Act.\nRacism.\nSeveral additional laws were enacted in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to address the concerns of African Americans. The Southern Homestead Act of 1866 sought to address land ownership inequalities in the south during Reconstruction. It explicitly included Black Americans and encouraged them to participate, and, although rampant discrimination, systemic barriers, and bureaucratic inertia considerably slowed Black gains, the 1866 law was part of the reason that within a generation after its passage, by 1900, one quarter of all Southern Black farmers were farm owners. Later Homestead acts only marginally benefited African Americans.\nRelated acts in other countries.\nCanada.\nSimilar laws were passed in Canada:\nThe Legislative Assembly of Ontario passed \"The Free Grants and Homestead Act\" in 1868, which introduced a conditional scheme to an existing free grant plan previously authorized by the Province of Canada in \"The Public Lands Act\" of 1860. It was extended to include settlement in the Rainy River District under \"The Rainy River Free Grants and Homestead Act, 1886\", These Acts were consolidated in 1913 in \"The Public Lands Act\", which was further extended in 1948 to provide for free grants to former members of the Canadian Forces. The original free grant provisions for settlers were repealed in 1951, and the remaining provisions were repealed in 1961.\nThe Parliament of Canada passed the \"Dominion Lands Act\" in 1872 in order to encourage settlement in the Northwest Territories. Its application was restricted after the passage of the Natural Resources Acts in 1930, and it was finally repealed in 1950.\nThe Legislative Assembly of Quebec did not expand the scope of the 1860 Province of Canada Act (which modern day Quebec was part of in 1860), but did provide in 1868 that such lands were exempt from seizure, and chattels thereon were also exempt for the first ten years of occupation. Later known as the \"Settlers Protection Act\", it was repealed in 1984.\nNewfoundland and Labrador provided for free grants of land upon proof of possession for twenty years prior to 1977, with continuous use for agricultural, business or residential purposes during that time. Similar programs continued to operate in Alberta and British Columbia until 1970. In the early 21st century, some land is still being granted in the Yukon Territory under its Agricultural Lands Program.\nNew Zealand.\nDespite the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi provisions for sale of land, the M\u0101ori Land Court decided that all land not cultivated by M\u0101ori was 'waste land' and belonged to the Crown without purchase. Most provinces in colonial New Zealand had Waste Lands Acts enacted between 1854 and 1877. The 1874 Waste Lands Act in Auckland Province used the term Homestead, with allocation administered by a Crown Lands Board. There was similar legislation in Westland. It gave up to , with settlers just paying the cost of a survey. They had to live there for five years, build a house and cultivate a third of the land, if already open, or a fifth if bush had to be cleared. The land was forfeited if they didn't clear enough bush. Further amendments were made in 1877, 1882 and 1885, adding details such as pastoral and perpetual leases and village and special settlements. This contributed to rapid deforestation.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

For most of the early 19th-century, the idea was prevalent among the Whig Party and what would become the Midwest. President George Washington called for public support of agricultural education in his 1796 address to Congress. \nThe idea to fund agricultural colleges with public land appropriations was championed by agriculturist and professor Jonathan Baldwin Turner of Illinois College in the 1830s. \nEfforts for a federal bill were stymied by antebellum politics. Southern legislators blocked attempts for an agricultural college bill. However, some Northern states introduced and funded their own, years prior to the national bill. \nThe Michigan Constitution of 1850 called for the creation of an \"agricultural school\", though it was not until February 12, 1855, that Michigan governor Kinsley S. Bingham signed a bill establishing the United States' first agriculture college, the Agricultural College of the State of Michigan, known today as Michigan State University, which served as a model for the Morrill Act.\nOn February 8, 1853, the Illinois Legislature adopted a resolution, drafted by Turner, calling for the Illinois congressional delegation to work to enact a land-grant bill to fund a system of industrial colleges, one in each state. Senator Lyman Trumbull of Illinois believed it was advisable that the bill should be introduced by an eastern congressman, and two months later Representative Justin Smith Morrill of Vermont introduced his bill.\nUnlike the Turner Plan, which provided an equal grant to each state, the Morrill bill allocated land based on the number of senators and representatives each state had in Congress. This was more advantageous to the more populous eastern states.\nThe Morrill Act was first proposed in 1857, and was passed by Congress in 1859, but it was vetoed by President James Buchanan.\nThe Morrill Act of 1862.\nMorrill and his Republican allies saw a new opportunity to pass an agricultural college bill. The secession of Southern states meant there would be far less opposition. In 1861, Morrill resubmitted the act with the amendment that the proposed institutions would teach military tactics as well as engineering and agriculture. The reconfigured Morrill Act was signed into law by President Abraham Lincoln on July 2, 1862. The 1862 act provided each state land scrip for of public land for each of its representatives and senators in Congress. Sale of this scrip funded the beginning of land-grant colleges. The act stipulated these funds be used for theendowment, support, and maintenance of at least one college where the leading object shall be, without excluding other scientific and classical studies, and including military tactics, to teach such branches of learning as are related to agriculture and the mechanic arts, in such manner as the legislatures of the States may respectively prescribe, in order to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes in the several pursuits and professions in life.Under provision six of the Act, \"No State while in a condition of rebellion or insurrection against the government of the United States shall be entitled to the benefit of this act,\" in reference to the recent secession of several Southern states and the contemporaneously raging American Civil War. Upon reentry in the union, states received their land scrip for an agricultural college.\nOn September 12, 1862, the state of Iowa was the first to accept the terms of the Morrill Act which provided the funding boost needed for the fledgling State Agricultural College and Model Farm. The first land-grant institution actually created under the Act was Kansas State University, which was established in 1863.\nEach state had wide discretion on how to use its funds. Some states added agricultural and mechanic colleges to its already existing flagship university, as with the University of Wisconsin and the University of Georgia. Some states created new state colleges separate from their flagship institutions, as with what would become Mississippi State University or expanded their new agricultural colleges (as with Michigan State University). \nSome states did not have a state college of any kind in 1862, and used their land-grant funds to create one, as with the University of Nevada. Once new states were incorporated in the United States, they were able to access land-grant funds (as with the University of Nebraska), and eventually, federal territories started their agricultural college before statehood. The latest school created with funds via the 1862 Act was the University of Alaska Fairbanks, founded in 1917.\nThe granted land.\nIf the federal land within a state was insufficient to meet that state's land grant, the state was issued scrip which authorized the state to select federal lands in other states to fund its institution. For example, New York carefully selected valuable timber land in Wisconsin to fund Cornell University. The resulting management of this scrip by the university yielded one third of the total grant revenues generated by all the states, even though New York received only one-tenth of the 1862 land grant. Overall, the 1862 Morrill Act allocated of land, which when sold yielded a collective endowment of $7.55 million.\nThe U.S. government had acquired most of that land via lopsided treaties and violent conflict throughout the 19th century. In total, 162 violence-backed cessions expropriated approximately 10.7 million acres of land from 245 tribal nations and divided it into roughly 80,000 parcels for redistribution. \nMorrill Act of 1890.\nThe second Morrill Act was aimed at the former Confederate states. By 1890, efforts to reconstruct the South and create a biracial democracy had failed, and white supremacy was law. Black students were barred from public institutions, including schools.\nThe 1890 act required each state to show that race was not an admissions criterion, or else to designate a separate land-grant institution for African Americans. Southern states decided on the latter. Thus, the second Morrill Act facilitated segregated education, although it also provided higher educational opportunities for African Americans who otherwise would not have had them. Among the seventy colleges and universities which eventually evolved from the Morrill Acts are several of today's historically Black colleges and universities. \nThough the 1890 Act granted cash instead of land, it granted colleges under that act the same legal standing as the 1862 Act colleges; hence the term \"land-grant college\" properly applies to both groups.\nEquity in Educational Land-Grant Status Act of 1994.\nThe 1994 expansion added tribal colleges and universities to the land-grant system. Like the 1890 schools, they are not funded via land grants but are considered land-grant schools in accordance with the 1862 Morrill Act. 1994 schools receive Congressional apportionments, are chartered by American Indian nations, and predominantly enroll Native students. There are 35 1994 land-grant schools, as of 2023.\nRelated legislation.\nHatch Act of 1887.\nStarting in 1887, Congress funded agricultural experiment stations and various categories of agricultural and veterinary research \"under direction of\" the land-grant universities.\nFaculty at land-grant schools wanted greater opportunities to experiment and institutionalize knowledge. By the early 1880s, enough states were struggling with the need for institutionalizing agricultural research that sentiment for a concerted national approach was revived. Seaman A. Knapp, a professor at Iowa State College, authored a proposal calling for an agricultural experiment station in each state to be funded out of the national treasury. The concept found favorability in the House agriculture committee then chaired by Rep. William H. Hatch of Missouri. The Hatch Act was signed into law by President Grover Cleveland on March 2, 1887, giving each land-grant college $15,000 annually to support an experiment station.\nSmith\u2013Lever Act of 1914.\nLand-grant schools later recognized the need to disseminate the knowledge gained at the land-grant colleges to farmers and homemakers. The Smith\u2013Lever Act of 1914 started federal funding of cooperative extensions, operated by the land-grant school. Agricultural agents were sent to virtually every county of every state to disseminate knowledge and demonstrate techniques to farmers.\nEffects.\nThough the Congressional debates about the Act were largely focused on benefits to agriculture, the land grant colleges transformed engineering education in America and boosted the United States into a position of leader in technical education. Before the Civil War, American colleges primarily trained students in classical studies and the liberal arts. For the most part, only the relatively affluent could afford higher education, and entrance requirements often required proficiency in the dead languages of Latin and Ancient Greek. The first Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degrees, which typically required no Latin, came into being around 1850. \nAmerican engineers were mostly educated at the United States Military Academy, on fortress construction, and their instructors were the authors of most engineering texts of the day. Though the Congressional debates about the Act were largely focused on benefits to agriculture, the mechanic arts (meaning applied sciences and engineering). Whereas in 1866 there were around 300 American men who had graduated with engineering degrees and only six reputable colleges granting them, just four years later there were 21 colleges offering engineering degrees and the total number of engineers graduated had tripled to 866. The following decade added another 2,249 engineers, and by 1911 the United States was graduating 3,000 engineers a year, with a total of 38,000 in the work force. At the time, Germany was graduating 1,800 engineers per year. The US had become the leader in technical education just 50 years after passage of the Morrill Act.In imitation of the land-grant colleges' focus on agricultural and mechanical research, Congress later established programs of sea grant colleges (aquatic research, in 1966), urban grant colleges (urban research, in 1985), space grant colleges (space research, in 1988), and sun grant colleges (sustainable energy research, in 2003).\nIn the fiscal year 2006 USDA budget, $1.033 billion went to research and cooperative extension activities nationwide. For this purpose, then-President George W. Bush proposed a $1.035 billion appropriation for fiscal year 2008.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In opposition to President Abraham Lincoln's more lenient ten percent plan, the bill made re-admittance to the Union for former Confederate states contingent on a majority in each ex-Confederate state to take the Ironclad Oath to the effect they had never in the past supported the Confederacy. The bill passed both houses of Congress on July 2, 1864, but was pocket vetoed by Lincoln and never took effect. The Radical Republicans were outraged that Lincoln did not sign the bill. Lincoln wanted to mend the Union by carrying out the ten percent plan. He believed it would be too difficult to repair all of the ties within the Union if the Wade\u2013Davis bill passed.\nBackground.\nThe Wade\u2013Davis Bill emerged from a plan introduced in the Senate by Ira Harris of New York in February, 1863.\nIt was written by two Radical Republicans, Senator Benjamin Wade of Ohio and Representative Henry Winter Davis of Maryland, and proposed to base the Reconstruction of the South on the federal government's power to guarantee a republican form of government. The Bill was also important for national and congressional power. Although federally imposed conditions of reconstruction retrospectively seem logical, there was a widespread belief that southern Unionism would return the seceded states to the Union after the Confederacy's military power was broken. This belief was not fully abandoned until later in 1863. The provisions, critics complained, were virtually impossible to meet, thus making it likely there would be permanent national control over the states formerly in rebellion.\nLegislative history.\nHouse of Representatives.\nThe bill was formally introduced February 15, 1864, as . The final vote of the house was 73\u201359.\nLincoln's veto.\nOne of Lincoln's objections was to the idea that seceded states needed to \"re-join\" the Union (an idea that permeated the whole bill). From Lincoln's point of view, states were not constitutionally allowed to secede in the first place, so the ordinances of secession were null and void from the moment they passed. Thus the war was being fought to \"compel the obedience of rebellious individuals,\u201d not of rebellious states per se. The language of the bill undermined this argument, as the possibility of Confederate states being \u201creadmitted\u201d implied those states in rebellion were not part of the Union anymore. Moreover, the bill compelled those states to draft new Constitutions banning slavery, which was arguably unconstitutional at the time (as Congress had no power to deal with slavery within individual states).\nOn a more pragmatic level, Lincoln also feared the bill would sabotage his own reconstruction activities in states like Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee, all of which had passed ordinances of secession but were under Federal occupation and controlled by pro-Union governments. He believed that Wade\u2013Davis would jeopardize state-level emancipation movements in loyal border states like Missouri and, especially, Maryland. The bill threatened to destroy the delicate political coalitions which Lincoln had begun to construct between Northern and Southern moderates. More broadly, it underscored how differently Lincoln and Radical Republicans viewed Confederates: Lincoln believed they could be coaxed back into peaceful coexistence, while Radical Republicans believed the Confederates were traitors and therefore could not be trusted. Lincoln ended up killing the bill with a pocket veto, and it was not resurrected.\nThe aftermath.\nDavis was a bitter enemy of Lincoln because he believed that the President was too lenient in his policies for the South. Davis and Wade issued a manifesto \"To the Supporters of the Government\" on August 4, 1864, accusing Lincoln of using reconstruction to secure electors in the South who would \"be at the dictation of his personal ambition,\" and condemning what they saw as his efforts to usurp power from Congress (\"the authority of Congress is \"paramount\" and must be respected\"). The Manifesto backfired, however, and while it initially caused much debate on the nature of the Reconstruction to come, Winter Davis was not renominated for his Congressional seat in Maryland. Its ideas, particularly that Congress should be the main driver of the post-war process and that the Presidency should be a weaker office (the President \"must confine himself to his executive duties \u2013 \"to obey and execute\", not to make the laws \u2013, to suppress by arms armed rebellion, and leave political reorganization to Congress\"), did influence Congressional Republicans during the following years, however, eventually leading to Andrew Johnson's impeachment trial.\nLincoln survived their attacks and greatly strengthened his position with a landslide victory in the 1864 election, and national passage of the Thirteenth Amendment in February, 1865. He momentarily marginalized the Radicals in terms of shaping Reconstruction policy. After Lincoln's death, Radical Republicans battled President Andrew Johnson, who tried to implement a version of Lincoln's plan. The midterm elections of 1866 turned into a referendum on the Fourteenth amendment and the trajectory of Reconstruction policy. With the Republicans' victory, Congress took control of Reconstruction. The radicals wanted a much harsher plan, but they did not try to reimpose the terms of Wade-Davis. Instead they implemented the Reconstruction Acts and took control of the former rebel states with the United States Army, which registered black men as voters and barred some former Confederate leaders from running for office.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "55596", "revid": "45451381", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55596", "title": "National Bank Act", "text": "Primary federal legislation in the US\nThe National Banking Acts of 1863 and 1864 were two United States federal banking acts that established a system of national banks chartered at the federal level, and created the United States National Banking System. They encouraged development of a national fiat currency backed by bank holdings of U.S. Treasury securities and established the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency as part of the United States Department of the Treasury. The Act shaped today's national banking system and its support of a uniform U.S. banking policy.\nBackground.\nAntebellum Period.\nAt the end of the Second Bank of the United States in 1836, the control of banking regimes devolved mostly to the states. Different states adopted policies including a total ban on banking (as in Wisconsin), a single state-chartered bank (as in Indiana and Illinois), limited chartering of banks (as in Ohio), and free entry (as in New York). While the relative success of New York's \"free banking\" laws led several states also to adopt a free-entry banking regime, the system remained poorly integrated across state lines. Though all banknotes were uniformly denominated in dollars, notes would often circulate at a steep discount in states beyond their issue.\nIn the end, well-publicized frauds arose in states like Michigan, which had adopted free entry regimes but did not require the redeemability of bank issues for specie. The perception of dangerous \"wildcat banking\u201d, along with the poor integration of the U.S. banking system, led to increasing public support for a uniform national banking regime.\nThe United States government, on the other hand, still had limited taxation capabilities and so had an interest in the seigniorage potential of a national bank. In 1846, the Polk Administration created a United States Treasury system that moved public funds from private banks to Treasury branches to fund the Mexican\u2013American War. However, the revenue generated this way was limited without a national currency.\nCivil War.\nThis became more urgent during the Civil War, when Congress and Lincoln were struggling to finance the war efforts. Without a national mechanism for issuing currency other than metal coinage, the Lincoln administration could not exploit the powers and loopholes that, for example, Britain could with its central bank, in order to finance the high expenses involved. Previously, the damage that would be done to state banks by national competition was sufficient to prevent significant national bank chartering. But using the war crisis, Lincoln was able to expand this effort.\nOne of the first attempts to issue a national currency came in the early days of the Civil War when Congress approved the Legal Tender Act of 1862, allowing the issue of $150 million in national notes known as greenbacks and mandating that paper money be issued and accepted in lieu of gold and silver coins. The bills were fiat money backed only by the national government's promise to redeem them and their value was dependent on public confidence in the government as well as the ability of the government to give out specie in exchange for the bills in the future. Many thought this promise backing the bills was about as good as the green ink printed on one side, hence the name \"greenbacks.\"\nThe Second Legal Tender Act, enacted July 11, 1862, a Joint Resolution of Congress, and the Third Legal Tender Act, enacted March 3, 1863, expanded the limit to $450 million. The largest amount of greenbacks outstanding at any one time was calculated as $447,300,203.10.\nThe National Bank Act (ch. 58, 12\u00a0Stat.\u00a0https://; February 25, 1863), originally known as the National Currency Act, was passed in the Senate by a 23\u201321 vote, and was supplemented a year later by the National Banking Act of 1864. The goals of these acts was to create a single national currency, a nationalized bank chartering system, and to raise money for the Union war effort. The Act established national banks that could issue National Bank Notes which were backed by the United States Treasury and printed by the government itself. The quantity of notes that a bank was allowed to issue was proportional to the bank's level of capital deposited with the Comptroller of the Currency at the Treasury. To further control the currency, the Act taxed notes issued by state and local banks, essentially pushing non-federally issued paper currency out of circulation.\nSince the establishment of the Republic, state governments had held authority to regulate banks. Before the act, state legislatures typically issued bank charters on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration whether the area needed a new bank, and if the applicant was of good moral standing. As this system could be subject to corruption, states began passing \"free banking\" laws in 1837, which meant that any applicant who filled out the correct paperwork and deposited an in-kind payment to the state would be granted a charter. By the 1860s, over half of states had such a law on the books. However, the National Banking Act of 1864 (ch. 106, 13\u00a0Stat.\u00a0https://; June 3, 1864) brought a close to the issue by establishing federally-issued bank charters, which took banking out of the hands of state governments. The first bank to receive a national charter was the First National Bank of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (Charter #1). The first new national bank to open was The First National Bank of Davenport, Iowa (Charter #15). Additionally, more than 1,500 state banks converted themselves to national banks.\nNational Bank Acts.\nNational Bank Act of 1863.\nThe National Bank Act of 1863, also known as the National Currency Act of 1863, was passed on February 25, 1863, and was the first attempt to establish a federal banking system after the failures of the First and Second Banks of the United States, and served as the predecessor to the Federal Reserve Act of 1913. The act allowed the creation of national banks, set out a plan for establishing a national currency backed by government securities held by other banks, and gave the federal government the ability to sell war bonds and securities (in order to help the war effort). National banks were chartered by the federal government, and were subject to stricter regulation, particularly the requirement that no less than 1/3 of the bank's capital had to take the form of US Government bonds, which were held in the vault of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. A high tax on state banks was levied to discourage competition, and by 1865 most state banks had either received national charters or collapsed.\nNational Bank Act of 1864.\nThe 1864 act, based on a New York State law, brought the federal government into active supervision of commercial banks.\nNational Bank Acts of 1865 and 1866.\nFurther acts passed in 1865 and 1866 imposed a tax to speed the adoption of the system. All banks (national or otherwise) had to pay a 10 percent tax on payments that they made in currency notes other than national bank notes. The tax rate was intentionally set so high as to effectively prohibit further circulation of state bank and private notes. By this time the conversion from state banks to national banks was well underway. The constitutionality of the tax came before the Supreme Court in \"Veazie Bank v. Fenno\", a case by a state-chartered Maine bank and the collector of internal revenue. The Court ruled 7\u20132 in favor of the government. State banks declined until the 1870s, when the growing popularity of checks and the declining profitability of national bank currency issues caused a resurgence.\nResurgence of state banks.\nThe granting of charters led to the creation of many national banks and a national banking system which grew at a fast pace. The number of national banks rose from 66 immediately after the Act to 7,473 in 1913. Initially, this rise in national banking came at the expense of state banking\u2014the number of state banks dwindled from 1,466 in 1863 to 247 in 1868. Though state banks were no longer allowed to issue notes, local bankers took advantage of less strict capital requirements ($10,000 for state banks vs. $50,000\u2013200,000 for national banks) and opened new branches en masse. These new state banks then served as competition for national banks, growing to 15,526 in number by 1913.\nHugh McCulloch originally opposed the National Banking Act but it grew on him and he organized the Currency Bureau. Part of his plans to revamp this portion of the banking system included hiring a new staff, being hands-on with several aspects such as \"personally evaluating applications for bank charters and consoled prospective bankers\", and \"assisting in the design of the new national bank notes, and arranged for their engraving, printing, and distribution.\" As an result of McCulloch's efforts, many banks were just not willing to conform to his system of operations. This prompted Congress to pass \"a 10 percent tax on the notes of state banks, signaling its determination that national banks would triumph and the state banks would fade away.\"\nA later act, passed on March 3, 1865, imposed a tax of 10 percent on the notes of state banks to take effect on July 1, 1866. Similar to previous taxes, this effectively forced all non-federal currency from circulation. It also resulted in the creation of demand deposit accounts, and encouraged banks to join the national system, increasing the number of national banks substantially.\nLegacy.\nThe National Banking Acts served to create the (federal-state) dual structure that is now a defining characteristic of the U.S. banking system and economy. The Comptroller of the Currency continues to have significance in the U.S. economy and is responsible for administration and supervision of national banks as well as certain activities of bank subsidiaries (per the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999). In 2004, the Act was used by John D. Hawke, Jr., Comptroller of the Currency, to effectively bar state attorneys general from national bank oversight and regulatory roles. Many blame the resulting lack of oversight and regulation for the late-2000s recession, the bailout of the U.S. financial system and the subprime mortgage crisis.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Co-produced by Paramount Pictures, Mandalay Pictures, Scott Rudin Productions, American Zoetrope, and Tim Burton Productions, it is based on Washington Irving's 1820 short story \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\", and stars Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci, with Miranda Richardson, Michael Gambon, Casper Van Dien, and Jeffrey Jones in supporting roles. The plot follows New York City police constable Ichabod Crane (Depp), who is sent to investigate a series of brutal murders in the upstate village of Sleepy Hollow, where he becomes romantically involved with Katrina Van Tassel (Ricci), the daughter of the richest resident of the town (Gambon).\n\"Sleepy Hollow\" began development in 1993 at Paramount Pictures, with Kevin Yagher originally set to direct Andrew Kevin Walker's script as a low-budget slasher film. Disagreements with Paramount resulted in Yagher being demoted to prosthetic makeup designer, and Burton was hired to direct in June 1998. Filming took place from November 1998 to May 1999. The film was an international co-production between Germany and the United States.\n\"Sleepy Hollow\" had its world premiere at Mann's Chinese Theatre on November 17, 1999, and was released in the United States on November 19, by Paramount Pictures. It received positive reviews from critics, and grossed $207\u00a0million. It won the Academy Award for Best Art Direction.\nPlot.\nIn the fall of 1799, pragmatic New York City constable Ichabod Crane is sent to the upstate Dutch village of Sleepy Hollow to investigate a series of brutal decapitations of its residents, which included landowner Peter Van Garrett, his son Dirk, and widow Emily Winship. Received by the insular town elders\u2014wealthy farmer Baltus Van Tassel; doctor Thomas Lancaster; the Reverend Steenwyck; notary James Hardenbrook; and magistrate Samuel Philipse\u2014Ichabod learns that the locals believe the killer is the undead apparition of a headless Hessian mercenary, who is trying to find his missing head.\nSkeptical of the paranormal explanation, Ichabod begins his investigation and settles in the house of Van Tassels, becoming romantically attached to Baltus' spiritual daughter, Katrina. After Van Garrett's servant, Jonathan Masbath, becomes the next victim, Ichabod takes his teenage son as an assistant. On a tip from Philipse, Ichabod and Young Masbath exhume the bodies of the victims and learn that the widow died pregnant. Shortly after, Ichabod witnesses the Hessian killing Philipse. Together with Masbath and Katrina, Ichabod goes to the Western Woods, where a crone reveals the location of the Hessian's grave at the \"tree of the dead\", his portal into the living world. Ichabod digs up the grave and discovers the Hessian's remains without a skull, deducing that it has been taken in order to control him.\nThat night, the Hessian kills town midwife Beth Killian and her family, as well as Katrina's suitor, Brom Van Brunt, when he attempts to intervene. Ichabod hypothesizes that the Hessian is attacking selected targets linked by a conspiracy. Ichabod and Masbath visit Hardenbrook, who unwittingly reveals that Van Garrett had secretly married Winship, bequeathing his estate to her and her unborn child. Ichabod deduces that all the victims are either beneficiaries or witnesses to the new will, and assumes that the Hessian's master is Baltus, Van Garret's next of kin who would otherwise have inherited the estate. Ichabod finds a chalked pentagram under his bed, which he believes symbolizes the evil eye.\nUpon learning of Ichabod's suspicions, Katrina destroys his evidence to protect her father. Hardenbrook commits suicide, and Steenwyck convenes a meeting to discredit Ichabod, but Baltus bursts into the church assembly, announcing that the Hessian has killed his wife and Katrina's stepmother, Mary Van Tassel. The remaining elders turn on each other, resulting in Steenwyck and Lancaster being killed. Unable to enter the church, the Hessian harpoons Baltus through a window, dragging him out and acquiring his head. In the ensuing chaos, Katrina draws a pentagram identical to the one Ichabod found earlier, making him believe that she is the Hessian's master.\nUsing Katrina's compendium of charms, Ichabod discovers that her pentagram is actually one of protection; he also finds a post-mortem wound on Mary's supposed body, which belongs to the Van Tassels' servant, Sarah. Mary confronts Katrina and takes her to a windmill, where she reveals her true parentage from an impoverished family evicted by Van Garrett years ago in favor of the Van Tassels. Having witnessed the Hessian's death as a child, Mary pledged herself to Satan to resurrect him from the grave and take over the Van Garrett and Van Tassel estates in revenge. She manipulated her way into the Van Tassel household, killing Katrina's mother to take her place as Baltus' wife, and drew the other elders into the conspiracy against him through blackmail and lust.\nHaving eliminated all the other heirs and witnesses, including her own sister (the crone) for aiding Ichabod, Mary summons the Hessian to finish off Katrina. Ichabod and Masbath rush to the windmill to rescue Katrina as the Hessian arrives. After escaping from the windmill, which led to its destruction, and the subsequent chase to the tree of the dead, Ichabod retrieves the Hessian's skull from Mary and returns it to him, freeing the Hessian from her control. With his head restored, the Hessian spares Katrina and returns to Hell, taking Mary with him. With the case solved, Ichabod takes Katrina and Masbath from Sleepy Hollow to start a new life with them in New York.\nCast.\nAdditionally, Claire Skinner plays Elizabeth \"Beth\" Killian, the town midwife. Alun Armstrong plays the High Constable. Mark Spalding plays Jonathan Masbath, Young Masbath's father and Van Garrets' servant who becomes one of the Hessian's victims. Jessica Oyelowo plays Sarah, the Van Tassels' servant. Tony Maudsley plays Van Ripper. Peter Guinness plays Lord Crane, Ichabod's grim and tyrannical parson father, who murdered his wife when their son was a child. Sean Stephens plays Thomas Killian. Other roles include Michael Feast as Spotty Man, Jamie Foreman as Thuggish Constable, Philip Martin Brown as a Constable, and an uncredited Martin Landau as Peter Van Garrett, Sleepy Hollow's chief citizen until his death at the hands of the Headless Horseman.\nProduction.\nDevelopment.\nIn 1993, Kevin Yagher, a special make-up effects designer who had turned to directing with \"Tales from the Crypt\", had the notion to adapt Washington Irving's short story \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" into a feature film. Through his agent, Yagher was introduced to Andrew Kevin Walker; they spent a few months working on a film treatment that transformed Ichabod Crane from a schoolmaster from Connecticut to a banished New York City detective. Yagher and Walker subsequently pitched \"Sleepy Hollow\" to various studios and production companies, eventually securing a deal with producer Scott Rudin, who had been impressed with Walker's unproduced spec script for \"Seven\". Rudin optioned the project to Paramount Pictures in a deal that had Yagher set to direct, with Walker scripting; the pair would share story credit. Following the completion of \"\", Yagher had planned \"Sleepy Hollow\" as \"a low-budget effects showcase with a spectacular murder every five minutes or so,\" characterized by its screenwriter as a \"pretentious slasher movie\". Paramount had reservations about the film, interpreting it as a typical period piece\u2014\"I wouldn't say they weren't enthusiastic about it, but they didn't see the commercial viability,\" producer Adam Schroeder noted. \"The studio thinks 'old literary classic' and they think \"The Crucible\". There was a fear about that... We started developing it before horror movies came back.\"\nParamount CEO Sherry Lansing revived studio interest in 1998. Schroeder, who shepherded Tim Burton's \"Edward Scissorhands\" as a studio executive at 20th Century Fox in 1990, suggested that Burton direct the film. Francis Ford Coppola's minimal production duties came from American Zoetrope; Burton only became aware of Coppola's involvement during the editing process when he was sent a copy of \"Sleepy Hollow\"'s trailer and saw Coppola's name on it. Burton, coming off the troubled production of \"Superman Lives\", was hired to direct in June 1998. Excited about Burton's involvement, Yagher stepped down as director \"with good grace\", remaining involved in the project as the lead creature effects artist. Burton considered the film his first venture into a primarily horror-focused tone. \"I had never really done something that was more of a horror film,\" he explained, \"and it's funny, because those are the kind of movies that I like probably more than any other genre.\" His interest in directing a horror film was influenced by his love for Hammer Film Productions and \"Black Sunday\"\u2014particularly the supernatural feel they evoked as a result of being filmed primarily on sound stages. As a result, \"Sleepy Hollow\" is an homage to various Hammer Film Productions, including \"Dr. Jekyll and Sister Hyde\", and other films such as \"Frankenstein\", \"Bride of Frankenstein\", various Roger Corman horror films, \"Jason and the Argonauts\", and \"Scream Blacula Scream\". The image of the Headless Horseman had fascinated Burton during his apprenticeship as a Disney animator at CalArts in the early 1980s. \"One of my teachers had worked on the Walt Disney version as one of the layout artists on the pursuit, and he brought in some layouts from it, so that was exciting. It was one of the things that maybe shaped what I like to do.\" Burton worked with Walker on rewrites, but Rudin suggested that Tom Stoppard rewrite the script to add to the comical aspects of Ichabod's bumbling mannerisms, and emphasize the character's romance with Katrina. His work went uncredited through the WGA screenwriting credit system.\nCasting.\nWhile Johnny Depp was Burton's first choice for the role of Ichabod Crane, Paramount required him to consider Brad Pitt, Liam Neeson and Daniel Day-Lewis. Depp was cast in July 1998 for his third collaboration with Burton after the title roles of \"Edward Scissorhands\" and \"Ed Wood\". Depp wanted Ichabod to parallel Irving's description of the character in the short story. This included a long prosthetic snipe nose, huge ears, and elongated fingers. Paramount turned down his suggestions, and after Depp read Tom Stoppard's rewrite of the script, he was inspired to take the character even further. \"I always thought of Ichabod as a very delicate, fragile person who was maybe a little too in touch with his feminine side, like a frightened little girl,\" Depp explained. He did not wish to portray the character as a typical action star would have, and instead took inspiration by Angela Lansbury's performance in \"Death on the Nile\". \"It's good,\" Burton reasoned, \"because I'm not the greatest action director, or the greatest director in any genre, and he's not the greatest action star, or the greatest star in any genre.\" Depp modeled Ichabod's detective personality from Basil Rathbone in the 1939 \"Sherlock Holmes\" film series. He also studied Roddy McDowall's acting for additional influence. Burton added that \"the idea was to try to find an elegance in action of the kind that Christopher Lee or Peter Cushing or Vincent Price had.\"\nBy late July 1998, Christina Ricci had been cast as Katrina Van Tassel in her first major adult role. \"Sleepy Hollow\" also reunited Burton with Jeffrey Jones (from \"Beetlejuice\" and \"Ed Wood\") as Reverend Steenwyck, Christopher Walken (Max Shreck in \"Batman Returns\") as the Hessian Horseman, Martin Landau (\"Ed Wood\") in a cameo role, and Hammer veteran Michael Gough (Alfred in Burton's \"Batman\" films), whom Burton tempted out of retirement. The Hammer influence was further confirmed by the casting of Christopher Lee in a small role as the Burgomaster who sends Crane to Sleepy Hollow.\nFilming.\nThe original intention had been to shoot \"Sleepy Hollow\" predominantly on location with a $30\u00a0million budget. Towns were scouted throughout Upstate New York along the Hudson Valley, and the filmmakers decided on Tarrytown for an October 1998 start date. The Historic Hudson Valley organization assisted in scouting locations, which included the Philipsburg Manor House and forests in the Rockefeller State Park Preserve. \"They had a wonderful quality to them,\" production designer Rick Heinrichs reflected on the locations, \"but it wasn't quite lending itself to the sort of expressionism that we were going for, which wanted to express the feeling of foreboding.\" Disappointed, the filmmakers scouted locations in Sturbridge, Massachusetts, and considered using Dutch colonial villages and period town recreations in the Northeastern United States. When no suitable existing location could be found, coupled with a lack of readily available studio space in the New York area needed to house the production's large number of sets, producer Scott Rudin suggested the United Kingdom.\nRudin believed Britain offered the level of craftsmanship in period detail, painting and costuming that was suitable for the film's design. Having directed \"Batman\" entirely in Britain, Burton agreed, and designers from \"Batman\"'s art department were employed by Paramount for \"Sleepy Hollow\". As a result, principal photography was pushed back to November 20, 1998, at Leavesden Film Studios, which had been recently vacated by \"\". The majority of filming took place at Leavesden, with other work taking place at Shepperton Studios, where the massive Tree of the Dead set was built using Stage H. Production then moved to the Culden Faw Estate, Hambleden for a month-long shoot in March, where the town of Sleepy Hollow was constructed. \"We came to England figuring we would find a perfect little town,\" producer Adam Schroeder recalled, \"and then we had to build it anyway.\" Filming in Britain continued through April, and a few last minute scenes were shot using a sound stage in Yonkers, New York the following May.\nDesign.\nResponsible for the film's production design was Rick Heinrichs, whom Burton intended to use on \"Superman Lives\". While the production crew was always going to build a substantial number of sets, the decision was made early on that optimally fulfilling Burton's vision would necessitate shooting \"Sleepy Hollow\" in a totally controlled environment at Leavesden Film Studios. The production design was influenced by Burton's love for Hammer Film Productions and the film \"Black Sunday\" (1960)\u2014particularly the supernatural feel they evoked as a result of being filmed primarily on sound stages. Heinrichs was also influenced by American colonial architecture, German expressionist cinema, Dr. Seuss illustrations, and Hammer's \"Dracula Has Risen from the Grave\".\nOne sound stage at Leavesden was dedicated to the \"Forest to Field\" set, for the scene in which the Headless Horseman races out of the woods and into a field. This stage was then transformed into, variously, a graveyard, a corn field, a field of harvested wheat, a churchyard, and a snowy battlefield. In addition, a small backlot area was devoted to a New York City street and waterfront tank.\nCinematography.\nBurton was impressed by the cinematography in \"Great Expectations\" (1998) and hired Emmanuel Lubezki as \"Sleepy Hollow\"'s director of photography. Initially, Lubezki and Burton contemplated shooting the film in black and white, and in old square Academy ratio. When that proved unfeasible, they opted to apply bleach bypass to desaturate the image and increase the color black. Burton and Lubezki intentionally planned the over-dependency of smoke and soft lighting to accompany the film's sole wide-angle lens strategy. Lubezki also used Hammer horror and Mexican Luchador films from the 1960s, such as \"Santo Contra los Zombies\" and \"Santo vs. las Mujeres Vampiro\". Lighting effects increased the dynamic energy of the Headless Horseman, while the contrast of the film stock was increased in post-production to add to the monochromatic feel.\nLeavesden Studios, a converted airplane factory, presented problems because of its relatively low ceilings. This was less of an issue for \"The Phantom Menace\", in which set height was generally achieved by digital means. \"Our visual choices get channeled and violent,\" Heinrichs elaborated, \"so you end up with liabilities that you tend to exploit as virtues. When you've got a certain ceiling height, and you're dealing with painted backings, you need to push atmosphere and diffusion.\" This was particularly the case in several exteriors that were built on sound stages. \"We would mitigate the disadvantages by hiding lights with teasers and smoke.\"\nVisual effects.\nThe majority of \"Sleepy Hollow\"'s 150 visual effects shots were handled by Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM), while Kevin Yagher supervised the human and creature effects. Framestore also assisted on visual effects, and The Mill handled motion control photography. In part a reaction to the computer-generated effects in \"Mars Attacks!\", Burton opted to use as limited an amount of digital effects as possible. Ray Park, who served as the Headless Horseman stunt double, wore a blue ski mask for the chroma key effect, digitally removed by ILM. Burton and Heinrichs applied to \"Sleepy Hollow\" many of the techniques they had used in stop-motion animation on \"Vincent\"\u2014such as forced perspective sets.\nThe windmill was a 60-foot-tall forced-perspective exterior (visible to highway travellers miles away), a base and rooftop set and a quarter-scale miniature. The interior of the mill, which was about 30 feet high and 25 feet wide, featured wooden gears equipped with mechanisms for grinding flour. A wider view of the windmill was rendered on a Leavesden soundstage set with a quarter-scale windmill, complete with rotating vanes, painted sky backdrop and special-effects fire. \"It was scary for the actors who were having burning wood explode at them,\" Heinrichs recalled. \"There were controls in place and people standing by with hoses, of course, but there's always a chance of something going wrong.\" For the final shot of the burning mill exploding, the quarter-scale windmill and painted backdrop were erected against the outside wall of the \"flight shed\", a spacious hangar on the far side of Leavesden Studios. The hangar's interior walls were knocked down to create a 450-foot run, with a 40-foot width still allowing for coach and cameras. Heinrichs tailored the sets so cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki could shoot from above without seeing the end of the stage.\nActor Ian McDiarmid, who portrayed Dr. Lancaster, had just finished another Leavesden production with \"\". He compared the aesthetics of the two films, stating that physical sets helped the actors get into a natural frame of mind. \"Having come from the blue-screen world of \"Star Wars\" it was wonderful to see gigantic, beautifully made perspective sets and wonderful clothes, and also people recreating a world. It's like the way movies used to be done\"\nMusical score.\nThe film score was composed by Danny Elfman. It won the Golden Satellite Award and was also nominated by the Las Vegas Film Critics.\nRelease.\nDistribution.\nIt is the first Mandalay Pictures film to be distributed by Paramount Pictures after they ended their collaboration with Sony Pictures Entertainment, they released the film in most territories through their joint venture company United International Pictures outside the United States. Path\u00e9 released the film in the United Kingdom, Ireland and France, Roadshow Films released the film in Australia and New Zealand, Village Films released the film in Greece and TriPictures released the film in Spain.\nMarketing.\nTo promote \"Sleepy Hollow\", Paramount Pictures featured the film's trailer at San Diego Comic-Con in August 1999. The following October, the studio launched a website, which \"Variety\" described as being the \"most ambitious online launch of a motion picture to date.\" The site offered visitors live video chats with several of the filmmakers hosted by Yahoo! Movies and enabled them to view photos from sets and behind-the-scenes footage. In the weeks before the movie's release, a toy line was marketed by McFarlane Toys. Simon &amp; Schuster also published \"The Art of Sleepy Hollow\" (), which included the film's screenplay and an introduction by Tim Burton. A novelization, also published by Simon &amp; Schuster, was written by Peter Lerangis.\nBox office.\n\"Sleepy Hollow\" was released in the United States on November 19, 1999, in 3,069 theaters, grossing $30,060,467 in its opening weekend at the No. 2 spot behind \"The World Is Not Enough\". It would drop into fourth place behind the latter film, \"Toy Story 2\" and \"End of Days\" the following weekend. \"Sleepy Hollow\" eventually earned $101,068,340 in domestic gross, and $105\u00a0million in foreign sales, coming to a worldwide total of $206,068,340.\nHome media.\nParamount Home Video first released \"Sleepy Hollow\" on DVD and VHS in the United States on May 23, 2000. The HD DVD release came in July 2006, while the film was released on Blu-ray two years later, in June 2008.\nAn unofficial video game adaptation of the film titled \"Cursed Fates: The Headless Horseman\" was released by Fenomen Games and Big Fish Games on January 6, 2013. For the 20th anniversary, Paramount Home Entertainment released a Blu-ray digibook with a photobook containing the original story on September 24, 2019. For the upcoming 25th anniversary of the film, Paramount Pictures released a remastered 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray version on September 5, 2023.\nReception.\nCritical response.\n\"Sleepy Hollow\" received positive reviews from critics, who praised its direction, screenplay, visual effects, musical score, and the performances of the cast. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that the film had approval rating based on reviews, with an average rating of . According to its consensus, \"It isn't Tim Burton's best work, but \"Sleepy Hollow\" entertains with its stunning visuals and creepy atmosphere.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 65 out of 100 from 35 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a \"B\u2212\" grade on a scale of A+ to F.\nRoger Ebert gave it 3.5 stars out of 4 and said: \"This is the best-looking horror film since Coppola's \"Bram Stoker's Dracula\"\". He praised Johnny Depp's performance and Tim Burton's methods of visual design. \"Johnny Depp is an actor able to disappear into characters,\" Ebert continued, \"never more readily than in one of Burton's films.\" Richard Corliss wrote, in his review for \"Time\", \"Burton's richest, prettiest, weirdest [film] since \"Batman Returns\". The simple story bends to his twists, freeing him for an exercise in high style.\" David Sterritt of \"The Christian Science Monitor\" gave praise to filmmaking and the high-spirited acting of cast, but believed Andrew Kevin Walker's writing was too repetitious and formulaic for the third act.\nOwen Gleiberman from \"Entertainment Weekly\" wrote \"Sleepy Hollow\" is \"a choppily plotted crowd-pleaser that lacks the seductive, freakazoid alchemy of Burton's best work.\" Gleiberman compared the film to \"The Mummy\", and said \"it feels like every high-powered action climax of the last 10 years. Personally, I'd rather see Burton so intoxicated by a movie that he lost his head.\" Andrew Johnston of \"Time Out New York\" wrote \"[l]ike the best of Burton's films, \"Sleepy Hollow\" takes place in a world so richly imagined that, despite its abundant terrors, you can't help wanting to step through the screen.\" Mick LaSalle, writing in the \"San Francisco Chronicle\", criticized Burton's perceived image as a creative artist. \"All \"Sleepy Hollow\" has going for it is art direction, and even in that it falls back on clich\u00e9.\"\nJonathan Rosenbaum from the \"Chicago Reader\" called \"Sleepy Hollow\" \"a ravishing visual experience, a pretty good vehicle for some talented American and English actors,\" but concluded that the film was a missed opportunity to depict an actual representation of the short story. \"Burton's fidelity is exclusively to the period feeling he gets from disreputable Hammer horror films and a few images culled from \"Ichabod and Mr. Toad\". When it comes to one of America's great stories, Burton obviously couldn't care less.\"\nSequel.\nOn July 23, 2025, it was announced IDW Dark will be publishing sequel in comic book form called \"Return to Sleepy Hollow\". The first issue will be released October 29, 2025.\nReboot.\nOn June 10, 2022, Paramount announced plans for a reboot of \"Sleepy Hollow\" with Lindsey Beer in talks to write and direct it.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is widely grown in the tropics and subtropics by small and large commercial producers, both as a grain legume and as an oil crop. Geocarpy is atypical among legumes, which led botanist Carl Linnaeus to name the species \"hypogaea\", from Greek 'under the earth'.\nThe peanut belongs to the botanical family Fabaceae (or Leguminosae), commonly known as the legume, bean, or pea family. Like most other legumes, peanuts harbor symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria in root nodules, which improve soil fertility, making them valuable in crop rotations.\nDespite not meeting the botanical definition of a nut as \"a\u00a0fruit whose ovary wall becomes hard at maturity\", peanuts are usually categorized as nuts for culinary purposes and in common English. Some people are allergic to peanuts and can have a potentially fatal reaction; this is distinct from tree nut allergies.\nPeanuts are similar in taste and nutritional profile to tree nuts such as walnuts and almonds, and, as a culinary nut, are often served in similar ways in Western cuisines.\nBotanical description.\nThe peanut is an annual herbaceous plant growing tall. As a legume, it belongs to the botanical family Fabaceae, also known as Leguminosae, and commonly known as the legume, bean, or pea family. Like most other legumes, peanuts harbor symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria in their root nodules.\nThe leaves are opposite and pinnate with four leaflets (two opposite pairs; no terminal leaflet); each leaflet is long and across. Like those of many other legumes, the leaves are nyctinastic; that is, they have \"sleep\" movements, closing at night.\nThe flowers are across, and yellowish orange with reddish veining. They are borne in axillary clusters on the stems above ground and last for just one day. The ovary is located at the base of what appears to be the flower stem but is a highly elongated floral cup.\nPeanut fruits develop underground, an unusual feature known as geocarpy. After fertilization, a short stalk at the base of the ovary\u2014often termed a gynophore, but which appears to be part of the ovary\u2014elongates to form a thread-like structure known as a \"peg\". This peg grows into the soil, allowing the fruit to develop underground. These pods, technically called legumes, are long, normally containing one to four seeds. The shell of the peanut fruit consists primarily of a mesocarp with several large veins traversing its length.\nParts of the peanut include:\nPhytochemistry.\nPeanuts contain polyphenols, polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats, phytosterols, and dietary fiber in amounts similar to several tree nuts. Peanut skins contain resveratrol.\nHistory.\nThe \"Arachis\" genus is native to South America, east of the Andes, around Peru, Bolivia, Argentina, and Brazil. Cultivated peanuts (\"A. hypogaea\") arose from a hybrid between two wild species of peanut, thought to be \"A. duranensis\" and \"A. ipaensis\". The initial hybrid would have been sterile, but spontaneous chromosome doubling restored its fertility, forming what is termed an amphidiploid or allotetraploid. Genetic analysis suggests the hybridization may have occurred only once and gave rise to \"A. monticola\", a wild form of peanut that occurs in a few limited locations in northwestern Argentina, or in southeastern Bolivia, where the peanut landraces with the most wild-like features are grown today, and by artificial selection to \"A. hypogaea\".\nThe process of domestication through artificial selection made \"A. hypogaea\" dramatically different from its wild relatives. The domesticated plants are bushier, more compact, and have a different pod structure and larger seeds. From this center of origin, cultivation spread and formed secondary and tertiary centers of diversity in Peru, Ecuador, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Over time, thousands of peanut landraces evolved; these are classified into six botanical varieties and two subspecies (as listed in the peanut scientific classification table). Subspecies \"A. h. fastigiata\" types are more upright in their growth habit and have shorter crop cycles. Subspecies \"A. h. hypogaea\" types spread more on the ground and have longer crop cycles.\nThe oldest known archeological remains of pods have been dated at about 7,600 years old, possibly a wild species that was in cultivation, or \"A. hypogaea\" in the early phase of domestication. They were found in Peru, where dry climatic conditions are favorable for the preservation of organic material. Almost certainly, peanut cultivation predated this at the center of origin where the climate is moister. Many pre-Columbian cultures, such as the Moche, depicted peanuts in their art. Cultivation was well-established in Mesoamerica before the Spanish arrived. There, the conquistadors found the (the plant's Nahuatl name, hence the name in Spanish \"cacahuate\") offered for sale in the marketplace of Tenochtitlan. Its cultivation was introduced in Europe in the 19th century through Spain, particularly Valencia, where it is still produced, albeit marginally. European traders later spread the peanut worldwide, and cultivation is now widespread in tropical and subtropical regions. In West Africa, it substantially replaced a crop plant from the same family, the Bambara groundnut, whose seed pods also develop underground. In China and India, it became an agricultural mainstay, and these countries are the largest producers in the world (\"Production\" section).\nPeanuts were introduced to the US during the colonial period and grown as a garden crop. Starting in 1870, they were used as an animal feedstock until human consumption grew in the 1930s. George Washington Carver (1864\u20131943) championed the peanut as part of his efforts for agricultural extension in the American South, where soils were depleted after repeated plantings of cotton. He invented and promulgated hundreds of peanut-based products, including cosmetics, paints, plastics, gasoline and nitroglycerin.\nPeanut butter was first manufactured in Canada by a process patented in the US in 1884 by Marcellus Gilmore Edson of Montreal. Peanut butter became well known in the United States after the Beech-Nut company began selling it at the St. Louis World's Fair in 1904. The US Department of Agriculture initiated a program to encourage agricultural production and human consumption of peanuts in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\nVarieties.\nCultivars in the United States.\nThere are many peanut cultivars grown around the world. The market classes grown in the United States are Spanish, Runner, Virginia, and Valencia. Peanuts are produced in three major areas of the US: the southeastern US region which includes Alabama, Georgia, and Florida; the southwestern US region which includes New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas; and in the general eastern US which includes Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. In Georgia, Naomi Chapman Woodroof is responsible for developing the breeding program of peanuts, resulting in a harvest almost five times greater.\nCertain cultivar groups are preferred for particular characteristics, such as differences in flavor, oil content, size, shape, and disease resistance. Most peanuts marketed in the shell are of the Virginia type, along with some Valencias selected for large size and the attractive appearance of the shell. Spanish peanuts are used mostly for peanut candy, salted nuts, and peanut butter.\nSpanish group.\nThe small Spanish types are grown in South Africa and the southwestern and southeastern United States. Until 1940, 90% of the peanuts grown in the US state of Georgia were Spanish types, but the trend since then has been larger-seeded, higher-yielding, more disease-resistant cultivars. Spanish peanuts have a higher oil content than other types of peanuts. In the US, the Spanish group is primarily grown in New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas.\nCultivars of the Spanish group include 'Dixie Spanish', 'Improved Spanish 2B', 'GFA Spanish', 'Argentine', 'Spantex', 'Spanette', 'Shaffers Spanish', 'Natal Common (Spanish)', \"White Kernel Varieties', 'Starr', 'Comet', 'Florispan', 'Spanhoma', 'Spancross', 'OLin', 'Tamspan 90', 'AT 9899\u201314', 'Spanco', 'Wilco I', 'GG 2', 'GG 4', 'TMV 2', and 'Tamnut 06'.\nRunner group.\nSince 1940, the southeastern US region has seen a shift to producing Runner group peanuts. This shift is due to good flavor, better roasting characteristics, and higher yields than Spanish types, leading to food manufacturers' preference for the use in peanut butter and salted nuts. Georgia's production is now almost 100% Runner-type.\nCultivars of Runners include 'Southeastern Runner 56-15', 'Dixie Runner', 'Early Runner', 'Virginia Bunch 67', 'Bradford Runner', 'Egyptian Giant' (also known as 'Virginia Bunch' and 'Giant'), 'Rhodesian Spanish Bunch' (Valencia and Virginia Bunch), 'North Carolina Runner 56-15', 'Florunner', 'Virugard', 'Georgia Green', 'Tamrun 96', 'Flavor Runner 458', 'Tamrun OL01', 'Tamrun OL02' 'AT-120', 'Andru-93', 'Southern Runner', 'AT1-1', 'Georgia Brown', 'GK-7', and 'AT-108'.\nVirginia group.\nThe large-seeded Virginia group peanuts are grown in the US states of Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and parts of Georgia. They are increasing in popularity due to the demand for large peanuts for processing, particularly for salting, confections, and roasting in shells.\nVirginia group peanuts are either bunch or running in growth habit. The bunch type is upright to spreading. It attains a height of , and a spread of , with rows that seldom cover the ground. The pods are borne within of the base of the plant.\nCultivars of Virginia-type peanuts include 'NC 7', 'NC 9', 'NC 10C', 'NC-V 11', 'VA 93B', 'NC 12C', 'VA-C 92R', 'Gregory', 'VA 98R', 'Perry', 'Wilson, 'Hull', 'AT VC-2' and 'Shulamit'.\nValencia group.\nValencia group peanuts are coarse and have heavy reddish stems and large foliage. In the United States, large-scale commercial production is mainly in the South Plains of West Texas and in eastern New Mexico near and south of Portales, but they are grown on a small scale elsewhere in the South as the best-flavored and preferred type for boiled peanuts. They are comparatively tall, reaching a height of and a spread of . Peanut pods are borne on pegs arising from the main stem and the side branches. Most pods are clustered around the base of the plant, and only a few are found several inches away. Valencia types are three- to five-seeded and smooth, with no constriction of the shell between the seeds. Seeds are oval and tightly crowded into the pods. Typical seed weight is 0.4 to 0.5\u00a0g. This type is used heavily for selling roasted and salted in-shell peanuts and peanut butter. Varieties include 'Valencia A' and 'Valencia C'.\nTennessee Red and Tennessee White groups.\nThese are alike except for the color of the seed. Sometimes known also as Texas Red or White, the plants are similar to Valencia types, except the stems are green to greenish brown, and the pods are rough, irregular, and have a smaller proportion of kernels.\nCultivation.\nPeanuts grow best in light, sandy loam soil with a pH of 5.9\u20137. Their capacity to fix nitrogen means that providing they nodulate properly, peanuts benefit little or not at all from nitrogen-containing fertilizer, and they improve soil fertility. Therefore, they are valuable in crop rotations. Also, the yield of the peanut crop itself is increased in rotations through reduced diseases, pests, and weeds. For example, in Texas, peanuts in a three-year rotation with corn yield 50% more than nonrotated peanuts. Adequate levels of phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and micronutrients are also necessary for good yields. Peanuts need warm weather throughout the growing season to develop well. They can be grown with as little as of water, but for best yields need at least . Depending on growing conditions and the cultivar of peanut, harvest is usually 90 to 130 \u00a0days after planting for subspecies \"A. h. fastigiata\" types, and 120 to 150 days after planting for subspecies \"A. h. hypogaea\" types. Subspecies \"A. h. hypogaea\" types yield more and are usually preferred where the growing seasons are sufficiently long.\nPeanut plants continue to produce flowers when pods are developing; therefore, some pods are immature even when they are ready for harvest. To maximize yield, the timing of harvest is important. If it is too early, too many pods will be unripe; if too late, the pods will snap off at the stalk and remain in the soil. For harvesting, the entire plant, including most of the roots, is removed from the soil. The pods are covered with a network of raised veins and are constricted between seeds.\nThe main yield-limiting factors in semi-arid regions are drought and high-temperature stress. The stages of reproductive development before flowering, at flowering, and at early pod development are particularly sensitive to these constraints. Apart from nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, other nutrient deficiencies causing significant yield losses are calcium, iron and boron. Biotic stresses mainly include pests, diseases, and weeds. Among insects pests, pod borers, aphids, and mites are of importance. The most important diseases are leaf spots, rusts, and the toxin-producing fungus Aspergillus.\nHarvesting occurs in two stages. In mechanized systems, a machine is used to cut off the main root of the peanut plant by cutting through the soil just below the level of the peanut pods. The machine lifts the \"bush\" from the ground, shakes it, then inverts it, leaving the plant upside down to keep the peanuts out of the soil. This allows the peanuts to dry slowly to a little less than a third of their original moisture level over three to four days. Traditionally, peanuts were pulled and inverted by hand.\nAfter the peanuts have dried sufficiently, they are threshed, removing the peanut pods from the rest of the bush. Peanuts must be dried properly and stored in dry conditions. If they are too high in moisture, or if storage conditions are poor, they may become infected by the mold fungus \"Aspergillus flavus\". Many strains of this fungus release toxic and highly carcinogenic substances called aflatoxins.\nPests and diseases.\nIf peanut plants are subjected to severe drought during pod formation, or if pods are not properly stored, they may become contaminated with the mold \"Aspergillus flavus\" which may produce carcinogenic substances called aflatoxins. Lower-quality peanuts, particularly where mold is evident, are more likely to be contaminated. The USDA tests every truckload of raw peanuts for aflatoxin; any containing aflatoxin levels of more than 15 parts per billion are destroyed. The peanut industry has manufacturing steps to ensure all peanuts are inspected for aflatoxin. Peanuts tested to have high aflatoxin are used to make peanut oil where the mold can be removed.\nThe plant leaves can also be affected by a fungus, \"Alternaria arachidis\".\nProduction.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Table alignment/tables.css\" /&gt;\nIn 2023, world production of peanuts (reported as groundnuts excluding shelled) was 54 million tonnes, led by China with 36% of the total and India with 19% (table).\nToxicity.\nAllergies.\nSome people (1.4\u20132% in Europe and the United States) report that they experience allergic reactions to peanut exposure; symptoms can be especially severe, ranging from watery eyes to anaphylactic shock, the latter of which is generally fatal if untreated. Eating a small amount of peanuts can cause a reaction. Because of their widespread use in prepared and packaged foods, avoiding peanuts can be difficult. Reading ingredients and warnings on product packaging is necessary to avoid this allergen. Foods processed in facilities that also handle peanuts on the same equipment as other foods are required to carry such warnings on their labels. Avoiding cross-contamination with peanuts and peanut products (along with other severe allergens like shellfish) is a promoted and common practice of which chefs and restaurants worldwide are becoming aware.\nThe hygiene hypothesis of allergy states that a lack of early childhood exposure to infectious agents like germs and parasites could be causing the increase in food allergies.\nStudies comparing age of peanut introduction in Great Britain with introduction in Israel showed that delaying exposure to peanuts in childhood can dramatically increase the risk of developing peanut allergies.\nPeanut allergy has been associated with the use of skin preparations containing peanut oil among children, but the evidence is not regarded as conclusive. Peanut allergies have also been associated with family history and intake of soy products.\nSome school districts in the US and elsewhere have banned peanuts or products containing peanuts. However, the efficacy of the bans in reducing allergic reactions is uncertain. A 2015 study in Canada found no difference in the percentage of accidental exposures occurring in schools prohibiting peanuts compared to schools allowing them.\nRefined peanut oil will not cause allergic reactions in most people with peanut allergies. However, crude (unrefined) peanut oils have been shown to contain protein, which may cause allergic reactions. In a randomized, double-blind crossover study, 60 people with proven peanut allergy were challenged with both crude peanut oil and refined peanut oil. The authors concluded, \"Crude peanut oil caused allergic reactions in 10% of allergic subjects studied and should continue to be avoided.\" They also stated, \"Refined peanut oil does not seem to pose a risk to most people with peanut allergy.\" However, they point out that refined peanut oil can still pose a risk to peanut-allergic individuals if the oil that has previously been used for cooking foods containing peanuts is reused.\nUses.\nNutrition.\nRaw Valencia peanuts are 4% water, 48% fat, 25% protein, and 21% carbohydrates (table).\nIn a reference amount of , peanuts provide of food energy, supply of dietary fiber, and are a rich source (defined as more than 20% of the Daily Value, DV) of several B vitamins, vitamin E, and various dietary minerals, such as manganese, magnesium, and phosphorus. The fats are mainly polyunsaturated and monounsaturated (83% of total fats when combined; table source).\nSome studies show that regular consumption of peanuts is associated with a lower specific risk of mortality from certain diseases. However, the study designs do not allow cause and effect to be inferred. According to the US Food and Drug Administration, \"Scientific evidence suggests but does not prove that eating 1.5 ounces per day of most nuts (such as peanuts) as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol may reduce the risk of heart disease.\"\nCulinary.\nWhole peanuts.\nDry-roasting peanuts is a common form of preparation. Dry peanuts can be roasted in the shell or shelled in a home oven if spread out one layer deep in a pan and baked at a temperature of for 15 to 20 min (shelled) and 20 to 25 min (in shell).\nBoiled peanuts are a popular snack in India, China, West Africa, and the southern United States. In the US South, boiled peanuts are often prepared in briny water and sold in streetside stands.\nA distinction can be drawn between raw and green peanuts. A green peanut is a term to describe farm-fresh harvested peanuts that have not been dehydrated. They are available from grocery stores, food distributors, and farmers markets during the growing season. Raw peanuts are also uncooked but have been dried/dehydrated and must be rehydrated before boiling (usually in a bowl full of water overnight). Once rehydrated, the raw peanuts are ready to be boiled.\nPeanut oil.\nPeanut oil is often used in cooking because it has a mild flavor and a relatively high smoke point. Due to its high monounsaturated content, it is considered more healthful than saturated oils and is resistant to rancidity. The several types of peanut oil include aromatic roasted peanut oil, refined peanut oil, extra virgin or cold-pressed peanut oil, and peanut extract. Refined peanut oil is exempt from allergen labeling laws in the US.\nA common cooking and salad oil, peanut oil is 46% monounsaturated fats (primarily oleic acid), 32% polyunsaturated fats (primarily linoleic acid), and 17% saturated fats (primarily palmitic acid) (source in nutrition table). Extractable from whole peanuts using a simple water and centrifugation method, the oil is being considered by NASA's Advanced Life Support program for future long-duration human space missions.\nPeanut butter.\nPeanut butter is a food paste or spread made from ground dry roasted peanuts. It often contains additional ingredients that modify the taste or texture, such as salt, sweeteners, or emulsifiers. Many companies have added twists on traditionally plain peanut butter by adding various flavor varieties, such as chocolate, birthday cake, and cinnamon raisin. Peanut butter is served as a spread on bread, toast or crackers, and used to make sandwiches (notably the peanut butter and jelly sandwich). It is also used in a number of confections, such as peanut-flavored granola bars or croissants and other pastries. The United States is a leading exporter of peanut butter, and itself consumes $800 million of peanut butter annually.\nPeanut flour.\nPeanut flour is used in gluten-free cooking.\nPeanut proteins.\nPeanut protein concentrates and isolates are commercially produced from defatted peanut flour using several methods. Peanut flour concentrates (about 70% protein) are produced from dehulled kernels by removing most of the oil and the water-soluble, non-protein components. Hydraulic pressing, screw pressing, solvent extraction, and pre-pressing followed by solvent extraction may be used for oil removal, after which protein isolation and purification are implemented.\nLatin America.\nPeanuts are particularly common in Peruvian and Mexican cuisine, both of which marry indigenous and European ingredients. For instance, in Peru, a popular traditional dish is \"picante de cuy\", a roasted guinea pig served in a sauce of ground peanuts (ingredients native to South America) with roasted onions and garlic (ingredients from European cuisine). Also, in the Peruvian city of Arequipa, a dish called \"ocopa\" consists of a smooth sauce of roasted peanuts and hot peppers (both native to the region) with roasted onions, garlic, and oil, poured over meat or potatoes. Another example is a fricassee combining a similar mixture with saut\u00e9ed seafood or boiled and shredded chicken. These dishes are generally known as \"aj\u00edes\", meaning \"hot peppers\", such as \"aj\u00ed de pollo\" and \"aj\u00ed de mariscos\" (seafood \"aj\u00edes\" may omit peanuts). In Mexico, it is also used to prepare different traditional dishes, such as chicken in peanut sauce (\"encacahuatado\"), and is used as the main ingredient for the preparation of other famous dishes such as red pipi\u00e1n, mole poblano and oaxacan mole negro.\nLikewise, during colonial times in Peru, the Spanish used peanuts to replace nuts unavailable locally but used extensively in Spanish cuisine, such as almonds and pine nuts, typically ground or as a paste mixed with rice, meats, and vegetables for dishes like rice pilaf.\nThroughout the region, many candies and snacks are made using peanuts. In Mexico, it is common to find them in different presentations as a snack or candy: salty, \"Japanese\" peanuts, praline, \"enchilados\" or in the form of a traditional sweet made with peanuts and honey called \"palanqueta\", and even as peanut marzipan. There is a similar form of peanut candy in Brazil, called p\u00e9-de-moleque, made with peanuts and molasses, which resembles the Indian chikki in form.\nWest Asia.\nCrunchy coated peanuts, called \"kabukim\" in Hebrew, are a popular snack in Israel. \"Kabukim\" are commonly sold by weight at corner stores where fresh nuts and seeds are sold, though they are also available packaged. The coating typically consists of flour, salt, starch, lecithin, and sometimes sesame seeds. The origin of the name is obscure (it may be derived from \"kabuk\", which means nutshell or husk in Turkish). An additional variety of crunchy coated peanuts popular in Israel is \"American peanuts\". The coating of this variety is thinner but harder to crack.\nBamba puffs are a popular snack in Israel. Their shape is similar to Cheez Doodles, but they are made of peanuts and corn.\nSoutheast Asia.\nPeanuts are also widely used in Southeast Asian cuisine, such as in Malaysia, Vietnam, and Indonesia, where they are typically made into a spicy sauce. Peanuts came to Indonesia from the Philippines, where the legume was derived from Mexico during Spanish colonization. One Philippine dish using peanuts is \"kare-kare\", a mixture of meat and peanut butter. Apart from being used in dishes, fried shelled peanuts are a common inexpensive snack in the Philippines. The peanuts are commonly served plain salted with garlic chips and variants, including adobo and chili flavors.\nCommon Indonesian peanut-based dishes include \"gado-gado\", \"pecel\", \"karedok\", and \"ketoprak\", vegetable salads mixed with peanut sauce, and the peanut-based sauce, \"satay\".\nIndian subcontinent.\nIn the Indian subcontinent, peanuts are a light snack, usually roasted and salted (sometimes with the addition of chilli powder), and often sold roasted in pods or boiled with salt. They are also made into dessert or sweet snack of peanut brittle by processing with refined sugar and jaggery. Indian cuisine uses roasted, crushed peanuts to give a crunchy body to salads; they are added whole (without pods) to leafy vegetable stews for the same reason. Another use is peanut oil for cooking. Most Indians use mustard, sunflower, and peanut oil for cooking. In South India, groundnut chutney is eaten with dosa and idli as breakfast. Peanuts are also used in sweets and savory items in South India and also as a flavor in tamarind rice. Kovilpatti is known for its sweet peanut chikki or peanut brittle, which is also used in savory and sweet mixtures, such as Bombay mix.\nWest Africa.\nPeanuts grow well in southern Mali and adjacent regions of the Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Nigeria, and Senegal; peanuts are similar in both agricultural and culinary qualities to the Bambara groundnut native to the region, and West Africans have adopted the crop as a staple. Peanut sauce, prepared with onions, garlic, peanut butter/paste, and vegetables such as carrots, cabbage, and cauliflower, can be vegetarian (the peanuts supplying ample protein) or prepared with meat, usually chicken.\nPeanuts are used in the Malian meat stew \"maafe\". In Ghana, peanut butter is used for peanut butter soup \"nkate nkwan\". Crushed peanuts may also be used for peanut candies \"nkate cake\" and \"kuli-kuli\", as well as other local foods such as \"oto\". Peanut butter is an ingredient in Nigeria's \"African salad\". Peanut powder is an important ingredient in the spicy coating for kebabs (Suya) in Nigeria and Ghana.\nEast Africa.\nPeanuts are a common ingredient of several types of relishes (dishes which accompany \"nshima\") eaten in Malawi, and in the eastern part of Zambia, and these dishes are common throughout both countries. Thick peanut butter sauces are also made in Uganda to serve with rice and other starchy foods. Groundnut stew, called \"ebinyebwa\" in Luganda-speaking areas of Uganda, is made by boiling ground peanut flour with other ingredients, such as cabbage, mushrooms, dried fish, meat or other vegetables. Across East Africa, roasted peanuts, often in cones of newspaper, are obtained from street vendors.\nNorth America.\nThe state of Georgia leads the US in peanut production, with 49 percent of the nation's peanut acreage and output. In 2014, farmers cultivated 591,000 acres of peanuts, yielding of 2.4 billion pounds. The most famous peanut farmer was Jimmy Carter of Sumter County, Georgia, who became US president in 1976.\nIn the US and Canada, peanuts are used in candies, cakes, cookies, and other sweets. Individually, they are eaten dry-roasted with or without salt. Ninety-five percent of Canadians eat peanuts or peanut butter, with the average consumption of of peanuts per person annually, and 79% of Canadians consume peanut butter weekly. In the United States, peanuts and peanut butter are central to American dietary practices, and are typically considered as comfort foods. Peanuts were sold at fairs or by pushcart operators through the 19th century. Peanut butter is a common peanut-based food, representing half of the American total peanut consumption and $850 million in annual retail sales. Peanut soup is found on restaurant menus in the southeastern states. In some southern portions of the US, peanuts are boiled for several hours until soft and moist. Peanuts are also deep-fried, sometimes within the shell. Per person, Americans eat of peanut products annually, spending a total of $2 billion in peanut retail purchases.\nManufacturing.\nIndustrial.\nPeanuts have a variety of industrial end uses. Paint, varnish, lubricating oil, leather dressings, furniture polish, insecticides, and nitroglycerin are made from peanut oil. Soap is made from saponified oil, and many cosmetics contain peanut oil and its derivatives. The protein portion is used in the manufacture of some textile fibers. Peanut shells are used in the manufacture of plastic, wallboard, abrasives, fuel, cellulose (used in rayon and paper), and mucilage (glue).\nMalnutrition.\nWith their high protein concentration, peanuts are used to help reduce or prevent malnutrition. Plumpy Nut, MANA Nutrition, and Medika Mamba are high-protein, high-energy, and high-nutrient peanut-based pastes developed to be used as a therapeutic food to aid in famine relief. The World Health Organization, UNICEF, Project Peanut Butter, and Doctors Without Borders have used these products to help save malnourished children in developing countries.\nPeanuts can be used like other legumes and grains to make a lactose-free, milk-like beverage, peanut milk, which is promoted in Africa as a way to reduce malnutrition among children.\nAnimal feed.\nPeanut plant tops and crop residues can be used for silage.\nThe protein cake (oilcake meal) residue from oil processing is used as animal feed and soil fertilizer. Groundnut cake is a livestock feed, mostly used by cattle as protein supplements. It is one of the most important and valuable feeds for all types of livestock and one of the most active ingredients for poultry rations. Poor storage of the cake may sometimes result in its contamination by aflatoxin, a naturally occurring mycotoxin that is produced by \"Aspergillus flavus\" and \"Aspergillus parasiticus\". The major constituents of the cake are essential amino acids such as lysine and glutamine. Other components are crude fiber, crude protein, and fat.\nSome peanuts can also be fed whole to livestock, for example, those over the peanut quota in the US or those with a higher aflatoxin content than that permitted by the food regulations.\nPeanut processing often requires dehulling: the hulls generated in large amounts by the peanut industries can feed livestock, particularly ruminants.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "55606", "revid": "7471214", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55606", "title": "Haifa", "text": "City in Northern Israel\nHaifa ( ; , ; ) is the third-largest city in Israel\u2014after Jerusalem and Tel Aviv\u2014with a population of 298,312 in 2023. The city of Haifa forms part of the Haifa metropolitan area, the third-most populous metropolitan area in Israel. It is home to the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith's Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed World Centre, and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a destination for Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed pilgrimage.\nBuilt on the slopes of Mount Carmel, the settlement has a history spanning more than 3,000 years. The earliest known settlement in the vicinity was Tell Abu Hawam, a small port city established in the Late Bronze Age (14th century BCE). In the 3rd century CE, Haifa was known as a dye-making center. Over the millennia, the Haifa area has changed hands: being conquered and ruled by the Canaanites, Israelites, Phoenicians, Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, Hasmoneans, Romans, Byzantines, Arabs, Crusaders, Ottomans, and the British. During the Battle of Haifa in the 1948 Palestine war, most of the city's Arab population fled or were expelled. That year, the city became part of the then-newly-established state of Israel.\nAs of 2016[ [update]], the city is a major seaport located on Israel's Mediterranean coastline in the Bay of Haifa covering . It lies about north of Tel Aviv and is the major regional center of northern Israel. Two respected academic institutions, the University of Haifa and the Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology the oldest and top ranked university in both Israel and the Middle East, are located in Haifa, in addition to the largest K\u201312 school in Israel, the Hebrew Reali School. The city plays an important role in Israel's economy. It is home to Matam, one of the oldest and largest high-tech parks in the country; and prior to the opening of Tel Aviv Light Rail, Haifa is the only city with underground rapid transit system in Israel known as the Carmelit. Haifa Bay is a center of heavy industry, petroleum refining and chemical processing. Haifa formerly functioned as the western terminus of an oil pipeline from Iraq via Jordan. It is one of Israel's mixed cities, with an Arab-Israeli population of c.10%.\nEtymology.\nThe ultimate origin of the name Haifa remains unclear. One theory holds it derives from the name of the high priest Caiaphas. Some Christians believe it was named for Saint Peter, whose Aramaic name was Keipha. Another theory holds it could be derived from the Hebrew verb root \u05d7\u05e4\u05d4 (\"hafa\"), from H-f-h root (\u05d7-\u05e4-\u05d4), meaning to cover or shield, i.e. Mount Carmel covers Haifa; others point to a possible origin in the Hebrew word \u05d7\u05d5\u05b9\u05e3 (\"hof\"), meaning \"shore\", or \u05d7\u05d5\u05b9\u05e3 \u05d9\u05b8\u05e4\u05b6\u05d4 (\"hof yafe\"), meaning \"beautiful shore\".\nOther spellings in English included \"Caipha\", \"Kaipha\", \"Caiffa\", \"Kaiffa\" and \"Khaifa\".\nLocations and names.\nSycaminum and Efa.\nThe earliest named settlement within the area of modern-day Haifa was the city Sycaminum. The remains of the ancient town can be found in a coastal tell, or archaeological mound, known in Hebrew as , meaning 'mound of the Ficus sycomorus', and in Arabic as or , meaning 'mound of the sumak trees', names that preserved and transformed the ancient name, by which the town is mentioned once in the Mishnah (composed c. 200 CE) for the wild fruits that grow around it.\nThe name \"Efa\" first appears during Roman rule, some time after the end of the 1st century, when a Roman fortress and small Jewish settlement were established not far from Tel Shikmona. Haifa is also mentioned more than 100 times in the Talmud, a work central to Judaism.\n\"Hefa\" or \"Hepha\" in Eusebius of Caesarea's 4th-century work, \"Onomasticon\", is said to be another name for Sycaminus. This synonymizing of the names is explained by Moshe Sharon, who writes that the twin ancient settlements, which he calls Haifa-Sycaminon, gradually expanded into one another, becoming a twin city known by the Greek names Sycaminon or Sycaminos Polis. References to this city end with the Byzantine period.\nPorphyreon.\nAround the 6th century, \"Porphyreon\" or \"Porphyrea\" is mentioned in the writings of William of Tyre, and while it lies within the area covered by modern Haifa, it was a settlement situated south of Haifa-Sycaminon.\nEarly Muslim Haifa.\nFollowing the Arab conquest in the 7th century, \"Haifa\" was used to refer to a site established on Tel Shikmona upon what were already the ruins of Sycaminon (Shiqmona). Haifa (or Haifah) is mentioned by the mid-11th-century Persian chronicler Nasir Khusraw, and the 12th- and 13th-century Arab chroniclers, Muhammad al-Idrisi and Yaqut al-Hamawi. Nasir-i-Khusrau visited in 1047; he noted that \"Haifa lies on the seashore, and there are here palm-gardens and trees in numbers. There are in this town shipbuilders, who build very large craft.\"\nCrusader Caiphas.\nThe Crusaders, who captured Haifa briefly in the 12th century, called it \"Caiphas\", and believe its name related to Cephas, the Aramaic name of Simon Peter. Eusebius is also said to have referred to Hefa as \"Caiaphas civitas\", and Benjamin of Tudela, the 12th-century Jewish traveller and chronicler, is said to have attributed the city's founding to Caiaphas, the Jewish high priest at the time of Jesus.\nLate Ottoman \"Old Haifa\".\n (Arabic: \"Ancient Haifa\") is another name used by some locals to refer to Tell es-Samak, when it was the site of a hamlet of 250 residents, before the settlement was moved in 1764\u20131765 to the site from which the modern city emerged.\nHaifa al-Jadida (New Haifa) and modern Haifa.\nIn 1764\u20131765 Zahir al-Umar moved the village to a new site to the east, which he also fortified. The new village, the nucleus of modern Haifa, was first called (Arabic: \"the new construction\") by some, but others residing there called it (\"New Haifa\") at first, and then simply \"Haifa\".\nIn the early 20th century, Haifa al 'Atiqa was repopulated with many Arab Christians in an overall neighborhood in which many Middle Eastern Jews were established inhabitants, as Haifa expanded outward from its new location.\nHistory.\nBronze Age: Tell Abu Hawam.\nA town known today as Tell Abu Hawam was established during the Late Bronze Age (14th century BCE). It was a port and fishing village.\nIn the Hebrew Bible.\nMount Carmel and the Kishon River are mentioned in the Hebrew Bible.\nA grotto on the top of Mount Carmel is known as the \"Cave of Elijah\", traditionally linked to the Prophet Elijah and his apprentice, Elisha. In Arabic, the highest peak of the Carmel range is called the \"Muhraka\", or \"place of burning\", harking back to the burnt offerings and sacrifices there in Canaanite and early Israelite times.\nPersian and Hellenistic period: near Shikmona.\nIn the sixth century BCE, during the Persian period, Greek geographer Scylax wrote of a city \"between the bay and the Promontory of Zeus\" (i.e., the Carmel), which may be a reference to Shikmona, a locality in the Haifa area.\nBy Hellenistic times, the city had moved to a new site south of what is now the Bat Galim neighborhood of modern Haifa because the old port's harbour had become blocked with sand. A Greek-speaking population living along the coast at this time was engaged in commerce.\nShikmona.\nHaifa was located near the town of Shikmona, a center for making the traditional Tekhelet dye used in the garments of the high priests in the Temple. The archaeological site of Shikmona is southwest of Bat Galim.\nEarly Haifa is believed to have occupied the area which extends from the present-day Rambam Hospital to the Jewish Cemetery on Yafo Street. The inhabitants engaged in fishing and agriculture.\nRoman period.\nIn about the 3rd century CE, Haifa was first mentioned in Talmudic literature, as a Jewish fishing village and the home of Rabbi Avdimi and other Jewish scholars. According to the Talmud, fishermen caught Murex, sea snails which yielded purple dye used to make \"tallit\" (Jewish prayer shawls) from Haifa to the Ladder of the Tyrians. Tombs dating from the Roman era, including Jewish burial caves, have been found in the area.\nByzantine period.\nUnder Byzantine rule, Haifa continued to grow but did not assume major importance. A \"kinah\" speaks of the destruction of the Jewish community of Haifa along with other communities when the Byzantines reconquered the country from the Sasanian Empire in 628 during the Byzantine-Sasanian War.\nEarly Muslim period.\nFollowing the Arab conquest of Palestine in the 630s\u201340s, Haifa was largely overlooked in favor of the port city of 'Akka. Under the Rashidun Caliphate, Haifa began to develop.\nIn the 9th century under the Umayyad and Abbasid Caliphates, Haifa established trading relations with Egyptian ports and the city featured several shipyards. The inhabitants, Arabs and Jews, engaged in trade and maritime commerce. Glass production and dye-making from marine snails were the city's most lucrative industries.\nCrusader, Ayyubid and Mamluk rule.\nProsperity ended in 1100 or 1101, when Haifa was besieged and blockaded by European Christians shortly after the end of the First Crusade, and then conquered after a fierce battle with its Jewish inhabitants and Fatimid garrison. Jews comprised the majority of the city's population at the time. Under the Crusaders, Haifa was reduced to a small fortified coastal stronghold. It was a part of the Principality of Galilee within the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Following their victory at the Battle of Hattin, Saladin's Ayyubid army captured Haifa in mid-July 1187 and the city's Crusader fortress was destroyed. The Crusaders under Richard the Lionheart retook Haifa in 1191.\nIn the 12th century religious hermits started inhabiting the caves on Mount Carmel, and in the 13th century they formed a new Catholic monastic order, the Carmelites. Under Muslim rule, the church which they had built on Mount Carmel was turned into a mosque, later becoming a hospital. In the 19th century, it was restored as a Carmelite monastery, the Stella Maris Monastery. The altar of the church as we see it today, stands over a cave associated with Prophet Elijah.\nIn 1265, the army of Mamluk sultan Baibars captured Haifa, destroying its fortifications, which had been rebuilt by King Louis IX of France, as well as the majority of the city's homes to prevent the European Crusaders from returning. From the time of its conquest by the Mamluks to the 15th century, Haifa was an unfortified small village or uninhabited. At various times there were a few Jews living there and both Jews and Christians made pilgrimages to the Cave of Elijah on Mount Carmel. During Mamluk rule in the 14th century, al-Idrisi wrote that Haifa served as the port for Tiberias and featured a \"fine harbor for the anchorage of galleys and other vessels.\nOttoman period.\nHaifa was apparently uninhabited at the time the Ottoman Empire conquered Palestine in 1516. The first indication of its resettlement was given in a description by German traveller Leonhard Rauwolf, who visited Palestine in 1575. In 1596, Haifa appeared in Ottoman tax registers as being in the \"Nahiya\" of Sahil Atlit of the \"Liwa\" of Lajjun. It had a population of 32 Muslim households and paid taxes on wheat, barley, summer crops, olives, and goats or beehives. Haifa was subsequently mentioned in the accounts of travelers as a half-ruined impoverished village with few inhabitants. The expansion of commercial trade between Europe and Palestine in the 17th century saw Haifa's revival as a flourishing port as more ships began docking there rather than Acre.\nIn 1742, Haifa was a small village and had a Jewish community composed mainly of immigrants from Morocco and Algeria which had a synagogue. It had 250 inhabitants in 1764\u20135. It was located at Tell el-Semak, the site of ancient Sycaminum.\nIn 1765, Zahir al-Umar, the Arab ruler of Acre and the Galilee, moved the population to a new fortified site to the east and laid waste to the old site. According to historian Moshe Sharon, the new Haifa was established by Zahir in 1769. This event marked the beginning of modern Haifa. After al-Umar's death in 1775, the town remained under Ottoman rule until 1918, with the exception of two brief periods.\nIn 1799, Napoleon Bonaparte conquered Haifa during his unsuccessful campaign to conquer Palestine and Syria, but he soon had to withdraw; in the campaign's final proclamation, Napoleon took credit for having razed the fortifications of \"Ka\u00efffa\" (as the name was spelled at the time) along with those of Gaza, Jaffa and Acre.\nBetween 1831 and 1840, the Egyptian viceroy Muhammad Ali governed Haifa, after his son Ibrahim Pasha had wrested control over it from the Ottomans. When the Egyptian occupation ended and Acre declined, the importance of Haifa rose. In 1858, the walled city of Haifa was overcrowded and the first houses began to be built outside the city walls on the mountain slope. The British Survey of Western Palestine estimated Haifa's population to be about 3,000 in 1859.\nHaifa remained majority Muslim throughout this time but a small Jewish community continued to exist there. In 1798, Rabbi Nachman of Breslov spent Rosh Hashanah with the Jewish community of Haifa. In 1839 the Jewish population numbered 124. Due to the growing influence of the Carmelite monks, Haifa's Christian population also grew. By 1840 approximately 40% of the inhabitants were Christian Arabs.\nThe arrival of German messianics, many of whom were Templers, in 1868, who settled in what is now known as the German Colony, was a turning point in Haifa's development. The Templers built and operated a steam-based power station, opened factories and inaugurated carriage services to Acre, Nazareth and Tiberias, playing a key role in modernizing the city.\nThe first major wave of Jewish immigration to Haifa took place in the mid-19th century from Morocco, with a smaller wave of immigration from Turkey a few years later. In the 1870s, large numbers of Jewish and Arab migrants came to Haifa due to the town's growing prosperity. Jews constituted one-eighth of Haifa's population, almost all of whom were recent immigrants from Morocco and Turkey who lived in the Jewish Quarter, which was located in the eastern part of the town. Continued Jewish immigration gradually raised the Jewish population of Haifa, and included a small number of Ashkenazi families, most of whom opened hotels for Jewish migrants coming into the city. In 1875, the Jewish community of Haifa held its own census which counted the Jewish population at about 200. The First Aliyah of the late 19th century and the Second Aliyah of the early 20th century saw Jewish immigrants, mainly from Eastern Europe, arrive in Haifa in significant numbers. In particular, a significant number of Jewish immigrants from Romania settled in Haifa in the 1880s during the First Aliyah period. The Central Jewish Colonisation Society in Romania purchased over near Haifa. As the Jewish settlers had been city dwellers, they hired the former fellahin tenants to instruct them in agriculture. The Jewish population rose from 1,500 in 1900 to 3,000 on the eve of World War I.\nIn the early 20th century, Haifa began to emerge as an industrial port city and growing population center. A branch of the Hejaz Railway, known as the Jezreel Valley railway, was built between 1903 and 1905. The railway increased the city's volume of trade, and attracted workers and foreign merchants. In 1912, construction began on the Technion Institute of Technology, a Jewish technical school that was to later become one of Israel's top universities, although studies did not begin until 1924. The Jews of Haifa also founded numerous factories and cultural institutions.\nBah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed faith's shrine.\nIn 1909, Haifa became important to the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith when the remains of the B\u00e1b, founder of the B\u00e1b\u00ed Faith and forerunner of Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h in the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith, were moved from Acre to Haifa and interred in the shrine built on Mount Carmel. Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds consider the shrine to be their second holiest place on Earth after the Shrine of Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h in Acre. Its precise location on Mount Carmel was shown by Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h himself to his eldest son, \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1, in 1891. \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 planned the structure, which was designed and completed several years later by his grandson, Shoghi Effendi. In a separate room, the remains of \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 were buried in November 1921.\nBritish Mandate.\nHaifa was captured from the Ottomans in September 1918 by Indian horsemen of the British Army armed with spears and swords who overran Ottoman positions. On 22 September, British troops were heading to Nazareth when a reconnaissance report was received indicating that the Turks were leaving Haifa. The British made preparations to enter the city and came under fire in the Balad al-Sheikh district (today Nesher). After the British regrouped, an elite unit of Indian horsemen were sent to attack the Turkish positions on the flanks and overrun their artillery guns on Mount Carmel.\nUnder the British Mandate, Haifa saw large-scale development and became an industrial port city. The Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith in 1918 and today has its administrative and spiritual centre in the environs of Haifa. Many Jewish immigrants of the Fourth Aliyah and Fifth Aliyah settled in Haifa. The port was a major source of income, and the nearby Jewish towns of the Krayot were established in the 1930s. At the same time, the Arab population also swelled by an influx of migrants, coming mainly from surrounding villages as well as the Syrian Hauran. The Arab immigration mainly came as a result of prices and salary drop. The 1922 census of Palestine, conducted by the British authorities, recorded Haifa's population as 24,634 (9,377 Muslims, 8,863 Christians, 6,230 Jews, 152 Baha'i, and 12 Druze). By the time of the 1931 census of Palestine, this had increased to 50,403 (20,324 Muslims, 15,923 Jews, 13,824 Christians, 196 Baha'i, 126 Druze, and 10 with no religion). Between the censuses of 1922 and 1931, the Muslim, Jewish, and Christian populations rose by 217%, 256%, and 156%, respectively. In 1938, 99,000 people (including 48,000 Jews) lived in Haifa.\nHaifa's development owed much to British plans to make it a central port and hub for Middle-East crude oil. The British Government of Palestine developed the port and built refineries, thereby facilitating the rapid development of the city as a center for the country's heavy industries. Haifa was also among the first towns to be fully electrified. The Palestine Electric Company inaugurated the Haifa Electrical Power Station already in 1925, opening the door to considerable industrialization. The State-run Palestine Railways also built its main workshops in Haifa.\nDuring World War II, the city was repeatedly hit during the Italian bombing of Mandatory Palestine, with the port and refineries being major targets.\nBy 1945 the population was 138,300 (75,500 Jews, 35,940 Muslims, 26,570 Christians, and 290 \"other\"). In 1947, about 70,910 Arabs (41,000 Muslims and 29,910 Christians) and 74,230 Jews were living there. The Christian community were mostly Greek-Melkite Catholics.\n1947\u20131948 Civil War in Palestine.\nThe 1947 UN Partition Plan in late November 1947 designated Haifa as part of the proposed Jewish state. Arab protests over that decision evolved into violence between Jews and Arabs that left several dozen people dead during December. The Arab city was in a state of chaos. The local Arab national committee tried to stabilize the situation by organizing garrison, calming the frightened residents and to stop the flight. In a public statement, the national committee called upon the Arab residents to obey orders, be alert, keep calm, and added: \"Keep away the cowards who wish to flee. Expell them from your lines. Despise them, because they harm more than the enemy\". Despite the efforts, Arab residents abandoned the streets which bordered Jewish neighborhoods and during the days of the general strike instigated by the Arab Higher Committee, some 250 Arab families abandoned the Khalisa neighborhood.\nOn 30 December 1947, members of the Irgun, a Jewish underground militia, threw bombs into a crowd of Arabs outside the gates of the Consolidated Refineries in Haifa, killing six and injuring 42. In response, Arab employees of the company killed 39 Jewish employees in what became known as the Haifa Oil Refinery massacre. The Jewish Haganah militia retaliated with a raid on the Arab village of Balad al-Shaykh, where many of the Arab refinery workers lived, in what became known as the Balad al-Shaykh massacre.\nBritish forces in Haifa redeployed on 21 April 1948, withdrawing from most of the city while still maintaining control over the port facilities. According to Ilan Papp\u00e9, although the Jewish mayor of the city, Shabtai Levy, urged the Arab residents to stay, in other parts of town loudspeakers could be heard ordering Arabs to leave \"before it's too late.\"\nOn 21 April, the downtown, controlled by a combination of local and foreign (ALA) Arab irregulars, was assaulted by Jewish forces in Operation Bi'ur Hametz by the Carmeli Brigade of the Haganah, commanded by Moshe Carmel. Arab neighborhoods were attacked with mortars and gunfire, which, according to Ilan Papp\u00e9, culminated in an attack on a Palestinian crowd in the old marketplace using three-inch (76\u00a0mm) mortars on 22 April 1948.\nRashid al-Haj Ibrahim, a Palestinian Arab municipal leader, described attacks \"provoking terror among the women and children, who were very influenced by the horrors of Dayr Yasin\", and provided an eyewitness account of the flight of Haifa's Arab residents:\nThe operation led to a massive displacement of Haifa's Arab population, and was part of the larger 1948 Palestinian expulsion and flight. According to \"The Economist\" at the time, only 5,000\u20136,000 of the city's 62,000 Arabs remained there by 2 October 1948. Morris quotes British sources as stating that during the battles between 22 and 23 April 100 Arabs were killed and 100 wounded, but he adds that the total may have been higher.\nHistorian Walid Khalidi described \"the mass exodus of Haifa\u2019s Arab population\" as \"the spontaneous reaction to the ruthless combination of terror and psychological warfare tactics adopted by the Haganah during the attack.\"https://\nState of Israel.\nAfter the Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel on 14 May 1948 Haifa became the gateway for Jewish immigration into Israel. During the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War, the neighborhoods of Haifa were sometimes contested. After the war, Jewish immigrants were settled in new neighborhoods, among them Kiryat Hayim, Ramot Remez, Ramat Shaul, Kiryat Sprinzak, and Kiryat Eliezer. Bnei Zion Hospital (formerly Rothschild Hospital) and the Central Synagogue in Hadar HaCarmel date from this period. In 1953, a master plan was created for transportation and the future architectural layout. In 1959, a group of Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews, mostly Moroccan Jews, rioted in Wadi Salib, claiming the state was discriminating against them. Their demand for \"bread and work\" was directed at the state institutions and what they viewed as an Ashkenazi elite in the Labor Party and the Histadrut.\nTel Aviv gained in status, while Haifa suffered a decline in the role as regional capital. The opening of Ashdod as a port exacerbated this. Tourism shrank when the Israeli Ministry of Tourism placed emphasis on developing Tiberias as a tourist centre. Nevertheless, Haifa's population had reached 200,000 by the early 1970s, and mass immigration from the former Soviet Union boosted the population by a further 35,000. The Matam high-tech park, the first dedicated high-tech park in Israel, opened in Haifa in the 1970s. Many of Wadi Salib's historic Ottoman buildings have now been demolished, and in the 1990s a major section of the Old City was razed to make way for a new municipal center.\nFrom 1999 to 2003, several Palestinian suicide attacks took place in Haifa (in Maxim and Matza restaurants, bus 37, and others), killing 68 civilians. In 2006, Haifa was hit by 93 Hezbollah rockets during the Second Lebanon War, killing 11 civilians and leading to half of the city's population fleeing at the end of the first week of the war. Among the places hit by rockets were a train depot and the oil refinery complex.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nHaifa is Israel's third-largest city, consisting of 103,000 households, or a population of 298,312. Immigrants from the former Soviet Union constitute 25% of Haifa's population, thus making Russian one of the three main spoken languages of the city.\nAccording to the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics, Israeli Arabs constitute 10% of Haifa's population, the majority living in the Wadi Nisnas, Abbas and Khalisa neighborhoods. The Wadi Nisnas and Abbas neighborhoods are largely Christian, Khalisa and Kababir are largely Muslim, while Ein HaYam is a mixed Arab Christian and Muslim neighborhood. Haifa is commonly portrayed as a model of co-existence between Arabs and Jews, although tensions and hostility do still exist.\nBetween 1994 and 2009, the city had a declining and aging population compared to Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, as young people moved to the center of the country for education and jobs, while young families migrated to bedroom communities in the suburbs. However, as a result of new projects and improving infrastructure, the city managed to reverse its population decline, reducing emigration while attracting more internal migration into the city. In 2009, positive net immigration into the city was shown for the first time in 15 years.\nA development plan approved in 2016 seeks to raise Haifa's population to 330,000 residents by 2025.\nReligious and ethnic communities.\nThe population is heterogeneous. Israeli Jews comprise some 82% of the population, almost 14% are Christians (the majority of whom are Arab Christians) and, some 4% are Muslims. Haifa also includes Druze and Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith communities. In 2006, 27% of the Arab population was aged 14 and under, compared to 17% of the Jewish and other population groups. The trend continues in the age 15\u201329 group, in which 27% of the Arab population is found, and the age 30\u201344 group (23%). The population of Jews and others in these age groups are 22% and 18% respectively. Nineteen percent of the city's Jewish and other population is between 45 and 59, compared to 14% of the Arab population. This continues with 14% of Jews and others aged 60\u201374 and 10% over age 75, in comparison to 7% and just 2% respectively in the Arab population. Arabs in Haifa tend to be wealthier and better educated compare to other Arabs elsewhere in Israel.\nHaifa is home to the second-largest Arab Christian community in Israel, many of them lives in the Arabic-speaking neighborhoods in the lowlands near the sea; neighborhoods such as German Colony, Wadi Nisnas and Abbas, are largely Arab Christian. There are also a significant number of wealthy Christian Arabs in the Hadar West and Central. The Christian communities of Haifa are varied and included various denominations, the most prominent among them the Melkite Greek Catholic, followed by Greek Orthodox, Latin Catholics, Maronites, Armenian Orthodox, and Protestants. The Christian Arab communities in Haifa tend to be wealthier and better educated compare to other Arabs elsewhere in Israel. The Melkite Greek Catholic Archeparchy of Akka is based in Haifa, and its cathedral episcopal see is St. Elijah Greek-Melkite Cathedral.\nFollowing Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon in 2000, some former South Lebanon Army soldiers and officers who fled from Lebanon settled in Haifa with their families.\nIn 2006, 2.9% of the Jews in the city were Haredi, compared to 7.5% on a national scale. However, the Haredi community in Haifa is growing fast due to a high fertility rate. 66.6% were secular, compared to a national average of 43.7%. There is also a Scandinavian Seamen Protestant church, established by Norwegian Righteous Among the Nations pastor Per Faye-Hansen.\nHaifa is the center of liberal Arabic-speaking culture, as it was under British colonial rule. The Arabic-speaking neighborhoods, which are mixed Muslim and Christian, are in the lowlands near the sea, while Jewish neighborhoods are at a higher elevation. An active Arab cultural life has developed in the 21st century. The city is the center of many Arab-owned businesses such as theaters, bars, cafes, restaurants and nightclubs which also host different cultural discussions and art exhibitions.\nGeography.\nHaifa is situated on the Israeli Mediterranean Coastal Plain, the historic land bridge between Europe, Africa, and Asia, and the mouth of the Kishon River. Located on the northern slopes of Mount Carmel and around Haifa Bay, the city is split over three tiers. The lowest is the center of commerce and industry including the Port of Haifa. The middle level is on the slopes of Mount Carmel and consists of older residential neighborhoods, while the upper level consists of modern neighborhoods looking over the lower tiers. From here views can be had across the Western Galilee region of Israel towards Rosh HaNikra and the Lebanese border. Haifa is about north of the city of Tel Aviv, and has a large number of beaches on the Mediterranean.\nFlora and fauna.\nThe Carmel Mountain has three main wadis: Lotem, Amik and Si'ach. For the most part these valleys are undeveloped natural corridors that run up through the city from the coast to the top of the mountain. Marked hiking paths traverse these areas and they provide habitat for wildlife such as wild boar, golden jackal, hyrax, Egyptian mongoose, owls and chameleons.\nHaifa is inundated with boars. The boars began to descend from the valleys around the city from before 2019, and began to roam in the city's streets. In 2019, mayor Einat Kalisch-Rotem decided to stop shooting the boars. Boar sighting figures have struggled to go down since the Israel Nature and Parks Authority began fencing off forested areas, because residents often feed the boars.\nClimate.\nHaifa has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate with hot, dry summers and mild, rainy winters (K\u00f6ppen climate classification \"Csa\"). Spring arrives in March when temperatures begin to increase. By late May, the temperature has warmed up considerably to herald warm summer days. The average temperature in summer is and in winter, . Frost is rare in Haifa, but temperatures around can sometimes occur, usually in the early morning. Snow is very rare, which last fell in 1950. Humidity tends to be high all year round, and rain usually occurs between September and May. Annual precipitation is approximately .\nNeighborhoods.\nHaifa has developed in tiers, from the lower to the upper city on the Carmel. The oldest neighborhood in modern Haifa is Wadi Salib, the Old City center near the port, which has been bisected by a major road and razed in part to make way for Government Buildings. Wadi Salib stretches across to Wadi Nisnas, the center of Arab life in Haifa today. In the 19th century, under Ottoman rule, the German Colony was built, providing the first model of urban planning in Haifa. Some of the buildings have been restored and the colony has turned into a center of Haifa nightlife.\nThe first buildings in Hadar were constructed at the start of the 20th century. Hadar was Haifa's cultural center and marketplace throughout the 1920s and into the 1980s, nestled above and around Haifa's Arab neighborhoods. Today Hadar stretches from the port area near the bay, approximately halfway up Mount Carmel, around the German Colony, Wadi Nisnas and Wadi Salib. Hadar houses two commercial centers (one in the port area, and one midway up the mountain) surrounded by some of the city's older neighborhoods.\nNeve Sha'anan, a neighborhood located on the second tier of Mount Carmel, was founded in the 1920s. West of the port are the neighborhoods of Bat Galim, Shikmona Beach, and Kiryat Eliezer. To the west and east of Hadar are the Arab neighborhoods of Abbas and Khalisa, built in the 1960s and 70s. To the south of Mount Carmel's headland, along the road to Tel Aviv, are the neighborhoods of Ein HaYam, Shaar HaAliya, Kiryat Sprinzak and Neve David.\nAbove Hadar are affluent neighborhoods such as the Carmel Tzarfati (French Carmel), Merkaz HaCarmel (Carmel Center), Romema (Ramot Ben Gurion), Ahuzat HaCarmel (Ahuza), Carmeliya, Vardiya, Ramat Golda, Ramat Alon and Hod Ha'Carmel (Denya). While there are general divisions between Arab and Jewish neighborhoods, there is an increasing trend for wealthy Arabs to move into affluent Jewish neighborhoods. Another Carmel neighborhood is Kababir, home to the National Headquarters of Israel's Ahmadiyya Community; located near Merkaz HaCarmel and overlooking the coast.\nUrban development.\nRecently, residential construction has been concentrated around Kiryat Haim and Kiryat Shmuel, with of new residential construction between 2002 and 2004, the Carmel, with , and Ramot Neve Sha'anan with approximately Non-residential construction was highest in the Lower Town, (90,000 sq m), Haifa Bay (72,000 sq m) and Ramot Neve Sha'anan (54,000 sq m). In 2004, 80% of construction in the city was private.\nCurrently, the city has a modest number of skyscrapers and high-rise buildings. Though buildings rising up to 20 stories were built on Mount Carmel in the past, the Haifa municipality banned the construction of any new buildings taller than nine stories on Mount Carmel in July 2012.\nThe neighborhood of Wadi Salib, located in the heart of downtown Haifa, is being redeveloped. Most of its Jewish and Arab residents are considered squatters and have been gradually evicted over the years. The Haifa Economic Corporation Ltd is developing two 1,000 square meter lots for office and commercial use. Some historic buildings have been renovated and redeveloped, especially into nightclubs and theaters, such as the Palace of the Pasha, a Turkish bathhouse, and a Middle Eastern music and dance club, which has been converted into theaters and offices.\nIn 2012, a new, massive development plan was announced for Haifa's waterfront. According to the plan, the western section of the city's port will be torn down, and all port activity will be moved to the east. The west side of the port will be transformed into a tourism and nightlife center and a point of embarkation and arrival for sea travel through the construction of public spaces, a beach promenade, and the renovation of commercial buildings. The train tracks that currently bisect the city and separate the city's beach from the rest of Haifa will also be buried. A park will be developed on the border of the Kishon River, the refineries' cooling towers will be turned into a visitors' center, and bridges will lead from the port to the rest of the city. Massive renovations are also currently underway in Haifa's lower town, in the Turkish market and Paris Square, which will become the city's business center. In addition, the ammonia depository tank in the Haifa bay industrial zone will be dismantled, and a new one built in an alternative location.\nAnother plan seeks to turn the western section of Haifa Port into a major tourism and nightlife center, as well as a functioning point of embarkation and arrival for sea travel. All port activity will be moved to the western side, and the area will be redeveloped. Public spaces and a beach promenade will be developed, and commercial buildings will be renovated. As part of the development plans, the Israeli Navy, which has a large presence in Haifa, will withdraw from the shoreline between Bat Galim and Hof Hashaket. A long esplanade which will encircle the shoreline will be constructed. It will include a bicycle path, and possibly also a small bridge under which navy vessels will pass on their way to the sea.\nIn addition, a 50,000 square-meter entertainment complex that will contain a Disney theme park, cinemas, shops, and a 25-screen Multiplex theater will be built at the Check Post exit from the Carmel Tunnels. In 2014, a new major plan for the city was proposed, under which extensive development of residential, business, and leisure areas will take place with the target of increasing the city's population by 60,000 by 2025. Under the plan, five new neighborhoods will be built, along with new high-tech parks. In addition, existing employment centers will be renovated, and new leisure areas and a large park will be built.\nIn 2016, a new plan for the city was approved. The plan included a new main downtown business district, the creation of a park in a current industrial area, new construction and renovation of public buildings and hubs of higher education, tourism, culture, commerce, leisure, and residence.\nEconomy.\nThe common Israeli saying, \"Haifa works, Jerusalem prays, and Tel Aviv plays\" attests to Haifa's reputation as a city of workers and industry. The industrial region of Haifa is in the eastern part of the city, around the Kishon River. It is home to the Haifa oil refinery, one of the two oil refineries in Israel (the other refinery being located in Ashdod). The Haifa refinery processes 9\u00a0million tons (66\u00a0million barrels) of crude oil a year. Its nowadays unused twin 80-meter high cooling towers, built in the 1930s, were the tallest buildings built in the British Mandate period. \"Matam\" (short for \"Merkaz Ta'asiyot Mada\" \u2013 Scientific Industries Center), the largest and oldest business park in Israel, is at the southern entrance to the city, hosting manufacturing and R&amp;D facilities for a large number of Israeli and international hi-tech companies, such as Apple, Amazon, Abbot, Cadence, Intel, IBM, Magic Leap, Microsoft, Motorola, Google, Yahoo!, Elbit, CSR, Philips, PwC and Amdocs. The campus of the University of Haifa is also home to IBM Haifa Labs.\nThe Port of Haifa is the leader in passenger traffic among Israeli ports, and is also a major cargo harbor, although deregulation has seen its dominance challenged by the Port of Ashdod. Haifa malls and shopping centers include Hutsot Hamifratz, Horev Center Mall, Panorama Center, Castra Center, Colony Center (Lev HaMoshava), Hanevi'im Tower Mall, Kanyon Haifa, Lev Hamifratz Mall and Grand Kanyon. In 2010, \"Monocle\" magazine identified Haifa as the city with the most promising business potential, with the greatest investment opportunities in the world. The magazine noted that \"a massive head-to-toe regeneration is starting to have an impact; from scaffolding and cranes around town, to renovated fa\u00e7ades and new smart places to eat\". The Haifa municipality had spent more than $350\u00a0million on roads and infrastructure, and the number of building permits had risen 83% in the previous two years.\nIn 2014, it was announced that a technology-focused stock exchange would be established to compete with the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. Currently, some 40 hotels, mostly boutique hotels, are planned, have been approved, or are under construction. The Haifa Municipality is seeking to turn the city into Northern Israel's tourist center, from where travelers can embark on day trips into Acre, Nazareth, Tiberias, and the Galilee. A new life sciences industrial park containing five buildings with 85,000 square meters of space on a 31-duman (7.75 acre) site is being built adjacent to the Matam industrial park.\nTourism.\nIn 2005, Haifa had 13 hotels with a total of 1,462 rooms. The city has a shoreline, of which are beaches. Haifa's main tourist attraction is the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed World Centre, with the golden-domed Shrine of the B\u00e1b and the surrounding gardens. Between 2005 and 2006, 86,037 visited the shrine. In 2008, the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed gardens were designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The restored German Colony, founded by the Templers, Stella Maris and Elijah's Cave also draw many tourists. Located in the Haifa district are the Ein Hod artists' colony, where over 90 artists and craftsmen have studios and exhibitions, and the Mount Carmel national park, with caves where Neanderthal and early Homo Sapiens remains were found.\nA 2007 report commissioned by the Haifa Municipality calls for the construction of more hotels, a ferry line between Haifa, Acre and Caesarea, development of the western anchorage of the port as a recreation and entertainment area, and an expansion of the local airport and port to accommodate international travel and cruise ships.\nArts and culture.\nDespite its image as a port and industrial city, Haifa is the cultural hub of northern Israel. During the 1950s, mayor Abba Hushi made a special effort to encourage authors and poets to move to the city, and founded the Haifa Theatre, a repertory theater, the first municipal theater founded in the country. The principal Arabic theater servicing the northern Arab population is the al-Midan Theater. Other theaters in the city include the Krieger Centre for the Performing Arts and the Rappaport Art and Culture Center. The Congress Center hosts exhibitions, concerts and special events.\nThe New Haifa Symphony Orchestra, established in 1950, has more than 5,000\u00a0subscribers. In 2004, 49,000 people attended its concerts. The Haifa Cinematheque, founded in 1975, hosts the annual Haifa International Film Festival during the intermediate days of the Sukkot holiday. Haifa has 29 movie theaters. The city publishes a local newspaper, Yediot Haifa, and has its own radio station, Radio Haifa.http:// The Israeli Arabic-language newspapers Al-Ittihad and Al-Madina are also based in Haifa. During the 1990s, Haifa hosted the Haifa Rock &amp; Blues Festival featuring Bob Dylan, Nick Cave, Blur and PJ Harvey. The last festival was held in 1995 with Sheryl Crow, Suede and Faith No More as headliners.\nMuseums.\nHaifa has over a dozen museums. The most popular museum is the Israel National Museum of Science, Technology, and Space, which recorded almost 150,000\u00a0visitors in 2004. The museum is located in the historic Technion building in the Hadar neighborhood. The Haifa Museum of Art houses a collection of modern and classical art, as well as displays on the history of Haifa. The Tikotin Museum of Japanese Art is the only museum in the Middle East dedicated solely to Japanese art. Other museums in Haifa include the Museum of Prehistory, the National Maritime Museum and Haifa City Museum, the Hecht Museum, the Dagon Archaeological Museum of Grain Handling, the Railway Museum, the Clandestine Immigration and Naval Museum, the Israeli Oil Industry Museum, and Chagall Artists' House. As part of his campaign to bring culture to Haifa, Mayor Abba Hushi provided the artist Mane-Katz with a building on Mount Carmel to house his collection of Judaica, which is now a museum. The former home and studio of artist Hermann Struck is now the Hermann Struck Museum. The Haifa Educational Zoo at Gan HaEm park houses a small animal collection including Syrian brown bears, now extinct from Israel. W\u05dfthin the zoo is the Pinhas House biology institute. In the close vicinity of Haifa, on the Carmel, the Northern \"Hai-Bar\" (\"wild life\") operated by Israel's Parks and Reserves Authority for the purpose of breeding and reintroduction of species now extinct from Israel, such as Persian Fallow Deer.\nGovernment.\nAs an industrial port city, Haifa has traditionally been a Labor party stronghold. The strong presence of dock workers and trade unions earned it the nickname 'Red Haifa.' In addition, many prominent Arabs in the Israeli Communist Party, among them Tawfik Toubi, Emile Habibi, Zahi Karkabi, Bulus Farah and Emile Toma, were from Haifa. There has been a drift toward the center. This was best signified by, in the 2006 legislative elections, the Kadima party receiving about 28.9% of the votes in Haifa, and Labor lagging behind with 16.9%. Before 1948, Haifa's Municipality was fairly unusual as it developed cooperation between the mixed Arab and Jewish community in the city, with representatives of both groups involved in the city's management. Under mayor al-Haj, between 1920 and 1927, the city council had six Arab and two Jewish representatives, with the city run as a mixed municipality with overall Arab control. Greater cooperation was introduced under Hasan Bey Shukri, who adopted a positive and conciliatory attitude toward the city's Jews and gave them senior posts in the municipality. In 1940, the first Jewish mayor, Shabtai Levy, was elected. Levy's two deputies were Arab (one Muslim, the other Christian), with the remainder of the council made up of four Jews and six Arabs.\nToday, Haifa is governed by its 12th city council, headed by the mayor Einat Kalisch-Rotem. The results of municipal elections decide on the makeup of the council, similarly to the Knesset elections. The city council is the legislative council in the city, and has the authority to pass auxiliary laws. The 12th council, which was elected in 2003, has 31 members, with the liberal Shinui-Greens ticket holding the most seats (6), and Likud coming second with 5. Many of the decisions passed by the city council are results of recommendation made by the various municipal committees, which are committees where non-municipal organs meet with representatives from the city council. Some committees are spontaneous, but some are mandatory, such as the security committee, tender committee and financial committee.\nMayors.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMedical facilities.\nHaifa medical facilities have a total of 4,000 hospital beds. The largest hospital is the government-operated Rambam Hospital with 900 beds and 78,000 admissions in 2004. Bnai Zion Medical Center and Carmel Hospital each have 400 beds. Other hospitals in the city include the Italian Hospital, Elisha Hospital (100 beds), Horev Medical Center (36 beds) and Ramat Marpe (18 beds). Haifa has 20 family health centers. In 2004, there were a total of 177,478 hospital admissions. Rambam Medical Center was in the direct line of fire during the Second Lebanon War in 2006 and was forced to take special precautions to protect its patients. Whole wings of the hospital were moved to large underground shelters.\nEducation.\nHaifa is home to two internationally acclaimed universities and several colleges. The University of Haifa, founded in 1963, is at the top of Mt. Carmel. The campus was designed by the architect of Bras\u00edlia and United Nations Headquarters in New York City, Oscar Niemeyer. The top floor of the 30-story Eshkol Tower provides a panoramic view of northern Israel. The Hecht Museum, with important archeology and art collections, is on the campus of Haifa University.\nThe Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology, was founded in 1912, and became the first higher education institution where the language of teaching is Hebrew (see War of the Languages). It has 18 faculties and 42 research institutes. The original building now houses Israel National Museum of Science, Technology, and Space, also known as Madatech.\nThe Hebrew Reali School was founded in 1913. It is the largest k-12 school in Israel, with 4,000 students in 7 branches, all over the city.\nThe first technological high school in Israel, Bosmat, was established in Haifa in 1933. It was affiliated with the Technion. Because of financial difficulties, it was closed in 2007, and later re-established as part of the Mofet network, which was started by science teachers from the 1990s post-Soviet aliyah.\nOther academic institutions in Haifa are the Gordon College of Education and Sha'anan Religious Teachers' College, the WIZO Haifa Academy of Design and Education, and Tiltan College of Design. The Michlala Leminhal College of Management and the Open University of Israel have branches in Haifa. The city also has a nursing college and the P.E.T Practical Engineering School.\nAmong Israeli higher education institutions the University of Haifa has the largest percentage (41%) of Arab-Israeli students. The Technion Israel Institute of Technology has the second largest percentage (22.2%) of Arab-Israeli students.\nAs of 2006[ [update]]\u201307, Haifa had 70 elementary schools, 23 middle schools, 28 academic high schools and 8 vocational high schools. There were 5,133 pupils in municipal kindergartens, 20,081 in elementary schools, 7,911 in middle schools, 8,072 in academic high schools, 2,646 in vocational high schools, and 2,068 in comprehensive district high schools. 86% of the students attended Hebrew-speaking schools and 14% attended Arab schools. 5% were in special education. In 2004, Haifa had 16 municipal libraries stocking 367,323 books. Two prestigious Arab schools in Haifa are the Orthodox School, run by the Greek Orthodox church, and the Nazareth Nuns' School, a Catholic institution. About 70% of Arab students in Haifa (Christians, Muslims, and Druze) attend Christian schools (6 schools) that found in the city.\nTransportation.\nPublic transportation.\nHaifa is served by six railway stations and the Carmelit, currently Israel's only subway system (another is planned in Tel Aviv). The Nahariya\u2013Tel Aviv Coastal Railway main line of Israel Railways runs along the coast of the Gulf of Haifa and has six stations within the city. From south-west to north-east, these stations are: Haifa Hof HaCarmel, Haifa Bat Galim, Haifa Merkaz HaShmona, HaMifrats Central, Hutzot HaMifratz and Kiryat Haim. Together with the Kiryat Motzkin Railway Station in the northern suburb Kiryat Motzkin, they form the Haifa \u2013 Krayot suburban line (\"Parvarit\"). There are direct trains from Haifa to Tel Aviv, Ben Gurion International Airport, Beersheba, Hadera, Herzliya, Modi'in, Nahariya, Karmiel, Akko, Kiryat Motzkin, Binyamina, Lod, Ramla, Beit Shemesh and others.\nHaifa's intercity bus connections are operated almost exclusively by the Egged bus company, which operates two terminals:\nLines to the North of the country use HaMifratz Central Bus Station and their coverage includes most towns in the North of Israel. Lines heading south use Haifa Hof HaCarmel Central Bus Station.\nDestinations directly reachable from Hof HaCarmel CBS include Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Eilat, Raanana, Netanya, Hadera, Zikhron Ya'akov, Atlit, Tirat Carmel, Ben Gurion International Airport and intermediate communities. There are also three Egged lines that have their terminus in the Ramat Vizhnitz neighborhood and run to Jerusalem, Bnei Brak and Ashdod. These used to be \"mehadrin\" (i.e. gender segregated) lines.\nAll urban lines are run by Egged. There are also share taxis that run along some bus routes but do not have an official schedule. In 2006, Haifa implemented a trial network of neighborhood mini-buses \u2013 named \"Shkhunatit\" and run by Egged. In December 2012, GetTaxi, an app and taxi service which allows users to hail a cab using their smartphone without contacting the taxi station (by identifying and summoning the closest taxi) began operating. In the current initial phase, 50 taxis from the service are operating in Haifa.\nHaifa and the Krayot suburbs also have a new Phileas concept bus rapid transit system called the Metronit. These buses, operating with hybrid engines, follow optical strips embedded in designated lanes of roads, providing tram-like public transportation services. The Metronit consists of 100 18-meter buses, each with the capacity for 150 passengers, operating along of designated roadways. The new system officially opened on 16 August 2013 serving three lines.\nHaifa is one of the few cities in Israel where buses operate on Shabbat. Bus lines operate throughout the city on a reduced schedule from late Saturday morning onwards, and also connect Haifa with Nesher, Tirat Karmel, Yokneam, Nazareth, Nazareth Illit and intermediate communities. Since the summer of 2008, night buses are operated by Egged in Haifa (line 200) and the Krayot suburbs (line 210). During the summer of 2008 these lines operated 7 nights a week. Since 2013, along with route 1 of the Metronit, they operate 7 nights a week, making Haifa as the only city in Israel with 24/7 public transportation. Haifa is also the only city in Israel to operate a Saturday bus service to the beaches during summer time. Egged lines run during Saturday mornings from many neighborhoods to the Dado and Bat Galim beaches, and back in the afternoon.\nThe Haifa subway system is called Carmelit. It is a subterranean funicular railway, running from downtown Paris Square to Gan HaEm (Mother's Park) on Mount Carmel. With a single track, six stations and two trains, it is listed in \"Guinness World Records\" as the world's shortest metro line. The Carmelit accommodates bicycles.\nHaifa also has two cable cars. The Bat Galim cable car consists of six cabins and connects Bat Galim on the coast to the Stella Maris observation deck and monastery atop Mount Carmel. It serves mainly tourists. Opened in April 2022, Rakavlit, the second cable car, is a 4.4-kilometre commuter cable car service, running from HaMifratz Central Bus Station at the foot of Mount Carmel to the Technion, and then to the University of Haifa.\nAir and sea transport.\nHaifa Airport serves international charters to Cyprus (Larnaca and Paphos). Before COVID-19 pandemic Haifa Airport operated flights to Egypt, Greece, Jordan and Turkey as well as domestic flights to Tel Aviv (Sde Dov Airport) and Eilat (Eilat Airport).\nThere are currently plans to expand services from Haifa.\nairHaifa is planning to launch operations during September 2024, when at the beginning it will issue flights on the Haifa-Eilat route and later it will also fly to Cyprus, Greece and Turkey.\nRoads.\nTravel between Haifa and the center of the country is possible by road with Highway 2, the main highway along the coastal plain, beginning at Tel Aviv and ending at Haifa. Furthermore, Highway 4 runs along the coast to the north of Haifa, as well as south, inland from Highway 2. In the past, traffic along Highway 2 to the north of Haifa had to pass through the downtown area of the city.

{"id": "55607", "revid": "20466351", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55607", "title": "Discriminant", "text": "Function of the coefficients of a polynomial that gives information on its roots\nIn mathematics, the discriminant of a polynomial is a quantity that depends on the coefficients and allows deducing some properties of the roots without computing them. More precisely, it is a polynomial function of the coefficients of the original polynomial. The discriminant is widely used in polynomial factoring, number theory, and algebraic geometry.\nThe discriminant of the quadratic polynomial formula_1 is\nformula_2\nthe quantity which appears under the square root in the quadratic formula. If formula_3 this discriminant is zero if and only if the polynomial has a double root. In the case of real coefficients, it is positive if the polynomial has two distinct real roots, and negative if it has two distinct complex conjugate roots. Similarly, the discriminant of a cubic polynomial is zero if and only if the polynomial has a multiple root. In the case of a cubic with real coefficients, the discriminant is positive if the polynomial has three distinct real roots, and negative if it has one real root and two distinct complex conjugate roots. \nMore generally, the discriminant of a univariate polynomial of positive degree is zero if and only if the polynomial has a multiple root. For real coefficients and no multiple roots, the discriminant is positive if the number of non-real roots is a multiple of 4 (including none), and negative otherwise.\nSeveral generalizations are also called discriminant: the \"discriminant of an algebraic number field\"; the \"discriminant of a quadratic form\"; and more generally, the \"discriminant\" of a form, of a homogeneous polynomial, or of a projective hypersurface (these three concepts are essentially equivalent).\nOrigin.\nThe term \"discriminant\" was coined in 1851 by the British mathematician James Joseph Sylvester.\nDefinition.\nLet \nformula_4\nbe a polynomial of degree \"n\" (this means formula_5), such that the coefficients formula_6 belong to a field, or, more generally, to a commutative ring. The resultant of \"A\" with its derivative, \nformula_7 \nis a polynomial in formula_6 with integer coefficients, which is the determinant of the Sylvester matrix of \"A\" and \"A\"\u2032. The nonzero entries of the first column of the Sylvester matrix are formula_9 and formula_10 and the resultant is thus a multiple of formula_11 Hence the discriminant\u2014up to its sign\u2014is defined as the quotient of the resultant of \"A\" and \"A\"' by formula_9:\nformula_13\nwhere the resultant is computed with formula_14 considered of degree formula_15 even if it has a lower degree, which occurs when the characteristic divides formula_16.\nHistorically, this sign has been chosen such that, over the reals, the discriminant will be positive when all the roots of the polynomial are real. The division by formula_9 may not be well defined if the ring of the coefficients contains zero divisors. Such a problem may be avoided by replacing formula_9 by 1 in the first column of the Sylvester matrix\u2014\"before\" computing the determinant. In any case, the discriminant is a polynomial in formula_6 with integer coefficients.\nExpression in terms of the roots.\nWhen the above polynomial is defined over a field, it has \"n\" roots, formula_20, not necessarily all distinct, in any algebraically closed extension of the field. (If the coefficients are real numbers, the roots may be taken in the field of complex numbers, where the fundamental theorem of algebra applies.) \nIn terms of the roots, the discriminant is equal to\nformula_21\nIt is thus the square of the Vandermonde polynomial times formula_22.\nThis expression for the discriminant is often taken as a definition. It makes clear that if the polynomial has a multiple root, then its discriminant is zero, and that, in the case of real coefficients, if all the roots are real and simple, then the discriminant is positive. Unlike the previous definition, this expression is not obviously a polynomial in the coefficients, but this follows either from the fundamental theorem of Galois theory, or from the fundamental theorem of symmetric polynomials and Vieta's formulas by noting that this expression is a symmetric polynomial in the roots of \"A\".\nLow degrees.\nThe discriminant of a linear polynomial (degree 1) is rarely considered. If needed, it is commonly defined to be equal to 1 (using the usual conventions for the empty product and considering that one of the two blocks of the Sylvester matrix is empty). There is no common convention for the discriminant of a constant polynomial (i.e., polynomial of degree 0).\nFor small degrees, the discriminant is rather simple (see below), but for higher degrees, it may become unwieldy. For example, the discriminant of a general quartic has 16 terms, that of a quintic has 59 terms, and that of a sextic has 246 terms.\nThis is OEIS sequence .\nDegree 2.\nThe quadratic polynomial formula_23 has discriminant\nformula_24\nThe square root of the discriminant appears in the quadratic formula for the roots of the quadratic polynomial:\nformula_25\nwhere the discriminant is zero if and only if the two roots are equal. If \"a\", \"b\", \"c\" are real numbers, the polynomial has two distinct real roots if the discriminant is positive, and two complex conjugate roots if it is negative.\nThe discriminant is the product of \"a\"2 and the square of the difference of the roots.\nIf \"a\", \"b\", \"c\" are rational numbers, then the discriminant is the square of a rational number if and only if the two roots are rational numbers.\nDegree 3.\nThe cubic polynomial formula_26 has discriminant\nformula_27\nIn the special case of a depressed cubic polynomial formula_28, the discriminant simplifies to\nformula_29\nThe discriminant is zero if and only if at least two roots are equal. If the coefficients are real numbers, and the discriminant is not zero, the discriminant is positive if the roots are three distinct real numbers, and negative if there is one real root and two complex conjugate roots.\nThe square root of a quantity strongly related to the discriminant appears in the formulas for the roots of a cubic polynomial. Specifically, this quantity can be \u22123 times the discriminant, or its product with the square of a rational number; for example, the square of 1/18 in the case of Cardano formula.\nIf the polynomial is irreducible and its coefficients are rational numbers (or belong to a number field), then the discriminant is a square of a rational number (or a number from the number field) if and only if the Galois group of the cubic equation is the cyclic group of order three.\nDegree 4.\nThe quartic polynomial\nformula_30\nhas discriminant\nformula_31\nThe depressed quartic polynomial\nformula_32\nhas discriminant\nformula_33\nThe discriminant is zero if and only if at least two roots are equal. If the coefficients are real numbers and the discriminant is negative, then there are two real roots and two complex conjugate roots. Conversely, if the discriminant is positive, then the roots are either all real or all non-real.\nProperties.\nZero discriminant.\nThe discriminant of a polynomial over a field is zero if and only if the polynomial has a multiple root in some field extension.\nThe discriminant of a polynomial over an integral domain is zero if and only if the polynomial and its derivative have a non-constant common divisor.\nIn characteristic 0, this is equivalent to saying that the polynomial is not square-free (i.e., it is divisible by the square of a non-constant polynomial).\nIn nonzero characteristic \"p\", the discriminant is zero if and only if the polynomial is not square-free or it has an irreducible factor which is not separable (i.e., the irreducible factor is a polynomial in formula_34).\nInvariance under change of the variable.\nThe discriminant of a polynomial is, up to a scaling, invariant under any projective transformation of the variable. As a projective transformation may be decomposed into a product of translations, homotheties and inversions, this results in the following formulas for simpler transformations, where \"P\"(\"x\") denotes a polynomial of degree \"n\", with formula_9 as leading coefficient.\nformula_36\nThis results from the expression of the discriminant in terms of the roots\nformula_37\nThis results from the expression in terms of the roots, or of the quasi-homogeneity of the discriminant.\nformula_38\nwhen formula_39 Here, formula_40 denotes the reciprocal polynomial of \"P\"; that is, if formula_41 and formula_42 then\nformula_43\nInvariance under ring homomorphisms.\nLet formula_44 be a homomorphism of commutative rings. Given a polynomial \nformula_45\nin \"R\"[\"x\"], the homomorphism formula_46 acts on \"A\" for producing the polynomial\nformula_47\nin \"S\"[\"x\"].\nThe discriminant is invariant under formula_46 in the following sense. If formula_49 then \nformula_50\nAs the discriminant is defined in terms of a determinant, this property results immediately from the similar property of determinants.\nIf formula_51 then formula_52 may be zero or not. One has, when formula_51\nformula_54\nWhen one is only interested in knowing whether a discriminant is zero (as is generally the case in algebraic geometry), these properties may be summarised as:\nformula_55 if and only if either formula_56 or formula_57\nThis is often interpreted as saying that formula_55 if and only if formula_59 has a multiple root (possibly at infinity).\nProduct of polynomials.\nIf \"R\" = \"PQ\" is a product of polynomials in \"x\", then\nformula_60\nwhere formula_61 denotes the resultant with respect to the variable \"x\", and \"p\" and \"q\" are the respective degrees of \"P\" and \"Q\".\nThis property follows immediately by substituting the expression for the resultant, and the discriminant, in terms of the roots of the respective polynomials.\nHomogeneity.\nThe discriminant is a homogeneous polynomial in the coefficients; it is also a homogeneous polynomial in the roots and thus quasi-homogeneous in the coefficients.\nThe discriminant of a polynomial of degree \"n\" is homogeneous of degree 2\"n\" \u2212 2 in the coefficients. This can be seen in two ways. In terms of the roots-and-leading-term formula, multiplying all the coefficients by \u03bb does not change the roots, but multiplies the leading term by \u03bb. In terms of its expression as a determinant of a (2\"n\" \u2212 1)\u2009\u00d7\u2009(2\"n\" \u2212 1) matrix (the Sylvester matrix) divided by an, the determinant is homogeneous of degree 2\"n\" \u2212 1 in the entries, and dividing by an makes the degree 2\"n\" \u2212 2.\nThe discriminant of a polynomial of degree \"n\" is homogeneous of degree \"n\"(\"n\" \u2212 1) in the roots. This follows from the expression of the discriminant in terms of the roots, which is the product of a constant and formula_62 squared differences of roots.\nThe discriminant of a polynomial of degree \"n\" is quasi-homogeneous of degree \"n\"(\"n\" \u2212 1) in the coefficients, if, for every \"i\", the coefficient of formula_63 is given the weight \"n\" \u2212 \"i\". It is also quasi-homogeneous of the same degree, if, for every \"i\", the coefficient of formula_63 is given the weight \"i\". This is a consequence of the general fact that every polynomial which is homogeneous and symmetric in the roots may be expressed as a quasi-homogeneous polynomial in the elementary symmetric functions of the roots.\nConsider the polynomial\nformula_65\nIt follows from what precedes that the exponents in every monomial formula_66 appearing in the discriminant satisfy the two equations\nformula_67\nand\nformula_68\nand also the equation\nformula_69\nwhich is obtained by subtracting the second equation from the first one multiplied by \"n\".\nThis restricts the possible terms in the discriminant. For the general quadratic polynomial, the discriminant formula_70 is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 2 which has only two there are only two terms, while the general homogeneous polynomial of degree two in three variables has 6 terms. The discriminant of the general cubic polynomial is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 4 in four variables; it has five terms, which is the maximum allowed by the above rules, while the general homogeneous polynomial of degree 4 in 4 variables has 35 terms.\nFor higher degrees, there may be monomials which satisfy above rules and do not appear in the discriminant. The first example is for the quartic polynomial formula_71, in which case the monomial formula_72 satisfies the rules without appearing in the discriminant.\nReal roots.\nIn this section, all polynomials have real coefficients.\nIt has been seen in that the sign of the discriminant provides useful information on the nature of the roots for polynomials of degree 2 and 3. For higher degrees, the information provided by the discriminant is less complete, but still useful. More precisely, for a polynomial of degree \"n\", one has:\nHomogeneous bivariate polynomial.\nLet\nformula_73\nbe a homogeneous polynomial of degree \"n\" in two indeterminates.\nSupposing, for the moment, that formula_74 and formula_9 are both nonzero, one has\nformula_76\nDenoting this quantity by formula_77\none has\nformula_78\nand\nformula_79\nBecause of these properties, the quantity formula_80 is called the \"discriminant\" or the \"homogeneous discriminant\" of \"A\".\nIf formula_74 and formula_9 are permitted to be zero, the polynomials \"A\"(\"x\", 1) and \"A\"(1, \"y\") may have a degree smaller than \"n\". In this case, above formulas and definition remain valid, if the discriminants are computed as if all polynomials would have the degree \"n\". This means that the discriminants must be computed with formula_74 and formula_9 indeterminate, the substitution for them of their actual values being done \"after\" this computation. Equivalently, the formulas of must be used.\nUse in algebraic geometry.\nThe typical use of discriminants in algebraic geometry is for studying plane algebraic curves, and more generally algebraic hypersurfaces. Let \"V\" be such a curve or hypersurface; \"V\" is defined as the zero set of a multivariate polynomial. This polynomial may be considered as a univariate polynomial in one of the indeterminates, with polynomials in the other indeterminates as coefficients. The discriminant with respect to the selected indeterminate defines a hypersurface \"W\" in the space of the other indeterminates. The points of \"W\" are exactly the projection of the points of \"V\" (including the points at infinity), which either are singular or have a tangent hyperplane that is parallel to the axis of the selected indeterminate.\nFor example, let f be a bivariate polynomial in X and Y with real coefficients, so that\u00a0\"f\" \u2009= 0 is the implicit equation of a real plane algebraic curve. Viewing f as a univariate polynomial in Y with coefficients depending on X, then the discriminant is a polynomial in X whose roots are the X-coordinates of the singular points, of the points with a tangent parallel to the Y-axis and of some of the asymptotes parallel to the Y-axis. In other words, the computation of the roots of the Y-discriminant and the X-discriminant allows one to compute all of the remarkable points of the curve, except the inflection points.\nGeneralizations.\nThere are two classes of the concept of discriminant. The first class is the discriminant of an algebraic number field, which, in some cases including quadratic fields, is the discriminant of a polynomial defining the field.\nDiscriminants of the second class arise for problems depending on coefficients, when degenerate instances or singularities of the problem are characterized by the vanishing of a single polynomial in the coefficients. This is the case for the discriminant of a polynomial, which is zero when two roots collapse. Most of the cases, where such a generalized discriminant is defined, are instances of the following.\nLet \"A\" be a homogeneous polynomial in \"n\" indeterminates over a field of characteristic 0, or of a prime characteristic that does not divide the degree of the polynomial. The polynomial \"A\" defines a projective hypersurface, which has singular points if and only the \"n\" partial derivatives of \"A\" have a nontrivial common zero. This is the case if and only if the multivariate resultant of these partial derivatives is zero, and this resultant may be considered as the discriminant of \"A\". However, because of the integer coefficients resulting of the derivation, this multivariate resultant may be divisible by a power of \"n\", and it is better to take, as a discriminant, the primitive part of the resultant, computed with generic coefficients. The restriction on the characteristic is needed because otherwise a common zero of the partial derivative is not necessarily a zero of the polynomial (see Euler's identity for homogeneous polynomials).\nIn the case of a homogeneous bivariate polynomial of degree \"d\", this general discriminant is formula_85 times the discriminant defined in . Several other classical types of discriminants, that are instances of the general definition are described in next sections.\nQuadratic forms.\nA quadratic form is a function over a vector space, which is defined over some basis by a homogeneous polynomial of degree 2:\nformula_86\nor, in matrix form,\nformula_87\nfor the formula_88 symmetric matrix formula_89, the formula_90 row vector formula_91, and the formula_92 column vector formula_93. In characteristic different from 2, the discriminant or determinant of \"Q\" is the determinant of \"A\".\nThe Hessian determinant of \"Q\" is formula_94 times its discriminant. The multivariate resultant of the partial derivatives of \"Q\" is equal to its Hessian determinant. So, the discriminant of a quadratic form is a special case of the above general definition of a discriminant.\nThe discriminant of a quadratic form is invariant under linear changes of variables (that is a change of basis of the vector space on which the quadratic form is defined) in the following sense: a linear change of variables is defined by a nonsingular matrix \"S\", changes the matrix \"A\" into formula_95 and thus multiplies the discriminant by the square of the determinant of \"S\". Thus the discriminant is well defined only up to the multiplication by a square. In other words, the discriminant of a quadratic form over a field \"K\" is an element of \"K\"/(\"K\"\u00d7)2, the quotient of the multiplicative monoid of \"K\" by the subgroup of the nonzero squares (that is, two elements of \"K\" are in the same equivalence class if one is the product of the other by a nonzero square). It follows that over the complex numbers, a discriminant is equivalent to 0 or 1. Over the real numbers, a discriminant is equivalent to \u22121, 0, or 1. Over the rational numbers, a discriminant is equivalent to a unique square-free integer.\nBy a theorem of Jacobi, a quadratic form over a field of characteristic different from 2 can be expressed, after a linear change of variables, in diagonal form as\nformula_96\nMore precisely, a quadratic form may be expressed as a sum\nformula_97\nwhere the \"L\"\"i\" are independent linear forms and n is the number of the variables (some of the \"a\"\"i\" may be zero). Equivalently, for any symmetric matrix \"A\", there is an elementary matrix \"S\" such that formula_98 is a diagonal matrix.\nThen the discriminant is the product of the \"a\"\"i\", which is well-defined as a class in \"K\"/(\"K\"\u00d7)2.\nGeometrically, the discriminant of a quadratic form in three variables is the equation of a quadratic projective curve. The discriminant is zero if and only if the curve is decomposed in lines (possibly over an algebraically closed extension of the field).\nA quadratic form in four variables is the equation of a projective surface. The surface has a singular point if and only its discriminant is zero. In this case, either the surface may be decomposed in planes, or it has a unique singular point, and is a cone or a cylinder. Over the reals, if the discriminant is positive, then the surface either has no real point or has everywhere a negative Gaussian curvature. If the discriminant is negative, the surface has real points, and has a negative Gaussian curvature.\nConic sections.\nA conic section is a plane curve defined by an implicit equation of the form\nformula_99\nwhere \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\", \"e\", \"f\" are real numbers.\nTwo quadratic forms, and thus two discriminants may be associated to a conic section.\nThe first quadratic form is\nformula_100\nIts discriminant is the determinant\nformula_101\nIt is zero if the conic section degenerates into two lines, a double line or a single point.\nThe second discriminant, which is the only one that is considered in many elementary textbooks, is the discriminant of the homogeneous part of degree two of the equation. It is equal to\nformula_102\nand determines the shape of the conic section. If this discriminant is negative, the curve either has no real points, or is an ellipse or a circle, or, if degenerated, is reduced to a single point. If the discriminant is zero, the curve is a parabola, or, if degenerated, a double line or two parallel lines. If the discriminant is positive, the curve is a hyperbola, or, if degenerated, a pair of intersecting lines.\nReal quadric surfaces.\nA real quadric surface in the Euclidean space of dimension three is a surface that may be defined as the zeros of a polynomial of degree two in three variables. As for the conic sections there are two discriminants that may be naturally defined. Both are useful for getting information on the nature of a quadric surface.\nLet formula_103 be a polynomial of degree two in three variables that defines a real quadric surface. The first associated quadratic form, formula_104 depends on four variables, and is obtained by homogenizing \"P\"; that is\nformula_105\nLet us denote its discriminant by formula_106\nThe second quadratic form, formula_107 depends on three variables, and consists of the terms of degree two of \"P\"; that is \nformula_108\nLet us denote its discriminant by formula_109\nIf formula_110 and the surface has real points, it is either a hyperbolic paraboloid or a one-sheet hyperboloid. In both cases, this is a ruled surface that has a negative Gaussian curvature at every point.\nIf formula_111 the surface is either an ellipsoid or a two-sheet hyperboloid or an elliptic paraboloid. In all cases, it has a positive Gaussian curvature at every point.\nIf formula_112 the surface has a singular point, possibly at infinity. If there is only one singular point, the surface is a cylinder or a cone. If there are several singular points the surface consists of two planes, a double plane or a single line.\nWhen formula_113 the sign of formula_114 if not 0, does not provide any useful information, as changing \"P\" into \u2212\"P\" does not change the surface, but changes the sign of formula_109 However, if formula_116 and formula_117 the surface is a paraboloid, which is elliptic or hyperbolic, depending on the sign of formula_106\nDiscriminant of an algebraic number field.\nThe discriminant of an algebraic number field measures the size of the (ring of integers of the) algebraic number field. \nMore specifically, it is proportional to the squared volume of the fundamental domain of the ring of integers, and it regulates which primes are ramified.\nThe discriminant is one of the most basic invariants of a number field, and occurs in several important analytic formulas such as the functional equation of the Dedekind zeta function of \"K\", and the analytic class number formula for \"K\". A theorem of Hermite states that there are only finitely many number fields of bounded discriminant, however determining this quantity is still an open problem, and the subject of current research.\nLet \"K\" be an algebraic number field, and let \"OK\" be its ring of integers. Let \"b\"1, ..., \"bn\" be an integral basis of \"OK\" (i.e. a basis as a Z-module), and let {\u03c31, ..., \u03c3\"n\"} be the set of embeddings of \"K\" into the complex numbers (i.e. injective ring homomorphisms \"K\"\u00a0\u2192\u00a0C). The discriminant of \"K\" is the square of the determinant of the \"n\" by \"n\" matrix \"B\" whose (\"i\",\"j\")-entry is \u03c3\"i\"(\"bj\"). Symbolically,\n formula_119\nThe discriminant of \"K\" can be referred to as the absolute discriminant of \"K\" to distinguish it from the of an extension \"K\"/\"L\" of number fields. The latter is an ideal in the ring of integers of \"L\", and like the absolute discriminant it indicates which primes are ramified in \"K\"/\"L\". It is a generalization of the absolute discriminant allowing for \"L\" to be bigger than Q; in fact, when \"L\"\u00a0=\u00a0Q, the relative discriminant of \"K\"/Q is the principal ideal of Z generated by the absolute discriminant of \"K\".\nFundamental discriminants.\nA specific type of discriminant useful in the study of quadratic fields is the fundamental discriminant. It arises in the theory of integral binary quadratic forms, which are expressions of the form:formula_120\nwhere formula_121, formula_122, and formula_123 are integers. The discriminant of formula_124 is given by:formula_125Not every integer can arise as a discriminant of an integral binary quadratic form. An integer formula_126 is a fundamental discriminant if and only if it meets one of the following criteria:\nThese conditions ensure that every fundamental discriminant corresponds uniquely to a specific type of quadratic form.\nThe first eleven positive fundamental discriminants are:\n 1, 5, 8, 12, 13, 17, 21, 24, 28, 29, 33 (sequence A003658 in the OEIS).\nThe first eleven negative fundamental discriminants are:\n \u22123, \u22124, \u22127, \u22128, \u221211, \u221215, \u221219, \u221220, \u221223, \u221224, \u221231 (sequence A003657 in the OEIS).\nQuadratic number fields.\nA quadratic field is a field extension of the rational numbers formula_134 that has degree 2. The discriminant of a quadratic field plays a role analogous to the discriminant of a quadratic form.\nThere exists a fundamental connection: an integer formula_135 is a fundamental discriminant if and only if:\nFor each fundamental discriminant formula_138, there exists a unique (up to isomorphism) quadratic field with formula_135 as its discriminant. This connects the theory of quadratic forms and the study of quadratic fields.\nPrime factorization.\nFundamental discriminants can also be characterized by their prime factorization. Consider the set formula_140 consisting of formula_141 the prime numbers congruent to 1 modulo 4, and the additive inverses of the prime numbers congruent to 3 modulo 4:formula_142An integer formula_143 is a fundamental discriminant if and only if it is a product of elements of formula_144 that are pairwise coprime.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She won four Tony Awards for her musical comedy performances, and she served as an uncredited choreographer's assistant and specialty dance coach for theater and film. Verdon was a critically acclaimed performer on Broadway in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, having originated many roles in musicals, including Lola in \"Damn Yankees\", the title character in \"Sweet Charity\", and Roxie Hart in \"Chicago\". \nHer second husband was director-choreographer Bob Fosse, with whom she worked on a number of theater and film projects. After Fosse's death, she worked to preserve his legacy.\nEarly life.\nVerdon was born in Culver City, California, the second child of Gertrude Lilian (n\u00e9e Standring) and Joseph William Verdon, who were both British immigrants to the United States by way of Canada. Her brother was William Farrell Verdon, her father was an electrician at MGM Studios, and her mother was a former vaudevillian of the Denishawn dance troupe, as well as a dance teacher.\nAs a toddler, she suffered from rickets, which led to her being called \"Gimpy\" by other children and spent her early years in orthopedic boots and rigid leg braces. At age three, her mother enrolled her in dance classes. Further ballet training strengthened her legs and improved her carriage. \nBy age six, she was dancing on stage. She went on to study multiple dance forms, ranging from tap, jazz, ballroom and flamenco to Balinese. She also studied juggling. At age 11, she appeared as a solo ballerina in the musical romance film \"The King Steps Out\" (1936), directed by Josef von Sternberg and starring Grace Moore and Franchot Tone. She attended Hamilton High School in Los Angeles and studied under ballet enthusiast Ernest Belcher. While in high school, she was cast in a revival of \"Show Boat\".\nIn 1942, Verdon's parents asked her to marry family friend and tabloid reporter James Henaghan after he got her pregnant at 17 years old, and she quit dancing to raise their child. In 1945, she appeared as a dancer in the movie musical \"Blonde From Brooklyn\". After her divorce, she entrusted her son Jimmy to the care of her parents.\nCareer.\nEarly on, Verdon found a job as assistant to choreographer Jack Cole, whose work was respected by both Broadway and Hollywood movie studios. During her five-year employment with Cole, she took small roles in movie musicals as a \"specialty dancer\". She also taught dance to stars such as Jane Russell, Fernando Lamas, Lana Turner, Rita Hayworth, Betty Grable, and Marilyn Monroe. \nVerdon started out on Broadway going from one chorus line to another. Her breakthrough role finally came when choreographer Michael Kidd cast her as the second female lead in Cole Porter's musical \"Can-Can\" (1953), starring French prima donna Lilo. Out-of-town reviewers hailed Verdon's interpretation of Eve in the \"Garden of Eden\" ballet as a performance that upstaged the show's star, who reputedly demanded Verdon's role be cut to only two featured dance numbers. With her role reduced to little more than an ensemble part, Verdon formally announced her intention to quit by the time the show premiered on Broadway. But her opening-night \"Garden of Eden\" performance was so well-received that the audience screamed her name until the startled actress was brought from her dressing room in a towel to take a curtain call. Verdon received a pay increase and her first Tony Award for her performance.\nVerdon's biggest critical and commercial success was her following show, George Abbott's \"Damn Yankees\" (1955), based on the novel \"The Year the Yankees Lost the Pennant.\" The musical ran for 1,019 performances. Verdon won another Tony and went to Hollywood to repeat her role in the 1958 movie version \"Damn Yankees\", singing \"Whatever Lola Wants\". Fosse can be seen partnered with her in the original mambo duet \"Who's Got the Pain\". \nVerdon won another Tony for her performance in the musical \"New Girl in Town\" as a hard-luck girl fleeing from her past as a prostitute. She won her fourth Tony for the murder-mystery musical \"Redhead\", Fosse's Broadway debut as a director/choreographer. In 1960, Fosse and Verdon wed. \nIn 1966, Verdon returned to the stage in the role of Charity in \"Sweet Charity,\" which, like many of her earlier Broadway triumphs, was choreographed and directed by husband Fosse. The show is loosely based on Federico Fellini's screenplay for \"Nights of Cabiria.\" It was followed by a movie version starring Shirley MacLaine as Charity, featuring Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n, Sammy Davis Jr. and Chita Rivera, with Fosse at the helm of his first film as director and choreographer. Verdon helped with the choreography. The numbers include the famed \"Big Spender\", \"Rhythm of Life\", \"If My Friends Could See Me Now\", and \"I'm a Brass Band\". Verdon also traveled to Berlin to help Fosse with \"Cabaret\", the musical film for which he won an Oscar for Best Director.\nAlthough estranged as a couple, Verdon continued to collaborate with Fosse as a performer and a choreographer. In the 1975 Broadway production of the Fosse-directed musical \"Chicago\", Verdon originated the role of murderess Roxie Hart opposite Chita Rivera's Velma Kelly. Although the musical was almost universally panned by critics, who compared it unfavorably to Cabaret, Gwen Verdon was singled out for praise: her performance was \"delectable\" wrote the NY Times theater critic. Verdon also helped out with Fosse's paean to Broadway dancing in the musical \"Dancin\"' (1978), as well as Fosse's autobiographical film \"All That Jazz\" (1979). The helpmate/peer played by Leland Palmer in that film is based on the role Verdon played in Fosse's real life. She also developed a close working relationship with Fosse's romantic partner of six years, Broadway dancer Ann Reinking, working as an instructor for Reinking's musical theatre classes.\nAfter the 1975 stage version of \"Chicago\" Verdon focused on film acting, playing character roles in movies such as \"The Cotton Club\" (1984), \"Cocoon\" (1985), and ' (1988). She collected several Emmy nominations in her guest performances on television shows, including nominations for appearances on \"Magnum, P.I.\" (1988), \"Dream On\" (1993) and ' (1993). Her screen roles continued in prestigious films, such as the mother of Mia Farrow's title character in the Woody Allen movie \"Alice\" (1990) and the eccentric Aunt Ruth in \"Marvin's Room\" (1996), co-starring Meryl Streep, Diane Keaton, and Leonardo DiCaprio. Other film roles include Alora in \"Walking Across Egypt\" (1999) and \"Bruno\" (2000). \nVerdon served as artistic consultant to the 1999 Broadway musical \"Fosse\", reprising classic Fosse choreography without any formal narrative; the revue was conceived and co-directed by Richard Maltby Jr. and Ann Reinking. (Verdon's daughter with Fosse, performer Nicole Fosse received a \"special thanks\" credit.) With glowing reviews, \"Fosse\" ran for 1000 performances on Broadway and collected four Tonys, including the Tony Award for Best Musical.\nPersonal life.\nVerdon was married twice and had two children. She married tabloid reporter James Archibald Henaghan in 1942. They had a son, Jim, the following year and divorced in 1947. In 1960, Verdon married choreographer Bob Fosse. They had a daughter, Nicole, in 1963. Fosse's extramarital affairs put a strain on their marriage, and by 1971, Verdon and Fosse were separated, but never divorced. She was involved in relationships with actor Scott Brady and actor Jerry Lanning, son of Roberta Sherwood. Verdon was with Fosse when he suffered a fatal heart attack at the Willard Hotel in Washington, D.C., in September 1987.\nVerdon was a cat fancier, having up to six cats at one time, with the pets carrying names such as \"Feets Fosse\", \"Junie Moon\", and \"Tidbits Tumbler Fosse\".\nVerdon was a mental health-care advocate; later in life, she openly spoke about the positive effects of mental-health counseling. Along with teaching dance as a form of therapy, she sat on the board of directors for the New York Postgraduate Center for Mental Health, and actively raised funds to support mental health-care research.\nShe was also stated to be a big fan of baseball, and went to day games with her scout son.\nDeath and legacy.\nVerdon died from a heart attack on October 18, 2000, aged 75, at her daughter's home in Woodstock, Vermont. Later that night, at 8 pm, all marquee lights on Broadway were dimmed in a tribute to Verdon.\nPopular culture.\n\"Fosse/Verdon\" is an 8-part American miniseries starring Sam Rockwell as Fosse and Michelle Williams as Verdon. The series, which tells the story of the couple's troubled personal and professional relationship, is based on the biography \"Fosse\" by Sam Wasson. It premiered in eight parts on April 9, 2019, on FX. At the 71st Primetime Emmy Awards, \"Fosse/Verdon\" received seventeen nominations, including Outstanding Limited Series and acting nominations for Rockwell, Williams, and Margaret Qualley (as Ann Reinking). Williams won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Movie.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "55611", "revid": "49310748", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55611", "title": "Alexandroff extension", "text": "Way to extend a non-compact topological space\nIn the mathematical field of topology, the Alexandroff extension is a way to extend a noncompact topological space by adjoining a single point in such a way that the resulting space is compact. It is named after the Russian mathematician Pavel Alexandroff.\nMore precisely, let \"X\" be a topological space. Then the Alexandroff extension of \"X\" is a certain compact space \"X\"* together with an open embedding \"c\"\u00a0:\u00a0\"X\"\u00a0\u2192\u00a0\"X\"* such that the complement of \"X\" in \"X\"* consists of a single point, typically denoted \u221e. The map \"c\" is a Hausdorff compactification if and only if \"X\" is a locally compact, noncompact Hausdorff space. For such spaces the Alexandroff extension is called the one-point compactification or Alexandroff compactification. The advantages of the Alexandroff compactification lie in its simple, often geometrically meaningful structure and the fact that it is in a precise sense minimal among all compactifications; the disadvantage lies in the fact that it only gives a Hausdorff compactification on the class of locally compact, noncompact Hausdorff spaces, unlike the Stone\u2013\u010cech compactification which exists for any topological space (but provides an embedding exactly for Tychonoff spaces).\nExample: inverse stereographic projection.\nA geometrically appealing example of one-point compactification is given by the inverse stereographic projection. Recall that the stereographic projection \"S\" gives an explicit homeomorphism from the unit sphere minus the north pole (0,0,1) to the Euclidean plane. The inverse stereographic projection formula_1 is an open, dense embedding into a compact Hausdorff space obtained by adjoining the additional point formula_2. Under the stereographic projection latitudinal circles formula_3 get mapped to planar circles formula_4. It follows that the deleted neighborhood basis of formula_5 given by the punctured spherical caps formula_6 corresponds to the complements of closed planar disks formula_7. More qualitatively, a neighborhood basis at formula_8 is furnished by the sets formula_9 as \"K\" ranges through the compact subsets of formula_10. This example already contains the key concepts of the general case.\nMotivation.\nLet formula_11 be an embedding from a topological space \"X\" to a compact Hausdorff topological space \"Y\", with dense image and one-point remainder formula_12. Then \"c\"(\"X\") is open in a compact Hausdorff space so is locally compact Hausdorff, hence its homeomorphic preimage \"X\" is also locally compact Hausdorff. Moreover, if \"X\" were compact then \"c\"(\"X\") would be closed in \"Y\" and hence not dense. Thus a space can only admit a Hausdorff one-point compactification if it is locally compact, noncompact and Hausdorff. Moreover, in such a one-point compactification the image of a neighborhood basis for \"x\" in \"X\" gives a neighborhood basis for \"c\"(\"x\") in \"c\"(\"X\"), and\u2014because a subset of a compact Hausdorff space is compact if and only if it is closed\u2014the open neighborhoods of formula_8 must be all sets obtained by adjoining formula_8 to the image under \"c\" of a subset of \"X\" with compact complement.\nThe Alexandroff extension.\nLet formula_15 be a topological space. Put formula_16 and topologize formula_17 by taking as open sets all the open sets in \"X\" together with all sets of the form formula_18 where \"C\" is closed and compact in \"X\". Here, formula_19 denotes the complement of formula_20 in formula_21 Note that formula_22 is an open neighborhood of formula_23 and thus any open cover of formula_24 will contain all except a compact subset formula_25 of formula_26 implying that formula_17 is compact .\nThe space formula_17 is called the Alexandroff extension of \"X\" (Willard, 19A). Sometimes the same name is used for the inclusion map formula_29\nThe properties below follow from the above discussion:\nThe one-point compactification.\nIn particular, the Alexandroff extension formula_35 is a Hausdorff compactification of \"X\" if and only if \"X\" is Hausdorff, noncompact and locally compact. In this case it is called the one-point compactification or Alexandroff compactification of \"X\".\nRecall from the above discussion that any Hausdorff compactification with one point remainder is necessarily (isomorphic to) the Alexandroff compactification. In particular, if formula_15 is a compact Hausdorff space and formula_37 is a limit point of formula_15 (i.e. not an isolated point of formula_15), formula_15 is the Alexandroff compactification of formula_41.\nLet \"X\" be any noncompact Tychonoff space. Under the natural partial ordering on the set formula_42 of equivalence classes of compactifications, any minimal element is equivalent to the Alexandroff extension (Engelking, Theorem 3.5.12). It follows that a noncompact Tychonoff space admits a minimal compactification if and only if it is locally compact.\nNon-Hausdorff one-point compactifications.\nLet formula_43 be an arbitrary noncompact topological space. One may want to determine all the compactifications (not necessarily Hausdorff) of formula_15 obtained by adding a single point, which could also be called \"one-point compactifications\" in this context. \nSo one wants to determine all possible ways to give formula_45 a compact topology such that formula_15 is dense in it and the subspace topology on formula_15 induced from formula_17 is the same as the original topology. The last compatibility condition on the topology automatically implies that formula_15 is dense in formula_17, because formula_15 is not compact, so it cannot be closed in a compact space.\nAlso, it is a fact that the inclusion map formula_52 is necessarily an open embedding, that is, formula_15 must be open in formula_17 and the topology on formula_17 must contain every member\nof formula_56.\nSo the topology on formula_17 is determined by the neighbourhoods of formula_8. Any neighborhood of formula_8 is necessarily the complement in formula_17 of a closed compact subset of formula_15, as previously discussed.\nThe topologies on formula_17 that make it a compactification of formula_15 are as follows:\nFurther examples.\nAs a functor.\nThe Alexandroff extension can be viewed as a functor from the category of topological spaces with proper continuous maps as morphisms to the category whose objects are continuous maps formula_101 and for which the morphisms from formula_102 to formula_103 are pairs of continuous maps formula_104 such that formula_105. In particular, homeomorphic spaces have isomorphic Alexandroff extensions. The latter is the arrow category of topological spaces, often constructed as category of functors from interval category formula_106, where interval category is the category with 2 objects connected by single arrow. \nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The traditional nurse uniform consists of a dress, apron and cap. It has existed in many variants, but the basic style has remained recognizable.\nHistory.\nThe first nurse uniforms were derived from the nun's habit. Before the 19th century, nuns took care of sick and injured people so it was obvious that trained lay nurses might copy the nun's habit as they have adopted ranks like \"Sister\". One of Florence Nightingale's first students (Miss van Rensselaer) designed the original uniform for the students at Miss Nightingale's school of nursing. Before the 1940s minor changes occurred in the uniform. The clothing consisted of a mainly blue outfit. Hospitals were free to determine the style of the nurse uniform, including the nurse's cap which exists in many variants.\nIn Britain, the national uniform (or simply \"national\") was designed with the advent of the National Health Service (NHS) in 1948, and the Newcastle dress. From the 1960s open necks began to appear. In the 1970s, white disposable paper caps replaced cotton ones; in the 1980s, plastic aprons displaced the traditional ones and outerwear began to disappear. From the 1990s, scrubs became popular in Britain, having first appeared in the USA; however, some nurses in Britain continue to wear dresses, although some NHS trusts have removed them in favour of scrubs as in many other countries.\nStandard nurse's uniform.\nHistorically, a typical nurse uniform consisted of a dress, pinafore apron and nurse's cap. In some hospitals, however, student nurses also wore a nursing pin, or the pinafore apron may have been replaced by a cobbler style apron. This type of nurse's dress continues to be worn in many countries.\nTraditional uniforms remain common in many countries, but in Western Europe and North America, the so-called \"scrubs\" or tunics have become more popular. \"Scrub dress\" is a simpler type of uniform, and is almost always worn in operating rooms and emergency rooms.\nNurses have a variety of roles in the 21st century and therefore have a variety of \"uniforms\". Nurse scientists may wear a lab coat, while nurse executives may wear a suit. The \"uniform\" will vary by country and role.\nAlternative nurse uniforms.\nSince the late 1980s, there has been a move towards alternative designs of nursing uniforms in some countries. Newer style nurse's uniform in the United Kingdom consists of either:\nMale nursing uniform.\nIn some countries the nurse's uniform is now gender neutral. When this is not the case, male nurses wear a different uniform to their female counterparts. In the UK, male nurses often wear a white tunic with epaulettes in a color or quantity that represents their year of training or grade. However, in many trusts the white uniform is now obsolete and uniforms are non-gender specific.\nNo Uniform\nIn some settings, for example in psychiatric inpatient units in the UK, it is common for mental health and learning disorder nurses to not wear a formal uniform.\nNurse uniforms versus scrubs.\nBeginning in the 1990s, and until the present time, the traditional nurse uniforms have been replaced with the \"new\" scrub dress in some countries. Most hospitals in the US and Europe argue that the scrub uniform is easier to clean than the old nurse uniforms. The nurses who wear the uniforms are divided into two camps:\nIn many parts of the world, nurses continue to wear a uniform consisting of a dress, pinafore and cap. The traditional white uniform for male nursing staff is now going out of fashion, except for student nurses. A tunic of either the dental surgeon style or a V-neck with a collar is very often used. The colours vary with grade, area of work, and hospital; however, the male equivalent of a sister (that is, charge nurse) tend to be shades of blue or dark green: often, this is the only colour to be recognised by the public as signifying a person in authority.\nNursing jewellery.\nNurses were actively discouraged from wearing jewellery which might distract from their purpose and get caught on patient skin during care activity. A fob watch or \"pendant\" watch is considered synonymous with nursing. The fob watch frees the nurses' hands for client care and prevents the wrist watch becoming a vector for disease. Watches are sometimes given as a token rite-of-passage gift from parents to young nurses, who are making the transition into nurses' quarters and living away from home for the first time.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They are common in primary and secondary schools in various countries and are generally widespread in Africa, Asia, Oceania, the British Isles and much of the Americas, but are not common in the United States, Canada, and most countries in continental Europe.\nAn example of a uniform would be requiring button-up shirts, trousers for boys, and blouses and pleated skirts for girls, with both wearing blazers. A uniform can even be as simple as requiring collared shirts, or restricting colour choices and limiting items students are allowed to wear.\nUniform.\nAlthough often used interchangeably, there is an important difference between dress codes and school uniforms: according to scholars such as Nathan Joseph, clothing can only be considered a uniform when it \"(a) serves as a group emblem, (b) certifies an institution's legitimacy by revealing individual's relative positions and (c) suppresses individuality.\"\nConversely, a dress code is much less restrictive, and focuses \"on promoting modesty and discouraging anti-social fashion statements\", according to Marian Wilde. Examples of a dress code would be not allowing ripped clothing, no logos or limiting the amount of skin that can be shown.\nHistory.\nIt is difficult to trace the origins of the uniform as there is no comprehensive written history, but rather a variety of known influences. School uniforms are believed to be a practice which dates to the 16th century in the United Kingdom. It is believed that the Christ's Hospital School in England in 1552 was the first school to use a school uniform. Students were given a uniform that most notably consisted of a long blue coat and yellow, knee-high socks. An almost identical uniform is still worn by students attending the school today. The earliest documented proof of institutionalized use of a standard academic dress dates back to 1222 when the then Archbishop of Canterbury ordered the wearing of the cappa clausa. This monastic and academic practice evolved into collegiate uniforms in England, particularly in charity schools where uniform dress was often provided for poor children. Universities, primary schools and secondary schools used uniforms as a marker of class and status. Although school uniforms can often be considered conservative and old-fashioned, uniforms in recent years have changed as societal dress codes have changed.\nContemporary.\nIn the United States, a movement toward using uniforms in state schools began when Bill Clinton addressed it in the 1996 State of the Union, saying: \"If it means that teenagers will stop killing each other over designer jackets, then our public schools should be able to require their students to wear uniforms.\" As of 1998 approximately 25% of all U.S. public elementary, middle and junior high schools had adopted a uniform policy or were considering a policy, and two-thirds were implemented between 1995 and 1997. New York City's then-new schools chancellor, Rudy Crew, made it clear that he would not follow Clinton's idea.\nThere is an abundance of theories and empirical studies looking at school uniforms, making statements about their effectiveness. These theories and studies elaborate on the benefits and also the shortcomings of uniform policies. The issue of nature vs. nurture comes into play, as uniforms affect the perceptions of masculinity and femininity, over-simplify issues of gender classification, and attempt to suppress students' sexuality. Uniforms bring a variety of pros, cons, and major legal implications and controversies.\nThere are two main empirical findings that are most often cited in the political rhetoric surrounding the uniform debate. One of these, the case study of the Long Beach Unified School District, is most often cited in support of school uniforms and their effectiveness whereas \"Effects of Student Uniforms on Attendance, Behavior Problems, Substance Use, and Academic Achievement\" is the most frequently cited research in opposition to the implementation of school uniform policies.\nEffects of uniforms on students.\nThe case study of the Long Beach Unified School District was the study of the first large, urban school in the United States to implement a uniform policy. In 1994, mandatory school uniforms were implemented for the districts elementary and middle schools as a strategy to address the students' behavior issues. The district simultaneously implemented a longitudinal study to research the effects of the uniforms on student behavior. The study attributed favorable student behavioral changes and a significant drop in school discipline issues to the mandatory uniform policy. Wearing school uniforms was associated with fewer absences and truancies and fewer referrals to the office for behavior problems. Suspensions and expulsions were reduced by 28% (elementary) and 36% (middle school), crime and vandalism by 74% (elementary) and 18% (middle school). However the school district also added other security measures such as security guards, \nand metal detectors so the success cannot be solely attributed to the uniforms. The district later removed the uniforms. \nOther research found that uniforms were not an effective deterrent to decrease truancy, did not decrease behavior problems, decrease substance use, and in fact may be associated with poorer student achievement relative to students not required to wear school uniforms.\nBrunsma stated that despite the inconclusiveness of the effects of uniforms, they became more common because \"this is an issue of children's rights, of social control, and one related to increasing racial, class and gender inequalities in our schools.\"\nLaws and rulings.\nAs uniforms have become more normalised, there have also been an increasing number of lawsuits brought against school districts. According to David Brunsma, one in four public elementary schools and one in eight public middle and high schools in the United States have policies dictating what a student wears to school. The school code within states' constitutions typically asserts that it allows the board of school directors to make reasonable rules and regulations as they see fit in managing the school's affairs. As of 2025, there are currently 22 states that allow school districts to mandate school uniforms. The constitutional objections usually brought upon school districts tend to fall into one of the following two categories: (1) a violation of the students' First Amendment right to free expression (2) a violation of parents' right to raise their children without government interference. Although up until this point, The Supreme Court has not ruled on a case involving school uniforms directly, in the 1968 decision Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, the Court ruled that upon entering school, students do not shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech.\nInternationally, there are differing views of school uniforms. In the Australian state of Queensland, Ombudsman Fred Albietz ruled in 1998 that state schools may not require uniforms. In the Philippines, the Department of Education abolished the requirement of school uniforms in public schools. In England and Wales, technically a state school may not permanently exclude students for \"breaching school uniform policy\", under a policy promulgated by the Department for Children, Schools and Families but students not wearing the correct uniform are asked to go home and change. In Scotland, some local councils (that have responsibility for delivering state education) do not insist on students wearing a uniform as a precondition to attending and taking part in curricular activities. Turkey abolished mandatory uniforms in 2010.\nExamples of lawsuits in the United States.\n\"Canady v. Bossier Parish School Board\".\nIn the \"Canady v. Bossier Parish School Board\" lawsuit in 2000, a Louisiana district court ruled in favour of the school board because it did not see how the free speech rights of the students were being violated due to the school board's uniform policy. Even though the plaintiff appealed the decision, the Fifth Circuit Court also ruled in favour of the school board after implementing a four-step system that is still used today. Firstly, a school board has to have the right to set up a policy. Secondly, the policy must be determined to support a fundamental interest of the board as a whole. Thirdly, the guidelines cannot have been set for the purpose of censorship. Finally, the limits on student expression cannot be greater than the interest of the board. As long as these four policies are in place, then no constitutional violation can be claimed.\n\"Littlefield v. Forney Independent School District\".\nIn the Forney Independent School District of Forney, Texas in 2001, the school board decided to implement a school uniform policy allowing the students to wear a polo shirt, oxford shirt or blouse in four possible colours, and blue or khaki trousers or shirts, a skirt or jumper. While there was some flexibility with shoes, certain types were prohibited along with any sort of baggy clothes. The parents of the Littlefield family requested that their son be exempt from the policy, but were denied. In response, the Littlefields filed a lawsuit against the school district, under the pretenses that this uniform mandate infringed on their rights as parents to control how they brought up their children and their education. They even went as far as to cite an infringement on religious freedom, claiming that opting out of the uniforms on the grounds of religion allowed the school to rank the validity of certain religions. Before trial, the District Court dismissed the case, so the family appealed. Ultimately, the Fifth Circuit Court ruled that the students' rights were not being violated even though the claims presented were valid. They ruled that school rules derived from the education would override the parents' right to control their children's upbringing in this specific situation. As far as the religious freedom violation accusations, the court ruled that the policy did not have a religious goal, and thus did not infringe on religious freedom rights.\n\"Jacobs v. Clark County School District\".\nIn 2003, Liberty High School, a school of the Clark County School District in Henderson, Nevada, implemented a uniform policy of khakis and red, white or blue polo shirts. A junior by the name of Kimberly Jacobs was suspended a total of five times because she wore a religious shirt to school and got cited for uniform violations. Her family sued the Clark County School District under the claims that her First Amendment rights were being infringed upon and that the uniform policy was causing students to be deprived of due process. The plaintiff's requests were for injunctive relief, the expunging of suspensions from Jacob's school record and awarding of damages. The injunction was granted to the family meaning that the school could no longer discipline her for breaking the uniform policy. At this ruling, the school district appealed. The next court ruled on the side of the school district as it determined that the uniform policy was in fact neutral and constitutional, and it dismissed the claims of the plaintiff.\n\"Frudden v. Washoe County School District\".\nIn 2011, a Nevada public elementary school of the Washoe County School District decided to add the school's motto, \"Tomorrow's Leaders\" embroidered in small letters on the shirt. In response, Mary and John Frudden, parents of a student sued the school district on the basis of it violating the First Amendment. The court ultimately dismissed the case filed by the Fruddens over the uniforms. However, the family appealed, and two years later, a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard the case. The court ruled to reverse the previous decision of dismissing the case, and also questioned the apparent policy for students that were part of a nationally recognised group such as Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts who were able to wear the uniforms in place of the school ones on regular meeting days. The 9th circuit panel ruled that the school had not provided enough evidence for why it instituted this policy, and that the family was never given a chance to argue.\n\"Peltier v. Charter Day School\".\nIn \"Peltier v. Charter Day School\" (2022), the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held that a North Carolina charter school's skirts-only requirement for girls violated the Equal Protection Clause and that Title IX applies to sex-based school dress codes.\nSocial implications of school uniforms on gender.\nPerceptions of masculinity and femininity.\nOne of the criticisms of uniforms is that it imposes standards of masculinity and femininity from a young age. Uniforms are considered a form of discipline that schools use to control student behavior and often promote conventional gendered dress.\nBoys often are required to wear trousers, belts, and closed-toe shoes and have their shirts tucked in at all times. They are also often required to have their hair cut short. Some critics allege that this uniform is associated with the dress of a professional business man, which, they claim, gives boys at a young age the impression that masculinity is gained through business success.\nFor girls, many uniforms promote femininity by requiring girls to wear skirts. Skirts are seen by some critics as a symbol of femininity because they restrict movement and force certain ways of sitting and playing. Uniforms that include an apron for girls may suggest that the appropriate feminine societal role is a primarily domestic one. Some girls' school uniforms have been criticized as having an uncomfortable design, which prevents girls from freedom of movement and exposes girls to cold during winter.\nSchool uniforms are embedded with gender symbolism. Schools that require students to wear a formal uniform almost universally provide trousers for boys and skirts or dresses for girls. Skirts differentiate the female from the male, thereby confirming traditional gender identities for students who must wear the correct attire corresponding to their sex. Skirts and dresses demand a particular type of feminine gender performance, whereas trousers demand a particular masculine gender performance. By forcing students to wear attire that corresponds with their sex inherently assigns the ways a student must perform their gender. This causes controversy when a student does not want to identify with a gender that does not align with their sex. There are rarely guidelines that allow for students to dress according to their performed gender, but almost always according to their sex assigned at birth.\nSexualization of girls.\nAround middle or junior school, students begin going through puberty. Uniforms can be seen as a way to restrict the sexualization of girls by taking the focus away from sexuality and focus it on academics in a school setting for girls.\nSometimes the desire to prevent overtly sexualized clothing through uniforms can fail. As an example, miniskirts have been very popular in Japan, where they are common parts of school uniforms and came to be worn within the Kogal culture.\n\"The pleasure our culture derives from gazing at girls who look feminine conflicts with girls' freedom to run around unselfconsciously and to develop their gross motor talents as boys are encouraged to do\" (Collins et al. 1996, p. 170). Schoolgirl uniforms are used in costumes in the context of \"Sexy Schoolgirl\" and are sold on costume sites year round. The idea of the female school uniform has become sexual and in Britain a new survey from Plan International UK found that a third of girls have been sexually harassed while wearing their school uniform. School uniforms can encourage harassment as children, as some cultures can define the \"schoolgirl look\" as sexual. Children as young as 8 years old report being victims of, or witnesses to, harassment. Two-thirds of the children questioned in the survey said they have experienced \"unwanted sexual attention\" in public, and 35 percent said they have been touched, groped or grabbed without their consent. These experiences teach girls that being harassed by men is just a part of growing up. The perception of schoolgirl uniforms allows for men to harass girls at a young age, causing girls to self-objectify their bodies from the beginning of their schooling experience.\nControversies.\nGeneral.\nIn some cultures, the topic of school uniforms has sparked a multitude of controversies and debates over the years. Debates concerning the constitutionality and economic feasibility of uniforms also contribute to the controversy.\nIn the United States, the implementation of school uniforms began following ten years of research indicating the effectiveness of private schools. Some state-school reformers cited this research to support policies linked to private and Catholic school success. Some public-school administrators hence began implementing uniform policies to improve the overall school environment and academic achievement of the students. This is based on the assumption that uniforms are the direct cause of behavioral and academic outcome changes. However, within the Catholic school literature, school uniforms have never been acknowledged as a primary factor in producing a Catholic school effect.\nAnother area of controversy regarding school uniform and dress code policies revolve around the issue of gender. Nowadays, more teenagers are more frequently \"dressing to articulate, or confound gender identity and sexual orientation\", which brings about \"responses from school officials that ranged from indifferences to applause to bans\". \nPositives.\nAdvocates of uniforms have proposed several reasons supporting their implementation and claiming their success in schools. Advocates believe that uniforms affect student safety by decreasing student victimization, gang activity, and fights. There has been no concrete evidence of this, and studies by Ohio State University and others showed that uniforms did not increase test scores, grades, or focus. However, attendance increased by less than half of a day. The students felt even less of a sense of belonging at a school with uniforms.\nKathleen Wade conducted an experiment to see if bullying and gang presence was higher in uniform or non-uniform schools. The research was done with multiple schools where she gave a questionnaire to both students and faculty to see if there was a significant difference. Her results showed that bullying and gang presence significantly decreases with students wearing school uniforms.\nFor example, in the first year of the mandatory uniform policy in Long Beach, California, officials reported that fighting in schools decreased by more than 50%, assault and battery by 34%, sex offenses by 74%, and robbery by 66%. However the district also added other safety measures like security guards so the success cannot be attributed to the uniforms solely. \nAdvocates also believe that uniforms increase student learning and positive attitudes toward school through:\nCurrently, pros of school uniforms center around how uniforms affect school environments. Advocates say that uniforms may create a safe learning environment for students to help them focus on school work and can lead them to great academic accomplishments. Students who wear school uniforms may not feel anxious or nervous about peer pressure in buying new clothes to fit in or being teased by other classmates. Proponents have found a significant positive impact on school climate, safety, and students' self-perception from the implementation of uniforms.\nHowever, though modern studies and tests prove uniforms did not increase test scores, behavior, bullying, focus and attendance barely increased.\nNegatives.\nOpponents of school uniforms have argued their ineffectiveness using a variety of justifications, many of which have research supporting them. Some of the cons to school uniforms include the following legal, financial, and effectiveness concerns. \nThe primary concern with school uniforms or strict dress codes is that they may limit the students' freedom of expression and religion. Clothing is viewed as a means of expression \u2013 mandating that all students wear the same clothes or limiting what they can wear may disrupt their sense of individuality. Uniforms also necessitate that students cannot wear the latest trends or clothes that, according to schools, may disrupt the learning environment. However, broadly speaking, uniform policies and dress codes usually make exceptions for religious attire. In the U.S., the Constitution and most states protect the students' right to wear religious attire.\nAnother negative aspect of school uniforms is that the policy can be sexist. Boys and girls are often not disciplined in the same ways. Girls are more commonly disciplined for certain articles of clothing that are prohibited because they \"distract\" boys. In some cases, transgender students have been sent home for wearing clothing different from what is expected of their legal sex, while others have been excluded from yearbooks.\nUniforms also generally restrict freedom of movement and comfort, especially for girls. In a study conducted at an Australian independent private school, it was found that the uniform for boys, a blazer was too hot/cold and uncomfortable. When playing and moving around, the school tie was a choking hazard, and their trousers could not stretch. For girls, the light coloured cotton school dress was restrictive, see-through, hot, uncomfortable, and impractical. Furthermore, the stockings were often cold, grey woollen kilt was too heavy and restricted movement. In summer, the dress/skirt could also cause modesty issues (e.g. hard to swing on monkey bars/run around while keeping their privacy) and discourage them from being active.\nResearch on how school uniforms and school dress codes influence the student can be inconclusive. \"In the U.S., over half of public schools have a dress code, which frequently outline gender-specific policies.\"\nStudents that do not wear uniforms can be just as successful as students who do wear school uniforms. The amount of effort and participation a student does during class determines their academic success, regardless of what they are wearing. Students who wear school uniforms does not grant them academic achievement.\nAccording to Marian Wilde, additional opponent arguments include that school uniforms:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The speeches are all related to the discovery, investigation, and suppression of the Catilinarian conspiracy, a plot that year to overthrow the republic. All of the speeches in the form available today were published, probably around 60, as part of Cicero's attempt to justify his actions during the consulship; whether they are accurate reflections of the original speeches in 63 is debated.\nThe first speech was given in the senate, where Cicero accused a senator, Catiline, of leading a plot to overthrow the republic; in response, Catiline withdrew from the city and joined an uprising in Etruria. The next two speeches were given before the people, with Cicero justifying his actions as well as relating further news of the conspiracy in Rome itself and the arrest of four conspirators. The fourth speech, supposedly delivered before the Senate, was an intervention in an on-going debate as to the fate of the urban conspirators; Cicero argued in favour of their illegal execution without trial.\nSome modern historians suggest that Catiline was a more complex character than Cicero's writings declare, and that Cicero was heavily influenced by a desire to establish a lasting reputation as a great Roman patriot and statesman. The Catilinarian orations, along with Sallust's monograph \"Bellum Catilinae\", make the conspiracy one of the best-documented events from the ancient world; for centuries after their delivery, the Catilinarians were praised as model speeches and taught as part of the standard Latin rhetorical curriculum.\nBackground.\nThe Catilinarian conspiracy was a plot by the patrician senator Lucius Sergius Catilina (known in English as Catiline) to overthrow the Roman republic. He started this plot in 63\u00a0BC after being repulsed at elections for consul for the third time, after failing to be elected to the consulships of 65, 63, and 62\u00a0BC. The conspirators included various disaffected groups. The aristocrats who joined were largely men who were similarly unsuccessful in elections for high office or were otherwise bankrupt. They were joined by many disaffected Italian farmers \u2013 concentrated in Etruria \u2013 in two broad groups: farmers dispossessed by Sulla's proscriptions or colonisation programmes and Sulla's landed veterans who had fallen into debt after poor harvests.\nThe first indications of a plot in 63\u00a0BC were in autumn, handed over by Marcus Licinius Crassus on 18 or 19 October. Crassus' letters were corroborated by reports of armed men gathering in support of the conspiracy. In response, the senate passed a decree declaring a (a state of emergency) and, after receipt of the reports of armed men gathering in Etruria, carried the instructing the consuls to do whatever it took to respond to the crisis. By 27 October, the senate had received reports that Gaius Manlius, a former centurion and leader of an army there, had taken up arms near Faesulae. \nCatiline remained in the city. While named in the anonymous letters sent to Crassus, this was insufficient evidence for incrimination. But after messages from Etruria connected him directly to the uprising, he was indicted under the (public violence) in early November. The conspirators met, probably on 6 November, and found two volunteers to make an attempt on Cicero's life. After the attempts on Cicero's life failed on 7 November 63\u00a0BC, he assembled the senate and delivered the First Catilinarian, revealing Catiline's involvement in the plot; Catiline promptly left the city and joined Manlius' men in Etruria shortly thereafter.\nAt this time, Cicero then discovered a plot led by one of the sitting praetors, to bring in the Allobroges, a Gallic tribe, to support the Catilinarians. Using the Allobroges' envoys as double agents, Cicero used them to identify conspirators in the city. After intercepting incriminating letters between the conspirators and the Allobroges, five conspirators were arrested on 2 or 3 December. With the Gallic envoys divulging all they knew and confessions from the five men, there was no doubt of their guilt. After an attempt to rescue the five men from house arrest, the senate debated their fate on 5 December. After a prolonged debate, the Senate, after momentarily being convinced to sentence the men to life imprisonment without trial by Julius Caesar, advised Cicero to have the urban conspirators summarily executed. After the execution of the urban conspirators, most of Catiline's forces melted away; Catiline was eventually defeated and killed in early January 62\u00a0BC at the Battle of Pistoria.\nAt the close of the consular year, Cicero's valedictory speech was vetoed by two tribunes of the plebs. One of the tribunes, Quintus Caecilius Metellus Nepos, also unsuccessfully sought to have Cicero prosecuted for executing the conspirators without a trial. Although popular among large portions of the people for having taken decisive action to avoid civil war and suppress the coup attempt, Cicero's legal position came under attack in the coming years. In response, Cicero attempted to shore up his reputation and justify his actions by publishing his consular speeches: the Catilinarian orations were published after some editing in 60\u00a0BC as part of this effort.\nFirst Catilinarian.\nThe First Catilinarian is the most famous speech in Latin literature. Its first sentence in particular is carefully crafted so as to have its form support its content. In consequence, it is still widely remembered and used after more than 2000 years:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Verse translation/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Screen reader-only/styles.css\" /&gt;Translation:\nAlso remembered is the famous exasperated exclamation, \"O tempora, o mores!\", used as an exclamation of outrage or indignation as to the state of the republic in Cicero's days.\nStructure and context.\nThe First Catilinarian is a denunciation of Catiline, delivered before the Senate in the Temple of Jupiter Stator on 7 or 8 November 63\u00a0BC. The Senate met to discuss an attempt on Cicero's life. Whether the speech is entirely historical is not entirely clear: the Second Catilinarian depicts Cicero's first speech as a simple interrogatory rather than the extended denunciation that survives. Unlike the other speeches, most of the speech is directed to Catiline personally with concluding remarks addressed to the Senate.\nCategorisation of the speech into one of the genres of ancient rhetoric is difficult. The denunciatory aspects of the speech are couched in the framework of a senatorial address while also largely being delivered to Catiline's person. Scholars disagree as to whether it should be seen as a speech in the genre of the law courts (forensic or prosecutorial) or otherwise in the genre of senatorial rhetoric (deliberative). This difficulty may be due to its original extemporaneous nature, delivered not as part of a structured meeting but rather on Catiline's arrival to the senate.\nThe oration's arguments, somewhat cloudy and meandering, are intended more to influence senatorial opinion than argue in favour of any specific course of action or actually advise Catiline. Cicero, in a letter, later described it as a farewell; Berry, in \"Cicero's Catilinarians\", argues that Cicero had to dress up inaction since, within the bounds of the law, he had limited authority to act against Catiline proactively. A more retrospective interpretation of how it would have played c.\u200960\u00a0BC would instead emphasise how Cicero chose to act slowly and deliberatively rather than, as alleged by his political enemies, cruelly and autocratically.\nContent.\nCicero starts the speech by informing Catiline that the conspiracy is revealed and that Cicero would be within his rights as consul and justified by precedent to have Catiline killed as a threat to the state. Cicero then connects Catiline to the rebels in Etruria, against which the Senate had already mobilised men; Cicero also disclaims any intention to have Catiline killed since it would be controversial, something possibly inserted in 60\u00a0BC to paint Cicero as merciful and rebut allegations of cruelty. Cicero then describes at length the conspiracy before urging Catiline to leave the city with his followers to take command of the Etrurian rebels, something which Cicero asserts Catiline was to do shortly regardless. Catiline likely asked whether Cicero's advice was a command for him to go into exile\u2014the power to exile citizens, , was within consular authority\u2014but Cicero in the speech insists that he is merely advising Catiline to leave.\nInsisting that Catiline is not detained by any business in Rome due to his poor reputation, Cicero then engages in invective, indirectly accusing Catiline of a variety of sexual crimes, imminent bankruptcy, and past plots against the state. Drawing attention to how other senators moved away from Catiline when he entered the senate, Cicero argues then that no formal senatorial vote on Catiline's exile\u2014which Catiline demanded\u2014was necessary due to the senate's obvious displeasure; if it had passed it would have cast Catiline as a victim of senatorial overreach; if it had failed it would have undermined Cicero's position in the senate. This political isolation is then emphasised when Cicero relates that Catiline sought to place himself into voluntary custody to service his reputation but found nobody willing to take him. Such isolation is further illustrated noting how the Senate's did not voice any immediate objections to the idea of exiling Catiline.\nChanging tack, Cicero then tells Catiline that if he leaves the city but, contrary to Catiline's existing plans, does not join the rebels in Etruria, Cicero would be seen as having forced an innocent man to go into exile. This argument was meant to paint Cicero in an unselfish light. An outburst of invective against Catiline and his followers, who Cicero brands as corrupt and bankrupt political failures, then follows. The conclusion of the speech notes that Cicero intends to do nothing compulsory at the moment, justified by rejection of arguments to have Catiline summarily executed (placed in the mouth of an abstract personification of Rome). Cicero instead seeks a longer term goals of ensuring that\u2014by allowing Catiline to join the Etrurian rebels\u2014the whole Senate is convinced of Catiline's guilt and that, when the rebels are defeated with Catiline and followers among them, the body politic is improved by their absence. The speech finally concludes with a prayer to Jupiter Stator that Catiline and his followers be defeated.\nSecond Catilinarian.\nCicero informed the citizens of Rome that Catiline had left the city not into exile, as Catiline had said, but to join with his illegal army. He described the conspirators as rich men who were in debt, men eager for power and wealth, Sulla's veterans, ruined men who hoped for any change, criminals, profligates and other men of Catiline's ilk. He assured the people of Rome that they had nothing to fear because he, as consul, and the gods would protect the state. This speech was delivered with the intention of convincing the lower class, or common man, that Catiline would not represent their interests and they should not support him.\nMeanwhile, Catiline joined up with Gaius Manlius, commander of the rebel force. When the Senate was informed of the developments, they declared the two of them public enemies. Antonius Hybrida (Cicero's fellow consul), with troops loyal to Rome, followed Catiline while Cicero remained at home to guard the city.\nThird Catilinarian.\nCicero claimed that the city should rejoice because it had been saved from a bloody rebellion. He presented evidence that all of Catiline's accomplices confessed to their crimes. He asked for nothing for himself but the grateful remembrance of the city and acknowledged that the victory was more difficult than one in foreign lands because the enemies were citizens of Rome.\nFourth Catilinarian.\nIn his fourth and final published argument, which took place in the Temple of Concordia, Cicero establishes a basis for other orators (primarily Cato the Younger) to argue for the execution of the conspirators. As consul, Cicero was formally not allowed to voice any opinion in the matter, but he circumvented the rule with subtle oratory. Although very little is known about the actual debate (except for Cicero's argument, which has probably been altered from its original), the Senate majority probably opposed the death sentence for various reasons, one of which was the nobility of the accused. For example, Julius Caesar argued that exile and disenfranchisement would be sufficient punishment for the conspirators, and one of the accused, Lentulus, was a praetor. However, after the combined efforts of Cicero and Cato, the vote shifted in favor of execution, and the sentence was carried out shortly afterwards.\nWhile some historians agree that Cicero's actions, in particular the final speeches before the Senate, may have saved the Republic, they also reflect his self-aggrandisement and, to a certain extent envy, probably born out of the fact that he was considered a \"novus homo\", a Roman citizen without noble or ancient lineage.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\nModern sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAncient sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

(), from \" \"\" ()\"\u00a0'cup, bowl') is a \"seed leaf\" \u2013 a significant part of the embryo within the seed of a plant \u2013 and is formally defined as \"the embryonic leaf in seed-bearing plants, one or more of which are the first to appear from a germinating seed.\" Botanists use the number of cotyledons present as one characteristic to classify the flowering plants (angiosperms): species with one cotyledon are called monocotyledonous (\"monocots\"); plants with two embryonic leaves are termed dicotyledonous (\"dicots\"). Many orchids with minute seeds have no identifiable cotyledon, and are regarded as acotyledons. The Dodders (\"Cuscuta\" spp) also lack cotyledons, as does the African tree \"Mammea africana\" (Calophyllaceae). A very small number of Dicots have more than two cotyledons, with perhaps \"Psittacanthus schiedeanus\" being the most extreme, having up to twelve.\nIn the case of dicot seedlings whose cotyledons are photosynthetic, the cotyledons are functionally similar to leaves. However, true leaves and cotyledons are developmentally distinct. Cotyledons form during embryogenesis, along with the root and shoot meristems, and are therefore present in the seed prior to germination. True leaves, however, form post-embryonically (i.e. after germination) from the shoot apical meristem, which generates subsequent aerial portions of the plant.\nThe cotyledon of grasses and many other monocotyledons is a highly modified leaf composed of a \"scutellum\" and a \"coleoptile\". The scutellum is a tissue within the seed that is specialized to absorb stored food from the adjacent endosperm. The coleoptile is a protective cap that covers the \"plumule\" (precursor to the stem and leaves of the plant).\nGymnosperm seedlings also have cotyledons. Gnetophytes, cycads, and ginkgos all have 2, whereas in conifers they are often variable in number (multicotyledonous), with 2 to 24 cotyledons forming a whorl at the top of the hypocotyl (the embryonic stem) surrounding the plumule. Within each species, there is often still some variation in cotyledon numbers, e.g. Monterey pine (\"Pinus radiata\") seedlings have between 5 and 9, and Jeffrey pine (\"Pinus jeffreyi\") 7 to 13 (Mirov 1967), but other species are more fixed, with e.g. Mediterranean cypress always having just two cotyledons. The highest number reported is for big-cone pinyon (\"Pinus maximartinezii\"), with 24 (Farjon &amp; Styles 1997).\nCotyledons may be ephemeral, lasting only days after emergence, or persistent, enduring at least a year on the plant. The cotyledons contain (or in the case of gymnosperms and monocotyledons, have access to) the stored food reserves of the seed. As these reserves are used up, the cotyledons may turn green and begin photosynthesis, or may wither as the first true leaves take over food production for the seedling.\nEpigeal versus hypogeal development.\nCotyledons may be either epigeal, expanding on the germination of the seed, throwing off the seed shell, rising above the ground, and perhaps becoming photosynthetic; or hypogeal, not expanding, remaining below ground and not becoming photosynthetic. The latter is typically the case where the cotyledons act as a storage organ, as in many nuts and acorns.\nHypogeal plants have (on average) significantly larger seeds than epigeal ones. They are also capable of surviving if the seedling is clipped off, as meristem buds remain underground (with epigeal plants, the meristem is clipped off if the seedling is grazed). The tradeoff is whether the plant should produce a large number of small seeds, or a smaller number of seeds which are more likely to survive.\nThe ultimate development of the epigeal habit is represented by a few plants, mostly in the family Gesneriaceae in which the cotyledon persists for a lifetime. In \"Streptocarpus wendlandii\" of South Africa, one cotyledon grows to be up to in length and up to wide, the largest cotyledon of any dicot, and exceeded only by the monocot \"Lodoicea\". Adventitious flower clusters form along the midrib of the cotyledon. The second cotyledon is much smaller and ephemeral.\nRelated plants may show a mixture of hypogeal and epigeal development, even within the same plant family. Groups which contain both hypogeal and epigeal species include, for example, the Southern Hemisphere conifer family Araucariaceae, the pea family, Fabaceae, and the genus \"Lilium\" (see Lily seed germination types). The frequently garden grown common bean, \"Phaseolus vulgaris\", is epigeal, while the closely related runner bean, \"Phaseolus coccineus\", is hypogeal.\nHistory.\nThe term \"cotyledon\" was coined by Marcello Malpighi (1628\u20131694). John Ray was the first botanist to recognize that some plants have two and others only one, and eventually the first to recognize the immense importance of this fact to systematics, in \"Methodus plantarum\" (1682).\nTheophrastus (3rd or 4th century BC) and Albertus Magnus (13th century) may also have recognized the distinction between the dicotyledons and monocotyledons.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A monocot taxon has been in use for several decades, but with various ranks and under several different names. The APG IV system recognises its monophyly but does not assign it to a taxonomic rank, and instead uses the term \"monocots\" to refer to the group. \nMonocotyledons are contrasted with the dicotyledons, which have two cotyledons. Unlike the monocots however, the dicots are not monophyletic and the two cotyledons are instead the ancestral characteristic of all flowering plants. Botanists now classify dicots into the eudicots (\"true dicots\") and several basal lineages from which the monocots emerged.\nThe monocots are extremely important economically, culturally, and ecologically, and make up a majority of plant biomass used in agriculture. Common crops such as dates, onions, garlic, rice, wheat, maize, and sugarcane are all monocots. The grasses alone cover over 40% of Earth's land area and contribute a significant portion of the human diet. Other monocots, like orchids, tulips, daffodils, and lilies are common houseplants and have been the subjects of several celebrations, holidays, and artworks for thousands of years.\nDescription.\nThe monocots have, as the name implies, a single (mono-) cotyledon, or embryonic leaf, in their seeds. Historically, this feature was used to contrast the monocots with the dicotyledons or dicots which typically have two cotyledons; however, modern research has shown that the dicots are paraphyletic. From a diagnostic point of view the number of cotyledons is neither a particularly useful characteristic (as they are only present for a very short period in a plant's life), nor is it completely reliable. The single cotyledon is only one of a number of modifications of the body plan of the ancestral monocotyledons, whose adaptive advantages are poorly understood, but may have been related to adaption to aquatic habitats, prior to radiation to terrestrial habitats. Nevertheless, monocots are sufficiently distinctive that there has rarely been disagreement as to membership of this group, despite considerable diversity in terms of external morphology.\nWith over 70,000 species, monocots are extremely evolutionarily successful and occupy a diverse set of niches: Perennial geophytes including orchids (Asparagales); tulips and lilies (Liliales); rosette and succulent epiphytes (Asparagales); mycoheterotrophs (Liliales, Dioscoreales, Pandanales), all in the lilioid monocots; major cereal grains (maize, rice, barley, rye, oats, millet, sorghum and wheat) in the grass family; and forage grasses (Poales) as well as woody tree-like palm trees (Arecales), bamboo, reeds and bromeliads (Poales), bananas and ginger (Zingiberales) in the commelinid monocots, as well as floating or submerged aquatic plants such as seagrass (Alismatales) are all monocots.\nVegetative.\nOrganisation, growth and life forms.\nThe most important distinction is their growth pattern, lacking a lateral meristem (cambium) that allows for continual growth in diameter with height (secondary growth), and therefore this characteristic is a basic limitation in shoot construction. Although largely herbaceous, monocots include some arboraceous species that reach great height, length and mass. The latter include agaves, palms, pandans, and bamboos. This creates challenges in water transport that monocots deal with in various ways. Some, such as species of \"Yucca\", develop anomalous secondary growth, while palm trees utilise an anomalous primary growth form described as establishment growth (\"see\" Vascular system). The axis undergoes primary thickening, which progresses from internode to internode, resulting in a typical inverted conical shape of the basal primary axis (\"see\" Tillich, Figure 1). The limited conductivity also contributes to limited branching of the stems. Despite these limitations a wide variety of adaptive growth forms has resulted (Tillich, Figure 2) from epiphytic orchids (Asparagales) and bromeliads (Poales) to submarine Alismatales (including the reduced Lemnoideae) and mycotrophic Burmanniaceae (Dioscreales) and Triuridaceae (Pandanales). Other forms of adaptation include the climbing vines of Araceae (Alismatales) which use negative phototropism (skototropism) to locate host trees (\"i.e.\" the darkest area), while some palms such as \"Calamus manan\" (Arecales) produce the longest shoots in the plant kingdom, up to 185\u00a0m long. Other monocots, particularly Poales, have adopted a therophyte life form.\nLeaves.\nThe cotyledon, the primordial Angiosperm leaf consists of a proximal leaf base or hypophyll and a distal hyperphyll. In monocots the hypophyll tends to be the dominant part in contrast to other angiosperms. From these, considerable diversity arises. Mature monocot leaves are generally narrow and linear, forming a sheathing around the stem at its base, although there are many exceptions. Leaf venation is of the striate type, mainly arcuate-striate or longitudinally striate (parallel), less often palmate-striate or pinnate-striate with the leaf veins emerging at the leaf base and then running together at the apices. There is usually only one leaf per node because the leaf base encompasses more than half the circumference. The evolution of this monocot characteristic has been attributed to developmental differences in early zonal differentiation rather than meristem activity (leaf base theory).\nRoots and underground organs.\nThe lack of cambium in the primary root limits its ability to grow sufficiently to maintain the plant. This necessitates early development of roots derived from the shoot (adventitious roots). In addition to roots, monocots develop runners and rhizomes, which are creeping shoots. Runners serve vegetative propagation, have elongated internodes, run on or just below the surface of the soil and in most case bear scale leaves. Rhizomes frequently have an additional storage function and rhizome producing plants are considered geophytes (Tillich, Figure 11). Other geophytes develop bulbs, a short axial body bearing leaves whose bases store food. Additional outer non-storage leaves may form a protective function (Tillich, Figure 12). Other storage organs may be tubers or corms, swollen axes. Tubers may form at the end of underground runners and persist. Corms are short lived vertical shoots with terminal inflorescences and shrivel once flowering has occurred. However, intermediate forms may occur such as in \"Crocosmia\" (Asparagales). Some monocots may also produce shoots that grow directly down into the soil, these are geophilous shoots (Tillich, Figure 11) that help overcome the limited trunk stability of large woody monocots.\nReproductive.\nFlowers.\nIn nearly all cases the perigone consists of two alternating trimerous whorls of tepals, being homochlamydeous, without differentiation between calyx and corolla. In zoophilous (pollinated by animals) taxa, both whorls are corolline (petal-like). Anthesis (the period of flower opening) is usually fugacious (short lived). Some of the more persistent perigones demonstrate thermonastic opening and closing (responsive to changes in temperature). About two thirds of monocots are zoophilous, predominantly by insects. These plants need to advertise to pollinators and do so by way of phaneranthous (showy) flowers. Such optical signalling is usually a function of the tepal whorls but may also be provided by semaphylls (other structures such as filaments, staminodes or stylodia which have become modified to attract pollinators). However, some monocot plants may have aphananthous (inconspicuous) flowers and still be pollinated by animals. In these the plants rely either on chemical attraction or other structures such as coloured bracts fulfill the role of optical attraction. In some phaneranthous plants such structures may reinforce floral structures. The production of fragrances for olfactory signalling are common in monocots. The perigone also functions as a landing platform for pollinating insects.\nFruit and seed.\nThe embryo consists of a single cotyledon, usually with two vascular bundles.\nComparison with dicots.\nThe traditionally listed differences between monocots and dicots are as follows. This is a broad sketch only, not invariably applicable, as there are a number of exceptions. The differences indicated are more true for monocots versus eudicots.\nA number of these differences are not unique to the monocots, and, while still useful, no one single feature will infallibly identify a plant as a monocot. For example, trimerous flowers and monosulcate pollen are also found in magnoliids, and exclusively adventitious roots are found in some of the Piperaceae. Similarly, at least one of these traits, parallel leaf veins, is far from universal among the monocots. Broad leaves and reticulate leaf veins, features typical of dicots, are found in a wide variety of monocot families: for example, \"Trillium\", \"Smilax\" (greenbriar), \"Pogonia\" (an orchid), and the Dioscoreales (yams). \"Potamogeton\" and \"Paris quadrifolia\" (herb-paris) are examples of monocots with tetramerous flowers. Other plants exhibit a mixture of characteristics. Nymphaeaceae (water lilies) have reticulate veins, a single cotyledon, adventitious roots, and a monocot-like vascular bundle. These examples reflect their shared ancestry. Nevertheless, this list of traits is generally valid, especially when contrasting monocots with eudicots, rather than non-monocot flowering plants in general.\nApomorphies.\nMonocot apomorphies (characteristics derived during radiation rather than inherited from an ancestral form) include herbaceous habit, leaves with parallel venation and sheathed base, an embryo with a single cotyledon, an atactostele, numerous adventitious roots, sympodial growth, and trimerous (3 parts per whorl) flowers that are pentacyclic (5 whorled) with 3 sepals, 3 petals, 2 whorls of 3 stamens each, and 3 carpels. In contrast, monosulcate pollen is considered an ancestral trait, probably plesiomorphic.\nSynapomorphies.\nThe distinctive features of the monocots have contributed to the relative taxonomic stability of the group. Douglas E. Soltis and others identify thirteen synapomorphies (shared characteristics that unite monophyletic groups of taxa);\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt; \nVascular system.\nMonocots have a distinctive arrangement of vascular tissue known as an atactostele in which the vascular tissue is scattered rather than arranged in concentric rings. Collenchyma is absent in monocot stems, roots and leaves. Many monocots are herbaceous and do not have the ability to increase the width of a stem (secondary growth) via the same kind of vascular cambium found in non-monocot woody plants. However, some monocots do have secondary growth; because this does not arise from a single vascular cambium producing xylem inwards and phloem outwards, it is termed \"anomalous secondary growth\". Examples of large monocots which either exhibit secondary growth, or can reach large sizes without it, are palms (Arecaceae), screwpines (Pandanaceae), bananas (Musaceae), \"Yucca\", \"Aloe\", \"Dracaena\", and \"Cordyline\".\nTaxonomy.\nEarly history.\nPre-Linnean.\nMonocots were first recognized as a group in Matthias de l'Obel's \"Stirpium adversaria nova\". Searching for non-pharmacological characteristics to classify plants by, he chose on leaf form and venation, and observed that the majority of plants had broad leaves with net-like venation, but some had long and straight leaves with parallel veins. He did not decide on any formal name for the two groups he discovered, and his new classification scheme did not receive much appraisal and only saw moderate success within academic circles.\nFormal description dates from John Ray's studies of seed structure in the 17th century. Ray, who is often considered the first botanical systematist, observed the dichotomy of cotyledon structure in his examination of seeds. He reported his findings in a paper read to the Royal Society on 17 December 1674, entitled \"A Discourse on the Seeds of Plants\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"A Discourse on the Seeds of Plants\"\n&lt;poem&gt;The greatest number of plants that come of seed spring at first out of the earth with two leaves which being for the most part of a different figure from the succeeding leaves are by our gardeners not improperly called the seed leaves... In the first kind the seed leaves are nothing but the two lobes of the seed having their plain sides clapt together like the two halves of a walnut and therefore are of the just figure of the seed slit in sunder flat wise...Of seeds that spring out of the earth with leaves like the succeeding and no seed leaves I have observed two sorts. 1. Such as are congenerous to the first kind precedent that is whose pulp is divided into two lobes and a radicle... 2. Such which neither spring out of the ground with seed leaves nor have their pulp divided into lobes &lt;/poem&gt;\nJohn Ray (1674), pp.\u00a0164, 166\n Since this paper appeared a year before the publication of Malpighi's \"Anatome Plantarum\" (1675\u20131679), Ray has the priority. At the time, Ray did not fully realise the importance of his discovery but progressively developed this over successive publications. And since these were in Latin, \"seed leaves\" became \"folia seminalia\" and then \"cotyledon\", following Malpighi. Malpighi and Ray were familiar with each other's work, and Malpighi in describing the same structures had introduced the term cotyledon, which Ray adopted in his subsequent writing.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"De seminum vegetatione\"\n &lt;poem&gt;\"Mense quoque Maii, alias seminales plantulas Fabarum, &amp; Phaseolorum, ablatis pariter binis seminalibus foliis, seu cotyledonibus, incubandas posui\"In the month of May, also, I incubated two seed plants, Faba and Phaseolus, after removing the two seed leaves, or cotyledons&lt;/poem&gt;\nMarcello Malpighi (1679), p.\u00a018\n In this experiment, Malpighi also showed that the cotyledons were critical to the development of the plant, proof that Ray required for his theory. In his \"Methodus plantarum nova\" Ray also developed and justified the \"natural\" or pre-evolutionary approach to classification, based on characteristics selected \"a posteriori\" in order to group together taxa that have the greatest number of shared characteristics. This approach, also referred to as polythetic would last till evolutionary theory enabled Eichler to develop the phyletic system that superseded it in the late nineteenth century, based on an understanding of the acquisition of characteristics. He also made the crucial observation \"Ex hac seminum divisione sumum potest generalis plantarum distinctio, eaque meo judicio omnium prima et longe optima, in eas sci. quae plantula seminali sunt bifolia aut \u03b4\u03b9\u03bb\u03cc\u03b2\u03c9, et quae plantula sem. adulta analoga.\" (From this division of the seeds derives a general distinction amongst plants, that in my judgement is first and by far the best, into those seed plants which are bifoliate, or bilobed, and those that are analogous to the adult), that is between monocots and dicots. He illustrated this by quoting from Malpighi and including reproductions of Malpighi's drawings of cotyledons (see figure). Initially Ray did not develop a classification of flowering plants (florifera) based on a division by the number of cotyledons, but developed his ideas over successive publications, coining the terms \"Monocotyledones\" and \"Dicotyledones\" in 1703, in the revised version of his \"Methodus\" (\"Methodus plantarum emendata\"), as a primary method for dividing them, \"Herbae floriferae, dividi possunt, ut diximus, in Monocotyledones &amp; Dicotyledones\" (Flowering plants, can be divided, as we have said, into Monocotyledons &amp; Dicotyledons).\nPost Linnean.\nAlthough Linnaeus (1707\u20131778) did not utilise Ray's discovery, basing his own classification solely on floral reproductive morphology, the term was used shortly after his classification appeared (1753) by Scopoli and who is credited for its introduction. Every taxonomist since then, starting with De Jussieu and De Candolle, has used Ray's distinction as a major classification characteristic. In De Jussieu's system (1789), he followed Ray, arranging his Monocotyledones into three classes based on stamen position and placing them between Acotyledones and Dicotyledones. De Candolle's system (1813) which was to predominate thinking through much of the 19th century used a similar general arrangement, with two subgroups of his \"Monocotyl\u00e9don\u00e9s\" (Monocotyledoneae). Lindley (1830) followed De Candolle in using the terms Monocotyledon and Endogenae interchangeably. They considered the monocotyledons to be a group of vascular plants (\"Vasculares\") whose vascular bundles were thought to arise from within (\"Endog\u00e8nes\" or endogenous).\nMonocotyledons remained in a similar position as a major division of the flowering plants throughout the nineteenth century, with minor variations. George Bentham and Hooker (1862\u20131883) used Monocotyledones, as would Wettstein, while August Eichler used Mononocotyleae and Engler, following de Candolle, Monocotyledoneae. In the twentieth century, some authors used alternative names such as Bessey's (1915) Alternifoliae and Cronquist's (1966) Liliatae. Later (1981) Cronquist changed Liliatae to Liliopsida, usages also adopted by Takhtajan simultaneously. Thorne (1992) and Dahlgren (1985) also used Liliidae as a synonym.\nTaxonomists had considerable latitude in naming this group, as the Monocotyledons were a group above the rank of family. Article 16 of the \"ICBN\" allows either a descriptive botanical name or a name formed from the name of an included family.\nIn summary they have been variously named, as follows:\nModern era.\nOver the 1980s, a more general review of the classification of angiosperms was undertaken. The 1990s saw considerable progress in plant phylogenetics and cladistic theory, initially based on \"rbcL\" gene sequencing and cladistic analysis, enabling a phylogenetic tree to be constructed for the flowering plants. The establishment of major new clades necessitated a departure from the older but widely used classifications such as Cronquist and Thorne, based largely on morphology rather than genetic data. These developments complicated discussions on plant evolution and necessitated a major taxonomic restructuring.\nThis DNA based molecular phylogenetic research confirmed on the one hand that the monocots remained as a well defined monophyletic group or clade, in contrast to the other historical divisions of the flowering plants, which had to be substantially reorganized. No longer could the angiosperms be simply divided into monocotyledons and dicotyledons; it was apparent that the monocotyledons were but one of a relatively large number of defined groups within the angiosperms. Correlation with morphological criteria showed that the defining feature was not cotyledon number but the separation of angiosperms into two major pollen types, uniaperturate (monosulcate and monosulcate-derived) and triaperturate (tricolpate and tricolpate-derived), with the monocots situated within the uniaperturate groups. The formal taxonomic ranking of Monoctyledons thus became replaced with monocots as an informal clade. This is the name that has been most commonly used since the publication of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG) system in 1998 and regularly updated since.\nWithin the angiosperms, there are two major grades, a small early branching basal grade, the basal angiosperms (ANA grade) with three lineages and a larger late branching grade, the core angiosperms (mesangiosperms) with five lineages, as shown in the cladogram.\nSubdivision.\nWhile the monocotyledons have remained extremely stable in their outer borders as a well-defined and coherent monophylectic group, the deeper internal relationships have undergone considerable flux, with many competing classification systems over time.\nHistorically, Bentham (1877), considered the monocots to consist of four alliances, Epigynae, Coronariae, Nudiflorae and Glumales, based on floral characteristics. He describes the attempts to subdivide the group since the days of Lindley as largely unsuccessful. Like most subsequent classification systems it failed to distinguish between two major orders, Liliales and Asparagales, now recognised as quite separate. A major advance in this respect was the work of Rolf Dahlgren (1980), which would form the basis of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group's (APG) subsequent modern classification of monocot families. Dahlgren who used the alternate name Lilliidae considered the monocots as a subclass of angiosperms characterised by a single cotyledon and the presence of triangular protein bodies in the sieve tube plastids. He divided the monocots into seven superorders, Alismatiflorae, Ariflorae, Triuridiflorae, Liliiflorae, Zingiberiflorae, Commeliniflorae and Areciflorae. With respect to the specific issue regarding Liliales and Asparagales, Dahlgren followed Huber (1969) in adopting a splitter approach, in contrast to the longstanding tendency to view Liliaceae as a very broad sensu lato family. Following Dahlgren's untimely death in 1987, his work was continued by his widow, Gertrud Dahlgren, who published a revised version of the classification in 1989. In this scheme the suffix \"-florae\" was replaced with \"-anae\" (\"e.g.\" Alismatanae) and the number of superorders expanded to ten with the addition of Bromelianae, Cyclanthanae and Pandananae.\nMolecular studies have both confirmed the monophyly of the monocots and helped elucidate relationships within this group. The APG system does not assign the monocots to a taxonomic rank, instead recognizing a monocots clade. However, there has remained some uncertainty regarding the exact relationships between the major lineages, with a number of competing models (including APG).\nThe APG system establishes eleven orders of monocots. These form three grades, the alismatid monocots, lilioid monocots and the commelinid monocots by order of branching, from early to late. In the following cladogram numbers indicate crown group (most recent common ancestor of the sampled species of the clade of interest) divergence times in mya (million years ago).\nOf some 70,000 species, by far the largest number (65%) are found in two families, the orchids and grasses. The orchids (Orchidaceae, Asparagales) contain about 25,000 species and the grasses (Poaceae, Poales) about 11,000. Other well known groups within the Poales order include the Cyperaceae (sedges) and Juncaceae (rushes), and the monocots also include familiar families such as the palms (Arecaceae, Arecales) and lilies (Liliaceae, Liliales).\nEvolution.\nIn prephyletic classification systems monocots were generally positioned between plants other than angiosperms and dicots, implying that monocots were more primitive. With the introduction of phyletic thinking in taxonomy (from the system of Eichler 1875\u20131878 onwards) the predominant theory of monocot origins was the ranalean (ranalian) theory, particularly in the work of Bessey (1915), which traced the origin of all flowering plants to a Ranalean type, and reversed the sequence making dicots the more primitive group.\nThe monocots form a monophyletic group arising early in the history of the flowering plants, but the fossil record is meagre. The earliest fossils presumed to be monocot remains date from the early Cretaceous period. For a very long time, fossils of palm trees were believed to be the oldest monocots, first appearing 90 million years ago (mya), but this estimate may not be entirely true. At least some putative monocot fossils have been found in strata as old as the eudicots. The oldest fossils that are unequivocally monocots are pollen from the Late Barremian\u2013Aptian \u2013 Early Cretaceous period, about 120-110 million years ago, and are assignable to clade-Pothoideae-Monstereae Araceae; being Araceae, sister to other Alismatales. They have also found flower fossils of Triuridaceae (Pandanales) in Upper Cretaceous rocks in New Jersey, becoming the oldest known sighting of saprophytic/mycotrophic habits in angiosperm plants and among the oldest known fossils of monocotyledons.\nTopology of the angiosperm phylogenetic tree could imply that the monocots are among the oldest lineages of angiosperms, which would support the theory that they are just as old as the eudicots. The pollen of the eudicots dates back 125 million years, so the lineage of monocots should be that old too.\nMolecular clock estimates.\nK\u00e5re Bremer, using rbcL sequences and the mean path length method for estimating divergence times, estimated the age of the monocot crown group (i.e. the time at which the ancestor of today's \"Acorus\" diverged from the rest of the group) as 134 million years. Similarly, Wikstr\u00f6m \"et al.\", using Sanderson's non-parametric rate smoothing approach, obtained ages of 127\u2013141 million years for the crown group of monocots. All these estimates have large error ranges (usually 15\u201320%), and Wikstr\u00f6m \"et al.\" used only a single calibration point, namely the split between Fagales and Cucurbitales, which was set to 84\u00a0Ma, in the late Santonian period. Early molecular clock studies using strict clock models had estimated the monocot crown age to 200 \u00b1 20 million years ago or 160 \u00b1 16 million years, while studies using relaxed clocks have obtained 135-131 million years or 133.8 to 124 million years. Bremer's estimate of 134 million years has been used as a secondary calibration point in other analyses. Some estimates place the diversification of the monocots as far back as 150\u00a0mya in the Jurassic period.\nThe lineage that led to monocots (stem group) split from other plants about 136 million years ago or 165\u2013170 million years ago.\nCore group.\nThe age of the core group of so-called 'nuclear monocots' or 'core monocots', which correspond to all orders except Acorales and Alismatales, is about 131 million years to present, and crown group age is about 126 million years to the present. The subsequent branching in this part of the tree (i.e. Petrosaviaceae, Dioscoreales + Pandanales and Liliales clades appeared), including the crown Petrosaviaceae group may be in the period around 125\u2013120 million years BC (about 111 million years so far), and stem groups of all other orders, including Commelinidae would have diverged about or shortly after 115 million years. These and many clades within these orders may have originated in southern Gondwana, i.e. Antarctica, Australasia, and southern South America.\nAquatic monocots.\nThe aquatic monocots of Alismatales have commonly been regarded as \"primitive\". They have also been considered to have the most primitive foliage, which were cross-linked as Dioscoreales and Melanthiales. Keep in mind that the \"most primitive\" monocot is not necessarily \"the sister of everyone else\". This is because the ancestral or primitive characters are inferred by means of the reconstruction of character states, with the help of the phylogenetic tree. So primitive characters of monocots may be present in some derived groups. On the other hand, the basal taxa may exhibit many morphological autapomorphies. So although Acoraceae is the sister group to the remaining monocotyledons, the result does not imply that Acoraceae is \"the most primitive monocot\" in terms of its character states. In fact, Acoraceae is highly derived in many morphological characters, and that is precisely why Acoraceae and Alismatales occupied relatively derived positions in the trees produced by Chase \"et al.\" and others.\nSome authors support the idea of an aquatic phase as the origin of monocots. The phylogenetic position of Alismatales (many water), which occupy a relationship with the rest except the Acoraceae, do not rule out the idea, because it could be 'the most primitive monocots' but not 'the most basal'. The Atactostele stem, the long and linear leaves, the absence of secondary growth (see the biomechanics of living in the water), roots in groups instead of a single root branching (related to the nature of the substrate), including sympodial use, are consistent with a water source. However, while monocots were sisters of the aquatic Ceratophyllales, or their origin is related to the adoption of some form of aquatic habit, it would not help much to the understanding of how it evolved to develop their distinctive anatomical features: the monocots seem so different from the rest of angiosperms and it is difficult to relate their morphology, anatomy and development and those of broad-leaved angiosperms.\nOther taxa.\nIn the past, taxa which had petiolate leaves with reticulate venation were considered \"primitive\" within the monocots, because of the superficial resemblance to the leaves of dicotyledons. Recent work suggests that while these taxa are sparse in the phylogenetic tree of monocots, such as fleshy fruited taxa (excluding taxa with aril seeds dispersed by ants), the two features would be adapted to conditions that evolved together regardless. Among the taxa involved were \"Smilax\", \"Trillium\" (Liliales), \"Dioscorea\" (Dioscoreales), etc. A number of these plants are vines that tend to live in shaded habitats for at least part of their lives, and this fact may also relate to their shapeless stomata. Reticulate venation seems to have appeared at least 26 times in monocots, and fleshy fruits have appeared 21 times (sometimes lost later); the two characteristics, though different, showed strong signs of a tendency to be good or bad in tandem, a phenomenon described as \"concerted convergence\" (\"coordinated convergence\").\nEtymology.\nThe name monocotyledons is derived from the traditional botanical name \"Monocotyledones\" or \"Monocotyledoneae\" in Latin, which refers to the fact that most members of this group have one cotyledon, or embryonic leaf, in their seeds.\nEcology.\nEmergence.\nSome monocots, such as grasses, have hypogeal emergence, where the mesocotyl elongates and pushes the coleoptile (which encloses and protects the shoot tip) toward the soil surface. Since elongation occurs above the cotyledon, it is left in place in the soil where it was planted. \nMany dicots have epigeal emergence, in which the hypocotyl elongates and becomes arched in the soil. As the hypocotyl continues to elongate, it pulls the cotyledons upward, above the soil surface.\nConservation.\nThe IUCN Red List describes four species as extinct, four as extinct in the wild, 626 as possibly extinct, 423 as critically endangered, 632 endangered, 621 vulnerable, and 269 near threatened of 4,492 whose status is known.\nUses.\nMonocots are among the most important plants economically and culturally, and account for most of the staple foods of the world, such as cereal grains and starchy root crops, and palms, orchids and lilies, building materials, and many medicines. Of the monocots, the grasses are of enormous economic importance as a source of animal and human food, and form the largest component of agricultural species in terms of biomass produced.\nOther economically important monocotyledon crops include various palms (Arecaceae), bananas and plantains (Musaceae), gingers and their relatives, turmeric and cardamom (Zingiberaceae), asparagus (Asparagaceae), pineapple (Bromeliaceae), sedges (Cyperaceae) and rushes (Juncaceae), vanilla (Orchidaceae), yam (Dioscoreaceae), taro (Araceae), and leeks, onion and garlic (Amaryllidaceae). Many houseplants are monocotyledon epiphytes. Most of the horticultural bulbs, plants cultivated for their blooms, such as lilies, daffodils, irises, amaryllis, cannas, bluebells and tulips, are monocotyledons.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The concept of linear combinations is central to linear algebra and related fields of mathematics. Most of this article deals with linear combinations in the context of a vector space over a field, with some generalizations given at the end of the article.\nDefinition.\nLet \"V\" be a vector space over the field \"K\". As usual, we call elements of \"V\" \"vectors\" and call elements of \"K\" \"scalars\".\nIf v1...,v\"n\" are vectors and \"a\"1...,\"a\"\"n\" are scalars, then the \"linear combination of those vectors with those scalars as coefficients\" is\nformula_1\nThere is some ambiguity in the use of the term \"linear combination\" as to whether it refers to the expression or to its value. In most cases the value is emphasized, as in the assertion \"the set of all linear combinations of v1...,v\"n\" always forms a subspace\". However, one could also say \"two different linear combinations can have the same value\" in which case the reference is to the expression. The subtle difference between these uses is the essence of the notion of linear dependence: a family \"F\" of vectors is linearly independent precisely if any linear combination of the vectors in \"F\" (as value) is uniquely so (as expression). In any case, even when viewed as expressions, all that matters about a linear combination is the coefficient of each v\"i\"; trivial modifications such as permuting the terms or adding terms with zero coefficient do not produce distinct linear combinations.\nIn a given situation, \"K\" and \"V\" may be specified explicitly, or they may be obvious from context. In that case, we often speak of \"a linear combination of the vectors\" v1...,v\"n\", with the coefficients unspecified (except that they must belong to \"K\"). Or, if \"S\" is a subset of \"V\", we may speak of \"a linear combination of vectors in S\", where both the coefficients and the vectors are unspecified, except that the vectors must belong to the set \"S\" (and the coefficients must belong to \"K\"). Finally, we may speak simply of \"a linear combination\", where nothing is specified (except that the vectors must belong to \"V\" and the coefficients must belong to \"K\"); in this case one is probably referring to the expression, since every vector in \"V\" is certainly the value of some linear combination.\nNote that by definition, a linear combination involves only finitely many vectors (except as described in the section.\nHowever, the set \"S\" that the vectors are taken from (if one is mentioned) can still be infinite; each individual linear combination will only involve finitely many vectors.\nAlso, there is no reason that \"n\" cannot be zero; in that case, we declare by convention that the result of the linear combination is the zero vector in \"V\".\nExamples and counterexamples.\nEuclidean vectors.\nLet the field \"K\" be the set R of real numbers, and let the vector space \"V\" be the Euclidean space R3.\nConsider the vectors e1 = (1,0,0), e2 = (0,1,0) and e3 = (0,0,1).\nThen \"any\" vector in R3 is a linear combination of e1, e2, and\u00a0e3.\nTo see that this is so, take an arbitrary vector (\"a\"1,\"a\"2,\"a\"3) in R3, and write:\nformula_2\nFunctions.\nLet \"K\" be the set C of all complex numbers, and let \"V\" be the set CC(\"R\") of all continuous functions from the real line R to the complex plane C.\nConsider the vectors (functions) \"f\" and \"g\" defined by \"f\"(\"t\")\u00a0:= \"e\"\"it\" and \"g\"(\"t\")\u00a0:= \"e\"\u2212\"it\".\nSome linear combinations of \"f\" and \"g\"\u00a0are:\nOn the other hand, the constant function 3 is \"not\" a linear combination of \"f\" and \"g\". To see this, suppose that 3 could be written as a linear combination of \"e\"\"it\" and \"e\"\u2212\"it\". This means that there would exist complex scalars \"a\" and \"b\" such that \"ae\"\"it\" + \"be\"\u2212\"it\" = 3 for all real numbers \"t\". Setting \"t\" = 0 and \"t\" = \u03c0 gives the equations \"a\" + \"b\" = 3 and \"a\" + \"b\" = \u22123, and clearly this cannot happen. &lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPolynomials.\nLet \"K\" be R, C, or any field, and let \"V\" be the set \"P\" of all polynomials with coefficients taken from the field \"K\".\nConsider the vectors (polynomials) \"p\"1\u00a0:=\u00a01, \"p\"2 := \"x\" + 1, and \"p\"3 := \"x\"2 + \"x\" + 1.\nTo find out whether \"x\"2\u00a0\u2212\u00a01 is a linear combination of \"p\"1, \"p\"2, and \"p\"3,\nwe consider an arbitrary linear combination of these vectors and try to see when it equals the desired vector \"x\"2\u00a0\u2212\u00a01.\nPicking arbitrary coefficients \"a\"1, \"a\"2, and \"a\"3, we\u00a0want\nformula_5\nMultiplying the polynomials out, this\u00a0means\nformula_6 \nand collecting like powers of \"x\", we\u00a0get\nformula_7 \nTwo polynomials are equal if and only if their corresponding coefficients are equal, so we can conclude\nformula_8 \nThis system of linear equations can easily be solved.\nFirst, the first equation simply says that \"a\"3 is 1.\nKnowing that, we can solve the second equation for \"a\"2, which comes out to \u22121.\nFinally, the last equation tells us that \"a\"1 is also \u22121.\nTherefore, the only possible way to get a linear combination is with these coefficients.\nIndeed,\nformula_9\nso \"x\"2\u00a0\u2212\u00a01 \"is\" a linear combination of \"p\"1, \"p\"2, and\u00a0\"p\"3.\nOn the other hand, if we try to make \"x\"3\u00a0\u2212\u00a01 a linear combination of \"p\"1, \"p\"2, and \"p\"3, then following the same process as before, we get the equation\nformula_10\nHowever, when we set corresponding coefficients equal in this case, the equation for \"x\"3\u00a0is\nformula_11 \nwhich is always false.\nTherefore, there is no way for this to work, and \"x\"3\u00a0\u2212\u00a01 is \"not\" a linear combination of \"p\"1, \"p\"2, and\u00a0\"p\"3.\nThe linear span.\nTake an arbitrary field \"K\", an arbitrary vector space \"V\", and let v1...,v\"n\" be vectors (in \"V\").\nIt is interesting to consider the set of \"all\" linear combinations of these vectors.\nThis set is called the \"linear span\" (or just \"span\") of the vectors, say \"S\" = {v1, ..., v\"n\"}. We write the span of \"S\" as span(\"S\") or sp(\"S\"):\nformula_12\nLinear independence.\nSuppose that, for some sets of vectors v1...,v\"n\",\na single vector can be written in two different ways as a linear combination of them:\nformula_13\nThis is equivalent, by subtracting these (formula_14), to saying a non-trivial combination is zero:\nformula_15\nIf that is possible, then v1...,v\"n\" are called \"linearly dependent\"; otherwise, they are \"linearly independent\".\nSimilarly, we can speak of linear dependence or independence of an arbitrary set \"S\" of vectors.\nIf \"S\" is linearly independent and the span of \"S\" equals \"V\", then \"S\" is a basis for \"V\".\nAffine, conical, and convex combinations.\nBy restricting the coefficients used in linear combinations, one can define the related concepts of affine combination, conical combination, and convex combination, and the associated notions of sets closed under these operations.\nBecause these are more \"restricted\" operations, more subsets will be closed under them, so affine subsets, convex cones, and convex sets are \"generalizations\" of vector subspaces: a vector subspace is also an affine subspace, a convex cone, and a convex set, but a convex set need not be a vector subspace, affine, or a convex cone.\nThese concepts often arise when one can take certain linear combinations of objects, but not any: for example, probability distributions are closed under convex combination (they form a convex set), but not conical or affine combinations (or linear), and positive measures are closed under conical combination but not affine or linear \u2013 hence one defines signed measures as the linear closure.\nLinear and affine combinations can be defined over any field (or ring), but conical and convex combination require a notion of \"positive\", and hence can only be defined over an ordered field (or ordered ring), generally the real numbers.\nIf one allows only scalar multiplication, not addition, one obtains a (not necessarily convex) cone; one often restricts the definition to only allowing multiplication by positive scalars.\nAll of these concepts are usually defined as subsets of an ambient vector space (except for affine spaces, which are also considered as \"vector spaces forgetting the origin\"), rather than being axiomatized independently.\nOperad theory.\nMore abstractly, in the language of operad theory, one can consider vector spaces to be algebras over the operad formula_16 (the infinite direct sum, so only finitely many terms are non-zero; this corresponds to only taking finite sums), which parametrizes linear combinations: the vector formula_17 for instance corresponds to the linear combination formula_18. Similarly, one can consider affine combinations, conical combinations, and convex combinations to correspond to the sub-operads where the terms sum to 1, the terms are all non-negative, or both, respectively. Graphically, these are the infinite affine hyperplane, the infinite hyper-octant, and the infinite simplex. This formalizes what is meant by formula_19 being or the standard simplex being model spaces, and such observations as that every bounded convex polytope is the image of a simplex. Here suboperads correspond to more restricted operations and thus more general theories.\nFrom this point of view, we can think of linear combinations as the most general sort of operation on a vector space \u2013 saying that a vector space is an algebra over the operad of linear combinations is precisely the statement that \"all possible\" algebraic operations in a vector space are linear combinations.\nThe basic operations of addition and scalar multiplication, together with the existence of an additive identity and additive inverses, cannot be combined in any more complicated way than the generic linear combination: the basic operations are a generating set for the operad of all linear combinations.\nUltimately, this fact lies at the heart of the usefulness of linear combinations in the study of vector spaces.\nGeneralizations.\nIf \"V\" is a topological vector space, then there may be a way to make sense of certain \"infinite\" linear combinations, using the topology of \"V\".\nFor example, we might be able to speak of \"a\"1v1\u00a0+ \"a\"2v2\u00a0+ \"a\"3v3\u00a0+\u00a0\u22ef, going on forever.\nSuch infinite linear combinations do not always make sense; we call them \"convergent\" when they do.\nAllowing more linear combinations in this case can also lead to a different concept of span, linear independence, and basis.\nThe articles on the various flavors of topological vector spaces go into more detail about these.\nIf \"K\" is a commutative ring instead of a field, then everything that has been said above about linear combinations generalizes to this case without change.\nThe only difference is that we call spaces like this \"V\" modules instead of vector spaces.\nIf \"K\" is a noncommutative ring, then the concept still generalizes, with one caveat:\nsince modules over noncommutative rings come in left and right versions, our linear combinations may also come in either of these versions, whatever is appropriate for the given module.\nThis is simply a matter of doing scalar multiplication on the correct side.\nA more complicated twist comes when \"V\" is a bimodule over two rings, \"K\"L and \"K\"R.\nIn that case, the most general linear combination looks like\nformula_20\nwhere \"a\"1...,\"a\"\"n\" belong to \"K\"L, \"b\"1...,\"b\"\"n\" belong to \"K\"R, and v1,\u2026,v\"n\" belong to \"V\".\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Geographic regions and sub-regions are mostly described by their imprecisely defined, and sometimes transitory boundaries, except in human geography, where jurisdiction areas such as national borders are defined in law. More confined or well bounded portions are called \"locations\" or \"places\".\nApart from the global continental regions, there are also hydrospheric and atmospheric regions that cover the oceans, and discrete climates above the land and water masses of the planet. The land and water global regions are divided into subregions geographically bounded by large geological features that influence large-scale ecologies, such as plains and features.\nAs a way of describing spatial areas, the concept of regions is important and widely used among the many branches of geography, each of which can describe areas in regional terms. For example, \"ecoregion\" is a term used in environmental geography, cultural region in cultural geography, bioregion in biogeography, and so on. The field of geography that studies regions themselves is called regional geography. Regions are an area or division, especially part of a country or the world having definable characteristics but not always fixed boundaries. \nIn the fields of physical geography, ecology, biogeography, zoogeography, and environmental geography, regions tend to be based on natural features such as ecosystems or biotopes, biomes, drainage basins, natural regions, mountain ranges, soil types. Where human geography is concerned, the regions and subregions are described by the discipline of ethnography.\nGlobalization.\nGlobal regions are distinguishable from space, and are therefore clearly distinguished by the two basic terrestrial environments, land and water. However, they have been generally recognized as such much earlier by terrestrial cartography because of their impact on human geography. They are divided into the largest of land regions, known as continents and the largest of water regions known as oceans. There are also significant regions that do not belong to either classification, such as archipelago regions that are littoral regions, or earthquake regions that are defined in geology.\nContinental regions.\nContinental regions are usually based on broad experiences in human history and attempt to reduce very large areas to more manageable regionalization for the purpose of the study. As such they are conceptual constructs, usually lacking distinct boundaries. The oceanic division into maritime regions is used in conjunction with the relationship to the central area of the continent, using directions of the compass.\nSome continental regions are defined by the major continental feature of their identity, such as the Amazon basin, or the Sahara, which both occupy a significant percentage of their respective continental land area.\nTo a large extent, major continental regions are mental constructs created by considering an efficient way to define large areas of the continents. For the most part, the images of the world are derived as much from academic studies, from all types of media, or from personal experience of global exploration. They are a matter of collective human knowledge of their own planet and are attempts to better understand their environments.\nRegional geography.\nRegional geography is a branch of geography that studies regions of all sizes across the Earth. It has a prevailing descriptive character. The main aim is to understand or define the uniqueness or character of a particular region, which consists of natural as well as human elements. Attention is paid also to regionalization, which covers the proper techniques of space delimitation into regions.\nRegional geography is also considered as a certain approach to study in geographical sciences (similar to quantitative or critical geographies; for more information, see history of geography).\nHuman geography.\nHuman geography is a branch of geography that focuses on the study of patterns and processes that shape human interaction with various discrete environments. It encompasses human, political, cultural, social, and economic aspects among others that are often clearly delineated. While the major focus of human geography is not the physical landscape of the Earth (see physical geography), it is hardly possible to discuss human geography without referring to the physical landscape on which human activities are being played out, and environmental geography is emerging as a link between the two. Regions of human geography can be divided into many broad categories:\nHistorical regions.\nThe field of historical geography involves the study of human history as it relates to places and regions, or the study of how places and regions have changed over time.\nD. W. Meinig, a historical geographer of America, describes many historical regions in his book \"The Shaping of America: A Geographical Perspective on 500 Years of History\". For example, in identifying European \"source regions\" in early American colonization efforts, he defines and describes the \"Northwest European Atlantic Protestant Region\", which includes sub-regions such as the \"Western Channel Community\", which itself is made of sub-regions such as the \"English West Country\" of Cornwall, Devon, Somerset, and Dorset.\nIn describing historic regions of America, Meinig writes of \"The Great Fishery\" off the coast of Newfoundland and New England, an oceanic region that includes the Grand Banks. He rejects regions traditionally used in describing American history, like New France, \"West Indies\", the Middle Colonies, and the individual colonies themselves (Province of Maryland, for example). Instead he writes of \"discrete colonization areas\", which may be named after colonies but rarely adhere strictly to political boundaries. Among other historic regions of this type, he writes about \"Greater New England\" and its major sub-regions of \"Plymouth\", \"New Haven shores\" (including parts of Long Island), \"Rhode Island\" (or \"Narragansett Bay\"), \"the Piscataqua\", \"Massachusetts Bay\", \"Connecticut Valley\", and to a lesser degree, regions in the sphere of influence of Greater New England, \"Acadia\" (Nova Scotia), \"Newfoundland and The Fishery/The Banks\".\nOther examples of historical regions are Iroquoia, Ohio Country, Illinois Country, and Rupert's Land.\nIn Russia, historical regions include Siberia and the Russian North, as well as the Ural Mountains. These regions had an identity that developed from the early modern period and led to Siberian regionalism.\nTourism region.\nA tourism region is a geographical region that has been designated by a governmental organization or tourism bureau as having common cultural or environmental characteristics. These regions are often named after a geographical, former, or current administrative region or may have a name created for tourism purposes. The names often evoke certain positive qualities of the area and suggest a coherent tourism experience to visitors. Countries, states, provinces, and other administrative regions are often carved up into tourism regions to facilitate attracting visitors.\nSome of the more famous tourism regions based on historical or current administrative regions include Tuscany in Italy and Yucat\u00e1n in Mexico. Famous examples of regions created by a government or tourism bureau include the United Kingdom's Lake District and California's Wine Country.\ngreat plains region\nNatural resource regions.\nNatural resources often occur in distinct regions. Natural resource regions can be a topic of physical geography or environmental geography, but also have a strong element of human geography and economic geography. A coal region, for example, is a physical or geomorphological region, but its development and exploitation can make it into an economic and a cultural region. Examples of natural resource regions are the Rumaila Field, the oil field that lies along the border or Iraq and Kuwait and played a role in the Gulf War; the Coal Region of Pennsylvania, which is a historical region as well as a cultural, physical, and natural resource region; the South Wales Coalfield, which like Pennsylvania's coal region is a historical, cultural, and natural region; the Kuznetsk Basin, a similarly important coal mining region in Russia; Kryvbas, the economic and iron ore mining region of Ukraine; and the James Bay Project, a large region of Quebec where one of the largest hydroelectric systems in the world has been developed.\nReligious regions.\nSometimes a region associated with a religion is given a name, like Christendom, a term with medieval and renaissance connotations of Christianity as a sort of social and political polity. The term Muslim world is sometimes used to refer to the region of the world where Islam is dominant. These broad terms are somewhat vague when used to describe regions.\nWithin some religions there are clearly defined regions. The Roman Catholic Church, the Church of England, the Eastern Orthodox Church, and others, define ecclesiastical regions with names such as diocese, eparchy, ecclesiastical provinces, and parish.\nFor example, the United States is divided into 32 Roman Catholic ecclesiastical provinces. The Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod is organized into 33 geographic \"districts\", which are subdivided into \"circuits\" (the Atlantic District (LCMS), for example). The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints uses regions similar to dioceses and parishes, but uses terms like ward and stake.\nPolitical regions.\nIn the field of political geography, regions tend to be based on political units such as sovereign states; subnational units such as administrative regions, provinces, states (in the United States), counties, townships, territories, etc.; and multinational groupings, including formally defined units such as the European Union, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and NATO, as well as informally defined regions such as the Third World, Western Europe, and the Middle East.\nAdministrative regions.\nThe word \"region\" is taken from the Latin \"regio\" (derived from \"regere\", 'to rule'), and a number of countries have borrowed the term as the formal name for a type of subnational entity (e.g., the , used in Chile). In English, the word is also used as the conventional translation for equivalent terms in other languages (e.g., the \"\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c\" (\"oblast\"), used in Russia alongside a broader term \"\u0440\u0435\u0433\u0438\u043e\u043d\").\nThe following countries use the term \"region\" (or its cognate) as the name of a type of subnational administrative unit:\nThe Canadian province of Qu\u00e9bec also uses the \"administrative region\" (\"r\u00e9gion administrative\").\nRegions of England (not the United Kingdom as a whole) used to be administrative units until 2011. Since then they're only used for statistical purposes.\nScotland had local government regions from 1975 to 1996.\nIn Spain the official name of the autonomous community of Murcia is \"Regi\u00f3n de Murcia\". Also, some single-province autonomous communities such as Madrid use the term \"regi\u00f3n\" interchangeably with \"comunidad aut\u00f3noma\".\nTwo l\u00e4n (counties) in Sweden are officially called 'regions': Sk\u00e5ne and V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland, and there is currently a controversial proposal to divide the rest of Sweden into large regions, replacing the current counties.\nThe government of the Philippines uses the term \"region\" (in Filipino, ) when it is necessary to group provinces, the primary administrative subdivision of the country. This is also the case in Brazil, which groups its primary administrative divisions (\"estados\"; \"states\") into \"grandes regi\u00f5es\" (greater regions) for statistical purposes, while Russia uses \"\u044d\u043a\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u044b\" (economic regions) in a similar way, as does Romania and Venezuela.\nThe government of Singapore makes use of the term \"region\" for its own administrative purposes.\nThe following countries use an administrative subdivision conventionally referred to as a region in English:\nChina has five \u81ea\u6cbb\u533a (\"z\u00eczh\u00ecq\u016b\") and two \u7279\u5225\u884c\u653f\u5340 (or \u7279\u522b\u884c\u653f\u533a; \"t\u00e8bi\u00e9x\u00edngzh\u00e8ngq\u016b\"), which are translated as \"autonomous region\" and \"special administrative region\", respectively.\nLocal administrative regions.\nThere are many relatively small regions based on local government agencies such as districts, agencies, or regions. In general, they are all regions in the general sense of being bounded spatial units. Examples include electoral districts such as Washington's 6th congressional district and Tennessee's 1st congressional district; school districts such as Granite School District and Los Angeles Unified School District; economic districts such as the Reedy Creek Improvement District; metropolitan areas such as the Seattle metropolitan area, and metropolitan districts such as the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago, the Las Vegas-Clark County Library District, the Metropolitan Police Service of Greater London, as well as other local districts like the York Rural Sanitary District, the Delaware River Port Authority, the Nassau County Soil and Water Conservation District, and C-TRAN.\nTraditional or informal regions.\nThe traditional territorial divisions of some countries are also commonly rendered in English as \"regions\". These informal divisions do not form the basis of the modern administrative divisions of these countries, but still define and delimit local regional identity and sense of belonging. Examples are:\nFunctional regions.\nFunctional regions are usually understood to be the areas organised by the horizontal functional relations (flows, interactions) that are maximised within a region and minimised across its borders so that the principles of internal cohesiveness and external separation regarding spatial interactions are met (see, for instance, Farmer and Fotheringham, 2011; Klapka, Halas, 2016; Smart, 1974). A functional region is not an abstract spatial concept, but to a certain extent it can be regarded as a reflection of the spatial behaviour of individuals in a geographic space. \nThe functional region is conceived as a general concept while its inner structure, inner spatial flows, and interactions need not necessarily show any regular pattern, only selfcontainment. The concept of self-containment remains the only crucial defining characteristic of a functional region. Nodal regions, functional urban regions, daily urban systems, local labour-market areas (LLMAs), or travel-to-work areas (TTWAs) are considered to be special instances of a general functional region that need to fulfil some specific conditions regarding, for instance, the character of the region-organising interaction or the presence of urban cores, (Halas et al., 2015).\nMilitary regions.\nIn military usage, a region is shorthand for the name of a military formation larger than an Army Group and smaller than a Theater. The full name of the military formation is Army Region. The size of an Army Region can vary widely but is generally somewhere between about 1 million and 3 million soldiers. Two or more Army Regions could make up a Theater. An Army Region is typically commanded by a full General (US four stars), a Field Marshal or General of the Army (US five stars), or Generalissimo (Soviet Union); and in the US Armed Forces an Admiral (typically four stars) may also command a region. Due to the large size of this formation, its use is rarely employed. Some of the very few examples of an Army Region are each of the Eastern, Western, and southern (mostly in Italy) fronts in Europe during World War II. The military map unit symbol for this echelon of formation (see Military organization and APP-6A) is identified with six Xs.\nMedia geography.\nMedia geography is a spatio-temporal understanding, brought through different gadgets of media, nowadays, media became inevitable at different proportions and everyone supposed to consumed at different gravity. The spatial attributes are studied with the help of media outputs in shape of images which are contested in nature and pattern as well where politics is inseparable. Media geography is giving spatial understanding of mediated image.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The committee has its headquarters in Brussels.\nReasons given for this include:\nSome nation states which have historically had a strong centralized administration have transferred political power to the regions. Examples of this include the current negotiations in France concerning increased autonomy for Corsica. Some other states have traditionally had strong regions, such as the Federal Republic of Germany or the autonomous communities of Spain; yet others have been structured on the basis of national and municipal government with little in between. During the United Kingdom's membership of the EU, the term 'region' also included England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland which are formally referred to as countries by the British government.\nCompetence.\nRegional and local authorities elect delegates to the Committee of the Regions. The committee is a consultative body, and is asked for its opinion by the council or the commission on new policies and legislation in the following areas:\nOn certain issues it works in partnership with the Economic and Social Committee.\nPolitical influence.\nThe politics of regionalism has also had an impact at the pan-European level. The regions of Europe had lobbied for an increased say in EU affairs, especially the German L\u00e4nder. This resulted in the creation by the Maastricht Treaty of the Committee of the Regions, and provision for member states to be represented in the council by ministers from their regional governments.\nThe Council of Europe also has a congress of local and regional authorities, similar to the EU's Committee of the Regions.\nStrengthening economic competition between communities further supports the creation of authentic regions within the EU and almost all EU member states recently have or currently are re-organizing their administration to create competitive EU regions. \nOften these regions better reflect culture and identity and a sense of common interests.\nOf the major organisations representing the regions of Europe, the Assembly of European Regions (AER) is the largest. Established in 1985, the organisation now brings together over 270 regions from 33 countries, along with 16 interregional associations, across wider Europe.\nApart from playing a key role as the regions' political voice on the European stage, AER is a forum for interregional cooperation in numerous areas of regional competence, including economic development, social policy, public health, culture, education and youth. The organisation is also a key defender of the subsidiarity principle in Europe, lobbying for its inclusion in the EU treaties and demanding recognition of the word in dictionaries via the worldwide \"Subsidiarity is a word\" movement.\nOutside EU institutions, the Council of European Municipalities and Regions (CEMR-CCRE) is the largest organisation of local and regional government in Europe; its members are national associations of towns, municipalities and regions from over 35 countries. Together these associations represent some 100,000 local and regional authorities.\nCEMR works to promote a united Europe that is based on local and regional self-government and democracy. To achieve this goal it endeavours to shape the future of Europe by enhancing local and regional contribution, to influence European law and policy, to exchange experience at local and regional level and to cooperate with partners in other parts of the world.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The borough had a population of 225,262 at the 2021 census. \nLuton is on the River Lea, about north-west of London. The town's foundation dates to the sixth century as a Saxon settlement on the river, from which Luton derives its name. Luton is recorded in the Domesday Book as \"Loitone\" and \"Lintone\". One of the largest churches in Bedfordshire, St Mary's Church, was built in the 12th century. There are local museums which explore Luton's history in Wardown Park and Stockwood Park.\nLuton was once known for hatmaking and became a centre for the British motor industry with the establishment of the Vauxhall Motors factory in 1905. Car production at the Luton plant continued until 2002. Thereafter, the site focused on commercial vehicle manufacturing which in turn came to an end in 2025. The head office of Vauxhall Motors is located in the village of Chalton, on the northern edge of the borough. London Luton Airport opened in 1938 and is now one of Britain's major airports, with three railway stations also in the town. The University of Bedfordshire was created from a merger with the University of Luton; two of its campuses are in Luton. Since 1997, Luton Borough Council has been a unitary authority, performing all local government functions in the borough.\nLuton Town Football Club, nicknamed the \"Hatters\", due to the town's connection to hatmaking, has had several spells in the top flight of the English league as well as a Football League Cup triumph in 1988. They play at Kenilworth Road, their home since 1905; planning permission for a new larger stadium was approved in 2019. Luton International Carnival, the largest one-day carnival in Europe, is held on the day before the last Monday in May; the Saint Patrick's festival is held on the weekend nearest to Saint Patrick's Day as there is a large Irish community in Luton. The town also has a large Pakistani community which, along with the Irish, were attracted to employment at the Vauxhall car plant. Luton Hoo is an English country house, estate and Grade I listed building originally designed by Scottish architect Robert Adam but later transformed to the designs of Robert Smirke.\nHistory.\nLuton is believed to have been founded by the Anglo-Saxons sometime in the 6th century. Its name first appears in the 8th century as \"Lygetun\", meaning \"town on the River Lea\".\nThe Domesday Book records Luton as \"Loitone\" and as \"Lintone\". Agriculture dominated the local economy at that time, and the town's population was around 700 to 800. \n \nIn 1121 Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester started work on St Mary's Church in the centre of the town. The work was completed by 1137. A motte-and-bailey castle which gives its name to the modern Castle Street was built in 1139 but demolished by 1154.\nThe hat making industry began in the 17th century and became synonymous with the town.\nThe town grew: in 1801 the population was 3,095, but by 1850 it was over 10,000 and by 1901 it was almost 39,000.\nNewspaper printing arrived in the town in 1854. The first public cemetery was opened in the same year and Luton was made a borough in 1876.\nLuton's hat trade reached its peak in the 1930s, but severely declined after the Second World War and was replaced by other industries.\nIn 1907, Vauxhall Motors opened the largest car plant in the United Kingdom in Luton, during the Second World War, it built Churchill tanks as part of the war effort. Despite heavy camouflage, the factory made Luton a target for the Luftwaffe and the town suffered a number of air raids. 107 died and there was extensive damage to the town (over 1,500 homes were damaged or destroyed).\nThe original town hall was destroyed in 1919 during Peace Day celebrations at the end of the First World War. Dr. John G. Dony, author of \"The Flora of Bedfordshire\", told his history students (he taught at Luton Grammar, predecessor of Luton Sixth Form College) in the 1950s that he had broken the last intact window of the old town hall during the 1919 riots. Local people, including many ex-servicemen, were unhappy with unemployment and had been refused the use of a local park to hold celebratory events. They stormed the town hall, setting it alight (\"see Luton Town Hall\"). A replacement building was completed in 1936.\nLuton Borough Corporation had provided the borough with electricity since the early twentieth century from Luton power station, located adjacent to the railway. Upon nationalisation of the electricity industry in 1948 ownership passed to the British Electricity Authority and later to the Central Electricity Generating Board. Electricity connections to the national grid rendered the 23 megawatt (MW) coal and latterly oil-fired power station redundant. The station had a single chimney and two reinforced concrete cooling towers. The power station closed in 1968; in its final year of operation it delivered 3,192 MWh of electricity to the borough.\nLuton Airport opened in 1938, owned and operated by the council. It is now one of the largest employers in the area.\nThe pre-war years, were something of an economic boom for Luton, as new industries grew and prospered. New private and council housing was built in the 1920s and 1930s, with Luton starting to incorporate nearby villages Leagrave, Limbury and Stopsley between 1928 and 1933.\nPost-war, a number of substantial estates of council housing were built, notably at Farley Hill, Stopsley, Limbury, Marsh Farm and Leagrave (Hockwell Ring). The Marsh Farm area of the town was developed in the mid to late 1960s as a large council housing estate, mostly to house the overspill population from London. However, the estate gained a reputation for high levels of crime, poverty and unemployment, which culminated in a riot on the estate in July 1992 and another more serious riot three years later.\nThe partial closure of the Vauxhall manufacturing plant in 2002 had negative effects for Luton, leading to increased unemployment and deprivation. In 2024, Stellantis (owner of the Vauxhall marque) announced plans to close its operation in Luton.\nGovernance.\nThere is just one tier of local government covering Luton: Luton Borough Council, which has been a unitary authority since 1997, being a district council which also performs the functions of a county council. There are no civil parishes in the borough. The borough remains part of the ceremonial county of Bedfordshire.\nAs of the 2024 UK general election, Luton is represented in Parliament by Sarah Owen who holds Luton North and Rachel Hopkins who holds Luton South, both for Labour.\nAdministrative history.\nLuton was an ancient parish in the Flitt hundred. The parish was the largest in Bedfordshire by area, and was subdivided into five hamlets or townships: Hyde, Leagrave, Limbury, Stopsley, and a Luton township covering the central part of the parish including the town itself. The Luton township was made a local board district in 1850. The local board was the town's first elected local authority; previously it had been administered by the parish vestry.\nThe town was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1876. Later in 1876 the new borough council was granted a coat of arms. The wheatsheaf was used on the crest to represent agriculture and the supply of straw used in the local hatmaking industry (the straw plaiting industry was brought to Luton by a group of Scots under the protection of Sir John Napier of Luton Hoo). The bee is traditionally the emblem of industry and the hive represents the straw plaiting industry for which Luton was famous. The rose is from the arms of the Napier family, whereas the thistle is a symbol for Scotland. An alternative suggestion is that the rose was a national emblem, and the thistle represents the Marquess of Bute, who formerly owned the Manor of Luton Hoo.\nThe Local Government Act 1894 directed that parishes could no longer straddle borough boundaries, and so the ancient parish was split into a Luton parish covering the same area as the borough and a Luton Rural parish covering the area outside the borough. Luton Rural was abolished in 1896 and its area divided into the four parishes of Hyde, Leagrave, Limbury and Stopsley. In 1928 the Leagrave and Limbury parishes were both abolished and their areas absorbed into the borough of Luton; Stopsley was similarly absorbed in 1933. Hyde remains a separate parish, now forming part of Central Bedfordshire.\nLuton was made a county borough in 1964, making it independent from Bedfordshire County Council. It was redesignated as a non-metropolitan district in 1974, making it once more subordinate to the county council. In 1997 the borough council was made a unitary authority, regaining its independence from the county council (which was subsequently abolished in 2009).\nGeography.\nThe town is situated in a gap at the far east of the Chiltern Hills and is built on the River Lea, which Luton is named after. The town is the most populous settlement in Bedfordshire followed by Bedford. Luton forms a conurbation with the town of Dunstable, which is located to the west on the opposite side of the M1 motorway, and also includes Houghton Regis.\nLuton is situated north-west of London, north-west of St Albans, west of Stevenage, north-east of Aylesbury, south of Bedford, south-east of Milton Keynes and 39 miles south-west of Cambridge.The source of the River Lea, part of the Thames Valley drainage basin, is in the Leagrave area of the town. The Great Bramingham Wood surrounds this area. It is classified as ancient woodland; records mention the wood at least 400 years ago.\nLuton is located in a break in the eastern part of the Chiltern Hills. The Chilterns are a mixture of chalk from the Cretaceous period (about 66 \u2013 145\u00a0million years ago) and deposits laid at the southernmost points of the ice sheet during the last ice age (the Warden Hill area can be seen from much of the town).\nBedfordshire had a reputation for brick making but the industry is now significantly reduced. The brickworks at Stopsley took advantage of the clay deposits in the east of the town.\nThere are few routes through the hilly area for some miles, this has led to several major roads (including the M1 and the A6) and a major rail-link being constructed through the town.\nClimate.\nLuton has a temperate marine climate, like much of the British Isles, with generally light precipitation throughout the year. The weather is very changeable from day to day and the warming influence of the Gulf Stream makes the region mild for its latitude. The average total annual rainfall is with rain falling on 117 days of the year.\nThe local climate around Luton is differentiated somewhat from much of South East England due to its position in the Chiltern Hills, meaning it tends to be 1\u20132 degrees Celsius cooler than the surrounding towns \u2013 often flights at Luton airport, lying above sea level, will be suspended when marginal snow events occur, while airports at lower elevations, such as Heathrow, at above sea level, continue to function. Absolute temperature extremes recorded at Rothamsted Research Station, south south east of Luton town centre and at a similar elevation range from in December 1981 and in January 1963 to in July 2019 and in August 1990 and July 2006. Records for Rothamsted date back to 1901.\nDemography.\nThe 2021 United Kingdom census showed that the borough had a population of 225,262, a 10.9% increase from the previous census in 2011 and a 22.2% increase compared with 2001. In 2021, 52,566 residents (23% of the total) were aged under 16, 146,330 (65%) were aged 16 to 64, and 26,363 (12%) were aged 65 or over.\nLocal inhabitants are known as \"Lutonians\".\nEthnicity.\nLuton has seen several waves of immigration. In the early part of the 20th century, migrants from Ireland and Scotland came to the town. These were followed by South Asian and Afro-Caribbean immigrants. More recently immigrants from European countries such as Albania have made Luton their home. As a result of this Luton has a diverse ethnic mix, with a significant population of Asian descent, mainly Pakistani (41,143 residents, 18.3%) and Bangladeshi (20,630, 9.2%). People in Asian ethnic groups accounted for 86% of Luton's Muslim population in 2021.\nAs of the 2021 census, the White British (White English, Scottish, Welsh, and Northern Irish) population of Luton comprised less than a third of the total (31.8%), the twelfth lowest proportion out of 318 local authorities in England and Wales and the second lowest (after Slough) outside of London. Overall, 45.2% of Luton's population in 2021 was White (including non-British White people), down from 54.7% in 2011.\nIn 2011 81% of the population of Luton defined themselves as British.\nReligion.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAt the 2021 census, the religious affiliation of Luton was as follows:\nEconomy.\nLuton's economy has traditionally been focused on several different areas of industry, including car manufacturing, engineering and millinery. However, today, Luton is moving towards a service based economy mainly in the retail and the airport sectors, although there is still a focus on light industry in the town.\nNotable firms with headquarters in Luton include:\nNotable firms with offices in Luton include:\nLuton's post-war and more recent industrial decline has been compared to that of similar towns in northern England.\nEmployment.\nOf the town's working population (classified 16\u201374 years of age by the Office for National Statistics), 63% are employed. This figure includes students, the self-employed and those who are in part-time employment. 11% are retired, 8% look after the family or take care of the home and 5% are unemployed.\nTransport.\nLuton is less than north of the centre of London, giving it good links with the City and other parts of the country via rail and major roads such as the M1 (which serves the town from junctions 10 and 11) and the A6.\nThe town has three railway stations: Luton, Leagrave and Luton Airport Parkway that are served by East Midlands Railway and Thameslink services.\nLuton is also home to London Luton Airport, one of the major feeder airports for London and the south-east. A light metro people mover track, Luton DART, opened in 2023, linking the airport and Luton Airport Parkway railway station.\nA network of bus services run by Arriva Shires &amp; Essex, Grant Palmer and Centrebus serves the urban area of Luton and Dunstable. A bus rapid transit route opened in 2013, called the \"Luton to Dunstable Busway\", connecting the town with the airport, Dunstable and Houghton Regis. Hertfordshire-based bus operator Uno also run buses on their 'Dragonfly' 610 route to Hatfield, Potters Bar and Cockforsters\nLuton is also served by a large taxi network. As a unitary authority, Luton Borough Council is responsible for the local highways and public transport in the borough and licensing of taxis.\nEducation.\nLuton is one of the main locations of the University of Bedfordshire. A large campus of the university is in Luton town centre, with a smaller campus based on the edge of town in Putteridge Bury, an old Victorian manor house. The other campuses of the university are located in Bedford, Milton Keynes and Aylesbury.\nThe town is home to Luton Sixth Form College and Barnfield College. Both have been awarded Learning &amp; Skills Beacon Status by the Department for Children, Schools and Families.\nLuton's schools and colleges had also been earmarked for major investment in the government scheme Building Schools for the Future programme, which intends to renew and refit buildings in institutes across the country. Luton is in the third wave of this long-term programme with work intending to start in 2009. Some schools were rebuilt before the programme was scrapped by the coalition government.\nThere are 98 educational institutes in Luton \u2013 seven nurseries, 56 primary schools (9 voluntary-aided, 2 special requirements), 13 secondary schools (1 voluntary-aided, 1 special requirements), four further educational institutes and four other educational institutes.\nCulture.\nArchitecture.\nThe town contains 92 listed buildings.\nLeisure and entertainment.\nLuton International Carnival.\nLuton International Carnival is the largest one-day carnival in Europe. It usually takes place on the late May Bank Holiday. Crowds can reach 150,000 on each occasion.\nThe procession starts at Wardown Park and makes its way down New Bedford Road, around the town centre via St George's Square, back down New Bedford Road and finishes back at Wardown Park. There are music stages and stalls around the town centre and at Wardown Park.\nLuton is home to the UK Centre for Carnival Arts (UKCCA), the country's first purpose-built facility of its kind.\nLuton St Patrick's Festival.\nThe festival celebrating the patron saint of Ireland St Patrick and organised by Luton Irish Forum, is held on the weekend nearest to 17 March. In its 20th year in 2019, the festival includes a parade, market stalls and music stands as well as Irish themed events.\nOrange Order.\nThe Luton Sons of William Loyal Orange Lodge No. 1002 was established in the 1960's. It is a part of the Orange Order and is governed by the Grand Orange Lodge of England. They are a Protestant fraternity that hold regular meetings and participate in Orange walks. The name \"Sons of William\" refers to William III, victor of the Battle of the Boyne. The Luton &amp; Bedford Drumming Club is a part of the community. They promote Ulster Scots culture and heritage within the area. The club play traditional lambeg and Ulster rope drums and march in parades. Formed in 2005, the inaugural parade was in September of that year.\nLuton Mela.\nThe first Luton Mel\u0101 took place in August 2000 and has developed into one of the most significant and well attended South Asian cultural events in the eastern region.\nCity of Culture bid and pilot year.\nAs a part of Luton Borough Council's 2017-2027 arts and culture development programme, a series of events titled \"People Power Passion\" were held in 2019 as a pilot for their 2025 City of Culture bid. This included a centennial commemoration of the Luton Peace Day Riots.\nThe bid was dropped in early 2020 as a result of low attendance, and the budget was redirected towards other art projects.\nTheatre and performing arts.\nLuton is home to the Library Theatre, a 238-seat theatre located on the 3rd floor of the town's Central Library. The theatre's programme consists of local amateur dramatic societies, pantomime, children's theatre (on Saturday mornings) and one night shows of touring theatre companies.\nLuton is also home to the Hat Factory, originally as its name suggests, this arts centre was in fact a real hat factory. The Hat Factory is a combined arts venue in the centre of Luton. It opened in 2003 and since then has been the area's main provider of contemporary theatre, dance and music. The venue provides live music, club nights, theatre, dance, films, children's activities, workshops, classes and gallery exhibitions.\nMedia.\nNewspapers.\nThe Luton News, now online as Luton Today. Former journalists include comedy screenwriter David Renwick, author of One Foot in the Grave.\nRecreation.\nParks and open spaces.\nLuton has a variety of parks ranging from district parks, neighbourhood parks, local open space and leisure gardens.\nBrantwood Park.\nIn the 1880s, the land now known as Brantwood Park was an open field on the south side of Dallow. The site was purchased by the Town Council in 1894 for use as a recreation ground and there is reference to it as 'West Ward Recreation Ground' in a 1911-year book. It is reported as being one of the first two recreation grounds in Luton; the other being East Ward Recreation Ground, now known as Manor Park.\nKidney Wood.\nKidney Wood is ancient semi-natural woodland on the southern edge of Luton that has been identified as a County Wildlife Site. The wood was purchased by Luton Borough Council as an area of public open space. The council seeks to maintain and enhance the nature conservation interest of Kidney Wood, including its habitats while allowing public access for informal recreation including play. Kidney Wood includes a way marked nature trail and play dells.\nMemorial Park.\nSir Julius Wernher purchased the Luton Hoo Estate and the Manor of Luton from Madame de Falbe around 1903. He carried out substantial renovation works to the Manor and grounds. On his death in 1912 the estate passed to Lady Ludlow. Lady Ludlow presented the Park to the people of Luton on 12 June 1920, in memory of her son Alex Piggott Werner, who was killed in action during the First World War. The site is officially named Luton Hoo Memorial Park. Council records state that the area was purchased under the Statutory Powers of the Public Health Acts.\nStockwood Park.\nStockwood Park is a large municipal park near Junction 10 of the M1. Located in the park is Stockwood Discovery Centre, a free museum that houses Luton local social history, archaeology and geology. The collection of rural crafts and trades held at Stockwood Discovery Centre was amassed by Thomas Wyatt Bagshawe, who was a notable local historian and a leading authority on folk life. The park has an athletics track, an 18-hole golf course, several rugby and football pitches and areas of open space. Stockwood park is also home to stockwood park RFC, a local amateur rugby team. The park was originally the estate and grounds to Stockwood house, which was demolished in 1964. The museum includes the Mossman Collection of horse-drawn vehicles, which is the largest and most significant vehicle collection of its kind in the country, including originals from the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries.\nWardown Park.\nWardown Park is situated on the River Lea in Luton. The park has sporting facilities, is home to the Wardown Park Museum and contains formal gardens. The park is located between \"Old Bedford Road\" and the A6, \"New Bedford Road\" and is within walking distance of the town centre. The park houses Wardown House Museum and Gallery, previously known as Luton Museum and Art Gallery, in a large Victorian mansion. The museum collection focuses on the traditional crafts and industry of Luton and Bedfordshire, notably lace making and hatmaking. There are samples of local lace from as early as the 17th century.\nShopping.\nThe main shopping area in Luton is centred on the Mall Luton. Built in the 1960s/1970s and opened as an Arndale Centre, construction of the shopping centre led to the demolition of a number of the older buildings in the town centre, including the Plait Halls (a Victorian covered market building with an iron and glass roof). Shops and businesses in the remaining streets, particularly in the roads around Cheapside and in High Town, have been in decline ever since. George Street, on the south side of the Arndale, was pedestrianised in the 1990s.\nThe shopping centre had some construction and re-design work done to it over the 2011/12 period, with a new square built to be used for leisure events, as well as a number of new food restaurants. Contained within the main shopping centre is the market, which contains butchers, fishmongers, fruit and veg, hairdressers, tattoo parlours, ice cream, a flower stall, T-shirt printing and the market's original sewing shop for clothes alterations and repairs as well as eating places.\nAnother major shopping area is Bury Park where there are shops catering to Luton's ethnic minorities.\nSport.\nLuton has a wide range of sports clubs. It is the home town of Luton Town Football Club which in May 2023 achieved promotion to the English Premier League for the first time in their history which also includes several spells in the top flight of the English league as well as a League Cup triumph in 1988. They play at Kenilworth Road, their home since 1905, with a new larger capacity stadium known as Power Court under construction. Their nickname, 'The Hatters', dates back to when Luton had a substantial millinery industry, and their logo is based on the town's coat of arms.\nBedfordshire County Cricket Club is based at Wardown Park and is one of the county clubs which make up the Minor Counties in the English domestic cricket structure, representing the historic county of Bedfordshire. Luton Rugby Club are a local rugby union club based on Newlands Road, by the M1 motorway just outside Stockwood Park, who play in London 1 North. Speedway racing was once staged at Luton Stadium from 1934 to 1937.\nTwin towns.\nLuton participates in international town twinning; its partners are:\nNotable people.\nPeople who were born in Luton or are associated with the town.\nBy birth.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nBy association.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFreedom of the Borough.\nThe following people and military units have received the Freedom of the Borough of Luton.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His pontificate occurred during the Eastern Roman domination of the papacy. He was the fourth former \"apocrisiarius\" to Constantinople to be elected pope.\nApocrisiariat.\nSabinian was born at Blera (Bieda) near Viterbo. He had been sent by Pope Gregory I, who had a high opinion of him, as \"apocrisiarius\" to the imperial court in Constantinople. In 595, Gregory was angered by Sabinian's lack of resolution in discussion with Emperor Maurice about the disputed assumption of the title \"ecumenical patriarch\" by John IV of Constantinople. Sabinian was then recalled and sent on a mission to Gaul the same year. He returned to Rome in 597.\nPontificate.\nSabinian was elected to succeed Gregory probably in March 604, but had to wait for imperial ratification before being consecrated in September. During his pontificate, Sabinian was seen as a counterfoil to Gregory I. The \"Liber pontificalis\" praises him for \"filling the church with clergy\", in contrast to Gregory, who tended to fill ecclesiastical positions with monks.\nSabinian incurred unpopularity by his unseasonable economies, although the \"Liber pontificalis\" states that he distributed grain during a famine at Rome under his pontificate. Whereas Gregory distributed grain to the Roman populace as invasion loomed, when the danger had passed Sabinian sold it to them. Because he was unable or unwilling to allow the people to have the grain for little or nothing, there grew up in later times a number of legends in which his predecessor was represented punishing him for avarice. Sabinian died 22 February 606. His funeral procession through the city had to change course to avoid hostile Romans.\nOnofrio Panvinio, in his 1557 \"Epitome pontificum Romanorum\", attributes to Sabinian the introduction of the custom of ringing bells at the canonical hours and the celebration of the Eucharist, hence expressions such as \"o'clock\" (Latin \"clocca\": a bell). The first attribution of this was in Guillaume Durand's thirteenth-century \"Rationale Divinorum Officiorum\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He inherited control of the warlord regime established by his elder brother, Sun Ce, in 200. He declared formal independence and ruled from November 222 to May 229 as the King of Wu and from May 229 to May 252 as the Emperor of Wu. Unlike his rivals Cao Cao and Liu Bei, Sun Quan was much younger and governed his state mostly separate of politics and ideology. He is sometimes portrayed as neutral considering he adopted a flexible foreign policy between his two rivals with the goal of pursuing the greatest interests for the country.\nSun Quan was born while his father Sun Jian served as the adjutant of Xiapi County. After Sun Jian's death in the early 190s, he and his family lived at various cities on the lower Yangtze, until Sun Ce carved out a warlord regime in the Jiangdong region, based on his own followers and a number of local clan allegiances. When Sun Ce was assassinated by the retainers of Xu Gong in 200, the 18-year-old Sun Quan inherited the lands southeast of the Yangtze River from his brother. His administration proved to be relatively stable in those early years as Sun Jian and Sun Ce's most senior officers, such as Zhou Yu, Zhang Zhao, Zhang Hong, and Cheng Pu supported the succession. Thus throughout the 200s, Sun Quan, under the tutelage of his able advisers, continued to build up his strength along the Yangtze River. In early 208, his forces finally won complete victory over Huang Zu, a military leader under Liu Biao, who dominated the middle Yangtze. Huang Zu was killed in battle.\nIn winter of that year, the northern warlord Cao Cao led an army of approximately 220,000 to conquer the south to complete the reunification of China. Two distinct factions emerged at his court on how to handle the situation. One, led by Zhang Zhao, urged surrender whilst the other, led by Zhou Yu and Lu Su, opposed capitulation. Eventually, Sun Quan decided to oppose Cao Cao in the middle Yangtze with his superior riverine forces. Allied with Liu Bei and employing the combined strategies of Zhou Yu and Huang Gai, they defeated Cao Cao decisively at the Battle of Red Cliffs.\nIn late 220, Cao Pi, King of Wei, Cao Cao's son and successor, seized the throne and proclaimed himself to be the Emperor of China, ending and succeeding the nominal rule of the Han dynasty. At first Sun Quan nominally served as a Wei vassal with the Wei-created title of King of Wu, but after Cao Pi demanded that he send his son Sun Deng as a hostage to the Wei capital Luoyang and he refused. In November 222, he declared himself independent by changing his era name. It was not until May 229 that he formally declared himself emperor.\nAfter the death of his original crown prince, Sun Deng, two opposing factions supporting different potential successors slowly emerged. When Sun He succeeded Sun Deng as the new crown prince, he was supported by Lu Xun and Zhuge Ke, while his rival Sun Ba was supported by Quan Cong and Bu Zhi and their clans. Over a prolonged internal power struggle, numerous officials were executed, and Sun Quan harshly settled the conflict between the two factions by exiling Sun He and forcing Sun Ba to commit suicide. Sun Quan died in May 252 at the age of 70 (by East Asian reckoning). He enjoyed the longest reign among all the founders of the Three Kingdoms and was succeeded by his son, Sun Liang.\nThe \"Records of the Three Kingdoms\" describes Sun Quan as a tall man with bright eyes and oblong face. He was known as a wise and outgoing man who was fond of making jokes and playing tricks. Because of his skill in valuing the strength of his subordinates and avoiding their shortcomings, as well as treating them like his family, Sun Quan was able to delegate authority to capable figures. This primary strength served him well in gaining the support of the common people and surrounding himself with capable generals.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEarly life and career.\nThe \"Records of the Three Kingdoms\" mentioned that Sun Jian was a descendant of Sun Wu (better known as Sun Tzu), a militarist in the Spring and Autumn period and the author of \"The Art of War\". Sun Quan was born in 182, while his father Sun Jian was still a low-ranking official of the Han dynasty. He was the second son of Sun Jian and his wife Lady Wu; he had two younger full brothers, Sun Yi and Sun Kuang, and a younger full sister, whose identity is unrecorded.\nIn 184, two years after Sun Quan was born, the Yellow Turban Rebellion led by Zhang Jue broke out across the country. Sun Jian joined the general Zhu Jun to quell the rebellion and allocated his family to stay in Shouchun. When Sun Quan's elder brother Sun Ce met Zhou Yu in 189, Sun Ce decided to take his mother Lady Wu and younger brothers to Shu County, Zhou Yu's hometown. There, the Sun family became acquainted with Zhou Yu.\nAfter Sun Jian's death in 191, the Sun family moved again to Jiangdu in order to mourn him. Two years later, Sun Ce decided to join Yuan Shu's army so he ordered L\u00fc Fan to take his family members to his maternal uncle Wu Jing's home in Danyang. However, Liu Yao, the Governor () of Yang Province became angry when Sun Ce and Yuan Shu defeated Lu Kang, the administrator of Lujiang in 194. He felt worried that they would attack him further so he drove Wu Jing away from Danyang. Since Sun Quan and his mother were still in Liu Yao's territory, Zhu Zhi sent people to rescue them. Sun Quan and his mother moved to Fuling later.\nWhen Sun Ce defeated Liu Yao in 195, he ordered Chen Bao to bring his family back to Danyang. As Sun Quan grew up, he served his brother during the conquests of the region south of the Yangtze River. He was made Yangxian County magistrate in 196, at the age of 14, and continued to rise through the ranks as his brother gave him more and more important tasks. Since he was passionate about gathering the retainers like Pan Zhang and Zhou Tai, his fame soon approached his father and elder brother. Zhu Ran and Hu Zong, the men he met during his schooldays, later became ministers of Eastern Wu. He was loved by his brother Sun Ce, who said that he would put his men under Sun Quan's management in the future. In 199, Sun Quan was promoted to the rank of Colonel () and followed his brother to conquer Lujiang and Yuzhang. While Cao Cao attempted to further reinforce the alliance with Sun Ce, both Sun Quan and his younger brother Sun Yi were invited to be officials in Xuchang, but they refused.\nSucceeding Sun Ce.\nIn 200, Sun Ce was mortally wounded in an assassination attempt while he was hunting. On his deathbed, he knew that his son was still too young to be considered a realistic heir, so he entrusted the 18-year-old Sun Quan to his faithful subordinates. Initially, Sun Quan mourned his brother's death so much that he couldn't stop crying, but at Zhang Zhao's behest, he dressed himself in military uniform and set out to visit the commanderies under his brother's control. Many of Sun Ce's subordinates thought that Sun Quan was too young to sustain Sun Ce's domain and wanted to leave. Particularly, Li Shu, the Administrator of Lujiang, defected to Cao Cao. Sun Quan wrote a letter to Cao Cao to state Li Shu's crime then headed his troops to defeat Li Shu and regain Lujiang.\nZhang Zhao and Zhou Yu saw special qualities in the young man and chose to stay to serve Sun Quan. Zhang Hong, whom Sun Ce had earlier sent as a liaison to the warlord Cao Cao, also returned from Cao's domain to assist Sun Quan. At Zhang Hong's request, Cao Cao, in the name of Emperor Xian who was controlled by Cao Cao at the time, commissioned Sun Quan as \"General Who Attacks Barbarians\" (), a title under which he would be known for a long time. He listened carefully to his mother Lady Wu's encouraging words, and greatly trusted Zhang Zhao and Zhang Hong with regard to civilian affairs and Zhou Yu, Cheng Pu, and L\u00fc Fan with regard to military matters. Sun Quan also sought out talented young men to serve as his personal advisors, and it was around this time that he befriended Lu Su and Zhuge Jin, who would later play prominent roles in his administration. In addition, Lu Xun, Bu Zhi, Gu Yong, Shi Yi, Yan Jun, Xu Sheng and Zhu Huan also became his men. Throughout this period and decades to come, Sun Quan's leadership would be characterised by his ability to find men of character and entrust important matters to him, and his ability to react swiftly to events.\nFor the next several years, Sun Quan was largely interested in expanding against the Shanyue, hill tribes which controlled the most southern part of China and outside the reach of the Han government, in order to ensure his realm. Sun Quan launched numerous campaigns against the Shanyue. In 206, he conquered the fortress of Shanyue in Matun and Baodun and captured more than 10,000 men. Furthermore, he gradually sought to harass and weaken Liu Biao's key subordinate, Huang Zu (who controlled the northeastern region of Liu Biao's domain) \u2013 particularly because Huang Zu had killed his father in battle. He made war on Huang Zu twice in 203 and 207. In 208, he was finally able to defeat and kill Huang Zu in battle, and as a result, he obtained most of the territory of Jiangxia. Soon after, Liu Biao died while Cao Cao was preparing a major campaign to subjugate both Liu Biao and Sun Quan under his control, precipitating a major confrontation.\nBattle of Red Cliffs.\nAt the end of 208. After Liu Biao's death, a succession struggle for his domain came into being, between his sons Liu Qi and younger son Liu Cong, whom Liu Biao's second wife Lady Cai favoured (because he had married her niece). After Huang Zu's death, Liu Qi was therefore given Huang's post as the governor of Jiangxia Commandery. Liu Cong therefore succeeded Liu Biao after his death, and Liu Qi was displeased and considered, but did not carry out, an attack against his brother. Nevertheless, Liu Cong, in fear of having to fight Cao Cao and his brother on two fronts, surrendered to Cao Cao against the advice of Liu Biao's key ally Liu Bei. Liu Bei, unwilling to submit to Cao Cao, fled south. Cao caught up to him and crushed his forces, but Liu Bei escaped with his life; he fled to Dangyang. Cao Cao took over most of Jing Province, and appeared set on finally unifying the empire.\nSun Quan was well aware of Cao Cao's intentions, and he quickly entered into an alliance with Liu Bei and Liu Qi to prepare for an attack by Cao. Cao Cao wrote Sun Quan with a letter intending to intimidate, and in face of Cao's overwhelming force (estimated to be about 220,000 men, although Cao claimed 800,000, against Sun's 30,000 and the Lius' combined force of 10,000), many of Sun's subordinates, including Zhang Zhao, advocated surrender. Sun Quan refused, under advice from Zhou Yu and Lu Su that Cao Cao would surely not tolerate him even if he surrendered.\nSun Quan put Zhou Yu in charge of his 30,000 men, largely stationed on naval ships, and Zhou set up a defensive position in conjunction with Liu Bei, whose army was stationed on land. About this time, there was a plague developing in Cao Cao's forces which significantly weakened it. Zhou Yu set up a trap where he pretended to be punishing his subordinate Huang Gai, and Huang pretended to surrender to Cao Cao in fear. Zhou Yu then sent ships under Huang Gai's command to pretend to surrender and, as Huang's ships approached Cao Cao's fleet, they were set aflame to assault Cao's fleet, and Cao's fleet was largely destroyed by fire. Cao Cao led his forces to escape on land, but much of the force was destroyed by Sun Quan and Liu Bei's land forces.\nUneasy alliance with Liu Bei.\nImmediately after Cao Cao withdrew, Sun Quan took over the northern half of Jing Province. Liu Bei marched south and took over the southern half. The Sun-Liu alliance was further cemented by a marriage of Sun Quan's younger sister, Lady Sun, to Liu Bei. Zhou Yu was suspicious of Liu Bei's intentions, however, and suggested to Sun Quan that Liu be seized and put under house arrest (albeit be very well-treated) and his forces be merged into Sun's; Sun Quan, believing that Liu Bei's forces would rebel if he did that, declined. Sun Quan did agree to Zhou Yu's plans to consider attacking Liu Zhang and Zhang Lu (who controlled the modern southern Shaanxi) to try to take over their territories, but after Zhou Yu died in 210, the plans were abandoned. However, Sun Quan was able to persuade the warlords in Jiao Province to submit to him, and they became part of his domain. He then yielded parts of northern Jing Province to Liu Bei as well, agreeing with Liu that the south was insufficient to supply his troops. At the same time, Sun Quan appointed his subordinate Bu Zhi as the Inspector () of Jiao Province to replace Lai Gong. Shi Xie led his followers to submit to Bu Zhi's governorship. Sun Quan took over the entire Jiao Province.\nIn 211, Sun Quan moves his headquarters from Dantu to the city of Moling, and in the next year he rebuilt the walls and renamed the city Jianye. This new location gave him better control of the Yangtze River and better communications with his various other commanders. He also constructed fortresses at Ruxu, since L\u00fc Meng anticipated an invasion there from Cao Cao.\nThe invasion L\u00fc Meng expected came at the start of 213. Sun Quan personally led the army there to resist Cao Cao and relied heavily on the fortresses L\u00fc Meng built to give his soldiers strong positions from which to defend. At one point, Cao Cao tried to send his navy across the river to break Sun Quan's lines, but Sun Quan's own ships surrounded them and destroyed them. Due to the stalemate in the war, Sun Quan drove a big ship to enter the military camp of Cao Cao on the other side of Yangtze River to observe his enemy situation. Cao Cao was very impressed with the military discipline of his opponent so he said that he should have a child like Sun Quan and didn't launch an attack on this occasion. Sun Quan ordered people to play music on the ship and returned to his camp safely. Ultimately, L\u00fc Meng's defences held and Sun Quan wrote a letter to Cao Cao to warn that the spring rains would come a month later, Cao Cao had to take his advice and pull back.\nAfter Cao Cao's defeat at Ruxu, many people along the Yangtze River fled south to join Sun Quan. With the exception of Wan County and the immediate area, the region became abandoned. In 214, Cao Cao sent a man named Zhu Guang to Wan County with orders to revitalise the region and bring it under Cao Cao's control. Zhu Guang began extensive agricultural projects, and he also stirred up bandits and malcontents into rebellion in Sun Quan's territory. L\u00fc Meng feared that if Zhu Guang's programmes were successful, it would make Cao Cao's hold in the area unbreakable and urged for a campaign against Huan. Sun Quan followed L\u00fc Meng's strategy and used the seasonal flooding to travel to the city by boat, which allowed them to attack unexpectedly. Rather than a lengthy siege, L\u00fc Meng, Gan Ning and Ling Tong led a quick strike and broke Zhu Guang's defences, capturing the city.\nAfter Liu Bei's conquest of Yi Province, he was able to supply his troops on his own, so Sun Quan sent Lu Su as an emissary to demand for the return of Jing Province, but Liu Bei refused. Sun Quan then sent L\u00fc Meng and Ling Tong to lead 20,000 men to attack southern Jing Province and they succeeded in capturing Changsha, Guiyang, and Lingling commanderies. Meantime, Lu Su and Gan Ning advanced to Yiyang () with 10,000 men (to block Guan Yu) and took over command of the army at Lukou (). Liu Bei personally went to Gong'an County and Guan Yu led 30,000 men to Yiyang. When an all-out war was about to break out, the news that Cao Cao planned to attack Hanzhong was received by Liu Bei, and he requested for a border treaty with Sun Quan as he became worried about Cao Cao seizing Hanzhong. Liu Bei asked Sun Quan to give him back Lingling Commandery and create a diversion for Cao Cao by attacking Hefei; in return, Liu Bei ceded Changsha and Guiyang commanderies to Sun Quan, setting the new border along the Xiang River. Sun Quan's attack on Hefei was disastrous - he was nearly captured on one occasion, if not saved by Ling Tong.\nIn 217, Cao Cao brought a massive army to attack Ruxu again. Sun Quan personally led 70,000 men to defend the city, though he left actual command of the battle to L\u00fc Meng. It was a furious campaign, and after several weeks of gruelling battle, L\u00fc Meng's defences held and the spring floods forced Cao Cao to retreat once again.\nStill, this was not a complete victory. Most of Cao Cao's army was still intact and he had a huge force under Xiahou Dun north of Sun Quan's position. This resulted in a stalemate in which as long as Sun Quan kept his army in Ruxu, Xiahou Dun could not hope to invade him; but as soon as Sun Quan pulled out of Ruxu, Xiahou Dun could break through. Also, Xiahou Dun's force was simply too large and too well-entrenched to be driven away. Sun Quan had no military options, so he settled on a diplomatic solution. In 217, Sun Quan allied with Cao Cao, recognising him as the legitimate representative of the Han central government. While officially this was a surrender, Cao Cao knew that Sun Quan would not be content with being treated like a subject, so he confirmed all of the titles Sun Quan had claimed for himself and formalised his control over the lands he held. Sun Quan was permitted to continue to rule independently but was now officially one of Cao Cao's subordinates.\nBreaking of alliance with Liu Bei.\nIn 219, Guan Yu advanced north, attacking Fancheng, scoring a major victory over Cao Ren. While Fancheng did not fall at this time, Guan Yu put it under siege, and the situation was severe enough that Cao Cao considered moving the capital away from Xu. However, Sun Quan, resentful of Guan Yu's prior constant instigation of hostilities (including seizing Sun's food supplies to use for his campaign north), took the opportunity to attack Guan from the rear, and Guan's forces collapsed. Guan Yu was captured by forces under L\u00fc Meng and Jiang Qin; Guan Yu was executed, Jing Province came under Sun's control, and the Sun-Liu alliance ended.\nAfter Cao Cao's death in 220, Cao Pi forced Emperor Xian to yield the throne to him, ending the Han dynasty and establishing the state of Cao Wei. Sun Quan did not immediately submit to Wei or declare independence after Cao Pi's enthronement, but took a wait-and-see attitude; by contrast, in early 221, Liu Bei declared himself emperor, establishing the state of Shu Han. Immediately, Liu Bei planned a campaign against Sun Quan to avenge Guan Yu. After attempting to negotiate peace and receiving no positive response from Liu Bei, fearing attack on both sides, Sun Quan became a vassal of Wei. Cao Pi's strategist Liu Ye suggested that Cao Pi decline\u2014and in fact attack Sun Quan on a second front, effectively partitioning Sun's domain with Shu, and then eventually seek to destroy Shu as well. Cao Pi declined, in a fateful choice that most historians believe doomed his empire to ruling only the northern and central China\u2014and this chance would not come again. Indeed, against Liu Ye's advice, on 23 September 221 he appointed Sun Quan the King of Wu and granted him the nine bestowments.\nIn 222, at the Battle of Xiaoting, Sun Quan's general Lu Xun dealt Liu Bei a major defeat, stopping the Shu offensive. Shu would not again pose a threat to Sun Quan from that point on. Later that year, when Cao Pi demanded that Sun Quan send his crown prince Sun Deng to the Wei capital Luoyang as a hostage (to guarantee his loyalty), Sun Quan refused and declared independence (by changing era name), thus establishing Eastern Wu as an independent state. Cao Pi launched a major attack on Wu, but after Wei defeats in early 223, it became clear that Wu was secure. After Liu Bei's death later that year, Zhuge Jin's brother Zhuge Liang, the regent for Liu Bei's son and successor Liu Shan, reestablished the alliance with Sun Quan, and the two states would remain allies until Shu's eventual destruction in 263.\nEarly reign.\nEarly in Sun Quan's reign, the Wu administration was known for its efficiency, as Sun showed a knack for listening to correct advice and for delegating authorities to the proper individuals. For example, he correctly trusted the faithful Lu Xun and Zhuge Jin, so much so that he made a duplicate imperial seal and left it with Lu Xun; whenever he would correspond with Shu's emperor Liu Shan or regent Zhuge Liang, he would deliver the letter to Lu Xun first (as Lu's post was near the Shu border), and then if, in Lu's opinion, changes were needed, he would revise the letter and then restamp it with Sun's imperial seal. Further, Lu Xun and Zhuge Jin were authorised to coordinate their actions with Shu without prior imperial approval. Sun Quan treated his high-level officials as friends and addressed them accordingly (with courtesy names), and in accordance they dedicated all effort to Wu's preservation. He also knew what were the proper roles for officials that he trusted; for example, in 225, when selecting a chancellor, while the key officials all respected Zhang Zhao greatly and wanted him to be chancellor, Sun Quan declined, reasoning that while he respected Zhang greatly, a chancellor needed to handle all affairs of state, and Zhang, while capable, had such strong opinions that he would surely be in conflict with Sun Quan and other officials at all times. He also repeatedly promoted his official L\u00fc Fan even though, while Sun Quan was young, L\u00fc Fan had informed Sun Ce about his improper spending habits. Sun Quan understood that L\u00fc did so only out of loyalty to Sun Ce.\nIn 224 and 225, Cao Pi again made attacks on Wu, but each time the Wu forces were able to repel Wei's with fair ease\u2014so easily that Cao Pi made the comment, \"Heaven created the Yangtze to divide the north and south.\" However, Sun Quan was himself equally unsuccessful in efforts to make major attacks on Wei. After Cao Pi's death in 226, for example, Sun Quan launched an attack on Wei's Jiangxia Commandery, but was forced to withdraw as soon as Wei reinforcements arrived. However, later that year, he was able to increase his effective control over Jiao Province when his general L\u00fc Dai was able to defeat the warlord Shi Hui () and end the effective independence that the Shi clan had. In addition, the several independent kingdoms in modern Cambodia, Laos, and southern Vietnam all became Wu vassals as well.\nThe \"Book of Liang\" records the arrival in 226 of a merchant from the Roman Empire (Daqin) at Jiaozhi (Chinese-controlled northern Vietnam). The Prefect of Jiaozhou sent him to the court of Sun Quan in Nanjing. Sun Quan requested that he provide him with a report on his native country and its people. An expedition was mounted to return the merchant along with 10 female and 10 male \"blackish coloured dwarfs\" he had requested as a curiosity and a Chinese officer who, unfortunately, died en route.\nThe one major victory that Wu would have over Wei during this period came in 228, when, with Sun Quan's approval, his general Zhou Fang pretended to be surrendering to Wei after pretending to have been punished repeatedly by Sun Quan. This tricked the Wei general Cao Xiu, who led a large army south to support Zhou Fang. He walked into the trap set by Zhou Fang and Lu Xun and suffered major losses, but was saved from total annihilation by Jia Kui.\nIn 229, Sun Quan declared himself emperor, which almost damaged the alliance with Shu, as many Shu officials saw this as a sign of betrayal of the Han dynasty\u2014to which Shu claimed to be the legitimate successor. However, Zhuge Liang opposed ending the alliance and in fact confirmed it with a formal treaty later that year, in which the two states pledged to support each other and divide Wei equally if they could conquer it. Later that year, Sun Quan moved his capital from Wuchang to Jianye, leaving his crown prince Sun Deng, assisted by Lu Xun, in charge of the western parts of Eastern Wu.\nMiddle reign.\nIn 230, however, the first sign of the deterioration of Sun Quan's reign occurred. That year, he sent his generals Wei Wen () and Zhuge Zhi () with a navy of 10,000 into the East China Sea to seek the legendary islands of Yizhou () and Danzhou (), to seek to conquer them, despite strenuous opposition of Lu Xun and Quan Cong. The navy was not able to locate Danzhou but located Yizhou, and returned in 231 after capturing several thousand men\u2014but only after 80\u201390% of the navy had died from illness. Instead of seeing his own fault in this venture, Sun Quan simply executed Wei Wen and Zhuge Zhi. Perhaps concerned about this deterioration in Sun Quan's judgment, Sun Deng left the western empire in Lu Xun's hands in 232 and returned to Jianye, and would remain at Jianye until his own death in 241.\nIn 232, Sun Quan had another misadventure involving his navy\u2014as he sent his generals Zhou He () and Pei Qian () to the nominal Wei vassal Gongsun Yuan, in control of Liaodong Commandery, to purchase horses, against the advice of Yu Fan\u2014and indeed, he exiled Yu Fan to the desolate Cangwu Commandery (roughly modern Wuzhou, Guangxi) as punishment. Just as Yu Fan predicted, however, the venture would end in failure\u2014as Zhou He and Pei Qian, on their way back, were intercepted by Wei forces and killed. Regretting his actions, Sun Quan tried to recall Yu Fan back to Jianye, only to learn that Yu had died in exile.\nThe next year, however, Sun Quan would have yet another misadventure in his dealings with Gongsun Yuan, as Gongsun sent messengers to him, offering to be his subject. Sun Quan was ecstatic, and appointed Gongsun Yuan the Prince of Yan and granted him the nine bestowments, and further sent a detachment of 10,000 men by sea north to assist Gongsun Yuan in his campaign against Wei, against the advice of nearly every single one of his high-level officials, particularly Zhang Zhao. Once the army arrived, however, Gongsun Yuan betrayed them, killing Sun Quan's officials Zhang Mi () and Xu Yan (), whom Sun had sent to grant the bestowments and seized their troops. Once that happened, the enraged Sun Quan wanted to personally head north with a fleet to attack Gongsun Yuan, and initially, not even Lu Xun's opposition was able to stop him, although he eventually calmed down and did not follow through. To his credit, he also personally went to Zhang Zhao's house and apologised to him. Further, despite the deterioration in his previous clear thinking, he was still capable of making proper decisions at times. For example, in 235, when, as a sign of contempt, Wei's emperor Cao Rui offered horses to him in exchange for pearls, jade, and tortoise shells, Sun Quan ignored the implicit insult and made the exchange, reasoning that his empire needed horses much more than pearls, jade or tortoise shells.\nIn 234, in coordination with Zhuge Liang's final northern expedition against Wei, Sun Quan personally led a major attack against Wei's border city Hefei, while having Lu Xun and Zhuge Jin attack Xiangyang, with the strategy of trying to attract Wei relief forces and then attacking them. However, Wei generals correctly saw the situation and simply let Sun Quan siege Hefei. Only after Sun Quan's food supplies ran low did Cao Rui personally arrive with reinforcements, and Sun withdrew, as did Lu Xun and Zhuge Jin.\nIn 238, when Gongsun Yuan was under attack by Wei's general Sima Yi, Sun Quan, despite his prior rage against Gongsun, correctly judged the situation as one where he might be able to take advantage if Sima Yi were initially unsuccessful, so he did not immediately refuse Gongsun's request for help. However, as Sima Yi was able to conquer Gongsun Yuan quickly, Sun Quan never launched the major attack that he considered if Sima got stuck in a stalemate with Gongsun. That year, he also recognised how L\u00fc Yi, the supervisor of the audit bureau, had been abusing his powers, and had L\u00fc Yi executed; he then further confirmed his trust in the high-level officials by personally writing an emotional letter to Zhuge Jin, Bu Zhi, Zhu Ran, and L\u00fc Dai, blaming himself for the recent problems with his administration while urging them to speak out honestly whenever they saw faults in him.\nIn 241, Sun Quan would launch the last major assault against Wei of his reign, in light of Cao Rui's death in 239, but he rejected a strategy offered by Yin Zha () to attack Wei in coordinated effort with Shu on four different fronts, and the campaign ended in failure as well.\nLate reign.\nLater in 241, the crown prince Sun Deng died\u2014an event that left open the issue of succession and appeared to mark the start of a precipitous decline in Sun Quan's mental health. In 242, he appointed his son Sun He, born to Consort Wang, crown prince. However, he also favoured another son by Consort Wang, Sun Ba, and permitted Sun Ba to have the same staffing level as the crown prince\u2014a move that a number of officials objected to as encouraging Sun Ba to compete with Sun He, but Sun Quan did not listen to them. After 245, when Sun He and Sun Ba began to have separate residences, their relationship deteriorated further, and Sun Ba began to scheme at how to seize heir status from Sun He. Fanned by gossip from his daughter Sun Luban, Sun Quan blamed Sun He's mother Consort Wang for this\u2014and she died in fear. He also cut off Sun He and Sun Ba's access to the officials who supported them in hopes of receiving future favours, but this could not stop Sun Ba's machinations. Indeed, when Lu Xun tried to intervene to protect Sun He, Sun Ba falsely accused him of many crimes, and Sun Quan became provoked so much that he repeatedly rebuked Lu Xun, causing him to die in frustration.\nIn 250, fed up with Sun Ba's constant attacks against Sun He, Sun Quan carried out an inexplicable combination of actions. He forced Sun Ba to commit suicide, while deposing Sun He (who had not been shown to have committed any crimes), and instead creating his youngest son, Sun Liang, crown prince to replace Sun He. This move was opposed by his son-in-law Zhu Ju (the husband of Sun Quan's daughter Sun Luyu), but Zhu Ju's pleas not only did not help Sun He, but also resulted in his own death, as Sun Quan forced him to commit suicide. Many other officials who also opposed the move, as well as officials who had supported Sun Ba, were executed.\nAround this time, Sun Quan also had his generals destroy a number of levees near the border with Wei, creating large areas of flooding, in order to obstruct potential attacks from Wei.\nIn 251, Sun Quan created the first empress of his reign\u2014Sun Liang's mother and Sun Quan's lifelong beloved wife Consort Pan (previously, he had a succession of wives, but never made any of them empress). Later that year, however, he realised that Sun He was blameless and wanted to recall him from his exile, but was persuaded not to do so by his daughter Sun Luban and Sun Jun, who had supported Sun Liang's ascension. He realised that he was getting very old (69 by this point) and, at Sun Jun's recommendation, commissioned Zhuge Jin's son Zhuge Ke as the future regent for Sun Liang, even though he correctly had misgivings about how Zhuge Ke was arrogant and had overly high opinions of his own abilities. At that time virtually the entire empire, awed by Zhuge's prior military victories, was convinced that Zhuge would be the correct choice for regent.\nIn 252, as Sun Quan neared death, Empress Pan was murdered, but how she was murdered remains a controversy. Wu officials claimed that her servants, unable to stand her temper, strangled her while she was asleep, while a number of historians, including Hu Sanxing, the commentator to Sima Guang's \"Zizhi Tongjian\", believed that top Wu officials were complicit, as they feared that she would seize power as empress dowager after Sun Quan's death. On 252, Sun Quan died at the age of 70 (by East Asian age reckoning), and Sun Liang succeeded him. Sun Quan was buried in August or September 252 with Empress Pan in a mausoleum at the Purple Mountain in Jianye.\nFaith and spirituality.\nSun Quan initially believed in Taoism and communicated frequently with Taoist priests such as Ge Xuan, Yao Guang, and Jie Xiang. However, in 247, when Kang Senghui, a Buddhist monk from Jiaozhi (modern-day northern Vietnam), arrived in the state of Wu, Sun Quan had a conversation with him and ultimately chose to convert to Buddhism. With the support of Sun Quan, the Buddhist temple named \"Jianchusi\" () was established in the Jiangnan region.\nIn popular culture.\nMusic.\nThere is a song named after Sun Quan in Luo Tianyi's (Sun Quan The Emperor)\nVideo games.\nSun Quan appears as a playable character in Koei's \"Dynasty Warriors\" and \"Warriors Orochi\" video game series.\nSun Quan also appears in the mobile video game \"Puzzle &amp; Dragons\" as part of the \"Three Kingdoms Gods\" series.\nSun Quan is also a playable character in \" as part of the Sun family faction.\nCard games.\nIn the collectible card game \" there is a card named \"Sun Quan, Lord of Wu\", in the \"Portal Three Kingdoms\" set.\nIn the selection of hero cards in the Chinese card game \"San Guo Sha\", there is also a Sun Quan hero that players can select at the beginning of the game.\nIn the collectible card game \"Yu-Gi-Oh!\" there is a card based on Sun Quan named \u201cAncient Warriors- Masterful Sun Mou.\u201d\nFilm and television.\nZhang Bo, in the 2010 Chinese television series \"Three Kingdoms\".\nZheng Wei as a child, in the 2010 Chinese television series \"Three Kingdoms\".\nTaiwanese actor Chang Chen portrayed Sun Quan in John Woo's 2008 two-part epic war film \"Red Cliff\".\nDeng Haifeng, in the 2017 Chinese television series \"The Advisors Alliance\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "55655", "revid": "35936988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55655", "title": "Tenure of Office Act (1867)", "text": "Federal United States law\nThe Tenure of Office Act was a United States federal law, in force from 1867 to 1887, that was intended to restrict the power of the president to remove certain office-holders without the approval of the U.S. Senate. The law was enacted March 2, 1867, over the veto of President Andrew Johnson. It purported to deny the president the power to remove any executive officer who had been appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the Senate, unless the Senate approved the removal during the next full session of Congress.\nJohnson's attempt to remove Secretary of War Edwin Stanton from office without the Senate's approval led to the impeachment of Johnson in early 1868 for violating the act.\nThe act was significantly amended by Congress on April 5, 1869, under President Ulysses S. Grant. Congress repealed the act in its entirety in 1887, 20 years after the law was enacted. While evaluating the constitutionality of a similar law in \"Myers v. United States\" (1926), the Supreme Court stated that the Tenure of Office Act was likely invalid.\nBackground.\nThe notion of the United States Senate advising and consenting the removal of Cabinet members to the same of the appointments were considered during the 1st United States Congress. The vote was tied with 9 in favor and 9 against on July 18, 1789. Vice President John Adams, with his first tie-breaking vote, voted against the bill, defeating it.\nThe Constitution adopted by the Confederate States of America was more explicit on the point, providing in Article II, Section 2, Clause 3 thereof, that \"The principal officer in each of the Executive Departments, and all persons connected with the diplomatic service, may be removed from office at the pleasure of the President. All other civil officers of the Executive Departments may be removed at any time by the President, or other appointing power, when their services are unnecessary, or for dishonesty, incapacity, inefficiency, misconduct, or neglect of duty; and when so removed, the removal shall be reported to the Senate, together with the reasons therefor.\"\nIn the post-Civil War political environment, President Johnson, a Democrat who had served as Abraham Lincoln's second vice president, endorsed the quick re-admission of the Southern secessionist states. The two-thirds Republican majorities of both houses of Congress passed laws over Johnson's vetoes, establishing a series of five military districts overseeing newly created state governments. This \"Congressional Reconstruction\" was designed to create local civil rights laws to protect newly freed slaves; to protect and patrol the area; to ensure the secessionist states would show some good faith before being readmitted; to ensure Republican control of the states; and, arguably, to inflict some punishment on the secessionists. States would be readmitted gradually.\nOverpowered politically, Johnson could apply the sole check to the Congressional Reconstruction plan of his control (as commander-in-chief) of the military, which would be the primary institution enforcing the plan's provisions. Even Johnson's control of the military was inhibited by the fact that his Secretary of War, Edwin Stanton, was a staunch Radical Republican who supported Congressional Reconstruction in full. This further set Johnson against the Republican-controlled Congress, with Johnson wanting to remove Stanton from office and Congress wanting to keep him in place.\nStanton and impeachment of Johnson.\nThe Tenure of Office Act restricted the power of the president to suspend an officer while the Senate was not in session. At that time, Congress sat during a relatively small portion of the year. If, when the Senate reconvened, it declined to ratify the removal, the president would be required to reinstate the official.\nIn August 1867, with the Senate out of session, Johnson made his move against Stanton, suspending him pending the next session of the Senate. When the Senate convened on January 13, 1868, it refused to ratify the removal by a vote of 35\u20136. Notwithstanding the vote, on February 22, 1868, President Johnson attempted to replace Stanton with Lorenzo Thomas because he wanted, by such action, to create a case through which to challenge the legitimacy of the Act before the Supreme Court. Proceedings began within days to move toward the impeachment of Johnson, the first impeachment of a United States President. After a three-month trial, Johnson narrowly avoided removal from office by the Senate by a single vote. Stanton resigned in May 1868.\nIt was unclear whether Johnson had violated the Tenure of Office Act which led up to the impeachment. The act's phrasing was murky, and it was not clear whether his removal of Stanton (a holdover from the Lincoln administration whom Johnson had not appointed) violated the Act. While the Act, by its terms, applied to current office holders, it also limited the protection offered to Cabinet members to one month after a new president took office.\nLater use.\nThe act was amended on April 5, 1869, one month and one day after Republican president Ulysses S. Grant assumed the presidency. The revisions grew out of an attempt to completely repeal the 1867 Act. The measure to repeal passed the House of Representatives with only 16 negative votes but failed in the Senate. The new provisions were significantly less onerous, allowing the president to suspend office holders \"in his discretion\" and designate replacements while the Senate was in recess, subject only to confirmation of the replacements at the next session. The president no longer had to report his reasons for suspension to the Senate, and the Senate could no longer force reinstatement of suspended office holders.\nAlthough Grant, in his first message to Congress, in December 1869, urged the repeal of even the revised act, it did not cause further problems until the election of Democrat Grover Cleveland in 1884. Under the spoils system it had long been accepted practice for the administration of a new party to replace current office holders with party faithful. Cleveland, a supporter of a civil service system, had promised to avoid wholesale replacements, vowing to replace incumbents only for cause. When he suspended several hundred office holders for cause, Senate committees requested information from cabinet members regarding the reasons for the suspensions, which Cleveland refused to provide. If he had simply said that the incumbents were being replaced for political reasons, the Senate would have complied, but Cleveland would not do so. When, in early 1886, the Senate as a whole demanded information regarding the conduct of the suspended U.S. Attorney for southern Alabama, Cleveland sent a message to Congress explaining his position opposing impingement of independence of the executive. Cleveland's replacement nominee was eventually confirmed when it was discovered that the suspended incumbent's term had expired in the meantime anyway. The Tenure of Office Act was formally repealed in 1887.\nConstitutionality.\nIn 1926, a similar law (though not dealing with Cabinet secretaries) was ruled unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court in the case of \"Myers v. United States\", which affirmed the ability of the president to remove a Postmaster without Congressional approval. In reaching that decision, the Supreme Court stated in its majority opinion (though in dicta), \"that the Tenure of Office Act of 1867, insofar as it attempted to prevent the president from removing executive officers who had been appointed by him by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, was invalid\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the election or appointment to any federal or state office of any person who had held any of certain offices and then engaged in insurrection, rebellion, or treason. However, the section provides that a two-thirds vote by each House of the Congress could override this limitation. The 1872 act was passed by the 42nd United States Congress and the original restrictive Act was passed by the United States Congress in May 1866.\nSpecifically, the 1872 Act removed office-holding disqualifications against most of the secessionists who rebelled in the American Civil War, except for \"Senators and Representatives of the thirty-sixth and thirty-seventh Congresses, officers in the judicial, military, and naval service of the United States, heads of departments, and foreign ministers of the United States.\"\nIn the spirit of the act, then United States President Ulysses S. Grant, by proclamation dated June 1, 1872, directed all district attorneys having charge of proceedings and prosecutions against those who had been disqualified by the Fourteenth Amendment to dismiss and discontinue them, except as to persons who fall within the exceptions named in the act. President Grant also pardoned all but 500 former top Confederate leaders.\nThe 1872 law cleared over 150,000 former Confederate troops who had taken part in the American Civil War.\nText.\nBe it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled (two-thirds of each house concurring therein), that all political disabilities imposed by the third section of the fourteenth article of amendments of the Constitution of the United States are hereby removed from all persons whomsoever, except Senators and Representatives of the thirty-sixth and thirty-seventh Congresses, officers in the judicial, military, and naval service of the United States, heads of departments, and foreign ministers of the United States.\nLegacy.\nThe Amnesty Act of 1872 states that all political disabilities imposed by the Fourteenth Amendment \"are hereby removed,\" but does not explicitly mention whether future disabilities under the same amendment are also to be considered removed. In March 2022, in the aftermath of the January 6 US Capitol attack, the US District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina ruled that the Act applies even to current members of Congress, automatically removing the political consequences of any alleged violation of Section 3. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit unanimously reversed that ruling. A different federal district court ruled that the Act does not apply to current members of Congress, and that Section 3 is still applicable. The plaintiff's appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit was dismissed as moot after it was determined that she had not violated Section 3.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The decision further contracted the nation's money supply and was seen by critics as an exacerbating factor of the so-called Long Depression, which struck in 1873.\nHistory.\nLate in 1861, seeking to raise revenue for the American Civil War effort without exhausting its reserves of gold and silver, the United States federal government suspended specie payments, or the payments made in gold and silver in redemption of currency notes. Early in 1862, the United States issued legal-tender notes, called greenbacks. By war's end, a total of $million in greenbacks had been issued, and authorization had been given for another $million in small denominations, known as fractional currency or \"shin plasters.\" The issuance of greenbacks caused inflation during the period.\nImmediately after the Civil War during Reconstruction, there were large capital inflows into the United States and a general improvement in the export-to-import ratio since the export-dominant South was reintegrated with the North. The United States Treasury, however, had increased its cash balance through the summer of 1873 by selling gold for $million. National banks also increased issuance of national bank notes by $million. The failure of several railroad companies including Jay Cooke &amp; Company on their bond obligations encouraged capital outflows from the United States to Europe and weakened demand for dollars leading to the Panic of 1873. Increased Treasury cash balances, continued issuance of national bank notes, and capital outflows together depreciated the currency. These factors further caused a reduction in reserves held by monetary institutions because higher prices increased domestic demand for currency. Reserves held by banks were insufficient to be able to meet seasonal demands in autumn of 1873 as greenback reserves declined from $million in September 1873 to $million in October 1873. Tensions surrounding the Panic of 1873 between creditors and debtors revived the specie payment resumption debate.\nTwo views dominated this debate. Conservatives and the creditor class favored \"hard money\"; they favored resumption as a method for making up losses incurred due to dollar depreciation during the past decade. The resumption of specie payments was perceived as a method to curb the rise in the price level and eventually equate currency with gold. For creditors, that had issued debts in inflated greenbacks, resumption would increase the real interest rate that they received. Supporters of the Resumption Act argued that the Panic of 1873 might not have occurred had there been sufficient reserves of gold in the United States Treasury as would have been the case if specie payments were resumed.\nOpposed to resumption, a new coalition of agrarian and labor interests found common cause during Reconstruction in advocating for \"soft money\" or the promotion of inflationary monetary policies. These groups viewed the Panic of 1873 as the result of insufficient currency that should have been used to fuel the growth in production that occurred in the South and the West. These regions relied on cheap money \u2013 that is low interest rates \u2013 to be able to continue to grow. Other soft money advocates included gold speculators and the railroad industry. Collis P. Huntington and other railroad leaders called for further greenback issuance in light of harsh business conditions that made honoring debt obligations difficult. Opponents of the Resumption Act also argued that many debt obligations were made in an environment in which there existed a premium on gold, that is that inflation in the currency in the previous decade made gold relatively more valuable than currency. Resumption therefore entailed up to a 50% increase in debt obligation if gold and currency equalized. For manufacturers, the rising price of gold made domestic prices cheaper relative to import prices since many European currencies including sterling were fixed to the price of gold. Hence continued inflationary measures such as further issuance of greenbacks artificially supported domestic industries. Hard and soft money interests often did cross party lines, although a larger portion of Democrats were hard money advocates.\nFollowing the Democratic victory in the congressional elections of 1874, the lame-duck Republican Congress passed the Resumption Act on January 14, 1875. It required the Secretary of the Treasury to redeem greenbacks in specie on demand on or after 1 January 1879. The Act, however, did not provide for a specific mechanism for redemption. The Act, though, did allow the Secretary of Treasury to acquire gold reserves either via any federal surpluses or the issuance of government bonds. An established gold reserve allowed for daily variations in specie flows and facilitated resumption. The act abolished the seigniorage fee on coining gold and substituted silver for any still existing fractional currency. The Resumption Act set no limit on the quantity of national bank notes that could be issued; this idea became known as \"free banking.\" This provision led many conservatives to believe that the Act was inflationary in nature. However, the Resumption Act also required that greenbacks be retired in a proportion of 80% of new national bank note issue, which in theory aimed to contract the money supply and hence encourage dollar appreciation such that gold and currency might equate. However, in practice the effect was mild: the total quantity of greenbacks in circulation fell from $million at the end of 1874 to $million following the passage of the Resumption Act.\nThe Resumption Act was hotly debated during the 1880 presidential election, with most western politicians opposed to it. Specie payments had finally resumed during the presidency of Rutherford B. Hayes. Aided by the return of prosperity in 1877, Secretary of the Treasury John Sherman accumulated a gold reserve to be redeemed for existing greenbacks mostly from transactions with Europe. Sherman earmarked a redemption fund by January 1, 1879, that amounted to $million acquired from the sale of bonds to Europe and Treasury surplus. However, when people found greenbacks to be on par with gold, they lost their desire for redemption.\nReaction and evaluation.\nReactions as to the effects of the Resumption Act are mixed. Contemporaries did not consider it an outright victory for hard money. The legislation stood as a compromise engineered by Senators John Sherman and George Edmunds between hard and soft money advocates. Milton Friedman and Anna J. Schwartz argue that the Resumption Act had mixed effects on actual resumption of specie payments, saying that primary economic product of the Act was that it instilled confidence in the business community on the maintenance of specie payments. According to Jennifer 8 Lee, backing American currency with gold helped curb inflation and stabilize the dollar. The Act served as a signal to businesses of an approaching exchange rate between gold and currency. Preparations among businesses for this exchange rate actually encourage parity between gold and currency.\nThe Act did not directly address the price level although successful resumption at par value required that the premium on gold to fall to zero, which in turn required a fall in the price level as the world price of gold was exogenous. In fact, the final date for Resumption was decided only after the premium on gold had fallen to a tenth of its peak level. The decline in the premium cannot entirely be attributed to the Resumption Act, as downward pressure on the overall price level also resulted from increased production in the South especially during 1877. The first four months of that year sold as much beef to England as had been sold all of the preceding year. The act has also been criticized for both failing to remove all greenbacks from circulation and failing to dictate what might be done with the greenbacks remaining in circulation.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Though the bill was vetoed by President Rutherford B. Hayes, the Congress overrode Hayes's veto on February 28, 1878, to enact the law. The text of the act can be found in the \"Congressional Record\" under the further reading section of this article.\nBackground.\nThe 5 1/2-year depression following the Panic of 1873 caused cheap-money advocates (led by Representative Richard P. Bland, a Democrat of Missouri), to join with silver-producing interests in urging a return to bimetallism, the use of both silver and gold as a standard. Coupled with Senator William B. Allison of Iowa, they agreed to a proposal that allowed silver to be purchased at market rates, metals to be minted into silver dollars, and required the US Treasury to purchase between $2 million to $4 million silver each month from western mines. President Rutherford B. Hayes, who held interests in industrials and banking, vetoed the measure, which was overturned by Congress. As a result, the Hayes administration purchased the limited amount of silver each month. This act helped restore bimetallism with gold and silver both supporting the currency. However, gold remained heavily favored over silver, paving way for the gold standard.\nFree-silver movement.\nThe free-silver movement of the late 19th century advocated the unlimited coinage of silver, which would have resulted in inflationary monetary policy. In 1873, Congress had removed the use of silver dollar from the list of authorized coins under the Coinage Act of 1873 (referred to by opponents as 'the Crime of '73'\"). Although the Bland\u2013Allison Act of 1878 directed the Treasury to purchase silver from the \"best-western\" miners, President Grover Cleveland repealed the act in 1893. Advocates of free silver included owners of silver mines in the West, farmers who believed an inclusion of silver would increase crop prices, and debtors who believed it would alleviate their debts. Although the free silver movement ended, the debate of inflation and monetary policy continues to this day.\nCoinage Act of 1873.\nThe Fourth Coinage Act acknowledged the gold standard over silver. Those who advocated for silver labeled this act as the \"Crime of '73\". As a result of demonetized silver, gold became the only metallic standard in the United States and became the default standard. The price of gold was more stable than that of silver, largely due to silver discoveries in Nevada and other places in the West, and the ratio of the gold price to the silver price increased from 16-to-1 in 1873 to nearly 30-to-1 by 1893. The term limping bimetallism describes this problem. The U.S. government finally ceded to pressure from the western mining states and the Bland\u2013Allison Act went into effect in 1878. The law was replaced in 1890 by the similar Sherman Silver Purchase Act, which in turn was repealed by Congress in 1893. These were two instances where the United States attempted to establish bimetallic standards in the long run.\nReactions and economic impact.\nWestern miners and debtors regarded the Bland\u2013Allison Act as an insufficient measure to enforce unlimited coinage of silver, but opponents repealed the act and advocated for the gold standard. The effect of the Bland\u2013Allison act was also blunted by the minimal purchase of silver required by the Hayes administration. Although the act was a near turning point for bimetallism, gold continued to be favored over the bimetallism standard.\nThroughout 1860 to 1871, several attempts were made by the Treasury to establish the bimetallic standard by having gold and silver dollar coins. However, the discovery of silver led to an influx of supply, lowering the price of silver. The eventual removal of the bimetallic standard, including the Bland\u2013Allison Act and the acceptance of the gold standard formed the monetary stability in the late 19th century.\nThe limitation placed on the supply of new notes and the Treasury control over the issue of new notes allowed for economic stability. Prior to the acceptance, the devaluation of silver forced local governments into a financial turmoil. In addition, there was a need for money supply to increase as the credit system expanded and large banks established themselves across states.\nIn addition, the priority that was placed on the coinage of silver dollars left very little available silver for the coinage of silver coins of lesser denominations, particularly half dollars and quarters. As a result, these coins had extremely low mintages (fewer than 5,000 half dollars were struck in 1879, 1882, and 1884, and 5,000 quarters were struck in 1886) until the Barber coinage began in 1892.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
