He was a high-ranking Song dynasty scholar-official who authored the \"Zizhi Tongjian\", a monumental work of history.\nBorn into a family of officials, Sima Guang displayed remarkable intelligence from a young age and quickly rose through the ranks of the Song bureaucracy. His early career was marked by his work in government administration, where he gained a reputation for his meticulous scholarship and principled stance on state affairs. As a prominent official, he strongly opposed Wang Anshi\u2019s New Policies, arguing that they disrupted social stability and traditional governance. His criticisms led to his removal from political office when reformists held power.\nAfter retiring from active politics, Sima devoted himself to historical research and writing. He spent years compiling and editing the Zizhi Tongjian, which he presented to Emperor Shenzong in 1084. In addition to his historical work, he advocated for the repeal of certain feudal institutions, promoting policies he believed would restore order and moral integrity to the empire. His legacy as a historian and political thinker had a lasting impact on Chinese historiography and conservative political thought.\nEarly life and career.\nSima Guang was named after Guang Prefecture, his birthplace, and where his father Sima Chi () served as a county magistrate. The Sima family were originally from Xia County in Sh\u01cen Prefecture, and claimed descent from the 3rd century Cao Wei official Sima Fu. A famous anecdote relates the young Sima Guang saving a playmate who had fallen into an enormous vat full of water. As other children scattered in panic, Sima calmly picked up a rock and smashed a hole in the base of the pot. Water leaked out, and his friend was saved.\nAt the age of 6, Sima heard a lecture concerning the \"Zuo Zhuan\", a work of history dating to the 4th century BC. Fascinated, he was able to retell the stories to his family when he returned home. He became an avid reader, \"to the point of not recognizing hunger, thirst, coldness or heat\".\nSima obtained early success as a scholar and officer. When he was barely twenty, he passed the Imperial examination with the highest rank of , and spent the next several years in official positions.\nPolitical ideology.\nSima believed that civilization was created when the sage kings transformed humans from their original animal state using hierarchical order, property rights, moral instruction, and penal law. He believed that the problem with government was not in its structure, but rather in the people that ran it. He wrote multiple memorials detailing how to make the government more effective and argued that his views were in accord with history (in contrast with Wang Anshi's emphasis on the Classics) and Heaven-and-Earth. A static and well-maintained country would, according to him, last forever. Accordingly, he disliked commercial growth (which he believed encouraged social change) and preferred a recommendation-based imperial examination system.\nRulers were supposed to only determine official assignments, reward achievement, punish failure, care about their servants, have good morals, and be immune to outside influence. On a wider level, a society with clear inferior-superior roles would be stable. His deeply anti-change perspective made him a political conservative (in contrast with Wang Anshi's reformism). For Sima, to be ethical was to accept one's social status, and personal cultivation meant exercising restraint; indeed Sima interpreted the \"investigation of things\", a fundamental tenet of the Cheng-Zhu school of Neo-confucianism, as \"restraining things\". He also agreed with Xunzi's postulation that humans were inherently evil and wrote a work called \"Doubting Mencius\" that criticized Mencius' encouraging of the overthrow of hierarchy.\nUnder Emperor Renzong.\nAfter the failure of the Qingli Reforms under an unenthusiastic Emperor Renzong, the future reformist Wang Anshi submitted a 10,000-word memorial in 1058 detailing a system of comprehensive reform. Sima Guang did the same thing in 1061, but his proposals were more conservative.\nUnder Emperor Yingzong.\nIn 1064, Sima, then just a policy critic, raised the issue between performing rituals for Zhao Yurang, Emperor Yingzong's biological father, and Emperor Renzong. This issue would dominate Yingzong's reign and cause political gridlock. Sima himself believed that priority should be given to Renzong since he was the emperor's ritual father. Yingzong overruled this belief and, partly due to personal affection for his biological father, gave Zhao Yurang high ritual honors in 1066. In the same year, Sima sponsored Su Zhe for a special decree examination.\nUnder Emperor Shenzong.\nEmperor Shenzong promoted Sima to chief censor in late 1067. He opposed Shenzong's irridentism and favored a defensive stance towards the Uyghurs, Tibetans, Western Xia, and Liao dynasty. Sima hoped that the \"barbarians\" would commend the Song dynasty's good government. Since the end of the Qingli Reforms in 1045 did not end the Song dynasty's problems, factions developed around how to solve these issues. Conservatives like Sima Guang advocated for a smaller government budget and gradual reform. As such, Sima opposed the New Policies of Wang Anshi, which increased government authority and spending. Sima argued that more state revenue would mean less money for farmers and that the government was immoral for competing with merchants. Somewhat counterintuitively, he emphasized the unifying role of the emperor more than the reformists; he wanted the emperor to manage the bureaucracy and control officials with rewards and punishments, while the reformists wanted to implement new policies for new problems. In response to Emperor Shenzong of Song appointing him as head of the new Office of Expenditure Reduction, Sima released a scathing report that criticized the oversized bureaucracy, imperial extravagance, and an inefficient army and which called for imperial discussion rather than offering specific solutions. Shenzong quickly dissolved the office but continued to accept Sima's counsel. \nBy 1070, Sima was part of the Hanlin Academy, the Bureau of Military Affairs, and the Council of State. Frustrated with Wang Anshi's dominance over court and despite Shenzong's urging for him to stay, Sima retired to Luoyang in 1071, which would become the center of the conservative opposition. This made Wang largely unopposed in government. Sima was disturbed by the New Policy's control over the dynasty's people and resources. \nSima had multiple objections to the New Policies. He believed that: \nRetirement.\nSima retired in Luoyang from 1071 to 1085. While there, he wrote the Zizhi Tongjian and cultivated friendships with Shao Yong, Cheng Yi, and Cheng Hao. Massive famines and droughts fueled resentment towards Wang Anshi and garnered support for Sima, contributing to the conservative restoration of 1085. However, Sima was not restored to power following the unpopular Wang's retirement in 1076 since Shenzong took personal control over the New Policies. Cai Que, a semi-reformist leader, blocked Sima's re-appointment to power despite the failure of the war against the Western Xia. Cai nonetheless ingratiated him to the influential Sima by appointing Sima's disciple, Xing Shu, as a scholar.\nUnder Emperor Zhezong.\nFor 40 years following the death of Shenzong, the reformist and conservative factions alternated control over the Song government. Both factions engaged in \"ethical factionalism\" as they engaged in ruthless purges against each other. An attempted coup by the reformist faction (including Cai Que, Zhang Dun, Xing Shu, and Cai Jing) intended to dethrone Emperor Zhezong failed and aggravated the conservative faction. Sima was an old and tired man in Luoyang and was reluctant to return to the capital, but Cheng Hao convinced him to do so. When Sima arrived in Kaifeng, a large crowd swarmed to touch his horse, and palace guardsmen saluted him as \"Prime Minister Sima\". He encouraged people to openly express their grievances about the New Policies.\nSima was soon made chief councilor by Empress Dowager Gao, the regent for Emperor Zhezong and herself a staunch conservative. He and other recalled conservatives like Su Shi, Su Che, Cheng Yi, Cheng Hao, Wang Yansou, Fan Chunren, Wen Yanbo, and L\u00fc Gongzhu formed the Yuanyou faction, named after the current era. Sima made ad hominem denunciations against Wang Anshi, saying: \"[Wang] was self-satisfied and self-righteous, and considered himself to be unparalleled by figures past and present.\" Sima also blamed the Song dynasty's defeat at Yongle City during the war with the Western Xia on poor, glory-oriented leadership, while presenting himself as the \"savior of the dynasty\". As the conservative leader, he headed his coalition to demote reformist leaders to lowly prefectural-level posts (while promoting conservatives into high positions and, one by one, abolished many of the New Policies. He also wanted to combine the Secretariat and the Chancellery, arguing that the latter was redundant: \"[The Chancellery] serves no purpose except to double the number of clerks and multiply paperwork.\" The two departments would be combined in 1129. Cai Que and Zhang Dun would lead the reformist opposition against the conservative restoration.\nAbolishing the Baojia system.\nThe compulsory Baojia village defense system trained and enrolled nearly 7 million men across the dynasty. Sima criticized the system's detracting from agricultural productivity and its potential for creating bandits. Wang Yansou criticized the unnecessary brutality of the system. In mid-1085, an imperial edict abolished the system in the capital and its surrounding areas, with more restrictions imposed on this system in the following months. Reformist opposition to the system's abolition was weak and primarily logistical rather than ideological. Zhang Dun's call for moderate abolition was reasonable considering the shock that followed the rapid abolishment of the Baojia system.\nAbolishing the equal tax law and market exchange law.\nThe equal tax law was a system of land evaluation and taxation that was probably the most successful of the New Policies. The law was removed with little opposition in late 1085. \nThe market exchange law established government monopolies that were intended to buy cheap products and sell dear products. However, the established agencies cornered the market in staple goods and became focused on generating revenue. Throughout 1085, executive orders forgave debt owed to the agencies and abolished loan bureaus before abolishing the law altogether. This signaled the turning point for the reformist-conservative conflict.\nAbolishing the labor recruitment law and the fall of Cai Que and Zhang Dun.\nThe labor recruitment law replaced corv\u00e9e labor with professional laborers funded by service exemption fees paid by the richest rural households. Similar to the market exchange law, this law primarily became a method for revenue extraction. Sima argued that the law was simply another tax imposed on the commoners. Cai Que's refusal to remove the labor recruitment law led to his character assassination by the conservatives Liu Chi and Su Che; this pushed him to resign as chancellor of the right and he was reappointed as the administrator of Chenzhou. Zhang Dun continued to resist and pointed out Sima's hypocrisy regarding the law: in early 1086, Sima said that rich households were harmed by the law, while just 14 days later he said that rich households benefitted from their preferential treatment under the law. Zhang also criticized Sima's demand to abolish the law country-wide in a mere 5 days. Indeed, Sima was impressed when Cai Jing, the mayor of Kaifeng, was the only one who abolished the law in under 5 days. 21 days after Cai Que resigned, Zhang Dun was demoted to a prefectural-level post after offending Empress Gao during a debate. In spring 1086, Wang Anshi died. The conservative restoration was complete.\nNonetheless, the debate over how to remove the labor recruitment law revealed cracks in the conservative coalition. For example, Su Che (and many other conservatives who were typically closely aligned with Sima) argued that \"an entire system could not be abolished overnight without serious repercussions\" and that a framework for the replacement system should be formulated first. Su Shi, Su Che's older brother, formed a third faction and proposed that the funds from the labor recruitment law should be used to buy up public lands to grant to volunteer laborers in addition to their wages. Sima did not accept dissent from either group.\nAbolishing the green sprouts law and peace with the Western Xia.\nThe green sprouts law was intended to give low-interest loans to farmers but, like many of the aforementioned policies, became a method of revenue extraction. Conservative opposition to this policy was unified and Fan Chunren, the son of Fan Zhongyan, was the only dissenter. His argument that the law could boost the dynasty's base revenue annoyed Sima Guang and he was only saved by Wang Yansou's intervention. This incident revealed the deepening divisions within Sima's coalition that would exacerbate after his death.\nFollowing the protracted, expensive, and ultimately disappointing war against the Western Xia, the conservatives wanted to appease the Western Xia for peace. The concession of Lanzhou to the Xia was highly controversial and, along with 4 fortresses that were ostensibly ceded to Xia, remained a source of border tension for the following decades. The official truce was signed in 1089 and was broken by a 1096 invasion by the restored Zhang Dun.\nHistorical work.\nSima Guang is best remembered for his masterwork, \"Zizhi Tongjian\", and the Australian sinologist Rafe de Crespigny describes him as \"perhaps the greatest of all Chinese historians\" .\nIn 1064, Sima presented to Emperor Yingzong of Song the five-volume (\"Chart of Successive Years\"). It chronologically summarized events in Chinese history from 403 BCE to 959 CE and served as a prospectus for sponsorship of his ambitious project in historiography. These dates were chosen because 403 BCE was the beginning of the Warring States period, when the ancient State of Jin was subdivided, which eventually led to the establishment of the Qin dynasty\u2014959 CE was the end of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period and the beginning of the Song dynasty.\nIn 1066, he presented a more detailed eight-volume , which chronicled Chinese history from 403 BCE to 207 BCE (the end of the Qin dynasty). The emperor issued an edict for the compilation of a groundbreaking universal history of China, granting full access to imperial libraries, and allocating funds for the costs of compilation, including research assistance by experienced historians such as Liu Ban (\u5289\u653d, 1022\u201388), Liu Shu (\u5289\u6055, 1032\u201378), and Fan Zuyu (\u8303\u7956\u79b9, 1041\u201398). After Yingzong died in 1067, Sima was invited to the palace to introduce his work-in-progress to Emperor Shenzong of Song. The new emperor not only confirmed the interest his father had shown, but showed his favor by bestowing an imperial preface in which he changed the title from \"Tongzhi\" (\"Comprehensive Records\") to \"Zizhi Tongjian\" (\"Comprehensive Mirror to Aid in Government\"). Scholars interpret the \"Mirror\" of the title to denote a work of reference and guidance, indicating that Shenzong accepted Sima as his guide in the study of history and its application to government. The emperor maintained his support for the compilation of this comprehensive history until its completion in 1084.\nFrom the late 1060s, Sima came to assume a role as leader of what has been identified as a conservative faction at court, resolutely opposed to the New Policies of Chancellor Wang Anshi. Sima presented increasingly critical memorials to the throne until 1070, when he refused further appointment and withdrew from court. In 1071, he took up residence in Luoyang, where he remained with an official sinecure, providing sufficient time and resources to continue the compilation of Zizhi Tongjian. Though the historian and the emperor continued to disagree on policies, Sima's enforced retirement proved essential for him to complete his chronological history over the following one and a half decades. Contemporary accounts relate that, in order to work more and sleep less when he was writing his great opus, the Zizhi Tongjian, he had a wooden pillow made from a log that was designed to slip from under his head whenever he rolled over. He called this Jingzhen \u8b66\u6795 (Alert Pillow), and used it throughout the period of Zizhi Tongjian's compilation.\nHistoriography.\nSima rejected the roles of the dynastic cycle and Five Phases in legitimizing dynastic succession. For Sima, dynastic succession was instead a result of power struggles; dynasties rose and fell according to consistent factors. He believed that history was a \"mirror\" for the present and could provide the government with historical context for their current situation. Literati could thus use history as an aid to governance. His histories are structured in a way that promotes these theories. \nSima and the other Yuanyou faction conservatives (except for Su Shi, who had an unorthodox interpretation of the Tao) would be positively associated with Neo-confucianism. Liu Anshi, an important Neoconfucian, was Sima's disciple.\nDeath.\nEmperor Shenzong died in 1085, shortly after Sima had submitted \"Zizhi Tongjian\" to the throne. Sima was recalled to court and appointed to lead the government under Emperor Zhezong of Song. He used this time in power to repeal many of the New Policies, but he died the following year, in 1086. His death fractured the conservative coalition, which split into the Shuo (Hebei) faction, the Luo (Henan) faction, and the Shu (Sichuan) faction. This ushered in a period of political gridlock from 1086 to 1093.\nAchievements.\nAs well as his achievements as a statesman and historian, Sima Guang was also a lexicographer (who perhaps edited the \"Jiyun\"), and spent decades compiling his 1066 \"Leipian\" (\"Classified Chapters\", cf. the Yupian) dictionary. It was based on the \"Shuowen Jiezi\", and included 31,319 Chinese characters, many of which were coined in the Song and Tang dynasty. His \"Family Precepts of Sima Guang\" (\u53f8\u99ac\u6eab\u516c\u5bb6\u8a13) is also widely known and studied in China and Japan.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The only case in which the algorithm can return YES is if the actual answer is YES; therefore if the algorithm terminates and produces YES, then the correct answer is definitely YES; however, the algorithm can terminate with NO \"regardless\" of the actual answer. That is, if the algorithm returns NO, it might be wrong. \nSome authors call this class R, although this name is more commonly used for the class of recursive languages.\nIf the correct answer is YES and the algorithm is run \"n\" times with the result of each run statistically independent of the others, then it will return YES at least once with probability at least 1 \u2212 2\u2212\"n\". So if the algorithm is run 100 times, then the chance of it giving the wrong answer every time is lower than the chance that cosmic rays corrupted the memory of the computer running the algorithm. In this sense, if a source of random numbers is available, most algorithms in RP are highly practical.\nThe fraction 1/2 in the definition is arbitrary. The set RP will contain exactly the same problems, even if the 1/2 is replaced by any constant nonzero probability less than 1; here constant means independent of the input to the algorithm.\nFormal definition.\nA language \"L\" is in RP if and only if there exists a probabilistic Turing machine \"M\", such that\nAlternatively, RP can be defined using only deterministic Turing machines. A language \"L\" is in RP if and only if there exists a polynomial \"p\" and deterministic Turing machine \"M\", such that\nIn this definition, the string \"y\" corresponds to the output of the random coin flips that the probabilistic Turing machine would have made. For some applications this definition is preferable since it does not mention probabilistic Turing machines.\nRelated complexity classes.\nThe definition of RP says that a YES-answer is always right and that a NO-answer might be wrong, as a YES-instance can return a NO-answer. The complexity class co-RP is the complement, where a YES-answer might be wrong while a NO-answer is always right.\nThe class BPP describes algorithms that can give incorrect answers on both YES and NO instances, and thus contains both RP and co-RP. The intersection of the sets RP and co-RP is called ZPP. Just as RP may be called R, some authors use the name co-R rather than co-RP.\nConnection to P and NP.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Unsolved/styles.css\" /&gt;\nUnsolved problem in computer science\nMore unsolved problems in computer science\nP is a subset of RP, which is a subset of NP. Similarly, P is a subset of co-RP which is a subset of co-NP. It is not known whether these inclusions are strict. However, if the commonly believed conjecture P = BPP is true, then RP, co-RP, and P collapse (are all equal). Assuming in addition that P \u2260 NP, this then implies that RP is strictly contained in NP. It is not known whether RP = co-RP, or whether RP is a subset of the intersection of NP and co-NP, though this would be implied by P = BPP.\nA natural example of a problem in co-RP currently not known to be in P is Polynomial Identity Testing, the problem of deciding whether a given multivariate arithmetic expression over the integers is the zero-polynomial. For instance, \"x\"\u00b7\"x\" \u2212 \"y\"\u00b7\"y\" \u2212 (\"x\" + \"y\")\u00b7(\"x\" \u2212 \"y\") is the zero-polynomial while\n\"x\"\u00b7\"x\" + \"y\"\u00b7\"y\" is not.\nAn alternative characterization of RP that is sometimes easier to use is the set of problems recognizable by nondeterministic Turing machines where the machine accepts if and only if at least some constant fraction of the computation paths, independent of the input size, accept. NP on the other hand, needs only one accepting path, which could constitute an exponentially small fraction of the paths. This characterization makes the fact that RP is a subset of NP obvious.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "54772", "revid": "39177298", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54772", "title": "ZPP (complexity)", "text": "Concept in computer science\nIn complexity theory, ZPP (zero-error probabilistic polynomial time) is the complexity class of problems for which a probabilistic Turing machine exists with these properties:\nIn other words, if the algorithm is allowed to flip a truly-random coin while it is running, it will always return the correct answer and, for a problem of size \"n\", there is some polynomial \"p\"(\"n\") such that the average running time will be less than \"p\"(\"n\"), even though it might occasionally be much longer. Such an algorithm is called a Las Vegas algorithm.\nAlternatively, ZPP can be defined as the class of problems for which a probabilistic Turing machine exists with these properties:\nThe two definitions are equivalent.\nThe definition of ZPP is based on probabilistic Turing machines, but, for clarity, note that other complexity classes based on them include BPP and RP. The class BQP is based on another machine with randomness: the quantum computer.\nIntersection definition.\nThe class ZPP is exactly equal to the intersection of the classes RP and co-RP. This is often taken to be the definition of ZPP. To show this, first note that every problem which is in \"both\" RP and co-RP has a Las Vegas algorithm as follows:\nNote that only one machine can ever give a wrong answer, and the chance of that machine giving the wrong answer during each repetition is at most 50%. This means that the chance of reaching the \"k\"th round shrinks exponentially in \"k\", showing that the expected running time is polynomial. This shows that RP intersect co-RP is contained in ZPP.\nTo show that ZPP is contained in RP intersect co-RP, suppose we have a Las Vegas algorithm C to solve a problem. We can then construct the following RP algorithm:\nBy Markov's Inequality, the chance that it will yield an answer before we stop it is at least 1/2. This means the chance we'll give the wrong answer on a YES instance, by stopping and yielding NO, is at most 1/2, fitting the definition of an RP algorithm. The co-RP algorithm is identical, except that it gives YES if C \"times out\".\nWitness and proof.\nThe classes NP, RP and ZPP can be thought of in terms of proof of membership in a set.\nDefinition: A \"verifier\" V for a set X is a Turing machine such that:\nThe string \"w\" can be thought of as the proof of membership. In the case of short proofs (of length bounded by a polynomial in the size of the input) which can be efficiently verified (\"V\" is a polynomial-time deterministic Turing machine), the string \"w\" is called a \"witness\". \nNotes:\nThe classes NP, RP and ZPP are sets which have witnesses for membership. The class NP requires only that witnesses exist. They may be very rare. Of the 2\"f\"(|\"x\"|) possible strings, with \"f\" a polynomial, only one need cause the verifier to accept (if x is in X. If x is not in X, no string will cause the verifier to accept). \nFor the classes RP and ZPP any string chosen at random will likely be a witness.\nThe corresponding co-classes have witness for non-membership. In particular, co-RP is the class of sets for which, if x is not in X, any randomly chosen string is likely to be a witness for non-membership. ZPP is the class of sets for which any random string is likely to be a witness of x in X, or x not in X, which ever the case may be.\nConnecting this definition with other definitions of RP, co-RP and ZPP is easy. The probabilistic polynomial-time Turing Machine \"V*w\"(\"x\") corresponds to the deterministic polynomial-time Turing Machine \"V\"(\"x\", \"w\") by replacing the random tape of \"V*\" with a second input tape for V on which is written the sequence of coin flips. By selecting the witness as a random string, the verifier is a probabilistic polynomial-time Turing Machine whose probability of accepting x when x is in \"X\" is large (greater than 1/2, say), but zero if \"x\" \u2209 \"X\" (for RP); of rejecting x when x is not in X is large but zero if \"x\" \u2208 \"X\" (for co-RP); and of correctly accepting or rejecting \"x\" as a member of \"X\" is large, but zero of incorrectly accepting or rejecting x (for ZPP).\nBy repeated random selection of a possible witness, the large probability that a random string is a witness gives an expected polynomial time algorithm for accepting or rejecting an input. Conversely, if the Turing Machine is expected polynomial-time (for any given x), then a considerable fraction of the runs must be polynomial-time bounded, and the coin sequence used in such a run will be a witness.\nZPP should be contrasted with BPP. The class BPP does not require witnesses, although witnesses are sufficient (hence BPP contains RP, co-RP and ZPP). A BPP language has V(x,w) accept on a (clear) majority of strings w if x is in X, and conversely reject on a (clear) majority of strings w if x is not in \"X\". No single string w need be definitive, and therefore they cannot in general be considered proofs or witnesses.\nComplexity-theoretic properties.\nZPP is closed under complement, i.e., ZPP = co-ZPP (this follows from ZPP = RP \u2229 co-RP). \nZPP is low for itself, meaning that a ZPP machine with the power to solve ZPP problems instantly (a ZPP oracle machine) is not any more powerful than the machine without this extra power. In symbols, ZPPZPP = ZPP.\nZPPNPBPP = ZPPNP.\nNPBPP is contained in ZPPNP.\nConnection to other classes.\nSince ZPP = RP \u2229 coRP, ZPP is obviously contained in both RP and coRP.\nThe class P is contained in ZPP, and some computer scientists have conjectured that P = ZPP, i.e., every Las Vegas algorithm has a deterministic polynomial-time equivalent.\nThere exists an oracle relative to which ZPP = EXPTIME. A proof for ZPP = EXPTIME would imply that P \u2260 ZPP, as P \u2260 EXPTIME (see time hierarchy theorem)."}

The name 'cherry' also refers to the cherry tree and its wood, and is sometimes applied to almonds and visually similar flowering trees in the genus \"Prunus\", as in \"ornamental cherry\" or \"cherry blossom\". Wild cherry may refer to any of the cherry species growing outside cultivation, although \"Prunus avium\" is often referred to specifically by the name \"wild cherry\" in the British Isles.\nBotany.\nTrue cherries.\n\"Prunus\" subg. \"Cerasus\" contains species that are typically called cherries. They are known as true cherries and distinguished by having a single winter bud per axil, by having the flowers in small corymbs or umbels of several together (occasionally solitary, e.g. \"P.\u00a0serrula\"; some species with short racemes, e.g. \"P.\u00a0maacki\"), and by having smooth fruit with no obvious groove. Examples of true cherries are:\nBush cherries.\nBush cherries are characterized by having three winter buds per axil. They used to be included in \"Prunus\" subg. \"Cerasus\", but phylogenetic research indicates they should be a section of \"Prunus\" subg. \"Prunus\". Examples of bush cherries are:\nBird cherries, cherry laurels, and other racemose cherries.\n\"Prunus\" subg. \"Padus\" contains most racemose species that are called cherries which used to be included in the genera \"Padus\" (bird cherries), \"Laurocerasus\" (cherry laurels), \"Pygeum\" (tropical species such as African cherry) and \"Maddenia\". Examples of the racemose cherries are:\nEtymology.\nThe English word cherry derives from Old Northern French or Norman \"cherise\" from the Latin \"cerasum\", referring to an ancient Greek region, Kerasous (\u039a\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03c3\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2) near Giresun, Turkey, from which cherries were first thought to be exported to Europe.\nThe word \"cherry\" is also used for some species that bear fruits with similar size and shape even though they are not in the same \"Prunus\" genus; some of these species include the \"Jamaican cherry\" (\"Muntingia calabura\") and the \"Spanish cherry\" (\"Mimusops elengi\").\nAntiquity.\nThe indigenous range of the sweet cherry extends through most of Europe, western Asia, and parts of northern Africa, and the fruit has been consumed throughout its range since prehistoric times. A cultivated cherry is recorded as having been brought to Rome by Lucius Licinius Lucullus from northeastern Anatolia, also known as the Pontus region, in 72\u00a0BCE.\nCherries were introduced into England at Teynham, near Sittingbourne in Kent, by order of Henry VIII, who had tasted them in Flanders.\nCherries, along with many other fruiting trees and plants, probably first arrived in North America around 1606 in the New France colony of Port Royal, which is modern-day Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia. Richard Guthrie described in 1629, the \"fruitful valley adorned with...great variety of fruit trees, chestnuts, pears, apples, cherries, plums and all other fruits.\"\nCultivation.\nThe most common cherry species in cultivation is sweet cherry (\"P.\u00a0avium\") to which most cherry cultivars belong. The sour cherry (\"P.\u00a0cerasus\") is also cultivated, mainly for cooking. Both species originate in Europe and western Asia; they usually do not cross-pollinate. In East Asia, Chinese cherry (\"P.\u00a0pseudocerasus\") and downy cherry (\"P.\u00a0tomentosa\") have been cultivated for thousands of years for their sweet fruits.\nIrrigation, spraying, labor, and their propensity to damage from rain and hail make cherries relatively expensive. Nonetheless, demand is high for the fruit. In commercial production, sour cherries, as well as sweet cherries sometimes, are harvested by using a mechanized \"shaker.\" Hand picking is also widely used for sweet as well as sour cherries to harvest the fruit to avoid damage to both fruit and trees.\nCommon rootstocks include Mazzard, Mahaleb, Colt, and Gisela Series, a dwarfing rootstock that produces trees significantly smaller than others, only 8 to 10 feet (2.5 to 3 meters) tall. Sour cherries require no pollenizer, while few sweet varieties are self-fertile.\nA cherry tree will take three to four years once it is planted in the orchard to produce its first crop of fruit, and seven years to attain full maturity.\nGrowing season.\nLike most temperate-latitude trees, cherry trees require a certain number of chilling hours each year to break dormancy and bloom and produce fruit. The number of chilling hours required depends on the variety. Because of this cold-weather requirement, no members of the genus \"Prunus\" can grow in tropical climates. (See \"production\" section for more information on chilling requirements)\nCherries have a short growing season and can grow in most temperate latitudes. Cherries blossom in April (in the Northern Hemisphere) and the peak season for the cherry harvest is in the summer. In southern Europe in June, in North America in June, in England in mid-July, and in southern British Columbia (Canada) in June to mid-August. In many parts of North America, they are among the first tree fruits to flower and ripen in mid-Spring.\nIn the Southern Hemisphere, cherries are usually at their peak in late December and are widely associated with Christmas. 'Burlat' is an early variety which ripens during the beginning of December, 'Lapins' ripens near the end of December, and 'Sweetheart' finish slightly later.\nPests and diseases.\nGenerally, the cherry can be a difficult fruit tree to grow and keep alive. In Europe, the first visible pest in the growing season soon after blossom (in April in western Europe) usually is the black cherry aphid (\"cherry blackfly,\" \"Myzus cerasi\"), which causes leaves at the tips of branches to curl, with the blackfly colonies exuding a sticky secretion which promotes fungal growth on the leaves and fruit. At the fruiting stage in June/July (Europe), the cherry fruit fly (\"Rhagoletis cingulata\" and \"Rhagoletis cerasi\") lays its eggs in the immature fruit, whereafter its larvae feed on the cherry flesh and exit through a small hole (about 1\u00a0mm diameter), which in turn is the entry point for fungal infection of the cherry fruit after rainfall. In addition, cherry trees are susceptible to bacterial canker, cytospora canker, brown rot of the fruit, root rot from overly wet soil, crown rot, and several viruses.\nCultivars.\nThe following cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit:\nSee cherry blossom and \"Prunus\" for ornamental trees.\nProduction.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn 2020, world production of sweet cherries was 2.61 million tonnes, with Turkey producing 28% of this total. Other major producers of sweet cherries were the United States and Chile. World production of sour cherries in 2020 was 1.48 million tonnes, led by Russia, Turkey, Ukraine and Serbia.\nMiddle East.\nMajor commercial cherry orchards in West Asia are in Turkey, Iran, Syria, Lebanon, and Azerbaijan.\nEurope.\nMajor commercial cherry orchards in Europe are in Turkey, Italy, Spain and other Mediterranean regions, and to a smaller extent in the Baltic States and southern Scandinavia.\nIn France since the 1920s, the first cherries of the season come in April/May from the region of C\u00e9ret (Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales), where the local producers send, as a tradition since 1932, the first crate of cherries to the president of the Republic.\nNorth America.\nIn the United States, most sweet cherries are grown in Washington, California, Oregon, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Important sweet cherry cultivars include Bing, Ulster, Rainier, Brooks, Tulare, King, and Sweetheart. Both Oregon and Michigan provide light-colored 'Royal Ann' ('Napoleon'; alternately 'Queen Anne') cherries for the maraschino cherry process. Most sour (also called tart) cherries are grown in Michigan, followed by Utah, New York, and Washington. Sour cherries include 'Nanking' and 'Evans.' Traverse City, Michigan is called the \"Cherry Capital of the World\", hosting a National Cherry Festival and making the world's largest cherry pie. The specific region of northern Michigan known for tart cherry production is referred to as the \"Traverse Bay\" region.\nMost cherry varieties have a chilling requirement of 800 or more hours, meaning that in order to break dormancy, blossom, and set fruit, the winter season needs to have at least 800 hours where the temperature is below . \"Low chill\" varieties requiring 300 hours or less are Minnie Royal and Royal Lee, requiring cross-pollinization, whereas the cultivar, Royal Crimson, is self-fertile. These varieties extend the range of cultivation of cherries to the mild winter areas of southern US. This is a boon to California producers of sweet cherries, as California is the second largest producer of sweet cherries in the US.\nNative and non-native sweet cherries grow well in Canada's provinces of Ontario and British Columbia where an annual cherry festival has been celebrated for seven consecutive decades in the Okanagan Valley town of Osoyoos. In addition to the Okanagan, other British Columbia cherry growing regions are the Similkameen Valley and Kootenay Valley, all three regions together producing 5.5 million kg annually or 60% of total Canadian output. Sweet cherry varieties in British Columbia include 'Rainier', 'Van', 'Chelan', 'Lapins', 'Sweetheart', 'Skeena', 'Staccato', 'Christalina' and 'Bing.'\nAustralia.\nIn Australia, cherries are grown in all the states except for the Northern Territory. The major producing regions are located in the temperate areas within New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. Western Australia has limited production in the elevated parts in the southwest of the state. Key production areas include Young, Orange and Bathurst in New South Wales, Wandin, the Goulburn and Murray valley areas in Victoria, the Adelaide Hills region in South Australia, and the Huon and Derwent Valleys in Tasmania.\nKey commercial varieties in order of seasonality include 'Empress', 'Merchant', 'Supreme', 'Ron's seedling', 'Chelan', 'Ulster', 'Van', 'Bing', 'Stella', 'Nordwunder', 'Lapins', 'Simone', 'Regina', 'Kordia' and 'Sweetheart'. New varieties are being introduced, including the late season 'Staccato' and early season 'Sequoia'. The Australian Cherry Breeding program is developing a series of new varieties which are under testing evaluation.\nThe New South Wales town of Young is called the \"Cherry Capital of Australia\" and hosts the National Cherry Festival.\nNutritional value.\nRaw sweet cherries are 82% water, 16% carbohydrates, 1% protein, and negligible in fat (table). As raw fruit, sweet cherries provide little nutrient content per 100 g serving, as only dietary fiber and vitamin C are present in moderate content, while other vitamins and dietary minerals each supply less than 10% of the Daily Value (DV) per serving, respectively (table).\nCompared to sweet cherries, raw sour cherries contain 50% more vitamin C per 100 g (12% DV) and about 20 times more vitamin A (8% DV), beta-Carotene in particular (table).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nHealth risks.\nThe cherry kernels, accessible by chewing or breaking the hard-shelled cherry pits, contain amygdalin, a chemical that releases the toxic compound hydrogen cyanide when ingested. The amount of amygdalin in each cherry varies widely, and symptoms would show only after eating several crushed pits (3\u20134 of the Morello variety or 7\u20139 of the red or black varieties). Swallowing the pits whole normally causes no complications.\nOther uses.\nCherry wood is valued for its rich color and straight grain in manufacturing fine furniture, particularly desks, tables and chairs.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "54783", "revid": "17397759", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54783", "title": "Music theory", "text": "Study of the practices and possibilities of music\nMusic theory is the study of theoretical frameworks for understanding the practices and possibilities of music. \"The Oxford Companion to Music\" describes three interrelated uses of the term \"music theory\": The first is the \"rudiments\", that are needed to understand music notation (key signatures, time signatures, and rhythmic notation); the second is learning scholars' views on music from antiquity to the present; the third is a sub-topic of musicology that \"seeks to define processes and general principles in music\". The musicological approach to theory differs from music analysis \"in that it takes as its starting-point not the individual work or performance but the fundamental materials from which it is built.\"\nMusic theory is frequently concerned with describing how musicians and composers make music, including tuning systems and composition methods among other topics. Because of the ever-expanding conception of what constitutes music, a more inclusive definition could be the consideration of any sonic phenomena, including silence. This is not an absolute guideline, however; for example, the study of \"music\" in the \"Quadrivium\" liberal arts university curriculum, that was common in medieval Europe, was an abstract system of proportions that was carefully studied at a distance from actual musical practice. But this medieval discipline became the basis for tuning systems in later centuries and is generally included in modern scholarship on the history of music theory.\nMusic theory as a practical discipline encompasses the methods and concepts that composers and other musicians use in creating and performing music. The development, preservation, and transmission of music theory in this sense may be found in oral and written music-making traditions, musical instruments, and other artifacts. For example, ancient instruments from prehistoric sites around the world reveal details about the music they produced and potentially something of the musical theory that might have been used by their makers. In ancient and living cultures around the world, the deep and long roots of music theory are visible in instruments, oral traditions, and current music-making. Many cultures have also considered music theory in more formal ways such as written treatises and music notation. Practical and scholarly traditions overlap, as many practical treatises about music place themselves within a tradition of other treatises, which are cited regularly just as scholarly writing cites earlier research.\nIn modern academia, music theory is a subfield of musicology, the wider study of musical cultures and history. Guido Adler, however, in one of the texts that founded musicology in the late 19th century, wrote that \"the science of music originated at the same time as the art of sounds\", where \"the science of music\" (\"Musikwissenschaft\") obviously meant \"music theory\". Adler added that music only could exist when one began measuring pitches and comparing them to each other. He concluded that \"all people for which one can speak of an art of sounds also have a science of sounds\". One must deduce that music theory exists in all musical cultures of the world.\nMusic theory is often concerned with abstract musical aspects such as tuning and tonal systems, scales, consonance and dissonance, and rhythmic relationships. There is also a body of theory concerning practical aspects, such as the creation or the performance of music, orchestration, ornamentation, improvisation, and electronic sound production. A person who researches or teaches music theory is a music theorist. University study, typically to the MA or PhD level, is required to teach as a tenure-track music theorist in a US or Canadian university. Methods of analysis include mathematics, graphic analysis, and especially analysis enabled by western music notation. Comparative, descriptive, statistical, and other methods are also used. Music theory textbooks, especially in the United States of America, often include elements of musical acoustics, considerations of musical notation, and techniques of tonal composition (harmony and counterpoint), among other topics.\nHistory.\nAntiquity.\nMesopotamia.\nSeveral surviving Sumerian and Akkadian clay tablets include musical information of a theoretical nature, mainly lists of intervals and tunings. The scholar Sam Mirelman reports that the earliest of these texts dates from before 1500\u00a0BCE, a millennium earlier than surviving evidence from any other culture of comparable musical thought. Further, \"All the Mesopotamian texts [about music] are united by the use of a terminology for music that, according to the approximate dating of the texts, was in use for over 1,000 years.\"\nChina.\nMuch of Chinese music history and theory remains unclear.\nChinese theory starts from numbers, the main musical numbers being twelve, five and eight. Twelve refers to the number of pitches on which the scales can be constructed, Five refers to the Pentatonic Scale (primarily uses a 5-note scale), And Eight refers to the eight categories of Chinese Music Instruments; classified by the material they are made from: (Metal, Stone, Silk, Bamboo, Gourd, Clay, Leather, and Wood). The L\u00fcshi chunqiu from about 238\u00a0BCE recalls the legend of Ling Lun. On order of the Yellow Emperor, Ling Lun collected twelve bamboo lengths with thick and even nodes. Blowing on one of these like a pipe, he found its sound agreeable and named it \"huangzhong\", the \"Yellow Bell\". He then heard phoenixes singing. The male and female phoenix each sang six tones. Ling Lun cut his bamboo pipes to match the pitches of the phoenixes, producing twelve pitch pipes in two sets: six from the male phoenix and six from the female: these were called the \"l\u00fcl\u00fc\" or later the \"shierl\u00fc\".\nApart from technical and structural aspects, ancient Chinese music theory also discusses topics such as the nature and functions of music. The \"Yueji\" (\"Record of music\", c1st and 2nd centuries BCE), for example, manifests Confucian moral theories of understanding music in its social context. Studied and implemented by Confucian scholar-officials [...], these theories helped form a musical Confucianism that overshadowed but did not erase rival approaches. These include the assertion of Mozi (c. 468 \u2013 c. 376\u00a0BCE) that music wasted human and material resources, and Laozi's claim that the greatest music had no sounds. [...] Even the music of the \"qin\" zither, a genre closely affiliated with Confucian scholar-officials, includes many works with Daoist references, such as \"Tianfeng huanpei\" (\"Heavenly Breeze and Sounds of Jade Pendants\").\nIndia.\nThe Samaveda and Yajurveda (c. 1200 \u2013 1000\u00a0BCE) are among the earliest testimonies of Indian music, but properly speaking, they contain no theory. The Natya Shastra, written between 200\u00a0BCE to 200\u00a0CE, discusses intervals (\"\u015arutis\"), scales (\"Gr\u0101mas\"), consonances and dissonances, classes of melodic structure (\"M\u016brchan\u0101s\", modes?), melodic types (\"J\u0101tis\"), instruments, etc.\nGreece.\nEarly preserved Greek writings on music theory include two types of works:\nSeveral names of theorists are known before these works, including Pythagoras (c.\u2009570 ~ c.\u2009495\u00a0BCE), Philolaus (c.), and others.\nWorks of the first type (technical manuals) include\nMore philosophical treatises of the second type include\nPost-classical or Medieval Period.\nChina.\nThe pipa instrument carried with it a theory of musical modes that subsequently led to the Sui and Tang theory of 84 musical modes.\nArabic countries / Persian countries.\nMedieval Arabic music theorists include:\nEurope.\nThe Latin treatise \"\" by the Roman philosopher Boethius (written c. 500, translated as \"Fundamentals of Music\") was a touchstone for other writings on music in medieval Europe. Boethius represented Classical authority on music during the Middle Ages, as the Greek writings on which he based his work were not read or translated by later Europeans until the 15th century. This treatise carefully maintains distance from the actual practice of music, focusing mostly on the mathematical proportions involved in tuning systems and on the moral character of particular modes. Several centuries later, treatises began to appear which dealt with the actual composition of pieces of music in the plainchant tradition. At the end of the ninth century, Hucbald worked towards more precise pitch notation for the neumes used to record plainchant.\nGuido d'Arezzo wrote a letter to Michael of Pomposa in 1028, entitled \"\", in which he introduced the practice of using syllables to describe notes and intervals. This was the source of the hexachordal solmization that was to be used until the end of the Middle Ages. Guido also wrote about emotional qualities of the modes, the phrase structure of plainchant, the temporal meaning of the neumes, etc.; his chapters on polyphony \"come closer to describing and illustrating real music than any previous account\" in the Western tradition.\nDuring the thirteenth century, a new rhythm system called mensural notation grew out of an earlier, more limited method of notating rhythms in terms of fixed repetitive patterns, the so-called \"rhythmic modes\", which were developed in France around 1200. An early form of mensural notation was first described and codified in the treatise \"\" (\"The art of measured chant\") by Franco of Cologne (c. 1280). Mensural notation used different note shapes to specify different durations, allowing scribes to capture rhythms which varied instead of repeating the same fixed pattern; it is a proportional notation, in the sense that each note value is equal to two or three times the shorter value, or half or a third of the longer value. This same notation, transformed through various extensions and improvements during the Renaissance, forms the basis for rhythmic notation in European classical music today.\nModern.\nMiddle Eastern and Central Asian countries.\nD'Erlanger divulges that the Arabic music scale is derived from the Greek music scale, and that Arabic music is connected to certain features of Arabic culture, such as astrology.\nFundamentals of music.\nMusic is composed of aural phenomena; \"music theory\" considers how those phenomena apply in music. Music theory considers melody, rhythm, counterpoint, harmony, form, tonal systems, scales, tuning, intervals, consonance, dissonance, durational proportions, the acoustics of pitch systems, composition, performance, orchestration, ornamentation, improvisation, electronic sound production, etc.\nPitch.\nPitch is the lowness or highness of a tone, for example the difference between middle C and a higher C. The frequency of the sound waves producing a pitch can be measured precisely, but the perception of pitch is more complex because single notes from natural sources are usually a complex mix of many frequencies. Accordingly, theorists often describe pitch as a subjective sensation rather than an objective measurement of sound.\nSpecific frequencies are often assigned letter names. Today most orchestras assign concert A (the A above middle C on the piano) to the frequency of 440\u00a0Hz. This assignment is somewhat arbitrary; for example, in 1859 France, the same A was tuned to 435\u00a0Hz. Such differences can have a noticeable effect on the timbre of instruments and other phenomena. Thus, in historically informed performance of older music, tuning is often set to match the tuning used in the period when it was written. Additionally, many cultures do not attempt to standardize pitch, often considering that it should be allowed to vary depending on genre, style, mood, etc.\nThe difference in pitch between two notes is called an interval. The most basic interval is the unison, which is simply two notes of the same pitch. The octave interval is two pitches that are either double or half the frequency of one another. The unique characteristics of octaves gave rise to the concept of pitch class: pitches of the same letter name that occur in different octaves may be grouped into a single \"class\" by ignoring the difference in octave. For example, a high C and a low C are members of the same pitch class\u2014the class that contains all C's.\nMusical tuning systems, or temperaments, determine the precise size of intervals. Tuning systems vary widely within and between world cultures. In Western culture, there have long been several competing tuning systems, all with different qualities. Internationally, the system known as equal temperament is most commonly used today because it is considered the most satisfactory compromise that allows instruments of fixed tuning (e.g. the piano) to sound acceptably in tune in all keys.\nScales and modes.\nNotes can be arranged in a variety of scales and modes. Western music theory generally divides the octave into a series of twelve pitches, called a chromatic scale, within which the interval between adjacent tones is called a semitone, or half step. Selecting tones from this set of 12 and arranging them in patterns of semitones and whole tones creates other scales.\nThe most commonly encountered scales are the seven-toned major, the harmonic minor, the melodic minor, and the natural minor. Other examples of scales are the octatonic scale and the pentatonic or five-tone scale, which is common in folk music and blues. Non-Western cultures often use scales that do not correspond with an equally divided twelve-tone division of the octave. For example, classical Ottoman, Persian, Indian and Arabic musical systems often make use of multiples of quarter tones (half the size of a semitone, as the name indicates), for instance in 'neutral' seconds (three quarter tones) or 'neutral' thirds (seven quarter tones)\u2014they do not normally use the quarter tone itself as a direct interval.\nIn traditional Western notation, the scale used for a composition is usually indicated by a key signature at the beginning to designate the pitches that make up that scale. As the music progresses, the pitches used may change and introduce a different scale. Music can be transposed from one scale to another for various purposes, often to accommodate the range of a vocalist. Such transposition raises or lowers the overall pitch range, but preserves the intervallic relationships of the original scale. For example, transposition from the key of C major to D major raises all pitches of the scale of C major equally by a whole tone. Since the interval relationships remain unchanged, transposition may be unnoticed by a listener, however other qualities may change noticeably because transposition changes the relationship of the overall pitch range compared to the range of the instruments or voices that perform the music. This often affects the music's overall sound, as well as having technical implications for the performers.\nThe interrelationship of the keys most commonly used in Western tonal music is conveniently shown by the circle of fifths. Unique key signatures are also sometimes devised for a particular composition. During the Baroque period, emotional associations with specific keys, known as the doctrine of the affections, were an important topic in music theory, but the unique tonal colorings of keys that gave rise to that doctrine were largely erased with the adoption of equal temperament. However, many musicians continue to feel that certain keys are more appropriate to certain emotions than others. Indian classical music theory continues to strongly associate keys with emotional states, times of day, and other extra-musical concepts and notably, does not employ equal temperament.\nConsonance and dissonance.\nConsonance and dissonance are subjective qualities of the sonority of intervals that vary widely in different cultures and over the ages. Consonance (or concord) is a feeling that an interval or chord is stable, harmonious, or complete. While dissonance (or discord) is a feeling that the interval or chords are incomplete, clashing, or unresolved. In western music theory, perfect fourths, fifths, and octaves and all major and minor thirds and sixths are considered consonant, while other intervals are considered dissonant to a greater or lesser degree.\nContext and many other aspects can affect apparent dissonance and consonance. For example, in a Debussy prelude, a major second may sound stable and consonant, while the same interval may sound dissonant in a Bach fugue. In the Common practice era, the perfect fourth is considered dissonant when not supported by a lower third or fifth. Since the early 20th century, Arnold Schoenberg's concept of \"emancipated\" dissonance, in which traditionally dissonant intervals can be treated as \"higher\", more remote consonances, has become more widely accepted.\nRhythm.\nRhythm is produced by the sequential arrangement of sounds and silences in time. Meter measures music in regular pulse groupings, called measures or bars. The time signature or meter signature specifies how many beats are in a measure, and which value of written note is counted or felt as a single beat.\nThrough increased stress, or variations in duration or articulation, particular tones may be accented. There are conventions in most musical traditions for regular and hierarchical accentuation of beats to reinforce a given meter. Syncopated rhythms contradict those conventions by accenting unexpected parts of the beat. Playing simultaneous rhythms in more than one time signature is called polyrhythm.\nIn recent years, rhythm and meter have become an important area of research among music scholars. The most highly cited of these recent scholars are Maury Yeston, Fred Lerdahl and Ray Jackendoff, Jonathan Kramer, and Justin London.\nMelody.\nA melody is a group of sounds in succession, a tune, or an arrangement. Melody is often a prominent aspect of music, and so its construction and qualities are a primary interest of music theory.\nThe basic elements of melody are pitch, duration, rhythm, and tempo. The tones of a melody are usually drawn from pitch systems such as scales or modes. Melody may consist, to increasing degree, of the figure, motive, semi-phrase, antecedent and consequent phrase, and period or sentence. The period may be considered the complete melody, however some examples combine two periods, or use other combinations of constituents to create larger form melodies.\nChord.\nA chord, in music, is any harmonic set of three or more notes that is heard as if sounding simultaneously. These need not actually be played together: arpeggios and broken chords may, for many practical and theoretical purposes, constitute chords. Chords and sequences of chords are frequently used in modern Western, West African, and Oceanian music, whereas they are absent from the music of many other parts of the world.\nThe most frequently encountered chords are triads, so called because they consist of three distinct notes: further notes may be added to give seventh chords, extended chords, or added tone chords. The most common chords are the \"major\" and \"minor triads\" and then the \"augmented\" and \"diminished triads\". The descriptions \"major\", \"minor\", \"augmented\", and \"diminished\" are sometimes referred to collectively as chordal \"quality\". Chords are also commonly classed by their root note\u2014so, for instance, the chord C major may be described as a triad of major quality built on the note C. Chords may also be classified by inversion, the order in which the notes are stacked.\nA series of chords is called a chord progression. Although any chord may in principle be followed by any other chord, certain patterns of chords have been accepted as establishing key in common-practice harmony. To describe this, chords are numbered, using Roman numerals (upward from the key-note), per their diatonic function. Common ways of notating or representing chords in western music other than conventional staff notation include Roman numerals, figured bass (much used in the Baroque era), chord letters (sometimes used in modern musicology), and various systems of chord charts typically found in the lead sheets used in popular music to lay out the sequence of chords so that the musician may play accompaniment chords or improvise a solo.\nHarmony.\nIn music, harmony is the use of simultaneous pitches (tones, notes), or chords. The study of harmony involves chords and their construction and chord progressions and the principles of connection that govern them. Harmony is often said to refer to the \"vertical\" aspect of music, as distinguished from melodic line, or the \"horizontal\" aspect. Counterpoint, which refers to the interweaving of melodic lines, and polyphony, which refers to the relationship of separate independent voices, is thus sometimes distinguished from harmony.\nIn popular and jazz harmony, chords are named by their root plus various terms and characters indicating their qualities. For example, a lead sheet may indicate chords such as C major, D minor, and G dominant seventh. In many types of music, notably Baroque, Romantic, modern, and jazz, chords are often augmented with \"tensions\". A tension is an additional chord member that creates a relatively dissonant interval in relation to the bass. It is part of a chord, but is not one of the chord tones (1 3 5 7). Typically, in the classical common practice period a dissonant chord (chord with tension) \"resolves\" to a consonant chord. Harmonization usually sounds pleasant to the ear when there is a balance between the consonant and dissonant sounds. In simple words, that occurs when there is a balance between \"tense\" and \"relaxed\" moments.\nTimbre.\nTimbre, sometimes called \"color\", or \"tone color\", is the principal phenomenon that allows us to distinguish one instrument from another when both play at the same pitch and volume, a quality of a voice or instrument often described in terms like bright, dull, shrill, etc. It is of considerable interest in music theory, especially because it is one component of music that has as yet, no standardized nomenclature. It has been called \"... the psychoacoustician's multidimensional waste-basket category for everything that cannot be labeled pitch or loudness,\" but can be accurately described and analyzed by Fourier analysis and other methods because it results from the combination of all sound frequencies, attack and release envelopes, and other qualities that a tone comprises.\nTimbre is principally determined by two things: (1) the relative balance of overtones produced by a given instrument due its construction (e.g. shape, material), and (2) the envelope of the sound (including changes in the overtone structure over time). Timbre varies widely between different instruments, voices, and to lesser degree, between instruments of the same type due to variations in their construction, and significantly, the performer's technique. The timbre of most instruments can be changed by employing different techniques while playing. For example, the timbre of a trumpet changes when a mute is inserted into the bell, the player changes their embouchure, or volume.\nA voice can change its timbre by the way the performer manipulates their vocal apparatus, (e.g. the shape of the vocal cavity or mouth). Musical notation frequently specifies alteration in timbre by changes in sounding technique, volume, accent, and other means. These are indicated variously by symbolic and verbal instruction. For example, the word \"dolce\" (sweetly) indicates a non-specific, but commonly understood soft and \"sweet\" timbre. \"Sul tasto\" instructs a string player to bow near or over the fingerboard to produce a less brilliant sound. \"Cuivre\" instructs a brass player to produce a forced and stridently brassy sound. Accent symbols like \"marcato\" (^) and dynamic indications (\"pp\") can also indicate changes in timbre.\nDynamics.\nIn music, \"dynamics\" normally refers to variations of intensity or volume, as may be measured by physicists and audio engineers in decibels or phons. In music notation, however, dynamics are not treated as absolute values, but as relative ones. Because they are usually measured subjectively, there are factors besides amplitude that affect the performance or perception of intensity, such as timbre, vibrato, and articulation.\nThe conventional indications of dynamics are abbreviations for Italian words like \"forte\" (f) for loud and \"piano\" (p) for soft. These two basic notations are modified by indications including \"mezzo piano\" (mp) for moderately soft (literally \"half soft\") and \"mezzo forte\" (mf) for moderately loud, \"sforzando\" or \"sforzato\" (sfz) for a surging or \"pushed\" attack, or \"fortepiano\" (fp) for a loud attack with a sudden decrease to a soft level. The full span of these markings usually range from a nearly inaudible \"pianissississimo\" (pppp) to a loud-as-possible \"fortissississimo\" (ffff).\nGreater extremes of pppppp and fffff and nuances such as p+ or \"pi\u00f9 piano\" are sometimes found. Other systems of indicating volume are also used in both notation and analysis: dB (decibels), numerical scales, colored or different sized notes, words in languages other than Italian, and symbols such as those for progressively increasing volume (\"crescendo\") or decreasing volume (\"diminuendo\" or \"decrescendo\"), often called \"hairpins\" when indicated with diverging or converging lines as shown in the graphic above.\nArticulation.\nArticulation is the way the performer sounds notes. For example, \"staccato\" is the shortening of duration compared to the written note value, \"legato\" performs the notes in a smoothly joined sequence with no separation. Articulation is often described rather than quantified, therefore there is room to interpret how to execute precisely each articulation.\nFor example, \"staccato\" is often referred to as \"separated\" or \"detached\" rather than having a defined or numbered amount by which to reduce the notated duration. Violin players use a variety of techniques to perform different qualities of \"staccato.\" The manner in which a performer decides to execute a given articulation is usually based on the context of the piece or phrase, but many articulation symbols and verbal instructions depend on the instrument and musical period (e.g. viol, wind; classical, baroque; etc.).\nThere is a set of articulations that most instruments and voices perform in common. They are\u2014from long to short: \"legato\" (smooth, connected); \"tenuto\" (pressed or played to full notated duration); \"marcato\" (accented and detached); \"staccato\" (\"separated\", \"detached\"); \"martel\u00e9\" (heavily accented or \"hammered\"). Many of these can be combined to create certain \"in-between\" articulations. For example, \"portato\" is the combination of \"tenuto\" and \"staccato\". Some instruments have unique methods by which to produce sounds, such as \"spiccato\" for bowed strings, where the bow bounces off the string.\nTexture.\nIn music, texture is how the melodic, rhythmic, and harmonic materials are combined in a composition, thus determining the overall quality of the sound in a piece. Texture is often described in regard to the density, or thickness, and range, or width, between lowest and highest pitches, in relative terms as well as more specifically distinguished according to the number of voices, or parts, and the relationship between these voices. For example, a thick texture contains many \"layers\" of instruments. One of these layers could be a string section, or another brass.\nThe thickness also is affected by the number and the richness of the instruments playing the piece. The thickness varies from light to thick. A lightly textured piece will have light, sparse scoring. A thickly or heavily textured piece will be scored for many instruments. A piece's texture may be affected by the number and character of parts playing at once, the timbre of the instruments or voices playing these parts and the harmony, tempo, and rhythms used. The types categorized by number and relationship of parts are analyzed and determined through the labeling of primary textural elements: primary melody, secondary melody, parallel supporting melody, static support, harmonic support, rhythmic support, and harmonic and rhythmic support.\nCommon types included monophonic texture (a single melodic voice, such as a piece for solo soprano or solo flute), biphonic texture (two melodic voices, such as a duo for bassoon and flute in which the bassoon plays a drone note and the flute plays the melody), polyphonic texture and homophonic texture (chords accompanying a melody).\nForm or structure.\nThe term musical form (or musical architecture) refers to the overall structure or plan of a piece of music, and it describes the layout of a composition as divided into sections. In the tenth edition of \"The Oxford Companion to Music\", Percy Scholes defines musical form as \"a series of strategies designed to find a successful mean between the opposite extremes of unrelieved repetition and unrelieved alteration.\" According to Richard Middleton, musical form is \"the shape or structure of the work\". He describes it through difference: the distance moved from a repeat; the latter being the smallest difference. Difference is quantitative and qualitative: \"how far\", and \"of what type\", different. In many cases, form depends on statement and restatement, unity and variety, and contrast and connection.\nExpression.\nMusical expression is the art of playing or singing music with emotional communication. The elements of music that comprise expression include dynamic indications, such as forte or piano, phrasing, differing qualities of timbre and articulation, color, intensity, energy and excitement. All of these devices can be incorporated by the performer. A performer aims to elicit responses of sympathetic feeling in the audience, and to excite, calm or otherwise sway the audience's physical and emotional responses. Musical expression is sometimes thought to be produced by a combination of other parameters, and sometimes described as a transcendent quality that is more than the sum of measurable quantities such as pitch or duration.\nExpression on instruments can be closely related to the role of the breath in singing, and the voice's natural ability to express feelings, sentiment and deep emotions. Whether these can somehow be categorized is perhaps the realm of academics, who view expression as an element of musical performance that embodies a consistently recognizable emotion, ideally causing a sympathetic emotional response in its listeners. The emotional content of musical expression is distinct from the emotional content of specific sounds (e.g., a startlingly-loud 'bang') and of learned associations (e.g., a national anthem), but can rarely be completely separated from its context.\nThe components of musical expression continue to be the subject of extensive and unresolved dispute.\nNotation.\nMusical notation is the written or symbolized representation of music. This is most often achieved by the use of commonly understood graphic symbols and written verbal instructions and their abbreviations. There are many systems of music notation from different cultures and different ages. Traditional Western notation evolved during the Middle Ages and remains an area of experimentation and innovation. In the 2000s, computer file formats have become important as well. Spoken language and hand signs are also used to symbolically represent music, primarily in teaching.\nIn standard Western music notation, tones are represented graphically by symbols (notes) placed on a staff or staves, the vertical axis corresponding to pitch and the horizontal axis corresponding to time. Note head shapes, stems, flags, ties and dots are used to indicate duration. Additional symbols indicate keys, dynamics, accents, rests, etc. Verbal instructions from the conductor are often used to indicate tempo, technique, and other aspects.\nIn Western music, a range of different music notation systems are used. In Western Classical music, conductors use printed scores that show all of the instruments' parts and orchestra members read parts with their musical lines written out. In popular styles of music, much less of the music may be notated. A rock band may go into a recording session with just a handwritten chord chart indicating the song's chord progression using chord names (e.g., C major, D minor, G7, etc.). All of the chord voicings, rhythms and accompaniment figures are improvised by the band members.\nAs academic discipline.\nThe scholarly study of music theory in the twentieth century has a number of different subfields, each of which takes a different perspective on what are the primary phenomenon of interest and the most useful methods for investigation.\nAnalysis.\nMusical analysis is the attempt to answer the question \"how does this music work?\" The method employed to answer this question, and indeed exactly what is meant by the question, differs from analyst to analyst, and according to the purpose of the analysis. According to Ian Bent, \"analysis, as a pursuit in its own right, came to be established only in the late 19th century; its emergence as an approach and method can be traced back to the 1750s. However, it existed as a scholarly tool, albeit an auxiliary one, from the Middle Ages onwards.\" Adolf Bernhard Marx was influential in formalising concepts about composition and music understanding towards the second half of the 19th century. The principle of analysis has been variously criticized, especially by composers, such as Edgard Var\u00e8se's claim that, \"to explain by means of [analysis] is to decompose, to mutilate the spirit of a work\".\nSchenkerian analysis is a method of musical analysis of tonal music based on the theories of Heinrich Schenker (1868\u20131935). The goal of a Schenkerian analysis is to interpret the underlying structure of a tonal work and to help reading the score according to that structure. The theory's basic tenets can be viewed as a way of defining tonality in music. A Schenkerian analysis of a passage of music shows hierarchical relationships among its pitches, and draws conclusions about the structure of the passage from this hierarchy. The analysis makes use of a specialized symbolic form of musical notation that Schenker devised to demonstrate various techniques of elaboration. The most fundamental concept of Schenker's theory of tonality may be that of \"tonal space\". The intervals between the notes of the tonic triad form a \"tonal space\" that is filled with passing and neighbour notes, producing new triads and new tonal spaces, open for further elaborations until the surface of the work (the score) is reached.\nAlthough Schenker himself usually presents his analyses in the generative direction, starting from the fundamental structure (\"Ursatz\") to reach the score, the practice of Schenkerian analysis more often is reductive, starting from the score and showing how it can be reduced to its fundamental structure. The graph of the \"Ursatz\" is arrhythmic, as is a strict-counterpoint cantus firmus exercise. Even at intermediate levels of the reduction, rhythmic notation (open and closed noteheads, beams and flags) shows not rhythm but the hierarchical relationships between the pitch-events. Schenkerian analysis is \"subjective\". There is no mechanical procedure involved and the analysis reflects the musical intuitions of the analyst. The analysis represents a way of hearing (and reading) a piece of music.\nTransformational theory is a branch of music theory developed by David Lewin in the 1980s, and formally introduced in his 1987 work, \"Generalized Musical Intervals and Transformations\". The theory, which models musical transformations as elements of a mathematical group, can be used to analyze both tonal and atonal music. The goal of transformational theory is to change the focus from musical objects\u2014such as the \"C major chord\" or \"G major chord\"\u2014to relations between objects. Thus, instead of saying that a C major chord is followed by G major, a transformational theorist might say that the first chord has been \"transformed\" into the second by the \"Dominant operation\". (Symbolically, one might write \"Dominant(C major) = G major.\") While traditional musical set theory focuses on the makeup of musical objects, transformational theory focuses on the intervals or types of musical motion that can occur. According to Lewin's description of this change in emphasis, \"[The transformational] attitude does not ask for some observed measure of extension between reified 'points'; rather it asks: 'If I am \"at\" s and wish to get to t, what characteristic \"gesture\" should I perform in order to arrive there?'\"\nMusic perception and cognition.\nMusic psychology or the psychology of music may be regarded as a branch of both psychology and musicology. It aims to explain and understand musical behavior and experience, including the processes through which music is perceived, created, responded to, and incorporated into everyday life. Modern music psychology is primarily empirical; its knowledge tends to advance on the basis of interpretations of data collected by systematic observation of and interaction with human participants. Music psychology is a field of research with practical relevance for many areas, including music performance, composition, education, criticism, and therapy, as well as investigations of human aptitude, skill, intelligence, creativity, and social behavior.\nMusic psychology can shed light on non-psychological aspects of musicology and musical practice. For example, it contributes to music theory through investigations of the perception and computational modelling of musical structures such as melody, harmony, tonality, rhythm, meter, and form. Research in music history can benefit from systematic study of the history of musical syntax, or from psychological analyses of composers and compositions in relation to perceptual, affective, and social responses to their music.\nGenre and technique.\nA music genre is a conventional category that identifies some pieces of music as belonging to a shared tradition or set of conventions. It is to be distinguished from \"musical form\" and \"musical style\", although in practice these terms are sometimes used interchangeably.\nMusic can be divided into different genres in many different ways. The artistic nature of music means that these classifications are often subjective and controversial, and some genres may overlap. There are even varying academic definitions of the term \"genre \"itself. In his book \"Form in Tonal Music\", Douglass M. Green distinguishes between genre and form. He lists madrigal, motet, canzona, ricercar, and dance as examples of genres from the Renaissance period. To further clarify the meaning of \"genre\", Green writes, \"Beethoven's Op. 61 and Mendelssohn's Op. 64 are identical in genre\u2014both are violin concertos\u2014but different in form. However, Mozart's Rondo for Piano, K. 511, and the \"Agnus Dei\" from his Mass, K. 317 are quite different in genre but happen to be similar in form.\" Some, like Peter van der Merwe, treat the terms \"genre\" and \"style\" as the same, saying that \"genre\" should be defined as pieces of music that came from the same style or \"basic musical language\".\nOthers, such as Allan F. Moore, state that \"genre\" and \"style\" are two separate terms, and that secondary characteristics such as subject matter can also differentiate between genres. A music genre or subgenre may also be defined by the musical techniques, the style, the cultural context, and the content and spirit of the themes. Geographical origin is sometimes used to identify a music genre, though a single geographical category will often include a wide variety of subgenres. Timothy Laurie argues that \"since the early 1980s, genre has graduated from being a subset of popular music studies to being an almost ubiquitous framework for constituting and evaluating musical research objects\".\nMusical technique is the ability of instrumental and vocal musicians to exert optimal control of their instruments or vocal cords to produce precise musical effects. Improving technique generally entails practicing exercises that improve muscular sensitivity and agility. To improve technique, musicians often practice fundamental patterns of notes such as the natural, minor, major, and chromatic scales, minor and major triads, dominant and diminished sevenths, formula patterns and arpeggios. For example, triads and sevenths teach how to play chords with accuracy and speed. Scales teach how to move quickly and gracefully from one note to another (usually by step). Arpeggios teach how to play broken chords over larger intervals. Many of these components of music are found in compositions, for example, a scale is a very common element of classical and romantic era compositions.\nHeinrich Schenker argued that musical technique's \"most striking and distinctive characteristic\" is repetition. Works known as \u00e9tudes (meaning \"study\") are also frequently used for the improvement of technique.\nMathematics.\nMusic theorists sometimes use mathematics to understand music, and although music has no axiomatic foundation in modern mathematics, mathematics is \"the basis of sound\" and sound itself \"in its musical aspects... exhibits a remarkable array of number properties\", simply because nature itself \"is amazingly mathematical\". The attempt to structure and communicate new ways of composing and hearing music has led to musical applications of set theory, abstract algebra and number theory. Some composers have incorporated the golden ratio and Fibonacci numbers into their work. There is a long history of examining the relationships between music and mathematics. Though ancient Chinese, Egyptians and Mesopotamians are known to have studied the mathematical principles of sound, the Pythagoreans (in particular Philolaus and Archytas) of ancient Greece were the first researchers known to have investigated the expression of musical scales in terms of numerical ratios.\nIn the modern era, musical set theory uses the language of mathematical set theory in an elementary way to organize musical objects and describe their relationships. To analyze the structure of a piece of (typically atonal) music using musical set theory, one usually starts with a set of tones, which could form motives or chords. By applying simple operations such as transposition and inversion, one can discover deep structures in the music. Operations such as transposition and inversion are called isometries because they preserve the intervals between tones in a set. Expanding on the methods of musical set theory, some theorists have used abstract algebra to analyze music. For example, the pitch classes in an equally tempered octave form an abelian group with 12 elements. It is possible to describe just intonation in terms of a free abelian group.\nSerial composition and set theory.\nIn music theory, serialism is a method or technique of composition that uses a series of values to manipulate different musical elements. Serialism began primarily with Arnold Schoenberg's twelve-tone technique, though his contemporaries were also working to establish serialism as one example of post-tonal thinking. Twelve-tone technique orders the twelve notes of the chromatic scale, forming a row or series and providing a unifying basis for a composition's melody, harmony, structural progressions, and variations. Other types of serialism also work with sets, collections of objects, but not necessarily with fixed-order series, and extend the technique to other musical dimensions (often called \"parameters\"), such as duration, dynamics, and timbre. The idea of serialism is also applied in various ways in the visual arts, design, and architecture\n\"Integral serialism\" or \"total serialism\" is the use of series for aspects such as duration, dynamics, and register as well as pitch. Other terms, used especially in Europe to distinguish post-World War II serial music from twelve-tone music and its American extensions, are \"general serialism\" and \"multiple serialism\".\nMusical set theory provides concepts for categorizing musical objects and describing their relationships. Many of the notions were first elaborated by Howard Hanson (1960) in connection with tonal music, and then mostly developed in connection with atonal music by theorists such as Allen Forte (1973), drawing on the work in twelve-tone theory of Milton Babbitt. The concepts of set theory are very general and can be applied to tonal and atonal styles in any equally tempered tuning system, and to some extent more generally than that.\nMusical set theory often assigns items in closed bracket sets using numbers. For example, in a chromatic scale set, each semitone is assigned a position in the following set: {0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11}. \u00a0Major chords are described using the {0 4 7} subset, while minor chords are described as {0 3 7}.\nOne branch of musical set theory deals with collections (sets and permutations) of pitches and pitch classes (pitch-class set theory), which may be ordered or unordered, and can be related by musical operations such as transposition, inversion, and complementation. The methods of musical set theory are sometimes applied to the analysis of rhythm as well.\nMusical semiotics.\nMusic semiology (semiotics) is the study of signs as they pertain to music on a variety of levels. Following Roman Jakobson, Kofi Agawu adopts the idea of musical semiosis being introversive or extroversive\u2014that is, musical signs within a text and without. \"Topics\", or various musical conventions (such as horn calls, dance forms, and styles), have been treated suggestively by Agawu, among others. The notion of gesture is beginning to play a large role in musico-semiotic enquiry.\n\"There are strong arguments that music inhabits a semiological realm which, on both ontogenetic and phylogenetic levels, has developmental priority over verbal language.\"\nWriters on music semiology include Kofi Agawu (on topical theory), Heinrich Schenker, Robert Hatten (on topic, gesture), Raymond Monelle (on topic, musical meaning), Jean-Jacques Nattiez (on introversive taxonomic analysis and ethnomusicological applications), Anthony Newcomb (on narrativity), and Eero Tarasti.\nRoland Barthes, himself a semiotician and skilled amateur pianist, wrote about music in \"Image Music Text\", \"The Responsibility of Forms\", and \"The Eiffel Tower\", though he did not consider music to be a semiotic system.\nSigns, meanings in music, happen essentially through the connotations of sounds, and through the social construction, appropriation and amplification of certain meanings associated with these connotations. The work of Philip Tagg (\"Ten Little Tunes\", \"Fernando the Flute\", \"Music's Meanings\") provides one of the most complete and systematic analysis of the relation between musical structures and connotations in western and especially popular, television and film music. The work of Leonard B. Meyer in \"Style and Music\" theorizes the relationship between ideologies and musical structures and the phenomena of style change, and focuses on romanticism as a case study.\nEducation and careers.\nMusic theory in the practical sense has been a part of education at conservatories and music schools for centuries, but the status music theory currently has within academic institutions is relatively recent. In the 1970s, few universities had dedicated music theory programs, many music theorists had been trained as composers or historians, and there was a belief among theorists that the teaching of music theory was inadequate and that the subject was not properly recognised as a scholarly discipline in its own right. A growing number of scholars began promoting the idea that music theory should be taught by theorists, rather than composers, performers or music historians. This led to the founding of the Society for Music Theory in the United States in 1977. In Europe, the French \"Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'Analyse musicale\" was founded in 1985. It called the First European Conference of Music Analysis for 1989, which resulted in the foundation of the \"Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 belge d'Analyse musicale\" in Belgium and the \"Gruppo analisi e teoria musicale\" in Italy the same year, the \"Society for Music Analysis\" in the UK in 1991, the \"Vereniging voor Muziektheorie\" in the Netherlands in 1999 and the \"Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Musiktheorie\" in Germany in 2000. They were later followed by the Russian Society for Music Theory in 2013, the Polish Society for Music Analysis in 2015 and the \"Sociedad de An\u00e1lisis y Teor\u00eda Musical\" in Spain in 2020, and others are in construction. These societies coordinate the publication of music theory scholarship and support the professional development of music theory researchers. They formed in 2018 a network of European societies for Theory and/or Analysis of Music, the https://\nAs part of their initial training, music theorists will typically complete a B.Mus or a B.A. in music (or a related field) and in many cases an M.A. in music theory. Some individuals apply directly from a bachelor's degree to a PhD, and in these cases, they may not receive an M.A. In the 2010s, given the increasingly interdisciplinary nature of university graduate programs, some applicants for music theory PhD programs may have academic training both in music and outside of music (e.g., a student may apply with a B.Mus. and a Masters in Music Composition or Philosophy of Music).\nMost music theorists work as instructors, lecturers or professors in colleges, universities or conservatories. The job market for tenure-track professor positions is very competitive: with an average of around 25 tenure-track positions advertised per year in the past decade, 80\u2013100 PhD graduates are produced each year (according to the Survey of Earned Doctorates) who compete not only with each other for those positions but with job seekers that received PhD's in previous years who are still searching for a tenure-track job. Applicants must hold a completed PhD or the equivalent degree (or expect to receive one within a year of being hired\u2014called an \"ABD\", for \"All But Dissertation\" stage) and (for more senior positions) have a strong record of publishing in peer-reviewed journals. Some PhD-holding music theorists are only able to find insecure positions as sessional lecturers. The job tasks of a music theorist are the same as those of a professor in any other humanities discipline: teaching undergraduate and/or graduate classes in this area of specialization and, in many cases some general courses (such as Music appreciation or Introduction to Music Theory), conducting research in this area of expertise, publishing research articles in peer-reviewed journals, authoring book chapters, books or textbooks, traveling to conferences to present papers and learn about research in the field, and, if the program includes a graduate school, supervising M.A. and PhD students and giving them guidance on the preparation of their theses and dissertations. Some music theory professors may take on senior administrative positions in their institution, such as Dean or Chair of the School of Music.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}

They are distinguished by their moniliform antennae and the soft-bodied, unpigmented worker caste for which they have been commonly termed \"white ants\"; however, they are not ants but highly derived cockroaches. About 2,997 extant species are currently described, 2,125 of which are members of the family Termitidae.\nTermites comprise the infraorder Isoptera, or alternatively the epifamily Termitoidae, within the order Blattodea (the cockroaches). Termites were once classified in a separate order from cockroaches, but recent phylogenetic studies indicate that they evolved from cockroaches, as they are deeply nested within the group, and the sister group to wood-eating cockroaches of the genus \"Cryptocercus\". Previous estimates suggested the divergence took place during the Jurassic or Triassic. More recent estimates suggest that they have an origin during the Late Jurassic, with the first fossil records in the Early Cretaceous.\nSimilarly to ants and some bees and wasps from the separate order Hymenoptera, most termites have an analogous \"worker\" and \"soldier\" caste system consisting of mostly sterile individuals which are physically and behaviorally distinct. Unlike ants, most colonies begin from sexually mature individuals known as the \"king\" and \"queen\" that together form a lifelong monogamous pair. Also unlike ants, which undergo a complete metamorphosis, termites undergo an incomplete metamorphosis that proceeds through egg, nymph, and adult stages. Termite colonies are commonly described as superorganisms due to the collective behaviors of the individuals which form a self-governing entity: the colony itself. Their colonies range in size from a few hundred individuals to enormous societies with several million individuals. Most species are rarely seen, having a cryptic life history where they remain hidden within the galleries and tunnels of their nests for most of their lives.\nTermites' success as a group has led to them colonizing almost every global landmass, with the highest diversity occurring in the tropics where they are estimated to constitute 10% of the animal biomass, particularly in Africa which has the richest diversity with more than 1000 described species. They are important decomposers of decaying plant matter in the subtropical and tropical regions of the world, and their recycling of wood and plant matter is of considerable ecological importance. Many species are ecosystem engineers capable of altering many soil properties such as hydrology, decomposition, nutrient cycling, vegetative growth, and consequently surrounding biodiversity through the large mounds constructed by certain species.\nTermites have several impacts on humans. They are a delicacy in the diet of some human cultures such as the Makiritare in the Alto Orinoco province of Venezuela, where they are commonly used as a spice. They are also used in traditional medicinal treatments of various diseases and ailments, such as influenza, asthma, bronchitis, etc. Termites are most famous for being structural pests; however, the vast majority of termite species are innocuous, with the regional numbers of economically significant species being: North America, 9; Australia, 16; Indian subcontinent, 26; tropical Africa, 24; Central America and the West Indies, 17. Of known pest species, 28 of the most invasive and structurally damaging belong to the genus \"Coptotermes\". The distribution of most known pest species is expected to increase over time as a consequence of climate change. Increased urbanization and connectivity is also predicted to expand the range of some pest termites.\nEtymology.\nThe infraorder name Isoptera is derived from the Greek words \"iso\" (equal) and \"ptera\" (winged), which refers to the nearly equal size of the fore and hind wings. \"Termite\" derives from the Latin and Late Latin word \"termes\" (\"woodworm, white ant\"), altered by the influence of Latin \"terere\" (\"to rub, wear, erode\") from the earlier word \"tarmes\". A termite nest is also known as a \"termitary\" or \"termitarium\" (plural \"termitaria\" or \"termitariums\"). The word was first used in English in 1781. Earlier attested designations were \"wood ants\" or \"white ants\", though these may never have been in wide use as termites do not exist in the British Isles.\nTaxonomy and evolutionary history.\nTermites were formerly placed in the order Isoptera. As early as 1925 suggestions were made that they were closely related to wood-eating cockroaches (genus \"Cryptocercus\", the woodroach) based on the similarity of their symbiotic gut flagellates. In the 1960s additional evidence supporting that hypothesis emerged when F.\u00a0A. McKittrick noted similar morphological characteristics between some termites and \"Cryptocercus\" nymphs. In 2008 DNA analysis from 16S rRNA sequences supported the position of termites being nested within the evolutionary tree containing the order Blattodea. The cockroach genus \"Cryptocercus\" shares the strongest phylogenetic relationship, and is considered to be the sister-group to termites. Termites and \"Cryptocercus\" share similar morphological and social features: for example, most cockroaches do not exhibit social characteristics, but \"Cryptocercus\" takes care of its young and exhibits other social behaviour such as trophallaxis and allogrooming. It had been proposed that the Isoptera and Cryptocercidae be grouped in the clade \"Xylophagodea\", but subsequent researchers have suggested a more conservative measure of retaining the termites as the Termitoidae, an epifamily within the cockroach order, which preserves the classification of termites at family level and below. Termites have long been accepted to be closely related to cockroaches and mantids, and they are classified in the same superorder (Dictyoptera).\nThe oldest unambiguous termite fossils date to the early Cretaceous, but given the diversity of Cretaceous termites and early fossil records showing mutualism between microorganisms and these insects, they possibly originated earlier in the Jurassic or Triassic. Possible evidence of a Jurassic origin is the assumption that the extinct mammaliaform \"Fruitafossor\" from Morrison Formation consumed termites, judging from its morphological similarity to modern termite-eating mammals. Morrison Formation also yields social insect nest fossils close to that of termites. The oldest termite nest discovered is believed to be from the Upper Cretaceous in West Texas, where the oldest known faecal pellets were also discovered. Claims that termites emerged earlier have faced controversy. For example, F. M. Weesner indicated that the Mastotermitidae termites may go back to the Late Permian, 251 million years ago, and fossil wings that have a close resemblance to the wings of \"Mastotermes\" of the Mastotermitidae, the most primitive living termite, have been discovered in the Permian layers in Kansas. It is even possible that the first termites emerged during the Carboniferous. The folded wings of the fossil wood roach \"Pycnoblattina\", arranged in a convex pattern between segments 1a\u00a0and 2a, resemble those seen in \"Mastotermes\", the only living insect with the same pattern. Kumar Krishna \"et al.\", though, consider that all of the Paleozoic and Triassic insects tentatively classified as termites are in fact unrelated to termites and should be excluded from the Isoptera. Other studies suggest that the origin of termites is more recent, having diverged from \"Cryptocercus\" sometime during the Early Cretaceous. The primitive giant northern termite (\"Mastotermes darwiniensis\") exhibits numerous basal characteristics similar to other cockroaches that are not shared with other termites, such as laying its eggs in rafts and having anal lobes on the wings. Termites are sometimes called \"white ants\", but the only resemblance to the ants is due to their sociality which is due to convergent evolution with termites being the first social insects to evolve a caste system more than 100 million years ago. Termite genomes are generally relatively large compared to those of other insects; the first fully sequenced termite genome, of \"Zootermopsis nevadensis\", which was published in the journal \"Nature Communications\", consists of roughly 500Mb, while two subsequently published genomes, \"Macrotermes natalensis\" and \"Cryptotermes secundus\", are considerably larger at around 1.3Gb.\nExternal phylogeny showing relationship of termites with other insect groups:\nInternal phylogeny showing relationship of extant termite families:\nThere are currently 3,173 living and fossil termite species recognised, classified in 12 families; reproductive and/or soldier castes are usually required for identification. The infraorder Isoptera is divided into the following clade and family groups, showing the subfamilies in their respective classification:\n Infraorder Isoptera \n Family \u2020Cratomastotermitidae \n Family Mastotermitidae \n Parvorder Euisoptera \n Family \u2020Melqartitermitidae \n Family \u2020Mylacrotermitidae \n Family \u2020Krishnatermitidae \n Family \u2020Termopsidae \n Family \u2020Carinatermitidae \n Minorder Teletisoptera \n Family Archotermopsidae \n Family Hodotermitidae \n Family Hodotermopsidae \n subfamily \u2020Hodotermopsellinae \n subfamily Hodotermopsinae \n Family \u2020Arceotermitidae \n subfamily \u2020Arceotermitinae \n subfamily \u2020Cosmotermitinae \n Family Stolotermitidae \n subfamily Stolotermitinae \n subfamily Porotermitinae \n Minorder Artisoptera \n Family \u2020Tanytermitidae \n Microrder Icoisoptera \n Family Kalotermitidae \n Nanorder Neoisoptera \n see below for families and subfamilies\nNeoisoptera.\nThe Neoisoptera, literally meaning \"newer termites\" (in an evolutionary sense), are a recently coined clade that include families such as the Heterotermitidae, Rhinotermitidae and Termitidae. \"Neoisopterans\" have a bifurcated caste development with true workers, and so notably lack pseudergates (except in Stylotermitidae: see below). All \"Neoisopterans\" have a fontanelle, which appears as a circular pore or series of pores in a depressed region within the middle of the head. The fontanelle connects to the frontal gland, a novel organ unique to Neoisopteran termites which evolved to excrete an array of defensive chemicals and secretions, and so is typically most developed in the soldier caste. Cellulose digestion in the family \"Termitidae\" has co-evolved with bacterial gut microbiota and many taxa have evolved additional symbiotic relationships such as with the fungus \"Termitomyces\"; in contrast, basal \"Neoisopterans\" and all other \"Euisoptera\" have flagellates and prokaryotes in their hindguts. Extant families and subfamilies are organized as follows:\n Early-Diverging Neoisoptera (Non-Geoisoptera)\n Family \u2020Archeorhinotermitidae \n Family Stylotermitidae \n Family Serritermitidae \n Family Rhinotermitidae \n Family Termitogetonidae \n Family Psammotermitidae \n Subfamily Prorhinotermitinae \n Subfamily Psammotermitinae \n Clade Geoisoptera \n Family Heterotermitidae ()\n Family Termitidae \n Subfamily Sphaerotermitinae \n Subfamily Macrotermitinae \n Subfamily Foraminitermitinae \n Subfamily Apicotermitinae \n Subfamily Microcerotermitinae \n Subfamily Syntermitinae \n Subfamily Forficulitermitinae \n Subfamily Engelitermitinae \n Subfamily Crepititermitinae \n Subfamily Protohamitermitinae \n Subfamily Cylindrotermitinae \n Subfamily Neocapritermitinae \n Subfamily Nasutitermitinae \n Subfamily Promirotermitinae \n Subfamily Mirocapritermitinae \n Subfamily Amitermitinae \n Subfamily Cubitermitinae \n Subfamily Termitinae \nDistribution and diversity.\nTermites are found on all continents except Antarctica. The diversity of termite species is low in North America and Europe (10 species known in Europe and 50 in North America), but is high in South America, where over 400 species are known. Of the 2,972 extant termite species currently classified, 1,000 are found in Africa, where mounds are extremely abundant in certain regions. Approximately 1.1\u00a0million active termite mounds can be found in the northern Kruger National Park alone. In Asia, there are 435 species of termites, which are mainly distributed in China. Within China, termite species are restricted to mild tropical and subtropical habitats south of the Yangtze River. In Australia, all ecological groups of termites (dampwood, drywood, subterranean) are endemic to the country, with over 360 classified species. Because termites are highly social and abundant, they represent a disproportionate amount of the world's insect biomass. Termites and ants comprise about 1% of insect species, but represent more than 50% of insect biomass.\nDue to their soft cuticles, termites do not inhabit cool or cold habitats. There are three ecological groups of termites: dampwood, drywood and subterranean. Dampwood termites are found only in coniferous forests, and drywood termites are found in hardwood forests; subterranean termites live in widely diverse areas. One species in the drywood group is the West Indian drywood termite \"(Cryptotermes brevis)\", which is an invasive species in Australia.\nDescription.\nTermites are usually small, measuring between in length. The largest of all extant termites are the queens of the species \"Macrotermes bellicosus\", measuring up to over in length. Another giant termite, the extinct \"Gyatermes styriensis\", flourished in Austria during the Miocene and had a wingspan of and a body length of .\nMost worker and soldier termites are completely blind as they do not have a pair of eyes. However, some species, such as \"Hodotermes mossambicus\", have compound eyes which they use for orientation and to distinguish sunlight from moonlight. The alates (winged males and females) have eyes along with lateral ocelli. Lateral ocelli, however, are not found in all termites, absent in the families Hodotermitidae, Termopsidae, and Archotermopsidae. Like other insects, termites have a small tongue-shaped labrum and a clypeus; the clypeus is divided into a postclypeus and anteclypeus. Termite antennae have a number of functions such as the sensing of touch, taste, odours (including pheromones), heat and vibration. The three basic segments of a termite antenna include a scape, a pedicel (typically shorter than the scape), and the flagellum (all segments beyond the scape and pedicel). The mouth parts contain a maxillae, a labium, and a set of mandibles. The maxillae and labium have palps that help termites sense food and handling. The cuticle of most castes is soft and flexible due to a resulting lack of sclerotization, particularly of the abdomen which often appears translucent. Pigmentation and sclerotization of the cuticle correlates with life history, with species that spend more time in the surface in the open tending to have a more sclerotized and pigmented exoskeleton.\nConsistent with all insects, the anatomy of the termite thorax consists of three segments: the prothorax, the mesothorax and the metathorax. Each segment contains a pair of legs. On alates, the wings are located at the mesothorax and metathorax, which is consistent with all four-winged insects. The mesothorax and metathorax have well-developed exoskeletal plates; the prothorax has smaller plates.\nTermites have a ten-segmented abdomen with two plates, the tergites and the sternites. The tenth abdominal segment has a pair of short cerci. There are ten tergites, of which nine are wide and one is elongated. The reproductive organs are similar to those in cockroaches but are more simplified. For example, the intromittent organ is not present in male alates, and the sperm is either immotile or aflagellate. However, Mastotermitidae termites have multiflagellate sperm with limited motility. The genitals in females are also simplified. Unlike in other termites, Mastotermitidae females have an ovipositor, a feature strikingly similar to that in female cockroaches.\nThe non-reproductive castes of termites are wingless and rely exclusively on their six legs for locomotion. The alates fly only for a brief amount of time, so they also rely on their legs. The appearance of the legs is similar in each caste, but the soldiers have larger and heavier legs. The structure of the legs is consistent with other insects: the parts of a leg include a coxa, trochanter, femur, tibia and the tarsus. The number of tibial spurs on an individual's leg varies. Some species of termite have an arolium, located between the claws, which is present in species that climb on smooth surfaces but is absent in most termites.\nUnlike in ants, the hind-wings and fore-wings are of equal length. Most of the time, the alates are poor flyers; their technique is to launch themselves in the air and fly in a random direction. Studies show that in comparison to larger termites, smaller termites cannot fly long distances. When a termite is in flight, its wings remain at a right angle, and when the termite is at rest, its wings remain parallel to the body.\nCaste system.\nDue to termites being hemimetabolous insects, where the young go through multiple and gradual adultoid molts before maturing, the advent of eusociality has significantly altered the developmental patterns of this group of insects of which, although similar, is not homologous to that of the eusocial Hymenoptera. Unlike ants, bees, and wasps which undergo a complete metamorphosis and as a result only exhibit developmental plasticity at the larval stage, the mobile adultoid instars of termites remain developmentally flexible throughout all life stages up to the final molt, which has uniquely allowed for the evolution of distinct yet flexible castes amongst the immatures. As a result the caste system of termites consists mostly of neotenous or juvenile individuals that undertake the most labor in the colony, which is in contrast to the eusocial Hymenoptera where work is strictly undertaken by the adults.\nThe developmental plasticity in termites can be described similarly to cell potency, where each molt offers a varying level of phenotypic potency. Early instars typically exhibit the highest phenotypic potency and can be described as totipotent, able to molt into all alternative phenotypes. Following instars can be pluripotent, being able to molt into reproductives and non-reproductives but cannot molt into at least one phenotype. Multipotent instars are able to molt into either reproductive or non-reproductive phenotypes. Unipotent instars are able to molt into developmentally close phenotypes, and then the final instar is committed, being no longer able to change phenotype and so are functionally an adult. In most termites, phenotypic potency decreases with every successive molt. Notable exceptions are basal taxa such as the Archotermopsidae, which are able to retain high developmental plasticity even up to the late instars. In these basal taxa, the immatures are able to go through \"progressive\" (\"nymph-to-imago\"), \"regressive\" (\"winged-to-wingless\") and \"stationary\" (\"size increase, remains wingless\") molts, which typically indicates the developmental trajectory an individual follows.\nThere is significant variation of the developmental patterns in termites even across closely related taxa, but can typically be generalized into the following two patterns: The first is the \"linear developmental pathway\", where all immatures are capable of developing into winged adults (\"Alates\"), exhibit high phenotypic potency, and where there exists no true sterile caste other than the soldier. The second is the \"bifurcated developmental pathway\", where immatures diverge into two distinct developmental lineages known as the \"nymphal\" (winged) and \"apterous\" (wingless) lines. The bifurcation occurs early, either at the egg or the first two instars, and represents an irreversible and committed development to either the reproductive or non-reproductive lifestyles. As such, the apterous lineage consists mostly of wingless and truly altruistic sterile individuals (true workers, soldiers), whereas the nymphal lineage consists mainly of fertile individuals destined to become winged reproductives. The bifurcated developmental pathway is found mainly in the derived taxa (i.e. Neoisoptera), and is believed to have evolved in tandem with the sterile worker caste as species moved to foraging for food beyond their nests, as opposed to the nest also being the food (such as in obligate wood-dwellers).\nThere are three main castes which are discussed below:\n\"Worker\" termites undertake the most labor within the colony, being responsible for foraging, food storage, and brood and nest maintenance. Workers are tasked with the digestion of cellulose in food and are thus the most likely caste to be found in infested wood. The process of worker termites feeding other nestmates is known as trophallaxis. Trophallaxis is an effective nutritional tactic to convert and recycle nitrogenous components. It frees the parents from feeding all but the first generation of offspring, allowing for the group to grow much larger and ensuring that the necessary gut symbionts are transferred from one generation to another. Workers are believed to have evolved from older wingless immatures (\"Larvae\") that evolved cooperative behaviors; and indeed in some basal taxa the late instar larvae are known to undertake the role of workers without differentiating as a true separate caste. Workers can either be male or female, although in some species with polymorphic workers either sex may be restricted to a certain developmental path. Workers may also be fertile or sterile, however the term \"worker\" is normally reserved for the latter, having evolved in taxa that exhibit a bifurcated developmental pathway. As a result, sterile workers like in the family Termitidae are termed \"true workers\" and are the most derived, while those that are undifferentiated and fertile as in the wood-nesting Archotermopsidae are termed \"pseudergates\", which are the most basal. \"True workers\" are individuals which irreversibly develop from the \"apterous lineage and\" have completely forgone development into a winged adult. They display altruistic behaviors and either have terminal molts or exhibit a low level of phenotypical potency. True workers across different termite taxa (\"Mastotermitidae\", \"Hodotermitidae\", \"Rhinotermitidae\" &amp; \"Termitidae)\" can widely vary in the level of developmental plasticity even between closely related taxa, with many species having true workers that can molt into the other apterous castes such as \"ergatoids\" (worker reproductive; apterous neotenics), soldiers, or the other worker castes. \"Pseudergates sensu stricto\" are individuals which arise from the linear developmental pathway that have regressively molted and lost their wing buds, and are regarded as totipotent immatures. They are capable of performing work but are overall less involved in labor and considered more cooperative than truly altruistic. \"Pseudergates sensu lato\", otherwise known as \"false workers\", are most represented in basal lineages (\"Kalotermitidae\", \"Archotermopsidae\", \"Hodotermopsidae\", \"Serritermitidae\") and closely resemble true workers in which they also perform most of the work and are similarly altruistic, however differ in developing from the linear developmental pathway where they exist in a stationary molt; i.e they have halted development before the growth of wing buds, and are regarded as pluripotent immatures.\nThe \"soldier\" caste is the most anatomically and behaviorally specialized, and their sole purpose is to defend the colony. Many soldiers have large heads with highly modified powerful jaws so enlarged that they cannot feed themselves. Instead, like juveniles, they are fed by workers. Fontanelles, simple holes in the forehead that lead to a gland which exudes defensive secretions, are a feature of the clade Neoisoptera and are present in all extant taxa such as Rhinotermitidae. The majority of termite species have mandibulate soldiers which are easily identified by the disproportionately large sclerotized head and mandibles. Among certain termites, the soldier caste has evolved globular (phragmotic) heads to block their narrow tunnels such as seen in Cryptotermes. Amongst mandibulate soldiers, the mandibles have been adapted for a variety of defensive strategies: Biting/crushing (\"Incisitermes\"), slashing (\"Cubitermes\"), slashing/snapping (\"Dentispicotermes\"), symmetrical snapping (\"Termes\"), asymmetrical snapping (\"Neocapritermes\"), and piercing (\"Armitermes\"). In the more derived termite taxa, the soldier caste can be polymorphic and include minor and major forms. Other morphologically specialized soldiers includes the Nasutes, which have a horn-like nozzle projection (nasus) on the head. These unique soldiers are able to spray noxious, sticky secretions containing diterpenes at their enemies. Nitrogen fixation plays an important role in Nasute nutrition. Soldiers are normally a committed sterile caste and so do not molt into anything else, but in certain basal taxa like the Archotermopsidae they are known to rarely molt into neotenic forms that develop functional sexual organs. In species with the linear developmental pathway, soldiers develop from apterous immatures and constitute the only true sterile caste in these taxa.\nThe primary reproductive caste of a colony consists of the fertile adult (\"imago\") female and male individuals, colloquially known as the queen and king. The queen of the colony is responsible for egg production of the colony. Unlike in ants, the male and female reproductives form lifelong pairs where the king will continue to mate with the queen throughout their lives. In some species, the abdomen of the queen swells up dramatically to increase fecundity, a characteristic known as physogastrism. Depending on the species, the queen starts producing reproductive alates at a certain time of the year, and huge swarms emerge from the colony when nuptial flight begins. These swarms attract a wide variety of predators. The queens can be particularly long-lived for insects, with some reportedly living as long as 30 or 50 years. In both the linear and bifurcated developmental pathways, the primary reproductives only develop from winged immatures (nymphs). These winged immatures are capable of regressively molting into a form known as \"brachypterous neotenics\" (\"nymphoids\"), which retain juvenile and adult characteristics. \"BN\"'s can be found in both the derived and basal termite taxa, and generally serve as supplementary reproductives.\nLife cycle.\nTermites are often compared with the social Hymenoptera (ants and various species of bees and wasps), but their differing evolutionary origins result in major differences in life cycle. In the eusocial Hymenoptera, the workers are exclusively female. Males (drones) are haploid and develop from unfertilised eggs, while females (both workers and the queen) are diploid and develop from fertilised eggs. In contrast, worker termites, which constitute the majority in a colony, are diploid individuals of both sexes and develop from fertilised eggs. Depending on species, male and female workers may have different roles in a termite colony.\nThe life cycle of a termite begins with an egg, but is different from that of a bee or ant in that it goes through a developmental process called incomplete metamorphosis, going through multiple gradual pre-adult molts that are highly developmentally plastic before becoming an adult. Unlike in other hemimetabolous insects, \"nymphs\" are more strictly defined in termites as immature young with visible wing buds, which often invariably go through a series of moults to become winged adults. \"Larvae\", which are defined as early nymph instars with absent wing buds, exhibit the highest developmental potentiality and are able to molt into \"Alates\", \"Soldiers\", \"Neotenics\", or \"Workers\". Workers are believed to have evolved from larvae, sharing many similarities to the extent that workers can be regarded as \"larval\", in that both lack wings, eyes, and functional reproductive organs while maintaining varying levels of developmental flexibility, although usually to a much lesser extent in workers. The main distinction being that while larvae are wholly dependent on other nestmates to survive, workers are independent and are able to feed themselves and contribute to the colony. Workers remain wingless and across many taxa become developmentally arrested, appearing to not change into any other caste until death. In some basal taxa, there is no distinction, with the \"workers\" (pseudergates) essentially being late instar larvae that retain the ability to change into all other castes.\nThe development of larvae into adults can take months; the time period depends on food availability and nutrition, temperature, and the size of the colony. Since larvae and nymphs are unable to feed themselves, workers must feed them, but workers also take part in the social life of the colony and have certain other tasks to accomplish such as foraging, building or maintaining the nest or tending to the queen. Pheromones regulate the caste system in termite colonies, preventing all but a very few of the termites from becoming fertile queens.\nQueens of the eusocial termite \"Reticulitermes speratus\" are capable of a long lifespan without sacrificing fecundity. These long-lived queens have a significantly lower level of oxidative damage, including oxidative DNA damage, than workers, soldiers and nymphs. The lower levels of damage appear to be due to increased catalase, an enzyme that protects against oxidative stress.\nReproduction.\nTermite alates (winged virgin queens and kings) only leave the colony when a nuptial flight takes place. Alate males and females pair up together and then land in search of a suitable place for a colony. A termite king and queen do not mate until they find such a spot. When they do, they excavate a chamber big enough for both, close up the entrance and proceed to mate. After mating, the pair may never surface again, spending the rest of their lives in the nest. Nuptial flight time varies in each species. For example, alates in certain species emerge during the day in summer while others emerge during the winter. The nuptial flight may also begin at dusk, when the alates swarm around areas with many lights. The time when nuptial flight begins depends on the environmental conditions, the time of day, moisture, wind speed and precipitation. The number of termites in a colony also varies, with the larger species typically having 100\u20131,000 individuals. However, some termite colonies, including those with many individuals, can number in the millions.\nThe queen only lays 10\u201320 eggs in the very early stages of the colony, but lays as many as 1,000 a day when the colony is several years old. At maturity, a primary queen has a great capacity to lay eggs. In some species, the mature queen has a greatly distended abdomen and may produce 40,000 eggs a day. The two mature ovaries may have some 2,000 ovarioles each. The abdomen increases the queen's body length to several times more than before mating and reduces her ability to move freely; attendant workers provide assistance.\nThe king grows only slightly larger after initial mating and continues to mate with the queen for life (a termite queen can live between 30\u00a0and 50\u00a0years); this is very different from ant colonies, in which a queen mates once with the males and stores the gametes for life, as the male ants die shortly after mating. If a queen is absent, a termite king produces pheromones which encourage the development of replacement termite queens. As the queen and king are monogamous, sperm competition does not occur.\nTermites going through incomplete metamorphosis on the path to becoming alates form a subcaste in certain species of termite, functioning as potential supplementary reproductives. These supplementary reproductives only mature into primary reproductives upon the death of a king or queen, or when the primary reproductives are separated from the colony. Supplementaries have the ability to replace a dead primary reproductive, and there may also be more than a single supplementary within a colony. Some queens have the ability to switch from sexual reproduction to asexual reproduction. Studies show that while termite queens mate with the king to produce colony workers, the queens reproduce their replacements (neotenic queens) parthenogenetically.\nThe neotropical termite \"Embiratermes neotenicus\" and several other related species produce colonies that contain a primary king accompanied by a primary queen or by up to 200 neotenic queens that had originated through thelytokous parthenogenesis of a founding primary queen. The form of parthenogenesis likely employed maintains heterozygosity in the passage of the genome from mother to daughter, thus avoiding inbreeding depression.\nBehaviour and ecology.\nDiet.\nTermites are primarily detritivores, consuming dead plants at any level of decomposition. They also play a vital role in the ecosystem by recycling waste material such as dead wood, faeces and plants. Many species eat cellulose, having a specialised midgut that breaks down the fibre. Termites are considered to be a major source (11%) of atmospheric methane, one of the prime greenhouse gases, produced from the breakdown of cellulose. Termites rely primarily upon a symbiotic microbial community that includes bacteria and flagellate protists, such as metamonads and hypermastigids. This community provides the enzymes that digests the cellulose, allowing the insects to absorb the end products for their own use. \nThe microbial ecosystem present in the termite gut contains many species found nowhere else on Earth. Termites hatch without these symbionts present in their guts, and develop them after being fed a culture from other termites. Gut protozoa, such as \"Trichonympha\", in turn, rely on symbiotic bacteria embedded on their surfaces to produce some of the necessary digestive enzymes. Most higher termites, especially in the family Termitidae, can produce their own cellulase enzymes, but they rely primarily upon the bacteria. The flagellates have been lost in Termitidae. Researchers have found species of spirochetes living in termite guts capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen to a form usable by the insect. Scientists' understanding of the relationship between the termite digestive tract and the microbial endosymbionts is still rudimentary; what is true in all termite species, however, is that the workers feed the other members of the colony with substances derived from the digestion of plant material, either from the mouth or anus. Judging from closely related bacterial species, it is strongly presumed that the termites' and cockroach's gut microbiota derives from their dictyopteran ancestors. Despite primarily consuming decaying plant material as a group, many termite species have been observed to opportunistically feed on dead animals to supplement their dietary needs. Termites are also known to harbor bacteriophages in their gut. Some of these bacteriophages likely infect the symbiotic bacteria which play a key role in termite biology. The exact role and function of bacteriophages in the termite gut microbiome is not clearly understood. Termite gut bacteriophages also show similarity to bacteriophages (CrAssphage) found in the human gut. \nCertain species such as \"Gnathamitermes tubiformans\" have seasonal food habits. For example, they may preferentially consume Red three-awn (\"Aristida longiseta\") during the summer, Buffalograss (\"Buchloe dactyloides\") from May to August, and blue grama \"Bouteloua gracilis\" during spring, summer and autumn. Colonies of \"G.\u00a0tubiformans\" consume less food in spring than they do during autumn when their feeding activity is high.\nVarious woods differ in their susceptibility to termite attack; the differences are attributed to such factors as moisture content, hardness, and resin and lignin content. In one study, the drywood termite \"Cryptotermes brevis\" strongly preferred poplar and maple woods to other woods that were generally rejected by the termite colony. These preferences may in part have represented conditioned or learned behaviour.\nSome species of termite practice fungiculture. They maintain a \"garden\" of specialised fungi of genus \"Termitomyces\", which are nourished by the excrement of the insects. When the fungi are eaten, their spores pass undamaged through the intestines of the termites to complete the cycle by germinating in the fresh faecal pellets. Molecular evidence suggests that the family Macrotermitinae developed agriculture about 31 million years ago. It is assumed that more than 90 per cent of dry wood in the semiarid savannah ecosystems of Africa and Asia are reprocessed by these termites. Originally living in the rainforest, fungus farming allowed them to colonise the African savannah and other new environments, eventually expanding into Asia.\nDepending on their feeding habits, termites are placed into two groups: the lower termites and higher termites. The lower termites predominately feed on wood. As wood is difficult to digest, termites prefer to consume fungus-infected wood because it is easier to digest and the fungi are high in protein. Meanwhile, the higher termites consume a wide variety of materials, including faeces, humus, grass, leaves and roots. The gut of the lower termites contains many species of bacteria along with protozoa and \"Holomastigotoides\", while the higher termites only have a few species of bacteria with no protozoa.\nPredators.\nTermites are consumed by a wide variety of predators. One termite species alone, \"Hodotermes mossambicus\", was reported (1990) in the stomach contents of 65 birds and 19 mammals. Arthropods such as ants, centipedes, cockroaches, crickets, dragonflies, scorpions and spiders, reptiles such as lizards, and amphibians such as frogs and toads consume termites, with two spiders in the family Ammoxenidae being specialist termite predators. Other predators include aardvarks, aardwolves, anteaters, bats, bears, bilbies, many birds, echidnas, foxes, galagos, numbats, mice and pangolins. The aardwolf is an insectivorous mammal that primarily feeds on termites; it locates its food by sound and also by detecting the scent secreted by the soldiers; a single aardwolf is capable of consuming thousands of termites in a single night by using its long, sticky tongue. Sloth bears break open mounds to consume the nestmates, while chimpanzees have developed tools to \"fish\" termites from their nest. Wear pattern analysis of bone tools used by the early hominin \"Paranthropus robustus\" suggests that they used these tools to dig into termite mounds.\nAmong all predators, ants are the greatest enemy to termites. Some ant genera are specialist predators of termites. For example, \"Megaponera\" is a strictly termite-eating (termitophagous) genus that perform raiding activities, some lasting several hours. \"Paltothyreus tarsatus\" is another termite-raiding species, with each individual stacking as many termites as possible in its mandibles before returning home, all the while recruiting additional nestmates to the raiding site through chemical trails. The Malaysian basicerotine ants \"Eurhopalothrix heliscata\" uses a different strategy of termite hunting by pressing themselves into tight spaces, as they hunt through rotting wood housing termite colonies. Once inside, the ants seize their prey by using their short but sharp mandibles. \"Tetramorium uelense\" is a specialised predator species that feeds on small termites. A scout recruits 10\u201330 workers to an area where termites are present, killing them by immobilising them with their stinger. \"Centromyrmex\" and \"Iridomyrmex\" colonies sometimes nest in termite mounds, and so the termites are preyed on by these ants. No evidence for any kind of relationship (other than a predatory one) is known. Other ants, including \"Acanthostichus\", \"Camponotus\", \"Crematogaster\", \"Cylindromyrmex\", \"Leptogenys\", \"Odontomachus\", \"Ophthalmopone\", \"Pachycondyla\", \"Rhytidoponera\", \"Solenopsis\" and \"Wasmannia\", also prey on termites. Specialized subterranean species of army ants such as ones in the genus \"Dorylus\" are known to commonly predate on young \"Macrotermes\" colonies.\nAnts are not the only invertebrates that perform raids. Many sphecoid wasps and several species including \"Polybia\" and \"Angiopolybia\" are known to raid termite mounds during the termites' nuptial flight.\nParasites, pathogens, and viruses.\nTermites are less likely to be attacked by parasites than bees, wasps and ants, as they are usually well protected in their mounds. Nevertheless, termites are infected by a variety of parasites. Some of these include dipteran flies, \"Pyemotes\" mites, and a large number of nematode parasites. Most nematode parasites are in the order Rhabditida; others are in the genus \"Mermis\", \"Diplogaster aerivora\" and \"Harteria gallinarum\". Under imminent threat of an attack by parasites, a colony may migrate to a new location. Certain fungal pathogens such as \"Aspergillus nomius\" and \"Metarhizium anisopliae\" are, however, major threats to a termite colony as they are not host-specific and may infect large portions of the colony; transmission usually occurs via direct physical contact. \"M.\u00a0anisopliae\" is known to weaken the termite immune system. Infection with \"A.\u00a0nomius\" only occurs when a colony is under great stress. Over 34 fungal species are known to live as parasites on the exoskeleton of termites, with many being host-specific and only causing indirect harm to their host.\nTermites are infected by viruses including Entomopoxvirinae and the Nuclear Polyhedrosis Virus.\nLocomotion and foraging.\nBecause the worker and soldier castes lack wings and thus never fly, and the reproductives use their wings for just a brief amount of time, termites predominantly rely upon their legs to move about.\nForaging behaviour depends on the type of termite. For example, certain species feed on the wood structures they inhabit, and others harvest food that is near the nest. Most workers are rarely found out in the open, and do not forage unprotected; they rely on sheeting and runways to protect them from predators. Subterranean termites construct tunnels and galleries to look for food, and workers who manage to find food sources recruit additional nestmates by depositing a phagostimulant pheromone that attracts workers. Foraging workers use semiochemicals to communicate with each other, and workers who begin to forage outside of their nest release trail pheromones from their sternal glands. In one species, \"Nasutitermes costalis\", there are three phases in a foraging expedition: first, soldiers scout an area. When they find a food source, they communicate to other soldiers and a small force of workers starts to emerge. In the second phase, workers appear in large numbers at the site. The third phase is marked by a decrease in the number of soldiers present and an increase in the number of workers. Isolated termite workers may engage in L\u00e9vy flight behaviour as an optimised strategy for finding their nestmates or foraging for food.\nCompetition.\nCompetition between two colonies always results in agonistic behaviour towards each other, resulting in fights. These fights can cause mortality on both sides and, in some cases, the gain or loss of territory. \"Cemetery pits\" may be present, where the bodies of dead termites are buried.\nStudies show that when termites encounter each other in foraging areas, some of the termites deliberately block passages to prevent other termites from entering. Dead termites from other colonies found in exploratory tunnels leads to the isolation of the area and thus the need to construct new tunnels. Conflict between two competitors does not always occur. For example, though they might block each other's passages, colonies of \"Macrotermes bellicosus\" and \"Macrotermes subhyalinus\" are not always aggressive towards each other. Suicide cramming is known in \"Coptotermes formosanus\". Since \"C.\u00a0formosanus\" colonies may get into physical conflict, some termites squeeze tightly into foraging tunnels and die, successfully blocking the tunnel and ending all agonistic activities.\nAmong the reproductive caste, neotenic queens may compete with each other to become the dominant queen when there are no primary reproductives. This struggle among the queens leads to the elimination of all but a single queen, which, with the king, takes over the colony.\nAnts and termites may compete with each other for nesting space. In particular, ants that prey on termites usually have a negative impact on arboreal nesting species.\nCommunication.\nMost termites are blind, so communication primarily occurs through chemical, mechanical and pheromonal cues. These methods of communication are used in a variety of activities, including foraging, locating reproductives, construction of nests, recognition of nestmates, nuptial flight, locating and fighting enemies, and defending the nests. The most common way of communicating is through antennation. A number of pheromones are known, including contact pheromones (which are transmitted when workers are engaged in trophallaxis or grooming) and alarm, trail and sex pheromones. The alarm pheromone and other defensive chemicals are secreted from the frontal gland. Trail pheromones are secreted from the sternal gland, and sex pheromones derive from two glandular sources: the sternal and tergal glands. When termites go out to look for food, they forage in columns along the ground through vegetation. A trail can be identified by the faecal deposits or runways that are covered by objects. Workers leave pheromones on these trails, which are detected by other nestmates through olfactory receptors. Termites can also communicate through mechanical cues, vibrations, and physical contact. These signals are frequently used for alarm communication or for evaluating a food source.\nWhen termites construct their nests, they use predominantly indirect communication. No single termite would be in charge of any particular construction project. Individual termites react rather than think, but at a group level, they exhibit a sort of collective cognition. Specific structures or other objects such as pellets of soil or pillars cause termites to start building. The termite adds these objects onto existing structures, and such behaviour encourages building behaviour in other workers. The result is a self-organised process whereby the information that directs termite activity results from changes in the environment rather than from direct contact among individuals.\nTermites can distinguish nestmates and non-nestmates through chemical communication and gut symbionts: chemicals consisting of hydrocarbons released from the cuticle allow the recognition of alien termite species. Each colony has its own distinct odour. This odour is a result of genetic and environmental factors such as the termites' diet and the composition of the bacteria within the termites' intestines.\nDefence.\nTermites rely on alarm communication to defend a colony. Alarm pheromones can be released when the nest has been breached or is being attacked by enemies or potential pathogens. Termites always avoid nestmates infected with \"Metarhizium anisopliae\" spores, through vibrational signals released by infected nestmates. Other methods of defence include headbanging and secretion of fluids from the frontal gland and defecating faeces containing alarm pheromones.\nIn some species, some soldiers block tunnels to prevent their enemies from entering the nest, and they may deliberately rupture themselves as an act of defence. In cases where the intrusion is coming from a breach that is larger than the soldier's head, soldiers form a phalanx-like formation around the breach and bite at intruders. If an invasion carried out by \"Megaponera analis\" is successful, an entire colony may be destroyed, although this scenario is rare.\nTo termites, any breach of their tunnels or nests is a cause for alarm. When termites detect a potential breach, the soldiers usually bang their heads, apparently to attract other soldiers for defence and to recruit additional workers to repair any breach. Additionally, an alarmed termite bumps into other termites which causes them to be alarmed and to leave pheromone trails to the disturbed area, which is also a way to recruit extra workers.\nThe pantropical subfamily Nasutitermitinae has a specialised caste of soldiers, known as nasutes, that have the ability to exude noxious liquids through a horn-like frontal projection that they use for defence. Nasutes have lost their mandibles through the course of evolution and must be fed by workers. A wide variety of monoterpene hydrocarbon solvents have been identified in the liquids that nasutes secrete. Similarly, Formosan subterranean termites have been known to secrete naphthalene to protect their nests.\nSoldiers of the species \"Globitermes sulphureus\" commit suicide by autothysis\u00a0\u2013 rupturing a large gland just beneath the surface of their cuticles. The thick, yellow fluid in the gland becomes very sticky on contact with the air, entangling ants or other insects that are trying to invade the nest. Another termite, \"Neocapriterme taracua\", also engages in suicidal defence. Workers physically unable to use their mandibles while in a fight form a pouch full of chemicals, then deliberately rupture themselves, releasing toxic chemicals that paralyse and kill their enemies. The soldiers of the neotropical termite family Serritermitidae have a defence strategy which involves front gland autothysis, with the body rupturing between the head and abdomen. When soldiers guarding nest entrances are attacked by intruders, they engage in autothysis, creating a block that denies entry to any attacker.\nWorkers use several different strategies to deal with their dead, including burying, cannibalism, and avoiding a corpse altogether. To avoid pathogens, termites occasionally engage in necrophoresis, in which a nestmate carries away a corpse from the colony to dispose of it elsewhere. Which strategy is used depends on the nature of the corpse a worker is dealing with (i.e. the age of the carcass).\nRelationship with other organisms.\nA species of fungus is known to mimic termite eggs, successfully avoiding its natural predators. These small brown balls, known as \"termite balls\", rarely kill the eggs, and in some cases the workers tend to them. This fungus mimics these eggs by producing cellulose-digesting enzymes known as glucosidases. A unique mimicking behaviour exists between various species of \"Trichopsenius\" beetles and certain termite species within \"Reticulitermes\". The beetles share the same cuticle hydrocarbons as the termites and even biosynthesize them. This chemical mimicry allows the beetles to integrate themselves within the termite colonies. The developed appendages on the physogastric abdomen of \"Austrospirachtha mimetes\" allows the beetle to mimic a termite worker.\nSome ant species are known to capture termites to use as a fresh food source later on, rather than killing them. For example, \"Formica nigra\" captures termites, and those that try to escape are immediately seized and driven underground. Certain species of ants in the subfamily Ponerinae conduct these raids although other ant species go in alone to steal the eggs or nymphs. Ants such as \"Megaponera analis\" attack the outside of mounds and Dorylinae ants attack underground. Despite this, some termites and ants can coexist peacefully and mutually benefit from cohabitation. Some species of termite, including \"Nasutitermes corniger\", form associations with certain ant species to keep away predatory ant species. The earliest known association between \"Azteca\" ants and \"Nasutitermes\" termites date back to the Oligocene to Miocene period.\n54 species of ants are known to inhabit \"Nasutitermes\" mounds, both occupied and abandoned ones. One reason many ants live in \"Nasutitermes\" mounds is due to the termites' frequent occurrence in their geographical range; another is to protect themselves from floods. \"Iridomyrmex\" also inhabits termite mounds although no evidence for any kind of relationship (other than a predatory one) is known. In rare cases, certain species of termites live inside active ant colonies. Some invertebrate organisms such as beetles, caterpillars, flies and millipedes are termitophiles and dwell inside termite colonies (they are unable to survive independently). As a result, certain beetles and flies have evolved with their hosts. They have developed a gland that secrete a substance that attracts the workers by licking them. Mounds may also provide shelter and warmth to birds, lizards, snakes and scorpions.\nTermites are known to carry pollen and regularly visit flowers, so are regarded as potential pollinators for a number of flowering plants. One flower in particular, \"Rhizanthella gardneri\", is regularly pollinated by foraging workers, and it is perhaps the only Orchidaceae flower in the world to be pollinated by termites.\nMany plants have developed effective defences against termites. However, seedlings are vulnerable to termite attacks and need additional protection, as their defence mechanisms only develop when they have passed the seedling stage. Defence is typically achieved by secreting antifeedant chemicals into the woody cell walls. This reduces the ability of termites to efficiently digest the cellulose. A commercial product, \"Blockaid\", has been developed in Australia that uses a range of plant extracts to create a paint-on nontoxic termite barrier for buildings. An extract of a species of Australian false sandalwood, \"Eremophila mitchellii\", has been shown to repel termites; tests have shown that termites are strongly repelled by the toxic material to the extent that they will starve rather than consume the food. When kept close to the extract, they become disoriented and eventually die.\nRelationship with the environment.\nTermite populations can be substantially impacted by environmental changes including those caused by human intervention. A Brazilian study investigated the termite assemblages of three sites of Caatinga under different levels of anthropogenic disturbance in the semi-arid region of northeastern Brazil were sampled using 65 x 2 m transects. A total of 26 species of termites were present in the three sites, and 196 encounters were recorded in the transects. The termite assemblages were considerably different among sites, with a conspicuous reduction in both diversity and abundance with increased disturbance, related to the reduction of tree density and soil cover, and with the intensity of trampling by cattle and goats. The wood-feeders were the most severely affected feeding group.\nNests.\nA termite nest can be considered as being composed of two parts, the inanimate and the animate. The animate is all of the termites living inside the colony, and the inanimate part is the structure itself, which is constructed by the termites. Nests can be broadly separated into three main categories: hypogeal, i.e subterranean (completely below ground), epigeal (protruding above the soil surface), and arboreal (built above ground, but always connected to the ground via shelter tubes). Epigeal nests (mounds) protrude from the earth with ground contact and are made out of earth and mud. A nest has many functions such as providing a protected living space and providing shelter against predators. Most termites construct underground colonies rather than multifunctional nests and mounds. Primitive termites of today nest in wooden structures such as logs, stumps and the dead parts of trees, as did termites millions of years ago.\nTo build their nests, termites use a variety of resources such as faeces which have many desirable properties as a construction material. Other building materials include partly digested plant material, used in carton nests (arboreal nests built from faecal elements and wood), and soil, used in subterranean nest and mound construction. Not all nests are visible, as many nests in tropical forests are located underground. Species in the subfamily Apicotermitinae are good examples of subterranean nest builders, as they only dwell inside tunnels. Other termites live in wood, and tunnels are constructed as they feed on the wood. Nests and mounds protect the termites' soft bodies against desiccation, light, pathogens and parasites, as well as providing a fortification against predators. Nests made out of carton are particularly weak, and so the inhabitants use counter-attack strategies against invading predators.\nArboreal carton nests of mangrove swamp-dwelling \"Nasutitermes\" are enriched in lignin and depleted in cellulose and xylans. This change is caused by bacterial decay in the gut of the termites: they use their faeces as a carton building material. Arboreal termites nests can account for as much as 2% of above ground carbon storage in Puerto Rican mangrove swamps. These \"Nasutitermes\" nests are mainly composed of partially biodegraded wood material from the stems and branches of mangrove trees, namely, \"Rhizophora mangle\" (red mangrove), \"Avicennia germinans\" (black mangrove) and \"Laguncularia racemosa\" (white mangrove).\nSome species build complex nests called polycalic nests; this habitat is called polycalism. Polycalic species of termites form multiple nests, or calies, connected by subterranean chambers. The termite genera \"Apicotermes\" and \"Trinervitermes\" are known to have polycalic species. Polycalic nests appear to be less frequent in mound-building species although polycalic arboreal nests have been observed in a few species of \"Nasutitermes\".\nMounds.\nNests are considered mounds if they protrude from the earth's surface. A mound provides termites the same protection as a nest but is stronger. Mounds located in areas with torrential and continuous rainfall are at risk of mound erosion due to their clay-rich construction. Those made from carton can provide protection from the rain, and in fact can withstand high precipitation. Certain areas in mounds are used as strong points in case of a breach. For example, \"Cubitermes\" colonies build narrow tunnels used as strong points, as the diameter of the tunnels is small enough for soldiers to block. A highly protected chamber, known as the \"queen's cell\", houses the queen and king and is used as a last line of defence.\nSpecies in the genus \"Macrotermes\" arguably build the most complex structures in the insect world, constructing enormous mounds. These mounds are among the largest in the world, reaching a height of 8 to 9 metres (26 to 29 feet), and consist of chimneys, pinnacles and ridges. Another termite species, \"Amitermes meridionalis\", can build nests 3\u00a0to 4\u00a0metres (9\u00a0to 13 feet) high and 2.5 metres (8\u00a0feet) wide. The tallest mound ever recorded was 12.8 metres (42\u00a0ft) long found in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nThe sculptured mounds sometimes have elaborate and distinctive forms, such as those of the compass termite (\"Amitermes meridionalis\" and \"A. laurensis\"), which builds tall, wedge-shaped mounds with the long axis oriented approximately north\u2013south, which gives them their common name. This orientation has been experimentally shown to assist thermoregulation. The north\u2013south orientation causes the internal temperature of a mound to increase rapidly during the morning while avoiding overheating from the midday sun. The temperature then remains at a plateau for the rest of the day until the evening.\nShelter tubes.\nTermites construct shelter tubes, also known as earthen tubes or mud tubes, that start from the ground. These shelter tubes can be found on walls and other structures. Constructed by termites during the night, a time of higher humidity, these tubes provide protection to termites from potential predators, especially ants. Shelter tubes also provide high humidity and darkness and allow workers to collect food sources that cannot be accessed in any other way. These passageways are made from soil and faeces and are normally brown in colour. The size of these shelter tubes depends on the number of food sources that are available. They range from less than 1\u00a0cm to several cm in width, but may be dozens of metres in length.\nRelationship with humans.\nAs pests.\nOwing to their wood-eating habits, many termite species can do significant damage to unprotected buildings and other wooden structures. Termites play an important role as decomposers of wood and vegetative material, and the conflict with humans occurs where structures and landscapes containing structural wood components, cellulose derived structural materials and ornamental vegetation provide termites with a reliable source of food and moisture. Their habit of remaining concealed often results in their presence being undetected until the timbers are severely damaged, with only a thin exterior layer of wood remaining, which protects them from the environment. Of the 3,106 species known, only 183 species cause damage; 83 species cause significant damage to wooden structures. In North America, 18 subterranean species are pests; in Australia, 16 species have an economic impact; in the Indian subcontinent 26 species are considered pests, and in tropical Africa, 24. In Central America and the West Indies, there are 17 pest species. Among the termite genera, \"Coptotermes\" has the highest number of pest species of any genus, with 28 species known to cause damage. Less than 10% of drywood termites are pests, but they infect wooden structures and furniture in tropical, subtropical and other regions. Dampwood termites only attack lumber material exposed to rainfall or soil.\nDrywood termites thrive in warm climates, and human activities can enable them to invade homes since they can be transported through contaminated goods, containers and ships. Colonies of termites have been seen thriving in warm buildings located in cold regions. Some termites are considered invasive species. \"Cryptotermes brevis\", the most widely introduced invasive termite species in the world, has been introduced to all the islands in the West Indies and to Australia.\nIn addition to causing damage to buildings, termites can also damage food crops. Termites may attack trees whose resistance to damage is low but generally ignore fast-growing plants. Most attacks occur at harvest time; crops and trees are attacked during the dry season.\nIn Australia, at a cost of more than A$ per year, termites cause more damage to houses than fire, floods and storms combined. In Malaysia, it is estimated that termites caused about RM400 million of damages to properties and buildings. The damage caused by termites costs the southwestern United States approximately $1.5\u00a0billion each year in wood structure damage, but the true cost of damage worldwide cannot be determined. Drywood termites are responsible for a large proportion of the damage caused by termites. The goal of termite control is to keep structures and susceptible ornamental plants free from termites.; Structures may be homes or business, or elements such as wooden fence posts and telephone poles. Regular and thorough inspections by a trained professional may be necessary to detect termite activity in the absence of more obvious signs like termite swarmers or alates inside or adjacent to a structure. Termite monitors made of wood or cellulose adjacent to a structure may also provide indication of termite foraging activity where it will be in conflict with humans. Termites can be controlled by application of Bordeaux mixture or other substances that contain copper such as chromated copper arsenate. In the United states, application of a soil termiticide with the active ingredient Fipronil, such as Termidor SC or Taurus SC, by a licensed professional, is a common remedy approved by the Environmental Protection Agency for economically significant subterranean termites. A growing demand for alternative, green, and \"more natural\" extermination methods has increased demand for mechanical and biological control methods such as orange oil.\nTo better control the population of termites, various methods have been developed to track termite movements. One early method involved distributing termite bait laced with immunoglobulin G (IgG) marker proteins from rabbits or chickens. Termites collected from the field could be tested for the rabbit-IgG markers using a rabbit-IgG-specific assay. More recently developed, less expensive alternatives include tracking the termites using egg white, cow milk, or soy milk proteins, which can be sprayed on termites in the field. Termites bearing these proteins can be traced using a protein-specific ELISA test. RNAi insecticides specific to termites are in development. One factor reducing investment in its research and development is concern about high potential for resistance evolution.\nIn 1994, termites, of the species \"Reticulitermes grassei\", were identified in two bungalows in Saunton, Devon. Anecdotal evidence suggests the infestation could date back 70 years before the official identification. There are reports that gardeners had seen white ants and that a greenhouse had had to be replaced in the past. The Saunton infestation was the first and only colony ever recorded in the UK. In 1998, Termite Eradication Programme was set-up, with the intention of containing and eradicating the colony. The TEP was managed by the Ministry of Housing, Communities &amp; Local Government (now the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities.) The TEP used \"insect growth regulators\" to prevent the termites from reaching maturity and reproducing. In 2021, the UK's Termite Eradication Programme announced the eradication of the colony, the first time a country has eradicated termites.\nAs food.\n43 termite species are used as food by humans or are fed to livestock. These insects are particularly important in impoverished countries where malnutrition is common, as the protein from termites can help improve the human diet. Termites are consumed in many regions globally, but this practice has only become popular in developed nations in recent years.\nTermites are consumed by people in many different cultures around the world. In many parts of Africa, the alates are an important factor in the diets of native populations. Groups have different ways of collecting or cultivating insects; sometimes collecting soldiers from several species. Though harder to acquire, queens are regarded as a delicacy. Termite alates are high in nutrition with adequate levels of fat and protein. They are regarded as pleasant in taste, having a nut-like flavour after they are cooked.\nAlates are collected when the rainy season begins. During a nuptial flight, they are typically seen around lights to which they are attracted, and so nets are set up on lamps and captured alates are later collected. The wings are removed through a technique that is similar to winnowing. The best result comes when they are lightly roasted on a hot plate or fried until crisp. Oil is not required as their bodies usually contain sufficient amounts of oil. Termites are typically eaten when livestock is lean and tribal crops have not yet developed or produced any food, or if food stocks from a previous growing season are limited.\nIn addition to Africa, termites are consumed in local or tribal areas in Asia and North and South America. In Australia, Indigenous Australians are aware that termites are edible but do not consume them even in times of scarcity; there are few explanations as to why. Termite mounds are the main sources of soil consumption (geophagy) in many countries including Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe and South Africa. Researchers have suggested that termites are suitable candidates for human consumption and space agriculture, as they are high in protein and can be used to convert inedible waste to consumable products for humans.\nIn agriculture.\nTermites can be major agricultural pests, particularly in East Africa and North Asia, where crop losses can be severe (3\u2013100% in crop loss in Africa). Counterbalancing this is the greatly improved water infiltration where termite tunnels in the soil allow rainwater to soak in deeply, which helps reduce runoff and consequent soil erosion through bioturbation. In South America, cultivated plants such as eucalyptus, upland rice and sugarcane can be severely damaged by termite infestations, with attacks on leaves, roots and woody tissue. Termites can also attack other plants, including cassava, coffee, cotton, fruit trees, maize, peanuts, soybeans and vegetables. Mounds can disrupt farming activities, making it difficult for farmers to operate farming machinery; however, despite farmers' dislike of the mounds, it is often the case that no net loss of production occurs. Termites can be beneficial to agriculture, such as by boosting crop yields and enriching the soil. Termites and ants can re-colonise untilled land that contains crop stubble, which colonies use for nourishment when they establish their nests. The presence of nests in fields enables larger amounts of rainwater to soak into the ground and increases the amount of nitrogen in the soil, both essential for the growth of crops.\nIn science and technology.\nThe termite gut has inspired various research efforts aimed at replacing fossil fuels with cleaner, renewable energy sources. Termites are efficient bioreactors, theoretically capable of producing two litres of hydrogen from a single sheet of paper. Approximately 200 species of microbes live inside the termite hindgut, releasing the hydrogen that was trapped inside wood and plants that they digest. Through the action of unidentified enzymes in the termite gut, lignocellulose polymers are broken down into sugars and are transformed into hydrogen. The bacteria within the gut turns the sugar and hydrogen into cellulose acetate, an acetate ester of cellulose on which termites rely for energy. Community DNA sequencing of the microbes in the termite hindgut has been employed to provide a better understanding of the metabolic pathway. Genetic engineering may enable hydrogen to be generated in bioreactors from woody biomass.\nThe development of autonomous robots capable of constructing intricate structures without human assistance has been inspired by the complex mounds that termites build. These robots work independently and can move by themselves on a tracked grid, capable of climbing and lifting up bricks. Such robots may be useful for future projects on Mars, or for building levees to prevent flooding.\nTermites use sophisticated means to control the temperatures of their mounds. As discussed above, the shape and orientation of the mounds of the Australian compass termite stabilises their internal temperatures during the day. As the towers heat up, the solar chimney effect (stack effect) creates an updraft of air within the mound. Wind blowing across the tops of the towers enhances the circulation of air through the mounds, which also include side vents in their construction. The solar chimney effect has been in use for centuries in the Middle East and Near East for passive cooling, as well as in Europe by the Romans. It is only relatively recently, however, that climate responsive construction techniques have become incorporated into modern architecture. Especially in Africa, the stack effect has become a popular means to achieve natural ventilation and passive cooling in modern buildings.\nIn culture.\nThe Eastgate Centre is a shopping centre and office block in central Harare, Zimbabwe, whose architect, Mick Pearce, used passive cooling inspired by that used by the local termites. It was the first major building exploiting termite-inspired cooling techniques to attract international attention. Other such buildings include the Learning Resource Center at the Catholic University of Eastern Africa and the Council House 2 building in Melbourne, Australia.\nFew zoos hold termites, due to the difficulty in keeping them captive and to the reluctance of authorities to permit potential pests. One of the few that do, the Zoo Basel in Switzerland, has two thriving \"Macrotermes bellicosus\" populations\u00a0\u2013 resulting in an event very rare in captivity: the mass migrations of young flying termites. This happened in September 2008, when thousands of male termites left their mound each night, died, and covered the floors and water pits of the house holding their exhibit.\nAfrican tribes in several countries have termites as totems, and for this reason tribe members are forbidden to eat the reproductive alates. Termites are widely used in traditional popular medicine; they are used as treatments for diseases and other conditions such as asthma, bronchitis, hoarseness, influenza, sinusitis, tonsillitis and whooping cough. In Nigeria, \"Macrotermes nigeriensis\" is used for spiritual protection and to treat wounds and sick pregnant women. In Southeast Asia, termites are used in ritual practices. In Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, termite mounds are commonly worshiped among the populace. Abandoned mounds are viewed as structures created by spirits, believing a local guardian dwells within the mound; this is known as Keramat and Datok Kong. In urban areas, local residents construct red-painted shrines over mounds that have been abandoned, where they pray for good health, protection and luck.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCited literature.\nhttps://"}

Chemically, it is mainly composed of aleuritic acid, jalaric acid, shellolic acid, and other natural waxes. It is processed and sold as dry flakes and dissolved in alcohol to make liquid shellac, which is used as a brush-on colorant, food glaze and wood finish. Shellac functions as a tough natural primer, sanding sealant, tannin-blocker, odor-blocker, stain, and high-gloss varnish. Shellac was once used in electrical applications as it is a good insulator and seals out moisture. Phonograph and 78\u00a0rpm gramophone records were made of shellac until it was replaced by vinyl.\nFrom the time shellac replaced oil and wax finishes in the 19th century, it was one of the dominant wood finishes in the western world until it was largely replaced by nitrocellulose lacquer in the 1920s and 1930s. Besides wood finishing, shellac is used as an ingredient in food, medication and candy as \"confectioner's glaze\", and to preserve harvested citrus fruit.\nEtymology.\n\"Shellac\" comes from \"shell\" and \"lac\", a partial calque of French , 'lac in thin pieces', later , 'gum lac'. Most European languages (except Romance ones and Greek) have borrowed the word for the substance from English or from the German equivalent .\nProduction.\nShellac is scraped from the bark of the trees where the female lac bug, \"Kerria lacca\" (order Hemiptera, family Kerriidae, also known as \"Laccifer lacca\"), secretes it to form a tunnel-like tube as it traverses the branches of the tree. Though these tunnels are sometimes referred to as \"cocoons\", they are not cocoons in the entomological sense. This insect is in the same superfamily as the insect from which cochineal is obtained. The insects suck the sap of the tree and excrete \"sticklac\" almost constantly. The least-coloured shellac is produced when the insects feed on the kusum tree (\"Schleichera\").\nThe number of lac bugs required to produce of shellac has variously been estimated between and . The root word lakh is a unit in the Indian numbering system for and presumably refers to the huge numbers of insects that swarm on host trees, up to .\nThe raw shellac, which contains bark shavings and lac bugs removed during scraping, is placed in canvas tubes (much like long socks) and heated over a fire. This causes the shellac to liquefy, and it seeps out of the canvas, leaving the bark and bugs behind. The thick, sticky shellac is then dried into a flat sheet and broken into flakes, or dried into \"buttons\" (pucks/cakes), then bagged and sold. The end-user then crushes it into a fine powder and mixes it with ethyl alcohol before use, to dissolve the flakes and make liquid shellac.\nLiquid shellac has a limited shelf life (about 1 year), so is sold in dry form for dissolution before use. Liquid shellac sold in hardware stores is often marked with the production (mixing) date, so the consumer can know whether the shellac inside is still good. Some manufacturers (e.g., Zinsser) have ceased labeling shellac with the production date, but the production date may be discernible from the production lot code. Alternatively, old shellac may be tested to see if it is still usable: a few drops on glass should dry to a hard surface in roughly 15 minutes. Shellac that remains tacky for a long time is no longer usable. Storage life depends on peak temperature, so refrigeration extends shelf life.\nThe thickness (concentration) of shellac is measured by the unit \"pound cut\", referring to the amount (in pounds) of shellac flakes dissolved in a gallon of denatured alcohol. For example: a 1-lb. cut of shellac is the strength obtained by dissolving one pound of shellac flakes in a gallon of alcohol (equivalent to ). Most pre-mixed commercial preparations come at a 3-lb. cut. Multiple thin layers of shellac produce a significantly better end result than a few thick layers. Thick layers of shellac do not adhere to the substrate or to each other well, and thus can peel off with relative ease; in addition, thick shellac will obscure fine details in carved designs in wood and other substrates.\nShellac naturally dries to a high-gloss sheen. For applications where a flatter (less shiny) sheen is desired, products containing amorphous silica, such as \"Shellac Flat\", may be added to the dissolved shellac.\nShellac naturally contains a small amount of wax (3%\u20135% by volume), which comes from the lac bug. In some preparations, this wax is removed (the resulting product being called \"dewaxed shellac\"). This is done for applications where the shellac will be coated with something else (such as paint or varnish), so the topcoat will adhere. Waxy (non-dewaxed) shellac appears milky in liquid form, but dries clear.\nColours and availability.\nShellac comes in many warm colours, ranging from a very light blonde (\"platina\") to a very dark brown (\"garnet\"), with many varieties of brown, yellow, orange and red in between. The colour is influenced by the sap of the tree the lac bug is living on and by the time of harvest. Historically, the most commonly sold shellac is called \"orange shellac\", and was used extensively as a combination stain and protectant for wood panelling and cabinetry in the 20th century.\nShellac was once very common anywhere paints or varnishes were sold (such as hardware stores). However, cheaper and more abrasion- and chemical-resistant finishes, such as polyurethane, have almost completely replaced it in decorative residential wood finishing such as hardwood floors, wooden wainscoting plank panelling, and kitchen cabinets. These alternative products, however, must be applied over a stain if the user wants the wood to be coloured; clear or blonde shellac may be applied over a stain without affecting the colour of the finished piece, as a protective topcoat. \"Wax over shellac\" (an application of buffed-on paste wax over several coats of shellac) is often regarded as a beautiful, if fragile, finish for hardwood floors. Luthiers still use shellac to \"French polish\" fine acoustic stringed instruments, but it has been replaced by synthetic plastic lacquers and varnishes in many workshops, especially high-volume production environments.\nShellac dissolved in alcohol, typically more dilute than as used in French polish, is now commonly sold as \"sanding sealer\" by several companies. It is used to seal wooden surfaces, often as preparation for a final more durable finish; it reduces the amount of final coating required by reducing its absorption into the wood.\nProperties.\nShellac is a natural bioadhesive polymer and is chemically similar to synthetic polymers. It can thus be considered a natural form of plastic.\nWith a melting point of , it can be classed as a thermoplastic used to bind wood flour, the mixture can be moulded with heat and pressure.\nShellac scratches more easily than most lacquers and varnishes, and application is more labour-intensive, which is why it has been replaced by plastic in most areas. Shellac is much softer than Urushi lacquer, for instance, which is far superior with regard to both chemical and mechanical resistance. But damaged shellac can easily be touched up with another coat of shellac (unlike polyurethane, which chemically cures to a solid) because the new coat merges with and bonds to the existing coat(s).\nShellac is soluble in alkaline solutions of ammonia, sodium borate, sodium carbonate, and sodium hydroxide, and also in various organic solvents. When dissolved in alcohol (typically denatured ethanol) for application, shellac yields a coating of good durability and hardness.\nUpon mild hydrolysis shellac gives a complex mix of aliphatic and alicyclic hydroxy acids and their polymers that varies in exact composition depending upon the source of the shellac and the season of collection. The major component of the aliphatic component is aleuritic acid, whereas the main alicyclic component is shellolic acid.\nShellac is UV-resistant, and does not darken as it ages (though the wood under it may do so, as in the case of pine).\nHistory.\nThe earliest written evidence of shellac goes back years, but shellac is known to have been used earlier. According to the ancient Indian epic poem, the Mahabharata, an entire palace was coated with dried shellac.\nShellac was uncommonly used as a dyestuff for as long as there was a trade with the East Indies. According to Merrifield, shellac was first used as a binding agent in artist's pigments in Spain in the year 1220. \nThe use of overall paint or varnish decoration on large pieces of furniture was first popularised in Venice (then later throughout Italy). There are a number of 13th-century references to painted or varnished cassone, often dowry cassone that were made deliberately impressive as part of dynastic marriages. The definition of varnish is not always clear, but it seems to have been a spirit varnish based on gum benjamin or mastic, both traded around the Mediterranean. At some time, shellac began to be used as well. An article from the \"Journal of the American Institute of Conservation\" describes using infrared spectroscopy to identify shellac coating on a 16th-century cassone. This is also the period in history where \"varnisher\" was identified as a distinct trade, separate from both carpenter and artist.\nAnother use for shellac is sealing wax. The widespread use of shellac seals in Europe dates back to the 17th century, thanks to the increasing trade with India.\nUses.\nHistorical.\nIn the early- and mid-twentieth century, orange shellac was used as a one-product finish (combination stain and varnish-like topcoat) on decorative wood panelling used on walls and ceilings in homes, particularly in the US. In the American South, use of knotty pine plank panelling covered with orange shellac was once as common in new construction as drywall is today. It was also often used on kitchen cabinets and hardwood floors, prior to the advent of polyurethane.\nUntil the advent of vinyl, most gramophone records were pressed from shellac compounds. From 1921 to 1928, tons of shellac were used to create 260 million records for Europe. In the 1930s, it was estimated that half of all shellac was used for gramophone records. Use of shellac for records was common until the 1950s and continued into the 1970s in some non-Western countries, as well as for some children's records.\nUntil recent advances in technology, shellac was the only glue used in the making of ballet dancers' pointe shoes, to stiffen the box (toe area) to support the dancer en pointe. Many manufacturers of pointe shoes still use the traditional techniques, and many dancers use shellac to revive a softening pair of shoes.\nShellac was historically used as a protective coating on paintings.\nSheets of Braille were coated with shellac to help protect them from wear due to being read by hand.\nShellac was used from the mid-nineteenth century to produce small moulded goods such as picture frames, boxes, toilet articles, jewelry, inkwells and even dentures. Advances in plastics have rendered shellac obsolete as a moulding compound.\nShellac (both orange and white varieties) was used both in the field and laboratory to glue and stabilise dinosaur bones until about the mid-1960s. While effective at the time, the long-term negative effects of shellac (being organic in nature) on dinosaur bones and other fossils is debated, and shellac is very rarely used by professional conservators and fossil preparators today.\nShellac was used for fixing inductor, motor, generator and transformer windings. It was applied directly to single-layer windings in an alcohol solution. For multi-layer windings, the whole coil was submerged in shellac solution, then drained and placed in a warm location to allow the alcohol to evaporate. The shellac locked the wire turns in place, provided extra insulation, prevented movement and vibration and reduced buzz and hum. In motors and generators it also helps transfer force generated by magnetic attraction and repulsion from the windings to the rotor or armature. In more recent times, shellac has been replaced in these applications by synthetic resins such as polyester resin. Some applications use shellac mixed with other natural or synthetic resins, such as pine resin or phenol-formaldehyde resin, of which Bakelite is the best known, for electrical use. Mixed with other resins, barium sulfate, calcium carbonate, zinc sulfide, aluminium oxide and/or cuprous carbonate (malachite), shellac forms a component of heat-cured capping cement used to fasten the caps or bases to the bulbs of electric lamps.\nCurrent uses.\nIt is the central element of the traditional \"French polish\" method of finishing furniture, fine string instruments, and pianos.\nShellac, being edible, is used as a glazing agent on pills (see excipient) and sweets, in the form of pharmaceutical glaze (or, \"confectioner's glaze\"). Because of its acidic properties (resisting stomach acids), shellac-coated pills may be used for a timed enteric or colonic release. Shellac is used as a 'wax' coating on citrus fruit to prolong its shelf/storage life. It is also used to replace the natural wax of the apple, which is removed during the cleaning process. When used for this purpose, it has the food additive E number E904.\nShellac is an odour and stain blocker and so is often used as the base of \"all-purpose\" primers. Although its durability against abrasives and many common solvents is not very good, shellac provides an excellent barrier against water vapour penetration. Shellac-based primers are an effective sealant to control odours associated with fire damage.\nShellac has traditionally been used as a dye for cotton and, especially, silk cloth in Thailand, particularly in the north-eastern region. It yields a range of warm colours from pale yellow through to dark orange-reds and dark ochre. Naturally dyed silk cloth, including that using shellac, is widely available in the rural northeast, especially in Ban Khwao District, Chaiyaphum province. The Thai name for the insect and the substance is \"khrang\" (Thai: \u0e04\u0e23\u0e31\u0e48\u0e07).\nWood finish.\nWood finishing is one of the most traditional and still popular uses of shellac mixed with solvents or alcohol. This dissolved shellac liquid, applied to a piece of wood, is an evaporative finish: the alcohol of the shellac mixture evaporates, leaving behind a protective film.\nShellac as wood finish is natural and non-toxic in its pure form. A finish made of shellac is UV-resistant. For water-resistance and durability, it does not keep up with synthetic finishing products.\nBecause it is compatible with most other finishes, shellac is also used as a barrier or primer coat on wood to prevent the bleeding of resin or pigments into the final finish, or to prevent wood stain from blotching.\nOther.\nShellac is used:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The ship canal is wide and deep. The resulting \"island\" was called \"Kuparisaari\" by Finnish, and also had Irish and French American/French Canadian settlers. settlers in the area. However, neither the United States Geological Survey nor the state of Michigan identify this area as an island or use this name. Isle Royale is the largest naturally isolated island in Lake Superior; considered as an island, Copper Island would be the largest, with an area of around . It has a population around 21,500.\nHistory.\nHistorically, \"Kuparisaari\" ('Copper Island') was used to mean the Keweenaw north of Portage Lake, but more generically the copper country of the Upper Peninsula. Inhabitants of the area wryly claimed \"that they were outside the American mainland. In practical usage, however, the term included towns such as Oskar, Atlantic, Baltic, South Range, Houghton, Dodgeville and Hurontown\" all of which were south of Portage Lake. Nevertheless, \"unquestionably\" Finns in those locales considered themselves to be \"Copper Islanders\". As the foregoing source indicates, \"Copper Island\" has sometimes been used as a sobriquet for Michigan's \"copper country.\"\nBut in a larger sense, \"Kuparisaari\" was an amalgam of geographic location and cultural identity, particularly for the Finns. As one scholarly source notes:\nFinnish immigration to Michigan\u2019s copper district grew to become the most populous ethnic group with an enduring cultural identity. Kuparisaari, \u201ccopper island,\u201d went beyond the Finnish immigrant identification of the island that comprises the northern half of the Keweenaw Peninsula to a symbolic island of landing, an Ellis Island. Michigan\u2019s Copper Country is recognized as focal to Finnish immigration to America, the birthplace of many Finnish-American institutions religious, political and educational. This \u201cisland\u201d includes both settlements in growing industrial urban communities like the Quincy, Calumet &amp; Hecla and Champion mining {\"See,\" Copper Range Company} settlements, and cleared forestland for traditional Finnish agriculture as in Toivola, Tapiola, Elo, Pelkie, and Waasa; Finns settled north and south of the Portage Waterway that bisects the peninsula. Perhaps more than any other immigrant group, the Finnish communities in the district were bisected into divisions of politics and faith. The Finns who immigrated to the copper mining district held to a pietistic Laestadian (Apostolic) Lutheran belief, to the state-sanctioned Lutheranism of Finland (Suomi Synod) or rejected faith altogether. Within these divides of conscience of faith was a wide political spectrum: conservative to liberal adherents, resolute temperance advocates and active radical socialists. The social and economic conditions that emigrants left in northern Scandinavia and the Duchy of Finland influenced these allegiances and beliefs.\nCommunities and transportation.\nThe principal towns on the Copper Island end of Keweenaw Peninsula are Hancock and Calumet. The area is connected to the rest of the Upper Peninsula by the Portage Lake Lift Bridge, the latest in a series of bridges between Hancock and Houghton. The bridge crosses the Portage Canal.\nUS 41 crosses this bridge. It enters Michigan at Menominee and goes north to its terminus just east of Copper Harbor at the far eastern tip of the peninsula.\nModern usage of the name.\nCopper Island is the core that the Keweenaw Water Trail wraps around. It is a designated loop route (which eliminates any need to use a shuttle or spot two vehicles) around and through the Keweenaw Peninsula for canoes and sea kayaks. The Keweenaw Waterway is central to it, crossing the peninsula.\nThe 'Copper Island Classic' is an ice hockey tournament contested annually between Hancock Central High School and Calumet High School. Such local usage still persists, and there are many business in the area that use it.\n\"The Race for Copper Island\" (New York: Benziger Bros., 1905) is a novel written by Henry Sanislaus Spaulding (1865\u20131934) that involves the area.\nAlternate use.\nThe phrase \"Copper Island\" was also used, especially in the 18th century, to describe a possibly mythical island in Lake Superior where there is an abundance of copper sitting on the surface of the land. While some scholars believe this was a reference to Isle Royale, the \"island,\" because of its abundance of copper, could also have been the northern Keweenaw Peninsula, especially given the presence of vast quantities of native copper in the region.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The books are ghostwritten by a number of authors and published under the collective pseudonym Carolyn Keene. Created by Edward Stratemeyer, the founder of the book-packaging firm Stratemeyer Syndicate, as the female counterpart to his Hardy Boys series, the character first appeared in 1930 in the \"Nancy Drew Mystery Stories\" series, which lasted until 2003 and consisted of 175 novels. Over the decades, the character has evolved in response to changes in American culture and tastes. Beginning in 1959, the books were extensively revised and shortened, partly to lower the printing costs, with arguable success. In the revision process, the heroine's original character was changed to be less unruly and violent. In the 1980s, an older and more professional Nancy emerged in a new series, \"The Nancy Drew Files\", that included romantic subplots for the sleuth. Launched in 2004, the \"\" series features Nancy driving a hybrid electric vehicle and using a cell phone. In 2012, the \"Girl Detective\" series ended, and a new series, \"Nancy Drew Diaries\", was launched in 2013. Illustrations of the character evolved over time to reflect contemporary styles.\nThe \"Nancy Drew\" franchise has been adapted into other forms of media with varied success. As of April 2020, the character has been adapted into six feature films, three television series, four television pilots, 34 video games produced by the brand HeR Interactive, and two comic-book series. Film and television adaptations of the character have been met with mixed reviews, and the video games by HeR Interactive have often been lauded. The character proves continuously popular worldwide; at least 80\u00a0million copies of the books have been sold, and the books have been translated into over 45 languages.\nA cultural icon, Nancy Drew is cited as a formative influence by several women, from Supreme Court Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Sonia Sotomayor to former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and former First Lady Laura Bush. Feminist literary critics have analyzed the character's enduring appeal, arguing variously that Nancy Drew is a mythic heroine, an expression of wish fulfillment, or an embodiment of contradictory ideas about femininity.\nCharacteristics.\nNancy Drew is a fictional amateur detective. She is originally depicted as a blonde-haired and blue-eyed 16-year-old high school graduate, but in later editions is rewritten as a titian-haired and blue-eyed 18-year-old graduate and detective. In the series, she lives in the fictional town of River Heights with her father, attorney Carson Drew, and their housekeeper, Hannah Gruen. Carson is very successful in his job, and is often called away on business for days or even weeks at a time, leaving Nancy on her own\u2014and when this happens, he is always shown to have complete faith and trust in Nancy's ability to look after herself, and to solve mysteries. Nancy for her part is very proud of her father and his work, and is unshakable in her respect and admiration for him. She loses her mother at the age of ten in the original versions and at the age of three in the later version. This loss is reflected in her early independence\u2014running a household since the age of ten with Hannah clearly identified as a servant in the earlier series, who is however later referred to as a surrogate parent. As a teenager, she spends her time solving mysteries; some she stumbles upon, and some begin as cases of her father's.\nIn the opening volumes, Nancy's closest friend is the somewhat flighty but fun-loving Helen Corning, but this character is quickly supplanted by the fifth book by her two long-term closest friends, cousins Elizabeth \"Bess\" Marvin and George Fayne. Bess is delicate and feminine, while George is a tomboy. The two are very much opposites, although both are both loyal and devoted friends of Nancy, and usually end up assisting her in the solving of whatever mystery is at hand\u2014Bess much more so than Helen, who is only glimpsed very, very occasionally in later volumes. Nancy is also occasionally joined by her boyfriend Ned Nickerson, a student at Emerson College, who is introduced in the seventh book.\nNancy is often described as a super girl. In the words of Bobbie Ann Mason, she is \"as immaculate and self-possessed as a Miss America on tour. She is as cool as a Rock Star and as sweet as Betty Crocker.\" Nancy is well-off, attractive, and amazingly talented:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;At sixteen, she 'had studied psychology after and in school, and was familiar with the power of suggestion and association.' Nancy was a fine painter, spoke French, and had frequently run motorboats. She was a skilled driver who, at sixteen, 'flashed into the garage with a skill born of long practice.' The prodigy was a sure shot, an excellent swimmer, a skillful oarsman, an expert seamstress, a gourmet cook, and a fine bridge player. Nancy brilliantly played tennis and golf and rode like a cowboy. Nancy danced like Ginger Rogers and could administer first aid like the Mayo brothers.\nNancy never lacks money, and in later volumes of the series often travels to faraway locations, such as France in \"The Mystery of the 99 Steps\" (1966), Lima in \"The Clue in the Crossword Cipher\" (1967), Nairobi in \"The Spider Sapphire Mystery\" (1968), Istanbul in \"The Mysterious Mannequin\" (1970), Austria in \"Captive Witness\" (1981), Japan in \"The Runaway Bride\" (1994), Costa Rica in \"Scarlet Macaw Scandal\" (2004), and Alaska in \"Curse of The Arctic Star\" (2013). Nancy is also able to travel freely about the United States, thanks in part to her car, which is a blue roadster in the original series and a blue convertible in the later books. Despite the trouble and presumed expense to which she goes to solve mysteries, Nancy never accepts monetary compensation; however, by implication, her expenses are often paid by a client of her father's as part of the costs of solving one of his cases.\nThe character of Nancy Drew has gone through many permutations over the years. The Nancy Drew mystery series was revised beginning in 1959, with commentators agreeing that Nancy's character changed significantly from the original Nancy of the books written in the 1930s and 1940s. Observers also often see a difference between the Nancy Drew of the original series, the Nancy of \"The Nancy Drew Files\", and the Nancy of \"Girl Detective\" series. Nevertheless, some find no significant difference among the permutations of Nancy Drew, finding Nancy to be simply a good role model for girls.\nDespite revisions, \"What hasn't changed, however, are [Nancy's] basic values, her goals, her humility, and her magical gift for having at least nine lives. For more than six decades, her essence has remained intact.\" Nancy is a \"teen detective queen\" who \"offers girl readers something more than action-packed adventure: she gives them something original. Convention has it that girls are passive, respectful, and emotional, but with the energy of a girl shot out of a cannon, Nancy bends conventions and acts out every girl's fantasies of power.\"\nOther commentators see Nancy as \"a paradox\u2014which may be why feminists can laud her as a formative 'girl power' icon and conservatives can love her well-scrubbed middle-class values.\"\nCreation.\nThe character was conceived by Edward Stratemeyer, founder of the Stratemeyer Syndicate. In 1926, Stratemeyer created the Hardy Boys series (although the first volumes were not published until 1927), which was such a success that he decided on a similar series for girls, featuring an amateur girl detective as the heroine. While Stratemeyer believed that a woman's place was in the home, he was aware that the Hardy Boys books were popular with girl readers and wished to capitalize on girls' interest in mysteries by offering a strong female heroine.\nStratemeyer initially pitched the new series to Hardy Boys publishers Grosset &amp; Dunlap as the \"Stella Strong Stories,\" adding that \"they might also be called 'Diana Drew Stories,' 'Diana Dare Stories,' 'Nan Nelson Stories,' 'Nan Drew Stories,' or 'Helen Hale Stories.'\" Editors at Grosset &amp; Dunlap preferred \"Nan Drew\" of these options, but decided to lengthen \"Nan\" to \"Nancy\". Stratemeyer accordingly began writing plot outlines and hired Mildred Wirt, later Mildred Wirt Benson, to ghostwrite the first volumes in the series under the pseudonym Carolyn Keene. Subsequent titles have been written by several ghostwriters under the same pseudonym.\nThe first four titles were published in 1930 and were an immediate success. Exact sales figures are not available for the years before 1979. Still, an indication of the books' popularity can be seen in a letter that Laura Harris, a Grosset and Dunlap editor, wrote to the Syndicate in 1931: \"Can you let us have the manuscript as soon as possible, and no later than July 10? There will only be three or four titles brought out then, and Nancy Drew is one of the most important.\"\nThe 6,000 copies that Macy's ordered for the 1933 Christmas season sold out within days. In 1934, \" Fortune\" featured the Syndicate in a cover story and singled Nancy Drew out for particular attention: \"Nancy is the greatest phenomenon among all the fifty-centers. She is a best seller. How she crashed a Valhalla that had been rigidly restricted to the male of her species is a mystery even to her publishers.\"\nHistory.\n1930\u20131959: Early stories.\nThe earliest Nancy Drew books were published as dark-blue hardcovers with the titles stamped in orange lettering with dark-blue outlines and no other images on the cover. The covers went through several changes in the early years: leaving the orange lettering with no outline and adding an orange silhouette of Nancy peering through a magnifying glass; then changing to a lighter blue board with dark blue lettering and silhouette; then changing the position of the title and silhouette on the front with black lettering and a more \"modern\" silhouette.\nNancy Drew is depicted as an independent-minded 16-year-old who has already completed her high school education (16 was the minimum age for graduation at the time). While the first four books of the series are noted for their strong continuity and sense of passing seasons and time, it is lost throughout the series with changes like Nancy's hair color being changed to titian. Her age is changed from 16 to 18 in book 31, \"The Ringmaster's Secret\" (1953), with no in-universe explanation. Affluent (her father is a successful lawyer), she maintains an active social, volunteer, and sleuthing schedule, as well as participating in athletics and the arts, but is never shown as working for a living or acquiring job skills. Nancy is affected neither by the Great Depression\u2014although many of the characters in her early cases need assistance as they are poverty-stricken\u2014nor World War II.\nNancy lives with her lawyer father, Carson Drew, and their housekeeper, Hannah Gruen. Some critics prefer the Nancy of these volumes, largely written by Mildred Benson. Benson is credited with \"[breathing]... a feisty spirit into Nancy's character.\" The original Nancy Drew is sometimes claimed: \"to be a lot like [Benson] herself\u00a0\u2013 confident, competent, and totally independent, quite unlike the cardboard character that [Edward] Stratemeyer had outlined.\"\nThis original Nancy is frequently outspoken and authoritative, so much so that Edward Stratemeyer told Benson that the character was \"much too flip, and would never be well received.\" The editors at Grosset &amp; Dunlap disagreed, but Benson also faced criticism from her next Stratemeyer Syndicate editor, Harriet Adams, who felt that Benson should make Nancy's character more \"sympathetic, kind-hearted and lovable.\" In Benson's words, Adams repeatedly asked Benson to \"make the sleuth less bold... 'Nancy said' became 'Nancy said sweetly,' 'she said kindly,' and the like, all designed to produce a less abrasive, more caring character.\" Many readers and commentators, however, admire Nancy's original outspoken character.\nA prominent critic of the Nancy Drew character, at least the Nancy of these early Nancy Drew stories, is mystery writer Bobbie Ann Mason. Mason contends that Nancy owes her popularity largely to \"the appeal of her high-class advantages.\" Mason also criticizes the series for its racism and classism, arguing that Nancy is the upper-class WASP defender of a \"fading aristocracy, threatened by the restless lower classes.\" Mason further contends that the \"most appealing elements of these daredevil girl sleuth adventure books are (secretly) of this kind: tea and fancy cakes, romantic settings, food eaten in quaint places (never a Ho-Jo's), delicious pauses that refresh, old-fashioned picnics in the woods, precious jewels, and heirlooms... The word dainty is a subversive affirmation of a feminized universe.\" At the bottom, says Mason, the character of Nancy Drew is that of a girl who can be \"perfect\" because she is \"free, white, and sixteen\" and whose \"stories seem to satisfy two standards\u00a0\u2013 adventure and domesticity. But adventure is the superstructure, domesticity the bedrock.\"\nOthers argue that \"Nancy, despite her traditionally feminine attributes, such as good looks, a variety of clothes for all social occasions, and an awareness of good housekeeping, is often praised for her seemingly masculine traits... she operates best independently, has the freedom and money to do as she pleases, and outside of a telephone call or two home, seems to live for solving mysteries rather than participating in family life.\"\n1959\u20131985: Continuation of \"Mystery Stories,\" revisions at Grosset &amp; Dunlap.\nAt the insistence of publishers Grosset &amp; Dunlap, the Nancy Drew books were revised in 1959 to make them more modern and eliminate racist stereotypes. Although Harriet Adams felt that these changes were unnecessary, she oversaw a complete overhaul of the series, as well as writing new volumes in keeping with the new guidelines laid down by Grosset &amp; Dunlap.\nThe series did not so much eliminate racial stereotypes, however, as eliminate non-white characters. For example, in the original version of \"The Hidden Window Mystery\" (1956), Nancy visits friends in the South whose African-American servant, \"lovable old Beulah... serves squabs, sweet potatoes, corn pudding, piping hot biscuits, and strawberry shortcake.\" The house mistress waits until Beulah has left the room and then says to Nancy, \"I try to make things easier for Beulah, but she insists on cooking and serving everything the old-fashioned way. I must confess, though, that I love it.\" In the revised 1975 version, Beulah is changed to Anna, a \"plump, smiling housekeeper\".\nMany other changes were relatively minor. The new books were bound in yellow with color illustrations on the front covers. Nancy's age was raised from 16 to 18, her mother was said to have died when Nancy was three, rather than ten, and other small changes were made. Housekeeper Hannah Gruen, sent off to the kitchen in early stories, became less a servant and more a mother surrogate.\nCritics saw this Nancy of the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s as an improvement in some ways, a step back in others: \"In these new editions, an array of elements had been modified... and most of the more overt elements of racism had been excised. In an often overlooked alteration, however, the tomboyish nature of the text's title character was also tamed.\" Nancy becomes much more respectful of male authority figures in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, leading some to claim that the revised Nancy becomes too agreeable and less distinctive, writing of her, \"In the revised books, Nancy is relentlessly upbeat, puts up with her father's increasingly protective tendencies, and, when asked if she goes to church in the 1969 \"The Clue of the Tapping Heels\", replies, 'As often as I can.\"\nHarriet Adams continued to oversee the series until she died in 1982. After her death, Adams' prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, Nancy Axelrad and Lilo Wuenn, and her three children oversaw the Nancy Drew books and other Stratemeyer Syndicate series production. In 1985, the five sold the Syndicate and all rights to Simon &amp; Schuster. Simon &amp; Schuster turned to book packager Mega-Books for new writers. These books continued to have the characters solve mysteries in the present day while still containing the same basic formula and style of the books during the Syndicate.\n1986\u20131997: \"Files\", \"Super Mystery\", and \"On Campus\".\nIn 1985, as the sale of the Stratemeyer Syndicate to Simon &amp; Schuster was finalized, Simon &amp; Schuster wanted to launch a spin-off series that focused on more mature mysteries and incorporated romance into the stories. To test whether this would work, the final two novels before the sale, \"The Bluebeard Room\" and \"The Phantom of Venice\", were used as backdoor pilots for the new series.\nThe books read are drastically different from the preceding novels of the past 55 years. For example, \"The Phantom of Venice\" (1985) opens with Nancy wondering in italics, \"Am I or am I not in love with Ned Nickerson?\" Nancy begins dating other young men and acknowledges sexual desires: \"'I saw [you kissing him]... You don't have to apologize to me if some guy turns you on.' 'Gianni \"doesn't\" turn me on!... Won't you please let me explain.'\"\nThe next year, Simon &amp; Schuster launched the first Nancy Drew spin-off, titled \"The Nancy Drew Files\". However, after the above-mentioned two Mystery Stories books, as implied in \"The Double Horror of Fenley Place\", Nancy appears to be dating Ned again and the series continues without any reference to Nancy dating other guys in \"The Bluebeard Room\" or in \"The Phantom of Venice\".\nThe Nancy Drew character in the \"Files\" series has earned mixed reviews among fans. Some, including sex-positive feminists, contend that Nancy's character becomes \"more like Mildred Wirt Benson's original heroine than any [version] since 1956.\" Others criticize the series for its increasing incorporation of romance and \"[dilution] of pre-feminist moxie.\"\nOne reviewer noticed, \"Millie [Mildred Wirt Benson] purists tend to look askance upon the \"Files\" series, in which fleeting pecks bestowed on Nancy by her longtime steady, Ned Nickerson, give way to lingering embraces in a Jacuzzi.\" Cover art for \"Files\" titles, such as \"Hit and Run Holiday\" (1986), reflects these changes; Nancy is often dressed provocatively, in short skirts, shirts that reveal her stomach or cleavage, or a bathing suit. She is often pictured with an attentive, handsome boy in the background and frequently appears aware of and interested in that boy.\nThe books emphasize character relationships, with Nancy Drew and Ned Nickerson becoming more of an on-off couple and having other love interests that span multiple books. However, at the end of the last book in the series, statements imply that Nancy keeps dating Ned. The end of the book \"Murder on Ice\" strongly implies that Nancy and Ned engage in sexual intercourse (at the very least, they go into a Jacuzzi together). Nancy also becomes more vulnerable, being often chloroformed into unconsciousness, or defenseless against chokeholds.\nFurthermore, the minor thefts of the original books are replaced by murders and murder attempts, and Nancy is frequently in mortal danger. In an extreme example, in the book \"Deadly Doubles\", the fate of an entire nation and millions of lives are at stake, a character is tortured and strangled off-screen, and Nancy and her allies are nearly killed on five separate occasions.\nThe \"Files\" also launched its spin-off. A crossover spin-off series with \"The Hardy Boys\", titled the \"Super Mystery\" series, began in 1988. These books were in continuity with the similar \"Hardy Boys\" spin-off, \"The Hardy Boys Casefiles\".\nIn 1995, Nancy Drew finally goes to college in the \"Nancy Drew on Campus\" series. These books read more similar to soap opera books, such as the \"Sweet Valley High\" series. The \"On Campus\" books focus more on romance plots and also center around other characters; the mysteries are merely used as subplots.\nBy reader request, Nancy broke off her long-term relationship with boyfriend Ned Nickerson in the second volume of the series, \"On Her Own\" (1995). Similar to the \"Files\" series, reception for the \"On Campus\" series was also mixed, with some critics viewing the inclusion of adult themes such as date rape as \"unsuccessful\". Carolyn Carpan commented that the series was \"more soap opera romance than mystery\" and that Nancy \"comes across as dumb, missing easy clues she wouldn't have missed in previous series\". The series was also criticized for focusing more on romance than on grades or studying, with one critic stating that the series resembled collegiate academic studying in the 1950s, where \"women were more interested in pursuing... the 'MRS' degree.\"\nIn 1997, Simon &amp; Schuster announced a mass cancellation of \"Nancy Drew\" and \"Hardy Boys\" spin-offs, except for younger children. The \"Files\" series ran until the end of 1997, while both the \"Super Mystery\" and \"On Campus\" series ran until the beginning of 1998.\n2003\u20132012: \"Girl Detective\" and graphic novels.\nIn 2003, publishers Simon &amp; Schuster ended the original Nancy Drew series and began featuring Nancy's character in a new mystery series, \"Girl Detective\". The Nancy Drew of the \"Girl Detective\" series drives a hybrid car, uses a mobile phone, and recounts her mysteries in the first person. Since the series is set in the 21st century, several technologies and pop-culture references exist. Many applaud these changes, arguing that Nancy has not changed at all other than learning to use a cell phone. Others praise the series as more realistic; Nancy, these commentators argue, is now a less perfect and therefore more likable being, one whom girls can more easily relate to\u00a0\u2013 a better role model than the old Nancy because she can be emulated, rather than a \"prissy automaton of perfection.\" (This is more a description of the Nancy of the 1959 revision, rather than the \u2018unruly\u2019 original).\nSome, mostly fans, vociferously lament the changes, seeing Nancy as a silly, air-headed girl whose trivial adventures (such as discovering who squished the zucchini in 2004's \"Without a Trace\") \"hold a shallow mirror to a pre-teen's world.\" Leona Fisher is typical of these, trying to argue that the new series portrays an increasingly white River Heights, partially because \"the clumsy first-person narrative voice makes it nearly impossible to interlace external authorial attitudes into the discourse,\" while it continues and worsens \"the implicitly xenophobic cultural representations of racial, ethnic, and linguistic others\" by introducing what she calls gratuitous speculations on characters' national and ethnic origins. There is more of this sort of thing.\nThe character is also the heroine of a series of graphic novels, begun in 2005 and produced by Papercutz. The graphic novels are written by Stefan Petrucha and illustrated in manga-style artwork by Sho Murase. The character's graphic novel incarnation has been described as \"a fun, sassy, modern-day teen who is still hot on the heels of criminals.\"\nWhen the 2007 film was released, a non-canon novelization of the movie was written to look like the older books. A new book was written for each of the \"Girl Detective\" and \"Clue Crew\" series, which deal with a mystery on a movie set. In 2008, the \"Girl Detective\" series was re-branded into trilogies with a model on the cover. These mysteries became deeper, with the mystery often spread across three books and multiple culprits. These trilogies also met with negative fan reception due to Nancy's constant mistakes, the shortness of the books, and the lack of action. With the new trilogy format, sales began slipping. In 2010, Simon &amp; Schuster cut back from six to four \"Nancy Drew\" books per year. In December 2011, they announced that the series was canceled along with the Hardy Boys \"Undercover Brothers\".\n2013\u2013present: \"Diaries\".\nWith the cancellation of the \"Girl Detective\" series, the \"Nancy Drew Diaries\" started in 2013. The series is described as \"a classic Nancy Drew with her modern twist\", following Nancy, with her friends Bess and George, solving both violent and nonviolent crimes. The series is similar to the \"Nancy Drew Girl Detective\" series, continuing the first person narration, references to modern pop culture and technology, and featuring stories with themes of environmentalism. However, this series is more targeted to readers aged 8\u201312 with noticeable changes. This iteration of Nancy does not navigate the world of adults like previous versions of the character. She is more looked down upon by adults and has to prove herself capable of handling a mystery. This series always includes her friends. The mysteries tend to be notes thrilling since the series is made for children 8-11 years old, but certain books are indeed similar to the original Nancy Drew series.\nAs of 2025, there are 26 books in the series plus one holiday special published in 2018 that also features The Hardy Boys. This is the first series to be available in three different formats: paperback, hardcover (with dust jacket), and eBooks.\nGhostwriters.\nConsistent with other Stratemeyer Syndicate properties, the Nancy Drew novels were written by various writers, all under the pen name Carolyn Keene. Following the customs of Stratemeyer Syndicate series production, ghostwriters for the Syndicate signed contracts that have sometimes been interpreted as requiring authors to sign away all rights to authorship or future royalties. Contracts stated that authors could not use their Stratemeyer Syndicate pseudonyms independently of the Syndicate. In the early days of the Syndicate, ghostwriters were paid a fee of $125, \"roughly equivalent to two months' wages for a typical newspaper reporter, the primary day job of the syndicate ghosts.\"\nDuring the Great Depression, this fee was lowered to $100 and eventually $75. All royalties went to the Syndicate, and all correspondence with the publisher was handled through a Syndicate office. The Syndicate was able to enlist the cooperation of libraries in hiding the ghostwriters' names; when Walter Karig, who wrote volumes eight through ten of the original \"Nancy Drew Mystery Stories\", tried to claim rights with the Library of Congress in 1933, the Syndicate instructed the Library of Congress not to reveal the names of any Nancy Drew authors, a move with which the Library of Congress complied.\nThe Syndicate's process for creating the Nancy Drew books consisted of creating a detailed plot outline, drafting a manuscript, and editing the manuscript. Edward Stratemeyer and his daughters Harriet Adams and Edna Stratemeyer Squier wrote most of the outlines for the original Nancy Drew series until 1979. Volume 30, \"The Clue of the Velvet Mask\" (1953), was outlined by Andrew Svenson. Usually, other writers wrote the manuscripts. Most of the early volumes were written by Mildred Wirt Benson. Other volumes were written by Walter Karig, George Waller, Jr., Margaret Scherf, Wilhelmina Rankin, Alma Sasse, Charles S. Strong, Iris Vinton, and Patricia Doll.\nLater titles were penned by Nancy Axelrad, Sharon Wagner, and James Duncan Lawrence, and according to \"Book Riot\", Carol Gorman, Ellen Steiber, and Alison Hart Edward \"each wrote several Nancy Drews in the 1980s and '90s.\" Stratemeyer edited the first three volumes, and Harriet Adams edited most subsequent volumes until she died in 1982. In 1959, the earlier titles were revised, largely by Adams. From the late 1950s until she died in 1982, Adams herself wrote the manuscripts for most of the books.\nAfter Adams' death, series production was overseen by Nancy Axelrad (who also wrote several volumes). The rights to the character were sold in 1984, along with the Stratemeyer Syndicate itself, to Simon &amp; Schuster. Book packager Mega-Books subsequently hired authors to write the main Nancy Drew series and a new series, \"The Nancy Drew Files\".\nLegal disputes.\nIn 1980, Harriet Adams switched publishers to Simon &amp; Schuster, dissatisfied with the lack of creative control at Grosset &amp; Dunlap and the lack of publicity for the Hardy Boys' 50th anniversary in 1977. Grosset &amp; Dunlap filed suit against the Syndicate and the new publishers, Simon &amp; Schuster, citing \"breach of contract, copyright infringement, and unfair competition.\"\nAdams filed a countersuit, claiming the case was in poor taste and frivolous and that, as the author of the Nancy Drew series, she retained the rights to her work. Although Adams had written many of the titles after 1953 and edited others, she claimed to be the author of all of the early titles. She had rewritten the older titles and was not their original author. When Mildred Benson was called to testify about her work for the Syndicate, Benson's role in writing the manuscripts of early titles was revealed in court with extensive documentation, contradicting Adams' claims to authorship. The court ruled that Grosset had the right to publish the original series as they were in print in 1980 but did not own characters or trademarks. Furthermore, any new publishers chosen by Adams were completely within their rights to print new titles.\nIllustrations.\nNancy Drew has been illustrated by many artists over the years, and her look constantly updated. The Stratemeyer Syndicate and the books' publishers have exercised control over how Nancy is depicted. Some aspects of Nancy's portrayal have remained relatively constant through the decades. Her most characteristic physical depiction is that she is shown holding a flashlight.\n1930\u20131949: Russell H. Tandy.\nCommercial artist Russell H. Tandy was the first artist to illustrate Nancy Drew. Tandy was a fashion artist and infused Nancy with a contemporary fashion sensibility: her early style is that of a flatfoot flapper: heeled Mary Janes accompany her blue flapper skirt suit and cloche hat on three of the first four-volume dust jackets. As styles changed over the next few years, Nancy began to appear in glamorous frocks, with immaculately set hair, pearls, matching hats, gloves, and handbags. By the 1940s, Nancy wore simpler, tailored suits and outfits; her hair was often arranged in a pompadour. In the post-war era, Tandy's Nancy is shown hatless, wearing casual skirt and blouse ensembles, and carrying a purse, like most teens of the late 1940s.\nTandy drew the inside sketches for the first 26 volumes of the series and painted the covers of the first 26 volumes except for volume 11\u00a0\u2013 the cover artist for volume 11 is unknown. Tandy read each text before sketching, so his early covers were closely connected to specific plot scenes. He also hand-painted the cover lettering and designed the original Nancy Drew logo: a silhouette of Nancy bending slightly and looking at the ground through a magnifying glass.\nTandy often portrays Nancy Drew with confident, assertive body language. She never appears \"shocked, trepidatious, or scared.\" Nancy is shown either boldly in the center of the action or actively, but secretively, investigating a clue. She is often observed by a menacing figure and appears to be in imminent danger, but her confident expression suggests to viewers that she is in control of the situation.\nTandy's home was struck by fire in 1962, and most of his original paintings and sketches were destroyed. As a result, the Tandy dust-jackets are considered valuable by collectors.\n1950\u20131952: Bill Gillies.\nBeginning with Tandy in 1948 and continuing into the early 1950s, Nancy's appearance was updated to follow the prevailing styles. In postwar opulence, a trend emerged for young adults to have their casual style instead of dressing in the same styles as more mature adults, and Nancy became less constrained. Sweater or blouse and skirt ensembles and a pageboy hairstyle were introduced in 1948 and continued with new artist Bill Gillies. They updated ten covers and illustrated three new jackets from 1950 to 1952. Using Gillies's wife for a model, Nancy reflects the conservative 1950s, with immaculately waved hair and a limited wardrobe\u00a0\u2013 she wears a similar sweater, blouse, and skirt ensembles, in different combinations, on most of these covers. Gillies also designed the modern-era trademark as a spine symbol used for decades: Nancy's head in profile, looking through a quizzing glass.\nIn the later Tandy period (1946\u00a0\u2013 1949) and throughout the 1950s, Nancy is depicted less frequently in the center of the action. \"The Ghost of Blackwood Hall\" shows an assertive Nancy leading more timid friends up the front steps of the haunted house and marks a transition to later illustrations. From 1949 forward, she is likely to observe others, often hiding or concealing herself. Her mouth is often open in surprise, and she hides her body from view. Although Nancy \"expresses surprise, she is not afraid. She appears to be a bit taken aback by what she sees, but she looks as if she is still in control of the situation.\"\nMany of these covers feature Nancy poised to observe a clue, spy on criminal activity, or display her discoveries to others involved in the mystery. Only occasionally is she shown in action, such as running from the scene of a fire, riding a horse, or actively sleuthing with a flashlight. At times she is only involved in the action as her hiding place has been discovered by others. In most cases, more active scenes are used for the frontispiece, or in books after 1954, illustrations throughout the text drawn by uncredited illustrators.\n1953\u20131979: Rudy Nappi.\nJoseph Rudolf \"Rudy\" Nappi, the artist from 1953 to 1979, illustrated a more average teenager. Nappi was asked by Grosset &amp; Dunlap's art director to update Nancy's appearance, especially her wardrobe. Nappi gave Nancy Peter Pan collars shirtwaist dresses, a pageboy (later a flip) haircut, and the occasional pair of jeans. Nancy's hair color was changed from blonde to strawberry-blonde, reddish-blonde, or titian by the end of the decade. The change was long rumored to have resulted from a printing ink error. Still, it was considered so favorable that it was adopted in the text for books published after 1959 and by illustrator Polly Bolian for volumes she created for a special book club in 1959\u201360.\nIn 1962, all Grosset &amp; Dunlap books became \"picture covers\", books with artwork and advertising printed directly on their covers, as opposed to books with a dust jacket over a tweed volume. The change was to reduce production costs. Several of the 1930s and 1940s cover illustrations were updated by Nappi for this change, depicting a Nancy of the Kennedy era, though the stories themselves were not updated.\nInternal illustrations, dropped in 1937, were returned to the books beginning in 1954 as pen and ink line drawings, mostly by uncredited artists but usually corresponding with Nappi's style of drawing Nancy on the covers. Nappi followed trends initiated by Gillies and often illustrated Nancy wearing the same clothing more than once, including a mustard shirtwaist dress.\nUnlike Tandy, Nappi did not read the books before illustrating them; his wife read them and provided him with a brief plot summary before Nappi began painting. Nappi's first cover was for \"The Clue of the Velvet Mask\", where he began a trend of portraying Nancy as \"bobby-soxer... a contemporary sixteen-year-old. This Nancy was perky, clean-cut, and extremely animated. In the majority of his covers, Nancy looks startled\u00a0\u2013 which, no doubt, she was.\" Nancy's style is considered conservative and remains so during the psychedelic period.\nAlthough she wears bold colors and prints, or the background colors are shades of electric yellow, shocking pink, turquoise, or apple green, her clothing is high-necked and with long hemlines. Earlier Nappi covers show Nancy in poses similar to those in the covers by Tandy and Gillies; for many updated covers, he simply updated the characters' color scheme, clothing style, and hairstyles but retains their original poses in similar settings. Later Nappi covers show only Nancy's head or part of her body, surrounded by spooky or startling elements or clues from the story. These Nappi covers would later be used for the opening credits of the television production, with photos of Pamela Sue Martin inserted on the book covers.\nOften, \"Nancy's face wears the blank expression of one lost in thought,\" making her appear passive. On the cover of \"The Strange Message in the Parchment\" (1977), for example, in contrast to earlier covers, Nancy \"is not shown in the midst of danger or even watching a mystery unfold from a distance. Instead, Nancy is shown thinking about the clues\"; in general, Nancy becomes less confident and more puzzled.\n1980\u20132000s: Ruth Sanderson, Paul Frame, and others.\nRuth Sanderson and Paul Frame provided cover art, and interior illustrations for the first Nancy Drew paperbacks published under the Wanderer imprint. Other artists, including Aleta Jenks and others whose names are unknown, provided the cover art, but no interior illustrations, for later paperbacks. Nancy is portrayed as \"a wealthy, privileged sleuth who looks pretty and alert... The colors, and Nancy's facial features, are often so vivid that some of the covers look more like glossy photographs than paintings.\"\nNancy is frequently portrayed pursuing a suspect, examining a clue or observing the action. She is often also shown in peril: being chased, falling off a boat, or hanging by a rope from rafters. These covers are \"characterized by frenetic energy on Nancy's part; whether she is falling, limbs flailing, an alarmed look on her face, or running, hair flying, body bent, face breathless. Nancy does not have any control over the events that are happening in these covers. She is shown to be a victim, being hunted and attacked by unseen foes.\" Nancy is sometimes pursued by a visibly threatening foe, as on the cover of \"The Case of the Vanishing Veil\" (1988).\nThe covers of \"The Nancy Drew Files\" and \"Girl Detective\" series represent further departures from Tandy's bold, confident character. The Nancy portrayed on the covers of \"The Nancy Drew Files\" is \"a markedly sexy Nancy, with a handsome young man always lurking in the background. Her clothes often reveal an ample bustline, and her expression is mischievous.\"\nIn the \"Girl Detective\" series, Nancy's face is depicted on each cover in fragments. Her eyes, for example, are confined to a strip across the top of the cover, and her mouth is near the spine, in a box, separate from her eyes. The artwork for Nancy's eyes and mouth is taken from Rudy Nappi's cover art for the revised version of \"The Secret of the Old Clock\".\nIn the \"Diaries\" series, Erin McGuire made all of the cover illustrations. They depict Nancy sleuthing in the book-specific locations, much like the original series. She looks younger, and the art style is more appealing to its target demographic of children. She is always alone on the cover, usually in pursuit of a suspect.\nBooks.\nThe longest-running series of books to feature Nancy Drew is the original Nancy Drew series, whose 175 volumes were published from 1930 to 2003. Nancy also appeared in 124 titles in \"The Nancy Drew Files\" and became the heroine of the \"Diaries\" series. Various other series feature the character, such as the \"Nancy Drew Notebooks\" and \"Nancy Drew on Campus\". While Nancy Drew is the central character in each series, continuity is preserved only within one series, not between them all; for example, in concurrently published titles in the \"Nancy Drew\" series and the \"Nancy Drew on Campus\" series, Nancy is respectively dating her boyfriend Ned Nickerson and broken up with Ned Nickerson.\nThe two exceptions are the series \"Super Mystery\" (also called \"A Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys Super Mystery\"), which ran concurrently with the \"Files\" and shares continuity with those stories and the then-running \"Hardy Boys Casefiles\", and in 2007, a new \"A Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys Super Mystery\" series shared continuity with the \"Girl Detective\" series. The Hardy Boys also appeared in the special holiday book of the \"Diaries\" series.\nIn 2023, the history of the \"Nancy Drew\" franchise was chronicled in \"What is the Story of Nancy Drew?\", a children's nonfiction book written by Dana Meachen Rau and illustrated by Dede Putra, with an unabridged narration performed by Jorjeana Marie.\nInternational publications.\nThe main \"Nancy Drew\" series, \"The Nancy Drew Files\", and the \"Girl Detective\" books have been translated into a number of languages besides English. Estimates vary from between 14 and 25 languages. Nancy Drew books have been published in many European countries (especially in Nordic countries and France) as well as in Latin America and Asia. The character of Nancy Drew seems to be more popular in some countries than others. Nancy Drew books have been in print in Norway since 1941 (the first country outside the United States), in Denmark since 1958, in France since 1955, and in Italy since 1970 by Arnoldo Mondadori Editore. Other countries, such as Estonia, have only recently begun printing Nancy Drew books.\nNancy's name is often changed in translated editions: in France, she is known as Alice Roy; in Sweden, as Kitty Drew; in Finland, as Paula Drew; and in Norway, the book series has the name of \"Fr\u00f8ken Detektiv\" (\"Miss Detective\"), though the heroine's name is still Nancy Drew inside the books. In Germany, Nancy is a German law student named Susanne Langen. George Fayne's name is even more frequently changed, to Georgia, Joyce, Kitty, or Marion. Cover art and series order is often changed as well, and in many countries, only a limited number of Drew books are available in translation.\nFilms.\nBonita Granville.\nIn 1937, Warner Bros. bought the rights to the \"Nancy Drew\" book series from the Stratemeyer Syndicate, for a reported $6,000. Warner Bros. wanted to make a series of B-films based on the character, to serve as a companion to their popular \"Torchy Blane\" B-film series, which starred Glenda Farrell, Barton MacLane, and Tom Kennedy. Adams sold the rights to Jack L. Warner without an agent or any consultation; thus, she sold all and any film rights to Warner Bros., a move she would later regret and that would later come into question by her publishers.\nFrom 1938 to 1939, four films in the series were released. All of them were directed by William Clemens, written by \"Torchy Blane\" writer Kenneth Gamet, and featured the same primary cast: Bonita Granville as Nancy Drew, John Litel as Carson Drew, and Frankie Thomas as Ted Nickerson (changed from Ned Nickerson). Renie Riano and Frank Orth also appeared in some of the films as Effie Schneider and Captain Tweedy, respectively.\nThe four are as follows: \nThe series was announced by Warner Bros. in April 1938; production of the first film, \"Nancy Drew Gets the Passport\", was set to begin production in June, directed by John Farrow with a screenplay from Robertson White. However, for unclear reasons, Farrow and White were replaced by Clemens and Gamet, and production was delayed to August. The first two films did well enough to allow Warner Bros. to expand the budgets for the third and fourth films; in early 1939, they announced the green-lighting of an additional four films, which would have brought the total up to eight.\nAfter the second film, Warner Bros. assigned the third film, originally titled \"Nancy Drew Steps Out\", to Eddie Anderson and Charles Perry; like White, they were replaced under unclear circumstances. Gamet was once again rehired to write for the series and completed writing the eight films. In late 1939, Warner Bros. decided to eliminate their double feature setup, thus canceling the \"Nancy Drew\" film series. Although it was initially announced that the \"Nancy Drew\" series would be converted into two-reelers, Warner Bros. canceled those plans days later. Gamet had at least written the fifth and sixth film, and the fifth may have been produced. Frankie Thomas stated that he believes he and Granville had made five films, not four, while Harriet Adams wrote in August 1939 to Mildred Wirt, the ghostwriter of the books at the time, that \"three have been shown in this area, and I have just heard that a fifth is in production.\" In addition, Gamet had reportedly written a sixth film.\nCritical reaction to these films was mixed. Some found that the movies do not \"depict the true Nancy Drew\", in part because Granville's Nancy \"blatantly used her feminine wiles (and enticing bribes)\" to accomplish her goals. The films also portray Nancy as childish and easily flustered, a significant change from her portrayal in the books. Just as with the critics, both ghostwriter Mildred Wirt and editor Harriet Adams were also divided on the films' reception. Adams did not like the films and resented the studio for its treatment of the character; she did, however, keep a personalized autographed photo from Granville on her office desk for many years according to her employees and may have used John Litel's portrayal of Carson Drew to revamp the character when she revised the books in the 1960s and 1970s. Contrary to Adams, Benson was said to have liked the films of the time, despite them being different from the character she wrote.\nTo promote the film, Warner Bros. created a Nancy Drew fan club that included a set of rules such as \"must have steady boy friend, in the sense of a 'pal'\" and must \"take part in choosing own clothes.\" These rules were based on some research Warner Bros. had done on the habits and attitudes of \"typical\" teenage girls. Granville was the \"honorary president\" of the fan club, and a kit for the club came with autographed pictures of her.\nThe series became somewhat of a cult success after the films started appearing on cable channels such as Turner Classic Movies. The films were arguably ones in which all five cast members were notable for in their careers. Granville recalled making the films fondly and later called \"Nancy Drew... Trouble Shooter\" her favorite of the four. She and Litel would later reunite for the 1947 film \"The Guilty\", produced by Granville's husband Jack Wrather.\nEmma Roberts.\nA new film version of \"Nancy Drew\" had been in the works at Warner Bros. since the mid-1990s. However, nothing came to fruition until the mid-2000s. On June 15, 2007, Warner Bros. Pictures released a new film titled \"Nancy Drew\", with Emma Roberts starring as Nancy, Max Thieriot as Ned Nickerson, and Tate Donovan as Carson Drew; Andrew Fleming directed and cowrote the film with Tiffany Paulsen, while Jerry Weintraub produced. This film sees Nancy move to Los Angeles with her father on an extended business trip and pick the house of a murdered movie star as their house to solve the cold case.\nAs with the earlier \"Drew\" films, reactions were mixed. Some see the film as an updated version of the basic character: \"Although it has been glammed up for the lucrative tween demographic, the movie retains the best parts of the books, including, of course, their intelligent main character.\" Others find the movie \"jolting\" because Nancy's \"new classmates prefer shopping to sleuthing, and Nancy's plaid skirt, penny loafers, and magnifying glass make her something of a dork, not the town hero she was in the Midwest.\" Before the release of the 2007 film, Roberts, Fleming, and Weintraub had signed on for two \"Nancy Drew\" sequels, but these films were never made.\nSophia Lillis.\nOn April 20, 2018, Warner Bros. announced they were making a new \"Nancy Drew\" film series, starring Sophia Lillis as Nancy. The first film was adapted from \"The Hidden Staircase\", with Ellen DeGeneres and Wendy Williams among the producers.\nTelevision.\n\"The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries\".\nThe first and most successful attempt at bringing Nancy Drew to life on television was \"The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries\", which ran from 1977 to 1979 on ABC. Future \"Dynasty\" star Pamela Sue Martin starred as Nancy, with Jean Rasey and George O'Hanlon, Jr. as friends George and Ned, and William Schallert as Carson Drew.\nThe first season originally alternated with the Hardy Boys; the Hardy Boys was met with success, but the Drew episodes were met with mixed results. In the second season, the format shifted to present the Hardy Boys as the more prominent characters, with Nancy Drew mostly a character in crossover episodes.\nThe three \"solo\" episodes made that season featured Susan Buckner in the role of George, and focused on more bizarre cases. After the thirteenth episode, Martin left the series, citing the changes made to the character and show. 19-year-old Janet Louise Johnson replaced Martin for her final four appearances, all of which were crossover episodes. When the series came back for a third season, Nancy Drew was dropped from the series, with it now focusing completely on the Hardy Boys; ABC canceled the series soon after this change.\nThough the \"Nancy Drew\" aspect of the show received mixed reception, it is regarded as the most faithful adaptation of the character, with Martin often regarded by many fans as the best actress to portray her. The series was also faithful in its tone of smaller mysteries, such as haunted houses or theft.\n\"Nancy Drew\" (1995 TV series).\nThe second \"Nancy Drew\" series, \"Nancy Drew\" aired in first-run syndication from September to December 1995. Produced by Nelvana, Tracy Ryan starred as Nancy Drew, who is now a 21-year-old criminology student, moving to New York City and living in an upscale apartment complex called the \"Callisto\". Nancy solved various mysteries with Bess (Jhene Erwin), a gossip columnist at \"The Rag\", and George (Joy Tanner), a mail carrier and amateur filmmaker. Scott Speedman recurred as Ned Nickerson, who works on charity missions in Africa. This \"Nancy Drew\" series was again partnered with a series based on \"The Hardy Boys\", with Ryan appearing in two episodes of the latter series as Nancy.\nThe series was based on \"The Nancy Drew Files\" series, and the three stars were used on several of the series' covers to promote the show. Both shows were cancelled midway through their first seasons due to low ratings; the poorly syndicated half-hour shows aired in a slot outside of prime time on the newly launched The WB and UPN networks. The entire series has since been released on DVD, and has appeared on several online streaming sites, including the Retro Rerun YouTube channel.\n\"Nancy Drew\" (2002 film).\nOn December 15, 2002, ABC aired \"Nancy Drew\", starring Maggie Lawson and produced by Lawrence Bender. The movie was intended to be a pilot for a possible weekly series, which would see Nancy and her friends going off to college in a modern setting and Nancy pursuing a journalism degree. Like the 1930s films, this pilot also took a more mature turn, with the mystery being a drug bust and Nancy having a falling out with her father. The pilot aired as part of the \"Wonderful World of Disney\" series, with additional scripts being ordered and production contingent on the movie's ratings and reception. The series was passed at ABC, and UPN also passed after Lawson was cast in another ABC series.\n\"Nancy Drew\" (2019 TV series).\nThe third television series, \"Nancy Drew\", premiered on The CW on October 9, 2019. Developed by Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage, this series stars Kennedy McMann as Nancy Drew, with co-stars including Leah Lewis as George and Scott Wolf as Carson Drew. This series revolves around Nancy as she heads off to college, only to have to stay back for another year after finding herself the prime suspect in a murder investigation. Like other adaptations of the character, it has received mixed reviews.\nMuch like fellow CW series \"Riverdale\", the adaptation features serialized, soap opera-esque storylines. In addition to including more mature elements such as sex and violence, the series relies on supernatural elements, such as ghosts and extrasensory perception. In addition, it greatly diverges from several of the source material's formula (e.g. race and personality changes of the main characters; Nancy, Bess, and George not being friends; Ned/\"Nick\" is a former criminal and an older, secret boyfriend), location (e.g. the main setting being the fictional seaside town of Horseshoe Bay, Maine, instead of the fictional Midwestern city of River Heights), and background (e.g., Carson Drew is not Nancy's biological father, Nancy's adoptive mother dying when she was an older teenager instead of a child).\nFailed TV attempts.\nIn March 1957, CBS greenlit a pilot for a television series based on the books for the 1957\u201358 television season, which was produced by \"Private Secretary\" writer Arthur Hoffe. At that time, it was reported that Robin Morgan and Natalie Trundy were under consideration for the role of Nancy. However, by late May, 17-year-old former RKO contract actress Jan Norris was cast in the role of Nancy. CBS initially did not make a decision on the project for the fall schedule, instead opting to roll it to midseason or the 1958\u201359 season. An initial pilot was produced in April, though the network was reportedly unsatisfied with the results and replaced Hoffe with \"Mama\" producer Carol Irwin. A new pilot pilot from Irwin was produced and directed by Don Richardson. Under Irwin, scripts were being written, but by September, CBS had lost the rights to the books and the project was abandoned.\nIn the 2010s and early 2020s, the pilot was believed to have been produced by Desilu based on the Warner Bros. films, and star Roberta Shore as Nancy, Tim Considine as Ned Nickerson, and Frankie Thomas, Jr. as Carson Drew. However, this conflicts with contemporary reports. Considine and Shore were both under contract to \"The Mickey Mouse Club\" \u2014 where Considine had portrayed Frank Hardy in a serial based on \"The Hardy Boys\" books \u2014 and Thomas had retired in 1955.\nIn October 1989, Canadian production company Nelvana began filming for a 13-episode Nancy Drew television series called \"Nancy Drew and Daughter\" for USA Network. Margot Kidder was cast as an adult Nancy Drew, and her daughter, Maggie McGuane, was cast as Nancy's daughter. However, Kidder was seriously injured during filming of the first episode when the brakes failed on the car she was driving. The pilot was not finished, and the series was cancelled.\nIn October 2015, CBS announced it would be developing a new series based on an older version of Nancy. In January 2016, CBS ordered a pilot under the working title \"Drew\", and that the character would be a non-Caucasian New York City police detective in her thirties. The pilot, written by Joan Rater and Tony Phelan, revolved around Nancy investigating the death of Bess Marvin, and reentering the NYPD after taking leave. Sarah Shahi was cast as Nancy Drew, with Vanessa Ferlito as George Fayne, Anthony Edwards as Carson Drew, Steve Kazee as Ned Nickerson, and Debra Monk as Hannah Gruen. The pilot was shot in location in New York City during March 2016, and was directed by James Strong. During this time, Phelan and Rater had another pilot, \"Doubt\", which many television reporters often placed in competition for a series order with \"Drew\". On May 14, 2016, it was announced that CBS decided to order \"Doubt\", and pass on the \"Drew\" pilot, so CBS Studios could shop it to other networks for series consideration, though none did.\nIn October 2017, Phelan and Rater brought a redeveloped pilot to NBC, where the plot now revolved around a middle-aged Nancy who wrote her adventures into novels has to team up with her former friends to solve a murder mystery. However, the redeveloped plot never made it to pilot at the network, and Phelan and Rater have since left CBS Studios.\nOther media.\nVideo games.\nComputer games publisher HeR Interactive began publishing an adventure game series based on the character in 1998. The games follow the popular \"point-and-click format\" with players playing as Nancy and using their mouse to move around a virtual environment to talk to suspects, pick up clues, solve puzzles, and eventually solve the crime. Many of the games are either directly or loosely adapted from novels in the various series, while some others are new storylines created by the company.\nThe series is generally designed for PC. The earliest releases were solely compatible with Microsoft Windows while later releases are also compatible with Mac OS. Some of the games have been ported to other systems, such as the Nintendo Wii and Game Boy Advance, and one was released on Interactive DVD. The games are aimed at a family audience, with the suggestion of \"ages 10 and up\"; most of the games have the ESRB rating of E, though ' and ' are rated E10+. Lani Minella voiced the Nancy character for thirty-two games from Her Interactive from 1998 until 2015. After the release of \"\", the company announced that Minella would not be returning to the series. She was replaced with Brittany Cox beginning with the release of \"Midnight in Salem\" in 2019.\nThe games and company overall have received recognition throughout its history for being a pioneer in female gaming, and have been dubbed into several different languages internationally. Her Interactive has also released two adventure game/hidden object hybrid games ' (2008) and ' (2009) under the \"Nancy Drew Dossier\" series. The iOS game \"Nancy Drew: Codes &amp; Clues\" was released in May 2016, designed for younger audiences to develop skills in computer programming.\nIn addition to the games created by Her Interactive, Majesco Entertainment and Gorilla Systems Co. have released \"Nancy Drew: Deadly Secret of Olde World Park\" (2007) and \"Nancy Drew: The Mystery of the Clue Bender Society\" (2008) for the Nintendo DS. THQ has also released two games for the Nintendo DS, \"Nancy Drew: The Hidden Staircase\" (2008) and \"Nancy Drew: The Model Mysteries\" (2010).\nComics and graphic novels.\nPapercutz and Dynamite Entertainment had both published authorized \"Nancy Drew\" comics and graphic novels.\nList of \"Nancy Drew\" comics and graphic novels published by Papercutz\nThe Papercutz adaptations are no longer in print while Dynamite Entertainment released five \"Nancy Drew\" graphic novels, four of which are unique plots that crossover with \"The Hardy Boys\".\nList of \"Nancy Drew\" graphic novels published by Dynamite Entertainment\nMusicals.\nIn 2018, Jeremy Desmon and Jeff Thomson were commissioned to compose \"Nancy Drew: The Musical\", a planned theatrical reboot set in the future, depicting the eponymous sleuth as having married her boyfriend, Ned Nickerson, and having a family with him. Now a mother and a grandmother, the elderly Nancy Drew has been estranged from her daughter Diana Nickerson and granddaughter Nancy Nickerson. A chance to mend fences arises when all three generations of Drew women go on a cruise and solve a mystery together.\nIn 2023, it was announced that another musical adaptation titled \"Nancy Drew and the Mystery at Spotlight Manor\" is being made. The piece is set to feature original music composed by Alan Menken and Nell Benjamin, a book by Sarah Kernochan, with James Lapine directing.\nAs of 2025, there have been no further updates regarding the two planned \"Nancy Drew\" musicals.\nMerchandising.\nA number of Nancy Drew products have been licensed over the years, primarily in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s.\nDolls.\nIn 1967 Madame Alexander produced a Nancy Drew doll. The doll carried binoculars and camera and was available in two outfits: with a plaid coat or a dress and short jacket. Harriet Adams disapproved of the doll's design, believing Nancy's face to be too childish, but the doll was marketed nonetheless. Various Nancy Drew coloring, activity, and puzzle books have also been published, as has a Nancy Drew puzzle. A Nancy Drew Halloween costume and a Nancy Drew lunchbox were produced in the 1970s as television show tie-ins.\nBoard games.\nIn 1957, Parker Brothers released \"The Nancy Drew Mystery Game\", an authorized board game in which two to four players compete to locate the titular girl detective's current whereabouts as she investigates a case.\nAs of 2022, Canadian games manufacturer Outset Media, in partnership with Simon &amp; Schuster, had also released authorized \"Nancy Drew\" board games and jigsaw puzzles.\nA 1,000-piece jigsaw puzzle shows a gallery of \"Nancy Drew\" book covers when completed.\n\"Nancy Drew Collector\" is a card game set at a premiere auction of \"Nancy Drew\" novels. To play the game, two to four participants must answer \"Yes\" or \"No\" questions, each outbidding the others on their favourite \"Nancy Drew\" books.\n\"Nancy Drew Mysteries Board Game\" requires deduction skills and is played similarly to the British-made \"Cluedo\". With thirty-five possible solutions, the objective of the game is for three to six players to deduce the following:\nCultural impact.\nAccording to commentators, the cultural impact of Nancy Drew has been enormous. The immediate success of the series led directly to the creation of numerous other girls' mysteries series, such as The Dana Girls mystery stories and the Kay Tracey mystery stories, and the phenomenal sales of the character Edward Stratemeyer feared was \"too flip\" encouraged publishers to market many other girls' mystery series, such as the Judy Bolton Series, and to request authors of series such as the Cherry Ames Nurse Stories to incorporate mystery elements into their works. The \"Nancy Drew Mystery Stories\" series and other girls' series books faced criticism for the formulaic nature of their plots and the poor quality of the actual books.\nMany prominent and successful women cite Nancy Drew as an early formative influence whose character encouraged them to take on unconventional roles, including U.S. Supreme Court Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Sonia Sotomayor; TV personalities Oprah Winfrey and Barbara Walters; singers Barbra Streisand and Beverly Sills; mystery authors Sara Paretsky and Nancy Pickard; scholar Carolyn Heilbrun; actresses Ellen Barkin and Emma Roberts; former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton; former First Lady Laura Bush; and former president of the National Organization for Women Karen DeCrow. When the first Nancy Drew conference was held, at the University of Iowa, in 1993, conference organizers received a flood of calls from women who \"all had stories to tell about how instrumental Nancy had been in their lives, and about how she had inspired, comforted, entertained them through their childhoods, and, for a surprising number of women, well into adulthood.\"\nNancy Drew's popularity continues unabated: In 2002, the first Nancy Drew book published, \"The Secret of the Old Clock\", alone sold 150,000 copies, good enough for top-50 ranking in children's books, and other books in the series sold over 100,000 copies each. Sales of the hardcover volumes of the original Nancy Drew series alone has surpassed sales of Agatha Christie titles, and newer titles in the Girl Detective series have reached \"The New York Times\" bestseller lists. \"Entertainment Weekly\" ranked her seventeenth on its list of \"The Top 20 Heroes\" ahead of Batman, explaining that Drew is the \"first female hero embraced by most little girls... [Nancy lives] in an endless summer of never-ending adventures and unlimited potential.\" The magazine goes on to cite \"Scooby-Doo\"'s Velma Dinkley as well as Veronica Mars as Nancy Drew's \"copycat descendants\".\nMany feminist critics have pondered the reason for the character's iconic status. Nancy's car, and her skill in driving and repairing it, are often cited. Melanie Rehak points to Nancy's famous blue roadster (now a blue hybrid) as a symbol of \"ultimate freedom and independence\". Not only does Nancy have the freedom to go where she pleases (a freedom other, similar characters such as The Dana Girls do not have), but she is also able to change a tire and fix a flawed distributor, prompting Paretsky to argue that in \"a nation where car mechanics still mock or brush off complaints by women Nancy remains a significant role model.\"\nNancy is also treated with respect: her decisions are rarely questioned and she is trusted by those around her. Male authority figures believe her statements, and neither her father nor Hannah Gruen, the motherly housekeeper, \"place... restrictions on her comings and goings.\" Nancy's father not only imposes no restrictions on his daughter, but trusts her with both her own car and his gun (in the original version of \"The Hidden Staircase\" [1930]), asks her advice on a frequent basis, and accedes to all her requests. Some critics, such as Betsy Caprio and Ilana Nash, argue that Nancy's relationship with her continually approving father is satisfying to girl readers because it allows them to vicariously experience a fulfilled Electra complex.\nUnlike other girl detectives, Nancy does not go to school (for reasons that are never explained, but assuming because she has finished), and she thus has complete autonomy. Similar characters, such as Kay Tracey, do go to school, and not only lose a degree of independence but also of authority. The fact of a character's being a school-girl reminds \"the reader, however fleetingly, of the prosaic realities of high-school existence, which rarely includes high adventures or an authoritative voice in the world of adults.\"\nSome see in Nancy's adventures a mythic quality. Nancy often explores secret passages, prompting Nancy Pickard to argue that Nancy Drew is a figure equivalent to the ancient Sumerian deity Inanna and that Nancy's \"journeys into the 'underground'\" are, in psychological terms, explorations of the unconscious. Nancy is a heroic figure, undertaking her adventures not for the sake of adventure alone, but in order to help others, particularly the disadvantaged. For this reason, Nancy Drew has been called the modern embodiment of the character of \"Good Deeds\" in Everyman.\nIn the end, many critics agree that at least part of Nancy Drew's popularity depends on the way in which the books and the character combine sometimes contradictory values, with Kathleen Chamberlain writing in \"The Secrets of Nancy Drew\", \"For over 60 years, the Nancy Drew series has told readers that they can have the benefits of both dependence and independence without the drawbacks, that they can help the disadvantaged and remain successful capitalists, that they can be both elitist and democratic, that they can be both child and adult, and that they can be both 'liberated' women and Daddy's little girls.\" As another critic puts it, \"Nancy Drew 'solved' the contradiction of competing discourses about American womanhood by entertaining them all.\"\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She wrote some of the earliest Nancy Drew mysteries and created the detective's adventurous personality. Benson wrote under the Stratemeyer Syndicate pen name, Carolyn Keene, from 1929 to 1953 and contributed to 23 of the first 30 Nancy Drew mysteries, which were bestsellers.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEarly life.\nMildred Benson was born Mildred Augustine on July 10, 1905, in Ladora, Iowa, to Lillian and Dr. J. L. Augustine. Benson earned her degree in English from the University of Iowa in 1925 in just three years. She later returned to the university, and in 1927, became the first student there to earn a master's degree in journalism.\nWriting career.\nBenson began her career selling short stories to magazines such as \"St. Nicholas\" and \"Lutheran Young Folks\". During her college years, she worked at \"The Daily Iowan\" under editor George Gallup, and after receiving her undergraduate degree, for the society pages of the \"Clinton Herald\".\nIn addition to her work with the Stratemeyer Syndicate, Benson also wrote many other series both in her name and under other pseudonyms from the 1930s to the 1950s. She ultimately wrote under a dozen names and published more than 130 books. In 1930 and 1931, Benson wrote the Ruth Darrow series. Taking flying lessons and flying her own aircraft, Ruth wins a national cross-country race, lands on an aircraft carrier, helps the Forest Service in fighting forest fires, and alerts the Coast Guard of an immigrant-smuggling scheme. The series has been highlighted as unusual for its time, for both its generally authentic aeronautical lore, and the consistent and outspoken advocacy of women's abilities and mechanical competence.\nFrom 1939 to 1947, Benson wrote the Penny Parker books which were published under her own name. Parker was the daughter of a newspaper editor who sought to become a reporter herself, often becoming involved in mysteries and dangerous situations. Parker was modeled after both the Nancy Drew character and Benson herself, but also gave Benson creative control of the character and her stories that she did not have for the Nancy Drew series. Benson would later cite Parker as her favorite of the characters she wrote, and considered her to be \"a better Nancy Drew than Nancy is.\"\nBenson began working at the \"Toledo Blade\" in 1944, and continued there for 58 years. After the death of her second husband in 1959, Benson focused on journalism. In the 1990s, she began writing a weekly column for the \"Toledo Blade\" titled \"On the Go\". She continued this and writing obituaries full-time until a few months before her death.\nStratemeyer Syndicate.\nIn the spring of 1926, literary publisher Edward Stratemeyer wrote an ad looking for ghostwriters for the Stratemeyer Syndicate. Benson applied, mentioning that she had plans to move to New York City where Stratemeyer's offices were located. At his request, Benson sent Stratemeyer some of her work with which he was impressed. While vacationing, she met Stratemeyer in New York in July and was offered to undertake the Ruth Fielding series. Under the pseudonym of Alice B. Emerson, Benson wrote \"Ruth Fielding and Her Great Scenario\". Stratemeyer credited Benson's writing for reviving sales of the Fielding series.\nSyndicate ghostwriters took the outlines supplied by Stratemeyer and wrote the novel based from an outline sent to them. After her initial meeting with Stratemeyer, Benson never saw him again; the work was done through correspondence. As with all Syndicate ghostwriters, under the terms of her contract, Benson was paid a flat fee of $125 to $250 for each Stratemeyer-outlined text, the equivalent of three months' pay for a newspaper reporter at that time. Ghostwriters signed away all rights to their texts and any claim to the Syndicate pseudonym used. Writers were, however, permitted to reveal that they wrote for the Syndicate. The Syndicate protected their pseudonyms to preserve series continuity as contributors to the series came and went.\nIn 1929, Stratemeyer developed a new series of detective novels with Benson in mind as the ghostwriter. He initially titled the heroine \"Stella Strong\", though upon selling the series to Grosset &amp; Dunlap, they chose the alternative name \"Nan Drew\" and lengthened the name to Nancy Drew. While Stratemeyer supplied the outlines of the first four novels for Benson, she developed Nancy's spunky, plucky personality, and her daring, adventurous spirit. Benson sought to make the heroine an unusually liberated woman for her time. She later said about writing the initial books, \"I always knew the series would be successful. I just never expected it to be the blockbuster that it has been. I'm glad that I had that much influence on people.\"\nShortly after finishing work on \"The Mystery at Lilac Inn\", and only a few weeks after the launch of the series, Stratemeyer died. Under the terms of his will, all Syndicate ghostwriters, including Benson, were sent one-fifth of the equivalent of the royalties the Syndicate had received for each book series to which they had contributed. Stratemeyer's daughters, Harriet Adams and Edna Stratemeyer, initially attempted to sell the company as per his wishes, but were unable to find a buyer due to the Great Depression. They ultimately continued their father's work, and kept correspondence with Benson. Though Benson briefly quit the Nancy Drew series, she continued writing the Fielding books until the series was cancelled by its publisher in 1934. Upon returning to the Nancy Drew series in 1934, Adams and Stratemeyer were able to convince her to also write the Kay Tracey and Dana Girls series they had developed. The Dana Girls, which also used the Carolyn Keene pseudonym, had been written by The Hardy Boys ghostwriter Leslie McFarlane until he quit following the initial four books.\nBenson continued writing for the Syndicate until the early 1950s, when the Syndicate underwent management changes. Beginning in 1959, Adams began revising and updating the Nancy Drew books written by Benson. Adams also made changes to Nancy's personality that had been crafted by Benson, making her less assertive and spunky. In 1980, Grosset &amp; Dunlap called Benson as a witness during a lawsuit against the Syndicate for contracting new titles with their competitor Simon &amp; Schuster. Benson's testimony revealed her identity to the public as a contributor to the Nancy Drew mystery stories. After the death of her sister in 1973, Adams claimed she had written the series since her father's passing; she had received considerable publicity for this especially since both The Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew were adapted for television in the late 1970s. Since the revelation and subsequent research into Syndicate files, Benson has been acknowledged the creator of the original Nancy Drew along with Edward Stratemeyer. In 2001, Benson received a Special Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America for her contributions to the Nancy Drew series.\nBenson's favorite Nancy Drew story was \"The Hidden Staircase\", the second mystery in the series. Whenever asked, she would gladly autograph copies of the Nancy Drew books, but only the titles she actually wrote.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1928, she married Asa Wirt, a correspondent for the Associated Press. The couple had a daughter, Margaret \"Peggy\" Wirt, who was born in 1936. Asa Wirt died in 1947, following a long illness during which Mildred took care of him. In 1950, she married George A. Benson, her editor at the \"Toledo Blade\" newspaper. He died in 1959.\nBenson was also known as a great adventurer. She made numerous trips to Central America, witnessing archaeological excavations and visiting Mayan sites. After her second husband's death, Benson obtained her pilot's license, and continued flying for several years.\nBenson died in Toledo at the age of 96 on May 28, 2002.\nSelected bibliography.\nNon-series.\nAs Mildred A.

{"id": "54836", "revid": "194203", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54836", "title": "Maquis (World War II)", "text": "French resistance groups\nThe Maquis () were rural guerrilla bands of French and Belgian Resistance fighters, called \"maquisards\", during World War II. Initially, they were composed of young, mostly working-class men who had escaped into the mountains and forests to avoid conscription into Vichy France's (STO; 'Compulsory Work Service') which provided forced labor for Germany. To avoid capture and deportation to Germany, they became increasingly organized into active resistance groups.\nThey had an estimated to members in autumn of 1943 and approximately members in June 1944.\nMeaning.\nThe maquis made up one component of the mosaic of the resistance in France and Belgium. The maquis refers to the organization of bands of resistance guerrillas which emerged in rural France, mainly in the south. The maquis were emergent in 1943 and were also active in 1944.\nOriginally the word came from the kind of terrain in which the armed resistance groups hid, high ground in southeastern France covered with scrub growth called \"maquis\" (scrubland).\nThe term \"maquis\" signified both the group of fighters and their rural location. Members of those bands were called \"maquisards\". Their image was that of a committed and voluntary fighter, a , as opposed to the previous (lit.\u2009'refractory'; 'unmanageable'). The term became an honorific meaning \"armed resistance fighter\". The Maquis came to symbolize the French Resistance and was used to describe resistance groups that fought in France before the Allied invasion of Normandy in 1944. Once the Allies had secured a foothold in France, the government of Free France attempted to unite the separate groups of Maquis under the banner of the French Forces of the Interior (FFI).\nThe national denomination given to all Maquis forces during the war is , known as the \"FFI\"; in English, the French Forces of the Interior. This large corp of about 400,000 active members (in 1944) is divided in three major sections, corresponding to three political or professional inclinations:\nAll three groups were deemed \"terrorists\" by the Vichy regime of the French State and by German authorities and other neighbouring fascist regimes. Other (rare) local groups did not affiliate with these organisations.\nOperations.\nMost maquisards operated in the remote or mountainous areas of Brittany and southern France, especially in the Alps and in Limousin. They relied on guerrilla tactics to harass the (the Vichy militia) and German occupation troops. The Maquis also aided the escape of downed Allied airmen, Jews and others pursued by the Vichy and German authorities. Maquisards usually relied on some degree of sympathy or cooperation from the local populace. Most of the Maquis cells\u2014like the Maquis du Limousin or the Maquis du Vercors\u2014took names after the area they were operating in. The size of these cells varied from tens to thousands of men and women.\nIn March 1944, with the Allies gaining ascendancy, Maquis groups intensified their operations. In reaction to their weakening power, the occupiers and Vichy collaborationists began a terror campaign throughout France, enacted by German military units and the . This included reprisals by SS troops against civilians living in areas where the French resistance was active, such as the Oradour-sur-Glane, the Maill\u00e9 and the Tulle massacres. The Maquisards exacted their revenge, both at the time with reactive atrocities and later in the (lit.\u2009'savage purge': 'savage' or 'wild' intended to indicate it was undertaken before the rule of law was reestablished) that took place after the war's end.\nIn French Indochina, the local resistance fighting the Japanese since 1941 was backed up by a special forces airborne commando unit created by de Gaulle in 1943, and known as the Corps L\u00e9ger d'Intervention (CLI). They were supplied by airlifts of the British Force 136.\nPolitics.\nPolitically, the Maquis included right-wing nationalists, liberals, socialists, communists, and anarchists. Some Maquis bands that operated in southwest France were composed entirely of left-wing Spanish veterans of the Spanish Civil War. Spanish Civil War veteran Carlos Romero Gim\u00e9nez was a centrist republican operating from Bordeaux.\nAccording to Matthew Cobb, the Communist Maquis groups adopted more active and immediate guerrilla tactics to combat the Nazis, while the groups affiliated with De Gaulle were asked to wait for a larger attack later in the war. Thus, some maquis joined Communist groups simply to be part of a more active resistance movement and not because of their politics. Georges Guingouin was one of the most active Communist Maquis leaders.\nThe British Special Operations Executive (SOE) helped the Maquis who were affiliated with the Free French with supplies and agents, help which was not extended to the Communist Maquis groups. The American Office of Strategic Services (OSS) also began to send its own agents to France in cooperation with the SOE and the French BCRA agents, as part of Operation Jedburgh.\nThe Maquis had many different sub groups with their own objectives and political affiliations. In 1944, an OSS agent, Robert R. Kehoe, was embedded within a group of Maquis and described the organization as \"fractured\", observing that \"the various components were quite independent, with members loyal to their own leaders and to the political forces behind them\". Different ideologies within the subgroups created tensions that had to be put aside at times during the war but prosecuted those of the far right after. People like Georges Loustaunau-Lacau and Marie-Madeleine Fourcade, leaders of the French Resistance group Alliance, were both questioned about their loyalty during and after the war. This came as no surprise as both were from far-right political backgrounds, that didn\u2019t favor the dominant Gaullist narrative. Lacau suffered the most, all the way up to his death by being put in jail several times, and accused by communist colleagues of siding with the Germans, while Fourcade was able to suffer fewer accusations by switching to Gaullism.\nExamples of the independence of separate Maquis groups can be found all throughout France during the Second World War. For example, Maquis groups in Brittany often did not speak French and were focused on the expulsion of German forces from their region and not from France as a whole. As they did not operate like a normal resistance organization due to their lack of centralization, the Maquis would not be able to accomplish as much as the Allied nations had hoped.\nHistory.\nPrior to the inception of the Maquis, small resistance groups were created in the occupied and unoccupied zones of France. In northern and western France, movements like \"Organisation civile et militaire\", \"Lib\u00e9ration-Nord\", \"Ceux de la Lib\u00e9ration\", \"Ceux de la R\u00e9sistance\" survived through clandestine pamphlets or newspapers, to build up a solidarity of attitudes and disparate actions and to 'taunt the Germans' (). Some of these movements also began to hide weapons and plot sabotage. In the Zone Libre, movements were created as early as in the north and west but did not face decimating raids by the authorities, which allowed movements like \"Combat\", \"Lib\u00e9ration-Sud\" and \"Franc-Tireur\" to have a more expansive character.\nResistance groups in the occupied zone eventually became linked to Free French officials in London or the SOE, which undermined German-occupied Europe with specially trained agents. By May 1941, the northern movements, who specialized in sabotage and espionage and the southern movements, who focused on planning escape routes, developed the only major movement common to both, the \"Front National\". Resistance became closely linked with the effects of the occupation and Vichy legislation and as the working class became alienated \"resisters and people on the run could be harboured with a degree of safety\" in the rural areas of France, resistance had a role and justification in the lives of many people \"who had no ambition to hold a gun, or memorize a coded message, though as the occupation grew in its violence the pressure on the French people to defend themselves by force intensified, and the military nature of resistance came to predominate\".The connection between the Vichy government and armed resistance paved the way for the eventual formation of the Maquis.\nThe \"Service du travail obligatoire\" (STO; compulsory labor service) was enacted on 16 February 1943 but underwent various refinements and classifications. It required young men born between 1920 and 1922 to register at their (town halls), whereupon the authorities \"listed several categories of workers, divided them into those who were exempt, those who would be liable for compulsory service in Germany, and those who would have to work for German industries in France\". In the first few months, reports suggest that there were many who refused STO and went into hiding, mostly in areas where people hid Jews and resisters. These first few months of refusal of STO, and the \"embryonic camps and groupings that resulted\" contributed to the eventual emergence of the mystique and discourse of \"le maquis\".\nPolitically motivated anti-fascists, immigrant workers on the run, the and Spanish Civil War veterans, along with the leniency of the Vichy administration's pursuit of , contributed to the emergence of an aggressive movement, with a combative discourse and a romantic mystique of rural revolt. The speed with which the term \"maquis\" spread was astonishing, since the concept did not exist in January 1943. By June, talk of the \"maquis\" made its way from south-eastern France to the plains of northern France. The Maquis eventually became the national service, due to the large influx of young people in revolt against the STO. This unification was due, in part, to Michel Brault, a Parisian lawyer, who headed the organization of the resisters in April 1943, and to the drafted circulars establishing the Maquis's charter. Within one month, 20,000 copies of the text \u2014 which did not exceed the size of a playing card \u2014 were distributed throughout the southern zone\". Brault, in a report sent to London on 14 February 1944, listed the various elements available for action to the Allies and described the Maquis as \"youths who have rebelled against the STO as well as men of all ages who have given up trying to live a normal life[...]. They totalled about 48,000.\"\nRole.\nThe \"Maquis de l'Ain\", captained by Henri Petit (alias Romans), organized a network of camps in the dense forests in the mountainous regions of the \"Bugey\" and the lower regions of La Bresse, without creating a fixed camp. This gave &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;... primacy to isolation from all habitation, but also to sites which permitted hasty retreats. The enemy would not be able to surprise the Maquis because the views from the mountains were extensive, but some enjoyed this advantage and stayed in the same sites for months, defying their own rules of mobility. Guerrilla warfare practised by the Maquis \"created a psychosis of fear within the enemy [...], giving an impression of numbers and strength which was more illusory than real\". \nThe Maquis de l'Ain's effectiveness was honed at the training school they opened at Gorges above Mongriffon in June 1943. Captain Romans described the situation: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The watchwords were explicit: no large concentrations of men. No pitched battles. Guerrilla warfare only! We had a few revolvers and some hunting rifles and were reduced to making sketches in order to teach the use of modern weapons. Early in July we received our first Sten machine gun. We kept taking it apart and putting it together until we could do it in record time, Then the gun was passed from one camp to another.\nIn the control for rural areas, the maquisards, in their role as the hunted, \"gradually made the terrain of the hunt unpredictable for the hunters\", and eventually dangerous. The Maquis's goal was to destabilize Vichy authority, and they did this by simultaneously making themselves, as well as Vichy authorities, the 'hunters' and the 'hunted'.\nDuring the Allied invasion of Normandy, Operation Overlord, the Maquis and other groups played some role in delaying the German mobilization. The French Resistance (FFI for , 'French Forces of the Interior') blew up railroad tracks and repeatedly attacked German Army equipment and garrison trains on their way to the Atlantic coast. Coded messages transmitted over , broadcast from the BBC, alerted the Maquis of the impending D-Day with seemingly meaningless messages such as \"the crow will sing three times in the morning\" read in a continuous flow over the British airwaves. As Allied troops advanced, the French Resistance rose against the Nazi occupation forces and their garrisons en masse. For example, Nancy Wake's group of 7,000 maquisards was involved in a pitched battle with 22,000 Germans on 20 June 1944. Some Maquis groups took no prisoners so some German soldiers preferred to surrender to Allied soldiers rather than maquisards.\nThe Allied offensive was slowed and the Germans were able to counterattack in southeast France. On the Vercors Massif, the Maquis du Vercors rose up with some 4,000 soldiers against the German occupiers, but was defeated with 600 casualties.\nWhen General De Gaulle dismissed resistance organizations after the liberation of Paris, many maquisards returned to their homes though many also joined the new French army.\nEquipment.\nAlthough the Maquis used whatever arms they could get, the groups affiliated with the Free French relied heavily on airdrops of weapons and explosives from the SOE. The SOE parachuted agents in with wireless sets (for radio communication) and dropped containers with various munitions including Sten guns, pencil detonators, plastic explosives, Welrod pistols (a silenced specialized assassination weapon favored by covert operatives) and assorted small arms such as pistols, rifles and sub-machine guns. The Maquis would listen to coded broadcasts by the BBC the night before each supply drop. The information they would receive included the amount of supply boxes that would be dropped and when to light the fire signals that mark the drop zones. The Maquis had to confirm through radio if they received the message in order to lessen the risk of the supplies getting into German hands.\nThe Maquis also used German weapons captured throughout the occupation; the Mauser 98k rifle and MP 40 submachine gun were very common. The Milice, which was well equipped by Vichy France, was also a target of Maquis actions wherever available.\nCustoms.\nThe Maquis were clandestine groups which did not wear uniforms, so as to blend in the population. However, over time many started wearing the Basque beret because it was common enough not to arouse suspicion, but distinctive enough to be effective. \nIn leadership and the more technical aspects of leading a resistance group women were often more involved in the Maquis than men, helping the front line fighters. It was very common for young educated women to be used as couriers from one Maquis group to another. Young women were chosen because they were more inconspicuous than men and could often pass through German checkpoints without being stopped or questioned. Allied operatives working with the Maquis described the women of the Maquis helping of the fighters as \"the lifeblood of the resistance, furnishing information, passing instructions, and arranging for food and supplies.\"\nControversy.\nAfter the war, many individuals claimed membership in the Maquis to escape being labeled Nazi collaborators. Operations carried out by the Maquis were often inefficient and meant to grab attention, not destroy key military targets. Allied intelligence received reports that the Maquis would use explosives on targets that did not require them, to make their actions heard. Lack of centralization led to groups taking action to garner attention so that more members would join and they would receive more supplies from the Allied war effort. Some actions taken by these splintered groups were not always in favor of the larger war effort. Another controversy was their harsh punishment of German prisoners and French collaborators. In one instance recorded by an American OSS agent embedded in the Maquis, a group of fighters had captured three French men accused of collaborating with the Germans and giving them information about the Maquis location. The agent describes one man's punishment saying, \"he was tied up in public before he was subsequently beaten and shot.\" There are also reports of French Maquis units which executed German prisoners.\nReferences.\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\n its chapter: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "54837", "revid": "50588066", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54837", "title": "Stratemeyer Syndicate", "text": "Book packager in the US responsible for many young adult series\nThe Stratemeyer Syndicate was an American book packaging company that produced a number of book series for children, including Nancy Drew, The Hardy Boys, the various Tom Swift series, the Bobbsey Twins, the Rover Boys, and others. It contracted the many pseudonymous authors who wrote the series from 1899 to 1987, and arranged the publishing by firms such as Grosset &amp; Dunlap. In 1987 it was sold to Simon &amp; Schuster.\nHistory.\nCreated by Edward Stratemeyer, the Stratemeyer Syndicate was the first book packager to aim its books at children rather than adults. The Syndicate was wildly successful; at one time it was believed that the overwhelming majority of books children read in the United States were Stratemeyer Syndicate books, based on a 1922 study of over 36,000 American children.\nStratemeyer's business acumen was in realizing the huge, untapped market for children's books. The Stratemeyer Syndicate specialized in producing books meant primarily to be entertaining. In Stratemeyer's view, it was the thrill of feeling grown-up and the desire for a series of stories that made such reading attractive to children. Stratemeyer believed this desire could be harnessed for profit. He founded the Stratemeyer Syndicate to produce books in an efficient, assembly-line fashion and write them so as to maximize their popularity.\nThe first series that Stratemeyer created was \"The Rover Boys\", published under the pseudonym Arthur M. Winfield in 30 volumes between 1899 and 1926, which sold over five million copies. \"The Bobbsey Twins\" first appeared in 1904 under the pseudonym Laura Lee Hope, and \"Tom Swift\" in 1910 under the pseudonym Victor Appleton.\nStratemeyer published a number of books under his own name, but the books published under pseudonyms sold better. Stratemeyer realized that \"he could offer more books each year if he dealt with several publishers and had the books published under a number of pseudonyms which he controlled.\" Stratemeyer explained his strategy to a publisher, writing that \"[a] book brought out under another name would, I feel satisfied, do better than another Stratemeyer book. If this was brought out under my own name, the trade on new Stratemeyer books would simply be cut into four parts instead of three.\"\nSome time in the first decade of the twentieth century Stratemeyer realized he could no longer juggle multiple volumes of multiple series, and he began hiring ghostwriters, such as Mildred Benson, Josephine Lawrence, Howard R. Garis and Leslie McFarlane. Stratemeyer continued to write some books, while writing plot outlines for others.\nWhile mystery elements were occasionally present in these early series, the Syndicate later specialized in children's mystery series. This trend began in 1911, when Stratemeyer wrote and published \"The Mansion of Mystery\" under the pseudonym Chester K. Steele. Five more books were published in that mystery series, the last in 1928. These books were aimed at a somewhat older audience than his previous series. After that, the Syndicate focused on mystery series aimed at its younger base: \"The Hardy Boys\", which first appeared in 1927, ghostwritten by Leslie McFarlane and others; and \"Nancy Drew\", which first appeared in 1930, ghostwritten by Mildred Wirt Benson, Walter Karig, and others. Both series were immediate financial successes.\nIn 1930, Stratemeyer died, and the Syndicate was inherited by his two daughters, Harriet Stratemeyer Adams and Edna Stratemeyer Squier. Stratemeyer Squier sold her share to her sister Harriet within a few years. Adams introduced such series as \"The Dana Girls\" (1934), \"Tom Swift Jr.\", \"The Happy Hollisters\", and many others. In the 1950s, Adams began substantially revising old volumes in \"The Hardy Boys\" and \"Nancy Drew\" series, updating them to remove references to outdated cultural elements, such as \"roadster\". Racial slurs and stereotypes were also removed, and in some cases (such as \"The Secret at Shadow Ranch\" and \"The Mystery at the Moss-Covered Mansion)\" entire plots were cast off and replaced with new ones. In part, these changes were motivated by a desire to make the books more modern. Grosset &amp; Dunlap, the primary publisher of Stratemeyer Syndicate books, requested the books' racism be excised, a project Adams felt was unnecessary. Grosset &amp; Dunlap held firm; it had received an increasing number of letters from parents offended by stereotypes present in the books, particularly in \"The Hardy Boys\" publications.\nIn the late 1970s, Adams decided it was time for Nancy and the Hardys to go into paperback, as the hardcover market was no longer what it had been. Grosset &amp; Dunlap sued, citing \"breach of contract, copyright infringement, and unfair competition\". The ensuing case let the world know, for the first time, that the Syndicate existed; the Syndicate had always gone to great lengths to hide its existence from the public, and ghostwriters were contractually obliged never to reveal their authorship.\nGrosset &amp; Dunlap was awarded the rights to \"The Hardy Boys\" and \"Nancy Drew\" volumes that it had published, but the Syndicate was judged free to take subsequent volumes elsewhere. Subsequent volumes were published by Simon &amp; Schuster.\nAdams died in 1982. In 1984, Simon &amp; Schuster purchased the syndicate from its partners\u00a0\u2014 Edward Stratemeyer Adams, Camilla Adams McClave, Patricia Adams Harr, Nancy Axelrad, Lorraine Rickle, and Lilo Wuenn\u00a0\u2014 and turned to Mega-Books, a book packager, to handle the writing process for new volumes.\nWriting guidelines.\nAll Stratemeyer Syndicate books were written under certain guidelines, based on practices Stratemeyer began with his first series, the \"Rover Boys\".\nCriticism.\nFor decades, libraries refused to carry Syndicate books, considering them unworthy trash. Series books were considered to \"cause 'mental laziness,' induce a 'fatal sluggishness,' and 'intellectual torpor.'\" Series books were considered to ruin a child's chances for gaining an appreciation of good literature (which was subsequently shown by one study not to be the case), and to undermine respect for authority: \"Much of the contempt for social conventions\u00a0... is due to the reading of this poisonous sort of fiction.\"\nFranklin K. Mathiews, chief librarian for the Boy Scouts of America, wrote that series books were a method, according to the title of one of his articles, for \"Blowing Out the Boys' Brains\", and psychologist G. Stanley Hall articulated one of the most common concerns by asserting that series books would ruin girls in particular by giving them \"false views of [life] ... which will cloud her life with discontent in the future\".\nNone of this hurt sales and Stratemeyer was unperturbed, even when his books were banned from the Newark Public Library as early as 1901, writing to a publisher: \"Personally it does not matter much to me. ...\u00a0Taking them out of the Library has more than tripled the sales in Newark.\"\nForeign publications.\nSome syndicate series were also reprinted in foreign countries. An early foreign version was a Ted Scott Flying Stories book, published in Germany in 1930 as \"Ted Scott Der Ozeanflieger.\" The artwork was generally changed when reprinted in other countries, and sometimes character names and other details were as well. For example, in Norway, translations of the Nancy Drew books were first published in 1941, the first European market to introduce the girl detective. \u201cThe translators changed the color of Nancy's car, shortened the text, and made the language easier to read; but they made no substantive changes\u201d to the stories. By the 1970s, Nancy Drew stories had \u201cbeen translated into Spanish, Swedish, French, German, Dutch, Italian, Danish, Finnish, Norwegian, and Icelandic.\nOther series reprinted outside the States include \"The Dana Girls\", \"The Hardy Boys\" and the \"Bobbsey Twins\" (in Australia, France, Sweden, and the UK). These other series first appeared around the 1950s outside the United States.\nThe second Stratemeyer Syndicate series to be reprinted outside the United States appears to have been the first two books in the Don Sturdy series, although exact dates of printing are unknown. Those were \"The Desert of Mystery\" and \"The Big Snake Hunters\". There are two British versions known of the latter book; both were printed by The Children's Press, one in the 1930s and the second, with different cover art, in the 1950s.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nProject Gutenberg ebooks online.\nhttp://; \nhttps://;\nhttps://;\nhttps://;\nhttps://;\nhttp://;\nhttp://; \nhttps://;\nhttps://;\nhttp://; \nhttps://;\nhttps://;\nhttps://;\nhttp://;\nhttp://;\nhttp://;\nhttps://;\nhttp://\n&lt;br&gt;Not found 2023 as Gutenberg authors: Franklin W.

Biogas is produced by anaerobic digestion with anaerobic organisms or methanogens inside an anaerobic digester, biodigester or a bioreactor. The gas composition is primarily methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) and may have small amounts of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), moisture and siloxanes. The methane can be combusted or oxidized with oxygen. This energy release allows biogas to be used as a fuel; it can be used in fuel cells and for heating purpose, such as in cooking. It can also be used in a gas engine to convert the energy in the gas into electricity and heat.\nBiogas can be upgraded to natural gas quality specifications by stripping carbon dioxide and other contaminants. Biogas that has been upgraded to interchangeability with natural gas is called Renewable Natural Gas (RNG). RNG can be used a drop-in fuel in the gas grid or to produce compressed natural gas as a vehicle fuel.\nBiogas is considered to be a renewable resource. At a high level, biogas is a carbon neutral fuel in so far as emissions of carbon dioxide from its combustion are matched by carbon dioxide pulled from the atmosphere to produce biomass. In practice, the carbon intensity of biogas can vary depending on emissions from the production of biomass and the processes used to produce and upgrade biogas. In some applications, the capturing of biogas can avoid emissions of methane reducing overall emissions.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nProduction.\nBiogas is produced by microorganisms, such as methanogens and sulfate-reducing bacteria, performing anaerobic respiration. Biogas can refer to gas produced naturally and industrially.\nNatural.\nIn soil, methane is produced in anaerobic environments by methanogens, but is mostly consumed in aerobic zones by methanotrophs. Methane emissions result when the balance favors methanogens. Wetland soils are the main natural source of methane. Other sources include oceans, forest soils, termites, and wild ruminants.\nIndustrial.\nAnaerobic digestion is a sequence of processes by which microorganisms break down biodegradable material in the absence of oxygen. This process produces biogas which can be used as a fuel. Industrial biogas production can either be purpose-built such as anaerobic digesters built to process manure and organic waste or can harvest biogas produced as byproduct from landfills or wastewater treatment plants.\nBiogas plants.\nA \"biogas plant\" is the name often given to an anaerobic digester that treats farm wastes, municipal organic waste and/or energy crops. Industrial biogas plants process organic material in an air-tight tank to create anaerobic conditions. The material is heated to either mesothermic (~38oC) or thermophilic (&gt;55oC) and held for a typical retention time of two to thirty days.\nThese plants can be fed with energy crops such as maize silage or biodegradable wastes including sewage sludge and food waste. During the process, the micro-organisms transform biomass waste into biogas and digestate. Higher quantities of biogas can be produced when the wastewater is co-digested with other residuals from the dairy industry, sugar industry, or brewery industry. For example, while mixing 90% of wastewater from beer factory with 10% cow whey, the production of biogas was increased by 2.5 times compared to the biogas produced by wastewater from the brewery only.\nLandfill gas.\nLandfill gas is produced by wet organic waste decomposing under anaerobic conditions in a similar way to biogas.\nThe waste is covered and mechanically compressed by the weight of the material that is deposited above. This material prevents oxygen exposure thus allowing anaerobic microbes to thrive. Biogas builds up and is slowly released into the atmosphere if the site has not been engineered to capture the gas. Landfill gas released in an uncontrolled way can be hazardous since it can become explosive when it escapes from the landfill and mixes with oxygen. The lower explosive limit is 5% methane and the upper is 15% methane.\nThe methane in biogas is 28 times more potent a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. Therefore, uncontained landfill gas, which escapes into the atmosphere may significantly contribute to the effects of global warming. In addition, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in landfill gas contribute to the formation of photochemical smog.\nDangers.\nThe air pollution produced by biogas is similar to that of natural gas as when methane (a major constituent of biogas) is ignited for its usage as an energy source, Carbon dioxide is made as a product which is a greenhouse gas ( as described by this equation: + 2 \u2192 CO2 + 2 ). The content of toxic hydrogen sulfide presents additional risks and has been responsible for serious accidents. Leaks of unburned methane are an additional risk, because methane is a potent greenhouse gas. A facility may leak 2% of the methane.\nBiogas can be explosive when mixed in the ratio of one part biogas to 8\u201320 parts air. Special safety precautions have to be taken for entering an empty biogas digester for maintenance work. It is important that a biogas system never has negative pressure as this could cause an explosion. Negative gas pressure can occur if too much gas is removed or leaked; Because of this biogas should not be used at pressures below one column inch of water, measured by a pressure gauge.\nFrequent smell checks must be performed on a biogas system. If biogas is smelled anywhere windows and doors should be opened immediately. If there is a fire the gas should be shut off at the gate valve of the biogas system.\nComposition.\nThe composition of biogas varies depending upon the substrate composition, as well as the conditions within the anaerobic reactor (temperature, pH, and substrate concentration). Landfill gas typically has methane concentrations around 50%. Advanced waste treatment technologies can produce biogas with 55\u201375% methane, which for reactors with free liquids can be increased to 80\u201390% methane using in-situ gas purification techniques. As produced, biogas contains water vapor. The fractional volume of water vapor is a function of biogas temperature; correction of measured gas volume for water vapour content and thermal expansion is easily done via simple mathematics which yields the standardized volume of dry biogas.\nFor 1000\u00a0kg (wet weight) of input to a typical biodigester, total solids may be 30% of the wet weight while volatile suspended solids may be 90% of the total solids. Protein would be 20% of the volatile solids, carbohydrates would be 70% of the volatile solids, and finally fats would be 10% of the volatile solids.\nBiochemical oxygen demand (BOD) is a measure of the amount of oxygen required by aerobic micro-organisms to decompose the organic matter in a sample of material being used in the biodigester as well as the BOD for the liquid discharge allows for the calculation of the daily energy output from a biodigester.\nContaminants.\nSulfur compounds.\nToxic, corrosive and foul smelling hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is the most common contaminant in biogas. If not separated, combustion will produce sulfur dioxide (SO2) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4), which are corrosive and environmentally hazardous., Other sulfur-containing compounds, such as thiols may be present.\nAmmonia.\nAmmonia (NH3) is produced from organic compounds containing nitrogen, such as the amino acids in proteins. If not separated from the biogas, combustion results in NOx emissions.\nSiloxanes.\nIn some cases, biogas contains siloxanes. They are formed from the anaerobic decomposition of materials commonly found in soaps and detergents. During combustion of biogas containing siloxanes, silicon is released and can combine with free oxygen or other elements in the combustion gas. Deposits are formed containing mostly silica (SiO2) or silicates (Si\"x\"O\"y\") and can contain calcium, sulfur, zinc, phosphorus. Such \"white mineral\" deposits accumulate to a surface thickness of several millimeters and must be removed by chemical or mechanical means.\nDebate.\nArguments in favor.\nHigh levels of methane are produced when manure is stored under anaerobic conditions. During storage and when manure has been applied to the land, nitrous oxide is also produced as a byproduct of the denitrification process. Nitrous oxide (N2O) is 273 times more aggressive as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide and methane 27 times more than carbon dioxide.\nBy converting cow manure into methane biogas via anaerobic digestion, the millions of cattle in the United States would be able to produce 100 billion kilowatt hours of electricity, enough to power millions of homes across the United States. One cow can produce enough manure in one day to generate 3 kilowatt hours of electricity. Furthermore, by converting cattle manure into methane biogas instead of letting it decompose, global warming gases could be reduced by 99 million metric tons or 4%.\nArguments against.\nOthers environmental groups have argued that manure based biogases are a form of greenwashing. They argue it encourages and subsidies the use of concentrated animal feeding operations and emits other pollutants such as hydrogen sulfide. In 2022, 6 US senators including Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren argued biogas would not be able to succeed without taxpayer dollars and that those would be better used on other methods. They also argued that they may accelerate consolidation in the industry and see farms expand their size specifically to be large enough to receive biogas subsidies. They point to evidence farmers did this following California's rollout of biogas incentive programs. Others have argued the level of funding to biogas is already particularly outsized. For instance, in Wisconsin, just two years (2022\u20132023) of spending on biogas has been higher than 12 years of spending on solar energy.\nManufacturing of biogas from intentionally planted maize has been described as being unsustainable and harmful due to very concentrated, intense and soil eroding character of these plantations.\nApplications.\nBiogas can be used for electricity production on sewage works, in a CHP gas engine, where the waste heat from the engine is conveniently used for heating the digester; cooking; space heating; water heating; and process heating. If compressed, it can replace compressed natural gas for use in vehicles, where it can fuel an internal combustion engine or fuel cells and is a much more effective displacer of carbon dioxide than the normal use in on-site CHP plants.\nBiogas upgrading.\nRaw biogas produced from digestion is roughly 60% methane and 39% CO2 with trace elements of H2S: inadequate for use in machinery. The corrosive nature of H2S alone is enough to destroy the mechanisms.\nMethane in biogas can be concentrated via a biogas upgrader to the same standards as fossil natural gas, which itself has to go through a cleaning process, and becomes \"biomethane\". If the local gas network allows, the producer of the biogas may use their distribution networks. Gas must be very clean to reach pipeline quality and must be of the correct composition for the distribution network to accept. Carbon dioxide, water, hydrogen sulfide, and particulates must be removed if present.\nThere are four main methods of upgrading: water washing, pressure swing absorption, selexol absorption, and amine gas treating. In addition to these, the use of membrane separation technology for biogas upgrading is increasing, and there are already several plants operating in Europe and USA.\nThe most prevalent method is water washing where high pressure gas flows into a column where the carbon dioxide and other trace elements are scrubbed by cascading water running counter-flow to the gas. This arrangement could deliver 98% methane with manufacturers guaranteeing maximum 2% methane loss in the system. It takes roughly between 3% and 6% of the total energy output in gas to run a biogas upgrading system.\nBiogas gas-grid injection.\nGas-grid injection is the injection of biogas into the methane grid (natural gas grid) is possible if biogas is upgraded to biomethane. Until the breakthrough of micro combined heat and power two-thirds of all the energy produced by biogas power plants was lost (as heat). Using the grid to transport the gas to consumers, the energy can be used for on-site generation, resulting in a reduction of losses in the transportation of energy. Typical energy losses in natural gas transmission systems range from 1% to 2%; in electricity transmission they range from 5% to 8%.\nBefore being injected in the gas grid, biogas passes a cleaning process, during which it is upgraded to natural gas quality. During the cleaning process trace components harmful to the gas grid and the final users are removed.\nBiogas in transport.\nIf concentrated and compressed, it can be used in vehicle transportation. Compressed biogas is becoming widely used in Sweden, Switzerland, and Germany. A biogas-powered train, named Biogast\u00e5get Amanda (The Biogas Train Amanda), has been in service in Sweden since 2005. Biogas powers automobiles. In 1974, a British documentary film titled \"Sweet as a Nut\" detailed the biogas production process from pig manure and showed how it fueled a custom-adapted combustion engine. In 2007, an estimated 12,000 vehicles were being fueled with upgraded biogas worldwide, mostly in Europe.\nBiogas is part of the wet gas and condensing gas (or air) category that includes mist or fog in the gas stream. The mist or fog is predominately water vapor that condenses on the sides of pipes or stacks throughout the gas flow. Biogas environments include wastewater digesters, landfills, and animal feeding operations (covered livestock lagoons).\nUltrasonic flow meters are one of the few devices capable of measuring in a biogas atmosphere. Most of thermal flow meters are unable to provide reliable data because the moisture causes steady high flow readings and continuous flow spiking, although there are single-point insertion thermal mass flow meters capable of accurately monitoring biogas flows with minimal pressure drop. They can handle moisture variations that occur in the flow stream because of daily and seasonal temperature fluctuations, and account for the moisture in the flow stream to produce a dry gas value.\nBiogas generated heat/electricity.\nBiogas can be used in different types of internal combustion engines, such as the Jenbacher or Caterpillar gas engines. Other internal combustion engines such as gas turbines are suitable for the conversion of biogas into both electricity and heat. The digestate is the remaining inorganic matter that was not transformed into biogas. It can be used as an agricultural fertiliser.\nBiogas can be used as the fuel in the system of producing biogas from agricultural wastes and co-generating heat and electricity in a combined heat and power (CHP) plant. Unlike the other green energy such as wind and solar, the biogas can be quickly accessed on demand. The global warming potential can also be greatly reduced when using biogas as the fuel instead of fossil fuel.\nHowever, the acidification and eutrophication potentials produced by biogas are 25 and 12 times higher respectively than fossil fuel alternatives. This impact can be reduced by using correct combination of feedstocks, covered storage for digesters and improved techniques for retrieving escaped material. Overall, the results still suggest that using biogas can lead to significant reduction in most impacts compared to fossil fuel alternative. The balance between environmental damage and green house gas emission should still be considered while implicating the system.\nTechnological advancements.\nProjects such as NANOCLEAN are nowadays developing new ways to produce biogas more efficiently, using iron oxide nanoparticles in the processes of organic waste treatment. This process can triple the production of biogas.\nWastewater Treatment.\nFaecal Sludge is a product of onsite sanitation systems. Post collection and transportation, Faecal sludge can be treated with sewage in a conventional treatment plant, or otherwise it can be treated independently in a faecal sludge treatment plant. Faecal sludge can also be co-treated with organic solid waste in composting or in an anaerobic digestion system. Biogas can be generated through anaerobic digestion in the treatment of faecal sludge.\nThe appropriate management of excreta and its valorisation through the production of biogas from faecal sludge helps mitigate the effects of poorly managed excreta such as waterborne diseases and water and environmental pollution.\nThe Resource Recovery and Reuse is a subprogram of the CGIAR Research Program on Water, Land and Ecosystems dedicated to applied research on the safe recovery of water, nutrients and energy from domestic and agro-industrial waste streams. They believe using waste as energy would be good financially and would tackle sanitation, health and environmental issues.\nLegislation.\nEuropean Union.\nThe European Union has legislation regarding waste management and landfill sites called the Landfill Directive.\nCountries such as the United Kingdom and Germany now have legislation in force that provides farmers with long-term revenue and energy security.\nThe EU mandates that internal combustion engines with biogas have ample gas pressure to optimize combustion, and within the European Union ATEX centrifugal fan units built in accordance with the European directive 2014\u201334/EU (previously 94/9/EG) are obligatory. These centrifugal fan units, for example Combimac, Meidinger AG or Witt &amp; Sohn AG are suitable for use in Zone 1 and 2 .\nUnited States.\nThe United States legislates against landfill gas as it contains VOCs. The United States Clean Air Act and Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) requires landfill owners to estimate the quantity of non-methane organic compounds (NMOCs) emitted. If the estimated NMOC emissions exceeds 50 tonnes per year, the landfill owner is required to collect the gas and treat it to remove the entrained NMOCs. That usually means burning it.\nBecause of the remoteness of landfill sites, it is sometimes not economically feasible to produce electricity from the gas.\nThere are a variety of grants and loans the support the development of anaerobic digestor systems. The Rural Energy for American Program provides loan financing and grant funding for biogas systems, as does the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, Conservation Stewardship Program, and Conservation Loan Program.\nGlobal developments.\nUnited States.\nWith the many benefits of biogas, it is starting to become a popular source of energy and is starting to be used in the United States more. In 2003, the United States consumed of energy from \"landfill gas\", about 0.6% of the total U.S. natural gas consumption. Methane biogas derived from cow manure is being tested in the U.S. According to a 2008 study, collected by the \"Science and Children\" magazine, methane biogas from cow manure would be sufficient to produce 100 billion kilowatt hours enough to power millions of homes across America. Furthermore, methane biogas has been tested to prove that it can reduce 99 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions or about 4% of the greenhouse gases produced by the United States.\nThe number of farm-based digesters increased by 21% in 2021 according to the American Biogas Council. In Vermont biogas generated on dairy farms was included in the CVPS Cow Power program. The program was originally offered by Central Vermont Public Service Corporation as a voluntary tariff and now with a recent merger with Green Mountain Power is now the GMP Cow Power Program. Customers can elect to pay a premium on their electric bill, and that premium is passed directly to the farms in the program. In Sheldon, Vermont, Green Mountain Dairy has provided renewable energy as part of the Cow Power program. It started when the brothers who own the farm, Bill and Brian Rowell, wanted to address some of the manure management challenges faced by dairy farms, including manure odor, and nutrient availability for the crops they need to grow to feed the animals. They installed an anaerobic digester to process the cow and milking center waste from their 950 cows to produce renewable energy, a bedding to replace sawdust, and a plant-friendly fertilizer. The energy and environmental attributes are sold to the GMP Cow Power program. On average, the system run by the Rowells produces enough electricity to power 300 to 350 other homes. The generator capacity is about 300 kilowatts.\nIn Hereford, Texas, cow manure is being used to power an ethanol power plant. By switching to methane biogas, the ethanol power plant has saved 1000 barrels of oil a day. Over all, the power plant has reduced transportation costs and will be opening many more jobs for future power plants that will rely on biogas.\nIn Oakley, Kansas, an ethanol plant considered to be one of the largest biogas facilities in North America is using integrated manure utilization system to produce heat for its boilers by utilizing feedlot manure, municipal organics and ethanol plant waste. At full capacity the plant is expected to replace 90% of the fossil fuel used in the manufacturing process of ethanol and methanol.\nIn California, the Southern California Gas Company has advocated for mixing biogas into existing natural gas pipelines. However, California state officials have taken the position that biogas is \"better used in hard-to-electrify sectors of the economy-- like aviation, heavy industry and long-haul trucking\".\nEurope.\nThe level of development varies greatly in Europe. While countries such as Germany, Austria, Sweden and Italy are fairly advanced in their use of biogas, there is a vast potential for this renewable energy source in the rest of the continent, especially in Eastern Europe. MT-Energie is a German biogas technology company operating in the field of renewable energies. Different legal frameworks, education schemes and the availability of technology are among the prime reasons behind this untapped potential. Another challenge for the further progression of biogas has been negative public perception.\nIn February 2009, the European Biogas Association (EBA) was founded in Brussels as a non-profit organisation to promote the deployment of sustainable biogas production and use in Europe. EBA's strategy defines three priorities: establish biogas as an important part of Europe's energy mix, promote source separation of household waste to increase the gas potential, and support the production of biomethane as vehicle fuel. In July 2013, it had 60 members from 24 countries across Europe.\nUK.\nAs of September 2013[ [update]], there are about 130 non-sewage biogas plants in the UK. Most are on-farm, and some larger facilities exist off-farm, which are taking food and consumer wastes.\nOn 5 October 2010, biogas was injected into the UK gas grid for the first time. Sewage from over 30,000 Oxfordshire homes is sent to Didcot sewage treatment works, where it is treated in an anaerobic digestor to produce biogas, which is then cleaned to provide gas for approximately 200 homes.\nIn 2015 the Green-Energy company Ecotricity announced their plans to build three grid-injecting digesters.\nItaly.\nIn Italy the biogas industry first started in 2008, thanks to the introduction of advantageous feed tariffs. They were later replaced by feed-in premiums and the preference was given to by products and farming waste and leading to stagnation in biogas production and derived heat and electricity since 2012.As of September 2018[ [update]], in Italy there are more than 200 biogas plants with a production of about 1.2\u00a0GW\nGermany.\nGermany is Europe's biggest biogas producer and the market leader in biogas technology. In 2010 there were 5,905 biogas plants operating throughout the country: Lower Saxony, Bavaria, and the eastern federal states are the main regions. Most of these plants are employed as power plants. Usually the biogas plants are directly connected with a CHP which produces electric power by burning the bio methane. The electrical power is then fed into the public power grid. In 2010, the total installed electrical capacity of these power plants was 2,291\u00a0MW. The electricity supply was approximately 12.8\u00a0TWh, which is 12.6% of the total generated renewable electricity.\nBiogas in Germany is primarily extracted by the co-fermentation of energy crops (called 'NawaRo', an abbreviation of \"nachwachsende Rohstoffe\", German for renewable resources) mixed with manure. The main crop used is corn. Organic waste and industrial and agricultural residues such as waste from the food industry are also used for biogas generation. In this respect, biogas production in Germany differs significantly from the UK, where biogas generated from landfill sites is most common.\nBiogas production in Germany has developed rapidly over the last 20 years. The main reason is the legally created frameworks. Government support of renewable energy started in 1991 with the Electricity Feed-in Act (\"StrEG\"). This law guaranteed the producers of energy from renewable sources the feed into the public power grid, thus the power companies were forced to take all produced energy from independent private producers of green energy. In 2000 the Electricity Feed-in Act was replaced by the Renewable Energy Sources Act (\"EEG\"). This law even guaranteed a fixed compensation for the produced electric power over 20 years. The amount of around 8\u00a2/kWh gave farmers the opportunity to become energy suppliers and gain a further source of income.\nThe German agricultural biogas production was given a further push in 2004 by implementing the so-called NawaRo-Bonus. This is a special payment given for the use of renewable resources, that is, energy crops. In 2007 the German government stressed its intention to invest further effort and support in improving the renewable energy supply to provide an answer on growing climate challenges and increasing oil prices by the 'Integrated Climate and Energy Programme'.\nThis continual trend of renewable energy promotion induces a number of challenges facing the management and organisation of renewable energy supply that has also several impacts on the biogas production. The first challenge to be noticed is the high area-consuming of the biogas electric power supply. In 2011 energy crops for biogas production consumed an area of circa 800,000 ha in Germany. This high demand of agricultural areas generates new competitions with the food industries that did not exist hitherto. Moreover, new industries and markets were created in predominately rural regions entailing different new players with an economic, political and civil background. Their influence and acting has to be governed to gain all advantages this new source of energy is offering. Finally biogas will furthermore play an important role in the German renewable energy supply if good governance is focused.\nDeveloping countries.\nDomestic biogas plants convert livestock manure and night soil into biogas and slurry, the fermented manure. This technology is feasible for small-holders with livestock producing 50\u00a0kg manure per day, an equivalent of about 6 pigs or 3 cows. This manure has to be collectable to mix it with water and feed it into the plant. Toilets can be connected. Another precondition is the temperature that affects the fermentation process. With an optimum at 36\u00a0\u00b0C the technology especially applies for those living in a (sub) tropical climate. This makes the technology for small holders in developing countries often suitable.\nDepending on size and location, a typical brick made fixed dome biogas plant can be installed at the yard of a rural household with the investment between US$300 to $500 in Asian countries and up to $1400 in the African context. A high quality biogas plant needs minimum maintenance costs and can produce gas for at least 15\u201320 years without major problems and re-investments. For the user, biogas provides clean cooking energy, reduces indoor air pollution, and reduces the time needed for traditional biomass collection, especially for women and children. The slurry is a clean organic fertilizer that potentially increases agricultural productivity. In developing countries, it was also determined that the use of biogas leads to a 20% reduction in GHG emissions compared with GHG emissions due to firewood. Moreover, GHG emissions of 384.1\u00a0kg CO2 equivalent per year per animal could be prevented.\nEnergy is an important part of modern society and can serve as one of the most important indicators of socio-economic development. As much as there have been advancements in technology, even so, some three billion people, primarily in the rural areas of developing countries, continue to access their energy needs for cooking through traditional means by burning biomass resources like firewood, crop residues and animal dung in crude traditional stoves.\nDomestic biogas technology is a proven and established technology in many parts of the world, especially Asia. Several countries in this region have embarked on large-scale programmes on domestic biogas, such as China and India.\nThe Netherlands Development Organisation, SNV, supports national programmes on domestic biogas that aim to establish commercial-viable domestic biogas sectors in which local companies market, install and service biogas plants for households. In Asia, SNV is working in Nepal, Vietnam, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, Lao PDR, Pakistan and Indonesia, and in Africa; Rwanda, Senegal, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya, Benin and Cameroon.\nIn South Africa a prebuilt Biogas system is manufactured and sold. One key feature is that installation requires less skill and is quicker to install as the digester tank is premade plastic.\nIndia.\nBiogas in India has been traditionally based on dairy manure as feed stock and these \"gobar\" gas plants have been in operation for a long period of time, especially in rural India. In the last 2\u20133 decades, research organisations with a focus on rural energy security have enhanced the design of the systems resulting in newer efficient low cost designs such as the Deenabandhu model.\nThe Deenabandhu Model is a new biogas-production model popular in India. (\"Deenabandhu\" means \"friend of the helpless\".) The unit usually has a capacity of 2 to 3 cubic metres. It is constructed using bricks or by a ferrocement mixture. In India, the brick model costs slightly more than the ferrocement model; however, India's Ministry of New and Renewable Energy offers some subsidy per model constructed.\nBiogas which is mainly methane/natural gas can also be used for generating protein rich cattle, poultry and fish feed in villages economically by cultivating \"Methylococcus capsulatus\" bacteria culture with tiny land and water foot print. The carbon dioxide gas produced as by product from these plants can be put to use in cheaper production of algae oil or spirulina from algaculture particularly in tropical countries like India which can displace the prime position of crude oil in near future. Union government of India is implementing many schemes to utilise productively the agro waste or biomass in rural areas to uplift rural economy and job potential. With these plants, the non-edible biomass or waste of edible biomass is converted in to high value products without any water pollution or green house gas (GHG) emissions.\nLPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) is a key source of cooking fuel in urban India and its prices have been increasing along with the global fuel prices. Also the heavy subsidies provided by the successive governments in promoting LPG as a domestic cooking fuel has become a financial burden renewing the focus on biogas as a cooking fuel alternative in urban establishments. This has led to the development of prefabricated digester for modular deployments as compared to RCC and cement structures which take a longer duration to construct. Renewed focus on process technology like the Biourja process model has enhanced the stature of medium and large scale anaerobic digester in India as a potential alternative to LPG as primary cooking fuel.\nIn India, Nepal, Pakistan and Bangladesh biogas produced from the anaerobic digestion of manure in small-scale digestion facilities is called gobar gas; it is estimated that such facilities exist in over 2 million households in India, 50,000 in Bangladesh and thousands in Pakistan, particularly North Punjab, due to the thriving population of livestock. The digester is an airtight circular pit made of concrete with a pipe connection. The manure is directed to the pit, usually straight from the cattle shed. The pit is filled with a required quantity of wastewater. The gas pipe is connected to the kitchen fireplace through control valves. The combustion of this biogas has very little odour or smoke. Owing to simplicity in implementation and use of cheap raw materials in villages, it is one of the most environmentally sound energy sources for rural needs. One type of these system is the Sintex Digester. Some designs use vermiculture to further enhance the slurry produced by the biogas plant for use as compost.\nIn Pakistan, the Rural Support Programmes Network is running the Pakistan Domestic Biogas Programme which has installed 5,360 biogas plants and has trained in excess of 200 masons on the technology and aims to develop the Biogas Sector in Pakistan.\nIn Nepal, the government provides subsidies to build biogas plant at home.\nChina.\nAs of at least 2023, China is both the world's largest producer and largest consumer of household biogas.172\nThe Chinese have experimented with the applications of biogas since 1958. Around 1970, China had installed 6,000,000 digesters in an effort to make agriculture more efficient. During the last few years, technology has met high growth rates. This seems to be the earliest developments in generating biogas from agricultural waste.\nThe rural biogas construction in China has shown an increased development trend. The exponential growth of energy supply caused by rapid economic development and severe haze condition in China have led biogas to become the better eco-friendly energy for the rural areas. In Qing county, Hebei Province, the technology of using crop straw as a main material to generate biogas is currently developing.\nChina had 26.5 million biogas plants, with an output of 10.5 billion cubic meter biogas until 2007. The annual biogas output has increased to 248 billion cubic meter in 2010. The Chinese government had supported and funded rural biogas projects. As of 2023, more than 30 million rural Chinese households use biogas digesters.172\nDuring the winter, the biogas production in northern regions of China is lower. This is caused by the lack of heat control technology for digesters thus the co-digestion of different feedstock failed to complete in the cold environment.\nZambia.\nLusaka, the capital city of Zambia, has two million inhabitants with over half of the population residing in peri-urban areas. The majority of this population use pit latrines as toilets generating approximately 22,680 tons of fecal sludge per annum. This sludge is inadequately managed: Over 60% of the generated faecal sludge remains within the residential environment thereby compromising both the environment and public health.\nIn the face of research work and implementation of biogas having started as early as in the 1980s, Zambia is lagging behind in the adoption and use of biogas in the sub-Saharan Africa. Animal manure and crop residues are required for the provision of energy for cooking and lighting. Inadequate funding, absence of policy, regulatory framework and strategies on biogas, unfavorable investor monetary policy, inadequate expertise, lack of awareness of the benefits of biogas technology among leaders, financial institutions and locals, resistance to change due cultural and traditions of the locals, high installation and maintenance costs of biogas digesters, inadequate research and development, improper management and lack of monitoring of installed digesters, complexity of the carbon market, lack of incentives and social equity are among the challenges that have impeded the acquiring and sustainable implementation of domestic biogas production in Zambia.\nSociety and culture.\nIn the 1985 Australian film \"Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome\" the post-apocalyptic settlement Barter town is powered by a central biogas system based upon a piggery. As well as providing electricity, methane is used to power Barter's vehicles.\n\"Cow Town\", written in the early 1940s, discusses the travails of a city vastly built on cow manure and the hardships brought upon by the resulting methane biogas. Carter McCormick, an engineer from a town outside the city, is sent in to figure out a way to utilize this gas to help power, rather than suffocate the city.\nContemporary biogas production provides new opportunities for skilled employment, drawing on the development of new technologies.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}
{"id": "54840", "revid": "20483999", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54840", "title": "Eutrophication", "text": "Phenomenon where nutrients accumulate in water bodies\nEutrophication is a general term describing a process in which nutrients accumulate in a body of water, resulting in an increased growth of organisms that may deplete the oxygen in the water; ie. the process of too many plants growing on the surface of a river, lake, etc., often because chemicals that are used to help crops grow have been carried there by rain. Eutrophication may occur naturally or as a result of human actions. Manmade, or cultural, eutrophication occurs when sewage, industrial wastewater, fertilizer runoff, and other nutrient sources are released into the environment. Such nutrient pollution usually causes algal blooms and bacterial growth, resulting in the depletion of dissolved oxygen in water and causing substantial environmental degradation. Many policies have been introduced to combat eutrophication, including the United Nations Development Program (UNDP)'s sustainability development goals.\nApproaches for prevention and reversal of eutrophication include minimizing point source pollution from sewage and agriculture as well as other nonpoint pollution sources. Additionally, the introduction of bacteria and algae-inhibiting organisms such as shellfish and seaweed can also help reduce nitrogen pollution, which in turn controls the growth of cyanobacteria, the main source of harmful algae blooms.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistory and terminology.\nThe term \"eutrophication\" comes from the Greek \"eutrophos\", meaning \"well-nourished\". because the waterway has had an excessive amount of nutrients for the growth of algae and other organisms that it eventually strangulates the oxygen out of the water. \nThis overgrowth ultimately makes the water brackish as the organisms that once throve in it, now die in what is basically a mass extinction of all life within that area leaving behind it \"dead zones\" i.e. non-oxygenated water. As these pockets grow, they destroy more and more life until eventually they reach an area that enough oxygen to deter their advance. The problem is that aquatic life does not know where eutrophic water starts and can swim into and immediately die.\nWater bodies with very low nutrient levels are termed oligotrophic and those with moderate nutrient levels are termed mesotrophic. Advanced eutrophication may also be referred to as dystrophic and hypertrophic conditions. Thus, eutrophication has been defined as \"degradation of water quality owing to enrichment by nutrients which results in excessive plant (principally algae) growth and decay.\" \nEutrophication was recognized as a water pollution problem in European and North American lakes and reservoirs in the mid-20th century. Breakthrough research carried out at the Experimental Lakes Area (ELA) in Ontario, Canada, in the 1970s provided the evidence that freshwater bodies are phosphorus-limited. ELA uses the whole ecosystem approach and long-term, whole-lake investigations of freshwater focusing on cultural eutrophication. \nCauses.\nEutrophication is caused by excessive concentrations of nutrients, most commonly phosphates and nitrates, although this varies with location. Prior to their being phasing out in the 1970's, phosphate-containing detergents contributed to eutrophication. Since then, sewage and agriculture have emerged as the dominant phosphate sources. The main sources of nitrogen pollution are from agricultural runoff containing fertilizers and animal wastes, from sewage, and from atmospheric deposition of nitrogen originating\u00a0from combustion or animal waste.\nThe limitation of productivity in any aquatic system varies with the rate of supply (from external sources) and removal (flushing out) of nutrients from the body of water. This means that some nutrients are more prevalent in certain areas than others and different ecosystems and environments have different limiting factors. \nPhosphorus is the limiting factor for plant growth in most freshwater ecosystems, and because phosphate adheres tightly to soil particles and sinks in areas such as wetlands and lakes, due to its prevalence nowadays more and more phosphorus is accumulating inside freshwater bodies. \nIn marine ecosystems, nitrogen is the primary limiting nutrient; nitrous oxide (created by the combustion of fossil fuels) and its deposition in the water from the atmosphere has led to an increase in nitrogen levels, and also the heightened levels of eutrophication in the ocean.\nCultural eutrophication.\nCultural or anthropogenic eutrophication is the process that causes eutrophication because of human activity. The problem became more apparent following the introduction of chemical fertilizers in agriculture (green revolution of the mid-1900s). \nPhosphorus and nitrogen are the two main nutrients that cause cultural eutrophication as they enrich the water, allowing for some aquatic plants, especially algae to grow rapidly and bloom in high densities. Algal blooms can shade out benthic plants thereby altering the overall plant community. When algae die off, their degradation by bacteria removes oxygen, potentially, generating anoxic conditions. \nThis anoxic environment kills off aerobic organisms (e.g. fish and invertebrates) in the water body. This also affects terrestrial animals, restricting their access to affected water (e.g. as drinking sources). Selection for algal and aquatic plant species that can thrive in nutrient-rich conditions can cause structural and functional disruption to entire aquatic ecosystems and their food webs, resulting in loss of habitat and species biodiversity.\nThere are several sources of excessive nutrients from human activity including run-off from fertilized fields, lawns, and golf courses, untreated sewage and wastewater and internal combustion of fuels creating nitrogen pollution. Cultural eutrophication can occur in fresh water and salt water bodies, shallow waters being the most susceptible. In shore lines and shallow lakes, sediments are frequently resuspended by wind and waves which can result in nutrient release from sediments into the overlying water, enhancing eutrophication. The deterioration of water quality caused by cultural eutrophication can therefore negatively impact human uses including potable supply for consumption, industrial uses and recreation.\nNatural eutrophication.\nEutrophication can be a natural process and occurs naturally through the gradual accumulation of sediment and nutrients. Naturally, eutrophication is usually caused by the natural accumulation of nutrients from dissolved phosphate minerals and dead plant matter in water.\nNatural eutrophication has been well-characterized in lakes. Paleolimnologists now recognise that climate change, geology, and other external influences are also critical in regulating the natural productivity of lakes. \nA few artificial lakes also demonstrate the reverse process (meiotrophication), becoming less nutrient rich with time as nutrient poor inputs slowly elute the nutrient richer water mass of the lake. This process may be seen in artificial lakes and reservoirs which tend to be highly eutrophic on first filling but may become more oligotrophic with time. The main difference between natural and anthropogenic eutrophication is that the natural process is very slow, occurring on geological time scales.\nEffects.\nEcological effects.\nEutrophication can have the following ecological effects: increased biomass of phytoplankton, changes in macrophyte species composition and biomass, dissolved oxygen depletion, increased incidences of fish kills, loss of desirable fish species.\nDecreased biodiversity.\nWhen an ecosystem experiences an increase in nutrients, primary producers reap the benefits first. In aquatic ecosystems, species such as algae experience a population increase (called an algal bloom). \nAlgal blooms limit the sunlight available to bottom-dwelling organisms and cause wide swings in the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water. Oxygen is required by all aerobically respiring plants and animals and it is replenished in daylight by photosynthesizing plants and algae. \nUnder eutrophic conditions, dissolved oxygen greatly increases during the day, but is greatly reduced after dark by the respiring algae and by microorganisms that feed on the increasing mass of dead algae. When dissolved oxygen levels decline to hypoxic levels, fish and other marine animals suffocate. As a result, creatures such as fish, shrimp, and especially immobile bottom dwellers die off. In extreme cases, anaerobic conditions ensue, promoting growth of bacteria. Zones where this occurs are known as dead zones.\nNew species invasion.\nEutrophication may cause competitive release by making abundant a normally limiting nutrient. This process causes shifts in the species composition of ecosystems. For instance, an increase in nitrogen might allow new, competitive species to invade and out-compete original inhabitant species. This has been shown to occur in New England salt marshes. In Europe and Asia, the common carp frequently lives in naturally eutrophic or hypereutrophic areas, and is adapted to living in such conditions. The eutrophication of areas outside its natural range partially explain the fish's success in colonizing these areas after being introduced.\nToxicity.\nSome harmful algal blooms resulting from eutrophication, are toxic to plants and animals. Freshwater algal blooms can pose a threat to livestock. When the algae die or are eaten, neuro- and hepatotoxins are released which can kill animals and may pose a threat to humans. An example of algal toxins working their way into humans is the case of shellfish poisoning. Biotoxins created during algal blooms are taken up by shellfish (mussels, oysters), leading to these human foods acquiring the toxicity and poisoning humans. Examples include paralytic, neurotoxic, and diarrhoetic shellfish poisoning. Other marine animals can be vectors for such toxins, as in the case of ciguatera, where it is typically a predator fish that accumulates the toxin and then poisons humans.\nThere are five types of toxins associated with harmful algal blooms (HABs). They include domoic acid, ciguatoxin, okadaic acid, brevetoxins, and saxitoxins. All of these toxins, with the exception of ciguatoxin, can cause different types of shellfish poisoning. Domoic acid is associated with amnesic shellfish poisoning; okadaic acid is associated with diarrhetic shellfish poisoning; brevetoxins are associated with neurotoxic shellfish poisoning; and saxitoxins are associated with paralytic shellfish poisoning. Different species of algae are associated with the different toxins. For example, \"Alexandrium\", \"Pyrodinium\", and \"Gymnodinium\" species generate saxitoxins. Saxitoxin is known to be 50 times more lethal than strychnine and 10,000 times more lethal than cyanide.\nEconomic effects.\nEutrophication and harmful algal blooms can have economic impacts due to increasing water treatment costs, commercial fishing and shellfish losses, recreational fishing losses (reductions in harvestable fish and shellfish), and reduced tourism income (decreases in perceived aesthetic value of the water body and decreases in safety due to high bacteria levels from decomposition). Water treatment costs can be increased due to decreases in water transparency (increased turbidity). There can also be issues with color and smell during drinking water treatment. However, controlled eutrophication can potentially be used to increase production in fisheries, which in turn increases community income. Notably, there is a delicate line where eutrophication can become damaging very quickly, and as such is not recommended currently due to high eutrophication rates.\nHealth impacts.\nHuman health effects of eutrophication derive from two main issues excess nitrate in drinking water and exposure to toxic algae. Nitrates in drinking water can cause blue baby syndrome in infants and can react with chemicals used to treat water to create disinfection by-products in drinking water. Getting direct contact with toxic algae through swimming or drinking can cause rashes, stomach or liver illness, and respiratory or neurological problems .\nCauses and effects for different types of water bodies.\nFreshwater systems.\nOne response to added amounts of nutrients in aquatic ecosystems is the rapid growth of microscopic algae, creating an algal bloom. In freshwater ecosystems, the formation of floating algal blooms are commonly nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria (blue-green algae). This outcome is favored when soluble nitrogen becomes limiting and phosphorus inputs remain significant. Nutrient pollution is a major cause of algal blooms and excess growth of other aquatic plants leading to overcrowding competition for sunlight, space, and oxygen. Increased competition for the added nutrients can cause potential disruption to entire ecosystems and food webs, as well as a loss of habitat, and biodiversity of species.\nWhen overproduced macrophytes and algae die in eutrophic water, their decompose further consumes dissolved oxygen. The depleted oxygen levels in turn may lead to fish kills and a range of other effects reducing biodiversity. Nutrients may become concentrated in an anoxic zone, often in deeper waters cut off by stratification of the water column and may only be made available again during autumn turn-over in temperate areas or in conditions of turbulent flow. The dead algae and organic load carried by the water inflows into a lake settle to the bottom and undergo anaerobic digestion releasing greenhouse gases such as methane and CO2. Some of the methane gas may be oxidised by anaerobic methane oxidation bacteria such as \"Methylococcus capsulatus\", which in turn may provide a food source for zooplankton. Thus a self-sustaining biological process can take place to generate primary food source for the phytoplankton and zooplankton depending on the availability of adequate dissolved oxygen in the water body.\nEnhanced growth of aquatic vegetation, phytoplankton and algal blooms disrupts normal functioning of the ecosystem, causing a variety of problems such as a lack of oxygen which is needed for fish and shellfish to survive. The growth of dense algae in surface waters can shade the deeper water and reduce the viability of benthic shelter plants with resultant impacts on the wider ecosystem. Eutrophication also decreases the value of rivers, lakes and aesthetic enjoyment. Health problems can occur where eutrophic conditions interfere with drinking water treatment.\nPhosphorus is often regarded as the main culprit in cases of eutrophication in lakes subjected to \"point source\" pollution from sewage pipes. The concentration of algae and the trophic state of lakes correspond well to phosphorus levels in water. Studies conducted in the Experimental Lakes Area in Ontario have shown a relationship between the addition of phosphorus and the rate of eutrophication. Later stages of eutrophication lead to blooms of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria limited solely by the phosphorus concentration. Phosphorus-base eutrophication in fresh water lakes has been addressed in several cases.\nCoastal waters.\nEutrophication is a common phenomenon in coastal waters, where nitrogenous sources are the main culprit. In coastal waters, nitrogen is commonly the key limiting nutrient of marine waters (unlike the freshwater systems where phosphorus is often the limiting nutrient). Therefore, nitrogen levels are more important than phosphorus levels for understanding and controlling eutrophication problems in salt water. Estuaries, as the interface between freshwater and saltwater, can be both phosphorus and nitrogen limited and commonly exhibit symptoms of eutrophication. Eutrophication in estuaries often results in bottom water hypoxia or anoxia, leading to fish kills and habitat degradation. Upwelling in coastal systems also promotes increased productivity by conveying deep, nutrient-rich waters to the surface, where the nutrients can be assimilated by algae.\nExamples of anthropogenic sources of nitrogen-rich pollution to coastal waters include sea cage fish farming and discharges of ammonia from the production of coke from coal. In addition to runoff from land, wastes from fish farming and industrial ammonia discharges, atmospheric fixed nitrogen can be an important nutrient source in the open ocean. This could account for around one third of the ocean's external (non-recycled) nitrogen supply, and up to 3% of the annual new marine biological production.\nCoastal waters embrace a wide range of marine habitats from enclosed estuaries to the open waters of the continental shelf. Phytoplankton productivity in coastal waters depends on both nutrient and light supply, with the latter an important limiting factor in waters near to shore where sediment resuspension often limits light penetration.\nNutrients are supplied to coastal waters from land via river and groundwater and also via the atmosphere. There is also an important source from the open ocean, via mixing of relatively nutrient rich deep ocean waters. Nutrient inputs from the ocean are little changed by human activity, although climate change may alter the water flows across the shelf break. By contrast, inputs from land to coastal zones of the nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus have been increased by human activity globally. The extent of increases varies greatly from place to place depending on human activities in the catchments. A third key nutrient, dissolved silicon, is derived primarily from sediment weathering to rivers and from offshore and is therefore much less affected by human activity.\nEffects of coastal eutrophication.\nThese increasing nitrogen and phosphorus nutrient inputs exert eutrophication pressures on coastal zones. These pressures vary geographically depending on the catchment activities and associated nutrient load. The geographical setting of the coastal zone is another important factor as it controls dilution of the nutrient load and oxygen exchange with the atmosphere. The effects of these eutrophication pressures can be seen in several different ways:\nExtent of the problem.\nSurveys showed that 54% of lakes in Asia are eutrophic; in Europe, 53%; in North America, 48%; in South America, 41%; and in Africa, 28%. In South Africa, a study by the CSIR using remote sensing has shown more than 60% of the reservoirs surveyed were eutrophic.\nThe World Resources Institute has identified 375 hypoxic coastal zones in the world, concentrated in coastal areas in Western Europe, the Eastern and Southern coasts of the US, and East Asia, particularly Japan.\nPrevention.\nAs a society, there are certain steps we can take to ensure the minimization of eutrophication, thereby reducing its harmful effects on humans and other living organisms in order to sustain a healthy norm of living, some of which are as follows:\nMinimizing pollution from sewage.\nThere are multiple different ways to fix cultural eutrophication with raw sewage being a point source of pollution. For example, sewage treatment plants can be upgraded for biological nutrient removal so that they discharge much less nitrogen and phosphorus to the receiving water body. However, even with good secondary treatment, most final effluents from sewage treatment works contain substantial concentrations of nitrogen as nitrate, nitrite or ammonia. Removal of these nutrients is an expensive and often difficult process.\nLaws regulating the discharge and treatment of sewage have led to dramatic nutrient reductions to surrounding ecosystems. As a major contributor to the nonpoint source nutrient loading of water bodies is untreated domestic sewage, it is necessary to provide treatment facilities to highly urbanized areas, particularly those in developing countries, in which treatment of domestic waste water is a scarcity. The technology to safely and efficiently reuse wastewater, both from domestic and industrial sources, should be a primary concern for policy regarding eutrophication.\nMinimizing nutrient pollution by agriculture.\nThere are many ways to help fix cultural eutrophication caused by agriculture. Some recommendations issued by the U.S. Department of Agriculture include:\nPolicy.\nThe United Nations framework for Sustainable Development Goals recognizes the damaging effects of eutrophication for marine environments. It has established a timeline for creating an Index of Coastal Eutrophication and Floating Plastic Debris Density (ICEP) within Sustainable Development Goal 14 (life below water). SDG 14 specifically has a target to: \"by 2025, prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds, in particular from land-based activities, including marine debris and nutrient pollution\".\nPolicy and regulations are a set of tools to minimize causes of eutrophication. Nonpoint sources of pollution are the primary contributors to eutrophication, and their effects can be minimized through common agricultural practices. Reducing the amount of pollutants that reach a watershed can be achieved through the protection of its forest cover, reducing the amount of erosion leeching into a watershed. Also, through the efficient, controlled use of land using sustainable agricultural practices to minimize land degradation, the amount of soil runoff and nitrogen-based fertilizers reaching a watershed can be reduced. Waste disposal technology constitutes another factor in eutrophication prevention.\nThe current policies proposed are mainly command-and-control policies, which are based on commonly used regulation standards.\u00a0Although these policies are easier to implement, they are not as cost-effective. This typically involves implementing limitations on input resources, emissions, or technologies, which are all common command-and-control policies that have been implemented by multiple countries.\nBecause a body of water can have an effect on a range of people reaching far beyond that of the watershed, cooperation between different organizations is necessary to prevent the intrusion of contaminants that can lead to eutrophication. Agencies ranging from state governments to those of water resource management and non-governmental organizations, going as low as the local population, are responsible for preventing eutrophication of water bodies. In the United States, the most well known inter-state effort to prevent eutrophication is the Chesapeake Bay.\nReversal and remediation.\nReducing nutrient inputs is a crucial precondition for restoration. Still, there are two caveats: Firstly, it can take a long time, mainly because of the storage of nutrients in sediments. Secondly, restoration may need more than a simple reversal of inputs since there are sometimes several stable but very different ecological states. Recovery of eutrophicated lakes is slow, often requiring several decades.\nIn environmental remediation, nutrient removal technologies include biofiltration, which uses living material to capture and biologically degrade pollutants. Examples include green belts, riparian areas, natural and constructed wetlands, and treatment ponds.\nAlgae bloom forecasting.\nThe National Oceanic Atmospheric Admiration in the United States has created a forecasting tool for regions such as the Great Lakes, the Gulf of Maine, and The Gulf of Mexico. Shorter term predictions can help to show the intensity, location, and trajectory of blooms in order to warn more directly affected communities. Longer term tests in specific regions and bodies help to predict larger scale factors like scale of future blooms and factors that could lead to more adverse effects.\nNutrient bioextraction.\nNutrient bioextraction is bioremediation involving cultured plants and animals. Nutrient bioextraction or bioharvesting is the practice of farming and harvesting shellfish and seaweed to remove nitrogen and other nutrients from natural water bodies.\nShellfish in estuaries.\nIt has been suggested that nitrogen removal by oyster reefs could generate net benefits for sources facing nitrogen emission restrictions, similar to other nutrient trading scenarios. Specifically, if oysters maintain nitrogen levels in estuaries below thresholds, then oysters effectively stave off an enforcement response, and compliance costs parties responsible for nitrogen emission would otherwise incur. Several studies have shown that oysters and mussels can dramatically impact nitrogen levels in estuaries. Filter feeding activity is considered beneficial to water quality by controlling phytoplankton density and sequestering nutrients, which can be removed from the system through shellfish harvest, buried in the sediments, or lost through denitrification. Foundational work toward the idea of improving marine water quality through shellfish cultivation was conducted by Odd Lindahl et al., using mussels in Sweden. In the United States, shellfish restoration projects have been conducted on the East, West and Gulf coasts.\nSeaweed farming.\nStudies have demonstrated seaweed's potential to improve nitrogen levels. Seaweed aquaculture offers an opportunity to mitigate, and adapt to climate change. Seaweed, such as kelp, also absorbs phosphorus and nitrogen and is thus helpful to remove excessive nutrients from polluted parts of the sea. Some cultivated seaweeds have very high productivity and could absorb large quantities of N, P, CO2, producing large amounts of having an excellent effect on decreasing eutrophication. It is believed that seaweed cultivation in large scale should be a good solution to the eutrophication problem in coastal waters.\nGeo-engineering.\nAnother technique for combatting hypoxia/eutrophication in localized situations is direct injection of compressed air, a technique used in the restoration of the Salford Docks area of the Manchester Ship Canal in England. For smaller-scale waters such as aquaculture ponds, pump aeration is standard.\nChemical removal of phosphorus.\nRemoving phosphorus can remediate eutrophication. Of the several phosphate sorbents, alum (aluminium sulfate) is of practical interest.) Many materials have been investigated. The phosphate sorbent is commonly applied in the surface of the water body and it sinks to the bottom of the lake reducing phosphate, such sorbents have been applied worldwide to manage eutrophication and algal bloom (for example under the commercial name Phoslock). In a large-scale study, 114 lakes were monitored for the effectiveness of alum at phosphorus reduction. Across all lakes, alum effectively reduced the phosphorus for 11 years. While there was variety in longevity (21 years in deep lakes and 5.7 years in shallow lakes), the results express the effectiveness of alum at controlling phosphorus within lakes. Alum treatment is less effective in deep lakes, as well as lakes with substantial external phosphorus loading.\nFinnish phosphorus removal measures started in the mid-1970s and have targeted rivers and lakes polluted by industrial and municipal discharges. These efforts have had a 90% removal efficiency. Still, some targeted point sources did not show a decrease in runoff despite reduction efforts.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

According to common law, robbery is defined as taking the property of another, with the intent to permanently deprive the person of that property, by means of force or fear; that is, it is a larceny or theft accomplished by an assault. Precise definitions of the offence may vary between jurisdictions. Robbery is differentiated from other forms of theft (such as burglary, shoplifting, pickpocketing, or car theft) by its inherently violent nature (a violent crime); whereas many lesser forms of theft are punished as misdemeanors, robbery is always a felony in jurisdictions that distinguish between the two. Under English law, most forms of theft are triable either way, whereas robbery is triable only on indictment. \nEtymology.\nThe word \"rob\" came via French from Late Latin words (e.g., \"deraubare\") of Germanic origin, from Common Germanic \"raub\" \"theft\".\nTypes of robbery.\nAmong the types of robbery are armed robbery, which involves the use of a weapon, and aggravated robbery, when someone brings with them a deadly weapon or something that appears to be a deadly weapon. Highway robbery or mugging takes place outside or in a public place such as a sidewalk, street, or parking lot. Carjacking is the act of stealing a car from a victim by force. \nCriminal slang for various kinds of robbery includes \"blagging\" (armed robbery, usually of a bank), \"stickup\" (derived from the verbal command \"Stick 'em up!\" to robbery targets to raise their hands in the air), and \"steaming\" (organized robbery; originally referred to robbery of trains); see for more.\nBy country.\nCanada.\nIn Canada, the Criminal Code makes robbery an indictable offence, subject to a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. If the accused uses a restricted or prohibited firearm to commit robbery, there is a mandatory minimum sentence of five years for the first offence, and seven years for subsequent offences.\nIreland.\nRobbery is a statutory offence in Ireland. It is created by section 14(1) of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001, which provides:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A person is guilty of robbery if he or she steals, and immediately before or at the time of doing so, and in order to do so, uses force on any person or puts or seeks to put any person in fear of being then and there subjected to force.\nUnited Kingdom.\nEngland and Wales.\nRobbery is a statutory offence created by section 8(1) of the Theft Act 1968, which reads:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A person is guilty of robbery if he steals, and immediately before or at the time of doing so, and in order to do so, he uses force on any person or puts or seeks to put any person in fear of being then and there subjected to force.\nAggravated theft.\nRobbery is the only offence of aggravated theft.\nAggravated robbery.\nThere are no offences of aggravated robbery.\n\"Steals\".\nThis requires evidence to show a theft as set out in section 1(1) of the Theft Act 1968. In \"R v Robinson\" the defendant threatened the victim with a knife in order to recover money which he was actually owed. His conviction for robbery was quashed on the basis that Robinson had an honest, although unreasonable, belief (under Section 2(1)(a) of the Act) in his legal right to the money. See also \"R v Skivington\" [1968] 1 QB 166, [1967] 2 WLR 655, 131 JP 265, 111 SJ 72, [1967] 1 All ER 483, 51 Cr App R 167, CA.\nIn \"R v Hale\" (1978) the application of force and the stealing took place in many different locations, and it was not possible to establish the timing; it was held that the appropriation necessary to prove theft was a continuing act, and the jury could correctly convict of robbery. This approach was followed in \"R v Lockley\" (1995) when the force was applied to a shopkeeper after property had been taken. It was argued that the theft should be regarded as complete by this time, and \"R v Gomez\" (1993), should apply; the court disagreed, preferring to follow \"R v Hale\".\nActual or threatened force against a person.\nThe threat or use of force must take place immediately before or at the time of the theft. Force used after the theft is complete will not turn the theft into a robbery.\nThe words \"or immediately after\" that appeared in section 23(1)(b) of the Larceny Act 1916 were deliberately omitted from section 8(1).\nThe book \"Archbold\" said that the facts in \"R v Harman\", which did not amount to robbery in 1620, would not amount to robbery now.\nIt was held in \"R v Dawson and James\" (1978) that \"force\" is an ordinary English word and its meaning should be left to the jury. This approach was confirmed in \"R v Clouden\" (1985) and \"Corcoran v Anderton\" (1980), both handbag-snatching cases. Stealing may involve a young child who is not aware that taking other persons' property is not in order.\nThreat.\nThe victim must be placed in apprehension or fear that force would be used immediately before or at the time of the taking of the property. A threat is not immediate if the wrongdoer threatens to use force of violence some future time.\nRobbery occurs if an aggressor forcibly snatched a mobile phone or if they used a knife to make an implied threat of violence to the holder and then took the phone. The person being threatened does not need to be the owner of the property. It is not necessary that the victim was actually frightened, but the defendant must have put or sought to put the victim or some other person in fear of immediate force.\nThe force or threat may be directed against a third party, for example a customer in a jeweller's shop. Theft accompanied by a threat to damage property does not constitute robbery, but it may disclose an offence of blackmail.\nDishonestly dealing with property stolen during a robbery constitutes an offence of handling.\nMode of trial.\nRobbery is an indictable-only offence.\nSentence.\nUnder current sentencing guidelines, the punishment for robbery is affected by a variety of aggravating and mitigating factors. Particularly important is how much harm was caused to the victim and how much culpability the offender had (e.g. carrying a weapon or leading a group effort implies high culpability). Robbery is divided into three categories which are, in increasing order of seriousness: street or less sophisticated commercial, dwelling, and professionally planned commercial.\nRobbery generally results in a custodial sentence. Only a low-harm, low-culpability robbery with other mitigating factors would result in an alternative punishment, in the form of a high-level community order. The maximum legal punishment is imprisonment for life. It is also subject to the mandatory sentencing regime under the Criminal Justice Act 2003. Current sentencing guidelines advise that the sentence should be no longer than 20 years, for a high-harm, high-culpability robbery with other aggravating factors.\nThe \"starting point\" sentences are:\nAn offender may also serve a longer sentence if they are convicted of other offences alongside the robbery, such as assault and grievous bodily harm.\nCommon law.\nRobbery was an offence under the common law of England. Matthew Hale provided the following definition:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Robbery is the felonious and violent taking of any money or goods from the person of another, putting him in fear, be the value thereof above or under one shilling.\nThe common law offence of robbery was abolished for all purposes not relating to offences committed before 1 January 1969 by section 32(1)(a) of the Theft Act 1968.\nStatute.\nSee sections 40 to 43 of the Larceny Act 1861.\nSection 23 of the Larceny Act 1916 read:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;23.-(1) Every person who -\n(a) being armed with any offensive weapon or instrument, or being together with one other person or more, robs, or assaults with intent to rob, any person;\n(b) robs any person and, at the time of or immediately before or immediately after such robbery, uses any personal violence to any person;\nshall be guilty of felony and on conviction thereof liable to penal servitude for life, and, in addition, if a male, to be once privately whipped.\n(2) Every person who robs any person shall be guilty of felony and on conviction thereof liable to penal servitude for any term not exceeding fourteen years.\n(3) Every person who assaults any person with intent to rob shall be guilty of felony and on conviction thereof liable to penal servitude for any term not exceeding five years.\nThis section provided maximum penalties for a number of offences of robbery and aggravated robbery.\nAssault with intent to rob.\nIf a robbery is foiled before it can be completed, an alternative offence (with the same penalty, given by section 8(2) of the 1968 Act) is assault; any act which intentionally or recklessly causes another to fear the immediate and unlawful use of force, with an intent to rob, will suffice.\nThe following cases are relevant:\nMode of trial and sentence.\nAssault with intent to rob is an indictable-only offence. It is punishable with imprisonment for life or for any shorter term.\nAssault with intent to rob is also subject to the mandatory sentencing regime under the Criminal Justice Act 2003.\nNorthern Ireland.\nRobbery is a statutory offence in Northern Ireland. It is created by http:// of the Theft Act (Northern Ireland) 1969.\nUnited States.\nIn the United States, robbery is generally treated as an aggravated form of common-law larceny. Specific elements and definitions differ from state to state. The common elements of robbery are\na trespassory taking and carrying away of the personal property of another with the intent to steal from the person or presence of the victim by force or threat of force.\nThe first six elements are the same as common-law larceny. It is the last two elements that aggravate the crime to common-law robbery.\nfrom the person or presence of the victim \u2013 robbery requires that the property be taken directly from the person of the victim or from their presence. This is different from larceny, which simply requires that property be taken from the victim's possession, actual or constructive. Property is \"on the victim's person\" if the victim is actually holding the property, or the property is contained within clothing the victim is wearing or is attached to a victim's body, such as a watch or earrings. Property is in a person's presence when it is within the area of their immediate control. The property has to be close enough to the victim's person that the victim could have prevented its taking if he/she had not been placed in fear or intimidation.\nby force or threat of force \u2013 the use of force or threat of force is the defining element of robbery. For there to be robbery there must be \"force or fear\" in perpetrating the theft. Questions concerning the degree of force necessary for robbery have been the subject of much litigation. Merely snatching the property from the victim's person is not sufficient force unless the victim resists or one of the items is attached or carried in such a way that a significant amount of force must be used to free the item from the victim's person.\nFor robbery the victim must be placed in \"fear\" of immediate harm by threat or intimidation. The threat need not be directed at the victim personally. Threats to third parties are sufficient. The threat must be one of present rather than future personal harm. Fear does not mean \"fright\", it means apprehension \u2013 an awareness of the danger of immediate bodily harm.\nCalifornia.\nThe maximum sentence for robbery in California is 9 years, according to Penal Code section 213(a)(1)(A).\nThe threat or use of force does not have to take place immediately before or at the time of the theft. Force used after the theft will turn the theft into a robbery unless the theft is complete. The theft is considered completed when the perpetrator reaches a place of temporary safety with the property.\nRobbery statistics.\nReported robberies.\nThe United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime notes \"that when using the figures, any cross-national comparisons should be conducted with caution because of the differences that exist between the legal definitions of offences in countries, or the different methods of offence counting and recording\". Also, not every crime is reported, meaning two things: (1) robbery rates appear lower than they actually are, and (2) the percentage of crime that is not reported is higher in some countries than others; for example, in one country 86% of the robberies were reported, whereas in another country only 67% of the robberies were reported. Crime also varies by certain neighborhoods or areas in each country, so a nationwide rate does not indicate the danger or safety everywhere in that country. A 1983 study by the Department of Justice estimated that the amount of robberies in the US at schools alone may reach one million a year, exceeding the National Crime Survey reported estimate.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Table alignment/tables.css\" /&gt;\nPrevalence.\nThe below table shows the percentage of population which was victim to robbery in the previous 12 months according to United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, typically through statistical surveys to avoid under-reporting.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Table alignment/tables.css\" /&gt;\nIn popular culture.\nRobberies have been depicted, sometimes graphically, in various forms of media, and several robbers have become pop icons, such as Bonnie and Clyde and John Dillinger. Examples of media works focused on robberies include:\nIn video games.\nVideo games \"\", \"Payday 2\" and \"Payday 3\" are games by Overkill Software where one of the main objectives is to steal items of monetary value at places such as banks, art galleries, armored trucks, and more.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Poet Langston Hughes calls it the \"Heartbeat of Harlem\" in Juke Box Love Song, and he set his work \"Lenox Avenue: Midnight\" on the legendary street. The Savoy was one of many Harlem hot spots along Lenox, but it was the one to be called the \"World's Finest Ballroom\". It was in operation from March 12, 1926, to July 10, 1958, and as Barbara Englebrecht writes in her article \"Swinging at the Savoy\", it was \"a building, a geographic place, a ballroom, and the 'soul' of a neighborhood\".\nIt was opened and owned by white entrepreneur Jay Faggen and Jewish businessman Moe Gale. It was managed by African-American businessman and civic leader Charles Buchanan. Buchanan, who was born in the British West Indies, sought to run a \"luxury ballroom to accommodate the many thousands who wished to dance in an atmosphere of tasteful refinement, rather than in the small stuffy halls and the foul smelling, smoke laden cellar nightclubs\u00a0...\"\nHistory.\nThe Savoy was modeled after Faggen's downtown venue, Roseland Ballroom. The Roseland was a mostly European American swing dance club. With swing's rise to popularity and Harlem becoming a connected black community, The Savoy gave the rising talented and passionate black dancers an equally beautiful venue. The ballroom, which was 10,000 square feet in size, was on the second floor and a block long. It could hold up to 4,000 people. The interior was painted pink and the walls were mirrored. Colored lights danced on the sprung layered wood floor. In 1926, the Savoy contained a spacious lobby framing a huge, cut glass chandelier and marble staircase. Leon James is quoted in \"Jazz Dance\" as saying, \"My first impression was that I had stepped into another world. I had been to other ballrooms, but this was different \u2013 much bigger, more glamour, real class\u00a0...\"\nThe Savoy Ballroom was named after the Savoy Hotel in London as those who named the ballroom felt this gave the ballroom a classy, upscale feeling, as the hotel is a very elite, upscale hotel.\nThe Savoy was popular from the start. A headline from the \"New York Age\" March 20, 1926, reads \"Savoy Turns 2,000 Away On Opening Night \u2013 Crowds Pack Ball Room All Week\". The ballroom remained lit every night of the week.\nThe Savoy had the constant presence of the best Lindy Hoppers, known as \"Savoy Lindy Hoppers\". Occasionally, groups of dancers such as Whitey's Lindy Hoppers turned professional and performed in Broadway and Hollywood productions. Whitey turned out to be a successful agent, and in 1937 the Marx Brothers' movie \"A Day at the Races\" featured the group. Herbert White was a bouncer at the Savoy who was made floor manager in the early 1930s. He was sometimes known as Mac, but with his ambition to scout dancers at the ballroom to form his own group, he became widely known as Whitey for the white streak of hair down the center of his head. He looked for dancers who were \"young, stylized, and, most of all, they had to have a beat, they had to swing\".\nUnlike many ballrooms such as the Cotton Club, the Savoy always had a no-discrimination policy. The clientele was 85% black and 15% white, although sometimes there was an even split. Lindy hop dancer Frankie Manning said that patrons were judged on their dancing skills and not on the color of their skin: \"One night somebody came over and said, 'Hey man, Clark Gable just walked in the house.' Somebody else said, 'Oh, yeah, can he dance?' All they wanted to know when you came into the Savoy was, do you dance?\".\nThe northeast corner of the dance floor, nicknamed \"Cats' Corner,\" was monopolized by the best and boldest dancers. Some sources claim only Whitey's Lindy Hoppers were permitted to dance there, while others are less specific. Competition for a place in Cats' Corner was fierce, and every serious hopper awaited the nightly \"showtime\". Other dancers would create a horseshoe around the band and \"only the greatest Lindy-hoppers would stay on the floor, to try to eliminate each other\".\nMany dances such as the Lindy Hop (which was named after Charles Lindbergh and originated in 1927) were developed and became famous there. It was known downtown as the \"Home of Happy Feet\" but uptown, in Harlem, as \"the Track\" because the floor was long and thin. The Lindy Hop is also known as The Jitterbug and was born out of \"mounting exhilaration and the 'hot' interaction of music and dance\". Other dances that were conceived at the Savoy are The Flying Charleston, Jive, Snakehips, Rhumboogie, and variations of the Shimmy and Mambo. Capitol Records released at least one album devoted to the club, \"The Home of Happy Feet\", from 1959.\nIt is estimated that the ballroom generated $250,000 in annual profit in its peak years from the late 1920s to the 1940s. Every year the ballroom was visited by almost 700,000 people. The entrance fee was 30 to 85 cents per person, depending on what time a person came. Thirty cents was the base price, but after 6\u00a0pm the fee was 60 cents, and then 85 cents after 8\u00a0pm. The Savoy made enough money by its peak in 1936 that $50,000 was spent on remodeling.\nThe ballroom had a double bandstand that held one large and one medium-sized band running against its east wall. Music was continuous as the alternative band was always in position and ready to pick up the beat when the previous one had completed its set. The bouncers, who had previously worked as boxers, basketball players, and the like, wore tuxedos and made $100 a night. The floor was watched inconspicuously by a security force of four men at a time who were headed by Jack La Rue, and no man was allowed in who wasn't dressed in a jacket with a tie. Besides the security staff, the Savoy was populated by \"Harlem's most beautiful women\": the Savoy Hostesses. They would be fired for consorting with patrons outside the ballroom, but inside the hostesses would teach people to dance and were dance partners for anyone who purchased a 25 cent dance ticket. Roseland Ballroom hostesses often visited the Savoy on their night off; this inspired Buchanan to create Monday Ladies-Free Nights. Other special events began during the week, including the giveaway of a new car every Saturday. The floor had to be replaced every three years due to frequent use.\nDuring the 1930s, Chick Webb was the bandleader of the Savoy's most popular house band. Ella Fitzgerald, fresh from a talent show victory at the Apollo Theater in 1934, became its teenage vocalist. Webb also recorded the 1934 big band song and jazz standard \"Stompin' at the Savoy\", which is named for the Savoy. The Savoy was the site of many Battle of the Bands or Cutting Contests, which started when the Benny Goodman Orchestra challenged Webb in 1937. Webb and his band were declared the winners of that contest. In 1938, Webb was challenged by the Count Basie Band. While Webb was declared the winner again, there was a lack of consensus on who won. Earle Warren, alto saxophonist for Basie, reported that they had worked on the song \"Swingin' the Blues\" for competing and says, \"When we unloaded our cannons, that was the end\".\nFloating World Pictures made a documentary called \"The Savoy King\" about the ballroom. It was shown at the 50th New York Film Festival. Other prominent Savoy house bandleaders included Al Cooper, Erskine Hawkins, Lucky Millinder (with Wynonie Harris on vocals), Buddy Johnson, and Cootie Williams.\nThe Savoy participated in the 1939 New York World's Fair, presenting \"The Evolution of Negro Dance\".\nThe ballroom was shut down in April 1943 as a result of \"charges of vice filed by the police department and Army\". Its license was renewed in mid-October of the same year.\nDemolition and legacy.\nThe ballroom went out of business in October 1958.\nDespite efforts to save it by Borough President Hulan Jack, Savoy Ballroom manager and co-owner Charles Buchanan, clubs, and organizations, the Savoy Ballroom was demolished for the construction of the Delano Village housing complex between March and April 1959. The mayor was the target of protest by clubs and organizations. The fixtures of the ballroom were auctioned for a \"slum clearance housing project\". Count Basie was quoted in the paper saying, \"With the passing of the Savoy Ballroom, a part of show business is gone. I feel about the same way I did when someone told me the news that Bill (Bojangles) Robinson was dead\".\nOn May 26, 2002, Frankie Manning and Norma Miller, members of Whitey's Lindy Hoppers, unveiled a commemorative plaque for the Savoy Ballroom on Lenox Avenue between 140th and 141st Streets.\nOn the 19th anniversary of the plaque's installation, the Savoy Ballroom was honored with an interactive Google Doodle rhythm game, which featured popular swing dance tunes like Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong's \"Let's Call the Whole Thing Off\" duet.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is bounded roughly by the Hudson River on the west; the Harlem River and 155th Street on the north; Fifth Avenue on the east; and 110th Street on the south. The greater Harlem area encompasses several other neighborhoods and extends west and north to 155th Street, east to the East River, and south to Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, Central Park, and East 96th Street.\nOriginally a Dutch village, formally organized in 1658, it is named after the city of Haarlem in the Netherlands. Harlem's history has been defined by a series of economic boom-and-bust cycles, with significant population shifts accompanying each cycle. Harlem was predominantly occupied by Jewish and Italian Americans in the late 19th century, while African-American residents began to arrive in large numbers during the Great Migration in the early 20th century. In the 1920s and 1930s, Central and West Harlem were the center of the Harlem Renaissance, a major African-American cultural movement. With job losses during the Great Depression of the 1930s and the deindustrialization of New York City after World War II, rates of crime and poverty increased significantly. In the 21st century, crime rates decreased significantly, and Harlem started to gentrify.\nThe area is served by the New York City Subway and local bus routes. It contains several public elementary, middle, and high schools, and is close to several colleges, including Columbia University, Manhattan School of Music, and the City College of New York. Central Harlem is part of Manhattan Community District 10. It is patrolled by the 28th and 32nd Precincts of the New York City Police Department. The greater Harlem area also includes Manhattan Community Districts 9 and 11 and several police precincts, while fire services are provided by four New York City Fire Department companies.\nGeography.\nHarlem is located in Upper Manhattan. The three neighborhoods comprising the greater Harlem area\u2014West, Central, and East Harlem\u2014stretch from the Harlem River and East River to the east, to the Hudson River to the west; and between 155th Street in the north, where it meets Washington Heights, and an uneven boundary along the south that runs along 96th Street east of Fifth Avenue, 110th Street between Fifth Avenue to Morningside Park, and 125th Street west of Morningside Park to the Hudson River. \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\" references these boundaries, though the \"Encyclopedia of New York City\" takes a much more conservative view of Harlem's boundaries, regarding only central Harlem as part of Harlem proper.\nCentral Harlem is the name of Harlem proper; it falls under Manhattan Community District 10. This section is bounded by Central Park North 110th street on the south; 155th street on the north; Fifth avenue on the east; and Morningside Park, St. Nicholas Avenue, and Edgecombe Avenue on the west. A chain of large linear parks includes Morningside Park, St. Nicholas Park, Jackie Robinson Park, Rucker Park, and Marcus Garvey Park (also known as Mount Morris Park) which separates this area from East Harlem to the east. Central Harlem includes the Mount Morris Park Historic District.\nWest Harlem (Manhattanville, Hamilton Heights, and Sugar Hill) comprises Manhattan Community district 9. The three neighborhoods' area is bounded by Cathedral Parkway/110th Street on the south; 155th Street on the north; Manhattan/Morningside Ave/St. Nicholas/Bradhurst/Edgecombe Avenues on the east; and Riverside Park/the Hudson River on the west. Manhattanville begins at roughly 123rd Street and extends northward to 135th Street. The northernmost section of West Harlem is Hamilton Heights. A chain of large linear parks includes West Harlem Piers, Riverbank State Park, St. Nicholas Park, and Jackie Robinson Park.\nEast Harlem, also called Spanish Harlem or \"El Barrio\", is located within Manhattan Community District 11, which is bounded by East 96th Street on the south, East 138th Street on the north, Fifth Avenue on the west, and the Harlem River on the east. A chain of parks includes Thomas Jefferson Park and Marcus Garvey Park.\nSoHa controversy.\nIn the 2010s some real estate professionals started rebranding south Harlem as \"SoHa\" (a name standing for \"South Harlem\" in the style of SoHo or NoHo) in an attempt to accelerate gentrification of the neighborhoods. \"SoHa\", applied to the area between West 110th and 125th Streets, has become a controversial name. Residents and other critics seeking to prevent this renaming of the area have labelled the SoHa brand as \"insulting and another sign of gentrification run amok\" and have said that \"the rebranding not only places their neighborhood's rich history under erasure but also appears to be intent on attracting new tenants, including students from nearby Columbia University\".\nMultiple New York City politicians have initiated legislative efforts to curtail this practice of neighborhood rebranding, which when successfully introduced in other New York City neighborhoods, have led to increases in rents and real estate values, as well as \"shifting demographics\". In 2011, U.S. Representative Hakeem Jeffries attempted but failed to implement legislation \"that would punish real estate agents for inventing false neighborhoods and redrawing neighborhood boundaries without city approval.\" By 2017, New York State Senator Brian Benjamin also worked to render the practice of rebranding historically recognized neighborhoods illegal.\nPolitical representation.\nPolitically, central Harlem is in New York's 13th congressional district. It is in the New York State Senate's 30th district, the New York State Assembly's 68th and 70th districts, and the New York City Council's 7th, 8th, and 9th districts.\nHistory.\nBefore the arrival of European settlers, the area that would become Harlem (originally Haarlem) was inhabited by a Native American band, the \"Wecquaesgeek\", dubbed \"Manhattans\" or \"Manhattoe\" by Dutch settlers, who along with other Native Americans, most likely Lenape, occupied the area on a semi-nomadic basis. As many as several hundred farmed the Harlem flatlands. Between 1637 and 1639, a few colonial settlements were established. The settlement of Harlem was formally incorporated in 1660 under the leadership of Peter Stuyvesant.\nDuring the American Revolution, the British burned Harlem to the ground. It took a long time to rebuild, as Harlem grew more slowly than the rest of Manhattan during the late 18th century. After the American Civil War, Harlem experienced an economic boom starting in 1868. The neighborhood continued to serve as a refuge for New Yorkers, but increasingly those coming north were poor and Jewish or Italian. The New York and Harlem Railroad, as well as the Interborough Rapid Transit and elevated railway lines, helped Harlem's economic growth, as they connected Harlem to lower and midtown Manhattan.\nThe Jewish and Italian demographic decreased, while the black and Puerto Rican population increased in this time. The early-20th century Great Migration of black people to northern industrial cities was fueled by their desire to leave behind the Jim Crow South, seek better jobs and education for their children, and escape a culture of lynching violence; during World War I, expanding industries recruited black laborers to fill new jobs, thinly staffed after the draft began to take young men. In 1910, Central Harlem population was about 10% black people. By 1930, it had reached 70%.\nStarting around the time of the end of World War I, Harlem became associated with the New Negro movement, and then the artistic outpouring known as the Harlem Renaissance, which extended to poetry, novels, theater, and the visual arts. So many black people came that it \"threaten[ed] the very existence of some of the leading industries of Georgia, Florida, Tennessee and Alabama.\" Many settled in Harlem. By 1920, central Harlem was 32.43% black. The 1930 census revealed that 70.18% of central Harlem's residents were black and lived as far south as Central Park, at 110th Street.\nHowever, by the 1930s, the neighborhood was hit hard by job losses in the Great Depression. In the early 1930s, 25% of Harlemites were out of work, and employment prospects for Harlemites stayed poor for decades. Employment among black New Yorkers fell as some traditionally black businesses, including domestic service and some types of manual labor, were taken over by other ethnic groups. Major industries left New York City altogether, especially after 1950. Several riots happened in this period, including in 1935 and 1943.\nThere were major changes following World War II. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Harlem was the scene of a series of rent strikes by neighborhood tenants, led by local activist Jesse Gray, together with the Congress of Racial Equality, Harlem Youth Opportunities Unlimited (HARYOU), and other groups. These groups wanted the city to force landlords to improve the quality of housing by bringing them up to code, to take action against rats and roaches, to provide heat during the winter, and to keep prices in line with existing rent control regulations.\nThe largest public works projects in Harlem in these years were public housing, with the largest concentration built in East Harlem. Typically, existing structures were torn down and replaced with city-designed and managed properties that would, in theory, present a safer and more pleasant environment than those available from private landlords. Ultimately, community objections halted the construction of new projects.\nFrom the mid-20th century, the low quality of education in Harlem has been a source of distress. In the 1960s, about 75% of Harlem students tested under grade levels in reading skills, and 80% tested under grade level in math. In 1964, residents of Harlem staged two school boycotts to call attention to the problem. In central Harlem, 92% of students stayed home. In the post-World War II era, Harlem ceased to be home to a majority of the city's black people, but it remained the cultural and political capital of black New York, and possibly black America.\nBy the 1970s, many of those Harlemites who were able to escape from poverty left the neighborhood in search of better schools and homes, and safer streets. Those who remained were the poorest and least skilled, with the fewest opportunities for success. Though the federal government's Model Cities Program spent $100\u00a0million on job training, health care, education, public safety, sanitation, housing, and other projects over a ten-year period, Harlem showed no improvement. The city began auctioning its enormous portfolio of Harlem properties to the public in 1985. This was intended to improve the community by placing property in the hands of people who would live in them and maintain them. In many cases, the city would even pay to completely renovate a property before selling it (by lottery) below market value.\nAfter the 1990s, Harlem began to grow again. Between 1990 and 2006 the neighborhood's population grew by 16.9%, with the percentage of black people decreasing from 87.6% to 69.3%, then dropping to 54.4% by 2010, and the percentage of whites increasing from 1.5% to 6.6% by 2006, and to \"almost 10%\" by 2010. A renovation of 125th Street and new properties along the thoroughfare also helped to revitalize Harlem.\nCulture.\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, Central and West Harlem was the focus of the \"Harlem Renaissance\", an outpouring of artistic work without precedent in the American Black community. Though Harlem musicians and writers are particularly well remembered, the community has also hosted numerous actors and theater companies, including the New Heritage Repertory Theater, National Black Theater, Lafayette Players, Harlem Suitcase Theater, The Negro Playwrights, American Negro Theater, and the Rose McClendon Players.\nThe Apollo Theater opened on 125th Street on January 26, 1934, in a former burlesque house. The Savoy Ballroom, on Lenox Avenue, was a renowned venue for swing dancing, and was immortalized in a popular song of the era, \"Stompin' at the Savoy\". In the 1920s and 1930s, between Lenox and Seventh Avenues in central Harlem, over 125 entertainment venues were in operation, including speakeasies, cellars, lounges, cafes, taverns, supper clubs, rib joints, theaters, dance halls, and bars and grills.\n133rd Street, known as \"Swing Street\", became known for its cabarets, speakeasies and jazz scene during the Prohibition era, and was dubbed \"Jungle Alley\" because of \"inter-racial mingling\" on the street. Some jazz venues, including the Cotton Club, where Duke Ellington played, and Connie's Inn, were restricted to whites only. Others were integrated, including the Renaissance Ballroom and the Savoy Ballroom.\nIn 1936, Orson Welles produced his black \"Macbeth\" at the Lafayette Theater in Harlem. Grand theaters from the late 19th and early 20th centuries were torn down or converted to churches. Harlem lacked any permanent performance space until the creation of the Gatehouse Theater in an old Croton aqueduct building on 135th Street in 2006.\nFrom 1965 until 2007, the community was home to the Harlem Boys Choir, a touring choir and education program for young boys, most of whom are black. The Girls Choir of Harlem was founded in 1989, and closed with the Boys Choir.\nFrom 1967 to 1969, the Harlem Cultural Festival took place in Mount Morris Park. Another name for this festival is \"Black Woodstock\". Artists like Stevie Wonder, The 5th Dimension, and Gladys Knight performed here.\nHarlem is also home to the largest African American Day Parade, which celebrates the culture of African diaspora in America. The parade was started up in the spring of 1969 with Congressman Adam Clayton Powell Jr. as the Grand Marshal of the first celebration.\nArthur Mitchell, a former dancer with the New York City Ballet, established Dance Theatre of Harlem as a school and company of classical ballet and theater training in the late 1960s. The company has toured nationally and internationally. Generations of theater artists have gotten a start at the school.\nBy the 2010s, new dining hotspots were opening in Harlem around Frederick Douglass Boulevard. At the same time, some residents fought back against the powerful waves of gentrification the neighborhood is experiencing. In 2013, residents staged a sidewalk sit-in to protest a five-days-a-week farmers market that would shut down Macombs Place at 150th Street.\nUptown Night Market was founded in 2021 to celebrate cuisine, community, and culture. It is one of the largest night markets in Manhattan. The main attractions include musical performances, arts and crafts shows, and food.\nMusic.\nMany R&amp;B/Soul groups and artists formed in Harlem. The Main Ingredient, Frankie Lymon &amp; The Teenagers, Black Ivory, Cameo, Keith Sweat, Freddie Jackson, Alyson Williams, Johnny Kemp, Teddy Riley, Dave Wooley, and others got their start in Harlem.\nManhattan's contributions to hip-hop stems largely from artists with Harlem roots such as Doug E. Fresh, Big L, Kurtis Blow, The Diplomats, Mase or Immortal Technique. Harlem is also the birthplace of popular hip-hop dances such as the Harlem shake, toe wop, and Chicken Noodle Soup.\nHarlem's classical music birthed organizations and chamber ensembles such as Roberta Guaspari's Opus 118, Harlem Chamber Players, Omnipresent Music Festival BIPOC Musicians Festival, Harlem Quartet, and musicians such as violinist Edward W. Hardy.\nIn the 1920s, African-American pianists who lived in Harlem invented their own style of jazz piano, called stride, which was heavily influenced by ragtime. This style played a very important role in early jazz piano\nLanguage.\nIn 1938, jazz bandleader and singer Cab Calloway published the first dictionary by an African-American, \"Cab Calloway's Cat-ologue: A \"Hepster's\" Dictionary\", which became the official jive language reference book of the New York Public Library. In 1939, Calloway published an accompanying book titled \"Professor Cab Calloway's Swingformation Bureau\", which instructed readers how to apply the words and phrases from the dictionary. He released several editions until 1944, the last being \"The New Cab Calloway's Hepsters Dictionary: Language of Jive\". Poet Lemn Sissay observed that \"Cab Calloway was taking ownership of language for a people who, just a few generations before, had their own languages taken away.\"\nReligious life.\nReligious life has historically had a strong presence in Black Harlem. The area is home to over 400 churches, some of which are official city or national landmarks. Major Christian denominations include Baptists, Pentecostals, Methodists (generally African Methodist Episcopal Zionist, or \"AMEZ\" and African Methodist Episcopalian, or \"AME\"), Episcopalians, and Roman Catholic. The Abyssinian Baptist Church has long been influential because of its large congregation. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints built a chapel on 128th Street in 2005.\nMany of the area's churches are \"storefront churches\", which operate in an empty store, or a basement, or a converted brownstone townhouse. These congregations may have fewer than 30\u201350 members each, but there are hundreds of them. Others are old, large, and designated landmarks. Especially in the years before World War II, Harlem produced popular Christian charismatic \"cult\" leaders, including George Wilson Becton and Father Divine.\nMosques in Harlem include the Masjid Malcolm Shabazz (formerly Mosque No. 7 Nation of Islam, and the location of the 1972 Harlem mosque incident), the Mosque of Islamic Brotherhood and Masjid Aqsa. Judaism, too, maintains a presence in Harlem through the Old Broadway Synagogue. A non-mainstream synagogue of Black Hebrews, known as Commandment Keepers, was based in a synagogue at 1 West 123rd Street until 2008.\nLandmarks.\nOfficially designated landmarks.\nMany places in Harlem are official city landmarks labeled by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission or are listed on the National Register of Historic Places:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOther points of interest.\nOther prominent points of interest include:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nDemographics.\nThe demographics of Harlem's communities have changed throughout its history. In 1910, black residents formed 10% of Harlem's population, but by 1930, they had become a 70% majority. The period between 1910 and 1930 was marked by the Great Migration of African Americans from the South to northern cities, including New York. Within the city, this era also witnessed an influx of black residents from downtown Manhattan neighborhoods, where black people were feeling less welcome, to the Harlem area. The black population in Harlem peaked in 1950, with a 98% share of the population of 233,000. As of 2000, central Harlem's black residents comprised 77% of the total population of that area; however, the black population has recently declined as many African Americans move out and more immigrants move in. As of 2021, central Harlem's Black residents numbered 56,668, comprising 44% of the total population. In that regard, there are an estimated 27% (34,773) Hispanics, 18% (23,182) White, 4% (5,151) Asian, 6% (7,727) of two or more races and 2% (2,575) Other.\nHarlem suffers from unemployment rates generally more than twice the citywide average, as well as high poverty rates, and the numbers for men have been consistently worse than the numbers for women. Private and governmental initiatives to ameliorate unemployment and poverty have not been successful. During the Great Depression, unemployment in Harlem went past 20% and people were being evicted from their homes. At the same time, the federal government developed and instituted the redlining policy. This policy rated neighborhoods, such as Central Harlem, as unappealing based on the race, ethnicity, and national origins of the residents. Central Harlem was deemed 'hazardous' and residents living in Central Harlem were refused home loans or other investments. Comparably, wealthy and white residents in New York City neighborhoods were approved more often for housing loans and investment applications. Overall, they were given preferential treatment by city and state institutions.\nIn the 1960s, uneducated black people could find jobs more easily than educated ones could, confounding efforts to improve the lives of people who lived in the neighborhood through education. Land owners took advantage of the neighborhood and offered apartments to the lower-class families for cheaper rent but in lower-class conditions. By 1999 there were 179,000 housing units available in Harlem. Housing activists in Harlem state that, even after residents were given vouchers for the Section 8 housing that was being placed, many were not able to live there and had to find homes elsewhere or become homeless. These policies are examples of societal racism, also known as structural racism. As public health leaders have named structural racism as a key social determinant of health disparities between racial and ethnic minorities, these 20th century policies have contributed to the current population health disparities between Central Harlem and other New York City neighborhoods.\nCentral Harlem.\nFor census purposes, the New York City government classifies Central Harlem into two neighborhood tabulation areas: Central Harlem North and Central Harlem South, divided by 126th street. Based on data from the 2010 United States census, the population of Central Harlem was 118,665, a change of 9,574 (8.1%) from the 109,091 counted in 2000. Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of . The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 9.5% (11,322) White, 63% (74,735) African American, 0.3% (367) Native American, 2.4% (2,839) Asian, 0% (46) Pacific Islander, 0.3% (372) from other races, and 2.2% (2,651) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 22.2% (26,333) of the population. Harlem's Black population was more concentrated in Central Harlem North, and its White population more concentrated in Central Harlem South, while the Hispanic / Latino population was evenly split.\nThe most significant shifts in the racial composition of Central Harlem between 2000 and 2010 were the White population's increase by 402% (9,067), the Hispanic / Latino population's increase by 43% (7,982), and the Black population's decrease by 11% (9,544). While the growth of the Hispanic / Latino was predominantly in Central Harlem North, the decrease in the Black population was slightly greater in Central Harlem South, and the drastic increase in the White population was split evenly across the two census tabulation areas. Meanwhile, the Asian population grew by 211% (1,927) but remained a small minority, and the small population of all other races increased by 4% (142).\nThe entirety of Community District 10, which comprises Central Harlem, had 116,345 inhabitants as of NYC Health's 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 76.2 years. This is lower than the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods. Most inhabitants are children and middle-aged adults: 21% are between the ages of 0\u201317, while 35% are between 25 and 44, and 24% between 45 and 64. The ratio of college-aged and elderly residents was lower, at 10% and 11% respectively.\nAs of 2017, the median household income in Community District 10 was $49,059. In 2018, an estimated 21% of Community District 10 residents lived in poverty, compared to 14% in all of Manhattan and 20% in all of New York City. Around 12% of residents were unemployed, compared to 7% in Manhattan and 9% in New York City. Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 48% in Community District 10, compared to the boroughwide and citywide rates of 45% and 51% respectively. Based on this calculation, as of 2018[ [update]], Community District 10 is considered to be gentrifying: according to the Community Health Profile, the district was low-income in 1990 and has seen above-median rent growth up to 2010.\nOther sections.\nIn 2010, the population of West Harlem was 110,193. West Harlem, consisting of Manhattanville and Hamilton Heights, is predominately Hispanic / Latino, while African Americans make up about a quarter of the West Harlem population.\nIn 2010, the population of East Harlem was 120,000. East Harlem originally formed as a predominantly Italian American neighborhood. The area began its transition from Italian Harlem to Spanish Harlem when Puerto Rican migration began after World War II, though in recent decades, many Dominican, Mexican and Salvadoran immigrants have also settled in East Harlem. East Harlem is now predominantly Hispanic / Latino, with a significant African-American presence.\n2020 Census.\nIn the 2020 census, Harlem's demographics were broken up into North Harlem, South Harlem, Hamilton Heights, and West Harlem. North Harlem had 40,000+ Black residents being the largest concentration of the black population of the Harlem area, 20,000 to 29,999 Hispanic residents, 5,000 to 9,999 White residents, and less than 5000 Asian residents. South Harlem had 20,000 to 29,999 Black residents, 5,000 to 9,999 Hispanic residents, 10,000 to 19,999 White residents, and fewer than 5,000 Asian residents. Hamilton Heights had 10,000 to 19,999 Black residents, 20,000 to 29,999 Hispanic residents being the largest population group in this section, 5,000 to 9,999 White residents, and fewer than 5,000 Asian residents. West Harlem had an equal number of Black and Hispanic residents with each of their population at 5,000 to 9,999 residents and each the White and Asian population were fewer than 5,000 residents.\nPolice and crime.\nCentral Harlem is patrolled by two precincts of the New York City Police Department (NYPD). Central Harlem North is covered by the 32nd Precinct, located at 250 West 135th Street, while Central Harlem South is patrolled by the 28th Precinct, located at 2271\u20132289 Eighth Avenue.\nThe 28th Precinct has a lower crime rate than it did in the 1990s, with crimes across all categories having decreased by 72.2% between 1990 and 2021. The precinct reported 2 murders, 9 rapes, 172 robberies, 245 felony assaults, 153 burglaries, 384 grand larcenies, and 52 grand larcenies auto in 2021. Of the five major violent felonies (murder, rape, felony assault, robbery, and burglary), the 28th Precinct had a rate of 1,125 crimes per 100,000 residents in 2019, compared to the boroughwide average of 632 crimes per 100,000 and the citywide average of 572 crimes per 100,000.\nThe crime rate in the 32nd Precinct has also decreased since the 1990s, with crimes across all categories having decreased by 71.4% between 1990 and 2021. The precinct reported 16 murders, 18 rapes, 183 robberies, 519 felony assaults, 168 burglaries, 320 grand larcenies, and 54 grand larcenies auto in 2021. Of the five major violent felonies (murder, rape, felony assault, robbery, and burglary), the 32nd Precinct had a rate of 1,042 crimes per 100,000 residents in 2019, compared to the boroughwide average of 632 crimes per 100,000 and the citywide average of 572 crimes per 100,000.\nAs of 2018[ [update]], Community District 10 has a non-fatal assault hospitalization rate of 116 per 100,000 people, compared to the boroughwide rate of 49 per 100,000 and the citywide rate of 59 per 100,000. Its incarceration rate is 1,347 per 100,000 people, the second-highest in the city, compared to the boroughwide rate of 407 per 100,000 and the citywide rate of 425 per 100,000.\nCrime trends.\nIn the early 20th century, Harlem was a stronghold of the Sicilian Mafia, other Italian organized crime groups, and later the Italian-American Mafia. As the ethnic composition of the neighborhood changed, black criminals began to organize themselves similarly. However, rather than compete with the established mobs, gangs concentrated on the \"policy racket\", also called the numbers game, or \"bolita\" in East Harlem. This was a gambling scheme similar to a lottery that could be played, illegally, from countless locations around Harlem. According to Francis Ianni, \"By 1925 there were thirty black policy banks in Harlem, several of them large enough to collect bets in an area of twenty city blocks and across three or four avenues.\"\nBy the early 1950s, the total money at play amounted to billions of dollars, and the police force had been thoroughly corrupted by bribes from numbers bosses. These bosses became financial powerhouses, providing capital for loans for those who could not qualify for them from traditional financial institutions, and investing in legitimate businesses and real estate. One of the powerful early numbers bosses was a woman, Madame Stephanie St. Clair, who fought gun battles with mobster Dutch Schultz over control of the lucrative trade.\nThe popularity of playing the numbers waned with the introduction of the state lottery, which is legal but has lower payouts and has taxes collected on winnings. The practice continues on a smaller scale among those who prefer the numbers tradition or who prefer to trust their local numbers bank to the state.\nStatistics from 1940 show about 100 murders per year in Harlem, \"but rape is very rare\". By 1950, many whites had left Harlem and by 1960, much of the black middle class had departed. At the same time, control of organized crime shifted from Italian syndicates to local black, Puerto Rican, and Cuban groups that were somewhat less formally organized. At the time of the 1964 riots, the drug addiction rate in Harlem was ten times higher than the New York City average, and twelve times higher than the United States as a whole. Of the 30,000 drug addicts then estimated to live in New York City, 15,000 to 20,000 lived in Harlem. Property crime was pervasive, and the murder rate was six times higher than New York's average. Half of the children in Harlem grew up with one parent, or none, and lack of supervision contributed to juvenile delinquency; between 1953 and 1962, the crime rate among young people increased throughout New York City, but was consistently 50% higher in Harlem than in New York City as a whole.\nInjecting heroin grew in popularity in Harlem through the 1950s and 1960s, though the use of this drug then leveled off. In the 1980s, use of crack cocaine became widespread, which produced collateral crime as addicts stole to finance their purchasing of additional drugs, and as dealers fought for the right to sell in particular regions, or over deals gone bad.\nWith the end of the \"crack wars\" in the mid-1990s, and with the initiation of aggressive policing under mayors David Dinkins and his successor Rudy Giuliani, crime in Harlem plummeted. Compared to in 1981, when 6,500 robberies were reported in Harlem, reports of robberies dropped to 4,800 in 1990; to 1,700 in 2000; and to 1,100 in 2010. Within the 28th and 32nd precincts, there have been similar changes in all categories of crimes tracked by the NYPD.\nDespite reductions versus historic highs, Harlem continues to have a high rate of violent crime and one of the highest rates of violent crime in New York City. This crime is largely correlated with high concentrations of poverty. Illicit activities such as theft, robbery, drug trafficking, prostitution are prevalent. Criminal organizations like street gangs are responsible for many of the murders and shootings in the neighborhood.\nGangs.\nThere are many gangs in Harlem, often based in housing projects; when one gang member is killed by another gang, revenge violence erupts which can last for years. In addition, the East Harlem Purple Gang of the 1970s, which operated in East Harlem and surroundings, was an Italian American group of hitmen and heroin dealers.\nHarlem and its gangsters have a strong link to hip hop, rap and R&amp;B culture in the United States, and many successful rappers in the music industry came from gangs in Harlem. Gangster rap, which has its origins in the late 1980s, often has lyrics that are \"misogynistic or that glamorize violence\", glamorizing guns, drugs and easy women in Harlem and New York City.\nFire safety.\nCentral Harlem is served by four New York City Fire Department (FDNY) fire stations:\nFive additional firehouses are located in West and East Harlem. West Harlem contains Engine Company 47 and Engine Company 80/Ladder Company 23, while East Harlem contains Engine Company 35/Ladder Company 14/Battalion 12, Engine Company 53/Ladder Company 43, and Engine Company 91.\nHealth.\nAs of 2018[ [update]], preterm births and births to teenage mothers are more common in Central Harlem than in other places citywide. In Central Harlem, there were 103 preterm births per 1,000 live births (compared to 87 per 1,000 citywide), and 23 births to teenage mothers per 1,000 live births (compared to 19.3 per 1,000 citywide), though the teenage birth rate is based on a small sample size. Central Harlem has a low population of residents who are uninsured. In 2018, this population of uninsured residents was estimated to be 8%, less than the citywide rate of 12%.\nThe concentration of fine particulate matter, the deadliest type of air pollutant, in Central Harlem is , slightly more than the city average. Ten percent of Central Harlem residents are smokers, which is less than the city average of 14% of residents being smokers. In Central Harlem, 34% of residents are obese, 12% are diabetic, and 35% have high blood pressure, the highest rates in the city\u2014compared to the citywide averages of 24%, 11%, and 28% respectively. In addition, 21% of children are obese, compared to the citywide average of 20%.\n84% of residents eat some fruits and vegetables every day, which is less than the city's average of 87%. In 2018, 79% of residents described their health as \"good\", \"very good\", or \"excellent\", more than the city's average of 78%. For every supermarket in Central Harlem, there are 11 bodegas.\nThe nearest major hospital is NYC Health + Hospitals/Harlem in north-central Harlem.\nSocial factors.\nThe population health of Central Harlem is closely linked to influential social factors on health, also known as social determinants of health, and the impact of structural racism on the neighborhood. The impact of discriminatory policies such as redlining have contributed to residents' bearing worse health outcomes in comparison to the average New York city resident. This applies to life expectancy, poverty rates, environmental neighborhood health, housing quality, and childhood and adult asthma rates. Additionally, the health of Central Harlem residents are linked to their experience of racism. Public health and scientific research studies have found evidence that experiencing racism creates and exacerbates chronic stress that can contribute to major causes of death, particularly for African-American and Hispanic populations in the United States, like cardiovascular diseases.\nCertain health disparities between Central Harlem and the rest of New York City can be attributed to 'avoidable causes' such as substandard housing quality, poverty, and law enforcement violence \u2013 all of which are issues identified by the American Public Health Association as key social determinants of health. These deaths that can be attributed to avoidable causes are known as \"avertable deaths\" of \"excess mortality'\"in public health.\nHealth problems.\nHealth and housing conditions.\nAccess to affordable housing and employment opportunities with fair wages and benefits are closely associated with wellbeing. Public health leaders have shown that inadequate housing qualities is linked to poor health. As Central Harlem also bears the effects of racial segregation, public health researchers claim that racial segregation is also linked to substandard housing and exposure to pollutants and toxins. These associations have been documented to increase individual risk of chronic diseases and adverse birth outcomes. Historical income segregation via redlining also positions residents to be more exposed to risks that contribute to adverse mental health status, inadequate access to healthy foods, asthma triggers, and lead exposure. \nAsthma.\nAsthma is more common in children and adults in Central Harlem, compared to other New York City neighborhoods. The factors that can increase risk of childhood and adult asthma are associated with substandard housing conditions. Substandard housing conditions are water leaks, cracks and holes, inadequate heating, presence of mice or rats, peeling paint and can include the presence of mold, moisture, dust mites. In 2014, Central Harlem tracked worse in regards to home maintenance conditions, compared to the average rates Manhattan and New York City. Twenty percent of homes had cracks or holes; 21% had leaks and 19% had three or more maintenance deficiencies.\nAdequate housing is defined as housing that is free from heating breakdowns, cracks, holes, peeling paint and other defects. Housing conditions in Central Harlem reveal that only 37% of its renter-occupied homes were adequately maintained by landlords in 2014. Meanwhile, 25% of Central Harlem households and 27% of adults reported seeing cockroaches (a potential trigger for asthma), a rate higher than the city average. Neighborhood conditions are also indicators of population: in 2014, Central Harlem had 32 per 100,000 people hospitalized due to pedestrian injuries, higher than Manhattan's and the city's average.\nThe environment also factors into the health of the people of Central Harlem with the neighborhood being found to have levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) at 7.9 micrograms per cubic meter compared to all of NYC at 7.5 micrograms per cubic meter. Poorer neighborhoods have some of the highest levels of air pollution in the city. Adults with asthma emergencies experiencing high rates of poverty visit the emergency department at rates nearly 5 times higher than those neighborhoods with lower levels of poverty. Nearly 3 in 4 deaths related to PM2.5 occurs in adults 65 years or older. The attribution of premature adult mortality rate to exposure of PM2.5 experiencing 77.4\u2013117.7 deaths per 100,000 people.\nAdditionally, poverty levels can indicate one's risk of vulnerability to asthma. In 2016, Central Harlem saw 565 children aged 5\u201317 years old per 10,000 residents visiting emergency departments for Asthma emergencies, over twice both Manhattan's and the citywide rates. The rate of childhood asthma hospitalization in 2016 was more than twice that of Manhattan and New York City, with 62 hospitalizations per 10,000 residents. Rates of adult hospitalization due to asthma in Central Harlem trends higher in comparison to other neighborhoods. In 2016, 270 adults per 10,000 residents visited the emergency department due to asthma, close to three times the average rates of both Manhattan and New York City.\nOther health problems.\nHealth outcomes for men have generally been worse than those of women. Infant mortality was 124 per thousand in 1928, meaning that 12.4% of infants would die. By 1940, infant mortality in Harlem was 5%, and the death rate from disease generally was twice that of the rest of New York. Tuberculosis was the main killer, and four times as prevalent among Harlem citizens than among the rest of New York's population.\nA 1990 study of life expectancy of teenagers in Harlem reported that 15-year-old girls in Harlem had a 65% chance of surviving to the age of 65, about the same as women in Pakistan. Fifteen-year-old men in Harlem, on the other hand, had a 37% chance of surviving to 65, about the same as men in Angola; for men, the survival rate beyond the age of 40 was lower in Harlem than Bangladesh. Infectious diseases and diseases of the circulatory system were to blame, with a variety of contributing factors, including consumption of the deep-fried foods traditional to the South, which may contribute to heart disease.\nPost offices and ZIP Codes.\nHarlem is located within five primary ZIP Codes. From south to north they are 10026 (from 110th to 120th Streets), 10027 (from 120th to 133rd Streets), 10037 (east of Lenox Avenue and north of 130th Street), 10030 (west of Lenox Avenue from 133rd to 145th Streets) and 10039 (from 145th to 155th Streets). Harlem also includes parts of ZIP Codes 10031, 10032, and 10035. The United States Postal Service operates five post offices in Harlem:\nEducation.\nCentral Harlem generally has a similar rate of college-educated residents to the rest of the city as of 2018[ [update]]. While 42% of residents age 25 and older have a college education or higher, 19% have less than a high school education and 39% are high school graduates or have some college education. By contrast, 64% of Manhattan residents and 43% of city residents have a college education or higher. The percentage of Central Harlem students excelling in math rose from 21% in 2000 to 48% in 2011, and reading achievement increased from 29% to 37% during the same time period.\nCentral Harlem's rate of elementary school student absenteeism is higher than the rest of New York City. In Central Harlem, 25% of elementary school students missed twenty or more days per school year, more than the citywide average of 20%. Additionally, 64% of high school students in Central Harlem graduate on time, less than the citywide average of 75%.\nSchools.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe New York City Department of Education operates the following public elementary schools in Central Harlem:\nThe following middle and high schools are located in Central Harlem:\nHarlem has a high rate of charter school enrollment: a fifth of students were enrolled in charter schools in 2010. By 2017, that proportion had increased to 36%, about the same that attended their zoned public schools. Another 20% of Harlem students were enrolled in public schools elsewhere.\nHigher education.\nThe CUNY Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy, New York College of Podiatric Medicine, City College of New York, and Touro College of Osteopathic Medicine, in addition to a branch of College of New Rochelle, are all located in Harlem.\nLibraries.\nThe New York Public Library (NYPL) operates four circulating branches and one research branch in Harlem, as well as several others in adjacent neighborhoods.\nOther branches include the 125th Street and Aguilar branches in East Harlem and the George Bruce and Hamilton Grange branches in western Harlem.\nTransportation.\nBridges.\nThe Harlem River separates the Bronx and Manhattan, necessitating several spans between the two New York City boroughs. Five free bridges connect Harlem and the Bronx: the Willis Avenue Bridge (for northbound traffic only), Third Avenue Bridge (for southbound traffic only), Madison Avenue Bridge, 145th Street Bridge, and Macombs Dam Bridge. In East Harlem, the Wards Island Bridge, also known as the 103rd Street Footbridge, connects Manhattan with Wards Island. The Triborough Bridge is a complex of three separate bridges that offers connections between Queens, East Harlem, and the Bronx.\nPublic transportation.\nPublic transportation service is provided by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. This includes the New York City Subway and MTA Regional Bus Operations. Some Bronx local routes also serve Manhattan, providing customers with access between both boroughs. Metro-North Railroad has a commuter rail station at Harlem\u2013125th Street, serving trains to the Lower Hudson Valley and Connecticut.\nSubway.\nHarlem is served by the following subway lines:\nIn addition, several other lines stop nearby:\nPhase 2 of the Second Avenue Subway is also planned to serve East Harlem, with stops at 106th Street, 116th Street, and Harlem\u2013125th Street.\nBus.\nHarlem is served by numerous local bus routes operated by MTA Regional Bus Operations:\nRoutes that run near Harlem, but do not stop in the neighborhood, include:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "54862", "revid": "50953818", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54862", "title": "Downing Street", "text": "Street in London, England\nDowning Street is a gated street in Westminster in London that houses the official residences and offices of the prime minister of the United Kingdom and the chancellor of the exchequer in a cul-de-sac situated off Whitehall, it is long, and a few minutes' walk from the Houses of Parliament. Downing Street was built in the 1680s by Sir George Downing.\nFor more than three hundred years, it has held the official residences of both the First Lord of the Treasury, the office now synonymous with that of the Prime Minister, and the Second Lord of the Treasury, the office held by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The Prime Minister's official residence is 10 Downing Street, and the Chancellor's official residence is Number 11. The government's Chief Whip has an official residence at Number 12. Over time, government offices and officials came to occupy most of the street's townhouses. The houses on the south side of the street were demolished in the 19th century to make way for government offices now occupied by the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office. Opposite, for part of the street, the Cabinet Office, initially Treasury, was built to face Whitehall.\nThe term \"Downing Street\" is also used as a metonym for the Prime Minister or the British Government more generally.\nHistory.\nThe street was built in the 1680s by Sir George Downing, 1st Baronet, on the site of a mansion, Hampden House. Little is known about what was on the site before the mansion, but there is evidence of a brewhouse called 'The Axe', owned by the Abbey of Abingdon, and the premises of the goldsmith Everard Everdyes.\nDowning was a soldier and diplomat who served under Oliver Cromwell and King Charles II, and who invested in properties and acquired considerable wealth. In 1654, he purchased the lease on land east of St James's Park, adjacent to the House at the Back, and within walking distance of Parliament. Downing planned to build a row of townhouses \"for persons of good quality to inhabit\". However, the Hampden family had a lease which prevented their construction for 30 years. When the Hampden lease expired, Downing received permission to build further west to take advantage of recent developments. The new warrant issued in 1682 reads: \"Sir George Downing ... [is authorised] to build new and more houses further westward on the grounds granted him by the patent of 1663/4 Feb. 23. The present grant is by reason that the said Cockpit or the greater part thereof is since demolished; but it is to be subject to the proviso that it be not built any nearer than 14 feet of the wall of the said Park at the West end thereof.\"\nBetween 1682 and 1684, Downing built the cul-de-sac of two-storey townhouses with coach-houses, stables and views of St James's Park. How many he built is not clear; most historians say 15, others say 20. The addresses changed several times; Number 10 was numbered 5 for a while, and was renumbered in 1787. Downing employed Sir Christopher Wren to design the houses. Although large, they were put up quickly and cheaply on soft soil with shallow foundations. The fronts had facades with lines painted on the surface imitating brick mortar. Winston Churchill wrote that Number 10 was \"shaky and lightly built by the profiteering contractor whose name they bear\".\nThe upper end of the Downing Street cul-de-sac closed access to St James's Park, making the street quiet and private. An advertisement in 1720 described it as \"a pretty open Place, especially at the upper end, where are four or five very large and well-built Houses, fit for Persons of Honour and Quality; each House having a pleasant Prospect into St James's Park, with a Tarras Walk\". The houses had several distinguished residents. The Countess of Yarmouth lived at Number 10 between 1688 and 1689, Lord Lansdowne from 1692 to 1696 and the Earl of Grantham from 1699 to 1703. The diarist James Boswell took rooms in Downing Street during his stay in London during 1762\u201363 at a rent of \u00a322 per annum. He records having dealings with prostitutes in the adjacent park.\nDowning probably never lived in his townhouses. In 1675, he retired to Cambridge, where he died a few months after the houses were completed. His portrait hangs in the entrance foyer of the modern Number 10.\nDowning College, Cambridge was founded in 1800, under the terms of the will of Sir George Downing, 3rd Baronet (died 1749). A door from Number 10 is in use in the college.\nThe houses between Number 9 and Whitehall were acquired by the government and demolished in 1824 to allow the construction of the Privy Council Office, Board of Trade and Treasury offices. In 1861, the houses on the south side of Downing Street were replaced by purpose-built government offices for the Foreign Office, India Office, Colonial Office, and the Home Office.\nHouses.\nThe houses at the end of the street were arranged around Downing Square.\nThere used to be a public house, the Rose and Crown, in Downing Street. In 1830 the tenant was a Mr Dixon.\nThroughout the history of these houses, ministers have lived by agreement in whatever rooms they thought necessary. On some occasions Number 11 has been occupied not by the Chancellor of the Exchequer but by the individual considered to be the nominal deputy Prime Minister (whether or not they actually took the title); this was particularly common in coalition governments. Sometimes a minister only uses the Downing Street flat for formal occasions and lives elsewhere.\nIn 1881, William Ewart Gladstone claimed residence in numbers 10, 11 and 12 for himself and his family. He was both Chancellor of the Exchequer and Prime Minister at the time.\nAfter the 1997 general election, in which Labour took power, a swap was carried out by the new incumbents of the two titles; Tony Blair being a married man with three children living at home, while his counterpart Gordon Brown was unmarried at the time of taking up his post. Although Number 10 was the Prime Minister's official residence and contained the prime ministerial offices, Blair and his family actually moved into the more spacious Number 11, while Brown lived in the more meagre apartments of Number 10. This was the second time this had occurred; Stafford Northcote lived in Number 10 at one point, while Benjamin Disraeli occupied Number 11. That was for precisely the same reason\u2014at the time, Number 11 was the more spacious apartment and Sir Stafford had a larger family. Blair and Brown's arrangement continued between Brown (at Number 11) and Alistair Darling (at Number 10), and continued in the Cameron ministry (with David Cameron at Number 11 and George Osborne at Number 10) and under the premiership of Theresa May, with Theresa May at Number 11 and Philip Hammond at Number 10. Boris Johnson similarly resided at Number 11.\nSecurity gates.\nBarriers were erected at the St James's Park end of the street for the unveiling of the Cenotaph on 11 November 1920. They were a public safety measure intended to prevent the crowds in Whitehall becoming too dense.\nWhen the movement for Irish independence became increasingly violent, it was decided to retain the barriers, which were raised and strengthened. On 26 November 1920 construction commenced on a wooden barricade, high at the end of the street. They were described as being of a \"substantial character\" mounted on proper foundations and incorporated vehicle gates. The barriers were taken down in 1922 when the Irish Free State was created.\nVehicle access was curtailed in 1973 when metal barriers were placed across the entrance to the street. In 1974, the Metropolitan Police proposed erecting a semi-permanent barrier between the pavement and carriageway on the Foreign Office side to keep pedestrians off the main part of the street. The proposal came with assurances that tourists would still be permitted to take photographs at the door of Number 10. The Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, rejected the proposal, feeling that it would appear to be an unacceptable restriction of the freedom of the public. Wilson's private secretary wrote \"I much regret this further erosion of the Englishman's right to wander at will in Downing Street.\"\nIn 1982 access was further restricted by railings and a demountable gate. They were replaced by black steel gates in 1989. The increase in security was due to an increase in violence, particularly by the IRA during The Troubles. The Thatcher ministry was particularly moved to increase security after the 1979 Assassination of Lord Mountbatten.\nAccess through these gates led to a political scandal known as Plebgate (or Gategate), which started in September 2012. The trigger was an altercation between Conservative Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell, and the police officers on duty at these gates. Mitchell had to resign as the Government Chief Whip because of the incident.\nOn the afternoon of 25 May 2023 the gates were damaged when a car crashed into them. The Prime Minister was inside 10 Downing Street at the time. A man was arrested by police and the incident was not terrorism related.\nPublic right of way.\nTechnically speaking, the public right of way along Downing Street has not been extinguished nor subject to a gating order and the road retains the status of a public highway maintained by Westminster City Council. Public access was curtailed by relying on common law powers to prevent breach of the peace (although its legality has been questioned by a correspondent for \"New Statesman\" magazine). In 2005, Westminster City Council used anti-terrorism powers contained in the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 to formalise the restrictions by means of a traffic management order. This by implication results in Downing Street being inaccessible to the general public as admittance is only granted by the Police to scheduled visitors, Parliamentary pass holders and members of the accredited press.\nAlthough the Downing Street government buildings and grounds are a designated site under the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 for criminal trespass, the street was not included in the boundaries of the designated area.\nSecurity.\nSince 1989, entering Downing Street has required passing through a security checkpoint. The street is patrolled by armed police from the Diplomatic Protection Group, and there is usually at least one police officer outside the front door of Number 10. Security was tightened after 10 Downing Street was mortar bombed by the IRA in 1991 and again after the 11 September attacks.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The current officeholder, the 110th in the sequence of regular mayors, is Eric Adams, a member of the Democratic Party. The mayor-elect is Zohran Mamdani, also a Democrat, who will be sworn in on January 1, 2026.\nDuring the Dutch colonial period from 1624 to 1664, New Amsterdam was governed by the Director of New Netherland. Following the 1664 creation of the British Province of New York, newly renamed New York City was run by the British military governor, Richard Nicolls. The office of Mayor of New York City was established in 1665. Holders were appointed by colonial governors, beginning with Thomas Willett. The position remained appointed until 1777. That year, during the American Revolution, a Council of Appointment was formed by the State of New York. In 1821 the New York City Council \u2013 then known as the Common Council \u2013 began appointing mayors. Since 1834, mayors have been elected by direct popular vote.\nThe city included little beyond the island of Manhattan before 1874, when it annexed the western part of the Bronx, to be followed in 1895 by the rest of the Bronx. The 1898 consolidation created the city as it is today with five boroughs: Queens, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Staten Island and the Bronx. The first mayor of the expanded city was Robert Anderson Van Wyck.\nThe longest-serving mayors have been Fiorello H. La\u00a0Guardia (1934\u20131945), Robert F. Wagner Jr. (1954\u20131965), Ed Koch (1978\u20131989) and Michael Bloomberg (2002\u20132013), each of whom was in office for twelve years (three successive four-year terms). The shortest terms in office since 1834 have been those of acting mayors: William T. Collins served a single day on December 31, 1925, Samuel B. H. Vance served one month (from November 30 to December 31, 1874), and Thomas Coman served five weeks (from Monday, November 30, 1868, to Monday, January 4, 1869).\nColonial mayors (1665\u20131783).\nBefore 1680, mayors served one-year terms. From 1680, they served two-year terms. Exceptions are noted thus (*). A dagger (\u2020) indicates mayoralties cut short by death in office.\nNote\n\u2020 \"died in office\"\nPre-consolidation mayors (1784\u20131897).\nThe mayor continued to be selected by the Government of New York's Council of Appointment until 1821, when Stephen Allen became the first mayor appointed by a local Common Council. Under the Charter of 1834, mayors were elected annually by direct popular vote. Starting in 1849, mayors were elected to serve two-year terms.\nNotes\n\u2020 \"died in office\"\nPost-consolidation mayors (since 1897).\nThe 1898\u20131901 term was for four years. The City Charter was changed to make the mayor's term a two-year one beginning in 1902, but after two such terms was changed back to resume four-year terms in 1906. George B. McClellan Jr. thus served one two-year term from 1904 to 1905, during which he was elected to a four-year term from 1906 to 1909. Since then, mayors have had to be elected with the support of all five boroughs: Queens, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Staten Island, and the Bronx.\nThe party of the mayor reflects party registration, as opposed to the party lines run under during the general election.\nMayor-elect.\nNotes\n\u2020 \"died in office\"\nList of living former mayors.\nThere are three living former mayors.\nAppendices.\nMayoral terms and term limits in New York City since 1834.\nDirect elections to the mayoralty of the unconsolidated City of New York began in 1834 for a term of one year, extended to two years after 1849. The 1897 Charter of the consolidated City stipulated that the mayor was to be elected for a single four-year term. In 1901, the term halved to two years, with no restrictions on reelection. In 1905, the term was extended to four years once again. (Mayors Fiorello La\u00a0Guardia, Robert F. Wagner Jr., Ed Koch and Michael Bloomberg were later able to serve for twelve years each.) In 1993, the voters approved a two-term (eight-year) limit, and reconfirmed this limit when the issue was submitted to referendum in 1996. In 2008, the New York City Council voted to change the two-term limit to three terms (without submitting the issue to the voters). Legal challenges to the Council's action were rejected by Federal courts in January and April 2009. However, in 2010, yet another referendum, reverting the limit to two terms, passed overwhelmingly.\n\"Principal source:\" \"The Encyclopedia of New York City\" especially the entries for \"charter\" and \"mayoralty\".\nInterrupted terms.\nMayors John T. Hoffman (1866\u20131868, elected Governor 1868), William Havemeyer (1845\u20131846, 1848\u20131849, and 1873\u20131874), William Jay Gaynor (1910\u20131913), John Francis Hylan (1918\u20131925), Jimmy Walker (1926\u20131932), and William O'Dwyer (1946\u20131950) failed to complete the final terms to which they were elected. The uncompleted mayoral terms of Hoffman, Walker, and O'Dwyer were added to the other offices elected in (respectively) 1868, 1932, and 1950. Those three elections are listed as \"special\" in the table below because they occurred before the next regularly scheduled \"mayoral\" election; the \"regular\" mayoral elections of 1874 and 1913, on the other hand, were held on the same day that they would have happened had the mayoralty not become vacant.\n\u2020 Became acting mayor as the president of the board of aldermen or (in 1950) city council.\nMayors of the City of Brooklyn, 1834\u20131897.\nBrooklyn elected a mayor from 1834 until consolidation in 1898 into the City of Greater New York, whose own second mayor (1902\u20131903), Seth Low, had been Mayor of Brooklyn from 1882 to 1885. Since 1898, Brooklyn has, in place of a separate mayor, elected a Borough President.\nMayors of Long Island City, 1870\u20131897.\nLong Island City, now within the Borough of Queens, was incorporated as a city in its own right on May 4, 1870 and (like the City of Brooklyn) consolidated into the present Greater New York City on January 1, 1898.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was also a composer, poet and vocalist.\nBiography.\nRazaf was born in 1895 in Washington, D.C., United States. His birth name was Andriamanantena Paul Razafinkarefo. He was the son of Henri Razafinkarefo, nephew of Queen Ranavalona III of the Imerina kingdom in Madagascar, and Jennie Razafinkarefo (n\u00e9e Waller), daughter of John L. Waller, the first African American consul to Imerina. The French invasion of Madagascar (1894\u201395) left Henri dead, and forced pregnant 15-year-old Jennie to escape to the U.S. Razaf was raised in Harlem, Manhattan.\nAt age 16, Razaf quit school and took a job as an elevator operator in a Tin Pan Alley office building. A year later he penned his first song text, embarking on his career as a lyricist. During this time he spent many nights in the Greyhound Lines bus station in Times Square, and picked up his mail at the Gaiety Theatre office building, which was considered the black Tin Pan Alley.\nSome of Razaf's early poems were published in 1917\u201318 in the Hubert Harrison-edited \"Voice\", the first newspaper of the \"New Negro Movement\". He was a contributor to and editor of the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League's \"Negro World\" newspaper.\nRazaf's most important collaborator was Fats Waller. Among the best-known Razaf-Waller songs are \"Ain't Misbehavin'\", \"Honeysuckle Rose\", \"The Joint Is Jumpin'\", \"Willow Tree\", \"Keepin' Out of Mischief Now\" and \"(What Did I Do to Be So) Black and Blue\". Razaf also worked with other composers including Eubie Blake, James P. Johnson, J. C. Johnson, Don Redman and Harry Brooks. His songs were played by them and other songwriter-performers, as well as by Cab Calloway, Benny Goodman and many other musicians. He wrote a number of raunchy \"character\" blues-type songs that were sung by many 1920s female blues singers.\nThough primarily a lyricist, Razaf wrote both the words and the music of many songs, though none became as well known as his collaborations with other composers.\nRazaf also made many recordings as a vocalist, of both his own songs and others', most in the late 1920s, as a soloist (sometimes on ukelele) and with musicians including James P. Johnson and Fletcher Henderson.\nHe married Annabelle Miller in 1915 but abandoned her within a few years. He was married to Jean Blackwell Hutson from 1939 to 1947, to Dorothy Carpenter from 1948 to around 1960, and to Alicia Wilson Georgiade from 1963 until his death.\nIn 1972, Razaf was recognized by his Tin Pan Alley peers when he was inducted in the Songwriters Hall of Fame. He died in North Hollywood, California, in February 1973 from renal failure, aged 77.\nSongs.\nThe Songwriters Hall of Fame entry for Andy Razaf lists 215 compositions, giving co-writers and publishers.

{"id": "54879", "revid": "38473817", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54879", "title": "Five Barbarians", "text": "Chinese historical exonym\nThe Five Barbarians, or Wu Hu (), is a Chinese historical exonym for five ancient non-Han \"Hu\" peoples who immigrated to northern China in the Eastern Han dynasty, and then overthrew the Western Jin dynasty and established their own kingdoms in the 4th\u20135th centuries. The peoples categorized as the Five Barbarians were:\nOf these five tribal ethnic groups, the Xiongnu and Xianbei were nomadic peoples from the northern steppes. The ethnic identity of the Xiongnu is uncertain, but the Xianbei appear to have been Mongolic. The Jie, another pastoral people, may have been a branch of the Xiongnu, who may have been Yeniseian or Iranian. The Di and Qiang were from the highlands of western China. The Qiang were predominantly herdsmen and spoke Sino-Tibetan (Tibeto-Burman) languages, while the Di were farmers who may have spoken a Sino-Tibetan or Turkic language.\nAlthough the term \"Five Barbarians\" is often used alongside the Sixteen Kingdoms, there were in fact more than five relevant ethnic groups during the period, such as the Dingling and Wuhuan. Patrilineally, the ruling family of Cheng-Han descended from the Bandun Man, also known as Cong (\u8ce8), but are referred to as Ba-Di as they mingled with the Di tribes. The Juqu clan of Northern Liang, though often classed as Xiongnu, were of Lushuihu ethnicity, while Gao Yun, who can either be interpreted as the last ruler of Later Yan or first ruler of Northern Yan, was an ethnic Goguryeo. \nDefinition.\nChronologicaly, the earliest usage of the phrase \"Five Barbarians\" or \"Wu Hu\" (\u4e94\u80e1) comes from an edict written by the Empress Dowager, Chu Suanzi, when she terminated her regency in favour for her son, Emperor Mu of Jin in 357. Her edict can be found in the \"Book of Jin\", which was compiled in 648 during the Tang dynasty. The lead editor of the record, Fang Xuanling, also mentioned the \"Five Barbarians\" in his evaluation of Emperor Yuan of Jin, but it is unclear which groups they were supposed to represent. Other expressions that generally refer to the non-Chinese groups during this period include the \"Four Barbarians (\u56db\u5937)\" and \"Six Barbarians (\u516d\u5937)\".\nAdditionally, the \"Spring and Autumn Annals of the Sixteen Kingdoms\" (501\u2013522) also contains a quote in 385 by the Former Qin ruler, Fu Jian, that uses the \"Five Barbarians\" terminology. Modern historians like Chen Yinke and Zhou Yiliang believe that the \"Five Barbarians\" in this case was simply in reference to the \"Five Virtues of Beginning and End\", a theoretical concept often invoked by Chinese dynasties to legitimize their reigns.\nThe Five Barbarians were only categorized during the 12th century in the Southern Song dynasty, when the official, Hong Mai wrote an essay titled \"Wuhu Luanhua\" (\u4e94\u80e1\u4e82\u83ef; \"Upheaval of the Five Barbarians\") in his book, \"Rongzhai Suibi\" (\u5bb9\u9f4b\u96a8\u7b46). Even so, he did not properly define the term, as the seven rulers he mentioned only accounted for four non-Han groups, namely the Xiongnu, Jie, Xianbei and Di. A later Southern Song official, Wang Yinglin defined the Five Barbarians as \"Liu Yuan's Xiongnu, Shi Le's Jie, Murong-Xianbei, Fu Hong's Di and Yao Chang's Qiang.\" Hu Sanxing's annotation of the Zizhi Tongjian affirms Wang Yinglin's view by listing the five as the Xiongnu, Jie, Xianbei, Di and Qiang, after which it became widely accepted.\nThey were a mix of tribes from various stocks, such as proto-Mongolic, Turkic, Tibetan and Yeniseian. Others divide them into two Turkic tribes, one Tungusic tribe, and two Tibetan tribes, and yet others into Tibetan and Altaic (proto-Mongolian and early Turkic). While later historians determined that there were more than five, the Five Barbarians has become a collective term for all northern and western non-Han groups that lived during the Jin dynasty (266\u2013420) and Sixteen Kingdoms period.\nFive Barbarians.\nSince the later Han dynasty, northern China was home to various ethnic groups from the north and west. These peoples were subjects of the Han, taking up agriculture and serving in the military force. While many of them retained their respective tribal identity, they also underwent various degrees of Sinicization. By the Western Jin period, their population had grown substantially, becoming a cause for concern among a few officials within the imperial court as they began to revolt. There were calls to have the tribes relocated outside the borders, most notably by the minister Jiang Tong in his essay, \"Xi Rong Lun\" (\u5f99\u620e\u8ad6; Discussion on Relocating the Rong Tribe), but these proposals were disregarded. As central authority collapsed due to the War of the Eight Princes, many of these \"barbarians\" rebelled alongside their Han Chinese compatriots in the Upheaval of the Five Barbarians, although there were also those who initially fought on the side of Jin. Throughout the 4th century and early-5th century, several states were founded by the \"Five Barbarians\" in northern China and Sichuan, collectively known as the Sixteen Kingdoms.\nXiongnu.\nRuling over the steppes of East Asia, the Xiongnu empire was once a powerful adversary to the Han dynasty, but by the 1st century AD, their power had greatly declined due to defeats to the Han, internal power struggles and natural disasters. In 50 AD, a few years after the empire was split into two, the Southern Xiongnu branch became a vassal to the Han. The court of the chanyu was moved to Xihe Commandery in Bing province while their people were resettled across the frontier commanderies within the Great Wall. The Southern Xiongnu served the Han by helping them to guard the northern borders, even assisting in destroying the rival Northern Xiongnu. However, tension was evident between the two sides. Being economically dependant on the Han and with the Han court interfering in their politics, the Southern Xiongnu would frequently rebel on the frontiers.\nIn 216, the warlord Cao Cao abolished the chanyu office and divided the Southern Xiongnu into Five Divisions around Taiyuan Commandery. From this point onwards, the Xiongnu declined as a coherent identity, as the Five Divisions became dominated by the Chuge branch, while those excluded mixed with tribes from other ethnicities and were vaguely referred to as \"hu\" and other terms for the non-Chinese. The \"barbarian\" tribes of Bing province underwent varying degrees of sinicization; many among the Five Divisions adopted \"Liu\" as their surname, claiming that their Xiongnu ancestors had married Han princesses through \"heqin\", and their nobility were even allowed to hold government offices under the Western Jin dynasty. Nonetheless, they continued to resent the ruling Chinese dynasties due to their lower status and privileges.\nThough the Xiongnu were no longer a unified entity by the 4th-century, their descendants continued to invoke their ancestors as a form of legitimacy. In 304, at the height of the War of the Eight Princes, Liu Yuan of the Five Divisions rebelled and founded the Han-Zhao dynasty. He claimed direct descent from the Southern Xiongnu chanyus and, by extension, the Han princesses, as he portrayed his state as a restoration of the Han dynasty. The Tiefu tribe also descended from a member of the Southern Xiongnu imperial family, but had intermingled with the Xianbei and were pushed out from Bing to the Hetao region. When their member, Helian Bobo founded the Helian Xia dynasty in 407, he began emphasising his Xiongnu lineage to claim descent from the Xia dynasty, which the Xiongnu traditionally regarded as their ancestors.\nJie.\nThe Jie were one of the many miscellaneous \"hu\" tribes in Bing province. The most famous Jie, Shi Le, was a descendant of the Qiangqu tribe (\u7f8c\u6e20) of the Southern Xiongnu. Their exact origins is still debated by modern scholars, as theories range from them originating from the Tocharian or Eastern Iranian people of Sogdia to the Yeniseian people, but with no general consensus. When a great famine broke out in Bing province in 303, many of the Jie and other \"hu\" people were displaced before being captured and sold into slavery by the provincial inspector. The Jie and \"hu\" were thus scattered throughout Hebei and Shandong.\nDespite their seemingly small population, the Jie were thrusted into prominence by Shi Le, who founded the Later Zhao dynasty in 319. The Later Zhao dominated northern China for a majority of its existence before its demise in 351. Following Ran Min's culling order and the wars that followed the Later Zhao collapse, the Jie ceased to appear in records, though some key figures in later history may have descended from them.\nXianbei.\nWhen the Xiongnu empire defeated them in the 3rd century BC, the Donghu people splintered into the Xianbei and Wuhuan. The Xianbei began occupying the Mongolian plateau in around 93 AD after the Northern Xiongnu were forced to the northwest by the Han dynasty. In the mid-2nd century, the chieftain, Tanshihuai unified the Xianbei and launched incessant raids on the Han's northern borders. Following his death, however, his descendants failed to maintain the support of the chieftains and his confederation fell apart. In the northeast, several Xianbei tribes near the border became Chinese vassals and were allowed to live within the Great Wall such as the Murong and Tuoba tribes after the defeat of the Wuhuan at the Battle of White Wolf Mountain in 207. Others migrated west to live around the Hexi Corridor, with a branch of the Murong even subjugating the Qiang people of Qinghai and founding the Tuyuhun.\nAt the height of the Jin princely civil wars, the Inspector of You province, Wang Jun allied himself with the local Xianbei and Wuhuan tribes, most notably the Duan-Xianbei who was granted a dukedom in Liaoxi Commandery for their services. The Xianbei were a deciding factor in the civil wars, and when the Han-Zhao broke away from Jin, the Tuoba joined forces with Jin and were also given a dukedom in Dai Commandery. Meanwhile, the Murong in Liaodong, isolated from the conflicts of the Central Plains, expanded their influence in the region by providing refuge to fleeing Chinese officials and peasants. As the Jin were pushed out of northern China, however, the Xianbei distanced themselves from Jin and established full autonomy over their fiefdoms.\nThe Xianbei founded several states during the Sixteen Kingdoms period. The Murong were a prominent player during this period, as they founded the Former Yan, Later Yan, Western Yan and Southern Yan that ruled over the Central Plains. After the Battle of Fei River, the Qifu and Tufa tribes in the Hexi founded the Western Qin and Southern Liang, respectively, competing for control over the region among themselves and other rival claimants. Most importantly, the Tuoba of Dai later founded the Northern Wei dynasty, which reunified the north in 439 and ushered China into the Northern and Southern dynasties period.\nDi.\nThe Di were a semi-nomadic people that resided in the western provinces of Gansu, Shaanxi and Sichuan. In 111 BC, the Han dynasty expanded westwards and established Wudu Commandery where the Di mainly resided, causing them to spread out in northern and western China. The Di tribes became Han tributaries, and relations between the two were mostly stable until the fall of Han, when the Di began to frequently rebel. In 219, the warlord Cao Cao had 50,000 Di people relocated from Wudu commandery to Tianshui and Fufeng commanderies to deter them from allying with his rival to the south, Liu Bei.\nThe Di in the northwest continued to rebel during the Western Jin dynasty. Between 296 and 299, Qi Wannian, a Di chieftain, led the various non-Han groups in rebellion, devastating the Guanzhong region and displacing many of the population. The Di that fled south into the Hanzhong and Sichuan basins founded the Chouchi and Cheng-Han regimes, although the Li clan that ruled the latter were more specifically referred to as Ba-Di. The Fu clan that remained behind later founded the Former Qin dynasty, most notable for briefly unifying northern China under Fu Ji\u0101n. During the Qin collapse that followed the Battle of Fei River, the Di general, L\u00fc Guang founded the Later Liang in Gansu.\nQiang.\nThe term \"Qiang\" broadly referred to groups of western semi-nomadic people from Qinghai and Gansu. Since the Western Han period, many of the Qiang submitted to the Chinese court and were allowed to settle in the Guanzhong region and the watersheds of the Wei and Jing rivers, where they practiced agriculture and lived with Han Chinese settlers. The Qiang were not a unified entity, and their various tribes often fought among themselves. However, the Qiang also faced oppression by the local Han governors and officials, leading to frequent large-scale rebellions in the northwest that adversely affected the Han military and economy. The Qiang also fought as soldiers for the Han and later for the Cao Wei and Shu Han during the Three Kingdoms period.\nThe Qiang continued to participate in rebellions in the northwest against the Western Jin dynasty, but it would not be until after the Battle of Fei River that they established their first and only state of the Sixteen Kingdoms under the Later Qin dynasty. The second ruler of Later Qin, Yao Xing, was a key proponent in the spread of Buddhism by making it his state religion and sponsoring the influential Buddhist translator, Kum\u0101raj\u012bva. The Qiang also founded the minor polities of Dangchang and Dengzhi.\nOther non-Han groups.\nLushuihu.\nThe Lushuihu (\u76e7\u6c34\u80e1; Lu River Barbarians) were an ethnic group that were distributed between Zhangye in modern-day Gansu and central Shaaxi. Their origin is still debated by scholars today; \"Lushuihu\" may have just been a generic term for the \"hu\" tribes that lived in northwestern China, but there is also a theory that they were descendants of the Lesser Yuezhi that intermingled with the Qiang people. The Juqu clan of the Northern Liang dynasty were of Lushuihu ethnicity, but as their ancestors once served under the Xiongnu empire, they have been classified in more recent historiographies as \"Xiongnu\" to fit the Five Barbarians terminology.\nBa Cong.\nThe region of Ba in eastern Sichuan was home to the Bandun Man, who were also known as the Cong people (\u8ce8\u4eba) as their taxes were collected by the Han dynasty in the form of a money called \"cong\" (\u8ce8). Many of the Cong moved north to Hanzhong to become followers of the Way of the Five Pecks of Rice, but after Cao Cao conquered the region in 215, they were resettled further north to L\u00fceyang Commandery, where they mingled with the local Di people. These people became known as the Ba-Di, with Ba referring to their ancestral homeland. The Li clan of Ba-Di ethnicity later moved back to Sichuan during Qi Wannian's rebellion, where they founded the Cheng-Han dynasty in 304. Later, the Ba chieftain, Gou Quzhi led the Ba and other tribes in Guanzhong against the Han-Zhao dynasty in 320.\nDingling.\nThe Dingling were a nomadic people that originally lived south of Lake Baikal and were vassals of the Xiongnu empire. A branch of the Dingling migrated west and resided in Kangju, becoming known as the Western Dingling, before moving into China. During the Sixteen Kingdoms period, the Zhai clan of the Western Dingling were one of the earliest groups to rebel against the Former Qin after their defeat at the Battle of Fei River, and in 388, they founded the short-lived Zhai Wei dynasty, which is not considered as one of the Sixteen Kingdoms. The Dingling that remained behind on the northern steppes were later known at the Chile, Gaoche or Tiele people.\nGoguryeo.\nGoguryeo was one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea and a rival to the Murong-Xianbei during the Sixteen Kingdoms period. During its invasion of Goguryeo in 342, the Former Yan captured several members of the Goguryeo imperial family and resettled them in Qingshan (\u9752\u5c71, in modern Jinzhou, Liaoning). One of them, Gao Yun, served the Later Yan dynasty and eventually overthrew the Murong. Historians either consider him to be the last ruler of Later Yan or the first ruler of Northern Yan, though his successors were from the Feng clan of Han Chinese ethnicity. According to the \"Xi Rong Lun\", there were also several Goguryeo families living in Xingyang since the Cao Wei period following the Wei campaigns against Goguryeo.\nWuhuan.\nMuch like the Xianbei, the Wuhuan was another group that splintered from the Donghu people. Since the 2nd century BC, the Han dynasty allowed them to settle in the northeastern commanderies of Shanggu, Yuyang, Youbeiping, Liaodong and Liaoxi in exchange for their military services. During the fall of Han, the Wuhuan looked to establish their own dominion, but their power was broken after Cao Cao defeated them at the Battle of White Wolf Mountain in 207. Many of the Wuhuan were relocated further south in China, and they gradually lost their cultural identity as they assimilated with the Han Chinese and Xianbei that filled the power vacuum. The Wuhuan continued to appear during the Jin dynasty and Sixteen Kingdoms period, but their name had become a generic term for \"hu\" tribes with Donghu backgrounds. They fought as auxiliaries for the Jin during the War of the Eight Princes and Upheaval of the Five Barbarians, and there were several fortified settlements (\u5862\u5821; \"wubao\") in northern China that were led by the Wuhuan during the Later Yan dynasty period.

He was succeeded by his ten-year-old son Birger Magnusson with Torkel Knutsson acting as his guardian.\nMedieval Swedish kings did not use regnal numbers as part of their title. In modern literature he may be referred to as either Magnus I or Magnus III.\nEpithet.\nThe origin of the epithet \"Ladul\u00e5s\" (lit.\u2009'Barnlock') is not known for certain, due to the lack of source material from the latter half of the 14th century. It appears widely in written documents from the beginning of the 15th century, with the Visby Chronicle from 1412 being the oldest datable document. \"Lilla rimkr\u00f6nikan\" from c.\u20091450 gives the traditional explanation, ascribing the epithet to the Ordinance of Alsn\u00f6. This act by Magnus freed the yeomanry from the duty to provide sustenance for travelling nobles and bishops, and \"locked the barns\".\nAnother theory is that \"Ladul\u00e5s\" is a corruption of a second name \"Ladislaus,\" the Latin equivalent of the Slavic name \"Vladislav.\" (Magnus's maternal great-grandmother was Sophia of Minsk, a Rurikid princess.)\"\"\nEarly life.\nMagnus was born around 1240 as the second son of Birger Jarl (1200\u201366) and Princess Ingeborg, daughter of King Erik Knutsson and sister of King Erik Eriksson of Sweden. The early life of Magnus is poorly documented, but he seems to have received an extensive education.\nErik Eriksson ruled until 1250 and died without an heir. After his death, Magnus' elder brother Valdemar (1239\u20131302) became king, but the true power was held by their father Birger Jarl who acted as a regent. In 1255, Magnus was granted the title of a , 'junior jarl'.\nWhen Birger died in 1266, Magnus assumed his title as the Duke of Sweden. The title was not accompanied by any unified territory, but by a number of scattered estates and rights to collect taxes and fines. He also received Nyk\u00f6ping Castle in S\u00f6dermanland. \nThere is no indication that he would have received the powers of his father. According to the Erik's Chronicle, Magnus wanted to share the Royal power with his brother, which led to a conflict.\nAccession and marriage.\nIn 1275, Duke Magnus started a rebellion against Valdemar, supported by his younger brother Erik and King Eric Klipping of Denmark. Valdemar was deposed by Magnus after the Battle of Hova in the forest of Tiveden on 14 June 1275 with the help of Danish and German horsemen. In July, Magnus was elected king at the Stones of Mora.\nIn 1276, Magnus married Helvig, daughter of Gerard I of Holstein. Through her mother, Elizabeth of Mecklenburg, Helvig was a descendant of Christina, the putative daughter of King Sverker II. A papal annulment of Magnus' alleged first marriage and a dispensation for the second (necessary because of consanguinity) were issued ten years later, in 1286. Helvig later acted as regent, probably 1290\u20131302 and 1320\u20131327.\nReign.\nThe deposed King Valdemar managed, with Danish help in turn, to regain provinces in G\u00f6taland in the southern part of the kingdom, and Magnus had to recognize that in 1277. However, Magnus regained them about 1278 and assumed the additional title \"rex Gothorum\", King of the Goths, starting the tradition of \"King of the Swedes and the Goths\".\nKing Magnus's youngest brother, Bengt (1254\u20131291), then archdeacon, acted as his Lord High Chancellor of Sweden, and in 1284 Magnus rewarded him with the Duchy of Finland.\nMagnus died when his sons were yet underage. Magnus ordered his kinsman Torkel Knutsson, the Lord High Constable of Sweden as the guardian of his heir, the future King Birger, who was about ten years old at father's death.\nModern research.\nIn spring 2011, archaeologists and osteologists from the Stockholm University were granted permission to open one of the royal tombs in the Riddarholmen Church, traditionally believed to contain the remains of Magnus Ladul\u00e5s and some of his relatives. An osteological and odontological examination revealed the presence of five male and two female skeletons. Preliminary studies indicated a notable sickly disposition in one skeleton, previously presumed to belong to Magnus Ladul\u00e5s based on descriptions of his ailments. Contrary to expectations, radiocarbon dating indicated that the skeletons were from the 15th and early 16th centuries, and could not belong to the king and his family.\nIn 2012, the research team was permitted to open the adjacent tomb, traditionally believed to contain King Karl Knutsson (c. 1408\u20131470). The analysis showed that these remains were from the 15th and early 16th century, and one skeleton matched the expected profile for King Karl. The location of Magnus Ladul\u00e5s's grave remains unresolved. In 2014, the team discovered a previously unknown brick chamber between the two tombs, but further excavation was halted due to legal and administrative challenges.\nIssue.\nFrom his alleged first (annulled) marriage to an unknown woman:\nFrom his second marriage to Helvig of Holstein:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

One of the richest men in the world during his lifetime, Zaharoff was described as both a \"merchant of death\" and a \"mystery man of Europe\". His success was forged through his cunning, often aggressive and sharp, business tactics. These included the sale of arms to opposing sides in conflicts, sometimes delivering fake or faulty machinery and skilfully using the press to attack business rivals.\nZaharoff maintained close contacts with many powerful political leaders, including British Prime Minister David Lloyd George, Greek Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos and Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II.\nEarly life.\nZacharias was the only son and eldest of four children of Basilius Zacharoff (d. 1878) of Constantinople, a Greek notary, commodity dealer and importer of attar of roses and his (reportedly blind) wife, Helena Antonides (d. 1879). Zacharias was born in the Ottoman Empire town of Mente\u015fe in southwest Turkey. His family lived in Russia for over two decades as exiles following the anti-Greek \"Easter pogroms\" of 1821. While there they adopted the surname Zaharoff. They returned to the Ottoman Empire in the 1840s and, by 1855, had returned to Constantinople's Greek neighbourhood of Tatavla.\nZacharias' first job was as a tour guide in the Galata. It is thought he became an arsonist with Constantinople's fire brigades, who were paid to recover or salvage treasures for their wealthy owners.\nHe was summoned to court in London due to irregular exports of goods from Constantinople to London. The London Greeks from Constantinople preferred disputes involving members of their community to be settled outside English courts, and he was discharged on the conditions that he paid \u00a3100 restitution to the claimant and remained within the court's jurisdiction. Instead, he immediately left for Athens, where the 24-year-old Zaharoff was befriended by a political journalist, Etienne Skouloudis. The eloquent Zaharoff succeeded in convincing Skouloudis of the rightness of his London court case. Skouloudis was a friend of a Swedish captain who was about to leave his job as an agent of arms manufacturer Thorsten Nordenfelt. Skouloudis used his influence to recommend Zaharoff for the role. Zaharoff was hired on 14 October 1877, beginning a spectacular career. The political and military instability in the Balkan states, Turkey and Russia provided an excellent opportunity for the arms sales, as each state spent to match the perceived aggressive intentions of its neighbours, even after the 1878 Treaty of Berlin.\nArms dealing.\nZaharoff did not make arms dealing his sole business at first. After Cyprus passed under British control in 1878 he returned to the United Kingdom; by 1883 he was working as a shipping agent in Galway, Ireland, where he recruited local girls for work in American factories. He also had a spell in the United States where he worked as a confidence man, and later as a salesman for a St. Louis railcar business. In 1885, posing as \"Prince Zacharias Basileus Zacharoff\", he married a Philadelphia heiress, Jennie Billings, and was pursued to Rotterdam by detectives after his exposure as a bigamist by a Briton who recognised him as the same man who had married a British girl in Bristol in 1872.\nZaharoff sold munitions to many nations, including Great Britain, Germany, the Russian and Ottoman Empires, Greece, Spain, Japan and the United States. Despite his reputation for corruption, he was instrumental in marketing military equipment, including various famous weapons such as the Maxim gun (one of the first fully automatic machine guns) and the first working submarine. The British-Swedish Nordenfelt produced a range of anti-torpedo boat guns in Erith, Kent, Stockholm and Spain.\nZaharoff worked for Vickers, the munitions firm, from 1897 to 1927.\nMaxim machine gun.\nHiram Maxim's automatic machine gun was a significant improvement over the then-current hand-cranked rotary barrel models. Maxim's gun was better than anything that Nordenfelt sold at the time. Zaharoff is believed to have had a hand in the events surrounding Maxim's attempts to demonstrate his invention between 1886 and 1888. In the first, Maxim's and Nordenfelt's machine guns were to be demonstrated at La Spezia, Italy, before a distinguished audience which included the Duke of Genoa. Maxim's representatives did not show up; a person unknown had waylaid them with a tour of La Spezia's nocturnal establishments leaving them unfit for purpose the next morning.\nRound two took place at Vienna, where the exhibitors were instructed to modify their weapons to comply with Austrian Infantry-standard sized cartridges. After shooting a few hundred rounds, the Maxim gun became erratic before stopping altogether. When Maxim took one weapon apart to see what had happened, he discovered that they had been sabotaged, but it was too late to repair. A third demonstration also took place in Vienna, and here the gun worked perfectly but again an unknown person went through the gathering of senior officers, convincing them that the workmanship required to produce such a marvellous weapon could be achieved only by hand, one at a time, and that without the means for mass production, Maxim could never produce machine guns in sufficient quantities to satisfy the needs of a modern army. Nordenfelt and Zaharoff had won. Maxim, who knew he had a good product, successfully sought a merger with Nordenfelt, engaging Zaharoff as their principal salesman on a huge commission.\nUnder pressure from Rothschild and Vickers, Thorsten Nordenfelt merged with Maxim's in 1888 to form the Maxim Nordenfelt Guns and Ammunition Company. Two years later, a bankrupt Nordenfelt was forced out of the company.\nSubmarines.\nFrom 1886 to 1889, at the same time that Zaharoff got the Maxim machine gun, he managed to appropriate Isaac Peral's submarine; although these facts are less well known. Zaharoff and Nordenfelt tried at this time to develop a submarine for their own business purposes.\nOne of the most notorious sales by Zaharoff was that of the \"Nordenfelt I\", a faulty steam-driven submarine model based on a design by the English inventor and clergyman George Garrett, which US Navy intelligence characterized as capable of \"dangerous and eccentric movements.\" Thorsten Nordenfelt had already demonstrated his vessel at an international gathering of the military elite, and while the major powers would have none of it, smaller nations, attracted by the prestige, were a different matter.\nIt was thus that, with a promise of generous payment terms, Zaharoff sold the first model to the Greeks. He then persuaded the Turks that the Greek submarine posed a threat, selling them two. After that, he persuaded the Russians that there was now a new and significant threat on the Black Sea, and they bought another two.\nNone of these submarines ever saw action. The mechanics, driven by steam propulsion, were completely inadequate for underwater navigation, and failed demonstrably when undergoing sea trials by the respective navies. Besides the underlying problems of the faulty propulsion system, they were also chronically unstable. One of the Turkish Navy's submarines sank, capsizing during a torpedo firing test. The vessel reared in a vertical position, from which it sank by the stern.\nAt this time Spanish inventor Isaac Peral designed and built the first submarine capable of navigating underwater with a decent level of control and with the ability to launch torpedoes both submerged and on the surface. This was the first proper submarine, solving the problems of propulsion, stability and armament all at once. Peral's submarine was driven by electric propulsion, and had a periscope, target practice apparatus, compensating compass needle, gyroscope, sliding electric torpedo tube launcher and servomotor (to maintain the stability and the trim of the ship in all circumstances).\nZaharoff found out quickly about this young Spanish Naval officer's invention. Previously in shipbuilding, he had already seen the plans and memorandum reports sent by Peral to the Spanish Navy's HQ at the Defence Ministry.\nLater on, during Peral's visit to London, Zaharoff tried meeting with him unsuccessfully, with the help of one of Peral's Spanish Navy fellow officers. Peral refused twice, but after several attempts, he had a meeting with Thorsten Nordenfelt, the company owner, who offered him a deal to purchase the patent of the stability servomotor. Isaac Peral rejected both offers but signed his sentence in that same instant, without knowing it.\nZaharoff then got to work with his own Machiavellian plan. The Spanish inventor, as with Maxim, suffered four sabotages during the tests: the first of them, in the previous test, in the presence of the Head of the Spanish State, but, Peral, more cautious than the North American inventor, proved successful in all of them.\nDespite this, Zaharoff used underhand methods, which came to light later, and was able to cause a controversy between the inventor and his own government leading to the Spanish Government's disapproval of this submarine invention, although it would have been a formidable weapon in the conflict with the United States, several years after.\nZaharoff traveled to Spain several times between 1886 and 1890 with three objectives: boycott Peral's submarine, sell weapons to the Spanish Army, and acquire a Spanish munitions factory. He was successful in all three objectives, mainly because his initiation of an amorous relationship with Pilar de Muguiro y Beruete opened many doors for him.\nPilar's father, influential banker Ferm\u00edn Muguiro, Count of Muguiro, was a close friend of the King, and leader of the Spanish Conservative Party. She was a personal friend and niece of Segismundo Moret, a leading Spanish progressive thinker and the Liberal Party Leader's right-hand man. Unhappily married to King Alfonso XII's cousin, the Spanish Grandee, Francisco de Borb\u00f3n, Duke of Marchena, she had unrestricted access to the Royal Palaces. During one trip, Zaharoff was spotted at the shipyard where the Spanish submarine was being built, but the Spanish authorities \"covered up\" the matter.\nThe acquisition of one of the best Spanish armament companies, Euskalduna, located in north Spain and renamed \"Placencia de las Armas Co. Ltd\" was in large part thanks to his love affair (later attributing his professional success to his sexual prowess), and through establishing a powerful network among Spanish politicians, journalists and military commanders, who served his business interests well. This influential group of people took his side against the development of Isaac Peral's submarine, and the Spanish Government, despite the astounding success in sea trials, finally pulled the rug from the project.\nAfter \"Placencia de Armas Co. Ltd\" swindled the Spanish Government by selling useless arms during the 1898 War (also handing Maxim important and \"sensitive\" information, which reached his government during the conflict), the Sociedad Espa\u00f1ola de Construcciones Navales in Spain, a branch of Vickers were awarded, by the Spanish Government, exclusive naval construction rights for the Spanish Navy.\nIn the aftermath of this scandal, accusations of bribery and manipulation flew in the direction of this dangerous trafficker of weapons. A Spanish Navy lawyer denounced the Spanish Government for two alleged crimes of \"prevarication.\" The Spanish Government acted expeditiously and especially cruelly against any naval officers who went public with their discontent. The Central Chief of Staff and the head of the Armada Juridic Service were fired, and hundreds of officers were imprisoned and lost their jobs.\nOther corrupt business tactics.\nZaharoff's power and influence in Spain lasted until his death in 1936, the year in which the Spanish Civil War began.\nAlso, the 1934 United States Senate Nye Committee Memorandum shows that Zaharoff was paid considerable sums for transactions made between foreign companies and the Spanish Government (for example, he got paid between a 5 and 7% commission for the price of American submarines sold to Spain, throughout all these years).\nAlthough very little could be proved, Zaharoff was viewed as a master of bribery and corruption, but the few incidents that did become public, such as the large bribes received by Japanese Admiral Fuji in the 1914 Siemens scandal, indicated that a lot more was going on behind the scenes. In 1890, the Maxim-Nordenfelt association broke up, and Zaharoff chose to go with Maxim. Using his commissions, Zaharoff bought shares in Maxim's company until he was in a position to tell Maxim that he was no longer an employee, but an equal shareholder.\nBy 1897, the Maxim company had become important enough that it received a buyout offer from Vickers, one of the then giants of the armaments industry. This involved substantial settlements in both cash and shares for Maxim and Zaharoff. From then until 1911, while Maxim's business enthusiasm waned, Zaharoff's enthusiasm grew, and he expanded his portfolio of Vickers shares. After Maxim's retirement, Zaharoff was appointed to Vickers' board of directors.\nThe 1900s (decade) was a time for many European armies to rebuild and modernize. Germany and the United Kingdom both sought improved naval capability, and Vickers, with Zaharoff, were willing and able to service both sides. After its disastrous defeat by Japan in 1905, the Russian Navy also needed new equipment, but Russia was handcuffed by a wave of protectionism that required domestic industry for the rebuilding. Zaharoff's response was to build a huge Russian arms production complex at Tsaritsyn as a subsidiary of Vickers.\nThe opening of Russian Tsarist archives after World War I led to some insights into the tactics of the arms industry. One 1907 letter, in particular, was written from the Paul von Gontard Factory (a secretly-controlled Vickers company in Germany) to a Vickers-associate in Paris recommending that press releases be sent out to the French press suggesting that the French improve their military to meet the threat posed by German re-armament. These French newspaper articles were recorded by the Reichstag, and instigated a vote to increase military spending, all of which worked to the advantage of Zaharoff.\nWorld War I.\nIn the years immediately preceding World War I, Zaharoff's fortunes grew in other areas to support his arms business. By purchasing the \"L'Union Parisienne des Banques\" (Union Parisienne Bank), which was historically associated with heavy industry, he was better able to control his financing arrangements. By gaining control of \"Excelsior\", the popular French daily newspaper, he could guarantee favourable editorials for the arms industry. To gain public recognition and acclaim, he founded a retirement home for ex-French Navy sailors, while a chair in Aerodynamics at the University of Paris led to further honours.\nIn April 1914, Australian newspapers published reports from London dated 25 April that M. Zaharoff had donated \u00a320,000 \"in order to enable France to be worthily represented at the forthcoming Olympic Games in Berlin\" in 1916. The 1916 Olympic Games were subsequently cancelled because of the war. Zaharoff's donation represented a substantial contribution. On 10 May, the French Government announced it would donate \u00a36,000 to its Olympic team, and would distribute \u00a312,000 of Zaharoff's donation among its Olympic teams, with the remaining \u00a38,000 to \"the furtherance of the Olympic cause.\"\nOn 31 July 1914, coincidentally the same day that the noted antimilitarist Jean Jaur\u00e8s was assassinated, Raymond Poincar\u00e9 signed a decree appointing Zaharoff a Commander of the Legion of Honour.\nIn March 1914, Vickers announced a new dawn of prosperity. During the course of the war, Vickers would produce 4 ships of the line, 3 cruisers, 53 submarines, 3 auxiliary vessels, 62 light vessels, 2,328 cannon, 8,000,000 tonnes of steel ordnance, 90,000 mines, 22,000 torpedoes, 5,500 airplanes and 100,000 machine guns. By 1915, Zaharoff had close ties with both David Lloyd George and Aristide Briand. It is reported that, on the occasion of one visit with Briand, Zaharoff surreptitiously left an envelope on Aristide Briand's desk; the envelope contained a million francs for war widows.\nOne of Zaharoff's tasks during the Great War was to ensure that Greece joined the war on the Allied side, helping to reinforce the eastern front. On the surface, this seemed impossible since King Constantine was a brother-in-law of the Kaiser. Setting up a press agency in Greece to publicise British propaganda contacted by Wellington House, Zaharoff led, within a few months, to King Constantine's overthrow by Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos and Greek entry into the war as an ally of the British Empire.\nIn 1917 and 1918, on the behest of David Lloyd George, Zaharoff initiated a series of secret peace negotiations with the Ottoman Empire, beginning on 18 July 1917. The British hoped Zaharoff could convince the Three Pashas to abandon the Central Powers and make a separate peace with the Allies. \nBy the end of World War I, \"The Times\" estimated that Zaharoff had laid out \u00a350\u00a0million in the Allied cause.\nPost-war dealings.\nIn the years that followed, Zaharoff involved himself in the affairs of the lesser powers, which the Big Four, involved in remaking Europe, could happily ignore. In particular, he set out to ensure that Greece and Venizelos received a proper share from the spoils from the badly weakened Turkey. In 1920, he donated half a billion gold francs to the Greek State for the Greek cause (Megali Idea). Zaharoff convinced Venizelos to attack but, after some impressive initial success, the Greek Army was eventually driven back. In the elections that followed, Constantine's loyalists managed to force Venizelos to flee, but Zaharoff stayed around to persuade the same King that he had to attack Turkey again but with Mustafa Kemal now in charge of Turkey, this venture was bound to fail. Zaharoff's war adventures were not well received by the press in Paris and London.\nZaharoff was also involved in two more significant financial ventures in October 1920, becoming involved in the incorporation of a company that was a predecessor to oil giant BP. He foresaw that there was a great future in the oil business.\nHis association with Prince Louis II of Monaco led to his purchase of the debt-ridden \"Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Bains de Mer\", which ran the world-famous Monte Carlo Casino and was the principal source of revenue for the principality. He succeeded in returning the casino to profit again. At the same time, Zaharoff had prevailed upon Clemenceau to ensure that the Treaty of Versailles included protection of Monaco\u2019s rights as established in 1641. Louis had noted their gradual erosion over the subsequent three centuries.\nPersonal life.\nZaharoff was fascinated by aviation, and gave money and other support to pioneers in Great Britain, France and Russia. He encouraged Hiram Maxim's attempt to build a flying machine, and claimed he and Maxim were the first men to be lifted off the earth, when Maxim tested his first \"flying machine\" at Bexley in 1894.\nZaharoff was a good friend of fellow Greek Jacques Damala, from the noble Zaccaria de Damal\u00e0 family, and his wife, world famous stage actress Sarah Bernhardt, and took in Damala's illegitimate daughter with a theatre extra after she was left in a basket on Bernhardt's doorstep. Eventually, this girl was baptised \"Tereza\" (1889\u20131967) and was raised by a surrogate family that Zaharoff found for her in Adrianople, in Eastern Thrace, later becoming a socialite in royal Athens society, and an impactful lover of both Ernest Hemingway, who called a her a \"Greek princess\", and Gabriele d'Annunzio, as well getting acquainted with Benito Mussolini, and serving as a model for Pablo Picasso in the early 20th century. The life of Tereza Damalas, including having been Zaharoff's ward and lifelong friend was the subject of the historical novel \"Tereza\", by Greek journalist .\nIn September 1924, Zaharoff, 74, married his mistress Mar\u00eda del Pilar Antonia Angela Patrocinio Fermina Simona de Muguiro y Beruete, 55, in her own right 1st Duchess de Villafranca de los Caballeros. Previously married to a cousin of the King of Spain Alfonso XII, the Duchess was reputed to be one of the richest women in Spain.\nAbout eighteen months after their marriage, the Duchess died of an infection, on 24 February 1926 in Monte Carlo. He then began selling his business assets and drafted his memoirs. He apparently burnt the manuscript after it was stolen by a valet and recovered by police.\nZaharoff's country house, the Ch\u00e2teau de Balincourt, at Arronville near Paris, was formerly the property of King Leopold II of Belgium and was filled with works of art and one of the most beautiful in France.\nPrincess Marthe Bibesco claimed Basil Zaharoff was an illegitimate son of her maternal grandfather.\nPhilanthropy.\nZaharoff was a major financial benefactor to various institutions:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was a member of Parliament (MP) from 1979 to 2004, representing suburban Vancouver-area constituencies in the city of Burnaby for the New Democratic Party (NDP). He was the first member of Parliament in Canadian history to come out as gay while in office. In 2004, he pleaded guilty to stealing an expensive ring and decided not to run in the June 2004 election. At the time, he was one of the longest-serving members in the House of Commons, having been elected and re-elected for seven consecutive terms. In the 2019 Canadian federal election, Robinson was the NDP candidate for the riding of Burnaby North\u2014Seymour but lost to Liberal incumbent Terry Beech by 1,560 votes.\nEarly life.\nRobinson was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States, of Danish descent, to Edith Jensen and Wayne Robinson. His father opposed the Vietnam War and brought his family to live in Canada. Robinson attended high school at Burnaby North Secondary. He later obtained a law degree from the University of British Columbia, and completed post-graduate work in international law at the London School of Economics.\nHe was called to the British Columbia Bar as a barrister and solicitor in 1978, and practised law with Robert Gardner and Associates until his election to the House of Commons in May 1979.\nPrior to coming out as gay, Robinson was married to Patricia Fraser, his high-school girlfriend, from 1972 to 1975.\nPolitics.\nRobinson was the NDP MP for ridings in the Vancouver suburb of Burnaby, British Columbia, the third-largest city in British Columbia.\nAs the longest-serving British Columbia MP of his time, in office from 1979 to 2004, Robinson is notable for having been the first Canadian MP to come out as gay, in the spring of 1988. He was the only openly LGBT member of the Canadian House of Commons until Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois MP R\u00e9al M\u00e9nard came out in 1994.\nRobinson is known for his negative views on American foreign policy, especially towards Cuba, his challenge of corporate power, his criticism of Israel, and his strong support for Palestinian leaders. NDP leader Alexa McDonough briefly removed Robinson's portfolio over Middle East issues in 2002 for comments he made criticizing the Israeli government for alleged war crimes in Jenin.\nOne of his earliest political activities was leading a group of NDP MPs who heckled former US President Ronald Reagan while he was speaking at the House of Commons in support of the Strategic Defense Initiative and aid to the Contras. He was a long-time activist in the anti-apartheid movement and was a member of the official Canadian delegation to the 1994 South African election. Robinson has also been critical of the Chinese government for its treatment of political dissidents and for its policies in Tibet. He was a founder of the Canadian wing of Parliamentarians for East Timor. He was active in international parliamentary groups, including serving as rapporteur and chair of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe's Parliamentary Assembly Human Rights and Development Committee.\nRobinson was a leader in the movement for the right to physician-assisted death, fighting for the right of well-known ALS patient Sue Rodriguez to choose when to end her life with the assistance of a physician. He was ultimately present at her bedside at the time of her physician-assisted death.\nA strong environmentalist, he engaged in peaceful civil disobedience to block logging of old-growth forests at Lyell Island in Haida Gwaii in 1985 and at Clayoquot Sound on the west coast of Vancouver Island in 1993. For the latter action, he was sentenced to 14 days of imprisonment. Robinson was also an outspoken advocate of the rights of aboriginal peoples both in Canada and internationally. He stood at barricades with the Penan people in Sarawak, Malaysia and was condemned by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. He was adopted into the Haida Nation, and given the Haida name \"White Swan\" by Haida elder Ada Yovanovich.\nRobinson ran to succeed Audrey McLaughlin as leader of the NDP at the 1995 NDP leadership convention. He won the first ballot, and had won regional primaries in Ontario, Quebec, and British Columbia. Ahead of the second ballot between himself and Alexa McDonough, Robinson noticed last-place candidate Lorne Nystrom's delegates were moving disproportionately to McDonough. Realizing that McDonough would likely pick up enough support from Nystrom's delegates to eliminate any realistic chance of him winning, Robinson conceded to McDonough before the second ballot. On a motion by Robinson, McDonough was acclaimed as leader.\nOn December 31, 1997, Robinson was injured in a hiking accident on Galiano Island, breaking his jaw and ankle.\nRobinson was involved in the New Politics Initiative, an effort to build a new progressive political party in Canada closely linked with social movements and labour, and the NDP's renewal process, although he remained committed to the party after the NPI's defeat at the 2001 general convention in Winnipeg. He was an early and strong supporter of former national NDP Leader Jack Layton.\nIn 2003, Liberal Senator Jerry Grafstein suggested that September 11 be designated as \"America Day\" to commemorate the American victims of September 11, 2001. Robinson proposed that the day also be designated as \"Chile Day\", to mark the overthrow of Chilean president Salvador Allende's democratically elected government on September 11, 1973. Neither proposal was accepted.\nRobinson successfully sponsored legislation in parliament in 2004 to include sexual orientation in federal hate crimes legislation. He was also active on HIV/AIDS issues from the start of the epidemic in the early 1980s.\nAdmission to theft and end of political career.\nIn April 2004, shortly before the 2004 election, Robinson admitted to the theft of an expensive ring from a public auction site. He turned himself in to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and returned the ring shortly after police visited his home and office, wishing to speak with him. While the auction company publicly stated that they did not wish to pursue charges, Robinson was charged and pleaded guilty. The Crown and defence agreed that he was undergoing major personal stress and mental health issues at the time; Robinson was given a discharge, meaning that he would have no criminal record, but he volunteered for some time at the Burnaby Wildlife Centre as part of a public service commitment. He terminated his candidacy and was replaced by his longtime constituency assistant Bill Siksay, who won the election.\nRobinson was subsequently diagnosed with cyclothymia, a form of bipolar disorder, and began to speak as an activist on mental health issues.\nRobinson attempted a comeback and ran as an NDP candidate in the 2006 federal election, challenging Liberal MP Hedy Fry in the riding of Vancouver Centre. Despite an improved result for the NDP provincewide, Fry easily won reelection in her riding, where the NDP vote fell by 3.6 per cent.\nIn the 2019 Canadian General Election Robinson was nominated as the NDP candidate in Burnaby North\u2014Seymour, where he faced Liberal incumbent Terry Beech and lost by 1,560 votes.\nPost-political career.\nSince leaving politics, Robinson was employed by the British Columbia Government and Service Employees' Union as an arbitrator and advocate. He also served on the NDP's federal executive as co-chair of the party's LGBT Committee.\nRobinson took a position in 2007 with the global trade union federation Public Services International in Switzerland, where he moved with his partner Max Riveron. He led PSI's work on a range of issues including climate change, pensions, and trade. In 2009, he was co-chair of the International LGBT Human Rights Conference in Copenhagen, and received an award from the Conseil qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois des gais et lesbiennes for his human rights activism.\nHe served as a consultant with the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, coordinating their parliamentary relations. He retired from the organization when he reached its mandatory retirement age of 65.\nIn 2020\u201321, Robinson was the J.S. Woodsworth resident scholar at Simon Fraser University. The position was named after the former CCF leader and MP J. S. Woodsworth.\nIn the 2026 New Democratic Party leadership election, Robinson supported Avi Lewis.\nElectoral record.\nBurnaby North\u2014Seymour; 2019.\n! colspan=\"9\"|2019 Canadian federal election: Burnaby North\u2014Seymour\n! colspan=\" style=\"width:\" bgcolor=\"\" |\n! width=\"250px\" |Candidate\n! width=\"48px\" |Votes!! width=\"43px\" |%!! width=\"52px\" |&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Tooltip/styles.css\" /&gt;!! width=\"90px\" |Expenditures\nVancouver Centre; 2006.\n! colspan=\"9\"|2006 Canadian federal election: Vancouver Centre\n! colspan=\" style=\"width:\" bgcolor=\"\" |\n! width=\"250px\" |Candidate\n! width=\"48px\" |Votes!! width=\"43px\" |%!! width=\"52px\" |&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Tooltip/styles.css\" /&gt;!! width=\"90px\" |Expenditures\nBurnaby\u2014Douglas;1997-2004.\n! colspan=\"9\"|2000 Canadian federal election\n! colspan=\" style=\"width:\" bgcolor=\"\" |\n! width=\"250px\" |Candidate\n! width=\"48px\" |Votes!! width=\"43px\" |%!! width=\"52px\" |&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Tooltip/styles.css\" /&gt;!! width=\"90px\" |Expenditures\n! colspan=\"9\"|1997 Canadian federal election\n! colspan=\" style=\"width:\" bgcolor=\"\" |\n! width=\"250px\" |Candidate\n! width=\"48px\" |Votes!! width=\"43px\" |%!! width=\"90px\" |Expenditures\nBurnaby\u2014Kingsway; 1988\u20131997.\n! colspan=\"9\"|1993 Canadian federal election\n! colspan=\" style=\"width:\" bgcolor=\"\" |\n! width=\"250px\" |Candidate\n! width=\"48px\" |Votes!! width=\"43px\" |%!! width=\"52px\" |&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Tooltip/styles.css\" /&gt;\n! colspan=\"9\"|1988 Canadian federal election\n! colspan=\" style=\"width:\" bgcolor=\"\" |\n! width=\"250px\" |Candidate\n! width=\"48px\" |Votes!! width=\"43px\" |%\nBurnaby; 1979\u20131988.\n! colspan=\"9\"|1984 Canadian federal election\n! colspan=\" style=\"width:\" bgcolor=\"\" |\n! width=\"250px\" |Candidate\n! width=\"48px\" |Votes!! width=\"43px\" |%!! width=\"52px\" |&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Tooltip/styles.css\" /&gt;\n! colspan=\"9\"|1980 Canadian federal election\n! colspan=\" style=\"width:\" bgcolor=\"\" |\n! width=\"250px\" |Candidate\n! width=\"48px\" |Votes!! width=\"43px\" |%!! width=\"52px\" |&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Tooltip/styles.css\" /&gt;\n! colspan=\"9\"|1979 Canadian federal election\n! colspan=\" style=\"width:\" bgcolor=\"\" |\n! width=\"250px\" |Candidate\n! width=\"48px\" |Votes!! width=\"43px\" |%\nBiography.\n\"Svend Robinson: A Life in Politics\", written by Graeme Truelove, was released on October 17, 2013, by New Star Books.

{"id": "54888", "revid": "7611264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54888", "title": "Telomere", "text": "Region of repetitive nucleotide sequences on chromosomes\nA telomere (; from grc \" ' ()\"\u00a0'end' and \" ' ()\"\u00a0'part') is a region of repetitive nucleotide sequences associated with specialized proteins at the ends of linear chromosomes (see Sequences). Telomeres are a widespread genetic feature most commonly found in eukaryotes. In most or even all species possessing them, they protect the terminal regions of chromosomal DNA from progressive degradation and ensure the integrity of linear chromosomes by preventing DNA repair systems from mistaking the very ends of the DNA strand for a double-strand break.\nDiscovery.\nThe existence of a special structure at the ends of chromosomes was independently proposed in 1938 by Hermann Joseph Muller, studying the fruit fly \"Drosophila melanogaster\", and in 1939 by Barbara McClintock, working with maize. Muller observed that the ends of irradiated fruit fly chromosomes did not present alterations such as deletions or inversions. He hypothesized the presence of a protective cap, which he coined \"telomeres\", from the Greek \"telos\" (end) and \"meros\" (part).\nIn the early 1970s, Soviet theorist Alexey Olovnikov first recognized that chromosomes could not completely replicate their ends; this is known as the \"end replication problem\". Building on this, and accommodating Leonard Hayflick's idea of limited somatic cell division, Olovnikov suggested that DNA sequences are lost every time a cell replicates until the loss reaches a critical level, at which point cell division ends. According to his theory of marginotomy, DNA sequences at the ends of telomeres are represented by tandem repeats, which create a buffer that determines the number of divisions that a certain cell clone can undergo. Furthermore, it was predicted that a specialized DNA polymerase (originally called a tandem-DNA-polymerase) could extend telomeres in immortal tissues such as germ line, cancer cells and stem cells. It also followed from this hypothesis that organisms with circular genome, such as bacteria, do not have the end replication problem and therefore do not age.\nOlovnikov suggested that in germline cells, cells of vegetatively propagated organisms, and immortal cell populations such as most cancer cell lines, an enzyme might be activated to prevent the shortening of DNA termini with each cell division.\nIn 1975\u20131977, Elizabeth Blackburn, working as a postdoctoral fellow at Yale University with Joseph G. Gall, discovered the unusual nature of telomeres, with their simple repeated DNA sequences composing chromosome ends. Blackburn, Carol Greider, and Jack Szostak were awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of how chromosomes are protected by telomeres and the enzyme telomerase.\nStructure and function.\nEnd replication problem.\nDuring DNA replication, DNA polymerase cannot replicate the sequences present at the 3' ends of the parent strands. This is a consequence of its unidirectional mode of DNA synthesis: it can only attach new nucleotides to an existing 3'-end (that is, synthesis progresses 5'-3') and thus it requires a primer to initiate replication. On the leading strand (oriented 5'-3' within the replication fork), DNA-polymerase continuously replicates from the point of initiation all the way to the strand's end with the primer (made of RNA) then being excised and substituted by DNA. The lagging strand, however, is oriented 3'-5' with respect to the replication fork so continuous replication by DNA-polymerase is impossible, which necessitates discontinuous replication involving the repeated synthesis of primers further 5' of the site of initiation (see lagging strand replication). The last primer to be involved in lagging-strand replication sits near the 3'-end of the template (corresponding to the potential 5'-end of the lagging-strand). Originally it was believed that the last primer would sit at the very end of the template, thus, once removed, the DNA-polymerase that substitutes primers with DNA (DNA-Pol \u03b4 in eukaryotes) would be unable to synthesize the \"replacement DNA\" from the 5'-end of the lagging strand so that the template nucleotides previously paired to the last primer would not be replicated. It has since been questioned whether the last lagging strand primer is placed exactly at the 3'-end of the template and it was demonstrated that it is rather synthesized at a distance of about 70\u2013100 nucleotides which is consistent with the finding that DNA in cultured human cell is shortened by 50\u2013100 base pairs per cell division.\nIf coding sequences are degraded in this process, potentially vital genetic information would be lost. Telomeres are non-coding, repetitive sequences located at the termini of linear chromosomes to act as buffers for those coding sequences further behind. They \"cap\" the end-sequences and are progressively degraded in the process of DNA replication.\nThe \"end replication problem\" is exclusive to linear chromosomes as circular chromosomes do not have ends lying without reach of DNA-polymerases. Most prokaryotes, relying on circular chromosomes, accordingly do not possess telomeres. A small fraction of bacterial chromosomes (such as those in \"Streptomyces\", \"Agrobacterium\", and \"Borrelia\"), however, are linear and possess telomeres, which are very different from those of the eukaryotic chromosomes in structure and function. The known structures of bacterial telomeres take the form of proteins bound to the ends of linear chromosomes, or hairpin loops of single-stranded DNA at the ends of the linear chromosomes.\nTelomere ends and shelterin.\nAt the very 3'-end of the telomere there is a 300 base pair overhang which can invade the double-stranded portion of the telomere forming a structure known as a T-loop. This loop is analogous to a knot, which stabilizes the telomere, and prevents the telomere ends from being recognized as breakpoints by the DNA repair machinery. Should non-homologous end joining occur at the telomeric ends, chromosomal fusion would result. The T-loop is maintained by several proteins, collectively referred to as the shelterin complex. In humans, the shelterin complex consists of six proteins identified as TRF1, TRF2, TIN2, POT1, TPP1, and RAP1. In many species, the sequence repeats are enriched in guanine, e.g. TTAGGG in vertebrates, which allows the formation of G-quadruplexes, a special conformation of DNA involving non-Watson-Crick base pairing. There are different subtypes depending on the involvement of single- or double-stranded DNA, among other things. There is evidence for the 3'-overhang in ciliates (that possess telomere repeats similar to those found in vertebrates) to form such G-quadruplexes that accommodate it, rather than a T-loop. G-quadruplexes present an obstacle for enzymes such as DNA-polymerases and are thus thought to be involved in the regulation of replication and transcription.\nTelomerase.\nMany organisms have a ribonucleoprotein enzyme called telomerase, which carries out the task of adding repetitive nucleotide sequences to the ends of the DNA. Telomerase \"replenishes\" the telomere \"cap\" and requires no ATP. In most multicellular eukaryotic organisms, telomerase is active only in germ cells, some types of stem cells such as embryonic stem cells, and certain white blood cells. Telomerase can be reactivated and telomeres reset back to an embryonic state by somatic cell nuclear transfer. The steady shortening of telomeres with each replication in somatic (body) cells may have a role in senescence and in the prevention of cancer. This is because the telomeres act as a sort of time-delay \"fuse\", eventually running out after a certain number of cell divisions and resulting in the eventual loss of vital genetic information from the cell's chromosome with future divisions.\nLength.\nTelomere length varies greatly between species, from approximately 300 base pairs in yeast to many kilobases in humans, and usually is composed of arrays of guanine-rich, six- to eight-base-pair-long repeats. Eukaryotic telomeres normally terminate with 3\u2032 single-stranded-DNA overhang ranging from 75 to 300 bases, which is essential for telomere maintenance and capping. Multiple proteins binding single- and double-stranded telomere DNA have been identified. These function in both telomere maintenance and capping. Telomeres form large loop structures called telomere loops, or T-loops. Here, the single-stranded DNA curls around in a long circle, stabilized by telomere-binding proteins. At the very end of the T-loop, the single-stranded telomere DNA is held onto a region of double-stranded DNA by the telomere strand disrupting the double-helical DNA, and base pairing to one of the two strands. This triple-stranded structure is called a displacement loop or D-loop. A recent 2025 study suggest individuals with higher vitamin D intake may experience a slower rate of cellular aging. The study found that vitamin D supplements could help reduce this shortening, potentially by lowering inflammation. However, scientists caution that vitamin D is not a universal remedy, as it does not appear to impact all chronic illnesses. \nShortening.\nOxidative damage.\nApart from the end replication problem, in vitro studies have shown that telomeres accumulate damage due to oxidative stress and that oxidative stress-mediated DNA damage has a major influence on telomere shortening in vivo. There is a multitude of ways in which oxidative stress, mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS), can lead to DNA damage; however, it is yet unclear whether the elevated rate in telomeres is brought about by their inherent susceptibility or a diminished activity of DNA repair systems in these regions. Despite widespread agreement of the findings, widespread flaws regarding measurement and sampling have been pointed out; for example, a suspected species and tissue dependency of oxidative damage to telomeres is said to be insufficiently accounted for. Population-based studies have indicated an interaction between anti-oxidant intake and telomere length. In the Long Island Breast Cancer Study Project (LIBCSP), authors found a moderate increase in breast cancer risk among women with the shortest telomeres and lower dietary intake of beta carotene, vitamin C or E. These results suggest that cancer risk due to telomere shortening may interact with other mechanisms of DNA damage, specifically oxidative stress. \nAssociation with aging.\nAlthough telomeres shorten during the lifetime of an individual, it is telomere shortening-rate rather than telomere length that is associated with the human lifespan. Critically short telomeres trigger a DNA damage response and cellular senescence. Mice have much longer telomeres, but a greatly accelerated telomere shortening-rate and greatly reduced lifespan compared to humans and elephants.\nTelomere shortening is associated with aging, mortality, and aging-related diseases in experimental animals. Although many factors can affect human lifespan, such as smoking, diet, and exercise, as persons approach the upper limit of human life expectancy, longer telomeres may be associated with lifespan. However, vitamin D3 supplementation has been shown to significantly reduce telomere shortening over four years compared to a placebo, thus preventing nearly three years' worth of cellular aging, which may help offset telomere truncation over time.\nPotential effect of psychological stress.\nMeta-analyses found that increased perceived psychological stress was associated with a small decrease in telomere length\u2014but that these associations attenuate to no significant association when accounting for publication bias. The literature concerning telomeres as integrative biomarkers of exposure to stress and adversity is dominated by cross-sectional and correlational studies, which makes causal interpretation problematic. A 2020 review argued that the relationship between psychosocial stress and telomere length appears strongest for stress experienced in utero or early life.\nLengthening.\nThe phenomenon of limited cellular division was first observed by Leonard Hayflick, and is now referred to as the Hayflick limit. Significant discoveries were subsequently made by a group of scientists organized at Geron Corporation by Geron's founder Michael D. West, that tied telomere shortening with the Hayflick limit. The cloning of the catalytic component of telomerase enabled experiments to test whether the expression of telomerase at levels sufficient to prevent telomere shortening was capable of immortalizing human cells. Telomerase was demonstrated in a 1998 publication in \"Science\" to be capable of extending cell lifespan, and now is well-recognized as capable of immortalizing human somatic cells.\nTwo studies on long-lived seabirds demonstrate that the role of telomeres is far from being understood. In 2003, scientists observed that the telomeres of Leach's storm-petrel (\"Oceanodroma leucorhoa\") seem to lengthen with chronological age, the first observed instance of such behaviour of telomeres.\nA study reported that telomere length of different mammalian species correlates inversely rather than directly with lifespan, and concluded that the contribution of telomere length to lifespan remains controversial. There is little evidence that, in humans, telomere length is a significant biomarker of normal aging with respect to important cognitive and physical abilities.\nSequences.\nExperimentally verified and predicted telomere sequence motifs from more than 9000 species are collected in research community curated database http://. Some of the experimentally verified telomere nucleotide sequences are also listed in http:// website (see nucleic acid notation for letter representations).\nResearch on disease risk.\nPreliminary research indicates that disease risk in aging may be associated with telomere shortening, senescent cells, or SASP (senescence-associated secretory phenotype).\nMeasurement.\nSeveral techniques are currently employed to assess average telomere length in eukaryotic cells. One method is the Terminal Restriction Fragment (TRF) southern blot. There is a Web-based Analyser of the Length of Telomeres (https://), software processing the TRF pictures. A Real-Time PCR assay for telomere length involves determining the Telomere-to-Single Copy Gene (T/S) ratio, which is demonstrated to be proportional to the average telomere length in a cell.\nTools have also been developed to estimate the length of telomere from whole genome sequencing (WGS) experiments. Amongst these are TelSeq, Telomerecat and telomereHunter. Length estimation from WGS typically works by differentiating telomere sequencing reads and then inferring the length of telomere that produced that number of reads. These methods have been shown to correlate with preexisting methods of estimation such as PCR and TRF. Flow-FISH is used to quantify the length of telomeres in human white blood cells. A semi-automated method for measuring the average length of telomeres with Flow FISH was published in Nature Protocols in 2006.\nWhile multiple companies offer telomere length measurement services, the utility of these measurements for widespread clinical or personal use has been questioned. Nobel Prize winner Elizabeth Blackburn, who was co-founder of one company, promoted the clinical utility of telomere length measures.\nIn wildlife.\nDuring the last three decades, eco-evolutionary studies have investigated the relevance of life-history traits and environmental conditions on telomeres of wildlife. Most of these studies have been conducted in endotherms, i.e. birds and mammals. They have provided evidence for the inheritance of telomere length; however, heritability estimates vary greatly within and among species. Age and telomere length often negatively correlate in vertebrates, but this decline is variable among taxa and is influenced by the method used for estimating telomere length. In contrast, the available information shows no sex differences in telomere length across vertebrates. Phylogeny and life history traits such as body size or the pace of life can also affect telomere dynamics. For example, it has been described across species of birds and mammals. A meta-analysis has confirmed that exposure to various stressors (e.g. pathogen infection, competition, reproductive effort and high activity level) was associated with shorter telomeres across different animal taxa.\nStudies on ectotherms, and other non-mammalian organisms, show that there is no single universal model of telomere erosion; rather, there is wide variation in relevant dynamics across Metazoa, and even within smaller taxonomic groups these patterns appear diverse.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Slices of pork loin or fillet are coated with panko (bread crumbs) and then deep-fried in oil.\nAlong with \"kar\u0113 raisu\" and \"korokke\", \"tonkatsu\" was considered one of the \"three great \"y\u014dshoku\"\", popular Western-style Japanese dishes that were introduced to Japan.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"tonkatsu\" is a combination of the Sino-Japanese word \"ton\" () meaning \"pig\", and \"katsu\" (), which is a shortened form of \"katsuretsu\" (), an old transliteration of the English word \"cutlet\", which was in turn adopted from the French word .\nHistory.\nTonkatsu originated in Japan during the Meiji era in the late 19th century, a dish derived from a French dish known as \"c\u00f4telette de veau\", a veal cutlet coated in breadcrumbs and fried in a pan with butter.\nEuropean \"katsuretsu\" (loanword/gairaigo for 'cutlet') was usually made with beef; the pork version was created in 1899 at a restaurant serving European-style foods named Rengatei in Tokyo, Japan. It is a type of y\u014dshoku\u2014Japanese versions of European cuisine invented in the late 19th and early 20th centuries\u2014and was called \"katsuretsu\" or simply \"katsu\".\nIn the early Meiji era, several variations of \"katsuretsu\" were developed. These included beef cutlets (\u30d3\u30fc\u30d5\u30ab\u30c4\u30ec\u30c4, \"b\u012bfu katsuretsu\"), chicken cutlets (\u30c1\u30ad\u30f3\u30ab\u30c4\u30ec\u30c4, \"chikin katsuretsu\"), and pork cutlets (\u30dd\u30fc\u30af\u30ab\u30c4\u30ec\u30c4, \"p\u014dku katsuretsu\"). Of these variations, it was the \"p\u014dku katsuretsu\" that became the direct predecessor of modern \"tonkatsu\".\nPork cutlets (\u30dd\u30fc\u30af\u30ab\u30c4\u30ec\u30c4, \"p\u014dku katsuretsu\") began to gain popularity around 1907 and eventually became established as one of the \"three great \"y\u014dshoku\"\" (\u4e09\u5927\u6d0b\u98df, sandai y\u014dshoku) during the Taish\u014d era. As its popularity grew among the Japanese public, the modern form of \"tonkatsu\", distinguished by its use of a thick cut of pork, began to be sold in 1929 (Sh\u014dwa 4) in the Okachimachi neighborhood of Ueno, Tokyo.\nPreparation and serving.\nEither a or cut may be used; the meat is usually salted, peppered, dredged lightly in flour, dipped into beaten egg and then coated with panko (bread crumbs) before being deep-fried.\nTonkatsu is then sliced into bits and served, commonly with shredded cabbage. It is most commonly eaten with a thick Worcestershire-style sauce called tonkatsu sauce or simply \"s\u014dsu\" (sauce), \"karashi\" (mustard), and perhaps a slice of lemon. It is usually served with rice, miso soup and \"tsukemono\" and eaten with chopsticks. It may also be served with \"ponzu\" and grated \"daikon\" instead of tonkatsu sauce.\nVariations.\nTonkatsu is also popular as katsu curry, where it is served with Japanese curry, or as \"katsudon\", simmered with egg and broth, then served on a big bowl of rice; there is also katsu rice, which is pork cutlet served on rice topped with demi-glace sauce. Another popular variation, \"katsu-sando\" or pork cutlet sandwich, is said to be originated from the Isen, a tonkatsu restaurant. In the 1930s, the manager of the Isen came up with the concept, then improved it by making the sandwich smaller so that its clientele of local geishas could enjoy it without wearing off their lipstick.\nIn Nagoya and surrounding areas, miso katsu, tonkatsu eaten with a hatch\u014d miso-based sauce, is a speciality.\nVariations on tonkatsu may be made by sandwiching an ingredient such as cheese or shiso leaf between the meat, and then breading and frying.\nVariations of \"katsu\" other than pork:\nIn general, breaded and deep-fried foods are called \"furai\" (\"fry\"), such as \"ebi-furai\" (fried prawn) and \"aji-furai\" (fried horse mackerel), but fried meat such as pork, beef and chicken is referred to as \"katsu\" (cutlet). \"Katsu\" and \"furai\" differ from tempura, which is not breaded but battered and typically fried in sesame oil.\nIn recent years, chicken katsu curry has become extremely popular in the United Kingdom, to the point that other varieties of Japanese curry and curry sauce are sometimes referred to as katsu erroneously.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is a professor emeritus in the school of natural sciences at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. Witten is a researcher in string theory, quantum gravity, supersymmetric quantum field theories, and other areas of mathematical physics. Witten's work has also significantly impacted pure mathematics. In 1990, he became the first physicist to be awarded a Fields Medal by the International Mathematical Union, for his mathematical insights in physics, such as his 1981 proof of the positive energy theorem in general relativity, and his interpretation of the Jones invariants of knots as Feynman integrals. He is considered the practical founder of M-theory.\nEarly life and education.\nWitten was born on August 26, 1951, in Baltimore, Maryland, to a Jewish family, as the eldest of four children. His brother Matt Witten became a writer, and his brother Jesse Amnon Witten became a law partner in the firm Faegre Drinker Biddle &amp; Reath. Their sister Celia M. Witten earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from Stanford University and then an M.D. from the University of Miami. Edward Witten is the son of Lorraine (born Wollach) Witten and Louis Witten, a theoretical physicist specializing in gravitation and general relativity.\nWitten attended the Park School of Baltimore (class of 1968), and received his Bachelor of Arts degree with a major in history and minor in linguistics from Brandeis University in 1971.\nHe had aspirations in journalism and politics and published articles in both \"The New Republic\" and \"The Nation\" in the late 1960s. In 1972, he worked for six months on George McGovern's presidential campaign.\nWitten attended the University of Michigan for one semester as an economics graduate student before dropping out. He returned to academia, enrolling in applied mathematics at Princeton University in 1973, then shifting departments and receiving a PhD in physics in 1976 and completing a dissertation, \"Some problems in the short distance analysis of gauge theories\", under the supervision of David Gross. He held a fellowship at Harvard University (1976\u201377), visited Oxford University (1977\u201378), was a junior fellow in the Harvard Society of Fellows (1977\u20131980), and held a MacArthur Foundation fellowship (1982).\nResearch.\nFields medal work.\nWitten was awarded the Fields Medal by the International Mathematical Union in 1990.\nIn a written address to the ICM, Michael Atiyah said of Witten:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Although he is definitely a physicist (as his list of publications clearly shows) his command of mathematics is rivaled by few mathematicians, and his ability to interpret physical ideas in mathematical form is quite unique. Time and again he has surprised the mathematical community by a brilliant application of physical insight leading to new and deep mathematical theorems\u00a0... He has made a profound impact on contemporary mathematics. In his hands physics is once again providing a rich source of inspiration and insight in mathematics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAs an example of Witten's work in pure mathematics, Atiyah cites his application of techniques from quantum field theory to the mathematical subject of low-dimensional topology. In the late 1980s, Witten coined the term \"topological quantum field theory\" for a certain type of physical theory in which the expectation values of observable quantities encode information about the topology of spacetime. In particular, Witten realized that a physical theory now called Chern\u2013Simons theory could provide a framework for understanding the mathematical theory of knots and 3-manifolds. Although Witten's work was based on the mathematically ill-defined notion of a Feynman path integral and therefore not mathematically rigorous, mathematicians were able to systematically develop Witten's ideas, leading to the theory of Reshetikhin\u2013Turaev invariants.\nAnother result for which Witten was awarded the Fields Medal was his proof in 1981 of the positive energy theorem in general relativity. This theorem asserts that (under appropriate assumptions) the total energy of a gravitating system is always positive and can be zero only if the geometry of spacetime is that of flat Minkowski space. It establishes Minkowski space as a stable ground state of the gravitational field. While the original proof of this result due to Richard Schoen and Shing-Tung Yau used variational methods, Witten's proof used ideas from supergravity theory to simplify the argument.\nA third area mentioned in Atiyah's address is Witten's work relating supersymmetry and Morse theory, a branch of mathematics that studies the topology of manifolds using the concept of a differentiable function. Witten's work gave a physical proof of a classical result, the Morse inequalities, by interpreting the theory in terms of supersymmetric quantum mechanics.\nM-theory.\nBy the mid 1990s, physicists working on string theory had developed five different consistent versions of the theory. These versions are known as type I, type IIA, type IIB, and the two flavors of heterotic string theory (SO(32) and E8\u00d7E8). The thinking was that of these five candidate theories, only one was the actual correct theory of everything, and that theory was the one whose low-energy limit matched the physics observed in our world today.\nSpeaking at Strings '95 conference at University of Southern California, Witten made the surprising suggestion that these five string theories were in fact not distinct theories, but different limits of a single theory, which he called M-theory. Witten's proposal was based on the observation that the five string theories can be mapped to one another by certain rules called dualities and are identified by these dualities. It led to a flurry of work now known as the second superstring revolution.\nOther work.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAnother of Witten's contributions to physics was to the result of gauge/gravity duality. In 1997, Juan Maldacena formulated a result known as the AdS/CFT correspondence, which establishes a relationship between certain quantum field theories and theories of quantum gravity. Maldacena's discovery has dominated high-energy theoretical physics for the past 15 years because of its applications to theoretical problems in quantum gravity and quantum field theory. Witten's foundational work following Maldacena's result has shed light on this relationship.\nIn collaboration with Nathan Seiberg, Witten established several powerful results in quantum field theories. In their paper on string theory and noncommutative geometry, Seiberg and Witten studied certain noncommutative quantum field theories that arise as limits of string theory. In another well-known paper, they studied aspects of supersymmetric gauge theory. The latter paper, combined with Witten's earlier work on topological quantum field theory, led to developments in the topology of smooth 4-manifolds, in particular the notion of Seiberg\u2013Witten invariants.\nWith Anton Kapustin, Witten has made deep mathematical connections between S-duality of gauge theories and the geometric Langlands correspondence. Partly in collaboration with Seiberg, one of his recent interests includes aspects of field theoretical description of topological phases in condensed matter and non-supersymmetric dualities in field theories that, among other things, are of high relevance in condensed matter theory. In 2016, he has also brought tensor models to the relevance of holographic and quantum gravity theories, by using them as a generalization of the Sachdev\u2013Ye\u2013Kitaev model.\nWitten has published influential and insightful work in many aspects of quantum field theories and mathematical physics, including the physics and mathematics of anomalies, integrability, dualities, localization, and homologies. Many of his results have deeply influenced areas in theoretical physics (often well beyond the original context of his results), including string theory, quantum gravity and topological condensed matter. In particular, Witten is known for collaborating with Ruth Britto on a method calculating scattering amplitudes known as the BCFW recursion relations.\nAwards and honors.\nWitten has been honored with numerous awards including a MacArthur Grant (1982), the Fields Medal (1990), the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement (1997), the Nemmers Prize in Mathematics (2000), the National Medal of Science (2002), Pythagoras Award (2005), the Henri Poincar\u00e9 Prize (2006), the Crafoord Prize (2008), the Lorentz Medal (2010) the Isaac Newton Medal (2010) and the Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics (2012). Since 1999, he has been a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (London), and in March 2016 was elected an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. Pope Benedict XVI appointed Witten as a member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences (2006). He also appeared in the list of \"Time\" magazine's 100 most influential people of 2004. In 2012, he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society. Witten was elected as a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1984, a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1988, and a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1993. In May 2022 he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Sciences from the University of Pennsylvania.\nIn an informal poll at a 1990 cosmology conference, Witten received the largest number of mentions as \"the smartest living physicist\".\nPersonal life.\nWitten has been married to Chiara Nappi, a professor of physics at Princeton University, since 1979. They have two daughters and a son. Their daughter Ilana B. Witten is a neuroscientist at Princeton University, and daughter Daniela Witten is a biostatistician at the University of Washington.\nWitten sits on the board of directors of Americans for Peace Now and on the advisory council of J Street. He supports the two-state solution and advocates a boycott of Israeli institutions and economic activity beyond its 1967 borders, though not of Israel itself. Witten lived in Israel for a year in the 1960s.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "54910", "revid": "32005", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54910", "title": "Chlorofluorocarbon", "text": "Class of organic compounds\nChlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) are fully or partly halogenated hydrocarbons that contain carbon (C), hydrogen (H), chlorine (Cl), and fluorine (F). They are produced as volatile derivatives of methane, ethane, and propane.\nThe most common example of a CFC is dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12). R-12, also commonly called Freon, is used as a refrigerant. Many CFCs have been widely used as refrigerants, propellants (in aerosol applications), gaseous fire suppression systems, and solvents. As a result of CFCs contributing to ozone depletion in the upper atmosphere, the manufacture of such compounds has been phased out under the Montreal Protocol, and they are being replaced with other products such as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs) including R-410A, R-134a and R-1234yf.\nStructure, properties and production.\nAs in simpler alkanes, carbons in CFCs bond with tetrahedral symmetry. Because the fluorine and chlorine atoms differ greatly in size and effective charge from hydrogen and from each other, methane-derived CFCs deviate from perfect tetrahedral symmetry.\nThe physical properties of CFCs and HCFCs can be affected by changes in the number and identity of the halogen atoms. They are generally volatile, but less so than their parent alkanes. The decreased volatility is attributed to the molecular polarity induced by the halides, which induces intermolecular interactions. Thus, methane boils at \u2212161\u00a0\u00b0C whereas the fluoromethanes boil between \u221251.7 () and \u2212128\u00a0\u00b0C (). CFCs still have higher boiling points because the chloride is even more polarizable than fluoride. Because of their polarity, CFCs are useful solvents, and their boiling points make them suitable as refrigerants. CFCs are far less flammable than methane, in part because they contain fewer C\u2013H bonds and in part because, in the case of the chlorides and bromides, the released halides quench the free radicals that sustain flames.\nThe densities of CFCs are higher than their corresponding alkanes. In general, the density of these compounds correlates with the number of chlorides.\nCFCs and HCFCs are usually produced by halogen exchange starting from chlorinated methanes and ethanes. Written below is the synthesis of chlorodifluoromethane from chloroform:\nBrominated derivatives are generated by free-radical reactions of hydrochlorofluorocarbons, replacing C\u2013H bonds with C\u2013Br bonds. The production of the anesthetic 2-bromo-2-chloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane (\"halothane\") is written out below:\nApplications.\nCFCs and HCFCs are used in various applications because of their low toxicity, reactivity and flammability. Every permutation of fluorine, chlorine and hydrogen based on methane and ethane has been examined and most have been commercialized. Furthermore, many examples are known for higher numbers of carbon as well as related compounds containing bromine. Uses include refrigerants, blowing agents, aerosol propellants in medicinal applications, and degreasing solvents.\nBillions of kilograms of chlorodifluoromethane are produced annually as a precursor to tetrafluoroethylene, the monomer that is converted into Teflon.\nClasses of compounds and Numbering System.\nNumbering system.\nA special numbering system is used for fluorinated alkanes, prefixed with Freon-, R-, CFC- and HCFC-, where the rightmost value indicates the number of fluorine atoms, the next value to the left is the number of hydrogen atoms \"plus\" 1, and the next value to the left is the number of carbon atoms \"less\" one (zeroes are not stated), and the remaining atoms are chlorine.\nFreon-12, for example, indicates a methane derivative (only two numbers) containing two fluorine atoms (the second 2) and no hydrogen (1 \u2212 1 = 0). It is therefore .\nAnother equation that can be applied to get the correct molecular formula of the CFC/R/Freon class compounds is to take the numbering and add 90 to it. The resulting value will give the number of carbons as the first numeral, the second numeral gives the number of hydrogen atoms, and the third numeral gives the number of fluorine atoms. The rest of the unaccounted carbon bonds are occupied by chlorine atoms. The value of this equation is always a three figure number. An easy example is that of CFC-12, which gives: 90+12=102 -&gt; 1 carbon, 0 hydrogens, 2 fluorine atoms, and hence 2 chlorine atoms resulting in . The main advantage of this method of deducing the molecular composition in comparison with the method described in the paragraph above is that it gives the number of carbon atoms of the molecule.\nFreons containing bromine are signified by four numbers. Isomers, which are common for ethane and propane derivatives, are indicated by letters following the numbers:\nReactions.\nThe reaction of the CFCs which is responsible for the depletion of ozone, is the photo-induced scission of a C-Cl bond:\nThe chlorine atom, written often as Cl\u2022, behaves very differently from the chlorine molecule (). The radical Cl\u2022 is long-lived in the upper atmosphere, where it catalyzes the conversion of ozone into . Ozone absorbs UV-B radiation, so its depletion allows more of this high energy radiation to reach the Earth's surface. Bromine atoms are even more efficient catalysts; hence brominated CFCs are also regulated.\nImpact as greenhouse gases.\nCFCs were phased out via the Montreal Protocol due to their part in ozone depletion.\nThe atmospheric impacts of CFCs are not limited to their role as ozone-depleting chemicals. Infrared absorption bands prevent heat at that wavelength from escaping Earth's atmosphere. CFCs have their strongest absorption bands from C-F and C-Cl bonds in the spectral region of 7.8\u201315.3 \u03bcm\u2014referred to as the \"atmospheric window\" due to the relative transparency of the atmosphere within this region.\nThe strength of CFC absorption bands and the unique susceptibility of the atmosphere at wavelengths where CFCs (indeed all covalent fluorine compounds) absorb radiation creates a \"super\" greenhouse effect from CFCs and other unreactive fluorine-containing gases such as perfluorocarbons, HFCs, HCFCs, bromofluorocarbons, , and . This \"atmospheric window\" absorption is intensified by the low concentration of each individual CFC. Because CO2 is close to saturation with high concentrations and few infrared absorption bands, the radiation budget and hence the greenhouse effect has low sensitivity to changes in CO2 concentration; the increase in temperature is roughly logarithmic. Conversely, the low concentration of CFCs allow their effects to increase linearly with mass, so that chlorofluorocarbons are greenhouse gases with a much higher potential to enhance the greenhouse effect than CO2.\nGroups are actively disposing of legacy CFCs to reduce their impact on the atmosphere.\nAccording to NASA in 2018, the hole in the ozone layer has begun to recover as a result of CFC bans. However, research released in 2019 reported an alarming increase in CFCs, pointing to unregulated use in China.\nHistory.\nPrior to, and during the 1920s, refrigerators used toxic gases as refrigerants, including ammonia, sulphur dioxide, and chloromethane. Later in the 1920s after a series of fatal accidents involving the leaking of chloromethane from refrigerators, a major collaborative effort began between American corporations Frigidaire, General Motors, and DuPont to develop a safer, non-toxic alternative. Thomas Midgley Jr. of General Motors is credited for synthesizing the first chlorofluorocarbons. The Frigidaire corporation was issued the first patent, number 1,886,339, for the formula for CFCs on December 31, 1928. In a demonstration for the American Chemical Society, Midgley flamboyantly demonstrated all these properties by inhaling a breath of the gas and using it to blow out a candle in 1930.\nBy 1930, General Motors and Du Pont formed the Kinetic Chemical Company to produce Freon, and by 1935, over 8 million refrigerators utilizing R-12 were sold by Frigidaire and its competitors. In 1932, Carrier began using R-11 in the worlds first self-contained home air conditioning unit known as the \"atmospheric cabinet\". As a result of CFCs being largely non-toxic, they quickly became the coolant of choice in large air-conditioning systems. Public health codes in cities were revised to designate chlorofluorocarbons as the only gases that could be used as refrigerants in public buildings.\nGrowth in CFCs continued over the following decades leading to peak annual sales of over 1 billion USD with greater than 1 million metric tonnes being produced annually. It wasn't until 1974 that it was first discovered by two University of California chemists, Professor F. Sherwood Rowland and Dr. Mario Molina, that the use of chlorofluorocarbons were causing a significant depletion in atmospheric ozone concentrations. This initiated the environmental effort which eventually resulted in the enactment of the Montreal Protocol.\nCommercial development and use in fire extinguishing.\nDuring World War II, various chloroalkanes were in standard use in military aircraft, although these early halons suffered from excessive toxicity. Nevertheless, after the war they slowly became more common in civil aviation as well. In the 1960s, fluoroalkanes and bromofluoroalkanes became available and were quickly recognized as being highly effective fire-fighting materials. Much early research with Halon 1301 was conducted under the auspices of the US Armed Forces, while Halon 1211 was, initially, mainly developed in the UK. By the late 1960s they were standard in many applications where water and dry-powder extinguishers posed a threat of damage to the protected property, including computer rooms, telecommunications switches, laboratories, museums and art collections. Beginning with warships, in the 1970s, bromofluoroalkanes also progressively came to be associated with rapid knockdown of severe fires in confined spaces with minimal risk to personnel.\nBy the early 1980s, bromofluoroalkanes were in common use on aircraft, ships, and large vehicles as well as in computer facilities and galleries. However, concern was beginning to be expressed about the impact of chloroalkanes and bromoalkanes on the ozone layer. The Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer did not cover bromofluoroalkanes under the same restrictions, because emergency discharge of extinguishing systems was thought to be too small in volume to produce a significant impact and too important to human safety for restriction. Instead, the consumption of bromofluoroalkanes was frozen at 1986 levels.\nRegulation.\nSince the late 1970s, the use of CFCs has been heavily regulated because of their destructive effects on the ozone layer. After the development of his electron capture detector, James Lovelock was the first to detect the widespread presence of CFCs in the air, finding a mole fraction of 60 ppt of CFC-11 over Ireland. In a self-funded research expedition ending in 1973, Lovelock went on to measure CFC-11 in both the Arctic and Antarctic, finding the presence of the gas in each of 50 air samples collected, and concluding that CFCs are not hazardous to the environment. The experiment did however provide the first useful data on the presence of CFCs in the atmosphere. The damage caused by CFCs was discovered by Sherry Rowland and Mario Molina who, after hearing a lecture on the subject of Lovelock's work, embarked on research resulting in the first publication suggesting the connection in 1974. It turns out that one of CFCs' most attractive features\u2014their low reactivity\u2014is key to their most destructive effects. CFCs' lack of reactivity gives them a lifespan that can exceed 100 years, giving them time to diffuse into the upper stratosphere. Once in the stratosphere, the sun's ultraviolet radiation is strong enough to cause the homolytic cleavage of the C-Cl bond. In 1976, under the Toxic Substances Control Act, the EPA banned commercial manufacturing and use of CFCs and aerosol propellants. This was later superseded in the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act to address stratospheric ozone depletion.\nBy 1987, in response to a dramatic seasonal depletion of the ozone layer over Antarctica, diplomats in Montreal forged a treaty, the Montreal Protocol, which called for drastic reductions in the production of CFCs. On 2 March 1989, 12 European Community nations agreed to ban the production of all CFCs by the end of the century. In 1990, diplomats met in London and voted to significantly strengthen the Montreal Protocol by calling for a complete elimination of CFCs by 2000. By 2010, CFCs should have been completely eliminated from developing countries as well.\nBecause the only CFCs available to countries adhering to the treaty is from recycling, their prices have increased considerably. A worldwide end to production should also terminate the smuggling of this material. However, there are current CFC smuggling issues, as recognized by the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) in a 2006 report titled \"Illegal Trade in Ozone Depleting Substances\". UNEP estimates that between 16,000\u201338,000 tonnes of CFCs passed through the black market in the mid-1990s. The report estimated between 7,000 and 14,000 tonnes of CFCs are smuggled annually into developing countries. Asian countries are those with the most smuggling; as of 2007, China, India and South Korea were found to account for around 70% of global CFC production, South Korea later to ban CFC production in 2010. Possible reasons for continued CFC smuggling were also examined: the report noted that many of the refrigeration systems that were designed to be operated utilizing the banned CFC products have long lifespans and continue to operate. The cost of replacing the equipment of these items is sometimes cheaper than outfitting them with a more ozone-friendly appliance. Additionally, CFC smuggling is not considered a significant issue, so the perceived penalties for smuggling are low. In 2018 public attention was drawn to the issue, that at an unknown place in east Asia an estimated amount of 13,000 metric tons annually of CFCs have been produced since about 2012 in violation of the protocol. While the eventual phaseout of CFCs is likely, efforts are being taken to stem these current non-compliance problems.\nBy the time of the Montreal Protocol, it was realised that deliberate and accidental discharges during system tests and maintenance accounted for substantially larger volumes than emergency discharges, and consequently halons were brought into the treaty, albeit with many exceptions.\nRegulatory gap.\nWhile the production and consumption of CFCs are regulated under the Montreal Protocol, emissions from existing banks of CFCs are not regulated under the agreement. In 2002, there were an estimated 5,791 kilotons of CFCs in existing products such as refrigerators, air conditioners, aerosol cans and others. Approximately one-third of these CFCs are projected to be emitted over the next decade if action is not taken, posing a threat to both the ozone layer and the climate. A proportion of these CFCs can be safely captured and destroyed by means of high temperature, controlled incineration which destroys the CFC molecule.\nRegulation and DuPont.\nIn 1978 the United States banned the use of CFCs such as Freon in aerosol cans, the beginning of a long series of regulatory actions against their use. The critical DuPont manufacturing patent for Freon (\"Process for Fluorinating Halohydrocarbons\", U.S. Patent #3258500) was set to expire in 1979. In conjunction with other industrial peers DuPont formed a lobbying group, the \"Alliance for Responsible CFC Policy\", to combat regulations of ozone-depleting compounds. In 1986 DuPont, with new patents in hand, reversed its previous stance and publicly condemned CFCs. DuPont representatives appeared before the Montreal Protocol urging that CFCs be banned worldwide and stated that their new HCFCs would meet the worldwide demand for refrigerants.\nPhasing-out of CFCs.\nUse of certain chloroalkanes as solvents for large scale application, such as dry cleaning, have been phased out, for example, by the IPPC directive on greenhouse gases in 1994 and by the volatile organic compounds (VOC) directive of the EU in 1997. Permitted chlorofluoroalkane uses are medicinal only.\nBromofluoroalkanes have been largely phased out and the possession of equipment for their use is prohibited in some countries like the Netherlands and Belgium, from 1 January 2004, based on the Montreal Protocol and guidelines of the European Union.\nProduction of new stocks ceased in most (probably all) countries in 1994. However many countries still require aircraft to be fitted with halon fire suppression systems because no safe and completely satisfactory alternative has been discovered for this application. There are also a few other, highly specialized uses. These programs recycle halon through \"halon banks\" coordinated by the Halon Recycling Corporation to ensure that discharge to the atmosphere occurs only in a genuine emergency and to conserve remaining stocks.\nThe interim replacements for CFCs are hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), which deplete stratospheric ozone, but to a much lesser extent than CFCs. Ultimately, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) will replace HCFCs. Unlike CFCs and HCFCs, HFCs have an ozone depletion potential (ODP) of 0. DuPont began producing hydrofluorocarbons as alternatives to Freon in the 1980s. These included Suva refrigerants and Dymel propellants. Natural refrigerants are climate friendly solutions that are enjoying increasing support from large companies and governments interested in reducing global warming emissions from refrigeration and air conditioning.\nPhasing-out of HFCs and HCFCs.\nHydrofluorocarbons are included in the Kyoto Protocol and are regulated under the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol due to their very high Global Warming Potential (GWP) and the recognition of halocarbon contributions to climate change.\nOn September 21, 2007, approximately 200 countries agreed to accelerate the elimination of hydrochlorofluorocarbons entirely by 2020 in a United Nations-sponsored Montreal summit. Developing nations were given until 2030. Many nations, such as the United States and China, who had previously resisted such efforts, agreed with the accelerated phase out schedule. India successfully achieved the complete phase out of HCFC-141 b in 2020.\nIt was reported that levels of HCFCs in the atmosphere had started to fall in 2021 due to their phase out under the Montreal Protocol.\nProperly collecting, controlling, and destroying CFCs and HCFCs.\nWhile new production of these refrigerants has been banned, large volumes still exist in older systems and have been said to pose an immediate threat to our environment. Preventing the release of these harmful refrigerants has been ranked as one of the single most effective actions we can take to mitigate catastrophic climate change.\nDevelopment of alternatives for CFCs.\nWork on alternatives for chlorofluorocarbons in refrigerants began in the late 1970s after the first warnings of damage to stratospheric ozone were published.\nThe hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) are less stable in the lower atmosphere, enabling them to break down before reaching the ozone layer. Nevertheless, a significant fraction of the HCFCs do break down in the stratosphere and they have contributed to more chlorine buildup there than originally predicted. Later alternatives lacking the chlorine, the hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) have an even shorter lifetimes in the lower atmosphere. One of these compounds, HFC-134a, were used in place of CFC-12 in automobile air conditioners. Hydrocarbon refrigerants (a propane/isobutane blend) were also used extensively in mobile air conditioning systems in Australia, the US and many other countries, as they had excellent thermodynamic properties and performed particularly well in high ambient temperatures. 1,1-Dichloro-1-fluoroethane (HCFC-141b) has replaced HFC-134a, due to its low ODP and GWP values. And according to the Montreal Protocol, HCFC-141b is supposed to be phased out completely and replaced with zero ODP substances such as cyclopentane, HFOs, and HFC-345a before January 2020.\nAmong the natural refrigerants (along with ammonia and carbon dioxide), hydrocarbons have negligible environmental impacts and are also used worldwide in domestic and commercial refrigeration applications, and are becoming available in new split system air conditioners.\nVarious other solvents and methods have replaced the use of CFCs in laboratory analytics.\nIn Metered-dose inhalers (MDI), a non-ozone effecting substitute was developed as a propellant, known as \"hydrofluoroalkane\".\nDevelopment of Hydrofluoroolefins as alternatives to CFCs and HCFCs.\nThe development of Hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs) as replacements for Hydrochlorofluorocarbons and Hydrofluorocarbons began after the Kigali amendment to the Montreal Protocol in 2016, which called for the phase out of high global warming potential (GWP) refrigerants and to replace them with other refrigerants with a lower GWP, closer to that of carbon dioxide. HFOs have an ozone depletion potential of 0.0, compared to the 1.0 of principal CFC-11, and a low GWP which make them environmentally safer alternatives to CFCs, HCFCs and HFCs.\nHydrofluoroolefins serve as functional replacements for applications where high GWP hydrofluorocarbons were once used. In April 2022, the EPA signed a pre-published final rule Listing of HFO-1234yf under the Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP) Program for Motor Vehicle Air Conditioning in Nonroad Vehicles and Servicing Fittings for Small Refrigerant Cans. This ruling allows HFO-1234yf to take over in applications where ozone depleting CFCs such as R-12, and high GWP HFCs such as R-134a were once used. The phaseout and replacement of CFCs and HFCs in the automotive industry will ultimately reduce the release of these gases to atmosphere and in turn have a positive contribution to the mitigation of climate change.\nTracer of ocean circulation.\nSince the history of CFC concentrations in the atmosphere is relatively well known, they have provided an important constraint on ocean circulation. CFCs dissolve in seawater at the ocean surface and are subsequently transported into the ocean interior. Because CFCs are inert, their concentration in the ocean interior reflects simply the convolution of their atmospheric time evolution and ocean circulation and mixing.\nThe entry of CFCs into the ocean makes them extremely useful as transient tracers to estimate rates and pathways of ocean circulation and mixing processes. However, due to production restrictions of CFCs in the 1980s, atmospheric concentrations of CFC-11 and CFC-12 has stopped increasing, and the CFC-11 to CFC-12 ratio in the atmosphere have been steadily decreasing, making water dating of water masses more problematic. Incidentally, production and release of sulfur hexafluoride () have rapidly increased in the atmosphere since the 1970s. Similar to CFCs, is also an inert gas and is not affected by oceanic chemical or biological activities. Thus, using CFCs in concert with as a tracer resolves the water dating issues due to decreased CFC concentrations.\nUsing CFCs or as a tracer of ocean circulation allows for the derivation of rates for ocean processes due to the time-dependent source function. The elapsed time since a subsurface water mass was last in contact with the atmosphere is the tracer-derived age. Estimates of age can be derived based on the partial pressure of an individual compound and the ratio of the partial pressure of CFCs to each other (or ).\nThe age of a water parcel can be estimated by the CFC partial pressure (pCFC) age or partial pressure (p) age. The pCFC age of a water sample is defined as:\nformula_1\nwhere [CFC] is the measured CFC concentration (pmol kg\u22121) and F is the solubility of CFC gas in seawater as a function of temperature and salinity. The CFC partial pressure is expressed in units of 10\u201312 atmospheres or parts-per-trillion (ppt). The solubility measurements of CFC-11 and CFC-12 have been previously measured by Warner and Weiss Additionally, the solubility measurement of CFC-113 was measured by Bu and Warner and by Wanninkhof et al. and Bullister et al. Theses authors mentioned above have expressed the solubility (F) at a total pressure of 1 atm as:\nformula_2\nwhere F = solubility expressed in either mol l\u22121 or mol kg\u22121 atm\u22121,\nT = absolute temperature,\nS = salinity in parts per thousand (ppt),\na1, a2, a3, b1, b2, and b3 are constants to be determined from the least squares fit to the solubility measurements. This equation is derived from the integrated Van 't Hoff equation and the logarithmic Setchenow salinity dependence.\nIt can be noted that the solubility of CFCs increase with decreasing temperature at approximately 1% per degree Celsius.\nOnce the partial pressure of the CFC (or ) is derived, it is then compared to the atmospheric time histories for CFC-11, CFC-12, or in which the pCFC directly corresponds to the year with the same. The difference between the corresponding date and the collection date of the seawater sample is the average age for the water parcel. The age of a parcel of water can also be calculated using the ratio of two CFC partial pressures or the ratio of the partial pressure to a CFC partial pressure.\nSafety.\nAccording to their material safety data sheets, CFCs and HCFCs are colorless, volatile, non-toxic liquids and gases with a faintly sweet ethereal odor. Overexposure at concentrations of 11% or more may cause dizziness, loss of concentration, central nervous system depression or cardiac arrhythmia. Vapors displace air and can cause asphyxiation in confined spaces. Dermal absorption of chlorofluorocarbons is possible, but low. The pulmonary uptake of inhaled chlorofluorocarbons occurs quickly with peak blood concentrations, occurring in as little as 15 seconds with steady concentrations, and evening out after 20 minutes. Absorption of orally ingested chlorofluorocarbons is 35 to 48 times lower compared to inhalation. Although non-flammable, their combustion products include hydrofluoric acid and related species.\nNormal occupational exposure is rated at 0.07% and does not pose any serious health risks.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The temperature at which droplets form is called the \"dew point\". When surface temperature drops, eventually reaching the dew point, atmospheric water vapor condenses to form small droplets on the surface. This process distinguishes dew from those hydrometeors (meteorological occurrences of water), which form directly in air that has cooled to its dew point (typically around condensation nuclei), such as fog or clouds. The thermodynamic principles of formation, however, are the same. Dew is commonly formed during select times of the day. Nights, early mornings, and early evenings are all times during which dew is likely to be found.\nOccurrence.\nAdequate cooling of the surface typically takes place when it loses more energy by infrared radiation than it receives as solar radiation from the Sun, which is especially the case on clear nights. Poor thermal conductivity restricts the replacement of such losses from deeper ground layers, which are typically warmer at night. Preferred objects of dew formation are thus poor conducting or well isolated from the ground, and non-metallic, while shiny metal coated surfaces are poor infrared radiators. Preferred weather conditions include the absence of clouds and little water vapor in the higher atmosphere to minimize greenhouse effects and sufficient humidity of the air near the ground. Typical dew nights are classically considered calm, because the wind transports (nocturnally) warmer air from higher levels to the cold surface. However, if the atmosphere is the major source of moisture (this type is called dewfall), a certain amount of ventilation is needed to replace the vapor that is already condensed. The highest optimum wind speeds could be found on arid islands. Wind always seems adverse, however, if the wet soil beneath is the major source of vapor (in which case dew is said to form by distillation).\nThe processes of dew formation do not restrict its occurrence to the night and the outdoors. They are also working when eyeglasses get steamy in a warm, wet room or in industrial processes. However, the term condensation is preferred in these cases.\nMeasurement.\nA classical device for dew measurement is the drosometer. A small (artificial) condenser surface is suspended from an arm attached to a pointer or a pen that records the weight changes of the condenser on a drum. Besides being very wind sensitive, however, this, like all artificial surface devices, only provides a measure of the meteorological potential for dew formation. The actual amount of dew in a specific place is strongly dependent on surface properties. For its measurement, plants, leaves, or whole soil columns are placed on a balance with their surface at the same height and in the same surroundings as would occur naturally, thus providing a small lysimeter. Further methods include estimation by means of comparing the droplets to standardized photographs or volumetric measurement of the amount of water wiped from the surface. Some of these methods include guttation, while others only measure dewfall and/or distillation.\nSignificance.\nDue to its dependence on radiation balance, dew amounts can reach a theoretical maximum of about 0.8\u00a0mm per night; measured values, however, rarely exceed 0.5\u00a0mm. In most climates of the world, the annual average is too small to compete with rain. In regions with considerable dry seasons, adapted plants like lichen or pine seedlings benefit from dew. Large-scale, natural irrigation without rainfall, such as in the Atacama and Namib deserts, however, is mostly attributed to fog water. In the Negev Desert in Israel, dew has been found to account for almost half of the water found in three dominant desert species: \"Salsola inermis, Artemisia sieberi and Haloxylon scoparium\".\nAnother effect of dew is its hydration of fungal substrates and the mycelia of species such as pleated inkcaps, often found on lawns, and \"Phytophthora infestans\" which causes blight on potato plants.\nHistoric.\nThe book \"On the Universe\" (\"De Mundo\") (composed before 250 BC or between 350 and 200 BC) stated: \"Dew is moisture minute in composition falling from a clear sky; ice is water congealed in a condensed form from a clear sky; hoar-frost is congealed dew, and 'dew-frost' is dew which is half congealed\".\nIn Greek mythology, Ersa is the goddess and personification of dew.\nAlso, according to the myth, the dew in the morning was created when Eos (Ersa's aunt), goddess of the dawn, cried for her son's death, although later he received immortality.\nDew, known in Hebrew as \u05d8\u05dc (\"tal\"), is significant in the Jewish religion for agricultural and theological purposes. On the first day of Passover, the \"Chazan\", dressed in a white \"kittel\", leads a service in which he prays for dew between that point and Sukkot. During the rainy season between December and Passover there are also additions in the Amidah for blessed dew to come together with rain. There are many midrashim that refer to dew as being the tool for ultimate resurrection. \"Dewy\" or \"my father is the morning dew\" are approximate etymologies of the Hebrew given name, Avital.\nIn the Biblical Torah or Old Testament, dew is used symbolically in : \"My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distill as the dew, as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers upon the grass.\"\nIn the Catholic Mass in the Western Rite, whenever the Second Eucharistic Prayer is used, the priest prays over bread and wine, to God the Father; \u2018Make holy, therefore, these gifts, we pray, by sending down your Spirit upon them like the dewfall, so that they may become for us the Body and Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ.\u2019 The idea that the Holy Spirit enters the world and our lives in a quiet, undramatic way, \u2018like the dewfall\u2019, has great appeal for many Christians.\nArtificial harvesting.\nThe potentially allows water availability in areas where supporting weather conditions, such as rain, are lacking. Several man-made devices such as antique big stone piles in Ukraine, medieval dew ponds in Southern England, and volcanic stone covers on the fields of Lanzarote have been thought to be dew-catching devices, but could be shown to work on other principles. At present, the International Organization for Dew Utilization (OPUR) is working on effective, foil-based condensers for regions where rain or fog cannot cover water needs throughout the year.\nLarge-scale dew harvesting systems have been made by the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad (IIMA) with the participation of OPUR in the coastal, semiarid region of Kutch. These condensers can harvest more than 200 liters (on average) of dew water per night for about 90 nights in the October-to-May dew season. The IIMA research laboratory has shown that dew can serve as a supplementary source of water in coastal arid areas.\nA large-scale dew harvesting scheme envisages circulating cold sea water in EPDM collectors near the seashore. These condense dew and fog to supply clean drinking water. Other, more recent, studies display possible roof integration for dew harvesting devices.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "54912", "revid": "49613391", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54912", "title": "Dew point", "text": "Temperature below which condensation occurs\nThe dew point is the temperature that air, of a constant absolute humidity and pressure, must be cooled to in order for the relative humidity to rise to 100%. This temperature is a thermodynamic property that depends on the pressure and water content of the air. When the air at a temperature above the dew point is cooled, its moisture capacity is reduced and airborne water vapor will condense to form liquid water known as dew. When this occurs through the air's contact with a colder surface, dew will form on that surface. \nThe dew point is affected by the air's humidity. The more moisture the air contains, the higher its dew point.\nWhen the temperature is below the freezing point of water, the dew point is called the frost point, as frost is formed via deposition rather than condensation.\nIn liquids, the analog to the dew point is the cloud point.\nHumidity.\nIf all the other factors influencing humidity remain constant, at ground level the relative humidity rises as the temperature falls; this is because the air's capacity to hold water vapor decreases, and less vapor is needed to saturate the air. The dew point temperature equals the air temperature when the air is saturated with water; in all other cases the dew point will be less than the air temperature. \nIn technical terms, the dew point is the temperature at which the water vapor in a sample of air at constant barometric pressure condenses into liquid water at the same rate at which it evaporates. At temperatures below the dew point, the rate of condensation will be greater than that of evaporation, forming more liquid water. The condensed water is called dew when it forms on a solid surface, or frost if it freezes. In the air, the condensed water is called either fog or a cloud, depending on its altitude when it forms. If the temperature is below the dew point, and no dew or fog forms, the vapor is called supersaturated. This can happen if there are not enough particles in the air to act as condensation nuclei.\nThe dew point depends on how much water vapor the air contains. If the air is very dry and has few water molecules, the dew point is low and surfaces must be much cooler than the air for condensation to occur. If the air is very humid and contains many water molecules, the dew point is high and condensation can occur on surfaces that are only a few degrees cooler than the air.\nA high relative humidity implies that the dew point is close to the current air temperature. A relative humidity of 100% indicates the dew point is equal to the current temperature and that the air is maximally saturated with water. When the moisture content remains constant and temperature increases, relative humidity decreases, but the dew point remains constant.\nGeneral aviation pilots use dew point data to calculate the likelihood of carburetor icing and fog, and to estimate the height of a cumuliform cloud base.\nIncreasing the barometric pressure raises the dew point. This means that, if the pressure increases, the mass of water vapor per volume unit of air must be reduced in order to maintain the same dew point. For example, consider New York City ( elevation) and Denver ( elevation). Because Denver is at a higher elevation than New York, it will tend to have a lower barometric pressure. This means that if the dew point and temperature in both cities are the same, the amount of water vapor in the air will be greater in Denver.\nRelationship to human comfort.\nWhen the air temperature is high, the human body uses the evaporation of perspiration to cool down, with the cooling effect directly related to how fast the perspiration evaporates. The rate at which perspiration can evaporate depends on how much moisture is in the air and how much moisture the air can hold. If the air is already saturated with moisture (humid), perspiration will not evaporate. The body's thermoregulation will produce perspiration in an effort to keep the body at its normal temperature even when the rate at which it is producing sweat exceeds the evaporation rate, so one can become coated with sweat on humid days even without generating additional body heat (such as by exercising).\nAs the air surrounding one's body is warmed by body heat, it will rise and be replaced with other air. If air is moved away from one's body with a natural breeze or a fan, sweat will evaporate faster, making perspiration more effective at cooling the body, thereby increasing comfort. By contrast, comfort decreases as unevaporated perspiration increases.\nA wet bulb thermometer also uses evaporative cooling, so it provides a good measure for use in evaluating comfort level.\nDiscomfort also exists when the dew point is very low (below around ). The drier air can cause skin to crack and become irritated more easily. It will also dry out the airways. The US Occupational Safety and Health Administration recommends indoor air be maintained at with a 20\u201360% relative humidity, equivalent to a dew point of approximately (by Simple Rule calculation below).\nLower dew points, less than , correlate with lower ambient temperatures and cause the body to require less cooling. A lower dew point can go along with a high temperature only at extremely low relative humidity, allowing for relatively effective cooling.\nPeople inhabiting tropical and subtropical climates acclimatize somewhat to higher dew points. Thus, a resident of Singapore or Miami, for example, might have a higher threshold for discomfort than a resident of a temperate climate like London or Chicago. People accustomed to temperate climates often begin to feel uncomfortable when the dew point gets above , while others might find dew points up to comfortable. Most inhabitants of temperate areas will consider dew points above oppressive and tropical-like, while inhabitants of hot and humid areas may not find this uncomfortable. Thermal comfort depends not just on physical environmental factors, but also on psychological factors.\nAltitude and clouds.\nA rising air mass in the atmosphere will cool as the pressure reduces: its temperature will move closer to the dew point temperature. The relative humidity of this air increases as the pressure drops with the same amount of water vapor. This combination causes the dew point temperature to fall 0.2\u00a0\u00b0C per 100\u00a0m or 4.5\u00a0\u00b0F per 1000\u00a0ft. At the elevation where the dew point is reached condensation begins, creating clouds, or fog as it is called at low altitudes. Cumulus clouds tend to have flat bottoms marking the altitude where the temperature crosses the dew point. The condensation of water vapor into water droplets releases 600 calories of energy per gram of water, heating the surrounding air.\nMeasurement.\nDevices called hygrometers are used to measure dew point over a wide range of temperatures. These devices consist of a polished metal mirror which is cooled as air is passed over it. The dew point is revealed by observing the loss of clarity in the reflection cast by the mirror. Manual devices of this sort can be used to calibrate other types of humidity sensors, and automatic sensors may be used in a control loop with a humidifier or dehumidifier to control the dew point of the air in a building or in a smaller space for a manufacturing process.\nCalculating the dew point.\nA well-known empirical approximation used to calculate the dew point, Tdry, given just the actual (\"dry bulb\") air temperature, T (in degrees Celsius) and relative humidity (in percent), RH, is the Magnus formula:\nformula_1\nwhere b = 17.625 and c = 243.04\u00a0\u00b0C. The values of b and c were selected by minimizing the maximum deviation over the range \u221240\u00a0\u00b0C to +50\u00a0\u00b0C.\nThe more complete formulation and origin of this approximation involves the interrelated saturated water vapor pressure (in units of millibars, also called hectopascals) at T, Ps( T ), and the actual vapor pressure (also in units of millibars), Pa( T ), which can be either found with RH or approximated with the barometric pressure (in millibars), BPmbar, and \"wet-bulb\" temperature, Twet is (unless declared otherwise, all temperatures are expressed in degrees Celsius):\nformula_2\nFor greater accuracy, Ps(T) (and therefore \u03b3( T, RH ) ) can be enhanced, using part of the \"B\u00f6gel modification\", also known as the Arden Buck equation, which adds a fourth constant d:\nformula_3\nwhere\nThere are several different constant sets in use. The ones used in NOAA's presentation are taken from a 1980 paper by David Bolton in the \"Monthly Weather Review\":\nThese valuations provide a maximum error of 0.1%, for and \nAlso noteworthy is the Sonntag1990,\nAnother common set of values originates from the 1974 \"Psychrometry and Psychrometric Charts\".\nAlso, in the \"Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology\", Arden Buck provides several different valuation sets, with different maximum errors for different temperature ranges. Two particular sets provide a range of \u221240\u00a0\u00b0C to +50\u00a0\u00b0C between the two, with even lower maximum error within the indicated range than all the sets above:\nSimple approximation.\nThere is also a simple approximation that allows conversion between the dew point, temperature, and relative humidity. This approach is accurate to within about \u00b11\u00a0\u00b0C as long as the relative humidity is above 50%:\nformula_4\nThis can be expressed as a simple rule of thumb:\nFor every 1\u00a0\u00b0C difference in the dew point and dry bulb temperatures, the relative humidity decreases by 5%, starting with RH\u00a0=\u00a0100% when the dew point equals the dry bulb temperature.\nThe derivation of this approach, a discussion of its accuracy, comparisons to other approximations, and more information on the history and applications of the dew point, can be found in an article published in the \"Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society\". \nFor temperatures in degrees Fahrenheit, these approximations convert to\nformula_5\nFor example, a relative humidity of 100% means dew point is the same as air temp. For 90% {{math|RH}}, dew point is 3\u00a0\u00b0F lower than air temperature. For every 10\u00a0percent lower, dew point drops 3\u00a0\u00b0F.\nFrost point.\nThe frost point is similar to the dew point in that it is the temperature to which a given parcel of humid air must be cooled, at constant atmospheric pressure, for water vapor to be deposited on a surface as ice crystals without undergoing the liquid phase (compare with sublimation). The frost point for a given parcel of air is always higher than the dew point, as breaking the stronger bonding between water molecules on the surface of ice compared to the surface of (supercooled) liquid water requires a higher temperature.\nHistory.\nIn Ancient Greece, Aristotle considered that dew fell from the sky. During the Renaissance, Ferdinando II de' Medici built a hygrometer to track the temperature and wind conditions that lead to water formation.\nIn the 18th century, Charles Le Roy attempted to determine the dew point by pouring cold water into a glass container.\nThe first modern theory of dew was composed by William Charles Wells, who published his experiments in his 1818 \"Essay on Dew\". Meteorologist John Aitken demonstrated in 1887 that dew comes from the earth or from the plants, and does not fall from air.\nThe highest dew point ever recorded on Earth is {{convert|35|\u00b0C|F}} (with a temperature of {{convert|42|\u00b0C|F}}), observed at Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, at 3:00\u00a0p.m. on 8 July 2003."}

The first documented use of the word gamecock, denoting use of the cock as to a \"game\", a sport, pastime or entertainment, was recorded in 1634, after the term \"cock of the game\" used by George Wilson, in the earliest known book on the sport of cockfighting in \"The Commendation of Cocks and Cock Fighting\" in 1607. But it was during Ferdinand Magellan's voyage of discovery of the Philippines in 1521 when modern cockfighting was first witnessed and documented for Westerners by the Italian Antonio Pigafetta, Magellan's chronicler, in the Kingdom of Taytay.\nThe gamecocks (not to be confused with game birds) are specially bred and conditioned for increased stamina and strength. Male and female chickens of such a breed are referred to as gamefowl. Cocks are also bred to be aggressive towards other males of their species. Wagers are often made on the outcome of the match, held in a ring called a cockpit.\nCockfighting is a blood sport due in some part to the physical trauma the cocks inflict on each other, which is sometimes increased by attaching metal spurs to the cocks' natural spurs. While not all fights are to the death, the cocks may endure significant physical trauma. In some areas around the world, cockfighting is still practiced as a mainstream event; in some countries it is regulated by law, or forbidden outright.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nProcess.\nTwo owners place their gamecock in the cockpit. The cocks fight until one of them dies or is critically injured. Historically, this was in a \"cockpit\", a term which was also used in the 16th century to mean a place of entertainment or frenzied activity. William Shakespeare used the term in \"Henry V\" to specifically mean the area around the stage of a theatre. In Tudor times, the Palace of Westminster had a permanent cockpit, called the Cockpit-in-Court.\nHistory.\nCockfighting is an ancient spectator sport. There is evidence that cockfighting was a pastime in the Indus Valley civilization. The Encyclopedia Britannica (2008) holds:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The sport was popular in ancient times in India, China, Persia, and other Eastern countries and was introduced into Ancient Greece in the time of Themistocles (c.\u00a0524\u2013460\u00a0BC). For a long time the Romans affected to despise this \"Greek diversion\", but they ended up adopting it so enthusiastically that the agricultural writer Columella (1st century AD) complained that its devotees often spent their whole patrimony in betting at the side of the pit.\nBased on his analysis of a Mohenjo-daro seal, Iravatham Mahadevan speculates that the city's ancient name could have been Kukkutarma (\"the city [-rma] of the cockerel [kukkuta]\"). However, according to a recent study, \"it is not known whether these birds made much contribution to the modern domestic fowl. Chickens from the Harappan culture of the Indus Valley (2500\u20132100 BC) may have been the main source of diffusion throughout the world.\" Also, \"Within the Indus Valley, indications are that chickens were used for sport and not for food (Zeuner 1963)\", and by 1000 BC they had assumed \"religious significance\".\nIn China, the first recorded cockfight took place in 517 BC.\nSome additional insight into the pre-history of European and American secular cockfighting may be taken from \"The London Encyclopaedia\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;At first cockfighting was partly a religious and partly a political institution at Athens; and was continued for improving the seeds of valor in the minds of their youth, but was afterwards perverted both there and in the other parts of Greece to a common pastime, without any political or religious intention.\nAn early image of a fighting rooster has been found on a 6th-century BC seal of Jaazaniah from the biblical city of Mizpah in Benjamin, near Jerusalem. Remains of these birds have been found at other Israelite Iron Age sites, when the rooster was used as a fighting bird; they are also pictured on other seals from the period as a symbol of ferocity, such as the late-7th-century BC red jasper seal inscribed \"Jehoahaz, son of the king\", which likely belonged to Jehoahaz of Judah \"while he was still a prince during his father's life\".\nThe anthropologist Clifford Geertz wrote the influential essay \"\", on the meaning of the cockfight in Balinese culture.\nRegional variations.\nIn some regional variations, the birds are equipped with either metal spurs (called \"gaffs\") or knives, tied to the leg in the area where the bird's natural spur has been partially removed. A \"cockspur\" is a bracelet (often made of leather) with a curved, sharp spike which is attached to the leg of the bird. The spikes typically range in length from \"short spurs\" of just over an inch to \"long spurs\" almost two and a half inches long. In the highest levels of 17th century English cockfighting, the spikes were made of silver. The sharp spurs have been known to injure or even kill the bird handlers. In the \"naked heel\" variation, the bird's natural spurs are left intact and sharpened: fighting is done without gaffs or taping, particularly in India (especially in Tamil Nadu). There it is mostly fought naked heel and either three rounds of twenty minutes with a gap of again twenty minutes or four rounds of fifteen minutes each and a gap of fifteen minutes between them.\nCockfighting is common throughout Southeast Asia, where it is implicated in spreading bird flu. Cockfighting is a popular form of fertility worship in Southeast Asia.\nIndia.\nThe sport of cockfighting has long been outlawed in India, with the Supreme Court proclaiming the practice to be in direct violation of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1960. According to M Ravindranath Babu Superintendent, Indian Police, it is also considered a hijack of traditional festivals to promote illegal betting and gambling. Despite this, institutional resistance to government bans on cockfighting occurs. At India's \u2018Sun God\u2019 festival in 2012, the local Bharatiya Janata Party district committee campaigned for the right to have cock-fights. This was then agreed by local police if it took place inside the temples.\nCockfights are currently common in the southern Indian states of Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka and in Tulu N\u0101du it is a tradition after any ritual to conduct cockfight despite a countrywide ban imposed in 1960. It is a regional spectacle primarily taking place in January, coinciding with harvest festival celebrations. Like Jallikattu, Cock fighting () an ancient spectator sport is mentioned in Sangam literature \"Pa\u1e6d\u1e6di\u1e49app\u0101lai\" and \"Tirumuruk\u0101\u1e5f\u1e5fuppa\u1e6dai.\"\nIndonesia.\nCockfighting is a very old tradition in Balinese Hinduism, the Batur Bang Inscriptions I (from the year 933) and the Batuan Inscription (dated 944 on the Balinese Caka calendar) disclose that the \"tabuh rah\" ritual has existed for centuries.\nIn Bali, cockfights, known as \"tajen\" or \"\", are practiced in an ancient religious purification ritual to expel evil spirits. This ritual, a form of animal sacrifice, is called \"tabuh rah\" (\"pouring blood\"). The purpose of tabuh rah is to provide an offering (the blood of the losing chicken) to the evil spirits. Cockfighting is a religious obligation at every Balinese temple festival or religious ceremony. Cockfights without a religious purpose are considered gambling in Indonesia, although it is still largely practiced in many parts of Indonesia. Women are generally not involved in the tabuh rah process. The tabuh rah process is held on the largest pavilion in a Balinese temple complex, the wantilan.\nThe American anthropologist Clifford Geertz published his most famous work, \"\", on the practice of cockfights in Bali. In it, he argued that the cockfight served as a pastiche or model of wider Balinese society from which judgments about other aspects of the culture could be drawn.\nPhilippines.\nCockfighting was already flourishing in pre-colonial Philippines, as recorded by Antonio Pigafetta, the Italian diarist aboard Ferdinand Magellan's 1521 expedition.\nCockfighting, locally termed \"sabong\", remains a popular pastime in the Philippines, where both illegal and legal cockfights occur. Legal cockfights are held in cockpits every week, whilst illegal ones, called \"tupada\" or \"tigbakay\", are held in secluded cockpits where authorities cannot raid them. In both types, knives or \"gaffs\" are used. There are two kinds of knives used in Philippine cockfighting: single-edged blades (used in derbies) and double-edged blades; lengths of knives also vary. All knives are attached on the left leg of the bird, but depending on agreement between owners, blades can be attached on the right or even on both legs. \"Sabong\" and illegal \"tupada\", are judged by a referee called \"sentensyador\" or \"koyme\", whose verdict is final and not subject to any appeal. Bets are usually taken by the \"kristo\", so named because of his outstretched hands when calling out wagers from the audience from memory.\nThe World Slasher Cup as an international cockfighting derbies biannually held at the Araneta Coliseum in Quezon City. It was established in 1990 as international tournament But its origins dates back as early as the 1960s\nOther bird species.\nMale saffron finches and canaries have been used in fights on occasion.\nLegal status.\nArgentina.\nArticle 3.8 of Law 14.346 on the Ill-Treatment and Acts of Cruelty to Animals of 1954 explicitly prohibits 'carrying out public or private acts of animal fights, fights of bulls and heifers, or parodies [thereof], in which animals are killed, wounded or harassed.'\nAustralia.\nCockfighting, and the possession of cockfighting equipment, is illegal in Australia and punishable with prison time.\nBelgium.\nIn Belgium, cockfights have been prohibited since 1867. In 1929 all organised fights between animals were banned. In 1986 and 1991, the animal welfare act was amended by also criminalising attendance of cockfights. Offenders risk six months imprisonment and a fine of 2,000 euros. Since the 1990s, several people have been prosecuted for cockfighting.\nBrazil.\nCockfighting (\"rinha de galos\") was banned in 1934 with the help of President Get\u00falio Vargas through Brazil's 1934 constitution, passed on 16 July. Based on the recognition of animal rights in the Constitution, a Brazilian Supreme Court ruling resulted in the ban of animal related activities that involve claimed \"animal suffering such as cockfighting, and a tradition practiced in southern Brazil, known as 'Farra do Boi' (the Oxen Festival)\", stating that \"animals also have the right to legal protection against mistreatment and suffering\".\nCanada.\nCanada's Criminal Code includes animal cruelty legislation, which criminalize any kind of fighting or baiting of any animal. These laws have been amended and made more restrictive over time, and as of 2018 include bans on fighting, promoting, arranging and profiting from fights, as well as breeding, training and transporting of animals for the purpose of fights and keeping of arenas for the purpose of animal fights, for animals of any kind.\nChile.\nChilean Law no. 20.380 on Animal Protection of 25 August 2009 explicitly exempts various forms of 'animal sports' in Article 16: 'The norms of this law will not apply to sports in which animals participate, such as rodeo, cowfights, movement to the rein and equestrian sports, which will be governed by their respective regulations.' Although Law 20.380 does not explicitly prohibit cockfighting or other animal fighting, its performance constitutes animal abuse since the law's enactment in 2009. This was corroborated in 2011 under Decree 785 of the Ministry of Justice, \u00a0which states that \"...with the enactment of Law 20,380, published on October 3, 2009, on animal protection, cockfights or cockfights are absolutely prohibited, since they clearly constitute animal abuse\".\nColombia.\nIn Colombia, cockfighting is a tradition, especially in the Caribbean region and in some areas of the Andean interior. Cockfights are held during the Festival de la Leyenda Vallenata in Valledupar. In August 2010, the Constitutional Court of Colombia rejected a lawsuit that sought to prohibit bullfighting, and cockfighting with the argument that they constitute animal abuse. In March 2019, the same court confirmed such rule, under the argument that cockfighting and bullfighting are traditions with cultural roots in some municipalities of the country. The \"Asociaci\u00f3n Nacional de Criadores de Gallos de Pelea\" organizes an international cockfighting championship.\nCockfighting was immortalized in the novel \"One Hundred Years of Solitude\" by Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, in episodes such as the events that led to the death of Prudencio Aguilar, or the fondness for it by Jos\u00e9 Arcadio Segundo. Cockfighting was one of the main subjects of \"La caponera\", a TV adaptation of Juan Rulfo's novel, \"El gallo de oro\", aired in Colombia and other countries in the region during the late 1990s.\nCosta Rica.\nCockfights have been illegal in Costa Rica since 1922. The government deems the activity as animal cruelty, public disorder and a risk for public health and is routinely repressed by the State's National Secretary for Animal Welfare. The activity is also rejected by most of the population, as 88% of Costa Ricans dislike cockfights according to recent polls of the National University. Since 2017, the activity is punishable with up to two years of prison.\nCuba.\nIn Cuba, cockfighting is legal and popular, although gambling on matches has been banned since the 1959 Revolution. The state has opened official arenas, locally known as \"galleras\", including a 1,000-seat venue in Ciego de \u00c1vila, but there are also banned underground cockfighting pits.\nCockfighting was so common following the Spanish conquest in the early 16th century that there were arenas in every urban and rural town. The first official known document about cockfighting in Cuba dates from 1737. It is a royal decree asking, to the governor of the island, a report about the inconveniences that might cause cockfights \"with the people from land and sea\" and asking for information about rentals of the games. The Spaniard Miguel Tac\u00f3n, Lieutenant General and governor of the colony, banned cockfighting by a decree dated on October 20, 1835, limiting these spectacles only to holidays.\nIn 1844, a decree dictated by the Captain General of the island, Leopoldo O'Donnell, forbade non-white people to attend these shows. During the second half of the 19th century, many authorizations were conceded for building arenas, until General Juan Rius Rivera, then civilian governor in Havana, prohibited cockfighting by a decree of October 31, 1899, and later the Cuban governor, General Leonard Wood, dictated the military order no. 165 prohibiting cockfights in the whole country from June 1, 1900.\nIn the first half of the 20th century, legality of cockfights suffered several ups and downs.\nIn 1909, the then-Cuban president Jos\u00e9 Miguel G\u00f3mez, with the intention of gaining followers, allowed cockfights once again, and then regulations were agreed for the fights.\nUp to the beginning of 1968, cockfights used to be held everywhere in the country, but with the purpose of stopping the bets, the arenas were closed and the fights forbidden by the authorities. In 1980, authorities legalized cockfights again and a state business organization was created with the participation of the private breeders, grouped in territories. Every year the state organization announces several national tournaments from January to April, makes trade shows and sells fighting cocks to clients from other Caribbean countries.\nDominican Republic.\nIn the Dominican Republic, cockfighting is legal, but according to \"Dominican Today\" 'increasingly rejected by society' as of December 2018. There is at least one arena (\"gallera)\" in every town, whereas in bigger cities larger \"coliseos\" can be found. Important fights are broadcast on television and newspapers have dedicated pages to cockfights and the different \"trabas\", the local name for gamefowl breeding grounds. Those dedicated to the breeding and training of fighting cocks are called or . The cocks are often outfitted with special spurs made from various materials (ranging from plastic to metal or even carey shell) and fights are typically to the death.\nEast Timor.\nCockfighting and cockfighting betting is legal on licensed venues.\nFrance.\nHolding cockfights is a crime in France, but there is an exemption under subparagraph 3 of article 521\u20131 of the French penal code for cockfights and bullfights in locales where an uninterrupted tradition exists for them. Thus, cockfighting is allowed in the Nord-Pas de Calais region, where it takes place in a small number of towns including Raimbeaucourt, La Bistade and other villages around Lille. However, the construction of new cockfighting areas is prohibited, a law upheld by the Constitutional Council of France in 2015.\nCockfighting is also legal in some French Overseas Territories.\nGermany.\nCockfights have no tradition in Germany. They are illegal under increasingly stringent criminal law since 1871.\nHaiti.\nCockfighting is legal in Haiti. Nevins (2015) described it as 'the closest thing to a national sport in Haiti', being organised every Sunday morning in places across the country. Sharp spurs are attached to the roosters' feet to make them extra lethal, and the fight usually ends with the death of one of the animals.\nHonduras.\nIn Honduras, under Article 11 of 'Decree no. 115-2015 \u2500 Animal Protection and Welfare Act' that went into effect in 2016, dog and cat fights and duck races are prohibited, while 'bullfighting shows and cockfights are part of the National Folklore and as such allowed'.\nIndia.\nThe Supreme Court of India has banned cockfighting as a violation of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, but it remains popular, especially in the rural coast of Andhra Pradesh, with large amount of betting involved, especially around the festival of Sankranti.\nIndonesia.\nAll forms of gambling, including the gambling within secular cockfighting, were made illegal in 1981 by the Indonesian government, while the religious aspects of cockfighting within Balinese Hinduism remain protected. However, secular cockfighting remains widely popular in Bali, despite its illegal status.\nIraq.\nCockfighting is illegal but widespread in Iraq. The attendees come to gamble or just for the entertainment. A rooster can cost up to $8,000, or \u20b923,000.00. The most-prized birds are called Harati, which means that they are of Turkish or Indian origin, and have muscular legs and necks.\nJapan.\nCockfighting was introduced to Japan from China in the early 8th century and rose to popularity in the Kamakura period and the Edo period. Cockfighting endured in some Japanese regions even after being banned in 1873, during the Meiji period.\nMalaysia.\nOnly ritual cockfighting as done for Gawai celebrations in the state of Sarawak is allowed under strict regulations; licenses given however can be frozen or revoked at will by the Sarawakian government. Cockfighting venues are often raided by Sarawakian police from time to time. All other forms of animal fighting and baiting are prohibited under the Animal Welfare Act (2015).\nMadagascar.\nBetting on cock fights is a common and legal way of gambling in Madagascar.\nMexico.\nThere are cockfight bans in the country's capital, Mexico City, and in the states of Sonora and Coahuila since September 11, 2012, and in Veracruz since November 6, 2018.\nCockfighting is tolerated in the Mexican states of Michoac\u00e1n, Aguascalientes, Jalisco, and Sinaloa; mostly during regional fairs and other celebrations. Cockfights are performed in \"palenques\" (pits). Cockfighting remains legal in the municipality of Ixmiquilpan and throughout Mexico.\nThe two parties to the bird fights are traditionally distinguished by red and green, typically by wearing a scarf or badge hanging on the belt. Cockfighting may be combined with a musical show. Fairs and regional festivals of the country's municipalities are held in venues called \"palenques\" of roosters. These consist of a ring made of wood whose center is full of compacted earth for the best 'performance' of the roosters. In the center, a box 4 meters per side and lines that cross from center to center each side are marked with lime. Finally, the last square, measuring 40\u00a0cm on each side, is marked in the center of the arena, where the roosters are taken the third time they are released.\nNetherlands.\nIn the Netherlands, organising or attending cockfights is illegal and punishable by up to three years imprisonment, or a fine of up to 20,500 euros.\nNew Zealand.\nThe act of cockfighting is illegal under the Animal Welfare Act 1999, as is the possession, training and breeding of cocks for fighting.\nPakistan.\nCockfighting was a popular sport in rural Pakistan; however, \"betting is illegal under the Prevention of Gambling Act 1977\". Betting is illegal, but police often turn a blind eye towards it. In Sindh, people are fond of keeping a fighting cock breed known as \"Sindhi Aseel\". These cocks are noted for being tall, heavy and good at fighting. Another popular breed is called \"Mianwali Aseel\". In Sindh, gamblers use almonds and other enhancing medicines to feed the fighter cocks.\nPanama.\nLaw 308 on the Protection of Animals was approved by the National Assembly of Panama on 15 March 2012. Article 7 of the law states: 'Dog fights, animal races, bullfights \u2013 whether of the Spanish or Portuguese style \u2013 the breeding, entry, permanence and operation in the national territory of all kinds of circus or circus show that uses trained animals of any species, are prohibited.' However, horse racing and cockfighting were exempt from the ban.\nParaguay.\nOrganising fights between all animals, both in public and private, is prohibited in Paraguay under Law No. 4840 on Animal Protection and Welfare, promulgated on 28 January 2013. Specifically:\nPeru.\nAccording to the \"Encyclopedia of Latino Culture\", Peru \"has probably the longest historical tradition\" with cockfighting, with the practice possibly dating back to the 16th century. Cockfighting is legal and regulated by the government in Peru. Most pits (\"coliseos\") in the country are located in Lima. Cockfighting and bullfighting are exempt from Peru's animal protection laws.\nIn October 2018, over 5,000 Peruvians signed a petition that called for a constitutional ban on \"all cruel shows using animals\" including cockfighting and bullfighting, which was accepted and taken into consideration by the Supreme Court of Peru. However, with only three of the five required judges agreeing with the petition, on 25 February 2020 the Court ruled that it could not declare the animal fighting practices unconstitutional, leaving the applicants with no further option of appeal. A week before the verdict, thousands of other people had marched through the streets of Lima in support of the animal fighting practices.\nPhilippines.\nThere is no nationwide ban of cockfighting in the Philippines but since 1948, cockfighting is prohibited every Rizal Day on December 30 where violators can be fined or imprisoned due to the Republic Act No. 229. It further is supplemented by Presidential Decree No. 449 or the Anti-Cockfighting Law of 1974 which allows cockfights only on Sundays, certain holidays, and on certain other occasions, and only at licensed cockpits.\nOn March 14, 2020, the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) announced that cockfighting is temporarily banned in the Philippines due to the prohibition of mass gatherings amid the coronavirus pandemic and community quarantines across the Philippines.\nDavao City Mayor Sara Duterte banned cockfighting in Davao City since April 16, 2020, also due to the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe Philippines has deep cultural roots connected to cockfighting that goes back to ancient times. It can be said that the Filipinos brought a major wave of cockfighting over to Hawaii when the Filipinos first arrived, even though it was widely condemned by locals of the area.\nThe popularity of cockfighting in the Philippines has extended into the digital space, with the advent of online sabong or e-sabong. This virtual iteration allows enthusiasts to participate in and bet on cockfights via internet streaming. The surge in online cockfighting has been significantly facilitated by the integration of modern technologies, particularly through online casino platforms that host these events. The Philippines is the only country in the world that accepts online betting on cockfighting. There are reports of revenues being in the billions of dollars. Some politicians have sought to ban apps like GCash, arguing that they have played a crucial role by offering a convenient and secure method for placing bets and managing transactions online.\nPoland.\nCockfighting in Poland is banned. The law bans any animal cruelty in general, there are no specific laws for cockfighting. Likewise in many other European countries, this activity used to be popular up to the 18th century. In the Silesia area it used to be popular longer, even in the 19th century. It was usually held on the Day of Saint Gall (16 October). This activity was banned on most of the territory of Poland after the Partitions of Poland and before the country regained its independence in 1918. In western areas that were held by Germany, it was banned in 1871 by \u00a7 360 p.\u00a013 of the Penal Code of the German Reich. In eastern areas that were held by Russia, it was banned in 1903 by \u00a7 287 of the Penal Code of Nikolay Stefanovich Tagantsev. After regaining independence these laws were still in power until new laws were passed. The first animal-cruelty law in independent Poland was passed in 1928 as a presidential decree and it was in power until 1997. It was added to the official Penalty Code in 1997 by \u00a7 35 points 1\u20132 in chapter 11. Currently, the penalty for the act is up to 3 years in prison or it might be up to 5 years if the cruelty is more drastic.\nRomania.\nCockfights are illegal in Romania under article 25.3 lit. c) of the Law 205/2004, with punishments ranging from 2 to 7 years imprisonment.\nSpain.\nCockfighting is banned in Spain except in two Spanish regions: the Canary Islands and Andalusia. In Andalusia, however, the activity has virtually disappeared, surviving only within a program to maintain the fighting breed \"combatiente espa\u00f1ol\" coordinated by the University of C\u00f3rdoba. Spain's Animal Protection Law of 1991 recognizes an exception for these regions based on cultural heritage and a history of cockfighting in the region. Animal rights organizations have sought to ban the bloodsport nationwide, but have not been successful in advancing legislation through the Spanish Parliament.\nUkraine.\nIn Ukraine, cockfights, as well as fights involving other animals (dogs, geese, etc.) are prohibited by Art. 25 of the Law of Ukraine \"On the Protection of Animals from Cruelty\" and Art. 299 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine. For organizing cockfights, the culprit can be sentenced to a fine of up to 850 hryvnias (Ukrainian currency) or imprisonment for up to six months. \nUnited Kingdom.\nCockfighting was banned outright in England and Wales and in the British Overseas Territories with the Cruelty to Animals Act 1835. Sixty years later, in 1895, cockfighting was also banned in Scotland, where it had been relatively common in the 18th century. A reconstructed cockpit from Denbigh in North Wales may be found at St Fagans National History Museum in Cardiff and a reference exists in 1774 to a cockpit at Stanecastle in Scotland. One of the few perfect examples of a cockpit which still exist today can be found on Chislehurst Common, in southeast London.\nAccording to a 2017 report by the RSPCA, cockfighting in England and Wales was at a five-year high.\nUnited States.\nAs of 2023[ [update]], cockfighting is illegal in all 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and all U.S. territories. The last state to implement a state law banning cockfighting was Louisiana; the Louisiana State Legislature voted to approve a ban in June 2007, which went into effect in August 2008.\nAs of 2013:\nAdditionally, the 2014 farm bill, signed into law by President Barack Obama, contained a provision making it a federal crime to attend an animal fighting event or bring a child under the age of 16 to an animal fighting event.\nThe cockfighting ban was further extended by federal law to include U.S. territories\u2014American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands\u2014effective at the end of 2019, as signed into law in the 2018 farm bill by President Donald Trump. In Puerto Rico, cockfighting is popular and has been considered a \"national sport\" since at least the 1950s. According to a National Park Service report, it generates about $100 million annually. There are some 200,000 fighting birds annually on the island. Puerto Rico's Cockfighting Commission regulates 87 clubs, but many non-government sanctioned \"underground\" cockfighting operations exist. On December 18, 2019, estimating that cockfighting employs 27,000 people and has a value to the economy of about $18 million, Puerto Rico passed a law attempting to keep the practice legal despite the imminent federal ban. In 2021, governor Pedro Pierluisi announced the government would support a legal effort before the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn the ban. The Supreme Court refused to hear the case, \"Ortiz-Diaz v. United States\", in October 2021, leaving the federal ban in place.\nThe Animal Fighting Prohibition Enforcement Act, a federal law that made it a federal crime to transfer cockfighting implements across state or national borders and increasing the penalty for violations of federal animal fighting laws to three years in prison, became law in 2007. It passed the House of Representatives 368\u201339 and the Senate by unanimous consent and was signed into law by President George W. Bush.\nThe Animal Welfare Act was amended again in 2008 when provisions were included in the 2008 Farm Bill (P.L. 110\u2013246). These provisions tightened prohibitions on dog and other animal fighting activities, and increased penalties for violations of the act.\nMajor law enforcement raids against cockfighting occurred in February 2014 in New York State (when 3,000 birds were seized and nine men were charged with felony animal-fighting in \"Operation Angry Birds\", the state's largest-ever cockfighting bust) and in May 2017 in California (when the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department seized 7,000 cockfighting birds at a ranch in Val Verde, California, one of the largest cockfighting busts in U.S. history).\nVietnam.\nCockfighting is popular in Vietnam, with a long history dating back to the L\u00fd dynasty. According to historical records, the soldiers of L\u00fd Th\u01b0\u1eddng Ki\u1ec7t brought the practice back to Vietnam after conquering Champa. During the feudal era, cockfighting was a popular form of entertainment for the emperor, officials, and the upper class. The emperors often held cockfights during festivals such as T\u1ebft Nguy\u00ean \u0110\u00e1n (Vietnamese New Year) and T\u1ebft Trung Thu (Mid-Autumn Festival) to entertain their guests.\nWhile cockfighting was initially popular amongst ethnic minorities in rural and mountainous areas, it is no longer limited to any particular demographic, or geographic region. Though still popular amongst amateurs, with local tournaments organized across the country, a commercialized, cockfighting industry has emerged. Police have taken down large-scale cockfighting dens and rings through parts of the country, with arrests being made as well as seizures of roosters and money as evidence. Large amounts of money were being gambled in these rings. \nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "54923", "revid": "28903366", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54923", "title": "Fast-food restaurant", "text": "Type of restaurant\nA fast-food restaurant, also known as a quick-service restaurant (QSR) within the industry, is a specific type of restaurant that serves fast-food cuisine and has minimal table service. The food served in fast-food restaurants is typically part of a \"meat-sweet diet\", offered from a limited menu, cooked in bulk in advance and kept hot, finished and packaged to order, and usually available for take away, though seating may be provided. Fast-food restaurants are typically part of a restaurant chain or franchise operation that provides standardized ingredients and/or partially prepared foods and supplies to each restaurant through controlled supply channels. The term \"fast food\" was recognized in a dictionary by Merriam\u2013Webster in 1951.\nWhile the first fast-food restaurant in the United States was a White Castle in 1921, fast-food restaurants had been operating elsewhere much earlier, such as the Japanese fast food company Yoshinoya, started in Tokyo in 1899. Today, American-founded fast-food chains such as McDonald's (est. 1940) and KFC (est. 1952) are multinational corporations with outlets across the globe.\nVariations on the fast-food restaurant concept include fast-casual restaurants and catering trucks. Fast-casual restaurants have higher sit-in ratios, offering a hybrid between counter-service typical at fast-food restaurants and a traditional table service restaurant. Catering trucks (also called food trucks) often park just outside worksites and are popular with factory workers.\nHistory.\nIn 1896, the first self-service restaurant (the \"Stollwerck-Automatenrestaurant\") opened in Berlin's Leipziger Stra\u00dfe.\nUnited States.\nSome trace the modern history of fast food in the United States to 7 July 1912, with the opening of a fast-food restaurant called the Automat in New York. The Automat was a cafeteria with its prepared foods behind small glass windows and coin-operated slots. Joseph Horn and Frank Hardart had already opened the first Horn &amp; Hardart Automat in Philadelphia in 1902, but their \"Automat\" at Broadway and 13th Street, in New York City, created a sensation. Numerous Automat restaurants were built around the country to deal with the demand. Automats remained extremely popular throughout the 1920s and 1930s. The company also popularized the notion of \"take-out\" food, with their slogan \"Less work for Mother\".\nMost historians agree that the American company White Castle was the first fast-food outlet, starting in Wichita, Kansas in 1916 with food stands and founding in 1921, selling hamburgers for five cents apiece from its inception and spawning numerous competitors and emulators. What is certain, however, is that White Castle made the first significant effort to standardize the food production in, look of, and operation of fast-food hamburger restaurants. William Ingram's and Walter Anderson's White Castle System created the first fast-food supply chain to provide meat, buns, paper goods, and other supplies to their restaurants, pioneered the concept of the multi-state hamburger restaurant chain, standardized the look and construction of the restaurants themselves, and even developed a construction division that manufactured and built the chain's prefabricated restaurant buildings. The McDonald's Speedee Service System and, much later, Ray Kroc's McDonald's outlets and Hamburger University all built on principles, systems and practices that White Castle had already established between 1923 and 1932.\nThe hamburger restaurant most associated by the public with the term \"fast food\" was created by two brothers originally from Nashua, New Hampshire. Richard and Maurice McDonald opened a barbecue drive-in in 1940 in the city of San Bernardino, California. After discovering that most of their profits came from hamburgers, the brothers closed their restaurant for three months and reopened it in 1948 as a walk-up stand offering a simple menu of hamburgers, french fries, shakes, coffee, and Coca-Cola, served in disposable paper wrapping. As a result, they could produce hamburgers and fries constantly, without waiting for customer orders, and could serve them immediately; hamburgers cost 15 cents, about half the price at a typical diner. Their streamlined production method, which they named the \"Speedee Service System\" was influenced by the production line innovations of Henry Ford.\nBy 1954, The McDonald brothers' stand was restaurant equipment manufacturer Prince Castle's biggest purchaser of milkshake blending machines. Prince Castle salesman Ray Kroc traveled to California to discover why the company had purchased almost a dozen of the units as opposed to the normal one or two found in most restaurants of the time. Enticed by the success of the McDonald's concept, Kroc signed a franchise agreement with the brothers and began opening McDonald's restaurants in Illinois. By 1961, Kroc had bought out the brothers and created what is now the modern McDonald's Corporation. One of the major parts of his business plan was to promote cleanliness of his restaurants to growing groups of Americans that had become aware of food safety issues. As part of his commitment to cleanliness, Kroc often took part in cleaning his own Des Plaines, Illinois outlet by hosing down the garbage cans and scraping gum off the cement. Another concept Kroc added was great swaths of glass which enabled the customer to view the food preparation, a practice still found in chains such as Krispy Kreme. A clean atmosphere was only part of Kroc's grander plan which separated McDonald's from the rest of the competition and attributes to their great success. Kroc envisioned making his restaurants appeal to suburban families.\nAt roughly the same time as Kroc was conceiving what eventually became McDonald's Corporation, two Miami, Florida businessmen, James McLamore and David Edgerton, opened a franchise of the predecessor to what is now the international fast-food restaurant chain Burger King. McLamore had visited the original McDonald's hamburger stand belonging to the McDonald brothers; sensing potential in their innovative assembly line\u2013based production system, he decided he wanted to open a similar operation of his own. The two partners eventually decided to invest their money in Jacksonville, Florida-based Insta-Burger King. Originally opened in 1953, the founders and owners of the chain, Keith G. Cramer and his wife's uncle Matthew Burns, opened their first stores around a piece of equipment known as the Insta-Broiler. The Insta-Broiler oven proved so successful at cooking burgers, they required all of their franchises to carry the device.\nBy 1959, McLamore and Edgarton were operating several locations in the Miami-Dade County, Florida area and were growing at a fast clip. Despite the success of their operation, the partners discovered that the design of the insta-broiler made the unit's heating elements prone to degradation from the drippings of the beef patties. The pair eventually created a mechanized gas grill that avoided the problems by changing the way the meat patties were cooked in the unit. After the original company began to falter in 1959, it was purchased by McLamore and Edgerton who renamed the company Burger King.\nWhile fast-food restaurants usually have a seating area in which customers can eat the food on the premises, orders are designed to be taken away, and traditional table service is rare. Orders are generally taken and paid for at a wide counter, with the customer waiting by the counter for a tray or container for their food. A \"drive-through\" service can allow customers to order and pick up food from their cars.\nNearly from its inception, fast food has been designed to be eaten \"on the go\" and often does not require traditional cutlery and is eaten as a finger food. Common menu items at fast-food outlets include fish and chips, sandwiches, pitas, hamburgers, fried chicken, french fries, chicken nuggets, tacos, pizza, and ice cream, although many fast-food restaurants offer \"slower\" foods like chili, mashed potatoes, and salads.\nCuisine.\nModern commercial fast food is highly processed and prepared on a large scale from bulk ingredients using standardized cooking and production methods and equipment. It is usually rapidly served in cartons, bags, or in a plastic wrapping, in a fashion which reduces operating costs by allowing rapid product identification and counting, promoting longer holding time, avoiding transfer of bacteria, and facilitating order fulfillment. In most fast-food operations, menu items are generally made from processed ingredients prepared at central supply facilities and then shipped to individual outlets where they are cooked (usually by grill, microwave, or deep-frying) or assembled in a short amount of time either in anticipation of upcoming orders (i.e., \"to stock\") or in response to actual orders (i.e., \"to order\"). Following standard operating procedures, pre-cooked products are monitored for freshness and disposed of if holding times become excessive. This process ensures a consistent level of product quality, and is key to delivering the order quickly to the customer and avoiding labor and equipment costs in the individual stores.\nBecause of commercial emphasis on taste, speed, product safety, uniformity, and low cost, fast-food products are made with ingredients formulated to achieve an identifiable flavor, aroma, texture, and \"mouth feel\" and to preserve freshness and control handling costs during preparation and order fulfillment. This requires a high degree of food engineering. The use of additives, including salt, sugar, flavorings and preservatives, and processing techniques may limit the nutritional value of the final product.\nValue meals.\nA \"value meal\" is a group of menu items offered together at a lower price than they would cost individually. A hamburger, side of fries, and drink commonly constitute a value meal\u2014or \"combo\" depending on the chain. Value meals at fast-food restaurants are common as a merchandising tactic to facilitate bundling, up-selling, and price discrimination. Most of the time they can be upgraded to a larger side and drink for a small fee. The perceived creation of a \"discount\" on individual menu items in exchange for the purchase of a \"meal\" is also consistent with the loyalty marketing school of thought.\nTechnology.\nEarly fast-food production relied on manual, physical methods of tracking orders, such as order wheels.\nTo make quick service possible and to ensure accuracy and security, many fast-food restaurants have incorporated hospitality point of sale systems. This makes it possible for kitchen crew people to view orders placed at the front counter or drive through in real time. Wireless systems allow orders placed at drive through speakers to be taken by cashiers and cooks. Drive through and walk through configurations will allow orders to be taken at one register and paid at another. Modern point of sale systems can operate on computer networks using a variety of software programs. Sales records can be generated and remote access to computer reports can be given to corporate offices, managers, troubleshooters, and other authorized personnel.\nFood service chains partner with food equipment manufacturers to design highly specialized restaurant equipment, often incorporating heat sensors, timers, and other electronic controls into the design. Collaborative design techniques, such as rapid visualization and computer-aided design of restaurant kitchens are now being used to establish equipment specifications that are consistent with restaurant operating and merchandising requirements.\nBusiness.\nConsumer spending.\nIn the United States, consumers spent about $110 billion on fast food in 2000 (which increased from $6 billion in 1970). The National Restaurant Association forecasts that fast-food restaurants in the US will reach $142 billion in sales in 2006, a 5% increase over 2005. In comparison, the full-service restaurant segment of the food industry is expected to generate $173 billion in sales. Fast food has been losing market share to so-called fast-casual restaurants, which offer more robust and expensive cuisines.\nMajor international brands.\nMcDonald's, a fast-food supplier, opened its first franchised restaurant in the US in 1955 (1974 in the UK). It has become a phenomenally successful enterprise in terms of financial growth, brand-name recognition, and worldwide expansion. Ray Kroc, who bought the franchising license from the McDonald brothers, pioneered concepts which emphasized standardization. He introduced uniform products, identical in all respects at each outlet, to increase sales. Kroc also insisted on cutting food costs as much as possible, eventually using the McDonald's Corporation's size to force suppliers to conform to this ethos.\nOther prominent international fast-food companies include Burger King, the number two hamburger chain in the world, known for promoting its customized menu offerings (\"Have it Your Way\"). Another international fast-food chain is KFC, which sells chicken-related products and is the number 1 fast-food company in the People's Republic of China.\nFranchising.\nA fast-food chain restaurant is generally owned either by the parent company of the fast-food chain or a franchisee \u2013 an independent party given the right to use the company's trademark and trade name. In the latter case, a contract is made between the franchisee and the parent company, typically requiring the franchisee to pay an initial, fixed fee in addition to a continual percentage of monthly sales. Upon opening for business, the franchisee oversees the day-to-day operations of the restaurant and acts as a manager of the store. Once the contract expires, the parent company may choose to \"renew the contract, sell the franchise to another franchisee, or operate the restaurant itself.\" In most fast-food chains, the number of franchised locations exceeds the number of company owned locations.\nFast-food chains rely on consistency and uniformity, in internal operations and brand image, across all of their restaurant locations in order to convey a sense of reliability to their customers. This sense of reliability coupled with a positive customer experience brings customers to place trust in the company. This sense of trust leads to increased customer loyalty which gives the company a source of recurring business. When a person is presented with a choice of different restaurants to eat at, it is much easier for them to stick with what they know, rather than to take a gamble and dive into the unknown.\nDue to the importance of consistency, most companies set standards unifying their various restaurant locations with a set of common rules and regulations. Parent companies often rely on field representatives to ensure that the practices of franchised locations are consistent with the company's standards. However, the more locations a fast-food chain has, the harder it is for the parent company to guarantee that these standards are being followed. Moreover, it is much more expensive to discharge a franchisee for noncompliance with company standards, than it is to discharge an employee for that same reason. As a consequence, parent companies tend to deal with franchisee violations in a more relaxed manner.\nMany companies also adapt to their different local areas to support the needs of the customers. Sometimes it is necessary for a franchisee to modify the way the restaurant/store runs to meet the needs of local customers. As referenced in Bodey's \"Localization and Customer Retention for Franchise Service Systems\" article, J. L. Bradach claims that a franchise will either use the tactical or strategic local response. Tactical applies to accounting for hiring of personnel and suppliers as well as financial decisions to adapt to the local customers. Strategic applies to the specific characteristics of the franchise that will change from the basic format followed by all to fit in the local area.\nFor the most part, someone visiting a McDonald's in the United States will have the same experience as someone visiting a McDonald's in Japan. The interior design, the menu, the speed of service, and the taste of the food will all be very similar. However, some differences do exist to tailor to particular cultural differences. For example, in October 2005 during a midst of plummeting sales in Japan, McDonald's added a shrimp burger to the Japanese menu. The choice to introduce a shrimp burger was no coincidence, as a 1989 study stated that world consumption of shrimp was \"led by Japan.\"\nIn March 2010, Taco Bell opened their first restaurant in India. Because non-consumption of beef is a cultural norm in light of India's Dharmic beliefs, Taco Bell had to tailor its menu to the dietary distinctions of Indian culture by replacing all of the beef with chicken. By the same token, completely meatless options were introduced to the menu due to the prevalence of vegetarianism throughout the country.\nCountries.\nMultinational corporations typically modify their menus to cater to local tastes, and most overseas outlets are owned by native franchisees. McDonald's in India, for example, uses chicken and paneer rather than beef and pork in their burgers because Hinduism traditionally forbids eating beef. In Israel some McDonald's restaurants are kosher and respect the Jewish Shabbat; there is also a kosher McDonald's in Argentina. In Egypt, Indonesia, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Pakistan, and Singapore, all menu items are halal.\nNorth America.\nMany fast-food operations have more local and regional roots, such as White Castle in the Midwest United States, along with Hardee's (owned by CKE Restaurants, which also owns Carl's Jr., whose locations are primarily on the United States West Coast); Krystal, Bojangles' Famous Chicken 'n Biscuits, Cook Out, and Zaxby's restaurants in the American Southeast; Raising Cane's in Louisiana and other mostly Southern states; Hot 'n Now in Michigan and Wisconsin; In-N-Out Burger (in California, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, and Texas, with a few locations in Oregon) and Original Tommy's chains in Southern California; Dick's Drive-In in Seattle, Washington and Arctic Circle in Utah and other western states; Halo Burger around Flint, Michigan and Burgerville in the Portland, Oregon area. Also, Whataburger is a popular burger chain in the American South, and Jack in the Box is located in the West and South. Canada pizza chains Topper's Pizza and Pizza Pizza are primarily located in Ontario. Coffee chain Country Style operates only in Ontario, and competes with the famous coffee and donut chain Tim Hortons. Maid-Rite restaurant is one of the oldest chain fast-food restaurants in the United States. Founded in 1926, their specialty is a loose meat hamburger. Maid-Rites can be found in the midwest - mainly Iowa, Minnesota, Illinois, and Missouri.\nInternational brands dominant in North America include McDonald's, Burger King and Wendy's, the number three burger chain in the USA; Dunkin' Donuts, a New England\u2013based chain; automobile oriented Sonic Drive-In's from Oklahoma City; Starbucks, Seattle-born coffee-based fast-food beverage corporation; KFC and Taco Bell, which are both part of the largest restaurant conglomerate in the world, Yum! Brands; and Domino's Pizza, a pizza chain known for popularizing home delivery of fast food.\nSubway is known for their sub sandwiches and are the largest restaurant chain to serve such food items. Quiznos, a Denver-based sub shop, is another fast-growing sub chain, yet with over 6,000 locations it is still far behind Subway's 34,000 locations. Other smaller sub shops include Blimpie, Jersey Mike's Subs, Mr. Goodcents, Jimmy John's, Potbelly Sandwich Shop, Penn Station, and Firehouse.\nA&amp;W Restaurants was originally a United States and Canada fast-food brand, but it is currently an International fast-food corporation in several countries.\nIn Canada the majority of fast-food chains are American owned or were originally American owned but have since set up a Canadian management/headquarters locations such as Panera Bread, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Five Guys, and Carl's Jr. Although the case is usually American fast-food chains expanding into Canada, Canadian chains such as Tim Hortons have expanded into 22 states in the United States, but are more prominent in border states such as New York and Michigan. Tim Hortons has started to expand to other countries outside of North America. The Pita Pit franchise originated in Canada and has expanded to the United States and other Countries. The Canadian Extreme Pita franchise sells low fat and salt pita sandwiches with stores in the larger Canadian cities. Other Canadian fast-food chains such as Manchu Wok serve North American style Asian foods; this company is located mainly in Canada and the US, with other outlets on US military bases on other continents. Harvey's is a Canadian-only burger restaurant chain, present in every province.\nOceania.\nAustralia.\nAustralia's fast-food market began in the late 1960s and early 1970s, with the opening of several American franchises including KFC (1967),Pizza Hut (1970), and McDonald's (1971), followed by Burger King. However, the Burger King market found that this name was already a registered trademark to a takeaway food shop in Adelaide. Thus, the Burger King Australian market was forced to pick another name, selecting the Hungry Jack's brand name. Prior to this, the Australian fast-food market consisted primarily of privately owned take-away shops.\nNew Zealand.\nIn New Zealand, the fast-food market began in the 1970s with KFC (opened 1971), Pizza Hut (1974), and McDonald's (1976), and all three remain popular today. Burger King and Domino's entered the market later in the 1990s. Australian pizza chains Eagle Boys and Pizza Haven also entered the market in the 1990s, but their New Zealand operations were later sold to Pizza Hut and Domino's.\nA few fast-food chains have been founded in New Zealand, including Burger Fuel (founded 1995), Georgie Pie (founded 1977, but closed 1998 after falling into financial trouble and being bought out by McDonald's) and Hell Pizza (founded 1996).\nEurope.\nUnited Kingdom.\nThe United Kingdom's signature type of fast-food restaurant is a fish and chip shop, which specializes in fish and chips and also other foods such as kebabs and burgers. Fish and chip shops are usually owned independently.\nBurger brands like Wimpy remain, although the majority of branches became Burger King in 1989.\nNetherlands.\nIn the Netherlands, walk-up fast-food restaurants with \"automatiek\", a typical Dutch vending machine, are found throughout the country, most notably in Amsterdam. In this automatic format, a counter is available for purchasing French fries, beverages, krokets, frikandellen, kaassouffl\u00e9s and hamburgers and other snacks can be bought from the automats. FEBO is one of the largest of such types of fast-food restaurants with automats.\nIreland.\nIn addition to home-grown chains such as Supermac's, numerous American chains such as McDonald's and Burger King have also established a presence in Ireland. In 2015, a study developed by Treated.com was published in \"The Irish Times\", which named Swords, County Dublin as Ireland's 'fast-food capital'.\nCzech Republic.\nBageterie Boulevard is a Czech fast food chain, headquartered in Prague, which began in 2003 with the opening of its first location in the Dejvice district. Today, the brand operates numerous restaurants in both the Czech Republic and Slovakia.\nAsia.\nHong Kong.\nIn Hong Kong, although McDonald's and KFC are quite popular, three major local fast-food chains provide Hong Kong-style fast food, namely Caf\u00e9 de Coral, Fairwood, and Maxim MX. Caf\u00e9 de Coral alone serves more than 300,000 customers daily. Unlike western fast-food chains, these restaurants offer four different menus at different times of the day, namely breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea, and dinner. \"Siu mei\" is offered throughout the day.\n\"Dai pai dong\" and traditional Hong Kong street food may be considered close relatives of the conventional fast-food outlet.\nIndia.\nThe major fast-food chains in India that serve American fast food are KFC, McDonald's, Starbucks, Burger King, Subway, Pizza Hut, and Dominos. Most of these have had to make a lot of changes to their standard menus to cater to Indian food habits and taste preferences. Some emerging Indian food chains include Wow! Momo, Haldiram's, Faaso's and Caf\u00e9 Coffee Day.\nFood habits vary widely across states within India. While typical idli and dosa is fast food in Southern India, in Maharashtra it is misal-pav, pav-bhaji, and poha. Further north in Punjab and Haryana, chole-bhature are very popular and in Bihar and Jharkhand litti-chokha is their staple fast food.\nIndonesia.\nFast food in Indonesia is led by both American and local chains, many of which adapt their menus to local tastes and provide halal options. A 2024 survey showed KFC, McDonald's, and HokBen as the most popular brands, with Burger King, A&amp;W and Richeese Factory also among the top six.\nIsrael.\nIn Israel, local burger chain Burger Ranch is popular as are McDonald's and Burger King. Domino's Pizza is also a popular fast-food restaurant. Chains like McDonald's offer kosher branches. Intrinsically non-kosher foods such as cheeseburgers are rare in Israeli fast-food chains, even in non-kosher branches. There are many small local fast-food chains that serve pizza, hamburgers, sushi and local foods such as hummus, falafel and shawarma.\nJapan.\nAmerican chains such as Domino's Pizza, McDonald's, Pizza Hut, and KFC have a big presence in Japan, but local gyudon chains such as Sukiya, Matsuya and Yoshinoya also blanket the country. Japan has its own burger chains including MOS Burger, Lotteria and Freshness Burger.\nPakistan.\nFast food In Pakistan varies. There are many international chains serving fast food, including Nandos, Burger King, KFC, McDonald's, Domino's Pizza, Fatburger, Dunkin' Donuts, Subway, Pizza Hut, Hardee's, Telepizza, Steak Escape and Gloria Jean's Coffees. In addition to the international chains, in local cuisine people in Pakistan like to have biryani, bun kebabs, Nihari, kebab rolls etc. as fast food.\nPhilippines.\nIn the Philippines, fast-food is the same as in the US. However, the only difference is that they serve Filipino dishes and a few American products being served Filipino-style. Jollibee is the leading fast-food chain in the country with 1,000 stores nationwide.\nRussia.\nMost international fast-food chains like Subway, McDonald's, Burger King etc. are represented in major Russian cities. There are also local chains like Teremok specializing in Russian cuisine or having elements of it added into their menu.\nSaudi Arabia.\nSaudi Arabia has many international fast-food chains including KFC, Burger King, McDonald's and many others. However, the most popular fast-food restaurant of Saudi Arabia is Albaik. Saudis regard Albaik as better than KFC.\nTaiwan.\nNotable Taiwanese fast-food restaurants include 85C Bakery Cafe, TKK Fried Chicken, and Bafang Dumpling.\nAfrica.\nNigeria.\nIn Nigeria, Mr. Bigg's, Chicken Republic, Tantalizers, and Tastee Fried Chicken are the predominant fast-food chains. KFC and Domino's Pizza have recently entered the country.\nSouth Africa.\nKFC is the most popular fast-food chain in South Africa according to a 2010 \"Sunday Times\" survey. Chicken Licken, Wimpy and Ocean Basket along with Nando's, Steers and Hungry Lion are examples of homegrown franchises that are highly popular within the country. McDonald's, Subway and Pizza Hut have a significant presence within South Africa.\nTrends.\nHealth concerns.\nSome of the large fast-food chains are beginning to incorporate healthier alternatives in their menu, e.g., white meat, snack wraps, salads, and fresh fruit. However, some people see these moves as a tokenistic and commercial measure, rather than an appropriate reaction to ethical concerns about the world ecology and people's health. McDonald's announced that in March 2006, the chain would include nutritional information on the packaging of all of its products.\nIn September and October 2000, during the Starlink corn recalls, up to $50 million worth of corn-based foods were recalled from restaurants as well as supermarkets. The products contained Starlink genetically modified corn that was not approved for human consumption. It was the first-ever recall of a genetically modified food. The environmental group Friends of the Earth that had first detected the contaminated shells was critical of the FDA for not doing its own job.\nFast food is commonly blamed for the obesity epidemic in the United States today. 60% of Americans today are either overweight or obese. With obesity especially being seen among children, places like McDonald's and other fast-food restaurants take the majority of the blame. 34% of children and adolescents consume fast food on any given day, while 80% of children claim that McDonald's is their favorite place to eat at. The number of children and adolescents as well as adults eating out every day is only seen to progress and rise. Research concludes that children and adolescents ranging from twelve to nineteen years old consume twice as many calories from fast-food restaurants than children ranging from two to eleven years old.\nThe FDA found that trans fats raises the amount of cholesterol in blood, which raises the chance of developing heart disease which is known as one of the leading causes of death in the U.S. In a recent study, it was found that 11 out of 25 restaurants failed after tests on the use of antibiotics as well. Antibiotic-resistant infections affect at least 2 million Americans each year, which will leave at least 23,000 of those people to die.\nConsumer appeal.\nFast-food outlets have become popular with consumers for several reasons. One is that through economies of scale in purchasing and producing food, these companies can deliver food to consumers at a very low cost. In addition, although some people dislike fast food for its predictability, it can be reassuring to a hungry person in a hurry or far from home. At the same time, standardized service processes ensure a consistent experience across locations, which is attractive to consumers.\nIn the post-World War II period in the United States, fast-food chains like McDonald's rapidly gained a reputation for their cleanliness, fast service, and a child-friendly atmosphere where families on the road could grab a quick meal. Prior to the rise of the fast-food chain restaurant, people generally had a choice between diners where the quality of the food was often questionable and service lacking, or high-end restaurants that were expensive and impractical for families with children. The modern, stream-lined convenience of the fast-food restaurant provided a new alternative and appealed to Americans' instinct for ideas and products associated with progress, technology, and innovation. Fast-food restaurants rapidly became the eatery \"everyone could agree on\", with many featuring child-size menu combos, play areas, and whimsical branding campaigns, like the iconic Ronald McDonald, designed to appeal to younger customers. Parents could have a few minutes of peace while children played or amused themselves with the toys included in their Happy Meal. There is a long history of fast-food advertising campaigns, many of which are directed at children.\nFast-food marketing largely focuses on children and teenagers. Popular methods of advertising include television, product placement in toys, games, educational materials, songs, and movies, character licensing and celebrity endorsements, and websites. Advertisements targeting children mainly focus on free toys, movie tie-ins and other giveaways. Fast-food restaurants use kid's meals with toys, kid friendly mascots, vibrant colors, and play areas to draw children toward their products. . Children's power over their parents' purchases is estimated to total $300 to $500 billion every year. Fast food has become a part of American culture as a reward for children. To deny a child \"desirable things\" such as the advertised fast-food restaurant can cause stigmatization of parents as the \"mean parent\" when it is common among other parents to comply with their child's desires.\nThe major focus on children by the fast-food industry has created controversy due to the rising issue of child obesity in America. As a result of this focus, in 2008 a coalition was created and run by the Council of Better Business Bureaus called Children's Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative(CFBAI), to stop ads aimed at children or to promote only what the council dubs \"better-for- you\" products in ads directed towards children. However, it was not until 2011 that Congress requested guidelines be put in place by the CFBAI, FDA, Agriculture Department, and Centers for Disease Control. There are two basic requirements identified in the guidelines for foods that are advertised for children: (1) The food has to include healthful ingredients; (2) The food can't contain unhealthful amounts of sugar, Saturated fat, Trans fat, and salt. The guidelines are voluntary but companies experience heavy pressure to comply. Once a company complies they have 5\u201310 years to comply with the guidelines. Many fast-food industries have started to comply with the guidelines. Although many companies have ways to go. In 2012 the fast-food industry spent $4.6 billion to advertise unhealthy products to children and teens according to a report by the Yale Rudd Center for Food Policy &amp; Obesity. There are points of progress that include healthier sides and beverages in most fast-food restaurant kids' meals. The guidelines are interested in a healthier lifestyle for children and the growing problem of American obesity.\nWhile it may not be so obvious today, fast food is on its way to healthier foods and menus. Some businesses have taken off and had success in this market with healthy foods and due to many health concerns and fast-food stereotypes, it is emerging as an expected thing. According to Jason Daley, healthful fast-food takeoff is explained by the fact that it has \"ceased to be a thing-now, it's simply expected.\"\nIn other parts of the world, American and American-style fast-food outlets have been popular for their quality, customer service, and novelty, even though they are often the targets of popular anger towards American foreign policy or globalization more generally. Many consumers nonetheless see them as symbols of the wealth, progress, and well-ordered openness of Western society and they therefore become trendy attractions in many cities around the world, particularly among younger people with more varied tastes. \nImpact of fast-food restaurant availability.\nOver time, fast-food restaurants have been growing rapidly, especially in urban neighborhoods. According to US research, low-income and predominantly African-American neighborhoods have greater exposure to fast-food outlets than higher income and predominantly white areas. This has put into question whether urbanized neighborhoods were targeted, which causes a more unhealthy group of people compared to people from a higher socioeconomic status. It has also been shown that there is a lower chance of finding a fast-food restaurant in a suburban neighborhood. In a study of selected US locations, Morland et al. (2002) found the number of fast-food restaurants and bars was inversely proportional to the wealth of the neighborhood, and that predominantly African-American residential areas were four times less likely to have a supermarket near them than predominantly white areas.\nHalal.\nThe introduction of the halal option by some fast-food companies saw the expansion of fast-food chains into Muslim majority countries has resulted in a rise of restaurant options in non-western nations and has also increased revenue for some western restaurant chains. Some outlets offering Halal options include KFC, Nando's, Pizza Express, and Subway. McDonald's carried out a trial but decided that the cost of operations would be too high. There have also been court cases involving start-up businesses during attempts to alter the halal-certified method by machine killing, which is against the beliefs of some Muslims. However, the trend towards halal has been unpopular in some communities which have at times resulted in internet petitions.\nCriticisms.\nThe fast-food industry is a popular target for critics, from anti-globalization activists like Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9 to vegetarian activist groups such as PETA as well as the workers themselves. A number of fast-food worker strikes occurred in the United States in the 2010s.\nIn his best-selling 2001 book \"Fast Food Nation\", investigative journalist Eric Schlosser leveled a broad, socioeconomic critique against the fast-food industry, documenting how fast food rose from small, family-run businesses (like the McDonald brothers' burger joint) into large, multinational corporate juggernauts whose economies of scale radically transformed agriculture, meat processing, and labor markets in the late twentieth century. Schlosser argues that while the innovations of the fast-food industry gave Americans more and cheaper dining options, it has come at the price of destroying the environment, economy, and small-town communities of rural America while shielding consumers from the real costs of their convenient meal, both in terms of health and the broader impact of large-scale food production and processing on workers, animals, and land.\nThe fast-food industry is popular in the United States, the source of most of its innovation, and many major international chains are based there. Seen as symbols of US dominance and perceived cultural imperialism, American fast-food franchises have often been the target of Anti-globalization protests and demonstrations against the US government. In 2005, for example, rioters in Karachi, Pakistan, who were initially angered because of the bombing of a Shiite mosque, destroyed a KFC restaurant.\nLegal issues.\nIn August 2002, a group of overweight children in New York City filed a class-action lawsuit against McDonald's Corporation seeking compensation for obesity-related health problems, improved nutritional labeling of McDonald's products, and funding for a program to educate consumers about the dangers of fast food. This provoked an intense, mostly negative response in the media with columnists calling this case a \"cartoon of a lawsuit\".\nThis kind of litigation raises the important question of who, if anyone, ought to be held accountable for the economic and public health consequences of obesity.\nIn 2003, McDonald's was sued in a New York court by a family who claimed that the restaurant chain was responsible for their teenage daughter's obesity and attendant health problems. By manipulating food's taste, sugar and fat content, and directing their advertising to children, the suit argued that the company purposely misleads the public about the nutritional value of its product. A judge dismissed the case, but the fast-food industry disliked the publicity of its practices, particularly the way it targets children in its advertising. Although further lawsuits have not materialized, the issue is kept alive in the media and political circles by those promoting the need for tort reform.\nIn response to this, the \"Cheeseburger Bill\" was passed by the US House of Representatives in 2004; it later stalled in the US Senate. The law was reintroduced in 2005, only to meet the same fate. This law was claimed to \"[ban] frivolous lawsuits against producers and sellers of food and non-alcoholic drinks arising from obesity claims.\"\nThe bill arose because of an increase in lawsuits against fast-food chains by people who claimed that eating their products \"made\" them obese, disassociating themselves from any of the blame.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Formerly a village in its own right, it lies to the southwest of the city and is bounded to the south by the White Cart Water. The area was part of Renfrewshire until 1926 when the villages of Cardonald, Crookston, Halfway and their surrounding farmland were annexed to Glasgow.\nToponymy.\nThis place-name was first recorded in 1413 as \"Cardownalde\" and means (\"the fort of Donald\"). \"Cair\" means 'a fort' or 'a fortified place', and \"Donald\" came from either the Gaelic male personal name \"D\u00f2mhnall\" or its Cumbric equivalent \"Dyfnwal\", both of which are usually anglicised as 'Donald' (three kings of Strathclyde were named Dyfnwal). The fortalice of Cardonald (known as the Place of Cardonald, Cardonald Castle, or Cardonald House) was first recorded in 1565, but the place-name suggests this later medieval structure was built on the site of an older fortification.\nHistory.\nIn 1413 the lands of Cardownalde in Renfrewshire were the property of Johannes Norwald (John Norwald), dominus (lord) of Cardownalde. His granddaughter and heiress, Marion Stewart (daughter of Isabella Norwald of Cardonald and Sir William Stewart of Castlemilk), married Allan Stewart, establishing the line of Stewarts of Cardonald. The Cardonald Stewarts were a junior branch of the House of Stewart. Allan Stewart of Cardonald, the first Stewart of Cardonald, was the younger son of John Stewart, 1st Earl of Lennox. The Cardonald Stewarts had their seat at the \"Place of Cardonald\" (also known as Cardonald Castle or Cardonald House), built in 1565. It was demolished and replaced by a farmhouse \u2013 Cardonald Place Farm \u2013 in 1848. A corn mill existed in Cardonald from around 1789 until it was demolished in 1958. The site of Cardonald Mill is now occupied by the houses on Lade Terrace.\nThe line of the Stewarts of Cardonald ended with Allan's great-grandson, James Stewart of Cardonald (1512\u20131584). He had served as a captain in the Scottish Guards of the Kings of France, and is buried in Paisley Abbey. As he had no issue, the lands of Cardonald passed to his sister's son, Walter Stewart, 1st Lord Blantyre. His family resided at the Place of Cardonald for generations, and retained lands in Cardonald until the 20th century. With the death of the 12th Lord Blantyre in 1900, his estates passed to his grandson, William Arthur Baird.\nThe transformation of Cardonald from a rural to an urban community was largely brought about by the coming of the railway and the tram in the 19th century. The first railway to reach Cardonald was the Glasgow, Paisley and Greenock Railway, with a station (then known as Moss Road station) opening on Berryknowes Road in 1843. However, due to poor traffic returns, this station was closed in 1845. In 1879, the present day Cardonald railway station opened on the same site. The siting of this station influenced the building of the terrace of houses at Hillington Park Circus and the large country houses of Dalveon and Turnberry on Berryknowes Road, along with the terraced houses in Kingsland and Queensland Drive. There was also the lodge house on Berryknowes road next to Dalveon house which was part of the estate (now Craigton cemetery) that contained Cruickston Hall (now the site of the new Lourdes Primary School) and Craigton House.\nWith the arrival of the electric tram in 1903, the growth of Cardonald began in earnest along the stretch of Paisley Road West between the villages of Cardonald and Halfway, with the building of Cardonald Police station (1905) and Nazareth House (1906). In 1926, Glasgow Corporation bought the Cardonald estates from William Arthur Baird. The final upsurge in house building in the area took place from 1931, when most of the existing farm land disappeared, with the building of the North Cardonald and South Cardonald houses by the \"Western Heritable Investment Company\" after 1935. North Cardonald was mostly made up of owner-occupied houses and council homes owned by Glasgow Corporation (the predecessor to Glasgow City Council), while South Cardonald was mostly composed of owner-occupied and privately rented cottage flats. The 1930s also saw the building of two cinemas in the area, The Westway (1934\u20131960) and the Aldwych/Vogue (1938\u20131964). The Westway later became the Flamingo ballroom, and was then a bingo hall until its demolition in 2003. The Vogue was demolished in 1964. Both have supermarkets in their place today.\nIn the 1950s, the Corporation erected the UK's first high-rise flats in the area. Although only 10 storeys high, the Moss Heights flats were the first of many high-rise blocks to be built in Glasgow. They were revolutionary in the fact that their heating system was supplied from a central coal-fired boiler house. They have been renovated and survive well into the 21st century, unlike other developments constructed in later decades.\nEducation.\nThe first school in the vicinity of Cardonald was established at Halfway in 1790, by a local blacksmith who taught the rudiments of reading, writing and arithmetic. In 1860, Cardonald School was established when a school building and teacher's house were built at the corner of Paisley Road West and Lammermoor Avenue. The two-roomed, single-storey school building was extended in 1899 with the addition of a second storey, and was further extended in 1911.\nCardonald School remained the only school in the area until the 1930s when Lourdes Primary School and Angus Oval Primary School were built. Cardonald School transferred to the new building (built on the site of the former Angus Oval Primary School) in 1965. NB Angus Oval had acted as an annexe for Cardonald Primary for some years - handling Primaries 1 and 2 until around 1963. The old Cardonald School building on Paisley Rd. West was used as a careers office and for a number of other uses, before being demolished in 2003.\nIn the heart of north Cardonald was Belses Primary school. Sited on Belses Drive at the junction of Kingsland Drive. This was an annexe for the larger Hillington Primary school.\nAfter this wooden school was demolished a new school was built on the existing playing field at Hallrule drive. The Roman Catholic Lourdes Secondary School was opened in 1956.\nCardonald College, one of Scotland's largest further education colleges, opened in 1972. It merged with Anniesland College and Langside College in August 2013 to form Glasgow Clyde College, and was renamed Cardonald Campus.\nReligion.\nThe oldest church in the area is Cardonald Parish Church (Church of Scotland), which was built at the corner of Paisley Road West and Cardonald Place Road on a plot of ground which was donated by Lord Blantyre. The red sandstone church, designed by Peter Macgregor Chalmers, was built 1887-1889 and was dedicated in February 1889. The west wing was added in 1899 and the east wing in 1925, while the church halls were built in 1940.\nHillington Park Parish Church (Church of Scotland) was originally called \u201cCardonald United Free Church\u201d, with the current church hall on Berryknowes Road being built as a parish church of the United Free Church of Scotland in 1908. The harled red sandstone church was built 1924-1925. With the union of the United Free Church and the Church of Scotland in 1929, the church was renamed as Hillington Park Parish Church.\nThe local Roman Catholic church, Our Lady of Lourdes, was designed by Stellmacs Ltd and built 1937-1939. This church, which opened in May 1939, replaced an earlier small chapel which had been built on the site in 1922. The local Catholic community had originally met in Maryland House and then from 1906 in the chapel of Nazareth House.\nThe Church of the Good Shepherd (Scottish Episcopal Church) on Hillington Road was designed by Noad &amp; Wallace and was built 1939-1940. Before this church was built, the congregation, which was formed in 1938, had met in a shop at 2222 Paisley Road West.\nAmenities.\nCardonald Bowling Club was established in 1914 and is a popular club within the area.\nTransport.\nThe district is served by Cardonald railway station on the Inverclyde Line and by Mosspark railway station on the Paisley Canal line, as well as numerous bus routes. There is also easy access to the Clyde Tunnel and the M8 motorway via Junction 25.\nThe number 9 and 9A buses (First Bus) and 38 (McGills) pass regularly along Paisley Road West. There are around ten buses per hour during peak times, and around four buses per hour early morning and in the evenings and on Sundays.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is an herbaceous perennial that grows annual pseudostems (false stems made of the rolled bases of leaves) about one metre tall, bearing narrow leaf blades. The inflorescences bear flowers having pale yellow petals with purple edges, and arise directly from the rhizome on separate shoots.\nGinger is in the family Zingiberaceae, which also includes turmeric (\"Curcuma longa\"), cardamom (\"Elettaria cardamomum\"), and galangal. Ginger originated in Maritime Southeast Asia and was likely domesticated first by the Austronesian peoples. It was transported with them throughout the Indo-Pacific during the Austronesian expansion (c.\u20095,000 BP), reaching as far as Hawaii. Ginger is one of the first spices to have been exported from Asia, arriving in Europe with the spice trade, and was used by ancient Greeks and Romans. The distantly related dicots in the genus \"Asarum\" are commonly called wild ginger because of their similar taste. \nGinger has been used in traditional medicine in China, India and Japan for centuries, and as a modern dietary supplement. Ginger may offer benefits over placebo for nausea and vomiting during pregnancy, but there is no good evidence that it helps with nausea during chemotherapy. It remains uncertain whether ginger is effective for treating any disease. In 2023, world production of ginger was 4.9\u00a0million tonnes, led by India with 45% of the total.\nEtymology.\nThe English origin of the word \"ginger\" is from the mid-14th century, from Old English , which derives in turn from the Medieval Latin , from the Greek from the Prakrit (Middle Indic) , and from the Sanskrit . The Sanskrit word is thought to come from an ancient Dravidian word that also produced the Tamil and Malayalam term (from , \"root\"); an alternative explanation is that the Sanskrit word comes from , meaning \"horn\", and , meaning \"body\" (describing the shape of its root), but that may be folk etymology. The word probably was readopted in Middle English from the Old French (modern French ).\nOrigin and distribution.\nGinger originated from Maritime Southeast Asia. It is a true cultigen and does not exist in its wild state. The most ancient evidence of its domestication is among the Austronesian peoples where it was among several species of ginger cultivated and exploited since ancient times. They cultivated other gingers including turmeric (\"Curcuma longa\"), white turmeric (\"Curcuma zedoaria\"), and bitter ginger (\"Zingiber zerumbet\"). The rhizomes and the leaves were used to flavour food or eaten directly. The leaves were also used to weave mats. Aside from these uses, ginger had religious significance among Austronesians, being used in rituals for healing and for asking protection from spirits. It was also used in the blessing of Austronesian ships.\nGinger was carried with them in their voyages as canoe plants during the Austronesian expansion, starting from around 5,000 BP. They introduced it to the Pacific Islands in prehistory, long before any contact with other civilizations. Reflexes of the Proto-Malayo-Polynesian word \"*\" are found in Austronesian languages all the way to Hawaii. They also presumably introduced it to India along with other Southeast Asian food plants and Austronesian sailing technologies, during early contact by Austronesian sailors with the Dravidian-speaking peoples of Sri Lanka and South India at around 3,500 BP. It was also carried by Austronesian voyagers into Madagascar and the Comoros in the 1st millennium CE.\nFrom India, it was carried by traders into the Middle East and the Mediterranean by around the 1st century CE. It was primarily grown in southern India and the Greater Sunda Islands during the spice trade, along with peppers, cloves, and numerous other spices.\nHistory.\nThe first written record of ginger comes from the \"Analects\", written by the Disciples of Confucius in China during the Warring States period (475\u2013221 BCE). In it, Confucius was said to eat ginger with every meal. In 406, the monk Faxian wrote that ginger was grown in pots and carried on Chinese ships to prevent scurvy. During the Song dynasty (960\u20131279), ginger was being imported into China from southern countries.\nGinger spice was introduced to the Mediterranean by the Arabs, and described by writers like Dioscorides (40\u201390) and Pliny the Elder (24\u201379). In 150, Ptolemy noted that ginger was produced in Ceylon (Sri Lanka). Ginger\u2014along with its relative, galangal\u2014was imported into the Roman Empire as part of very expensive herbal remedies that only the wealthy could afford, e.g. for the kidneys. A\u00ebtius of Amida describes both ginger and galangal as ingredients in his complex herbal prescriptions. Raw and preserved ginger were imported into Europe in increased quantity during the Middle Ages after European tastes shifted favorably towards its culinary properties; during this time, ginger was described in the official pharmacopeias of several countries. In 14th century England, a pound of ginger cost as much as a sheep.\nArchaeological evidence of ginger in northwest Europe comes from the wreck of the Danish-Norwegian flagship, \"Gribshunden\". The ship sank off the southern coast of Sweden in the summer of 1495 while conveying King Hans to a summit with the Swedish Council. Among the luxuries carried on the ship were ginger, cloves, saffron, and pepper.\nThe ginger plant was smuggled onto the Caribbean islands from Asia sometime in the 16th century, along with black pepper, cloves, and cinnamon, at the encouragement of the Spanish Crown, though only ginger thrived. It eventually displaced sugar to become the leading export crop on both Hispaniola and Puerto Rico by the end of the century, until the introduction of slave labour from Africa made sugar more economical to produce in the 17th century.\nHorticulture.\nGinger produces clusters of white and pink flower buds that bloom into yellow flowers. Because of its aesthetic appeal and the adaptation of the plant to warm climates, it is often used as landscaping around subtropical homes. It is a perennial reed-like plant with annual leafy stems, about a meter (3 to 4 feet) tall. Traditionally, the rhizome is gathered when the stalk withers; it is immediately scalded, or washed and scraped, to kill it and prevent sprouting. The fragrant perisperm of the Zingiberaceae is used as sweetmeats by Bantu, and also as a condiment and sialogogue.\nProduction.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Table alignment/tables.css\" /&gt;\nIn 2023, world production of raw ginger was 4.9\u00a0million tonnes, led by India with 45% of the total, and Nigeria and China as secondary producers.\nProduction in India.\nThough it is grown in many areas across the globe, ginger is \"among the earliest recorded spices to be cultivated and exported from southwest India\". India holds the seventh position in ginger export worldwide, however is the \"largest producer of ginger in the world\". Regions in southwest and Northeast India are most suitable for ginger production due to their warm and humid climate, average rainfall and land space.\nGinger has the ability to grow in a wide variety of land types and areas, however is best produced when grown in a warm, humid environment, at an elevation between , and in well-drained soils at least 30\u00a0cm deep. A period of low rainfall prior to growing and well-distributed rainfall during growing are also essential for the ginger to thrive well in the soil.\nGinger produced in India is most often farmed through homestead farming, with work adaptively shared by available family and community members.\nGinger farming.\nThe size of the ginger rhizome is essential to the production of ginger. The larger the rhizome piece, the faster ginger will be produced and therefore the faster it will be sold onto the market. Prior to planting the seed rhizomes, farmers are required to treat the seeds to prevent pests, and rhizome rot and other seed-borne diseases. Various ways Indian farmers do seed treatment include dipping the seeds in cow dung emulsion, smoking the seeds before storage, and hot water treatment.\nOnce the seeds are properly treated, the farmland in which they are to be planted must be thoroughly dug or ploughed by the farmer to break up the soil. After the soil is sufficiently ploughed (at least 3\u20135 times), water channels are made apart to irrigate the crop.\nThe next step is planting the rhizome seed. In India, planting the irrigated ginger crop is usually done in the months between March and June as those months account for the beginning of the monsoon, or rainy season. Once the planting stage is done, farmers go on to mulch the crop to conserve moisture and check weed growth, as well as check surface run-off to conserve soil. Mulching is done by applying mulch (green leaves for example) to the plant beds directly after planting and again 45 and 90 days into growth. After mulching comes hilling, which is the stirring and breaking up of soil to check weed growth, break the firmness of the soil from rain, and conserve soil moisture. Farmers must ensure that their ginger crops are receiving supplemental irrigation if rainfall is low in their region. In India, farmers must irrigate their ginger crops every two weeks at the least between September and November (when the monsoon is over) to ensure maximum yield and high quality product.\nThe final farming stage for ginger is the harvesting stage. When the rhizome is planted for products such as vegetable, soda, and candy, harvesting should be done between four and five months of planting, whereas when the rhizome is planted for products such as dried ginger or ginger oil, harvesting must be done eight to ten months after planting.\nDry ginger is one of the most popular forms of ginger in commerce. Ginger rhizomes for dry ginger are harvested at full maturity (8\u201310 months). After soaking them in water, the outer skin is scraped off with a bamboo splinter or wooden knife by hand as it is too delicate a process to be done by machinery. The whole dried rhizomes are ground in the consuming centres. Fresh ginger does not need further processing after harvest, and it is harvested much younger.\nTransportation and export of ginger.\nGinger is sent through various stages to be transported to its final destination either domestically or internationally. The journey begins when farmers sell a portion of their produce to village traders who collect produce right at the farm gate. Once the produce is collected, it is transported to the closest assembly market where it is then taken to main regional or district level marketing centres. Farmers with a large yield of produce will directly take their produce to local or regional markets. Once the produce has \"reached [the] regional level markets, they are cleaned, graded, and packed in sacks of about 60\u00a0kg\". They are then moved to terminal markets such as in New Delhi, Kochi, and Bombay.\nStates from which ginger is exported follow the marketing channels of vegetable marketing in India, and the steps are similar to those when transported domestically. However, instead of reaching a terminal market after the regional forwarding centres, the produce will reach an export market and then be sent off by vehicle, plane or boat to reach its final international destination, where it will arrive at a local retail market and finally reach the consumer once purchased.\nDry ginger is most popularly traded between Asian countries through a unique distribution system involving a network of small retail outlets. Fresh and preserved ginger are often sold directly to supermarket chains, and in some countries fresh ginger is seen exclusively in small shops unique to certain ethnic communities. India frequently exports its ginger and other vegetable produce to nearby Pakistan and Bangladesh, as well as \"Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, the United States, Yemen Republic, the United Kingdom, and Netherlands\".\nThough India is the largest ginger producer in the world, it fails to play the role of a large exporter and only accounts for about 1.17% of total ginger exports. Ginger farming in India is a costly and risky business, as farmers do not gain much money from exports and \"more than 65% of the total cost incurred is toward labor and seed material purchase\". The farm owner may benefit given that there are no losses in production or price decreases, which is not easily avoidable. Production of dry ginger proves to have a higher benefit\u2013cost ratio, as well as ginger cultivated in intercropping systems rather than as a pure crop.\nUses.\nCulinary.\nGinger is a common spice used worldwide, whether for meals or as a folk medicine. Ginger can be used for a variety of food items such as vegetables, candy, soda, pickles, and alcoholic beverages.\nGinger is a fragrant kitchen spice. Young ginger rhizomes are juicy and fleshy with a mild taste. They are often pickled in vinegar or sherry as a snack or cooked as an ingredient in many dishes. They can be steeped in boiling water to make ginger herb tea, to which honey may be added. Ginger can be made into candy or ginger wine.\nAsia.\nMature ginger rhizomes are fibrous and nearly dry. The juice from ginger roots is often used as a seasoning in Indian recipes and is a common ingredient of Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese, and many South Asian cuisines for flavoring dishes such as seafood, meat, and vegetarian dishes.\nIn Indian cuisine, ginger is a key ingredient, especially in thicker gravies, as well as in many other dishes, both vegetarian and meat-based. Ginger has a role in traditional Ayurvedic medicine. It is an ingredient in traditional Indian drinks, both cold and hot, including spiced \"masala chai\". Fresh ginger is one of the main spices used for making pulse and lentil curries and other vegetable preparations. Fresh ginger together with peeled garlic cloves is crushed or ground to form ginger garlic masala. Fresh, as well as dried, ginger is used to spice tea and coffee, especially in winter. In south India, \"sambharam\" is a summer yogurt drink made with ginger as a key ingredient, along with green chillies, salt and curry leaves. Ginger powder is used in food preparations intended primarily for pregnant or nursing women, the most popular one being \"katlu\", which is a mixture of gum resin, \"ghee\", nuts, and sugar. Ginger is also consumed in candied and pickled form. In Japan, ginger is pickled to make \"beni sh\u014dga\" and \"gari\" or grated and used raw on tofu or noodles. It is made into a candy called \"shoga no sato zuke\". In the traditional Korean \"kimchi\", ginger is either finely minced or just juiced to avoid the fibrous texture and added to the ingredients of the spicy paste just before the fermenting process.\nIn Myanmar, ginger is called \"gyin\". It is widely used in cooking and as a main ingredient in traditional medicines. It is consumed as a salad dish called \"gyin-thot\", which consists of shredded ginger preserved in oil, with a variety of nuts and seeds. In Thailand' where it is called \u0e02\u0e34\u0e07 \"khing\", it is used to make a ginger garlic paste in cooking. In Indonesia, a beverage called \"wedang jahe\" is made from ginger and palm sugar. Indonesians also use ground ginger root, called \"jahe\", as a common ingredient in local recipes. In Malaysia, ginger is called \"halia\" and used in many kinds of dishes, especially soups. Called \"luya\" in the Philippines, ginger is a common ingredient in local dishes and is brewed as a tea called \"salabat\". In Vietnam, the fresh leaves, finely chopped, can be added to shrimp-and-yam soup (\"canh khoai m\u1ee1\") as a top garnish and spice to add a much subtler flavor of ginger than the chopped root. In China, sliced or whole ginger root is often paired with savory dishes such as fish, and chopped ginger root is commonly paired with meat, when it is cooked. Candied ginger is sometimes a component of Chinese candy boxes, and a herbal tea can be prepared from ginger. Raw ginger juice can be used to set milk and make a dessert, ginger milk curd.\nNorth America.\nIn the Caribbean, ginger is a popular spice for cooking and for making drinks such as sorrel, a drink made during the Christmas season. Jamaicans make ginger beer both as a carbonated beverage and also fresh in their homes. Ginger tea is often made from fresh ginger, as well as the famous regional specialty Jamaican ginger cake.\nWestern countries.\nIn Western cuisine, ginger is traditionally used mainly in sweet foods such as ginger ale, gingerbread, ginger snaps, parkin, and speculaas. A ginger-flavored liqueur called Canton is produced in Jarnac, France. Ginger wine is a ginger-flavoured wine produced in the United Kingdom, traditionally sold in a green glass bottle. Ginger is also used as a spice added to hot coffee and tea. On the island of Corfu, Greece, a traditional drink called \u03c4\u03c3\u03b9\u03c4\u03c3\u03b9\u03bc\u03c0\u03cd\u03c1\u03b1 (\"tsitsibira\"), a type of ginger beer, is made. The people of Corfu and the rest of the Ionian islands adopted the drink from the British, during the period of the United States of the Ionian Islands.\nFresh ginger can be substituted for ground ginger at a ratio of six to one, although the flavours of fresh and dried ginger are somewhat different. Powdered dry ginger root is typically used as a flavouring for recipes such as gingerbread, cookies, crackers and cakes, ginger ale, and ginger beer. Candied or crystallized ginger, known in the UK as \"stem ginger\", is the root cooked in sugar until soft, and is a type of confectionery. Fresh ginger may be peeled before eating. For longer-term storage, the ginger can be placed in a plastic bag and refrigerated or frozen.\nMiddle East.\nGinger is used in Iranian cuisine. Ginger bread is a kind of cookie traditionally prepared in the city of Gorgan on the holiday of Nowruz (New Year's Day).\nSimilar ingredients.\nOther members of the family Zingiberaceae are used in similar ways. They include the \"myoga\" (\"Zingiber mioga\"), the several types of galangal, the fingerroot (\"Boesenbergia rotunda\"), and the bitter ginger (\"Zingiber zerumbet\").\nA dicotyledonous native species of eastern North America, \"Asarum canadense\", is also known as \"wild ginger\", and its root has similar aromatic properties, but it is not related to true ginger. The plant contains aristolochic acid, a carcinogenic compound. The United States Food and Drug Administration warns that consumption of aristolochic acid-containing products is associated with \"permanent kidney damage, sometimes resulting in kidney failure that has required kidney dialysis or kidney transplantation. In addition, some patients have developed certain types of cancers, most often occurring in the urinary tract.\"\nNutrition.\nRaw ginger is 79% water, 18% carbohydrates, 2% protein, and 1% fat (table). In a reference amount of , raw ginger supplies of food energy and moderate amounts of potassium (14% of the Daily Value, DV), magnesium (10% DV) and manganese (10% DV), but otherwise is low in micronutrient content (table).\nComposition and safety.\nIf consumed in reasonable quantities, ginger has few negative side effects, although large amounts may cause adverse events, such as gastrointestinal discomfort, and undesirable interactions with prescription drugs. It is on the FDA's \"generally recognized as safe\" list, though it does interact with some medications, including the anticoagulant drug warfarin and the cardiovascular drug nifedipine.\nChemistry.\nThe characteristic fragrance and flavor of ginger result from volatile oils that compose 1\u20133% of the weight of fresh ginger, primarily consisting of sesquiterpenes, such as beta-bisabolene and zingiberene, zingerone, shogaols, and gingerols with [6]-gingerol (1-[4'-hydroxy-3'-methoxyphenyl]-5-hydroxy-3-decanone) as the major pungent compound. Some 400 chemical compounds exist in raw ginger.\nZingerone is produced from gingerols during drying, having lower pungency and a spicy-sweet aroma. Shogaols are more pungent, and are formed from gingerols during heating, storage or via acidity. Numerous monoterpenes, amino acids, dietary fiber, protein, phytosterols, vitamins, and dietary minerals are other constituents. Fresh ginger also contains an enzyme zingibain which is a cysteine protease and has similar properties to rennet.\nResearch.\nEvidence that ginger use is associated with reduced nausea during pregnancy is of low quality. There is no good evidence ginger helps alleviate chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.\nThere is no clear evidence that taking ginger to treat nausea during pregnancy is safe. Ginger is not effective for treating dysmenorrhea. There is some evidence for it having an anti-inflammatory effect, but insufficient evidence for it affecting pain in osteoarthritis. There is no good evidence that ginger affects platelet aggregation and blood clotting.\nA 2018 review found evidence that ginger could decrease body weight in obese subjects and increase HDL-cholesterol.\nAdverse effects.\nAlthough generally recognized as safe, ginger can cause heartburn and other side effects, particularly if taken in powdered form. It may adversely affect individuals with gallstones, and may interfere with the effects of anticoagulants, such as warfarin or aspirin, and other prescription drugs.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Fumaroles are characteristic of the late stages of volcanic activity, but fumarole activity can also precede a volcanic eruption and has been used for eruption prediction. Most fumaroles die down within a few days or weeks of the end of an eruption, but a few are persistent, lasting for decades or longer. An area containing fumaroles is known as a fumarole field.\nThe predominant vapor emitted by fumaroles is steam, formed by the circulation of groundwater through heated rock. This is typically accompanied by volcanic gases given off by magma cooling deep below the surface. These volcanic gases include sulfur compounds, such as various sulfur oxides and hydrogen sulfide, and sometimes hydrogen chloride, hydrogen fluoride, and other gases. A fumarole that emits significant sulfur compounds is sometimes called a solfatara.\nFumarole activity can break down rock around the vent, while simultaneously depositing sulfur and other minerals. Valuable hydrothermal mineral deposits can form beneath fumaroles. However, active fumaroles can be a hazard due to their emission of hot, poisonous gases.\nDescription.\nA \"fumarole\" (or \"fumerole\"; from French \"fumerolle\", a domed structure with lateral openings, built over a kitchen to permit the escape of smoke) is an opening in a planet's crust which emits steam and gases, but no liquid or solid material. The temperature of the gases leaving the vent ranges from about . The steam forms when groundwater is superheated by hot rock, then flashes (boils due to depressurization) as it approaches the surface.\nIn addition to steam, gases released by fumaroles include carbon dioxide, sulfur oxides, hydrogen sulfide, hydrogen chloride, and hydrogen fluoride. These have their origin in magma cooling underground. Not all these gases are present in all fumaroles; for example, fumaroles of Kilauea in Hawaii, US, contain almost no hydrogen chloride or hydrogen fluoride. The gases may also include traces of carbonyl sulfide, carbon disulfide, hydrogen, methane, or carbon monoxide. A fumarole that emits sulfurous gases can be referred to as a \"solfatara\" (from old Italian \"solfo\", \"sulfur\"). Acid-sulfate hot springs can be formed by fumaroles when some of the steam condenses at the surface. Rising acidic vapors from below, such as CO2 and H2S, will then dissolve, creating steam-heated low-pH hot springs.\nFumaroles are normally associated with the late stages of volcanic activity, although they may also precede volcanic activity and have been used to predict volcanic eruptions. In particular, changes in the composition and temperature of fumarole gases may point to an imminent eruption. An increase in sulfur oxide emissions is a particularly robust indication that new magma is rising from the depths, and may be detectable months to years before the eruption. Continued sulfur oxide emissions after an eruption is an indication that magma is continuing to rise towards the surface.\nFumaroles may occur along tiny cracks, along long fissures, or in chaotic clusters or fields. They also occur on the surface of lava flows and pyroclastic flows. A \"fumarole field\" is an area of thermal springs and gas vents where shallow magma or hot igneous rocks release gases or interact with groundwater. When they occur in freezing environments, fumaroles may cause fumarolic ice towers.\nFumaroles may persist for decades or centuries if located above a persistent heat source; or they may disappear within weeks to months if they occur atop a fresh volcanic deposit that quickly cools. The Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes, for example, was formed during the 1912 eruption of Novarupta in Alaska. Initially, thousands of fumaroles occurred in the cooling ash from the eruption, but over time most of them have become extinct. Persistent fumaroles are found at Sulfur Bank on the northern edge of the Kilauea caldera, but most fumaroles in Hawaii last no more than a few months. There are still numerous active fumaroles at Yellowstone National Park, US, some 70,000 years after the most recent eruption.\nEconomic resources and hazards.\nThe acidic fumes from fumaroles can break down the rock around the vents, producing brightly colored \"alteration haloes\". At Sulphur Banks near Kilauea in Hawaii, mild alteration reduces the rock to gray to white opal and kaolinite with the original texture of the rock still discernible. Alteration begins along joints in the rock and works inwards until the entire joint block is altered. More extreme alteration (at lower pH) reduces the material to clay minerals and iron oxides to produce red to reddish-brown clay. The same process can produce valuable hydrothermal ore deposits at depth.\nFumaroles emitting sulfurous vapors form surface deposits of sulfur-rich minerals and of fumarole minerals. Sulfur crystals at Sulfur Banks near Kilauea can grow to in length, and considerable sulfur has been deposited at Sulfur Cone within Mauna Loa caldera. Places in which these deposits have been mined include:\nSulfur mining in Indonesia is sometimes done for low pay, by hand, without respirators or other protective equipment.\nIn April 2006 fumarole emissions killed three ski-patrol workers east of Chair 3 at Mammoth Mountain Ski Area in California. The workers were overpowered by an accumulation of toxic fumes (a \"mazuku\") in a crevasse they had fallen into.\nOccurrences.\nFumaroles are found around the world in areas of volcanic activity. A few notable examples include:\nOn Mars.\nThe formation known as Home Plate at Gusev Crater on Mars, which was examined by the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) \"Spirit\", is suspected to be the eroded remains of an ancient and extinct fumarole.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Commissioned by the conservative Belgian newspaper \"Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle\" for its children's supplement \"Le Petit Vingti\u00e8me\", it was serialised weekly from December 1932 to February 1934. The story tells of young Belgian reporter Tintin and his dog Snowy, who are travelling in Egypt when they discover a pharaoh's tomb with dead Egyptologists and boxes of cigars. Pursuing the mystery of the cigars, Tintin and Snowy travel across Southern Arabia and India, and reveal the secrets of an international drug smuggling enterprise.\nFollowing on from \"Tintin in America\", \"Cigars\" was a commercial success, and was published in book form by Casterman shortly after its conclusion. Herg\u00e9 continued \"The Adventures of Tintin\" with \"The Blue Lotus\", the plot of which followed on from \"Cigars\". The series itself became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comic tradition. In 1955, it was re-drawn and coloured by Herg\u00e9 and his assistants at Studios Herg\u00e9 to match his distinctive \"ligne-claire\" style. Critical analysis of the story has focused on its innovation, and the \"Adventure\" introduces the recurring characters of detectives Thomson and Thompson and villain Rastapopoulos. The comic was loosely adapted by Herg\u00e9 and Jacques Van Melkebeke for the 1941 play \"\"; a more faithful adaptation was later made for the 1991 Ellipse/Nelvana animated series \"The Adventures of Tintin\".\nSynopsis.\nHolidaying on a Mediterranean cruise ship, Tintin and his dog Snowy meet wealthy film producer Rastapopoulos and eccentric Egyptologist Sophocles Sarcophagus. When two policemen (Thomson and Thompson) accuse Tintin of opium smuggling, he escapes the ship and joins Sarcophagus on his search for the undiscovered tomb of the Pharaoh Kih-Oskh, near Cairo. Tintin discovers that the tomb is full of mummified bodies (previous Egyptologists who tried to find the tomb), and boxes of cigars labelled with the mysterious symbol of Kih-Oskh. Sarcophagus disappears inside the tomb and Tintin and Snowy fall unconscious after an unseen enemy gasses them. They are then taken aboard a ship inside wooden sarcophagi, captained by smuggler Allan, but to avoid the coastguard Allan orders the sarcophagi thrown overboard.\nTintin and Snowy are rescued by a gunrunner who sails them to Arabia. Travelling by land, Tintin meets Sheikh Patrash Pasha, a big fan of his, and encounters Rastapopoulos filming a movie. Escaping Thomson and Thompson again, who believe Tintin is part of the gunrunners, Tintin and Snowy travel through the desert, eventually reaching a city. The local army drafts Tintin and then arrests him as a spy, after he finds more cigars labelled with the symbol of Kih-Oskh. Thomson and Thompson rescue him from execution in order to arrest him. However, when the army storms their hideout, Tintin manages to elude the authorities and escapes Arabia boarding a plane.\nTintin runs out of fuel over India, crashing into the jungle. After saving a sick elephant, Tintin discovers Sarcophagus, who has become insane and thinks he is Pharoh Ramesses II. While seeking for help at a nearby village, Sarcophagus gets hypnotized by a fakir who commands him to kill Tintin. Tintin then interrogates the poet Zloty, who is visiting the village. He reveals that there is an international drug smuggling ring determined to kill Tintin. Before he can reveal who the boss is, he is injected with Rajaijah juice (\"the poison of madness\") by the fakir, believing that he is Napoleon. Meeting the Maharaja of Gaipajama, the two become friends, with the Maharaja revealing that his family has long been fighting a criminal opium-smuggling gang, and in the process his father and brother went mad. \nThe fakir appears and Tintin follows him, discovering the drug cartel's hideout. While holding a conference, all the members are dressed in purple-coloured Ku-Klux Klan robes. After successfully capturing all the members of the gang (except the fakir), the Thompsons arrive and explain to Tintin that the Cairo police managed to discover the hideout of the drug smugglers in Egypt. They also realise Tintin is innocent. The fakir escapes, and with the masked leader of the conspiracy, kidnaps the Maharaja's son. Tintin pursues them in a sports car, rescuing the boy and capturing the fakir, while the leader falls into a chasm, seemingly dying. Tintin returns to Gaipajama, where his return is celebrated. Unwrapping one of the cigars with the mysterious Kih-Oskh symbol, Tintin explains to the Maharaja how opium was smuggled across the world in the cigars.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nGeorges Remi\u2014best known under the pen name Herg\u00e9\u2014was employed as editor and illustrator of (\"\"The Little Twentieth\"), a children's supplement to (\"The Twentieth Century\"\"), a staunchly Roman Catholic, conservative Belgian newspaper based in Herg\u00e9's native Brussels which was run by the Abb\u00e9 Norbert Wallez. In 1929, Herg\u00e9 began \"The Adventures of Tintin\" comic for , revolving around the exploits of fictional Belgian reporter Tintin. Wallez ordered Herg\u00e9 to set his first adventure in the Soviet Union to act as anti-socialist propaganda for children (\"Tintin in the Land of the Soviets\"), to set his second adventure in the Belgian Congo to encourage colonial sentiment (\"Tintin in the Congo\"), and to set his third adventure in the United States to use the story as a denunciation of American capitalism (\"Tintin in America\").\nFor his fourth \"Adventure\", Herg\u00e9 was eager to write a mystery story. The 1930s saw mystery novels flourish across Western Europe with the success of authors like Agatha Christie and Ellery Queen. The decision to create a scenario around the tomb of Kih-Oskh was influenced by the 1922 discovery of Pharaoh Tutankhamun's tomb by Howard Carter and the surrounding tabloid claims regarding a Curse of the Pharaohs. Herg\u00e9 returned to this theme for \"The Seven Crystal Balls\" (1948). The name Kih-Oskh was an allusion to the kiosks where was sold. The Kih-Oskh symbol was described by Herg\u00e9 as a distortion of the Taoist symbol of the Taijitu, with biographer Beno\u00eet Peeters thinking that it foreshadowed the \"Yellow Mark\" that featured in the \"Blake and Mortimer\" comic \"The Yellow \"M\"\" (1952\u201354) authored by Herg\u00e9's later collaborator Edgar P. Jacobs. Herg\u00e9 was aided in the production of \"Cigars of the Pharaoh\" by his assistant Paul \"Jam\" Jamin, who was heavily influenced by British magazines \"The Humorist\" and \"Punch\".\nHerg\u00e9 took influence from the published works of French adventurer and gunrunner Henry de Monfreid, particularly his books \"Secrets of the Red Sea\" and \"The Hashish Cruise\". Having lived through the First World War, Herg\u00e9 disliked arms dealers, and used Monfreid as the basis for the gunrunner character in \"Cigars\".\nThe idea of mummified bodies being lined up along a wall was adopted from Pierre Beno\u00eet's 1919 book \"L'Atlantide\" (\"Atlantis\"), which had recently been made into a 1932 film by Georg Wilhelm Pabst. The wall paintings depicted on a cover of was based on a bas-relief of Hathor and Seti I housed in the Louvre, Paris, while the throne featured in Tintin's dream was adopted from that found in the tomb of Tutankhamun. The inclusion of the secret society operating the smuggling ring was influenced by right-wing conspiracy theories about Freemasonry, with Herg\u00e9 likely gaining information on the brotherhood from a 1932 article by Lucien Farnoux-Reynaud in the radical magazine \"Le Crapouillot\" (\"The Mortar Shell\").\nOriginal publication, 1932\u201334.\nOn 24 November 1932, \"Le Petit Vingti\u00e8me\" published a fictional interview between Jamin and Tintin in which the reporter announced that he would be travelling to China via Egypt, India, Ceylon, and Indochina. Later on 8 December, the story began serialisation in the supplement under the title of \"The Adventures of Tintin, Reporter, in the Orient\". As the story began in Egypt rather than China, Herg\u00e9 briefly renamed the story to \"The Cairo Affair\". The story was not following any plan or pre-written plot, with Herg\u00e9 as usual devising the story on a week-by-week basis.\nIn Autumn 1934, the adventure was published in a book. \"Cigars\" was the first of the \"Adventures\" published by Casterman, with whom Herg\u00e9 had signed a contract in late 1933, although much to his annoyance, they delayed publication until the autumn of 1934, after the culmination of the summer holidays. In 1936, they successfully requested that he produce several colour plates to be inserted into the reprint of the book.\n\"Cigars of the Pharaoh\" saw the introduction of several characters who would gain a recurring role in \"The Adventures of Tintin\". The most notable are the two detectives, who were initially called \"Agent X33 and Agent X33 \". In his 1941 Tintin play co-written with Jacques Van Melkebeke, \"\", Herg\u00e9 named them \"Durant and Durand\", although he later renamed them \"Dupont and Dupond\". The series' English-language translators, Michael Turner and Leslie Lonsdale-Cooper, renamed them \"Thomson and Thompson.\" They were based on a combination of the stereotypical Belgian policeman of the 1930s with Herg\u00e9's observations of his father and uncle, Alexis and L\u00e9on Remi, who were identical twins.\nThe series introduced Tintin's adversary Roberto Rastapopoulos in \"Cigars of the Pharaoh\", here depicted as a famous Hollywood film director. It is only in the successor volume, \"The Blue Lotus\", that he is also revealed as the head of an international criminal organisation. His name was developed by one of Herg\u00e9's friends; Herg\u00e9 thought it was hilarious and decided to use it. He devised Rastapopoulos as an Italian with a Greek surname, but the character fitted anti-Semitic stereotypes of Jews; Herg\u00e9 was adamant that the character was not Jewish. A fourth recurring character introduced in this story was the Portuguese merchant Oliveira da Figueira, who would reappear in both the subsequent \"Adventures\" set in the Middle East, \"Land of Black Gold\" (1950) and \"The Red Sea Sharks\" (1958). One of the core characters of the story was Sophocles Sarcophagus, an Egyptologist who is the stereotype of an eccentric professor. In this respect, he is a prototype for the character of Cuthbert Calculus, whom Herg\u00e9 would introduce later in \"Red Rackham's Treasure\" (1943).\nIt was during the serialisation of \"Cigars\" that Wallez was embroiled in a scandal after he was accused of defaming the Bureau of Public Works. The accusation resulted in a legal case being brought against the newspaper, and in response its owners demanded Wallez's resignation, which was tended in August 1933. Without Wallez, Herg\u00e9 became despondent, and in March 1934 he tried to resign, but was encouraged to stay after his workload was reduced and his monthly salary was increased from 2000 to 3000 francs. Jamin subsequently took over Herg\u00e9's responsibility for the day-to-day running of \"Le Petit Vingti\u00e8me\".\nSecond version, 1955.\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, when Herg\u00e9's popularity had increased, he and his team at Studios Herg\u00e9 redrew many of the original black-and-white Tintin adventures in colour using the (\"clear line\") drawing style he had developed so that they visually fitted in with the new Tintin stories being created. The Studios reformatted and coloured \"Cigars of the Pharaoh\" in 1955; it was the last of the early works to undergo this process.\nIn cutting down the length of the story, Herg\u00e9 removed various isolated scenes that added nothing to the development of the plot, such as those in which Tintin confronts a bat, a crocodile, and snakes. The Arabian city that Tintin and Snowy searched for in the story was no longer identified as Mecca, while the Maharajah's three advisers were removed. New elements were also inserted; Herg\u00e9 added a depiction of ancient Egyptian pyramids into the background. Herg\u00e9 also added the character of Allan, who had originally been introduced in the later, 1941 adventure \"The Crab with the Golden Claws\", and also appeared as Rastapopoulos' henchman in later albums. Herg\u00e9 inserted an allusion to his friend and collaborator Edgar P. Jacobs into the story by including a mummified professor named E.P. Jacobini in the Egyptian tomb.\nWhereas the original version had included Sheikh Patrash Pasha showing Tintin a copy of \"Tintin in America\", in the 1955 version this was changed to the earlier \"Tintin in the Congo\", and Herg\u00e9 would change it again in 1964 for subsequent printings, this time to \"Destination Moon\" (1953), an \"Adventure\" set chronologically after \"Cigars\". Beno\u00eet Peeters exclaimed that with this scene, the reader can imagine Tintin's surprise at encountering an adventure he had not yet had and which included the characters of Captain Haddock and Cuthbert Calculus whom he had not yet met. Another anachronism in this version appears only in the English version, when Snowy refers to Marlinspike Hall, the ancestral home of Captain Haddock, from the much later volumes of the series. Harry Thompson opined that the most important changes to the book were artistic, for in the late 1950s Herg\u00e9 was at the peak of his artistic ability.\nLater publications.\nCasterman republished the original black-and-white version in 1979 in a French-language collected volume with \"The Blue Lotus\" and \"The Broken Ear\", the second part of the collection. In 1983, they then published a facsimile version of the original.\nCritical analysis.\nJean-Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier considered \"Cigars of the Pharaoh\" to be graphically between \"Tintin in America\" and \"The Blue Lotus\", as Herg\u00e9 was expanding his \"visual vocabulary\" and making use of \"unforgettable moments\" such as the dream sequence in the tomb. Although recognising that Herg\u00e9 was still devising his plot on a week-by-week basis, they thought that the work was an improvement on his earlier stories because of the inclusion of \"mystery and fantasy\".\nAwarding it three stars out of five, they thought the book was a \"surreal thriller, drenched and atmospheric\". Believing that the work not only dealt with madness, but also was madness, they thought the book evoked \"a sense of dreamlike suspension of disbelief\". They also highlighted the inclusion of the Kih-Oskh symbol throughout the book, describing it as being akin to a recurring musical theme, stating that it added \"a note of pure oneirism\".\nHarry Thompson considered \"Cigars of the Pharaoh\" \"almost completely unrecognisable from its predecessors\", praising its \"inspired comic characters\" and \"observed character comedy\", which he thought escaped the sheer slapstick evident in the earlier \"Adventures\". He also praised the elements of mystery and suspense that Herg\u00e9 introduced, opining that it created \"a genuine sense of fear without recourse to a \"deus ex machina\"\". More critically, he thought that the plot's \"glaring flaw\" was the immediate transposition of events from Egypt to India, also believing that the inclusion of British colonialists as the antagonists made \"partial amends\" for the colonialist attitude displayed by Tintin in \"Tintin in the Congo\". Michael Farr thought that Tintin was \"a maturer hero\" in \"Cigars\", being more of a detective than a reporter. He thought that the dream sequence was \"one of the most imaginative and disturbing scenes\" in the series, illustrating Herg\u00e9's \"growing virtuosity with the medium\". He also praised the scenes set in the Indian colonial bungalow, commenting that it was \"claustrophobic and sinisterly dramatic\" and worthy of the work of Agatha Christie, opining that the car chase provided \"a highly cinematic ending\". Overall, he thought it to be a narrative \"rich in mystery and drama\" which was as much of a landmark in the series as \"The Blue Lotus\".\nHerg\u00e9 biographer Beno\u00eet Peeters thought that with \"Cigars\", Herg\u00e9 was engaging in the \"novelesque\", and that the opening scene had echoes of Rodolphe T\u00f6pffer's \"Mr Pencil\". He also thought it the first of the \"Adventures\" to have a \"semblance\" of \"narrative unity\". Fellow biographer Pierre Assouline thought that the story was difficult for the reader to follow, because the exoticism of the backdrop faded amid the fast pace of the narrative.\nLiterary critic Tom McCarthy highlighted the prominent role of tobacco in the story, drawing on the ideas of French philosopher Jacques Derrida to suggest the potential symbolism of this. He also suggested that the inclusion of mummified Egyptologists in the story warns readers of the \"dangers of mummification through interpretation\".\nAdaptations.\n\"Cigars of the Pharaoh\" was adapted into a 1991 episode of \"The Adventures of Tintin\" television series by French studio Ellipse and Canadian animation company Nelvana. Directed by St\u00e9phane Bernasconi, Thierry Wermuth voiced the character of Tintin. In 2010, the television channel Arte filmed an episode of its documentary series, \"Sur les traces de Tintin\" (\"On the track of Tintin\"), in Egypt exploring the inspiration and setting of the \"Cigars of the Pharaoh\".\nIn August 2022, it was announced that Pendulo Studios and Microids would be creating an adventure video game adaptation titled \"Tintin Reporter \u2013 Cigars of the Pharaoh\". Footage of the game was revealed in March 2023. It was released on November 7, 2023 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and Nintendo Switch. It received mixed reviews at launch due to numerous bugs and technical issues that players encountered.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Commissioned by the conservative Belgian newspaper for its children's supplement , it was serialised weekly from August 1938 to August 1939. Herg\u00e9 intended the story as a satirical criticism of the expansionist policies of Nazi Germany, in particular the annexation of Austria in March 1938 (the \"Anschluss\"). The story tells of young Belgian reporter Tintin and his dog Snowy, who travel to the fictional Balkan nation of Syldavia, where they combat a plot to overthrow the monarchy of King Muskar XII.\n\"King Ottokar's Sceptre\" was a commercial success and was published in book form by Casterman shortly after its conclusion. Herg\u00e9 continued \"The Adventures of Tintin\" with \"Land of Black Gold\" until 's forced closure in 1940, while the series itself became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. In 1947, Herg\u00e9 coloured and redrew \"King Ottokar's Sceptre\" in his distinctive style with the aid of Edgar P. Jacobs for Casterman's republication. The story introduces the recurring character Bianca Castafiore, and introduced the fictional countries of Syldavia and Borduria, both of which reappear in later stories. The first volume of the series to be translated into English, \"King Ottokar's Sceptre\" was adapted for both the 1956 Belvision Studios animation \"Herg\u00e9's Adventures of Tintin\" and for the 1991 Ellipse/Nelvana animated series \"The Adventures of Tintin\".\nSynopsis.\nHaving discovered a lost briefcase in a Belgian park, Tintin returns it to its owner, the sigillographer Professor Hector Alembick, who informs the reporter of his plans to travel to the Balkan nation of Syldavia. Tintin discovers agents spying on the professor and follows those responsible to a nearby Syldavian restaurant. An unknown man agrees to meet with Tintin but is found unconscious and appears to have amnesia. Shortly after, the reporter receives a threatening note and is then the target of a bomb attack; Tintin survives the latter when police detectives Thomson and Thompson intercept the bomb. Suspecting that these events are linked to Syldavia, Tintin decides to accompany Professor Alembick on his forthcoming visit to the country. On the plane journey there, Tintin notices Alembick acting out of character, and suspects that an imposter has replaced him. Reading a brochure on Syldavian history, Tintin theorises that the imposter is part of a plot to steal the sceptre of the medieval King Ottokar IV from the current King Muskar XII before St. Vladimir's Day, thus forcing him to abdicate.\nForcibly ejected from the plane by the pilot, Tintin survives and informs local police of his fears regarding the plot. However, the police captain is part of the conspiracy, and he organises an ambush in the woods where Tintin will be eliminated. Tintin evades death, and heads to the capital city of Klow in a car carrying the opera singer Bianca Castafiore. Leaving the car to evade Castafiore's singing, Tintin is arrested and survives another assassination attempt before heading to Klow on foot. Arriving in the city, he meets the King's \"aide-de-camp\", Colonel Boris Jorgen, seeking permission to meet the King. At the Klow Natural History Museum, Snowy has taken a bone away from one of the dinosaurs but Tintin orders Snowy to return it back to the museum. However, Jorgen is also a conspirator and organises a further unsuccessful assassination attempt aimed at Tintin. While Bianca Castafiore is singing at a gala opera, Tintin gatecrashes and he is escorted away by a group of security guards. En route to transferring Tintin to prison, the custody van has an accident trying to avoid a careless pedestrian and Tintin suffers a concussion. Meanwhile, the imposter pretending to be Alembick is allowed into Kropow Castle, where the sceptre is kept. Tintin finally succeeds in personally warning the King about the plot and they both rush to Kropow Castle, only to find that the sceptre is missing. \nWith the aid of Thomson and Thompson, who have recently arrived in Syldavia, Tintin discovers how the conspirators smuggled out the sceptre from the Castle and pursues the thieves, first by car and then on foot across the mountains. He is able to prevent the sceptre being carried over the border into neighbouring Borduria, discovering a letter on one of the conspirators. It reveals that the plot has been orchestrated by M\u00fcsstler, a political agitator who runs both the Syldavian Iron Guard and the Zyldav Zentral Revolutzion\u00e4r Komitz\u00e4t (ZZRK), a subversive organization which intends to have Borduria invade and annex Syldavia. Entering Borduria, Tintin commandeers a fighter plane and heads to Klow, but the Syldavian military shoot him down. Parachuting, he continues to Klow by foot, returning the sceptre to the King on St. Vladimir's Day and securing the monarchy. In return, the king makes Tintin a Knight of the Order of the Golden Pelican; the first foreigner to receive the honour. Tintin later learns that the imposter was Alembick's twin brother after police arrest M\u00fcsstler and rescue Professor Alembick. Afterwards, Tintin and the Thompsons take a flying boat home.\nHistory.\nBackground.\n\"King Ottokar's Sceptre\" was not the first Tintin adventure to draw specifically on contemporary events; Herg\u00e9 had for instance previously made use of the 1931 Japanese invasion of Manchuria as a political backdrop for the setting in \"The Blue Lotus\". This time, Herg\u00e9 had closely observed the unfolding events surrounding the expansionist policies of Nazi Germany. In producing this story, he was particularly influenced by the \"Anschluss\", the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany in March 1938. The Munich Agreement and the subsequent Nazi invasion of the Sudetenland followed in October 1938. Three weeks after \"King Ottokar's Sceptre\" finished serialisation, Germany invaded Poland. By this point, the threat to Belgian sovereignty posed by Nazi expansionism was becoming increasingly clear. By 1939, the events surrounding the Italian annexation of Albania made Herg\u00e9 insist his editor publish the work to take advantage of current events as he felt \"Syldavia is Albania\". Later Herg\u00e9 denied that he had just one country in mind.\nHerg\u00e9 claimed that the basic idea behind the story had been given to him by a friend; biographer Beno\u00eet Peeters suggested that the most likely candidate was school and scouting friend Philippe G\u00e9rard, who had warned of a second war with Germany for years. \"Tintin\" scholars have claimed Herg\u00e9 did not develop the names \"Syldavia\" and \"Borduria\" himself; instead, the country names had supposedly appeared in a paper included in a 1937 edition of the \"British Journal of Psychology\", in which the author described a hypothetical conflict between a small kingdom and an annexing power. Reportedly, the paper, by Lewis Fry Richardson and entitled \"General Foreign Policy\", explored the nature of inter-state conflict in a mathematical way. Peeters attributed these claims to Georges Laurenceau, but said that \"no researcher has confirmed this source\". Instead, a paper by Richardson entitled \"Generalized Foreign Politics: A Story in Group Psychology\" was published in \"The British Journal of Psychology Monograph Supplements\" in 1939, but did not mention \"Syldavia\" or \"Borduria\". In any case, given the publication date, it is unlikely that it was an influence on \"King Ottokar's Sceptre\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"At the time, Germany was of course on my mind; \"Ottokar's Sceptre\" is nothing other than the tale of a failed Anschluss. But one can take it to be any other totalitarian regime\u00a0... Moreover, isn't the villain of \"Ottokar's Sceptre\" called M\u00fcsstler, evidently a combination of Mussolini and Hitler? It strikes me as a clear allusion\".\nHerg\u00e9, talking to Numa Sadoul \nHerg\u00e9 designed Borduria as a satirical depiction of Nazi Germany.\nHerg\u00e9 named the pro-Bordurian agitator \"M\u00fcsstler\" from the surnames of Nazi leader Adolf Hitler and Italy's National Fascist leader Benito Mussolini. The name also had similarities with the British Union of Fascists' leader Oswald Mosley and the National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands' leader Anton Mussert. M\u00fcsstler's group was named after the Iron Guard, a Romanian fascist group that sought to oust King Carol II and forge a Romanian-German alliance. The Bordurian officers wore uniforms based on those of the German SS, while the Bordurian planes are German in design; in the original version Tintin escapes in a Heinkel He 112, while in the revised version this is replaced by a Messerschmitt Bf 109. Herg\u00e9 adopted the basis of Borduria's false flag operation to take over Syldavia from the plans outlined in Curzio Malaparte's \"\".\nSyldavia's depiction was influenced by the costumes and cultures of Romania and the neighboring Balkan region. The mosques that appear in Herg\u00e9's Syldavia are based on those found throughout the Balkans, while the appearance of the Syldavian village, featuring red-tiled roofs and minarets, may have been specifically inspired by the Bosnian town of Mostar. Syldavia's mineral rich subsoil could be taken as a reference to the uranium deposits found under Romania's Carpathian Mountains \u2013 later to be mentioned directly in the eventual \"Destination Moon\". \"Tintin\" scholars have noted that the black pelican of Syldavia's flag resembles the black eagle of Albania's flag, and that Romania is the only European country to which pelicans are native.\nThe name Syldavia may be a composite of Transylvania and Moldavia, two regions with historical ties to Romania. Czech, Slovak, and Bohemian history influenced the Syldavian names, while several medieval Bohemian kings were the inspiration for the name \"Ottokar\". The Polish language influenced Herg\u00e9's inclusion of \"\u2013ow\" endings to the names of Syldavian places, while Polish history parallels Herg\u00e9's description of Syldavian history. The Syldavian language used in the book had French syntax but with Marollien vocabulary, a joke understood by the original Brussels-based readership.\nHowever, despite its Eastern European location, Syldavia itself was partly a metaphor for Belgium \u2013 Syldavian King Muskar XII physically resembles King Leopold III of Belgium. Herg\u00e9's decision to create a fictional Eastern European kingdom might have been influenced by Ruritania, the fictional country created by Anthony Hope for his novel \"The Prisoner of Zenda\" (1894), which subsequently appeared in film adaptations in 1913, 1915, 1922, and 1937. Many places within Syldavia are visually based on pre-existing European sites: the \"Diplodocus\" in the Klow Natural History Museum is based on the one in the Museum f\u00fcr Naturkunde, Berlin; the Syldavian Royal Palace is based on both the Charlottenburg Palace, Berlin and the Royal Palace of Brussels; and Kropow Castle is based on Olavinlinna Castle, constructed in fifteenth century Savonia \u2013 a historical province of the Swedish Kingdom, located in modern-day Finland. For the revised version, Kropow Castle was drawn with an additional tower, inspired by Vyborg Castle, Russia. The United Kingdom also bore at least one influence on Syldavia, as King Muskar XII's carriage is based on the British royal family's Gold State Coach.\nOriginal publication.\n\"King Ottokar's Sceptre\" was first serialised in \"Le Petit Vingti\u00e8me\" from 4 August 1938 to 10 August 1939 under the title \"Tintin En Syldavie\" (\"Tintin in Syldavia\"). It would prove to be the last Tintin adventure to be published in its entirety in \"Le Petit Vingti\u00e8me\". From 14 May 1939, the story was also serialised in the French Catholic newspaper, \"C\u0153urs Vaillants\".\nIn 1939, \u00c9ditions Casterman collected the story together in a single hardcover volume; Herg\u00e9 insisted to his contact at Casterman, Charles Lesne, that they hurry up the process due to the changing political situation in Europe. The Nazi\u2013Soviet Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact was signed the day Herg\u00e9 delivered the book's remaining drawings; finishing touches included the book's original front cover, the royal coat of arms for the title page, and the tapestry depicting the Syldavian's 1127 victory over the Turks in \"The Battle of Zileheroum\" on page 20. Herg\u00e9 suggested that for this publication, the story's title be changed to \"The Scepter of Ottokar IV\"; Casterman changed this to \"King Ottokar's Sceptre\".\n\"King Ottokar's Sceptre\" introduced the recurring character of Bianca Castafiore to the series, who appears alongside her pianist Igor Wagner. It also witnessed the introduction of antagonist Colonel Jorgen, who reappears in the later Tintin adventures \"Destination Moon\" and its sequel \"Explorers on the Moon\". The Alembick brothers' inclusion echoes the Balthazar brothers' inclusion in \"The Broken Ear\".\nAfter the conclusion of \"King Ottokar's Sceptre\", Herg\u00e9 continued \"The Adventures of Tintin\" with \"Land of Black Gold\" until Germany placed Belgium under occupation in 1940 and forced the closure of . The adventure \"Land of Black Gold\" had to be abandoned.\nSecond version, 1947.\nThe story was redrawn and colourised in 1947. For this edition, Herg\u00e9 was assisted by Edgar P. Jacobs. Jacobs oversaw changes to the costumes and background of the story; in the 1938 version, the Syldavian Royal Guards are dressed like British Beefeaters, while the 1947 version has them dressed in a Balkanised uniform similar to the National Guards Unit of Bulgaria. Jacobs also inserted a cameo of himself and his wife in the Syldavian royal court, while in that same scene is a cameo of Herg\u00e9, his then-wife Germaine, his brother Paul, and three of his friends \u2013 \u00c9douard Cnaepelinckx, Jacques Van Melkebeke, and Marcel Stobbaerts. Herg\u00e9 and Jacobs also inserted further cameos of themselves at the bottom of page 38, where they appear as uniformed officers. While the character of Professor Alembick had been given the forename of Nestor in the original version, this was changed to Hector for the second; this had been done so as to avoid confusion with the character of Nestor, the butler of Marlinspike Hall, whom Herg\u00e9 had introduced in \"The Secret of the Unicorn\". Editions Casterman published this second version in book form in 1947.\nSubsequent publications and legacy.\n\"King Ottokar's Sceptre\" became the first Tintin adventure to be published for a British audience when \"Eagle\" serialised the comic in 1951. Here, the names of Tintin and Milou were retained, although the characters of Dupond and Dupont were renamed Thomson and Thompson; the latter two names would be adopted by translators Leslie Lonsdale-Cooper and Michael Turner when they translated the series into English for Methuen Publishing in 1958.\nCasterman republished the original black-and-white version of the story in 1980, as part of the fourth volume in their collection. In 1988, they then published a facsimile version of that first edition.\nCritical analysis.\nHarry Thompson described \"King Ottokar's Sceptre\" as a \"biting political satire\" and asserted that it was \"courageous\" of Herg\u00e9 to have written it given that the threat of Nazi invasion was imminent. Describing it as a \"classic locked room mystery\", he praised its \"tightly constructed plot\". Ultimately, he deemed it one of the best three Tintin adventures written before World War II, alongside \"The Blue Lotus\" and \"The Black Island\". He also thought it noteworthy that in 1976, archaeologists discovered a sceptre belonging to a 13th-century King Ottokar in St. Vitus Cathedral, Prague. Herg\u00e9 biographer Pierre Assouline believed that the story had the atmosphere of Franz Leh\u00e1r's \"The Merry Widow\", with \"added touches\" from the films of Erich von Stroheim and Ernst Lubitsch. Fellow biographer Beno\u00eet Peeters thought that it exhibited \"a political maturity\" and \"originality\". Further, he felt that Herg\u00e9 was able to break free from the \"narrative limits [of]\u00a0... too much realism\" by the use of Syldavia as a setting.\nJean-Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier called \"King Ottokar's Sceptre\" \"a Hitchcockian thriller\" which \"recaptures the paranoid ambience\" of \"Cigars of the Pharaoh\". They compared the pace of the latter part of the story to that of Steven Spielberg's \"Indiana Jones\" films before noting that despite the \"horrors of the real world\" that are present with Borduria's inclusion, they do not interfere in \"the pure escapist nature of the adventure\". Ultimately they awarded it three stars out of five.\nMichael Farr opined that the adventure has \"a convincingly authentic feel\" due to the satirical portrayal to Nazi Germany, but that this was coupled with \"sufficient scope for invention\" with the creation of Syldavia. He compared it to Hitchcock's \"The Lady Vanishes\". Farr preferred the colour version assembled with E.P. Jacobs' aid, however. Deeming it \"particularly successful\", he thought that it was \"one of the most polished and accomplished\" adventures in the series, with a \"perfectly paced and balanced\" narrative that mixed drama and comedy successfully.\nLiterary critic Jean-Marie Apostolid\u00e8s of Stanford University asserted that the inclusion of the Iron Guard evoked Colonel Fran\u00e7ois de La Rocque's Croix-de-Feu. Noting that the figure of M\u00fcsstler was \"the Evil One without a face\", he expressed disbelief regarding Herg\u00e9's depiction of Syldavia, as there were no apparent economic problems or reasons why M\u00fcsstler's anti-monarchist conspiracy was so strong; thus, \"mass revolution remains schematic\".\nLiterary critic Tom McCarthy identified several instances in the story that he argued linked to wider themes within the \"Adventures of Tintin\". He identified a recurring host-and-guest theme in Alembick's visit to Syldavia, and believed that the theme of thieving was present in the story as Alembick's identity is stolen. Another theme identified within the series by McCarthy was that of the blurring between the sacred and the political; he saw echoes of this in \"King Ottokar's Sceptre\" as the King has to wait three days before appearing to the Syldavian public on St. Vladimir's Day, something that McCarthy thought linked to Jesus Christ and the Resurrection. McCarthy also opined that a number of characters in the book visually resembled Captain Haddock, a character who would be introduced in the subsequent Tintin adventure, \"The Crab with the Golden Claws\".\nAdaptations.\n\"King Ottokar's Sceptre\" was the first of \"The Adventures of Tintin\" to be adapted for the animated series \"Herg\u00e9's Adventures of Tintin\". The series was created by Belgium's Belvision Studios in 1957, directed by Ray Goossens and written by Greg. The studio divided \"King Ottokar's Sceptre\" into six 5-minute black-and-white episodes that diverged from Herg\u00e9's original plot in many ways. It was also adapted into a 1991 episode of \"The Adventures of Tintin\" television series by French studio Ellipse and Canadian animation company Nelvana. The episode was directed by St\u00e9phane Bernasconi, and Thierry Wermuth voiced the character of Tintin.\nTintin fans adopted the Syldavian language that appears in the story and used it to construct grammars and dictionaries, akin to the fan following of \"Star Trek\"'s Klingon and J. R. R. Tolkien's Elvish.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The story was initially serialised weekly in Belgium's \"Tintin\" magazine from October 1956 to January 1958 before being published in a collected volume by Casterman in 1958. The narrative follows the young reporter Tintin, his dog Snowy, and his friend Captain Haddock as they travel to the fictional Middle Eastern kingdom of Khemed with the intention of aiding the Emir Ben Kalish Ezab in regaining control after a \"coup d'\u00e9tat\" by his enemies, who are financed by slave traders led by Tintin's old nemesis Rastapopoulos.\nFollowing on from the previous volume in the series, \"The Calculus Affair\", \"The Red Sea Sharks\" was created with the aid of Herg\u00e9's team of artists at Studios Herg\u00e9. Influenced by Honor\u00e9 de Balzac's \"The Human Comedy\", Herg\u00e9 used the story as a vehicle in which to reintroduce a wide range of characters who had first appeared in earlier instalments of the series. The story dealt with the trade of enslaved Africans across the Arab world, specifically the Red Sea slave trade, which was ongoing at the time of its publication. However, in the 1960s the story generated controversy as Herg\u00e9 was repeatedly accused of having portrayed the Africans in a racist manner. He was upset by these claims, and made alterations to the depiction of the Africans in later reprints. Herg\u00e9 continued \"The Adventures of Tintin\" with \"Tintin in Tibet\", and the series as a whole became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. \"The Red Sea Sharks\" was critically well-received, with various commentators describing it as one of the best Tintin adventures. The story was adapted for both the 1991 Ellipse/Nelvana animated series \"The Adventures of Tintin\" and the 1992-3 BBC Radio 5 dramatisation of the \"Adventures\".\nSynopsis.\nIn Brussels, Tintin and Captain Haddock bump into an old acquaintance, General Alcazar. Returning to Marlinspike Hall, they find that another acquaintance, the Emir of Khemed, Mohammed Ben Kalish Ezab, has been overthrown by his nemesis Sheikh Bab El Ehr, and that the Emir has accordingly sent his son, the disobedient Abdullah, to stay at Marlinspike for his own protection. The police detectives Thomson and Thompson visit, informing Tintin that Alcazar is seeking to purchase military aircraft from J. M. Dawson. After further investigation, Tintin discovers that Dawson has also sold military aircraft to Bab El Ehr.\nRealising that the only way to be rid of Abdullah is to restore the Emir's control of Khemed, Tintin, Haddock, and their dog Snowy travel to the Middle Eastern country. However, the trio narrowly survive a bomb planted aboard the plane to kill them as a result of Dawson discovering that Tintin spied on him. Meanwhile, a fight breaks out between Haddock, the angry man and Tintin. The pilot had ordered to make an emergency crash landing. With the fire now extinguished and the evacuation of passengers from a burning plane, the trio are able to slip into the city of Wadeshah unobserved. There they meet an old friend, the Portuguese merchant Oliveira da Figueira, who helps them to escape the city and ride on horseback to the Emir's hideout. During the journey, they evade armoured cars and fighter planes ordered to intercept them by \"Mull Pasha\", who is actually Tintin's old nemesis, Dr. M\u00fcller.\nMeanwhile, back at Marlinspike Hall, Abdullah finds Nestor who is bound and gagged into a chair in a kitchen and Professor Calculus later turns up while roller-skating. Later, the Emir welcomes Tintin and Haddock. It then transpires, from the Emir's explanation, that there is an ongoing slave trade through Khemed that is operated by the international businessman called \"the Marquis di Gorgonzola\", who falsely offers transport to African Muslims on the pilgrimage to Mecca, but then sells them into slavery somewhere along the journey. Tintin, Haddock and Snowy leave for the Red Sea coast and board a sambuk for Mecca, but are attacked by fighter planes. Tintin shoots one down and rescues its mercenary Estonian pilot, Piotr Skut. The four are picked up by di Gorgonzola's yacht, the \"Scheherazade\", but are soon offloaded onto the SS \"Ramona\", a tramp steamer. Di Gorgonzola, it turns out, is another of Tintin's previous adversaries, Roberto Rastapopoulos.\nThe \"Ramona\" is one of Rastapopoulos' slave trading ships, and when a fire breaks out aboard it during the night, the ship's commander Allan and his crew cowardly flee, leaving Tintin, Haddock, Snowy and Skut aboard along with a consignment of African slaves. With Haddock taking on the ship's captaincy, they are successfully able to put out the fire. However, Rastapopoulos orders a U-boat to destroy the \"Ramona\", with the ship taking evasive manoeuvres to survive, ultimately being rescued by a fighter from the cruiser USS \"Los Angeles\" after Tintin dispatches numerous distress calls. The \"Los Angeles\" chases down the \"Scheherazade\" and attempts to capture di Gorgonzola, but he fakes his own death and escapes via a mini-submarine. Tintin, Haddock and Snowy return to Belgium and learn that the Emir has recaptured Khemed and with the war now over at Khemed so that Abdullah can return home. Their relaxation is cut short by insurance salesman Jolyon Wagg, who has arranged to use Marlinspike for an auto rally.\nHistory.\nBackground and publication.\nHerg\u00e9 was inspired to develop the plot for \"The Red Sea Sharks\" after reading a magazine article detailing the continued existence of the slave trade within the Arab world, in which it was claimed that African pilgrims headed to Mecca were being enslaved during the journey. \nOne of the routes that supplied the Red Sea slave trade where hajj pilgrims, and the Red Sea Slave trade was still ongoing in the 1950s, slavery in Saudi Arabia and in Yemen being banned in 1962, slavery in Dubai in 1963 and in Oman in 1970. Herg\u00e9 included a reference to this slave trade in the story's original French title, \"Coke en Stock\" (\"Coke on Board\"), which referred to the slave smuggler's use of \"coke\" as a codeword for the enslaved people. \nBefore writing the story, Herg\u00e9 had read \"Balzac et son monde\" (\"Balzac and His World\"), a 1955 book written by his friend F\u00e9licien Marceau. Intrigued by the work of Honor\u00e9 de Balzac, Herg\u00e9 was inspired by how Balzac kept reusing characters from his previous stories and he subsequently adopted this trait for \"The Red Sea Sharks\", in which a wide range of characters from \"The Adventures of Tintin\" make a reappearance. Herg\u00e9 also introduced a new character, the Estonian pilot Piotr Skut, who would later reappear in \"Flight 714 to Sydney\".\nTo produce accurate illustrations for the \"Ramona\", Herg\u00e9 and his assistant Bob de Moor travelled aboard a Swedish cargo vessel, the MS \"Reine Astrid\", from Antwerp to Gothenburg and back, during which they took photographs and drew sketches. Herg\u00e9 had also collected press clippings depicting the \"Christina\", a motor yacht owned by the Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis, and used them as the basis for his depiction of Rastapopoulos' ship, the \"Sheherezade\".\nThe aircraft, cars, and machinery that appear in the story were drawn by Roger Leloup, one of the members of the Studios Herg\u00e9. In one scene in the latter part of the story, Herg\u00e9 included a \nfrogman, whose depiction was drawn from a press clipping of Lionel Crabb. His depiction of the Emir's hideaway palace cut from the rock was based on the Al Khazneh in Petra, Jordan, which he had seen in an issue of \"National Geographic\".\nHerg\u00e9's growing interest in art was reflected in the story, as he included a copy of Alfred Sisley's \"Le Canal du Loing\" at Marlinspike Hall. He also included paintings by Pablo Picasso and Joan Mir\u00f3 aboard Rastapopolous' \"Scheherazade\". Muller's pseudonym in the story, Mull Pasha, was based upon the British soldier Glubb Pasha. The character of Piotr Skut was based on Remi Milk, an Estonian pilot who escaped to Sweden from Estonia in an Arado floatplane. In the final scene, Herg\u00e9 included cameos of both himself and his friend and colleague Edgar P. Jacobs. \nThe story began serialisation in Belgium's \"Tintin\" magazine in October 1956, before being serialised in the French edition of the magazine in December. It was then published in book form by Casterman in 1958. Upon the story's British publication in 1960, \"Coke en Stock\" was renamed \"The Red Sea Sharks\".\nRacism allegations and alterations.\nHerg\u00e9 had been accused of exhibiting a racist attitude toward Africans in \"Tintin in the Congo\", an earlier story, and potentially hoped to exonerate himself from such criticism by depicting Tintin and Haddock freeing African slaves in \"The Red Sea Sharks\". In preparing the latter story he had consulted a colleague who worked for an African-themed magazine, \"L'Afrique et le Monde\" (\"Africa and the World\"); they translated some of the passages that Herg\u00e9 wished to include in the story into Yoruba. However, in January 1962 an article in the magazine \"Jeune Afrique\" criticised Herg\u00e9 for a racist depiction of Africans in the story, an accusation that would be echoed in other publications. These claims focused on the African characters' simplistic use of pidgin language, which was similar to the speech patterns used in \"Tintin in the Congo\".\nAfrican: \"You speak well, Effendi. Wicked Arab, very wicked. Poor black men do not want to be slaves. Poor black men want to go to Mecca\".\nHaddock: \"Naturally, I realise that. But I repeat if you go there, you'll be sold as slaves. Is that what you want?\"\nAfrican: \"We not slaves, Effendi. We good Muslims. We want to go to Mecca\".\nHerg\u00e9 biographer Beno\u00eet Peeters expressed the view that \"for the most part these attacks were extremely unfair\".\nHerg\u00e9 was emotionally affected by the accusations, and made changes to the book for its 1967 reprint accordingly; here he changed the Africans' speech patterns, giving them improved grammar.\nHowever, he left Haddock speaking pidgin in response to the Africans. \nFor this version, he also made changes to the Emir's letter to Tintin; the former version had been formal in its prose, saying \"Most esteemed and well-beloved friend, I entrust to you my son Abdullah, to improve his English. Here the situation is serious. Should any misfortune befall me I count on you, my friend, to care for Abdullah\". In Herg\u00e9's revised edition, he adopts a more florid prose style: \"This is to tell you, oh highly esteemed friend, that I entrusted to you Abdullah, my adored son. Because here the situation is serious. Should misfortune descend on me like the hawk on an innocent gazelle (for the world is made of life and death) I am sure that Abdullah will find you with warmth and affection, refuge and peace. And in doing this you will be performing a fragrant act before Allah\".\nHerg\u00e9 also expressed regret that he depicted the death of a shark in the story, later stating that \"I still believed that sharks were big evil beasts\" when writing \"The Red Sea Sharks\".\nCritical analysis.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"[In \"The Red Sea Sharks\"], total confusion puts an end to the Manichaenism of the opening adventures. The former opposition between Good and Evil now becomes the opposition between the private and the public. Unable to judge such a complex world, Tintin prefers to withdraw from it. He reluctantly takes on this adventure as a traveler without baggage and spends little time with people he formerly would have gotten to know quite well\".\n\u2014 Jean-Marie Apostolid\u00e8s \nCommenting on the inclusion of a wide range of characters from \"The Adventures of Tintin\", Harry Thompson referred to the story as \"a Tintin family reunion\", commenting that it was \"a story unusually full of the type of people Captain Haddock liked to avoid\". Michael Farr believed that in reviving so many older characters, Herg\u00e9 had given \"The Red Sea Sharks\" \"a marked retrospective quality\". Jean-Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier felt that the \"crowded\" nature of the story left little room for series regulars Professor Calculus or Thomson and Thompson, and resulted in the new character of Skut serving only as \"a nice supporting character, but nothing more\". The Lofficiers stated that \"Herg\u00e9 was doing some house-cleaning of his past works and characters before embarking on something more serious and with more personal resonance\", \"Tintin in Tibet\".\nHerg\u00e9 biographer Beno\u00eet Peeters described \"The Red Sea Sharks\" as a \"complex, ambiguous, even labyrinthine\" story which was \"undoubtedly the book in which Herg\u00e9 ventured furthest into the creation of his own universe\". He thought that \"Herg\u00e9 enters a new phase\" with \"The Red Sea Sharks\", as its author \"seems to know his family of characters better and better, and he enjoys playing with them and his reader\". Peeters noted that the book was \"in some respects a continuation\" of \"Land of Black Gold\", an assessment shared by Thompson, the Lofficiers, and Farr, all of whom described it as a partial sequel to the earlier book. Thompson added that \"The Red Sea Sharks\" \"atoned for the relative failure\" of \"Land of Black Gold\", believing that although it had a \"rather hasty finish\", it was \"a first-rate thriller\". The Lofficiers awarded it four out of five, stating that it was \"very effective as a modern political thriller and far more believable than \"The Calculus Affair\"\". They also opined that it provided an effective political commentary on the West's relationship with the Arab world. In their analysis, Tintin and Haddock seek to aid the Emir not because he is a good leader, but for their own selfish purposes (to get Abdullah out of Marlinspike), just as Western governments and corporations build alliances with Arab leaders guilty of human rights abuses in order to benefit their own interests.\nThompson felt that the inclusion of slavery as a key theme led to this book being \"one of Herg\u00e9's more adult-oriented adventures\". Nevertheless, Farr noted that the story contained \"a good measure of humour\" to balance out these darker elements. Farr drew comparisons with Anthony Powell's \"A Dance to the Music of Time\", a series of novels that was contemporary to \"The Red Sea Sharks\" and which was similarly inspired by Balzac's \"The Human Comedy\". Herg\u00e9 biographer Pierre Assouline believed that \"The Red Sea Sharks\" represented \"the culmination of his golden age\", which had begun with \"The Blue Lotus\". He also commented that \"it almost seemed as if Herg\u00e9 had regained the pace and rhythm of his most creative period\" with this story.\nIn his psychoanalytical study of \"The Adventures of Tintin\", the literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolid\u00e8s expressed the view that \"The Red Sea Sharks\" reflected a world in which traditional values have been degraded and everything \u2013 including human life \u2013 has become a commodity. He added that Rastapopoulos becomes \"the embodiment of the global market\" in this story, tying together all of the other characters and therefore replacing Tintin as the figure \"at the centre of the universe\". Apostolid\u00e8s opined that \"The Red Sea Sharks\" amplifies \"the theme of the general equivalence of everything\" that is present in the series, serving as \"a kind of retrospective\" by introducing old characters and establishing new relationships between them. He believed that the theme of the mirage pervaded the story, appearing repeatedly in such forms as Abdullah's cuckoo clock which concealed a water squirter and the pseudonyms employed by the various characters throughout the narrative. The literary critic Tom McCarthy stated that \"The Red Sea Sharks\" exhibited a number of themes that recurred throughout \"The Adventures of Tintin\". He believed that a scene in which one of Bab El Ehr's men spies on the Emir in his mountain hideaway reflected a wider theme of eavesdropping that features throughout the series. McCarthy also highlighted Tintin's actions in returning Abdullah to Khemed, expressing the view that it is part of a wider running theme throughout the series in which the hero takes abandoned children to their home; other instances included Tintin's discovery of an adoptive family for the orphan Chang Chong-Chen in \"The Blue Lotus\" and the delivery of the lost gypsy child Miarka to her family in \"The Castafiore Emerald\".\nAdaptations.\nIn 1991, a collaboration between the French studio Ellipse and the Canadian animation company Nelvana adapted 21 of the stories \u2013 among them \"The Red Sea Sharks\" \u2013 into a series of episodes, each 42 minutes long. Directed by St\u00e9phane Bernasconi, the series has been praised for being \"generally faithful\", with compositions having been actually directly taken from the panels in the original comic book.\nReferences.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Because of the many miracles attributed to his intercession, he is also known as Nicholas the Wonderworker. Saint Nicholas is the patron saint of sailors, merchants, archers, repentant thieves, children, brewers, pawnbrokers, toymakers, unmarried people, and students in various cities and countries around Europe. His reputation evolved among the pious, as was common for early Christian saints, and his legendary habit of secret gift-giving gave rise to the folklore of Santa Claus (\"Saint Nick\") through Sinterklaas.\nLittle is known about the historical Saint Nicholas. The earliest accounts of his life were written centuries after his death and probably contain legendary elaborations. He is said to have been born in the Anatolian seaport of Patara, Lycia, in Asia Minor to wealthy Christian parents. In one of the earliest attested and most famous incidents from his life, he is said to have rescued three girls from being forced into prostitution by dropping a sack of gold coins through the window of their house each night for three nights so their father could pay a dowry for each of them. Other early stories tell of him calming a storm at sea, saving three innocent soldiers from wrongful execution, and chopping down a tree possessed by a demon. In his youth, he is said to have made a pilgrimage to Egypt and Syria Palaestina. Shortly after his return, he became Bishop of Myra. He was later cast into prison during the persecution of Diocletian, but was released after the accession of Constantine.\nAn early list makes him an attendee at the First Council of Nicaea in 325, but he is never mentioned in any writings by people who were at the council. Late, unsubstantiated legends claim that he was temporarily defrocked and imprisoned during the council for slapping the heretic Arius. Another famous late legend tells how he resurrected three children, who had been murdered and pickled in brine by a butcher planning to sell them as pork during a famine.\nFewer than 200 years after Nicholas's death, the St. Nicholas Church was built in Myra under the orders of Theodosius II over the site of the church where he had served as bishop, and his remains were moved to a sarcophagus in that church. In 1087, while the Greek Christian inhabitants of the region were subjugated by the newly arrived Muslim Seljuk Turks, and soon after the beginning of the East\u2013West schism, a group of merchants from the Italian city of Bari removed the major bones of Nicholas's skeleton from his sarcophagus in the church without authorization and brought them to their hometown, where they are now enshrined in the Basilica di San Nicola. The remaining bone fragments from the sarcophagus were later removed by Venetian sailors and taken to Venice during the First Crusade.\nBiographical sources.\nVery little is known about Saint Nicholas's historical life. Any writings Nicholas himself may have produced have been lost and he is not mentioned by any contemporary chroniclers. This is not surprising, since Nicholas lived during . The earliest mentions of Saint Nicholas indicate that, by the sixth century, his following was already well-established. Less than two hundred years after Saint Nicholas's probable death, the Eastern Roman Emperor Theodosius II (ruled 401\u2013450) ordered the building of the Church of Saint Nicholas in Myra, which thereby preserves an early mention of his name. The Byzantine historian Procopius also mentions that the Emperor Justinian I (ruled 527\u2013565) renovated churches in Constantinople dedicated to Saint Nicholas and Saint Priscus, which may have originally been built as early as c. 490.\nNicholas's name also occurs as \"Nicholas of Myra of Lycia\" on the tenth line of a list of attendees at the Council of Nicaea included by Theodore Lector in the \"Historiae Ecclesiasticae Tripartitae Epitome\", written sometime between 510 and 515. A single, offhand mention of Nicholas of Myra also occurs in the biography of another saint, Saint Nicholas of Sion, who apparently took the name \"Nicholas\" to honor him. \"The Life of Saint Nicholas of Sion\", written around 250 years after Nicholas of Myra's death, briefly mentions Nicholas of Sion visiting Nicholas's tomb to pay homage to him. According to Jeremy Seal, the fact that Nicholas had a tomb that could be visited serves as the almost solitary definitive proof that he was a real historical figure.\nIn his treatise \"De statu animarum post mortem\" (written c. 583), the theologian Eustratius of Constantinople cites Saint Nicholas of Myra's miracle of the three generals as evidence that souls may work independent from the body. Eustratius credits a lost \"Life of Saint Nicholas\" as his source. Nearly all the sources Eustratius references date from the late fourth century to early fifth century, indicating the \"Life of Saint Nicholas\" to which he refers was probably written during this time period, shortly after Nicholas's death. The earliest complete account of Nicholas's life that has survived to the present is a \"Life of Saint Nicholas\", written in the early ninth century by Michael the Archimandrite (814\u2013842), nearly 500 years after Nicholas's probable death.\nDespite its extremely late date, Michael the Archimandrite's \"Life of Saint Nicholas\" is believed to heavily rely on older written sources and oral traditions. The identity and reliability of these sources, however, remains uncertain. Catholic historian D. L. Cann and medievalist Charles W. Jones both consider Michael the Archimandrite's \"Life\" the only account of Saint Nicholas that is likely to contain any historical truth. Jona Lendering, a Dutch historian of classical antiquity, notes that Michael the Archimandrite's \"Life\" does not contain a \"conversion narrative\", which was unusual for saints' lives of the period when it was written. He therefore argues that it is possible Michael the Archimandrite may have been relying on a source written before conversion narratives became popular, which would be a positive indication of that source's reliability. He notes that many of the stories recounted by Michael the Archimandrite closely resemble stories told about the first-century AD Neopythagorean philosopher Apollonius of Tyana in the \"Life of Apollonius of Tyana\", an eight-volume biography of him written in the early third century by the Greek writer Philostratus. It was not unusual for Christian saints to adapt older stories of pagan cults. As Apollonius's hometown of Tyana was not far from Myra, Lendering contends that many popular stories about Apollonius may have become attached to Saint Nicholas.\nLife and legends.\nFamily and background.\nAccounts of Saint Nicholas's life agree on the essence of his story, but modern historians disagree regarding how much of this story is actually rooted in historical fact. Traditionally, Nicholas was born in the city of Patara (Lycia et Pamphylia), a port on the Mediterranean Sea, in Asia Minor in the Roman Empire, to a wealthy family of Greek Christians. According to some accounts, his parents were named Epiphanius (, ) and Johanna (, ), but, according to others, they were named Theophanes (, ) and Nonna (, ). In some accounts, Nicholas's uncle was the bishop of the city of Myra, also in Lycia. Recognizing his nephew's calling, Nicholas's uncle ordained him as a priest.\nGenerosity and travels.\nAfter his parents died from an epidemic, Nicholas is said to have distributed their wealth to the poor. In his most famous exploit, which is first attested in Michael the Archimandrite's \"Life of Saint Nicholas\", Nicholas heard of a devout man who had once been wealthy but had lost all of his money due to the \"plotting and envy of Satan.\" The man could not afford proper dowries for his three daughters. This meant that they would remain unmarried and probably, in absence of any other possible employment, be forced to become prostitutes. Hearing of the girls' plight, Nicholas decided to help them, but, being too modest to help the family in public (or to save them the humiliation of accepting charity), he went to the house under the cover of night and threw a purse filled with gold coins through the window opening into the house. The father immediately arranged a marriage for his first daughter, and after her wedding, Nicholas threw a second bag of gold through the same window late at night.\nAccording to Michael the Archimandrite's account, after the second daughter was married, the father stayed awake for at least two \"nights\" and caught Saint Nicholas in the same act of charity toward the third daughter. The father fell on his knees, thanking him, and Nicholas ordered him not to tell anyone about the gifts. The scene of Nicholas's secret gift-giving is one of the most popular scenes in Christian devotional art, appearing in icons and frescoes from across Europe. Although depictions vary depending on time and place, Nicholas is often shown wearing a cowl while the daughters are typically shown in bed, dressed in their nightclothes. Many renderings contain a cypress tree or a cross-shaped cupola.\nThe historicity of this incident is disputed. Adam C. English argues for a historical kernel to the legend, noting the story's early attestation as well as the fact that no similar stories were told about any other Christian saints. Jona Lendering, who also argues for the story's authenticity, notes that a similar story is told in Philostratus's \"Life of Apollonius of Tyana\", in which Apollonius gives money to an impoverished father but posits that Michael the Archimandrite's account is markedly different. Philostratus does not mention the fate of the daughters and, in his story, Apollonius's generosity is purely motivated out of sympathy for the father; in Michael the Archimandrite's account, however, Saint Nicholas is instead expressly stated to be motivated by a desire to save the daughters from being sold into prostitution. He argues that this desire to help women is most characteristic of fourth-century Christianity, due to the prominent role women played in the early Christian movement, rather than Greco-Roman paganism or the Christianity of Michael the Archimandrite's time in the ninth century, by which point the position of women had drastically declined.\nNicholas is also said to have visited the Holy Land. The ship he was on was nearly destroyed by a terrible storm but he rebuked the waves, causing the storm to subside. Thus, Nicholas became venerated as the patron saint of sailors and travelers.\nWhile in Palestine, Nicholas is said to have lived in a crypt near Bethlehem, where the Nativity of Jesus is believed to have taken place. Over the crypt where Nicholas is believed to have lived now stands the \"Church of Saint Nicholas\" in Beit Jala, a Christian town of which Nicholas is the Patron saint.\nBishop of Myra.\nAfter visiting the Holy Land, Nicholas returned to Myra. The bishop of Myra, who had succeeded Nicholas's uncle, had recently died and the priests in the city had decided that the first priest to enter the church that morning would be made bishop. Nicholas went to the church to pray and was therefore proclaimed the new bishop. He is said to have been imprisoned and tortured during the Great Persecution under the Emperor Diocletian (ruled 284\u2013305), but was released under the orders of the Emperor Constantine the Great (ruled 306\u2013337). This story sounds plausible, but is not attested in the earliest sources and is therefore unlikely to be historical.\nOne of the earliest attested stories of Saint Nicholas is one in which he saves three innocent men from execution. According to Michael the Archimandrite, three innocent men were condemned to death by the governor Eustathius. As they were about to be executed, Nicholas appeared, pushed the executioner's sword to the ground, released them from their chains, and angrily chastised a juror who had accepted a bribe. According to Jona Lendering, this story directly parallels an earlier story in Philostratus's \"Life of Apollonius of Tyana\", in which Apollonius prevents the execution of a man falsely condemned of banditry. Michael the Archimandrite also tells another story in which the consul Ablabius accepted a bribe to put three famous generals to death, in spite of their actual innocence. Saint Nicholas appeared to Constantine and Ablabius in dreams, informing Constantine of the truth and frightening Ablabius into releasing the generals, for fear of Hell.\nLater versions of the story are more elaborate, interweaving the two stories together. According to one version, Emperor Constantine sent three of his most trusted generals, named Ursos, Nepotianos, and Herpylion, to put down a rebellion in Phrygia. However, a storm forced them to take refuge in Myra. Unbeknownst to the generals, who were in the harbor, their soldiers further inland were fighting with local merchants and engaging in looting and destruction. Nicholas confronted the generals for allowing their soldiers to misbehave and the generals brought an end to the looting. Immediately after the soldiers had returned to their ships, Nicholas heard word of the three innocent men about to be executed and the three generals aided him in stopping the execution. Eustathius attempted to flee on his horse but Nicholas stopped his horse and chastised him for his corruption. Eustathius, under the threat of being reported directly to the Emperor, repented of his corrupt ways. Afterward, the generals succeeded in ending the rebellion and were promoted by Constantine to even higher status. The generals' enemies, however, slandered them to the consul Ablabius, telling him that they had not really put down the revolt, but instead encouraged their own soldiers to join it. The generals' enemies also bribed Ablabius and he had the three generals imprisoned. Nicholas then made his dream appearances and the three generals were set free.\nCouncil of Nicaea.\nIn 325, Nicholas is said to have attended the First Council of Nicaea, where he is said to have been a staunch opponent of Arianism and a devoted supporter of Trinitarianism, and one of the bishops who signed the Nicene Creed. Nicholas's attendance at the Council of Nicaea is attested early by Theodore the Lector's list of attendees, which records him as the 151st attendee. However, he is conspicuously never mentioned by Athanasius of Alexandria, the foremost defender of Trinitarianism at the council, who knew all the notable bishops of the period, nor is he mentioned by the historian Eusebius, who was also present at the council. Adam C. English notes that lists of the attendees at Nicaea vary considerably, with shorter lists only including roughly 200 names, but longer lists including around 300. Saint Nicholas's name only appears on the longer lists, not the shorter ones. Nicholas's name appears on a total of three early lists, one of which, Theodore the Lector, is generally considered to be the most accurate. According to Jona Lendering, there are two main possibilities:\nA later legend, first attested in the fourteenth century, over 1,000 years after Nicholas's death, holds that, during the Council of Nicaea, Nicholas lost his temper and slapped \"a certain Arian\" across the face. On account of this, Constantine revoked Nicholas's miter and pallium. Steven D. Greydanus concludes that, because of the story's late attestation, it \"has no historical value.\" Jona Lendering, however, defends the veracity and historicity of the incident, arguing that, as it was embarrassing and reflects poorly on Nicholas's reputation, it is inexplicable why later hagiographers would have invented it. Later versions of the legend embellish it, making the heretic Arius himself and having Nicholas punch him rather than merely slapping him with his open hand. In these versions of the story, Nicholas is also imprisoned, but Christ and the Virgin Mary appear to him in his cell. He tells them he is imprisoned \"for loving you\" and they free him from his chains and restore his vestments. The scene of Nicholas slapping Arius is celebrated in Eastern Orthodox icons and episodes of Saint Nicholas at Nicaea are shown in a series of paintings from the 1660s in the Basilica di San Nicola in Bari.\nOther reputed miracles.\nOne story tells how during a terrible famine, a malicious butcher lured three little children into his house, where he killed them, placing their remains in a barrel to cure, planning to sell them off as ham. Nicholas, visiting the region to care for the hungry, saw through the butcher's lies and resurrected the pickled children by making the sign of the cross. Jona Lendering opines that the story is \"without any historical value\". Adam C. English notes that the story of the resurrection of the pickled children is a late medieval addition to the legendary biography of Saint Nicholas and that it is not found in any of his earliest \"Lives\". Although this story seems bizarre and horrifying to modern audiences, it was tremendously popular throughout the Late Middle Ages and the early modern period, and widely beloved by ordinary folk. It is depicted in stained glass windows, wood panel paintings, tapestries, and frescoes. Eventually, the scene became so widely reproduced that, rather than showing the whole scene, artists began to merely depict Saint Nicholas with three naked children and a wooden barrel at his feet.\nAccording to English, eventually, people who had forgotten or never learned the story began misinterpreting representations of it. That Saint Nicholas was shown with children led people to conclude he was the patron saint of children; meanwhile, the fact that he was shown with a barrel led people to conclude that he was the patron saint of brewers.\nAccording to another story, during a great famine that Myra experienced in 311\u2013312, a ship was in the port at anchor, loaded with wheat for the emperor in Constantinople. Nicholas invited the sailors to unload a part of the wheat to help in the time of need. The sailors at first disliked the request, because the wheat had to be weighed accurately and delivered to the emperor. Only when Nicholas promised them that they would not suffer any loss for their consideration did the sailors agree. When they arrived later in the capital, they made a surprising find: the weight of the load had not changed, although the wheat removed in Myra was enough for two full years and could even be used for sowing.\nRelics.\nGemile.\nIt has long been traditionally assumed that Saint Nicholas was originally buried in his home town of Myra, where his relics are later known to have been kept, but some recent archaeological evidence indicates that Saint Nicholas may have originally been entombed in a rock-cut church located at the highest point on the small Turkish island of Gemile, only twenty miles away from his birthplace of Patara. Nicholas's name is painted on part of the ruined building. In antiquity, the island was known as \"Saint Nicholas Island\" and today it is known in Turkish as Gemiler Adasi, meaning \"Island of Boats\", in reference to Saint Nicholas's traditional role as the patron saint of seafarers.\nThe church was built in the fourth century, around the time of Nicholas's death, and is typical of saints' shrines from that time period. Nicholas was the only major saint associated with that part of Turkey. The church where historians believe he was originally entombed is at the western end of the great processional way.\nMyra.\nIn the mid-7th century, Gemile was vulnerable to attack by Arab fleets, so Nicholas's remains appear to have been moved from the island to the city of Myra, where Nicholas had served as bishop for most of his life. Myra is located roughly east of Gemile and its location further inland made it safer from seafaring Arab forces.\nIt is said that, in Myra, the relics of Saint Nicholas each year exuded a clear watery liquid which smelled like rose water, called manna, or myrrh, which was believed by the faithful to possess miraculous powers. As it was widely known that all Nicholas's relics were at Myra in their sealed sarcophagus, it was rare during this period for forgers of relics to claim to possess those belonging to Saint Nicholas.\nA solemn bronze statue of the saint by Russian sculptor Gregory Pototsky was donated by the Russian government in 2000, and was given a prominent place in the square fronting the medieval Church of St Nicholas. In 2005, mayor S\u00fcleyman Top\u00e7u had the statue replaced by a red-suited plastic Santa Claus statue, because he wanted an image more recognisable to foreign visitors. Protests from the Russian government against this were successful, and the bronze statue was returned (albeit without its original high pedestal) to a corner nearer the church.\nOn 28 December 2009, the Turkish government announced that it would be formally requesting the return of Saint Nicholas's skeletal remains to Turkey from the Italian government.\nTurkish authorities asserted that Nicholas himself desired to be buried at his episcopal town, and that his remains were illegally removed from his homeland. In 2017, an archaeological survey at St. Nicholas Church, Demre was reported to have found a temple below the modern church, with excavation work to be done that will allow researchers to determine whether it still holds Nicholas's body. A sarcophagus possibly holding his remains was found there in 2024.\nBari.\nAfter the Battle of Manzikert in 1071, the Byzantine Empire temporarily lost control over most of Asia Minor to the invading Seljuk Turks, and so Greek Christians of Myra became subjects of the Turks. At the same time the Catholic Church in the West had declared (in 1054 AD) that the Greek church, the official church of the Byzantine Empire, was in schism. Because of the many wars in the region, some Christians were concerned that access to the tomb might become difficult.\nTaking advantage of the confusion and the loss by the Greek Christian community of Myra of its Byzantine imperial protection, in the spring of 1087, Italian sailors from Bari in Apulia seized part of the remains of the saint from his burial church in Myra, over the objections of the Greek Orthodox monks in the church.\nAdam C. English describes the removal of the relics from Myra as \"essentially a holy robbery\" and notes the thieves were not only afraid of being caught or chased after by the locals, but also the power of Saint Nicholas himself. Returning to Bari, they brought the remains with them and cared for them. The remains arrived on 9 May 1087. Two years later, Pope Urban II inaugurated a new church, the Basilica di San Nicola, to Saint Nicholas in Bari. The Pope himself personally placed Nicholas's relics into the tomb beneath the altar of the new church. The removal of Saint Nicholas's relics from Myra and their arrival in Bari is reliably recorded by multiple chroniclers, including Orderic Vitalis and 9 May continued to be celebrated every year by western Christians as the day of Nicholas's \"translation\". Eastern Orthodox Christians and the Turks have both long regarded the unauthorized removal of the relics from Myra as a blatant theft, but the people of Bari have instead maintained that it was a rescue mission to save the bones from the Turkish invaders. A legend, shown on the ceiling of the Basilica di San Nicola, holds that Nicholas once visited Bari and predicted that his bones would one day rest there.\nPrior to the translation of Nicholas's relics to Bari, his following had been known in western Europe, but it had not been extremely popular. In autumn of 1096, Norman and Frankish soldiers mustered in Bari in preparation for the First Crusade. Although the Crusaders generally favored warrior saints, which Saint Nicholas was not, the presence of his relics in Bari made him materially accessible. Nicholas's associations with aiding travelers and seafarers also made him a popular choice for veneration. Nicholas's veneration by Crusaders helped promote his following throughout western Europe.\nAfter the relics were brought to Bari, they continued to produce \"myrrh\", much to the joy of their new owners. Vials of myrrh from his relics have been taken all over the world for centuries, and can still be obtained from his church in Bari. Even up to the present day, a flask of manna is extracted from the tomb of Saint Nicholas every year on 6 December (the Saint's feast day) by the clergy of the basilica. The myrrh is collected from a sarcophagus which is located in the basilica vault and could be obtained in the shop nearby. The liquid gradually seeps out of the tomb, but it is unclear whether it originates from the body within the tomb, or from the marble itself; since the town of Bari is a harbour, and the tomb is below sea level, there have been several natural explanations proposed for the manna fluid, including the transfer of seawater to the tomb by capillary action.\nIn 1966, a vault in the crypt underneath the Basilica di San Nicola was dedicated as an Orthodox chapel with an iconostasis in commemoration of the recent lifting of the anathemas the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches had issued against each other during the Great Schism in 1054.\nIn May 2017, following talks between Pope Francis and Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill, a portion of the relics of Saint Nicholas in Bari were sent on loan to Moscow. The relic was on display for veneration at Christ the Savior Cathedral before being taken to Saint Petersburg in mid-June prior to returning to Bari. More than a million people lined up in Moscow for a momentary glimpse of the gilded ark holding one of the saint's ribs.\nVenice.\nThe sailors from Bari took only the main bones of Nicholas's skeleton, leaving all the minor fragments in the grave. The city of Venice had interest in obtaining the remaining fragments of his skeleton. In 1044, they dedicated the San Nicol\u00f2 al Lido monastery basilica to him on the north end of the Lido di Venezia. According to a single chronicle written by an anonymous monk at this monastery, in 1100, a fleet of Venetian ships accompanied by Bishop Enrico Contarini sailed past Myra on their way to Palestine for the First Crusade. Bishop Enrico insisted for the fleet to turn back and set anchor in Myra. The Venetians took the remaining bones of Saint Nicholas, as well as those of several other bishops of Myra, from the church there, which was only guarded by four Orthodox monks, and brought them to Venice, where they deposited them in the San Nicol\u00f2 al Lido. This tradition was lent credence in two scientific investigations of the relics in Bari and Venice, which confirmed that the relics in the two cities are anatomically compatible and may belong to the same person. It is said that someone dies every time the bones of Saint Nicholas in Venice are disturbed. The last time the bones were examined was in July 1992.\nOther locations.\nBecause of Nicholas's skeleton's long confinement in Myra, after it was brought to Bari, the demand for pieces of it rose. Small bones quickly began to disperse across western Europe. The sailors who had transported the bones gave one tooth and two fragments chipped from Nicholas's sarcophagus to the Norman knight William Pantulf. Pantulf took these relics to his hometown of Noron in Normandy, where they were placed in the local Church of St. Peter in June 1092. In 1096, the duke of Apulia gave several bones of Saint Nicholas to the count of Flanders, which he then enshrined in the Abbey of Watten. According to legend, in 1101, Saint Nicholas appeared in a vision to a French clerk visiting the shrine at Bari and told him to take one of his bones with him to his hometown of Port, near Nancy. The clerk took a finger bone back with him to Port, where a chapel was built to Saint Nicholas. Port became an important center of devotion in the following of Nicholas and, in the fifteenth century, a church known as the Basilique Saint-Nicolas was built there dedicated to him. The town itself is now known as \"Saint Nicolas de Port\" in honor of Nicholas.\nThe clergy at Bari strategically gave away samples of Nicholas's bones to promote the following and enhance its prestige. Many of these bones were initially kept in Constantinople, but, after the Sack of Constantinople in 1204 during the Fourth Crusade, these fragments were scattered across western Europe. A hand claimed to belong to Saint Nicholas was kept in the San Nicola in Carcere in Rome. This church, whose name means \"Saint Nicholas in Chains\", was built on the site of a former municipal prison. Stories quickly developed about Nicholas himself having been held in that prison. Mothers would come to the church to pray to Saint Nicholas for their jailed sons to be released and repentant criminals would place votive offerings in the church. As a result of this, Nicholas became the patron saint of prisoners and those falsely accused of crimes. An index finger claimed to belong to Saint Nicholas was kept in a chapel along the Ostian Way in Rome. Another finger was held in Ventimiglia in Liguria. Today, many churches in Europe, Russia, and the United States claim to possess small relics, such as a tooth or a finger bone.\nAn Irish tradition states that the relics of Saint Nicholas are also reputed to have been stolen from Myra by local Norman crusading knights in the twelfth century and buried near Thomastown, County Kilkenny, where a stone slab marks the reputed \"Tomb of Saint Nicholas\". According to the Irish antiquarian John Hunt, the tomb probably actually belongs to a local priest from Jerpoint Abbey.\nRussian Orthodox Church announced on 22 September 2024 that Holy Myrrhbearers Cathedral in Baku received a part of Nicholas' relic as a gift.\nScientific analysis.\nWhereas the devotional importance of relics and the economics associated with pilgrimages caused the remains of most saints to be divided up and spread over numerous churches in several countries, Saint Nicholas is unusual in that most of his bones have been preserved in one spot: his grave crypt in Bari. Even with the allegedly continuing miracle of the manna, the archdiocese of Bari has allowed for one scientific survey of the bones. In the late 1950s, while the crypt was undergoing much-needed restoration, the bones were removed from it for the first time since their interment in 1089. A special Pontiffical Commission permitted Luigi Martino, a professor of human anatomy at the University of Bari, to examine the bones under the commission's supervision. Martino took thousands of measurements, detailed scientific drawings, photographs, and x-rays. These examinations revealed the saint to have died at over seventy years of age and to have been of average height and slender-to-average build. He also suffered from severe chronic arthritis in his spine and pelvis.\nIn 2004, at the University of Manchester, researchers Caroline Wilkinson and Fraco Introna reconstructed the saint's face based on Martino's examination. The review of the data revealed that the historical Saint Nicholas was in height and had a broken nose, which had partially healed, revealing that the injury had been suffered \"ante mortem\". The broken nose appeared to conform with hagiographical reports that Saint Nicholas had been beaten and tortured during the Diocletianic Persecution. The facial reconstruction was produced by Caroline Wilkinson at the University of Manchester and was shown on a BBC2 TV program \"The Real Face of Santa\". In 2014, the Face Lab at Liverpool John Moores University produced an updated reconstruction of Saint Nicholas's face.\nIn 2017, two researchers from Oxford University, Professor Tom Higham and Doctor Georges Kazan, radiocarbon dated a fragment of a pelvis claimed to belong to Saint Nicholas. The fragment originally came from a church in Lyon, France and, at the time of testing, was in the possession of Father Dennis O'Neill, a priest from St Martha of Bethany Church in Illinois. The results of the radiocarbon dating confirmed that the pelvis dates to the fourth century AD, around the same time that Saint Nicholas would have died, and is not a medieval forgery. The bone was one of the oldest the Oxford team had ever examined.\nAccording to Professor Higham, most of the relics the team has examined turn out to be too recent to have actually belonged to the saint to whom they are attributed, but he states, \"This bone fragment, in contrast, suggests that we could possibly be looking at remains from St Nicholas himself.\" Kazan believes the pelvis fragment may come from the same individual as the skeleton divided between the churches in Bari and Venice, since the bone they tested comes from the left pubis, and the only pelvis bone in the collection at Bari is the left ilium. In the absence of DNA testing, however, it is not yet possible to know for certain whether the pelvis is from the same man.\nVeneration and celebrations.\nAmong Greeks and Italians, Saint Nicholas is a favorite of sailors, fishermen, ships and sailing. As a result, and over time, he has become the patron saint of several cities which maintain harbours. In centuries of Greek folklore, Nicholas was seen as \"The Lord of the Sea\", often described by modern Greek scholars as a kind of Christianized version of Poseidon. In modern Greece, he is still easily among the most recognizable saints and 6 December finds many cities celebrating their patron saint. He is also the patron saint of all of Greece and particularly of the Hellenic Navy.\nIn the Eastern Orthodox Church, Saint Nicholas's memory is celebrated on almost every Thursday of the year (together with the Apostles) with special hymns to him which are found in the liturgical book known as the Octoechos. Soon after the transfer of Saint Nicholas's relics from Myra to Bari, an East Slavic version of his Life and an account of the transfer of his relics were written by a contemporary to this event.\nDevotional akathists and canons have been composed in his honour, and are frequently chanted by the faithful as they ask for his intercession. He is mentioned in the Liturgy of Preparation during the Divine Liturgy (Eastern Orthodox Eucharist) and during the All-Night Vigil. Many Orthodox churches will have his icon, even if they are not named after him. In Oriental Orthodoxy, the Coptic Church observes the Departure of St. Nicholas on 10 Kiahk, or 10 Ta\u1e2b\u015ba\u015b in Ethiopia, which corresponds to the Julian Calendar's 6 December and Gregorian Calendar's 19 December.\nNicholas had a reputation for secret gift-giving, such as putting coins in the shoes of those who left them out for him, a practice celebrated on his feast day, 6 December. For those who still observe the Julian calendar the celebration currently takes place thirteen days later than it happens in the Gregorian calendar and Revised Julian calendar.\nIn Serbia, the most common Slava (annual ceremony and veneration of a Serbian family's patron saint) is Saint Nicholas' day celebrated on 19 December.\nIn Monaco, the Cathedral of Our Lady Immaculate was built from 1874 on the site of St Nicholas's church, founded in 1252. A children's Mass is still held on 6 December in the cathedral.\nIn late medieval England, on Saint Nicholas Day parishes held Christmastide \"boy bishop\" celebrations. As part of this celebration, youths performed the functions of priests and bishops, and exercised rule over their elders. Today, Saint Nicholas is still celebrated as a great gift-giver in several Western European and Central European countries. In medieval times, Christian nuns in Belgium and France began to deposit baskets of food and clothes anonymously at the doorsteps of the needy, which gave rise to the practice of gift giving on Saint Nicholas Day. According to another source, on 6 December every sailor or ex-sailor of the Low Countries (which at that time was virtually all of the male population) would descend to the harbour towns to participate in a church celebration for their patron saint. On the way back they would stop at one of the various \"Nicholas fairs\" to buy some hard-to-come-by goods, gifts for their loved ones and invariably some little presents for their children. While the real gifts would only be presented at Christmas, the little presents for the children were given right away, courtesy of Saint Nicholas. This and his miracle of him resurrecting the three butchered children made Saint Nicholas a patron saint of children and later students as well. The custom of giving gifts on Saint Nicholas Day is popular in various parts of Christendom, with a popular tradition including children placing their shoes in the foyer for Saint Nicholas to deliver presents therein.\nSanta Claus evolved from Dutch traditions regarding Saint Nicholas (Sinterklaas). When the Dutch established the colony of New Amsterdam, they brought the legend and traditions of Sinterklaas with them. Howard G. Hageman, of New Brunswick Theological Seminary, maintains that the tradition of celebrating Sinterklaas in New York existed in the early settlements of the Hudson Valley, although by the early nineteenth century had fallen by the way. St. Nicholas Avenue and St. Nicholas Terrace, streets in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City, an area originally settled by Dutch farmers, were named for St. Nicholas of Myra. The name later was taken for nearby St. Nicholas Park, located at the intersection of St. Nicholas Avenue and 127th Street.\nNicholas is honored in the calendar of saints of the Lutheran Churches, as well as in Church of England and in the Episcopal Church on 6 December.\nIconography.\nSaint Nicholas is a popular subject portrayed on Eastern Orthodox icons, particularly Russian and Serbian ones. He is depicted as an Orthodox bishop, wearing the omophorion and holding a Gospel Book. Sometimes he is depicted wearing the Eastern Orthodox mitre, sometimes he is bareheaded. Iconographically, Nicholas is depicted as an elderly man with a short, full, white, fluffy beard and balding head. In commemoration of the miracle attributed to him by tradition at the Council of Nicaea, he is sometimes depicted with Christ over his left shoulder holding out a Gospel Book to him and the Theotokos over his right shoulder holding the omophorion. Because of his patronage of mariners, occasionally Saint Nicholas will be shown standing in a boat or rescuing drowning sailors; Medieval Chants and Polyphony, image on the cover of the Book of Hours of Duke of Berry, 1410.\nIn depictions of Saint Nicholas from Bari, he is usually shown as dark-skinned, probably to emphasize his foreign origin. The emphasis on his foreignness may have been intended to enhance Bari's reputation by displaying that it had attracted the patronage of a saint from a far-off country. In Roman Catholic iconography, Saint Nicholas is depicted as a bishop, wearing the insignia of this dignity: a bishop's vestments, a mitre and a crozier. The episode with the three dowries is commemorated by showing him holding in his hand either three purses, three coins or three balls of gold. Depending on whether he is depicted as patron saint of children or sailors, his images will be completed by a background showing ships, children or three figures climbing out of a wooden barrel (the three slaughtered children he resurrected).\nIn a strange twist, the three gold balls referring to the dowry affair are sometimes metaphorically interpreted as being oranges or other fruits. As in the Low Countries in medieval times oranges most frequently came from Spain, this led to the belief that the Saint lives in Spain and comes to visit every winter bringing them oranges, other 'wintry' fruits and tales of magical creatures.\nMusic.\nIn 1948, Benjamin Britten completed a cantata, \"Saint Nicolas\" on a text by Eric Crozier which covers the saint's legendary life in a dramatic sequence of events. A tenor soloist appears as Saint Nicolas, with a mixed choir, boys singers, strings, piano duet, organ and percussion.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

'Gold water from Danzig'), ; , with \"Goldwasser\" as the registered tradename, is a strong (40% ABV) root and herbal liqueur which was produced from 1598 to 2009 in Gda\u0144sk (). Production now takes place in Germany.\nThe most prominent characteristic of the drink is small flakes of 23 karat gold suspended in it. The beverage also includes herbs and spices such as cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, lavender, thyme, coriander and juniper, and has a syrupy texture.\nAlcoholic solutions were used by artists for gilding, which is believed to be the inspiration for the drink. Alchemy, which was at its high point in the late 16th century when Goldwasser appeared, held gold to have many desirable medical properties; while modern medicine disputes this, native gold is known to be non-toxic to humans and to pass through the digestive tract unchanged, unlike most other heavy metals. Since the flakes are extremely small and thin, the price is not prohibitive. When used as a food additive, gold is labelled as E175; see \"List of food additives,\" Codex Alimentarius.\nThe drink was invented by a Dutchman from De Lier, Ambrosius Vermeulen who moved to Poland and became a citizen of Danzig on 6 July 1598. In 1704 Ambrosius' grandson Salomon Verm\u00f6llen and his brother-in-law Isaac Wed-Ling moved production to new premises located in the \"Breitgasse\". At that time it was common for houses to use animal symbols instead of numbers, and the new factory featured a salmon () on the fa\u00e7ade; hence the naming of the brand \"\".\nDuring his trip to Western Europe \u2014 the so-called Grand Embassy \u2014 Russian Tsar Peter I the Great visited the city of Danzig. He founded the official Russian consulate in Danzig and became a great lover of Goldwasser. He ordered permanent delivery of Goldwasser to Russia for himself.\nAs the Free City of Danzig was separated from Germany after World War I by the Polish corridor, the \"Der Lachs\" company opened in 1922 an additional factory in Berlin to supply the main part of Germany and international markets with their products \"Goldwasser\" and \"\" from there. After 1945, when the city again became part of Poland, only the Berlin factory continued to produce genuine \"Danziger Goldwasser\". In 1971 \"Der Lachs\" was taken over by the Hardenberg-Wilthen distillery and production was moved to the town of N\u00f6rten-Hardenberg in West Germany.\nIt is possible to buy the original brand of \"Goldwasser\" in the old town of Gda\u0144sk. The original Goldwasser distillery building, though not operational, has been rebuilt as it was before the war, and is now home to the exclusive restaurant \"Pod \u0141ososiem\" (The Salmon).\nVarious Polish brands from Gda\u0144sk sell similar drinks called \"Gda\u0144ska Z\u0142ot\u00f3wka\" (Gda\u0144sk gold) or \"Z\u0142ota Woda\" (Gold water).\nW\u00f3dka Gda\u0144ska is mentioned by the Polish-Lithuanian poet Adam Mickiewicz as a drink popular with the Polish nobility.\nLegend has it that when King of Poland Sigismund II Augustus visited Danzig in 1549 after his coronation, part of the city's homage to the monarch was a gift of Goldwasser, and he is said to have sung the praises of the golden drink often along the rest of his tour.\nAnother brand of Goldwasser, \"Schwabacher Goldwasser\", and other sorts of food embellished with gold, are produced in the city of Schwabach near Nuremberg. Goldschl\u00e4ger is a Swiss cinnamon schnapps which also contains small flakes of 22 karat gold.\nGoldwasser is used to flavour Souffl\u00e9 Rothschild."}

It asserts the equal validity of all points of view and the relative nature of truth, which is determined by an individual or their culture.\nThe concept was established by anthropologist Franz Boas, who first articulated the idea in 1887: \"civilization is not something absolute, but...is relative, and... our ideas and conceptions are true only so far as our civilization goes\". However, Boas did not use the phrase \"cultural relativism\". The concept was spread by Boas' students, such as Robert Lowie.\nThe first use of the term recorded in the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" was by philosopher and social theorist Alain Locke in 1924 to describe Lowie's \"extreme cultural relativism\", found in the latter's 1917 book \"Culture and Ethnology\". \nThe term became common among anthropologists after Boas' death in 1942, to express their synthesis of a number of ideas he had developed. Boas believed that the sweep of cultures, to be found in connection with any subspecies, is so vast and pervasive that there cannot be a relationship between culture and race. Cultural relativism involves specific epistemological and methodological claims. Whether or not these claims necessitate a specific ethical stance is a matter of debate. Cultural relativism became popularized after World War II in reaction to historical events such as \"Nazism, and to colonialism, ethnocentrism and racism more generally.\"\nIn antiquity.\nHerodotus (\"Histories\" 3.38) observes on the relativity of \"mores\" (\u03bd\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If anyone, no matter who, were given the opportunity of choosing from amongst all the nations in the world the set of beliefs which he thought best, he would inevitably\u2014after careful considerations of their relative merits\u2014choose that of his own country. Everyone without exception believes his own native customs, and the religion he was brought up in, to be the best; and that being so, it is unlikely that anyone but a madman would mock at such things. There is abundant evidence that this is the universal feeling about the ancient customs of one's country.\u2014\u200a\nHerodotus mentions an anecdote of Darius the Great who illustrated the principle by inquiring about the funeral customs of the Greeks and the Callatiae, peoples from the extreme western and eastern fringes of his empire, respectively. They practiced cremation and funerary cannibalism, respectively, and were each dismayed and abhorred at the proposition of the other tribes' practices.\nThe works of the Pyrrhonist philosopher Sextus Empiricus detail ancient Greek arguments for cultural relativism as part of the tenth of the \"Ten Modes\" of Aenesidemus.\nAs a methodological and heuristic device.\nAccording to George E. Marcus and Michael M. J. Fischer:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;20th century social and cultural anthropology has promised its still largely Western readership enlightenment on two fronts. The one has been the salvaging of distinct cultural forms of life from a process of apparent global Westernization. With both its romantic appeal and its scientific intentions, anthropology has stood for the refusal to accept this conventional perception of homogenization toward a dominant Western model.\nCultural relativism was, in part, a response to Western ethnocentrism. Ethnocentrism may take obvious forms, in which one consciously believes that one's people's arts are the most beautiful, values the most virtuous, and beliefs the most truthful. Franz Boas, originally trained in physics and geography, and heavily influenced by the thought of Kant, Herder, and von Humboldt, argued that one's culture may mediate and thus limit one's perceptions in less obvious ways. Boas understood \"culture\" to include not only certain tastes in food, art, and music, or beliefs about religion; he assumed a much broader notion of culture, defined as:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[T]he totality of the mental and physical reactions and activities that characterize the behavior of the individuals composing a social group collectively and individually in relation to their natural environment, to other groups, to members of the group itself, and of each individual to himself.\nThis view of culture confronts anthropologists with two problems: first, how to escape the unconscious bonds of one's own culture, which inevitably bias our perceptions of and reactions to the world, and second, how to make sense of an unfamiliar culture. The principle of cultural relativism thus forced anthropologists to develop innovative methods and heuristic strategies.\nAs a methodological tool.\nBetween World War I and II, \"cultural relativism\" was the central tool for American anthropologists in this rejection of Western claims to universality and salvage of non-Western cultures. It functioned to transform Boas' epistemology into methodological lessons.\nThis is most obvious in the case of language. Although language is commonly thought of as a means of communication, Boas called attention especially to the idea that it is also a means of categorizing experiences, hypothesizing that the existence of different languages suggests that people categorize, and thus experience, language differently (this view was more fully developed in the hypothesis of Linguistic relativity).\nThus, although all people perceive visible radiation the same way, in terms of a continuum of color, people who speak different languages slice up this continuum into discrete colors in different ways. Some languages have no word that corresponds to the English word \"green\". When people who speak such languages are shown a green chip, some identify it using their word for \"blue\", others identify it using their word for \"yellow\". Thus, Boas's student Melville Herskovits summed up the principle of cultural relativism thus: \"Judgements are based on experience, and experience is interpreted by each individual in terms of his own enculturation.\"\nBoas pointed out that scientists grow up and work in a particular culture, and are thus necessarily ethnocentric. He provided an example of this in his 1889 article \"On Alternating Sounds\". A number of linguists at Boas's time had observed that speakers of some Native-American languages pronounced the same word with different sounds indiscriminately. They thought that this meant that the languages were unorganized and lacked strict rules for pronunciation, and they took it as evidence that the languages were more primitive than their own. Boas, however, noted that the variant pronunciations were not an effect of lack of organization of sound patterns, but an effect of the fact that these languages organized sounds differently from English. The languages grouped sounds that were considered distinct in English into a single sound, but also having contrasts that did not exist in English. He then argued the case that Native Americans had been pronouncing the word in question the same way, consistently, and the variation was only perceived by someone whose own language distinguishes those two sounds. Boas's student, the linguist Edward Sapir, later noted also that English speakers pronounce sounds differently even when they think they are pronouncing the same sound. For example, few English speakers realize that the sounds written with the letter \u27e8t\u27e9 in the words \"tick\" and \"stick\" are phonetically different, the first being generally aspirated and the other unaspirated; a speaker of a language where this contrast is meaningful would instantly perceive them as different sounds and tend not to see them as different realizations of a single phoneme.\nBoas's students did not draw only on his engagement with German philosophy. They also engaged the work of contemporary philosophers and scientists, such as Karl Pearson, Ernst Mach, Henri Poincar\u00e9, William James, and John Dewey in an attempt to move, in the words of Boas's student Robert Lowie, from \"a naively metaphysical to an epistemological stage\" as a basis for revising the methods and theories of anthropology.\nBoas and his students realized that, if they were to conduct scientific research in other cultures, they would need to employ methods that would help them escape the limits of their own ethnocentrism. One such method is that of ethnography: basically, they advocated living with people of another culture for an extended period of time, so that they could learn the local language and be enculturated, at least partially, into that culture.\nIn this context, cultural relativism is an attitude that is of fundamental methodological importance, because it calls attention to the importance of the local context in understanding the meaning of particular human beliefs and activities. Thus, in 1948 Virginia Heyer wrote: \"Cultural relativity, to phrase it in starkest abstraction, states the relativity of the part to the whole. The part gains its cultural significance by its place in the whole, and cannot retain its integrity in a different situation.\"\nAs a heuristic tool.\nAnother method was ethnology: to compare and contrast as wide a range of cultures as possible, in a systematic and even-handed manner. In the late nineteenth century, this study occurred primarily through the display of material artifacts in museums. Curators typically assumed that similar causes produce similar effects; therefore, in order to understand the causes of human action, they grouped similar artifacts together\u2014regardless of provenance. Their aim was to classify artifacts, like biological organisms, according to families, genera, and species. Thus organized museum displays would illustrate the evolution of civilization from its crudest to its most refined forms.\nIn an article in the journal \"Science\", Boas argued that this approach to cultural evolution ignored one of Charles Darwin's main contributions to evolutionary theory:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBoas argued that although similar causes produce similar effects, different causes may also produce similar effects. Consequently, similar artifacts found in distinct and distant places may be the products of distinct causes. Against the popular method of drawing analogies in order to reach generalizations, Boas argued in favor of an inductive method. Based on his critique of contemporary museum displays, Boas concluded:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBoas's student Alfred Kroeber described the rise of the relativist perspective thus:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Now while some of the interest in (so called solial culture science) anthropology in its earlier stages was in the exotic and the out-of-the-way, yet even this antiquarian motivation ultimately contributed to a broader result. Anthropologists became aware of the diversity of culture. They began to see the tremendous range of its variations. From that, they commenced to envisage it as a totality, as no historian of one period or of a single people was likely to do, nor any analyst of his own type of civilization alone. They became aware of culture as a \"universe\", or vast field in which we of today and our own civilization occupy only one place of many. The result was a widening of a fundamental point of view, a departure from unconscious ethnocentricity toward relativity. This shift from naive self-centeredness in one's own time and spot to a broader view based on objective comparison is somewhat like the change from the original geocentric assumption of astronomy to the Copernican interpretation of the solar system and the subsequent still greater widening to a universe of galaxies.\nThis conception of culture, and principle of cultural relativism, were for Kroeber and his colleagues the fundamental contribution of anthropology, and what distinguished anthropology from similar disciplines such as sociology and psychology.\nRuth Benedict, another of Boas's students, also argued that an appreciation of the importance of culture and the problem of ethnocentrism demands that the scientist adopt cultural relativism as a method. Her 1934 book, \"Patterns of Culture\", did much to popularize the term in the United States. In it, she explained that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The study of custom can be profitable only after certain preliminary propositions have been violently opposed. In the first place any scientific study requires that there be no preferential weighting of one or another items in the series it selects for its consideration. In all the less controversial fields like the study of cacti or termites or the nature of nebulae, the necessary method of study is to group the relevant material and to take note of all possible variant forms and conditions. In this way we have learned all that we know of the laws of astronomy, or of the habits of the social insects, let us say. It is only in the study of man himself that the major social sciences have substituted the study of one local variation, that of Western civilization.\nBenedict was adamant that she was not romanticizing so-called primitive societies; she was emphasizing that any understanding of the totality of humanity must be based on as wide and varied a sample of individual cultures as possible. Moreover, it is only by appreciating a culture that is profoundly different from our own, that we can realize the extent to which our own beliefs and activities are culture-bound, rather than natural or universal. In this context, cultural relativism is a heuristic device of fundamental importance because it calls attention to the importance of variation in any sample that is used to derive generalizations about humanity.\nAs a critical device.\nMarcus and Fischer's attention to anthropology's refusal to accept Western culture's claims to universality implies that cultural relativism is a tool not only in cultural understanding, but in cultural critique. This points to the second front on which they believe anthropology offers people enlightenment:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe critical function of cultural relativism is widely understood; philosopher John Cook observed that \"It is aimed at getting people to admit that although it may \"seem\" to them that their moral principles are self-evidently true, and hence \"seem\" to be grounds for passing judgement on other peoples, in fact, the self-evidence of these principles is a kind of illusion.\" Cook recognizes the middle ground in between moral relativism and moral absolutism that cultural relativism straddles, remarking that the ensuing battlegrounds that arise tend to be in the domain of claims of self-evidence made on behalf of a people.\nThe critical function was indeed one of the ends to which Benedict hoped her own work would meet. The most famous use of cultural relativism as a means of cultural critique is Margaret Mead's research of adolescent female sexuality in Samoa. By contrasting the ease and freedom enjoyed by Samoan teenagers, Mead called into question claims that the stress and rebelliousness that characterize American adolescence is natural and inevitable.\nAs Marcus and Fischer point out, however, this use of relativism can be sustained only if there is ethnographic research in the United States comparable to the research conducted in Samoa. Although every decade has witnessed anthropologists conducting research in the United States, the very principles of relativism have led most anthropologists to conduct research in foreign countries.\nComparison to moral relativism.\nAccording to Marcus and Fischer, when the principle of cultural relativism was popularized after World War II, it came to be understood \"more as a doctrine, or position,\nThe principle of cultural relativity does not mean that because the members of some savage tribe are allowed to behave in a certain way that this fact gives intellectual warrant for such behavior in all groups. Cultural relativity means, on the contrary, that the appropriateness of any positive or negative custom must be evaluated with regard to how this habit fits with other group habits. While breeding a healthy scepticism as to the eternity of any value prized by a particular people, anthropology does not as a matter of theory deny the existence of moral absolutes. Rather, the use of the comparative method provides a scientific means of discovering such absolutes. If all surviving societies have found it necessary to impose some of the same restrictions upon the behavior of their members, this makes a strong argument that these aspects of the moral code are indispensable.\nAlthough Kluckhohn was using language that was popular at the time (e.g. \"savage tribe\") but which is now considered antiquated and coarse by most anthropologists, his point was that although moral standards are rooted in one's culture, anthropological research reveals that the fact that people have moral standards is a universal. He was especially interested in deriving specific moral standards that are universal, although few if any anthropologists think that he was successful.\nThere is an ambiguity in Kluckhohn's formulation that would haunt anthropologists in the years to come. It makes it clear that one's moral standards make sense in terms of one's culture. He waffles, however, on whether the moral standards of one society could be applied to another. Four years later American anthropologists had to confront this issue head-on.\nVertical and horizontal relativism.\nIt was James Lawrence Wray-Miller who provided an additional clarification tool, or caveat, of the theoretical underpinnings of cultural relativism by dividing it into two binary, analytical continuums: vertical and horizontal cultural relativism. Ultimately, these two analytical continuums share the same basic conclusion: that human morality and ethics are not static but fluid and vary across cultures depending on the time period and current condition of any particular culture.\nVertical relativism describes that cultures, throughout history (\"vertical\"\u2014i.e., passage through past and future), are products of the prevailing societal norms and conditions of their respective historical periods. Therefore, any moral or ethical judgments, made during the present, regarding past cultures' belief systems or societal practices must be firmly\ngrounded and informed by these norms and conditions to be intellectually useful. Vertical relativism also accounts for the possibility that cultural values and norms will necessarily change as influencing norms and conditions change in the future.\nHorizontal relativism describes that cultures in the present (\"horizontal\" in time\u2014i.e., the present period of the culture) are products of the prevailing norms and conditions developed as a result of their unique geographies, histories, and environmental influences. Therefore, moral or ethical judgments, made during the present, regarding a current culture's belief system or societal practices must account for these unique differences to be intellectually useful.\nStatement on human rights.\nThe transformation of cultural relativism as a heuristic tool into the doctrine of moral relativism occurred in the context of the work of the Commission of Human Rights of the United Nations in preparing the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948).\nMelville J. Herskovits prepared a draft \"Statement on Human Rights\" which Executive Board of the American Anthropological Association revised, submitted to the Commission on Human Rights, and then published. The statement begins with a fairly straightforward explanation of the relevance of cultural relativism:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The problem is thus to formulate a statement of human rights that will do more than phrase respect for the individual as individual. It must also take into full account the individual as a member of a social group of which he is part, whose sanctioned modes of life shape his behavior, and with whose fate his own is thus inextricably bound.\nThe bulk of this statement emphasizes concern that the Declaration of Human Rights was being prepared primarily by people from Western societies, and would express values that, far from being universal, are really Western:\nToday the problem is complicated by the fact that the Declaration must be of world-wide applicability. It must embrace and recognize the validity of many different ways of life. It will not be convincing to the Indonesian, the African, the Chinese, if it lies on the same plane as like documents of an earlier period. The rights of Man in the Twentieth Century cannot be circumscribed by the standards of any single culture, or be dictated by the aspirations of any single people. Such a document will lead to frustration, not realization of the personalities of vast numbers of human beings.\nAlthough this statement could be read as making a procedural point (that the Commission must involve people of diverse cultures, especially cultures that had been or are still under European colonial or imperial domination), the document ended by making two substantive claims:\nThese claims provoked an immediate response by a number of anthropologists. Julian Steward (who, as a student of Alfred Kroeber and Robert Lowie, and as a professor at Columbia University, was situated firmly in the Boasian lineage) suggested that the first claim \"may have been a loophole to exclude Germany from the advocated tolerance\", but that it revealed the fundamental flaw in moral relativism:\"Either we tolerate everything, and keep hands off, or we fight intolerance and conquest\u2014political and economic as well as military\u2014in all their forms.\" Similarly, he questioned whether the second principle means that anthropologists \"approve the social caste system of India, the racial caste system of the United States, or many other varieties of social discrimination in the world.\" Steward and others argued that any attempt to apply the principle of cultural relativism to moral problems would only end in contradiction: either a principle that seems to stand for tolerance ends up being used to excuse intolerance, or the principle of tolerance is revealed to be utterly intolerant of any society that seems to lack the (arguably, Western) value of tolerance. They concluded that anthropologists must stick to science, and engage in debates over values only as individuals.\nGovernmental usage.\nSeveral countries have used cultural relativism as a justification for limiting the rights in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, despite the World Conference on Human Rights rejecting it as a refutation of human rights violations.\nA 2011 study by international legal expert Roger Lloret Blackburn, examining the Universal Periodic Reviews, distinguishes several different groups of nations:\nCriticism.\nCultures differ in values, practices, and outcomes \u2014 some prioritize individual liberty, others collective harmony; some advance scientific inquiry, others may suppress it. These differences can lead to measurable disparities in things like human rights, economic prosperity, or technological development.\nThe debate over the \"Statement on Human Rights\", then, was not merely over the validity of cultural relativism, or the question of what makes a right universal. It forced anthropologists to confront the question of whether anthropological research is relevant to non-anthropologists. Although Steward and Barnett seemed to be suggesting that anthropology as such should restrict itself to purely academic affairs, people within and without the academy have continued to debate the ways non-anthropologists have used this principle in public policy concerning ethnic minorities or in international relations.\nPolitical scientist Alison Dundes Renteln has argued that most debates over moral relativism misunderstand the importance of cultural relativism. Most philosophers understand the Benedictine\u2013Herskovitz formulation of cultural relativism to mean:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[W]hat is right or good for one individual or society is not right or good for another, even if the situations are similar, meaning not merely that what is thought right or good by one is not thought right or good by another...but that what is really right or good in one case is not so in another.\nAlthough this formulation clearly echoes the kinds of example anthropologists used in elaborating cultural relativism, Renteln believes that it misses the spirit of the principle. Accordingly, she supports a different formulation: \"there are or can be no value judgements that are true, that is, objectively justifiable, independent of specific cultures.\"\nRenteln faults philosophers for disregarding the heuristic and critical functions of cultural relativism. Her main argument is that in order to understand the principle of cultural relativism, one must recognize the extent to which it is based on enculturation: \"the idea that people unconsciously acquire the categories and standards of their culture.\" This observation, which echoes the arguments about culture that originally led Boas to develop the principle, suggests that the use of cultural relativism in debates of rights and morals is not substantive but procedural. That is, it does not require a relativist to sacrifice his or her values. But it does require anyone engaged in a consideration of rights and morals to reflect on how their own enculturation has shaped their views:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;There is no reason why the relativist should be paralyzed, as critics have often asserted. But a relativist will acknowledge that the criticism is based on his own ethnocentric standards and realizes also that the condemnation may be a form of cultural imperialism.\nRenteln thus bridges the gap between the anthropologist as scientist (whom Steward and Barnett felt had nothing to offer debates on rights and morality) and as private individual (who has every right to make value judgements). The individual keeps this right, but the scientist requires that the individual acknowledge that these judgements are neither self-evident universals, nor entirely personal (and idiosyncratic), but rather took form in relation to the individual's own culture.\nPost-colonial politics.\nBoas and his students understood anthropology to be a historical, or human science, in that it involves subjects (anthropologists) studying other subjects (humans and their activities), rather than subjects studying objects (such as rocks or stars). Under such conditions, it is fairly obvious that scientific research may have political consequences, and the Boasians saw no conflict between their scientific attempts to understand other cultures, and the political implications of critiquing their own culture. For anthropologists working in this tradition, the doctrine of cultural relativism as a basis for moral relativism was anathema. For politicians, moralists, and many social scientists (but few anthropologists) who saw science and human interests as necessarily independent or even opposed, however, the earlier Boasian principle of cultural relativism was anathema. Thus, cultural relativism came under attack, but from opposing sides and for opposing reasons.\nPolitical critique.\nOn the one hand, many anthropologists began to criticize the way moral relativism, in the guise of cultural relativism, is used to mask the effects of Western colonialism and imperialism. Thus, Stanley Diamond argued that when the term \"cultural relativism\" entered popular culture, popular culture co-opted anthropology in a way that voided the principle of any critical function:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Relativism is the bad faith of the conqueror, who has become secure enough to become a tourist.\nCultural relativism is a purely intellectual attitude; it does not inhibit the anthropologist from participating as a professional in his own milieu; on the contrary, it rationalizes that milieu. Relativism is self-critical only in the abstract. Nor does it lead to engagement. It only converts the anthropologist into a shadowy figure, prone to newsworthy and shallow pronouncements about the cosmic condition of the human race. It has the effect of mystifying the profession, so that the very term \"anthropologist\" (\"student of man\") commands the attention of an increasingly \"popular\" audience in search of novelty. But the search for self-knowledge, which Montaigne was the first to link to the annihilation of prejudice, is reduced to the experience of culture shock, a phrase used by both anthropologists and the State Department to account for the disorientation that usually follows an encounter with an alien way of life. But culture shock is a condition one recovers from; it is not experienced as an authentic redefinition of the personality but as a testing of its tolerance ... The tendency of relativism, which it never quite achieves, is to detach the anthropologist from all particular cultures. Nor does it provide him with a moral center, only a job.\nGeorge Stocking summarized this view with the observation that \"Cultural relativism, which had buttressed the attack against racialism, [can] be perceived as a sort of neo-racialism justifying the backward techno-economic status of once colonized peoples.\"\nDefence by Clifford Geertz.\nBy the 1980s many anthropologists had absorbed the Boasian critique of moral relativism, and were ready to reevaluate the origins and uses of cultural relativism. In a distinguished lecture before the American Anthropological Association in 1984, Clifford Geertz claimed that the critics of cultural relativism did not really understand, and were not really responding to, the ideas of Benedict, Herskovits, Kroeber and Kluckhohn. Consequently, the various critics and proponents of cultural relativism were talking past one another. What these different positions have in common, Geertz argued, is that they are all responding to the same thing: knowledge about other ways of life.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The supposed conflict between Benedict's and Herskovits's call for tolerance and the untolerant passion with which they called for it turns out not to be the simple contradiction so many amateur logicians have held it to be, but the expression of a perception, caused by thinking a lot about Zunis and Dahomys, that the world being so full of a number of things, rushing to judgement is more than a mistake, it is a crime. Similarly, Kroeber's and Kluckholn's verities \u2013 Kroeber's were mostly about messy creatural matters like delirium and menstruation, Kluckholn's were mostly about messy social ones like lying and killing within the in-group, turn out not to be just the arbitrary personal obsessions they so much look like, but the expression of a much vaster concern, caused by thinking a lot about \"anthr\u014dpos\" in general, that if something isn't anchored everywhere nothing can be anchored anywhere. Theory here \u2013 if that is what these earnest advices about how we must look at things if we are to be accounted as decent should be called \u2013 is more an exchange of warnings than an analytical debate. We are being offered a choice of worries.\nWhat the relativists \u2013 so-called \u2013 want us to worry about is provincialism \u2013 the danger that our perceptions will be dulled, our intellects constricted, and our sympathies narrowed by the overlearned and overvalued acceptances of our own society. What the anti-relativists \u2013 self-declared \u2013 want us to worry about, and worry about and worry about, as though our very souls depended on it, is a kind of spiritual entropy, a heat death of the mind, in which everything is as significant, and thus as insignificant, as everything else: anything goes, to each his own, you pays your money and you takes your choice, I know what I like, not in the couth, \"tout comprendre, c'est tout pardonner\".\nGeertz concludes this discussion by commenting, \"As I have already suggested, I myself find provincialism altogether the more real concern so far as what actually goes on in the world.\" Geertz' defense of cultural relativism as a concern which should motivate various inquiries, rather than as an explanation or solution, echoed a comment Alfred Kroeber made in reply to earlier critics of cultural relativism, in 1949:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Obviously, relativism poses certain problems when from trying merely to understand the world we pass on to taking action in the world: and right decisions are not always easy to find. However, it is also obvious that authoritarians who know the complete answers beforehand will necessarily be intolerant of relativism: they should be, if there is only one truth and that is theirs.\nI admit that hatred of the intolerant for relativism does not suffice to make relativism true. But most of us are human enough for our belief in relativism to be somewhat reinforced just by that fact. At any rate, it would seem that the world has come far enough so that it is only by starting from relativism and its tolerations that we may hope to work out a new set of absolute values and standards, if such are attainable at all or prove to be desirable.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Religious intolerance, rather, occurs when a person or group (e.g., a society, a religious group, a non-religious group) specifically refuses to tolerate the religious convictions and practices of a religious group or individual.\nHistorical perspectives.\nThe intolerance, and even the active persecution of religious minorities (sometimes religious majorities as in modern Bahrain or the Pre-Dutch Indonesian kingdoms), has a long history. Almost all religions have historically faced and perpetrated persecution of other viewpoints.\nThe modern concept of religious tolerance developed out of the European wars of religion, more specifically out of the Peace of Westphalia which ended the 30 Years' War (1618\u20131648), during the Protestant Reformation and the ensuing conflicts between Protestants and Catholics in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. The doctrine of 'religious toleration' was established as a result of the 30 Years' War between the Catholic Hapsburgs and newly Protestant nations like Sweden under Gustavus Adolphus. At this time, rulers sought to eradicate religious sentiments and dogmas from their political demesnes. The 1648 Treaty gave nations the right of sovereignty and it also allowed minority Christian denominations to exist within the Holy Roman Empire.\nContemporary attitude and practice.\nThe constitutions of some countries contain provisions which expressly forbid the state from engaging in certain acts of religious intolerance and these same provisions also forbid the state from showing a preference for a particular religion within its own borders, examples of such provisions include the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, the Article 4 of the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany, Article 44.2.1 of the Constitution of Ireland, Article 40 of the Estonian Constitution, Article 24 of the Constitution of Turkey, Article 36 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, and Article 3 Section 5 of the Constitution of the Philippines.\nOther states, whilst not containing constitutional provisions which are directly related to religion, nonetheless contain provisions which forbid discrimination on religious grounds (see, for example, Article 1 of the Constitution of France, article 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and article 40 of the Constitution of Egypt). These constitutional provisions do not necessarily guarantee that all elements of the state remain free from religious intolerance at all times, and practice can vary widely from country to country.\nOther countries, meanwhile, may allow for religious preference, for instance through the establishment of one or more state religions, but not for religious intolerance. Finland, for example, has the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland and Finnish Orthodox Church as its official state religions, yet upholds the right of free expression of religion in article 11 of its constitution.\nIn Nazi Germany, smaller religious minorities such as the Jehovah's Witnesses and the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith were banned in Germany, while the eradication of Judaism was attempted along with the genocide of its adherents.\nHundreds of religious riots have been recorded, in every decade of independent India. In these riots, the victims have included many Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Christians and Buddhists. The US Commission on International Religious Freedom classified India as Tier-2 in persecuting religious minorities, the same as that of Iraq and Egypt. In a 2018 report, USCIRF charged Hindu nationalist groups for their campaign to \"Saffronize\" India through violence, intimidation, and harassment against non-Hindus. Approximately one-third of state governments enforced anti-conversion and/or anti-cow slaughter laws against non-Hindus, and mobs engaged in violence against Muslims whose families have been engaged in the dairy, leather, or beef trades for generations, and against Christians for proselytizing. \"Cow protection\" lynch mobs killed at least 10 victims in 2017.\nSome countries retain laws which forbid the defamation of religious beliefs. Some constitutions retain laws which forbid all forms of blasphemy (e.g., Germany where, in 2006, Manfred van H. was convicted of blasphemy against Islam). The connection between intolerance and blasphemy laws is closest when the laws apply to only one religion. In Pakistan blasphemy directed against either the tenets of the Qur'an or the Prophet Muhammad is punishable by either life imprisonment or death. Apostasy, the rejection of one's old religion, is also criminalized in a number of countries, notably Afghanistan with Abdul Rahman being the first to face the death penalty for converting to Christianity. Though, he was later released.\nThe United Nations upholds the right to freely express one's religious beliefs, as listed in the UN's charter, and additionally in articles 2 and 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Article 2 forbids discrimination based on religious grounds. Article 18 protects the freedom to change one's religion. \nAs a treaty, not a declaration, is legally binding, the signing of the human rights declaration is a public pledge of commitment. Out of a desire to avoid subservience to an international court, the United States chose in 1998 to pass the International Religious Freedom Act, creating the Commission on International Religious Freedom, and mandating that the United States government take action against any country found to violate the religious freedoms outlined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Human Rights Council in 2011 adopted Resolution 16/18 on \"Combating intolerance, negative stereotyping and stigmatization of, and discrimination, incitement to violence and violence against, persons based on religion or belief\" which was hailed by stakeholders from all regions and faiths as a turning point in international efforts to confront religious intolerance. The European Convention on Human Rights, which is legally binding on all European Union states (following the passage of the Human Rights Act 1998 in the United Kingdom), makes restricting the rights of an individual to practice or change their religion illegal in article 9, and discrimination on the basis of religion illegal in article 14.\nIn North Korea, The regime reportedly continues to repress the religious activities of unauthorized religious groups. North Korea is considered an atheist state, where refugees, defectors and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) continued to allege that they witnessed the arrests and execution of members of underground Christian churches by the regime in prior years. Due to the country's inaccessibility and the inability to gain timely information, this activity remains difficult to verify.\nIn its 2000 annual report on international religious freedom, the U.S. State Department cited China, Myanmar, Iran, Iraq and Sudan for persecuting people for their religious faith and practices. The report, which covers July 1999 through June 2000, details U.S. policy toward countries where religious freedom is violated in the view of the State Department.\nThe advocacy group Freedom House produced a report entitled \"Religious Freedom in the World\" in 2000 which ranked countries according to their religious freedom. The countries receiving a score of 7, indicating those where religious freedom was least respected, were Turkmenistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Myanmar and North Korea. China was given a score of 6 overall, however Tibet was listed separately in the 7 category. Those countries receiving a score of 1, indicating the highest level of religious freedom, were Estonia, Finland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway and the United States.\nWithin those countries that openly advocate religious tolerance there remain debates as to the limits of tolerance. Some individuals and religious groups, for example, retain beliefs or practices which involve acts contrary to established law, such as the use of cannabis by members of the Rastafari movement, the religious use of eagle feathers by non-Native Americans (contrary to the eagle feather law, 50 CFR 22), or the practice of polygamy amongst the LDS Church in the 19th century.\nIn Australia.\nReligious freedom has developed partly due to the agreeable relationship between religious groups in its society. Several non-governmental organizations promoted tolerance and better understanding among religions in the country, both indigenous and non-indigenous. These groups included the Columbian Centre for Christian-Muslim Relations, the National Council of Churches in Australia and its affiliated Aboriginal and Islander Commission, and the Australian Council of Christians and Jews. In Victoria, Australia the Racial and Religious Tolerance Act 2001 makes illegal \"conduct that incites hatred against, serious contempt for, or revulsion or severe ridicule of, that other person or class of persons\" on the grounds of religious belief.\nIn 2003, in response to an increase in anti-Islamic sentiment, the HREOC undertook a project involving national consultations on eliminating prejudice against Arab and Muslim citizens. As part of the consultations, the commission considered whether Muslim citizens shared an ethnic origin or race, as well as a religion, which would entitle them to comprehensive protection under the Federal Race Discrimination Act. The commission's report, made public in June 2004, contained no findings on the racial status of Arab and Muslim citizens. In January 2005 the leader of the neo-Nazi Australian Nationalist Movement was connected to incidents in 2004 in which several Asian-owned businesses and a synagogue in Perth were firebombed or sprayed with racist graffiti. On December 11, 2005, there was a riot in the Sydney suburb of Cronulla, that erupted because a group of Lebanese-Australian youths had assaulted two lifeguards. Demonstrators against the assault displayed anti-Arab and anti-Muslim slogans. When the gathering turned violent, bystanders perceived to be of Middle Eastern origin or Muslim were attacked. The following day, retaliatory vandalism and other assaults were reported around Sydney.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is typically created by women for a female audience, distinguishing it from the equivalent genre of homoerotic media created by and for gay men, though BL does also attract a male audience and can be produced by male creators. BL spans a wide range of media, including manga, anime, drama CDs, novels, video games, television series, films, and fan works.\nThough depictions of homosexuality in Japanese media have a history dating to ancient times, contemporary BL traces its origins to male\u2013male romance manga that emerged in the 1970s, and which formed a new subgenre of \"sh\u014djo\" manga (comics for girls). Several terms were used for this genre, including , , and . The term ( ; ) emerged as a name for the genre in the late 1970s and early 1980s in the context of (self-published works) culture as a portmanteau of \"yama nashi, ochi nashi, imi nashi\" (\"no climax, no point, no meaning\"), where it was used in a self-deprecating manner to refer to amateur fan works that focused on sex to the exclusion of plot and character development, and that often parodied mainstream manga and anime by depicting male characters from popular series in sexual scenarios. \"Boys' love\" was later adopted by Japanese publications in the 1990s as an umbrella term for male\u2013male romance media marketed to women.\nConcepts and themes associated with BL include androgynous men known as \"bish\u014dnen\"; diminished female characters; narratives that emphasize homosociality and de-emphasize sociocultural homophobia; and depictions of rape. A defining characteristic of BL is the practice of pairing characters in relationships according to the roles of \"seme\", the sexual top or active pursuer, and \"uke\", the sexual bottom or passive pursued. BL has a robust global presence, having spread since the 1990s through international licensing and distribution, as well as through unlicensed circulation of works by BL fans online. BL works, culture, and fandom have been studied and discussed by scholars and journalists worldwide.\nEtymology and terminology.\nMultiple terms exist to describe Japanese and Japanese-influenced male\u2013male romance fiction as a genre. In a 2015 survey of professional Japanese male\u2013male romance fiction writers by Kazuko Suzuki, five primary subgenres were identified:\nWhile the term \"sh\u014dnen-ai\" historically connoted ephebophilia or pederasty, beginning in the 1970s it was used to describe a new genre of \"sh\u014djo\" manga (girls' manga) featuring romance between \"bish\u014dnen\" (lit. \"beautiful boys\"), a term for androgynous or effeminate male characters. Early \"sh\u014dnen-ai\" works were inspired by European literature, the writings of Taruho Inagaki, and the \"Bildungsroman\" genre. \"Sh\u014dnen-ai\" often features references to literature, history, science, and philosophy; Suzuki describes the genre as being \"pedantic\" and \"difficult to understand\", with \"philosophical and abstract musings\" that challenged young readers who were often only able to understand the references and deeper themes as they grew older.\n as a term and concept predates male\u2013male romance manga that emerged in the 1970s, having originated to describe erotic highbrow literary fiction by authors such as Yukio Mishima, Jun'ichir\u014d Tanizaki, and Yasunari Kawabata. By the 1980s, magazines aimed at fans were using the term to describe fiction by both amateur and professional writers published in those magazines, as well as to designate literature with themes of homoeroticism and implied homosexuality by authors such as Oscar Wilde, Jean Cocteau, Tatsuhiko Shibusawa, and Mishima. in this context is primarily used to describe prose fiction, but has also been used for manga and visual art.\nDerived from the eponymous male\u2013male romance manga magazine first published in 1978, the term was originally used to describe works that resembled the art style of manga published in that magazine. It has also been used to describe amateur works depicting male homosexuality that are original creations and not derivative works. By the 1990s, the term had largely fallen out of use in favor of \"boys' love\"; it has been suggested that publishers wishing to get a foothold in the \"June\" market coined \"boys' love\" to disassociate the genre from the publisher of \"June\".\nCoined in the late 1970s by manga artists Yasuko Sakata and Akiko Hatsu, \"yaoi\" is a portmanteau of , which translates to \"no climax, no point, no meaning\". Initially used by artists as a self-deprecating and ironic euphemism, the portmanteau refers to how early \"yaoi\" works typically focused on sex to the exclusion of plot and character development; it is also a subversive reference to the classical Japanese narrative structure of introduction, development, twist, and conclusion.\nTypically written as the acronym , or alternately as \"boy's love\" or \"boys love\", the term is a \"wasei-eigo\" construction derived from the literal English translation of \"sh\u014dnen-ai\". First used in 1991 by the magazine \"Image\" in an effort to collect these disparate genres under a single term, the term became widely popularized in 1994 after being used by the magazine \"Puff\". \"BL\" is the common term used to describe male\u2013male romance media marketed to women in Japan and much of Asia, though its usage in the West is inconsistent.\nDespite attempts by researchers to codify differences between these subgenres, in practice these terms are used interchangeably. Kazumi Nagaike and Tomoko Aoyama note that while BL and are the most common generic terms for this kind of media, they specifically avoid attempts at defining subgenres, noting that the differences between them are ill-defined and that even when differentiated, the subgenres \"remain thematically intertwined.\"\nIn Suzuki's investigation of these subgenres, she notes that \"there is no appropriate and convenient Japanese shorthand term to embrace all subgenres of male\u2013male love fiction by and for women.\" has been used as an umbrella term in the West for Japanese-influenced comics with male\u2013male relationships, and was preferentially used by American manga publishers for works of this kind due to the belief that the term \"boys' love\" carries the implication of pedophilia. In Japan, is used to denote \"d\u014djinshi\" and works that focus on sex scenes. In all usages, and boys' love excludes gay manga (\"bara\"), a genre which also depicts gay male sexual relationships, but is written for and mostly by gay men.\nIn the West, the term \"sh\u014dnen-ai\" is sometimes used to describe titles that focus on romance over explicit sexual content, while \"yaoi\" is used to describe titles that primarily feature sexually explicit themes and subject material. \"Yaoi\" can also be used by Western fans as a label for anime or manga-based slash fiction. The Japanese use of \"yaoi\" to denote only works with explicit scenes sometimes clashes with the Western use of the word to describe the genre as a whole, creating confusion between Japanese and Western audiences.\nHistory.\nBefore 1970: The origins of \"sh\u014dnen-ai\".\nHomosexuality and androgyny have a history in Japan dating to ancient times, as seen in practices such as and . The country shifted away from a tolerance of homosexuality amid Westernization during the Meiji Era (1868\u20131912), and moved towards hostile social attitudes towards homosexuality and the implementation of anti-sodomy laws.\nIn the face of this legal and cultural shift, artists who depicted male homosexuality in their work typically did so through subtext. Illustrations by Kash\u014d Takabatake in the \"sh\u014dnen\" manga (boys' comics) magazine \"Nihon Sh\u014dnen\" formed the foundation of what would become the aesthetic of \"bish\u014dnen\": boys and young men, often in homosocial or homoerotic contexts, who are defined by their \"ambivalent passivity, fragility, ephemerality, and softness.\" The 1961 novel \"A Lovers' Forest\" by \"tanbi\" writer Mari Mori, which follows the relationship between a professor and his younger male lover, is regarded as an influential precursor to the \"sh\u014dnen-ai\" genre. Mori's works were influenced by European literature, particularly Gothic literature, and laid the foundation for many of the common tropes of \"sh\u014dnen-ai\", , and BL: Western exoticism, educated and wealthy characters, significant age differences among couples, and fanciful or even surreal settings.\nIn manga, the concept of emerged in the late 1950s, which sought to use manga to tell serious and grounded stories aimed at adult audiences. \"Gekiga\" inspired the creation of manga that depicted realistic human relationships, and opened the way for manga that explored human sexuality in a non-pornographic context. Hideko Mizuno's 1969 \"sh\u014djo\" manga (girls' comics) series \"Fire!\" (1969\u20131971), which eroticized its male protagonists and depicted male homosexuality in American rock and roll culture, is noted as an influential work in this regard.\n1970s and 1980s: From \"sh\u014dnen-ai\" to \"yaoi\".\nContemporary Japanese homoerotic romance manga originated in the 1970s as a subgenre of \"sh\u014djo\" manga. The decade saw the arrival of a new generation of \"sh\u014djo\" manga artists, most notable among them the Year 24 Group. The Year 24 Group contributed significantly to the development of the \"sh\u014djo\" manga, introducing a greater diversity of themes and subject material to the genre that drew inspiration from Japanese and European literature, cinema, and history. Members of the group, including Keiko Takemiya and Moto Hagio, created works that depicted male homosexuality: \"In The Sunroom\" (1970) by Takemiya is considered the first work of the genre that would become known as \"sh\u014dnen-ai\", followed by Hagio's \"The November Gymnasium\" (1971).\nTakemiya, Hagio, Toshie Kihara, Ryoko Yamagishi, and Kaoru Kurimoto were among the most significant \"sh\u014dnen-ai\" artists of this era; notable works include \"The Heart of Thomas\" (1974\u20131975) by Hagio and \"Kaze to Ki no Uta\" (1976\u20131984) by Takemiya. Works by these artists typically featured tragic romances between androgynous \"bish\u014dnen\" in historic European settings. Though these works were nominally aimed at an audience of adolescent girls and young women, they also attracted adult gay and lesbian readers. During this same period, the first gay manga magazines were published: \"Barazoku\", the first commercially circulated gay men's magazine in Japan, was published in 1971, and served as a major influence on Takemiya and the development of \"sh\u014dnen-ai\".\nThe (self-published works) subculture emerged contemporaneously in the 1970s (see Media below), and in 1975, the first Comiket was held as a gathering of amateur artists who produce . The term \"yaoi\", initially used by some creators of male\u2013male romance to describe their creations ironically, emerged to describe amateur works that were influenced by and gay manga. Early \"yaoi\" produced for Comiket were typically derivative works, with glam rock artists such as David Bowie and Queen as popular subjects as a result of the influence of \"Fire!\"; \"yaoi\" were also more sexually explicit than \"sh\u014dnen-ai\".\nIn reaction to the success of \"sh\u014dnen-ai\" and early \"yaoi\", publishers sought to exploit the market by creating magazines devoted to the genre. Young female illustrators cemented themselves in the manga industry by publishing \"yaoi\" works, with this genre later becoming \"a transnational subculture.\" Publishing house Magazine Magazine, which published the gay manga magazine \"Sabu\", launched the magazine \"June\" in 1978, while Minori Shobo launched \"Allan\" in 1980. Both magazines initially specialized in \"sh\u014dnen-ai\", which Magazine Magazine described as \"halfway between \"tanbi\" literature and pornography,\" and also published articles on homosexuality, literary fiction, illustrations, and amateur \"yaoi\" works. The success of \"June\" was such that the term \"June-mono\" or more simply \"June\" began to compete with the term \"sh\u014dnen-ai\" to describe works depicting male homosexuality.\nBy the late 1980s, the popularity of professionally published \"sh\u014dnen-ai\" was declining, and \"yaoi\" published as \"d\u014djinshi\" was becoming more popular. Mainstream \"sh\u014dnen\" manga with Japanese settings, such as \"Captain Tsubasa\" became popular source material for derivative works by \"yaoi\" creators, and the genre increasingly depicted Japanese settings over Western settings. Works influenced by \"sh\u014dnen-ai\" in the 1980s began to depict older protagonists and adopted a realist style in both plot and artwork, as typified by manga such as \"Banana Fish\" (1985\u20131994) by Akimi Yoshida and \"Tomoi\" (1986) by Wakuni Akisato. The 1980s also saw the proliferation of \"yaoi\" into anime, drama CDs, and light novels; the 1982 anime adaptation of \"Patalliro!\" was the first television anime to depict \"sh\u014dnen-ai\" themes, while \"Kaze to Ki no Uta\" and \"Earthian\" were adapted into anime in the original video animation (home video) format in 1987 and 1989, respectively.\n1990s: Mainstream popularity and \"yaoi rons\u014d\".\nThe growing popularity of \"yaoi\" attracted the attention of manga magazine editors, many of whom recruited \"yaoi\" authors to their publications; \"Zetsuai 1989\" (1989\u20131991) by Minami Ozaki, a \"yaoi\" series published in the \"sh\u014djo\" magazine \"Margaret\", was originally a \"Captain Tsubasa\" created by Ozaki that she adapted into an original work. By 1990, seven Japanese publishers included \"yaoi\" content in their offerings, which kickstarted the commercial publishing market of the genre. Between 1990 and 1995, thirty magazines devoted to \"yaoi\" were established: \"Magazine Be \u00d7 Boy\", founded in 1993, became one of the most influential \"yaoi\" manga magazines of this era. The manga in these magazines were influenced by realist stories like \"Banana Fish\", and moved away from the \"sh\u014dnen-ai\" standards of the 1970s and 1980s. \"Sh\u014dnen-ai\" works that were published during this period were typically comedies rather than melodramas, such as \"Gravitation\" (1996\u20132002) by Maki Murakami. Consequently, \"yaoi\" and \"boys' love\" (BL) came to be the most popular terms to describe works depicting male\u2013male romance, eclipsing \"sh\u014dnen-ai\" and \"June\".\nAn increasing proportion of \"sh\u014djo\" manga in the 1990s began to integrate \"yaoi\" elements into their plots. The manga artist group Clamp, which itself began as a group creating \"yaoi\" , published multiple works containing \"yaoi\" elements during this period, such as \"RG Veda\" (1990\u20131995), \"Tokyo Babylon\" (1991\u20131994), and \"Cardcaptor Sakura\" (1996\u20132000). When these works were released in North America, they were among the first \"yaoi\"-influenced media to be encountered by Western audiences. BL gained popularity in mainland China in the late 1990s; the country subsequently outlawed the publishing and distribution of BL works.\nThe mid-1990s saw the so-called \"\"yaoi\" debate\" or \"yaoi rons\u014d\" (\u3084 \u304a \u3044 \u8ad6\u4e89), a debate held primarily in a series of essays published in the feminist magazine \"Choisir\" from 1992 to 1997. In an open letter, Japanese gay writer Masaki Sat\u014d criticized the genre as homophobic for not depicting gay men accurately, and called fans of \"yaoi\" \"disgusting women\" who \"have a perverse interest in sexual intercourse between men.\" A years-long debate ensued, with \"yaoi\" fans and artists contending that \"yaoi\" is entertainment for women that does not seek to be a realistic depiction of homosexuality, and instead serves as a refuge from the misogyny of Japanese society. The scholarly debate that the \"yaoi rons\u014d\" engendered led to the formation of the field of \"BL studies\", which focus on the study of BL and the relationship between women and BL. It additionally impacted creators of \"yaoi\": author Chiyo Kurihara abandoned \"yaoi\" to focus on heterosexual pornography as a result of the \"yaoi rons\u014d\", while Hisako Takamatsu took into account the arguments of the genre's critics to create works more accommodating of a gay audience.\n2000s\u2013present: Globalization of \"yaoi\" and BL.\nThe economic crisis caused by the Lost Decade came to affect the manga industry in the late 1990s and early 2000s, but did not particularly impact the \"yaoi\" market; on the contrary, \"yaoi\" magazines continued to proliferate during this period, and sales of \"yaoi\" media increased. In 2004, Otome Road in Ikebukuro emerged as a major cultural destination for \"yaoi\" fandom, with multiple stores dedicated to \"sh\u014djo\" and \"yaoi\" goods. The 2000s also saw an increase in male readers of \"yaoi\", with a 2008 bookstore survey finding that between 25\u201330% of \"yaoi\" readers were male.\nThe 2000s saw significant growth of \"yaoi\" in international markets, beginning with the founding of the American anime convention Yaoi-Con in 2001. The first officially licensed English-language translations of \"yaoi\" manga were published in the North American market in 2003 (see Media below); the market expanded rapidly before contracting in 2008 as a result of the 2008 financial crisis, but continued to grow slowly in the following years. South Korea saw the development of BL in the form of \"manhwa\", notably \"Martin and John\" (2006) by Park Hee-jung and \"Crush on You\" (2006) by Lee Kyung-ha.\nThe 2010s and 2020s saw an increase in the popularity of \"yaoi\" and BL media in China and Thailand in the form of web novels, live-action films, and live-action television dramas (see Media below). Though \"boys' love\" and \"BL\" have become the generic terms for this material across Asia, in Thailand, BL dramas are sometimes referred to as \"Y\" or \"Y series\" as a shorthand for \"yaoi\". Thai Series Y explicitly adapts the content of Japanese BL to the Thai local context and in recent years has become increasingly popular with fans around the world who often view Thai BL as separate to its Japanese antecedents. Thai BL also deliberately borrows from K-pop celebrity culture in the development of its own style of idols known as \"khu jin\" (imaginary couples) who are designed to be paired together by Thai BL's predominantly female fans. For cultural anthropologist Thomas Baudinette, BL series produced in Thailand represent the next stage in the historic development of BL, which is increasingly becoming \"dislocated\" from Japan among international fans' understanding of the genre.\nWhile BL fandom in China traces back to the late 1990s as \"danmei\" (the Mandarin reading of the Japanese term \"tanbi\"), state regulations in China made it difficult for \"danmei\" writers to publish their works online, with a 2009 ordinance by the National Publishing Administration of China banning most \"danmei\" online fiction. In 2015, laws prohibiting depictions of same-sex relationships in television and film were implemented in China. The growth in streaming service providers in the 2010s is regarded as a driving force behind the production of BL dramas across Asia, as online distribution provides a platform for media containing non-heterosexual material, which is frequently not permitted on broadcast television.\nConcepts and themes.\n\"Bish\u014dnen\".\nThe protagonists of BL are often , \"highly idealised\" boys and young men who blend both masculine and feminine qualities. \"Bish\u014dnen\" as a concept can be found disparately throughout East Asia, but its specific aesthetic manifestation in 1970s \"sh\u014djo\" manga (and subsequently in manga) drew influence from popular culture of the era, including glam rock artists such as David Bowie, actor Bj\u00f6rn Andr\u00e9sen's portrayal of Tadzio in the 1971 film adaptation of \"Death in Venice\", and kabuki \"onnagata\" Band\u014d Tamasabur\u014d. Though \"bish\u014dnen\" are not exclusive to BL, the androgyny of \"bish\u014dnen\" is often exploited to explore notions of sexuality and gender in BL works.\nThe late 2010s saw the increasing popularity of masculine men in BL that are reminiscent of the body types typical in gay manga, with growing emphasis on stories featuring muscular bodies and older characters. A 2017 survey by BL publisher Jun\u00e9 Manga found that while over 80% of their readership previously preferred \"bish\u014dnen\" body types exclusively, 65% now enjoy both \"bish\u014dnen\" and muscular body types. Critics and commentators have noted that this shift in preferences among BL readers, and subsequent creation of works that feature characteristics of both BL and gay manga represents a blurring of the distinctions between the genres; anthropologist Thomas Baudinette notes in his fieldwork that gay men in Japan \"saw no need to sharply disassociate BL from [gay manga] when discussing their consumption of 'gay media'.\"\n\"Seme\" and \"uke\".\nThe two participants in a BL relationship (and to a lesser extent in \"yuri\") are often referred to as and . These terms originated in martial arts, and were later appropriated as Japanese LGBT slang to refer to the insertive and receptive partners in anal sex. Aleardo Zanghellini suggests that the martial arts terms have special significance to a Japanese audience, as an archetype of the gay male relationship in Japan includes same-sex love between samurai and their companions. He suggests that the samurai archetype is responsible for age differences and hierarchical variations in power of some relationships portrayed in BL.\nThe \"seme\" is often depicted as restrained, physically powerful, and protective; he is generally older and taller, with a stronger chin, shorter hair, smaller eyes, and a more stereotypically masculine and \"macho\" demeanour than the \"uke\". The \"seme\" usually pursues the \"uke\", who often has softer, androgynous, feminine features with bigger eyes and a smaller build, and is often physically weaker than the \"seme\". The roles of \"seme\" and \"uke\" can alternatively be established by who is dominant in the relationship; a character can take the \"uke\" role even if he is not presented as feminine, simply by being juxtaposed against and pursued by a more dominant and masculine character. Anal sex is ubiquitous in BL, and is typically rendered explicitly and not merely implied; Zanghellini notes that illustrations of anal sex almost always position the characters to face each other rather than \"doggy style\", and that the \"uke\" rarely fellates the \"seme\", but instead receives the sexual and romantic attentions of the \"seme\".\nThough McLelland notes that authors are typically \"interested in exploring, not repudiating\" the dynamics between the \"seme\" and \"uke\", not all works adhere to \"seme\" and \"uke\" tropes. The possibility of switching roles is often a source of playful teasing and sexual excitement for the characters, indicating an interest among many genre authors in exploring the performative nature of the roles. , a shorthand for \"reversible\" (\u30ea\u30d0\u30fc\u30b7\u30d6\u30eb), is used to describe couples where the \"seme\" and \"uke\" roles are not strictly defined. Occasionally, authors will forego the stylisations of the \"seme\" and \"uke\" to portray both lovers as \"equally attractive handsome men\", or will subvert expectations of dominance by depicting the active pursuer in the relationship as taking the passive role during sex. In other cases, the \"uke\" is presented as more sexually aggressive than the \"seme\"; in these instances, the roles are sometimes referred to as and .\nDiminished female characters.\nHistorically, female characters had minor roles in BL, or were absent altogether. Suzuki notes that mothers in particular are often portrayed in a negative light; she suggests this is because the character and reader alike are seeking to substitute the absence of unconditional maternal love with the \"forbidden\" all-consuming love presented in BL. In parodies based on existing works that include female characters, the female's role is typically either minimized or the character is killed off; Yukari Fujimoto noted that in these parodies, \"it seems that \"yaoi\" readings and likeable female characters are mutually exclusive.\" Nariko Enomoto, a BL author, suggests that women are typically not depicted in BL as their presence adds an element of realism that distracts from a fantasy narrative.\nSince the late 2000s, women have appeared more frequently in BL works as supporting characters. Lunsing notes that early \"sh\u014dnen-ai\" and \"yaoi\" were often regarded as misogynistic, with the diminished role of female characters cited as evidence of the internalized misogyny of the genre's largely female readership. He suggests that the decline of these misogynistic representations over time is evidence that authors and readers \"overcame this hate, possibly thanks to their involvement with .\"\nGay equality.\nBL stories are often strongly homosocial, giving men freedom to bond and pursue shared goals together (as in \"dojinshi\" adaptations of \"sh\u014dnen\" manga), or to rival each other (as in \"Embracing Love\"). This spiritual bond and equal partnership is depicted as overcoming the male\u2013female gender hierarchy. As is typical in romance fiction, couples depicted in these stories often must overcome obstacles that are emotional or psychological rather than physical. Akiko Mizoguchi notes that while early stories depicted homosexuality as a source of shame to heighten dramatic tension in this regard, beginning in the mid-2000s the genre began to depict gay identity with greater sensitivity and nuance, with series such as \"Brilliant Blue\" featuring stories of coming out and the characters' gradual acceptance within the wider community. BL typically depicts Japanese society as more accepting of LGBT people than it is in reality, which Mizoguchi contends is a form of activism among BL authors. Some longer-form stories such as \"Fake\" and \"\" have the couple form a family unit, depicting them cohabiting and adopting children. It is also possible that they marry and have children, as in Omegaverse publications. Fujimoto cites \"Ossan's Love\" (2016\u20132018) and other BL television dramas that emerged in the 2010s as a \"'missing link' to bridge the gap between BL fiction and gay people,\" arguing that when BL narratives are presented using human actors, it produces a \"subconscious change in the perception of viewers\" towards acceptance of homosexuality.\nAlthough gay male characters are empowered in BL, the genre frequently does not address the reality of sociocultural homophobia. According to Hisako Miyoshi, vice editor-in-chief for Libre Publishing, while earlier works in the genre focused \"more on the homosexual way of life from a realistic perspective\", over time the genre has become less realistic and more comedic, and the stories are \"simply for entertainment\". BL manga often have fantastical, historical or futuristic settings, and many fans consider the genre to be escapist fiction. Homophobia, when it is presented as an issue at all, is used as a plot device to heighten drama, or to show the purity of the leads' love. Rachel Thorn has suggested that as BL is primarily a romance genre, its readers may be turned off by political themes such as homophobia. BL author Makoto Tateno expressed skepticism that realistic depictions of gay men's lives would become common in BL \"because girls like fiction more than realism\". Alan Williams argues that the lack of a gay identity in BL is due to BL being postmodern, stating that \"a common utterance in the genre\u2014when a character claims that he is 'not gay, but just in love with a man'\u2014has both homophobic (or modern) temporal undertones but also non-identitarian (postmodern) ones.\" In 2019, BL manga magazine editors stated that stories where a man is concerned about coming out as gay have become uncommon and the trope can be seen as outdated if used as a source of conflict between the characters.\nRape.\nEroticized depictions of rape are often associated with BL. Anal sex is understood as a means of expressing commitment to a partner, and in BL, the \"apparent violence\" of rape is transformed into a \"measure of passion\". Rape scenes in BL are rarely presented as crimes with an assaulter and a victim: scenes where a \"seme\" rapes an \"uke\" are not depicted as symptomatic of the violent desires of the \"seme\", but rather as evidence of the uncontrollable attraction felt by the \"seme\" towards the \"uke\". Such scenes are often a plot device used to make the \"uke\" see the \"seme\" as more than just a good friend, and typically result in the \"uke\" falling in love with the \"seme\".\nWhile Japanese society often shuns or looks down upon women who are raped in reality, the BL genre depicts men who are raped as still \"imbued with innocence\" and are typically still loved by their rapists after the act, a trope that may have originated with \"Kaze to Ki no Uta\". Kristy Valenti of \"The Comics Journal\" notes that rape narratives typically focus on how \"irresistible\" the \"uke\" is and how the \"seme\" \"cannot control himself\" in his presence, thus absolving the \"seme\" of responsibility for his rape of the \"uke\". She notes this is likely why the narrative climax of many BL stories depicts the \"seme\" recognizing, and taking responsibility for, his sexual desires. Where the \"uke\" is raped by a third party, the relationship is shown to be emotionally supportive. Conversely, some stories such as \"Under Grand Hotel\" subvert the rape fantasy trope entirely by presenting rape as a negative and traumatic act.\nA 2012 survey of English-language BL fans found that just 15% of respondents reported that the presence of rape in BL media made them uncomfortable, as the majority of respondents could distinguish between the \"fantasy, genre-driven rape\" of BL and rape as a crime in reality. This \"surprisingly high tolerance\" for depictions of rape is contextualized by a content analysis, which found that just 13% of all original Japanese BL available commercially in English contains depictions of rape. These findings are argued as \"possibly belying the perception that rape is almost ubiquitous in BL/\"yaoi\".\"\nTragedy.\nTragic narratives that focused on the suffering of the protagonists were popular early \"June\" stories, particularly stories that ended in one or both members of the central couple dying from suicide. By the mid-1990s, happy endings were more common; when tragic endings are shown, the cause is typically not an interpersonal conflict between the couple, but \"the cruel and intrusive demands of an uncompromising outside world\". Thorn theorizes that depictions of tragedy and abuse in BL exist to allow the audience \"to come to terms in some way with their own experiences of abuse.\"\nSubgenres and related genres.\n, also known as or is a genre focused on male same-sex love, as created primarily by gay men for a gay male audience. Gay manga typically focuses on masculine men with varying degrees of muscle, body fat, and body hair, in contrast to the androgynous \"bish\u014dnen\" of BL. Graham Kolbeins writes in \"\" that while BL can be understood as a primarily feminist phenomenon, in that it depicts sex that is free of the patriarchal trappings of heterosexual pornography, gay manga is primarily an expression of gay male identity. The early 2000s saw a degree of overlap between BL and gay manga in BDSM-themed publications: the BDSM anthology magazine had several male contributors, while several female BL authors have contributed stories to BDSM-themed gay manga anthologies or special issues, occasionally under male pen names.\n is a genre that depicts prepubescent or pubescent boys in a romantic or pornographic context. Originating as an offshoot of in the early 1980s, the subgenre was later adopted by male readers and became influenced by \"lolicon\" (works depicting prepubescent or pubescent girls); the conflation of \"shotacon\" in its contemporary usage with BL is thus not universally accepted, as the genre constitutes material that marketed to both male and female audiences.\nOmegaverse is a male\u2013male romance subgenre that originated from the American series \"Supernatural\" and in the 2010s became a subgenre of both commercial and non-commercial BL. Stories in the genre are premised on societies wherein humans are divided into a dominance hierarchy of dominant \"alphas\", neutral \"betas\", and submissive \"omegas\". These terms are derived from those used in ethology to describe social hierarchies in animals.\nThe \"dom/sub universe\" subgenre emerged in 2017 and gained popularity in 2021. The subgenre uses BDSM elements and also draws influences from Omegaverse, particularly the use of a caste system.\nMedia.\nIn 2003, 3.8% of weekly Japanese manga magazines were dedicated exclusively to BL. Notable ongoing and defunct magazines include \"Magazine Be \u00d7 Boy\", \"June\", \"Craft\", \"Chara\", \"Dear+\", \"Opera\", 'Ciel', and \"Gush\". Several of these magazines were established as companion publications to \"sh\u014djo\" manga magazines, as they include material considered too explicit for an all-ages audience; \"Ciel\" was established as a companion to \"Monthly Asuka\", while \"Dear+\" was established as a companion to \"Wings\". A 2008 assessment estimated that the Japanese commercial BL market grossed approximately \u00a5 annually, with novel sales generating \u00a5 per month, manga generating \u00a5 per month, CDs generating \u00a5 per month, and video games generating \u00a5 per month. A 2010 report estimated that the Japanese BL market was worth approximately \u00a5 in both 2009 and 2010. In 2019, editors from \"Lynx\", \"Magazine Be \u00d7 Boy\", and \"On BLUE\" stated that, with the growth of BL artists in Taiwan and South Korea, they have recruited and published several of their works in Japan with expectations that the BL manga industry will diversify.\nFan works ().\nThe (self-published fan works) subculture emerged in the 1970s contemporaneously with BL subculture and Western fan fiction culture. Characteristic similarities of fan works in both Japan and the West include non-adherence to a standard narrative structures and a particular popularity of science fiction themes. Early BL \"d\u014djinshi\" were amateur publications that were not controlled by media restrictions, were typically derivative works based on existing manga and anime, and were often written by teenagers for an adolescent audience. Several legitimate manga artists produce or produced \"d\u014djinshi\": the manga artist group Clamp began as an amateur \"d\u014djinshi\" circle creating works based on \"Saint Seiya\", while Kodaka Kazuma and Fumi Yoshinaga have produced \"d\u014djinshi\" concurrently with professionally published works. Many publishing companies review BL \"d\u014djinshi\" to recruit talented amateurs; this practice has led to careers in mainstream manga for Youka Nitta, Shungiku Nakamura, and others.\nTypically, BL \"d\u014djinshi\" feature male\u2013male pairings from non-romantic manga and anime. Much of the material derives from male-oriented \"sh\u014dnen\" and \"seinen\" works, which contain close male\u2013male friendships perceived by fans to imply elements of homoeroticism, such as with \"Captain Tsubasa\" and \"Saint Seiya\", two titles which popularised in the 1980s. \"Weekly Shonen Jump\" is known to have a large female readership who engage in BL readings; publishers of \"sh\u014dnen\" manga may create \"homoerotic-themed\" merchandise as fan service to their BL fans. BL fans may \"ship\" any male\u2013male pairing, sometimes pairing off a favourite character, or create a story about two original male characters and incorporate established characters into the story. Any male character may become the subject of a BL \"d\u014djinshi\", including characters from non-manga titles such as \"The Lord of the Rings\", video games such as \"Final Fantasy\", or real people such as actors and politicians. Amateur authors may also create characters out of personifications of abstract concepts (as in the personification of countries in \"\") or complementary objects like salt and pepper. In Japan, the labelling of BL \"d\u014djinshi\" is typically composed of the two lead characters' names, separated by a multiplication sign, with the \"seme\" being first and the \"uke\" being second.\nOutside of Japan, the 2000 broadcast of \"Mobile Suit Gundam Wing\" in North America on Cartoon Network is noted as crucial to the development of Western BL fan works, particularly fan fiction. As BL fan fiction is often compared to the Western fan practice of slash, it is important to understand the subtle differences between them. Levi notes that \"the youthful teen look that so easily translates into androgyny in boys' love manga, and allows for so many layered interpretations of sex and gender, is much harder for slash writers to achieve.\"\nEnglish-language publishing.\nThe first officially licensed English-language translations of manga were published in the North American market in 2003. By 2006, there were roughly 130 English-translated works commercially available, and by 2007, over 10 publishers in North America published . Notable English-language publishers of BL include Viz Media under their SuBLime imprint, Digital Manga Publishing under their 801 Media and Jun\u00e9 imprints, Media Blasters under their Kitty Media imprint, Seven Seas Entertainment, and Tokyopop. Notable defunct English-language publishers of BL include Central Park Media under their Be Beautiful imprint, Broccoli under their Boysenberry imprint, and Aurora Publishing under their Deux Press imprint.\nAmong the 135 manga published in North America between 2003 and 2006, 14% were rated for readers aged 13 years or over, 39% were rated for readers aged 15 or older, and 47% were rated for readers age 18 and up. Restrictions among American booksellers often led publishers to label books conservatively, often rating books originally intended for a mid-teen readership as 18+ and distributing them in shrinkwrap. Diamond Comic Distributors valued the sales of manga in the United States at approximately US$6 million in 2007.\nMarketing was significant in the transnational travel of BL from Japan to the United States, and led to BL to attract a following of LGBTQ fans in the United States. The 1994 original video animation adaptation of \"\" was distributed by Ariztical Entertainment, which specializes in LGBT cinema and marketed the title as \"the first gay male anime to be released on DVD in the US.\" The film was reviewed in the American LGBT magazine \"The Advocate\", which compared the film to gay art house cinema.\nA large portion of Western fans choose to pirate BL material because they are unable or unwilling to obtain it through sanctioned methods. Scanlations and other fan translation efforts of both commercially published Japanese works and amateur \"dojinshi\" are common.\nOriginal English-language.\nWhen initially gained popularity in the United States in the early 2000s, several American artists began creating original English-language manga for female readers featuring male\u2013male couples referred to as \"American \". The first known commercially published original English-language comic is \"Sexual Espionage #1\" by Daria McGrain, published by Sin Factory in May 2002. As international artists began creating works, the term \"American \" fell out of use and was replaced by terms like \"original English language \", \"global \", and \"global BL\". The majority of publishers creating original English-language manga are now defunct, including Yaoi Press, DramaQueen, and Iris Print. Digital Manga Publishing last published original English-language manga in 2012; outside of the United States, German publisher Carlsen Manga also published original works.\nAudio dramas.\nBL audio dramas, occasionally referred to as \"drama CDs\", \"sound dramas\", or \"BLCDs\", are recorded voice performances of male\u2013male romance scenarios performed by primarily male voice actors. They are typically adaptations of original BL manga and novels. The first BL audio dramas were released in the 1980s, beginning with \"Tsuzumigafuchi\" in 1988, which was published as a \"\"June\" cassette\". BL audio dramas proliferated beginning in the 1990s with the rise in popularity of compact discs, peaking at 289 total CDs released in 2008, which dropped to 108 CDs in 2013.\nLive-action television and film.\nJapan.\nWhile Japanese BL manga has been adapted into live-action films and television dramas since the early 2000s, these works were marketed towards a niche audience of BL fans rather than towards a general audience. When these works were adapted for a general audience, same-sex romance elements were typically downplayed or removed entirely, as in the live-action television adaption of \"Antique Bakery\" that aired on Fuji TV in 2001. The development of Japanese live-action television dramas that focus on BL and same-sex romance themes explicitly was spurred by the critical and commercial success of the TV Asahi television drama \"Ossan's Love\" (2016), which features an all-male love triangle as its central plot conceit. While \"Ossan's Love\" is an original series, it influenced the creation of live-action BL works adapted from manga that are marketed towards mass audiences; notable examples include the television dramas \"The Novelist\" (2018) on Fuji TV, \"What Did You Eat Yesterday?\" (2019) on TV Tokyo, \"Cherry Magic\" (2020) on TV Tokyo, and the live-action film adaptation of \"The Cornered Mouse Dreams of Cheese\" (2020).\nIn 2020, the BL market was worth US$ in Japan. In 2022, Kadokawa Corporation employee Kaoru Azuma established Tunku, Kadokawa's label for publishing live-action BL drama series, partnering with MBS TV to create the programming block Drama Shower. The label was created to promote Japanese BL dramas based on existing BL novels and manga due to the growing popularity of BL caused by \"Ossan's Love\". While creating Tunku, Azuma stated that she noticed that prejudice against boys' love has dwindled, and that many people have seemed to accept the genre as \"normal\".\nThailand.\nThe Thai romantic drama film \"Love of Siam\" (2007), which features a gay male romance storyline, found unexpected mainstream success upon its release and grossed over TH\u0e3f40 million at the box office. This was followed by \"Love Sick\" (2014\u20132015), the first Thai television series to feature two gay characters as the lead roles. Cultural anthropologist Thomas Baudinette argues that \"Love Sick\" represented a \"watershed moment\" in the depiction of queer romance in Thai media, exploring how the series adapted tropes from Japanese BL to create a new genre of media. While Japanese BL manga attracted an audience in Thailand as early as the 1990s, the success of \"Love of Siam\" and \"Love Sick\" kickstarted the production of domestic BL dramas: between 2014 and 2020, 57 television series in the BL genre were produced and released in Thailand.\nMajor producers of Thai BL include GMMTV, a subsidiary of GMM Grammy, which has produced \"2gether: The Series\" (2020), \"A Tale of Thousand Stars\" (2021), \"SOTUS\" (2016\u20132017), \"Dark Blue Kiss\" (2019), and \"Theory of Love\" (2019); and Line Corporation, which produces BL dramas in Thailand for distribution on its Line TV platform. The genre has seen some backlash from conservative elements in Thai society: in 2020, the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission introduced new guidelines around material containing \"sexually explicit or suggestive\" scenes, while public broadcaster MCOT cancelled the BL series \"Love by Chance\" in 2018. Thai BL dramas are noted as having gained popularity in Indonesia, where LGBT representation in domestic television is less common; as well as in the Philippines, where many fans view BL as an originally Thai form of popular culture. The coming-of-age BL series, \"I Told Sunset About You\" (2020) was awarded by the Seoul International Drama Awards as the International Drama of the Year in 2021. It has been suggested that BL dramas could become a source of Thai cultural soft power in Southeast Asia and beyond.\nChina.\nThere are no specific censorship policies in China concerning depictions of LGBT subject material in media; nevertheless, \"Variety\" reports that such material is \"deemed sensitive and is inconsistently but regularly removed\" from distribution. \"Addicted\" (2016), the first Chinese BL web series, accumulated 10 million views before being pulled from the streaming platform iQiyi. In reaction to state censorship, Chinese BL works typically depict male\u2013male romance as homoerotic subtext: the web novel \"Guardian\" (2012) depicted a romance between its two male lead characters, though when it was adapted into a television drama on the streaming platform Youku in 2018, the relationship was rendered as a close, homoerotic friendship. The 2015 BL \"xianxia\" novel \"Grandmaster of Demonic Cultivation\" was adapted into an animated series in 2018 and a live-action series in 2019, both of which similarly revise the nature of the relationship between the lead male characters. Consequently, fans of both \"Guardian\" and \"The Untamed\" discussed the series' male homoerotic content under the hashtag \"socialist brotherhood\" or \"socialist bromance\" to avoid detection from state censors.\nOther countries.\nIn South Korea, the web series \"Where Your Eyes Linger\" launched as the first domestically produced BL series in 2020. The BL genre didn't receive much traction in the country until 2022, when the series \"Semantic Error\" achieved a major domestic success and became a social phenomenon in South Korea. The unexpected success of the series introduced the BL genre to the mainstream South Korean audience, which subsequently resulted in a rising production of South Korean BL dramas and films.\nIn Taiwan, the BL anthology series \"HIStory\" premiered in 2017.\nIn the Philippines, BL television dramas gained popularity through the broadcast of foreign BL dramas such as \"2gether\" and \"Where Your Eyes Linger\". This spurred the creation of domestically produced BL dramas, such as \"Gameboys\" (2020), \"Hello Stranger\" (2020), and \"Oh, Mando!\" (2020); the 2020 film \"The Boy Foretold by the Stars\" billed itself as \"the first Filipino BL movie\".\nVideo games.\nBL video games typically consist of visual novels or \"eroge\" oriented around male\u2013male couples. The first BL game to receive an officially licensed English-language release was \"\", published by JAST USA in 2006. That same year, the company published \"Absolute Obedience\", while Hirameki International licensed \"Animamundi\"; the later game, although already nonexplicit, was censored for US release to achieve a \"mature\" rather than \"adults only\" ESRB rating, removing some of both the sexual and the violent content. Compared to BL manga, fewer BL games have been officially translated into English; the lack of interest by publishers in licensing further titles has been attributed to widespread copyright infringement of both licensed and unlicensed games.\nDemography.\nSuzuki notes that \"demographic analyses of BL media are underdeveloped and thus much needed in \"yaoi\"/BL studies,\" but acknowledges that \"the overwhelming majority of BL readers are women.\" 80% of the BL audience is female, while the membership of Yaoi-Con, a now-defunct American convention, was 85% female. It is usually assumed that all female fans are heterosexual, but in Japan there is a presence of lesbian manga authors and lesbian, bisexual or questioning female readers. A 2008 survey of English-speaking readers of BL indicated that 50%\u201360% of female readers self-identify as heterosexual.\nAlthough the genre is marketed to and consumed primarily by girls and women, there is a gay, bisexual, and heterosexual male readership as well. A 2007 survey of BL readers among patrons of a United States library found about one quarter of respondents were male; two online surveys found approximately 10% of the broader English-speaking BL readership were male. Lunsing suggests that younger Japanese gay men who are offended by \"pornographic\" content in gay men's magazines may prefer to read BL instead. Some gay men, however, are put off by the feminine art style or unrealistic depictions of LGBT culture in Japan and instead prefer gay manga, which some perceive to be more realistic. Lunsing notes that some of the BL narrative elements criticized by homosexual men, such as rape fantasies, misogyny, and characters' non-identification as gay, are also present in gay manga.\nIn the mid-1990s, estimates of the size of the Japanese BL fandom ranged from 100,000 to 500,000 people. By April 2005, a search for non-Japanese websites resulted in 785,000 English, 49,000 Spanish, 22,400 Korean, 11,900 Italian, and 6,900 Chinese sites. In January 2007, there were approximately five million hits for .\nFemale fans of BL are often referred to as , a derogatory insult that was later reappropriated as a self-descriptive term. The male equivalent is or , both of which are puns of similar construction to \"fujoshi\".\nAnalysis.\nAudience motivation.\nThe motivations for consuming BL media include liberation from heteropatriarchy, idealised portrayal of relationships, 'pure' love without gender and pro-homosexual attitude, identification/self-analysis, melodramatic/emotional elements, aversion to standard romances/\"shoujo\", a romantic/erotic genre aimed at women, pure escapism/unrealistic, art and aesthetics, pure entertainment, exciting/sexually titillating.\nBL works, culture, and fandom have been studied and discussed by scholars and journalists worldwide, especially after translations of BL became commercially available outside Japan in the 21st century. In \"Manga! Manga! The World of Japanese Comics\", the 1983 book by Frederik L. Schodt that was the first substantial English-language work on manga, Schodt observes that portrayals of gay male relationships had used and further developed bisexual themes already extant in manga to appeal to their female audience. Japanese critics have viewed BL as a genre that permits their audience to avoid adult female sexuality by distancing sex from their own bodies, as well as to create fluidity in perceptions of gender and sexuality and rejects \"socially mandated\" gender roles as a \"first step toward feminism\". Kazuko Suzuki, for example, believes that the audience's aversion to or contempt for masculine heterosexism is something which has consciously emerged as a result of the genre's popularity.\nMizoguchi, writing in 2003, feels that BL is a \"female-gendered space\", as the writers, readers, artists and most of the editors of BL are female. BL has been compared to romance novels by English-speaking librarians. In 2004, Paul Gravett summarized the dominant theories for the popularity of BL with a female audience: that Japanese women were disillusioned or bored with classic male\u2013female relationships in fiction, that the populating the genre were a backlash against male sex fantasies of a feminized ideal of adolescent girls, that the genre offered a safe space for sexual fantasies with the free choice of identification figure in the relationship, and that the male characters in BL are interpreted by female readers as girls, thus making the stories expressions of readers' same-sex fantasies.\nOther commentators have suggested that more radical gender-political issues underlie BL. Parallels have been noted in the popularity of lesbianism in pornography, and BL has been called a form of \"female fetishism\". While early approaches to the popularity of the genre often referred to the role of women in patriarchal Japanese society, to which the genre offers a resistance and escape, this approach has been rejected by others who note that BL and BL-like media became popular outside of Japan in other social circumstances, such as slash fiction in the West. Against this background, theories emphasizing pleasure gained support: BL could be compared to pornography or even considered a specifically female form of pornography, appealing to desires for eroticism, voyeurism, or a desire to push against established gender roles. Mariko \u014chara, a science fiction writer, has said that she wrote Kirk/Spock fiction as a teen because she could not enjoy \"conventional pornography, which had been made for men\", and that she had found a \"limitless freedom\" in BL, much like in science fiction.\nIn 1998, Shihomi Sakakibara asserted that fans, including himself, were gay transgender men. Sandra Buckley believes that \"bish\u014dnen\" narratives champion \"the imagined potentialities of alternative [gender] differentiations\", while James Welker described the \"bish\u014dnen\" character as \"queer\", commenting that manga critic Akiko Mizoguchi saw \"sh\u014dnen-ai\" as playing a role in how she herself had become a lesbian. Dru Pagliassotti sees this and the \"yaoi rons\u014d\" as indicating that for Japanese gay and lesbian readers, BL is not as far removed from reality as heterosexual female readers like to claim. Welker has also written that boys' love titles liberate the female audience \"not just from patriarchy, but from gender dualism and heteronormativity\".\nCriticism.\nSome gay and lesbian commentators have criticized how gay identity is portrayed in BL, most notably in the or \" debate\" of 1992\u20131997 (see above). A trope of BL that has attracted criticism is male protagonists who do not identify as gay, but are rather simply in love with each other, with Comiket co-founder Yoshihiro Yonezawa once describing BL \"d\u014djinshi\" as akin to \"girls playing with dolls\". This is said to heighten the theme of all-conquering love, but is also condemned as a means of avoiding acknowledgement of homophobia. Criticism of the stereotypically feminine behaviour of the \"uke\" has also been prominent.\nMuch of the criticism of BL originally rendered in the has similarly been voiced in the English-language fandom. Rachel Thorn has suggested that BL and slash fiction fans are discontented with \"the standards of femininity to which they are expected to adhere and a social environment that does not validate or sympathize with that discontent\".\nLegal issues.\nBL has been the subject of disputes on legal and moral grounds. Mark McLelland suggests that BL may become \"a major battlefront for proponents and detractors of 'gender free' policies in employment, education and elsewhere\", while BL artist Youka Nitta has said that \"even in Japan, reading boys' love isn't something that parents encourage.\" In Thailand, the sale of unauthorized reproductions of \"sh\u014dnen-ai\" manga to teenagers in 2001 led to media coverage and a moral panic. In 2006, an email campaign pressuring the Sakai City Central Library to remove BL works from circulation attracted national media attention, and promoted a debate over whether removal of BL works constituted a form of discrimination. In 2010, the Osaka Prefectural Government included boys' love manga among other books deemed potentially \"harmful to minors\" due to its sexual content, which resulted in several magazines prohibited from being sold to people under 18 years of age.\nIn the People's Republic of China under the general secretaryship of Xi Jinping, authors of \"danmei\" have been arrested and criminally prosecuted. Anhui TV reported that, at least 20 young female authors writing \"danmei\" novels on an online novel website were arrested in 2014. In 2018, the pseudonymous Chinese BL novel author Tianyi was sentenced to &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;10+1\u20442 years in prison under laws prohibiting the production of \"obscene material for profit\". Hu, Ge and Wang summarise the trajectory of censorship over \"danmei\" from 2004 to the present, and suggest that the Chinese party-state has endeavored to boost a discourse as regard \"danmei\" hatred in particular since 2021 as exemplified in the ban of \"danmei\"-adapted web dramas and media representation of male effeminacy in September 2021. Zanghellini notes that due to the \"characteristics of the /BL genre\" of showing characters who are often underage engaging in romantic and sexual situations, child pornography laws in Australia and Canada \"may lend themselves to targeting /BL work\". He notes that in the UK, cartoons are exempt from child pornography laws unless they are used for child grooming.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"}

{"id": "54950", "revid": "1312060133", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54950", "title": "Il Capitano", "text": "Stock fictional character in commedia dell'arte\nIl Capitano (; lit.\u2009'the Captain') is one of the four stock characters of commedia dell'arte. He most probably was never a \"Captain\", but rather appropriated the name for himself. \nIts genesis dates back to the Pyrgopolinices of Titus Maccio Plautus' Miles gloriosus and to Terence's Thrason of the Eunuch. He was reborn in various forms in the Italian theater of the Renaissance. He usually personified the vainglorious soldier. He could boast of titles he did not possess or of feats he had never accomplished. In the most negative versions he actually poorly concealed the terror of having to face a battle or a duel. However, the Captains could also have positive characteristics, as dreamers with noble feelings.\nA captain portrayed in a more positive way is Francesco Andreini's \"Captain Spaventa\", capable of noble feelings, almost a dreamer. Another captain, portrayed as a laughing stock pitted against the Moors, is \"Captain Matamoros\" by Silvio Fiorillo; he had the clothing of the Spanish soldiers of the time, enriched however with trinkets and ribbons and very colourful, and with purely Iberian diction and ways of saying. Several other types of Capitano exist. Inspired by the mask are numerous other variants such as Capitan Giangurgolo, Capitan Corazza, Capitan Cardone, Rinoceronte, Terremoto, Spezzaferro, Spaccamonti, Capitan Rodomonte. Numerous derivations of the mask adopted from the Neapolitan carnival or more generally from literature, such as Captain Fracassa, can also be traced back to the captain. \nIl Capitano often talks at length about made-up conquests of both the militaristic and the carnal variety to impress others, but often ends up impressing only himself. He gets easily carried away in his tales and doesn't realize when those around him don't buy his act. He would be the first to run away from all battles, and he has trouble talking to and being around men. He is also extremely opportunistic and greedy. If hired by Pantalone to protect his daughter from her many suitors, il Capitano would set up a bidding war for his services or aid between the suitors and Pantalone while wooing her himself. If he is hired to fight the Turks, he will bluster about fighting them to his last drop of blood, but when the Turks seem to be winning, he will join them. He will change sides again when they are driven off and boast about his loyalty and bravery.\nRole.\n\"I think of him as a peacock who has moulted all but one of his tail feathers, but does not know it\", notes author John Rudlin. In this case, his cowardice is usually overcome by the fury of his passion, which he makes every effort to demonstrate. Typically, however, his cowardice is such that when one of the characters orders him to do something, he often steps down out of fear, but is able to make up an excuse that ensures the other characters still see him as a brave and fierce individual. Columbine sometimes uses him to make Harlequin (Arlecchino) jealous, much to il Capitano's bewilderment and fright.\nOrigin.\nThe origin of il Capitano comes from 2 literary sources: Plautus's \"miles gloriosus\" and Terence's \"Eunuchus\". The first famous Capitano, Capitan Spaventa, appeared in Francesco Andreini's \"Bravure di Capitan Spaventa\" ('The Boast of the Terrifying Captain').\nStance.\nHe stands in a high posture, occupying as much space as possible, with a straight back and his chest pushed forward.\nPlot function.\nTo be exposed or 'de-masked'. He exists to be stripped of his excessive confidence and shown in a moment of panic and humility.\nDescription of the character.\nMask.\nHis mask is described as having \"a long nose, often unambiguously phallic\". The nose for Capitan Spaventa's mask is fairly large, but it lengthens with Matamoros and becomes absolutely gargantuan for Coccodrillo. Originally, the color of the mask was probably flesh tone, now it can be many flamboyant colors such as bright pink, yellow, and light blue. The mask often has a strong mustache and brow lines that can be black or have a purple/blue tone.\nCostume.\nMilitary-esque uniform (a satire on the period). The 1500s: feathered helmet or hat (\"mom panache\"), exaggerated garters, extraordinarily long sword and a plethora of ruffles. 1600s: coat, breeches, and he would mostly have a musket instead of a sword. In one famous scenario, il Capitano makes up a lie regarding the reason for his lack of an undershirt by claiming that it got that way because, \"I used to be an exceedingly fierce and violent man, and when I was made angry the hair which covers my body in goodly quantity stood on end and so riddled my shirt with holes that you would have taken it for a sieve.\" The real reason is that he has become too poor to afford one. Sometimes he wears it with a helmet or a bicorne or tricorne hat with a huge plume. Spanish characters often wear an exaggerated large neck-ruff.\nHe is usually always wearing his trademarked sword. If he were to ever work up enough nerve to draw it, it is usually too long to draw easily or too heavy or wobbly to wield properly. Even if he cut somebody with it, he would faint at the very sight of the blood.\nNoms de guerre.\nIl Capitano usually has a properly showy name for himself, preferably several lines long and followed by many made-up titles and lists of relations.\nSome names are fierce-sounding, such as \"Escobombardon\" (\"Fired out of a cannon\"), \"Rodomonte\" (\"Mountain-crumbler\"), \"Sangre y Fuego\" (Spanish: \"Blood and Fire\"), \"Spaccamonti\" (\"Mountain splitter\"), \"Spezzaferro\" (\"Iron-breaker\"), or \"Terremoto\" (\"Earthquake\"). Some names are ironic, such as \"Bellavista\" (\"Beautiful view\", a vain but ugly man) or \"\"Fracasso\"/\" Fracassa\"\" (the correct masculine version and an invented feminine version for \"Fracas\", \"Skirmish\" or \"Big noise\").\nSome are dismissive, such as \"Cerimonia\" (\"Ceremony\", all proper manners and rigid, slavish devotion to pointless details), \"Coccodrillo\" (\"Crocodile\", because he preys on others), \"Fanfarone\" (\"Trumpeter\" or \"Loudmouth\"), \"Giangurgulo\" (\"John the Glutton\"), \"Grillo\" (\"Grasshopper\", because he is small and 'hops' sides), \"Malagamba\" (\"Lame leg\"), \"Squaquara\" (\"Little Shi\"), \"Papirotonda\" (\"Round letter\", a complaint signed by mutinous soldiers or sailors in a circle around the main text so the ringleaders or originators cannot be discerned), \"Tagliacantoni\" (\"Small-sized\"), or \"Zerbino\" (\"Doormat\"). He is also prone to awarding himself ridiculous titles such as \"Capitan Spaventa di Vall'Inferna\" (\"Captain Fear, (Lord) of Hell's Valley\"; the name of \"Vall'Inferna\" also sounds similar to \"Va' all'Inferno!\", lit.\u2009'[When you die] Go to Hell!', an Italian-language imprecation), \"Salvador de los V\u00edrgenes Borrachos\" (Spanish for \"Savior of Drunken Virgins\"), or \"Sieur de Fracasse et Brise-tout\" (French for \"Lord of 'Knock it down' and 'Break everything'\"). \nVariants.\nThe French coined characters such as \"Boudoufle\" (Norman French for 'Puffed up with hurt pride'), \"Taille-bras\" (either 'Limb-Cutter' or 'Arm's Length'), and \"Engoulevent\" (either 'Night-bird' or 'Big-mouth'). England has the Irish dramatist George Farquhar's play \"The Recruiting Officer\". Major Bloodnok of \"The Goon Show\" bears some resemblance to il Capitano and shares many of his traits, such as lust, greed, and cowardice. In modern theater, the character \"miles gloriosus\" (Latin for 'Famous or Boastful Soldier') from \"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum\" is an obvious form of the character, though modeled from the earlier Roman plays.\nTypes.\n1. Capitan Spaventa (\"fear\")\n2. Rinoceronte (\"rhino\")\n3. Fracassa (\"uproar\")\n4. Spezzafer (\"iron splitter\")\n5. Cocodrillo (\"crocodile\") \u2013 \"a crocodile who never bites, he is all fanfare easily deflated,\" according to Rudlin. \n6. Matamoros (Spanish for \"Killer of Moors\") \u2013 the original Spanish mercenary \u2013 was created by Francesco Andreini. He is powerfully built and very lavishly dressed. The clothes of his servants were supposedly made from the turbans of his victims. Has a hedgehog on his coat of arms, the result of his exploits at the battle of Trebizonde, where he claims to have fought his way into the tent of the Sultan himself. He then dragged him through the camp with one hand while fighting off the entire enemy army with the other hand. Afterward, so many arrows were stuck in him when he fought free that he resembled a hedgehog.\n7. Scaramouche \u2013 Scaramuccia (Italian), or Scaramouche (French) (\"skirmish\") was a reinvention of the character by Tiberio Fiorilli. He is more of a man of action than he is a braggart and is clever, brave, and quick-witted rather than ignorant, cowardly, and foolish. He is also a good singer and musician and is usually depicted with a lute or guitar. Although quite a heartbreaker, he is usually indirectly or unobtrusively helpful to the \"innamorati\".\n8. Fanfarone \u2013 pretends to be Spanish, but is just a Zanni.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Together, such conventions constitute a visual language and help to ensure that the drawing is unambiguous and relatively easy to understand. Many of the symbols and principles of technical drawing are codified in an international standard called ISO 128.\nThe need for precise communication in the preparation of a functional document distinguishes technical drawing from the expressive drawing of the visual arts. Artistic drawings are subjectively interpreted; their meanings are multiply determined. Technical drawings are understood to have one intended meaning.\nA draftsman is a person who makes a drawing (technical or expressive). A professional drafter who makes technical drawings is sometimes called a drafting technician.\nMethods.\nSketching.\nA sketch is a quickly executed, freehand drawing that is usually not intended as a finished work. In general, sketching is a quick way to record an idea for later use. Architect's sketches primarily serve as a way to try out different ideas and establish a composition before a more finished work, especially when the finished work is expensive and time-consuming.\nArchitectural sketches, for example, are a kind of diagram. These sketches, like metaphors, are used by architects as a means of communication in aiding design collaboration. This tool helps architects to abstract attributes of hypothetical provisional design solutions and summarize their complex patterns, thereby enhancing the design process.\nManual or by instrument.\nThe basic drafting procedure is to place a piece of paper (or other material) on a smooth surface with right-angle corners and straight sides\u2014typically a drawing board. A sliding straightedge known as a T-square is then placed on one of the sides, allowing it to be slid across the side of the table, and over the surface of the paper.\n\"Parallel lines\" can be drawn by moving the T-square and running a pencil or technical pen along the T-square's edge. The T-square is used to hold other devices such as set squares or triangles. In this case, the drafter places one or more triangles of known angles on the T-square \u2014 which is itself at right angles to the edge of the table \u2014 and can then draw lines at any chosen angle to others on the page. Modern drafting tables are equipped with a drafting machine that is supported on both sides of the table to slide over a large piece of paper. Because it is secured on both sides, lines drawn along the edge are guaranteed to be parallel.\nThe drafter uses several technical drawing tools to draw curves and circles. Primary among these are the compasses, used for drawing arcs and circles, and the French curve, for drawing curves. A spline is a rubber coated articulated metal that can be manually bent to most curves.\nDrafting templates assist the drafter with creating recurring objects in a drawing without having to reproduce the object from scratch every time. This is especially useful when using common symbols; i.e. in the context of stagecraft, a lighting designer will draw from the USITT standard library of lighting fixture symbols to indicate the position of a common fixture across multiple positions. Templates are sold commercially by a number of vendors, usually customized to a specific task, but it is also not uncommon for a drafter to create his own templates.\nThis basic drafting system requires an accurate table and constant attention to the positioning of the tools. Even tasks as simple as drawing two angled lines meeting at a point require a number of moves of the T-square and triangles, and in general, drafting can be a time-consuming process.\nA solution to these problems was the introduction of the mechanical \"drafting machine\", an application of the pantograph (sometimes referred to incorrectly as a \"pentagraph\" in these situations) which allowed the drafter to have an accurate right angle at any point on the page quickly. These machines often included the ability to change the angle, hence removing the need for the triangles.\nIn addition to the mastery of the mechanics of drawing lines, arcs and circles (and text) onto a piece of paper\u2014with respect to the detailing of physical objects\u2014the drafting effort requires a thorough understanding of geometry, trigonometry and spatial comprehension, and in all cases demands precision and accuracy, and attention to detail of high order.\nAlthough drafting is sometimes accomplished by a project engineer, architect, or shop personnel (such as a machinist), skilled drafters (or designers) usually accomplish the task, and are always in demand to some degree.\nComputer aided design.\nToday, the mechanics of the drafting task have largely been automated and accelerated through the use of computer-aided design (CAD) systems.\nThere are two types of CAD systems used for the production of technical drawings: two dimensions (2D) and three dimensions (3D).\n2D CAD systems such as AutoCAD or MicroStation replace the paper drawing discipline. The lines, circles, arcs, and curves are created within the software. It is down to the technical drawing skill of the user to produce the drawing. There is still much scope for error in the drawing when producing first and third angle orthographic projections, auxiliary projections and cross-section views. A 2D CAD system is merely an electronic drawing board. Its greatest strength over direct to paper technical drawing is in the making of revisions. Whereas in a conventional hand drawn technical drawing, if a mistake is found, or a modification is required, a new drawing must be made from scratch, the 2D CAD system allows a copy of the original to be modified, saving considerable time. 2D CAD systems can be used to create plans for large projects such as buildings and aircraft but provide no way to check the various components will fit together.\nA 3D CAD system (such as KeyCreator, Autodesk Inventor, or SolidWorks) first produces the geometry of the part; the technical drawing comes from user defined views of that geometry. Any orthographic, projected or sectioned view is created by the software. There is no scope for error in the production of these views. The main scope for error comes in setting the parameter of first or third angle projection and displaying the relevant symbol on the technical drawing. 3D CAD allows individual parts to be assembled together to represent the final product. Buildings, aircraft, ships, and cars are modelled, assembled, and checked in 3D before technical drawings are released for manufacture.\nBoth 2D and 3D CAD systems can be used to produce technical drawings for any discipline. The various disciplines (electrical, electronic, pneumatic, hydraulic, etc.) have industry recognized symbols to represent common components.\nBS and ISO produce standards to show recommended practices but it is up to individuals to produce the drawings to a standard. There is no definitive standard for layout or style. The only standard across engineering workshop drawings is in the creation of orthographic projections and cross-section views.\nIn representing complex, three-dimensional objects in two-dimensional drawings, the objects can be described by at least one view plus material thickness notes and as many views and sections that are required to show all features of an object.\nApplications.\nArchitecture.\nThe art and design that goes into making buildings is known as architecture. To communicate all aspects of the shape or design, detail drawings are used. In this field, the term \"plan\" is often used when referring to the full section view of these drawings as viewed from three feet above finished floor to show the locations of doorways, windows, stairwells, etc. Architectural drawings describe and document an architect's design.\nEngineering.\nEngineering can be a very broad term. It stems from the Latin \"ingenerare\", meaning \"to create\". Because this could apply to everything that humans create, it is given a narrower definition in the context of technical drawing. Engineering drawings generally deal with mechanical engineered items, such as manufactured parts and equipment.\nEngineering drawings are usually created in accordance with standardized conventions for layout, nomenclature, interpretation, appearance (such as typefaces and line styles), size, etc.\nIts purpose is to accurately and unambiguously capture all the geometric features of a product or a component. The end goal of an engineering drawing is to convey all the required information that will allow a manufacturer to produce that component.\nSoftware engineering.\nSoftware engineering practitioners make use of diagrams for designing software. Formal standards and modelling languages such as Unified Modelling Language (UML) exist but most diagramming happens using informal ad hoc diagrams that illustrate a conceptual model.\nPractitioners reported that diagramming helped with analysing requirements, design, refactoring, documentation, onboarding, communication with stake holders. Diagrams are often transient or redrawn as required. Redrawn diagrams can act as a form of shared understanding in a team.\nRelated fields.\nTechnical illustration.\n\"Technical illustration\" is the use of illustration to visually communicate information of a technical nature. Technical illustrations can be component technical drawings or diagrams. The aim of technical illustration is \"to generate expressive images that effectively convey certain information via the visual channel to the human observer\".\nThe main purpose of technical illustration is to describe or explain these items to a more or less nontechnical audience. The visual image should be accurate in terms of dimensions and proportions, and should provide \"an overall impression of what an object is or does, to enhance the viewer's interest and understanding\".\nAccording to Viola (2005), \"illustrative techniques are often designed in a way that even a person with no technical understanding clearly understands the piece of art. The use of varying line widths to emphasize mass, proximity, and scale helped to make a simple line drawing more understandable to the lay person. Cross hatching, stippling, and other low abstraction techniques gave greater depth and dimension to the subject matter\".\nCutaway drawing.\nA \"cutaway drawing\" is a technical illustration, in which part of the surface of a three-dimensional model is removed in order to show some of the model's interior in relation to its exterior.\nThe purpose of a cutaway drawing is to \"allow the viewer to have a look into an otherwise solid opaque object. Instead of letting the inner object shine through the surrounding surface, parts of outside object are simply removed. This produces a visual appearance as if someone had cutout a piece of the object or sliced it into parts. Cutaway illustrations avoid ambiguities with respect to spatial ordering, provide a sharp contrast between foreground and background objects, and facilitate a good understanding of spatial ordering\".\nTechnical drawings.\nTypes.\nThe two types of technical drawings are based on graphical projection. This is used to create an image of a three-dimensional object onto a two-dimensional surface.\nTwo-dimensional representation.\nTwo-dimensional representation uses orthographic projection to create an image where only two of the three dimensions of the object are seen.\nThree-dimensional representation.\nIn a three-dimensional representation, also referred to as a pictorial, all three dimensions of an object are visible.\nViews.\nMultiview.\nMultiview is a type of orthographic projection. There are two conventions for using multiview, first-angle and third-angle. In both cases, the front or main side of the object is the same. First-angle is drawing the object sides based on where they land. Example, looking at the front side, rotate the object 90\u00a0degrees to the right. What is seen will be drawn to the right of the front side. Third-angle is drawing the object sides based on where they are. Example, looking at the front side, rotate the object 90\u00a0degrees to the right. What is seen is actually the left side of the object and will be drawn to the left of the front side.\nSection.\nWhile multiview relates to external surfaces of an object, section views show an imaginary plane cut through an object. This is often useful to show voids in an object.\nAuxiliary.\nAuxiliary views utilize an additional projection plane other than the common planes in a multiview. Since the features of an object need to show the true shape and size of the object, the projection plane must be parallel to the object surface. Therefore, any surface that is not in line with the three major axis needs its own projection plane to show the features correctly.\nPattern.\nPatterns, sometimes called developments, show the size and shape of a flat piece of material needed for later bending or folding into a three-dimensional shape.\nExploded.\nAn \"exploded-view drawing\" is a technical drawing of an object that shows the relationship or order of assembly of the various parts. It shows the components of an object slightly separated by distance or suspended in surrounding space in the case of a three-dimensional exploded diagram. An object is represented as if there had been a small controlled explosion emanating from the middle of the object, causing the object's parts to be separated relative distances away from their original locations.\nAn exploded view drawing (EVD) can show the intended assembly of mechanical or other parts. In mechanical systems, the component closest to the center is usually assembled first or is the main part inside which the other parts are assembled. The EVD can also help to represent the disassembly of parts, where those on the outside are normally removed first.\nStandards and conventions.\nBasic drafting paper sizes.\nThere have been many standard sizes of paper at different times and in different countries, but today most of the world uses the international standard (A4 and its siblings). North America uses its own sizes.\nPatent drawing.\nThe applicant for a patent will be required by law to furnish a drawing of the invention if or when the nature of the case requires a drawing to understand the invention with the job. This drawing must be filed with the application. This includes practically all inventions except compositions of matter or processes, but a drawing may also be useful in the case of many processes.\nThe drawing must show every feature of the invention specified in the claims and is required by the patent office rules to be in a particular form. The Office specifies the size of the sheet on which the drawing is made, the type of paper, the margins, and other details relating to the making of the drawing. The reason for specifying the standards in detail is that the drawings are printed and published in a uniform style when the patent issues and the drawings must also be such that they can be readily understood by people using the patent descriptions.\nSets of technical drawings.\nWorking drawings for production.\nWorking drawings are the set of technical drawings used during the manufacturing phase of a product. In architecture, these include civil drawings, architectural drawings, structural drawings, mechanical systems drawings, electrical drawings, and plumbing drawings.\nAssembly drawings.\nAssembly drawings show how different parts go together, identify those parts by number, and have a parts list, often referred to as a bill of materials. In a technical service manual, this type of drawing may be referred to as an exploded view drawing or diagram.\nThese parts may be used in engineering.\nAs-fitted drawings.\nAlso called \"as-built\" and \"as-made\", an \"as-fitted\" drawing represents a record of a completed work, literally as fitted. An as-fitted drawing is based upon working drawings and updated to reflect any changes during construction or manufacture.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was in reality a puppet ruler raised to power by Ricimer, the \"magister militum\" of Germanic descent, and was mainly interested in religion, while the actual power was held by Ricimer and his nephew Gundobad.\nBiography.\nFamily and early career.\nOlybrius was born in Rome, in the ancient and powerful \"gens\" Anicia, of Italian descent.\nAccording to the consensus of historians, he was related to the consul Anicius Hermogenianus Olybrius, whose wife and cousin, Anicia Juliana, had the same name that Olybrius gave to his own daughter. Other historians consider this questionable, as \"Juliana\" was a common name in the \"gens\" Anicia, and because Hermogenianus seems to have begotten only one daughter, who took chastity vows. Other possible fathers have therefore been proposed: either Anicius Probus (suggested by Settipani) or, according to some clues, Petronius Maximus.\nOlybrius married Placidia, younger daughter of western \"augustus\" Valentinian III (r.\u2009425\u00a0\u2013\u00a0455) and his wife Licinia Eudoxia, thus creating a bond between a member of the senatorial aristocracy and the conjoined Valentinianic\u2013Theodosian dynasties. The year of their wedding is not recorded, although the historian Priscus implies it took place before Gaiseric's Vandals sacked Rome (June 2\u201316, 455). Oost has pointed out that in his chronicle Hydatius wrote Placidia was unmarried as of 455.\nSteven Muhlberger points out that many of the events in the chronicle of Hydatius are based on hearsay, that problems with his chronology \"resulted from delays and distortions in the best information to which he had access,\" and thus the evidence from Hydatius is not as decisive as Oost believed. Regardless, the powerful \"magister militum\" Aetius had forced Valentinian to betroth Placidia to his own son Gaudentius, so Olybrius could not have married her before Aetius' death.\nEmperor Valentinian killed Aetius on 21 September 454. The following year, Valentinian was killed by some soldiers who had served under Aetius, probably instigated by the \"patricius\" Petronius Maximus, who succeeded to the throne. Petronius, who was a high-ranking imperial officer and a member of a family belonging to the senatorial aristocracy, married the \"augusta\" Licinia Eudoxia, widow of Valentinian. He also elevated his own son Palladius to the rank of \"caesar\" and had him marry Eudocia, elder daughter of Valentinian.\nAccording to those historians who believe that Olybrius was Petronius' son, it was in 455 that Olybrius married Placidia, between 17 April, when Petronius was acclaimed \"augustus\", and 31 May, when he died; this would explain the marriage between Olybrius and Valentinian's younger daughter as a move to secure Petronius' legitimacy as emperor.\nAnother possibility is that Olybrius and Placidia were engaged in 455, and only after Gaiseric freed her from his possession in the early 460s were they at last married. Oost mentions this possibility in his book \"Galla Placidia Augusta\". The surviving evidence is not sufficient to allow us to decide between these alternatives.\nTwice candidate for the throne.\nThe Vandals, led by King Gaiseric, took advantage of the confusion and weakness of the Western Empire in the wake of Valentinian's turbulent succession, moving into Italy and sacking Rome in June 455. Before returning to Africa, the Vandals took Licinia Eudoxia and her two daughters as hostages. According to the 6th-century historian John Malalas, Olybrius was in Constantinople at the time. On the other hand, the 6th-century chronicler Evagrius Scholasticus writes that Olybrius had fled Rome on the approach of Gaiseric's army.\nDuring his residence in the Eastern capital, Olybrius expressed his interest in religious matters. He met Daniel the Stylite, who, according to Christian tradition, prophesied the liberation of Licinia Eudoxia. In the meantime, the Western Empire went through a rapid succession of Emperors. After Petronius, the Gallic-Roman senator Avitus was proclaimed Emperor by the Visigoth king Theodoric II and ruled for two years; he was deposed by Majorian, who ruled for four years before being killed by his general Ricimer in 461.\nGaiseric supported Olybrius to assume the vacant Western throne because Gaiseric's son Huneric and Olybrius had married the two daughters of Valentinian III, and with Olybrius on the throne, Gaiseric could exert great influence on the Western Empire. Therefore, Gaiseric freed Licinia Eudoxia (fulfilling Daniel's prophesy) and her daughter Placidia (Olybrius' wife), but he did not cease his raids on Italy's coasts. His project failed, however, as Ricimer, who had become the \"Magister militum\" of the West, chose Libius Severus as new Emperor (461\u2013465). Placidia was now free, however, joining her husband at Constantinople, where they had a daughter, Anicia Juliana, in 462.\nOlybrius was nearly chosen for the Western throne again in 465, after Libius Severus died. Gaiseric was again his major supporter, but the Eastern Emperor Leo I chose the noble Procopius Anthemius. Olybrius' association with Gaiseric did not harm his career, however, as the Eastern court chose him for the high honour of the consulate in 464.\nRise to the throne.\nSources agree that Olybrius rose to the western throne thanks to the western \"magister militum\" Ricimer. They differ over the timing and order of the events leading to his ascent.\nIn the version provided by John Malalas, and championed by J. B. Bury, Olybrius was sent to Italy in 472 by Leo I, ostensibly to mediate between Ricimer and Anthemius, who was besieged by Ricimer in Rome. Once he had accomplished this, Olybrius would then continue to Carthage and offer a peace treaty to Gaiseric. Leo suspected that Olybrius favored the Vandal king, however, and would secretly take his side and betray the suspicious Emperor. Leo had Olybrius followed by another envoy bearing a letter for Anthemius stating:\n I have removed Aspar and Ardaburius from this world, so that no one who might oppose me would survive. But you also must kill your son-in-law Ricimer, lest there be anyone who might betray you. Moreover, I also have sent the patrician Olybrius to you; I wish you to kill him, so that you might reign, ruling rather than serving others.\nRicimer had placed a guard at Ostia who found the secret letter. Ricimer showed the document to Olybrius, which convinced Olybrius to accept the purple. From Ricimer's point of view, Olybrius was a good candidate, as a member of the Roman senatorial aristocracy and because of his marriage to Placidia; his marriage to her makes him the last emperor of the conjoined Valentinianic\u2013Theodosian dynasties to rule in the west. Ricimer had Anthemius killed and Olybrius acclaimed Emperor (11 July 472).\nThe competing version of events does not mention the secret letter. Instead, after arriving in Rome, Olybrius was proclaimed emperor several months before Anthemius' death, in April or May 472. Ricimer then besieged the part of Rome where Anthemius was for several months until the lawful Emperor was abandoned by his partisans, captured in a church, and put to death by Gundobad, Ricimer's nephew. This version implies that Olybrius was secretly supported by the Emperor Leo, which explains why Leo sent him there. Three sources \u2013 Theophanes, the \"Paschal Chronicle\", and Paullus Diaconus \u2013 support this version. Edward Gibbon accepts this implication as fact, although none of the three sources explicitly state that Leo supported Olybrius. What other reason could there be, Bury asks, then answers his own rhetorical question: \"the facts that Anthemius was Leo's chosen candidate, his \"filius\", and that Olybrius was the friend of his foe Genseric, are a strong counter-argument.\"\nReign and death.\nThe reign of Olybrius was short and uneventful. Soon after the death of Anthemius, Ricimer also died, on 9 or 19 August; his nephew Gundobad was elevated to \"magister militum\" in his place. Very little is known of Olybrius' policy; in his \"Vita Epifanius\", Ennodius describes him as a pious man who acted accordingly. As evidence, he had minted a new series of gold coins bearing a cross and the new legend (\"Welfare of the World\") instead of the usual (\"Welfare of the State\"). It is also noteworthy that Olybrius is depicted on his coins without helm and spear, common symbols on his predecessors' coinage, suggesting he had little interest in military matters.\nOlybrius had a palace in the Tenth region of Constantinople at one end of the Mese, the main street, along the \"Constantinianae\". Olybrius also paid for the restoration of the nearby church of Saint Euphemia in Chalcedon, which had been chosen by the \"augusta\" Pulcheria (r.\u2009414\u00a0\u2013\u00a0453), sister of Theodosius II (r.\u2009402\u00a0\u2013\u00a0450), for the Council of Chalcedon in 451. This choice was a sign of the bond between Olybrius, a Roman senator, with the imperial Theodosian dynasty.\nOlybrius died of dropsy after seven months of rule, most likely on 2 November.\nOlybrius in culture.\nIn 1707, Apostolo Zeno and Pietro Pariati wrote a \"libretto\" entitled \"Flavio Anicio Olibrio\". The story told in the opera is quite different from the real one, despite the fact that Zeno claimed to use several historical sources (Evagrius Scholasticus l.2.c.7, Procopius of Caesarea, \"Historia Vandalorum\", l.1, Paul the Deacon, vi): Ricimer captures Rome, frees his sister Teodolinda and enslaves Placidia, daughter of Valentinian III; a little later, Olybrius frees Rome and Placidia, and marries her.\nThe \"libretto\" was written for a \"dramma per musica\" in three acts by Francesco Gasparini, performed that same year in the Teatro San Cassiano in Venice, but the same \"libretto\" was put to music also by Nicola Porpora (1711, in Naples, as \"Il trionfo di Flavio Anicio Olibrio\"),\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

With no visual component, radio drama depends on dialogue, music and sound effects to help the listener imagine the characters and story: \"It is auditory in the physical dimension but equally powerful as a visual force in the psychological dimension.\" Radio drama includes plays specifically written for radio, docudrama, dramatised works of fiction, as well as plays originally written for the theatre, including musical theatre, and opera.\nRadio drama achieved widespread popularity within a decade of its initial development in the 1920s. By the 1940s, it was a leading international popular entertainment. With the advent of television in the 1950s, radio drama began losing its audience. However, it remains popular in much of the world.\nRecordings of OTR (old-time radio) survive today in the audio archives of collectors, libraries and museums, as well as several online sites such as the Internet Archive.\nBy the 21st century, radio drama had a minimal presence on terrestrial radio in the United States, with much American radio drama being restricted to rebroadcasts of programmes from previous decades. However, other nations still have thriving traditions of radio drama. In the United Kingdom, for example, the BBC produces and broadcasts hundreds of new radio plays each year on Radio 3, Radio 4, and Radio 4 Extra. Like the US, Australia's network the ABC has abandoned broadcasting drama but in New Zealand on RNZ, continues to promote and broadcast a variety of drama over its airwaves.\nThanks to advances in digital recording and Internet distribution, radio drama experienced a revival around 2010. Podcasting offered the means of inexpensively creating new radio dramas, in addition to the distribution of vintage programs.\nThe terms \"audio drama\" or \"audio theatre\" are sometimes used synonymously with \"radio drama\"; however, audio drama or audio theatre may not necessarily be intended specifically for broadcast on radio. Audio drama can also be found on CDs, cassette tapes, podcasts, webcasts, or other digital downloads as well as broadcast radio.\nHistory.\nThe Roman playwright Seneca has claim as a forerunner of radio drama because \"his plays were performed by readers as sound plays, not by actors as stage plays... In this respect Seneca had no significant successors until 20th-century technology made possible the widespread dissemination of sound plays.\"\n1880\u20131930: early years.\nRadio drama traces its roots back to the 1880s: \"In 1881 French engineer Clement Ader had filed a patent for 'improvements of Telephone Equipment in Theatres'\" (Th\u00e9\u00e2trophone). English-language radio drama seems to have started in the United States. \"A Rural Line on Education\", a brief sketch specifically written for radio, aired on Pittsburgh's KDKA in 1921, according to historian Bill Jaker. Newspaper accounts of the era report on a number of other drama experiments by America's commercial radio stations: KYW broadcast a season of complete operas from Chicago starting in November 1921. In February 1922, entire Broadway musical comedies with the original casts aired from WJZ's Newark studios. Actors Grace George and Herbert Hayes performed an entire play from a San Francisco station in the summer of 1922.\nAn important turning point in radio drama came when Schenectady, New York's WGY, after a successful tryout on 3 August 1922, began weekly studio broadcasts of full-length stage plays in September 1922, using music, sound effects and a regular troupe of actors, The WGY Players. Aware of this series, the director of Cincinnati's WLW began regularly broadcasting one-acts (as well as excerpts from longer works) in November. The success of these projects led to imitators at other stations. By early 1923, original dramatic pieces written specially for radio were airing on stations in Cincinnati (\"When Love Wakens\" by WLW's Fred Smith), Philadelphia (\"The Secret Wave\" by Clyde A. Criswell) and Los Angeles (\"At Home\" over KHJ). That same year, WLW (in May) and WGY (in September) sponsored scripting contests, inviting listeners to create original plays to be performed by those stations' dramatic troupes.\nListings in \"The New York Times\" and other sources for May 1923 reveal at least 20 dramatic offerings were scheduled (including one-acts, excerpts from longer dramas, complete three- and four-act plays, operettas and a Moli\u00e8re adaptation), either as in-studio productions or by remote broadcast from local theatres and opera houses. An early British drama broadcast was of Shakespeare's \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" on 2LO on 25 July 1923.\nSerious study of American radio drama of the 1920s and early 1930s is, at best, very limited. Unsung pioneers of the art include: WLW's Fred Smith; Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll (who popularised the dramatic serial); \"The Eveready Hour\" creative team (which began with one-act plays but was soon experimenting with hour-long combinations of drama and music on its weekly variety program); the various acting troupes at stations like WLW, WGY, KGO and a number of others, frequently run by women like Helen Schuster Martin and Wilda Wilson Church; early network continuity writers like Henry Fisk Carlton, William Ford Manley and Don Clark; producers and directors like Clarence Menser and Gerald Stopp; and a long list of others who were credited at the time with any number of innovations but who are largely forgotten or undiscussed today. Elizabeth McLeod's 2005 book on Gosden and Correll's early work is a major exception, as is Richard J. Hand's 2006 study of horror radio, which examines some programs from the late 1920s and early 1930s.\nAnother notable early radio drama, one of the first specially written for the medium in the UK, was \"A Comedy of Danger\" by Richard Hughes, broadcast by the BBC on 15 January 1924, about a group of people trapped in a Welsh coal mine. One of the earliest and most influential French radio plays was the prize-winning \"Mar\u00e9moto\" ('Seaquake'), by Gabriel Germinet and Pierre Cusy, which presents a realistic account of a sinking ship before revealing that the characters are actually actors rehearsing for a broadcast. Translated and broadcast in Germany and England by 1925, the play was originally scheduled by Radio-Paris to air on 23 October 1924, but was instead banned from French radio until 1937 because the government feared that the dramatic SOS messages would be mistaken for genuine distress signals.\nIn 1951, American writer and producer Arch Oboler suggested that Wyllis Cooper's \"Lights Out\" (1934\u201347) was the first true radio drama to make use of the unique qualities of radio:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Radio drama (as distinguished from theatre plays boiled down to kilocycle size) began at midnight, in the middle thirties, on one of the upper floors of Chicago's Merchandise Mart. The pappy was a rotund writer by the name of Wyllis Cooper.\nThough the series is often remembered solely for its gruesome stories and sound effects, Cooper's scripts for \"Lights Out\" were later recognised as well written and offered innovations seldom heard in early radio dramas, including multiple first-person narrators, stream of consciousness monologues and scripts that contrasted a duplicitous character's internal monologue and his spoken words.\nThe question of who was the first to write stream-of-consciousness drama for radio is a difficult one to answer. By 1930, Tyrone Guthrie had written plays for the BBC like \"Matrimonial News\" (which consists entirely of the thoughts of a shopgirl awaiting a blind date) and \"The Flowers Are Not for You to Pick\" (which takes place inside the mind of a drowning man). After they were published in 1931, Guthrie's plays aired on the American networks. Around the same time, Guthrie himself also worked for the Canadian National Railway radio network, producing plays written by Merrill Denison that used similar techniques. A 1940 article in \"Variety\" credited a 1932 NBC play, \"Drink Deep\" by Don Johnson, as the first stream-of-consciousness play written for American radio. The climax of Lawrence Holcomb's 1931 NBC play \"Skyscraper\" also uses a variation of the technique (so that the listener can hear the final thoughts and relived memories of a man falling to his death from the title building).\nThere were probably earlier examples of stream-of-consciousness drama on the radio. For example, in December 1924, actor Paul Robeson, then appearing in a revival of Eugene O'Neill's \"The Emperor Jones\", performed a scene from the play over New York's WGBS to critical acclaim. Some of the many storytellers and monologuists on early 1920s American radio might be able to claim even earlier dates.\n1930\u20131960s: widespread popularity.\nPerhaps America's most famous radio drama broadcast is Orson Welles' \"The War of the Worlds\" (a 1938 version of H. G. Wells' novel), which inspired stories of a mass panic that, though greatly exaggerated, signaled the power of the form.\nBy the late 1930s, radio drama was widely popular in the United States (and also in other parts of the world). There were dozens of programs in many different genres, from mysteries and thrillers, to soap operas and comedies. Among American playwrights, screenwriters and novelists who got their start in radio drama are Rod Serling and Irwin Shaw.\nIn Britain, however, during the 1930s BBC programming, tended to be more high brow, including the works of Shakespeare, Classical Greek drama, as well as the works of major modern playwrights, such as Chekhov, Ibsen, Strindberg, and so forth. Novels and short stories were also frequently dramatised. In addition the plays of contemporary writers and original plays were produced, with, for example, a broadcast of T. S. Eliot's famous verse play \"Murder in the Cathedral\" in 1936. By 1930, the BBC was producing \"twice as many plays as London's West End\" and were producing over 400 plays a year by the mid-1940s.\nProducers of radio drama soon became aware that adapting stage plays for radio did not always work, and that there was a need for plays specifically written for radio, which recognised its potential as a distinct and different medium from the theatre. George Bernard Shaw's plays, for example, were seen as readily adaptable. However, in a lead article in the BBC literary journal \"The Listener\", of 14 August 1929, which discussed the broadcasting of 12 great plays, it was suggested that while the theatrical literature of the past should not be neglected the future lay mainly with plays written specifically for the microphone.\nIn 1939\u201340, the BBC founded its own Drama Repertory Company which made a stock of actors readily available. After the war, the number was around 50. They performed in the great number of plays broadcast in the heyday of BBC radio drama of the 40s\u201360s.\nInitially the BBC resisted American-style 'soap opera', but eventually highly popular serials, like \"Dick Barton, Special Agent\" (1946\u201351), \"Mrs Dale's Diary\" (1948\u201369) and \"The Archers\" (1950\u2013), were produced. \"The Archers\" is still running (as of July\u00a02024[ [update]]) and is the world's longest-running soap opera with a total of over 18,400 episodes. There had been some earlier serialised drama including, the six episode \"The Shadow of the Swastika\" (1939), Dorothy L. Sayers's \"The Man Born To Be King\", in twelve episodes (1941), and \"Front Line Family\" (1941\u201348), which was broadcast to America as part of the effort to encourage the US to enter the war. The show's storylines depicted the trials and tribulations of a British family, the Robinsons, living through the war. This featured plots about rationing, family members missing in action and the Blitz. After the war in 1946 it was moved to the BBC Light Programme.\nThe BBC continued producing various kinds of drama, including docu-drama, throughout World War II; amongst the writers they employed were the novelist James Hanley and poet Louis MacNeice, who in 1941 became an employee of the BBC's. MacNeice's work for the BBC initially involved writing and producing radio programmes intended to build support for the US, and later Russia, through cultural programmes emphasising links between the countries rather than outright propaganda. By the end of the war MacNeice had written well over 60 scripts for the BBC, including \"Christopher Columbus\" (1942), which starred Laurence Olivier, \"The Dark Tower\" (1946), and a six-part radio adaptation of Goethe's \"Faust\" (1949).\nFollowing World War II the BBC reorganised its radio provision, introducing two new channels to supplement the BBC Home Service (itself the result of the fusion in September 1939 of the pre-war National and Regional Programmes). These were the BBC Light Programme (dating from 29 July 1945 and a direct successor to the wartime General Forces Programme) and the BBC Third Programme (launched on 29 September 1946).\nThe BBC Light Programme, while principally devoted to light entertainment and music, carried a fair share of drama, both single plays (generally, as the name of the station indicated, of a lighter nature) and serials. In contrast, the BBC Third Programme, destined to become one of the leading cultural and intellectual forces in post-war Britain, specialised in heavier drama (as well as the serious music, talks, and other features which made up its content): long-form productions of both classical and modern/experimental dramatic works sometimes occupied the major part of its output on any given evening. The Home Service, meanwhile, continued to broadcast more \"middle-brow\" drama (one-off plays and serialisations) daily.\nThe high-water mark for BBC radio drama was the 1950s and 1960s, and during this period many major British playwrights either effectively began their careers with the BBC, or had works adapted for radio. Most of playwright Caryl Churchill's early experiences with professional drama production were as a radio playwright and, starting in 1962 with \"The Ants\", she wrote nine productions with BBC radio drama up until 1973, when her stage work began to be recognised at the Royal Court Theatre. Joe Orton's dramatic debut in 1963 was the radio play \"The Ruffian on the Stair\", which was broadcast on 31 August 1964.\nTom Stoppard's \"first professional production was in the 15-minute \"Just Before Midnight\" programme on BBC Radio, which showcased new dramatists\". John Mortimer made his radio debut as a dramatist in 1955, with his adaptation of his own novel \"Like Men Betrayed\" for the BBC Light Programme. However, he made his debut as an original playwright with \"The Dock Brief\", starring Michael Hordern as a hapless barrister, first broadcast in 1957 on BBC Third Programme, later televised with the same cast and subsequently presented in a double bill with \"What Shall We Tell Caroline?\" at the Lyric Hammersmith in April 1958, before transferring to the Garrick Theatre. Mortimer is most famous for \"Rumpole of the Bailey\", a British television series which starred Leo McKern as Horace Rumpole, an aging London barrister who defends any and all clients. It has been spun off into a series of short stories, novels, and radio programmes.\nGiles Cooper was a pioneer in writing for radio, becoming prolific in both radio and television drama. His early successes included radio dramatisations of Charles Dickens's \"Oliver Twist\", William Golding's \"Lord of the Flies\", and John Wyndham's classic science fiction novel \"The Day of the Triffids\". He was also successful in the theatre. The first of his radio plays to make his reputation was \"Mathry Beacon\" (1956), about a small detachment of men and women still guarding a Top Secret \"missile deflector\" somewhere in Wales, years after the war has ended. Bill Naughton's radio play \"Alfie Elkins and his Little Life\" (1962) was first broadcast on the BBC Third Programme on 7 January 1962. In it Alfie, \"[w]ith sublime amorality... swaggers and philosophises his way through\" life. The action spans about two decades, from the beginning of World War II to the late 1950s. In 1964, Bill Naughton turned it into a stage play which was put on at London's Mermaid Theatre. Later, he wrote the screenplay for a film version, \"Alfie\" (1966), starring Michael Caine.\nOther notable radio dramatists included Henry Reed, Brendan Behan, Rhys Adrian, Alan Plater; Anthony Minghella, Alan Bleasdale, and novelist Angela Carter. Novelist Susan Hill also wrote for BBC Radio, from the early 1970s. Henry Reed was especially successful with the Hilda Tablet plays. Irish playwright Brendan Behan, author of \"The Quare Fellow\" (1954), was commissioned by the BBC to write a radio play \"The Big House\" (1956); prior to this he had written two plays for Irish radio: \"Moving Out\" and \"A Garden Party\".\nAmong the most famous works created for radio, are Dylan Thomas's \"Under Milk Wood\" (1954), Samuel Beckett's \"All That Fall\" (1957), Harold Pinter's \"A Slight Ache\" (1959), and Robert Bolt's \"A Man for All Seasons\" (1954). Beckett wrote a number of short radio plays in the 1950s and 1960s, and later for television; his radio play \"Embers\" was first broadcast on the BBC Third Programme on 24 June 1959 and won the RAI prize at the Prix Italia awards later that year.\nRobert Bolt's writing career began with scripts for \"Children's Hour\". \"A Man for All Seasons\" was subsequently produced on television in 1957. Then in 1960, there was a highly successful stage production in London's West End and on New York's Broadway from late 1961. In addition there have been two film versions: in 1966 starring Paul Scofield and 1988 for television, starring Charlton Heston.\nWhile Alan Ayckbourn did not write for radio many of his stage plays were subsequently adapted for radio. Other significant adaptations included, dramatised readings of poet David Jones's \"In Parenthesis\" in 1946 and \"The Anathemata\" in 1953, for the BBC Third Programme, and novelist Wyndham Lewis's \"The Human Age\" (1955). Among contemporary novels that were dramatised were the 1964 radio adaptation of Stan Barstow's \"A Kind of Loving\" (1960); there had also been a 1962 film adaptation.\n1960\u20132000: decline in the United States.\nAfter the advent of television, radio drama never recovered its popularity in the United States. Most remaining CBS and NBC radio dramas were cancelled in 1960. The last network radio dramas to originate during American radio's \"Golden Age\", \"Suspense\" and \"Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar\", ended on 30 September 1962.\nThere have been some efforts at radio drama since then. In the 1960s, Dick Orkin created the popular syndicated comic adventure series \"Chicken Man\". ABC Radio aired a daily dramatic anthology program, \"Theater Five\", in 1964\u201365. Inspired by \"The Goon Show\", \"the four or five crazy guys\" of the Firesign Theatre built a large following with their satirical plays on recordings exploring the dramatic possibilities inherent in stereo. A brief resurgence of production beginning in the early 1970s yielded Rod Serling's \"The Zero Hour\" for Mutual, National Public Radio's \"Earplay\", and veteran Himan Brown's \"CBS Radio Mystery Theater\" and \"General Mills Radio Adventure Theater\". These productions were later followed by the \"Sears/Mutual Radio Theater\", \"The National Radio Theater of Chicago\", \"NPR Playhouse\", and a newly produced episode of the former 1950s series \"X Minus One\". Works by a new generation of dramatists also emerged at this time, notably Yuri Rasovsky, Thomas Lopez of ZBS and the dramatic sketches heard on humourist Garrison Keillor's \"A Prairie Home Companion\". Brian Daley's 1981 adaptation of the blockbuster space opera film \"Star Wars\" for \"NPR Playhouse\" was a notable success. Production costs on this serial were mitigated by the support of Lucasfilm, which sold the rights to NPR for a nominal $1 fee, and by the participation of the BBC in an international co-production deal. \"Star Wars\" was credited with generating a 40% rise in NPR's ratings and quadrupling the network's youth audience overnight. Radio adaptations of the sequels followed with \"The Empire Strikes Back\" in 1983 and \"Return of the Jedi\" in 1996.\nThanks in large part to the National Endowments for the Arts and Humanities, public radio continued to air a smattering of audio drama until the mid-1980s. From 1986 to 2002, NPR's most consistent producer of radio drama was the idiosyncratic Joe Frank, working out of KCRW in Santa Monica. The Sci Fi Channel presented an audio drama series, \"Seeing Ear Theatre\", on its website from 1997 to 2001. Also, the dramatic serial \"It's Your World\" aired twice daily on the nationally syndicated \"Tom Joyner Morning Show\" from 1994 to 2008, continuing online through 2010.\n2000\u2013present: radio drama's \"new media\" revival.\nRadio drama remains popular in much of the world, though most material is now available through Internet download rather than heard over terrestrial or satellite radio. Stations producing radio drama often commission a large number of scripts. The relatively low cost of producing a radio play enables them to take chances with works by unknown writers. Radio can be a good training ground for beginning drama writers as the words written form a much greater part of the finished product; bad lines cannot be obscured with stagecraft.\nThe BBC's sole surviving radio soap is \"The Archers\" on BBC Radio 4: it is, with over 18,700 episodes to date, the world's longest-running such programme. Other radio soaps (\"ongoing serials\") produced by the BBC but no longer on air include:\nIn September, 2010 Radio New Zealand began airing its first ongoing soap opera, \"You Me Now\", which won the Best New Drama Award in the 2011 New Zealand Radio Awards.\nOn KDVS radio in Davis, California there are two radio theatre shows, \"Evening Shadows\", a horror/fantasy show paying tribute to classic old-time radio horror, and \"KDVS Radio Theater\" which commonly features dramas about social and political themes.\nThe audio drama format exists side by side with books presented on radio, read by actors or by the author. In Britain and other countries there is also quite a bit of radio comedy (both stand-up and sitcom). Together, these programs provide entertainment where television is either not wanted or would be distracting (such as while driving or operating machinery). \"Selected Shorts\", a long-running NPR program broadcast in front of a live audience at Symphony Space in New York, originated the \"driveway moment\" for over 300,000 people listeners each week during readings of contemporary and classic short stories by well-known professional actors.\nThe lack of visuals also enable fantastical settings and effects to be used in radio plays where the cost would be prohibitive for movies or television. \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" was first produced as radio drama, and was not adapted for television until much later, when its popularity would ensure an appropriate return for the high cost of the futuristic setting.\nOn occasion television series can be revived as radio series. For example, a long-running but no longer popular television series can be continued as a radio series because the reduced production costs make it cost-effective with a much smaller audience. When an organisation owns both television and radio channels, such as the BBC, the fact that no royalties have to be paid makes this even more attractive. Radio revivals can also use actors reprising their television roles even after decades as they still sound roughly the same. Series that have had this treatment include \"Doctor Who\", \"Dad's Army\", \"Thunderbirds\" and \"The Tomorrow People\". In 2013 BBC Radio 4 released a radio adaptation of \"Neverwhere\" by Neil Gaiman, featuring a cast of well known television and film actors. Neil Gaiman has said he was excited about the radio drama adaptation as it allowed the work to be presented with a greater deal of special effects than was possible on television. In the United States, an adaptation of \"The Twilight Zone\" aired to modest success in the 2000s (decade) as a syndicated program.\nRegular broadcasts of radio drama in English can be heard on the BBC's Radio 3, Radio 4 and Radio 4 Extra (formerly Radio 7), on RT\u00c9 Radio 1 in Ireland, and RNZ National in New Zealand. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation produced notable radio plays in Calgary and Toronto in the postwar decades, from which many actors and directors proceeded to international careers, but abolished its radio drama department in the 1970s and finally ceased production of radio dramas in 2012. BBC Radio 4 in today noted for its radio drama, broadcasting hundreds of new, one-off plays each year in such strands as \"The Afternoon Play\", as well as serials and soap operas. Radio 4 Extra broadcasts a variety of radio plays from the BBC's vast archives and a few extended versions of Radio 4 programmes. The British commercial station Oneword, though broadcasting mostly book readings, also transmitted a number of radio plays in instalments before it closed in 2008.\nIn the United States, contemporary radio drama can be found on broadcasters including ACB radio, produced by the American Council of the Blind; on the Sirius XM Book Radio channel from Sirius XM Satellite Radio (previously \"Sonic Theater\" on XM); and occasionally in syndication, as with Jim French's production \"Imagination Theater\". Several community radio stations carry weekly radio drama programs including KBOO, KFAI, WMPG, WLPP and WFHB.\nA growing number of religious radio stations air daily or weekly programs usually geared to younger audiences, such as Focus on the Family's \"Adventures in Odyssey\" (1,700+ syndicated stations), or Pacific Garden Mission's \"Unshackled!\" (1,800 syndicated stations \u2013 a long-running radio drama), which is geared to adults. The networks sometime sell transcripts of their shows on cassette tapes or CDs or make the shows available for listening or downloading over the Internet. Transcription recordings of many pre-television shows have been preserved. They are collected, re-recorded onto audio CDs and/or MP3 files and traded by hobbyists today as old-time radio programmes. Meanwhile, veterans such as the late Yuri Rasovsky (The National Radio Theater of Chicago) and Thomas Lopez (ZBS Foundation) have gained new listeners on cassettes, CDs and downloads. In the mid-1980s, the nonprofit L.A. Theatre Works launched its radio series recorded before live audiences. Productions have been broadcast via public radio, while also being marketed on compact discs and via download. Carl Amari's nationally syndicated radio series \"Hollywood 360\" features four old-time radio shows during his four-hour weekly broadcasts. Amari also broadcasts old-time radio shows on \"The WGN Radio Theatre\" heard every Saturday night beginning at 22:00 on 720-WGN in Chicago.\nIn addition to traditional radio broadcasters, modern radio drama (also known as audio theatre, or audio drama), has experienced a revival, with a growing number of independent producers who are able to build an audience through Internet distribution. While there are few academic programs in the United States that offer training in radio drama production, organisations such as the National Audio Theatre Festival teach the craft to new producers.\nThe digital age has also resulted in recording styles that differ from the studio recordings of radio drama's Golden Age. \"Not from Space\" (2003) on XM Satellite Radio was the first national radio play recorded exclusively through the Internet in which the voice actors were all in separate locations. Other producers use portable recording equipment to record actors on location rather than in studios.\nPodcasts are a growing distribution format for independent radio drama producers. Podcasts provides an alternative to mainstream television and radio which does not necessarily require a pitching process to be made and distributed (as these aspects of production can be learned by the creator) and which have no restrictions regarding programme length or content.\nRadio drama around the world.\nAustralia.\nIn Australia, as in most other developed countries, from the early years of the medium almost every radio network and station featured drama, serials, and soap operas as staples of their programming; during the so-called \"Golden Years\" of radio these were hugely popular. Many Australian serials and \"soapies\" were copies of American originals (e.g., the popular soap \"Portia Faces Life\" or the adventure series \"Superman\", which featured future Australian TV star Leonard Teale in the title role), although these were typically locally produced and performed live to air, since the technology of the time did not permit high-quality pre-recording or duplication of programmes for import or export.\nIn this period radio drama, serials and soap operas provided a fertile training ground and a steady source of employment for many actors, and this was particularly important because at this time the Australian theatre scene was in its infancy and opportunities were very limited. Many who trained in this medium (such as Peter Finch) subsequently became prominent both in Australia and overseas.\nIt has been noted that the producers of the popular 1960s Gerry Anderson TV series \"Thunderbirds\" were greatly impressed by the versatility of UK-based Australian actor Ray Barrett, who voiced many roles in Anderson's TV productions. Thanks to his early experience on Australian live radio (where he often played English and American roles), Barrett was considered better than his English counterparts at providing a convincing transatlantic accent, and he could perform a wide range of character voices; he also impressed the Anderson team with his ability to quickly and easily switch from one voice/accent to another without the sound engineers' having to stop the recording.\nThe effect of the introduction of television there in the late 1950s had the same devastating effects as it did in the US and many other markets, and by the early 1960s Australian commercial radio had totally abandoned radio drama and related programming (including comedy, soapies, and variety) in favour of music-based formats (such as Top 40) or talk radio (\"talkback\"), and the once-flourishing Australia radio production industry vanished within a few years. One of the few companies to survive was the Melbourne-based Crawford Productions, which was able to make the successful transition into TV production.\nDespite the complete abandonment of drama and related programming by the commercial radio sector, the government-funded Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) maintained a long history of producing radio drama. One of its most famous and popular series was the daily 15-minute afternoon soap opera \"Blue Hills\", which was written for its entire production history by dramatist Gwen Meredith. It featured many well-known Australian actresses and actors, ran continuously for 27 years, from 28 February 1949 to 30 September 1976, with a total of 5,795 episodes broadcast, and was at one time the world's longest-running radio serial. It was preceded by an earlier Meredith serial \"The Lawsons\", which featured many of the same themes and characters and itself ran for 1299 episodes.\nIn the 1960s and later, the ABC continued to produce many original Australian radio dramas as well as works adapted from other media. In recent years original radio dramas and adapted works were commissioned from local dramatists and produced for the ABC's Radio National network program \"Airplay\", which ran from the late 1990s until early 2013. In late 2012 ABC management imposed budget cuts and axed a number of long-running arts programs, thereby ending the national broadcaster's decades-long history of producing radio drama (as well as its equally long history of providing daily serialised book readings).\nCyprus.\nSince around the early sixties the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation (RIK) features radio plays in the Cypriot Greek dialect. They are called Cypriot (radio drama) sketches and they are mainly about Cyprus's rural life, traditions and customs, its history and its culture, and it continues until today.\nAlso very popular in Cyprus during the sixties, seventies and early eighties Police drama was very popular. The series \"Police Adventures\" became associated with the name of Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation (CyBC) radio producer Mikis Nikitas, who was responsible for its production for many years. The *\"Police Adventures\"* series also attracted the interest of foreign radio stations, as a number of its episodes were sold to Bavarian Radio in 1970, according to information cited in an annual CyBC report.\nThe oldest part of CyBC's Radio Theater was \"Theater by Radio\", which was broadcast on Monday evenings, Also broadcasting theatrical plays, mainly by classical Greek and Cypriot playwrights, as well as works by contemporary Cypriot writers selected through an annual competition, along with classic foreign repertoire. This tradition has been in place since 1953, the year RIK was established.\nThe works are written by established writers, but also from new writers through the Writing Contest of Cypriot Sketches issued annually by CyBC (RIK).\nCurrently, Cypriot sketches are broadcast every Sunday and have a mostly comedic character, satirising current events, they also include comedic song parodies. CyBC has also made other types of radio dramas, such as crime stories in the 2010s, which are available online.\nFinland.\nIn Finland radio dramas (in Finnish ) by the Finnish national broadcasting company Yleisradio have been popular since 1930s, and have always used well-known theatre or movie actors. The dramas include books converted to audio dramas, versions of popular theatre productions, pulp novels adapted for radio, or drama explicitly written as radio dramas. One of the most well known series was \"Suomisen perhe\" (the \"Family Suominen\") about a middle-class family, it became so popular that later the originally written for radio drama was converted into a movie series. Popular radio drama from other countries, like the BBC radio drama The Men from the Ministry was translated as \"Knalli ja sateenvarjo\" (\"Bowler hat and umbrella\") and became very popular. J. R. R. Tolkien's The Hobbit was converted to multi-part radio drama.\nGermany.\nThe first German radio drama was produced in 1923. Because of the external circumstances in postwar Germany in which most of the theatres were destroyed, radio drama boomed. Between 1945 and 1960 there were more than 500 radio plays every year. The German word for radio drama or audio play is . Today Germany is a major market for radio plays worldwide. In particular, audio plays on CD are very popular. A popular audio play serial of Germany and of the world is \"Die drei ???\" (\"Three Investigators\").\nBerlin's Prix Europa includes a Radio Fiction category.\nIndia.\nVividh Bharati, a service of All India Radio, has a long running Hindi radio-drama program: \"Hawa Mahal\".\nThe Satyanweshi audio drama series created by actor Aneesh See Yay adapted twenty two Byomkesh Bakshi novels and eight original audio dramas in the Malayalam language.\nRepublic of Ireland.\nRT\u00c9 Radio Drama is one of the oldest audio theatre departments in the radio world.\nJapan.\nRadio dramas began in Japan in 1925, and enjoyed a great level of popularity after the hit of \"Tankou no Naka\". This resulted in the NHK hiring famous writers to write radio drama scripts for 500 yen in 1930, equivalent to 1 million yen today.\nDue to voice acting in Japan having its own distinct culture, audio dramas continue to be popular in Japan, where they are now primarily released on disc as \"drama CDs\" (). They are also referred to in Japanese as \"voice dramas\" (). Many such audio dramas are based on anime, manga, novels and video games, but there are also many that are completely original. Though most drama CDs are commercial products made by corporate entities, there has been a growing number of \"doujin\" audio dramas in recent years due to it being easier for hobbyists to obtain the equipment required to make recordings, and the Internet making distribution easier.\nNorway.\nRadioteatret (Radio drama in Norway) has existed since 1926.\nPoland.\nIn Poland, radio dramas are sometimes called \"the theatre of the imagination\" (). The first Polish radio drama, \"Warszawianka\" based on Stanis\u0142aw Wyspia\u0144ski's play, was produced in 1925 while the first radio drama written for radio was produced in 1929. Polish Radio has been successfully producing radio dramas since then \u2013 between 1925 and September 1939, over 2,500 were made. In 1956, Polish Radio started broadcasting \"Matysiakowie\", which is currently one of the longest-running radio plays in the world. Audio plays based on literature are also popular in Poland, this is how the sound adaptations of George R. R. Martin's \"A Game of Thrones\", Mario Puzo's \"The Godfather\", Ken Follett's \"The Pillars of the Earth\" or Robert Kirkman's \"The Walking Dead\" were created. Since 1988, the Polish Radio Theatre has awarded the \"Wielki Splendor\" awards to actors and authors of radio dramas.\nRomania.\nRadio theatre (Teatru Radiofonic https://) has a long tradition in Romania. The first piece was played in 1929. The 7000+ piece repertoire includes radio adaptations of both Romanian and international books/plays across many genres interpreted by the greatest Romanian actors of the time.\nSouth Africa.\nRadio broadcasting began in South Africa in 1924 and remained the dominant broadcast medium in the country until the late 1970s. Created by an act of Parliament in 1936, the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) aired radio dramas along with news and British content in Afrikaans and English. Radio drama became more prominent with the launch of Springbok Radio, an English and Afrikaans commercial station operated by SABC between May 1950 and December 1985.\nThe SABC launched Radio Bantu in 1960s, broadcasting first in isiZulu and soon followed by other African languages, intended to serve as the apartheid state's propaganda channel. However, radio drama broadcast in African languages contributed to subverting the apartheid government by shaping culture and identity while challenging apartheid ideologies. Radio dramas were not subjected to the same level of apartheid editorial scrutiny, and therefore provided a forum for ideas without openly addressing politics. Radio drama evolved with changing socio-economic contexts. Female characters began to feature more prominently.\nRadio drama continues to be a mainstay of South African radio. SABC's drama studios in each of the country's 9 provinces produce dramas for all 19 SABC radio stations. Recognising radio's reach, some private sector entities have also invested in radio drama, such as Standard Bank's 5-minute\u00a0Iketsetse Zenzele radio drama which aired for 8 years to raise awareness about financial literacy, fraud, and cybercrimes. Non-governmental organisations widely use radio drama as part of campaigns for health awareness and rights activism, such as the long-running Soul Buddyz series focused on adolescent health, Masiphephe Radio Drama addressing gender-based violence, and the Plague in the Time of King Kapital and Queen Corona focused on Covid-19 awareness.\nThailand.\nA low power radio station \"M.C.O.K. Radio 2\" (formally Pira FM) introduces a new programming block called \"M.C.O.K. Television\" \u2013 aims to replace the regular evening music programmes. The programming block is composed of British radio dramas and an audio-described version of British TV programmes such as \"Doctor Who\", \"EastEnders\" and \"Horrible Histories\".\nSince 1 November 2021, Radio dramas were scrapped and replaced with more (Audio-Described) programmes \u2013 \"All At Sea\", \"Dad's Army\", \"Mrs. Brown's Boys\" and \"The Outlaw\". The radio station broadcasts on 87.2\u00a0MHz every evening / late night. Due to the nature of low-power VHF propagation, the coverage is very limited, the radio station can be heard only in Lat Luang (Bangkok / Samut Prakan area).\nIt is the first radio station in Thailand to broadcast both English radio / TV programmes on FM.\nMainland China.\nBefore 2010, radio dramas on mainland China were usually performed by organisations associated with the Chinese Communist Party, such as the Central Radio Drama Troupe (), which was founded in 1954. Their content was also deeply related to the historical events of the corresponding period and they largely served as propaganda. \"10,000 Pieces of Clipboards\" (), produced by the China National Radio in 1950 to commemorate the Great Strike of 7 February (), is considered to be the first radio drama after the CCP established the regime in mainland China. Similar radio dramas include The \"North Korean Zoya - Kim Yu Ji\" () and \"Thanks to Stalin\" ().\nWith the development of the Internet and the spread of Japanese ACG culture, ACG fans on mainland China began to independently produce radio dramas at around 2010. These radio dramas are usually not broadcast on radio stations, but uploaded to online audio platforms like MissEvan.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In 1956, its founders, both advertising executives, hired recent Hofstra University graduate Lawrence Herbert as a part-time employee. Herbert used his chemistry knowledge to systematize and simplify the company's stock of pigments and production of colored inks; by 1962, Herbert was running the ink and printing division at a profit, while the commercial-display division was US$50,000 in debt; he subsequently purchased the company's technological assets from the Levine Brothers for US$50,000 () and renamed them \"Pantone\".\nThe company's primary products include the Pantone Guides, which consist of a large number of small (approximately 6\u00d72\u00a0inches or 15\u00d75\u00a0cm) thin cardboard or plastic sheets, printed on one side with a series of related color swatches and then bound into a small \"fan deck\". For instance, a particular \"page\" might contain several yellows of varying tints.\nThe idea behind the PMS is to allow designers to \"color match\" specific colors when a design enters production stage, regardless of the equipment used to produce the color. This system has been widely adopted by graphic designers and reproduction and printing houses. Pantone recommends that PMS Color Guides be purchased annually, as their inks become yellowish over time. Color variance also occurs within editions based on the paper stock used (coated, matte or uncoated), while interedition color variance occurs when there are changes to the specific paper stock used.\nX-Rite, a supplier of color measurement instruments and software, purchased Pantone for US$180 million in October 2007. X-Rite was acquired by Danaher Corporation in 2012. In September 2023, Danaher completed the corporate spin-off of its Environmental and Applied Solutions segment as Veralto.\nAdobe dispute.\nIn 2022, a dispute between Pantone and Adobe resulted in the removal of Pantone color coordinates from Photoshop and Adobe's other design software, causing colors in graphic artists' digital documents to be replaced with black unless artists paid Pantone a separate $15 monthly subscription fee. Artists accused Pantone and Adobe of holding their work hostage.\nPantone Color Matching System.\nThe Pantone Color Matching System is largely a standardized color reproduction system; as of 2019 it has 2161 colors. By standardizing the colors, different manufacturers in different locations can all refer to the Pantone system to make sure colors match without direct contact with one another.\nOne such use is standardizing colors in the CMYK process. The CMYK process is a method of printing color by using four inks\u2014cyan, magenta, yellow, and black. A majority of the world's printed material is produced using the CMYK process, and there is a special subset of Pantone colors that can be reproduced using CMYK. Those that are possible to simulate through the CMYK process are labeled as such within the company's guides.\nHowever, about 30% of the Pantone system's 1114 spot colors (as of year 2000) cannot be simulated with CMYK but with 13 base pigments (14 including black) mixed in specified amounts, called base colors. Those 1114 colors included 387 colors with numbers 100 to 487 from 1975 and some lighter colors from 600 to 732 in 1991. The original four-digit colors introduced in 1987 were remapped into three digits.\nThe Pantone system also later allowed for many special colors to be produced, such as metallics, fluorescents (neons) and pastels. There are 56 fluorescents from 801 to 814 (first 7 here are base colors, so called Dayglo) and from 901 to 942. Packaging metallics (previously premium metallics) are placed from 10101 to 10454 (54 of those added later, 354 altogether, 2 base colors Silver 10077 and Rose Gold 10412), while normal metallics are placed from 871 to 877 (first 7 here are base colors) and from 8001 to 8965. Pastels are from 9140 to 9163 with base colors being 0131, 0331, 0521, 0631, 0821, 0921 and 0961. While most of the Pantone system colors are beyond the printed CMYK gamut, it was only in 2001 that Pantone began providing translations of their existing system with screen-based colors. Screen-based colors use the RGB color model\u2014red, green, blue\u2014system to create various colors. A lot of colors are outside sRGB. The (discontinued) Goe system has RGB, LAB, SPD values with each color and has 10 base colors while only 4 of those new: Bright Red, Pink, Medium Purple and Dark Blue. Other 6 were in the system before: Yellow 012, Orange 021, Rubine Red, Green, Process Blue and Black that in Goe were named Medium Yellow, Bright Orange, Strong Red, Bright Green, Medium Blue and Neutral Black. (PMS has 8 more basic base colors, some not monopigmented: Yellow 010, Red 032, Warm Red, Rhodamine Red, Purple, Violet, Reflex Blue, Blue 072.)\nPantone colors are described by their allocated number (typically referred to as, for example, \"PMS 130\"). PMS colors are almost always used in branding and have even found their way into government legislation and military standards (to describe the colors of flags and seals). In January 2003, the Scottish Parliament debated a petition (reference PE512) to refer to the blue in the Scottish flag as \"Pantone 300\". Countries such as Canada and South Korea and organizations such as the FIA have also chosen to refer to specific Pantone colors to use when producing flags. US states including Texas have set legislated PMS colors of their flags.\nPantone Goe System.\nOn September 5, 2007, Pantone introduced the Goe System. Goe consisted of 2058 new colors in a new matching and numbering system. In addition to the standard swatch books (now called the GoeGuide), the new system also included adhesive-backed GoeSticks, interactive software, tools, and an online community where users were able to share color swatches and information.\nThe Goe system was streamlined to use fewer base colors (ten, plus clear coating for reflections, only 4 base colors were new) and accommodate many technical challenges in reproducing colors on a press.\nThe Pantone Goe system was discontinued in November 2013, but four new base colors were added into PMS and some of new colors too, though those four base colors are harder to purchase.\nOther products.\nIn mid-2006 Pantone, partnering with Vermont-based Fine Paints of Europe, introduced a new line of interior and exterior paints. The color palette uses Pantone's color research and trending and has more than 3,000 colors.\nIn November 2015, Pantone partnered with Redland London to create a collection of bags inspired from Pantone's authority on color.\nPantone also produced Hexachrome, a patented six-color printing system. In addition to custom CMYK inks, Hexachrome added orange and green inks to expand the color gamut, for better color reproduction. It was therefore also known as a CMYKOG process. Hexachrome was discontinued by Pantone in 2008 when Adobe Systems stopped supporting their HexWare plugin software. In 2015 a 7-color printing system was developed, adding Violet in CMYKOGV, that can cover 90% of 1114 spot colors, while CMYK only about 60%. 1729 new colors were added, marked XGC (extended gamut coated), some colors do not have a number, like Process Blue XGC or Purple XGC. Base colors of OGV were new mono-pigment inks, pigments PO34, PG7 and PV23 were used respectively with 58\u00b0, 180\u00b0 and 311\u00b0 hue angles.\nPantone Color Manager allows for users of the Adobe Creative Suite and Creative Cloud as well as other software to import the most up to date information inclusive of L*a*b* numbers as well as CMYK and sRGB representations of all the various palettes (including chromatic adaptation under default D50 or D65 with 2 degree or 10 degree observer or even any ICC profile). L*a*b* numbers allow for the most accurate representation of color in a device-independent manner, but ideally X-rite InkFormulation is needed to emulate substrates and all 14 base colors of main Pantone system or 7 colors of CMYKOGV. Support is being phased out in favour of Pantone Connect plugin from Adobe Exchange of Creative Cloud. Adobe Illustrator removed five acb files (Adobe Color Books) of Pantone+ colors in 2023 when Pantone+ was deprecated by Pantone.\nColor of the Year.\nSince 2000, the Pantone Color Institute has declared a particular color \"Color of the Year\". Twice a year the company hosts, in a European capital, a secret meeting of representatives from various nations' color standards groups. After two days of presentations and debate, they choose a color for the following year; for example, the color for summer 2013 was chosen in London in the spring of 2012.\nThe selected color purportedly connects with the zeitgeist; for example, the press release declaring Honeysuckle the color of 2011 said \"In times of stress, we need something to lift our spirits. Honeysuckle is a captivating, stimulating color that gets the adrenaline going \u2013 perfect to ward off the blues.\" The results of the meeting are published in \"Pantone View\", which fashion designers, florists, and many other consumer-oriented companies purchase to help guide their designs and planning for future products. In 2016 and 2021, Pantone chose two colors for Color of the Year.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Color swatch/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2000Cerulean&lt;br&gt;#9BB7D4\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Color swatch/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2001Fuchsia Rose&lt;br&gt;#C74375\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Color swatch/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2002True Red&lt;br&gt;#BF1932\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Color swatch/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2003Aqua Sky&lt;br&gt;#7BC4C4\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Color swatch/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2004Tigerlily&lt;br&gt;#E2583E\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Color swatch/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2005Blue Turquoise&lt;br&gt;#53B0AE\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Color swatch/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2006Sand Dollar&lt;br&gt;#DECDBE\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Color swatch/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2007Chili Pepper&lt;br&gt;#9B1B30\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Color swatch/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2008Blue Iris&lt;br&gt;#5A5B9F\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Color swatch/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2009Mimosa&lt;br&gt;#F0C05A\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Color swatch/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2010Turquoise&lt;br&gt;#45B5AA\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Color swatch/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2011Honeysuckle&lt;br&gt;#D94F70\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Color swatch/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2012Tangerine Tango&lt;br&gt;#DD4124\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Color swatch/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2013Emerald&lt;br&gt;#009473\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Color swatch/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2014Radiant Orchid&lt;br&gt;#B163A3\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Color swatch/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2015Marsala&lt;br&gt;#955251\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Color swatch/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2016Rose Quartz&lt;br&gt;#F7CAC9\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Color swatch/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2016Serenity&lt;br&gt;#92A8D1\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Color swatch/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2017Greenery&lt;br&gt;#88B04B\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Color swatch/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2018Ultra Violet&lt;br&gt;#5F4B8B\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Color swatch/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2019Living Coral&lt;br&gt;#FF6F61\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Color swatch/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2020Classic Blue&lt;br&gt;#0F4C81\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Color swatch/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2021Ultimate Gray&lt;br&gt;#939597\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Color swatch/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2021Illuminating&lt;br&gt;#F5DF4D\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Color swatch/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2022Very Peri&lt;br&gt;#6667AB\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Color swatch/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2023Viva Magenta&lt;br&gt;#BB2649\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Color swatch/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2024Peach Fuzz&lt;br&gt;#FFBE98\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Color swatch/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2025Mocha Mousse&lt;br&gt;#A47864\nIn 2012, the color of the year, Tangerine Tango, was used to create a makeup line, in partnership with Sephora. The product line, named Sephora + Pantone Universe collection, features Tangerine Tango\u2013embellished false lashes, nail lacquers, cream, glitters, and high-pigment lip glosses. 2013 Emerald color was reported to be out of sRGB gamut. Also new Very Peri color of 2022 is present in TCX (dyed cotton reference) and TPG (Textile Paper \u2013 \"Green\") form, here TCX for sRGB hex values are mentioned.\nThe person behind Pantone's Color of the Year, executive director of the Pantone Color Institute Leatrice Eiseman, explained in an interview how 2014's Color of the Year, Radiant Orchid, was chosen:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I look for ascending color trends, colors that are being used in broader ways and broader context than before ... In this case, Radiant Orchid descends from the purple family, which is kind of a magical color that denotes creativity and innovation. Purple is just that kind of a complex, interesting, attracting kind of color ... [The] back-story to purple is that it inspires confidence in your creativity, and we're living in a world where that kind of creative innovation is greatly admired. In the world of color, purple is an attention-getter, and it has a meaning. It speaks to people, and we felt that it was time for the purple family to be celebrated. That's why we chose the particular shade called Radiant Orchid.\u2014\u200a\nPantone has said that color \"has always been an integral part of how a culture expresses the attitudes and emotions of the times.\"\nIntellectual property.\nPantone asserts that their lists of color numbers and pigment values are the intellectual property of Pantone and free use of the list is not allowed. This is frequently held as a reason Pantone colors cannot be supported in open-source software and are not often found in low-cost proprietary software. Pantone has been accused of \"being intentionally unclear\" about its exact legal claims, but it is acknowledged that \"the simplest claim would be trademark misappropriation or dilution towards someone who produced a color palette marketed as compatible with Pantone's\".\nBy contrast, intellectual property scholar Aaron Perzanowski claims that Pantone has no intellectual property rights over individual colors or color libraries.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is also known for doing more than any other author to secure the place of the word \"despotism\" in the political lexicon. His anonymously published \"The Spirit of Law\" (\"De l'esprit des lois\", 1748) first translated into English (Nugent) in a 1750 edition was received well in both Great Britain and the American colonies, and influenced the Founding Fathers of the United States in drafting the U.S. Constitution.\nBiography.\nMontesquieu was born at the Ch\u00e2teau de la Br\u00e8de in southwest France, south of Bordeaux. His father, Jacques de Secondat (1654\u20131713), was a soldier with a long noble ancestry, including descent from Richard de la Pole, Yorkist claimant to the English crown. His mother, Marie Fran\u00e7oise de Pesnel (1665\u20131696), who died when Charles was seven, was an heiress who brought the title of Barony of La Br\u00e8de to the Secondat family.\nHis family was of Huguenot origin. After the death of his mother he was sent to the Catholic College of Juilly, a prominent school for the children of French nobility, where he remained from 1700 to 1711. His father died in 1713, and he became a ward of his uncle, the Baron de Montesquieu. In 1714, he became a counselor of the Bordeaux Parlement. He showed a preference for Protestantism.\nIn 1715 he married the Protestant Jeanne de Lartigue, with whom he eventually had three children. The Baron died in 1716, leaving him his fortune as well as his title, and the office of pr\u00e9sident \u00e0 mortier in the Bordeaux Parlement, a post that he held for twelve years.\nMontesquieu's early life was a time of significant governmental change. England had declared itself a constitutional monarchy in the wake of its Glorious Revolution (1688\u20131689), and joined with Scotland in the Union of 1707 to form the Kingdom of Great Britain. In France, the long-reigning Louis XIV died in 1715, and was succeeded by the five-year-old Louis XV. These national transformations had a great impact on Montesquieu, and he referred to them repeatedly in his work.\nMontesquieu eventually withdrew from the practice of law to devote himself to study and writing. He achieved literary success with the publication of his 1721 \"Persian Letters\" (), a satire representing society as seen through the eyes of two Persian visitors to Paris, cleverly criticizing absurdities of contemporary French society. The work was an instant classic and accordingly was immediately pirated.\nIn 1722, he went to Paris and entered social circles with the help of friends including the Duke of Berwick whom he had known when Berwick was military governor at Bordeaux. He also acquainted himself with the English politician Viscount Bolingbroke, some of whose political views were later reflected in Montesquieu's analysis of the English constitution. In 1726 he sold his office, bored with the parlement and turning more toward Paris. In time, despite some impediments he was elected to the \"Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise\" in January 1728.\nIn April 1728, with Berwick's nephew Lord Waldegrave as his traveling companion, Montesquieu embarked on a grand tour of Europe, during which he kept a journal. His travels included Austria, Slovakia, Hungary, a brief visit to Germany and a year in Italy. He went to England at the end of October 1729, in the company of Lord Chesterfield, where he was initiated into Freemasonry at the \"Horn Tavern\" Lodge in Westminster. He remained in England until the spring of 1731, when he returned to La Br\u00e8de. Outwardly he seemed to be settling down as a squire: he altered his park in the English fashion, made inquiries into his own genealogy, and asserted his seignorial rights. But he was continuously at work in his study, a fertile ground for ideas containing a 3000 volume historic book collection. These sources, alongside his reflections on geography, laws and customs that were inspired and influenced by his travels, became the primary sources for his major works on political philosophy at this time like his magnum opus \"Des l'esprit des lois\".\nIn 1734, he published \"Considerations on the Causes of the Greatness of the Romans and their Decline\", among his three best known books. In 1748, he published \"The Spirit of Law\", quickly translated into English. It quickly rose to influence political thought profoundly in Europe and America. In France, the book met with an enthusiastic reception by many, but was denounced by the Sorbonne and, in 1751, by the Catholic Church (Index of Prohibited Books). It received the highest praise from much of the rest of Europe, especially Britain.\nMontesquieu was highly regarded in the British colonies in North America as a champion of liberty. According to a survey of late eighteenth-century works by political scientist Donald Lutz, Montesquieu was the most frequently quoted authority on government and politics in colonial pre-revolutionary British America, cited more by the American founders than any source except for the Bible. Following the American Revolution, his work remained a powerful influence on many of the American founders, most notably James Madison of Virginia, the \"Father of the Constitution\". Montesquieu's philosophy that \"government should be set up so that no man need be afraid of another\" reminded Madison and others that a free and stable foundation for their new national government required a clearly defined and balanced separation of powers.\nMontesquieu was troubled by a cataract and feared going blind. At the end of 1754 he visited Paris and was soon taken ill. He died from a fever on 10 February 1755. He was buried in the \u00c9glise Saint-Sulpice, Paris.\nPhilosophy of history.\nMontesquieu's philosophy of history minimized the role of individual persons and events. He expounded the view in \"Considerations on the Causes of the Greatness of the Romans and their Decline\", that each historical event was driven by a principal movement:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It is not chance that rules the world. Ask the Romans, who had a continuous sequence of successes when they were guided by a certain plan, and an uninterrupted sequence of reverses when they followed another. There are general causes, moral and physical, which act in every monarchy, elevating it, maintaining it, or hurling it to the ground. All accidents are controlled by these causes. And if the chance of one battle\u2014that is, a particular cause\u2014has brought a state to ruin, some general cause made it necessary for that state to perish from a single battle. In a word, the main trend draws with it all particular accidents.\nIn discussing the transition from the Republic to the Empire, he suggested that if Caesar and Pompey had not worked to usurp the government of the Republic, other men would have risen in their place. The cause was not the ambition of Caesar or Pompey, but the ambition of man.\nPolitical views.\nMontesquieu is credited as being among the progenitors, who include Herodotus and Tacitus, of anthropology\u2014as being among the first to extend comparative methods of classification to the political forms in human societies. Indeed, the French political anthropologist Georges Balandier considered Montesquieu to be \"the initiator of a scientific enterprise that for a time performed the role of cultural and social anthropology\". According to social anthropologist D. F. Pocock, Montesquieu's \"The Spirit of Law\" was \"the first consistent attempt to survey the varieties of human society, to classify and compare them and, within society, to study the inter-functioning of institutions.\" \"\u00c9mile Durkheim,\" notes David W. Carrithers, \"even went so far as to suggest that it was precisely this realization of the interrelatedness of social phenomena that brought social science into being.\"\nMontesquieu's political anthropology gave rise to his influential view that forms of government are supported by governing principles: virtue for republics, honor for monarchies, and fear for despotisms. American founders studied Montesquieu's views on how the English achieved liberty by separating executive, legislative, and judicial powers, and when Catherine the Great wrote her \"Nakaz\" (Instruction) for the Legislative Assembly she had created to clarify the existing Russian law code, she avowed borrowing heavily from Montesquieu's \"Spirit of Law\", although she discarded or altered portions that did not support Russia's absolutist bureaucratic monarchy.\nMontesquieu's most influential work divided French society into three classes (or \"trias politica\", a term he coined): the monarchy, the aristocracy, and the commons. Montesquieu saw two types of governmental power existing: the sovereign and the administrative. The administrative powers were the executive, the legislative, and the judicial. These should be separate from and dependent upon each other so that the influence of any one power would not be able to exceed that of the other two, either singly or in combination. This was a radical idea because it does not follow the three Estates structure of the French Monarchy: the clergy, the aristocracy, and the people at large represented by the Estates-General, thereby erasing the last vestige of a feudalistic structure.\nThe theory of the separation of powers largely derives from \"The Spirit of Law\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In every state there are three kinds of power: the legislative authority, the executive authority for things that stem from the law of nations, and the executive authority for those that stem from civil law.\nBy virtue of the first, the prince or magistrate enacts temporary or perpetual laws, and amends or abrogates those that have been already enacted. By the second, he makes peace or war, sends or receives embassies, establishes the public security, and provides against invasions. By the third, he punishes criminals, or determines the disputes that arise between individuals. The latter we shall call the judiciary power, and the other, simply, the executive power of the state.\u2014\u200a\nMontesquieu argues that each power should only exercise its own functions; he is quite explicit here:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;When in the same person or in the same body of magistracy the legislative authority is combined with the executive authority, there is no freedom, because one can fear lest the same monarch or the same senate make tyrannical laws in order to carry them out tyrannically.\n Again there is no freedom if the authority to judge is not separated from the legislative and executive authorities. If it were combined with the legislative authority, power over the life and liberty of the citizens would be arbitrary, for the judge would be the legislator. If it were combined with the executive authority, the judge could have the strength of an oppressor.\n All would be lost if the same man or the same body of principals, or of nobles, or of the people, exercised these three powers: that of making laws, that of executing public resolutions, and that of judging crimes or disputes between individuals.\u2014\u200a\nIf the legislative branch appoints the executive and judicial powers, as Montesquieu indicated, there will be no separation or division of its powers, since the power to appoint carries with it the power to revoke.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The executive authority must be in the hands of a monarch, for this part of the government, which almost always requires immediate action, is better administrated by one than by several, whereas that which depends on the legislative authority is often better organized by several than by one person alone.\nIf there were no monarch, and the executive authority were entrusted to a certain number of persons chosen from the legislative body, that would be the end of freedom, because the two authorities would be combined, the same persons sometimes having, and always in a position to have, a role in both.\u2014\u200a\nMontesquieu identifies three main forms of government, each supported by a social \"principle\": monarchies (free governments headed by a hereditary figure, e.g. king, queen, emperor), which rely on the principle of honor; republics (free governments headed by popularly elected leaders), which rely on the principle of virtue; and despotisms (unfree), headed by despots which rely on fear. The free governments are dependent on constitutional arrangements that establish checks and balances. Montesquieu devotes one chapter of \"The Spirit of Law\" to a discussion of how England's constitution sustained liberty (XI, 6), and another to the realities of English politics (XIX, 27). As for France, the intermediate powers (including the nobility) the nobility and the parlements had been weakened by Louis XIV, and welcomed the strengthening of parlementary power in 1715.\nMontesquieu advocated reform of slavery in \"The Spirit of Law\", specifically arguing that slavery was inherently wrong because all humans are born equal, but that it could perhaps be justified within the context of climates with intense heat, wherein laborers would feel less inclined to work voluntarily. As part of his advocacy he presented a satirical https://. In the hypothetical list, ironically listed pro-slavery arguments without further comment, including an argument stating that sugar would become too expensive without the free labor of slaves.\nWhile addressing French readers of his \"General Theory\", John Maynard Keynes described Montesquieu as \"the real French equivalent of Adam Smith, the greatest of your economists, head and shoulders above the physiocrats in penetration, clear-headedness and good sense (which are the qualities an economist should have).\"\nClimate theory and environmental determinism.\nA central idea to Montesquieu's anthropological thinking, outlined in \"The Spirit of Law\" and hinted at in \"Persian Letters\", is his climate theory and environmental determinism, a theory also promoted by the French naturalist Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon. \nMontesquieu proposed that climate and geography significantly influence both the character of individuals and the formation of laws and political institutions. While he acknowledged environmental effects, he did not regard them as absolute determinants: for him, laws and customs could counterbalance or harness these influences. \nHe argued that cold climates tighten the body\u2019s fibers, enhancing strength and vigor; inhabitants of such climates thus tend to be courageous, resilient, and phlegmatic. In contrast, hot climates relax the body, fostering sensitivity, emotional volatility, and indecisiveness. Temperate climates, like that of France, were considered optimal, producing balanced temperament and stable institutions. \nMontesquieu further linked environmental factors to forms of governance and social character. Fertile, flat terrain, he claimed, made regions easier to conquer and led to monarchy or despotism; in contrast, harsh or barren lands fostered industriousness, self-reliance, and the development of republican virtues. \nThough Montesquieu received much attention, similar ideas existed earlier. Ancient authors such as Hippocrates (\"On Airs, Waters, Places\"), Herodotus, in \"The Histories\" of Herodotus, and in Tacitus's \"Germania\" (one of Montesquieu's favorite authors). It is evidential that a direct influence on Montesquieu was from Fran\u00e7ois-Ignace d'Espiard de La Borde's (1707\u20131777) \"Essai sur le g\u00e9nie et le caract\u00e8re des nations\" published in Brussels in 1743, which was republished in 1752 under the title \"Esprit des nations\" expressing the same climate theory and environmental determinism ideas\".\" Montesquieu, far from the first to have these ideas, introduced them to a broad public during his time in \"De l'esprit des lois (The Spirit of the Laws)\".\nPhilip M. Parker, in his book \"Physioeconomics\" (MIT Press, 2000), endorses Montesquieu's theory and argues that much of the economic variation between countries is explained by the physiological effect of different climates.\nFrom a sociological perspective, Louis Althusser, in his analysis of Montesquieu's revolution in method, alluded to the seminal character of anthropology's inclusion of material factors, such as climate, in the explanation of social dynamics and political forms. Examples of certain climatic and geographical factors giving rise to increasingly complex social systems include those that were conducive to the rise of agriculture and the domestication of wild plants and animals.\nMemorialization.\nBetween 1981 and 1994, a depiction of Montesquieu appeared on the 200 French franc note.\nSince 1989, the annual Montesquieu prize has been awarded by the French Association of Historians of Political Ideas for the best French-language thesis on the history of political thought.\nOn Europe Day 2007, the Montesquieu Institute opened in The Hague, the Netherlands, with a mission to advance research and education on the parliamentary history and political culture of the European Union and its member states.\nThe Montesquieu tower in Luxembourg was completed in 2008 as an addition to the headquarters of the Court of Justice of the European Union. The building houses many of the institution's translation services. Until 2019, it stood, with its sister tower, Comenius, as the tallest building in the country.\nList of principal works.\nA critical edition of Montesquieu's works is being published by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Montesquieu. It is planned to total 22 volumes, of which (as of February 2022) all but five have appeared.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\nArticles and chapters\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBooks\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
