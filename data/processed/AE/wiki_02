His works include \"Ripostes\" (1912), \"Hugh Selwyn Mauberley\" (1920), and \"The Cantos\" (c.\u20091915\u20131962).\nPound's contribution to poetry began in the early 20th century with his role in developing Imagism, a movement stressing precision and economy of language. Working in London as foreign editor of several American literary magazines, he helped to discover and shape the work of contemporaries such as H.D., Robert Frost, T.\u00a0S.\u00a0Eliot, Ernest Hemingway, and James Joyce. He was responsible for the 1914 serialization of Joyce's \"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\", the 1915 publication of Eliot's \"The Love Song of J.\u00a0Alfred Prufrock\", and the serialization from 1918 of Joyce's \"Ulysses\". Hemingway wrote in 1932 that, for poets born in the late 19th or early 20th century, not to be influenced by Pound would be \"like passing through a great blizzard and not feeling its cold\".\nAngered by the carnage of World War I, Pound blamed the war on finance capitalism, which he called \"usury\". He moved to Italy in 1924 and through the 1930s and 1940s promoted an economic theory known as social credit, wrote for publications owned by the British fascist Oswald Mosley, embraced Benito Mussolini's fascism, and expressed support for Adolf Hitler. During World War\u00a0II, Pound recorded hundreds of paid radio propaganda broadcasts for the fascist Italian government and its later incarnation as a German puppet state, in which he attacked the United States government, Franklin D.\u00a0Roosevelt, Britain, international finance, the arms industry, Jews, and others as abettors and prolongers of the war. He also praised both eugenics and the Holocaust in Italy, while urging American GIs to throw down their rifles and surrender. In 1945, Pound was captured by the Italian Resistance and handed over to the U.S. Army's Counterintelligence Corps, who held him pending extradition and prosecution based on an indictment for treason. He spent months in a U.S. military detention camp near Pisa, including three weeks in an outdoor steel cage. Ruled mentally unfit to stand trial, Pound was incarcerated for over 12 years at St.\u00a0Elizabeths Hospital in Washington, D.C.\nWhile in custody in Italy, Pound began work on sections of \"The Cantos\", which were published as \"The Pisan Cantos\" (1948), for which he was awarded the Bollingen Prize for Poetry in 1949 by the American Library of Congress, causing enormous controversy. After a campaign by his fellow writers, he was released from St.\u00a0Elizabeths in 1958 and returned to Italy, where he posed for the press giving the Fascist salute and called the United States \"an insane asylum\". Pound remained in Italy until his death in 1972. His economic and political views have ensured that his life and literary legacy remain highly controversial.\nEarly life and education (1885\u20131908).\nFamily background.\nPound was born in 1885 in a two-story clapboard house in Hailey in the Idaho Territory as the only child of Homer Loomis Pound and Isabel Weston, who married in 1884. Homer had worked in Hailey since 1883 as registrar of the United States General Land Office. Ezra Pound's paternal grandfather, Thaddeus Coleman Pound, a Republican Party member of the U.S. House of Representatives and the 10th lieutenant governor of Wisconsin, had secured Homer the job. Homer had previously worked for Thaddeus in the lumber business.\nBoth sides of Pound's family had emigrated from England in the 17th century. On his father's side, the immigrant ancestor was John Pound, a Quaker who had arrived from England around 1650. Ezra's paternal grandmother, Susan Angevine Loomis, married Thaddeus Coleman Pound. On his mother's side, Pound was descended from William Wadsworth, a Puritan who had immigrated to Boston on the \"Lion\" in 1632, whose son Joseph Wadsworth helped to write the first Connecticut constitution. The Wadsworths married into the Westons of New York; Harding Weston and Mary Parker were Pound's maternal grandparents. After serving in the military, Harding remained unemployed, so his brother Ezra Weston and Ezra's wife, Frances Amelia Wessells Freer (Aunt Frank), helped to look after Isabel, Pound's mother.\nEarly education.\nIsabel Pound was unhappy in Hailey and took Ezra with her to New York in 1887 when he was 18 months old. Her husband followed and found a job as an assayer at the Philadelphia Mint. After a move to 417 Walnut Street in Jenkintown, Pennsylvania, in 1893 the family bought a six-bedroom house at 166 Fernbrook Avenue in nearby Wyncote. Pound's education began in dame schools: Miss Elliott's school in Jenkintown in 1892 and the Heathcock family's Chelten Hills School in Wyncote in 1893. Known as \"Ra\" (pronounced \"Ray\"), he attended Wyncote Public School from September 1894. His first publication was on 7 November 1896 in the \"Jenkintown Times-Chronicle\" (\"by E.\u00a0L.\u00a0Pound, Wyncote, aged 11 years\"), a limerick about William Jennings Bryan, who had just lost the 1896 presidential election.\nIn 1897, aged 12, he transferred to Cheltenham Military Academy (CMA), where he wore an American Civil War-style uniform and was taught drilling and how to shoot. The following year he made his first trip overseas, a three-month tour with his mother and Aunt Frank, who took him to England, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, and Morocco. He attended CMA until 1900, at times as a boarder, but it seems he did not graduate.\nUniversity.\nIn 1901, at 15 years old, Pound was admitted to the College of Liberal Arts at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. Years later he said his aim was to avoid drill at the military academy. His one distinction in first year was in geometry, but otherwise his grades were mostly poor, including in Latin, his major; he achieved a B in English composition and a pass in English literature. In his second year he switched from the degree course to \"non-degree special student status\", he said \"to avoid irrelevant subjects\". He was not elected to a fraternity at Penn, but it seemed not to bother him.\nHis parents and Aunt Frank took him on another three-month European tour in 1902, and the following year he transferred to Hamilton College in Clinton, New York, possibly because of his grades. Again he was not invited to join a fraternity, but this time he had hoped to do so, according to letters home, because he wanted to live in a fraternity house, and by April 1904 he regarded the move as a mistake. Signed up for the Latin\u2013Scientific course, he appears to have avoided some classes; his transcript is short of credits. He studied the Proven\u00e7al dialect of the Occitan Language and read Dante Alighieri and Anglo-Saxon poetry, including \"Beowulf\" and the 8th-century Old English poem \"The Seafarer\".\nAfter graduating from Hamilton in 1905 with a PhB, he returned to Penn, where he fell in love with Hilda Doolittle (who later wrote under the name \"H.D.\"). She was then a student at Bryn Mawr College, and he hand-bound 25 of his poems for her, calling it \"Hilda's Book\". After receiving his M.A. in Romance languages in 1906, he registered to write a PhD thesis on the jesters in Lope de Vega's plays; a two-year Harrison fellowship covered his tuition and a $500 grant, with which he sailed again to Europe. He spent three weeks in Madrid in various libraries, including in the Royal Library. On 31 May 1906 he was standing outside the palace during the attempted assassination of King Alfonso XIII and left the city for fear of being mistaken for an anarchist. After Spain he visited Paris and London, returning to the United States in July 1906. His first essay, \"Raphaelite Latin\", was published in the \"Book News Monthly\" that September. He took courses in English in 1907, where he fell out with just about everyone, including the department head, Felix Schelling, with silly remarks during lectures and by winding an enormous tin watch very slowly while Schelling spoke. In the spring of 1907 he learned that his fellowship would not be renewed. Schelling told him he was wasting everyone's time, and he left without finishing his doctorate.\nTeaching.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn Durance\n&lt;poem&gt;I am homesick after mine own kind,\nOh I know that there are folk about me, friendly faces,\nBut I am homesick after mine own kind.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\n\u2014\u00a0\"Personae of Ezra Pound\" (1909)written in Crawfordsville, Indiana, 1907\nFrom September 1907 Pound taught French and Spanish at Wabash College, a Presbyterian college with 345 students in Crawfordsville, Indiana, which he called \"the sixth circle of hell\". One former student remembered him as a breath of fresh air; another said he was \"exhibitionist, egotistic, self-centered and self-indulgent\".\nHe was dismissed after a few months. Smoking was forbidden, but he would smoke cigarillos in his room in the same corridor as the president's office. He was asked to leave the college in January 1908 when his landladies, Ida and Belle Hall, found a woman in his room. Shocked at having been expelled, he left for Europe soon after, sailing from New York in March on the RMS \"Slavonia\".\nLondon (1908\u20131914).\n\"A Lume Spento\".\nPound arrived in Gibraltar on 23 March 1908, where he earned US$15 a day working as a guide for an American family there and in Spain. After stops in Seville, Granada, and Genoa, by the end of April he was in Venice, living over a bakery near the San Vio bridge. In the summer he decided to self-publish his first collection of 44 poems in the 72-page \"A Lume Spento\" (\"With Tapers Quenched\"), 150 copies of which were printed in July 1908. The title is from the third canto of Dante Alighieri's \"Purgatorio\", alluding to the death of Manfred, King of Sicily. Pound dedicated the book to the Philadelphia artist William Brooke Smith, a friend from university who had recently died of tuberculosis.\nIn \"Canto LXXVI\" of \"The Pisan Cantos\", he records that he considered throwing the proofs into the Grand Canal, abandoning the book and poetry altogether: \"by the soap-smooth stone posts where San Vio / meets with il Canal Grande / between Salviati and the house that was of Don Carlos / shd/I chuck the lot into the tide-water? / le bozze \"A Lume Spento\"/ / and by the column of Todero / shd/I shift to the other side / or wait 24 hours\".\nMove to London.\nIn August 1908 Pound moved to London, carrying 60 copies of \"A Lume Spento\". English poets such as Maurice Hewlett, Rudyard Kipling, and Alfred Tennyson had made a particular kind of Victorian verse\u2014stirring, pompous, and propagandistic\u2014popular. According to modernist scholar James Knapp, Pound rejected the idea of poetry as \"versified moral essay\"; he wanted to focus on the individual experience, the concrete rather than the abstract.\nPound at first stayed in a boarding house at 8 Duchess Street, near the British Museum Reading Room; he had met the landlady during his travels in Europe in 1906. He soon moved to Islington (cheaper at 12s 6d a week board and lodging), but his father sent him \u00a34, and he was able to move back into Central London, to 48 Langham Street, near Great Titchfield Street. The house sat across an alley from the Yorkshire Grey pub, which made an appearance in \"Canto LXXX\" (\"The Pisan Cantos\"), \"concerning the landlady's \"doings\"\u00a0/ with a lodger unnamed\u00a0/ az waz near Gt Tichfield St. next door to the pub\".\nPound persuaded the bookseller Elkin Mathews on Vigo Street to display \"A Lume Spento\", and in an unsigned article on 26 November 1908, Pound reviewed it himself in the \"Evening Standard\": \"The unseizable magic of poetry is in this queer paper book; and words are no good in describing it.\" The following month he self-published a second collection, \"A Quinzaine for this Yule\". It was his first book to have commercial success, and Elkin Matthews had another 100 copies printed. In January and February 1909, after the death of John Churton Collins left a vacancy, Pound lectured for an hour a week in the evenings on \"The Development of Literature in Southern Europe\" at the Regent Street Polytechnic. Mornings might be spent in the British Museum Reading Room, followed by lunch at the Vienna Caf\u00e9 on Oxford Street, where Pound first met the painter and writer Wyndham Lewis in 1910. \"There were mysterious figures\u00a0/ that emerged from recondite recesses\u00a0/ and ate at the WIENER CAF\u00c9\". Ford Madox Ford described Pound as \"approach[ing] with the step of a dancer, making passes with a cane at an imaginary opponent\": \"He would wear trousers made of green billiard cloth, a pink coat, a blue shirt, a tie hand-painted by a Japanese friend, an immense sombrero, a flaming beard cut to a point, and a single, large blue earring.\"\nMeeting Dorothy Shakespear, \"Personae\".\nAt a literary salon in 1909, Pound met the novelist Olivia Shakespear and later at the Shakespears' home at 12 Brunswick Gardens, Kensington, was introduced to her daughter, Dorothy, who became Pound's wife in 1914. The critic Iris Barry described her as \"carrying herself delicately with the air, always, of a young Victorian lady out skating, and a profile as clear and lovely as that of a porcelain Kuan-yin\". \"Listen to it\u2014Ezra! Ezra!\u2014And a third time\u2014Ezra!\", Dorothy wrote in her diary on 16 February 1909.\nPound mixed with the cream of London's literary circle, including Hewlett, Laurence Binyon, Frederic Manning, Ernest Rhys, May Sinclair, Ellen Terry, George Bernard Shaw, Hilaire Belloc, T.\u00a0E.\u00a0Hulme, and F.\u00a0S.\u00a0Flint. Through the Shakespears, he was introduced to the poet W.\u00a0B.\u00a0Yeats, Olivia Shakespear's former lover. He had already sent Yeats a copy of \"A Lume Spento\", and Yeats had apparently found it \"charming\". Pound wrote to William Carlos Williams on 3 February 1909: \"Am by way of falling into the crowd that does things here. London, deah old Lundon, is the place for poesy.\" According to Richard Aldington, London found Pound amusing. The newspapers interviewed him, and he was mentioned in \"Punch\" magazine, which on 23 June 1909 described \"Mr.\u00a0Ezekiel Ton\" as \"the most remarkable thing in poetry since Robert Browning\u00a0... [blending] the imagery of the unfettered West, the vocabulary of Wardour Street, and the sinister abandon of Borgiac Italy\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nErat Hora\n&lt;poem&gt;\"Thank you, whatever comes.\" And then she turned\nAnd, as the ray of sun on hanging flowers\nFades when the wind hath lifted them aside,\nWent swiftly from me. Nay, whatever comes\nOne hour was sunlit and the most high gods\nMay not make boast of any better thing\nThan to have watched that hour as it passed.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\n\u2014\u00a0\"Personae: The Collected Poems of Ezra Pound\" (1926)\nIn April 1909 Elkin Mathews published \"Personae of Ezra Pound\" (half the poems were from \"A Lume Spento\") and in October a further 27 poems (16 new) as \"Exultations\". The British poet Edward Thomas described \"Personae\" in \"English Review\" as \"full of human passion and natural magic\". Rupert Brooke complained in the \"Cambridge Review\" that Pound had fallen under the influence of the American poet Walt Whitman, writing in \"unmetrical sprawling lengths that, in his hands, have nothing to commend them\". But he did acknowledge that Pound had \"great talents\".\nIn or around September, Pound moved into new rooms at Church Walk, off Kensington High Street, where he lived most of the time until 1914. He visited a friend, Walter Rummel, in Paris in March 1910 and was introduced to the American heiress and pianist Margaret Lanier Cravens. Although they had only just met, she offered to become a patron at $1,000 a year, and from then until her death in 1912 she apparently sent him money regularly.\n\"The Spirit of Romance\", \"Canzoni\", the \"New Age\".\nIn June 1910 Pound returned for eight months to the United States; his arrival coincided with the publication in London of his first book of literary criticism, \"The Spirit of Romance\", based on his lecture notes from the polytechnic. \"Patria Mia\", his essays on the United States, were written at this time. In August he moved to New York, renting rooms on Waverly Place and Park Avenue South, facing Gramercy Square. Although he loved New York, he felt alienated by the commercialism and newcomers from Eastern and Southern Europe who were displacing the white Anglo-Saxon Protestants. The recently built New York Public Library Main Branch he found especially offensive. During this period his antisemitism became apparent; he referred in \"Patria Mia\" to the \"detestable qualities\" of Jews. After persuading his parents to finance his passage back to Europe, he sailed from New York on the RMS \"Mauretania\" on 22 February 1911. It was nearly 30 years\u2014April 1939\u2014before he visited the U.S. again.\nAfter three days in London he went to Paris, where he worked on a new collection of poetry, \"Canzoni\" (1911), panned by \"The Westminster Gazette\" as \"affectation combined with pedantry\". He wrote in Ford Madox Ford's obituary that Ford had rolled on the floor with laughter at its \"stilted language\". When he returned to London in August, he rented a room in Marylebone at 2A Granville Place, then shared a house at 39 Addison Road North, W11. By November A. R. Orage, editor of the socialist journal \"The New Age\", had hired him to write a weekly column. Orage appears in \"The Cantos\" (Possum is T.\u00a0S.\u00a0Eliot): \"but the lot of 'em, Yeats, Possum and Wyndham\u00a0/ had no ground beneath 'em.\u00a0/ Orage had.\"\nPound contributed to the \"New Age\" from 30 November 1911 to 13 January 1921, attending editorial meetings in the basement of a grimy ABC tearoom in Chancery Lane. There and at other meetings he met Arnold Bennett, Cecil Chesterton, Beatrice Hastings, S. G. Hobson, Hulme, Katherine Mansfield, and H.\u00a0G.\u00a0Wells. In the \"New Age\" office in 1918, he also met C. H. Douglas, a British engineer who was developing his economic theory of social credit, which Pound found attractive. Douglas reportedly believed that Jews were a problem and needed to abandon a Messianic view of themselves as the \"dominating race\". According to Colin Holmes, \"The New Age\" itself published antisemitic material. It was within this environment, not in Italy, according to Tim Redman, that Pound first encountered antisemitic ideas about \"usury\". \"In Douglas's program,\" Christopher Hitchens wrote in 2008, \"Pound had found his true muse: a blend of folkloric Celtic twilight with a paranoid hatred of the money economy and a dire suspicion about an ancient faith.\"\n\"Poetry\" magazine, \"Ripostes\", Imagism.\nIn May 1911, H.D. left Philadelphia for London. She was accompanied by the poet Frances Gregg and Gregg's mother; when they returned in September, H.D. stayed on. Pound introduced her to his friends, including Aldington, who became her husband in 1913. Before that, the three of them lived in Church Walk, Kensington\u2014Pound at No.\u00a010, Aldington at No.\u00a08, and Doolittle at No.\u00a06\u2014and worked daily in the Reading Room of the British Museum.\nAt the British Museum, Laurence Binyon introduced Pound to the East Asian artistic and literary concepts Pound used in his later poetry, including Japanese ukiyo-e prints. The visitors' book first shows Pound in the Prints and Drawings Students' Room (known as the Print Room) on 9 February 1909, and later in 1912 and 1913, with Dorothy Shakespear, examining Chinese and Japanese art. Pound was working at the time on the poems that became \"Ripostes\" (1912), trying to move away from his earlier work. \"I hadn't in 1910 made a language\", he wrote years later. \"I don't mean a language to use, but even a language to think in.\"\nIn August 1912 Harriet Monroe hired Pound as foreign correspondent of \"Poetry: A Magazine of Verse\", a new magazine in Chicago. The first edition, in October, featured two of his own poems\u2014\"To Whistler, American\" and \"Middle Aged\". Also that month Stephen Swift and Co. in London published \"Ripostes of Ezra Pound\", a collection of 25 poems, including a contentious translation of \"The Seafarer\", that demonstrate his shift toward minimalist language. In addition to Pound's work, the collection contains five poems by Hulme.\n\"Ripostes\" includes the first mention of \"Les Imagistes\": \"As for the future, \"Les Imagistes\", the descendants of the forgotten school of 1909, have that in their keeping.\" While in the British Museum tearoom one afternoon with Doolittle and Aldington, Pound edited one of Doolittle's poems and wrote \"H.D. Imagiste\" underneath; he described this later as the founding of a movement in poetry, \"Imagisme\". In the spring or early summer of 1912, they agreed, Pound wrote in 1918, on three principles:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;# Direct treatment of the \"thing\" whether subjective or objective.\n\"Poetry\" published Pound's \"A Few Don'ts by an Imagist\" in March 1913. Superfluous words, particularly adjectives, should be avoided, as well as expressions like \"dim lands of peace\". He wrote: \"It dulls the image. It mixes an abstraction with the concrete. It comes from the writer's not realizing that the natural object is always the \"adequate\" symbol.\" Poets should \"go in fear of abstractions\". He wanted \"to stand for hard light, clear edges\", he wrote later to Amy Lowell.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn a Station of the Metro\n&lt;poem&gt;The apparition\u2003of these faces\u2003in the crowd:\nPetals\u2003on a wet, black\u2003bough.&lt;/poem&gt;\n \u2014\u00a0\"Poetry\" (April 1913)\nAn example of Imagist poetry is Pound's \"In a Station of the Metro\", published in \"Poetry\" in April 1913 and inspired by an experience on the Paris M\u00e9tro. \"I got out of a train at, I think, La Concorde\", he wrote in \"How I began\" in \"T.\u00a0P.'s Weekly\" on 6 June 1913, \"and in the jostle I saw a beautiful face, and then, turning suddenly, another and another, and then a beautiful child's face, and then another beautiful face. All that day I tried to find words for what this made me feel.\u00a0... I could get nothing but spots of colour.\" A year later he reduced it to its essence in the style of a Japanese haiku.\nJames Joyce, Pound's unpopularity.\nIn the summer of 1913 Pound became literary editor of \"The Egoist\", a journal founded by Dora Marsden, a suffragette. At the suggestion of W.\u00a0B.\u00a0Yeats, Pound encouraged James Joyce in December of that year to submit his work. The previous month Yeats, whose eyesight was failing, had rented Stone Cottage in Coleman's Hatch, Sussex, inviting Pound to accompany him as his secretary, and it was during this visit that Yeats introduced Pound to Joyce's \"Chamber Music\" and his \"I hear an Army Charging Upon the Land\". This was the first of three winters Pound and Yeats spent at Stone Cottage, including two with Dorothy after she and Ezra married in 1914. \"Canto LXXXIII\" records a visit: \"so that I recalled the noise in the chimney\u00a0/ as it were the wind in the chimney\u00a0/ but was in reality Uncle William\u00a0/ downstairs composing\u00a0/ that had made a great Peeeeacock\u00a0/ in the proide ov his oiye.\"\nIn his reply to Pound, Joyce gave permission to use \"I hear an Army\" and enclosed \"Dubliners\" and the first chapter of his novel \"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\". Pound wrote to Joyce that the novel was \"damn fine stuff\". Harriet Shaw Weaver accepted it for \"The Egoist\", which serialized it from 2 February 1914, despite the printers objecting to words like \"fart\" and \"ballocks\", and fearing prosecution over Stephen Dedalus's thoughts about prostitutes. On the basis of the serialization, the publisher that had rejected \"Dubliners\" reconsidered. Joyce wrote to Yeats: \"I can never thank you enough for having brought me into relation with your friend Ezra Pound who is indeed a miracle worker.\"\nAround this time, Pound's articles in the \"New Age\" began to make him unpopular, to the alarm of Orage. Samuel Putnam knew Pound in Paris in the 1920s and described him as stubborn, contrary, cantankerous, bossy, touchy, and \"devoid of humor\"; he was \"an American small-towner\", in Putnam's view. His attitude caused him trouble in both London and Paris. English women, with their \"preponderantly derivative\" minds, were inferior to American women who had minds of their own, he wrote in the \"New Age\". The English sense of what was right was based on respect for property, not morality. \"[P]erched on the rotten shell of a crumbling empire\", London had lost its energy. England's best authors\u2014Joseph Conrad, William Henry Hudson, Henry James, and Yeats\u2014were not English. English writers and critics were ignorant, he wrote in 1913.\nMarriage.\nEzra and Dorothy were married on 20 April 1914 at St Mary Abbots in Kensington, the Shakespears' parish church, despite opposition from her parents, who worried about Ezra's income. His concession to marry in church had helped. Dorothy's annual income was \u00a350, with another \u00a3150 from her family, and Ezra's was \u00a3200. Her father, Henry Hope Shakespear, had him prepare a financial statement in 1911, which showed that his main source of income was his father. After the wedding the couple moved into an apartment with no bathroom at 5 Holland Place Chambers, Kensington, next door to the newly wed H.D. and Aldington. This arrangement did not last. H.D. had been alarmed to find Ezra looking for a place to live outside the apartment building the day before his wedding. Once Dorothy and Ezra had moved into the building, Ezra would arrive unannounced at H.D.'s to discuss his writing, a habit that upset her, in part because his writing touched on private aspects of their relationship. She and Aldington decided to move several miles away to Hampstead.\n\"Des Imagistes\", dispute with Amy Lowell.\nThe appearance of \"Des Imagistes, An Anthology\" (1914), edited by Pound, \"confirmed the importance\" of \"Imagisme\", according to Ira Nadel. Published in the American magazine \"The Glebe\" in February 1914 and the following month as a book, it was the first of five Imagist anthologies and the only one to contain work by Pound. It included ten poems by Richard Aldington, seven by H.D., followed by Flint, Skipwith Cannell, Lowell, Carlos Williams, James Joyce (\"I Hear an Army\", not an example of Imagism), six by Pound, then Hueffer (as he was known as the time), Allen Upward and John Cournos.\nShortly after its publication, an advertisement for Lewis's new magazine, \"Blast\" promised it would cover \"Cubism, Futurism, Imagisme and all Vital Forms of Modern Art.\" Described by Pound as \"mostly a painter's magazine with me to do the poems,\" and bearing the heavy influence of Futurism, \"Blast\" was the magazine of a London art movement formed by Lewis with Pound's collaboration. Pound named the movement\u00a0Vorticism. Vorticism included all the arts, and in \"Blast\" \"the Imagist propaganda merged into the Vorticist.\"\nIn the end, \"Blast\" was published only twice, in 1914 and 1915. In June 1914 \"The Times\" announced Lewis's new Rebel Arts Centre for Vorticist art at 38 Great Ormond Street.\u00a0\u00a0\nLowell, who was to win the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1926, was unhappy that only one of her poems had appeared in \"Des Imagistes\". She arrived in London in July 1914 to attend two dinners at the Dieudonn\u00e9 restaurant in Ryder Street, the first to celebrate the publication of \"Blast\" and the second, on 17 July, the publication of \"Des Imagistes\". At the second, Ford Madox Hueffer announced that he had been an Imagiste long before Lowell and Pound, and that he doubted their qualifications; only Aldington and H.D. could lay claim to the title, in his view. During the subsequent row, Pound left the table and returned with a tin bathtub on his head, suggesting it as a symbol of what he called \"Les Nagistes\", a school created by Lowell's poem \"In a Garden\", which ends with \"Night, and the water, and you in your whiteness, bathing!\" Apparently his behavior helped Lowell win people over to her point of view, as did her offer to fund future work.\nH.D. and Aldington were moving away from Pound's understanding of \"Imagisme\" anyway, as he aligned himself with Lewis's ideas. Lowell agreed to finance an annual anthology of \"Imagiste\" poets, but she insisted on democracy; according to Aldington, she \"proposed a Boston Tea Party for Ezra\" and an end to his despotic rule. Upset at Lowell, Pound began to call \"Imagisme\" \"Amygism\"; he declared the movement dead and asked the group not to call themselves \"Imagistes\". Not accepting that it was Pound's invention, they refused and Anglicized the term.\nWorld War I and leaving England (1914\u20131921).\nMeeting Eliot, \"Cathay\", translation.\nWhen war was declared in August 1914, opportunities for writers were immediately reduced; poems were now expected to be patriotic. Pound's income from October 1914 to October 1915 was \u00a342.10.0, apparently five times less than the year before.\nOn 22 September 1914 T. S. Eliot traveled from Merton College, Oxford, with an introduction from Conrad Aiken, to have Pound read Eliot's unpublished \"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\". Pound wrote to Harriet Monroe, editor of \"Poetry\", on 30 September to say that Eliot\u2014who was at Oxford on a fellowship from Harvard\u2014had \"sent in the best poem I have yet had or seen from an American\u00a0... He has actually trained himself \"and\" modernized himself \"on his own\".\" Monroe did not like Prufrock's \"very European world-weariness\", according to Humphrey Carpenter, but she published it anyway, in June 1915.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe River Merchant's Wife:A Letter\n&lt;poem&gt;At fourteen I married My Lord you.\nI never laughed, being bashful.\nLowering my head, I looked at the wall.\nCalled to, a thousand times, I never looked back.\nAt fifteen, I stopped scowling,\nI desired my dust to be mingled with yours\nForever and forever and forever.\nWhy should I climb the look out?&lt;/poem&gt;\n \u2014\u00a0\" by Li Bai, translated in \"Cathay\" (1915)\nThe 1915 poem \"Cathay\" contains 25 examples of Classical Chinese poetry that Pound translated into English based on the notes of the Orientalist Ernest Fenollosa. Fenollosa's widow, Mary McNeill Fenollosa, had given Pound her husband's notes in 1913, after Laurence Binyon introduced them. Michael Alexander saw \"Cathay\" as the most attractive of Pound's work. There is a debate about whether the poems should be viewed primarily as translations or as contributions to Imagism and the modernization of English poetry. English professor Steven Yao argued that \"Cathay\" shows that translation does not need a thorough knowledge of the source language.\nPound's translations from Old English, Latin, Italian, French and Chinese were highly disputed. According to Alexander, they made him more unpopular in some circles than the treason charge. Robert Graves wrote in 1955: \"[Pound] knew little Latin, yet he translated Propertius; and less Greek, but he translated Alcaeus; and still less Anglo-Saxon, yet he translated \"The Seafarer\". I once asked Arthur Waley how much Chinese Pound knew; Waley shook his head despondently.\"\nPound was devastated when Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, from whom he had commissioned a sculpture of himself two years earlier, was killed in the trenches in June 1915. In response, he published \"Gaudier-Brzeska: A Memoir\" (1916), writing \"A great spirit has been among us, and a great artist has gone.\" Two months before he died, Gaudier-Brzeska had written to Pound to say that he kept \"Cathay\" in his pocket \"to put courage in my fellows\".\n\"Three Cantos\", resignation from \"Poetry\".\nAfter the publication of \"Cathay\", Pound mentioned that he was working on a long poem. He described it in September 1915 as a \"cryselephantine poem of immeasurable length which will occupy me for the next four decades unless it becomes a bore\". In February 1916, when Pound was 30, the poet Carl Sandburg paid tribute to him in \"Poetry\" magazine. Pound \"stains darkly and touches softly\", he wrote:\nAll talk on modern poetry, by people who know, ends with dragging in Ezra Pound somewhere. He may be named only to be cursed as wanton and mocker, poseur, trifler and vagrant. Or he may be classed as filling a niche today like that of Keats in a preceding epoch. The point is, he will be mentioned.\u00a0...In the cool and purple meantime, Pound goes ahead producing new poems having the slogan, \"Guts and Efficiency,\" emblazoned above his daily program of work. His genius runs to various schools and styles. He acquires traits and then throws them away. One characteristic is that he has no characteristics. He is a new roamer of the beautiful, a new fetcher of wild shapes, in each new handful of writings offered us.\nIn June, July and August 1917 Pound had the first three cantos published, as \"Three Cantos\", in \"Poetry\". He was now a regular contributor to three literary magazines. From 1917 he wrote music reviews for the \"New Age\" as William Atheling and art reviews as B.\u00a0H.\u00a0Dias. In May 1917 Margaret Anderson hired him as foreign editor of \"The Little Review\". He also wrote weekly pieces for \"The Egoist\" and \"The Little Review\"; many of the latter complained about provincialism, which included the ringing of church bells. (When Pound lived near St Mary Abbots he had \"engaged in a fierce, guerrilla warfare of letters\" about the bells with the vicar, Reverend R. E. Pennefather, according to Richard Aldington.) The volume of writing exhausted him. In 1918, after a bout of illness which was presumably the Spanish flu, he decided to stop writing for \"The Little Review\". He had asked the publisher for a raise to hire a typist, the 23-year-old Iseult Gonne, causing rumors that they were having an affair, but he was turned down.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAnd the days are not full enough\n&lt;poem&gt;And the days are not full enough\nAnd the nights are not full enough\nAnd life slips by like a field mouse\n Not shaking the grass.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\n\u2014 \"Personae\" (1926)\nA suspicion arose in June 1918 that Pound himself had written an article in \"The Egoist\" praising his own work, and it was clear from the response that he had acquired enemies. The poet F. S. Flint told \"The Egoist\"'s editor that \"we are all tired of Mr. Pound\". British literary circles were \"tired of his antics\" and of him \"puffing and swelling himself and his friends\", Flint wrote. \"His work has deteriorated from book to book; his manners have become more and more offensive; and we wish he would go back to America.\"\nThe March 1919 issue of \"Poetry\" published Pound's \"Poems from the Propertius Series\", which appeared to be a translation of the Latin poet Sextus Propertius. Harriet Monroe, editor of \"Poetry\", published a letter in April 1919 from a professor of Latin, W. G. Hale, who found \"about three-score errors\" in the text; he said Pound was \"incredibly ignorant of Latin\", that \"much of what he makes his author say is unintelligible\", and that \"If Mr. Pound were a professor of Latin, there would be nothing left for him but suicide\" (adding \"I do not counsel this\"). Pound replied to Monroe: \"Cat-piss and porcupines!! The thing is no more a translation than my 'Altaforte' is a translation, or than Fitzgerald's Omar is a translation.\" His letter ended \"In final commiseration\". Monroe interpreted his silence after that as his resignation from \"Poetry\" magazine.\n\"Hugh Selwyn Mauberley\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHugh Selwyn Mauberley\nhttps://, Washington, D.C., June 1958\n&lt;poem&gt;OR three years, out of key with his time,\nHe strove to resuscitate the dead art\nOf poetry; to maintain \"the sublime\"\nIn the old sense. Wrong from the start\u2014\nNo hardly, but, seeing he had been born\nIn a half savage country, out of date;\nBent resolutely on wringing lilies from the acorn;\nCapaneus; trout for factitious bait;\n\u1f3c\u03b4\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd \u03b3\u03ac\u03c1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03b9 \u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03b8', \u1f45\u03c3' \u1f10\u03bd\u03b9 \u03a4\u03c1\u03bf\u03af\u1fc3\nCaught in the unstopped ear;\nGiving the rocks small lee-way\nThe chopped seas held him, therefore, that year.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\n \u2014\u00a0\"Hugh Selwyn Mauberley\" (1920)\nBy 1919 Pound felt there was no reason to stay in England. He had become \"violently hostile\" to England, according to Aldington, feeling he was being \"frozen out of everything\" except the \"New Age\", and concluding that the British were insensitive to \"mental agility in any and every form\". He had \"muffed his chances of becoming literary director of London\u2014to which he undoubtedly aspired,\" Aldington wrote in 1941, \"by his own enormous conceit, folly, and bad manners.\"\nPublished by John Rodker's The Ovid Press in June 1920, Pound's poem \"Hugh Selwyn Mauberley\" marked his farewell to London, and by December the Pounds were subletting their apartment and preparing to move to France. Consisting of 18 short parts, \"Mauberley\" describes a poet whose life has become sterile and meaningless. It begins with a satirical analysis of the London literary scene before turning to social criticism, economics, and the war. Here the word \"usury\" first appears in his work. Just as Eliot denied he was Prufrock, Pound denied he was Mauberley. In 1932 the critic F. R. Leavis, then director of studies in English at Downing College, Cambridge, called \"Mauberley\" \"great poetry, at once traditional and original. Mr. Pound's standing as a poet rests on it, and rests securely\".\nOn 13 January 1921 Orage wrote in the \"New Age\": \"Mr. Pound has shaken the dust of London from his feet with not too emphatic a gesture of disgust, but, at least, without gratitude to this country.\u00a0... [He] has been an exhilarating influence for culture in England; he has left his mark upon more than one of the arts, upon literature, music, poetry and sculpture; and quite a number of men and movements owe their initiation to his self-sacrificing stimulus\u00a0...\"\nWith all this, however, Mr. Pound, like so many others who have striven for advancement of intelligence and culture in England, has made more enemies than friends, and far more powerful enemies than friends. Much of the Press has been deliberately closed by cabal to him; his books have for some time been ignored or written down; and he himself has been compelled to live on much less than would support a navvy. His fate, as I have said, is not unusual\u00a0... Taken by and large, England hates men of culture until they are dead.\nParis (1921\u20131924).\nMeeting Hemingway, editing \"The Waste Land\".\nThe Pounds settled in Paris around April 1921 and in December moved to an inexpensive ground-floor apartment at 70 \"bis\" Rue Notre-Dame-des-Champs. Pound became friendly with Marcel Duchamp, Fernand L\u00e9ger, Tristan Tzara, and others of the Dada and Surrealist movements, as well as Basil Bunting. He was introduced to the American writer Gertrude Stein, who was living in Paris. She wrote years later that she liked him but did not find him amusing; he was \"a village explainer, excellent if you were a village, but if you were not, not\".\nPound's collection \"Poems 1918\u20131921\" was published in New York by Boni and Liveright in 1921. In December that year Ernest Hemingway, then aged 22, moved to Paris with his wife, Hadley Richardson, and letters of introduction from Sherwood Anderson. In February 1922 the Hemingways visited the Pounds for tea. Although Pound was 14 years older, the men became friends; Hemingway assumed the status of pupil and asked Pound to edit his short stories. Pound introduced him to his contacts, including Lewis, Ford, John Peale Bishop, Malcolm Cowley, and Derek Patmore, while Hemingway tried to teach Pound to box. Unlike Hemingway, Pound was not a drinker and preferred to spend his time in salons or building furniture for his apartment and bookshelves for Sylvia Beach's Shakespeare and Company bookstore.\nEliot sent Pound the manuscript of \"The Waste Land\" in 1922. Pound edited it with comments like \"make up yr. mind\", and reduced it by about half. Eliot wrote in 1946: \"I should like to think that the manuscript, with the suppressed passages, had disappeared irrecoverably; yet, on the other hand, I should wish the blue pencilling on it to be preserved as irrefutable evidence of Pound's critical genius.\" His dedication in \"The Waste Land\" was \"For Ezra Pound / \"il miglior fabbro\"\" (the \"better craftsman\"), from Canto 26 of Dante's \"Purgatorio\".\nMeeting Olga Rudge.\nPound was 36 when he met the 26-year-old American violinist Olga Rudge in Paris in the summer of 1922. They were introduced at a salon hosted by the American heiress Natalie Barney at her 300-year-old house at 20 Rue Jacob, near the Boulevard Saint-Germain. The two moved in different social circles: Rudge was the daughter of a wealthy Youngstown, Ohio, steel family, living in her mother's Parisian apartment on the Right Bank, socializing with aristocrats, while Pound's friends were mostly impoverished writers of the Left Bank.\nRestarting \"The Cantos\".\nTwice the length of \"Paradise Lost\" and 50 times longer than \"The Waste Land\", Pound's 800-page \"The Cantos\" (\"Canto I\" to \"Canto CXVI\", c.\u00a01917\u20131962) became his life's work. His obituary in \"The Times\" described it as not a great poem, because of the lack of structure, but a great improvisation: \"[T]he exasperating form permits the occasional, and in the early \"Cantos\" and in \"The Pisan Cantos\" not so occasional, irruption of passages of great poetry, hot and burning lava breaking through the cracks in piles of boring scree.\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCanto CXVI\n&lt;poem&gt;I have brought the great ball of crystal;\nWho can lift it?\nCan you enter the great acorn of light?\nBut the beauty is not the madness\nTho' my errors and wrecks lie about me.\nAnd I am not a demigod,\nI cannot make it cohere.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\n \u2014 \"The Paris Review\", 1962\nThe first three cantos had been published in \"Poetry\" magazine in June, July, and August 1917, but in 1922 Pound abandoned most of his work and began again. The early cantos, the \"Ur-Cantos\", became \"Canto I\" of the new work. In letters to his father in 1924 and 1927, Pound said \"The Cantos\" was like the medley of voices you hear when you turn the radio dial, and \"[r]ather like or unlike subject and response and counter subject in fugue\":\nA.A. Live man goes down into world of Dead.\nC.B. The 'repeat in history'.\nB.C. The 'magic moment' or moment of metamorphosis, bust thru from quotidien into 'divine or permanent world.' Gods., etc.\nAlluding to American, European and Oriental art, history and literature, the work is also autobiographical. In the view of Pound scholar Carroll F. Terrell, it is a great religious poem, describing humanity's journey from hell to paradise, a \"revelation of how divinity is manifested in the universe\u00a0... the kind of intelligence that makes the cherrystone become a cherry tree.\" The poet Allen Tate argued in 1949 that it is \"about nothing at all\u00a0... a voice but no subject\". Responding to \"A Draft of XXX Cantos\" (1930), F. R. Leavis criticized its \"lack of form, grammar, principle and direction\". The lack of form became a common criticism. Pound wrote in the final complete canto, \"Canto CXVI\" (116, first published in \"The Paris Review\" in 1962), that he could not \"make it cohere\", although a few lines later, referring to the universe: \"it coheres all right / even if my notes do not cohere.\" According to Pound scholar Walter Baumann, the demigod of \"Canto CXVI\"\u2014\"And I am not a demigod\"\u2014is Heracles of Sophocles's \"Women of Trachis\" (450\u2013425 BCE), who exclaims before he dies (based on Pound's translation): \"SPLENDOUR, / IT ALL COHERES\". \"Canto CXVI\" ends with the lines \"a little light, like a rushlight / to lead back to splendour.\"\nItaly (1924\u20131939).\nBirth of the children.\nThe Pounds were unhappy in Paris. Dorothy complained about the winters and Ezra's health was poor. At one dinner in the Place de l'Od\u00e9on, a Surrealist guest high on drugs had tried to stab Pound in the back; Robert McAlmon had wrestled with the attacker, and the guests had managed to leave before the police arrived. For Pound the event underlined that their time in France was over. They decided to move to a quieter place, leaving in October 1924 for the seaside town of Rapallo in northern Italy. Hemingway wrote in a letter that Pound had \"indulged in a small nervous breakdown\" during the packing, leading to two days at the American Hospital of Paris in Neuilly. During this period the Pounds lived on Dorothy's income, supplemented by dividends from stock she had invested in.\nPregnant by Pound, Olga Rudge followed the couple to Italy, and in July 1925 she gave birth to a daughter, Maria, in a hospital in Brixen (Italian : Bressanone). Rudge and Pound placed the baby with a German-speaking peasant woman in Gais, South Tyrol, whose own child had died and who agreed to raise Maria for 200 lire a month. Pound reportedly believed that artists ought not to have children, because in his view motherhood ruined women. According to Hadley Richardson, he took her aside before she and Hemingway left Paris for Toronto to have their child, telling her: \"Well, I might as well say goodbye to you here and now because [the baby] is going to change you completely.\"\nAt the end of December 1925 Dorothy went on holiday to Egypt, returning on 1 March, and in May the Pounds and Olga Rudge left Rapallo for Paris to attend a semi-private concert performance at the Salle Pleyel of \"Le Testament de Villon\", a one-act opera Pound had composed (\"nearly tuneless\", according to Carpenter) with the musicians Agnes Bedford and George Antheil. Pound had hired two singers for the performance; Rudge was on violin, Pound played percussion, and Joyce, Eliot and Hemingway were in the audience.\nThe couple stayed on in Paris after the performance; Dorothy was pregnant and wanted the baby to be born at the American hospital. Hemingway accompanied her there in a taxi for the birth of a son, Omar Pound, on 10 September 1926. (Ezra was an admirer of Fitzgerald's translation of Omar Khayyam.) Ezra signed the birth certificate the following day at Neuilly town hall and wrote to his father, \"next generation (male) arrived. Both D &amp; it appear to be doing well.\" Ezra ended up in the American hospital himself for tests and, he told Olga, a \"small operation\". Dorothy took Omar to England, where she stayed for a year and thereafter visited him every summer. He was sent to live at first in Felpham, Sussex, with a former superintendent of Norland College, which trains nannies, and later became a boarder at Charterhouse. When Dorothy was in England with Omar during the summers, Ezra would spend the time with Olga. Olga's father helped her buy a house in Venice in 1928, and from 1930 she also rented the top floor of a house in Sant'Ambrogio, Caso 60, near the Pounds in Rapallo.\n\"The Exile\", \"Dial\" poetry award.\nIn 1925 a new literary magazine, \"This Quarter\", dedicated its first issue to Pound, including tributes from Hemingway and Joyce. In Hemingway's contribution, \"Homage to Ezra\", he wrote that Pound \"devotes perhaps one fifth of his working time to writing poetry and in this twenty per cent of effort writes a large and distinguished share of the really great poetry that has been written by any American living or dead\u2014or any Englishman living or dead or any Irishman who ever wrote English.\"\nWith the rest of his time he tries to advance the fortunes, both material and artistic, of his friends. He defends them when they are attacked, he gets them into magazines and out of jail. He loans them money. He sells their pictures. He arranges concerts for them. He writes articles about them. He introduces them to wealthy women. He gets publishers to take their books. He sits up all night with them when they claim to be dying and he witnesses their wills. He advances them hospital expenses and dissuades them from suicide. And in the end a few of them refrain from knifing him at the first opportunity.\nAgainst Hemingway's positive view of Pound, Richard Aldington told Amy Lowell that year that Pound had been almost forgotten in England: \"as the rest of us go up, he goes down\", he wrote. In the U.S., Pound won the $2,000 \"Dial\" poetry award in 1927 for his translation of the Confucian classic \"Great Learning\". Using the prize money, he launched his own literary magazine, \"The Exile\", in March, but only four issues appeared. It did well in the first year, with contributions from Hemingway, E. E. Cummings, Basil Bunting, Yeats, William Carlos Williams, and Robert McAlmon. Some of the poorest work consisted of Pound's rambling editorials on Confucianism or in praise of Lenin, according to biographer J.\u00a0J.\u00a0Wilhelm. His parents visited him in Rapallo that year, seeing him for the first time since 1914. His father had retired, so they moved to Rapallo themselves, taking a small house, Villa Raggio, on a hill above the town.\nAntisemitism, social credit.\nPound's antisemitism can be traced to at least 1910, when he wrote in \"Patria Mia\", his essays for the \"New Age\": \"The Jew alone can retain his detestable qualities, despite climatic conditions.\" The sentence was removed from the 1950 edition. In 1922 he apparently disliked that so many Jews were contributing to \"The Dial\", and in 1939, when he read his poetry at Harvard, he was said to have included antisemitic poems in the program because he believed there were Jews in the audience.\nA friend of Pound's, the writer Lina Caico, wrote to him in March 1937 asking him to use his musical contacts to help a German-Jewish pianist in Berlin who did not have enough money to live on because of the Nuremberg Laws. Normally willing to help fellow artists, Pound replied (at length): \"You hit a nice sore spot\u00a0... Let her try Rothschild and some of the bastards who are murdering 10 million anglo saxons in England.\" He nevertheless denied being an antisemite; he said he liked Baruch Spinoza, Michel de Montaigne, and Alexander del Mar. \"What I am driving at\", he wrote to Jackson Mac Low, \"is that some kike might manage to pin an antisem lable on me IF he neglected the mass of my writing.\"\nPound came to believe that World War I had been caused by finance capitalism, which he called \"usury\", and that the Jews had been to blame. He believed the solution lay in C. H. Douglas's idea of social credit. Pound several times used the term \"Leihkapital\" (loan capital), equating it with Jews. Hitler had used the same term in \"Mein Kampf\" (1926). \"Your enemy is Das Leihkapital,\" Pound wrote in a 1942 radio script aimed at the UK, \"international, wandering Loan Capital. Your enemy is not Germany, your enemy is money on loan. And it would be better to be infected with typhus\u00a0... than to be infected with this blindness which prevents you from understanding HOW you are undermined\u00a0... The big Jew is so bound up with this Leihkapital that no one is able to unscramble that omelet.\" The argument ran that without \"usury\" and Jews, there would be no class conflict.\nIn addition to presenting his economic ideas in hundreds of articles and in \"The Cantos\", Pound wrote more than 1,000 letters a year throughout the 1930s. From 1932, he wrote 180 articles for \"The New English Weekly\", a social-credit journal founded by A. R. Orage, and 60 for \"Il Mare\", a Rapallo newspaper. He wrote to Bill Bird that the press in Paris was controlled by the Comit\u00e9 des forges. He also came under the influence of Charles Maurras, who led the far-right \"Action Fran\u00e7aise\".\nIn 1935, Pound wrote an essay, \"What is Money For?\" where he advocated for Silvio Gesell's concept of free money. In the essay, he criticized usury and argued that \"vegetable money\" was necessary to put people whose livelihoods are dependent on producing food on an equal level playing field with people with already have plenty of money stored in banks.\nMeeting Mussolini.\nIn December 1932 Pound requested a meeting with Benito Mussolini after being hired to work on a film script about Italian fascism. Pound had asked to see Mussolini previously\u2014Olga Rudge had played privately for Mussolini on 19 February 1927\u2014but this time he was given an audience. They met on 30 January 1933 at the Palazzo Venezia in Rome, the day Adolf Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany.\nWhen Pound handed Mussolini a copy of \"A Draft of XXX Cantos\", Mussolini reportedly said of a passage Pound highlighted that it was not English. Pound said: \"No, it's my idea of the way a continental Jew would speak English\", to which Mussolini replied \"How entertaining\" (\"divertente\"). Pound tried to discuss an 18-point draft of his economic theories. (Daniel Swift writes that this story has been \"told and retold, and in each version, the details shift\".) Pound recorded the meeting in \"Canto XLI\".\nPound wrote to C.\u00a0H.\u00a0Douglas that he had \"never met anyone who seemed to \"get\" my ideas so quickly as the boss\". The meeting left him feeling that he had become a person of influence, Redman writes, someone who had been consulted by a head of state. When he returned to Rapallo, he was greeted at the station by the town band.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCanto XLI\n&lt;poem&gt;\nA QVESTO,\"\nsaid the Boss, \"\u00e8 divertente.\"\ncatching the point before the aesthetes had got\nthere;\nHaving drained off the muck by Vada\nFrom the marshes, by Circeo, where no one else wd. have\ndrained it.\nWaited 2000 years, ate grain from the marshes:\nWater supply for ten million, another one million \"vani\"\nthat is rooms for people to live in.\nXI of our era.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\n\u2014\u00a0On meeting Mussolini\nImmediately after the meeting, Pound began writing \"The ABC of Economics\" and \"Jefferson and/or Mussolini: L'Idea Statale Fascism as I Have Seen It\" (1935). The latter was ready by the end of February, although he had trouble finding a publisher. In 1942, Pound told Italy's Royal Finance Office that he had written the book for propaganda purposes in Italy's interests. He wrote articles praising Mussolini and fascism for T.\u00a0S.\u00a0Eliot's \"The Criterion\" in July 1933, the \"New York World Telegram\" in November 1933, the \"Chicago Tribune\" on 9 April 1934, and in 65 articles for the \"British-Italian Bulletin\", published by the Italian Embassy in London.\nPound's antisemitism deepened with the introduction of the Italian racial laws in 1938, preceded by the publication in July that year of the Manifesto of Race. Mussolini instituted restrictions against Jews, who had to register. Foreign Jews lost their Italian citizenship, and on 18 September 1938 Mussolini declared Judaism \"an irreconcilable enemy of fascism\".\nVisit to America.\nWhen Olivia Shakespear died in October 1938 in London, Dorothy asked Ezra to organize the funeral, where he saw their 12-year-old son, Omar, for the first time in eight years. He visited Eliot and Wyndham Lewis, who produced a famous portrait of Pound reclining.\nBelieving he could stop America's involvement in World War II, Pound sailed for New York in April 1939 on the SS \"Rex\" in a first-class suite. Giving interviews on the deck in a tweed jacket, he told reporters that Mussolini wanted peace. In Washington, D.C., he attended a session of Congress, sitting in a section of the gallery reserved for relatives (because of Thaddeus Coleman Pound). He lobbied senators and congressmen, had lunch with the Polish ambassador, warning him not to trust the English or Winston Churchill, and asked to see the President but was told it could not be done.\nHe took part in a poetry reading at Harvard, where he agreed to be recorded by the Department of Speech, and in July he received an honorary doctorate from Hamilton College, along with the radio commentator H. V. Kaltenborn. Kaltenborn, whom Pound referred to at the time as Kaltenstein, gave an anti-fascist speech after lunch (\"dictatorships shall die, but democracies shall live\"), which Pound interrupted loudly to the point where, according to one account, the college president had to intervene. Pound described this years later to Wyndham Lewis: \"That was a music hall day, with a stage set/ only at a Kawledg Komencement wd/ one git in mouth-shot at that sort of wind-bag/ that fahrt Kaltenbourne.\" Pound sailed back to Italy a few days later on the SS \"Conte di Savoia\".\nBetween May and September 1939 Pound wrote 12 articles for the \"Japan Times\" (he became their \"Italian correspondent\"), which included the claim that \"Democracy is now currently defined in Europe as a 'country run by Jews'\". He discussed the \"essential fairness of Hitler's war aims\" and wrote that Churchill was a senile front for the Rothschilds.\nWorld War II and radio broadcasts (1939\u20131945).\nLetter-writing campaign.\nWhen war broke out in September 1939, Pound began a letter-writing campaign to the politicians he had petitioned months earlier. On 18 June 1940, after the fall of France, he wrote to Senator Burton K. Wheeler: \"I have read a regulation that only those foreigners are to be admitted to the U.S. who are deemed to be useful etc/. The dirtiest jews from Paris, Blum??\" He explained that they were all a pox. To his publisher, James Laughlin, he wrote that \"Roosevelt represents Jewry\" and signed off with \"Heil Hitler\". He began calling Roosevelt \"Jewsfeldt\" or \"Stinky Rooosenstein\". In \"Meridiano di Roma\" he compared Hitler and Mussolini to Confucius. In Oswald Mosley's newspaper, \"Action\", he wrote that the English were \"a slave race governed by the House of Rothschild since Waterloo\". By May 1940, according to the historian Matthew Feldman, the British government regarded Pound as \"a principal supplier of information to the BUF [British Union of Fascists] from abroad\". His literary agent in New York, John J. Slocum, urged him to return to writing poetry and literary criticism; instead, Pound sent Slocum political manifestos, which he declined to attempt to publish in the United States.\nRadio broadcasts.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nRadio broadcast\nYou let in the Jew and the Jew rotted your Empire, and you yourselves are (doomed) by the Jew.\n\u2014\u00a0Ezra Pound, Radio Rome, 15 March 1942\nBetween 23 January 1941 and 28 March 1945, including during the Holocaust in Italy, Pound recorded or composed hundreds of broadcasts for Italian radio, mostly for EIAR (Radio Rome) and later for a radio station in the Italian Social Republic, a puppet state of Nazi Germany in northern and central Italy. Broadcast in English, and sometimes in Italian, German, and French, the EIAR program was transmitted to England, central Europe, and the United States.\nStyling himself \"Dr Ezra Pound\" (his only doctorate was the honorary one from Hamilton College), he attacked the United States, Roosevelt, Roosevelt's family, Churchill, and the Jews. He praised Hitler, recommended eugenics to \"conserve the best of the race\", and referred to Jews as \"filth\". The broadcasts were monitored by the United States Foreign Broadcast Monitoring Service, and on 26 July 1943 the United States District Court for the District of Columbia indicted Pound \"in absentia\" for treason. According to Feldman, the Pound archives at Yale contain receipts for 195 payments from the Italian Ministry of Popular Culture from 22 April 1941 to 26 January 1944. Over 33 months, Pound received 250,000 lire (then equivalent to $12,500; $185,000 as of 2013).\nOn 9\u201310 September 1943, the German Wehrmacht occupied northern and central Italy. Hitler appointed Mussolini head of a fascist puppet state, the Italian Social Republic or Sal\u00f2 Republic. Pound called it the \"Republic of Utopia\". SS officers began concentrating Jews in transit camps before deporting them to Auschwitz-Birkenau. In Rome when the German occupation began, Pound headed north to Gais, on foot and by train, to visit his daughter, a journey of about . On or around 23 November 1943, he met Fernando Mezzasoma, the new Minister of Popular Culture, in Sal\u00f2. Pound wrote to Dorothy from Sal\u00f2 asking if she could obtain a radio confiscated from the Jews to give to Rudge, so that Rudge could help with his work.\nFrom 1 December 1943 Pound began writing scripts for the state's new radio station. The following day he suggested to Alessandro Pavolini, secretary of the Republican Fascist Party, that book stores be legally obliged to showcase certain books, including \"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion\" (1903), an Okhrana hoax document purporting to be a Jewish plan to dominate the world. \"The arrest of Jews will create a wave of useless mercy,\" Pound wrote, \"thus the need to disseminate the Protocols. The intellectuals are capable of a passion more durable than emotional, but they need to understand the reasons for a conflict.\" On 26 January 1945, in a script called \"Corpses of Course\" for the program \"Jerry's Front Calling\", Pound wrote: \"Why shouldn't there be one grand beano; wiping out Sieff and Kuhn and Loeb and Guggenheim and Stinkenfinger and the rest of the nazal bleaters?\"\nArrest for treason.\nIn May 1944 the German military, trying to secure the coast against the Allies, forced the Pounds to evacuate their seafront apartment in Rapallo. From then until the end of the war, the couple lived with Rudge in her home above Rapallo at Sant' Ambrogio. There were food shortages, and no coffee, newspapers, telephones, or letters. According to Rudge, Ezra and Dorothy would spend their nights listening to the BBC. In addition to the radio scripts, Pound was writing for the newspaper \"Il Popolo di Alessandria\". He wanted to write for the more reputable \"Corriere della Sera\" in Milan, but the editor regarded his Italian as \"incomprehensible\".\nMussolini and his mistress, Clara Petacci, were shot by Italian partisans on 28 April 1945. Their bodies were displayed in the Piazzale Loreto in Milan, abused by the crowd, then left hanging upside down. Pound wrote in \"Canto LXXIV\" (\"The Pisan Cantos\"), \"Thus Ben and la Clara \"a Milano\" / by the heels at Milano\". On 3 May armed partisans arrived at Rudge's home to find Pound alone. He picked up the Confucian text \"Four Books\" and a Chinese\u2013English dictionary and was taken to their headquarters in Zoagli, then at his request to the U.S. Counter Intelligence Corps headquarters in Genoa, where he was interrogated by FBI agent Frank L. Amprin.\nPound asked to send a cable to Harry S. Truman to help negotiate a \"just peace\" with Japan. He wanted to make a final broadcast called \"Ashes of Europe Calling\", in which he would recommend not only peace with Japan, but American management of Italy, the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine, and leniency toward Germany. His requests were denied and the script was forwarded to J. Edgar Hoover. A few days later Amprin removed over 7,000 letters, articles and other documents from Rudge's home as evidence. On 8 May, the day Germany surrendered, Pound gave the Americans a further statement:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I am not anti-Semitic, and I distinguish between the Jewish usurer and the Jew who does an honest day's work for a living. Hitler and Mussolini were simple men from the country. I think that Hitler was a Saint, and wanted nothing for himself. I think that he was fooled into anti-Semitism and it ruined him. That was his mistake. When you see the \"mess\" that Italy gets into by bumping off Mussolini, you will see why someone could believe in some of his efforts.\nLater that day he told an American reporter, Edd Johnson, that Hitler was \"a Jeanne d'Arc\u00a0... Like many martyrs, he held extreme views\". Mussolini was \"a very human, imperfect character who lost his head\". On 24 May he was transferred to the United States Army Disciplinary Training Center north of Pisa, where he was placed in one of the camp's outdoor steel cages, with tar paper covers, lit up at night by floodlights. Engineers reinforced his cage the night before he arrived in fear that fascist sympathizers might try to break him out.\nPound lived in isolation in the heat, sleeping on the concrete, denied exercise and communication, apart from daily access to the chaplain. After three weeks, he stopped eating. He recorded what seemed to be a breakdown in \"Canto LXXX\", where Odysseus is saved from drowning by Leucothea: \"hast'ou swum in a sea of air strip / through an aeon of nothingness, / when the raft broke and the waters went over me\". Medical staff moved him out of the cage the following week. On 14 and 15 June he was examined by psychiatrists, after which he was transferred to his own tent. He began to write, drafting what became known as \"The Pisan Cantos\". The existence of two sheets of toilet paper showing the first ten lines of \"Canto LXXIV\" in pencil suggests he started it while in the cage.\nUnited States (1945\u20131958).\nSt. Elizabeths Hospital.\nPound arrived back in Washington, D.C., on 18 November 1945, two days before the start of the Nuremberg trials. Lt. Col. P. V. Holder, one of the escorting officers, wrote in an affidavit that Pound was \"an intellectual 'crackpot'\" who intended to conduct his own defense. Dorothy would not allow it; Pound wrote in a letter: \"Tell Omar I favour a defender who has written a life of J. Adams and translated Confucius. Otherwise how CAN he know what it is about?\".\nHe was arraigned on 27 November on charges of treason, and on 4 December he was placed in a locked room in the psychiatric ward of Gallinger Hospital. Three court-appointed psychiatrists, including Winfred Overholser, superintendent of St. Elizabeths Hospital, decided that he was mentally unfit to stand trial. They found him \"abnormally grandiose\u00a0... expansive and exuberant in manner, exhibiting pressure of speech, discursiveness and distractibility.\" A fourth psychiatrist appointed by Pound's lawyer initially thought he was a psychopath, which would have made him unfit to stand trial.\nOn 21 December 1945, as case no. 58,102, he was transferred to Howard Hall, St. Elizabeths' maximum security ward, where he was held in a single cell with peepholes. Visitors were admitted to the waiting room for 15 minutes at a time, while patients wandered around screaming. A hearing on 13 February 1946 concluded that he was of \"unsound mind\"; he shouted in court: \"I never did believe in Fascism, God damn it; I am opposed to Fascism.\" Pound's lawyer, Julien Cornell, requested his release at a hearing in January 1947. As a compromise, Overholser moved him to the more comfortable Cedar Ward on the third floor of the east wing of St. Elizabeths' Center Building. In early 1948 he was moved again, this time to a larger room in Chestnut Ward.\nTytell writes that Pound was in his element in Chestnut Ward. At last provided for, he was allowed to read, write, and receive visitors, including Dorothy for several hours a day. (In October 1946 Dorothy had been placed in charge of his \"person and property\".) His room had a typewriter, floor-to-ceiling book shelves, and bits of paper hanging on string from the ceiling with ideas for \"The Cantos\". He had turned a small alcove on the ward into his living room, where he entertained friends and literary figures. It reached the point where he refused to discuss any attempt to have him released.\nWhile in St. Elizabeths, Pound would often decline to talk to psychiatrists with names he deemed Jewish (he called psychiatrists \"kikiatrists\"), and he apparently told Charles Olson: \"I was a Zionist in Italy, but now I'm for pogroms, after what I've experienced in here (SLiz).\" He advised visitors to read the \"Protocols of the Elders of Zion\", and he referred to any visitor he happened not to like as Jewish. In November 1953 he wrote to Olivia Rossetti Agresti that Hitler was \"bit by dirty Jew mania for World Domination, as yu used to point out/ this WORST of German diseases was got from yr/ idiolized and filthy biblical bastards. Adolf clear on the baccilus of kikism/ that is on nearly all the other poisons.[sic] but failed to get a vaccine against that.\"\n\"The Pisan Cantos\", Bollingen Prize.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCanto LXXX\n&lt;poem&gt;\nand the Serpentine will look just the same\nand the gulls be as neat on the pond\nand the sunken garden unchanged\nand God knows what else is left of our London\n&lt;/poem&gt;\n\u2014\u00a0\"The Pisan Cantos\" (1948)\nJames Laughlin of New Directions had Cantos LXXIV\u2013LXXXIV, known as \"The Pisan Cantos\", ready for publication in 1946 and gave Pound an advance copy, but Laughlin held back, waiting for the right time to publish. A group of Pound's friends\u2014T.\u00a0S.\u00a0Eliot, E.\u00a0E.\u00a0Cummings, W. H. Auden, Allen Tate, and Joseph Cornell\u2014met Laughlin in June 1948 to discuss how to get Pound released. They planned to have him awarded the first Bollingen Prize, a new national poetry award with $1,000 prize money donated by the Mellon family.\nThe awards committee consisted of 15 fellows of the Library of Congress, including several of Pound's supporters, such as Eliot, Tate, Conrad Aiken, Katherine Anne Porter, and Theodore Spencer. The idea was that the Justice Department would be in an untenable position if Pound won a major award and was not released. Laughlin published \"The Pisan Cantos\" on 20 July 1948, and the following February the prize went to Pound. There were two dissenting voices, Katherine Garrison Chapin and Karl Shapiro; the latter said he could not vote for an antisemite because he was Jewish himself. Pound had apparently prepared a statement\u2014\"No comment from the Bug House\"\u2014but decided instead to stay silent.\nThere was uproar. The \"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\" quoted critics who said that poetry cannot \"convert words into maggots that eat at human dignity and still be good poetry\". Robert Hillyer, a Pulitzer Prize winner and president of the Poetry Society of America, attacked the committee in \"The Saturday Review of Literature\", telling journalists that he \"never saw anything to admire, not one line, in Pound\". Congressman Jacob K. Javits demanded an investigation into the awards committee. It was the last time the Library of Congress administered the prize.\nDiagnosis.\nDuring a case conference at St. Elizabeths on 28 January 1946, six psychiatrists had concluded that Pound had psychopathic personality disorder but was not psychotic. Present during the meeting, he decided to lie on the floor while the psychiatrists interviewed him. In 1952 the American Psychiatric Association published its first \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\" (DSM-1), and St. Elizabeths began diagnosing patients according to its definitions. In July 1953 a psychiatrist added to Pound's notes that he probably had narcissistic personality disorder. The main feature of Pound's personality, he wrote, was his \"profound, incredible, over-weaning \"(sic)\" narcissism\". A personality disorder, unlike conditions that give rise to psychosis, is not regarded as a mental illness, and the diagnosis would have made Pound fit to stand trial. On 31 May 1955, at the request of the hospital's superintendent Winfred Overholser, the diagnosis was changed to \"psychotic disorder, undifferentiated\", which is classified as mental illness. In 1966, after his release from St. Elizabeths, Pound was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.\nPolitical activities while hospitalized.\nPound struck up a friendship with Eustace Mullins, apparently associated with the Aryan League of America and author of the 1961 biography \"This Difficult Individual, Ezra Pound\". He was also visited in the hospital by American Nazi leader Matt Koehl, and befriended John Kasper, a Ku Klux Klan member who, after \"Brown v. Board of Education\" (a 1954 U.S. Supreme Court decision mandating racial desegregation in public schools), set up a Citizens' Council chapter, the Seaboard White Citizens' Council in Washington. Members had to be white, supportive of racial segregation, and believers in the divinity of Jesus. Kasper wrote to Pound after admiring him at university, and the two became friends. In 1953 Kasper opened a far-right bookstore, \"Make it New\", at 169 Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, that displayed Pound's work in the window. With Pound's cooperation, he and another Pound admirer, T. David Horton, set up Square Dollar Series, a publishing imprint that reprinted Pound's books and others he approved of.\nIt became increasingly clear that Pound was schooling Kasper in the latter's pro-segregation activism. In January and February 1957 the \"New York Herald Tribune\" ran a series of articles on their relationship, after which the FBI began photographing Pound's visitors. One article alleged that some of Kasper's pamphlets had, as John Tytell put it, \"a distinctly Poundian ring\" to them. Kasper was jailed in 1956 over a speech he made in Clinton, Tennessee, and he was questioned about the 1957 bombing of the Hattie Cotton School in Nashville. After Pound left hospital in 1958, the men kept in touch; he wrote to Kasper on 17 April 1959: \"Antisemitism is a card in the enemy program, don't play it.\u00a0... They RELY ON YOUR PLAYING IT.\"\n\"New Times\" articles.\nBetween late 1955 and early 1957, Pound wrote at least 80 unsigned or pseudonymous articles\u2014\"often ugly\", Swift notes\u2014for the \"New Times\" of Melbourne, a newspaper connected to the social-credit movement. Noel Stock, one of Pound's correspondents and early biographers, worked for the paper and published Pound's articles there. A 24-year-old radio reporter at the time, Stock first wrote to Pound in hospital after reading \"The Pisan Cantos\".\nIn the \"New Times\" in April 1956, Pound wrote: \"Our Victorian forebears would have been greatly scandalized at the idea that one might not be free to study inherited racial characteristics,\" and \"Some races are retentive, mainly of the least desirable bits of their barbaric past.\" There was a \"Jewish-Communist plot\", which he compared to syphilis. Equality was dismissed as \"anti-biological nonsense\". \"There were no gas ovens in Italy\", he wrote in April 1956; a month later he referred to the \"fuss about Hitler\". On 10 August 1956: \"It is perfectly well known that the fuss about 'de-segregation' in the United States has been started by Jews.\" Instead, America needed \"race pride\". Using pseudonyms, he sent his articles directly to Stock, so that the newspaper's editor may not have realized they had all been written by Pound. Stock sent Pound copies of the published articles, which he would distribute to his followers. He contributed similar material to other publications, including \"Edge\", which Stock founded in October 1956. Stock called \"Edge\" the magazine of the \"international Poundian underground\".\nRelease.\nPound's friends continued to try to get him out of St. Elizabeths. In 1948, in an effort to present his radio broadcasts as harmless, Olga Rudge self-published six of them (on cultural topics only) as \"If This Be Treason\". She visited him twice, in 1952 and 1955, but could not convince him to be more assertive about his release. In 1950 she had written to Hemingway to complain that Pound's friends had not done enough. Hemingway and Rudge did not like each other. He told Dorothy in 1951 that \"the person who makes least sense\u00a0...in all this is Olga Rudge\". In what John Cohassey called a \"controlled, teeth-gritting response\", Hemingway replied to Rudge that he would pardon Pound if he could, but that Pound had \"made the rather serious mistake of being a traitor to his country, and temporarily he must lie in the bed he made\". He ended by saying \"To be even more blunt, I have always loved Dorothy, and still do.\"\nFour years later, shortly after he won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1954, Hemingway told \"Time\" magazine \"I believe this would be a good year to release poets.\" The poet Archibald MacLeish asked him in June 1957 to write a letter on Pound's behalf. Hemingway believed Pound would not stop making inappropriate statements and friendships, but he signed MacLeish's letter anyway and pledged $1,500 to be handed to Pound upon his release. In an interview for \"The Paris Review\" in early 1958, Hemingway said that Pound should be released and Kasper jailed.\nSeveral publications began campaigning in 1957. \"Le Figaro\" published an appeal titled \"The Lunatic at St Elizabeths\". \"The New Republic\", \"Esquire\", and \"The Nation\" followed suit. \"The Nation\" argued that Pound was a \"sick and vicious old man\", but that he had rights. In 1958 MacLeish hired Thurman Arnold, a prestigious lawyer who ended up charging no fee, to file a motion to dismiss the 1945 indictment. Overholser, the hospital's superintendent, supported the application with an affidavit stating Pound was permanently and incurably insane, and that confinement served no therapeutic purpose. The motion was heard on 18 April 1958 by Chief Judge Bolitha Laws, who had committed Pound to St. Elizabeths in 1945. The Justice Department did not oppose the motion, and Pound was discharged on 7 May.\nItaly (1958\u20131972).\nDepression.\nPound and Dorothy arrived in Naples on the on 9 July 1958, where Pound was photographed giving a fascist salute to the waiting press. When asked when he had been released from the mental hospital, he replied: \"I never was. When I left the hospital I was still in America, and all America is an insane asylum.\" They were accompanied by a young teacher Pound had met in hospital, Marcella Spann, ostensibly acting as his secretary. Disembarking at Genoa, the group arrived three days later at Schloss Brunnenburg, near Merano in South Tyrol, to live with his daughter Maria, where Pound met his grandchildren for the first time. Dorothy had usually ignored his affairs, but she used her legal power over his royalties to make sure Spann was seen off, sent back to the United States in October 1959.\nBy December 1959 Pound was mired in depression. According to the writer Michael Reck, who visited him several times at St. Elizabeths, Pound was a changed man; he said little and called his work \"worthless\". In a 1960 interview in Rome with Donald Hall for \"The Paris Review\", he said: \"You\u2014find me\u2014in fragments.\" He paced up and down during the three days it took to complete the interview, never finishing a sentence, bursting with energy one minute, then sagging, and at one point seemed about to collapse. Hall said it was clear that he \"doubted the value of everything he had done in his life\".\nThose close to him thought he had dementia, and in mid-1960 he spent time in a clinic when his weight dropped. He picked up again, but by early 1961 he had a urinary tract infection. Dorothy felt unable to look after him, so he went to live with Olga Rudge, first in Rapallo then in Venice; Dorothy mostly stayed in London after that with Omar. In 1961 Pound attended a meeting in Rome in honor of Oswald Mosley, who was visiting Italy.\nIn 1966 he was admitted to the Genoa School of Medicine's psychiatric hospital for an evaluation after prostate surgery. His notes said he had psychomotor retardation, insomnia, depression, and he believed he had been \"contaminated by microbes\". According to a psychiatrist who treated him, Pound had previously been treated with electroconvulsive therapy. This time he was given imipramine and responded well. The doctors diagnosed bipolar disorder. Two years later he attended the opening of an exhibition in New York featuring his blue-inked version of Eliot's \"The Waste Land\". He went on to Hamilton College and received a standing ovation.\nReck allegations.\nPound's biographer, Michael Reck, claimed to have had an encounter with Pound at the restaurant of the Pensione Cici in Venice in 1967, during which Pound told Allen Ginsberg and Peter Russell that his own poems were \"a lot of double talk\" and made no sense, and that his writing was \"a mess\", \"stupid and ignorant all the way through\". Reck wrote about the meeting in \"Evergreen Review\" the following year. \"At seventy I realized that instead of being a lunatic, I was a moron,\" Pound reportedly said. He \"looked very morose\" and barely spoke: \"There is nothing harder than conversing with Pound nowadays,\" Reck wrote.\nPound had offered a carefully worded rejection of his antisemitism, according to Reck. When Ginsberg reassured Pound that he had \"shown us the way\", he is said to have replied: \"Any good I've done has been spoiled by bad intentions\u2014the preoccupation with irrelevant and stupid things.\" Reck continued: \"Then very slowly, with emphasis, surely conscious of Ginsberg's being Jewish: 'But the worst mistake I made was that stupid, suburban prejudice of anti-Semitism.'\"\nDeath.\nShortly before his death in 1972, an American Academy of Arts and Sciences committee, which included his publisher James Laughlin, proposed that Pound be awarded the Emerson-Thoreau Medal. After a storm of protest, the academy's council opposed it by 13 to 9. In the foreword of a Faber &amp; Faber volume of his prose, he wrote in July: \"In sentences referring to groups or races 'they' should be used with great care. re USURY: / I was out of focus, taking a symptom for a cause. / The cause is AVARICE.\"\nOn his 87th birthday, on 30 October 1972, he was too weak to leave his bedroom. The next night he was admitted to the San Giovanni e Paolo Civil Hospital in Venice, where he died in his sleep on 1 November of \"sudden blockage of the intestine\". Alerted by telegram, Dorothy Pound, who was living in a care home near Cambridge, England, requested a Protestant funeral in Venice. Telegrams were sent via American embassies in Rome and London, and the consulate in Milan, but Rudge would not change the plans she had already made for the morning of 3 November. Omar Pound flew to Venice as soon as he could, with Peter du Sautoy of Faber &amp; Faber, but he arrived too late. Four gondoliers dressed in black rowed Pound's body to Venice's municipal cemetery, the San Michele cemetery, where, after a Protestant service, he was buried in the Protestant section of the cemetery, near Diaghilev and Stravinsky who rest at the adjoining Orthodox section, with other non-Catholic Christians. According to Hugh Kenner, Pound had wanted to be buried in Idaho with his bust by Henri Gaudier-Brzeska on his grave. Dorothy Pound died in England the following year, aged 87. Olga Rudge died in 1996, aged 100, and was buried next to Pound.\nCritical reception.\nRehabilitation efforts, scholarship.\nAfter the Bollingen Prize in 1949, Pound's friends sought to rehabilitate him. James Laughlin's New Directions Publishing published his \"Selected Poems\", with an introduction by Eliot, and a censored selection of \"The Cantos\". Ralph Fletcher Seymour published \"Patria Mia\" (written around 1912) to show that Pound was an American patriot. In advertisements, magazine articles, and critical introductions, Pound's friends and publishers attributed his antisemitism and fascism to mental illness.\nLiterary scholar Betsy Erkkila writes that no one was more important to Pound's rehabilitation than Hugh Kenner, who was introduced to Pound by Marshall McLuhan in St. Elizabeths in May 1948, when Kenner was 25. Kenner's \"The Poetry of Ezra Pound\" (1951) adopted a New Critical approach, where all that mattered was the work itself.\nNew Directions and Faber &amp; Faber published \"Ezra Pound: Translations\" in 1953, introduced by Kenner, and the following year \"Literary Essays of Ezra Pound\", introduced by Eliot. The first PhD dissertation on Pound was completed in 1948, and by 1970 there were around ten a year. Kenner's \"The Pound Era\" (1971), which overlooked the fascism, antisemitism, World War II, treason, and the Bollingen Award, effectively equated Pound with modernism. Pound scholar Leon Surette argued that Kenner's approach was hagiographic. He included in this approach Caroll F. Terrell's \"Paideuma: A Journal Devoted to Ezra Pound Scholarship\", founded in 1972 and edited by Kenner and Eva Hesse (1925-2020) and Terrell's two-volume \"A Companion to the Cantos of Ezra Pound\" (1980\u20131984). In 1971 Terrell founded the National Poetry Foundation to focus on Pound, and organized conferences on Pound in 1975, 1980, 1985, and 1990.\nFollowing Eustace Mullins' biography, \"This Difficult Individual, Ezra Pound\" (1961), was \"Life of Ezra Pound\" (1970) by Noel Stock. A former reporter, Stock was one of the publishers of Pound's newspaper articles in the 1950s, including his antisemitism. Ronald Bush's \"The Genesis of Ezra Pound's Cantos\" (1976) became the first critical study of \"The Cantos\". Several significant biographies appeared in the 1980s: J. J. Wilhelm's three-volume work (1985\u20131994), beginning with \"The American Roots of Ezra Pound\"; John Tytell's \"Ezra Pound: The Solitary Volcano\" (1987); and Humphrey Carpenter's 1005-page \"A Serious Character\" (1988). A. David Moody's three-volume \"Ezra Pound: Poet\" (2007\u20132015) combines biography with literary criticism.\nStudies that examine Pound's relationships with the far right include Robert Casillo's \"The Genealogy of Demons\" (1988); Tim Redman's \"Ezra Pound and Italian Fascism\" (1999); Leon Surette's \"Pound in Purgatory\" (1999); Matthew Feldman's \"Ezra Pound's Fascist Propaganda, 1935\u201345\" (2013); and Alec Marsh's \"John Kasper and Ezra Pound\" (2015).\nLegacy.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCanto CXVI\n&lt;poem&gt;\nA little light, like a rushlight\nTo lead back to splendour.&lt;/poem&gt;\n \u2014 Closing lines of \"The Cantos\"\nMuch of Pound's legacy lies in his advancement of some of the best-known modernist writers of the early 20th century, particularly between 1910 and 1925. In addition to Eliot, Joyce, Lewis, Frost, Williams, Hemingway, H.D., Aldington, and Aiken, he befriended and helped Cummings, Bunting, Ford, Marianne Moore, Louis Zukofsky, Jacob Epstein, Margaret Anderson, George Oppen, and Charles Olson.\nBeyond this, his legacy is mixed. He was a strong lyricist with an \"ear\" for words; his \"Times\" obituary said he had a \"faultless sense of cadence\". According to Ira Nadel, he \"overturned poetic meter, literary style, and the state of the long poem\". Nadel cited the importance of Pound's editing of \"The Waste Land\", the publication of \"Ulysses\", and his role in developing of Imagism. Hugh Witemeyer argued that Imagism was \"probably the most important single movement\" in 20th-century English-language poetry, because it affected all the leading poets of Pound's generation and the two generations after him. According to Hugh Kenner in 1951, although no great contemporary writer was less read than Pound, there was no one who could \"over and over again appeal more surely, through sheer beauty of language\" to people who would otherwise rather talk about poets than read them.\nAgainst this, Robert Conquest argued in 1979 that critics were responsible for having promoted Pound despite his \"minimal talent\", which was \"grossly exaggerated\". \"This is an accusation less against the fantastic arrogance of Pound\", he wrote, \"than against the narrow-minded obscurantism of the departments of English and the critical establishment who have set up a system of apologetics which the slyest Jesuit of the seventeenth century would have baulked at.\" According to Samuel Putnam, those who respected Pound's poetry were less likely to respect his prose or work as a critic.\nThe outrage over his collaboration with the Axis powers was so deep that it dominated the discussion. \"A greater calamity cannot befall the art\", Arthur Miller wrote in December 1945, \"than that Ezra Pound, the Mussolini mouthpiece, should be welcomed back as an arbiter of American letters\u00a0...\" Over the decades, according to Redman, critics argued that Pound was not really a poet or not really a fascist, or that he was a fascist but his poetry is not fascistic, or that there was an evil Pound and a good Pound. The American poet Elizabeth Bishop, 1956 Pulitzer Prize winner and one of his hospital visitors\u2014Pound called her \"Liz Bish\"\u2014reflected the ambivalence in her poem \"Visits to St. Elizabeths\" (1957). \"This is the time / of the tragic man / that lies in the house of Bedlam.\" As the poem progresses, the tragic man, never named, becomes the talkative man; the honored man; the old, brave man; the cranky man; the cruel man; the busy man; the tedious man; the poet, the man; and, finally, the wretched man.\nSelected works.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\nArticles.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nBooks.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}

From 2017 to 2019, she starred on the Showtime comedy series \"SMILF\".\nIn addition to comedy, film, and television, O'Donnell has been a magazine editor, celebrity blogger, and author of several memoirs, including \"Find Me\" (2002) and \"Celebrity Detox\" (2007). She used the \"Find Me\" US$3\u00a0million advance to establish her For All foundation and promote other charity projects, encouraging celebrities on her show to take part. \nIn early 2025, shortly after Trump was inaugurated for a second presidential term, O'Donnell moved to Ireland and applied for Irish citizenship through descent. In July 2025, Trump threatened to revoke her U.S.-born birthright citizenship.\nEarly life.\nO'Donnell was born on March 21, 1962, in Commack, New York, the third of five children of Roseann Teresa (n\u00e9e Murtha; 1934\u20131973) and Edward Joseph O'Donnell (1933\u20132015). Her father immigrated from County Donegal, Ireland, during his childhood; her mother was Irish American. \nO'Donnell and her siblings were sexually abused by their father as children, and she stated that her family has a history of \"generational abuse and alcoholism\". \"There were a lot of tragic deaths, early deaths and alcoholism. There was a lot of abuse,\" she said of her father's family. She was raised Roman Catholic. Her brother is Daniel J. O'Donnell, the first openly gay man elected to the New York State Assembly. On March 17, 1973, four days before O'Donnell's eleventh birthday, her mother Roseann died from breast cancer. \nWhile O'Donnell attended Commack High School, she was voted homecoming queen, prom queen, senior class president, and class clown. During high school, she began exploring her interest in comedy, beginning with a skit performed in front of the school in which she imitated Gilda Radner's character, Roseanne Roseannadanna. After graduating in 1980, O'Donnell briefly attended Dickinson College, later transferring to Boston University before ultimately dropping out of college.\nCareer.\n1979\u20131995: Stand-up and early work.\nO'Donnell toured as a stand-up comedian in clubs from 1979 to 1984. She got her first big break on \"Star Search\", explaining on \"Larry King Live\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I was 20 years old, and I was at a comedy club in Long Island. This woman came over to me and she said, I think you're funny. Can you give me your number? My dad is Ed McMahon. I was like, yeah, right. I gave her my father's phone number. I was living at home, I'm like, whatever. And about three days later, the talent booker from \"Star Search\" called and said, we're going to fly you out to L.A. ... I won, like, five weeks in a row. And it gave me national exposure.\nAfter this success, she moved on to television sitcoms, making her series debut as Nell Harper's neighbor on \"Gimme a Break!\" in 1986. In 1988, she joined music video station VH1's lineup of veejays. She started hosting a series for VH1, \"Stand-up Spotlight\", a showcase for up-and-coming comedians. In 1992, she starred in \"Stand By Your Man\", a Fox Network sitcom co-starring Melissa Gilbert. The show bombed at the same time as her film career took off. O'Donnell made her feature film debut in \"A League of Their Own\" (1992) alongside Tom Hanks, Geena Davis, and Madonna, the latter of whom became a lifelong friend. She was originally considered for the role of Mary Sanderson in Disney's \"Hocus Pocus\", but it was ultimately given to Kathy Najimy. O'Donnell claimed on her blog that she turned down the offer to work with Bette Midler because she refused to portray a frightening evil witch. Throughout her career, she has taken on an eclectic range of roles: she appeared in \"Sleepless in Seattle\" as Meg Ryan's character's best friend; as Betty Rubble in the live-action film adaptation of \"The Flintstones\" with John Goodman, Elizabeth Perkins, and Rick Moranis; as one of Timothy Hutton's co-stars in \"Beautiful Girls\"; as a federal agent comedically paired with Dan Aykroyd in \"Exit to Eden\"; as the voice of a tomboyish female gorilla named Terk in Disney's \"Tarzan\"; and as a baseball-loving nun in M. Night Shyamalan's \"Wide Awake\".\nO'Donnell was considered for the role of Elaine Benes on \"Seinfeld\".\n1996\u20132002: \"The Rosie O'Donnell Show\".\nIn 1996, she began hosting a daytime talk show, \"The Rosie O'Donnell Show\", for her production company KidRo Productions. The show proved very successful, winning multiple Emmy Awards, and earning O'Donnell the title of \"The Queen of Nice\" for her style of light-hearted banter with her guests and interactions with the audience. As part of her playful banter with her studio audience, O'Donnell often launched koosh balls at the crowd and camera. She also professed an infatuation with Tom Cruise.\nWith New York City as the show's home base, O'Donnell displayed her love of Broadway musicals and plays by having cast members as guests, encouraging the audience to see shows, premiering production numbers as well as promoting shows with ticket giveaways.\nAfter the Columbine shootings, O'Donnell became an outspoken supporter of gun control and a major figure in the Million Mom March. During the April 19, 1999, broadcast of her talk show, she stated, \"You are not allowed to own a gun, and if you do own a gun, I think you should go to prison.\" O'Donnell previously had remarked, \"I don't personally own a gun, but if you are qualified, licensed and registered, I have no problem.\" In May 1999, a month after the Columbine shootings, O'Donnell interviewed Tom Selleck, who was promoting \"The Love Letter\". O'Donnell interrogated him about his recent unpaid commercial for the National Rifle Association of America (NRA) and questioned him about the NRA's position on the use of \"assault weapons\". She said at the end of the segment the conversation had \"not gone the way I had hoped\" and added \"if you feel insulted by my questions, I apologize because it was not a personal attack. It was meant to bring up the subject as it is in the consciousness of so many today.\" Ironically, O'Donnell at that time was a multi-million dollar paid spokesperson for 5 years for Kmart, which was the largest volume firearms retailer in the United States. Around the same time, the cast from \"Annie Get Your Gun\" was to appear on the show but refused O'Donnell's request to remove the line \"I can shoot a partridge with a single cartridge\" from the song \"Anything You Can Do\" and agreed to perform \"My Defenses Are Down\" instead.\nLater in 1999, O'Donnell discontinued her contract with Kmart as their spokeswoman, as gun enthusiasts complained that she should not be the spokesperson for the largest gun retailer. O'Donnell countered that Kmart sells hunting rifles, not handguns or assault weapons and does so legally, which she supports. Both Kmart and O'Donnell denied publicly that Kmart had terminated the contract. In May 2000, O'Donnell's bodyguard applied for a concealed firearm permit. O'Donnell stated that the security firm contracted by Warner Bros. requested the gun. O'Donnell stated that because of threats, she and her family need protection.\nAfter the September 11, 2001 attacks, Broadway and tourism in New York City was down and many shows were in danger of closing. O'Donnell was among many in the entertainment field who encouraged viewers to visit and support the performing arts. She announced that she would donate 1 million dollars for aid in the rescue efforts and encouraged other celebrities and citizens alike to \"give till it hurts\".\nIn 2002, she left her talk show. The show was replaced by \"The Caroline Rhea Show\", with comedian Caroline Rhea, which ran for one additional season.\nO'Donnell was a guest star on an episode of HBO show \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" entitled \"The Bowtie\".\n2006\u20132007: \"The View\".\nIn September 2006, O'Donnell replaced Meredith Vieira as a co-host and moderator of \"The View\", a daytime women-oriented talk show. Star Jones, a co-host on the show, quit, with some speculating Jones's conservative views would be in constant tension with O'Donnell's more liberal counterpoint. O'Donnell had also disputed Jones's route of rapid weight loss, alluding that it must have been through gastric bypass surgery, rather than dieting and exercise alone as Jones had insisted, which also fed speculation about certain tension between the two. (Jones later confirmed that surgery was involved.) O'Donnell is credited with keeping the show's \"buzz factor up\". She is also credited with making it more news-focused, though it still embraced the \"fluff\" of daytime TV talk shows (celebrities, fashion, and food). Despite an overall downward trend for most daytime broadcast shows, ratings rose by 27% during O'Donnell's first year on \"The View\". The show was the fourth-most-watched in all of daytime in the key demographic of women ages 18\u201349 and scored record ratings in the total viewer category with an average of 3.4\u00a0million viewers\u2014up 15% versus the same time in 2005. O'Donnell moderated the opening \"Hot Topics\" portion of the show, where news items were discussed. O'Donnell gave the show a more political slant, and she and fellow comic Joy Behar often gave strong opinions against former President Bush's domestic and foreign policies, including the Iraq War. As a conservative counterpoint, Elisabeth Hasselbeck would usually support the Bush administration's policies and the two would get into an adversarial give-and-take.\nIn November 2006, Rosie commented on Kelly Ripa's complaints to Regis Philbin about guest co-host Clay Aiken on Live with Regis and Kelly. Kelly said she was angry at Aiken for jokingly putting his hand over her mouth during an interview segment. Rosie told the other panelist on The View that Kelly made a homophobic comment about Clay. Kelly was watching the segment and quickly called into the live segment to tell Rosie that Kelly's complaint about Aiken was not about homophobia; the issue was it is flu season.\nKelly has in the past placed her hand over Regis' mouth as a joke during non-flu season.\nEncouraged by the show to be outspoken, O'Donnell sometimes provoked debate, at one time stating \"radical Christianity is just as threatening as radical Islam.\" On the February 24, 2003, episode of Phil Donahue's talk show, O'Donnell referred to the sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic archdiocese of Boston resulting in $157\u00a0million awarded to 983 claimants, stating \"I hope the Catholic Church gets sued until the end of time. Maybe, you know, we can melt down some of the gold toilets in the Pope's Vatican and pay off some of the lawsuits because, the whole tenet of living a Christ-like life, has been lost in Catholicism.\"\nO'Donnell joked about communion rituals alongside co-host Behar's drunk priest comments. On April 19, 2007, the panel discussed the Supreme Court of the United States's ruling in \"Gonzales v. Carhart\", a decision upholding the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. O'Donnell cited a Florynce Kennedy quote, \"If men could get pregnant abortion would be a sacrament\" and asked rhetorically \"How many Supreme Court judges are Catholic?\" and \"How about separation of church and state?\" Some conservative commentators deemed her statements \"anti-Catholic bigotry\" and suggested that such statements against other religions would not be tolerated. O'Donnell's outspokenness and spontaneousness sometimes led to her views being recirculated by other media outlets, often surprising \"The View\" co-hosts including O'Donnell. Frequently portrayed unfavorably by conservative media outlets and what she deemed as Republican pundits, O'Donnell lamented that they were focusing on her comments instead of more important national and world issues.\nOn December 5, 2006, O'Donnell used a series of ching chongs to imitate newscasters in China. Vanessa Hua of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" expressed disappointment in O'Donnell, given the comedian's championing of LGBT rights. On December 14, O'Donnell apologized to those she offended, explaining that \"Some people have told me it's as bad as the n-word. I was like, really? I didn't know that.\" O'Donnell warned that \"there's a good chance I'll do something like that again, probably in the next week, not on purpose. Only 'cause it's how my brain works.\" \"Time\" called it a \"pseudo-apology\". O'Donnell later wrote in \"Celebrity Detox\" that \"I wish I had been a bit more pure in my public apology.\"\nIn December 2006, O'Donnell criticized Donald Trump for holding a press conference to reinstate Miss USA Tara Conner, who had violated pageant guidelines, accusing him of using her scandal to \"generate publicity for the Miss USA Pageant\" (to which he owned the rights) by announcing he was giving her a second chance. O'Donnell commented that due to Trump's multiple marital affairs and questionable business bankruptcies, he was not a moral authority for young people in America. She stated, \"Left the first wife, had an affair. Left the second wife, had an affair \u2013 but he's the moral compass for 20-year-olds in America.\" In response, Trump began a \"vicious\" mass media blitz in which he appeared on various television shows, either in person or by phone, threatening to sue O'Donnell (he never did). He called her names, insulted her by saying he'd \"send one of my friends to pick up her girlfriend [Kelli] and I think it would be easy\", and claimed that Barbara Walters regretted hiring her. Walters was stuck in the middle as a social acquaintance of Trump's, and said O'Donnell did not feel like Walters defended her enough, which led to what both women agreed was an unfortunate confrontation in one of the dressing rooms. \"I had pain and hurt and rejection,\" O'Donnell said, \"sometimes [my emotions] overwhelm me. Sometimes I get flooded.\" Walters denied that she was unhappy with O'Donnell, saying, \"I have never regretted, nor do I now, the hiring of Rosie O'Donnell.\" Rosie and Donald Trump have a history of feuding on social media and on television since December 2006.\nOn April 25, 2007, ABC announced that O'Donnell would be leaving the show before the end of the year because of a failure to reach agreement on a new contract.\nO'Donnell condemned many of the Bush administration's policies, especially the war in Iraq and the resulting occupation. She also questioned the official explanation for the destruction of the World Trade Center, and stating in one episode, \"I do believe that it's the first time in history that fire has ever melted steel\". She consistently mentioned recent military deaths and news about the war and criticized the U.S. media for its lack of attention to these issues compared to media coverage throughout the world. This led to a series of heated exchanges with co-host Hasselbeck, as well as \"the most-discussed moment of her professional life.\" On May 17, 2007, O'Donnell rhetorically asked, \"655,000 Iraqi civilians dead. Who are the terrorists? ... if you were in Iraq and another country, the United States, the richest in the world, invaded your country and killed 655,000 of your citizens, what would you call us?\" Conservative commentators criticized O'Donnell's statements, saying that she was comparing American soldiers to terrorists. On May 23, 2007, a heated discussion ensued, in part, because of what O'Donnell perceived as Elisabeth Hasselbeck's unwillingness to defend O'Donnell from the criticisms; O'Donnell asked Hasselbeck, \"Do you believe I think our troops are terrorists?\" Hasselbeck answered in the negative but also stated \"Defend your own insinuations.\" O'Donnell was hurt and felt Hasselbeck had betrayed her friendship: \"there's something about somebody being different on TV toward you than they are in the dressing room. It didn't really ring true for me.\" O'Donnell stated that Republican pundits were mischaracterising her statements and the right-wing media would portray her as a bully, attacking \"innocent pure Christian Elisabeth\" whenever they disagreed. O'Donnell decided to leave the show that day, but afterwards stated that the reason was not the argument itself, but rather the fact that she saw on the studio monitor that the camera had shown a split screen, with her and Hasselbeck on either side. O'Donnell felt that the show's director and producer \"had to prepare that in advance ... I felt there was setup egging me into that position. The executive producer and I did not gel.\" O'Donnell and ABC agreed to cut short her contract agreement on May 25, 2007. ABC News reported that her arguments with Hasselbeck brought the show its best ratings ever. O'Donnell was replaced by Whoopi Goldberg as the moderator of \"The View\".\nIn May 2007, \"Time\" magazine included O'Donnell in their annual list of the 100 most influential people. O'Donnell was named \"The Most Annoying Celebrity of 2007\" by a \"PARADE\" reader's poll, in response she said, \"Frankly, most celebrities are annoying ... and I suppose I am the most annoying, but, whatever.\"\nIn 2008, \"The View\" won an Emmy for \"Outstanding Special Class Writing\" for a specially themed Autism episode that O'Donnell helped create. Janette Barber, O'Donnell's longtime friend and producer/writer of \"The Rosie O'Donnell Show\", accepted the award on behalf of herself and the other two winners, Christian McKiernan and Andrew Smith.\n2007\u20132012: \"The Rosie Show\" and blog.\nIn March 2007, O'Donnell started a video blog, \"Jahero\", on her website Rosie.com answering fans questions, giving behind the scenes information and serving as a video diary. Originally featuring only O'Donnell and her hair and makeup artist Helene Macaulay, they were soon joined by her writer from \"The Rosie O'Donnell Show\", Janette Barber. Called \"Jahero\", a name composed of the first two letters of each of their first names, they occasionally had short cameo appearances by \"View\" co-hosts Joy Behar, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, and Barbara Walters. Jenny McCarthy appeared once briefly, as has Hasselbeck's mother-in-law and O'Donnell's mother-in-law, her (now) ex-wife Kelli's mother. Kathy Griffin also appeared, where she read some of the questions. It became so popular that O'Donnell and her creative team considered an \"on the road\" version of the video blog using fan-submitted suggestions. O'Donnell was the front runner for the \"best celebrity blogger\" category in the 2007 Blogger's Choice Awards which she won.\nO'Donnell expressed interest in replacing long time host Bob Barker when he retired from CBS's game show \"The Price Is Right\". Barker was a frequent guest on her talk show and told reporters that she \"would make a fine host\". Although it was reported he had \"endorsed\" her as a \"possible successor\", Barker said that he had no role in choosing his replacement. In June 2007, she announced on her blog it was not going to happen and noted she was reluctant to uproot her family to move to California.\nIn 2008, O'Donnell starred in and executive produced \"America\", a Lifetime channel film in which she plays the therapist of the title character, a 16-year-old boy aging out of the foster care system. The film is based on the E.R. Frank book of the same name. In October 2009, she appeared in the original cast of \"Love, Loss, and What I Wore\".\nIn November 2009, \"Rosie Radio\", a daily two-hour show with O'Donnell discussing news and events on Sirius XM Radio, premiered. O'Donnell said she was approached by the company after she appeared on Howard Stern's Sirius XM show. The radio show ended in June 2011. In 2009, O'Donnell made another guest appearance on \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\", where she beat up Larry twice, in an episode titled Denise Handicapped.\nIn 2011, O'Donnell began producing material for the Oprah Winfrey Network (OWN). In May 2011, \"The Doc Club with Rosie O'Donnell\" premiered, a show where O'Donnell moderated live panel discussions following premieres of OWN Documentaries. She has hosted specials for \"Becoming Chaz\" in May 2011 and \"Miss Representation\" in October 2011. In fall 2011, O'Donnell began full-time work on her new show, \"The Rosie Show\", for OWN. The show taped at the Chicago studio formerly home to \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\". The show debuted on October 10, 2011, to generally positive reviews. OWN canceled \"The Rosie Show\" on March 16, 2012, with the last show taped March 20, on the eve of O'Donnell's 50th birthday. The final show aired on OWN on March 29, 2012. In a statement, Oprah Winfrey said: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I thank Rosie from the bottom of my heart for joining me on this journey. She has been an incredible partner, working to deliver the best possible show every single day. As I have learned in the last 15 months, a new network launch is always a challenge and ratings grow over time as you continue to gather an audience. I'm grateful to Rosie and the dedicated Rosie Show team for giving it their all.\nO'Donnell responded to the cancellation by thanking her viewers and the host city of Chicago: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In 2011, O'Donnell made another guest appearance on \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\", competing for the affection of a bisexual woman with Larry in an episode called \"The Bi-Sexual\".\n2013\u20132016: \"The Fosters\" and return to \"The View\".\nIn 2013, O'Donnell appeared in a number of television shows. First, she played \"brash but astute\" reporter Dottie Shannon in an episode of \"Bomb Girls\", followed by playing the voice of the Bouncing Bumble Queen in \"Jake and the Never Land Pirates\". After that, also in 2013, she appeared in two episodes of \"Smash\" as herself. That same year she also appeared as herself in an episode of \"Impractical Jokers\" called \"Everything's Rosie\".\nIn 2014, O'Donnell landed a reoccurring role as Rita Hendricks on \"The Fosters\", \"a tough yet compassionate woman who works for the foster care system and becomes a mentor to a member of the Foster family.\" The character lasted through their 2016 season.\nIn the fall of 2014, O'Donnell returned to \"The View\" as a co-host, with a newly re-vamped version of the show, along with Whoopi Goldberg returning as moderator and new co-hosts Rosie Perez and Nicolle Wallace. On February 6, 2015, representatives for O'Donnell confirmed she would once again exit the panel. In a statement, made to \"The Hollywood Reporter\", O'Donnell said, \"[My health] got a little bit worse right before the holidays \u2014 [my doctor] was kind of concerned. ... I can't really fix [my personal life] right away, but I can fix [my job].\"\nIn 2015, O'Donnell made a cameo in \"Pitch Perfect 2\", playing a co-host on \"The View\". Deadline called the cameo \"a bit that already seems dated.\" That same year, she appeared in an episode of \"Empire\", playing Pepper O'Leary, \"a tough criminal who shared a cell for years with Cookie Lyon.\" In preparation for the role, she hired an acting coach and stated, \"I prepared for this like I've never prepared for anything in my career, because I didn't want to disappoint and I understood the pace at which they work.\" O'Donnell also appeared as herself in two documentaries that same year. In April 2015, \"Roseanne For President!\" was released, a film about Roseanne Barr's presidential bid in 2012. O'Donnell appeared in the film alongside Michael Moore and Sandra Bernhard. In September 2015, the documentary \"Everything Is Copy\" was released, a film by Jacob Bernstein about his mother Nora Ephron. O'Donnell appeared in the documentary to help \"bring his mother into focus\" along with a number of other celebrities.\nIn 2016, O'Donnell made a two-episode appearance in the CBS series \"Mom\", playing Jeanine, \"the ex-girlfriend of Bonnie (Allison Janney)\". That same year, she was also a regular panelist on \"Match Game\" and appeared in one episode of \"The $100,000 Pyramid\", where she competed against Kathy Najimy. Later that year, O'Donnell also played the role of the gym teacher in \"Hairspray Live!\"\n2017\u2013present: Return to acting.\nIn November 2016, Showtime announced she had joined the cast of the comedy pilot \"SMILF\". The series aired from November 5, 2017, until March 31, 2019, and O'Donnell received critical acclaim for her portrayal of Tutu. On April 3, 2019, it was announced that O'Donnell would play the role of Lisa Sheffer in the HBO series \"I Know This Much Is True\".\nIn 2021, O'Donnell guest starred on the series \"Run the World\" and \"\". On June 15, 2021, it was announced that she would star as Detective Sunday, alongside Jon Bernthal, in a series reboot of \"American Gigolo\" on Showtime, premiering in 2022. In 2022 she voiced the role of the MTA subway announcements in the second season of Netflix series \"Russian Doll\" starring Natasha Lyonne. That same year she appeared as Vi in the Amazon Prime Video series \"A League of Their Own\" (2022).\nOther ventures.\n\"Rosie\" magazine.\nIn 2000, O'Donnell partnered with the publishers of \"McCall's\" to revamp the magazine as \"Rosie's McCall's\" (or, more commonly, \"Rosie\"). The magazine was launched as a competitor to fellow talk show hostess Oprah Winfrey's monthly magazine \"O\". \"Rosie\" covered issues including breast cancer, foster care, and other matters of concern to O'Donnell. In the September 2000 issue, she shared that \"she has struggled with depression her entire life\" and decided to start medications when she realized her fears were affecting her family. With a strong start and a circulation close to 3.5\u00a0million, things looked promising, but the magazine stumbled as conflicts emerged between O'Donnell and the editors. The contract gave O'Donnell control over editorial process and editorial staff but veto power remained with publisher Gruner+Jahr USA. O'Donnell quit the magazine in September 2002, following a dispute over editorial control. \"If I'm going to have my name and my brand on the corner of a magazine, it has to be my vision\" she told \"People\".\n\"Rosie\" magazine folded in 2003. In late 2003, O'Donnell and the publishers each sued the other for breach of contract. The publishers said that, by removing herself from the magazine's publication, she was in breach of contract. The trial received considerable press coverage. O'Donnell would often give brief press interviews outside of the courtroom responding to various allegations. Of note was a former magazine colleague and breast cancer survivor who testified that O'Donnell said to her on the phone that people who lie \"get sick and they get cancer. If they keep lying, they get it again\". O'Donnell apologized the next day and stated, \"I'm sorry I hurt her the way I did, that was not my intention.\" The judge, Ira Gammerman of the New York Supreme Court in Manhattan, dismissed the case, ruling that neither side should receive damages.\nBooks.\nIn 1997, Rosie released the children's book \"Kids are Punny: Jokes Sent by Kids to the Rosie O'Donnell Show\", which contained jokes she had received from children. A sequel titled \"Kids are Punny 2: More Jokes Sent by Kids to the Rosie O'Donnell Show\" was released a year later in 1998, and an HBO special was made based on the books. In April 2002, O'Donnell released \"Find Me,\" a combination of memoir, mystery and detective story with an underlying interest in reuniting birth mothers with their children. In addition to cataloging her childhood and early adulthood, the book delved into O'Donnell's relationship with a woman with dissociative identity disorder who posed as an underage teen who had become pregnant by rape. The book reached number two on \"The New York Times\" bestseller list.\nIn October 2007, she released \"Celebrity Detox\", her second memoir which focuses on the struggles with leaving fame behind, noting her exits from \"The Rosie O'Donnell Show\" and \"The View\".\nR Family Vacations.\nIn 2003, O'Donnell and Carpenter partnered with travel entrepreneur Gregg Kaminsky to launch R Family Vacations catering to LGBT families, \"the very first all gay and lesbian family vacation packages\" where \"gays and lesbians can bring their kids, their friends, and their parents.\" Although O'Donnell is not involved on a day-to-day basis, she does contribute to the creative aspects of \"advertising and marketing materials\" and initiated the idea for the company when she filled in as a last-minute replacement headliner on one of Kaminsky's Atlantis Events gay cruises and also came up with the name \"R Family Vacations\". On July 11, 2004, the first cruise was held with 1600 passengers including 600 children. In addition to traditional entertainment and recreational activities, the company partnered with Provincetown's Family Pride, a 25-year-old Washington, D.C.\u2013based organization that advocates for LGBT families to host discussions on \"adoption, insemination, surrogacy, and everything else that would be helpful to gay parenting.\" \"All Aboard! Rosie's Family Cruise\", a documentary film about the trip debuted on HBO on April 6, 2006, and was nominated for three Emmy Awards. Of the experience, O'Donnell stated \"we didn't really realize the magic that was going to take place. People who had never met another gay family met other families and it was powerful.\"\n\"Taboo\".\nIn late 2003, O'Donnell brought the musical \"Taboo\" to Broadway. She hired Charles Busch to re-write the book, and the story became \"bitchier\" and more focused on the rise to fame of the character based on Boy George. It closed on February 8, 2004, after about 100 performances and \"mostly bad\" reviews. O'Donnell described the show's production as \"by far the most fulfilling experience of my career\". She has stated that she intends to bring the show back to Broadway, although Scott Miller writes that people are hesitant to get involved after the \"train wreck\" of the original production.\nCharitable work.\nOver her career, O'Donnell has developed a reputation for raising funds and her own philanthropy to charitable causes. In May 1996, Warner Books advanced O'Donnell $3\u00a0million to write a memoir. She used the money to seed her For All Kids Foundation to help institute national standards for day care across the country.\nSince 1997, Rosie's For All Kids Foundation, overseen by Elizabeth Birch, has awarded more than $22\u00a0million in Early Childhood Care and Education program grants to over 900 nonprofit organizations. On October 30, 2006, she was honored by the New York Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. \"It's our privilege to be honoring and hosting Rosie,\" said NYSPCC president David Stack in a statement. \"Her Rosie's for All Kids Foundation has awarded more than $22 million in grants to over 1,400 child-related organizations, and that's just one of her many impressive activities on behalf of children.\" In November 2006, \"Nightline\" aired a video report about the opening of The Children's Plaza and Family Center in Renaissance Village, a FEMA trailer park in Louisiana. This was an emergency response initiative of Rosie's For All Kids Foundation with the help of many local nonprofit organizations and for-profit businesses, all efforts were to assist the families displaced by Hurricane Katrina.\nSan Francisco public relations firm Fineman Associates awarded top prize to Procter &amp; Gamble's designation of O'Donnell as \"unkissable\" in a promotion for Scope mouthwash on the 1997 annual list of the nation's worst public relations blunders. In response to the promotion, O'Donnell partnered with Warner\u2013Lambert's competitor Listerine, who donated bottles of mouthwash to the studio audience and donated $1,000 to charity every time a hosted guest would kiss her in exchange for O'Donnell promoting their product. On occasion, the guests would offer multiple kisses, and \"People\" reported O'Donnell \"smooched her way to more than $350,000\".\nIn 2003, O'Donnell and Kelli O'Donnell collaborated with Artistic Director Lori Klinger to create Rosie's Broadway Kids, dedicated to providing free instruction in music and dance to New York City public schools or students. Rosie's Broadway Kids serves more than 4,500 teachers, students, and their family members at 21 schools. Currently, programs are in Harlem, Midtown West, Chelsea, Lower East Side, East Village, and Chinatown. All net profits from O'Donnell's 2007 book \"Celebrity Detox\" are also being donated to Rosie's Broadway Kids.\nIn December 2006, at a one-night charity event on the Norwegian Pearl cruise ship, Elizabeth Birch, executive director for the Rosie's For All Kids Foundation, confirmed that $50\u00a0million from O'Donnell's five-year contract were donated in an irrevocable trust to charity. She is also reported to have contributed several hundred thousand dollars for rehabilitation therapies for war veterans who have lost limbs in Iraq and Afghanistan wars. On \"The Tyra Banks Show\", Banks brought up to O'Donnell that people do not realize that O'Donnell has given more than $100\u00a0million to charity. In May 2007, O'Donnell and Pogo.com announced a joint effort to raise money for Rosie's All Kids Foundation. EA, which owns Pogo.com, committed $30,000 and more money can be raised based on the amount of playing time people spend on certain games. They also held a sweepstakes in which winners get to fly to New York and meet O'Donnell and attend a charity function as her guest.\nDuring the summer of 2007, O'Donnell was a guest on the multi-artist True Colors Tour, which traveled through 15 cities in the United States and Canada. The tour, sponsored by the gay cable channel Logo, began on June 8, 2007. Hosted by comedian Margaret Cho and headlined by Cyndi Lauper, the tour also included Debbie Harry, Erasure, The Gossip, Rufus Wainwright, The Dresden Dolls, The MisShapes, Indigo Girls, The Cliks, and other special guests. Profits from the tour helped to benefit the Human Rights Campaign as well as P-FLAG and The Matthew Shepard Foundation. She appeared again on True Colors Tour 2008.\nPersonal life.\nO'Donnell was a resident of Nyack, New York, after her 1996 purchase of \"Pretty Penny\", a Victorian river home previously occupied by Helen Hayes. O'Donnell later sold the home to businessman Edward M. Kopko in 2000. She has lived in South Nyack, New York, and owns a home in West Palm Beach, Florida. O\u2019Donnell relocated to the West Coast in the early 2020s.\nO'Donnell is a Democrat. She has contributed funds to multiple political campaigns, including to the campaign to elect Senator Doug Jones of Alabama.\nOn numerous occasions, O'Donnell has been outspoken about controversial topics. In 2007, she announced her opinion concerning the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, in which she questioned NIST conclusions, and alleged the United States government's involvement in the attacks.\nIn March 2025, shortly after Trump was inaugurated for a second term, O'Donnell revealed in a TikTok video that she had moved to Ireland with her child, Clay, that January. She said \"It's been heartbreaking to see what's happening politically, and hard for me personally as well. The personal is political, as we all know.\" She went on to say that she and Clay \"just felt like we needed to take care of ourselves and make some hard decisions and follow through\". O'Donnell applied for Irish citizenship through descent. Trump threatened in July 2025 to revoke US-born O'Donnell's birthright US citizenship. Initially O'Donnell moved to the Dublin coastal village of Howth in a rental house. After a few months, influenced by the local specialist school for her autistic daughter, they moved to the Dublin coastal suburb of\u00a0Sandymount.\nSexual orientation.\nIn her January 31, 2002, appearance on the sitcom \"Will &amp; Grace\", she played a lesbian mother. A month later, as part of her act at the Ovarian Cancer Research benefit at Caroline's Comedy Club, O'Donnell came out as a lesbian, announcing \"I'm a dyke! ... I don't know why people make such a big deal about the gay thing. ... People are confused, they're shocked, like this is a big revelation to somebody.\" The announcement came two months before the end of her talk show. Although she also cited the need to put a face to gays and lesbians, her primary reason was to bring attention to LGBTQ adoption issues. O'Donnell is a foster and adoptive mother. She protested against adoption agencies, particularly in Florida, that refused adoptive rights to gay and lesbian parents.\nDiane Sawyer interviewed O'Donnell in a March 14, 2002, episode of \"PrimeTime Thursday\". O'Donnell told \"USA Today\" that she chose to talk to Sawyer because she wanted an investigative piece on Florida's ban on gay adoption. She told Sawyer if that was done, \"I would like to talk about my life and how (the case) pertains to me.\" She spoke about two gay men in Florida who faced having a foster child they raised removed from their home. State law wouldn't let them adopt because Florida banned gay couples and lesbian couples from adopting. O'Donnell's coming out drew criticism from some LGBTQ activists, who cited her repeated references to being enamored of Tom Cruise on \"The Rosie O'Donnell Show\" as deceptive. She responded in her act stating, \"I said I wanted him to mow my lawn and bring me a lemonade. I never said I wanted to blow him.\" After leaving her show and coming out, O'Donnell returned to stand-up comedy and cut her hair, telling the press that her haircut was meant to mimic that of former Culture Club backup singer Helen Terry.\nO'Donnell was named 2002's Person of the Year by \"The Advocate\", and, in May 2003, she became a regular columnist for the magazine. The magazine's editor-in-chief, Judy Wieder, stated, \"Today, Rosie's long and brave journey has led her not only to the cover of \"The Advocate\" \u2013 Rosie was honored with the magazine's Person of the Year Award for 2002 \u2013 but now to its chorus of voices, as a columnist.\"\nMarriages and children.\nO'Donnell adopted her first child, Parker Jaren O'Donnell, as an infant in 1995. Later, her wife Kelli Carpenter also adopted Parker. Parker is an aficionado of military history and in 2011 successfully lobbied his mother to send him to Valley Forge Military Academy. \nCarpenter and O'Donnell have four children together. In 2000, the family took in foster child Mia (born in 1997), and announced intentions to adopt her. In 2001, the State of Florida removed Mia from their home, and O'Donnell has since worked extensively to bring an end to the Florida law prohibiting same-sex family adoption. \nOn February 26, 2004, O'Donnell married Carpenter, a former Nickelodeon marketing executive, in San Francisco two weeks after Mayor Gavin Newsom authorized the granting of marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Her decision to marry Carpenter in San Francisco was seen as a show of defiance against then-President George W. Bush over his support for the Federal Marriage Amendment. She said in 2004, \"We were both inspired to come here after the sitting President made the vile and hateful comments he made ... [O]ne thought ran through my mind on the plane out here \u2013 with Liberty and Social justice for all.\" The couple was married by San Francisco Treasurer Susan Leal, one of the city's highest-ranking lesbian officials, and serenaded by the San Francisco Gay Men's Chorus. O'Donnell said during the trial over \"Rosie\" magazine she had decided to marry Carpenter, in part because even though they acted as spouses they legally were no closer than friends: \"We applied for spousal privilege and were denied it by the state. As a result, everything that I said to Kelli, every letter that I wrote her, every e-mail, every correspondence and conversation was entered into the record ... I am now and will forever be a total proponent of gay marriage.\"\nIn mid-November 2009, O'Donnell disclosed that Carpenter had moved out of their home in 2007. Their marriage had ended in August 2004, when it was among thousands voided by the California Supreme Court.\nO'Donnell began dating 40-year-old executive-search consultant Michelle Rounds in mid-2011. On December 5, 2011, during a break in the taping of \"The Rosie Show\", O'Donnell announced to her studio audience that she and Rounds were engaged. The two married in a private ceremony in New York on June 9, 2012. On January 9, 2013, the couple announced they had adopted a baby girl. In February 2015, O'Donnell filed for divorce from Rounds after two years of marriage, and it was settled by October. O'Donnell was awarded full custody of their daughter. Rounds died by suicide on September 15, 2017.\nIn August 2015, O'Donnell tweeted that her 17-year-old daughter, Chelsea, had gone missing from their home in Nyack along with her therapy dog. Chelsea was found a week later in Barnegat, New Jersey. In 2024, Chelsea was arrested several times on charges involving drugs, child neglect, domestic abuse, and bail jumping. \nHealth.\nO'Donnell has suffered with mental issues her entire life, attributing it to the sexual abuse that was inflicted on her by her father when she was a child. She struggles with major depressive disorder, PTSD, anxiety issues, and body-image issues and takes antidepressants. On her body-image struggles, she said, \"I think it\u2019s what your body does to protect you if you\u2019re a kid who\u2019s sexually abused, which I was.\" \nIn the summer of 2000, O'Donnell suffered a staphylococcal infection after she accidentally cut a finger, which incapacitated her for weeks and nearly led to her hand being amputated. O'Donnell has acknowledged her struggles with recurrent major depressive episodes during the fall and winter months consistent with seasonal affective disorder.\nIn 2008, O'Donnell said that she was not an alcoholic, and had temporarily given up alcohol to lose weight. She wrote on her blog: \"'Cause I was drinking too much, 'cause I didn't want to any more, 'cause it is hard to lose weight when drinking, 'cause I can never have only one.\" She started drinking again following President Trump\u2019s first election victory in 2016, revealing, \"I was very, very depressed. I was overeating. I was overdrinking \u2026 I was so depressed.\"\nO'Donnell suffered a heart attack in mid-August 2012. She said an artery was 99 percent blocked and a stent was inserted. She later posted on Twitter that to reverse her heart disease she would adopt the whole foods, plant-based diet promoted by Caldwell Esselstyn.\nO'Donnell has Type 2 diabetes.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was involved in criminal behavior and had multiple encounters with law enforcement authorities. Villon wrote about some of these experiences in his poems.\nBiography.\nBirth.\nVillon was born in Paris in 1431. One source gives the date as 19 April, 1432 [O.S. April 1, 1431].\nEarly life.\nVillon's real name may have been Fran\u00e7ois de Montcorbier or Fran\u00e7ois des Loges: both of these names appear in official documents drawn up in Villon's lifetime. In his own work, however, Villon is the only name the poet used, and he mentions it frequently in his work. His two collections of poems, especially \"Le Testament\" (also known as \"Le grand testament\"), have traditionally been read as if they were autobiographical. Other details of his life are known from court or other civil documents.\nFrom what the sources tell us, it appears that Villon was born in poverty and raised by a foster father, but that his mother was still living when her son was thirty years old. The surname \"Villon,\" the poet tells us, is the name he adopted from his foster father, Guillaume de Villon, chaplain in the collegiate church of Saint-Beno\u00eet-le-B\u00e9tourn\u00e9 and a professor of canon law, who took Villon into his house. Fran\u00e7ois describes Guillaume de Villon as \"more than a father to me\".\nStudent life.\nVillon became a student in arts, perhaps at about twelve years of age. He received a bachelor's degree from the University of Paris in 1449 and a master's degree in 1452. Between this year and 1455, nothing is known of his activities. The \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\" Eleventh Edition (1910\u20131911) says \"Attempts have been made, in the usual fashion of conjectural biography, to fill up the gap with what a young graduate of Bohemian tendencies would, could, or might have done, but they are mainly futile.\" \nAlleged criminal activities.\nOn 5 June 1455, the first major recorded incident of his life occurred. While in the Rue Saint-Jacques in the company of a priest named Giles and a girl named Isabeau, he met a Breton named Jean le Hardi, a Master of Arts, who was also with a priest, Philippe Chermoye (or Sermoise or Sermaise). A scuffle broke out and daggers were drawn. Sermaise, who is accused of having threatened and attacked Villon and drawn the first blood, not only received a dagger-thrust in return, but a blow from a stone, which struck him down. He died of his wounds. Villon fled, and was sentenced to banishment \u2013 a sentence which was remitted in January 1456 by a pardon from King Charles VII after he received the second of two petitions which made the claim that Sermaise had forgiven Villon before he died. Two different versions of the formal pardon exist; in one, the culprit is identified as \"Fran\u00e7ois des Loges, autrement dit Villon\" (\"Fran\u00e7ois des Loges, otherwise called Villon\"), in the other as \"Fran\u00e7ois de Montcorbier.\" He is also said to have named himself to the barber-surgeon who dressed his wounds as \"Michel Mouton.\" The documents of this affair at least confirm the date of his birth, by presenting him as twenty-six years old or thereabouts.\nAround Christmas 1456, the chapel of the Coll\u00e8ge de Navarre was broken open and five hundred gold crowns stolen. Villon was involved in the robbery. Many scholars believe that he fled from Paris soon afterward and that this is when he composed what is now known as the \"Le Petit Testament\" (\"The Smaller Testament\") or \"Le Lais\" (\"Legacy\" or \"Bequests\"). The robbery was not discovered until March of the next year, and it was not until May that the police came on the track of a gang of student-robbers, owing to the indiscretion of one of them, Guy Tabarie. A year more passed, when Tabarie, after being arrested, turned king's evidence and accused the absent Villon of being the ringleader, and of having gone to Angers, partly at least, to arrange similar burglaries there. Villon, for either this or another crime, was sentenced to banishment; he did not attempt to return to Paris. For four years, he was a wanderer. He may have been, as his friends Regnier de Montigny and Colin des Cayeux were, a member of a wandering gang of thieves.\n\"Le Testament\", 1461.\nThe next date for which there are recorded whereabouts for Villon is the summer of 1461; Villon wrote that he spent that summer in the bishop's prison at Meung-sur-Loire. His crime is not known, but in \"Le Testament\" (\"The Testament\") dated that year he inveighs bitterly against Bishop Thibault d'Aussigny, who held the See of Orl\u00e9ans. Villon may have been released as part of a general jail-delivery at the accession of King Louis XI and became a free man again on 2 October 1461.\nIn 1461, he wrote his most famous work, \"Le Testament\" (or \"Le Grand Testament,\" as it is also known).\nIn the autumn of 1462, he was once more living in the cloisters of Saint-Beno\u00eet.\nBanishment and disappearance.\nIn November 1462, Villon was imprisoned for theft. He was taken to the Grand Ch\u00e2telet fortress that stood at what is now Place du Ch\u00e2telet in Paris. In default of evidence, the old charge of burgling the College of Navarre was revived. No royal pardon arrived to counter the demand for restitution, but bail was accepted and Villon was released. However, he fell promptly into a street quarrel. He was arrested, tortured and condemned to be hanged (\"pendu et \u00e9trangl\u00e9\"), although the sentence was commuted to banishment by the parlement on 5 January 1463.\nVillon's fate after January 1463 is unknown. Rabelais retells two stories about him which are usually dismissed as without any basis in fact. Anthony Bonner speculated that the poet, as he left Paris, was \"broken in health and spirit.\" Bonner writes further:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks.\n\"Le Petit Testament\", also known as \"Le Lais\", was written in late 1456. The work is an ironic, comic poem that serves as Villon's will, listing bequests to his friends and acquaintances.\nIn 1461, at the age of thirty, Villon composed the longer work which came to be known as \"Le grand testament\" (1461\u20131462). This has generally been judged Villon's greatest work, and there is evidence in the work itself that Villon felt the same.\nBesides \"Le Lais\" and \"Le grand testament\", Villon's surviving works include multiple poems. Sixteen of these shorter poems vary from the serious to the light-hearted. An additional eleven poems in thieves' jargon were attributed to Villon from a very early time, but many scholars now believe them to be the work of other poets imitating Villon.\nDiscussion.\nVillon was a great innovator in terms of the themes of poetry and, through these themes, a great renovator of the forms. He understood perfectly the medieval courtly ideal, but he often chose to write against the grain, reversing the values and celebrating the lowlifes destined for the gallows, falling happily into parody or lewd jokes, and constantly innovating in his diction and vocabulary; a few minor poems make extensive use of Parisian thieves' slang. Still Villon's verse is mostly about his own life, a record of poverty, trouble, and trial which was certainly shared by his poems' intended audience.\nVillon's poems are sprinkled with mysteries and hidden jokes. They are peppered with the slang of the time and the underworld subculture in which Villon moved. His works are also replete with private jokes and full of the names of real people \u2013 rich men, royal officials, lawyers, prostitutes, and policemen \u2013 from medieval Paris.\nEnglish translation.\nComplete works.\nGeorge Heyer (1869\u20131925; father of novelist Georgette Heyer) published a translation in 1924. Oxford University Press brought out \"The Retrospect of Francois Villon: being a Rendering into English Verse of huitains I TO XLI. Of Le Testament and of the three Ballades to which they lead\", transl. George Heyer (London, 1924). On 25 December 1924 it was reviewed in \"The Times Literary Supplement\", p.\u00a0886 and the review began \"It is a little unfortunate that this translation of Villon should appear only a few months after the excellent rendering made by Mr. J. Heron Lepper. Mr. Heyer's work is very nearly as good, however: he makes happy use of quaint words and archaic idioms, and preserves with admirable skill the lyrical vigour of Villon's huitains. It is interesting to compare his version with Mr. Lepper's: both maintain a scholarly fidelity to the original, but one notes with a certain degree of surprise the extraordinary difference which they yet show.\" George Heyer was a fluent and idiomatic French speaker and the French and English are printed on opposite pages. The book also contains a number of historical and literary notes.\nJohn Heron Lepper published a translation in 1924. Another translation is one by Anthony Bonner, published in 1960. One drawback common to these English older translations is that they are all based on old editions of Villon's texts: that is, the French text that they translate (the Longnon-Foulet edition of 1932) is a text established by scholars some 80 years ago.\nA translation by the American poet Galway Kinnell (1965) contains most of Villon's works but lacks six shorter poems of disputed provenance. Peter Dale's verse translation (1974) follows the poet's rhyme scheme.\nBarbara Sargent-Baur's complete works translation (1994) includes 11 poems long attributed to Villon but possibly the work of a medieval imitator.\nA new English translation by David Georgi came out in 2013. The book also includes Villon's French, printed across from the English. Notes in the back provide a wealth of information about the poems and about medieval Paris. \"More than any translation, Georgi's emphasizes Villon's famous gallows humor...his word play, jokes, and puns\".\nSelections.\nTranslations of three Villon poems were made in 1867 by Dante Gabriel Rossetti. These three poems were \"central texts\" to Rossetti's 1870 book of \"Poems\", which explored themes from the far past, mid-past, and modern time. Rossetti used \"The Ballad of Dead Ladies\"; \"To Death, of his Lady\"; and \"His Mother's Service to Our Lady\".\nW.E. Henley, while editing \"\" translated two ballades into English criminal slang as \"Villon's Straight Tip to All Cross Coves\" and \"Villon\u2019s Good-Night\".\nAmerican poet Richard Wilbur, whose translations from French poetry and plays were widely acclaimed, also translated many of Villon's most famous ballades in \"Collected Poems: 1943\u20132004\".\nWhere are the snows of yesteryear?\nThe phrase \"Where are the snows of yester-year?\" is one of the most famous lines of translated poetry in the English-speaking world. It is the refrain in \"The Ballad of Dead Ladies\", Dante Gabriel Rossetti's translation of Villon's 1461 \"Ballade des dames du temps jadis\". In the original the line is: \"Mais o\u00f9 sont les neiges d'antan?\" [\"But where are the snows of yesteryear?\"].\nRichard Wilbur published his translation of the same poem, which he titled \"Ballade of the Ladies of Time Past\", in his \"Collected Poems: 1943\u20132004\". In his translation, the refrain is rendered as: \"But where shall last year's snow be found?\"\nCritical views.\nVillon's poems enjoyed substantial popularity in the decades after they were written. In 1489, a printed volume of his poems was published by Pierre Levet. This edition was almost immediately followed by several others. In 1533, poet and humanist scholar Cl\u00e9ment Marot published an important edition, in which he recognized Villon as one of the most significant poets in French literature, and sought to correct mistakes that had been introduced to the poetry by earlier and less careful printers.\nIn popular culture.\nArt.\nGaston Duchamp, a Cubist painter and brother of Marcel Duchamp, sought to differentiate himself from his more famous sibling, by adopting Jacques Villon as his pseudonym, as an homage to Fran\u00e7ois Villon.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Contemporary reviews ranked it as the greatest biographical film made up to that time.\nIn 2000, it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"\nProduced during the Great Depression and after the Nazi Party had taken power in Germany, the film failed to explore the key issue of antisemitic injustice in France in the late 19th century, when Zola became involved in the Dreyfus affair and worked to gain the officer's release. Some recent studies have noted the film as an example of Hollywood's timidity at the time: antisemitism was not mentioned in the film, nor was \"Jew\" said in dialogue. Some explicitly anti-Nazi films were canceled in this period, and other content was modified. This was also the period when Hollywood had established the Production Code, establishing an internal censor, in response to perceived threats of external censorship.\n\"The Life of Emile Zola\" became the second biographical film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture, after \"The Great Ziegfeld\". It was also the first Warner Bros. release to win Best Picture.\nPlot.\nSet in the mid through late 19th century, the film depicts \u00c9mile Zola's early friendship with Post-Impressionist painter Paul C\u00e9zanne and his rise to fame through his prolific writing. It also explores his involvement late in the Dreyfus affair.\nIn 1862 Paris, struggling writer Zola shares a drafty Paris attic with C\u00e9zanne. His fianc\u00e9e Alexandrine procures him a desk clerk job at a bookshop, but he is soon fired after he arouses the ire of his employer and an agent of police with his provocative novel \"The Confessions of Claude\". He then witnesses many injustices in French society, such as a crowded river slum, unlawful mining conditions and corruption in the army and government. Finally, a chance encounter with a street prostitute hiding from a police raid inspires his first bestseller, \"Nana\", an expos\u00e9 of the steamy underside of Parisian life.\nDespite the chief censor's pleading, Zola writes other successful books such as \"The Downfall\", a scathing denunciation of the French commanders' blunders and disunity that led to a disastrous defeat in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. He becomes rich and famous, marries Alexandrine and settles down to a comfortable life in his mansion. One day, his old friend C\u00e9zanne, still poor and unknown, visits him before leaving the city. He accuses Zola of having become complacent because of his success and terminates their friendship.\nAn intercepted letter for the German embassy confirms that there is a spy within the French general staff. With little thought, the army commanders decide that Captain Alfred Dreyfus, a Jew, is the traitor. He is court-martialed, publicly degraded and imprisoned on Devil's Island in French Guiana.\nLater, Colonel Picquart, the new chief of intelligence, discovers evidence implicating Major Walsin-Esterhazy, an infantry officer of Hungarian descent, as the actual spy. However, Picquart is ordered by his superiors to remain silent to avert official embarrassment, and is quickly reassigned to a remote post.\nFour years have passed since Dreyfus's degradation. His loyal wife Lucie pleads with Zola to take up her husband's cause. Zola is reluctant to surrender his comfortable life, but Lucie brings forth new evidence to pique his curiosity. He publishes an open letter known as \"J'accuse\" in the newspaper \"L'Aurore\" accusing the high command of covering up the monstrous injustice, and it causes a firestorm throughout Paris. Zola barely escapes from an angry mob incited by military agents provocateurs as riots erupt in the city streets.\nAs expected, Zola is charged with libel. His attorney Maitre Labori does his best against the presiding judge's refusal to allow him to introduce evidence about the Dreyfus affair and the perjury and biased testimony committed by all the military witnesses, except for Picquart. Zola is found guilty and sentenced to a year in prison and a 3,000-franc fine. He reluctantly accepts his friends' advice flee to London in order to continue the campaign on behalf of Dreyfus.\nWith the demand for justice reaching a worldwide level, a new French administration finally proclaims that Dreyfus is innocent, and those responsible for the coverup are dismissed or commit suicide. Walsin-Esterhazy flees the country in disgrace. After his return to Paris, Zola dies of accidental carbon monoxide poisoning caused by a faulty stove the night before the public ceremony in which Dreyfus is exonerated and inducted into the Legion of Honor. His body is buried in the Panth\u00e9on in Paris and he is given the farewell of a hero and warrior.\nProduction.\nIn 1936, literary agent Heinz Herald first proposed the story to producer Henry Blanke, and Hal B. Wallis, Warner Bros.' executive producer for biographical pictures, assigned Herald and Geza Herczeg to develop the script. Their first treatment, titled \"Emile Zola: The Conscience of Humanity\", centered around the Dreyfus affair, with Zola's literary career merely a background plot. Herald and Herczeg saw Zola's struggles to be similar to those faced by Louis Pasteur in \"The Story of Louis Pasteur\", and their script ended with Zola triumphantly speaking out as a voice of truth as a parallel for the incipient turmoil taking place in Europe. Their 200-page script draft was submitted in November 1936, which staff writer Norman Reilly Raine was assigned to revise. Blanke supervised the creation of the final script, which included further contributions by Herald, Herczeg and Raine but also those from star Paul Muni, director William Dieterle and Wallis. The final script was ready by February 1937, and an initial budget of $699,000 was allocated to the production of the film.\nWallis and Blanke's relationship during production of the film was contentious; while Wallis wished to follow the successful formula established by \"The Story of Louis Pasteur\", Blanke fought for the integrity of the project. The two men clashed over nearly every aspect of production, including the casting of the female lead; Wallis wished to cast Josephine Hutchinson, who had played Pasteur's wife, but Blanke disagreed and a compromise was reached in the casting of Gloria Holden. Blanke was determined to imbue the picture with authenticity and argued that Muni's appearance should differ starkly from that of the Pasteur picture, but Wallis, concerned with Muni's box-office appeal, overruled Blanke and instructed the makeup artist to maintain Muni's recognizable features above all else. Blanke threatened to leave the project following a bitter dispute over the hiring of a costumer, but Wallis relented.\nFilming began in March 1937 and was scheduled for 42 days. Muni's climactic courtroom speech was filmed in one six-minute take, but Wallis requested that Blanke and Dieterle intersperse the scene with crowd shots. At the time, it was the longest continuous courtroom scene. Wallis and Blanke also argued over the quality of actor Ben Welden's performance as Paul C\u00e9zanne, and actor Vladimir Sokoloff was brought in to reshoot Welden's scenes. The reshoots caused the production of the film to extend ten days over schedule, and filming was completed on May 10.\nWallis and Blanke also fought over the film's title. While Wallis favored \"The Story of Emile Zola\", Blanke suggested alternatives such as \"The Truth Is on the March\", \"I Accuse\" and \"Destiny\" before \"The Life of Emile Zola\" was chosen, though the film does not actually depict much of Zola's life.\nMuni was paid $50,000 for his performance.\nReception and interpretation.\nFollowing a successful preview screening excluding Max Steiner's musical score, \"The Life of Emile Zola\" premiered on August 11, 1937, and became an immediate sensation. Soon after, Warner Bros. placed full-page advertisements in several Los Angeles newspapers congratulating the cast and crew.\nContemporary reviews were nearly unanimous in their praise. Frank S. Nugent of \"The New York Times\" wrote: \n\"Rich, dignified, honest, and strong, it is at once the finest historical film ever made and the greatest screen biography, greater even than \"The Story of Louis Pasteur\" with which the Warners squared their conscience last year ... Paul Muni's portrayal of Zola is, without doubt, the best thing he has done.\"\n\"Variety\" wrote that the film was \"a vibrant, tense and emotional story ...

The website's critics consensus reads, \"Urgently relevant in an era of escalating bigotry and fascism, \"The Life of Emile Zola\" is a respectful and staid tribute to the French novelist, enlivened by Paul Muni's chameleonic prowess.\"\nThe film is mentioned in the children's novel \"The Saturdays\", relating a coal gas leak incident.\nAcademy Award wins and nominations.\nAt the 10th Academy Awards, the film received ten nominations (and thereby became the first film in Academy Award history to reach double digits for nominations) and won three awards.\nControversy.\nIn his 2013 book titled \"The Collaboration: Hollywood's Pact with Hitler\", Ben Urwand wrote that Hollywood producers made a pact to avoid antagonizing Adolf Hitler and aided the Nazis by suppressing films that portrayed the Nazis' brutality: \"The studios cancelled several explicitly anti-Nazi films planned for production, and deleted from several other movies anything that could be construed as critical of the Nazis, along with anything that might be seen as favorable to the Jews\u2014or even a simple acknowledgment that they existed.\"\nUrwand wrote that Jewish studio head Jack L. Warner ordered the word \"Jew\" to be excised from the script and that Georg Gyssling, the Nazi consul to the United States in Los Angeles, was occasionally allowed to review and provide recommendations on films before they were released, with changes sometimes made based on his comments. However, Urwand's thesis that Warner was collaborating with the Nazis has been strongly disputed by Warner's family members, especially Alicia Meyer.\nIn his study \"Hollywood and Hitler, 1933\u20131939,\" Thomas Doherty also analyzed the topic. David Denby, who wrote a long overview article about the issue in \"The New Yorker\", points out that while Doherty supports some of Urwand's thesis, Doherty provides more context for the studios' behavior, setting it against the political culture of the period. The studios were under social pressure during the Great Depression to produce films that helped the United States weather the crisis. There were fears of political radicalism in the U.S. while European movements, from the Nazis to communism in the Soviet Union, were considered threats. Denby believes that the predominantly Jewish studio heads were timid and overly cautious, appearing to be fearful of their place in American society.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Shale is characterized by its tendency to split into thin layers (laminae) less than one centimeter in thickness. This property is called \"fissility\". Shale is the most common sedimentary rock.\nThe term \"shale\" is sometimes applied more broadly, as essentially a synonym for mudrock, rather than in the narrower sense of clay-rich fissile mudrock.\nTexture.\nShale typically exhibits varying degrees of fissility. Because of the parallel orientation of clay mineral flakes in shale, it breaks into thin layers, often splintery and usually parallel to the otherwise indistinguishable bedding planes. Non-fissile rocks of similar composition and particle size (less than 0.0625\u00a0mm) are described as mudstones (1/3 to 2/3 silt particles) or claystones (less than 1/3 silt). Rocks with similar particle sizes but with less clay (greater than 2/3 silt) and therefore grittier are siltstones.\nComposition and color.\nShales are typically grey in color and are composed of clay minerals and quartz grains. The addition of variable amounts of minor constituents alters the color of the rock. Red, brown and green colors are indicative of ferric oxide (hematite \u2013 reds), iron hydroxide (goethite \u2013 browns and limonite \u2013 yellow), or micaceous minerals (chlorite, biotite and illite \u2013 greens). The color shifts from reddish to greenish as iron in the oxidized (ferric) state is converted to iron in the reduced (ferrous) state. Black shale results from the presence of greater than one percent carbonaceous material and indicates a reducing environment. Pale blue to blue-green shales typically are rich in carbonate minerals.\nClays are the major constituent of shales and other mudrocks. The clay minerals represented are largely kaolinite, montmorillonite and illite. Clay minerals of Late Tertiary mudstones are expandable smectites, whereas in older rocks (especially in mid-to early Paleozoic shales) illites predominate. The transformation of smectite to illite produces silica, sodium, calcium, magnesium, iron and water. These released elements form authigenic quartz, chert, calcite, dolomite, ankerite, hematite and albite, all trace to minor (except quartz) minerals found in shales and other mudrocks. A typical shale is composed of about 58% clay minerals, 28% quartz, 6% feldspar, 5% carbonate minerals, and 2% iron oxides. Most of the quartz is detrital (part of the original sediments that formed the shale) rather than authigenic (crystallized within the shale after deposition).\nShales and other mudrocks contain roughly 95 percent of the organic matter in all sedimentary rocks. However, this amounts to less than one percent by mass in an average shale. Black shales, which form in anoxic conditions, contain reduced free carbon along with ferrous iron (Fe2+) and sulfur (S2\u2212). Amorphous iron sulfide, along with carbon, produce the black coloration. Because amorphous iron sulfide gradually converts to pyrite, which is not an important pigment, young shales may be quite dark from their iron sulfide content, in spite of a modest carbon content (less than 1%), while a black color in an ancient shale indicates a high carbon content.\nMost shales are marine in origin, and the groundwater in shale formations is often highly saline. There is evidence that shale acts as a semipermeable medium, allowing water to pass through while retaining dissolved salts.\nFormation.\nThe fine particles that compose shale can remain suspended in water long after the larger particles of sand have been deposited. As a result, shales are typically deposited in very slow moving water and are often found in lakes and lagoonal deposits, in river deltas, on floodplains and offshore below the wave base. Thick deposits of shale are found near ancient continental margins and foreland basins. Some of the most widespread shale formations were deposited by epicontinental seas. Black shales are common in Cretaceous strata on the margins of the Atlantic Ocean, where they were deposited in fault-bounded silled basins associated with the opening of the Atlantic during the breakup of Pangaea. These basins were anoxic, in part because of restricted circulation in the narrow Atlantic, and in part because the very warm Cretaceous seas lacked the circulation of cold bottom water that oxygenates the deep oceans today.\nMost clay must be deposited as aggregates and floccules, since the settling rate of individual clay particles is extremely slow. Flocculation is very rapid once the clay encounters highly saline sea water. Whereas individual clay particles are less than 4 microns in size, the clumps of clay particles produced by flocculation vary in size from a few tens of microns to over 700 microns in diameter. The floccules start out water-rich, but much of the water is expelled from the floccules as the clay minerals bind more tightly together over time (a process called syneresis). Clay pelletization by organisms that filter feed is important where flocculation is inhibited. Filter feeders produce an estimated 12 metric tons of clay pellets per square kilometer per year along the U.S. Gulf Coast.\nAs sediments continue to accumulate, the older, more deeply buried sediments begin to undergo diagenesis. This mostly consists of compaction and lithification of the clay and silt particles. Early stages of diagenesis, described as \"eogenesis\", take place at shallow depths (a few tens of meters) and are characterized by bioturbation and mineralogical changes in the sediments, with only slight compaction. Pyrite may be formed in anoxic mud at this stage of diagenesis. \nDeeper burial is accompanied by \"mesogenesis\", during which most of the compaction and lithification takes place. As the sediments come under increasing pressure from overlying sediments, sediment grains move into more compact arrangements, ductile grains (such as clay mineral grains) are deformed, and pore space is reduced. In addition to this physical compaction, chemical compaction may take place via pressure solution. Points of contact between grains are under the greatest strain, and the strained mineral is more soluble than the rest of the grain. As a result, the contact points are dissolved away, allowing the grains to come into closer contact. \nIt is during compaction that shale develops its fissility, likely through mechanical compaction of the original open framework of clay particles. The particles become strongly oriented into parallel layers that give the shale its distinctive fabric. Fissility likely develops early in the compaction process, at relatively shallow depth, since fissility does not seem to vary with depth in thick formations. Kaolinite flakes have less tendency to align in parallel layers than other clays, so kaolinite-rich clay is more likely to form nonfissile mudstone than shale. On the other hand, black shales often have very pronounced fissility (\"paper shales\") due to binding of hydrocarbon molecules to the faces of the clay particles, which weakens the binding between particles.\nLithification follows closely on compaction, as increased temperatures at depth hasten deposition of cement that binds the grains together. Pressure solution contributes to cementing, as the mineral dissolved from strained contact points is redeposited in the unstrained pore spaces. The clay minerals may be altered as well. For example, smectite is altered to illite at temperatures of about , releasing water in the process. Other alteration reactions include the alteration of smectite to chlorite and of kaolinite to illite at temperatures between . Because of these reactions, illite composes 80% of Precambrian shales, versus about 25% of young shales.\nUnroofing of buried shale is accompanied by \"telogenesis\", the third and final stage of diagenesis. As erosion reduces the depth of burial, renewed exposure to meteoric water produces additional changes to the shale, such as dissolution of some of the cement to produce secondary porosity. Pyrite may be oxidized to produce gypsum.\nBlack shales are dark, as a result of being especially rich in unoxidized carbon. Common in some Paleozoic and Mesozoic strata, black shales were deposited in anoxic, reducing environments, such as in stagnant water columns. Some black shales contain abundant heavy metals such as molybdenum, uranium, vanadium, and zinc. The enriched values are of controversial origin, having been alternatively attributed to input from hydrothermal fluids during or after sedimentation or to slow accumulation from sea water over long periods of sedimentation.\nFossils, animal tracks or burrows and even raindrop impressions are sometimes preserved on shale bedding surfaces. Shales may also contain concretions consisting of pyrite, apatite, or various carbonate minerals.\nShales that are subject to heat and pressure of metamorphism alter into a hard, fissile, metamorphic rock known as slate. With continued increase in metamorphic grade the sequence is phyllite, then schist and finally gneiss.\nAs hydrocarbon source rock.\nShale is the most common source rock for hydrocarbons (natural gas and petroleum). The lack of coarse sediments in most shale beds reflects the absence of strong currents in the waters of the depositional basin. These might have oxygenated the waters and destroyed organic matter before it could accumulate. The absence of carbonate rock in shale beds reflects the absence of organisms that might have secreted carbonate skeletons, also likely due to an anoxic environment. As a result, about 95% of organic matter in sedimentary rocks is found in shales and other mudrocks. Individual shale beds typically have an organic matter content of about 1%, but the richest source rocks may contain as much as 40% organic matter.\nThe organic matter in shale is converted over time from the original proteins, polysaccharides, lipids, and other organic molecules to kerogen, which at the higher temperatures found at greater depths of burial is further converted to graphite and petroleum.\nHistorical mining terminology.\nBefore the mid-19th century, the terms slate, shale and schist were not sharply distinguished. In the context of underground coal mining, shale was frequently referred to as slate well into the 20th century. Black shale associated with coal seams is called black metal.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

His novels often featured main characters who succeeded at their objectives despite a lack of a firm moral code, and literary situations that more closely resemble studies of nature than tales of choice and agency. Dreiser's best-known novels include \"Sister Carrie\" (1900) and \"An American Tragedy\" (1925).\nEarly life.\nDreiser was born in Terre Haute, Indiana, to John Paul Dreiser and Sarah Maria (n\u00e9e Schanab). John Dreiser was a German immigrant from Mayen in the Rhine Province of Prussia, and Sarah was from the Mennonite farming community near Dayton, Ohio. Her family disowned her for converting to Roman Catholicism in order to marry John Dreiser. Theodore was the twelfth of thirteen children (the ninth of the ten surviving). Paul Dresser (1857\u20131906) was one of his older brothers; Paul changed the spelling of his name as he became a popular songwriter. They were raised as Catholics.\nAccording to Daniels, Dreiser's childhood was characterized by severe poverty. His father could be harsh. His later fiction reflects these experiences.\nAfter graduating from high school in Warsaw, Indiana, Dreiser attended Indiana University Bloomington in 1889\u20131890 without taking a degree.\nCareer.\nJournalism.\nIn 1892, Dreiser started work as a reporter and drama critic for newspapers in Chicago, St. Louis, Toledo, Pittsburgh and New York. During this period he published his first work of fiction, \"The Return of Genius\", which appeared in the \"Chicago Daily Globe\" under the name Carl Dreiser. By 1895 he was writing articles for magazines. He authored articles on writers such as Nathaniel Hawthorne, William Dean Howells, Israel Zangwill, and John Burroughs and interviewed public figures such as Andrew Carnegie, Marshall Field, Thomas Edison, and Theodore Thomas. His other interviewees included Lillian Nordica, Emilia E. Barr, Philip Armour, and Alfred Stieglitz.\nIn 1895, Dreiser convinced business associates of his songwriter brother Paul to give him the editorship of a magazine called \"Ev'ry Month\", in which he published his first story, \"Forgotten\" a tale based on a song of his brother's titled \"The Letter That Never Came\". Dreiser continued editing magazines, becoming editor of the women's magazine \"The Delineator\" in June 1907. As Daniels noted, he thereby began to achieve financial independence.\nLiterary career.\nDuring 1899, Dreiser and his first wife Sara stayed with Arthur Henry and his wife Maude Wood Henry at the House of Four Pillars, an 1830s Greek Revival house in Maumee, Ohio. There Dreiser began work on his first novel, \"Sister Carrie\", published in 1900. Unknown to Maude, Arthur sold a half-interest in the house to Dreiser to finance a move to New York without her.\nIn \"Sister Carrie\", Dreiser portrayed a changing society, writing about a young woman who flees rural life for the city (Chicago), fails to find work that pays a living wage, falls prey to several men, and ultimately achieves fame as an actress. The novel sold poorly and was considered controversial because it featured a country girl who pursues her dreams of fame and fortune through relationships with men. The book has acquired a considerable reputation. It has been called by Donald L. Miller the \"greatest of all American urban novels.\"\nIn 1901 Dreiser's short story \"Nigger Jeff\" was published in \"Ainslee's Magazine\". It was based on a lynching he witnessed in 1893. Dreiser's short story \"Old Rogaum and His Theresa\" was originally published in 1901.\nHis second novel \"Jennie Gerhardt\" was published in 1911. Dreiser's portrayals of young women as protagonists dramatized the social changes of urbanization, as young people moved from rural villages to cities.\nDreiser's first commercial success was \"An American Tragedy\", published in 1925. From 1892, when Dreiser began work as a newspaperman, he had begun\nto observe a certain type of crime in the United States that proved very common. It seemed to spring from the fact that almost every young person was possessed of an ingrown ambition to be somebody financially and socially. Fortune hunting became a disease with the frequent result of a peculiarly American kind of crime, a form of \"murder for money\", when \"the young ambitious lover of some poorer girl\" found \"a more attractive girl with money or position\" but could not get rid of the first girl, usually because of pregnancy.\nDreiser claimed to have collected such stories every year between 1895 and 1935. He based his novel on details and the setting of the 1906 murder of Grace Brown by Chester Gillette in upstate New York, a crime that attracted widespread attention from newspapers. While the novel sold well, it also was criticized for its portrayal of a man without morals who commits a sordid murder.\nThough known primarily as a novelist, Dreiser also wrote short stories, publishing his first collection of 11, entitled, \"Free and Other Stories\" in 1918.\nHis story \"My Brother Paul\" was a biography of his older brother Paul Dresser, who became a famous songwriter in the 1890s. This story formed the basis for the 1942 romantic movie \"My Gal Sal\".\nDreiser also wrote poetry. His poem \"The Aspirant\" (1929) continues his theme of poverty and ambition: a young man in a shabbily furnished room describes his own and the other tenants' dreams, and asks \"why? why?\" The poem appeared in \"The Poetry Quartos\", collected and printed by Paul Johnston, and published by Random House in 1929.\nOther works include \"Trilogy of Desire\", based on the life of Charles Tyson Yerkes (1837\u20131905), who became a Chicago streetcar tycoon. It is composed of \"The Financier\" (1912), \"The Titan\" (1914), and \"The Stoic\". The last was published posthumously in 1947.\nDreiser often was forced to battle against censorship because his depiction of some aspects of life, such as sexual promiscuity, offended authorities and challenged popular standards of acceptable opinion. In 1930 he was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature by Swedish author Anders \u00d6sterling, but was passed over by the Nobel Committee in favor of Sinclair Lewis.\nPolitical commitment.\nPolitically, Dreiser was involved in several campaigns defending radicals he believed victims of social injustice. These included the lynching of Frank Little, one of the leaders of the Industrial Workers of the World, the Sacco and Vanzetti case, the deportation of Emma Goldman, and the conviction of the trade union leader Thomas Mooney. In November 1931, Dreiser led the National Committee for the Defense of Political Prisoners (NCDPP) to the coalfields of southeastern Kentucky to take testimony from miners in Pineville and Harlan on the pattern of violence against the miners and their unions by the coal operators. The pattern of violence was known as the Harlan County War.\nDreiser was a committed socialist and wrote several nonfiction books on political issues. These included \"Dreiser Looks at Russia\" (1928), the result of his 1927 trip to the Soviet Union, and two books presenting a critical perspective on capitalist America, \"Tragic America\" (1931) and \"America Is Worth Saving\" (1941). He praised the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin during the Great Terror and the non-aggression pact with Adolf Hitler. Dreiser joined the Communist Party USA in August 1945 and later became the honorary president of the League of American Writers. Although less politically radical friends, such as H. L. Mencken, spoke of Dreiser's relationship with communism as an \"unimportant detail in his life\", Dreiser's biographer Jerome Loving notes that his political activities since the early 1930s had \"clearly been in concert with ostensible communist aims with regard to the working class.\"\nPersonal life.\nDreiser's appearance and personality were described by Edgar Lee Masters in a poem, https://, published in \"The New York Times Review of Books\". \nWhile working as a newspaperman in St. Louis, Dreiser met schoolteacher Sara Osborne White. They became engaged in 1893 and married on December 28, 1898. They separated in 1909, partly due to Dreiser's infatuation with Thelma Cudlipp, the teenage daughter of a colleague, but were never formally divorced.\nIn 1913, he began a romantic relationship with the actress and painter Kyra Markham. In 1919, Dreiser met his cousin Helen Patges Richardson (1894\u20131955) with whom he began an affair. Through the following decades, she remained the constant woman in his life, even through many more temporary love affairs (such as one with his secretary Clara Jaeger in the 1930s). Helen tolerated Dreiser's affairs, and they remained together until his death. Dreiser and Helen married on June 13, 1944, his first wife Sara having died in 1942.\nDreiser planned to return from his first European vacation on the \"Titanic\", but was talked out of it by an English publisher who recommended he board a cheaper ship.\nDreiser was an atheist.\nLegacy.\nLiterature.\nDreiser had an enormous influence on the generation that followed his. In his tribute \"Dreiser\" from \"Horses and Men\" (1923), Sherwood Anderson writes (almost repeated 1916 article):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAlfred Kazin characterized Dreiser as \"stronger than all the others of his time, and at the same time more poignant; greater than the world he has described, but as significant as the people in it,\" while Larzer Ziff (UC Berkeley) remarked that Dreiser \"succeeded beyond any of his predecessors or successors in producing a great American business novel.\"\nRenowned mid-century literary critic Irving Howe spoke of Dreiser as ranking \"among the American giants, the very few American giants we have had.\" A British view of Dreiser came from the publisher Rupert Hart-Davis: \"Theodore Dreiser's books are enough to stop me in my tracks, never mind his letters\u2014that slovenly turgid style describing endless business deals, with a seduction every hundred pages as light relief. If he's the great American novelist, give me the Marx Brothers every time.\" The literary scholar F. R. Leavis wrote that Dreiser \"seems as though he learned English from a newspaper. He gives the feeling that he doesn't have any native language\".\nOne of Dreiser's strongest champions during his lifetime, H. L. Mencken, declared \"that he is a great artist, and that no other American of his generation left so wide and handsome a mark upon the national letters. American writing, before and after his time, differed almost as much as biology before and after Darwin. He was a man of large originality, of profound feeling, and of unshakable courage. All of us who write are better off because he lived, worked, and hoped.\"\nDreiser's great theme was the tremendous tensions that can arise among ambition, desire, and social mores.\nAcademia.\nDreiser Hall, erected 1950 on the Indiana State University campus in Terre Haute, Indiana, houses the University's Communications Programs, Student Media (WISU), Sycamore Video and \"The Sycamore\" (annual yearbook), classroom and lecture space as well as a 255-seat proscenium theater. It was named for Dreiser in 1966.\nDreiser College, at Stony Brook University located in Stony Brook, New York, is also named after him.\nIn 2011, Dreiser was inducted into the Chicago Literary Hall of Fame.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "44214", "revid": "1398", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44214", "title": "Slate", "text": "Metamorphic rock\nSlate is a fine-grained, foliated, homogeneous, metamorphic rock derived from an original shale-type sedimentary rock composed of clay or volcanic ash through low-grade, regional metamorphism. It is the finest-grained foliated metamorphic rock. Foliation may not correspond to the original sedimentary layering, but instead is in planes perpendicular to the direction of metamorphic compression.\nThe foliation in slate, called \"slaty cleavage\", is caused by strong compression in which fine-grained clay forms flakes to regrow in planes perpendicular to the compression. When expertly \"cut\" by striking parallel to the foliation with a specialized tool in the quarry, many slates display a property called fissility, forming smooth, flat sheets of stone which have long been used for roofing, floor tiles, and billiard tables. Slate is frequently grey in color, especially when seen \"en masse\" covering roofs. However, slate occurs in a variety of colors even from a single locality; for example, slate from North Wales can be found in many shades of grey, from pale to dark, and may also be purple, green, or cyan. Slate is not to be confused with shale, from which it may be formed, or schist.\nThe word \"slate\" is also used for certain types of object made from slate rock. It may mean a single roofing tile made of slate, or a writing slate, which was traditionally a small, smooth piece of the rock, often framed in wood, used with chalk as a notepad or notice board, and especially for recording charges in pubs and inns. The phrases \"clean slate\" and \"blank slate\" come from this usage.\nDescription.\nSlate is a fine-grained, metamorphic rock that shows no obvious compositional layering but can easily be split into thin slabs and plates. It is usually formed by low-grade regional metamorphism of mudrock. This mild degree of metamorphism produces a rock in which the individual mineral crystals remain microscopic in size, producing a characteristic slaty cleavage in which fresh cleavage surfaces appear dull. This is in contrast to the silky cleaved surfaces of phyllite, which is the next-higher grade of metamorphic rock derived from mudstone. The direction of cleavage is independent of any sedimentary structures in the original mudrock, reflecting instead the direction of regional compression.\nSlaty cleavage is continuous, meaning that the individual cleavage planes are too closely spaced to be discernible in hand samples. The texture of the slate is totally dominated by these pervasive cleavage planes. Under a microscope, the slate is found to consist of very thin lenses of quartz and feldspar (QF-domains) separated by layers of mica (M-domains). These are typically less than 100 \u03bcm (micron) thick. Because slate was formed in low heat and pressure, compared to most other metamorphic rocks, some fossils can be found in slate; sometimes even microscopic remains of delicate organisms can be found in slate.\nThe process of conversion of mudrock to slate involves a loss of up to 50% of the volume of the mudrock as it is compacted. Grains of platy minerals, such as clay minerals, are rotated to form parallel layers perpendicular to the direction of compaction, which begin to impart cleavage to the rock. Slaty cleavage is fully developed as the clay minerals begin to be converted to chlorite and mica. Organic carbon in the rock is converted to graphite.\nSlate is mainly composed of the minerals quartz, illite, and chlorite, which account for up to 95% of its composition. The most important accessory minerals are iron oxides (such as hematite and magnetite), iron sulfides (such as pyrite), and carbonate minerals. Feldspar may be present as albite or, less commonly, orthoclase. Occasionally, as in the purple slates of North Wales, ferrous (iron(II)) reduction spheres form around iron nuclei, leaving a light-green, spotted texture. These spheres are sometimes deformed by a subsequent applied stress field into ovoids, which appear as ellipses when viewed on a cleavage plane of the specimen. However, some evidence shows that reduced spots may also form after deformation and acquire an elliptical shape from preferential infiltration along the cleavage direction, so caution is required in using reduction ellipsoids to estimate deformation.\nTerminology.\nBefore the mid-19th century, the terms \"slate\", \"shale\", and \"schist\" were not sharply distinguished. In the context of underground coal mining in the United States, the term slate was commonly used to refer to shale well into the 20th century. For example, roof slate referred to shale above a coal seam, and draw slate referred to shale that fell from the mine roof as the coal was removed.\nThe British Geological Survey recommends that the term \"slate\" be used in scientific writings only when very little else is known about the rock that would allow a more definite classification. For example, if the characteristics of the rock show definitely that it was formed by metamorphosis of shale, it should be described in scientific writings as a metashale. If its origin is uncertain, but the rock is known to be rich in mica, it should be described as a pelite.\nUses.\nConstruction.\nSlate can be made into roofing slate, a type of roof tile which are installed by a slater. Slate has two lines of breakability\u2014cleavage and grain\u2014which make it possible to split the stone into thin sheets. When broken, slate retains a natural appearance while remaining relatively flat and easy to stack. A series of \"slate booms\" occurred in Europe from the 1870s until the First World War following improvements in railway, road and waterway transportation systems.\nSlate is particularly suitable as a roofing material as it has an extremely low water absorption index of less than 0.4%, making the material resistant to frost damage. Natural slate, which requires only minimal processing, has an embodied energy that compares favorably with other roofing materials.\nNatural slate is used by building professionals as a result of its beauty and durability. Slate is incredibly durable and can last several hundred years, often with little or no maintenance. Natural slate is also fire resistant and energy efficient.\nSlate roof tiles are usually fixed (fastened) either with nails or with hooks (as is common with Spanish slate). In the UK, fixing is typically with double nails onto timber battens (England and Wales) or nailed directly onto timber sarking boards (Scotland and Northern Ireland). Nails were traditionally of copper, although there are modern alloy and stainless steel alternatives. Both these methods, if used properly, provide a long-lasting weathertight roof with a lifespan of around 60\u2013125 years.\nSome mainland European slate suppliers suggest that using hook fixing means that:\nThe metal hooks are, however, visible and may be unsuitable for historic properties.\nSlate tiles are often used for interior and exterior flooring, stairs, walkways and wall cladding. Tiles are installed and set on mortar and grouted along the edges. Chemical sealants are often used on tiles to improve durability and appearance, increase stain resistance, reduce efflorescence, and increase or reduce surface smoothness. Tiles are often sold gauged, meaning that the back surface is ground for ease of installation. Slate flooring can be slippery when used in external locations subject to rain.\nSlate tiles were used in 19th century UK building construction (apart from roofs) and in slate quarrying areas such as Blaenau Ffestiniog and Bethesda, Wales there are still many buildings wholly constructed of slate. Slates can also be set into walls to provide a rudimentary damp-proof membrane. Small offcuts are used as shims to level floor joists. In areas where slate is plentiful it is also used in pieces of various sizes for building walls and hedges, sometimes combined with other kinds of stone.\nOther uses.\nBecause it is a good electrical insulator and fireproof, it was used to construct early-20th-century electric switchboards and relay controls for large electric motors. Because of its thermal stability and chemical inertness, slate has been used for laboratory bench tops and for billiard table tops.\nSlate was used by earlier cultures as whetstone to hone knives, but whetstones are nowadays more typically made of quartz. In 18th- and 19th-century schools, slate was extensively used for blackboards and individual writing slates, for which slate or chalk pencils were used. In modern homes slate is often used as table coasters.\nIn areas where it is available, high-quality slate is used for tombstones and commemorative tablets. In some cases slate was used by the ancient Maya civilization to fashion stelae. Slate was the traditional material of choice for black Go stones in Japan, alongside clamshell for white stones. It is now considered to be a luxury.\nPennsylvania slate is widely used in the manufacture of turkey calls used for hunting turkeys. The tones produced from the slate, when scratched with various species of wood striker, imitates almost exactly the calls of all four species of wild turkey in North America: eastern, Rio Grande, Osceola and Merriam's.\nExtraction.\nSlate is found in the Arctic and was used by Inuit to make the blades for ulus. China has vast slate deposits; in recent years its export of finished and unfinished slate has increased. Deposits of slate exist throughout Australia, with large reserves quarried in the Adelaide Hills in Willunga, Kanmantoo, and the Mid North at Mintaro and Spalding. Slate is abundant in Brazil, the world's second-largest producer of slate, around Papagaios in Minas Gerais, which extracts 95 percent of Brazil's slate. However, not all \"slate\" products from Brazil are entitled to bear the CE mark.\nMost slate in Europe today comes from Spain, the world's largest producer and exporter of natural slate, and 90 percent of Europe's natural slate used for roofing originates from the slate industry there. Lesser slate-producing regions in present-day Europe include Wales (with UNESCO landscape status and a museum at Llanberis), Cornwall (famously the village of Delabole), Cumbria (see Burlington Slate Quarries, Honister Slate Mine and Skiddaw Slate) and, formerly in the West Highlands of Scotland, around Ballachulish and the Slate Islands in the United Kingdom. Parts of France (Anjou, Loire Valley, Ardennes, Brittany, Savoie) and Belgium (Ardennes), Liguria in northern Italy, especially between the town of Lavagna (whose name is inherited as the term for \"chalkboard\" in Italian) and Fontanabuona valley; Portugal especially around Valongo in the north of the country. Germany's Moselle River region, Hunsr\u00fcck (with a former mine open as a museum at Fell), Eifel, Westerwald, Thuringia and north Bavaria; and Alta, Norway (actually schist, not a true slate). Some of the slate from Wales and Cumbria is colored slate (non-blue): purple and formerly green in Wales and green in Cumbria.\nIn North America, slate is produced in Newfoundland, eastern Pennsylvania, Buckingham County, Virginia, and the Slate Valley region in Vermont and New York, where colored slate is mined in the Granville, New York, area. A major slating operation existed in Monson, Maine, during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, where the slate is usually dark purple to blackish, and many local structures are roofed with slate tiles. The roof of St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City and the headstone of John F. Kennedy's gravesite in Arlington National Cemetery are both made of Monson slate.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Scale models are often combined with high speed photography or matte shots to make gravitational and other effects appear convincing to the viewer. The use of miniatures has largely been superseded by computer-generated imagery in contemporary cinema.\nWhere a miniature appears in the foreground of a shot, this is often very close to the camera lens \u2014 for example when matte-painted backgrounds are used. Since the exposure is set to the object being filmed so the actors appear well-lit, the miniature must be over-lit in order to balance the exposure and eliminate any depth of field differences that would otherwise be visible. This foreground miniature usage is referred to as forced perspective. Another form of miniature effect uses stop motion animation.\nThe use of scale models in the creation of visual effects by the entertainment industry dates back to the earliest days of cinema. Models and miniatures are copies of people, animals, buildings, settings, and objects. Miniatures or models are used to represent things that do not really exist, or that are too expensive or difficult to film in reality, such as explosions, floods, or fires.\nFrom 1900 to the mid-1960s.\nFrench director Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s incorporated special effects in his 1902 film \"Le Voyage dans la Lune\" (\"A Trip to the Moon\") \u2014 including double-exposure, split screens, miniatures and stop-action.\nSome of the most influential visual effects films of these early years such as \"Metropolis\" (1927), \"Citizen Kane\" (1941), \"Godzilla\" (1954) \"The Ten Commandments\" (1956). The 1933 film \"King Kong\" made extensive use of miniature effects including scale models and stop-motion animation of miniature elements.\nFrom the mid-1960s.\nThe use of miniatures in \"\" was a major development. In production for three years, the film was a significant advancement in creating convincing models.\nIn the early 1970s, miniatures were often used to depict disasters in such films as \"The Poseidon Adventure\" (1972), \"Earthquake\" (1974) and \"The Towering Inferno\" (1974).\nThe resurgence of the science fiction genre in film in the late 1970s saw miniature fabrication rise to new heights in such films as \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\", (1977), \"Star Wars\" (also 1977), \"Alien\" (1979), \"\" (1979) and \"Blade Runner\" (1982). Iconic film sequences such as the tanker truck explosion from \"The Terminator\" (1984) and the bridge destruction in \"True Lies\" (1994) were achieved through the use of large-scale miniatures.\nLargely replaced by CGI.\nThe release of \"Jurassic Park\" (1993) was a turning point in the use of computers to create effects for which physical miniatures would have previously been employed.\nWhile the use of computer-generated imagery (CGI) has largely overtaken their use since then, they are still often employed, especially for projects requiring physical interaction with fire, explosions, or water.\n\"Independence Day\" (1996), \"Titanic\" (1997), \"Godzilla\" (1998), the \"Star Wars\" prequel trilogy (1999\u20132005), \"The Lord of the Rings\" trilogy (2001\u20132003), \"Casino Royale\" (2006), \"The Dark Knight\" (2008), \"Inception\" (2010), and \"Interstellar\" (2014) are examples of highly successful films that have utilized miniatures for a significant component of their visual effects work.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "44217", "revid": "1983703", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44217", "title": "Menhaden", "text": "Informal name for some fishes (genera Brevoortia and Ethmidium)\nMenhaden, also known as mossbunker, bunker, and \"the most important fish in the sea\", are forage fish of the genera Brevoortia and Ethmidium, two genera of marine fish in the order Clupeiformes. \"Menhaden\" is a blend of \"poghaden\" (\"pogy\" for short) and an Algonquian word akin to Narragansett \"munnawhattea\u00fbg\", derived from \"munnohquohteau\" (\"he fertilizes\"), referring to their use of the fish as fertilizer. It is generally thought that Pilgrims were advised by Tisquantum (also known as Squanto) to plant menhaden with their crops. In southeastern South America they are called \"savelhas\" or \"saracas.\"\nDescription.\nMenhaden are flat and have soft flesh and a deeply forked tail. They rarely exceed in length, and have a varied weight range. Gulf menhaden and Atlantic menhaden are small oily-fleshed fish, bright silver, and characterized by a series of smaller spots behind the main humeral spot. They tend to have larger scales than yellowfin menhaden and finescale menhaden. In addition, yellowfin menhaden tail rays are a bright yellow in contrast to those of the Atlantic menhaden.\nTaxonomy.\nRecent taxonomic work using DNA comparisons have organized the North American menhadens into large-scaled (Gulf and Atlantic menhaden) and small-scaled (Finescale and Yellowfin menhaden) designations.\nThe menhaden consist of two genera and seven species:\nEcology.\nMenhaden are filter feeders that travel in large, slow-moving, and tightly packed schools with open mouths. Filter feeders typically take into their open mouths \"materials in the same proportions as they occur in ambient waters\". Menhaden have two main sources of food: phytoplankton and zooplankton. A menhaden's diet varies considerably over the course of its lifetime, and is directly related to its size. The smallest menhaden, typically those under one year old, eat primarily phytoplankton. After that age, adult menhaden gradually shift to a diet comprised almost exclusively of zooplankton.\nMenhaden are omnivorous filter feeders, feeding by straining plankton and algae from water. Along with oysters, which filter water on the seabed, menhaden play a key role in the food chain in estuaries and bays. Atlantic menhaden are an important link between plankton and upper level predators. Because of their filter feeding abilities, \"menhaden consume and redistribute a significant amount of energy within and between Chesapeake Bay and other estuaries, and the coastal ocean.\" Because they play this role, and their abundance, menhaden are an invaluable prey species for many predatory fish, such as striped bass, bluefish, mackerel, flounder, tuna, drums, and sharks. They are also a very important food source for many birds, including egrets, ospreys, seagulls, northern gannets, pelicans, and herons.\nIn 2012, the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission declared that the Atlantic menhaden was depleted due to overfishing. The decision was driven by issues with water quality in the Chesapeake Bay and failing efforts to re-introduce predator species, due to lack of menhaden on which they could feed.\nMenhaden are crucial not only because of their keystone species-status in the food web, but also because of their ecological services.\u00a0The way menhaden filter feed on phytoplankton helps to mitigate toxic algal blooms.\u00a0These algal blooms, which are often detrimental to a number of fish, bird, and marine mammal species, create hypoxic conditions. The phytoplankton being preyed upon are photosynthetic organisms, converting sunlight into energy which is then transferred to menhaden and then to bigger species of fish or other larger marine organisms such as birds or mammals.\u00a0The consequence of this behavior is that if menhaden are eliminated or significantly decreased, there are limited means of energy transfer among trophic levels \u2013 making menhaden a true keystone species with ecological services that are invaluable to humans.\nHabitat.\nMenhaden are a pelagic schooling fish that migrate inshore during the summer and off-shore in the winter months. The juvenile and larval menhaden migrate to shore and inland waterways through currents during summer months to grow while feeding on the phytoplankton and eventually zooplankton once they have matured. Commercially caught menhaden have been recorded in waters of around 5 to 24 \u2030, as well as in hypersaline waters around 60 \u2030.\nReproduction.\nMenhaden reproduce in open oceans externally, however, the female does not carry eggs with them during the process as they are released into the water column at the planktonic level as gametes and sperm. Currently, functional hermaphroditism is unknown to the species and identification of sex of the individual organism cannot be determined externally due to the lack of accessory reproductive organs. These fish breed during the winter months through December to March and the eggs and juveniles navigate towards estuaries and inland waterways through tides and currents.\nHuman use.\nMenhaden are not used directly for food. They are processed into fish oil and fish meal that are used as food ingredients, animal feed, and dietary supplements. The flesh has a high omega-3 fat content. Fish oil made from menhaden also is used as a raw material for products such as lipstick.\nFisheries.\nAccording to the Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS), there are two established commercial fisheries for menhaden. The first is known as a reduction fishery. The second is known as a bait fishery, which harvests menhaden for the use of both commercial and recreational fishermen. Commercial fishermen, especially crabbers in the Chesapeake Bay area, use menhaden to bait their traps or hooks. The recreational fisherman use ground menhaden chum as a fish attractant, and whole fish as bait. The total harvest is approximately 500 million fish per year. Atlantic menhaden are harvested using purse seines.\nOmega Protein \u2013 a reduction fishery company with operations in the northwest Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico \u2013 takes 90% of the total menhaden harvest in the United States. In October 2005, the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC) approved an addendum to Amendment 1 of the Interstate Fishery Management Plan for Atlantic Menhaden, which \"established a five-year annual cap on reduction fishery landings in the Chesapeake Bay\", imposing a limit on reduction fishery operations for 2006\u20132010. In November 2006, that cap was established at 109,020 metric tons; this cap remained in place until 2013.\nIn December 2012, in the face of the depletion of Atlantic menhaden, the ASMFC implemented another cap, effective in 2013 and 2014, for the Chesapeake Bay, this time at 87,216 metric tons, as well as a total allowable catch (TAC) of the species of 170,800 metric tons, a 20% reduction from the 2009\u20132011 average. The TAC was subsequently raised for 2015 and 2016 to 187,880 metric tons. The cap in the Chesapeake Bay was further lowered in November 2017 to 51,000 metric tons, but this came alongside a higher TAC of 216,000 metric tons. Omega Protein has been openly critical of these caps.\nUses for menhaden oil.\nMenhaden oil is high in omega-3 fatty acids. As a supplement to the human diet, omega-3 fatty acids can lower blood pressure, prevent abnormal heart rhythms, reduce the chance of a heart attack or stroke, and confer other health benefits.\nMenhaden oil is also used in animal feed. The omega-3 component of menhaden oil in chicken feed can prevent fatty liver disease. Guinea pigs given menhaden oil in feed were shown to have a longer life span.\nRisks of overfishing.\nAccording to the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, menhaden are the most important fish in the Bay. This is because they are a food source for many commercially important species like striped bass. They also manage the algal bloom occurrences in the Bay because they eat phytoplankton. Decreases in menhaden populations could also leave striped bass vulnerable to disease. In the past 20 years, the number of juvenile menhaden produced in the Chesapeake Bay have been decreasing (Refer to Atlantic Menhaden Graph on bay-wide mean catch per haul).\nThis is believed to be due to the overfishing of menhaden for their fish oil. This could seriously disrupt the food chain. In response, the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC) put a cap on the Atlantic menhaden harvest in October 2020. This 10% cut to the harvest is the first to ever be seen for menhaden coast-wide. It also was the first vote to consider benchmarks known as \"ecological reference points\". This allows managers to account for a species role in the food chain when setting catch limits. This is different from the \"single-species stock assessments\" that were previously used which only accounted for the demand from the fishing industry rather than the demand from the food web. This cut to the harvest established a quota of 194,400 metric tons of menhaden for the 2021\u20132022 fishing season. It is the hope that this cut will allow menhaden to fulfill their role in the ecosystem while keeping the commercial fishery alive.\nCultural significance.\nAfter menhaden had been identified as a valuable alternative to whale oil in the 1870s, the menhaden fishery on the Chesapeake was worked by crews of predominantly African-American men on open boats hauling purse seines. The men employed sea chanties to help synchronize the hauling of the nets. These chanties pulled from West African, blues, and gospel sources and created a uniquely African American culture of chanty singing. By the late 1950s, hydraulic winches replaced the large crews of manual haulers, and the menhaden chanty tradition declined.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Van Dyke\nSan Francisco is a 1936 American musical-drama disaster film directed by W. S. Van Dyke, based on the April 18, 1906 San Francisco earthquake. The film stars Clark Gable, Jeanette MacDonald and Spencer Tracy. MacDonald's singing helped make this film the highest grossing international hit of the year, coming on the heels of her other 1936 blockbuster, \"Rose Marie\".\nPlot.\nOn New Year's Eve, 1905, saloon keeper \"Blackie\" Norton hires Mary Blake to sing in his bar, the \"Paradise Club\" on Pacific Street in the notorious Barbary Coast of San Francisco. Mary becomes a star attraction at the \"Paradise\", especially for her signature tune, \"San Francisco\". Blackie's friend Mat predicts that Mary will not stay long on the \"Coast\".\nBlackie decides to run for the San Francisco Board of Supervisors at the behest of his childhood friend Father Tim Mullen, who believes Blackie can use the supervisor position to implement reform.\nMary is hired by the Tivoli Opera House on Market Street, where she becomes involved with Nob Hill scion Jack Burley. After her performance one night, Blackie visits Mary in her dressing room. Realizing she still loves him, Mary asks him to marry her. Blackie agrees, but their reunion is soon interrupted by Burley, who had proposed to Mary prior to the show. Burley appeals to Mary, but Blackie presents Mary with an ultimatum by asking if she wants to marry him or stay at the Tivoli. Mary chooses to return to the \"Paradise\".\nBackstage on the opening night of her return performance, Father Tim drops in and is angered by Mary's skimpy stage costume. He defies Blackie to put her on the stage in front of the rowdy \"Paradise\" audience. Mary decides to leave with the priest after Blackie strikes him in the face.\nMary goes back to Burley and meets his mother at her Nob Hill mansion. Mrs. Burley tells Mary that she had a \"Blackie\" in her younger days, but chose to marry the more steadfast Burley. This cements Mary's decision to accept Burley's proposal of marriage.\nOn the evening of April 17, 1906, Burley has the San Francisco Police Department raid the \"Paradise\". Blackie, distraught about the future of his club, ends up at the city's annual Chickens Ball. After performances by acts from the other clubs, the MC requests the \"Paradise's\" entry. When no one steps on stage, Mary, just having learned of the club's closing, enters the competition on behalf of the \"Paradise\". She rouses the audience to join in a chorus of \"San Francisco\" and wins, but Blackie refuses the prize money and states that Mary had no right to sing on behalf of his club. Mary is about to leave the ball with Burley when the earthquake hits the city.\nAs Blackie wanders the devastated city searching for Mary, he finds Burley dead and Mrs. Burley distraught. The police begin dynamiting buildings in order to control the fires. Blackie also comes upon a dying Mat, who tells Blackie he was wrong about Mary. Blackie later meets Father Tim, who takes him to a homeless camp in Golden Gate Park. Blackie hears Mary singing \"Nearer, My God, to Thee\" with those in mourning. As they reunite, word spreads through the camp that \"The fire's out!\" As people shout about building a new San Francisco, Blackie and Mary join the crowd as they leave the park marching arm-in-arm, singing \"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\".\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nProduction.\nThe earthquake montage sequence was created by Slavko Vorkapich, but the montage of effects was credited to Vokapich's collaborator and second unit director John Hoffman. The Barbary Coast barroom set was built on a special platform that rocked and shook to simulate the historic tremor (similar sets were built for the 1974 disaster film \"Earthquake\" for an office building, bar, and seismology institute).\nFamous silent film directors D. W. Griffith and Erich von Stroheim worked on the film without credit. It's been a matter of controversy which scene Griffith directed, but his contribution was mainly for publicity purposes. Von Stroheim contributed to the screenplay.\nThere are two versions of the ending. The original release features a stylish montage of then-current (1936) scenes of a bustling San Francisco, including Market Street and the construction of the Golden Gate Bridge. When the film was re-released in 1948, it was thought these scenes were dated and the film fades out on a single long shot of the modern business district. However, the TV and 16mm versions of the film seen in the 1950s and 60s were struck from the original version which includes the montage. The current DVD and cable version features the shorter, 1948 version.\nGable and Tracy also made two other films together, \"Test Pilot\" and \"Boom Town\", before Tracy eventually insisted on the same top billing clause in his MGM contract that Gable had enjoyed, effectively ending one of the American cinema's most famous screen teams.\nGable had played an extremely similar character also named \"Blackie\" two years earlier in the smash hit gangster epic \"Manhattan Melodrama\", with William Powell and Myrna Loy.\nMusic.\nThe title song may be the best-remembered part of the film. It was composed by Bronis\u0142aw Kaper and Walter Jurmann, with lyrics by Gus Kahn. It is sung by Jeanette MacDonald a half-dozen times in the film, and becomes an anthem for the survivors of the earthquake. It has now become a popular sentimental sing-along at public events such as the city's annual earthquake commemoration, as well as one of two official city songs; the other being \"I Left My Heart in San Francisco\". At San Francisco's historic Castro Theatre, the pre-film organ performance always ends with the song as the organ console is lowered down before the film starts.\nEarly in the film, the song \"The Darktown Strutters Ball\" can be heard; this is a historically inaccurate inclusion, since the song was written in 1917.\nDuring the two operatic scenes in the film, MacDonald sang excerpts from Charles Gounod's \"Faust\" and Giuseppe Verdi's \"La Traviata\". Another song she sings is \"The Holy City\".\nBox office.\nAccording to MGM records the film grossed a total \u2013 domestic and foreign \u2013 of $5,273,000: $2,868,000 in the US and Canada and $2,405,000 elsewhere. It made a profit of $2,237,000.\nReception.\nFrank Nugent, writing in \"The New York Times\", described \"San Francisco\" as \"prodigally generous and completely satisfying,\" its musical sequences \"woven gracefully into the script,\" and its earthquake \"a shattering spectacle, one of the truly great cinematic illusions; a monstrous, hideous, thrilling d\u00e9b\u00e2cle.\"\nAcademy Awards.\nThe film won one Academy Award and was nominated for five more.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The recipient of multiple accolades, he is known for directing historical films as well for his action hero roles, particularly his breakout role as Max Rockatansky in the first three films of the post-apocalyptic series \"Mad Max\" (1979\u20131985) and as Martin Riggs in the buddy cop series \"Lethal Weapon\" (1987\u20131998).\nBorn in Peekskill, New York, Gibson moved with his parents to Sydney, Australia, when he was 12 years old. He studied acting at the National Institute of Dramatic Art, where he starred opposite Judy Davis in a production of \"Romeo and Juliet\". During the 1980s, he founded Icon Entertainment, a production company. Director Peter Weir cast him as one of the leads in the World War I drama \"Gallipoli\" (1981), which earned Gibson a Best Actor Award from the Australian Film Institute.\nIn 1995, Gibson produced, directed, and starred in the war film \"Braveheart\" for which he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Director, the Academy Award for Best Director, and the Academy Award for Best Picture. He later directed and produced \"The Passion of the Christ\" (2004), a biblical drama that was both financially successful and highly controversial. He received further critical notice for directing the action-adventure film \"Apocalypto\" (2006), set in Mesoamerica during the early 16th century. His notable acting roles during this period were in \"Ransom\" (1996), \"Payback\" (1999), \"What Women Want\" (2000), \"The Patriot\" (2000), and \"Signs\" (2002). \nAfter several legal issues and controversial statements leaked to the public, Gibson's popularity in Hollywood declined, affecting his career. He subsequently starred in \"Edge of Darkness\" (2010) and Jodie Foster's \"The Beaver\" (2011). His directorial comeback after an absence of 10 years, \"Hacksaw Ridge\" (2016), won two Academy Awards.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEarly life and education.\nMel Colm-Cille Gerard Gibson was born in Peekskill, New York, on January 3, 1956 into a family of Irish American descent, as the sixth of 11 children, and the second son of Hutton Gibson, a writer, and Irish-born Anne Patricia (n\u00e9e Reilly, died 1990). Gibson's paternal grandmother was opera contralto Eva Mylott (1875\u20131920), who was born in Australia to Irish parents, while his paternal grandfather, John Hutton Gibson, was a millionaire tobacco businessman from the Southern United States. One of Gibson's younger brothers, Donal, is also an actor. Gibson's first name is derived from St Mel's Cathedral, situated in his mother's hometown of Longford. His second name, Colmcille, is also shared with an Irish saint. \nGibson's father was awarded US$145,000 in a work-related-injury lawsuit against the New York Central Railroad on February 14, 1968 (), and soon afterwards relocated his family to West Pymble, Sydney, Australia. Gibson was 12 years old at the time. The move to his grandmother's native Australia was both financial and a way to avoid the draft of his eldest brother during the Vietnam War.\nDuring his high school years, Gibson was educated by members of the Congregation of Christian Brothers at St Leo's Catholic College in Wahroonga, New South Wales.\nCareer.\nOverview.\nGibson gained favorable notices from film critics when he first entered the cinematic scene, as well as comparisons to several classic movie stars. In 1982, Vincent Canby wrote that \"Mr. Gibson recalls the young Steve McQueen... I can't define 'star quality,' but whatever it is, Mr. Gibson has it.\" Gibson has also been likened to \"a combination of Clark Gable and Humphrey Bogart.\" Gibson's roles in the \"Mad Max\" series of films, Peter Weir's \"Gallipoli\" (1981), and the \"Lethal Weapon\" series of films earned him the label of \"action hero\".\nLater, Gibson expanded into human dramas such as the Franco Zeffirelli film version of \"Hamlet\" (1990), and comedic roles such as those in \"Maverick\" (1994) and \"What Women Want\" (2000). He moved to directing and producing with \"The Man Without a Face\" (1993), \"Braveheart\" (1995), \"The Passion of the Christ\" (2004), and \"Apocalypto\" (2006). Jess Cagle of \"Time\" compared Gibson with Cary Grant, Sean Connery, and Robert Redford. Connery once suggested Gibson should play the next James Bond to Connery's \"M\". Gibson turned down the role, reportedly because he feared being typecast.\nActing.\nGibson studied at the National Institute of Dramatic Art in Sydney. As students, Gibson and actress Judy Davis played the leads in \"Romeo and Juliet\", and Gibson played the role of Queen Titania in an experimental production of \"A Midsummer Night's Dream.\" After graduation in 1977, Gibson immediately began work on the filming of \"Mad Max\", but continued to work as a stage actor, and joined the State Theatre Company of South Australia in Adelaide. Gibson's theatrical credits include the character Estragon (opposite Geoffrey Rush) in \"Waiting for Godot\", and the role of Biff Loman in a 1982 production of \"Death of a Salesman\" in Sydney. Gibson's most recent theatrical performance, opposite Sissy Spacek, was the 1993 production of \"Love Letters\" by A. R. Gurney, in Telluride, Colorado.\nWhile a student at NIDA, Gibson made his film debut in the 1977 film \"Summer City\", for which he was paid $400. Gibson then played the title character in the film \"Mad Max\" (1979). He was paid $9000 for this role. Shortly after making the film, he did a season with the South Australian Theatre Company. During this period, he shared a $30 a week apartment in Adelaide with his future wife Robyn Moore. After \"Mad Max\", Gibson played a mentally slow youth in the film \"Tim\" (also 1979). Gibson also appeared in Australian television series guest roles. He appeared in serial \"The Sullivans\" as naval lieutenant Ray Henderson, in police procedural \"Cop Shop\", and in the pilot episode of prison serial \"Punishment\" which was produced in 1980, screened 1981.\nGibson joined the cast of the World War II action film \"Attack Force Z\", which was not released until 1982 when Gibson had become a bigger star. Director Peter Weir cast Gibson as one of the leads in the World War I drama \"Gallipoli\" (1981), which earned Gibson another Best Actor Award from the Australian Film Institute. \"Gallipoli\" also helped to earn Gibson the reputation of a serious, versatile actor and gained him the Hollywood agent Ed Limato. The sequel \"Mad Max 2\" (1982) was his first hit in America, where it was released as \"The Road Warrior\". Gibson again received positive notices for his role in Peter Weir's romantic thriller \"The Year of Living Dangerously\" (1982). Following a one-year hiatus from film acting after the birth of his twin sons, Gibson took on the role of Fletcher Christian in \"The Bounty\" (1984). Gibson earned his first million dollar salary for playing Max Rockatansky for the third time, in \"Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome\" (1985).\nGibson's first American film was Mark Rydell's drama \"The River\" (1984), in which he and Sissy Spacek played struggling Tennessee farmers. Gibson then starred in the Gothic romance \"Mrs. Soffel\" (also 1984) for Australian director Gillian Armstrong. He and Matthew Modine played condemned convict brothers opposite Diane Keaton as the warden's wife who visits them to read the Bible. In 1985, after working on four films in a row, Gibson took almost two years off at his Australian cattle station. He returned to play the role of Martin Riggs in \"Lethal Weapon\" (1987), a film which helped to cement his status as a Hollywood \"leading man\". Gibson's next film was Robert Towne's \"Tequila Sunrise\" (1988), followed by \"Lethal Weapon 2\" (1989). Gibson next starred in three films back-to-back, all released in 1990: \"Bird on a Wire\", \"Air America\", and \"Hamlet\".\nDuring the 1990s, Gibson alternated between commercial and personal projects. His films in the first half of the decade were \"Forever Young\", \"Lethal Weapon 3\", \"Maverick\", and \"Braveheart\". He then starred in \"Ransom\", \"Conspiracy Theory\", \"Lethal Weapon 4\", and \"Payback\". Gibson also served as the speaking and singing voice of John Smith in Disney's \"Pocahontas\".\nGibson was paid a record salary of $25 million to appear in \"The Patriot\" (2000). It grossed over $100\u00a0million, as did two other films he featured in that year, \"Chicken Run\" and \"What Women Want\". In 2002, Gibson appeared in the Vietnam War drama \"We Were Soldiers\" and M. Night Shyamalan's \"Signs\", which became the highest-grossing film of Gibson's acting career.\nGibson's popularity declined after he had made some controversial statements.\nWhile promoting \"Signs\", Gibson said that he no longer wanted to be a movie star and would only act in film again if the script were truly extraordinary. In 2010, Gibson appeared in \"Edge of Darkness\", which marked his first starring role since 2002 and was an adaptation of the BBC miniseries, \"Edge of Darkness\". In June of the same year, Gibson was in Brownsville, Texas, filming scenes for the film \"Get the Gringo\", about a career criminal put in a tough prison in Mexico.\nIn 2010, following an outburst at his ex-girlfriend that was made public, Gibson was dropped from the talent agency of William Morris Endeavor. Gibson was lined up for a small role in \"The Hangover Part II\" but he was removed from the film after the cast and crew objected to his involvement.\nGibson also played two villains: Luther Voz in \"Machete Kills\" in 2013, opposite Danny Trejo, and Conrad Stonebanks in \"The Expendables 3\" opposite Sylvester Stallone in 2014.\nGibson appeared in the lead role of director S. Craig Zahler's police brutality-themed film \"Dragged Across Concrete\", released in 2018. He then starred in \"The Professor and the Madman\" \u2013 he and the director both disowned the film.\nProducing.\nAfter his success in Hollywood with the \"Lethal Weapon\" series, Gibson began to move into producing and directing. With partner Bruce Davey, Gibson formed Icon Productions in 1989 in order to make \"Hamlet\".\nIn late 1996, New Zealand producer Timothy White became founding head of a co-production venture between Fox and Gibson, called Fox-Icon, based at Fox Studios Australia in Sydney. The company failed to produce a single film, shutting down in December 1999. \nGibson has produced a number of projects for television, including a biopic on the Three Stooges and the 2008 PBS documentary \"Carrier\". Icon has grown from being just a production company to also be an international distribution company and film exhibitor in Australia and New Zealand. \nGibson is credited as an executive producer of the 2023 movie \"Sound of Freedom\", a film based on a true story which revolves around the topic of trafficking of children.\nDirecting.\nAccording to Robert Downey Jr., studio executives encouraged Gibson in 1989 to try directing, an idea he rebuffed at the time. Gibson made his directorial debut in 1993 with \"The Man Without a Face\", followed two years later by \"Braveheart\", which earned Gibson the Academy Award for Best Director. Gibson had long planned to direct a remake of \"Fahrenheit 451\", but in 1999 the project was indefinitely postponed because of scheduling conflicts. Gibson was scheduled to direct Robert Downey Jr. in a Los Angeles stage production of \"Hamlet\" in January 2001, but Downey's drug relapse ended the project. In 2002, while promoting \"We Were Soldiers\" and \"Signs\" to the press, Gibson mentioned that he was planning to pare back on acting and return to directing. In September 2002, Gibson announced that he would direct a film called \"The Passion\" in Aramaic and Latin with no subtitles because he hoped to \"transcend language barriers with filmic storytelling\".\nIn 2004, he released the controversial film \"The Passion of the Christ\", with subtitles, which he co-wrote, co-produced, and directed. The film went on to become the highest-grossing rated R film at the time with $370,782,930 in U.S. box office sales. Gibson directed a few episodes of \"Complete Savages\" for the ABC network. In 2006, he directed the action-adventure film \"Apocalypto\", his second film to feature sparse dialogue in a non-English language. The next two films he directed were \"Hacksaw Ridge\" (2016) and \"Flight Risk\" (2025).\nGibson has expressed an intention to direct a movie set during the Viking Age, starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Like \"The Passion of the Christ\" and \"Apocalypto\", he wants this speculative film to feature dialogue in period languages. However, DiCaprio ultimately opted out of the project. In a 2012 interview, Gibson announced that the project, which he has titled \"Berserker\", was still moving forward.\nIn 2011, it was announced that Gibson had commissioned a screenplay from Joe Eszterhas about the Maccabees. The film is to be distributed by Warner Brothers Pictures. The announcement generated significant controversy. In April 2012, Eszterhas wrote a letter to Gibson accusing him of sabotaging their film about the Maccabees because he \"hates Jews\", and cited a series of private incidents during which he allegedly heard Gibson express extremely racist views. Although written as a private letter, it was subsequently published on a film industry website. In response, Gibson stated that he still intends to make the film, but will not base it upon Eszterhas's script, which he called substandard. Eszterhas then claimed his son had secretly recorded a number of Gibson's alleged \"hateful rants\". In a 2012 interview, Gibson explained that the Maccabees film was still in preparation. He explained that he was drawn to the Biblical account of the uprising due to its similarity to the American Old West genre.\nIn June 2016, Gibson announced that he will reunite with \"Braveheart\" screenwriter Randall Wallace to make a sequel for \"The Passion of the Christ\", focusing on the resurrection of Jesus. In early November 2016, Gibson revealed on \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" that the sequel's title will be \"\". He also stated that the project could \"probably be three years off\" because \"it's a big subject\". In January 2023, it was reported that the sequel will begin filming later that year. In November 2016, the film critic Matt Zoller Seitz named Gibson \"the pre-eminent religious filmmaker in the United States\".\nIn May 2018, it was announced that Gibson would be directing a WWII film titled \"Destroyer\". \"Destroyer\", similar to \"Hacksaw Ridge\", will also deal with the Battle of Okinawa in the Pacific Theater, although from a different front. It will be based on the heroic story of the crew belonging to USS \"Laffey\" (DD-724), who defended their ship from 22 kamikaze attacks.\nIn September 2018, it was announced that Gibson would direct and co-write a remake of the 1969 film, \"The Wild Bunch\". In May 2019, \"Deadline\" reported that Gibson was courting Michael Fassbender, Jamie Foxx, and Peter Dinklage to star in the project; that Jerry Bruckheimer will produce the film, and Warner Bros. will finance and release the project. In 2021, after the death of the \"Lethal Weapon\" director, Richard Donner, Gibson said he would direct and star in \"Lethal Weapon 5\".\nDirecting style.\nGibson has credited his directors, particularly George Miller, Peter Weir, and Richard Donner, with teaching him the craft of filmmaking and influencing him as a director. As a director, Gibson sometimes breaks the tension on set by having his actors perform serious scenes wearing a red clown nose. Helena Bonham Carter said, \"He has a very basic sense of humor. It's a bit lavatorial and not very sophisticated.\" Gibson inserted a single frame of himself smoking a cigarette into the 2005 teaser trailer of \"Apocalypto\".\nFilm work.\nGibson's screen acting career began in 1976, with a role on the Australian television series \"The Sullivans\". In his career, Gibson has appeared in 63 films, including the \"Mad Max\" and \"Lethal Weapon\" film series. In addition to acting, Gibson has also directed six films, including \"Braveheart\" and \"The Passion of the Christ\"; produced 11 films; and written three films. Films either starring or directed by Mel Gibson have earned over US$2.5\u00a0billion, in the United States alone. Gibson's filmography includes television series, feature films, television films, and animated films.\n\"Mad Max\" series.\nGibson got his breakthrough role as the leather-clad post-apocalyptic survivor in George Miller's \"Mad Max\". The independently financed blockbuster helped to make him an international star. In the United States, the actors' Australian accents were dubbed with American accents. The original film spawned two sequels: \"Mad Max 2\" (known in North America as \"The Road Warrior\") and \"Mad Max 3\" (known in North America as \"Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome\"). A fourth movie, \"\" (2015), was made with Tom Hardy in the title role.\n\"Gallipoli\".\nThe 1981 Peter Weir film \"Gallipoli\" is about a group of young men from rural Western Australia who enlist in the Australian Imperial Force during World War I. They are sent to invade the Ottoman Empire, where they take part in the 1915 Gallipoli campaign. During the course of the movie, the young men slowly lose their innocence about the war. The climax of the movie centers on the catastrophic Australian offensive known as the Battle of the Nek.\nPeter Weir cast Gibson in the role of Frank Dunne, an Irish-Australian drifter with an intense cynicism about fighting for the British Empire. Newcomer Mark Lee was recruited to play the idealistic Archy Hamilton after participating in a photo session for the director. Gibson later recalled:\nI'd auditioned for an earlier film and he told me right up front, \"I'm not going to cast you for this part. You're not old enough. But thanks for coming in, I just wanted to meet you.\" He told me he wanted me for \"Gallipoli\" a couple of years later because I wasn't the archetypal Australian. He had Mark Lee, the angelic-looking, ideal Australian kid, and he wanted something of a modern sensibility. He thought the audience needed someone to relate to of their own time.\nGibson later said that \"Gallipoli\" is, \"Not really a war movie. That's just the backdrop. It's really the story of two young men.\"\nThe critically acclaimed film helped to further launch Gibson's career. He won the award for Best Actor in a Leading Role from the Australian Film Institute.\n\"The Year of Living Dangerously\".\nGibson played a na\u00efve but ambitious journalist opposite Sigourney Weaver and Linda Hunt in Peter Weir's atmospheric 1982 film \"The Year of Living Dangerously\", based on the novel of the same name by Christopher Koch. The movie was both a critical and commercial success, and the upcoming Australian actor was heavily marketed by MGM studio. In his review of the film, Vincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" wrote, \"If this film doesn't make an international star of Mr. Gibson, then nothing will. He possesses both the necessary talent and the screen presence.\" According to John Hiscock of \"The Daily Telegraph\", the film did, indeed, establish Gibson as an international talent.\nGibson was initially reluctant to accept the role of Guy Hamilton. \"I didn't necessarily see my role as a great challenge. My character was, like the film suggests, a puppet. And I went with that. It wasn't some star thing, even though they advertised it that way.\" Gibson saw some similarities between himself and the character of Guy. \"He's not a silver-tongued devil. He's kind of immature and he has some rough edges and I guess you could say the same for me.\"\n\"The Bounty\".\nGibson followed the footsteps of Errol Flynn, Clark Gable, and Marlon Brando by starring as Fletcher Christian in a cinematic retelling of the Mutiny on the \"Bounty\". The resulting 1984 film \"The Bounty\" is considered to be the most historically accurate version. However, Gibson has expressed a belief that the film's revisionism did not go far enough. He has stated that his character should have been portrayed as the film's antagonist. He has further praised Anthony Hopkins's performance as Lieutenant William Bligh as the best aspect of the film.\n\"Lethal Weapon\" series.\nGibson moved into more mainstream commercial filmmaking with the popular action comedy film series \"Lethal Weapon\", which began with the 1987 original. In the films he played LAPD Detective Martin Riggs, a recently widowed Vietnam veteran with a death wish and a penchant for violence and gunplay. In the films, he is partnered with a reserved family man named Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) and starting with the second film, they're joined by a hyperactive informant named Leo Getz (Joe Pesci). Following the success of \"Lethal Weapon\", director Richard Donner and principal cast revisited the characters in three sequels, \"Lethal Weapon 2\" (1989), \"Lethal Weapon 3\" (1993), and \"Lethal Weapon 4\" (1998). With its fourth installment, the \"Lethal Weapon\" series embodied \"the quintessence of the buddy cop pic\".\nThe film series has since been rebooted with a television adaptation, which aired for three seasons on FOX.\nOn November 15, 2021, Gibson confirmed that he will direct the fifth \"Lethal Weapon\" film following the death of director Richard Donner. \"The man who directed all the 'Lethal films', Richard Donner, he was a big guy. He was developing the screenplay and he got pretty far along with it. And he said to me one day, 'Listen kid, if I kick the bucket you will do it.' And I said: 'Shut up.' But he did indeed pass away. But he did ask me to do it and at the time I didn't say anything. He said it to his wife and to the studio and the producer. So I will be directing the fifth one\" Gibson said. In June 2024, Gibson confirmed in an interview with the \"Inspire Me\" podcast that he would direct the fifth installment of the Lethal Weapon franchise and that the film would stay true to Donner's vision and influence. Gibson also stated that he and Glover would return to play their respective roles of Riggs and Murtaugh.\n\"Hamlet\".\nGibson made the unusual transition from action to classical drama, playing William Shakespeare's Danish prince in Franco Zeffirelli's \"Hamlet\". Gibson was cast alongside experienced Shakespearean actors Ian Holm, Alan Bates, and Paul Scofield. He compared working with Scofield to being \"thrown into the ring with Mike Tyson\". Scofield said of Gibson \"Not the sort of actor you'd think would make an ideal Hamlet, but he had enormous integrity and intelligence.\"\n\"Braveheart\".\nIn 1995, Gibson directed, produced, and starred in \"Braveheart\", a biographical film of Sir William Wallace, a Scottish patriot and resistance fighter who was executed in 1305 for \"high treason\" against King Edward I of England. Gibson received two Academy Awards, Best Director and Best Picture, for his second directorial effort. In winning the Academy Award for Best Director, Gibson became only the sixth actor-turned-filmmaker to do so. \"Braveheart\" helped to revive the film genre of the historical epic; the Battle of Stirling Bridge sequence is considered by critics to be one of the all-time best-directed battle scenes.\nThe film's depiction of the Prince of Wales as an effeminate homosexual caused the film to be attacked by Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD), which was especially enraged by a scene in which King Edward I murders his son's male lover by throwing him out of a castle window.\nGibson, who had previously been reported making several homophobic statements, now replied, \"The fact that King Edward throws this character out a window has nothing to do with him being gay ... He's terrible to his son, to everybody.\"\nGibson asserted that the reason that King Edward I kills his son's lover is because the king is a \"psychopath\". Gibson also expressed bewilderment that some filmgoers laughed at this murder:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We cut a scene out, unfortunately ... where you really got to know that character (Edward II) and to understand his plight and his pain... But it just stopped the film in the first act so much that you thought, \"When's this story going to start?\"\n\"The Passion of the Christ\".\nGibson directed, produced, co-wrote, and funded the film \"The Passion of the Christ\" (2004), which chronicled the passion and death of Jesus (Jim Caviezel). The film was shot exclusively in Aramaic, Latin, and Hebrew. Gibson originally intended to release the film without subtitles, but eventually relented for theatrical exhibition. The film sparked divergent reviews, ranging from high praise to criticism of the violence. The Anti-Defamation League accused Gibson of antisemitism over the film's unflattering depiction of Caiaphas and the Sanhedrin.\nIn \"The Nation\", reviewer Katha Pollitt wrote: \"Gibson has violated just about every precept of the conference's own 1988 'Criteria' for the portrayal of Jews in dramatizations of the Passion (no bloodthirsty Jews, no rabble, no use of Scripture that reinforces negative stereotypes of Jews, etc.) ... The priests have big noses and gnarly faces, lumpish bodies, yellow teeth; Herod Antipas and his court are a bizarre collection of oily-haired, epicene perverts. The 'good Jews' look like Italian movie stars (Magdalene actually is an Italian movie star, the lovely Monica Bellucci); Mary, who would have been around 50 and appeared 70, could pass for a ripe 35.\"\nAmong those to defend Gibson were Orthodox Jewish rabbi Daniel Lapin and radio personality Michael Medved. Referring to ADL National Director Abraham Foxman, Rabbi Lapin said that by calling \"The Passion of the Christ\" antisemitic, \"what he is saying is that the only way (for Christians) to escape the wrath of Foxman is to repudiate (their own) faith.\"\nIn an interview with \"The Globe and Mail\", Gibson stated: \"If anyone has distorted Gospel passages to rationalize cruelty towards Jews or anyone, it's in defiance of repeated Papal condemnation. The Papacy has condemned racism in any form... Jesus died for the sins of all times, and I'll be the first on the line for culpability\".\nEventually, the continued media attacks began to anger Gibson. After Hutton Gibson's Holocaust denial was used to attack his son's film in print by \"The New York Times\" writer Frank Rich, an enraged Mel Gibson retorted, \"I want to kill him. I want his intestines on a stick... I want to kill his dog.\"\nGibson's Traditionalist Catholic upbringing was also the target of criticism. In a 2006 interview with Diane Sawyer, Gibson stated that he feels that his \"human rights were violated\" by the often vitriolic attacks on his person, his family, and his religious beliefs which were sparked by \"The Passion\".\nThe film grossed US$611,899,420 worldwide and $370,782,930 in the U.S. alone, surpassing any motion picture starring Gibson. In U.S. box offices, it became the seventh-highest-grossing (at the time) film in history and the highest-grossing R-rated film of all time. The film was nominated for three Academy Awards and won the People's Choice Award for Favorite Dramatic Motion Picture.\n\"Apocalypto\".\nGibson received further critical acclaim for his directing of the 2006 action-adventure film \"Apocalypto\". Gibson's fourth directorial effort is set in Mesoamerica during the early 16th century against the turbulent end times of a Maya civilization. The sparse dialogue is spoken in the Yucatec Maya language by a cast of Native American descent.\nGibson himself has stated that the film is an attempt at making a deliberate point about great civilizations and what causes them to decline and disintegrate. Gibson said, \"People think that modern man is so enlightened, but we're susceptible to the same forces\u2014and we are also capable of the same heroism and transcendence.\" This theme is further explored by a quote from Will Durant, which is superimposed at the very beginning of the film: \"A great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within.\"\n\"The Beaver\".\nGibson starred in \"The Beaver\", a domestic drama about a depressed alcoholic directed by former \"Maverick\" costar Jodie Foster. \"The Beaver\" premiered at the South by Southwest Festival in Austin, Texas on March 16, 2011. The opening weekend in 22 theaters was considered a flop; it made $104,000 which comes to a per-theater average of $4,745. The film's distributor, Summit Entertainment, had originally planned for a wide release of \"The Beaver\" for the weekend of May 20, but after the initial box-office returns for the film, the company changed course and decided instead to give the film a \"limited art-house run\". Michael Cieply of \"The New York Times\" observed on June 5, 2011, that the film had cleared just about $1\u00a0million, making it a certified \"flop\". Director Jodie Foster opined that the film did not do well with American audiences because it was a dramedy, and \"very often Americans are not comfortable with [that]\".\nBefore its release, much of the coverage focused on the unavoidable association between the protagonist's issues and Mel Gibson's own well-publicized personal and legal problems (see ), including a conviction of battery of his ex-girlfriend. Wrote \"Time\" magazine, \"\"The Beaver\" is a somber, sad domestic drama featuring an alcoholic in acute crisis ... It's hard to separate Gibson's true-life story from what's happening onscreen.\"\n\"Hacksaw Ridge\".\nIn 2014, Gibson signed on to direct \"Hacksaw Ridge\", a World War II drama based on the true story of conscientious objector Desmond T. Doss, played by Andrew Garfield.\nThe film premiered at the 73rd Venice Film Festival in September 2016 and received what \"The New Zealand Herald\" called \"rave reviews\". It won or was nominated for many awards, including Golden Globe nominations for Best Picture, Best Director for Gibson, and Best Actor for Garfield. \"Hacksaw Ridge\" was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Film Editing.\nThe film grossed $164 million worldwide, four times its production costs.\n\"Flight Risk\".\nIn May 2023, it was announced that Gibson would direct a film titled \"Flight Risk\", starring Mark Wahlberg. Set to be released by Lionsgate, the film will star Wahlberg as \"a pilot transporting a dangerous criminal for trial.\" It was later reported that the film had begun shooting in Las Vegas on June 16. Filming was reportedly unaffected by the SAG-AFTRA strike, having been exempted as an independent project. \"Flight Risk\" was released in the United States on January 24, 2025.\nPersonal life.\nBecause of his mother, Gibson retains dual Irish and American citizenship. He is also an Australian permanent resident.\nRelationships.\nRobyn Denise Moore.\nGibson met Robyn Denise Moore in 1977, soon after filming \"Mad Max\", in Adelaide, South Australia. At the time, Robyn was a dental nurse and Mel was an unknown actor working for the South Australian Theatre Company. On June 7, 1980, Mel and Robyn were married in a Catholic church in Forestville, New South Wales. They have one daughter, Hannah (b. 1980, married Kenny Wayne Shepherd in 2006), and six sons: twins Edward and Christian (b. 1982), William (b. 1985), Louis (b. 1988), Milo (b. 1990), and Thomas (b. 1999); and seven grandchildren as of 2024[ [update]].\nAfter 26 years of marriage, Gibson and Robyn separated on July 29, 2006. In a 2011 interview, Gibson stated that the separation began the day following his arrest for drunk driving in Malibu. Robyn Gibson filed for divorce on April 13, 2009, citing irreconcilable differences. In a joint statement, the Gibsons declared, \"Throughout our marriage and separation we have always striven to maintain the privacy and integrity of our family and will continue to do so.\" The divorce filing followed the March 2009 release of photographs appearing to show him on a beach embracing his live-in girlfriend of one year, Russian songwriter and pianist Oksana Grigorieva.\nThe Gibsons' divorce was finalized on December 23, 2011, and the settlement with his ex-wife was said to be the highest in Hollywood history at over $400\u00a0million. The couple reportedly did not have a prenuptial agreement; because California is a community property state, Robyn Gibson received half of everything her husband had earned during their marriage.\nOksana Grigorieva.\nIn a 2010 interview, Grigorieva stated that, when she first began being wooed by Gibson, she was surprised and only accepted his advances after learning that the actor-director and his wife had been separated for more than 18 months. Grigorieva added, \"He wrote me a lot of poetry. It was very beautiful, impressionistic, like an edgy, modern iambic pentameter. Mel has a really good grasp of language, he's fantastic with words.\"\nOn April 28, 2009, Gibson made a red carpet-appearance with Grigorieva. She had previously had a son with actor Timothy Dalton and gave birth to Gibson's daughter Lucia on October 30, 2009. By April 2010, Gibson and Grigorieva had split. On June 21, 2010, Grigorieva filed a restraining order against Gibson to keep him away from her and their child. The restraining order was modified the next day regarding Gibson's contact with their child. Gibson obtained a restraining order against Grigorieva on June 25, 2010.\nGrigorieva accused Gibson of domestic violence, leading to an investigation by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department in July 2010. On July 9, 2010, some audio recordings of a rant, allegedly directed by Gibson toward Grigorieva, were posted on the internet. The same day Gibson was dropped by his agency, William Morris Endeavor. Gibson's estranged wife Robyn filed a court statement declaring that she never experienced any abuse from Gibson; while forensic experts have questioned the validity of some of the tapes, Gibson himself did not deny they were accurate at the time. In March 2011, Mel Gibson agreed to plead no contest to a misdemeanor battery charge. In April 2011, Gibson finally broke his silence about the incident in question. In an interview with \"Deadline Hollywood\", Gibson expressed gratitude to longtime friends Whoopi Goldberg and Jodie Foster, both of whom had spoken publicly in his defense. About the recordings, Gibson said,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I've never treated anyone badly or in a discriminatory way based on their gender, race, religion or sexuality\u2014period. I don't blame some people for thinking that though, from the garbage they heard on those leaked tapes, which have been edited. You have to put it all in the proper context of being in an irrationally, heated discussion at the height of a breakdown, trying to get out of a really unhealthy relationship. It's one terribly awful moment in time, said to one person, in the span of one day and doesn't represent what I truly believe or how I've treated people my entire life.\nIn the same interview, Gibson stated\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I was allowed to end the case and still maintain my innocence. It's called a West Plea and it's not something that prosecutors normally allow. But in my case, the prosecutors and the judge agreed that it was the right thing to do. I could have continued to fight this for years and it probably would have come out fine. But I ended it for my children and my family. This was going to be such a circus. You don't drag other people in your life through this sewer needlessly, so I'll take the hit and move on.\nIn August 2011, Gibson settled with Grigorieva, who was awarded $750,000, joint legal custody, and a house in Sherman Oaks, California until their daughter Lucia turns 18. In 2013, Grigorieva sued her attorneys, accusing them of advising her to sign a bad agreement, including a term that taking legal action against Gibson would compromise her financial settlement.\nRosalind Ross.\nAs of 2014, Gibson is in a relationship with former champion equestrian vaulter and writer Rosalind Ross. Ross gave birth to their son, and Gibson's ninth child, Lars Gerard, on January 20, 2017, in Los Angeles.\nInvestments.\nGibson is a property investor, with multiple properties in Malibu, California, several locations in Costa Rica, a private island in Fiji, and properties in Australia. In December 2004, Gibson sold his Australian farm in the Kiewa Valley for $6\u00a0million. Also in December 2004, Gibson purchased Mago Island in Fiji from Tokyu Corporation of Japan for $15\u00a0million. Descendants of the original native inhabitants of Mago, who were displaced in the 1860s, have protested the purchase. Gibson stated it was his intention to retain the pristine environment of the undeveloped island.\nIn early 2005, he sold his Montana ranch to a neighbor. In April 2007, he purchased a ranch in Costa Rica for $26\u00a0million, and, in July 2007, he sold his Tudor estate in Connecticut (which he purchased in 1994 for $9\u00a0million) for $40\u00a0million to an unnamed buyer. Also that month, he sold a Malibu property for $30\u00a0million that he had purchased for $24\u00a0million two years before.\nIn 2008, he purchased the Malibu home of actors David Duchovny and T\u00e9a Leoni.\nIn 2009 he bought a house in Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, built in 2006 to designs inspired by architect Frank Lloyd Wright. He paid $2.4 million for the property, which he bought under a trust, with Vicki Lynn Christianson, COO of his production company Icon Productions, as trustee. He sold the property at a loss in February, for $2.1 million.\nJersey Leaks.\nRecords of Gibson using offshore accounts and business were revealed in the Jersey Leaks, records of more than 20,000 individuals held with the wealth management firm Kleinwort Benson.\nPhilanthropy.\nGibson and his former wife have contributed a substantial amount of money to various charities, one of which is Healing the Children. According to Cris Embleton, one of the founders, the Gibsons gave millions to provide lifesaving medical treatment to needy children worldwide. They also supported the restoration of Renaissance artwork and gave millions of dollars to NIDA.\nGibson donated $500,000 to the El Mirador Basin Project to protect the last tract of virgin rain forest in Central America and to fund archeological excavations in the \"cradle of Mayan civilization\". In July 2007, Gibson again visited Central America to make arrangements for donations to the indigenous population. Gibson met with Costa Rican President \u00d3scar Arias to discuss how to \"channel the funds\". During the same month, Gibson pledged to give financial assistance to a Malaysian company named Green Rubber Global for a tire recycling factory located in Gallup, New Mexico. While on a business trip to Singapore in September 2007, Gibson donated to a local charity for children with chronic and terminal illnesses. Gibson is also a supporter of Angels at Risk, a nonprofit organization focusing on education about drug and alcohol abuse among teens.\nIn a 2011 interview, Gibson said of his philanthropic works, \"It gives you perspective. It's one of my faults, you tend to focus on yourself a lot. Which is not always the healthiest thing for your psyche or anything else. If you take a little time out to think about other people, it's good. It's uplifting.\"\nReligion and politics.\nFaith.\nGibson was raised a sedevacantist traditionalist Catholic (who reject the validity of all Popes since the Second Vatican Council and hold that the Holy See is currently vacant). His father Hutton Gibson was an ardent sedevacantist and a Holocaust denier who held strong antisemitic views and supported various conspiracy theories.\nDuring the filming of \"The Passion of The Christ\", he had daily visits from both local priests and priests from the traditionalist Institute of Christ the King (a non-sedevacantist group in full communion with the Pope) in France.\nWhen asked about the Catholic doctrine of \"Extra Ecclesiam nulla salus\", Gibson replied, \"There is no salvation for those outside the Church ... I believe it. Put it this way. My wife is a saint. She's a much better person than I am. Honestly. She's ... Episcopalian, Church of England. She prays, she believes in God, she knows Jesus, she believes in that stuff. And it's just not fair if she doesn't make it, she's better than I am. But that is a pronouncement from the chair. I go with it.\" When he was asked whether John 14:6 is an intolerant position, he said that \"through the merits of Jesus' sacrifice ... even people who don't know Jesus are able to be saved, but \"through\" him.\" Gibson has told Diane Sawyer that he believes non-Catholics and non-Christians can go to Heaven.\nGibson's acquaintance Fr. William Fulco said in 2009 that Gibson denies neither the pope nor Vatican II; even so, as of 2021, Gibson attended the Church of the Holy Family, a traditionalist church he founded and funds in Southern California. \nIn a 1990 interview with Barbara Walters, Gibson said: \"God is the only one who knows how many children we should have, and we should be ready to accept them. One can't decide for oneself who comes into this world and who doesn't. That decision doesn't belong to us.\"\nGibson, in a letter published by Italian Traditionalist Catholic author Aldo Maria Valli, on his website, on 6 July 2024, stated his full support for the recently excommunicated Italian archbishop Carlo Maria Vigan\u00f2, who he praised as \"a modern day Athanasius!\", stating that he agreed with him in considering that the \"post conciliar church of Vatican II is a counterfeit church\", and that \"being called a schismatic &amp; being excommunicated by Jorge Bergoglio is like a badge of honor when you consider he is a total apostate &amp; expels you from a false institution.\" He also stated that \"I am with you &amp; I hope Bergoglio excommunicates me from his false church also.\"\nPolitics.\nIn a July 1995 interview with \"Playboy\", Gibson said President Bill Clinton was a \"low-level opportunist\" and someone was \"telling him what to do\". He said that the Rhodes Scholarship was established for young men and women who want to strive for a \"new world order\" and this was a campaign for Marxism. Gibson later backed away from such conspiracy theories saying, \"It was like: 'Hey, tell us a conspiracy'...\u00a0so I laid out this thing, and suddenly, it was like I was talking the gospel truth, espousing all this political shit like I believed in it.\" In the same 1995 \"Playboy\" interview, Gibson argued against ordaining women to the priesthood.\nIn 2004, he publicly spoke out against taxpayer-funded embryonic stem-cell research that involves the cloning and destruction of human embryos. In March 2005, he condemned the outcome of the Terri Schiavo case, referring to Schiavo's death as \"state-sanctioned murder\".\nGibson questioned the Iraq War in March 2004. In 2006, Gibson said that the \"fearmongering\" depicted in his film \"Apocalypto\" \"reminds me a little of President Bush and his guys.\" He later said in 2016 that he is anti-war but has an appreciation for the sacrifices made by \"warriors\".\nGibson complimented filmmaker Michael Moore and his documentary \"Fahrenheit 9/11\" when he and Moore were recognized at the 2005 People's Choice Awards. Gibson's Icon Productions originally agreed to finance Moore's film but later sold the rights to Miramax Films. Moore said that his agent Ari Emanuel claimed that \"top Republicans\" called Gibson to tell him, \"don't expect to get more invitations to the White House\". Icon's spokesman dismissed this story, saying \"We never run from a controversy. You'd have to be out of your mind to think that of the company that just put out \"The Passion of the Christ\".\"\nIn a 2011 interview, Gibson stated:\nThe whole notion of politics is they always present you with this or this or this. I'll get a newspaper to read between the lines. Why do you have to adhere to prescribed formulas that they have and people argue over them and they're all in a box. And you watch Fox claw CNN, and CNN claw Fox. Sometimes I catch a piece of the news and it seems insanity to me. I quietly support candidates. I'm not out there banging a drum for candidates. But I have supported a candidate and it's a whole other world. Once you've been exposed to it, once or twice or however many times, if you know the facts and see how they're presented, it's mind-boggling. It's a very scary arena to be in, but I do vote. I go in there and pull the lever. It's kind of like pulling the lever and watching the trap door fall out from beneath you. Why should we trust any of these people? None of them ever deliver on anything. It's always disappointing.\nGibson revealed in a 2016 interview with Jorge Ramos that he voted for neither Donald Trump nor Hillary Clinton in the 2016 United States presidential election. In July 2021, Gibson was recorded saluting Trump while attending UFC 264, which went viral over the Internet.\nIn October 2020, Gibson released a statement regarding the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War and expressing solidarity with the Armenian people.\nGibson endorsed Trump in the 2024 United States presidential election, adding that Kamala Harris had \"the IQ of a fence post\".\nOn January 16, 2025, it was announced by president-elect Donald Trump that Gibson would serve in a new role as one of three \"special ambassadors\" to Hollywood, sharing the role with fellow actors Jon Voight and Sylvester Stallone. Trump stated that he wants these actors to make Hollywood \"stronger than ever before\" by bringing back business lost to \"foreign countries\". Trump said that the three would be his \"eyes and ears\" and he would act on their suggestions, but their duties were not specified.\nAlcohol abuse and legal issues.\nGibson has said that he started drinking at the age of 13. In a 2002 interview for the documentary \"actingclassof1977.com\", made by his former National Institute of Dramatic Art colleague Sally McKenzie, Gibson said, \"I had really good highs but some very low lows.\"\nGibson was banned from driving in Ontario, Canada, for three months in 1984, after rear-ending a car in Toronto while under the influence of alcohol. He retreated to his Australian farm for over a year to recover, but he continued to struggle with drinking. Despite this problem, Gibson gained a reputation in Hollywood for professionalism and punctuality such that frequent collaborator Richard Donner was shocked when Gibson confided that he was drinking five pints of beer for breakfast. Reflecting in 2003 and 2004, Gibson said that despair in his mid-30s led him to contemplate suicide, and he meditated on Christ's Passion to heal his wounds. He took more time off acting in 1991 and sought professional help. That year, Gibson's attorneys were unsuccessful at blocking the \"Sunday Mirror\" from publishing what Gibson shared at AA meetings. In 1992, Gibson provided financial support to Hollywood's Recovery Center, saying, \"Alcoholism is something that runs in my family. It's something that's close to me. People do come back from it, and it's a miracle.\"\nOn August 17, 2006, Gibson pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor drunken-driving charge and was sentenced to three years' probation. He was ordered to attend self-help meetings five times a week for four-and-a-half months and three times a week for the remainder of the first year of his probation. He was also ordered to attend a First Offenders Program and fined $1,300, and his license was restricted for 90 days.\nIn February 2008, it was reported that screenwriter Benedict Fitzgerald was suing Gibson, along with Vicki Christianson, Icon Productions, Icon Distribution, Marquis Films, and Airborne Productions, for defrauding him of millions of dollars, as well as incorrectly taking co-writing credit for the screenplay of \"Passion of the Christ\". In May 2009, Gibson agreed to an undisclosed settlement with Fitzgerald. Details of the settlement, agreed at Los Angeles County Superior Court, were not released. Gibson's representatives did not comment on the settlement.\nPalisades Fire.\nIn January 2025, during the Southern California wildfires, Gibson's home in Malibu burned down in the Palisades Fire. He criticized California governor Gavin Newsom's response to the Los Angeles wildfires.\nControversies.\nGLAAD accused Gibson of homophobia after a December 1991 interview in the Spanish newspaper \"El Pa\u00eds\" in which he made derogatory comments about gay people. Gibson later defended his comments, and rejected calls to apologize even as he faced fresh accusations of homophobia in the wake of his film \"Braveheart\". Gibson joined GLAAD in hosting 10 lesbian and gay filmmakers for an on-location seminar on the set of the movie \"Conspiracy Theory\" in January 1997. In 1999, when asked about the comments to \"El Pa\u00eds\", Gibson said, \"I shouldn't have said it, but I was tickling a bit of vodka during that interview, and the quote came back to bite me on the ass.\"\nOn July 28, 2006, Gibson was arrested by Sheriff's Deputy James Mee of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department for driving under the influence (DUI) while speeding in his vehicle with an open container of alcohol. According to a 2011 article in \"Vanity Fair\", Gibson first told the arresting officer, \"My life is over. I'm fucked. Robyn's going to leave me.\" According to the arrest report, Gibson exploded into an angry tirade when the arresting officer would not allow him to drive home. In what \"Vanity Fair\" was later told was an attempt at suicide by cop, Gibson said to the arresting officer, \"Fucking Jews... the Jews are responsible for all the wars in the world. Are you a Jew?\"\nAfter the arrest report was leaked on TMZ.com, Gibson issued two apologies through his publicist, and\u2014in a televised interview with Diane Sawyer\u2014he affirmed the accuracy of the quotations. He further apologized for his \"despicable\" behavior, saying that the comments were \"blurted out in a moment of insanity\", and asked to meet with Jewish leaders to help him \"discern the appropriate path for healing.\" After Gibson's arrest, his publicist said he had entered a recovery program to battle alcoholism.\nWinona Ryder has repeatedly told a story to various press outlets about speaking to Mel Gibson with her friend at a party. Gibson allegedly responded to her friend, who was gay, by asking if he was going to get AIDS from speaking with him, and later asked Ryder, who is Jewish, if she was an \"oven dodger.\" A representative of Gibson later denied the accusations.\nIn July 2010, Gibson had been recorded during a phone call with Grigorieva where he suggested that if she got \"raped by a pack of niggers\", she would be to blame, and threatening to burn down Grigorieva's house while she was inside it. Grigorieva said the voices on the multiple recordings leaked were of herself and Gibson, according to CNN. He was barred from coming near Grigorieva or their daughter due to a domestic violence-related restraining order. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department launched a domestic violence investigation against Gibson, later dropped when Gibson pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor battery charge.\nGibson's controversial statements resulted in his being blacklisted in Hollywood for almost a decade. Both Robert Downey Jr. and journalist Allison Hope Weiner advocated for forgiveness for Gibson in 2014. In 2016, Gibson's film \"Hacksaw Ridge\", which received six Academy Award nominations, resulted in what was perceived as a \"thaw\" in his reputation.\nAwards and honors.\nMajor film awards.\nGibson has won numerous major awards for his film achievements, including multiple awards for the following:\nOther awards, honors, and appointments.\nIn 1985, Gibson was named the \"Sexiest Man Alive\" by \"People\", the first person to be named so.\nGibson quietly declined the Chevalier des Arts et Lettres from the French government in 1995 as a protest against France's resumption of nuclear testing in the Southwest Pacific. \nOn July 25, 1997, Gibson was named an honorary Officer of the Order of Australia (AO), in recognition of his \"service to the Australian film industry\". The award was honorary because substantive awards are made only to Australian citizens.\nIn 2003, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Loyola Marymount University.\nIn 2004, he was named \"world's most powerful celebrity\" by \"Forbes\". In the same year, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" named him Innovator of the Year.\nIn 2007, Gibson was awarded an honorary fellowship in performing arts by Limkokwing University of Creative Technology.\nIn 2008, he won the Outstanding Contribution to World Cinema Award at the Irish Film and Television Awards.\nHe was the recipient of the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actor for \"Daddy's Home 2\", and was nominated for the same award for \"The Expendables 3\" (2014), \"Dangerous\" (2021) and \"Confidential Informant\" (2023).\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "44220", "revid": "27823944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44220", "title": "UEFA Champions League", "text": "European association football tournament\nFootball tournament\nThe UEFA Champions League (UCL), usually known simply as the Champions League, is an annual club association football competition organised by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) that is contested by top-division European clubs. The competition begins with a round robin league phase to qualify for the double-legged knockout rounds, and a single-leg final. It is the most-watched club competition in the world and the third most-watched football competition overall, behind only the FIFA World Cup and the UEFA European Championship. It is one of the most prestigious football tournaments in the world and the most prestigious club competition in European football, played by the national league champions (and, for some nations, one or more runners-up) of their national associations.\nIntroduced in 1955 as the European Champion Clubs' Cup (), and commonly known as the European Cup, it was initially a straight knockout tournament open only to the champions of Europe's domestic leagues, with its winner reckoned as the European club champion. The competition took on its current name in 1992, adding a round-robin group stage in 1991 and allowing multiple entrants from certain countries since the 1997\u201398 season. While only the winners of many of Europe's national leagues can enter the competition, the top 5 leagues by coefficient provide four teams each by default, with a possibility for additional spots based on performance during the previous season. Clubs that finish below the qualifying spots are eligible for the second-tier UEFA Europa League competition, and since 2021, for the third-tier UEFA Conference League.\nIn its present format, the Champions League begins in early July with three qualifying rounds and a play-off round, all played over two legs. The seven surviving teams enter the league phase, joining 29 teams qualified in advance. The 36 teams each play eight opponents, four home and four away. The 24 highest-ranked teams proceed to the knockout phase that culminates with the final match in late May or early June. The winner of the Champions League automatically qualifies for the following year's Champions League, the UEFA Super Cup, the FIFA Intercontinental Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup.\nSpanish clubs have the most victories (20 wins), followed by England (15 wins), Italy (12 wins), Germany (8 wins), Netherlands (6 wins) and Portugal (4 wins). England has the most winning teams, with six clubs having won the title. The competition has been won by 24 clubs and 13 of them have won it more than once. Since the tournament changed name and structure in 1992, only two top-tier football clubs outside the Big Five European nations (Spain, England, Italy, Germany and France) have also reached the final: Porto (2003\u201304) and Ajax (1994\u201395 and 1995\u201396).\nReal Madrid is the most successful club in the tournament's history, having won it 15 times. Madrid is the only club to have won it five times in a row (the first five editions). Only one club has won all of their matches in a single tournament en route to the tournament victory: Bayern Munich in the 2019\u201320 season. Paris Saint-Germain are the current European champions, having beaten Inter Milan 5\u20130 in the 2025 final for their first ever title.\nHistory.\nThe first time the champions of two European leagues met was in what was nicknamed the 1895 World Championship, when English champions Sunderland beat Scottish champions Heart of Midlothian 5\u20133. The first pan-European tournament was the Challenge Cup, a competition between clubs in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Three years later, in 1900, the champions of Belgium, Netherlands and Switzerland, which were the only existing leagues in continental Europe at the time, participated in the Coupe Van der Straeten Ponthoz, thus being dubbed as the \"club championship of the continent\" by the local newspapers.\nThe Mitropa Cup, a competition modelled after the Challenge Cup, was created in 1927, an idea of Austrian Hugo Meisl, and played between Central European clubs. In 1930, the Coupe des Nations (lit.\u2009'Nations Cup'), the first attempt to create a cup for national champion clubs of Europe, was played and organised by Swiss club Servette. Held in Geneva, it brought together ten champions from across the continent. The tournament was won by \u00dajpest of Hungary. Latin European nations came together to form the Latin Cup in 1949.\nAfter receiving reports from his journalists over the highly successful South American Championship of Champions of 1948, Gabriel Hanot, editor of \"L'\u00c9quipe\", began proposing the creation of a continent-wide tournament. In interviews, Jacques Ferran (one of the founders of the European Champions Cup, together with Gabriel Hanot), said that the South American Championship of Champions was the inspiration for the European Champions Cup. After Stan Cullis declared Wolverhampton Wanderers \"Champions of the World\" following a successful run of friendlies in the 1950s, in particular a 3\u20132 friendly victory against Budapest Honv\u00e9d, Hanot finally managed to convince UEFA to put into practice such a tournament. It was conceived in Paris in 1955 as the European Champion Clubs' Cup.\n1955\u20131967: Beginnings.\nThe first European Cup took place during the 1955\u201356 season. Sixteen teams participated (some by invitation): AC Milan (Italy), AGF Aarhus (Denmark), Anderlecht (Belgium), Djurg\u00e5rden (Sweden), Gwardia Warszawa (Poland), Hibernian (Scotland), Partizan (Yugoslavia), PSV Eindhoven (Netherlands), Rapid Wien (Austria), Real Madrid (Spain), Rot-Weiss Essen (West Germany), Saarbr\u00fccken (Saar), Servette (Switzerland), Sporting CP (Portugal), Reims (France) and V\u00f6r\u00f6s Lobog\u00f3 (Hungary).\nThe first European Cup match took place on 4 September 1955, and ended in a 3\u20133 draw between Sporting CP and Partizan. The first goal in European Cup history was scored by Jo\u00e3o Baptista Martins of Sporting CP. The inaugural final took place at the Parc des Princes between Stade de Reims and Real Madrid on 13 June 1956. The Spanish squad came back from behind to win 4\u20133 thanks to goals from Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano and Marquitos, as well as two goals from H\u00e9ctor Rial. Real Madrid successfully defended the trophy next season in their home stadium, the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u, against Fiorentina. After a scoreless first half, Real Madrid scored twice in six minutes to defeat the Italians. In 1958, Milan failed to capitalise after going ahead on the scoreline twice, only for Real Madrid to equalise. The final, held in Heysel Stadium, went to extra time where Francisco Gento scored the game-winning goal to allow Real Madrid to retain the title for the third consecutive season.\nIn a rematch of the first final, Real Madrid faced Stade Reims at the Neckarstadion for the 1959 final, and won 2\u20130. West German side Eintracht Frankfurt became the first team not to compete in the Latin cup to reach the European Cup final. The 1960 final holds the record for the most goals scored, with Real Madrid beating Eintracht Frankfurt 7\u20133 at Hampden Park, courtesy of four goals by Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s and a hat-trick by Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano. This was Real Madrid's fifth consecutive title, a record that still stands today.\nReal Madrid's reign ended in the 1960\u201361 season when bitter rivals Barcelona dethroned them in the first round. Barcelona were defeated in the final by Portuguese side Benfica 3\u20132 at the Wankdorf Stadium. Reinforced by Eus\u00e9bio, Benfica defeated Real Madrid 5\u20133 at the Olympic Stadium in Amsterdam and kept the title for a second consecutive season. Benfica wanted to repeat Real Madrid's successful run of the 1950s after reaching the showpiece event of the 1962\u201363 European Cup, but a brace from Brazilian-Italian Jos\u00e9 Altafini at Wembley gave the spoils to Milan, making the trophy leave the Iberian Peninsula for the first time ever.\nInter Milan beat an ageing Real Madrid 3\u20131 at the Ernst-Happel-Stadion to win the 1963\u201364 season and replicate their local-rival's success. The title stayed in Milan for the third year in a row after Inter beat Benfica 1\u20130 at their home ground, the San Siro. Under the leadership of Jock Stein, Scottish club Celtic beat Inter Milan 2\u20131 in the 1967 final to become the first British club to win the European Cup. The Celtic players that day, all of whom were born within of Glasgow, subsequently became known as the \"Lisbon Lions\".\n1968\u20131976.\nThe 1967\u201368 season saw Manchester United become the first English team to win the European Cup, beating two-times winners Benfica 4\u20131 in the final. In the 1968\u201369 season, Ajax became the first Dutch team to reach the European Cup final, but they were beaten 4\u20131 by Milan, who claimed their second European Cup, with Pierino Prati scoring a hat-trick.\nThe 1969\u201370 season saw the first Dutch winners of the competition. Feyenoord knocked out the defending champions, Milan in the second round, before beating Celtic in the final. In the 1970\u201371 season, Ajax won the title, beating Greek side Panathinaikos in the final. The season saw a number of changes, with penalty shoot-outs being introduced, and the away goals rule being changed so that it would be used in all rounds except the final. It was also the first time a Greek team reached the final, as well as the first season that Real Madrid failed to qualify, having finished sixth in La Liga the previous season. Ajax went on to win the competition three years in a row (1971 to 1973), which Bayern Munich emulated from 1974 to 1976.\nThe era was characterized by the dominance of football clubs from the Netherlands and West Germany, who together won 7 back-to-back European Cups between 1970 and 1976.\n1977\u20131997: Heysel Disaster and rebrand into Champions League.\nLiverpool won their first two titles in 1977 and 1978. The following seasons saw victories in 1978\u201379 and 1979\u201380 for Brian Clough's Nottingham Forest. The following year Liverpool won their third title before Aston Villa continued the sense of English dominance in 1982. In 1982\u201383, Hamburger SV broke the English dominance. Liverpool regained it in 1983\u201384 before losing to Juventus (1984\u201385). All English clubs were banned for five years (Liverpool for six years) following the 1985 European Cup final due to the Heysel Stadium disaster.\nFollowing the five-year ban on English teams, Steaua Bucure\u0219ti won the European Cup in 1985\u201386, followed by Porto in 1986\u201387, PSV Eindhoven in 1987\u201388; AC Milan (2), Red Star Belgrade and Barcelona became champions before the competition was re-formulated as the UEFA Champions League. The 1996-97 season was the final Champions League tournament in which only European league champions were allowed to compete; the tournament was won by Borussia Dortmund.\nThe era was characterized by the dominance of football clubs from England between 1977 and 1984, winning seven European Cup finals, and later the dominance of Italian football clubs in the 1990s; in a nine-year period from 1989 to 1998, Italian clubs reached nine Champions League finals.\n1998\u2013present: League expansion.\nThe era was characterized by the dominance of football clubs from Spain, who dominated the competition in 1998\u20132002 and again from 2014\u201318, with Real Madrid winning three back-to-back Champions League titles in 2016, 2017, and 2018, followed by the dominance of English football clubs between 2005\u201312 and again from 2018\u201323. Since the expansion of the Champions League in 1997\u201398, Spanish clubs reached 17 finals and English clubs reached 16 finals.\nDuring the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, the tournament was suspended in mid-March 2020 and resumed in August 2020.\nAnthem.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Magic...it's magic above all else. When you hear the anthem it captivates you straight away.\"\n\u2014Zinedine Zidane\nThe UEFA Champions League anthem, officially titled simply as \"Champions League\", was written by Tony Britten, and is an adaptation of George Frideric Handel's 1727 anthem \"Zadok the Priest\" (one of his Coronation Anthems). UEFA commissioned Britten in 1992 to arrange an anthem, and the piece was performed by London's Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and sung by the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields. Stating that \"the anthem is now almost as iconic as the trophy\", UEFA's official website adds it is \"known to set the hearts of many of the world's top footballers aflutter\".\nThe chorus contains the three official languages used by UEFA: English, German, and French. The climactic moment is set to the exclamations 'Die Meister! Die Besten! Les Grandes \u00c9quipes! The Champions!'. The anthem's chorus is played before each UEFA Champions League game as the two teams are lined up, as well as at the beginning and end of television broadcasts of the matches. In addition to the anthem, there is also entrance music, which contains parts of the anthem itself, which is played as teams enter the field. The complete anthem is about three minutes long, and has two short verses and the chorus.\nSpecial vocal versions have been performed live at the Champions League final with lyrics in other languages, changing over to the host nation's language for the chorus. These versions were performed by Andrea Bocelli (Italian; Rome 2009, Milan 2016 and Cardiff 2017), Juan Diego Flores (Spanish; Madrid 2010), All Angels (Wembley 2011), Jonas Kaufmann and David Garrett (Munich 2012) and Mariza (Lisbon 2014). In the 2013 final at Wembley, the chorus was played twice. In the 2018 and 2019 finals, held in Kyiv and Madrid respectively, the instrumental version of the chorus was played, by 2Cellos (2018) and Asturia Girls (2019). In the 2023 final, held in Istanbul, Hungarian pianist \u00c1d\u00e1m Gy\u00f6rgy performed the piano version of the anthem. The anthem has been released commercially in its original version on iTunes and Spotify with the title of Champions League Theme. In 2018, composer Hans Zimmer remixed the anthem with rapper Vince Staples for EA Sports' video game \"FIFA 19\", with it also featuring in the game's reveal trailer.\nBranding.\nIn 1991, UEFA asked its commercial partner, Television Event and Media Marketing (TEAM), to help brand the Champions League. This resulted in the anthem, \"house colours\" of black and white or silver and a logo, and the \"starball\". The starball was created by Design Bridge, a London-based firm selected by TEAM after a competition. TEAM gives particular attention to detail in how the colours and starball are depicted at matches. According to TEAM, \"Irrespective of whether you are a spectator in Moscow or Milan, you will always see the same stadium dressing materials, the same opening ceremony featuring the 'starball' centre circle ceremony, and hear the same UEFA Champions League Anthem\". Based on research it conducted, TEAM concluded that by 1999, \"the starball logo had achieved a recognition rate of 94 percent among fans\".\nFormat.\nQualification.\nThe UEFA Champions League used to begin with a double round-robin group stage of 32 teams until it evolved into a league phase of 36 teams, which is preceded by two qualification 'streams' for teams that do not receive direct entry to the tournament proper. The two streams are divided between teams qualified by virtue of being league champions, and those qualified by virtue of finishing second, third or fourth in their national championship.\nThe number of teams that each association enters into the UEFA Champions League is based upon the UEFA coefficients of the member associations. These coefficients are generated by the results of clubs representing each association during the previous five Champions League, Europa League and Conference League seasons. The higher an association's coefficient, the more teams represent the association in the Champions League, and the fewer qualification rounds the association's teams must compete in.\nFive of the remaining seven qualifying places are granted to the winners of a four-round qualifying tournament between the remaining 43 or 44 national champions, within which those champions from associations with higher coefficients receive byes to later rounds. The other two are granted to the winners of a three-round qualifying tournament between ten and eleven clubs from the associations ranked 5\u20136 through 15, which have qualified based upon finishing second, third or fourth in their respective national league.\nIn addition to sporting criteria, any club must be licensed by its national association to participate in the Champions League. To obtain a licence, the club must meet certain stadium, infrastructure and finance requirements.\nIn 2005\u201306, Liverpool and Artmedia Bratislava became the first teams to reach the Champions League group stage after playing in all three qualifying rounds. Real Madrid and Barcelona hold the record for the most appearances in the group stage, having qualified 29 times, followed by Bayern Munich on 28.\nBetween 1999 and 2008, no differentiation was made between champions and non-champions in qualification. The 16 top-ranked teams spread across the biggest domestic leagues qualified directly for the tournament group stage. Prior to this, three preliminary knockout qualifying rounds whittled down the remaining teams, with teams starting in different rounds.\nAn exception to the usual European qualification system happened in 2005, after Liverpool won the Champions League the year before, but did not finish in a Champions League qualification place in the Premier League that season. UEFA gave special dispensation for Liverpool to enter the Champions League, giving England five qualifiers. UEFA subsequently ruled that the defending champions qualify for the competition the following year regardless of their domestic league placing. However, for those leagues with four entrants in the Champions League, this meant that, if the Champions League winner fell outside of its domestic league's top four, it would qualify at the expense of the fourth-placed team in the league. Until 2015\u201316, no association could have more than four entrants in the Champions League. In May 2012, Tottenham Hotspur finished fourth in the 2011\u201312 Premier League, two places ahead of Chelsea, but failed to qualify for the 2012\u201313 Champions League, after Chelsea won the 2012 final. Tottenham were demoted to the 2012\u201313 UEFA Europa League.\nIn May 2013, it was decided that, starting from the 2015\u201316 season (and continuing at least for the three-year cycle until the 2017\u201318 season), the winners of the previous season's UEFA Europa League would qualify for the UEFA Champions League, entering at least the play-off round, and entering the group stage if the berth reserved for the Champions League title holders was not used. The previous limit of a maximum of four teams per association was increased to five, meaning that a fourth-placed team from one of the top three ranked associations would only have to be moved to the Europa League if both the Champions League and Europa League winners came from that association and both finished outside the top four of their domestic league. Starting from the 2018\u201319 season, the Europa League winner would receive automatic qualification for the Champions League group stage, with no additional entries required. Starting from the 2024\u201325 season, the two associations with the highest coefficients from the previous season would receive an extra Champions League spot (known as European Performance Spot) into the league phase. The Champions League and Europa League winners would not be able to fill the European Performance Spots, and they would still receive an additional spot if one or both came from the same top-five association and finished outside of the top four of their domestic league, though the fourth-placed team of the league would no longer go to the Europa League, thus increasing the maximum number of teams per association from five to seven.\nIn 2007, Michel Platini, the UEFA president, had proposed taking one place from the three leagues with four entrants and allocating it to that nation's cup winners. This proposal was rejected in a vote at a UEFA Strategy Council meeting. In the same meeting, however, it was agreed that the third-placed team in the top three leagues would receive automatic qualification for the group stage, rather than entry into the third qualifying round, while the fourth-placed team would enter the play-off round for non-champions, guaranteeing an opponent from one of the top 15 leagues in Europe. This was part of Platini's plan to increase the number of teams qualifying directly into the group stage, while simultaneously increasing the number of teams from lower-ranked nations in the group stage. In the reforming plan for the 2018\u201321 cycle, which was announced in August 2016 and confirmed in December, the top four teams in the top four leagues would receive automatic qualification for the group stage.\nIn 2012, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger referred to qualifying for the Champions League by finishing in the top four places in the Premier League as the \"4th Place Trophy\". The phrase was coined after a pre-match conference when he was questioned about Arsenal's lack of a trophy after exiting the FA Cup. He said \"The first trophy is to finish in the top four\". At Arsenal's 2012 AGM, Wenger was also quoted as saying: \"For me there are five trophies every season: Premier League, Champions League, the third is to qualify for the Champions League...\"\nLeague phase and knockout phase.\nBeginning with the 2024\u201325 season, UEFA changed the format of their three club competitions, abandoning the group stage in favour of an expanded league phase. The number of participating teams was increased from 32 to 36 teams. Teams are no longer divided into groups of four teams each but are ranked in a single table resembling the Swiss-system tournament format. Each team plays eight matches against eight different opponents. For the draw of the league phase, teams are divided into four seeding pots according to their UEFA coefficient. Each team will play against two teams from each pot, one home and one away. The league phase is played from September to January, while the knockout phase begins in February, with matches predominantly played on Tuesday and Wednesday nights.\nAfter the league phase, a two-legged knockout play-off round is played between teams finishing 9\u201316 (seeded) and 17\u201324 (unseeded) in the league phase. Teams finishing in the top eight of the league phase receive a bye to the round of 16 as seeded teams, while the eight winning teams from the knockout play-off round will enter the round of 16 draw as unseeded teams. Teams finishing 25th\u201336th place in the league phase and the eight losers of the knockout play-offs are eliminated from the competition and from European football since it is no longer possible to enter the Europa League from the league phase onwards.\nAfter the round of 16 the competition follows the traditional knockout format with quarter-finals, semi-finals (both two legged and without association draw protection) and then the final at a venue chosen prior to the season. The final is typically held in late May or early June.\nPrior to the 2024\u201325 season, there was a group stage of 32 teams, divided into eight groups of four. The draw to determine which teams entered each group was seeded based on each team's UEFA coefficient, and no group could contain more than one club from each association. Each team played six group stage games, meeting the other three teams in its group home and away in a round-robin format. The first place team and the runners-up from each group then progressed to the next round. The third-placed teams entered the Europa League's knockout round and the fourth-placed teams were eliminated from the competition.\nFor the next stage\u2014the last 16\u2014the winning team from one group played against the runners-up from another group, but teams from the same association could not be drawn against each other (see random two-sided matching). From the quarter-finals onwards, the draw was entirely random, without association protection.\nThe group stage was played from September to December, whilst the knockout stage began in February, with matches usually played on Tuesday and Wednesday nights. The knockout ties were played in a two-legged format, with the exception of the final. In the 2019\u201320 season, due to the COVID-19 pandemic the tournament was suspended for five months. The format of the remainder of the tournament was temporarily amended as a result, with the quarter-finals and semi-finals being played as single match knockout ties at neutral venues in Lisbon, Portugal in the summer with the final taking place on 23 August 2020.\nDistribution.\nThe following is the default access list.\nChanges will be made to the access list above if the Champions League or Europa League title holders qualify for the tournament via their domestic leagues.\nPrizes.\nTrophy and medals.\nEach year, the winning team is presented with the European Champion Clubs' Cup, the current version of which has been awarded since 1967. From the 1968\u201369 season and prior to the 2008\u201309 season any team that won the Champions League three years in a row or five times overall was awarded the official trophy permanently. Each time a club achieved this, a new official trophy had to be forged for the following season. Five clubs own a version of the official trophy: Real Madrid, Ajax, Bayern Munich, Milan and Liverpool. Since 2008, the official trophy has remained with UEFA and the clubs are awarded a replica.\nThe current trophy is tall and made of silver, weighing . It was designed by J\u00fcrg Stadelmann, a jeweller from Bern, Switzerland, after the original was given to Real Madrid in 1966 in recognition of their six titles to date, and cost 10,000 Swiss francs.\n50 gold medals are presented to the Champions League winners, and 50 silver medals to the runners-up.\nPrize money.\nStarting with the 2024\u201325 season, the distribution of the prize money is as follows.\nA large part of the distributed revenue from the UEFA Champions League is linked to the \"market pool\", the distribution of which is determined by the value of the television market in each nation. For the 2019\u201320 season, Paris Saint-Germain, who were the runners-up, earned nearly \u20ac126.8\u00a0million in total, of which \u20ac101.3\u00a0million was prize money, compared with the \u20ac125.46\u00a0million earned by Bayern Munich, who won the tournament and were awarded \u20ac112.96\u00a0million in prize money.\nSponsorship.\nLike the FIFA World Cup, the UEFA Champions League is sponsored by a group of multinational corporations, in contrast to the single main sponsor typically found in national top-flight leagues. When the Champions League was created in 1992, it was decided that a maximum of eight companies should be allowed to sponsor the event, with each corporation being allocated four advertising boards around the perimeter of the pitch, as well as logo placement at pre- and post-match interviews and a certain number of tickets to each match. This, combined with a deal to ensure tournament sponsors were given priority on television advertisements during matches, ensured that each of the tournament's main sponsors was given maximum exposure.\nFrom the 2012\u201313 knockout phase, UEFA used LED advertising hoardings installed in knockout participant stadiums, including the final. From the 2015\u201316 season onwards, UEFA has used such hoardings from the play-off round until the final. Since 2021, the UEFA also used Virtual Board Replacement (VBR) technology to offer region-based advertising; regional sponsors are inserted into the hoardings as shown on the broadcast feed in specific regions along with the global sponsors.\nIndividual clubs may wear jerseys with advertising. However, only two sponsorships are permitted per jersey in addition to that of the kit manufacturer, at the chest and the left sleeve. Exceptions are made for non-profit organisations, which can feature on the front of the shirt, incorporated with the main sponsor or in place of it; or on the back, either below the squad number or on the collar area.\nIf a club plays a match in a nation where the relevant sponsorship category is restricted (such as France's alcohol advertising restriction), then they must remove that logo from their jerseys. For example, when Rangers played French side Auxerre in the 1996\u201397 Champions League, they wore the logo of the holiday chain Center Parcs instead of their primary sponsor, McEwan's Lager (both companies at the time were subsidiaries of Scottish &amp; Newcastle).\nMedia coverage.\nThe competition attracts an extensive television audience, not just in Europe, but throughout the world. The final of the tournament has been, in recent years, the most-watched annual sporting event in the world. The final of the 2012\u201313 tournament had the competition's highest TV ratings to date, drawing approximately 360\u00a0million television viewers.\nTeam records and statistics.\nPerformance by club.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Table alignment/tables.css\" /&gt;\nPerformances by nation.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPlayer records.\nMost appearances.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;: \"As of 26 November 2025\"\nPlayers that are still active in Europe are highlighted in boldface.\nThe table below does not include appearances made in the qualification stage of the competition.\nMost goals.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;: \"As of 26 November 2025\"\nA \u2021 indicates the player was from the European Cup era. \nPlayers taking part in the 2025\u201326 UEFA Champions League are highlighted in bold.&lt;br&gt;\nThe table below does not include goals scored in the qualification stage of the competition.\n \"As of 1 October 2025\"\nMost assists.\nPlayers that are still active in Europe are highlighted in boldface.\nAwards.\nPlayer of the Season.\nStarting from the 2021\u201322 edition, UEFA introduced the UEFA Champions League Player of the Season award.\nThe jury is composed of the coaches of the clubs that participated in the group stage of the competition, as well as 55 journalists selected by the European Sports Media (ESM) group, one from each UEFA member association.\nYoung Player of the Season.\nIn the same season, UEFA also introduced the UEFA Champions League Young Player of the Season award.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "44221", "revid": "27015025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44221", "title": "Xerox Network Systems", "text": "Suite of computer network protocols developed by Xerox\nXerox Network Systems (XNS) is a computer networking protocol suite developed by Xerox within the Xerox Network Systems Architecture. It provided general purpose network communications, internetwork routing and packet delivery, and higher level functions such as a reliable stream, and remote procedure calls. XNS predated and influenced the development of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) networking model, and was very influential in local area networking designs during the 1980s.\nXNS was developed by the Xerox Systems Development Department in the early 1980s, who were charged with bringing Xerox PARC's research to market. XNS was based on the earlier (and equally influential) PARC Universal Packet (PUP) suite from the late 1970s. Some of the protocols in the XNS suite were lightly modified versions of the ones in the Pup suite. XNS added the concept of a network number, allowing larger networks to be constructed from multiple smaller ones, with routers controlling the flow of information between the networks.\nThe protocol suite specifications for XNS were placed in the public domain in 1977. This helped XNS become the canonical local area networking protocol, copied to various degrees by practically all networking systems in use into the 1990s. XNS was used unchanged by 3Com's 3+Share and Ungermann-Bass's Net/One. It was also used, with modifications, as the basis for Novell NetWare, and Banyan VINES. XNS was used as the basis for the AppleNet system, but this was never commercialized; a number of XNS's solutions to common problems were used in AppleNet's replacement, AppleTalk.\nDescription.\nOverall design.\nIn comparison to the OSI model's 7 layers, XNS is a five-layer system, like the later Internet protocol suite.\nThe Physical and Data Link layers of the OSI model correspond to the Physical layer (layer 0) in XNS, which was designed to use the transport mechanism of the underlying hardware and did not separate the data link. Specifically, XNS's Physical layer is really the Ethernet local area network system, also being developed by Xerox at the same time, and a number of its design decisions reflect that fact. The system was designed to allow Ethernet to be replaced by some other system, but that was not defined by the protocol (nor had to be).\nThe primary part of XNS is its definition of the Internal Transport layer (layer 1), which corresponds to OSI's Network layer, and it is here that the primary internetworking protocol, IDP, is defined. XNS combined the OSI's Session and Transport layers into the single Interprocess Communications layer (layer 2). Layer 3 was Resource Control, similar to the OSI's Presentation.\nFinally, on top of both models, is the Application layer, although these layers were not defined in the XNS standard.\nBasic internetwork protocol.\nThe main internetwork layer protocol is the Internet Datagram Protocol (IDP). IDP is a close descendant of Pup's internetwork protocol, and roughly corresponds to the Internet Protocol (IP) layer in the Internet protocol suite.\nIDP uses Ethernet's 48-bit address as the basis for its own network addressing, generally using the machine's MAC address as the primary unique identifier. To this is added another 48-bit address section provided by the networking equipment; 32 bits are provided by routers to identify the network number in the internetwork, and another 16 bits define a socket number for service selection within a single host. The network number portion of the address also includes a special value which meant \"this network\", for use by hosts which did not (yet) know their network number.\nUnlike TCP/IP, socket numbers are part of the full network address in the IDP header, so that upper-layer protocols do not need to implement demultiplexing; IDP also supplies packet types (again, unlike IP). IDP also contains a checksum covering the entire packet, but it is optional, not mandatory. This reflects the fact that LANs generally have low-error rates, so XNS removed error correction from the lower-level protocols in order to improve performance. Error correction could be optionally added at higher levels in the protocol stack, for instance, in XNS's own SPP protocol. XNS was widely regarded as faster than IP due to this design note.\nIn keeping with the low-latency LAN connections it runs on, XNS uses a short packet size, which improves performance in the case of low error rates and short turnaround times. IDP packets are up to 576 bytes long, including the 30 byte IDP header. In comparison, IP requires all hosts to support at \"least\" 576, but supports packets of up to 65K bytes. Individual XNS host pairs on a particular network might use larger packets, but no XNS router is required to handle them, and no mechanism is defined to discover if the intervening routers support larger packets. Also, packets can not be fragmented, as they can in IP.\nThe Routing Information Protocol (RIP), a descendant of Pup's \"Gateway Information Protocol\", is used as the router information-exchange system, and (slightly modified to match the syntax of addresses of other protocol suites), remains in use today in other protocol suites, such as the Internet protocol suite.\nXNS also implements a simple echo protocol at the internetwork layer, similar to IP's ping, but operating at a lower level in the networking stack. Instead of adding the ICMP data as payload in an IP packet, as in ping, XNS's echo placed the command directly within the underlying IDP packet. The same might be achieved in IP by expanding the ICMP Protocol field of the IP header.\nTransport layer protocols.\nThere are two primary transport layer protocols, both very different from their Pup predecessor:\nXNS, like Pup, also uses EP, the \"Error Protocol\", as a reporting system for problems such as dropped packets. This provided a unique set of packets which can be filtered to look for problems.\nApplication protocols.\nCourier RPC.\nIn the original Xerox concept, application protocols such as remote printing, filing, and mailing, etc., employed a remote procedure call protocol named Courier. Courier contained primitives to implement most of the features of Xerox's Mesa programming language function calls. Applications had to manually serialize and de-serialize function calls in Courier; there was no automatic facility to translate a function activation frame into an RPC (i.e. no \"RPC compiler\" was available). Because Courier was used by all applications, the XNS application protocol documents specified only courier function-call interfaces, and module+function binding tuples. There was a special facility in Courier to allow a function call to send or receive bulk data.\nInitially, XNS service location was performed via broadcasting remote procedure-calls using a series of expanding ring broadcasts (in consultation with the local router, to get networks at increasing distances.) Later, the Clearinghouse Protocol 3-level directory service was created to perform service location, and the expanding-ring broadcasts were used only to locate an initial Clearinghouse.\nDue to its tight integration with Mesa as an underlying technology, many of the traditional higher-level protocols were not part of the XNS system itself. This meant that vendors using the XNS protocols all created their own solutions for file sharing and printer support. While many of these 3rd party products theoretically could talk to each other at a packet level, there was little or no capability to call each other's application services. This led to complete fragmentation of the XNS market, and has been cited as one of the reasons that IP easily displaced it.\nAuthentication.\nThe XNS protocols also included an Authentication Protocol and an Authentication Service to support it. Its \"Strong credentials\" were based on the same Needham\u2013Schroeder protocol that was later used by Kerberos. After contacting the authentication service for credentials, this protocol provided a lightweight way to digitally sign Courier procedure calls, so that receivers could verify the signature and authenticate senders over the XNS internet, without having to contact the Authentication service again for the length of the protocol communication session.\nPrinting.\nXerox's printing language, Interpress, was a binary-formatted standard for controlling laser printers. The designers of this language, John Warnock and Chuck Geschke, later left Xerox PARC to start Adobe Systems. Before leaving, they realized the difficulty of specifying a binary print language, where functions to serialize the print job were cumbersome and which made it difficult to debug errant printing jobs. To realize the value of specifying both a programmable and easily debug-able print job in ASCII, Warnock and Geschke created the Postscript language as one of their first products at Adobe.\nRemote Debug Protocols.\nBecause all 8000+ machines in the Xerox corporate Intranet ran the Wildflower architecture (designed by Butler Lampson), there was a remote-debug protocol for microcode. Basically, a peek and poke function could halt and manipulate the microcode state of a C-series or D-series machine, anywhere on earth, and then restart the machine.\nAlso, there was a remote debug protocol for the world-swap debugger. This protocol could, via the debugger \"nub\", freeze a workstation and then peek and poke various parts of memory, change variables, and continue execution. If debugging symbols were available, a crashed machine could be remote debugged from anywhere on earth.\nHistory.\nOrigins in Ethernet and PUP.\nIn his final year at Harvard University, Bob Metcalfe began interviewing at a number of companies and was given a warm welcome by Jerry Elkind and Bob Taylor at Xerox PARC, who were beginning to work on the networked computer workstations that would become the Xerox Alto. He agreed to join PARC in July, after defending his thesis. In 1970, while couch surfing at Steve Crocker's home while attending a conference, Metcalfe picked up a copy Proceedings of the Fall Joint Computer Conference off the table with the aim of falling asleep while reading it. Instead, he became fascinated by an article on ALOHAnet, an earlier wide-area networking system. By June he had developed his own theories on networking and presented them to his professors, who rejected it and he was \"thrown out on my ass.\"\nMetcalfe was welcomed at PARC in spite of his unsuccessful thesis, and soon started development of what was then referred to as \"ALOHAnet in a wire\". He teamed up with David Boggs to help with the electronic implementation, and by the end of 1973 they were building working hardware at 3\u00a0Mbit/s. The pair then began working on a simple protocol that would run on the system. This led to the development of the PARC Universal Packet (Pup) system, and by late 1974 the two had Pup successfully running on Ethernet. They filed a patent on the concepts, with Metcalfe adding several other names because he believed they deserved mention, and then submitted a paper on the concept to Communications of the ACM on \"Ethernet: Distributed Packet Switching for Local Computer Networks\", published in July 1976.\nPUP to XNS.\nBy 1975, long before PUP was complete, Metcalfe was already chafing under the stiff Xerox management. He believed the company should immediately put Ethernet into production, but found little interest among upper management. A seminal event took place when professors from MIT's famed Artificial Intelligence Laboratory approached Xerox in 1974 with the intention of buying Ethernet for use in their lab. Xerox management declined, believing Ethernet was better used to help sell their own equipment. The AI Lab would then go on to make their own version of Ethernet, Chaosnet.\nMetcalfe eventually left Xerox November 1975 for Transaction Technology, a division of Citibank tasked with advanced product development. However, he was lured back to Xerox seven months later by David Liddle, who had recently organized the Systems Development Division within Xerox specifically to bring PARCs concepts to market. Metcalfe immediately began re-designing Ethernet to work at 20\u00a0Mbit/s and started an effort to re-write Pup in a production quality version. Looking for help on Pup, Metcalfe approached Yogen Dalal, who was at that time completing his PhD thesis under Vint Cerf at Stanford University. Dalal was also being heavily recruited by Bob Kahn's ARPANET team (working on TCP/IP), but when Cerf left to join DARPA, Dalal agreed to move to PARC and started there in 1977.\nDalal built a team including William Crowther and Hal Murray, and started with a complete review of Pup. Dalal also attempted to remain involved in the TCP efforts underway at DARPA, but eventually gave up and focussed fully on Pup. Dalal combined his experience with ARPANET with the concepts from Pup and by the end of 1977 they had published the first draft of the Xerox Network System specification. This was essentially a version of Pup with absolute 48-bit host IDs, and TCP's 3-Way handshake in the Sequenced Packet Protocol.\nBy early 1978 the new system was working, but management was still not making any move to commercialize it. As Metcalfe put it:\nWhen I came back to Xerox in 1976, we were about two and a half years from product shipment and in 1978 we were about two and a half years from product shipment.\nWhen no further action was forthcoming, Metcalfe left the company at the end of 1978.\nImpact.\nLast used by Xerox for communication with the DocuTech 135 Publishing System, XNS is no longer in use, due to the ubiquity of IP. However, it played an important role in the development of networking technology in the 1980s, by influencing software and hardware vendors to seriously consider the need for computing platforms to support more than one network protocol stack simultaneously.\nA wide variety of proprietary networking systems were directly based on XNS or offered minor variations on the theme. Among these were Net/One, 3+, Banyan VINES and Novell's IPX/SPX. These systems added their own concepts on top of the XNS addressing and routing system; VINES added a directory service among other services, while Novell NetWare added a number of user-facing services like printing and file sharing. AppleTalk used XNS-like routing, but had incompatible addresses using shorter numbers.\nXNS also helped to validate the design of the 4.2BSD network subsystem by providing a second protocol suite, one which was significantly different from the Internet protocols; by implementing both stacks in the same kernel, Berkeley researchers demonstrated that the design was suitable for more than just IP. Additional BSD modifications were eventually necessary to support the full range of Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) protocols.\nLiterature.\n\"Xerox Network Systems Architecture Introduction to Xerox Network Systems\" (XNSG 058504) is \"a general discussion meant for those who want to know how office people can become more effective and productive by using the Xerox Network Systems.\"\nThe components of Xerox Network Systems Architecture are briefly described in \"Xerox Network Systems Architecture General Information Manual\" (XNSG 068504).\nA series of sixteen individual protocol descriptions are listed in the \"Xerox Systems Institute Literature Catalog\".

The original Hungarian notation uses only intention or kind in its naming convention and is sometimes called \"Apps Hungarian\" as it became popular in the Microsoft Apps division in the development of Microsoft Office applications. When the Microsoft Windows division adopted the naming convention, they based it on the actual data type, and this convention became widely spread through the Windows API; this is sometimes called \"Systems Hungarian\" notation.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSimonyi: ...BCPL [had] a single type which was a 16-bit word... not that it matters.\nBooch: Unless you continue the Hungarian notation.\nSimonyi: Absolutely... we went over to the typed languages too later ... But ... we would look at one name and I would tell you exactly a lot about that...\nHungarian notation was designed to be language-independent, and found its first major use with the BCPL programming language. Because BCPL has no data types other than the machine word, nothing in the language itself helps a programmer remember variables' types. Hungarian notation aims to remedy this by providing the programmer with explicit knowledge of each variable's data type.\nIn Hungarian notation, a variable name starts with a group of lower-case letters which are mnemonics for the type or purpose of that variable, followed by whatever name the programmer has chosen; this last part is sometimes distinguished as the \"given name\". The first character of the given name can be capitalized to separate it from the type indicators (see also CamelCase). Otherwise the case of this character denotes scope.\nHistory.\nThe original Hungarian notation was invented by Charles Simonyi, a programmer who worked at Xerox PARC circa 1972\u20131981, and who later became Chief Architect at Microsoft. The name of the notation is a reference to Simonyi's nation of origin, and also, according to Andy Hertzfeld, because it made programs \"look like they were written in some inscrutable foreign language\". Hungarian people's names are \"reversed\" compared to most other European names; the family name precedes the given name. For example, the anglicized name \"Charles Simonyi\" in Hungarian was originally \"Simonyi K\u00e1roly\". In the same way, the type name precedes the \"given name\" in Hungarian notation. The similar Smalltalk \"type last\" naming style (e.g. aPoint and lastPoint) was common at Xerox PARC during Simonyi's tenure there.\nSimonyi's paper on the notation referred to prefixes used to indicate the \"type\" of information being stored. His proposal was largely concerned with decorating identifier names based upon the semantic information of what they store (in other words, the variable's \"purpose\"). Simonyi's notation came to be called Apps Hungarian, since the convention was used in the applications division of Microsoft. Systems Hungarian developed later in the Microsoft Windows development team. Apps Hungarian is not entirely distinct from what became known as Systems Hungarian, as some of Simonyi's suggested prefixes contain little or no semantic information (see below for examples).\nSystems Hungarian vs. Apps Hungarian.\nWhere Systems notation and Apps notation differ is in the purpose of the prefixes.\nIn Systems Hungarian notation, the prefix encodes the actual data type of the variable. For example:\nApps Hungarian notation strives to encode the logical data type rather than the physical data type; in this way, it gives a hint as to what the variable's purpose is, or what it represents.\nMost, but not all, of the prefixes Simonyi suggested are semantic in nature. To modern eyes, some prefixes seem to represent physical data types, such as codice_14 for strings. However, such prefixes were still semantic, as Simonyi intended Hungarian notation for languages whose type systems could not distinguish some data types that modern languages take for granted.\nThe following are examples from the original paper:\nWhile the notation always uses initial lower-case letters as mnemonics, it does not prescribe the mnemonics themselves. There are several widely used conventions (see examples below), but any set of letters can be used, as long as they are consistent within a given body of code.\nIt is possible for code using Apps Hungarian notation to sometimes contain Systems Hungarian when describing variables that are defined solely in terms of their type.\nRelation to sigils.\nIn some programming languages, a similar notation now called sigils is built into the language and enforced by the compiler. For example, in some forms of BASIC, codice_20 names a string and codice_21 names an integer. The major difference between Hungarian notation and sigils is that sigils declare the type of the variable in the language, whereas Hungarian notation is purely a naming scheme with no effect on the machine interpretation of the program text.\nExamples.\nThe mnemonics for pointers and arrays, which are not actual data types, are usually followed by the type of the data element itself:\nWhile Hungarian notation can be applied to any programming language and environment, it was widely adopted by Microsoft for use with the C language, in particular for Microsoft Windows, and its use remains largely confined to that area. In particular, use of Hungarian notation was widely evangelized by Charles Petzold's \"Programming Windows\", the original (and for many readers, the definitive) book on Windows API programming. Thus, many commonly seen constructs of Hungarian notation are specific to Windows:\nThe notation is sometimes extended in C++ to include the scope of a variable, optionally separated by an underscore. This extension is often also used without the Hungarian type-specification:\nAdvantages.\nSupporters argue that the benefits of Hungarian Notation include:\nDisadvantages.\nMost arguments against Hungarian notation are against \"Systems\" Hungarian notation, not \"Apps\" Hungarian notation.

He became ruler on 15 June 530 after deposing his first cousin twice removed, Hilderic, who had angered the Vandal nobility by converting to Chalcedonian Christianity; most Vandals at the time were fierce Arian Christians.\nThe Eastern Roman Emperor Justinian I, who had supported Hilderic, soon declared war on the Vandals, ostensibly to restore Hilderic. In June 533, Justinian sent an expeditionary force commanded by Belisarius which finally reached Africa in the beginning of September. Meanwhile, in Sardinia, which formed part of the Vandal domain, the governor Godas, a Goth, revolted against Gelimer and began to treat with Justinian as an independent sovereign. Gelimer, ignorant or contemptuous of Justinian's plans, sent a large army consisting of most of the available army in Africa under his brother Tzazo to crush the rebellion, meaning that the landing of Belisarius was entirely unopposed. \nOn landing, Belisarius immediately marched for Carthage, finally meeting resistance on 13 September when he was confronted by Gelimer at Ad Decimum, 10 miles from Carthage. Although outnumbered 11,000 to 17,000 the battle was evenly fought by the Vandals until Gelimer's brother Ammatus was killed, at which time Gelimer lost heart and fled. On 14 September 533, Belisarius entered Carthage and ate the feast prepared for Gelimer in his palace. However, Belisarius was too late to save the life of Hilderic, who had been slain at Gelimer's orders as soon as the news of the landing of the imperial army came.\nHowever, Gelimer had escaped the Roman pursuit, and on the return of Tzazo from Sardinia the combined Vandal army met Belisarius in battle at Tricamarum about 20 miles from Carthage (December 533). This battle was far more stubbornly contested than that of Ad Decimum, but it ended in the utter rout of the Vandals and, once more, the flight of Gelimer. He retreated to \"Mons Pappua\" (maybe in the Mount Edough, near Annaba) on the border of Numidia, where he soon found himself besieged by Byzantine forces under Pharas. According to Procopius, when summoned to surrender Gelimer instead asked Pharas to send him a loaf of bread, a sponge, and a lyre, to make the winter months on Pappua more bearable. \nFinally, in March 534, with his followers and their children starving and realizing he had no chance of regaining his kingdom, Gelimer surrendered to Belisarius and accepted the Romans' offer of vast estates in Galatia where he lived to be an old man. According to Procopius, on his abdication he achieved some degree of anecdotal fame by crying out the verse from Ecclesiastes1:2, 'Vanity of vanities, all is vanity' during Belisarius's triumph in Constantinople.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "44234", "revid": "8273231", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44234", "title": "Stage lighting", "text": "Craft of lighting at performances\nStage lighting is the craft of lighting as it applies to the production of theater, dance, opera, and other performance arts. Several different types of stage lighting instruments are used in this discipline. In addition to basic lighting, modern stage lighting can also include special effects, such as lasers and fog machines. People who work on stage lighting are commonly referred to as lighting technicians or lighting designers.\nThe equipment used for stage lighting (e.g. cabling, dimmers, lighting instruments, controllers) are also used in other lighting applications, including corporate events, concerts, trade shows, broadcast television, film production, photographic studios, and other types of live events. The personnel needed to install, operate, and control the equipment also cross over into these different areas of \"stage lighting\" applications.\nHistory.\nThe earliest known form of stage lighting was during the early Grecian (and later the Roman) theaters. They would build their theatres facing east to west so that in the afternoon they could perform plays and have the natural sunlight hit the actors, but not those seated in the orchestra. Natural light continued to be utilized when playhouses were built with a large circular opening at the top of the theater. Early Modern English theaters were roofless, allowing natural light to be utilized for lighting the stage. As theaters moved indoors, artificial lighting using candles and oil lamps supplemented the use of natural light via windows and shutters. Key developments in lighting technologies and practices were developed alongside the scenic stage in Italian Court Theatres by architect designers such as Bastiano da Sangallo (1481-1551), Sebastiano Serlio (1475-1554), Leone di Somi (1527-1592) and Angelo Ingegneri (1550-1613). Renaissance lighting techniques (including the use of darkness) were developed across Europe and detailed clearly in the writings of two architects, the Italian (Nicol\u00f3)Nicola Sabbattini (1574-1654) and the German Joseph Furttenbach (1591-1667).\nIn England following the Civil War all stage production was suspended in 1642 and no advancements were made to English theaters. During this theatrical famine, great developments were being made in theaters on the European mainland. Charles II, who would later become King Charles II witnessed Italian theatrical methods and brought them back to England when he came to power. New playhouses were built in England and their large sizes called for more elaborate lighting. After the refurbishing of the theaters, it was found that the \"main source of light in Restoration theaters to be chandeliers\" which were \"concentrated toward the front of the house, and especially over the forestage\". English theatres during this time used dipped candles to light chandeliers and sconces. Dipped candles were made by dipping a wick into hot wax repeatedly to create a cylindrical candle. Candles needed frequent trimming and relighting regardless of what was happening on-stage because \"they dripped hot grease on both the audience and actors\". Chandeliers also blocked the view of some patrons.\nThere were two different types of Restoration theaters in England: Restoration commercial theaters and Restoration court theaters. Commercial theaters tended to be more \"conservative in their lighting, for economic reasons\" and therefore used \"candle-burning chandeliers\" primarily. Court theatres could afford to \"use most of the Continental innovations\" in their productions. Theaters such as the Drury Lane Theatre and the Covent Garden Theatre were lit by a large central chandelier and had a varying number of smaller stage chandeliers and candle sconces around the walls of the theaters. Two main court theaters, built between 1660 and 1665, were the Cockpit Theatre and the Hall Theatre. Chandeliers and sconces seemed to be the primary lighting sources here but other developments were being made, especially at the Hall. By the 1670s, the Hall Theatre started using footlights, and between 1670 and 1689 they used candles or lamps. It can be noted that by the end of the 17th century, \"French and English stages were fairly similar\". There is not much written on theatrical lighting in England at the end of the 17th century and from the little information historians do have, not much changed by the middle of the 18th century. Gas lighting hit the English stage in the early 1800s beginning with the Drury Lane and Covent Garden theaters. In the 1820s, a new type of artificial illumination was developed. In this type of illumination, a gas flame is used to heat a cylinder of quicklime (calcium oxide). Upon reaching a certain temperature, the quicklime would begin to incandesce. This illumination could then be directed by reflectors and lenses. It took some time from the development of this new Limelight before it found its way into theatrical use, which started around 1837. Limelight became popular in the 1860s and beyond, until it was displaced by electrical lighting. Lighting advances made in English theaters during this time frame paved the way for the many lighting advances in the modern theatrical world.\nFunctions of lighting.\nStage lighting has multiple functions, including:\nLighting design is an art form, and thus no one way is the \"correct\" way. There is a modern movement that states that the lighting design helps to create the environment in which the action takes place while supporting the style of the piece. \"Mood\" is arguable while the environment is essential.10\nQualities in lighting.\nIntensity.\nIntensity is measured in lux, lumens and foot-candles. The intensity of a luminaire (lighting instrument or fixture) depends on a number of factors including its lamp power, the design of the instrument (and its efficiency), optical obstructions such as color gels or mechanical filters, the distance to the area to be lit and the beam or field angle of the fixture, the color and material to be lit, and the relative contrasts to other regions of illumination.7\nColor.\nColor temperature is measured in kelvins. A light's apparent color is determined by its lamp color, the color of any gels in the optical path, its power level, and the color of the material it lights.7\nA tungsten lamp's color is typically controlled by inserting one or more gels (filters) into its optical path. In the simplest case, a single gel is inserted into the optical path to produce light of the same color. For example, a blue gel is used to create blue light. Custom colors are obtained by means of subtractive CMY color mixing, by inserting combinations of cyan, magenta and yellow filters into the optical path of the lighting fixture. The inserted filters may have varying densities, with correspondingly varied percentages of transmission, that \"subtractively\" mix colors (the filters absorb unwanted light colors, but the desired colors pass through unaffected). Manufacturers will sometimes include an additional green or amber (\"CTO\" color correction) filter to extend the range (gamut) of subtractive color mixing systems.\nLamp power also influences color in tungsten lamps. As the lamp power is decreased, the tungsten filament in a bulb will tend to produce increasing percentages of orange light, as compared to the nearly white light emitted at full power. This is known as \"amber shift\" or \"amber drift\". Thus a 1000-watt instrument at 50 percent power will emit a higher percentage of orange light than a 500-watt instrument operating at full power.50\nLED fixtures create color through additive color mixing with red, green, blue, and in some cases amber, LEDs at different intensities. This type of color mixing is often used with borderlights and cyclorama lights.\nDirection.\nDirection refers to the shape, quality and evenness of a lamp's output. The pattern of light an instrument makes is largely determined by three factors. The first are the specifics of the lamp, reflector and lens assembly. Different mounting positions for the lamp (axial, base up, base down), different sizes and shapes of reflector and the nature of the lens (or lenses) being used can all affect the pattern of light. Secondly, the specifics of how the lamp is focused affect its pattern. In \"ellipsoidal reflector spotlights (ERS)\" or \"profile spotlights\", there are two beams of light emitted from the lamp. When the cones of both intersect at the throw distance (the distance to the stage), the lamp has a sharply defined 'hard' edge. When the two cones do not intersect at that distance, the edge is fuzzy and 'soft'. Depending on which beam (direct or reflected) is outside the other, the pattern may be 'thin and soft' or 'fat and soft'. Lastly, a gobo or break up pattern may be applied to ERSs and similar instruments. This is typically a thin sheet of metal with a shape cut into it. It is inserted into the instrument near its aperture. Gobos, or templates, come in many shapes, but often include leaves, waves, stars and similar patterns.62-64\nFocus, position, and hanging.\nThe focus is where an instrument is pointed. The final focus should place the \"hot spot\" of the beam at the actor's head level when standing at the center of the instrument's assigned \"focus area\" on the stage. Position refers to the location of an instrument in the theater's fly system or on permanent pipes in front-of-house locations. Hanging is the act of placing the instrument in its assigned position.181\nIn addition to these, certain modern instruments are automated, referring to motorized movement of either the entire fixture body or the movement of a mirror placed in front of its outermost lens. These fixtures and the more traditional follow spots add direction and motion to the relevant characteristics of light. Automated fixtures fall into either the \"moving head\" or \"moving mirror/scanner\" category. Scanners have a body which contains the lamp, circuit boards, transformer, and effects (color, gobo, iris etc.) devices. A mirror is panned and tilted in the desired position by pan and tilt motors, thereby causing the light beam to move. Moving head fixtures have the effects and lamp assembly inside the head with transformers and other electronics in the base or external ballast. There are advantages and disadvantages to both. Scanners are typically faster and less costly than moving head units but have a narrower range of movement. Moving head fixtures have a much larger range of movement as well as a more natural inertial movement but are typically more expensive.152\u2013158\nThe above characteristics are not always static, and it is frequently the variation in these characteristics that is used in achieving the goals of lighting.\nStanley McCandless was perhaps the first to define controllable qualities of light used in theater. In \"A Method for Lighting the Stage\", McCandless discusses \"color\", \"distribution\", \"intensity\" and \"movement\" as the qualities that can be manipulated by a lighting designer to achieve the desired visual, emotional and thematic look on stage. The McCandless method, outlined in that book, is widely embraced today. The method involves lighting an object on the stage from three angles\u20142 lights at 45 degrees to the left and right, and one at 90 degrees (perpendicular to the front of the object).55-56\nAn alternative formulation is by Jody Briggs, who calls them \"Variable of Light\": Angle, Color, Intensity, Distance, Texture, Edge-quality, Size, and Shape.\nLighting professionals.\nLighting designer.\nA lighting designer (LD) is familiar with the various types of lighting instruments and their uses. In consultation with the director, the DSM (deputy stage manager) and the scenic designer, and after observing rehearsals, the LD creates an instrument schedule and a light plot as well as informing the DSM where each LX (lighting) cue is designed to be triggered in the script, which the DSM notes down in their plot book. The schedule is a list of all required lighting equipment, including color gel, gobos, color wheels, barndoors and other accessories. The light plot is typically a plan view of the theatre where the performance will take place, with every luminaire marked. This typically specifies the approximate lighting focus and direction, a reference number, accessories, the address number (assigned DMX addresses) in the dimmer system and channel on the lighting control console.12-13\nA lighting designer must satisfy the requirements set forth by the director or head planner. Practical experience is required to know the effective use of different lighting instruments and color in creating a design. Many designers start their careers as lighting technicians. Often, this is followed by training in a vocational college or university that offers theatre courses. Many jobs in larger venues and productions require a degree from a vocational school or college in theatrical lighting, or at least a bachelor's degree.\nOther positions.\nIn theater:\nIn film:\nLighting equipment.\nLighting instruments.\nIn the context of lighting design, a lighting instrument (also called a \"luminaire\" or \"lantern\") is a device that produces controlled lighting as part of the effects a lighting designer brings to a show. The term \"lighting instrument\" is preferred to \"light\" to avoid confusion between light and light sources.\nThere are a variety of instruments frequently used in the theater. Although they vary in many ways they all have the following four basic components in one form or other:\nAdditional features will vary depending on the exact type of fixture.\nMost theatrical light bulbs (or \"lamps\", the term usually preferred) are tungsten-halogen (or quartz-halogen), an improvement on the original incandescent design that uses a halogen gas instead of an inert gas to increase lamp life and output. Fluorescent lights are infrequently used other than as worklights because, although they are far more efficient, they are expensive to make \"dimmed\" (run at less than full power) without using specialised dimmer ballasts and only very expensive models will dim to very low levels. They also do not produce light from a single point or easily concentrated area, and usually have a warm-up period, during which they emit no light or do so intermittently. However, fluorescent lights are being used more and more for special effects lighting in theaters. High-intensity discharge lamps (or HID lamps), however, are now common where a very bright light output is required\u2014for example in large follow spots, hydrargyrum medium-arc iodide (HMI) floods, and modern automated fixtures. When dimming is required, it is done by mechanical dousers or shutters, as these types of lamps also cannot be electrically dimmed.\nOver the last six years, LED-based luminaires of all varieties and types have been introduced to the market. Some of these fixtures have become very popular, whereas others have not been able to match the output from incandescent and discharge sources that lighting designers prefer. LED fixtures are making a positive impact on the lighting market, and are becoming more popular when compared to the energy usage of current incandescent, halogen, and discharge sources.\nMost instruments are suspended or supported by a U-shaped \"yoke\", or 'trunnion arm' fixed to the sides of the instrument, normally near its center of gravity. On the end of such, a clamp (known as a hook-clamp, C-clamp, or pipe clamp\u2014pipe referring to battens) is normally fixed, made in a \"C\" configuration with a screw to lock the instrument onto the pipe or batten from which it is typically hung. Once secured, the fixture can be panned and tilted using tension adjustment knobs on the yoke and clamp. An adjustable c-wrench, ratchet (US) or spanner (UK) is often used to assist the technician in adjusting the fixture.\nMost venues require an additional metal safety cable or chain to be attached between the fixture and its truss, or other string support anchorage. Some larger fixtures can weigh over and are suspended very high above performers heads, and could cause serious injury or death if they fell by accident or due to incorrect attachment. In the event of failure, the cable would halt the fall of the fixture before it could cause serious damage or injury. Many venues place strict guidelines regarding the use of safety cables.\nThe entire lighting apparatus includes the lights themselves, the physical structure which supports them, the cabling, control systems, dimmers, power supplies, and the light boards. (lighting console)\nHanging the lights or hanging the battons to hang the lights is known as 'rigging'.\nTypes of lighting fixture.\nAll lights are loosely classified as either \"floodlights\" (wash lights) or \"spotlights\". The distinction has to do with the degree to which one is able to control the shape and quality of the light produced by the instrument, with spotlights being controllable, sometimes to an extremely precise degree, and floodlights being completely uncontrollable. Instruments that fall somewhere in the middle of the spectrum can be classified as either a spot or a flood, depending on the type of instrument and how it is used. In general, spotlights have lenses while floodlights are lensless, although this is not always the case.\nWithin the groups of \"wash\" and \"spot\" light, there are other, more specific types of fixtures. This nomenclature also changes across the world depending on location and industry.\nTraditionally theatre and stage lighting has been of the \"generic\" type. These are lights which are focussed, geled, and then simply dimmed to give the effect the designer wants. In recent years the emergence of moving lights (or automated lights) has had a substantial impact of theatre and stage lighting.\nA typical moving light allows the designer to control the position, color, shape, size and strobing of the light beam created. This can be used for exciting effects for the entertainment or dancefloor use. Moving lights are also often used instead of having a large number of \"generic\" lights. This is because one moving light can do the work of several generics.\nIn Australia and many other places, the lamps inside a theatrical fixture are referred to as \"bubbles\". In North American English, a bubble refers to the protrusion that occurs when one's body (or other oily substance) contacts the lamp. Heat will cause the portion of the lamp which has oil on it to expand when it is on creating the bubble, and causing the lamp to explode. That is why one should never directly touch the glass portion of a lamp. Cleaning with rubbing alcohol will remove the oil.\nLighting controls.\nLighting control tools might best be described as anything that changes the quality of the light. Historically this has been done by the use of intensity control. Technological advancements have made intensity control relatively simple - solid state dimmers are controlled by one or more lighting controllers. Controllers are commonly lighting consoles designed for sophisticated control over very large numbers of dimmers or luminaires, but may be simpler devices which play back stored sequences of lighting states with minimal user interfaces. Consoles are also referred to as lighting desks or light-boards.95, 97, 100\u2013102\nFor larger shows or installations, multiple consoles are sometimes used together and in some cases lighting controllers are combined or coordinated with controllers for sound, automated scenery, pyrotechnics and other effects to provide total automation of the entire show, using a specific branch of MIDI technology called MSC (MIDI show control). See show control.\nThe lighting controller is connected to the dimmers (or directly to automated luminaires) using a control cable or wireless link (e.g. DMX512) or network, allowing the dimmers which are bulky, hot and sometimes noisy, to be positioned away from the stage and audience and allowing automated luminaires to be positioned wherever necessary. In addition to DMX512, newer control connections include RDM (remote device management) which adds management and status feedback capabilities to devices which use it while maintaining compatibility with DMX512; and Architecture for Control Networks (ACN) which is a fully featured multiple controller networking protocol. These allow the possibility of feedback of position, state or fault conditions from units, whilst allowing much more detailed control of them.96\nDimming.\nA dimmer is a device used to vary the average voltage applied to an instrument's lamp. The brightness of a lamp depends on its electric current, which in turn depends on the applied lamp voltage. When the applied voltage is decreased, a lamp's electric current will also decrease, thus reducing the light output from the lamp (dimming it). Conversely, a higher voltage will cause higher lamp current and increased (brighter) light output. Dimmers are frequently found in large enclosures called \"racks\" or \"dimmer racks\" that draw significant three-phase power. They are often removable modules that range from 20-ampere, 2.4-kilowatt to 100-ampere units.\nIn the case of incandescent lamps, some color changes occur as a lamp is dimmed, allowing for a limited amount of color control through a dimmer. Fades (brightness transitions) can be either UP or DOWN, meaning that the light output is increasing or decreasing during the transition. Most modern dimmers are solid state, though many mechanical dimmers are still in operation.89\nIn many cases, a dimmer can be replaced by a \"constant power module\" (CPM), which is typically a 20- or 50-ampere breaker in a dimming module casing. CPMs are used to supply line voltage to non-dimming electrical devices such as smoke machines, chain winches, and scenic motors that require constant operating voltage. When a device is powered by a CPM, it is fully energized whenever the CPM is turned on, independent of lighting console levels. CPMs must be used (in lieu of dimmers) to power non-dimming devices that require specific line voltages (e.g. in the US, 120 V, 60\u00a0Hz power)92 in order to avoid damage to such devices. Dimmers are seldom used to control non-dimming devices because even if a dimmer channel is trusted to always operate at full power, it may not be controlled when communications are disrupted by start up and shut down of the lighting control surface, noise interference, or DMX disconnects or failure. Such a loss of control might cause a dimmer to dim a circuit and thus potentially damage its non-dimming device.\nDevices like moving heads also require independent power, as they cannot function on a partially dimmed channel for power, on top of requiring several other channels in order to convey all of the data they require for their several features. In order to simplify the control of moving head lanterns, instead of assigning channels manually to the lantern, many desks also offer a fixtures section, where one can assign the lantern as a fixture, allowing the desk to organise the data being transferred to the lantern on a much simpler scale for the operator. Fixtures may also incorporate smoke machines, snow machines, haze machines etc., allowing many special effects to be run from a single desk.\nIncreasingly, modern lighting instruments are available which allow remote control of effects other than light intensity, including direction, color, beam shape, projected image, and beam angle. The ability to move an instrument ever more quickly and quietly is an industry goal. Some automated lights have built-in dimming and so are connected directly to the control cable or network and are independent of external dimmers.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They were led by Cretan Greek Minos Kalokairinos, a native of Heraklion. Three weeks later Ottoman authorities forced him to stop (at the time, Crete was under Ottoman rule). Almost three decades later, Evans heard of Kalokairinos' discovery. With private funding, he bought the surrounding rural area including the palace land. Evans began his own excavations in 1900. \nBased on the structures and artefacts found there and throughout the eastern Mediterranean, Evans found that he needed to distinguish the Minoan civilisation from Mycenaean Greece. Evans was also the first to define the Cretan scripts Linear A and Linear B, as well as an earlier pictographic writing.\nBiographical background.\nFamily.\nArthur Evans was born in Nash Mills, Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, England, the first child of John Evans (1823\u20131908) and Harriet Ann Dickinson (born 1824), the daughter of John's employer and maternal uncle, John Dickinson (1782\u20131869), the founder of Messrs John Dickinson, a paper mill business. Arthur Evans' grandfather, Arthur Benoni Evans, had been headmaster of Dixie Grammar School at Market Bosworth, Leicestershire. John knew Latin and could quote the classical authors.\nIn 1840 John Evans started work in the mill owned by his maternal uncle, John Dickinson. He married his first cousin, Harriet, in 1850, and in 1851 became a junior partner in the family business. Profits from the mill would help fund Arthur Evans's excavations, restorations at Knossos, and resulting publications. For the time being they were an unpretentious and affectionate family. They moved into a brick terraced house built for the purpose near the mill, which came to be called the \"red house\" because it lacked the sooty patina of the other houses. Harriet called her husband \"Jack.\" Grandmother Evans called Arthur Evans \"darling Trot,\" asserting in a note that, compared to his father, he was \"a bit of a dunce.\" In 1856, with Harriet's declining health and Jack's growing reputation and prosperity, they moved into Harriet's childhood home, a mansion with a garden, where the children ran free.\nJohn Evans maintained his status as an officer in the company, which eventually became John Dickinson Stationery, but also became distinguished for his pursuits in numismatics, geology, and archaeology. His interest in geology came from an assignment by the company to study the diminishing water resources in the area with a view toward protecting the company from lawsuits. The mill consumed large amounts of water, which was also needed for the canals. He became an expert and a legal consultant.\nJohn became a distinguished antiquary, publishing numerous books and articles. In 1859, he conducted a geological survey of the Somme Valley with Joseph Prestwich. His connections and invaluable advice were indispensable to Arthur Evans's career throughout the remainder of his long life.\nArthur Evans's mother, Harriet, died after childbirth in 1858 when he was seven. He had two brothers, Lewis (1853) and Philip Norman (1854), and two sisters, Harriet (1857) and Alice (1858). He would remain on excellent terms with all of them all of his life. He was raised by a stepmother, Fanny (Frances), n\u00e9e Phelps, with whom he also got along very well. She had no children of her own and also predeceased her husband. John's third wife was a classical scholar, Maria Millington Lathbury. When he was 70, they had a daughter, Joan, who became an art historian. John Evans died in 1908 at 85, when Arthur Evans was 57. His close support and assistance was indispensable in excavating and conceptualising Minoan civilisation.\nEducation.\nHarrow.\nAfter a preparatory school, he entered Harrow School in 1865 at the age of 14. He was co-editor of \"The Harrovian\" in his final year, 1869/70. At Harrow he was friends with Francis Maitland Balfour. They competed for the Natural History Prize; the outcome was a draw. They were both highly athletic, including riding and swimming, and also mountain climbing, during which activity Balfour was killed later in life. Evans was near-sighted, but refused to wear glasses. His close-up vision was better than normal, enabling him to see detail missed by others. Farther away his field of vision was blurry and he compensated by carrying a cane, which he called Prodger, to explore the environment. His wit was very sharp, too sharp for the administration, which stopped a periodical he had started, \"The Pen-Viper\", after the first issue.\nOxford.\nArthur matriculated on 9 June 1870 and attended Brasenose College, Oxford. His housemaster at Harrow, F. Rendall, had eased the way to his acceptance with the recommendation that he was \"a boy of powerful original mind.\" At Brasenose College, he read Modern History, a new curriculum, which was nearly a disaster, as his main interests were in archaeology and classical studies.\nHis summertime activities with his brothers and friends were perhaps more important to his subsequent career. Having been given an ample allowance by his father, he went looking for adventure on the continent, seeking out circumstances that might be considered dangerous by some. In June 1871, he and Lewis visited Hallstatt, where his father had excavated in 1866, adding some of the artefacts to his collection. Arthur Evans had made himself familiar with these. Subsequently, they went on to Paris and then to Amiens. The Franco-Prussian War had just concluded the month before. Arthur Evans had been told at the French border to remove the dark cape he was wearing so that he would not be shot for a spy. Amiens was occupied by the Prussian army. Arthur found them prosaic and preoccupied with souvenir-hunting. He and Lewis hunted for stone-age artefacts in the gravel quarries, Arthur Evans remarking that he was glad the Prussians were not interested in flint artefacts.\nIn 1872, he and Norman adventured into Ottoman territory in the Carpathians, already in a state of political tension. They crossed borders illegally at high altitudes, \"revolvers at the ready.\" This was Arthur Evans's first encounter with Turkish people and customs. He bought a set of clothes of a wealthy Turkish man, complete with red fez, baggy trousers, and an embroidered short-sleeved tunic. His detailed, enthusiastic account was published in \"Fraser's Magazine\" in May 1873.\nIn 1873, he and Balfour tramped over Lapland, Finland, and Sweden. Everywhere he went he took copious anthropological notes and made numerous drawings of the people, places and artefacts. During the Christmas holidays of 1873, Evans catalogued a coin collection being bequeathed to Harrow by John Gardner Wilkinson, the father of British Egyptology, who was too ill to work on it himself. The headmaster had suggested \"my old pupil, Arthur John Evans \u2013 a remarkably able young man.\"\nArthur John Evans graduated from Oxford at the age of 24 in 1874, but his career had come near to foundering during the final examinations on modern history. Despite his extensive knowledge of ancient history, classics, archaeology, and what would be termed today cultural anthropology, he apparently had not even read enough in his nominal subject to pass the required examination. He could answer no questions on topics later than the 12th century. He had convinced one of his examiners, Edward Augustus Freeman, of his talent. They were both published authors, they were both Gladstone liberals, and they were both interested in the Herzegovina uprising (1875\u20131877) and on the side of Old Herzegovina insurgents. Freeman convinced Evans's tutors, George Kitchen and John Richard Green, and they convinced the Regius professor, William Stubbs, that, in view of his special other knowledge and interests, and his father's \"high standing in learned society\", Evans should not only be passed, but receive a first-class degree. It was the topic of much jesting; Green wrote to Freeman on 11 November 1875:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"I am very sorry to have missed you, dear Freeman ... Little Evans \u2013 son of John Evans the great \u2013 has just come back from the Herzegovina which he reached by way of Lapland, having started from the Schools in excitement at the 'first' I wrung for him out of the obdurate Stubbs ...\"\nIn the spring of 1875 he applied for the Archaeological Travelling Studentship offered by Oxford, but, as he says in a letter to Freeman later in life, he was turned down thanks to the efforts of Benjamin Jowett and Charles Thomas Newton, two Oxford dons having a low opinion of his work there.\nG\u00f6ttingen.\nIn April\u2013July of 1875 he attended a summer term at the University of G\u00f6ttingen at the suggestion of Henry Montagu Butler, then headmaster at Harrow. Evans was to study with Reinhold Pauli, who had spent some years in Britain, and was a friend of Green. The study would be preparatory to doing research in modern history at G\u00f6ttingen. The arrangement may have been meant as a remedial plan. On the way to G\u00f6ttingen, Evans was sidetracked, unpropitiously for the modern history plan, by some illegal excavations at Trier. He had noticed that the tombs were being plundered surreptitiously. For the sake of preserving some artefacts, he hired a crew, performed such hasty excavations as he could, crated the material and sent it home to John.\nG\u00f6ttingen was not to Evans's liking. His quarters were stuffy, and the topics were of little interest to him, as he had already demonstrated. His letters speak mainly of the discrepancy between the poor peasants of the countryside and the institution of the wealthy in the town. His thinking was of a revolutionary bent. Deciding not to stay, he left there to meet Lewis for another trip to Old Herzegovina. That decision marked the end of his formal education. Herzegovina was then in a state of insurrection. The Ottomans were using bashi-bazouks to try to quell it. Despite subsequent events, there is no evidence that the young Evans might have had ulterior motives at this time, despite the fact that Butler had helped to educate half the government of the United Kingdom. He was simply an adventurous young man bored with poring through books in a career into which he had been pushed against his real interests. The real adventure, in his mind, was the revolution in the Balkans.\nCareer.\nAgent in the Balkans.\nAfter resolving to leave G\u00f6ttingen, Evans and Lewis planned to spy against the Principality of Montenegro in the rebellious mountain village of Bobovo, Pljevlja at the time of their journey the strongest point of resistance in triple mountain ranges of Ljubi\u0161nja and Tara gorges. During the struggle in Bobovo on 15 August 1875 during the Herzegovina uprising (1875\u20131877) they were expelled from Province of Pljevlja by the Ottoman authorities and went to board a ship in the city of Dubrovnik via Pljevlja, a city with a large settlement from the Roman period, which Evans named as the Municipium S. \nThey knew that the region, a part of the Ottoman Empire, was under martial law and that the Christians were in a state of insurrection against the Muslim beys placed over them. Some Ottoman troops were in the country in support of the beys, but mainly the beys were using irregular forces, the bashi-bazouks, loosely attached to the Ottoman military. Their notorious cruelty, which they practised against the natives, helped to turn the British Empire under W. E. Gladstone against the Ottoman Empire, as well as to attract Russian intervention at Serbian request. At the time of Evans' and Lewis' initial adventure, the Ottomans were still trying to lessen the threat of intervention by placating their neighbours. Evans sought and obtained permission to travel in Bosnia from its Ottoman military governor.\nThe two brothers experienced little difficulty with either the Serbs or the Ottomans but they did provoke the neighbouring Austro-Hungarian Empire and spent a night in \"a wretched cell\". After deciding to lodge in a good hotel in Slavonski Brod on the border, having judged it safer than Bosanski Brod across the Sava River, they were observed by an officer who saw their sketches and concluded they might be Russian spies. Politely invited by two other officers to join the police chief and produce passports, Evans replied, \"Tell him that we are Englishmen and are not accustomed to being treated in this way\". The officers insisted and, interrupting the chief at dinner, Evans suggested he should have come to the hotel in person to request the passports. The chief, in a somewhat less than civil manner, won the argument about whether he had the right to check the passports of Englishmen by inviting them to spend the night in a cell.\nOn the way to the holding cell the two young men were followed by a large crowd, whom Evans lost no opportunity to harangue, even though they understood only German. He threatened the authorities in the name of the British fleet, which, he asserted, would sail up the Sava river. He demanded the mayor, offered the jailer a bribe for food and water, but went into the cell unfed and without water. Meanwhile, the incident came to attention of Dr Makanetz, leader of the National Party of the Croatian Assembly, who happened to be in Brod. The next day he complained to the mayor. Evans and his brother were released with profuse apologies.\nThey crossed the Sava into Bosnia, which Evans found so different that he regarded the Sava as the border between Europe and Asia. After a number of interviews with Ottoman officials who attempted to dissuade them from travel on foot, the passport from the pasha prevailed. They were given an escort \u2013 one man, enough to establish authority \u2013 as far as Derventa. From there they travelled directly south to Sarajevo and from there to Dubrovnik (Ragusa) on the coast, in Dalmatia. In Sarajevo they learned that the region through which they had just passed was now \"plunged in civil war\".\nReporter for \"The Manchester Guardian\".\nHome again, Evans wrote of his experiences, working from his extensive notes and drawings, publishing \"https://\", which came out in two editions, 1876 and 1877. He became overnight an expert in Balkan affairs. \"The Manchester Guardian\" hired him as a correspondent, sending him back to the Balkans in 1877. He reported on the suppression of the Christian insurrectionists by the military of the Ottoman Empire, and yet was treated by the Ottomans as though he were an ambassador, despite his anti-Turkish sentiments. His older interests in antiquities continued. He collected portable artefacts, especially seal stones, at every opportunity, between sending back article after article to \"The Guardian\". He also visited the Freemans in Sarajevo whenever he could. A relationship with Freeman's eldest daughter, Margaret, had begun to blossom. In 1878 the Russians compelled a settlement of the conflict on appeal by the Serbs. The Ottomans ceded Bosnia and Herzegovina to the Austro-Hungarian Empire as a protectorate.\nIn 1878, Evans proposed to Margaret Freeman, three years his senior, an educated and literate woman, and until now secretary for her father. The offer was accepted, to everyone's great satisfaction. Freeman spoke affectionately of his future son-in-law. The couple were married near the Freeman home in Wookey, Somerset, at the parish church. They took up residence in a Venetian villa Evans had purchased in Ragusa, Casa San Lazzaro, on the bluffs overlooking the Adriatic. One of their first tasks was to create a garden there. They lived happily, Evans pursuing his journalistic career, until 1882.\nEvans's continued stance in favour of native government led to a condition of unacceptability to the local regime within the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He did not see Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina as an improvement over Ottoman. He wrote: \"The people are treated not as a liberated but as a conquered and inferior race...\" The Evans's sentiments were followed by acts of personal charity: they took in an orphan, invited a blind woman to dinner every night. Finally Evans wrote some public letters in favour of an insurrection.\nEvans was arrested in 1882, to be put on trial as a British \"agent provocateur\" stirring up further insurrection. His journalistic sources were not acceptable friendships to the authorities. He spent six weeks in prison awaiting trial, but at the trial nothing definitive could be proved. His wife was interrogated. She found most offensive the reading of her love letters before her eyes by a hostile police agent. Evans was expelled from the country. Gladstone had been apprised of the situation immediately, but, as far as the public knew, did nothing. The government in Vienna similarly disavowed any knowledge of or connection to the actions of the local authorities. The Evans returned home to rent a house in Oxford, abandoning their villa, which became a hotel. However, Evans's reputation among the Slavs assumed unassailable proportions. He was invited later to play a role in the formation of the pre-Yugoslav state. In 1941 the government of Yugoslavia sent representatives to his funeral.\nDuring Gascoyne-Cecil's first tenure as Prime Minister from 1885 to 1886, the English public held negative views of the Kingdom of Serbia and instead supported the Kingdom of Bulgaria. A \"Times\" correspondent said Serbia was the biggest threat to peace in the Balkans. This view was refuted by Evans, who stated that Serbs in Kosovo and Metohija were facing terror from the hand of local Albanian population, with murders being a daily occurrence.\nKeeper of the Ashmolean Museum.\nEvans and his wife moved back to Oxford, renting a house there in January 1883. This period of unemployment was the only one of his life; he employed himself finishing up his Balkan studies. He completed his articles on Roman roads and cities there. It was suggested that he apply to a new professorship of Classical Archaeology at Oxford. When he found out that Jowett and Newton were among the electors, he decided not to apply. He wrote to Freeman that to confine archaeology to classics was an absurdity. Instead he and Margaret travelled to Greece, seeking out Heinrich Schliemann at Athens. Margaret and Sophia had a visit for several hours, during which Evans examined the Mycenaean antiquities at hand with Heinrich.\nMeanwhile, the Ashmolean Museum, an adjunct of Oxford University, was in a chaotic state of transition. It had been a natural history museum, but the collections had been transferred to other museums. The lower floor housed some art and archaeology, but the upper floor was being used for university functions. John Henry Parker, appointed the first keeper in 1870, had the task of trying to manage it. His efforts to negotiate with the art collector Charles Drury Edward Fortnum, over housing his extensive collection, were being undercut by university administrators. In January 1884, Parker died. The museum was in the hands of its assistant keepers, one of whom, Edward Evans (no relation), was to be Arthur Evans' executive during Evans' extended absences.\nThe strategy for the museum now was to convert it to an art and archaeology museum, expanding the remaining collections. In November 1883, Fortnum wrote to Evans asking for his assistance in locating some letters in the Bodleian Library that would help to validate a noted ring in his collection; he did so on the advice of John Evans of the Society of Antiquaries. Unable to find the letters, Arthur Evans suggested Fortnum visit Oxford. Fortnum in fact was becoming dissatisfied with rivals for his collection, the South Kensington Museum, because of their \"lack of a properly informed and competent person as keeper.\" Evans had the right qualifications and took the position of keeper at the Ashmolean when it was offered.\nIn 1884, therefore, Evans, at the age of 34, was appointed Keeper of the Ashmolean Museum. He held a grand inauguration at which he outlined his planned changes, publishing it as \"The Ashmolean as a Home of Archaeology in Oxford\". Already the great frontage building had been erected. Evans took it in the direction of being an archaeology museum. He insisted the artefacts be transferred back to the museum, negotiated for and succeeded in acquiring Fortnum's collections, later gave his father's collections to the museum, and finally, bequeathed his own Minoan collections, not without the intended effect. Today it has the finest Minoan assemblages outside Crete. Evans gave the Ilchester Lectures for 1884 on the Slavonic conquest of Illyricum, which remained unpublished.\nArchaeologist.\nExcavations at Aylesford.\nA cemetery of the British Iron Age discovered in 1886 at Aylesford in Kent was excavated under the leadership of Evans, and published in 1890. With the later excavation by others at Swarling not far away (discovery to publication was 1921\u20131925) this is the type site for Aylesford-Swarling pottery or the Aylesford-Swarling culture, which included the first wheel-made pottery in Britain. Evans's conclusion that the site belonged to a culture closely related to the continental Belgae, remains the modern view, though the dating has been refined to the period after about 75 BC. His analysis of the site was still regarded as \"an outstanding contribution to Iron Age studies\" with \"a masterly consideration of the metalwork\" by Sir Barry Cunliffe in 2012.\nEnd and beginning.\nIn 1893, Evans's way of life as a married, middling archaeologist, puttering around the Ashmolean, and travelling extensively and perpetually on holiday with his beloved Margaret, came to an abrupt end, leaving emotional devastation in its wake and changing the course of his life. Freeman died in March 1892. Always of precarious health, he had heard that Spain had a salubrious climate. Travelling there to test the hypothesis and perhaps improve his physical condition, he contracted smallpox and was gone in a few days. His oldest daughter did not survive him long. Always of precarious health herself \u2013 she is said to have had tuberculosis \u2013 she was too weak to prepare her father's papers for publication, so she delegated the task to a family friend, Reverend William Stephens.\nIn October of that year Evans took her to visit Boar's Hill, near Oxford. He wanted to buy 60 acres to build a home for Margaret on the hill. She approved the location, so he convinced his father to put up the money. Then he had the tops of the pines cut, eight feet from the ground, on which he had built a platform and a log cabin to serve as a temporary quarters while the mansion was being built. His intent was to keep her from the cold, damp ground. Apparently she never lived there. They were away again for the winter, Margaret to winter with her sister in Bordighera, Evans to Sicily to complete the last volume of the history he and Freeman had begun together.\nIn February, Evans met John Myres, a student at the British School, in Athens. The two shopped the flea markets looking for antiquities. Evans purchased some seal stones inscribed with a mysterious writing, said to have come from Crete. Then he met Margaret in Bordighera. The two started back to Athens, but en route, in Alassio, Italy she was overtaken by a severe attack. On 11 March 1893, after experiencing painful spasms for two hours, she died with Evans holding her hand, of an unknown disease, perhaps tuberculosis, although the symptoms fit a heart attack also. He was 42; she, 45.\nMargaret was buried in the English cemetery at Alassio. Her epitaph says, in part, \"Her bright, energetic spirit, undaunted by suffering to the last, and ever working for the welfare of those around her, made a short life long.\" Evans placed on the grave a wreath he wove himself of ox-eye daisies (also known as marguerites) and wild broom, expressive of their innermost feelings, commemorating the event with a private poem, \"To Margaret my beloved wife\", not published until after his death decades later:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;:\"Of Margarites and mountain heath\nAnd scented broom so white \u2013\nSuch as herself she plucked, \u2013 a wreath\nI wreathe for her tonight.\nFor she was open as the air\nPure as the blue of heaven\nAnd truer love \u2013 or pearl so rare\nTo man was never given.\"\nTo his father he wrote: \"I do not think anyone can ever know what Margaret has been to me.\" He never married again. For the rest of his life he wrote on black-bordered stationery. He went ahead with the mansion he had planned to build for Margaret on Boars Hill in Berkshire (now Oxfordshire), against the advice of his father, who regarded it as wasteful and useless. He called it Youlbury, after the name of the locality.\nWaiting for the future.\nAfter Margaret's death Evans wandered aimlessly around Liguria ostensibly looking at Terramare Culture sites and for Neolithic remains in Ligurian caves. Then he revisited the locations of his youthful explorations in Zagreb. Finally he returned to live a hermit-like existence in the cabin he had built for her. The Ashmolean no longer interested him. He complained to Fortnum in a late, childish display of sibling rivalry, that his father had had another child, his half-sister Joan. After a year of grief the mounting tension in Crete began to attract his interest. Knossos was now known to be a major site, thanks to Evans's old friend and fellow journalist in Bosnia, William James Stillman. Another old friend, Federico Halbherr, the Italian archaeologist and future excavator of Phaistos, was keeping him posted on developments at Knossos by mail.\nArchaeologists from Britain, France, Germany, Italy and the United States were in attendance at the site watching the progress, so to speak, of the \"sick man of Europe\", a metaphor of the dying Ottoman Empire. The various pashas, eager not to offend the native Cretan parliament, were encouraging foreigners to apply for a firman to excavate, and then not granting any. The Cretans were afraid of the Ottomans' removing any artefacts to Istanbul. The Ottoman method of stalling was to require any would-be excavators to buy the site from its native owners first. The owners in turn were coached to charge so much money that none would think it worthwhile to apply in such uncertain circumstances. Even the wealthy Schliemann had given up on the price in 1890 and had gone home to die in that year.\nIn 1894, Evans became intrigued by the idea that the script engraved on the seal stones he had purchased before Margaret's death might be Cretan, and steamed off to Heraklion to join the circle of watchers. During his year of tending to the details of Youlbury, administering the Ashmolean, and writing some minor papers, he had also discovered the script on some other jewellery that came to the museum from Myres in Crete. He announced that he had concluded to a Mycenaean hieroglyphic script of about 60 characters. Shortly he wrote to his friend and patron at the Ashmolean, Charles Fortnum, that he was \"very restless\" and must go to Crete.\nArriving in Heraklion he did not join his friends immediately, but took the opportunity to examine the excavations at Knossos. Seeing the sign of the double axe almost immediately he knew that he was at the home of the script. He used the Cretan Exploration Fund, devised on the model of the Palestine Exploration Fund, to acquire the site. The owners would not sell to individuals, who could not afford it, but they would sell to a fund. Apparently Evans did not bother to explain that he was the only contributor. He bought 1/4 of the site with first option to buy the rest later. The firman was still in deficit. Politics in Crete were taking a violent turn however. Anything might happen. Evans returned to London to wind up his affairs there and make sure the Ashmolean had suitable direction in the event of his further absence.\nReligious violence in Crete.\nIn 1898, he became one of the first reporters of the ethnic cleansing of Turkish Cretans by Greek forces. In September 1898, the last of the Turkish troops withdrew from Crete. Their withdrawal did not however presage peace, and religious violence against the Muslim minority ensued. The British Army forbade travel for any reason with checkpoints set up to enforce this. Despite this Evans, Myres and Hogarth returned to Crete together, Evans in his capacity as a journalist for the \"Manchester Guardian\". He took a combative stance in his journalism, criticising the Ottoman Empire for its 'corruption' and the British empire for 'collaborating with the Ottomans.' Many officials of that empire had been Greek. Now they were working with the British to build a Cretan government. Evans accused these officials of being part of \"the Turco-British regime\". He deplored religiously motivated violence, be it from Muslims or Christians. His critical journalism caused friction with the local administration, and he was forced to call on friends higher up in the government to avoid problems.\nEvans travelled widely in his reporting. He saw that the Muslim population was now on the decline, some being massacred, and some abandoning the island. One of the episodes he reported on was a massacre at Ete\u00e0. The Muslim villagers had been attacked by Christians in the night. They sought refuge in a mosque. The next day they were promised clemency if they would disarm themselves. Handing over their weapons, they were lined up, having been told they were to be re-settled. Instead, they were shot, the only survivor being a small girl who had a cape thrown over her to conceal her. In his report to \"The Manchester Guardian\" in 1898, he described this ethnic cleansing of Cretan Muslim civilians by saying:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPrince George was keen to avoid such massacres, and establish a functioning government on the island. In 1899 a cross-confessional government was established as part of a republican Crete.\nExcavations of Knossos.\nNow that the restriction of the Ottoman firman was removed, there was a great rush on the part of all the other archaeologists to obtain first permission to dig from the new Cretan government. They soon found that Evans had a monopoly. Using the Cretan Exploration Fund, now being swollen by contributions from others, he paid off the debt for the land. Then he ordered stores from Britain. He hired two foremen, and they in turn hired 32 diggers. He started work on the flower-covered hill in March 1900.\nAssisted by Duncan Mackenzie, who had already distinguished himself by his excavations on the island of Melos, and Mr Fyfe, an architect from the British School at Athens, Evans employed a large staff of local labourers as excavators, and began work in 1900. Within a few months they had uncovered a substantial portion of what he called the Palace of Minos. The term \"palace\" may be misleading; Knossos was an intricate collection of over 1,000 interlocking rooms, some of which served as artisans' workrooms and food processing centres (e.g., wine presses). It served as a central storage point, and a religious and administrative centre.\nOn the basis of the ceramic evidence and stratigraphy, Evans concluded that there was another civilisation on Crete that had existed before those brought to light by the adventurer-archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann at Mycenae and Tiryns. The small ruin of Knossos spanned and the palace had a maze-like quality that reminded Evans of the labyrinth described in Greek mythology. In the myth, the labyrinth had been built by King Minos to hide the Minotaur, a half-man half-bull creature that was the offspring of Minos's wife, Pasiphae, and a bull. Evans dubbed the civilisation once inhabiting this great palace the Minoan civilisation.\nBy 1903, most of the palace was excavated, bringing to light an advanced city containing artwork and many examples of writing. Painted on the walls of the palace were numerous scenes depicting bulls, leading Evans to conclude that the Minoans did indeed worship the bull. In 1905 he finished excavations. He then proceeded to have the room called the throne room (due to the throne-like stone chair fixed in the room) repainted by a father\u2013son team of Swiss artists, \u00c9mile Gilli\u00e9ron \"p\u00e8re\" and fils. While Evans based the recreations on archaeological evidence, some of the best-known frescoes from the throne room were almost complete inventions of the Gilli\u00e9rons, according to his critics.\nSenior trustee.\nAll the excavations at Knossos were done on leave of absence from the museum. \"While the Keeper's salary was not generous, the conditions of residence were very liberal ... the keeper could and should travel to secure new acquisitions\". But in 1908 at the age of 57 he resigned his position to concentrate on writing up his Minoan work. In 1912 he refused the opportunity to become president of the Society of Antiquaries, a position which his father had already held. But in 1914 at the age of 63, when he was too old to take part in the War, he took on the presidency of the Antiquaries which carried with it an ex officio appointment as a Trustee of the British Museum and he spent the War successfully fighting the War Office who wanted to commandeer the museum for the Air Board.\nHe thus played a major role in the history of the British Museum as well as in the history of the Ashmolean Museum.\nMajor creative works.\nScripta Minoa.\nDuring excavations by Evans, he found 3,000 clay tablets, which he transcribed and organised, publishing them in \"Scripta Minoa\". As some of them are now missing, the transcriptions are the only source of the marks on the tablets. He perceived that the scripts were two different and mutually exclusive writing systems, which later he termed into Linear A and Linear B. The A script appeared to have preceded the B. Evans dated the Linear B Chariot Tablets, so called from their depictions of chariots, at Knossos to immediately prior to the catastrophic Minoan civilisation collapse of the 15th century BC.\nOne of Evans's theses in the 1901 \"Scripta Minoa\", is that most of the symbols for the Phoenician alphabet (abjad) are almost identical to the many centuries older, 19th century BC, Cretan hieroglyphs.\nThe basic part of the discussion about Phoenician alphabet in \"Scripta Minoa, Vol. 1\" takes place in the section \"Cretan Philistines and the Phoenician Alphabet\". Modern scholars now see it as a continuation of the Proto-Canaanite alphabet from ca. 1400 BC, adapted to writing a Canaanite (Northwest Semitic) language. The Phoenician alphabet seamlessly continues the Proto-Canaanite alphabet, by convention called Phoenician from the mid-11th century, where it is first attested on inscribed bronze arrowheads.\nEvans had no better luck with Linear B, which turned out to be Greek. Despite decades of theories, Linear A has not been convincingly deciphered, nor even the language group identified. His classifications and careful transcriptions have been of great value to Mycenaean scholars.\nHonours.\nEvans was a member and officer of many learned societies, including being elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1901.

Said to have been born on 15 April 1684 (o.s. 5 April), she was originally named Marta Helena Skowro\u0144ska. Marta was the daughter of Samuel Skowro\u0144ski (also spelled \"Samuil Skavronsky\"), a Roman Catholic farmer from the eastern parts of the former Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, his parents were born in the area of Minsk (now Belarus). In 1680, he married Dorothea Hahn at Jakobstadt (now J\u0113kabpils, Latvia). Her mother is named in at least one source as Elizabeth Moritz, a daughter of a Baltic German woman, and there is debate as to whether Moritz's father was a Swedish officer. It is likely that two stories were conflated, and Swedish sources suggest that the Elizabeth Moritz story is probably incorrect. Some biographies state that Marta's father was a gravedigger and handyman, while others speculate that he was a runaway landless serf.\nMarta's parents died during a plague epidemic around 1689, leaving five children. According to one popular version of the story, at the age of three Marta was taken by an aunt and sent to Marienburg, Swedish Livonia (now Al\u016bksne, Latvia) where she was raised by Johann Ernst Gl\u00fcck, a Lutheran pastor and Bible translator. According to some sources, she served in the Gl\u00fcck household as a lowly servant, scullery maid and washerwoman. No effort was made to teach her to read and write and she remained functionally illiterate throughout her life.\nMarta was considered a very beautiful young girl, and there are accounts that Gl\u00fcck's wife became fearful that she would become involved with their son. After the outbreak of the Great Northern War (1700\u20131721), at the age of 17, she was married off to a Swedish dragoon, Johan Cruse or Johann Rabbe, with whom she remained for eight days in 1702, at which point the Swedish troops were withdrawn from Marienburg. When Russian forces captured the town, Pastor Gl\u00fcck offered to work as a translator, and Field Marshal Boris Sheremetev agreed to his proposal and took him to Moscow.\nThere are unsubstantiated stories that Marta worked briefly in the laundry of the victorious regiment, and also that she was presented in her undergarments to Brigadier General Rudolph Felix Bauer to be his mistress. She may have worked in the household of his superior, Sheremetev. She travelled back to the Russian court with Sheremetev's army.\nAfterwards she became part of the household of Alexander Menshikov, who was the best friend of the then Tsar Peter I. Anecdotal sources suggest that she was purchased by Menshikov. Whether the two of them were lovers is disputed, as at the time Count Menshikov was already engaged to his future wife. It is evident however that Menshikov and Marta formed a lifetime political alliance. \nIt is possible that Menshikov, who was quite jealous of the tsar's attentions and knew his tastes, wanted to procure a mistress on whom he could rely. In 1703, while visiting Count Menshikov at his home, Tsar Peter I met Marta. By 1704, she was already well established in the tsar's household as his mistress, and gave birth to a son, Peter. In 1703, she converted to Orthodoxy and took the new name Catherine Alexeyevna (\"Yekaterina Alexeyevna\"). She and Darya Menshikova accompanied Tsar Peter I and Prince Menshikov on their military excursions.\nEmpress consort.\nThough no record exists, Catherine and Peter are described as having married secretly between 23 October and 1 December 1707 in Saint Petersburg. They had twelve children, two of whom survived into adulthood, Anna (born 1708) and Elizabeth (born 1709).\nTsar Peter I had moved the capital to Saint Petersburg in 1703. While the city was being built he lived in a modest three-room log cabin (with a study but without a fire-place) with Catherine. The relationship was the most successful of the tsar's life and a great number of letters exist demonstrating the strong affection between Catherine and Peter I. As a person she was very energetic, compassionate, charming, and always cheerful. She was able to calm the tsar in his frequent rages and was often called in to do so.\nCatherine went with Tsar Peter I on his Pruth Campaign in 1711. There, she was said to have saved Peter and his future empire, as related by Voltaire in his book \"Peter the Great\". Surrounded by overwhelming numbers of Turkish troops, Catherine suggested before surrendering, that her jewels and those of the other women be used in an effort to bribe the Ottoman grand vizier Baltac\u0131 Mehmet Pasha into allowing a retreat.\nMehmet allowed the retreat, whether motivated by the bribe or considerations of trade and diplomacy. In any case, Tsar Peter I credited Catherine and proceeded to marry her again, this time officially, at Saint Isaac's Cathedral in Saint Petersburg on 9 February 1712. She was the second wife of Tsar Peter I; he had previously married and divorced Eudoxia Lopukhina, who had borne him the Tsarevich (heir apparent), Alexis Petrovich. Upon their wedding, Catherine took on the style of her husband and became Tsarina. The Order of Saint Catherine was instituted by her husband on the occasion. \nTheir small wooden palace in Strelna, designed around 1714, had a botanical garden. In 1716, she accompanied him to his second embassy to the United Provinces but stayed behind at Wesel to give birth. He did not take her to Paris; she stayed in Haarlemmerhout in the mansion of the Russian resident Osip Solovjov. In 1724, Peter had Catherine crowned as Empress, although he remained Russia's actual ruler.\nEmpress Regnant.\nCatherine was crowned in 1724. The year before his death, Emperor Peter the Great and Empress Catherine had an estrangement over her support of Willem Mons, brother of Peter's former mistress Anna, and brother to one of the current ladies in waiting for Catherine, Matryona. He served as Catherine's secretary. Peter I had fought long to clear up corruption in Russia. Catherine had a great deal of influence over who could gain access to her husband. Willem Mons and his sister Matryona had begun selling their influence to those who wanted access to Catherine and, through her, to Peter. Apparently this had been overlooked by Catherine, who was fond of both. Peter found out and had Willem Mons executed and his sister Matryona exiled. He and Catherine did not speak for several months. Rumors flew that she and Mons had had an affair, but there is no evidence for this.\nEmperor Peter the Great died (28 January 1725 Old Style) without naming a successor. Catherine represented the interests of the \"new men\", commoners who had been brought to positions of great power by Peter based on competence. A change of government was likely to favor the entrenched aristocrats. For that reason during a meeting of a council to decide on a successor, a coup was arranged by Menshikov and others in which the guards regiments with whom Catherine was very popular proclaimed her the ruler of Russia. Supporting evidence was \"produced\" from Peter's secretary Makarov and the Bishop of Pskov, both \"new men\" with motivation to see Catherine take over. The real power, however, lay with Menshikov, Peter Tolstoy, and other members of the Supreme Privy Council. \nCatherine viewed the deposed empress Eudoxia as a threat, so she secretly moved her to Shlisselburg Fortress near Saint Petersburg to be put in a secret prison under strict custody as a state prisoner.\nDeath.\nCatherine I died two years after Peter I, on 17 May 1727 at age 43, in Saint Petersburg, where she was buried at St. Peter and St. Paul Fortress. Tuberculosis, diagnosed as an abscess of the lungs, caused her early demise.\nBefore her death she recognized Peter II, the grandson of Peter I and Eudoxia, as her successor.\nAssessment and legacy.\nCatherine was the first woman to rule Imperial Russia, opening the legal path for a century almost entirely dominated by women, including her daughter Elizabeth and granddaughter-in-law Catherine the Great, all of whom continued Peter the Great's policies in modernizing Russia. At the time of Peter's death the Russian Army, composed of 130,000 men and supplemented by another 100,000 Cossacks, was easily the largest in Europe. However, the expense of the military was proving ruinous to the Russian economy, consuming some 65% of the government's annual revenue. Since the nation was at peace, Catherine was determined to reduce military expenditure. For most of her reign, Catherine I was controlled by her advisers. However, on this single issue, the reduction of military expenses, Catherine was able to have her way. The resulting tax relief on the peasantry led to the reputation of Catherine I as a just and fair ruler.\nThe Supreme Privy Council concentrated power in the hands of one party, and thus was an executive innovation. In foreign affairs, Russia reluctantly joined the Austro-Spanish league to defend the interests of Catherine's son-in-law, the Duke of Holstein, against Great Britain.\nCatherine gave her name to Catherinehof near Saint Petersburg, and built the first bridges in the new capital. She was also the first royal owner of the Tsarskoye Selo estate, where the Catherine Palace still bears her name.\nThe city of Yekaterinburg is named after her, Yekaterina being the Russian form of her name.\nShe also gave her name to Kadriorg Palace (German: \"Katharinental\", meaning \"Catherine's Valley\"), its adjacent Kadriorg Park and the later Kadriorg neighbourhood in Tallinn, Estonia. \nIn general, Catherine's policies were reasonable and cautious. The story of her humble origins was considered by later generations of tsars to be a state secret.\nIssue.\nCatherine and Peter had twelve children, all of whom died in childhood except Anna and Elizabeth:\nSiblings.\nUpon Peter's death, Catherine found her four siblings, Krystyna, Anna, Karol, and Fryderyk, granted them the newly created titles of Count and Countess, and brought them to Russia.\nIn popular culture.\nCatherine I is the main character of the novel \"Peter's Empress\" by Kristina Sabaliauskait\u0117.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She came to power after a coup d'etat against her husband, Peter III. Her long reign helped Russia thrive under a golden age under the Enlightenment. This renaissance led to the founding of many new cities, universities, and theatres, along with large-scale immigration from the rest of Europe and the recognition of Russia as one of the great powers of Europe.\nAfter overthrowing and possibly assassinating her husband and her subsequent rule of the Russian Empire, Catherine often relied on noble favourites such as Count Grigory Orlov and Grigory Potemkin. Assisted by highly successful generals such as Alexander Suvorov and Pyotr Rumyantsev and admirals such as Samuel Greig and Fyodor Ushakov, she governed at a time when the Russian Empire was expanding rapidly by conquest and diplomacy. In the west, she installed her former lover to the throne of Poland, which was eventually partitioned. In the south, the Crimean Khanate was annexed following victories over the Bar Confederation and the Ottoman Empire in the Russo-Turkish War. With the support of Great Britain, Russia colonised the territories of New Russia along the coasts of the Black and Azov Seas. In the east, Russians became the first Europeans to colonise Alaska, establishing Russian America.\nMany cities and towns were founded on Catherine's orders in the newly conquered lands, most notably Yekaterinoslav, Kherson, Nikolayev, and Sevastopol. An admirer of Peter the Great, Catherine continued to modernise Russia along Western European culture. However, military conscription and the economy continued to depend on serfdom, and the increasing demands of the state and of private landowners intensified the exploitation of serf labour. This was one of the chief reasons behind rebellions, including Pugachev's Rebellion of Cossacks, nomads, peoples of the Volga, and peasants.\nThe \"Manifesto on Freedom of the Nobility\", issued during the short reign of Peter III and confirmed by Catherine, freed Russian nobles from compulsory military or state service. The construction of many mansions of the nobility in the classical style endorsed by the empress changed the face of the country. She is often included in the ranks of the enlightened despots. Catherine presided over the age of the Russian Enlightenment and established the Smolny Institute of Noble Maidens, the first state-financed higher education institution for women in Europe.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEarly life.\nCatherine was born on 2 May 1729 in the Castle of the Dukes of Pomerania, Stettin, Province of Pomerania, Kingdom of Prussia, as Princess Sophia Augusta Frederica (or Sophie Auguste Friederike) von Anhalt-Zerbst-Dornburg. Her mother was Joanna Elisabeth of Holstein-Gottorp. Her father, Christian August, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst, belonged to the ruling German family of Anhalt. He failed to become the duke of Courland and Semigallia and, at the time of his daughter's birth, he held the rank of a Prussian general in his capacity as governor of the city of Stettin. However, because her second cousin Charles Peter Ulrich converted to Eastern Orthodox Christianity, her mother's brother, Adolf Frederick, became the heir to the Swedish throne and two of her first cousins, Gustav III and Charles XIII, became Kings of Sweden.\nIn accordance with the prevailing custom among the ruling dynasties of Germany, she received her education chiefly from a French governess and from tutors. According to her memoirs, Sophie was considered a tomboy and trained herself to master a sword.\nCatherine found her childhood to be uneventful; she once wrote to her correspondent Baron Grimm, \"I see nothing of interest in it\". Although Sophie was born a princess, her family had little money; her rise to power was supported by her mother Joanna's wealthy relatives, who were both nobles and royal relations. The more than 300 sovereign entities of the Holy Roman Empire, many of them small and powerless, made for a highly competitive political system in which the various princely families competed for advantages over one another, often by way of political marriages.\nFor smaller German princely families, an advantageous marriage was one of the best means of advancing their interests. To improve the position of her house, Sophie was groomed throughout her childhood to become the wife of a powerful ruler. In addition to her native German, Sophie became fluent in French, the lingua franca of European elites in the 18th century. The young Sophie received the standard education for an 18th-century German princess, concentrating on etiquette, French, and Lutheran theology.\nIn 1739, when Catherine was 10, she met her second cousin who would later become her future husband and Peter III of Russia. She later wrote that she immediately found Peter detestable and that she stayed at one end of the castle and Peter at the other. She disliked his pale complexion and his fondness for alcohol.\nMarriage and succession.\nThe choice of Sophie as wife of the future emperor was a result of the Lopukhina affair, in which Count Jean Armand de Lestocq and King Frederick the Great of Prussia took an active part. The objective was to strengthen the friendship between Prussia and Russia, to weaken the influence of Austria, and to overthrow the chancellor Alexey Bestuzhev-Ryumin, a known partisan of the Austrian alliance on whom the reigning Russian Empress Elizabeth relied. The diplomatic intrigue failed, largely due to the intervention of Sophie's mother, Joanna Elisabeth.\nContemporary and later accounts present Joanna as a figure of strong will and ambition, often involved in court affairs. Her efforts to secure her daughter\u2019s advantageous marriage in Russia brought her into conflict with Empress Elizabeth, who ultimately expelled her from the country amid allegations of espionage on behalf of King Frederick. Elizabeth knew the family well and had intended to marry Joanna's brother (Karl August von Holstein). He died of smallpox in 1727, before the wedding could take place. Despite Joanna's interference, Elizabeth took a strong liking to Sophie, and Sophie and Peter were eventually married in 1745.\nWhen Sophie arrived in Russia in 1744 at age 15, she spared no effort to ingratiate herself not only with Elizabeth, but also with Elizabeth's lover Alexei Razumovsky and with the Russian people at large. She zealously applied herself to learning the Russian language, rising late at night to repeat her lessons in her bedroom. She became ill with pneumonia, but survived and recovered. In her memoirs, she wrote that she made the decision then to do whatever was necessary and to profess to believe whatever was required of her to become qualified to wear the crown. Although she was able to learn Russian, she spoke with a heavy accent, and made grammatical errors. In most circumstances Catherine II spoke French in her court. In fact the use of French as the main language of the Russian imperial court continued until 1812, when it became politically incorrect to speak French in court due to the French invasion of Russia.\nSophie recalled in her memoirs that as soon as she arrived in Russia, she fell ill with a pleuritis that almost killed her. She credited her survival to frequent bloodletting; in a single day, she received four phlebotomies. Her mother's opposition to this practice brought her the Empress's disfavour. When Sophie's situation looked desperate, her mother wanted her confessed by a Lutheran pastor. Awaking from her delirium, however, Sophie said, \"I don't want any Lutheran; I want my Orthodox father [clergyman]\". This increased her popularity with the Empress and her court as a whole. Elizabeth doted on Sophie and their relationship grew stronger after this.\nSophie's father, a devout German Lutheran, opposed his daughter's conversion to Eastern Orthodoxy. Despite his objections, on 28 June 1744, the Russian Orthodox Church received Sophie as a member. It was then that she took the baptismal name Catherine (Yekaterina or Ekaterina) and the (artificial) patronymic \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0435\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0430 (Alekseyevna, daughter of Aleksey), so that she was in all respects the namesake of Catherine I, the mother of Elizabeth and the grandmother of Peter III. The following year, on 21 August 1745, the long-planned dynastic marriage between Catherine and Peter finally took place in the Cathedral of Our Lady of Kazan, St Petersburg. Catherine had recently turned 16. Her father did not travel to Russia for the wedding.\nThe bridegroom, then known as Peter von Holstein-Gottorp, had become Duke of Holstein-Gottorp (located in the north-west of present-day[ [update]] Germany near the border with Denmark) in 1739. The newlyweds settled in the palace of Oranienbaum, which remained the residence of the \"young court\" for many years. From there, they governed the small duchy to obtain experience to govern Russia.\nIn all other aspects, the marriage proved unsuccessful; it remained unconsummated for years due to Peter III's mental immaturity. After Peter took a mistress, Catherine became involved with other prominent court figures. She soon became popular with several powerful political groups that opposed her husband. Unhappy with her marriage, Catherine became an avid reader of books, mostly in French. She disparaged her husband for his devotion to reading on the one hand \"Lutheran prayer-books, the other the history of and trial of some highway robbers who had been hanged or broken on the wheel\".\nIt was during this period that she first read Voltaire and the other \"philosophes\" of the French Enlightenment. As she learned Russian, she became increasingly interested in the literature of her adopted country. Finally, it was the \"Annals\" by Tacitus that caused what she called a \"revolution\" in her teenage mind as Tacitus was the first intellectual she read who understood power politics as they are, not as they should be. She was especially impressed with his argument that people do not act for their professed idealistic reasons, and instead she learned to look for the \"hidden and interested motives\".\nAccording to Alexander Hertzen, who edited a version of Catherine's memoirs, Catherine had her first sexual relationship with Sergei Saltykov while living at Oranienbaum, as her marriage to Peter had not yet been consummated, as Catherine later claimed. Nonetheless, Catherine would eventually leave the final version of her memoirs to her son, the future Paul I, in which she explained why Paul had been Peter's son. Saltykov was used to make Peter jealous, and she did not desire to have a child with him; Catherine wanted to become empress herself, and did not want another heir to the throne; however, Empress Elizabeth allegedly blackmailed Peter and Catherine to produce this heir. Peter and Catherine had both been involved in a 1749 military plot to crown Peter (together with Catherine) in Elizabeth's stead. As a result of this plot, Elizabeth likely wished to deny both Catherine and Peter any rights to the Russian throne. Elizabeth, therefore, allowed Catherine to have sexual lovers only after a new legal heir, Catherine and Peter's son Paul, born in 1754, survived and appeared to be strong.\nAfter this, Catherine carried on sexual liaisons over the years with many men, including Stanislaus Augustus Poniatowski, Grigory Grigoryevich Orlov, Alexander Vasilchikov, Grigory Potemkin, Ivan Rimsky-Korsakov and others. She became acquainted with Princess Ekaterina Vorontsova-Dashkova, the sister of her husband's official mistress. In Dashkova's opinion, she had introduced Catherine to several powerful political groups that opposed her husband; however, Catherine had been involved in military schemes against Elizabeth with the likely goal of subsequently getting rid of Peter III since at least 1749.\nPeter III's temperament became quite unbearable for those who resided in the palace. He would announce trying drills in the morning to male servants, who later joined Catherine in her room to sing and dance until late hours.\nIn 1759, Catherine became pregnant with her second child, Anna, who only lived to 14 months. Due to various rumours of Catherine's promiscuity, Peter was led to believe he was not the child's biological father and is known to have proclaimed, \"Go to the devil!\" when Catherine angrily dismissed his accusation. She therefore spent much of this time alone in her private boudoir to hide away from Peter's abrasive personality. In the first version of her memoirs, edited and published by Alexander Hertzen, Catherine strongly implied that the real father of her son Paul was not Peter, but rather Saltykov.\nCatherine recalled in her memoirs her optimistic and resolute mood before her accession to the throne:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I used to say to myself that happiness and misery depend on ourselves. If you feel unhappy, raise yourself above unhappiness, and so act that your happiness may be independent of all eventualities.\nAfter the death of the Empress Elizabeth on 5 January 1762 (OS: 25 December 1761), Peter succeeded to the throne as Emperor Peter III and Catherine became his empress. The imperial couple moved into the new Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg. The Emperor's eccentricities and policies, including his great admiration for the Prussian King Frederick II, alienated the same groups that Catherine had cultivated as allies. Russia and Prussia had fought each other during the Seven Years' War (1756\u20131763) and Russian troops had occupied Berlin in 1761.\nPeter's support for Frederick II eroded much of his support among the nobility. Peter ceased Russian operations against Prussia, and Frederick suggested the partition of Polish territories with Russia. Peter also intervened in a dispute between his Duchy of Holstein and Denmark over the province of Schleswig (see Count Johann Hartwig Ernst von Bernstorff). As Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, Peter planned war against Denmark, Russia's traditional ally against Sweden.\nIn July 1762, barely six months after becoming emperor, Peter lingered in Oranienbaum with his Holstein-born courtiers and relatives, while Catherine lived in another palace nearby. On the night of 8 July 1762 (OS: 27 June 1762), Catherine was given the news that one of her co-conspirators had been arrested by her estranged husband and that the coup they had been planning would have to take place at once. The next day, she left the palace and departed for the Izmailovsky Regiment, where she delivered a speech asking the soldiers to protect her from her husband. Catherine then left with the Izmailovsky Regiment to go to the Semenovsky Barracks, where the clergy was waiting to ordain her as the sole occupant of the Russian throne and began her reign as Empress of Russia as Catherine II.\nShe had her husband arrested and forced him to sign a document of abdication, leaving none to dispute her accession to the throne.\nOn 17 July 1762\u2014eight days after the coup that amazed the outside world and just six months after his accession to the throne\u2014Peter III died at Ropsha, possibly at the hands of Alexei Orlov (younger brother to Grigory Orlov, then a court favourite and a participant in the coup). Peter supposedly was assassinated, but it is unknown how he died. The official cause, after an autopsy, was a severe attack of haemorrhoidal colic and an apoplexy stroke.\nAt the time of Peter III's overthrow, other potential rivals for the throne included Ivan VI (1740\u20131764), who had been confined at Schl\u00fcsselburg in Lake Ladoga from the age of six months and was thought to have been insane. Ivan was assassinated during an attempt to free him as part of a failed coup against Catherine. Like Elizabeth before her, Catherine had given strict instructions that Ivan was to be killed in the event of any such attempt. The woman later known as Princess Tarakanova (\u0441. 1745\u20131775) was another potential rival.\nCatherine succeeded her husband as empress regnant, following the legal precedent of Empress Catherine I, who had succeeded her husband Peter I in 1725. Historians debate Catherine's technical status, whether as a regent or as a usurper, tolerable only during the minority of her son, Grand Duke Paul.\nReign (1762\u20131796).\nCoronation (1762).\nCatherine was crowned at the Assumption Cathedral in Moscow on 22 September 1762. Her coronation marks the creation of one of the main treasures of the Romanov dynasty, the Great Imperial Crown of Russia, designed by Swiss-French court diamond jeweller J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Pauzi\u00e9. Inspired by Byzantine design, the crown was constructed of two half spheres, one gold and one silver, representing the Eastern and Western Roman Empires, divided by a foliate garland and fastened with a low hoop.\nThe crown contains 75 pearls and 4,936 Indian diamonds forming laurel and oak leaves, the symbols of power and strength, and is surmounted by a 398.62-carat ruby spinel and a diamond cross. The crown was produced in a record two months and weighed 2.3\u00a0kg (5.1 lbs). From 1762, the Great Imperial Crown was the coronation crown of all Romanov emperors until the monarchy's abolition in 1917. It is one of the main treasures of the Romanov dynasty and is now on display in the Moscow Kremlin Armoury Museum.\nForeign affairs.\nDuring her reign, Catherine extended the borders of the Russian Empire by some , absorbing New Russia, Crimea, the North Caucasus, right-bank Ukraine, Belarus, Lithuania, and Courland at the expense, mainly, of two powers\u2014the Ottoman Empire and the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth.\nCatherine's foreign minister, Nikita Panin (in office 1763\u20131781), exercised considerable influence from the beginning of Catherine's reign. A shrewd statesman, Panin dedicated much effort and millions of rubles to setting up a \"Northern Accord\" between Russia, Prussia, Poland, and Sweden to counter the power of the Bourbon\u2013Habsburg League. When it became apparent that his plan could not succeed, Panin fell out of favour with Catherine and she had him replaced with Ivan Osterman (in office 1781\u20131797).\nCatherine agreed to a commercial treaty with Great Britain in 1766, but stopped short of a full military alliance. Although she could see the benefits of friendship with Britain, Catherine was wary of Britain's increased power following its victory in the Seven Years' War, which threatened the European balance of power.\nRusso-Turkish Wars.\nPeter the Great had gained a foothold in the south, on the edge of the Black Sea, during the Azov campaigns. Catherine completed the conquest of the south, making Russia the dominant power in the Balkans following the Russo-Turkish War of 1768\u20131774. Russia inflicted some of the heaviest defeats ever suffered by the Ottoman Empire, including at the Battle of Chesma (5\u20137 July 1770) and the Battle of Kagul (21 July 1770). In 1769, a last major Crimean\u2013Nogai slave raid, which ravaged the Russian held territories in Ukraine, saw the capture of up to 20,000 slaves for the Crimean slave trade.\nRussia's victory brought the Yedisan between the rivers Bug and Dnieper, and Crimea into the Russian sphere of influence. Though a series of victories accrued by the Russian Empire led to substantial territorial conquests, including direct conquest over much of the Pontic\u2013Caspian steppe, less Ottoman territory was directly annexed than might otherwise be expected due to a complex struggle within the European diplomatic system to maintain a balance of power that was acceptable to other European states and avoided direct Russian hegemony over Eastern Europe. Nonetheless, Russia took advantage of the weakened Ottoman Empire, the end of the Seven Years' War, and the withdrawal of France from Polish affairs to assert itself as one of the continent's primary military powers. The war left the Russian Empire in a strengthened position to expand its territory and maintain hegemony over the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, eventually leading to the First Partition of Poland. Turkish losses included diplomatic defeats which led to its decline as a threat to Europe, the loss of its exclusive control over the Orthodox millet, and the beginning of European bickering over the Eastern Question that would feature in European diplomacy until the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire in the aftermath of World War I.\nThe Russian victories procured access to the Black Sea and allowed Catherine's government to incorporate present-day southern Ukraine, where the Russians founded the new cities of Odessa, Nikolayev, Yekaterinoslav (literally: \"the Glory of Catherine\") and Kherson. The Treaty of K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Kaynarca, signed 21 July 1774 (OS: 10 July 1774), gave the Russians territories at Azov, Kerch, Yenikale, Kinburn and the small strip of Black Sea coast between the rivers Dnieper and Bug. The treaty also removed restrictions on Russian naval and commercial traffic in the Azov Sea, granted Russia the position of protector of Orthodox Christians in the Ottoman Empire and made Crimea a protectorate of Russia.\nIn 1770, Russia's State Council announced a policy in favour of eventual Crimean independence. Catherine named \u015eahin Giray, a Crimean Tatar leader, to head the Crimean state and maintain friendly relations with Russia. His period of rule proved disappointing after repeated effort to prop up his regime through military force and monetary aid. Finally, Catherine annexed Crimea in 1783. The palace of the Crimean Khanate passed into the hands of the Russians. In 1787, Catherine conducted a triumphal procession in the Crimea, which helped provoke the next Russo-Turkish War.\nThe Ottomans restarted hostilities with Russia in the Russo-Turkish War of 1787\u20131792. During the Russian-Turkish War of 1787\u20131792, on 25 September 1789, a detachment of the Imperial Russian Army under Alexander Suvorov and Ivan Gudovich, took Khadjibey and Yeni D\u00fcnya for the Russian Empire. In 1794, Odessa replaced Khadjibey by a decree of the Russian Empress Catherine the Great. Russia formally gained possession of the Sanjak of \u00d6zi (Ochakiv Oblast) in 1792 and it became a part of Yekaterinoslav Viceroyalty. The Russian Empire retained full control of Crimea, as well as land between the Southern Bug and the Dniester. This war was another catastrophe for the Ottomans, ending with the Treaty of Jassy (1792).\nRusso-Persian War.\nThe last decades of the 18th century were marked by continual strife between rival claimants to the Peacock Throne. Catherine took advantage of the disorder to consolidate her control over the weak polities of the Caucasus, which was, for swaths of it, an integral Persian domain. The kingdom of Georgia, a subject of the Persians for many centuries, became a Russian protectorate in 1783, when King Erekle II signed the Treaty of Georgievsk, whereby the Empress promised to defend him in the case of Iranian attack. The shamkhals of Tarki followed this lead and accepted Russian protection three years later.\nIn the Treaty of Georgievsk (1783), Russia agreed to protect Georgia against any new invasions and further political aspirations of their Persian suzerains. Catherine waged a new war against Persia in 1796 after they, under the new king Agha Mohammad Khan, again invaded Georgia and established rule in 1795, expelling the newly established Russian garrisons in the Caucasus. The ultimate goal for the Russian government, however, was to topple the anti-Russian shah (king), and to replace him with his pro-Russian half-brother Morteza Qoli Khan, who had defected to Russia.\nIt was widely expected that a 13,000-strong Russian corps would be led by the seasoned general Ivan Gudovich, but the Empress followed the advice of her lover, Prince Zubov, and entrusted the command to his youthful brother, Count Valerian Zubov. The Russian troops set out from Kizlyar in April 1796 and stormed the key fortress of Derbent on 21 May (OS: 10 May). The event was glorified by the court poet Derzhavin in his famous ode; he later commented bitterly on Zubov's inglorious return from the expedition in another famous poem.\nBy mid-June 1796, Zubov's troops easily overran most of the territory of modern-day Azerbaijan, including three principal cities\u2014Baku, Shemakha, and Ganja. By November, they were stationed at the confluence of the Aras and Kura Rivers, poised to attack mainland Iran. In this month, Catherine died, and her son and successor Paul I, who detested that the Zubovs had other plans for the army, ordered the troops to retreat to Russia. This reversal aroused the frustration and enmity of the powerful Zubovs and other officers who took part in the campaign; many of them would be among the conspirators who arranged Paul's murder five years later.\nRelations with Western Europe.\nCatherine longed for recognition as an enlightened sovereign. She refused the Duchy of Holstein-Gottorp, which had ports on the coast of the Atlantic Ocean and refrained from having a Russian army in Germany. Instead, she pioneered for Russia the role that Britain later played through most of the 19th and early 20th centuries as an international mediator in disputes that could, or did, lead to war. She acted as mediator in the War of the Bavarian Succession (1778\u20131779) between the German states of Prussia and Austria. In 1780, she established a League of Armed Neutrality, designed to defend neutral shipping from being searched by the British Royal Navy during the American Revolutionary War.\nFrom 1788 to 1790, Russia fought a war against Sweden instigated by Catherine's cousin, King Gustav III of Sweden, who expected to overrun the Russian armies still engaged in war against the Ottomans and hoped to strike Saint Petersburg directly. But Russia's Baltic Fleet checked the Royal Swedish navy in the tied Battle of Hogland (July 1788), and the Swedish army failed to advance. Denmark declared war on Sweden in 1788 (the Theatre War). After the decisive defeat of the Russian fleet at the Battle of Svensksund in 1790, the parties signed the Treaty of V\u00e4r\u00e4l\u00e4 (14 August 1790), returning all conquered territories to their respective owners and confirming the Treaty of \u00c5bo. Russia was to stop any involvement in the internal affairs of Sweden. Large sums were paid to Gustav III and peace ensued for 20 years even in spite of the assassination of Gustav III in 1792.\nPartitions of Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth.\nIn 1764, Catherine placed Stanislaus Augustus Poniatowski, her former lover, on the Polish throne. Although the idea of partitioning Poland came from Frederick II of Prussia, Catherine took a leading role in its execution in the 1790s. In 1768, she formally became the protector of the political rights of dissidents and peasants of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, which provoked an anti-Russian uprising in Poland, the Confederation of Bar (1768\u20131772), supported by France. After the rebels, their French and European volunteers, and their allied Ottoman Empire had been defeated, she established in the Commonwealth a system of government fully controlled by the Russian Empire through a Permanent Council, under the supervision of her ambassadors and envoys. Empress Catherine was also satisfied despite the loss of Galicia to the Habsburg monarchy. By this \"diplomatic document\" Russia gained Polish Livonia, and lands in eastern Belarus embracing the counties of Vitebsk, Polotsk and Mstislavl.\nIn the War in Defense of the Constitution, pro-Russian conservative Polish magnates, the Confederation of Targowica, fought against Polish forces supporting the constitution, believing that Russians would help them restore the Golden Liberty. Abandoned by their Prussian allies, Polish pro-constitution forces, faced with Targowica units and the regular Russian army, were defeated. Prussia signed a treaty with Russia, agreeing that Polish reforms would be revoked, and both countries would receive chunks of Commonwealth territory. In 1793, deputies to the Grodno Sejm, last Sejm of the Commonwealth, in the presence of the Russian forces, agreed to Russian territorial demands. In the Second Partition, Russia and Prussia helped themselves to enough land so that only one-third of the 1772 population remained in Poland. Prussia named its newly gained province South Prussia, with Pozna\u0144 (and later Warsaw) as the capital of the new province.Targowica confederates, who did not expect another partition, and the king, Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski, who joined them near the end, both lost much prestige and support. The reformers, on the other hand, were attracting increasing support, and in 1794 the Ko\u015bciuszko Uprising began.\nFearing that the May Constitution of Poland (1791) might lead to a resurgence in the power of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth and the growing democratic movements inside the Commonwealth might become a threat to the European monarchies, Catherine decided to refrain from her planned intervention into France and to intervene in Poland instead. She provided support to a Polish anti-reform group known as the Targowica Confederation. Kosciuszko's ragtag insurgent armies won some initial successes, but they eventually fell before the superior forces of the Russian Empire.\nThe partitioning powers, seeing the increasing unrest in the remaining Commonwealth, decided to solve the problem by erasing any independent Polish state from the map. On 24 October 1795, their representatives signed a treaty, dividing the remaining territories of the Commonwealth between their three countries. One of Russia's chief foreign policy authors, Alexander Bezborodko, advised Catherine II on the Second and Third Partitions of Poland. The Russian part included and 1.2\u00a0million people with Vilnius. After defeating Polish loyalist forces in the Polish\u2013Russian War of 1792 and in the Ko\u015bciuszko Uprising (1794), Russia completed the partitioning of Poland, dividing all of the remaining Commonwealth territory with Prussia and Austria (1795).\nRelations with China.\nThe Qianlong Emperor of China was committed to an expansionist policy in Central Asia and saw the Russian Empire as a potential rival, making for difficult and unfriendly relations between Beijing and Saint Petersburg. In 1762, he unilaterally abrogated the Treaty of Kyakhta, which governed the caravan trade between the two empires. Another source of tension was the wave of Dzungar Mongol fugitives from the Qing Empire who took refuge with the Russians.\nThe Dzungar genocide which was committed by the Qing Empire had led many Dzungars to seek sanctuary in the Russian Empire, and it was also one of the reasons for the abrogation of the Treaty of Kyakhta. Catherine perceived that the Qianlong Emperor was an unpleasant and arrogant neighbour, once saying: \"I shall not die until I have ejected the Turks from Europe, suppressed the pride of China and established trade with India\". In a 1790 letter to Baron de Grimm written in French, she called the Qianlong Emperor \"mon voisin chinois aux petits yeux\" (\"my Chinese neighbour with small eyes\").\nRelations with Japan.\nIn the Far East, Russians became active in fur trapping in Kamchatka and the Kuril Islands. This spurred Russian interest in opening trade with Japan to the south for supplies and food. In 1783, storms drove a Japanese sea captain, Daikokuya K\u014dday\u016b, ashore in the Aleutian Islands, at that time Russian territory. Russian local authorities helped his party, and the Russian government decided to use him as a trade envoy. On 28 June 1791, Catherine granted Daikokuya an audience at Tsarskoye Selo. Subsequently, in 1792, the Russian government dispatched a trade mission to Japan, led by Adam Laxman. The Tokugawa shogunate received the mission, but negotiations failed.\nThe evaluation of foreign policy.\nNicholas I, her grandson, evaluated the foreign policy of Catherine the Great as a dishonest one. Catherine failed to reach any of the initial goals she had put forward. Her foreign policy lacked a long-term strategy and from the very start was characterised by a series of mistakes. She lost the large territories of the Russian protectorate of the Commonwealth of Poland and Lithuania and left its territories to Prussia and Austria. The Commonwealth had become the Russian protectorate since the reign of Peter I, but he did not intervene into the problem of political freedoms of dissidents advocating for their religious freedoms only. Catherine did turn Russia into a global great power, not only a European one, but with quite a different reputation from what she initially had planned as an honest policy. The global trade of Russian natural resources and Russian grain provoked famines, starvation and fear of famines in Russia. Her dynasty lost power because of this and of a war with Austria and Germany, impossible without her foreign policy.\nEconomics and finance.\nRussian economic development was well below the standards in western Europe. Historian Fran\u00e7ois Cruzet writes that Russia under Catherine:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;had neither a free peasantry, nor a significant middle class, nor legal norms hospitable to private enterprise. Still, there was a start of industry, mainly textiles around Moscow and ironworks in the Ural Mountains, with a labour force mainly of serfs, bound to the works.\nCatherine imposed a comprehensive system of state regulation of merchants' activities. It was a failure because it narrowed and stifled entrepreneurship and did not reward economic development. She had more success when she strongly encouraged the migration of the Volga Germans, farmers from Germany who settled mostly in the Volga River Valley region. They indeed helped modernise the sector that totally dominated the Russian economy. They introduced numerous innovations regarding wheat production and flour milling, tobacco culture, sheep raising, and small-scale manufacturing.\nIn 1768, the Assignation Bank was given the task of issuing the first government paper money. It opened in Saint Petersburg and Moscow in 1769. Several bank branches were afterwards established in other towns, called government towns. Paper notes were issued upon payment of similar sums in copper money, which were also refunded upon the presentation of those notes. The emergence of these assignation roubles was necessary due to large government spending on military needs, which led to a shortage of silver in the treasury (transactions, especially in foreign trade, were conducted almost exclusively in silver and gold coins). Assignation roubles circulated on equal footing with the silver rouble; a market exchange rate for these two currencies was ongoing. The use of these notes continued until 1849.\nCatherine paid a great deal of attention to financial reform, and relied heavily on the advice of Prince A. A. Viazemski. She found that piecemeal reform worked poorly because there was no overall view of a comprehensive state budget. Money was needed for wars and necessitated the junking of the old financial institutions. A key principle was responsibilities defined by function. It was instituted by the Fundamental Law of 7 November 1775. Vaizemski's Office of State Revenue took centralised control and by 1781, the government possessed its first approximation of a state budget.\nPublic health.\nCatherine made public health a priority. She made use of the social theory ideas of German cameralism and French physiocracy, as well as Russian precedents and experiments such as foundling homes. In 1764, she launched the Moscow Foundling Home and lying-in hospital. In 1763, she opened Paul's Hospital, also known as Pavlovskaya Hospital. She had the government collect and publish vital statistics. In 1762, she called on the army to upgrade its medical services. She established a centralised medical administration charged with initiating vigorous health policies. Catherine decided to have herself inoculated against smallpox by English doctor Thomas Dimsdale. While this was considered a controversial method at the time, she succeeded. Her son Pavel later was inoculated as well.\nCatherine then sought to have inoculations throughout her empire and stated: \"My objective was, through my example, to save from death the multitude of my subjects who, not knowing the value of this technique, and frightened of it, were left in danger\". By 1800, approximately 2\u00a0million inoculations (almost 6% of the population) were administered in the Russian Empire. Historians regard her efforts as a success and one of her most significant contributions to Russia.\nSerfs.\nAccording to a census taken from 1754 to 1762, Catherine owned 500,000 serfs. A further 2.8\u00a0million belonged to the Russian state.\nRights and conditions.\nAt the time of Catherine's reign, the landowning noble class owned the serfs, who were bound to the land they tilled. Children of serfs were born into serfdom and worked the same land their parents had. Even before the rule of Catherine, serfs had very limited rights, but they were not exactly slaves. While the state did not technically allow them to own possessions, some serfs were able to accumulate enough wealth to pay for their freedom. The understanding of law in Imperial Russia by all sections of society was often weak, confused, or nonexistent, particularly in the provinces where most serfs lived. This is why some serfs were able to do things such as to accumulate wealth. To become serfs, people conceded their freedoms to a landowner in exchange for their protection and support in times of hardship. In addition, they received land to till, but were taxed a certain percentage of their crops to give to their landowners. These were the privileges a serf was entitled to and that nobles were bound to carry out. All of this was true before Catherine's reign, and this is the system she inherited.\nCatherine did initiate some changes to serfdom. If a noble did not live up to his side of the deal, the serfs could file complaints against him by following the proper channels of law. Catherine gave them this new right, but in exchange they could no longer appeal directly to her. She did this because she did not want to be bothered by the peasantry, but did not want to give them reason to revolt. In this act, she gave the serfs a legitimate bureaucratic status they had lacked before. Some serfs were able to use their new status to their advantage. For example, serfs could apply to be freed if they were under illegal ownership, and non-nobles were not allowed to own serfs. Some serfs did apply for freedom and were successful. In addition, some governors listened to the complaints of serfs and punished nobles, but this was by no means universal.\nOther than these, the rights of a serf were very limited. A landowner could punish his serfs at his discretion, and under Catherine the Great gained the ability to sentence his serfs to hard labour in Siberia, a punishment normally reserved for convicted criminals. The only thing a noble could not do to his serfs was to kill them. The life of a serf belonged to the state. Historically, when the serfs faced problems they could not solve on their own (such as abusive masters), they often appealed to the autocrat, and continued doing so during Catherine's reign, but she signed legislation prohibiting it. Although she did not want to communicate directly with the serfs, she did create some measures to improve their conditions as a class and reduce the size of the institution of serfdom. For example, she took action to limit the number of new serfs; she eliminated many ways for people to become serfs, culminating in the manifesto of 17 March 1775, which prohibited a serf who had once been freed from becoming a serf again.\nWhile the majority of serfs were farmers bound to the land, a noble could have his serfs sent away to learn a trade or be educated at a school as well as employ them at businesses that paid wages. This happened more often during Catherine's reign because of the new schools she established. Only in this way\u2014apart from conscription to the army\u2014could a serf leave the farm for which he was responsible, but this was used for selling serfs to people who could not own them legally because of absence of nobility abroad.\nAttitudes towards Catherine.\nThe attitude of the serfs toward their autocrat had historically been a positive one, usually choosing to blame the nobles for blocking off communication with Catherine \nAdditionally, because the serfs had no political power, they frequently rioted to convey their message. They were suspicious of Catherine upon her accession because she had annulled an act by Peter III that essentially freed the serfs belonging to the Russian Orthodox Church. People far away from the capital were confused as to the circumstances of her accession to the throne.\nThe peasants were discontented because of many other factors as well, including crop failure and epidemics, especially a major epidemic in 1771. The nobles were imposing a stricter rule than ever, reducing the land of each serf and restricting their freedoms further beginning around 1767. Their discontent led to widespread outbreaks of violence and rioting during Pugachev's Rebellion of 1774. The serfs most likely followed someone who was pretending to be the true empress because of their feelings of disconnection to Catherine and her policies empowering the nobles, but this was not the first time they followed a pretender under Catherine's reign.\nPugachev had made stories about himself acting as a real emperor should, doing noble things like helping the common people, listening to their problems, praying for them, and generally acting saintly, and this helped rally the peasants and serfs, with their already moral values, to his cause. Under the peasants' dislike of Catherine, she overall ruled for 10 years before their anger boiled over into a rebellion as extensive as Pugachev's. The rebellion ultimately failed as Catherine was pushed away from the idea of serf liberation following the violent uprising. Despite Catherine's enlightened ideals, the serfs were generally unhappy and discontented under her rule.\nArts and culture.\nCatherine was a patron of the arts, literature, and education. The Hermitage Museum, which now[ [update]] occupies the whole Winter Palace, began as Catherine's personal collection. The empress was a great lover of art and books, and ordered the construction of the Hermitage in 1770 to house her expanding collection of paintings, sculpture, and books. By 1790, the Hermitage was home to 38,000 books, 10,000 gems and 10,000 drawings. Two wings were devoted to her collections of \"curiosities\".\nShe ordered the planting of the first English landscape garden at Tsarskoye Selo in May 1770. In a letter to Voltaire in 1772, she wrote: \"Right now I adore English gardens, curves, gentle slopes, ponds in the form of lakes, archipelagos on dry land, and I have a profound scorn for straight lines, symmetric avenues. I hate fountains that torture water in order to make it take a course contrary to its nature: Statues are relegated to galleries, vestibules etc.; in a word, Anglomania is the master of my plantomania\".\nCatherine shared in the general European craze for all things Chinese, and made a point of collecting Chinese art and buying porcelain in the popular \"Chinoiserie\" style. Between 1762 and 1766, she had built the \"Chinese Palace\" at Oranienbaum which reflected the \"chinoiserie\" style of architecture and gardening. The Chinese Palace was designed by the Italian architect Antonio Rinaldi who specialised in the \"chinoiserie\" style. In 1779, she hired the Scottish architect Charles Cameron to build the Chinese Village at Tsarskoye Selo. Catherine had at first attempted to hire a Chinese architect to build the Chinese Village, and on finding that was impossible, settled on Cameron, who likewise specialised in the \"chinoiserie\" style.\nShe made a special effort to bring leading intellectuals and scientists to Russia, and she wrote her own comedies, works of fiction, and memoirs. She worked with Voltaire, Diderot, and d'Alembert\u2014all French encyclopedists who later cemented her reputation in their writings. The leading economists of her day, such as Arthur Young and Jacques Necker, became foreign members of the Free Economic Society, established on her suggestion in Saint Petersburg in 1765. She recruited the scientists Leonhard Euler and Peter Simon Pallas from Berlin and Anders Johan Lexell from Sweden to the Russian capital.\nCatherine enlisted Voltaire to her cause, and corresponded with him for 15 years, from her accession to his death in 1778. He lauded her accomplishments, calling her \"The Star of the North\" and the \"Semiramis of Russia\" (in reference to the legendary Queen of Babylon, a subject on which he published a tragedy in 1768). Although she never met him face to face, she mourned him bitterly when he died. She acquired his collection of books from his heirs, and placed them in the National Library of Russia.\nCatherine read three sorts of books, namely those for pleasure, those for information, and those to provide her with a philosophy. In the first category, she read romances and comedies that were popular at the time, many of which were regarded as \"inconsequential\" by the critics both then and since. She especially liked the work of German comic writers such as Moritz August von Th\u00fcmmel and Christoph Friedrich Nicolai. In the second category fell the work of Denis Diderot, Jacques Necker, Johann Bernhard Basedow and Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon. Catherine expressed some frustration with the economists she read for what she regarded as their impractical theories, writing in the margin of one of Necker's books that if it was possible to solve all of the state's economic problems in one day, she would have done so a long time ago. For information about particular nations that interested her, she read Jean Baptiste Bourguignon d'Anville's \"Memoirs de Chine\" to learn about the vast and wealthy Chinese empire that bordered her empire; Fran\u00e7ois Baron de Tott's \"Memoires de les Turcs et les Tartares\" for information about the Ottoman Empire and the Crimean khanate; the books of Frederick the Great praising himself to learn about Frederick just as much as to learn about Prussia; and pamphlets written by Benjamin Franklin denouncing the British Crown to understand the reasons behind the American Revolution. In the third category fell the work of Voltaire, Friedrich Melchior, Baron von Grimm, Ferdinando Galiani, Nicolas Baudeau and Sir William Blackstone. For philosophy, she liked books promoting what has been called \"enlightened despotism\", which she embraced as her ideal of an autocratic but reformist government that operated according to the rule of law, not the whims of the ruler, hence her interest in Blackstone's legal commentaries.\nWithin a few months of her accession in 1762, having heard the French government threatened to stop the publication of the famous French \"Encyclop\u00e9die\" on account of its irreligious spirit, Catherine proposed to Diderot that he should complete his great work in Russia under her protection. Four years later, in 1766, she endeavoured to embody in legislation the principles of Enlightenment she learned from studying the French philosophers. She called together at Moscow a Grand Commission\u2014almost a consultative parliament\u2014composed of 652 members of all classes (officials, nobles, burghers, and peasants) and of various nationalities. The commission had to consider the needs of the Russian Empire and the means of satisfying them. The empress prepared the \"Instructions for the Guidance of the Assembly\", pillaging (as she frankly admitted) the philosophers of Western Europe, especially Montesquieu and Cesare Beccaria.\nAs many of the democratic principles frightened her more moderate and experienced advisors, she refrained from immediately putting them into practice. After holding more than 200 sittings, the so-called Commission dissolved without getting beyond the realm of theory.\nCatherine began issuing codes to address some of the modernisation trends suggested in her Nakaz. In 1775, the empress decreed a Statute for the Administration of the provinces of the Russian Empire. The statute sought to efficiently govern Russia by increasing population and dividing the country into provinces and districts. By the end of her reign, 50 provinces and nearly 500 districts were created, government officials numbering more than double this were appointed, and spending on local government increased sixfold. In 1785, Catherine conferred on the nobility the Charter to the Nobility, increasing the power of the landed oligarchs. Nobles in each district elected a Marshal of the Nobility, who spoke on their behalf to the monarch on issues of concern to them, mainly economic ones. In the same year, Catherine issued the Charter of the Towns, which distributed all people into six groups as a way to limit the power of nobles and create a middle estate. Catherine also issued the Code of Commercial Navigation and Salt Trade Code of 1781, the Police Ordinance of 1782, and the Statute of National Education of 1786. In 1777, the empress described to Voltaire her legal innovations within a backward Russia as progressing \"little by little\".\nDuring Catherine's reign, Russians imported and studied the classical and European influences that inspired the Russian Enlightenment. Gavrila Derzhavin, Denis Fonvizin and Ippolit Bogdanovich laid the groundwork for the great writers of the 19th century, especially for Alexander Pushkin. Catherine became a great patron of Russian opera. Alexander Radishchev published his \"Journey from St. Petersburg to Moscow\" in 1790, shortly after the start of the French Revolution. He warned of uprisings in Russia because of the deplorable social conditions of the serfs. Catherine decided it promoted the dangerous poison of the French Revolution. She had the book burned and the author exiled to Siberia.\nCatherine also received Elisabeth Vig\u00e9e Le Brun at her Tsarskoye Selo residence in St Petersburg, by whom she was painted shortly before her death. Madame Vig\u00e9e Le Brun vividly describes the empress in her memoirs:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;the sight of this famous woman so impressed me that I found it impossible to think of anything: I could only stare at her. Firstly I was very surprised at her small stature; I had imagined her to be very tall, as great as her fame. She was also very fat, but her face was still beautiful, and she wore her white hair up, framing it perfectly. Her genius seemed to rest on her forehead, which was both high and wide. Her eyes were soft and sensitive, her nose quite Greek, her colour high and her features expressive. She addressed me immediately in a voice full of sweetness, if a little throaty: \"I am delighted to welcome you here, Madame, your reputation runs before you. I am very fond of the arts, especially painting. I am no connoisseur, but I am a great art lover.\"\nMadame Vig\u00e9e Le Brun also describes the empress at a gala:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The double doors opened and the Empress appeared. I have said that she was quite small, and yet on the days when she made her public appearances, with her head held high, her eagle-like stare and a countenance accustomed to command, all this gave her such an air of majesty that to me she might have been Queen of the World; she wore the sashes of three orders, and her costume was both simple and regal; it consisted of a muslin tunic embroidered with gold fastened by a diamond belt, and the full sleeves were folded back in the Asiatic style. Over this tunic she wore a red velvet dolman with very short sleeves. The bonnet which held her white hair was not decorated with ribbons, but with the most beautiful diamonds.Russia's second ballet school, Moscow State Academy of Choreography, commonly known as The Bolshoi Ballet Academy, was founded during Catherine's reign on 23 December 1773. It entered into a contract with the Italian teacher-choreographer Filippo Becari, who must was \"the most capable of dancing\" children to learn \"to dance with all possible precision and to show themselves publicly in all pantomime ballets\".\nEducation.\nCatherine held western European philosophies and culture close to her heart, and she wanted to surround herself with like-minded people within Russia. She believed a 'new kind of person' could be created by inculcating Russian children with European education. Catherine believed education could change the hearts and minds of the Russian people and turn them away from backwardness. This meant developing individuals both intellectually and morally, providing them knowledge and skills, and fostering a sense of civic responsibility. Her goal was to modernise education across Russia.\nCatherine appointed Ivan Betskoy as her advisor on educational matters. Through him, she collected information from Russia and other countries about educational institutions. She also established a commission composed of T.N. Teplov, T. von Klingstedt, F.G. Dilthey and the historian G. Muller. She consulted British pedagogical pioneers, particularly the Rev. Daniel Dumaresq and Dr John Brown. In 1764, she sent for Dumaresq to come to Russia and then appointed him to the educational commission. The commission studied the reform projects previously installed by I.I. Shuvalov under Elizabeth and under Peter III. They submitted recommendations for the establishment of a general system of education for all Russian orthodox subjects from the age of 5 to 18, excluding serfs. However, no action was taken on any recommendations put forth by the commission due to the calling of the Legislative Commission. In July 1765, Dumaresq wrote to Dr. John Brown about the commission's problems and received a long reply containing very general and sweeping suggestions for education and social reforms in Russia. Dr. Brown argued, in a democratic country, education ought to be under the state's control and based on an education code. He also placed great emphasis on the \"proper and effectual education of the female sex\"; two years prior, Catherine had commissioned Ivan Betskoy to draw up the General Programme for the Education of Young People of Both Sexes. This work emphasised the fostering of the creation of a 'new kind of people' raised in isolation from the damaging influence of a backward Russian environment. The Establishment of the Moscow Foundling Home (Moscow Orphanage) was the first attempt at achieving that goal. It was charged with admitting destitute and extramarital children to educate them in any way the state deemed fit. Because the Moscow Foundling Home was not established as a state-funded institution, it represented an opportunity to experiment with new educational theories. However, the Moscow Foundling Home was unsuccessful, mainly due to extremely high mortality rates, which prevented many of the children from living long enough to develop into the enlightened subjects the state desired.\nNot long after the Moscow Foundling Home, at the instigation of her factotum, Ivan Betskoy, she wrote a manual for the education of young children, drawing from the ideas of John Locke, and founded the famous Smolny Institute in 1764, first of its kind in Russia. At first, the institute only admitted young girls of the noble elite, but eventually it began to admit girls of the petit-bourgeoisie as well. The girls who attended the Smolny Institute, Smolyanki, were often accused of being ignorant of anything that went on in the world outside the walls of the Smolny buildings, within which they acquired a proficiency in French, music, and dancing, along with a complete awe of the monarch. Central to the institute's philosophy of pedagogy was strict enforcement of discipline. Running and games were forbidden, and the building was kept particularly cold because too much warmth was believed to be harmful to the developing body, as was excessive play.\nFrom 1768 to 1774, no progress was made in setting up a national school system. However, Catherine continued to investigate the pedagogical principles and practice of other countries and made many other educational reforms, including an overhaul of the Cadet Corps in 1766. The Corps then began to take children from a very young age and educate them until the age of 21, with a broadened curriculum that included the sciences, philosophy, ethics, history, and international law. These reforms in the Cadet Corps influenced the curricula of the Naval Cadet Corps and the Engineering and Artillery Schools. Following the war and the defeat of Pugachev, Catherine laid the obligation to establish schools at the \"guberniya\"\u2014a provincial subdivision of the Russian empire ruled by a governor\u2014on the Boards of Social Welfare set up with the participation of elected representatives from the three free estates.\nBy 1782, Catherine arranged another advisory commission to review the information she had gathered on the educational systems of many different countries. One system that particularly stood out was produced by a mathematician, Franz Aepinus. He was strongly in favour of the adoption of the Austrian three-tier model of trivial, real, and normal schools at the village, town, and provincial capital levels.\nIn addition to the advisory commission, Catherine established a Commission of National Schools under Pyotr Zavadovsky. This commission was charged with organising a national school network, as well as providing teacher training and textbooks. On 5 August 1786, the Russian Statute of National Education was created. The statute established a two-tier network of high schools and primary schools in \"guberniya\" capitals that were free of charge, open to all of the free classes (not serfs), and co-educational. It also stipulated in detail the subjects to be taught at every age and the method of teaching. In addition to the textbooks translated by the commission, teachers were provided with the \"Guide to Teachers\". This work, divided into four parts, dealt with teaching methods, subject matter, teacher conduct, and school administration.\nDespite these efforts, later historians of the 19th century were generally critical. Some claimed Catherine failed to supply enough money to support her educational program. Two years after the implementation of Catherine's program, a member of the National Commission inspected the institutions established. Throughout Russia, the inspectors encountered a patchy response. While the nobility provided appreciable amounts of money for these institutions, they preferred to send their own children to private, prestigious institutions. Also, the townspeople tended to turn against the junior schools and their teaching methods. Yet by the end of Catherine's reign, an estimated 62,000 pupils were being educated in some 549 state institutions. While a significant improvement, it was only a minuscule number, compared to the size of the Russian population.\nReligious affairs.\nCatherine's apparent embrace of all things Russian (including Russian Orthodoxy) may have prompted her personal indifference to religion. She nationalised all of the Church lands to help pay for her wars, largely emptied the monasteries, and forced most of the remaining clergymen to survive as farmers or from fees for baptisms and other services. Very few members of the nobility entered the Church, which became even less important than it had been. She did not allow dissenters to build chapels, and she suppressed religious dissent after the onset of the French Revolution.\nHowever, in accord with her anti-Ottoman policy, Catherine promoted the protection and fostering of Christians under Turkish rule. She placed strictures on Catholics (\"ukaz\" of 23 February 1769), mainly Polish, and attempted to assert and extend state control over them in the wake of the partitions of Poland. For example, although Catholic parishes were allowed to retain their property and worship, papal oversight of parishes was restricted to only theology. In its stead, Catherine appointed a Catholic bishop (later raising the position to archbishop) of Mohylev to administer all Catholic churches in her territory. Nevertheless, Catherine's Russia provided an asylum and a base for regrouping to the Jesuits following the suppression of the Jesuits in most of Europe in 1773.\nIslam.\nCatherine took many different approaches to Islam during her reign. She avoided force and tried persuasion (and money) to integrate Muslim areas into her empire. Between 1762 and 1773, Muslims were prohibited from owning any Orthodox serfs. They were pressured into Orthodoxy through monetary incentives. Catherine promised more serfs of all religions, as well as amnesty for convicts, if Muslims chose to convert to Orthodoxy. However, the Legislative Commission of 1767 offered several seats to people professing the Islamic faith. This commission promised to protect their religious rights, but did not do so. Many Orthodox peasants felt threatened by the sudden change, and burned mosques as a sign of their displeasure.\nCatherine chose to assimilate Islam into the state rather than eliminate it when public outcry became too disruptive. After the \"Toleration of All Faiths\" Edict of 1773, Muslims were permitted to build mosques and practise all of their traditions, the most obvious of these being the pilgrimage to Mecca, which previously had been denied. Catherine created the Orenburg Muslim Spiritual Assembly to help regulate Muslim-populated regions as well as regulate the instruction and ideals of mullahs. The positions on the Assembly were appointed and paid for by Catherine and her government as a way of regulating religious affairs.\nIn 1785, Catherine approved the subsidising of new mosques and new town settlements for Muslims. This was another attempt to organise and passively control the outer fringes of her country. By building new settlements with mosques placed in them, Catherine attempted to ground many of the nomadic people who wandered through southern Russia. In 1786, she assimilated the Islamic schools into the Russian public school system under government regulation. The plan was another attempt to force nomadic people to settle. This allowed the Russian government to control more people, especially those who previously had not fallen under the jurisdiction of Russian law.\nJudaism.\nRussia often treated Judaism as a separate entity, where Jews were maintained with a separate legal and bureaucratic system. Although the government knew that Judaism existed, Catherine and her advisers had no real definition of what a Jew is because the term meant many things during her reign. Judaism was a small, if not non-existent, religion in Russia until 1772. When Catherine agreed to the First Partition of Poland, the large new Jewish element was treated as a separate people, defined by their religion. Catherine separated the Jews from Orthodox society, restricting them to the Pale of Settlement. She levied additional taxes on the followers of Judaism; if a family converted to the Orthodox faith, that additional tax was lifted. Jewish members of society were required to pay double the tax of their Orthodox neighbours. Converted Jews could gain permission to enter the merchant class and farm as free peasants under Russian rule.\nIn an attempt to assimilate the Jews into Russia's economy, Catherine included them under the rights and laws of the Charter of the Towns of 1782. Orthodox Russians disliked the inclusion of Judaism, mainly for economic reasons. Catherine tried to keep the Jews away from certain economic spheres, even under the guise of equality; in 1790, she banned Jewish citizens from Moscow's middle class.\nIn 1785, Catherine declared Jews to be officially foreigners, with foreigners' rights. This re-established the separate identity that Judaism maintained in Russia throughout the Jewish Haskalah. Catherine's decree also denied Jews the rights of an Orthodox or naturalised citizen of Russia. Taxes doubled again for those of Jewish descent in 1794, and Catherine officially declared that Jews bore no relation to Russians.\nRussian Orthodoxy.\nIn many ways, the Russian Orthodox Church fared no better than its foreign counterparts during the reign of Catherine. Under her leadership, she completed what Peter III had started. The Church's lands were expropriated, and the budget of both monasteries and bishoprics were controlled by the Collegium of Accounting. Endowments from the government replaced income from privately held lands. The endowments were often much less than the original intended amount. She closed 569 of 954 monasteries, of which only 161 received government money. Only 400,000 roubles of Church wealth were paid back. While other religions (such as Islam) received invitations to the Legislative Commission, the Orthodox clergy did not receive a single seat. Their place in government was restricted severely during the years of Catherine's reign.\nIn 1762, to help mend the rift between the Russian Orthodox Church and a sect that called themselves the Old Believers, Catherine passed an act that allowed Old Believers to practice their faith openly without interference. While claiming religious tolerance, she intended to recall the Old Believers into the official Church. They refused to comply, and in 1764, she deported over 20,000 Old Believers to Siberia on the grounds of their faith. In later years, Catherine amended her thoughts. Old Believers were allowed to hold elected municipal positions after the Urban Charter of 1785, and she promised religious freedom to those who wished to settle in Russia.\nReligious education was reviewed strictly. At first, she attempted to revise clerical studies, proposing a reform of religious schools. This reform never progressed beyond the planning stages. By 1786, Catherine excluded all religion and clerical studies programs from lay education. By separating the public interests from those of the Church, Catherine began a secularisation of the day-to-day workings of Russia. She transformed the clergy from a group that wielded great power over the Russian government and its people to a segregated community forced to depend on the state for compensation.\nPersonal life.\nCatherine, throughout her long reign, took many lovers, often elevating them to high positions for as long as they held her interest and then pensioning them off with gifts of serfs and large estates. The percentage of state money spent on the court increased from 10% in 1767 to 11% in 1781 to 14% in 1795. Catherine gave away 66,000 serfs from 1762 to 1772, 202,000 from 1773 to 1793, and 100,000 in one day: 18 August 1795. Catherine bought the support of the bureaucracy. In 1767, Catherine decreed that after seven years in one rank, civil servants automatically would be promoted regardless of office or merit.\nAfter her affair with her lover and adviser Grigory Potemkin ended in 1776, he allegedly selected a candidate-lover for her who had the physical beauty and mental faculties to hold her interest (such as Alexander Dmitriev-Mamonov and Nicholas Alexander Suk). Some of these men loved her in return, and she always showed generosity towards them, even after the affair ended. One of her lovers, Pyotr Zavadovsky, received 50,000 roubles, a pension of 5,000 roubles, and 4,000 peasants in Ukraine after she dismissed him in 1777. The last of her lovers, Platon Zubov, was 40 years her junior. Her sexual independence led to many of the legends about her.\nCatherine kept her illegitimate son by Grigory Orlov (Alexis Bobrinsky, later elevated to Count Bobrinsky by Paul I) near Tula, away from her court.\nThe acceptance of a woman ruler was more of an issue among elites in Western Europe than in Russia. The British ambassador to Russia, James Harris, reported back to London that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Her Majesty has a masculine force of mind, obstinacy in adhering to a plan, and intrepidity in the execution of it; but she wants the more manly virtues of deliberation, forbearance in prosperity and accuracy of judgment, while she possesses in a high degree the weaknesses vulgarly attributed to her sex\u2014love of flattery, and its inseparable companion, vanity; an inattention to unpleasant but salutary advice; and a propensity to voluptuousness which leads to excesses that would debase a female character in any sphere of life.\nPoniatowski.\nSir Charles Hanbury Williams, the British ambassador to Russia, offered Stanis\u0142aw Poniatowski a place in the embassy in return for gaining Catherine as an ally. Poniatowski, through his mother's side, came from the Czartoryski family, prominent members of the pro-Russian faction in Poland; Poniatowski and Catherine were eighth cousins, twice removed, by their mutual ancestor King Christian I of Denmark, by virtue of Poniatowski's maternal descent from the Scottish House of Stuart. Catherine, 26 years old and already married to the then-Grand Duke Peter for some 10 years, met the 22-year-old Poniatowski in 1755, well before encountering the Orlov brothers. They had a daughter named Anna Petrovna in December 1757 (not to be confused with Grand Duchess Anna Petrovna of Russia, the daughter of Peter I's second marriage), although she was legally regarded as Grand Duke Peter's.\nKing Augustus III of Poland died in 1763, so Poland needed to elect a new ruler. Catherine supported Poniatowski as a candidate to become the next king. She sent the Russian army into Poland to avoid possible disputes. Russia invaded Poland on 26 August 1764, threatening to fight, and imposing Poniatowski as king. Poniatowski accepted the throne, and thereby put himself under Catherine's control. News of Catherine's plan spread, and Frederick II (others say the Ottoman sultan) warned her that if she tried to conquer Poland by marrying Poniatowski, all of Europe would oppose her. She had no intention of marrying him, having already given birth to Orlov's child and to the Grand Duke Paul by then.\nPrussia (through the agency of Prince Henry), Russia (under Catherine), and Austria (under Maria Theresa) began preparing the ground for the partitions of Poland. In the first partition, 1772, the three powers split among them. Russia got territories east of the line connecting, more or less, Riga\u2013Polotsk\u2013Mogilev. In the second partition, in 1793, Russia received the most land, from west of Minsk almost to Kiev and down the river Dnieper, leaving some spaces of steppe down south in front of Ochakov, on the Black Sea. Later uprisings in Poland led to the third partition in 1795. Poland ceased to exist as an independent nation until its post-World War I reconstitution.\nOrlov.\nGrigory Orlov, the grandson of a rebel in the Streltsy uprising (1698) against Peter the Great, distinguished himself in the Battle of Zorndorf (25 August 1758), receiving three wounds. He represented an opposite to Peter's pro-Prussian sentiment, with which Catherine disagreed. By 1759, he and Catherine had become lovers; no one told Catherine's husband, Peter. Catherine saw Orlov as very useful, and he became instrumental in the 28 June 1762 \"coup d'\u00e9tat\" against her husband, but she preferred to remain the dowager empress of Russia rather than marrying anyone.\nOrlov and his other three brothers found themselves rewarded with titles, money, swords, and other gifts, but Catherine did not marry Grigory, who proved inept at politics and useless when asked for advice. He received a palace in Saint Petersburg when Catherine became empress.\nOrlov died in 1783. Their son, Aleksey Grygoriovich Bobrinsky (1762\u20131813), had one daughter, Maria Alexeyeva Bobrinsky (Bobrinskaya) (1798\u20131835), who married in 1819 the 34-year-old Prince Nikolai Sergeevich Gagarin (London, England, 1784\u20131842) who took part in the Battle of Borodino (7 September 1812) against Napoleon, and later served as ambassador in Turin, the capital of the Kingdom of Sardinia.\nPotemkin.\nGrigory Potemkin was involved in the palace coup of 1762. In 1772, Catherine's close friends informed her of Orlov's affairs with other women, and she dismissed him. By the winter of 1773, Pugachev's Rebellion was starting to take root and Catherine's son Paul had started gaining support; both of these trends threatened her power. She called Potemkin for help\u2014mostly military\u2014and he became devoted to her.\nIn 1772, Catherine wrote to Potemkin. Days earlier, she had found out about an uprising in the Volga region. She appointed General Aleksandr Bibikov to put down the uprising, but she needed Potemkin's advice on military strategy. Potemkin quickly gained positions and awards. Russian poets wrote about his virtues, the court praised him, foreign ambassadors fought for his favour, and his family moved into the palace. He later became the de facto absolute ruler of New Russia, governing its colonisation.\nIn 1780, Emperor Joseph II, the son of Holy Roman Empress Maria Theresa, toyed with the idea of determining whether or not to enter an alliance with Russia, and asked to meet Catherine. Potemkin had the task of briefing him and travelling with him to Saint Petersburg. Potemkin also convinced Catherine to expand the universities in Russia to increase the number of scientists.\nCatherine was worried that Potemkin's poor health would delay his important work in colonising and developing the south as he had planned. He died at the age of 52 in 1791.\nFinal months and death.\nCatherine's life and reign included many personal successes, but they ended in two failures. Her Swedish cousin (once removed), King Gustav IV Adolf, visited her in September 1796, the empress's intention being that her granddaughter Alexandra should become queen of Sweden by marriage. A ball was given at the imperial court on 11 September when the engagement was supposed to be announced. Gustav Adolph felt pressured to accept that Alexandra would not convert to Lutheranism, and though he was delighted by the young lady, he refused to appear at the ball and left for Stockholm. The frustration affected Catherine's health. She recovered well enough to begin to plan a ceremony which would establish her favourite grandson Alexander as her heir, superseding her difficult son Paul, but she died before the announcement could be made, just over two months after the engagement ball.\nOn 16 November\u00a0[O.S. 5 November]\u00a01796, Catherine rose early in the morning and had her usual morning coffee, soon settling down to work on papers; she told her lady's maid, Maria Perekusikhina, that she had slept better than she had in a long time. Sometime after 9:00 she was found on the floor with her face purplish, her pulse weak, her breathing shallow and laboured. The court physician diagnosed a stroke and despite attempts to revive her, she fell into a coma. She was given the last rites and died the following evening around 9:45. An autopsy confirmed a stroke as the cause of death.\nLater, several rumours circulated regarding the cause and manner of her death. The most famous of these rumors is that she died after committing bestiality with her horse. This rumor was widely circulated by satirical British and French publications at the time of her death. In his 1647 book \"Beschreibung der muscowitischen und persischen Reise\" (\"Description of the Muscovite and Persian journey\"), German scholar Adam Olearius alleged a supposed Russian tendency towards bestiality with horses. This was repeated in anti-Russian literature throughout the 17th and 18th centuries to illustrate the claimed barbarous Asian nature of Russia.\nCatherine's undated will, discovered in early 1792 among her papers by her secretary Alexander Vasilievich Khrapovitsky, gave specific instructions should she die: \"Lay out my corpse dressed in white, with a golden crown on my head, and on it inscribe my Christian name. Mourning dress is to be worn for six months, and no longer: the shorter the better.\" In the end, the empress was laid to rest with a gold crown on her head and clothed in a silver brocade dress. On 25 November, the coffin, richly decorated in gold fabric, was placed atop an elevated platform at the Grand Gallery's chamber of mourning, designed and decorated by Antonio Rinaldi.\nAccording to \u00c9lisabeth Vig\u00e9e Le Brun:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The empress's body lay in state for six weeks in a large and magnificently decorated room in the castle, which was kept lit day and night. Catherine was stretched on a ceremonial bed surrounded by the coats of arms of all the towns in Russia. Her face was left uncovered, and her fair hand rested on the bed. All the ladies, some of whom took turn to watch by the body, would go and kiss this hand, or at least appear\u00a0to. A description of the empress's funeral is written in Madame Vig\u00e9e Le Brun's memoirs.\nTitle.\nThe Manifesto of 1763 begins with Catherine's full titulature:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;By the expedient grace of God, we, Catherine the Second, Empress and Autocrat of all Russia: of Muscovy, of Kiev, of Vladimir, and of Novgorod; Tsaritsa of Kazan, Tsaritsa of Astrakhan, and Tsaritsa of Siberia; Lady of Pskov and Grand Duchess of Smolensk; Duchess of Estonia and Livonia, of Karelia, of Tver, of Yugra, of Perm, of Vyatka and Bolgharia and others; Lady and Grand Duchess of the lands of Nizhniy Novgorod, of Chernigov, of Ryazan, of Rostov, of Yaroslavl, of Beloozero, of Udoria, of Obdoria, of Kondia, and overlord of the northern territories and sovereign over the lands of Iveria, over the Kartlian and Gruzian tsars and over the land of the Kabardians, over the Circassian and mountain princes, and of others the hereditary sovereign and possessor.\nAnother of her titles was \"Mother of the Fatherland\". She was often simply addressed as \"Mother\" (), sometimes even by the court nobles instead of as \"Your Majesty\".\nArchives.\nEmpress Catherine's correspondence with Frederick II Eugene, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg, (the father of Catherine's daughter-in-law Maria Feodorovna) written between 1768 and 1795, is preserved in the State Archive of Stuttgart (Hauptstaatsarchiv Stuttgart) in Stuttgart, Germany.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral and cited sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "44243", "revid": "15304212", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44243", "title": "Nataraja", "text": "Depiction of Shiva as Lord of the dance\nNataraja (, IAST: ; , \"Na\u1e6dar\u0101jar\"), also known as Adalvallan (), is a depiction of Shiva, one of the main deities in Hinduism, as the divine cosmic dancer. His dance is called the tandava. The pose and artwork are described in many Hindu texts such as the \"Tevaram\" and \"Thiruvasagam\" in Tamil and the \"Amshumadagama\" and \"Uttarakamika agama\" in Sanskrit and the Grantha texts. The dance \"murti\" is featured in all major Hindu temples of Shaivism, and is a well-known sculptural symbol in India and popularly used as a symbol of Indian culture, as one of the finest illustrations of Hindu art. This form is also referred to as Kuththan (), Sabesan (), and Ambalavanan () in various Tamil texts.\nThe sculpture is symbolic of Shiva as the lord of dance and dramatic arts, with its style and proportions made according to Hindu texts on arts. Tamil devotional texts such as the Tirumurai (The twelve books of Southern Shaivism) state that Nataraja is the form of Shiva in which he performs his functions of creation, destruction, preservation, and is also attributed with maya and the act of blessing his devotees. Thus, Nataraja is considered one of the highest forms of Shiva in Tamil Nadu, and the sculpture or the bronze idol of Nataraja is worshipped in almost all Shiva temples across Tamil Nadu. It typically shows Saiva dancing in one of the \"Natya Shastra\" poses, holding various symbols which vary with historic period and region, trampling upon a demon shown as a dwarf (Apasmara or Muyalaka) who symbolizes spiritual ignorance.\nThe classical form of the depiction appears in a pillar of rock cut temple at Seeyamangalam \u2013 Avanibhajana Pallaveshwaram Temple constructed by a Pallava King Mahendravarman I in 6th century CE, which is known by Archeological Survey of India and Archeological Survey of Tamil Nadu as the oldest known Nataraja sculpture in India. The stone reliefs at the Ellora Caves and the Badami Caves, by around the 6th century, are also among the oldest Nataraja sculptures in India. Ancient Tamil songs during the Bhakti movement written by the four Shaivite saints of Sambandar, Appar, Manikkavacakar, and Sundarar, popularly known as \"Nalvar\" (The four) extol Nataraja and describes the Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram as the home of Nataraja as the main deity, dating Nataraja worship way before the 7th century CE. Around the 8th to 10th century, statues emerged in Tamil Nadu in its mature and best-known expression in Chola bronzes, of various heights typically less than four feet, some over. Nataraja reliefs have been found in many parts of South East Asia such as Angkor Wat and in Bali, Cambodia, and Central Asia.\nEtymology.\nThe word Nataraja is a Sanskrit term, from \u0928\u091f \"Nata\" meaning \"act, drama, dance\" and \u0930\u093e\u091c \"Raja\" meaning \"king, lord\"; it can be roughly translated as \"Lord of the dance\" or \"King of the dance\". According to Ananda Coomaraswamy, the name is related to Shiva's fame as the \"Lord of Dancers\" or \"King of Actors\".\nThe form is known as \"Nataraja\" and as \"Narte\u015bvara\" (also written Nateshwar) or \"N\u1e5bitye\u015bvara\", with all three terms meaning \"Lord of the dance\". However, Nataraja and Nateshwar represent different forms of Shiva. \"Narte\u015bvara\" stems from \"N\u1e5btta\" same as \"Nata\" which means \"act, drama, dance\" and \"Ishvara\" meaning \"lord\". \"Natesa\" (IAST: \"Na\u1e6de\u015ba\") is another alternate equivalent term for Nataraja found in 1st-millennium sculptures and archeological sites across the Indian subcontinent.\nIn Tamil, he is also known as \u201c\"Sabesan\"\u201d () which splits as \u201c\"Sabayil adum eesan\"\u201d () which means \u201cThe Lord who dances on the dais\u201d. This form is present in most Shiva temples, and is the prime deity in the Nataraja Temple at Chidambaram (Tillai). The dance of Shiva in Chidambaram forms the motif for all the depictions of Shiva as Nataraja. Koothan(), Sabesan(), Ambalavanan () are other common names of Nataraja in Tamil texts.\nDepiction.\nThe sculpture is symbolic of Shiva as the lord of dance and dramatic arts, with its style and proportions made according to Hindu texts on arts. The two most common forms of Shiva's dance are the \"Lasya\" (the gentle form of dance), associated with the creation of the world, and the \"Ananda Tandava\" (dance of bliss, the vigorous form of dance), associated with the destruction of weary worldviews\u2014weary perspectives and lifestyles. In essence, the Lasya and the Tandava are just two aspects of Shiva's nature; for he destroys in order to create, tearing down to build again.\nAccording to Alice Boner, the historic Nataraja artworks found in different parts of India are set in geometric patterns and along symmetric lines, particularly the \"satkona\" mandala (hexagram) that in the Indian tradition means the interdependence and fusion of masculine and feminine principles.\nIt typically shows Shiva dancing in one of the \"Natya Shastra\" poses, holding Agni (fire) in his left back hand, the front hand in \"gajahasta\" (elephant hand) or \"dandahasta\" (stick hand) mudra, the front right hand with a wrapped snake that is in \"abhaya\" (fear not) mudra while pointing to a \"Sutra\" text, and the back hand holding a musical instrument, usually a \"Udukai\" (). His body, fingers, ankles, neck, face, head, ear lobes and dress are shown decorated with symbolic items, which vary with historic period and region. He is surrounded by a ring of flames, standing on a lotus pedestal, lifting his left leg (or in rare cases, the right leg) and balancing / trampling upon a demon shown as a dwarf (Apasmara or Muyalaka) who symbolizes spiritual ignorance. The dynamism of the energetic dance is depicted with the whirling hair which spread out in thin strands as a fan behind his head. The details in the Nataraja artwork have been variously interpreted by Indian scholars since the 12th century for its symbolic meaning and theological essence. Nataraja is a well known sculptural symbol in India and popularly used as a symbol of Indian culture, in particular as one of the finest illustrations of Hindu art.\nSymbolism.\nThe dance of Nataraja is revealed in a story mentioned in the \"Koyil Puranam\". The symbolism has been interpreted in classical Indian Shaiva Siddhanta texts such as \"Unmai Vilakkam\", \"Mummani Kovai\", \"Tirukuttu Darshana\" and \"Tiruvatavurar Puranam\", dating from the 12th century CE (Chola empire) and later, and include:\nPadma Kaimal questions some of these interpretations by referring to a 10th-century text and Nataraja icons, suggesting that the Nataraja statue may have symbolized different things to different people or in different contexts, such as Shiva being the lord of cremation or as an emblem of Chola dynasty. In contrast, Sharada Srinivasan questions the link to Chola, and has presented archaeological evidence suggesting that Nataraja bronzes and dancing Shiva artwork in South India was a Pallava innovation, tracing back to 7th to 9th-centuries, and its symbolism should be pushed back by a few centuries.\nInterpretation.\nCoomaraswamy summarizes the significance of Shiva's entire dance as an image of his rhythmic or musical play which is the source of all movement within the universe, represented by the arch surrounding Shiva. Secondly, the purpose of his dance is to release the souls of all men from illusion. And third, the place of the dance, Chidambaram, which is portrayed as the center of the universe, is actually within the heart.\nJames Lochtefeld states that Nataraja symbolizes \"the connection between religion and the arts\", and it represents Shiva as the lord of dance, encompassing all \"creation, destruction and all things in between\". The Nataraja iconography incorporates contrasting elements, a fearless celebration of the joys of dance while being surrounded by fire, untouched by forces of ignorance and evil, signifying a spirituality that transcends all duality. Furthermore, Carole and Pasquale note that the deity showcases the eternal cycle of life (Jiva) from death to rebirth, and how a human being should conquer spiritual ignorance and attain self-realization.\nIn the hymn of Manikkavacakar's Thiruvasagam, he testifies that at Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram had, by the pre-Chola period, an abstract or 'cosmic' symbolism linked to five elements (Pancha Bhoota). Nataraja is a significant visual interpretation of Brahman and a dance posture of Shiva. The details in the Nataraja artwork have attracted commentaries and secondary literature such as poems detailing its theological significance. It is one of the widely studied and supreme illustrations of Hindu art from the medieval era.\nSrinivasan notes that Nataraja is described as Satcitananda or \"Being, Consciousness and Bliss\" in the Shaiva Siddhanta text \"Kunchitangrim Bhaje\", resembling the Advaita doctrine, or \"abstract monism\" of Adi Shankara, which holds the individual Self (J\u012bv\u0101tman) and supreme Self (Param\u0101tm\u0101) to be one, while \"an earlier hymn to Nataraja by Manikkavachakar ... identifies him with the unitary supreme consciousness, by using Tamil word '\"Or Unarve\"', rather than Sanskrit \"'chit\"'.\" This may point to an \"osmosis\" of ideas in medieval India.\nAccording to Ian Crawford, professor of planetary science at University of London, the cosmic dance of Shiva as Nataraja represents particle physics, entropy and the dissolution of the universe.\nHistory.\nStone reliefs depicting the classical form of Nataraja are found in numerous cave temples of India, such as at the Ellora Caves (Maharashtra), the Elephanta Caves, and the Badami Caves (Karnataka), by around the 6th century. One of the earliest known Nataraja artworks has been found in the archaeological site at Asanapat village in Odisha, which includes an inscription, and is dated to about the 6th century CE. The Asanapat inscription also mentions a Shiva temple in the Saivacaryas kingdom.\nLiterary evidences shows that the bronze representation of Shiva's ananda-tandava appeared first in the Pallava period between 7th century and mid-9th centuries CE. Nataraja was worshipped at Chidambaram during the Pallava period with underlying philosophical concepts of cosmic cycles of creation and destruction, which is also found in Tamil saint Manikkavacakar's Thiruvasagam.\nArchaeological discoveries have yielded a red Nataraja sandstone statue, from 9th to 10th century from Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh, now held at the Gwalior Archaeological Museum. Similarly, Nataraja artwork has been found in archaeological sites in the Himalayan region such as Kashmir, albeit in with somewhat different dance pose and iconography, such as just two arms or with eight arms.\nAround the 10th century, it emerged in Tamil Nadu in its mature and best-known expression in Chola bronzes, of various heights typically less than four feet. Nataraja reliefs are found in historic settings in many parts of South East Asia such as Ankor Wat, and in Bali, Cambodia, and central Asia. The oldest free-standing stone sculptures of Nataraja were built by Chola queen Sembiyan Mahadevi. Nataraja gained special significance and became a symbol of royalty in Tamil Nadu. The dancing Shiva became a part of Chola era processions and religious festivals, a practice that continued thereafter.\nThe depiction was informed of cosmic or metaphysical connotations is also argued on the basis of the testimony of the hymns of Tamil saints.\nIn medieval era artworks and texts on dancing Shiva found in Nepal, Assam and Bengal, he is sometimes shown as dancing on his \"vahana\" (animal vehicle) Nandi, the bull; further, he is regionally known as \"Narteshvara\". Nataraja artwork have also been discovered in Gujarat, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh. In the contemporary Hindu culture of Bali in Indonesia, Siwa (Shiva) Nataraja is the god who created dance. Siwa and his dance as Nataraja was also celebrated in the art of Java Indonesia when Hinduism thrived there, while in Cambodia he was referred to as \"Nrittesvara\".\nIn 2004, a 2 meter statue of the dancing Shiva was unveiled at CERN, the European Center for Research in Particle Physics in Geneva. The statue, symbolizing Shiva's cosmic dance of creation and destruction, was given to CERN by the Indian government to celebrate the research center's long association with India. A special plaque next to the Shiva statue explains the metaphor of Shiva's cosmic dance with quotations from physicist Fritjof Capra:\nHundreds of years ago, Indian artists created visual images of dancing Shivas in a beautiful series of bronzes. In our time, physicists have used the most advanced technology to portray the patterns of the cosmic dance. The metaphor of the cosmic dance thus unifies ancient mythology, religious art and modern physics.\nThough named \"Nataraja bronzes\" in Western literature, the Chola Nataraja artworks are mostly in copper, and a few are in brass, typically cast by the \"cire-perdue\" (lost-wax casting) process.\nNataraja is celebrated in 108 poses of Bharatanatyam, with Sanskrit inscriptions from \"Natya Shastra\", at the Nataraja temple in Chidambaram, Tamil Nadu, India.\nIn dance and yoga.\nIn modern yoga as exercise, Natarajasana is a posture resembling Nataraja and named for him in the 20th century. A similar pose appears in the classical Indian dance form Bharatanatyam.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "44245", "revid": "43009163", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44245", "title": "Ramayana", "text": "Ancient Sanskrit epic\nThe Ramayana (; ), also known as the Valmiki Ramayana or Tulsidas Ramayana, as traditionally attributed to Valmiki, is a smriti text (also described as a Sanskrit epic) from ancient India, one of the two important epics of Hinduism known as the \"Itihasas\", the other being the \"Mahabharata\". The epic narrates the life of Rama, the seventh \"avatar\" of the Hindu deity Vishnu, who was a prince of Ayodhya in the kingdom of Kosala. The epic follows his fourteen-year exile to the forest urged by his father King Dasharatha, on the request of Rama's stepmother Kaikeyi; his travels across the forests in the Indian subcontinent with his wife Sita and brother Lakshmana; the kidnapping of Sita by Ravana, the king of Lanka, that resulted in bloodbath; and Rama's eventual return to Ayodhya along with Sita to be crowned as a king amidst jubilation and celebration.\nScholarly estimates for the earliest stage of the text range from the 7th\u20135th to 5th\u20134th century BCE, and later stages extend up to the 3rd century CE, although the original date of composition is unknown. It is one of the largest ancient epics in world literature and consists of nearly 24,000 shlokas (verses), divided into seven (chapters). Each shloka is a couplet (two individual lines). The Ramayana belongs to the genre of \"Itihasa\", narratives of past events (), interspersed with teachings on the goals of human life.\nThere are many versions of the \"Ramayana\" in Indian languages, including Buddhist and Jain adaptations. There are also Cambodian (\"Reamker\"), Malay (\"Hikayat Seri Rama\"), Filipino, Thai (\"Ramakien\"), Lao, Burmese, Nepali, Maldivian, Vietnamese, and Tibeto-Chinese versions of the Ramayana.\nThe \"Ramayana\" was an important influence on later Sanskrit poetry and the Hindu life and culture, and its main figures were fundamental to the cultural consciousness of a number of nations, both Hindu and Buddhist. Its most important moral influence was the importance of virtue, in the life of a citizen and in the ideals of the formation of a state (from , a utopian state where Rama is king) or of a functioning society.\nEtymology.\nThe name is composed of two words, and \"travel, journey\", with the grammatical internal sandhi \"joining\" of the final short \"a\" in \"R\u0101ma\" and the initial short \"a\" in \"ayana\" to the longer form \"\u0101\". , the name of the main figure of the epic, has two contextual meanings. In the Atharvaveda, it means \"dark-coloured or black\" and is related to the word \"the darkness or stillness of night\". The other meaning, which can be found in the \"Mahabharata\", is \"pleasing, pleasant, charming, lovely, beautiful\". Thus, means \"Rama's journey\".\nDating.\nScholarly estimates of the earliest stage of the available text range from the 7th\u20135th to 5th-4th centuries BCE, with later stages extending to the 3rd century CE. According to Robert P. Goldman (1984), the oldest parts of the \"Ramayana\" date to the early 7th century BCE. Goldman states that the core portions could not have been composed later than the 6th or 5th century BCE, as the narrative neither mentions Buddhism (founded in the 5th century BCE) nor reflects the later prominence of Magadha (which rose to power in the 7th century BCE). The text also mentions Ayodhya as the capital of Kosala, rather than its later name of Saketa or its successor capital of Shravasti. In terms of narrative time, the action of the \"Ramayana\" predates the \"Mahabharata\". consider the Ramayana's oldest surviving version was composed around 500 BCE.\nBooks two to six are the oldest portion of the epic, while the first and last books (\"Balakanda\" and \"Uttara Kanda\", respectively) are considered to be later additions. Style differences and narrative contradictions between these two volumes and the rest of the epic have led scholars including Hermann Jacobi toward this consensus.\nTextual characteristics.\nGenre.\nThe \"Ramayana\" belongs to the genre of \"Itihasa\", narratives of past events (), which includes the epics \"Mahabharata\" and \"Ramayana\", and the \"Puranas\". The genre also includes teachings on the goals of human life. It depicts the duties of relationships, portraying ideal characters like the ideal son, servant, brother, husband, wife, and king. Like the \"Mahabharata\", \"Ramayana\" presents the teachings of ancient Hindu sages in the narrative allegory, interspersing philosophical and ethical elements.\nStructure.\nIn its extant form, Valmiki's \"Ramayana\" is an epic poem containing over 24,000 couplet verses, divided into seven s (B\u0101lak\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da, Ayodhyak\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da, Ara\u1e47yak\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da, Ki\u1e63kindak\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da, Sundar\u0101k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da, Yuddhak\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da, Uttarak\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da), and about 500 sargas (chapters). It is regarded as one of the longest epic poems ever written.\nRecensions.\nThe \"Ramayana\" text has several regional renderings, recensions, and sub-recensions. Textual scholar Robert P. Goldman differentiates two major regional revisions: the northern (n) and the southern (s). Scholar Romesh Chunder Dutt writes that \"the \"Ramayana\", like the \"Mahabharata\", is a growth of centuries, but the main story is more distinctly the creation of one mind.\"\nThere has been discussion as to whether the first and the last volumes of Valmiki's \"Ramayana\" (Bala Kanda and Uttara Kanda) were composed by the original author. Though Bala Kanda is sometimes considered in the main epic, according to many Uttara Kanda is certainly a later interpolation, not attributable to Valmiki. Both of these two k\u0101ndas are absent in the oldest manuscript.\nSome think that the Uttara Kanda contradicts how Rama and Dharma are portrayed in the rest of the epic. M. R. Parameswaran says that the way the positions of women and Shudras are depicted shows that the Uttara Kanda is a later insertion.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Since Rama was revered as a dharmatma, his ideas seen in the Ramayana proper cannot be replaced by new ideas as to what dharma is, except by claiming that he himself adopted those new ideas. That is what the U-K [Uttara Kanda] does. It embodies the new ideas in two stories that are usually referred to as Sita-parityaga, the abandonment of Sita (after Rama and Sita return to Ayodhya and Rama was consecrated as king) and Sambuka-vadha, the killing of the ascetic Sambuka. The U-K attributes both actions to Rama, whom people acknowledged to be righteous and as a model to follow. By masquerading as an additional kanda of the Ramayana composed by Valmiki himself, the U-K succeeded, to a considerable extent, in sabotaging the values presented in Valmiki's Ramayana.\nSynopsis.\n\"B\u0101la K\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da\".\nThe epic begins with the sage V\u0101lm\u012bki asking N\u0101rada if there is a righteous man still left in the world, to which N\u0101rada replies that such a man is R\u0101ma. After seeing two birds being shot, V\u0101lm\u012bki creates a new form of metre called \"\u015bloka\", in which he is granted the ability to compose an epic poem about R\u0101ma. He teaches his poem to the boys Lava and Ku\u015ba, who recite it throughout the land and eventually at the court of King R\u0101ma. Then the main narrative begins.\nDa\u015baratha is the King of Ayodhy\u0101. He has three wives: Kausaly\u0101, Kaikey\u012b, and Sumitr\u0101. He does not have a son and, in the desire to have a legal heir, he performs a fire sacrifice known as Putr\u012by\u0101 I\u1e63\u1e6di. Meanwhile, the gods are petitioning to Brahm\u0101 and Vi\u1e63h\u1e47u about R\u0101va\u1e47a, king of the r\u0101k\u1e63asas who is terrorizing the universe. Thus Vi\u1e63h\u1e47u opts to be born into mortality to combat the demon R\u0101va\u1e47a. As a consequence, R\u0101ma is first born to Kausaly\u0101, Bharata is born to Kaikey\u012b, and Lak\u1e63ma\u1e47a and \u015aatrughna are born to Sumitr\u0101.\nWhen R\u0101ma is 16 years old, the r\u0325\u1e63i (sage) Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra comes to the court of Da\u015baratha seeking help against demons who are disturbing sacrificial rites. He chooses R\u0101ma, who is followed by Lak\u1e63ma\u1e47a, his constant companion throughout the story. R\u0101ma and Lak\u1e63ma\u1e47a receive instructions and supernatural weapons from Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra and proceed to destroy T\u0101\u1e6dak\u0101 and many other demons. Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra also recounts much lore of the landscape, his own ancestors, and the ancestors of the princes.\nThe party then decides to attend King Janaka's sacrifice in the kingdom of Mithil\u0101, who has a bow that no one has been able to string. Janaka recounts the history of the famed bow, and informs them that whoever strings the bow will win the hand of his daughter S\u012bt\u0101, whom he found in the earth while plowing a field. R\u0101ma then proceeds to string the bow, but he breaks it in the process. R\u0101ma marries S\u012bt\u0101; the wedding is celebrated with great festivity in Mithil\u0101 and the marriage party returns to Ayodhy\u0101.\n\"Ayodhy\u0101 K\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da\".\nAfter R\u0101ma and S\u012bt\u0101 are married, an elderly Da\u015baratha expresses his desire to crown R\u0101ma, to which the Kosala assembly and his subjects express their support. On the eve of the great event, Kaikey\u012b is happy regarding this but later is provoked by Manthar\u0101, a wicked maidservant, to claim two boons that Da\u015baratha has granted to her. Kaikey\u012b demands R\u0101ma to be exiled into the wilderness for fourteen years, while the succession passes to her son Bharata.\nThe grief-stricken king, bound by his word, accedes to Kaikey\u012b's demands. R\u0101ma accepts his father's reluctant decree with absolute submission and calm self-control which characterizes him throughout the story. He asks S\u012bt\u0101 to remain in Ayodhy\u0101, but she convinces him to take her with him into exile. Lak\u1e63ma\u1e47a also resolves to follow his brother into the forest.\nAfter R\u0101ma's departure, King Da\u015baratha, unable to bear the grief, passes away. Meanwhile, Bharata, who is on a visit to his maternal uncle, learns about the events in Ayodhy\u0101. He is shocked and refuses to profit from his mother's wicked scheming. He visits R\u0101ma in the forest and implores him to return to Ayodhy\u0101 and claim the throne that is rightfully his, but R\u0101ma, determined to carry out his father's orders to the letter, refuses to return before the period of exile. Bharata reluctantly returns to Ayodhy\u0101 and rules the kingdom on behalf of his brother.\n\"Ara\u1e47ya K\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da\".\nIn exile, R\u0101ma, S\u012bt\u0101, and Lak\u1e63ma\u1e47a journey southward along the banks of the river God\u0101vari, where they build cottages and live off the land. One day, in the Pa\u00f1cavati forest they are visited by a r\u0101k\u1e63as\u012b named \u015aurpa\u1e47akh\u0101, sister of Rava\u1e47a. She tries to seduce the brothers and, after failing, attempts to kill S\u012bt\u0101 out of jealousy. Lak\u1e63ma\u1e47a stops her by cutting off her nose and ears. Hearing of this, her brothers Khara and Dushan organize an attack against the princes. Rama defeats Khara and his \"rak\u1e63as\u012bs\".\nWhen the news of these events reaches R\u0101va\u1e47a, he resolves to destroy R\u0101ma by capturing S\u012bt\u0101 with the aid of the \"rak\u1e63asa\" M\u0101r\u012bca, who, assuming the form of a golden deer, captivates S\u012bt\u0101's attention. Entranced by the beauty of the deer, S\u012bt\u0101 pleads with R\u0101ma to capture it. R\u0101ma, aware that this is the ploy of the demons, cannot dissuade S\u012bt\u0101 from her desire and chases the deer into the forest, leaving S\u012bt\u0101 under Lak\u1e63ma\u1e47a's guard.\nAfter some time, S\u012bt\u0101 hears R\u0101ma calling out to her; afraid for his life, she insists that Lak\u1e63ma\u1e47a rush to his aid. Lak\u1e63ma\u1e47a tries to assure her that R\u0101ma cannot be hurt that easily and that it is best if he continues to follow R\u0101ma's orders to protect her. On the verge of hysterics, S\u012bt\u0101 insists that it is not she but R\u0101ma who needs Lak\u1e63ma\u1e47a's help. He obeys her wish but stipulates that she is not to leave the cottage or entertain any stranger. He then draws a line that no demon could cross and leaves to help R\u0101ma. With the coast finally clear, R\u0101va\u1e47a appears in the guise of an ascetic requesting S\u012bt\u0101's hospitality. Unaware of her guest's plan, S\u012bt\u0101 is tricked and is then forcibly carried away by R\u0101va\u1e47a.\nJat\u0101yu, a vulture, tries to rescue S\u012bt\u0101 but is mortally wounded. In Lank\u0101, S\u012bt\u0101 is kept under the guard of \"rak\u1e63as\u012bs\". Rava\u1e47a asks S\u012bt\u0101 to marry him, but she refuses, being totally devoted to R\u0101ma. Meanwhile, R\u0101ma and Lak\u1e63ma\u1e47a learn about S\u012bt\u0101's abduction from Jat\u0101yu and immediately set out to save her. During their search, they meet Kabandha and the ascetic \u015aabar\u012b, who directs them to Sugriva and Hanuman.\n\"Ki\u1e63kindh\u0101 K\u0101\u1e47da\".\n\"Kishkindha Kanda\" is set in the land of V\u0101naras (Vana-nara) \u2013 Forest dwelling humans. R\u0101ma and Lak\u1e63ma\u1e47a meet Hanum\u0101n, the biggest devotee of R\u0101ma, greatest of ape heroes, and an adherent of Sugriva, the banished pretender to the throne of Ki\u1e63kindh\u0101. R\u0101ma befriends Sugriva and helps him by killing his elder brother V\u0101li thus regaining the kingdom of Ki\u1e63kindh\u0101, in exchange for helping R\u0101ma to recover S\u012bt\u0101.\nHowever, Sugriva soon forgets his promise and spends his time enjoying his newly gained power. The clever former ape queen T\u0101r\u0101, (wife of V\u0101li) calmly intervenes to prevent an enraged Lak\u1e63ma\u1e47a from destroying the ape citadel. She then eloquently convinces Sugriva to honour his pledge. Sugriva then sends search parties to the four corners of the earth, only to return without success from the north, east, and west. The southern search party under the leadership of A\u1e45gada and Hanum\u0101n learns from a vulture named Samp\u0101t\u012b the elder brother of Jat\u0101yu, that S\u012bt\u0101 was taken to Lank\u0101.\n\"Sundara K\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da\".\n\"Sundara Kanda\" forms the heart of Valmiki's Ramayana and consists of a detailed, vivid account of Hanum\u0101n's heroics. After learning about S\u012bt\u0101, Hanum\u0101n assumes a gigantic form and makes a colossal leap across the sea to Lanka. On the way, he meets many challenges like facing a Gandharva Kany\u0101 who comes in the form of a demon to test his abilities. He encounters a mountain named Main\u0101ka who offers Hanuman assistance and a place to rest. Hanum\u0101n refuses because there is little time remaining to complete the search for S\u012bt\u0101.\nAfter entering Lank\u0101, he finds a demon, Lankini, who protects all of Lank\u0101. Hanum\u0101n fights her and subjugates her in order to get into Lank\u0101. In the process, Lankini, who had an earlier vision or warning from the gods, knows that Lank\u0101's end is near if someone defeats Lankini. Here, Hanum\u0101n explores the demons' kingdom and spies on R\u0101va\u1e47a. He locates S\u012bt\u0101 in the Ashoka grove, where she is being wooed and threatened by R\u0101va\u1e47a and his \"rak\u1e63as\u012bs\" to marry him.\nHanum\u0101n reassures S\u012bt\u0101, giving her R\u0101ma's signet ring as a sign that R\u0101ma is still alive. He offers to carry S\u012bt\u0101 back to R\u0101ma; however, she refuses and says that it is not the dharma, stating that Ram\u0101ya\u1e47a will not have significance if Hanum\u0101n carries her to R\u0101ma \u2013 \"When R\u0101ma was not there, R\u0101va\u1e47a carried S\u012bt\u0101 forcibly and when R\u0101va\u1e47a was not there, Hanum\u0101n carried S\u012bt\u0101 back to R\u0101ma.\" She says that R\u0101ma himself must come and avenge the insult of her abduction. She gives Hanum\u0101n her comb as a token to prove that she is still alive.\nHanum\u0101n takes leave of S\u012bt\u0101. Before going back to R\u0101ma and telling him about S\u012bt\u0101's location and desire to be rescued only by him, he decides to wreak havoc in Lank\u0101 by destroying trees in the Naulakha Bagh and buildings and killing R\u0101va\u1e47a's warriors. He allows himself to be captured and delivered to R\u0101va\u1e47a. He gives a bold lecture to R\u0101va\u1e47a urging him to release S\u012bta. He is condemned and his tail is set on fire, but he escapes his bonds and leaps across the rooftops, sets fire to R\u0101va\u1e47a's citadel, and makes the giant leap back from the island. The joyous search party returns to Ki\u1e63kindh\u0101 with the news.\n\"Yuddha K\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da\".\nAlso known as \"Lank\u0101 K\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da\", this book describes the war between the army of R\u0101ma (Vanara) and the army of R\u0101va\u1e47a (Rakshasa). Having received Hanuman's report on S\u012bt\u0101, R\u0101ma and Lak\u1e63ma\u1e47a proceed with their allies towards the shore of the southern sea. There they are joined by R\u0101va\u1e47a's renegade brother Vibhi\u1e63a\u1e47a. The v\u0101naras named Nala and N\u012bla construct the Rama Setu.\nThe princes and their army cross over to Lanka. A lengthy war ensues. During a battle, Ravana's son Meghan\u0101da hurls a powerful weapon at Lak\u1e63ma\u1e47a who is mortally wounded. So Hanum\u0101n assumes his gigantic form and flies from Lank\u0101 to the Himalayas. Upon reaching, Hanum\u0101n is unable to identify the sanjeevani herb that will cure Lak\u1e63ma\u1e47a and so he decides to bring the entire mountain back to Lank\u0101. Eventually, the war ends when R\u0101ma kills R\u0101va\u1e47a. R\u0101ma then installs Vibhisha\u1e47a on the throne of Lanka.\nOn meeting S\u012bt\u0101, R\u0101ma says; \"The dishonour meted out to him and the wrong done to her by R\u0101va\u1e47a have been wiped off by his victory over the enemy with the assistance of Hanum\u0101n, Sugr\u012bva and Vibhisha\u1e47a\". However, upon criticism from people in his kingdom about the chastity of S\u012bt\u0101, R\u0101ma is extremely disheartened.\nSo S\u012bt\u0101, in order to prove the citizens wrong and wipe the false blame on her, requests R\u0101ma and Lak\u1e63ma\u1e47a to prepare a pyre for her to enter. When Lak\u1e63ma\u1e47a prepares the pyre, S\u012bt\u0101 prays to Agni and enters it in order to prove her conjugal fidelity. Agni appears in person from the burning pyre, carrying S\u012bt\u0101 in his arms and restores her to R\u0101ma, testifying to her purity. Rama later joyfully accepts her. The episode of \"Agni Pariksha\" varies in the versions of \"Ram\u0101ya\u1e47a\" by Valmiki and Tulsidas. In Tulsidas's \"Ramcharitmanas\", S\u012bt\u0101 was under the protection of Agni (see M\u0101y\u0101 S\u012bt\u0101) so it was necessary to bring her out before reuniting with R\u0101ma. The gods led by Brahma arrive and glorify Rama as the incarnation of Supreme God Narayana. Indra restores the dead Vanaras back to life.\nAfter the exile, R\u0101ma returns to Ayodhya and the people are so happy that they celebrate it like a festival. Deepavali is the day celebrating when R\u0101ma, S\u012bt\u0101, Lak\u1e63ma\u1e47a and Hanum\u0101n reached Ayodhy\u0101 after a period of 14 years in exile after R\u0101ma's army of good defeated demon king R\u0101va\u1e47a's army of evil. The return of R\u0101ma to Ayodhy\u0101 is celebrated with his coronation. It is called \"R\u0101ma pattabhisheka\". There are mentions in R\u0101maya\u1e47a that Rama gave several donations to Sugriva, Jambavan, other Vanaras, and gave a pearl necklace to Sita telling her to give it to a great person. She gives it to Hanum\u0101n. R\u0101ma is very thankful to Vibhisa\u1e47a and wants to give him a great gift. R\u0101ma gives his Aradhana Devata (Sri Ranganathaswamy) to Vibhishana as a gift. Rama's rule itself, \"R\u0101ma r\u0101jya\", is described as just and fair. It is believed by many that when Rama returned, people celebrated their happiness with \"diyas\", and the festival of Deepavali is connected with R\u0101ma's return.\n\"Uttara Kanda\".\nScholars note \"linguistic and rhetorical differences\" between the Uttara Kanda and books 2 through 6 of the Ramayana, especially in stories such as Sita's exile and the death of Shambuka, and together with Bala Kanda it is considered by some scholars to be an interpolation, and that \"the 'original' poem ended with the Yuddhakanda.\nThis kanda narrates Rama's reign in Ayodhya, the birth of Lava and Kusha, the Ashvamedha yajna, and the last days of Rama. At the expiration of his term of exile, Rama returns to Ayodhya with Sita, Lakshmana, and Hanuman, where the coronation is performed. On being asked to prove his devotion to Rama, Hanuman tears his chest open and to everyone's surprise, there is an image of Rama and Sita inside his chest. Rama rules Ayodhya and the reign is called \"Rama-Rajya\" (a place where the common folk are happy, fulfilled, and satisfied). Then Valmiki trained Lava and Kusha in archery and succeeded to the throne after Rama.\nVersions.\nAs in many oral epics, multiple versions of the \"Ramayana\" survive. In particular, the \"Ramayana\" related in north India differs in important respects from that preserved in south India and the rest of southeast Asia. There is an extensive tradition of oral storytelling based on \"Ramayana\" in Indonesia, Cambodia, Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Laos, Vietnam and Maldives.\nIndia.\nThere are diverse regional versions of the \"Ramayana\" written by various authors in India. Some of them differ significantly from each other. A West Bengal manuscript from the 6th century presents the epic without two of its kandas.\nDuring the 12th century, Kamban wrote Ramavataram, known popularly as Kambaramayanam in Tamil, but references to Ramayana story appear in Tamil literature as early as 3rd century CE. The Telugu rendition, Ranganatha Ramayanam, was written by Gona Budda Reddy in the 13th century and another of a purer Telugu rendition, called \"Molla Ramayanam\" written by Atukuri Molla in the 15th century.\nThe earliest translation to a regional Indo-Aryan language is the 14th-15th century Saptakanda Ramayana in Assamese by Madhava Kandali. Valmiki's \"Ramayana\" inspired Sri Ramacharit Manas by Tulsidas in 1576, an epic in Awadhi Hindi with a slant more grounded in a different realm of Hindu literature, that of bhakti; it is an acknowledged masterpiece, popularly known as \"Tulsi-krita Ramayana\". Gujarati poet Premanand wrote a version of the \"Ramayana\" in the 17th century. Akbar, the third Mughal Emperor, commissioned a simplified text of the Ramayana which he dedicated to his mother, Hamida Banu Begum. Created around 1594, the manuscript is illustrated with scenes from the narrative.\nOther versions include Krittivasi Ramayan, a Bengali version by 14th century Bengali poet Krittibas Ojha in the early 15th century; Vilanka Ramayana by 15th century poet Sarala Dasa and \"Jagamohana Ramayana\" (also known as \"Dandi Ramayana\") by 15th century poet Balarama Dasa, both in Odia; a Torave Ramayana in Kannada by 16th-century poet Narahari; Adhyathmaramayanam, a Malayalam version by Thunchaththu Ramanujan Ezhuthachan in the 16th century; in Marathi by Sridhara in the 18th century; in Maithili by Chanda Jha in the 19th century; and in the 20th century, Rashtrakavi Kuvempu's Sri Ramayana Darshanam in Kannada and Srimadramayana Kalpavrukshamu in Telugu by Viswanatha Satyanarayana who received Jnanapeeth award for this work.\nThere is a sub-plot to the \"Ramayana\", prevalent in some parts of India, relating the adventures of Ahiravan and Mahi Ravana, evil brother of Ravana, which enhances the role of Hanuman in the story. Hanuman rescues Rama and Lakshmana after they are kidnapped by the Ahi-Mahi Ravana at the behest of Ravana and held prisoner in a cave, to be sacrificed to the goddess Kali. Adbhuta Ramayana is a version that is obscure but also attributed to Valmiki \u2013 intended as a supplementary to the original Valmiki Ramayana. In this variant of the narrative, Sita is accorded far more prominence, such as elaboration of the events surrounding her birth \u2013 in this case to Ravana's wife, Mandodari as well as her conquest of Ravana's older brother in the Mahakali form.\nThe Gondi people have their own version of the Ramayana known as the \"Gond Ramayani\", derived from oral folk legends. It consists of seven stories with Lakshmana as the protagonist, set after the main events of the Ramayana, where he finds a bride.\nIn \"Adiya Ramayana,\" an oral version of Ramayana prevailing among the Adiya tribe of Wayanad, Sita is an Adiya woman hailing from Pulpally in Wayanad. A notable difference in the version is that the Rama, Lakshmana and Hanuman were tied to a tree and were brought to trial in the tribal court, where the deities of the clan Sidhappan, Nanjappan, Mathappan etc. interrogate them with intense inquiries regarding the ethical justification for abandoning his pregnant wife in the barren jungle, neglecting his duties as a husband. Rama admits his mistakes and reaccepts Sita, Lava and Kusha.\nEarly references in Tamil literature.\nEven before Kambar wrote the Ramavataram in Tamil in the 12th century CE, there are many ancient references to the story of Ramayana, implying that the story was familiar in the Tamil lands even before the Common Era. References to the story can be found in the Sangam literature of Akana\u1e49\u016b\u1e5fu (dated 1st century BCE) and Purananuru (dated 300 BC), the twin epics of Silappatikaram (dated 2nd century CE) and Manimekalai (cantos 5, 17 and 18), and the Alvar literature of Kulasekhara Alvar, Thirumangai Alvar, Andal and Nammalvar (dated between 5th and 10th centuries CE). Even the songs of the Nayanmars have references to Ravana and his devotion to Lord Siva.\nThe entire Ramayana was rewritten as a Tamil Opera in the 18th century CE by Arunachala Kavirayar in Srirangam, this opera, named the \"Rama Natakam,\" allowed access to those who could not read the original version.\nBuddhist version.\nIn the Buddhist variant of the \"Ramayana\" (Dasaratha Jataka), Dasharatha was king of Benares and not Ayodhya. Rama (called R\u0101mapa\u1e47\u1e0dita in this version) was the son of Kaushalya, first wife of Dasharatha. Lak\u1e63ma\u1e47a (Lakkha\u1e47a) was a sibling of Rama and son of Sumitra, the second wife of Dasharatha. Sita was the wife of Rama. To protect his children from his wife Kaikeyi, who wished to promote her son Bharata, Dasharatha sent the three to a hermitage in the Himalayas for a twelve-year exile.\nAfter nine years, Dasharatha died and Lakkha\u1e47a and Sita returned. R\u0101mapa\u1e47\u1e0dita, in deference to his father's wishes, remained in exile for a further two years. This version does not include the abduction of S\u012bt\u0101. There is no Ravana in this version, or the Rama-Ravana war. However, Ravana appears in other Buddhist literature, the Lankavatara Sutra.\nIn the explanatory commentary on J\u0101taka, R\u0101mapa\u1e47\u1e0dita is said to have been a previous birth of the Buddha, and Sita as previous birth of Yasodhar\u0101 (Rahula-Mata).\nJain versions.\nVimalsuri was a Jain monk of the \u015avet\u0101mbara Murtipujaka sect. He is best known for his composition \"Paumachariyam\", the earliest known Jain version of the Ramayana and the oldest work of literature written in Maharashtri Prakrit. Jain versions of the \"Ramayana\" can also be found in the various Jain agamas like Sa\u1e45ghad\u0101saga\u1e47\u012b V\u0101chaka's \"Vasudevahi\u1e47\u1e0d\u012b\" (circa 4th century CE), Ravisena's Padmapurana (story of Padmaja and Rama, Padmaja being the name of Sita), Hemacandra's Trisastisalakapurusa charitra (hagiography of 63 illustrious persons), Sanghadasa's \"Vasudevahindi\" and \"Uttarapurana\" by Gunabhadara. According to Jain cosmology, every half time cycle has nine sets of Balarama, Vasudeva and prativasudeva.\nRama, Lakshmana and Ravana are the eighth Baldeva, Vasudeva and Prativasudeva respectively. Padmanabh Jaini notes that, unlike in the Hindu Puranas, the names Baladeva and Vasudeva are not restricted to Balarama and Krishna in Jain Puranas. Instead they serve as names of two distinct classes of mighty brothers, who appear nine times in each half time cycle and jointly rule half the earth as half-chakravartins. Jaini traces the origin of this list of brothers to the \"jinacharitra\" (lives of jinas) by Acharya Bhadrabahu (3d\u20134th century BCE).\nIn the Jain epic of \"Ramayana\", it is not Rama who kills Ravana as told in the Hindu version. Perhaps this is because Rama, a liberated Jain Self in his last life, is unwilling to kill. Instead, it is Lakshmana who kills Ravana (as Vasudeva killes Prativasudeva). In the end, Rama, who led an upright life, renounces his kingdom, becomes a Jain monk and attains moksha. On the other hand, Lakshmana and Ravana go to Hell. However, it is predicted that ultimately they both will be reborn as upright persons and attain liberation in their future births. According to Jain texts, Ravana will be the future Tirthankara (omniscient teacher) of Jainism.\nThe Jain versions have some variations from Valmiki's \"Ramayana\". Dasharatha, the king of Ayodhya had four queens: Aparajita, Sumitra, Suprabha and Kaikeyi. These four queens had four sons. Aparajita's son was Padma and he became known by the name of Rama. Sumitra's son was Narayana: he came to be known by another name, Lakshmana. Kaikeyi's son was Bharata and Suprabha's son was Shatrughna. Furthermore, not much was thought of Rama's fidelity to Sita. According to the Jain version, Rama had four chief queens: Maithili, Prabhavati, Ratinibha, and Sridama.\nFurthermore, Sita takes renunciation as a Jain ascetic after Rama abandons her and is reborn in heaven as Indra. Rama, after Lakshman's death, also renounces his kingdom and becomes a Jain monk. Ultimately, he attains Kevala Jnana omniscience and finally liberation. Rama predicts that Ravana and Lakshmana, who were in the fourth hell, will attain liberation in their future births. Accordingly, Ravana is the future Tirthankara of the next half ascending time cycle and Sita will be his Ganadhara.\nSoutheast Asian.\nIndonesia.\nThere are several Indonesian adaptations of Ramayana, including the Javanese \"Kakawin Ramayana\" and Balinese \"Ramakavaca\". The first half of \"Kakawin Ramayana\" is similar to the original Sanskrit version, while the latter half is very different. One of the recognizable modifications is the inclusion of the indigenous Javanese guardian demigod, Semar, and his sons, Gareng, Petruk, and Bagong who make up the numerically significant four Punokawan or \"clown servants\".\n\"Kakawin Ramayana\" is believed to have been written in Central Java circa 870 AD during the reign of Mpu Sindok in the Mataram kingdom. The Javanese \"Kakawin Ramayana\" is not based on Valmiki's epic, which was then the most famous version of Rama's story, but based on \"Ravanavadha\" or the \"Ravana massacre,\" which is the sixth or seventh century poem by Indian poet Bhattikavya.\n\"Kakawin Ramayana\" was further developed on the neighboring island of Bali becoming the Balinese \"Ramakavaca\". The bas-reliefs of \"Ramayana\" and \"Krishnayana\" scenes are carved on balustrades of the 9th century Prambanan temple in Yogyakarta, as well as in the 14th century Penataran temple in East Java. In Indonesia, the Ramayana is a deeply ingrained aspect of the culture, especially among Javanese, Balinese and Sundanese people, and has become the source of moral and spiritual guidance as well as aesthetic expression and entertainment, for example in wayang and traditional dances.\nThe Balinese \"kecak\" dance for example, retells the story of the Ramayana, with dancers playing the roles of Rama, Sita, Lakhsmana, Jatayu, Hanuman, Ravana, Kumbhakarna and Indrajit surrounded by a troupe of over 50 bare-chested men who serve as the chorus chanting \"cak\". The performance also includes a fire show to describe the burning of Lanka by Hanuman. In Yogyakarta, the \"Wayang Wong\" Javanese dance also retells the Ramayana. One example of a dance production of the Ramayana in Java is the Ramayana Ballet performed on the Trimurti Prambanan open air stage, with dozens of actors and the three main prasad spires of the Prambanan Hindu temple as a backdrop.\nMalaysia.\nThe Malay adaptation of the Ramayana, also known as the Hikayat Seri Rama, incorporates elements of both Hindu mythology and Islamic mythology.\nMyanmar (Burma).\nThe Burmese adaptation of the Ramayana is known as the Yama Zatdaw.\nPhilippines.\nThe \"Maharadia Lawana\", an epic poem of the Maranao people of the Philippines, has been regarded as an indigenized version of the Ramayana since it was documented and translated into English by Professor Juan R. Francisco and Nagasura Madale in 1968. The poem, which had not been written down before Francisco and Madale's translation, narrates the adventures of the monkey-king, Maharadia Lawana, to whom the Gods have granted immortality.\nFrancisco, an indologist from the University of the Philippines Manila, believed that the \"Ramayana\" narrative arrived in the Philippines some time between the 17th to 19th centuries, via interactions with Javanese and Malaysian cultures which traded extensively with India.\nBy the time it was documented in the 1960s, the character names, place names, and the precise episodes and events in Maharadia Lawana's narrative already had some notable differences from those of the \"Ramayana\". Francisco believed that this was a sign of \"indigenization\", and suggested that some changes had already been introduced in Malaysia and Java even before the story was heard by the Maranao, and that upon reaching the Maranao homeland, the story was \"further indigenized to suit Philippine cultural perspectives and orientations.\"\nThailand.\nThailand's popular national epic \"Ramakien\" (, from , 'glory of Ram') is derived from the Hindu epic. In , Sita is the daughter of Ravana and Mandodari ( and ). Vibhishana (), the astrologer brother of Ravana, predicts the death of Ravana from Sita's horoscope. Ravana throws her into the water, but she is later rescued by Janaka ().\nWhile the main story is identical to that of \"Ramayana\", many other aspects were transposed into a Thai context, such as the clothes, weapons, topography and elements of nature, which are described as being Thai in style. It has an expanded role for Hanuman and he is portrayed as a lascivious character. Ramakien can be seen in an elaborate illustration at Wat Phra Kaew in Bangkok.\nCritical edition.\nA critical edition of the text was compiled in India in the 1960s and 1970s, by the Oriental Institute at Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda, India, utilizing dozens of manuscripts collected from across India and the surrounding region. An English language translation of the critical edition was completed in November 2016 by Sanskrit scholar Robert P. Goldman of the University of California, Berkeley.\nAnother English translation of the critical edition of the Valmiki Ramayana was done by the late Mr. Bibek Debroy.\nCommentaries.\nThere are around thirty three commentaries on the Ramayana. Some of the commentaries on the Ramayana include-\nThe three commentaries ', ' and ' are known as ' (i.e. commentary trio) and are more popular.\nInfluence.\nHolidays.\nVijayadashami.\nVijayadashami is a major Hindu festival celebrated every year at the end of Durga Puja and Navaratri.\nDiwali.\nDiwali, the festival of lights in Hinduism, is celebrated in joy of Lord Rama returning to Ayodhya with his wife Sita and brother Lakshmana.\nIn art.\nOne of the most important literary works of ancient India, the \"Ramayana\" has had a profound impact on art and culture in the Indian subcontinent and southeast Asia with the lone exception of Vietnam. The story ushered in the tradition of the next thousand years of massive-scale works in the rich diction of regal courts and Hindu temples. It has also inspired much secondary literature in various languages, notably Kambaramayanam by Tamil poet Kambar of the 12th century, Telugu language \"Molla Ramayanam\" by poet Molla and Ranganatha Ramayanam by poet Gona Budda Reddy, 14th-century Kannada poet Narahari's Torave Ramayana and 15th-century Bengali poet Krittibas Ojha's Krittivasi Ramayan, as well as the 16th-century Awadhi version, \"Ramcharitmanas\", written by Tulsidas.\nRamayanic scenes have also been depicted through terracottas, stone sculptures, bronzes and paintings. These include the stone panel at Nagarjunakonda in Andhra Pradesh depicting Bharata's meeting with Rama at Chitrakuta (3rd century CE).\nThe \"Ramayana\" became popular in Southeast Asia from the 8th century onward and was represented in literature, temple architecture, dance and theatre. Today, dramatic enactments of the story of the \"Ramayana\", known as Ramlila, take place all across India and in many places across the globe within the Indian diaspora.\nIn Indonesia, especially Java and Bali, \"Ramayana\" has become a popular source of artistic expression for dance drama and shadow puppet performances in the region. Sendratari Ramayana is the Javanese traditional ballet in wayang orang style, routinely performed in the cultural center of Yogyakarta. Large casts were part of outdoor and indoor performances presented regularly at Prambanan Trimurti temple for many years. Balinese dance dramas of \"Ramayana\" were also performed frequently in Balinese Hindu temples in Ubud and Uluwatu, where scenes from Ramayana are an integral part of kecak dance performances. Javanese Wayang (\"Wayang Kulit\" of \"purwa\" and \"Wayang Wong\") also draw from \"Ramayana\" or \"Mahabharata\".\n\"Ramayana\" has also been depicted in many paintings, notably by the Indonesian (Balinese) artists such as I Gusti Dohkar (before 1938), I Dewa Poetoe Soegih, I Dewa Ged\u00e9 Raka Poedja, Ida Bagus Made Togog before 1948 period. Their paintings are currently in the National Museum of World Cultures collections of Tropenmuseum in Amsterdam, Netherlands. Malaysian artist Syed Thajudeen also depicted \"Ramayana\" in 1972. The painting is currently in the permanent collection of the Malaysian National Visual Arts Gallery.\nIn popular culture.\nMultiple modern, English-language adaptations of the epic exist, namely Ram Chandra Series by Amish Tripathi, Ramayana Series by Ashok Banker and a mythopoetic novel, \"Asura: Tale of the Vanquished\" by Anand Neelakantan. Another Indian author, Devdutt Pattanaik, has published three different retellings and commentaries of Ramayana titled \"Sita\", \"The Book Of Ram\" and \"Hanuman's Ramayan\". A number of plays, movies and television serials have also been produced based upon the \"Ramayana\".\nQuotes from the \"Ramayana\" are used in \"Live Gloriously\", the main theme for the video game \"Civilization VII\".\nStage.\nOne of the best known \"Ramayana\" plays is Gopal Sharman's \"The Ramayana\", a contemporary interpretation in English, of the great epic based on the Valmiki \"Ramayana\". The play has had more than 3,000 performances all over the world, mostly as a one-woman performance by actress Jalabala Vaidya, wife of the playwright Gopal Sharman. \"The Ramayana\" has been performed on Broadway, London's West End, United Nations Headquarters, the Smithsonian Institution among other international venue and in more than 35 cities and towns in India.\nStarting in 1978 and under the supervision of Baba Hari Dass, \"Ramayana\" has been performed every year by Mount Madonna School in Watsonville, California.\nIn the Philippines, a jazz ballet production was produced in the 1970s entitled \"Rama at Sita\" (Rama and Sita). The production was a result of a collaboration of four National Artists, Bienvenido Lumbera's libretto (National Artist for Literature), production design by Salvador Bernal (National Artist for Stage Design), music by Ryan Cayabyab (National Artist for Music) and choreography by Alice Reyes (National Artist for Dance).\nNomenclatures.\nRamayana has had a profound influence on India and Indians across the geographical and historical space. Rampur is the most common name for villages and towns across the nation particularly UP, Bihar and West Bengal. It is so common that people have been using Ram Ram as a greeting to each other.\nTexts and translations.\nHere is a list of notable English translations of the Ramayana in chronological order:\nThese translations reflect a range of approaches, from strict adherence to the original Sanskrit text to more accessible modern retellings.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "44247", "revid": "48643156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44247", "title": "North Ossetia\u2013Alania", "text": "First-level administrative division of Russia\nNorth Ossetia\u2013Alania (; ), officially the Republic of North Ossetia\u2013Alania, is a republic of Russia situated in the North Caucasus of Eastern Europe. It borders the country of Georgia (South Ossetia) to the south, and the Russian federal subjects of Kabardino-Balkaria to the west, Stavropol Krai to the north, Chechnya to the east and Ingushetia to the southeast. Its population according to the 2021 Census was 687,357. The republic\u2019s capital city is Vladikavkaz, located on the foothills of the Caucasus Mountains.\nThe majority of the republic's population (68.1% as of 2021) are Ossetians, an Iranian ethnic group native to the republic and neighboring South Ossetia. Ossetian is an east Iranian language descended from the medieval Alanic and ancient Sarmatian languages. Unlike many ethnic groups in the North Caucasus, the majority of Ossetians are Christians, predominantly Eastern Orthodox. Almost 30% of the population adheres to Ossetian ethnic religion, generally called Uatsdin (\u0423\u0430\u0446\u0434\u0438\u043d, \"True Faith\"), and there is a sizable Muslim minority. Ethnic Russians and Ingush, who form a majority in neighboring Ingushetia, form substantial minorities in the republic.\nThe Ossetia region traces its history back to the ancient Alans, who founded the Kingdom of Alania in the 8th century and adopted Christianity in the 9th century. The kingdom would fall to the Mongols in the 13th century. From 1774 to 1806, Ossetia was slowly incorporated into the Russian Empire, which would split the region into a northern part included in the Terek Oblast, and a southern one included in the Tiflis and Kutaisi governorates. This partition would persist in the Soviet period, where North Ossetia was made into the Mountain Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic within the Russian SFSR, while South Ossetia became an autonomous oblast within the Georgian SSR.\nFollowing the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the republic experienced internal conflict like in much of the North Caucasus. In 1992, a brief ethnic war between Ossetians and the predominantly Muslim Ingush population in the Prigorodny District took place. The republic has experienced spillover from the Chechen conflict, most notably in the form of the 2004 Beslan school siege. Proposals for Russia to annex South Ossetia in order to incorporate the two as one entity exist to this day.\nOssetian cuisine is distinguished as an integral aspect of Ossetian culture. Ossetian-style pies such as \"Fydzhin\" (a meat pie) are a quintessential component of Ossetian cuisine. The \"three pies\" concept holds special symbolic significance, and representing the Sun, Earth, and water.\nName.\nIn the last years of the Soviet Union, as nationalist movements swept throughout the Caucasus, many intellectuals in the North Ossetian ASSR called for the revival of the name of Alania, a medieval kingdom of the Alans.\nThe term \"Alania\" quickly became popular in Ossetian daily life through the names of various enterprises, TV channels, political and civic organizations, publishing house, football team, etc. In November 1994, the name \"Alania\" was officially added to the republic\u2019s title (Republic of North Ossetia\u2013Alania).\nGeography.\nThe republic is located in the North Caucasus. The northern part of the republic is situated in the Stavropol Plain. 22% of the republic\u2019s territory is covered by forests.\nRivers.\nAll of the republic\u2019s rivers belong to the drainage basin of the Terek River. Major rivers include:\nMountains.\nAll of the mountains located on the territory of the republic are a part of the Caucasus. Mount Kazbek is the highest point (5,033\u00a0m), with Mount Jimara being the second-highest (4,780\u00a0m).\nNatural resources.\nNatural resources include minerals (copper, silver, zinc), timber, mineral waters, hydroelectric power, and untapped reserves of oil and gas.\nClimate.\nThe climate is moderately continental.\nHistory.\nEarly history: Kingdom of Alania and Middle Ages.\nAccording to Georgian sources, the Iberians and the ancestors of the Ossetians established contacts during the Iberian\u2013Armenian War\nAlania greatly profited from the Silk Road which passed through its territory.\nAccording to the 10th century historian Al-Masudi, indicates that the Alan kingdom stretched from Dagestan to Abkhazia.\nIn the 13th century the Mongols invaded Alania. In 1220, Genghis Khan sent his military leaders Subutai and Jebe on a campaign to reach \u201celeven countries and peoples\u201d, among which were \u201cKibchayts\u201d (Kipchak Turks), \u201cOrosut\u201d (Kievan Rus), \u201cSerkesut\u201d (Circassia), \u201cAsut\u201d (Alania).\nIn 1239 the capital of Alania, Maghas, and other cities were destroyed. After these events the Alans were forced to flee to the mountain gorges and leave the flat lands. Islam was introduced to the region in the 17th century by Kabardians.\nRussian imperial rule (1806\u20131917).\nConflicts between the Khanate of Crimea and the Ottoman Empire eventually pushed Ossetia into an alliance with Imperial Russia in the 18th century. Soon, Russia established a military base in the capital, Vladikavkaz, making it the first Russian-controlled area in the northern Caucasus. The Georgian Military Road, which is still a crucial transport link across the mountains, was built in 1799 and a railway line was built from Vladikavkaz to Rostov-on-Don in Russia proper. In 1830, a military campaign led by General Ivane Abkhazi brought North Ossetia under tighter control of the Russian Empire. By 1830, Ossetia was under complete Russian control.\nThe Russians\u2019 rule led to rapid development of industry and railways which overcame its isolation. The first books from the area came during the late 18th century, and became part of the Terskaya Region of Russia in the mid-19th century.\nAn estimated 50,000 Ossetians left the Caucasus during the early 1860s as part of a greater migration of Muslims from the region to the Ottoman Empire due to Russia's activities in the region.\nSoviet period (1917\u20131990).\nThe Russian Revolution of 1917 resulted in North Ossetia being merged into the Mountain Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic in 1921. It then became the North Ossetian Autonomous Oblast on 7 July 1924, then merged into the North Ossetian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic on 5 December 1936. In World War II, it was subject to a number of attacks by Nazi German invaders unsuccessfully trying to seize Vladikavkaz in 1942.\nThe North Ossetian ASSR declared itself the autonomous republic of the Soviet Union on 20 June 1990. Its name was changed to the Republic of North Ossetia\u2013Alania in 1994.\nRussian Federation period (1990\u2013present).\nThe dissolution of the Soviet Union posed particular problems for the Ossetian people, who were divided between North Ossetia, which was part of the Russian SFSR, and South Ossetia, part of the Georgian SSR. In December 1990, the Supreme Soviet of the Georgian SSR abolished the autonomous Ossetian enclave amid the rising ethnic tensions in the region, which was further fanned by Moscow; a lot of the conflict zone population, faced with the ethnic cleansing, was forced to flee across the border to either North Ossetia or Georgia proper.\nDue to the large number of weapons in the hands of the Ossetian and Ingush population, the Ossetian-Ingush conflict flared up, due to which from 30,000 to 60,000 Ingush were forced to leave North Ossetia. On 23 March 1995, North Ossetia\u2013Alania signed a power-sharing agreement with the federal government, granting it autonomy. However, this agreement was abolished on 2 September 2002.\nFollowing the \"de facto\" independence of South Ossetia, there have been proposals in this state of joining Russia and uniting with North Ossetia. As well as dealing with the effects of the conflict in South Ossetia, North Ossetia has had to deal with refugees and the occasional spillover of fighting from the wars around them. This notably manifested in the form of the 2004 Beslan school siege by Chechen terrorists.\nEconomy.\nIn recent years, North Ossetia\u2013Alania\u2019s economic development has been successful; the indicators of the republic\u2019s social and economic development between 2005 and 2007 revealed a stable growth of all sectors of the economy and major social parameters. The nature and climatic conditions of the republic contribute to the successful development of various economic sectors, which is compounded by the abundance of natural resources. Gross regional product pro capita of the region in 2006 was 61,000 rubles ($2,596) and increased 30% in the 2005\u20132007 time period. GRP pro capita in 2007 was 76,455 rubles. From 2005 to 2007, the average monthly wage in North Ossetia\u2013Alania doubled, with the actual cash earnings increased by 42.5 percent. In terms of the average monthly wage growth, the Republic ranks first in the North Caucasus.\nThe regional government\u2019s economic priorities include industrial growth, development of small enterprise, spas, and resorts, and strengthening the budgetary and tax discipline.\nThe largest companies in the region include Elektrozinc, Sevkavkazenergo, Pobedit (tungsten and molybdenum producer).\nNatural resources, agriculture, and industry.\nThe most widespread resources are zinc- and lead-containing complex ores. There are deposits of limestone, dolomites, marble, and touchstone. There is also a large availability of construction materials, such as clay, sand, and gravel. The local oil deposit reserves are estimated at 10\u00a0million metric tons.\nThe agricultural sector is varied and specializes in the cultivation of wheat, corn, and sunflowers; horticulture; viticulture; and cattle and sheep breeding.\nNorth Ossetia\u2019s industry is mainly concentrated in Vladikavkaz. Major companies located here include Elektrotsink, Gazoapparat, an instrument-making plant, Elektrokontraktor, a factory producing automotive electrical equipment, a large-panel construction complex, and companies in the food industry. The Sadonsky industrial center has grown around the mining and forest industries.\nTourism.\nDespite the proximity to Chechnya, North Ossetia is making efforts to develop its tourist industry. Projects under a program for spa, resort, and tourism development have been successfully implemented in the mountainous part of the republic, according to the head of the regional government. There are nearly 3,000 historical monuments in the Republic and more than half of its area is occupied by Alania National Park, the North Ossetia National Preserve, and game preserves.\nThere are more than 250 therapeutic, mineral, and freshwater springs in the republic with estimated daily reserves of 15,000 cubic meters. Besides providing the basis for health spas, these mineral waters also have the potential to be bottled and sold. North Ossetian mineral waters are known for their unique qualities, as well as special mineral composition.\nInfrastructure.\nIn terms of its infrastructure, North Ossetia\u2013Alania ranks second in the Southern Federal District and 10th in the nation. The republic has some of the most extensive telecommunication networks in the North Caucasus region and in Russia. It ranks first in terms of its telecom network installations in the Southern Federal District.\nThe republic ranks fourth in Russia in terms of its paved roads, and its expanding transport and logistics complex provides communication networks between Russia and the South Caucasus, as well as Central Asia. The complex includes two federal highways (Georgian Military Road connects Vladikavkaz with Transcaucasia) running across the Greater Caucasus Range, two customs checkpoints for cars, a developed railway network, Vladikavkaz international airport, and well-equipped transport terminals.\nDemographics.\nPopulation: \u2009(2021 census); \u2009(2010 census); \u2009(2002 census); \u2009(1989 Soviet census)&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;Number of refugees: 12,570\nLife expectancy:\nSettlements.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Largest_cities/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEthnic groups.\nThe majority of the population of North Ossetia are Christians who belong to the Russian Orthodox Church, although there is also a Muslim minority who are of Ossetian-speaking origin.\nAccording to the 2021 Census, Ossetians make up 68.1% of the republic\u2019s population. Other groups include Russians (18.9%), Ingush (3.8%), Kumyks (2.8%), Armenians (1.8%), Georgians (1.0%), and a host of smaller groups, each accounting for less than 1% of the total population.\nLanguages.\nThere are two official languages in North Ossetia: Russian, which is official in all Russian territory, and Ossetian. Ossetian is an Indo-European language, belonging to the East Iranian group. Ossetian is the only Iranic language spoken natively in Europe that survives to this day. Russian, acting as a lingua franca in the region, is an East Slavic language and as such also belongs to the Indo-European family, which means the two languages are related, albeit distantly.\nReligion.\nAccording to a 2012 survey which interviewed 56,900 people, 49% of the population of North Ossetia\u2013Alania adheres to the Russian Orthodox Church, 10% declare to be unaffiliated Christian believers, 2% are either Orthodox Christian believers who do not belong to churches or members of non-Russian Orthodox bodies. The second-largest religion is Ossetian ethnic religion, generally called Uatsdin (\u0423\u0430\u0446\u0434\u0438\u043d, \"True Faith\"), a Scythian religion organized into movements such as the \"Atsata\" Church, comprising 29% of the population. Muslims constitute 4% of the population, and Protestants the 1%. In addition, 1% of the population declares to be \"spiritual but not religious\" and 3% to be atheist.\nEducation.\nThe most important facilities of higher education include North Caucasus State Technological University, North Ossetian State University, North Ossetian State Medical Academy, and Mountain State Agrarian University\u00a0\u2013 all in Vladikavkaz.\nPolitics.\nDuring the Soviet period, the high authority in the republic was shared between three people; the first secretary of the North Ossetia Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) Committee (who in reality had the biggest authority), the chairman of the oblast Soviet (legislative power), and the Chairman of the Republic Executive Committee (executive power). Since 1991, CPSU lost all the power, and the head of the Republic administration, and eventually the governor was appointed/elected alongside elected regional parliament.\nThe Charter of the Republic of North Ossetia\u2013Alania is the fundamental law of the region. The Parliament of North Ossetia\u2013Alania is the republic\u2019s regional standing legislative (representative) body. The Legislative Assembly exercises its authority by passing laws, resolutions, and other legal acts and by supervising the implementation and observance of the laws and other legal acts passed by it. The highest executive body is the Republic\u2019s Government, which includes territorial executive bodies such as district administrations, committees, and commissions that facilitate development and run the day to day matters of the province. The Oblast administration supports the activities of the Governor who is the highest official and acts as guarantor of the observance of the krai Charter in accordance with the Constitution of Russia.\nThe head of government in the Republic of North Ossetia\u2013Alania is the Head of the Republic. The current head of the republic is Sergey Menyaylo. Taymuraz Mamsurov succeeded Aleksandr Dzasokhov as head on 31 May 2005 following the Beslan school siege.\nCulture.\nThere are six professional theatres in North Ossetia\u2013Alania \u2013 including the North Ossetia-Alania Opera and Ballet Theatre, as well as the Ossetian State Philharmonia.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The department of Dakar has a population of 1,278,469, and the population of the Dakar metropolitan area was at 4.0 million in 2023.\nDakar is situated on the Cap-Vert peninsula, the westernmost point of mainland Africa. Cap-Vert was colonized by the Portuguese in the early 15th century. The Portuguese established a presence on the island of Gor\u00e9e off the coast of Cap-Vert and used it as a base for the Atlantic slave trade. France took over the island in 1677. Following the abolition of the slave trade and French annexation of the mainland area in the 19th century, Dakar grew into a major regional port and a major city of the French colonial empire. In 1902, Dakar replaced Saint-Louis as the capital of French West Africa. From 1959 to 1960, Dakar was the capital of the short-lived Mali Federation. In 1960, it became the capital of the independent Republic of Senegal. Dakar will host the 2026 Summer Youth Olympics.\nHistory.\nThe Cap-Vert peninsula was settled no later than the 15th century by the Lebu people, an aquacultural subgroup of the Wolof ethnic group. The original villages\u2014Ouakam, Ngor, Yoff and Hann\u2014still constitute distinctively Lebou neighborhoods of the city today. In 1444, the Portuguese reached the Bay of Dakar. Peaceful contact was finally opened in 1456 by Diogo Gomes, and the bay was subsequently referred to as the \"Angra de Bezeguiche\" (after the name of the local ruler). The bay of \"Bezeguiche\" would go on to serve as a critical stop for the Portuguese India Armadas of the early 16th century, where large fleets would routinely stop, both on their outward and return journeys from India, to repair, collect fresh water from the rivulets and wells along the Cap-Vert shore and trade for provisions with the local people for their remaining voyage. (It was famously during one of these stops, in 1501, where the Florentine navigator Amerigo Vespucci began to construct his \"New World\" hypothesis about America.)\nThe Portuguese eventually founded a settlement on the island of Gor\u00e9e (then known as the island of Bezeguiche or Palma), which by 1536 they began to use as a base for slave exportation. The mainland of Cap-Vert, however, was under control of the Jolof Empire, as part of the western province of Cayor, which seceded from Jolof in its own right in 1549. A new Lebou village, called Ndakaaru, was established directly across from Gor\u00e9e in the 17th century to service the European trading factory with food and drinking water. Gor\u00e9e was captured by the United Netherlands in 1588, which gave it its present name (spelled \"Goeree\", after Goeree-Overflakkee in the Netherlands). The island switched hands between the Portuguese and Dutch several more times before falling to the English under Admiral Robert Holmes on January 23, 1664, and finally to the French in 1677. Though under continuous French administration since, multiracial people, descended from Dutch and French traders and African wives, dominated the slave trade. The infamous \"House of Slaves\" was built at Gor\u00e9e in 1776.\nIn 1795, the Lebou of Cape Verde revolted against Cayor rule. A new theocratic state, subsequently called the \"Lebou Republic\" by the French, was established under the leadership of the Diop, a Muslim clerical family originally from Koki in Cayor. The capital of the republic was established at Ndakaaru. In 1857, the French established a military post at Ndakaaru (which they called \"Dakar\") and annexed the Lebou Republic, though its institutions continued to function nominally. The Serigne (also spelled S\u00ebri\u00f1, \"Lord\") of Ndakaaru is still recognized as the traditional political authority of the Lebou by the Senegalese State today.\nThe slave trade was abolished by France in February 1794. However, Napoleon Bonaparte reinstated the slave trade in May 1802. The slave trade continued at Gor\u00e9e until 1848, when it was finally abolished throughout all French territories. To replace trade in slaves, the French promoted peanut cultivation on the mainland. As the peanut trade boomed, tiny Gor\u00e9e Island, whose population had grown to 6,000\u00a0residents, proved ineffectual as a port. Traders from Gor\u00e9e decided to move to the mainland, and a \"factory\" with warehouses was established in Rufisque in 1840.\nLarge public expenditure for infrastructure was allocated by the colonial authorities to Dakar's development. The port facilities were improved with jetties, a telegraph line was established along the coast to Saint-Louis, and the Dakar-Saint-Louis railway was completed in 1885, at which point the city became an important base for the conquest of the Western Sudan.\nGor\u00e9e, including Dakar, was recognised as a French \"commune\" in 1872. Dakar itself was split off from Gor\u00e9e as a separate \"commune\" in 1887. The citizens of the city elected their own mayor and municipal council, and helped send an elected representative to the National Assembly in Paris. Dakar replaced Saint-Louis as the capital of French West Africa in 1902. A second major railroad, the Dakar-Niger built from 1906 to 1923, linked Dakar to Bamako and consolidated the city's position at the head of France's West African empire. In 1929, the \"commune\" of Gor\u00e9e Island, now with only a few hundred inhabitants, was merged into Dakar.\nUrbanization during the colonial period was marked by forms of racial and social segregation\u2014often expressed in terms of health and hygiene\u2014which continue to structure the city today. Following a plague epidemic in 1914, the authorities forced most of the African population out of old neighborhoods, or \"Plateau\", and into a new quarter, called M\u00e9dina, separated from it by a \"sanitary cordon\". As first occupants of the land, the Lebou inhabitants of the city successfully resisted this expropriation. They were supported by Blaise Diagne, the first African to be elected Deputy to the National Assembly. Nonetheless, the Plateau thereafter became an administrative, commercial, and residential district increasingly reserved for Europeans and served as a model for similar exclusionary administrative enclaves in French Africa's other colonial capitals (Bamako, Conakry, Abidjan, Brazzaville). Meanwhile, the Layene Sufi order, established by Seydina Mouhammadou Limamou Laye, was thriving among the Lebou in Yoff and in a new village called Camb\u00e9r\u00e8ne. Since independence, urbanization has sprawled eastward past Pikine, a commuter suburb whose population (2001 est. 1,200,000) is greater than that of Dakar proper, to Rufisque, creating a conurbation of almost 3\u00a0million (over a quarter of the national population).\nIn its colonial heyday, Dakar was one of the major cities of the French Empire, comparable to Hanoi or Beirut. French trading firms established branch offices there, and industrial investments (mills, breweries, refineries, canneries) were attracted by its port and rail facilities. It was also strategically important to France, which maintained an important naval base and coaling station in its harbor, and which integrated it into its earliest air force and airmail circuits, most notably with the legendary Mermoz airfield (no longer extant).\nIn 1940, Dakar became involved in the Second World War when General de Gaulle, leader of the Free French Forces, sought to make the city the base of his resistance operations. The object was to raise the Free French flag in West Africa, to occupy Dakar and thus start to consolidate the French resistance of its colonies in Africa. The plan had British naval support when fighting alone against the Axis powers. However, due to delays and the plan becoming known, Dakar had already come under the influence of the German-controlled will of the Vichy government. With the arrival of French naval forces under Vichy control and faced by stubborn defences onshore, de Gaulle's proposals were resisted, and the Battle of Dakar ensued off the coast, lasting three days 23\u201325 September 1940, between the Vichy defences and the attack of the Free French and British navy. The enterprise was abandoned after appreciable naval losses. Although the initiative on Dakar failed, General de Gaulle was able to establish himself at Douala in the Cameroons, which became the rallying point for the resistance of the Free French cause.\nIn November 1944, West African conscripts in the French army mutinied against poor conditions at the Thiaroye camp, on the outskirts of the city. The mutiny was seen as an indictment of the colonial system and constituted a watershed for the nationalist movement. On 1 December 1944, French soldiers guarding the camp opened fire on the West African soldiers. Accounts of the death toll range from around 35 (the official French account) to over 300 (army veterans active at the time).\nDakar was the capital of the short-lived Mali Federation from 1959 to 1960, after which it became the capital of Senegal. The poet, philosopher and first President of Senegal L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor tried to transform Dakar into the \"Sub-Saharan African Athens\" (l'Ath\u00e8nes de l'Afrique subsaharienne), as his vision was for it.\nDakar is a major financial centre, home to a dozen national and regional banks (including the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) which manages the unified West African CFA franc currency), and to numerous international organizations, NGOs and international research centers. Dakar has a large Lebanese community (concentrated in the import-export sector) that dates to the 1920s, a community of Moroccan businesspeople, as well as Mauritanian, Cape Verdean, and Guinean communities. The city is home to as many as 20,000\u00a0French expatriates. France still maintains an air force base at Yoff, and the French fleet is serviced in Dakar's port.\nBeginning 1978 and until 2007, Dakar was frequently the ending point of the Dakar Rally.\nGeography.\nDakar is located on the Cap-Vert peninsula on the Atlantic coast and is the westernmost city on the African mainland.\nClimate.\nDakar has an ocean-influenced tropical hot semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: \"BSh\"), with a short rainy season and a lengthy dry season. Dakar's rainy season lasts from July to October, while the dry season covers the remaining eight months. The city sees approximately of rainfall per year.\nDakar between December and May is usually very warm with daily temperatures around . Nights during this time of the year are warm, some . However, between May and November, the city becomes decidedly hotter with daily highs reaching and night lows a little bit above . Notwithstanding this hotter season, Dakar's weather is far from being so hot as experienced in inland Sahelian cities like Niamey and N'Djamena, where temperatures hover above for much of the year. Dakar is cooled year-round by sea breezes.\nClimate change.\nA 2019 paper published in PLOS One estimated that under Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5, a \"moderate\" scenario of climate change where global warming reaches ~ by 2100, the climate of Dakar in the year 2050 would most closely resemble the current climate of Praia in Cape Verde. The annual temperature would increase by , and the temperature of the warmest and the coldest month by and , respectively. According to Climate Action Tracker, the current warming trajectory appears consistent with , which closely matches RCP 4.5.\nMoreover, according to the 2022 IPCC Sixth Assessment Report, Dakar is one of 12 major African cities (Abidjan, Alexandria, Algiers, Cape Town, Casablanca, Dakar, Dar es Salaam, Durban, Lagos, Lom\u00e9, Luanda and Maputo) which would be the most severely affected by future sea level rise. It estimates that they would collectively sustain cumulative damages of US$65 billion under RCP 4.5 and US$86.5 billion for the high-emission scenario RCP 8.5 by the year 2050. Additionally, RCP 8.5 combined with the hypothetical impact from marine ice sheet instability at high levels of warming would involve up to US$137.5 billion in damages, while the additional accounting for the \"low-probability, high-damage events\" may increase aggregate risks to US$187 billion for the \"moderate\" RCP4.5, US$206 billion for RCP8.5 and US$397 billion under the high-end ice sheet instability scenario. Since sea level rise would continue for about 10,000 years under every scenario of climate change, future costs of sea level rise would only increase, especially without adaptation measures.\nAdministration.\nThe city of Dakar is a commune (also sometimes known as \"commune de ville\"), one of the 125\u00a0communes of Senegal. The commune of Dakar was created by the French colonial administration on 17 June 1887, by detaching it from the commune of Gor\u00e9e. The commune of Gor\u00e9e, created in 1872, was itself one of the oldest Western-style municipalities in Africa (along with the municipalities of Algeria and South Africa).\nThe commune of Dakar has been in continuous existence since 1887, being preserved by the new state of Senegal after independence in 1960, although its limits have varied considerably over time. The limits of the commune of Dakar have been unchanged since 1983. The commune of Dakar is ruled by a democratically elected municipal council (\"conseil municipal\") serving five years, and a mayor elected by the municipal council. There have been 20\u00a0mayors in Dakar since 1887. The first black mayor was Blaise Diagne, mayor of Dakar from 1924 to 1934. The longest-serving mayor was Mamadou Diop, mayor for 18\u00a0years between 1984 and 2002.\nThe commune of Dakar is also a \"department\", one of the 45\u00a0departments of Senegal. This situation is quite similar to Paris, which is both a commune and a department. However, contrary to French departments, departments in Senegal have no political power (no departmental assembly), and are merely local administrative structures of the central state, in charge of carrying out some administrative services as well as controlling the activities of the communes within the department.\nThe department of Dakar is divided into four arrondissements: Almadies, Grand Dakar, Parcelles Assainies (which literally means \"drained lots\"; this is the most populous arrondissement of Dakar), and Plateau/Gor\u00e9e (downtown Dakar). These arrondissements are quite different from the arrondissements of Paris, being merely local administrative structures of the central state, like the Senegalese \"departments\", and are thus more comparable to French departmental arrondissements.\nIn 1996, a massive reform of the administrative and political divisions of Senegal was voted by the Parliament of Senegal. The commune of Dakar, whose population approached 1 million inhabitants, was deemed too large and too populated to be properly managed by a central municipality, and thus on August 30, 1996, Dakar was divided into 19\u00a0\"communes d'arrondissement\". These \"communes d'arrondissement\" were given extensive powers and are very much like regular communes. They have more powers than the arrondissements of Paris and are more akin to the London boroughs. The commune of Dakar was maintained above these 19\u00a0\"communes d'arrondissement\", and it coordinates the activities of the \"communes d'arrondissement\", much as Greater London coordinates the activities of the London boroughs. The 19\u00a0\"communes d'arrondissement\" belong to either of the four arrondissements of Dakar, and the of each arrondissement is in charge of controlling the activities of the \"communes d'arrondissement\" in his arrondissement.\nThe \"commune d'arrondissement\" of Dakar-Plateau (34,626 inhabitants), in the arrondissement of Plateau/Gor\u00e9e, is the historical heart of the city, and most ministries and public administrations are located there. The densest and most populous \"commune d'arrondissement\" is M\u00e9dina (136,697\u00a0inhabitants), in the arrondissement of Plateau/Gor\u00e9e. The \"commune d'arrondissement\" of Yoff (55,995\u00a0inhabitants), in the arrondissement of Almadies, is the largest one, while the smallest one is the \"commune d'arrondissement\" of \u00cele de Gor\u00e9e (1,034\u00a0inhabitants), in the arrondissement of Plateau/Gor\u00e9e.\nDakar is one of the 14\u00a0\"r\u00e9gions of Senegal\". The Dakar \"r\u00e9gion\" encompasses the city of Dakar and all its suburbs along the Cape Verde Peninsula. Its territory is thus roughly the same as the territory of the metropolitan area of Dakar. Since the administrative reforms of 1996, the \"r\u00e9gions\" of Senegal, which until then were merely local administrative structures of the central state, have been turned into full-fledged political units, with democratically elected regional councils, and regional presidents. They were given extensive powers, and manage economic development, transportation, or environmental protection issues at the regional level, thus coordinating the actions of the communes below them.\nNotable sites.\nThe city of Dakar is a member of the Organization of World Heritage Cities and contains several landmarks. One of the most notable is Deux Mamelles, twin hills located in Ouakam commune. The hills are the only high ground in the city, providing views of the entire area and sweeping views of the city. The first hill is topped with Mamelles Lighthouse built in 1864. The second hill has the newly completed African Renaissance Monument built on top, which is considered the tallest statue in Africa.\nOther landmarks of the city include the medina quarter located in M\u00e9dina commune. M\u00e9dina is originally built as a township for local populace during the French colonial era. Today, it is a traditional commercial center packed with tailors' shops. The most notable street market is Soumb\u00e9dioune, which is also a major tourist attraction. The quarter also houses Dakar Grand Mosque at the heart of the commune, which is built in 1964 and one of the prominent landmarks of the city.\nDakar is flanked by four small islands, \u00eele de Yoff, \u00cele de N'Gor, \u00celes de la Madeleine and \u00cele de Gor\u00e9e. \u00cele de N'Gor is on the northern shore of N'Gor commune, with beaches providing attractions such as surfing. N'Gor commune also has other popular beach resorts such as Plage de N'Gor. \u00cele de Gor\u00e9e, formerly a slave island, is today a UNESCO World Heritage Site which preserves the colonial era architectures and facilities. Some notable places on the island include the Gor\u00e9e Memorial, which is a memorial for the slaves, and the House of Slaves, which is a museum dedicated to the Atlantic slave trade. Today, the island is also hosting the art scene of the hundreds of local artists who line up their works at the outdoor exhibitions.\nSome other notable places include Layen Mausoleum which entombs the founder of the Layene Sufi tariqa, Palais Pr\u00e9sidentiel which is the seat of the government constructed in 1907, Place de l'Ind\u00e9pendance which is the central square of Dakar, Dakar Cathedral, and Cheikh Anta Diop University also known as the University of Dakar, which was established in 1957.\nPlaces of worship.\nThe most common places of worship in Dakar are Muslim mosques. There are also Christian churches: Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Dakar (Catholic Church), Assemblies of God, Universal Church of the Kingdom of God.\nDakar was selected as the Capital of Islamic Culture for African Region for the year 2007 by the Islamic Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (ISESCO), honoring its Islamic heritage. ISESCO and its parent organization Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) have held several regional and international conferences in the city, best known for adoption of Dakar Declaration in 1991, which aimed at fostering cooperation between the member states. Dakar is also known as the birthplace of the Layene Brotherhood, a Sufi tariqa founded by Seydina Mouhammadou Limamou Laye in 1883 at the commune of Yoff. Seydina is buried in the Layen Mausoleum, which is among the major landmarks of Dakar. Today, Layene Brotherhood is consisted mostly of the Lebou people and based in the Cap-Vert area. It is also the third-biggest Sufi order in Senegal.\nProminent worshiping sites for Muslims in Dakar include the Grand Mosque of Dakar, built in 1964, which is situated at All\u00e9e Pape Gueye Fall of Medina, the Mosque of Divinity, constructed in 1973, situated in Ouakam, with the characteristic triangular windows, and Omarienne Mosque with minarets topped by green orbs.\nCulture.\nIn Senegal, the traditional culture is very centred around the idea of family. This even includes the way that they eat. When it is time to eat a typical meal, someone will say \"kay lekk\" which means 'come eat'. Everyone will come together and sit around the plate and eat with their hands. Some famous dishes include Cebbu J\u00ebn (Ti\u00e9boudienne) and Yassa. The etiquette of people in Dakar is very simple but very vital. To not greet someone upon sight is to portray rudeness and oftentimes ignorance. Due to French colonialism, the children of Dakar have a unique school system. The school will get a break at about midday and return home to get some rest. Since the population is majority Muslim, there are numerous daily Islamic activities ongoing, such as participating in noon prayer at the nearest mosque and attending the local mosque on Fridays. Music has a big influence on the youth, with famous artists like Daara J Family who use their voice to represent the problems in their communities.\nDakar is home to multiple national and international festivals, like World Festival of Black Arts, Festival international du film de quartier de Dakar, Dakar Biennale. It was also the location of Taf Taf, an international artist residency program.\nSports.\nSports club AS Douanes are based in Sicap-Libert\u00e9; they play in the Senegal Premier League and previously won the 2014\u201315 Ligue 1 (Senegal) season.\nDakar used to be the finishing point of the Dakar Rally until 2007, before the event was moved to South America for the security concerns in Mauritania.\nDakar was set to host the 2022 edition of the Youth Summer Olympics, however, the games have been postponed to 2026, it will be the first Olympic event to ever be held in Africa.\nTransport.\nThe Conseil Ex\u00e9cutif des Transports Urbains Durables (CETUD) was founded in 1997 to coordinate transportation in the Dakar region. A 2021 study by CETUD revealed that the national economy suffers an annual loss of nearly CFA francs 900 billion (approximately USD $1.4 billion) as a result of poor air quality, traffic congestion, hazardous roads, and noise pollution. This represents nearly 6% of the country's yearly GDP.\nThe town is home to the Autonomous Port of Dakar and the terminus of the non-functioning Dakar-Niger railroad line.\nThree Trans-African Highways (TAHs) start from Dakar: the Cairo-Dakar Highway (TAH 1), the Dakar-Ndjamena Highway (TAH 5), and the Dakar-Lagos Highway (TAH 7).\nThe Train Express Regional Dakar-AIBD (TER) will connect Dakar with Blaise Diagne International Airport (AIBD). An initial will link Dakar to Diamniadio and a second phase of would connect Dakar to the Blaise Diagne airport. A total of 14 train stations will be served and the fastest end-to-end journey will take 45 minutes. The railway is expected to carry 115,000 passengers per day. The TER's first test run launched on 14 January 2019 and the first passenger train ran in December 2021.\nThe city has a 100% electric bus rapid transit (BRT) network: Sunu BRT, which currently has two routes in operation, with two more planned. The electric bus fleet consists of 144 articulated e-buses, dedicated right-of-way and 32 feeder bus routes. The construction of the Dakar BRT was funded by the World Bank and the European Investment Bank, and the Government of Senegal. The bus fleet was financed, acquired, and is operated by the private sector under a 15-year concession agreement established in 2021. The private sector entity, Dakar Mobilit\u00e9, is a partnership between Meridiam and the Fonds d\u2019Investissement du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal. The BRT development created 1,000 direct jobs, 35-45% of which were roles for women. The BRT system is expected to carry approximately 300,000 passengers per day and reduce travel times from 95 to 45 minutes After the development of the system, 69% of the city\u2019s population can access the city centre in under an hour, compared with just 12% before the BRT. \nBlaise Diagne International Airport is the city's international airport; it handles flights by several airlines, including Air France, Delta, Emirates and Emirates Sky Cargo, Iberia, TAP Air Portugal and Turkish, and is the hub of Senegal's flag carrier, Air Senegal.\nNotable people.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nInternational relations.\nDakar is twinned with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "44252", "revid": "958189", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44252", "title": "Cape of Good Hope", "text": "Headland of Cape Peninsula, South Africa\nThe Cape of Good Hope ( ) is a rocky headland on the Atlantic coast of the Cape Peninsula in South Africa.\nA common misconception is that the Cape of Good Hope is the southern tip of Africa, based on the misbelief that the Cape was the dividing point between the Atlantic and Indian oceans. In fact, the southernmost point of Africa is Cape Agulhas about to the east-southeast. The currents of the two oceans meet at the point where the warm-water Agulhas current meets the cold-water Benguela current and turns back on itself. That oceanic meeting point fluctuates between Cape Agulhas and Cape Point (about east of the Cape of Good Hope).\nWhen following the western side of the African coastline from the equator, however, the Cape of Good Hope marks the point where a ship begins to travel more eastward than southward. Thus, the first modern rounding of the cape in 1487 by Portuguese explorer Bartolomeu Dias was a milestone in the attempts by the Portuguese to establish direct trade relations with the Far East (although Herodotus mentioned a claim that the Phoenicians had done so far earlier). Dias called the cape ('Cape of Storms'; ), which was the original name of the cape.\nAs one of the great capes of the South Atlantic Ocean, it has long been of special significance to sailors, many of whom refer to it simply as \"the Cape\". It is a waypoint on the Cape Route and the clipper route followed by clipper ships to the Far East and Australia, and still followed by several offshore yacht races.\nThe term \"Cape of Good Hope\" is also used in other ways:\nHistory.\nAround 600 BC, Necho II reputedly commissioned an expedition of Phoenicians, who it is said in three years sailed from the Red Sea around Africa back to the mouth of the Nile; and would thereby be the first completion of the Cape Route. Herodotus' account was handed down to him by oral tradition, but is seen as potentially credible because he stated with disbelief that the Phoenicians \"as they sailed on a westerly course round the southern end of Libya (Africa), they had the sun on their right\"\u2014to northward of them (\"The Histories\" 4.42). Pliny reported that Hanno had circumnavigated Africa, which may have been a conflation with Necho's voyage, while Strabo, Polybius, and Ptolemy doubted the description; at the time it was not generally known that Africa was surrounded by an ocean (with the southern part of Africa being thought connected to Asia).\nEudoxus of Cyzicus (fl. c.\u2009130 BC) was a Greek navigator for Ptolemy VIII, king of the Hellenistic Ptolemaic dynasty in Egypt. In or about 116 BCE, while returning from a voyage to India, Eudoxus found the wreck of a ship that appeared to have originated in Gades (later C\u00e1diz), in what was then Roman Hispania Baetica. At the time, the only way such a vessel could have reached the Indian Ocean was by rounding the Cape.\nWhen Eudoxus was returning from his second voyage to India, the wind forced him south of the Gulf of Aden and down the coast of Africa for some distance. Somewhere along the coast of East Africa, he found the remains of the ship. Due to its appearance and the story told by the natives, Eudoxus concluded that the ship was from Gades and had sailed anti-clockwise around Africa, passing the Cape and entering the Indian Ocean. This inspired him to repeat the voyage and attempt a circumnavigation of the continent. Organising the expedition on his own account he set sail from Gades and began to work down the African coast. The difficulties were too great, however, and he was obliged to return to Europe.\nAfter this failure he again set out to circumnavigate Africa. His eventual fate is unknown. Although some, such as Pliny, claimed that Eudoxus did achieve his goal, the most probable conclusion is that he died on the journey.\nIn the 1450 Fra Mauro map, the Indian Ocean is depicted as connected to the Atlantic. Fra Mauro puts the following inscription by the southern tip of Africa, which he names the \"Cape of Diab\", describing the exploration by a ship from the East around 1420:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Around 1420 a ship, or junk, from India crossed the Sea of India towards the Island of Men and the Island of Women, off Cape Diab, between the Green Islands and the shadows. It sailed for 40 days in a south-westerly direction without ever finding anything other than wind and water. According to these people themselves, the ship went some 2,000 miles ahead until\u2014once favourable conditions came to an end\u2014it turned round and sailed back to Cape Diab in 70 days.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The ships called junks (lit. \"Zonchi\") that navigate these seas carry four masts or more, some of which can be raised or lowered, and have 40 to 60 cabins for the merchants and only one tiller. They can navigate without a compass, because they have an astrologer, who stands on the side and, with an astrolabe in hand, gives orders to the navigator.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\u2014Text from the Fra Mauro map, 09-P25\nFra Mauro explained that he obtained the information from \"a trustworthy source\", who traveled with the expedition, possibly the Venetian explorer Niccol\u00f2 da Conti who happened to be in Calicut, India at the time the expedition left:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;What is more, I have spoken with a person worthy of trust, who says that he sailed in an Indian ship caught in the fury of a tempest for 40 days out in the Sea of India, beyond the Cape of Soffala and the Green Islands towards west-southwest; and according to the astrologers who act as their guides, they had advanced almost 2,000 miles. Thus one can believe and confirm what is said by both these and those, and that they had therefore sailed 4,000 miles.\nFra Mauro also comments that the account of the expedition, together with the relation by Strabo of the travels of Eudoxus of Cyzicus from Arabia to Gibraltar through the southern Ocean in Antiquity, led him to believe that the Indian Ocean was not a closed sea and that Africa could be circumnavigated by her southern end (Text from Fra Mauro map, 11, G2). This knowledge, together with the map depiction of the African continent, probably encouraged the Portuguese to intensify their effort to round the tip of Africa.\nIn 1511, after Afonso de Albuquerque conquered Malacca, the Portuguese recovered a chart from a Javanese maritime pilot, which, according to Albuquerque, already included the Cape of Good Hope. Regarding the chart Albuquerque said:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"...\u00a0a large map of a Javanese pilot, containing the Cape of Good Hope, Portugal and the land of Brazil, the Red Sea and the Sea of Persia, the Clove Islands, the navigation of the Chinese and the Gores, with their rhumbs and direct routes followed by the ships, and the hinterland, and how the kingdoms border on each other. It seems to me, Sir, that this was the best thing I have ever seen, and Your Highness will be very pleased to see it; it had the names in Javanese writing, but I had with me a Javanese who could read and write. I send this piece to Your Highness, which Francisco Rodrigues traced from the other, in which Your Highness can truly see where the Chinese and Gores come from, and the course your ships must take to the Clove Islands, and where the gold mines lie, and the islands of Java and Banda, of nutmeg and mace, and the land of the King of Siam, and also the end of the land of the navigation of the Chinese, the direction it takes, and how they do not navigate farther.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\u2014 Letter of Albuquerque to King Manuel I of Portugal, 1 April 1512.\nEuropean exploration.\nName origin.\nIn the Early Modern Era, the first European to reach the cape was the Portuguese explorer Bartolomeu Dias on 12 March 1488, who named it the \"Cape of Storms\" (). It was later renamed by John II of Portugal as \"Cape of Good Hope\" () because of the great optimism engendered by the opening of a sea route to India and the East.\nThe Dutch's first settlement.\nThe Khoikhoi people lived in the cape area when the Dutch first settled there in 1652. The Khoikhoi had arrived in this area about fifteen hundred years before. The Dutch called them \"Hottentots\", a term that has now come to be regarded as pejorative.\nIn 1652, the Dutch East India Company's administrator Jan van Riebeeck established a resupply camp for the Dutch East India Company some 50\u00a0km north of the cape in Table Bay on April 6, and this eventually developed into Cape Town. Supplies of fresh food were vital on the long journey around Africa and Cape Town became known as \"The Tavern of the Seas\".\nThe French refugees in the Cape Colony.\nOn 31 December 1687, a community of Huguenots (French Protestants) arrived at the Cape of Good Hope from the Netherlands. They had fled from France due to religious persecution and gone to the Netherlands, before making the journey to the Cape Colony. Members of this group included Pierre Joubert, who came from La Motte-d'Aigues, as well as Jean Roy. The Dutch East India Company needed skilled farmers at the Cape of Good Hope and the Dutch government saw opportunities to settle Huguenots at the Cape. The colony gradually grew over the 150 years that followed until it extended hundreds of kilometers to the north and the north-east.\nThe European coalitions and Napoleonic wars effect on the Cape Colony.\nDuring the French Revolutionary Wars, the Dutch Republic was occupied by the French in 1795. The Cape Colony then became a French vassal and enemy of the British, who were at war with France. British troops invaded and occupied the Cape Colony that same year. The British relinquished control of the territory in 1803, under the peace of Amiens, but reoccupied the Colony on 19 January 1806 following the Battle of Blaauwberg. The Dutch formally ceded the territory to the British in the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814. It would remain a separate British colony until its incorporation into the Union of South Africa in 1910.\nRoutes explorations and commemorations.\nThe Portuguese government erected two navigational beacons, Dias Cross and da Gama Cross, to commemorate Bartolomeu Dias and Vasco da Gama, who were the first modern European explorers to reach the cape. When lined up, these crosses point to Whittle Rock, a large, permanently submerged shipping hazard in False Bay. Two other beacons in Simon's Town provide the intersection.\nContemporary.\nThe Cape of Good Hope saw an increase of ship activity after the 2021 Suez canal obstruction, and the 2024 Red Sea Crisis with ships needing a different route from the Indian Ocean. The Cape of Good Hope route took a toll on the sea freight industry\u2014stretching the transit time, reducing carriers availability, and skyrocketing shipment cost and container hire. Carriers' attempts to resort to the Red Sea route came at the expense of vessels and seafarers' safety as the Red Sea witnessed multiple sunken carriers struck by Houthi rebels. Many large shipping companies and industries were afflicted by the situation such as IKEA, Amazon, Automotive companies, and Maersk.\nGeography.\nThe Cape of Good Hope is at the southern tip of the Cape Peninsula, about 2.3 kilometers (1.4\u00a0mi) west and a little south of Cape Point on the south-east corner. Cape Town is about 50 kilometers to the north of the Cape, in Table Bay at the north end of the peninsula. The peninsula forms the western boundary of False Bay. Geologically, the rocks found at the two capes, and indeed over much of the peninsula, are part of the Cape Supergroup, and are formed of the same type of sandstones as Table Mountain itself. Both the Cape of Good Hope and Cape Point offer spectacular scenery; the whole of the southernmost portion of the Cape Peninsula is a wild, rugged, scenic and generally unspoiled national park.\nThe term \"the Cape\" has also been used in a wider sense, to indicate the area of the European colony centered on Cape Town, and the later South African province. Since 1994, it has been broken up into three smaller provinces: the Western Cape, Eastern Cape, and Northern Cape; parts of the province were also absorbed into the North West.\nFauna.\nWith its diverse habitat, ranging from rocky mountain tops to beaches and open sea, the Cape of Good Hope is home to at least 250 species of birds including one of the two mainland colonies of African penguins. \"Bush birds\" tend to be rather scarce because of the coarse, scrubby nature of fynbos vegetation. When flowering, however, proteas and ericas attract sunbirds, sugarbirds, and other species in search of nectar. For most of the year, there are more small birds in coastal thicket than in fynbos. The Cape of Good Hope section of Table Mountain National Park is home to several species of antelope. Bontebok and eland are easily seen, and red hartebeest can be seen in the grazing lawns in Smitswinkel Flats. Grey rhebok are less commonly seen and are scarce, but may be observed along the beach hills at Olifantsbos. Most visitors are unlikely to ever see either Cape grysbok or klipspringer. The Cape of Good Hope section is home to four Cape mountain zebra. They might be seen by the attentive or lucky visitor, usually in Smitswinkel Flats. There are a wealth of small animals such as lizards, snakes, tortoises and insects. Small mammals include rock hyrax, four-striped grass mouse, water mongoose, Cape clawless otter and fallow deer. The area offers excellent vantage points for whale watching. The southern right whale is the species most likely to be seen in False Bay between June and November. Other species are the humpback whale and Bryde's whale. Seals, dusky dolphins and orcas have also been seen. The strategic position of the Cape of Good Hope between two major ocean currents, ensures a rich diversity of marine life. There is a difference between the sea life west of Cape Point and that to the east due to the markedly differing sea temperatures. The South African Marine Living Resources Act is strictly enforced throughout the Table Mountain National Park, and especially in marine protected areas. Disturbance or removal of any marine organisms is strictly prohibited between Schusters Bay and Hoek van Bobbejaan, but is allowed in other areas during season and with relevant permits.\nChacma baboons (\"Papio ursinus\") are the mammals most intimately associated with the Cape of Good Hope. Baboons inside the Cape of Good Hope section of the park are a major tourist attraction. There are 11 troops consisting of about 375 individuals throughout the entire Cape Peninsula. Six of these 11 troops either live entirely within the Cape of Good Hope section of the park, or use the section as part of their range. The Cape Point, Kanonkop, Klein Olifantsbos, and Buffels Bay troops live entirely inside the Cape of Good Hope section of the Park. The Groot Olifantsbos and Plateau Road troops range into the park. Chacma baboons are widely distributed across southern Africa and are classified as \"least concern\" in the http://. However, the South African Parks Department states in its publication \"Mountains in the Sea\" that the baboon population on the Cape is \"critically endangered.\" This is due to habitat loss, genetic isolation, and conflicts with humans. Cape baboons have been eliminated from the majority of their range across the Cape Peninsula, and the Cape of Good Hope section of Table Mountain National Park provides a sanctuary for the troops that live within its boundaries. It provides relative safety from nearby towns, where people have killed many baboons after the baboons raid their houses looking for food. Baboons are also frequently injured or killed outside of the park by cars and by electrocution on power lines. Inside the park, some management policies such as allowing barbecues and picnics in the baboon home ranges cause detriment to the troops, as they become embroiled in conflicts with guests to the park. At the Cape in particular, the baboon is known for eating shellfish and other marine invertebrates.\nIn 1842, Charles Hamilton Smith had described a black-maned lion from the Cape under the scientific name \"Felis (Leo) melanochaita\". No longer seen as a subspecies of its own, the Cape lion as a population is now extinct in the wilderness, though descendants could exist in captivity.\nFlora.\nThe Cape of Good Hope is an integral part of the Cape Floristic Kingdom, the smallest but richest of the world's six floral kingdoms. This comprises a treasure trove of 1100 species of indigenous plants, of which a number are endemic (occur naturally nowhere else on earth). The main type of fynbos (\"fine bush\") vegetation at the Cape of Good Hope is Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos, an endangered vegetation type that is endemic to the Cape Peninsula. Coastal Hangklip Sand Fynbos grows on low-lying alkaline sands and, right by the sea, small patches of Cape Flats Dune Strandveld can be found.\nCharacteristic fynbos plants include proteas, ericas (heath), and restios (reeds). Some of the most striking and well-known members belong to the Proteaceae family, of which up to 24 species occur. These include king protea, sugarbush, tree pincushion and golden cone bush (\"Leucadendron laureolum\").\nMany popular horticultural plants like pelargoniums, freesias, daisies, lilies and irises also have their origins in fynbos.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Hird was a highly decorated footballer, with accolades including the 1996 Brownlow Medal and membership of the Australian Football Hall of Fame. In 2008, he was listed by journalist Mike Sheahan as the 20th greatest player of all time in the AFL-commissioned book \"The Australian Game of Football\".\nHird was appointed as the coach of the Essendon Football Club in September 2010. In August 2013, he was suspended from coaching for 12 months when he was charged by the AFL with conduct prejudicing the game in relation to his role in the Essendon Football Club supplements controversy. He returned to the club following the 2014 season but resigned in August 2015.\nEarly life.\nHird is the son of Allan and Margaret Hird. He was born in Canberra, where his father worked in the public service and his mother was a teacher, although they had met in Melbourne. Hird has two younger sisters. After first living in the Canberra suburb of Ainslie, his family moved to Latham. When Hird was in high school, the family moved to the suburb of Reid.\nHird participated in rugby league, ballet, and soccer in his youth. He played for the Ainslie Football Club in the ACTAFL, and in June 1990, at the age of 17, he was a member of the league's senior representative team in a match against the Victorian Football Association.\nPlaying career.\nEssendon.\nEarly career.\nHe was recruited to the AFL by Essendon from the 1990 AFL draft; however, due to a serious hip injury along with other injuries in his junior football career, he was not selected until pick number 79, Essendon's seventh pick and one of the last in the draft. Due to injury, Hird missed out on playing for most of 1991, his first season with the club. At the end of the season, a vote was held on whether to delist him. The majority (4\u20132) voted in favour of Hird being delisted, but coach Kevin Sheedy, sensing a promising future for the young Hird, voted to keep him. Ultimately, Hird remained with the club. He made his senior debut against St Kilda in 1992 at Waverley Park as a late replacement for former captain Terry Daniher. Hird spent most of the season in the Essendon Reserves, which, under Denis Pagan, won the premiership that season. He achieved regular selection in the Essendon senior team during the 1993 season. In that season, he was a member of what was referred to as the \"Baby Bombers\", a group of young players (most notably including Hird, Mark Mercuri, Gavin Wanganeen, Dustin Fletcher, Ricky Olarenshaw, David Calthorpe, Paul Hills and Joe Misiti) that played a key role in the side winning the premiership that year. In 1994, Hird won the first of three consecutive best-and-fairest awards, culminating in his 1996 season that earned him a Brownlow Medal.\nA series of injuries restricted Hird's appearances during the remainder of the 1990s. He played only seven games in 1997, and, although he was named captain in 1998 (a position he held until the end of 2005), he was restricted to thirteen games that year due to injury-related issues. An even worse year followed in 1999, with stress fractures in his foot keeping him to only two games.\nEarly 2000s.\nIn 2000, both Hird and the Essendon Football Club experienced the most dominant season in AFL football to date. Injury-free, he received numerous honours, including selection in the All-Australian team and the Norm Smith Medal as best on ground in the AFL Grand Final. The Essendon team also won the Ansett Cup pre-season competition as well as the regular season premiership. The team only lost one game\u2014against the Western Bulldogs\u2014in the entire calendar year.\nThe year 2002 then saw Hird's worst injury, a horrific facial injury sustained in a match against Fremantle when he collided with teammate Mark McVeigh's knee, fracturing several bones; Hird was in hospital for a week and missed several weeks of the season.\nIn 2003, despite again missing many games through various injuries (eight games in total), Hird tied with Scott Lucas for the best-and-fairest award. He also narrowly missed out on a second Brownlow Medal, finishing three votes shy of joint winners Mark Ricciuto, Nathan Buckley and Adam Goodes. He gained a place in the 2003 All-Australian team, the fifth and final time in his career.\nOne of Hird's more memorable performances was in his Round 3 game against West Coast in 2004. Up until three-quarter time, Hird had 19 disposals and one goal; in the final quarter, however, he managed 15 disposals and two decisive goals. Despite the incredible effort, and to the consternation of fans, Hird did not receive any Brownlow Medal votes from the umpires for his 34 disposals and clutch goals, which was perceived by some as retribution for his comments earlier in the week against umpire Scott McLaren, for which he was fined $20,000. Hird's winning goal was the focus of a popular instalment of the Toyota Memorable Moments advertising campaign, and the hug is captured in Jamie Cooper's painting \"the Game That Made Australia\", commissioned by the AFL in 2008 to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the sport.\nOn 27 September 2005, Hird handed the captaincy to Matthew Lloyd following the side's 2005 season in which it missed the finals for the first time since 1997.\nAfter Lloyd sustained a season-ending hamstring injury in Round 3, 2006, Hird served briefly as acting captain until young ruckman David Hille was named acting captain for the remainder of the 2006 season.\nHird continued to be an outstanding performer in his utility role when fit, but age was forcing him to miss games through injury with increasing frequency. He suffered broken ribs and a calf strain during his 200th and 250th games, respectively.\nFinal season and retirement.\nDespite much speculation that he would retire at the end of the 2006 season, Hird played out the 2007 season, playing 17 of a possible 22 games. Aged 34, Hird continued to feature prominently among Essendon's best players and concluded his career by winning a fifth best-and-fairest award.\nHird played two farewell games: his final game in Victoria at the Melbourne Cricket Ground against Richmond and his final game overall at Subiaco Oval against West Coast. The games were made higher profile as they were also the final games coached by 27-year coach Kevin Sheedy. Hird was one of the best on field in his final game, with 34 disposals, one shy of his career high. As Hird and Sheedy left the field for the last time, the crowd gave them a standing ovation.\nBefore season 2008, the Archer\u2013Hird Medal was created to honour Hird and former North Melbourne Football Club player and fellow future Australian Football Hall of Fame inductee Glenn Archer. From 2008 until 2013, the medal was awarded to the player showing the most determination, courage and skill in matches between the Kangaroos and the Bombers.\nCoaching career.\nImmediately after Hird retired from playing football, there was much speculation as to whether he would be interested in a coaching role at a club in the AFL, but primarily at Essendon. After initially dodging questions about his future, Hird stated in August 2010 that \"There's something in me, deep in my heart, that says at some point I want to coach Essendon\". These words came as a surprise to many, including former premiership teammate Matthew Lloyd, who said that Hird had \"changed his whole persona in regards to how he's answering his questions... Just in regards to saying, 'I'll coach one day. I want to coach Essendon one day'. Even those type of words, I haven't heard before.\" These comments by Hird, considered to be Essendon's \"favourite son\", furthered speculation towards the future of then-Essendon coach Matthew Knights. A rumour emerged following these comments suggesting that Hird was part of an unofficial agreement with the Essendon board to replace Matthew Knights for the 2011 AFL Season. However, two days after Hird's initial comments, he announced that he had changed his mind due to the intense division and speculation over Matthew Knights' future following Hird's initial comments. Hird stated that he was ruling himself out of coaching Essendon for at least three years.\nEssendon.\nOn 28 September 2010, the rumours were confirmed when Essendon's chief executive officer, Ian Robson, and chairman, David Evans, announced at an official press conference that Hird would be the next senior coach of the Essendon Football Club on a four-year contract.\nHird's coaching career began with the Bombers winning against triple preliminary finalists the Western Bulldogs in the first round. Wins against St Kilda, the Gold Coast (by a record margin of 139 points), West Coast and Brisbane Lions in the first eight rounds saw the Bombers in the top four by round eight, but a draw against Carlton, losses to Sydney and Collingwood and a five-game losing streak halfway through the season saw Essendon drop to tenth on the ladder after Round 14. Hird's team then won by four points against the previously undefeated Geelong in Round 15, whom assistant coach Mark Thompson was coaching against for the first time since his exit from the club. Prior to that match, Essendon had one of the worst records among current AFL clubs against Geelong in recent times, having only beaten the club once since 2003. Hird coached Essendon to the 2011 finals, where they lost against rivals Carlton in an elimination final at the MCG.\nAt the start of the 2012 season, Essendon won eight of their first nine games (the only loss being by one point to Collingwood on ANZAC Day), at which point Essendon were in first position on the league ladder. The club then won 11 of their first 14 games but this was followed by seven consecutive losses until the end of the season. The club ended 2012 in 11th place. A spate of soft-tissue injuries accompanied the decline, as did noticeable fatigue in other players, leading to criticism of the club's fitness and conditioning coach Dean Robinson and, indirectly, Hird and his assistant Thompson for having overseen Robinson's program.\nThe 2013 season was initially a good one for Hird and the football club, during which the team was second on the AFL ladder with a 13\u20133 win\u2013loss record after 17 rounds. However, internal pressure on the club finally took its toll on the players and coach when the AFL banned Essendon from participating in the 2013 finals series. The club on-field performances fell away and lost five of their last six games. In August 2013, he was suspended from coaching for 12 months when he was charged by the AFL with conduct prejudicing the game in relation to his role in the Essendon Football Club supplements controversy.\nBanned from coaching in 2014, Hird spent several months living in France attending an exclusive business school, INSEAD, near Paris. He returned to the club following the 2014 season. Shortly after returning from his suspension, on 2 October 2014, it was reported that Hird was to be sacked by Essendon due to his determination to lodge an appeal against the Federal Court decision handed down the previous month when the club had chosen not to.\nOn 18 August 2015, following a 112-point loss to Adelaide in Round 20, 2015\u2014and a dismal season overall for the Essendon Football Club, by which time they had a 5\u201314 win\u2013loss record and were fifteenth on the AFL ladder\u2014Hird resigned as senior coach.\nGreater Western Sydney.\nOn 17 May 2022, it was announced that Hird would be joining the coaching staff at Greater Western Sydney as part-time assistant coach for the rest of the 2022 season under GWS caretaker senior coach and his former teammate Mark McVeigh, who replaced Leon Cameron after he resigned as the club's senior coach midway through the season. On 2 February 2023, it was announced that Hird left GWS Giants.\nPort Melbourne director of coaching.\nSince 2025, Hird has served as the director of coaching at the Port Melbourne Football Club in the Victorian Football League (VFL).\nMedia career.\nFollowing Hird's retirement as a player from the Bombers at the end of the 2007 AFL season, he became a commentator and football analyst for Australian rules football on Fox Sports, a position which he held until he began his coaching career at the end of 2010. Hird also became a writer for Melbourne newspaper the \"Herald Sun\". At the start of 2025, Hird joined the Nine Network, becoming a panellist on the Tuesday night edition of \"Footy Classified\", as well as Sunday night program Footy Furnace.\nHonours.\nHird jointly won the Brownlow Medal with Michael Voss in 1996, the award for the fairest and best player in the Australian Football League. After his retirement, Hird stated that being a member of the \"Brownlow Club\" was a privilege.\nIn 1997, the Essendon Football Club named the then-triple best and fairest winner in its Team of the Century on the half-forward flank.\nIn 2002, the Essendon Football Club conducted a fan-voted promotion to find the \"Champions of Essendon\". Hird was eventually named as the number three player on the all-time list of Essendon players.\nSupplements controversy.\nIn April 2013, Hird, as coach, was accused of being personally injected with supplements in 2011 and 2012 that would be deemed performance enhancing if he were a player. Essendon players from 2011 and 2012 were also accused of ingesting performance enhancing supplements. As head coach, Hird was subsequently implicated.\nFollowing months of rumours and investigations, on 13 August 2013, Hird, along with the Essendon Football Club, senior assistant coach Mark Thompson, football manager Danny Corcoran and club doctor Bruce Reid, was charged by the AFL with bringing the game into disrepute in relation to the poor governance of the supplements program at the club in 2011 and 2012. The club was given 14 days to consider the charges and faced an AFL Commission hearing on 26 August 2013.\nOn 27 August 2013, following much negotiation, Hird accepted charges that he had brought the game into disrepute and abandoned possible Supreme Court action against the AFL and its chief executive, Andrew Demetriou. He maintained that he did little wrong, but said he should have known more about the club's supplements program. He was banned from working at any AFL club in any capacity for twelve months commencing from 25 August 2013. Hird was allowed to attend Essendon matches as a spectator during this period. However, despite not being allowed to pay him for working as a coach during 2014, the club paid Hird $1 million in advance for 2014 in December 2013.\nA media report on 3 October 2013 said that Hird denied pleading guilty for a reduced charge as alleged by Demetriou. Hird's lawyer, Steven Amendola, asserted that the AFL withdrew all charges against Hird under the deeds of settlement that he and the club signed with the AFL. At the time of the media report, Hird was considering legal action against both the AFL and Demetriou.\nEssendon chairman Paul Little said that Hird would be wanted as the senior coach once his suspension was served and that he had been offered a two-year extension from 2015, which would have seen him coaching until the end of the 2016 season. However, Hird resigned after round 20 in August 2015, near the end of the season, with the team near the bottom of the ladder.\nPersonal life.\nHird married Tania Poynton on 11 October 1997. Around the time of the marriage, Poynton was working as a lawyer at legal firm \"Corrs Chambers Westgarth\", where she remained until 2002. The couple have since separated. Hird shares four children with Tania: a daughter and three sons. One of his sons, Thomas Hird, was signed as a category B rookie at Essendon in 2019 and was delisted by Essendon in 2022. Tom Hird now plays for the Port Melbourne Football Club in the Victorian Football League. \nHird's paternal grandfather, the late Allan Hird, Sr., was a notable player for and president of the Essendon Football Club, and his father, Allan Hird, Jr., had a brief playing career with Essendon.\nHird completed a bachelor's degree in civil engineering in 1998 and worked in that capacity as a consultant on the CityLink project. He has also spent time working for a stockbroking firm and is an active partner in Gemba, a sports marketing and media consultancy firm based in Melbourne. He is the founder and managing director of Euree Asset Management, where he currently works.\nOn 5 January 2017, Hird was taken to a private hospital following a drug overdose and suspected suicide attempt and was subsequently transferred to a specialist mental health care facility for further care and treatment.\nOn 28 November 2018, Hird was hit by a car when cycling in Richmond.\nStatistics.\nPlaying statistics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"alternating rows table/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCoaching statistics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"alternating rows table/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHonours and achievements.\nTeam\nIndividual\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Microsatellites occur at thousands of locations within an organism's genome. They have a higher mutation rate than other areas of DNA leading to high genetic diversity. Microsatellites are often referred to as short tandem repeats (STRs) by forensic geneticists and in genetic genealogy, or as simple sequence repeats (SSRs) by plant geneticists.\nMicrosatellites and their longer cousins, the minisatellites, together are classified as VNTR (variable number of tandem repeats) DNA. The name \"satellite\" DNA refers to the early observation that centrifugation of genomic DNA in a test tube separates a prominent layer of bulk DNA from accompanying \"satellite\" layers of repetitive DNA.\nThey are widely used for DNA profiling in cancer diagnosis, in kinship analysis (especially paternity testing) and in forensic identification. They are also used in genetic linkage analysis to locate a gene or a mutation responsible for a given trait or disease. Microsatellites are also used in population genetics to measure levels of relatedness between subspecies, groups and individuals.\nHistory.\nAlthough the first microsatellite was characterised in 1984 at the University of Leicester by Weller, Jeffreys and colleagues as a polymorphic GGAT repeat in the human myoglobin gene, the term \"microsatellite\" was introduced later, in 1989, by Litt and Luty. The name \"satellite\" DNA refers to the early observation that centrifugation of genomic DNA in a test tube separates a prominent layer of bulk DNA from accompanying \"satellite\" layers of repetitive DNA. The increasing availability of DNA amplification by PCR at the beginning of the 1990s triggered a large number of studies using the amplification of microsatellites as genetic markers for forensic medicine, for paternity testing, and for positional cloning to find the gene underlying a trait or disease. Prominent early applications include the identifications by microsatellite genotyping of the eight-year-old skeletal remains of a British murder victim (Hagelberg et al. 1991), and of the Auschwitz concentration camp doctor Josef Mengele who escaped to South America following World War II (Jeffreys et al. 1992).\nStructures, locations, and functions.\nA microsatellite is a tract of tandemly repeated (i.e. adjacent) DNA motifs that range in length from one to six or up to ten nucleotides (the exact definition and delineation to the longer minisatellites varies from author to author), and are typically repeated 5\u201350 times. For example, the sequence TATATATATA is a dinucleotide microsatellite, and GTCGTCGTCGTCGTC is a trinucleotide microsatellite (with A being Adenine, G Guanine, C Cytosine, and T Thymine). Repeat units of four and five nucleotides are referred to as tetra- and pentanucleotide motifs, respectively. Most eukaryotes have microsatellites, with the notable exception of some yeast species. Microsatellites are distributed throughout the genome. The human genome for example contains 50,000\u2013100,000 dinucleotide microsatellites, and lesser numbers of tri-, tetra- and pentanucleotide microsatellites. Many are located in non-coding parts of the human genome and therefore do not produce proteins, but they can also be located in regulatory regions and coding regions.\nMicrosatellites in non-coding regions may not have any specific function, and therefore might not be selected against; this allows them to accumulate mutations unhindered over the generations and gives rise to variability that can be used for DNA fingerprinting and identification purposes. Other microsatellites are located in regulatory flanking or intronic regions of genes, or directly in codons of genes\u00a0\u2013 microsatellite mutations in such cases can lead to phenotypic changes and diseases, notably in triplet expansion diseases such as fragile X syndrome and Huntington's disease.\nTelomeres are linear sequences of DNA that sit at the very ends of chromosomes and protect the integrity of genomic material (not unlike an aglet on the end of a shoelace) during successive rounds of cell division due to the \"end replication problem\". In white blood cells, the gradual shortening of telomeric DNA has been shown to inversely correlate with ageing in several sample types. Telomeres consist of repetitive DNA, with the hexanucleotide repeat motif TTAGGG in vertebrates. They are thus classified as minisatellites. Similarly, insects have shorter repeat motifs in their telomeres that could arguably be considered microsatellites.\nMutation mechanisms and mutation rates.\nUnlike point mutations, which affect only a single nucleotide, microsatellite mutations lead to the gain or loss of an entire repeat unit, and sometimes two or more repeats simultaneously. Thus, the mutation rate at microsatellite loci is expected to differ from other mutation rates, such as base substitution rates. The mutation rate at microsatellite loci depends on the repeat motif sequence, the number of repeated motif units and the purity of the canonical repeated sequence. A variety of mechanisms for mutation of microsatellite loci have been reviewed, and their resulting polymorphic nature has been quantified. The actual cause of mutations in microsatellites is debated.\nOne proposed cause of such length changes is replication slippage, caused by mismatches between DNA strands while being replicated during meiosis. DNA polymerase, the enzyme responsible for reading DNA during replication, can slip while moving along the template strand and continue at the wrong nucleotide. DNA polymerase slippage is more likely to occur when a repetitive sequence (such as CGCGCG) is replicated. Because microsatellites consist of such repetitive sequences, DNA polymerase may make errors at a higher rate in these sequence regions. Several studies have found evidence that slippage is the cause of microsatellite mutations. Typically, slippage in each microsatellite occurs about once per 1,000 generations. Thus, slippage changes in repetitive DNA are three orders of magnitude more common than point mutations in other parts of the genome. Most slippage results in a change of just one repeat unit, and slippage rates vary for different allele lengths and repeat unit sizes, and within different species. If there is a large size difference between individual alleles, then there may be increased instability during recombination at meiosis.\nAnother possible cause of microsatellite mutations are point mutations, where only one nucleotide is incorrectly copied during replication. A study comparing human and primate genomes found that most changes in repeat number in short microsatellites appear due to point mutations rather than slippage.\nMicrosatellite mutation rates.\nDirect estimates of microsatellite mutation rates have been made in numerous organisms, from insects to humans. In the desert locust \"Schistocerca gregaria\", the microsatellite mutation rate was estimated at 2.1\u00a0\u00d7 10\u22124 per generation per locus. The microsatellite mutation rate in human male germ lines is five to six times higher than in female germ lines and ranges from 0 to 7\u00a0\u00d7 10\u22123 per locus per gamete per generation. In the nematode \"Pristionchus pacificus\", the estimated microsatellite mutation rate ranges from 8.9\u00a0\u00d7 10\u22125 to 7.5\u00a0\u00d7 10\u22124 per locus per generation.\nMicrosatellite mutation rates vary with base position relative to the microsatellite, repeat type, and base identity. Mutation rate rises specifically with repeat number, peaking around six to eight repeats and then decreasing again. Increased heterozygosity in a population will also increase microsatellite mutation rates, especially when there is a large length difference between alleles. This is likely due to homologous chromosomes with arms of unequal lengths causing instability during meiosis.\nBiological effects of microsatellite mutations.\nMany microsatellites are located in non-coding DNA and are biologically silent. Others are located in regulatory or even coding DNA\u00a0\u2013 microsatellite mutations in such cases can lead to phenotypic changes and diseases. A genome-wide study estimates that microsatellite variation contributes 10\u201315% of heritable gene expression variation in humans.\nEffects on proteins.\nIn mammals, 20\u201340% of proteins contain repeating sequences of amino acids encoded by short sequence repeats. Most of the short sequence repeats within protein-coding portions of the genome have a repeating unit of three nucleotides, since that length will not cause frame-shifts when mutating. Each trinucleotide repeating sequence is transcribed into a repeating series of the same amino acid. In yeasts, the most common repeated amino acids are glutamine, glutamic acid, asparagine, aspartic acid and serine.\nMutations in these repeating segments can affect the physical and chemical properties of proteins, with the potential for producing gradual and predictable changes in protein action. For example, length changes in tandemly repeating regions in the Runx2 gene lead to differences in facial length in domesticated dogs (\"Canis familiaris\"), with an association between longer sequence lengths and longer faces. This association also applies to a wider range of Carnivora species. Length changes in polyalanine tracts within the HOXA13 gene are linked to hand-foot-genital syndrome, a developmental disorder in humans. Length changes in other triplet repeats are linked to more than 40 neurological diseases in humans, notably trinucleotide repeat disorders such as fragile X syndrome and Huntington's disease. Evolutionary changes from replication slippage also occur in simpler organisms. For example, microsatellite length changes are common within surface membrane proteins in yeast, providing rapid evolution in cell properties. Specifically, length changes in the FLO1 gene control the level of adhesion to substrates. Short sequence repeats also provide rapid evolutionary change to surface proteins in pathenogenic bacteria; this may allow them to keep up with immunological changes in their hosts. Length changes in short sequence repeats in a fungus (\"Neurospora crassa\") control the duration of its circadian clock cycles.\nEffects on gene regulation.\nLength changes of microsatellites within promoters and other cis-regulatory regions can change gene expression quickly, between generations. The human genome contains many (&gt;16,000) short sequence repeats in regulatory regions, which provide 'tuning knobs' on the expression of many genes.\nLength changes in bacterial SSRs can affect fimbriae formation in \"Haemophilus influenzae\", by altering promoter spacing. Dinucleotide microsatellites are linked to abundant variation in cis-regulatory control regions in the human genome. Microsatellites in control regions of the Vasopressin 1a receptor gene in voles influence their social behavior, and level of monogamy.\nIn Ewing sarcoma (a type of painful bone cancer in young humans), a point mutation has created an extended GGAA microsatellite which binds a transcription factor, which in turn activates the EGR2 gene which drives the cancer. In addition, other GGAA microsatellites may influence the expression of genes that contribute to the clinical outcome of Ewing sarcoma patients.\nEffects within introns.\nMicrosatellites within introns also influence phenotype, through means that are not currently understood. For example, a GAA triplet expansion in the first intron of the X25 gene appears to interfere with transcription, and causes Friedreich's ataxia. Tandem repeats in the first intron of the Asparagine synthetase gene are linked to acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. A repeat polymorphism in the fourth intron of the NOS3 gene is linked to hypertension in a Tunisian population. Reduced repeat lengths in the EGFR gene are linked with osteosarcomas.\nAn archaic form of splicing preserved in zebrafish is known to use microsatellite sequences within intronic mRNA for the removal of introns in the absence of U2AF2 and other splicing machinery. It is theorized that these sequences form highly stable cloverleaf configurations that bring the 3' and 5' intron splice sites into close proximity, effectively replacing the spliceosome. This method of RNA splicing is believed to have diverged from human evolution at the formation of tetrapods and to represent an artifact of an RNA world.\nEffects within transposons.\nAlmost 50% of the human genome is contained in various types of transposable elements (also called transposons, or 'jumping genes'), and many of them contain repetitive DNA. It is probable that short sequence repeats in those locations are also involved in the regulation of gene expression.\nApplications.\nMicrosatellites are used for assessing chromosomal DNA deletions in cancer diagnosis. Microsatellites are widely used for DNA profiling, also known as \"genetic fingerprinting\", of crime stains (in forensics) and of tissues (in transplant patients). They are also widely used in kinship analysis (most commonly in paternity testing). Also, microsatellites are used for mapping locations within the genome, specifically in genetic linkage analysis to locate a gene or a mutation responsible for a given trait or disease. As a special case of mapping, they can be used for studies of gene duplication or deletion. Researchers use microsatellites in population genetics and in species conservation projects. Plant geneticists have proposed the use of microsatellites for marker assisted selection of desirable traits in plant breeding.\nCancer diagnosis.\nIn tumour cells, whose controls on replication are damaged, microsatellites may be gained or lost at an especially high frequency during each round of mitosis. Hence a tumour cell line might show a different genetic fingerprint from that of the host tissue, and, especially in colorectal cancer, might present with loss of heterozygosity. Microsatellites analyzed in primary tissue therefore been routinely used in cancer diagnosis to assess tumour progression. Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have been used to identify microsatellite biomarkers as a source of genetic predisposition in a variety of cancers.\nForensic and medical fingerprinting.\nMicrosatellite analysis became popular in the field of forensics in the 1990s. It is used for the genetic fingerprinting of individuals where it permits forensic identification (typically matching a crime stain to a victim or perpetrator). It is also used to follow up bone marrow transplant patients.\nThe microsatellites in use today for forensic analysis are all tetra- or penta-nucleotide repeats, as these give a high degree of error-free data while being short enough to survive degradation in non-ideal conditions. Even shorter repeat sequences would tend to suffer from artifacts such as PCR stutter and preferential amplification, while longer repeat sequences would suffer more highly from environmental degradation and would amplify less well by PCR. Another forensic consideration is that the person's medical privacy must be respected, so that forensic STRs are chosen which are non-coding, do not influence gene regulation, and are not usually trinucleotide STRs which could be involved in triplet expansion diseases such as Huntington's disease. Forensic STR profiles are stored in DNA databanks such as the UK National DNA Database (NDNAD), the American CODIS or the Australian NCIDD.\nKinship analysis (paternity testing).\nAutosomal microsatellites are widely used for DNA profiling in kinship analysis (most commonly in paternity testing). Paternally inherited Y-STRs (microsatellites on the Y chromosome) are often used in genealogical DNA testing.\nGenetic linkage analysis.\nDuring the 1990s and the first several years of this millennium, microsatellites were the workhorse genetic markers for genome-wide scans to locate any gene responsible for a given phenotype or disease, using segregation observations across generations of a sampled pedigree. Although the rise of higher throughput and cost-effective single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) platforms led to the era of the SNP for genome scans, microsatellites remain highly informative measures of genomic variation for linkage and association studies. Their continued advantage lies in their greater allelic diversity than biallelic SNPs, thus microsatellites can differentiate alleles within a SNP-defined linkage disequilibrium block of interest. Thus, microsatellites have successfully led to discoveries of type 2 diabetes (TCF7L2) and prostate cancer genes (the 8q21 region).\nPopulation genetics.\nMicrosatellites were popularized in population genetics during the 1990s because as PCR became ubiquitous in laboratories researchers were able to design primers and amplify sets of microsatellites at low cost. Their uses are wide-ranging. A microsatellite with a neutral evolutionary history makes it applicable for measuring or inferring bottlenecks, local adaptation, the allelic fixation index (FST), population size, and gene flow. As next generation sequencing becomes more affordable the use of microsatellites has decreased, however they remain a crucial tool in the field.\nPlant breeding.\nMarker assisted selection or marker aided selection (MAS) is an indirect selection process where a trait of interest is selected based on a marker (morphological, biochemical or DNA/RNA variation) linked to a trait of interest (e.g. productivity, disease resistance, stress tolerance, and quality), rather than on the trait itself. Microsatellites have been proposed to be used as such markers to assist plant breeding.\nAnalysis.\nRepetitive DNA is not easily analysed by next generation DNA sequencing methods, for some technologies struggle with homopolymeric tracts. A variety of software approaches have been created for the analysis or raw nextgen DNA sequencing reads to determine the genotype and variants at repetitive loci. Microsatellites can be analysed and verified by established PCR amplification and amplicon size determination, sometimes followed by Sanger DNA sequencing.\nIn forensics, the analysis is performed by extracting nuclear DNA from the cells of a sample of interest, then amplifying specific polymorphic regions of the extracted DNA by means of the polymerase chain reaction. Once these sequences have been amplified, they are resolved either through gel electrophoresis or capillary electrophoresis, which will allow the analyst to determine how many repeats of the microsatellites sequence in question there are. If the DNA was resolved by gel electrophoresis, the DNA can be visualized either by silver staining (low sensitivity, safe, inexpensive), or an intercalating dye such as ethidium bromide (fairly sensitive, moderate health risks, inexpensive), or as most modern forensics labs use, fluorescent dyes (highly sensitive, safe, expensive). Instruments built to resolve microsatellite fragments by capillary electrophoresis also use fluorescent dyes. Forensic profiles are stored in major databanks. The British data base for microsatellite loci identification was originally based on the British SGM+ system using 10 loci and a sex marker. The Americans increased this number to 13 loci. The Australian database is called the NCIDD, and since 2013 it has been using 18 core markers for DNA profiling.\nAmplification.\nMicrosatellites can be amplified for identification by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) process, using the unique sequences of flanking regions as primers. DNA is repeatedly denatured at a high temperature to separate the double strand, then cooled to allow annealing of primers and the extension of nucleotide sequences through the microsatellite. This process results in production of enough DNA to be visible on agarose or polyacrylamide gels; only small amounts of DNA are needed for amplification because in this way thermocycling creates an exponential increase in the replicated segment. With the abundance of PCR technology, primers that flank microsatellite loci are simple and quick to use, but the development of correctly functioning primers is often a tedious and costly process.\nDesign of microsatellite primers.\nIf searching for microsatellite markers in specific regions of a genome, for example within a particular intron, primers can be designed manually. This involves searching the genomic DNA sequence for microsatellite repeats, which can be done by eye or by using automated tools such as http://. Once the potentially useful microsatellites are determined, the flanking sequences can be used to design oligonucleotide primers which will amplify the specific microsatellite repeat in a PCR reaction.\nRandom microsatellite primers can be developed by cloning random segments of DNA from the focal species. These random segments are inserted into a plasmid or bacteriophage vector, which is in turn implanted into \"Escherichia coli\" bacteria. Colonies are then developed, and screened with fluorescently\u2013labelled oligonucleotide sequences that will hybridize to a microsatellite repeat, if present on the DNA segment. If positive clones can be obtained from this procedure, the DNA is sequenced and PCR primers are chosen from sequences flanking such regions to determine a specific locus. This process involves significant trial and error on the part of researchers, as microsatellite repeat sequences must be predicted and primers that are randomly isolated may not display significant polymorphism. Microsatellite loci are widely distributed throughout the genome and can be isolated from semi-degraded DNA of older specimens, as all that is needed is a suitable substrate for amplification through PCR.\nMore recent techniques involve using oligonucleotide sequences consisting of repeats complementary to repeats in the microsatellite to \"enrich\" the DNA extracted (microsatellite enrichment). The oligonucleotide probe hybridizes with the repeat in the microsatellite, and the probe/microsatellite complex is then pulled out of solution. The enriched DNA is then cloned as normal, but the proportion of successes will now be much higher, drastically reducing the time required to develop the regions for use. However, which probes to use can be a trial and error process in itself.\nISSR-PCR.\nISSR (for inter-simple sequence repeat) is a general term for a genome region between microsatellite loci. The complementary sequences to two neighboring microsatellites are used as PCR primers; the variable region between them gets amplified. The limited length of amplification cycles during PCR prevents excessive replication of overly long contiguous DNA sequences, so the result will be a mix of a variety of amplified DNA strands which are generally short but vary much in length.\nSequences amplified by ISSR-PCR can be used for DNA fingerprinting. Since an ISSR may be a conserved or nonconserved region, this technique is not useful for distinguishing individuals, but rather for phylogeography analyses or maybe delimiting species; sequence diversity is lower than in SSR-PCR, but still higher than in actual gene sequences. In addition, microsatellite sequencing and ISSR sequencing are mutually assisting, as one produces primers for the other.\nLimitations.\nRepetitive DNA is not easily analysed by next generation DNA sequencing methods, which struggle with homopolymeric tracts. Therefore, microsatellites are normally analysed by conventional PCR amplification and amplicon size determination. The use of PCR means that microsatellite length analysis is prone to PCR limitations like any other PCR-amplified DNA locus. A particular concern is the occurrence of 'null alleles':\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The islands are part of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge. The Siberian coast is roughly northwest. About in total area, they are mostly rocky and are covered with tundra, with a population of 572 as of the 2010 census.\nPrincipal islands.\nThe principal islands are Saint Paul and Saint George. The former was named for the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul, on the day of which the island was first encountered by the Russian explorer Gavriil Pribylov; the latter was probably named for the ship sailed by Pribylov. The Otter and Walrus islets are near St. Paul. The total land area of all the islands is . The islands are part of the Bering Sea unit of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge.\nFur trade.\nWhile oral traditions of the Aleut people maintain the islands were sparingly visited, \"no ethnohistoric or archaeological evidence points to the use or occupation of the Pribilof Islands... by any native people before the Russian period in Alaska.\" The seasonal migrations of the northern fur seal became known by the Russians in the 1780s. Swimming north through the Aleutian Islands, the seals returned in the autumn with newly born pups. The unknown northern breeding grounds became a focus of Russian trappers. An employee of the Lebedev-Lastochkin Company, Gavriil Pribylov, sailed in 1786 to discover the location, after disobeying orders to retrieve company property in the Kurile Islands. The rookeries Pribylov visited held upwards of four million seals, for which they became famous. The islands became the site of the LLC's first artel in what later became Russian America.\nWith the creation of the Russian-American Company, a monopoly, Russian operations continued on the islands. Under the Alaska Purchase sovereignty was passed to the United States in 1867. From 1870 to 1890, the U.S. government leased them to the Alaska Commercial Company. From 1890 through 1910, the North American Commercial Company held the monopoly on seal-hunting there, but the industry shrank considerably owing to seal-hunting on the open sea.\nThe North Pacific Fur Seal Convention of 1911 was signed by the United Kingdom, Japan, Russia, and the United States to restrict hunting in the area. Under the Fur Seal Act of 1966, hunting of the seals was forbidden in the Pribilofs, with the exception of subsistence hunting by native Aleuts.\nAmbrose Bierce suggested that the island should adopt for its motto 'locus sigilli' (\"Place of the Seal (emblem)\") in his \"The Devil's Dictionary\".\nA post office was established for the Pribilofs in 1948 at St. Paul, with Mrs. Ruth Anderson as postmistress.\nSeal Island Historic District.\nNaturalist and paleontologist Roy Chapman Andrews visited the islands in 1913 aboard the schooner \"Adventuress\" on her maiden voyage with John Borden and crew. His films of fur seals led to efforts to protect the animals. The buildings on St. George and St. Paul Islands related to the hunting of the northern fur seal make up the national historic district.\nToday.\nResidents are concentrated in the towns of St. Paul and St. George, each on the island of the same name. Many of the residents of the islands are related. St. Paul and St. George each have small airports; air service is provided from the Alaskan mainland.\nSt. Paul has a population of 479 (2010 census), with its economy heavily dependent on the annual taking of the snow crab and on subsistence and commercial halibut harvests. Support services to commercial fleets plying the waters of the Bering Sea also contribute to the economy. The balance of economic activity on the island relates to working for the United States Government. The U.S. Coast Guard maintains a base on St. Paul, but no longer maintains a LORAN-C master station, as LORAN technology has been replaced by satellite navigation. The National Weather Service has a station on the island, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration maintains a presence.\nSt. George has a population of 102. Its economy is similar to that of St. Paul.\nThe Pribilof Islands are a birdwatching attraction, home to many species that do not fly in North America beyond Alaska. More than 210 species have been identified, and an estimated two million seabirds nest there annually. St. Paul is particularly popular, having a high cliff wall, known as Ridge Wall, above the Bering Sea.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Metafont was devised by Donald Knuth as a companion to his TeX typesetting system.\nOne of the characteristics of Metafont is that the points defining the shapes of the glyphs\u2014for example top of a stem, or intersection of a stem and crossbar\u2014are defined with geometrical equations; the intent that the three stems of an \u2018m\u2019 are equally spaced horizontally might be expressed as formula_1 if points 1, 2, and 3 are at the bottom ends of the three stems, whereas the intent that they all end on the same vertical position would be formula_2.\nMetafont is a macro language, where operations such as \"draw a lower case top of stem serif at point 4\" might appear as one macro instruction (with the point as argument) in the program for a letter. For describing shapes, Metafont has a rich set of path construction operations that mostly relieves the user of having to calculate control points.\nMany families of Metafont fonts are set up so that the main source file for a font only defines a small number of design parameters (x-height, em width, slant, vertical stroke width, etc.), then calling a separate source file common for a whole range of fonts to actually draw the individual glyphs; this is the meta aspect of the system.\nModes of operation.\nMetafont is most often run as a helper to output device (printer, screen) drivers; in those cases, its job is to generate bitmaps for a font for a specific combination of output device (called a \"mode\" in Metafont) and resolution (visible in the name of the output file, see below). These bitmaps are typically stored for later reuse, so that Metafont does not have to be run every time a document is displayed, but on the other hand TeX distributions with a Metafont component have typically not included any prebuilt bitmap fonts, since they would be rather large in comparison to the sources from which they could be generated. Since Metafont fonts were traditionally the TeX default from which other font formats were exceptions, an incomplete installation of a non-Metafont font can sometimes result in Metafont being called and emitting a confusing \"\"somefont\".mf not found\" error message.\nEqually important, but not as common, is running Metafont to generate a font metric (TFM) file; a TFM file is only generated if the \"fontmaking\" variable is positive. Traditionally TeX distributions have often come with all TFM files pregenerated (since they are pretty small), but someone installing a Metafont font from sources will have to generate its TFM file before TeX can use it.\nA third way of operating Metafont is \"proof mode\": if the \"proofing\" variable is positive then the bitmap font file also contains additional information provided via codice_1 commands, in particular the positions and names of points the font designer considered important for the design. If using the separate codice_2 utility to generate enlarged images of the font glyphs, this information from specials is included; point positions are not limited to pixel resolution.\nMetafont can also be run interactively, and has commands for displaying on the screen the images it produces. Knuth has said that he uses Metafont as a kind of desk calculator for solving complicated equations, though he now uses MetaPost for mathematical illustrations.\nMetafont can render any kind of graphical output, not just glyphs. However, MetaPost and Asymptote are preferred for mathematical illustrations. Metafont is most commonly invoked without a direct request from the user. DVI files can only contain references to typefaces, rather than the sets of raster or vector glyphs that other formats like PostScript allow. Consequently, the glyphs in the typefaces need to be accessed whenever a request is made to view, print or convert a DVI file.\nOutput files.\nMetafont outputs several kinds of files: for a file called NAME.mf, it can output:\nAfter running Metafont, typically one uses the gftopk program to convert the NNNNgf files to pk (packed) format (.NNNNpk). The pk format was primarily introduced to reduce file size (to about half), but expected to also speed up processing since less data would have to be input/output. The GF and PK formats both employ run-length encoding of bitmaps, but make different binary encodings of the run-lengths. The PK format also does some preprocessing of the bitmaps (bounding box, eliding repeated rows) and encodes all rows of a character as one long bit-sequence.\nIn the \"TeX Directory Structure\" standard, filenames are limited to 8+3 characters, so GF and PK files would only have extensions codice_3 and codice_4. Files for different resolutions are kept apart by placing them in separate directories, named codice_5NNNN, e.g. codice_6.\nLanguage.\nThe Metafont language is an interpreted language for programs that are \"essentially declarative rather than imperative\".\nVariables and equations.\nVariables in Metafont can be of eight different types:\nMetapost adds color (a triple of numerics) as a ninth type and has a completely different (non-raster) model for pictures; the latter is the main point of divergence between the two programs. Metafont vardef macros also live in the same namespace as variables and may in some ways be regarded as a ninth type of variable, although macros do not exist as first-class values in Metafont.\nUnusually, the names of variables are not simple tokens, but sequences of symbolic tokens and numeric indices; the variable name codice_7 is thus not one alphanumeric token, but a sequence of the three tokens codice_8 (symbolic), codice_9 (numeric), and codice_10 (symbolic). Record and array types may be simulated through collections of variables that share a common name prefix, an idiom supported by the type declaration system giving all variables whose names which differ only in numeric indices the same type (as expected for arrays) while keeping variables whole name differ in some symbolic token separate (as expected for records).\nA very distinctive feature of Metafont is the use of equations to define variables. A numeric variable (or component of a pair or transformation variable) may be in the three states \"known\" (set), \"unknown independent\" (not set), and \"unknown dependent\" (not set, but given by a linear expression of one or several independents). When Metafont executes an equation statement, it turns one of the independents involved into a dependent and eliminates it from the expressions for all other dependents; when no independents remain in the expression for a dependent variable, that variable becomes known. Solving \"linear\" equation systems thus is a built-in feature of the Metafont language, and the recommended method of assigning most variables (especially those whose values have geometric significance) is to state equations determining their values. Equation systems frequently mix numeric (scalar) equations with pair (vector) equations.\nAn exception to the above is the class of \"internal quantity\" variables. These have names consisting of just one symbolic token, are always numeric, and are always known. They have a more direct internal representation than ordinary variables, making it convenient for primitive operations in Metafont (or extensions thereof) to use them implicitly.\nSyntax.\nMetafont has numeric and string constant tokens with mainstream syntaxes; strings are delimited by codice_11 quotes, numeric constants can have decimals but not an exponent part. All other tokens are classified as \"symbolic\", and can be redefined arbitrarily; there is no restriction that tokens with certain meanings must have names consisting of certain characters. At runtime, there can additionally be \"capsule\" tokens, which are effectively constant value tokens of arbitrary type; in the source code those appear as symbolic tokens.\nExcept where characters are involved in numeric or string constants, the extent of the token containing a particular character depends on to which class the character belongs; unlike TeX, Metafont has fixed character classes. The characters codice_12, codice_13, codice_14, and codice_15 are \"loners\" and only form single character tokens. For the character classes codice_16, codice_17 (single quotes), codice_18, codice_19, codice_20, codice_21, codice_22, codice_23, codice_24, codice_25, and codice_26, as well as the class of underscore together with upper and lower case A\u2013Z, the token consists of the longest consecutive sequence of characters from the same class. Whitespace characters don't contribute tokens. codice_27 starts a comment lasting until end of line.\nA notable application of these rules is that codice_28 is frequently appearing as part of variable names in Metafont code, e.g. codice_29 and codice_30.\nDelimiters (such as parentheses) do not have built-in meanings, instead there is a command that turns two symbolic tokens into a pair of matching delimiters, but normally Metafont programs use only the ordinary parentheses. Besides to override priorities in expressions, delimiters are also required around certain kinds of macro arguments.\nGraphics.\nCurves in Metafont are defined as cubic splines, rather than quadratic, for greater versatility at the cost of more complex arithmetic.\nUnlike more common outline font formats (such as TrueType or PostScript Type 1), a Metafont font is primarily made up of strokes with finite-width \"pens\", along with filled regions. Thus, rather than describing the outline of the glyph directly, a Metafont file describes the pen paths. Some simpler Metafont fonts, such as the calligraphic mathematics fonts in the Computer Modern family, use a single pen stroke with a relatively large pen to define each visual \"stroke\" of the glyphs. More complex fonts such as the Roman text fonts in the Computer Modern family use a small pen to trace around the outline of the visual \"strokes\", which are then filled; the result is much like an outline font, but with slightly softened corners defined by the pen shape.\nSince the font shapes are defined by equations rather than directly coded numbers, it is possible to treat parameters such as aspect ratio, font slant, stroke width, serif size, and so forth as input parameters in each glyph definition (which then define not a single font, but a meta-font). Thus, by changing the value of one of these parameters at one location in the Metafont file, one can produce a consistent change throughout the entire font. Computer Modern Roman illustrates many uses of this feature; a typical TeX installation includes a number of versions of the font in pitches from 5 to 17 cpi, with the stroke widths the same in all sizes (rather than increasing as the font is scaled up). In addition, the Computer Modern typewriter and sans-serif fonts are defined using essentially the same Metafont file as the Roman font, but with different global parameters.\nUse.\nWhile well-known type designers, such as Hermann Zapf, have collaborated with Knuth to create new fonts using Metafont, the system has not been widely adopted by professional type designers. Knuth attributes this to the fact that \"asking an artist to become enough of a mathematician to understand how to write a font with 60 parameters is too much.\"\nThe Metafont system allows fonts to be processed in unusual ways; in 1982, Knuth showed how it could be used to morph fonts, with a serif font slowly transitioning into a sans-serif design over the course of a text.\nHistory.\nDonald Knuth started work on font creation software in 1977, and produced the first version of Metafont in 1979. Due to shortcomings in the original Metafont language, Knuth developed an entirely new Metafont system in 1984, and it is this revised system that is used today; Metafont has a versioning system similar to that of TeX, where the number asymptotically approaches \"e\" with each revision.\nExample.\nThe following example creates a closed beanlike shape for the character \"B\" of a font:\n%file name: beta.mf\n%mode_setup;\n% Define a beanlike shape for the character B\nbeginchar(\"B\",11pt#,11pt#,0);\n % Setup coordinates as an equation system\n y1=y2=y3=0;\n y4=y5=y6=h;\n x1=x4=0;\n x2=x5=w;\n x3=x6=2*w;\n % Define pen\n pickup pencircle xscaled 0.2w yscaled 0.04w rotated 45;\n % Draw the character curve\n % z1 is the same as (x1, y1)\n draw z1..z3..z6{z2-z6}..z5..{z4-z2}z4..cycle;\nendchar;\nend\nThis yields the following glyph:\nThe above example will be processed with a command line such as:\nmf '\\mode=ljfour; mode_setup; input beta.mf';\ngftopk beta.600gf beta.600pk\nThen it can be used in a LaTeX file such as the following (all files should dwell in the same directory, or the TeX system should be informed about them using appropriate methods):\nLet's try having a strange \\otherbeta\\ here.\nThe resulting PDF file should look like this:\nProducing PostScript Type 1 fonts.\nThere are several tools for converting Metafont programs to PostScript Type 1 fonts. Most make use of MetaPost's ability to convert a subset of Metafont's language into EPS outlines, which can subsequently be converted to PostScript Type 1 fonts. Generating vector outlines of Metafont pen strokes is nontrivial, as the Metafont model of a glyph is a raster image and the exact outlines of most strokes are not B\u00e9zier curves.\nThe common approach to generate Type 1 fonts with pen strokes remains to generate a high-resolution bitmap and then use an autotracer, implemented by packages such as mftrace and TeXtrace\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In 2001, he was named as centre half-forward and captain of North Melbourne's Team of the Century, and in 2008 was named as Australian football's greatest-ever player, as part of a list of the top 50 players of all time, published in the book \"The Australian Game of Football\", which was released by the League to celebrate 150 years of Australian rules football.\nIn 2002, he left North Melbourne in disgrace after it was revealed he had been having an extramarital affair with the wife of his then-teammate Anthony Stevens. He is also known for a string of legal problems, which include domestic violence charges and assault convictions.\nFrom 2014, Carey has worked as a Friday night football commentator and \"Talking Footy\" panelist with Channel Seven. He has also written as a columnist for \"The Age\" and is a regular fixture on Triple M's \"The Rush Hour\" segment called \"The Midweek Rub\", which has since been spun off as its own podcast. He had previously worked for 3AW and Channel 9 before being fired for a glassing incident in Miami. \nCarey worked at Channel 7, Triple M and The Age until 2022 when he was sacked from all three roles due to an alleged incident at the Perth Casino.\nCarey then started his own podcast in 2023 called \"The Truth Hurts\"; the original co-host was Ayrton Woolley in 2023 and then Tony Sheahan from 2024.\nIn late 2024, Carey joined the \u2018You Cannot Be Serious\u2019 podcast with Sam Newman.\nEarly life and education.\nWayne Francis Carey was born on born 27 May 1971, the son of Kevin and Lynne Carey. Carey was one of five children, and he spent his early years in Wagga Wagga, New South Wales. His mother and father separated when Carey was aged six, with his mother taking four of the children to Adelaide, living in a homeless shelter. According to Carey's autobiography, his father was a violent man who had spent time at Mannus Correctional Centre and was troubled by alcoholism. A few months later, Kevin Carey retrieved the children from his estranged wife, and they returned to Wagga Wagga.\nCarey played rugby league as a junior, and he began playing Australian rules football at the age of eight. At the age of thirteen, Carey returned to Adelaide, where he attended The Heights School and played junior football for North Adelaide.\nPlaying career: 1987\u20132004.\nAFL.\nVFL debut: 1987\u20131989.\nIn 1987, Carey was recruited by North Melbourne after their CEO, Greg Miller, met with the Sydney Swans' football department to discuss the transfer to North Melbourne of John Longmire, a highly regarded junior key-position player. Once that deal was concluded, Miller then inquired about Carey who, like Longmire, was zoned to the Swans due to having lived in New South Wales. He made a token offer of $10,000 as a transfer fee, to which the Swans surprisingly agreed. As a 16-year-old, Carey made the move to Melbourne and played for the North Melbourne under-19s, where he starred in their 1988 premiership side under coach Denis Pagan. Carey was promoted to the senior list prior to the 1989 season and, after recovering from dislocating his left shoulder in a practice match early in the year, made his first appearance for the seniors as an 18-year-old in round 11 of 1989 against Fitzroy.\nState of Origin.\nCarey had a relatively short but successful State of Origin career, and what he describes as a significant period in his career. Carey first played at the game's highest level in 1990 for New South Wales, in a famous win over Victoria, in the side's third-ever win against the state; Carey scored one goal. In 1992, playing for South Australia against Victoria, Carey played an outstanding game, dominating at centre half-forward and kicking two goals, including the match-winner from 55 metres out in the dying moments. Carey had four opponents in the game, dominating them all, including Chris Langford, Danny Frawley and Garry Lyon. Carey has described this game as the moment he knew he belonged at AFL level, as State of Origin at that time was considered to be the most challenging level of the game. Carey played for NSW/ACT the following year in the State of Origin Carnival, scoring one goal. In the latter half of the 1990s, clubs began putting pressure on players to pull out of State of Origin games due to fear of injury, and players began to stop participating, with the final non-charity State of Origin game occurring in 1999.\n1989\u20132001\nThe 1990s was a decade dominated by forwards, and Wayne Carey dominated his role at centre half-forward more than perhaps any other player in his position before or since.\n\"Carey had established a reputation as one of perhaps the dozen greatest players of all time,\" according to writer John Devaney of australianfootball.com.\"It was clear right from the outset that the Kangaroos had managed to get their hands on someone special. Powerfully built even then, Carey could mark strongly even under the most extreme pressure, and his kicking either to position or at goal was impeccable. He was also surprisingly quick, both over the ground, and in terms of his decision making and use of the ball. Carey won the first of his four North Melbourne best and fairest awards in 1992, and the following year was appointed captain.\n\"North's emergence as one of the power clubs of the AFL during the mid- to late 1990s was attributable in no small measure to Carey's presence and contribution. It is arguable that no footballer in history has ever been capable of winning a game entirely off his own boot, but Carey at his peak perhaps came as close as anyone. On a purely objective measure, he was probably worth at least three players\u2014which, coincidentally, is sometimes the number of opponents he had to contend with. Named an AFL All-Australian in 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1998, 1999 and 2000, Carey was selected as captain of the side on four occasions. In both 1996 and 1999 he was a pivotal member of his club's two most recent premiership sides.\"\n\u2014John Devaney\nExtramarital affair and leaving North Melbourne for Adelaide: 2002\u20132004.\nIn March 2002, Carey had an extramarital affair with the wife of North Melbourne stalwart and Vice Captain Anthony Stevens, Kelli. Making the situation even messier was the fact that Carey was himself married to his long-term partner, Sally McMahon. Carey and Stevens were attending a party at teammate Glenn Archer's house. Carey is quoted as saying Kelli followed him into the toilets in front of a large crowd, including her husband. An argument ensued between Carey and Stevens, and both players subsequently failed to attend football training. In the face of his team being united against him, as well as nationwide condemnation, Carey resigned in disgrace from North Melbourne. Carey's then manager Ricky Nixon, infamously stated that his client was on \"suicide watch\" during the aftermath. To avoid media attention, Carey fled to Las Vegas. Stevens had been groomsman to Carey at his wedding to Sally.\nNorth Melbourne Legend Brent Harvey said it set the club back \"four or five years\". The aftermath of the affair resulted in Carey missing the 2002 AFL season and transferring to the Adelaide Crows for the 2003 AFL season; he would play two seasons with the Crows, including kicking 56 goals, retiring at the end of the 2004 AFL season. The first game played between North Melbourne and Adelaide in 2003 made for gripping viewing, with Archer and Stevens both taunting and making aggressive moves towards Carey. Although tension was at fever pitch, all players involved managed to restrain themselves from doing anything overly rash. Adelaide went on to win convincingly by 54 points. In a twist of fate, Stevens took over Carey's role of captain in 2002.\nIn February 2022, 20 years after the initial fallout from the affair, Carey labelled his affair with Stevens \"the biggest regret of my life as an adult\" while participating on season three of the reality TV show \"\". Despite withdrawing from the show, Carey was reportedly paid A$250,000 for the appearance.\nIn August 2022, Carey and Stevens met again at a function to celebrate the 26th anniversary of their 1996 premiership (which was initially supposed to be a 25th anniversary but was delayed by a year due to COVID-19); Carey engaged Stevens in a \"verbal stoush\" at the function, although the situation was reportedly de-escalated. The \"Herald Sun\" reported there was no potential of violence and that the pair \"moved on and shared a beer together\" afterwards.\nDespite both players' marriages being rocked by the public scandal, it took each marriage several years to dissolve. Carey's marriage ended in 2006, four years after the incident, while Kelli and Anthony Stevens divorced in 2008, six years after the affair.\nAustralian Football Hall of Fame.\nCarey was inducted into the AFL Hall of Fame in 2010. Although he was eligible for induction in 2008, his off-field troubles with drugs and violence delayed his induction.\nAlleged creative salary cap.\nDue to restrictions in the salary cap, North Melbourne was capped at $300,000 per year for Carey for the 2000 AFL season. However, the North Melbourne staff knew that Carey was far more valuable to the team than this, so Carey's manager Ricky Nixon came up with a creative salary cap move to secure Carey an additional $400,000 in salary.\nNixon said, \"So I requested Wayne's intellectual property, and it was owned by Wayne Carey Pty Ltd, and he licensed it to me for $2 so I could sell it to North Melbourne for marketing rights of $700,000,\" Nixon said on the \"Real Footy\" podcast. \"He was getting paid $300,000 from North Melbourne and $700,000 went to me, and I gave Wayne $400,000. People said it was cheating, but it was absolutely within the rules.\"\nAccording to Nixon, when the AFL complained about this manoeuvre, he simply told them: \"I run the competition, not you.\"\nLegacy.\nCarey has been named by many media commentators as the greatest footballer to play the game. In 1999, Leigh Matthews, who was voted the greatest player of the 20th century, honoured Carey by saying that he was the best player he had ever seen. In 2008, Carey was named as Australian Football's greatest-ever player as part of a list of the top 50 players of all time, published in the book \"The Australian Game of Football\", and he placed third in a similar list put together by a panel of football legends in \"The Age\" newspaper the same year. In 2011, the \"Herald Sun\" polled 21 past and present AFL greats, including Carey, to find the players' opinion as to the greatest player of the AFL era. Carey topped the list, polling 85 of a possible 100 votes, 26 votes ahead of second-placed Gary Ablett Sr.\nThe love triangle involving Carey, Anthony Stevens, and Stevens's then-wife Kelli has inspired creative works across Australian television and music, including the song \"Sure Got Me\" on Paul Kelly's 2004 double album \"Ways &amp; Means\". Hunters &amp; Collectors frontman Mark Seymour also wrote a song inspired by the affair, but he declined to release it after learning of Kelli's take on the events. Jock Cheese, bassist of the satirical Melbourne band TISM, released a tribute to Carey titled \"Why Don't You Get A Bigger Set of Tits?\" on his 2002 solo album \"Platter\". In a performance inspired by the Carey-Stevens scandal, Warwick Capper played an AFL footballer named \"Dwayne Carey\" in season 3 of the SBS comedy series \"Pizza\".\nStatistics.\nAs of 2023, Carey's career total of 727 goals ranks him equal 20th in VFL/AFL history, and his 671 goals for North Melbourne is the club record.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"alternating rows table/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPost-playing career.\nIn early 2005, Carey agreed to assist former coach and mentor Denis Pagan at the Carlton Football Club, acting voluntarily as a part-time skills coach. In 2006 he was an assistant coach at Collingwood Football Club. Carey also worked as a commentator and host of shows on the Fox Footy Channel throughout the 2006 season. In 2007 he participated in the Nine Network football analysis program \"Footy Classified\", as well as special comments for radio station 3AW's football coverage. Subsequent to his dual arrests for domestic violence and assault he was sacked from both positions.\nIn 2009, Carey was approached in a confidential meeting with influential North Melbourne board member Ron Joseph to return to the club as coach in a succession plan which also involved Malcolm Blight. Carey confirmed this when queried by noted football journalist Damian Barrett in May 2021.\nControversies.\nCarey has had a string of scandals besides the aforementioned extramarital affair with Anthony Stevens' wife.\nIn 1997, Carey pleaded guilty to indecent assault after grabbing a passing woman's breast on a Melbourne city street after 12 hours of drinking with teammates. He allegedly told her, \"Why don't you get a bigger pair of tits\". Carey later settled out of court when the woman filed a civil suit against him.\nIn 2000, Carey provided character evidence for Jason Moran, an infamous gangster who was subsequently murdered in Melbourne's gang war.\nIn 2004, while holidaying with his then wife, Carey was subject to arrest for a misdemeanour battery report while holidaying in Las Vegas. He was placed in custody for one night then released. The local District Attorney elected not to pursue the case.\nCarey again became the subject of public comment in February 2006 when he announced he was leaving his pregnant wife Sally for model Kate Neilson. His daughter Ella was born six weeks later. In December 2006, Neilson allegedly reported Carey to Australian police for domestic violence, alleging he had punched her in the face. Neilson and Carey denied this report. Subsequently, US security guard Kyle Banks told the Nine Network's \"A Current Affair\" he saw Carey attacking Neilson while working at the exclusive W Hotel in New York City in October 2006. Banks said he saw Carey break a bottle of French champagne over his own head.\nOn 27 January 2008, Carey was arrested after reports of a disturbance at his Port Melbourne apartment. Police had to subdue Carey with capsicum spray and he was seen handcuffed after allegedly assaulting the officers.\nTwo days later, the Nine Network announced it would not renew Carey's television contract after it was revealed that Carey had been arrested and charged with assaulting a police officer and Neilson in Miami, Florida, on 27 October 2007, after he allegedly glassed Neilsen in the face and neck with a wine glass. Police Lieutenant Bill Schwartz, however, reported:\nWhen officers went and spoke to him, he immediately was belligerent, starting striking out at the officers, in fact, kicked one of the female officers in the face with his foot, elbowed another one in the side of the face. They had to wrestle him down and handcuff him. When he was in the police car, he used his head as a battering ram and tried to smash a hole between the front compartment of the police car and the prisoner compartment.\nTo stop Carey harming himself and damaging the car, the officers put him into a leather hobble restraint around his hands and legs. Carey faced up to fifteen years in jail and US$30,000 fines. Additionally, Carey was fired from commentary jobs at 3AW and the Nine Network following the coverage of the two arrests. Ultimately Carey pleaded guilty to assaulting and resisting Miami police. In exchange for his guilty pleas, prosecutors agreed that Carey should only serve 50 hours of community service, attend alcohol- and anger-management classes, serve two years probation, and pay US$500 to a Miami police charity. As a consequence of his criminal record in the United States, Carey was refused an entry visa in October 2009.\nIn March 2008, Carey publicly revealed he was, for a long period, an abuser of alcohol and cocaine. He was interviewed by Andrew Denton on \"Enough Rope\", where he talked candidly about his life and recent controversies. 1.5\u00a0million viewers tuned into the highly publicised interview.\nCarey was attempting to visit Barwon Prison in February 2012 to speak to indigenous inmates as part of a mentoring program; however, he was found to have traces of cocaine on his clothing following a routine drug scan. Carey was informed that he could enter the prison if he submitted to a strip search. He declined and left the correctional facility.\nOn 1 September 2022, according to numerous sources, including \"The Herald Sun\" and \"The Age\", Carey was gambling when a Ziploc bag of white powder fell onto a gaming table. Carey denied the substance was illegal, claiming it was a \"crushed-up anti-inflammatory\". Carey was issued with a \"withdrawal of license\" notice, which means he cannot attend Crown properties for two years. It saw him ejected from the Crown hotel, where he was staying for the Fremantle\u2013Bulldogs elimination final. This also means that he was unable to attend the 2022 Brownlow Medal count that was held at Crown Palladium in Melbourne.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the principal navigable waterway between London and the Midlands. Starting in London, one arm runs to Leicester and another to Birmingham. The Birmingham canal is with 166 locks. The Birmingham line has a number of short branches to places including Slough, Aylesbury, Wendover, and Northampton. The Leicester line has two short arms of its own, to Market Harborough and Welford.\nIt has links with other canals and navigable waterways, including the River Thames, the Regent's Canal, the River Nene and River Soar, the Oxford Canal, the Stratford-upon-Avon Canal, the Digbeth Branch Canal and the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal.\nThe canal south of Braunston to the River Thames at Brentford in London is the original Grand Junction Canal. At Braunston the latter met the Oxford Canal linking back to the Thames to the south and to Coventry to the north via the Coventry Canal. \"Grand Union Canal\" is also the original name for what is now the Leicester line of the modern Grand Union, running from short east of Braunston to Leicester, and which is now sometimes referred to as the Old Grand Union Canal to avoid ambiguity.\nHistory.\nThe Grand Union Canal in its current form came into being on 1 January 1929. The Regent's Canal and the Grand Junction Canal agreed that amalgamation and modernisation were the only way to remain competitive against rail and newly developing road transport, and the merger was authorised by the &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Regent's Canal and Dock Company (Grand Junction Canal Purchase) Act 1928 (18 &amp; 19 Geo. 5. c. xcviii).\nA five-mile (eight-km) section of the Oxford Canal forms the main line of the Grand Union between Braunston and Napton-on-the-Hill. Although the Grand Union intended to buy the Oxford Canal and Coventry Canal, these purchases did not take place.\nThe section of the main line between Brentford and Braunston (formerly the Grand Junction Canal) was built as a 'wide' or 'broad' canal \u2013 that is, its locks were wide enough to accommodate two narrowboats abreast (side by side) or a single wide barge up to in beam.\nThe onward sections from Braunston to Birmingham had been built as 'narrow' canals, that is, the locks could accommodate only a single narrowboat. The &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Grand Union Canal Act 1931 (21 &amp; 22 Geo. 5. c. xc) was passed authorising a key part of the modernisation scheme of the Grand Union, supported by government grants. The narrow locks (and several bridges) between Napton and Camp Hill Top Lock in Birmingham were rebuilt to take widebeam boats or barges up to in beam, or two narrowboats. The canal was dredged and bank improvements carried out: the depth was increased to to allow heavier cargoes, and the minimum width increased to to enable two boats of 12 feet 6\u00a0inches to pass. Lock works were completed in 1934 when the Duke of Kent opened the new broad locks at Hatton, and other improvements finished by 1937.\nThese improvements to depth and width were never carried out between Braunston and London. Camp Hill Locks in Birmingham were not widened, as it would have been very expensive and of little point, since they lead only to further flights of locks not in the ownership of the Grand Union. A new basin and warehouse were constructed at Tyseley, above Camp Hill, to deal with this. Although the Grand Union company had a number of broad boats built to take advantage of the improvements, they never really caught on and the canal continued to be operated largely by pairs of narrowboats, whose journeys were facilitated by the newly widened locks in which they could breast up.\nThe three sections between Norton junction and the River Trent (collectively known as the 'Leicester line') are mixed in size. From Norton to Foxton, the route is a narrow canal. From below Foxton to Leicester it is a wide canal. From Leicester to the Trent, the route is effectively the River Soar and the locks and bridges are wide. The &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Grand Union Canal (Leicester Canals Purchase, &amp;c.) Act 1931 (21 &amp; 22 Geo. 5. c. cvii) authorised the widening of the locks at Watford Locks and Foxton Locks, but with government grants for this section not forthcoming, the work was not carried out.\nThe Grand Union Canal was nationalised in 1948, control transferring to the British Transport Commission, and in 1962 to the British Waterways Board, later British Waterways. Commercial traffic continued to decline, effectively ceasing in the 1970s, though lime juice was carried from Brentford to Boxmoor until 1981, and aggregates on the River Soar until 1995. However, leisure traffic took over, and the canal is now as busy as it ever was, with leisure boating complemented by fishing, towpath walking and gongoozling. More recently freight traffic returned with the carriage of aggregates from Denham to West Drayton in barges and narrowboats, and the opening of a new wharf for re-cyclables and aggregates at Old Oak Common.\nBrentford to Braunston.\nOne end of the Grand Union Canal (Grand Junction Canal \u2013 Main Line) is at Brentford on the River Thames in west London, where the canal follows the engineered course of the Brent. The double Thames Lock at Brentford separates the Tideway administered by the Port of London Authority from the River Brent/Grand Union Canal, administered by the Canal &amp; River Trust. The locks on the canal are partially numbered: numbered consecutively south of its turn-off for Leicester, Braunston Junction. Thames Lock is lock number 101.\nFor more than upstream of Thames Lock, the canal and the Brent are one and the same, and the waterway is semi-tidal until the double Gauging Lock (lock 100) at Brentford. Just upstream of the Gauging Lock was a large canal basin, now known as Brentford Lock, from which the canal covers more distance passing under Cornelius Bridge, Brentford Railway Bridge, and the Great West Road bridge and through two more locks. The river and canal part at the base of the Hanwell flight of locks (92\u201397), after which it traverses Three Bridges, London, Isambard Brunel's final project. Two more locks take the canal to Norwood Green. It then heads westward over level ground through Southall, Hayes and Yiewsley until it reaches the gentle valley of the Colne.\nThree miles (5\u00a0km) from Norwood on this long level is Bulls Bridge Junction, once the site of the Grand Union Canal Carrying Company's main dockyard. At Bulls Bridge, the Paddington Arm branches off to the north and runs to join the Regents Canal at Little Venice (see below). Just before Uxbridge is Cowley Peachey Junction, where the Slough Arm branches off westward.\nAt suburban Cowley, before the 1930s a rural village, the canal begins to climb the valley of the River Colne north north-west into the adjoining town of Uxbridge. After Denham and Harefield villages, it passes to the south of Rickmansworth. Here it merges with the Rivers Chess, Colne and Gade. After Rickmansworth, the canal follows the valley of the Gade, passing the site of Croxley paper mill. The canal skirts Watford through Cassiobury Park, passing under the M25 motorway as it approaches Kings Langley.\nLocks become more frequent as the climb into the Chiltern Hills steepens. The original four locks here were replaced in 1819 by five shallower ones to alleviate problems with water supply to the nearby paper mills. This realigned the canal to the south of its former course; the locks here are still referred to \u2013 without irony \u2013 as \"The New 'Uns\" by traditional boaters, and the term has been passed on to a new generation of canal users.\nAfter Kings Langley and Apsley \u2013 the site of more former paper mills \u2013 the canal passes the town Hemel Hempstead and Boxmoor Common. From here the canal follows the course of the River Bulbourne through Bourne End with the well-known swingbridge at Winkwell, and the \"Port of Berkhamsted, a small compact town\". At Cow Roast Lock the canal reaches the 3-mile (5-km) summit at Tring in the Chiltern hills, having risen through 54 locks since Brentford.\nAt the north-west end of the summit level is Bulbourne Works, where lock gates were manufactured until 2003 for the southern canal network. Half a mile (800 m) further on, the canal reaches the top of the Marsworth flight of seven locks, which begin the descent to the Vale of Aylesbury. A Wendover Arm branches off westwards from the summit level under a bridge adjacent to Marsworth Top Lock and is currently navigable for just over a mile to moorings and a winding hole; it has restoration project to extend it back to Wendover. This part of the canal in parlance used by natives and canal staff was \"the withered arm\" and in fact was only really \"opened\" to allow the pumping station there to pump water into the uppermost level. A few hundred metres beyond the bottom lock of the flight, the Aylesbury Arm branches off to the south west.\nThe Grand Union descends gradually by interspersed locks, past the villages of Cheddington, Horton and Slapton until it reaches Leighton Buzzard. Traditionally this section of the canal is called \"Slapton Fields\" or just \"The Fields\" by boaters. A few miles further on, a flight of three locks near Soulbury marks the descent towards the valley of the River Great Ouse.\nA few miles further on it enters Milton Keynes at the outskirts of Bletchley at Fenny Stratford Lock, which is unusual in lowering the level by only . The next stretch of is on the level. There is a modern proposal to dig a new arm from here to the Great Ouse navigation at Bedford. North of the centre, it traverses the modern New Bradwell Aqueduct, the first on the Grand Union in over 100 years. Leaving Milton Keynes at Wolverton, the canal runs on a high embankment before passing over the Great Ouse at Cosgrove aqueduct (the \"Iron Trunk aqueduct\"), the first cast-iron \"trough\" aqueduct in England.\nAfter rising through Cosgrove Lock, (and passing the start of the abandoned Buckingham Arm) another long level section brings the canal to the bottom of the Stoke Bruerne flight of seven locks. At the top of this flight is the Stoke Bruerne Canal Museum followed shortly by Blisworth Tunnel, at one of the longest of UK canals.\nOnce clear of the tunnel, the canal passes Blisworth village and reaches Gayton Junction where the Northampton Arm branches off to the east. This arm has 17 narrow locks as it descends to join the navigable River Nene (see below). The long level stretch continues past several villages including Nether Heyford and Weedon Bec and is very rural in character.\nAt Whilton, the canal reaches the bottom of the Buckby flight of seven locks which raise it to Braunston summit the village of which parish is away. Beyond the top lock is Norton Junction where the Leicester line (not strictly a branch) heads off north. A few miles further on the canal passes through the 2040-yard (1865-m) Braunston Tunnel, which pierces a low range of hills that are part of the Northamptonshire uplands.\nThe canal then drops down the Braunston flight of six locks until it reaches Braunston Junction having covered just over .\nThe Birmingham \"main line\".\nAt Braunston Junction, the Oxford Canal diverges north and south. The north section leads to Rugby and Coventry; the southward fork carries both the Oxford Canal and the Grand Union for to Napton Junction. Here, the Grand Union heads north towards Birmingham, while the Oxford Canal veers south towards Banbury and Oxford.\nShortly after Napton Junction, the Grand Union reaches three locks at Calcutt, which begin the descent to the Warwickshire River Avon. After a 3-mile (5-km) level, the canal descends into the valley of the River Leam by the Stockton flight of 10 locks (often known as 'the Itchington Ten'). Above the eighth lock down the flight, a short arm (now used as pleasure craft moorings) used to serve Southam cement works. This was where the last regular cargo of cement was loaded heading for Birmingham in the late 1960s.\nFrom the bottom of the locks, a 3-mile (5-km) level leads to the four Bascote Locks. The top two form a 'riser' or staircase. Six more interspersed locks lead to Radford, after which a 5-mile (8-km) level takes the canal through Leamington Spa to Warwick. Between these two towns, the canal crosses the River Avon and the former Great Western Railway on aqueducts.\nAt Warwick, the canal rises by two locks to Budbrooke Junction (formerly the junction with the then-independent Warwick and Birmingham Canal). To the left is the restored Saltisford Canal Arm, a short stretch that used to run under the railway to the original canal basin complex and terminus of the Warwick and Birmingham Canal \u2013 the basin was filled-in in the 1970s. The canal used to serve one of the oldest gasworks. Two hexagonal buildings that housed the gas holders are part of the world's oldest remaining gasworks buildings. After half a mile the mainline reaches the bottom of the Hatton flight of 21 locks that lift the canal up out of the Avon Valley. The first 10 locks are spaced out but from the middle lock the flight is tightly spaced.\nThree miles (5\u00a0km) from Hatton Top Lock the canal passes through Shrewley Tunnel, with its separate horse tunnel, and then passes Rowington village to Kingswood Junction where a short spur connects with the Stratford-upon-Avon Canal. Another lead to the Knowle flight of five locks. Finally, an 11-mile (18-km) level takes the canal through Elmdon Heath, Solihull, Acocks Green and Tyseley to the heart of Birmingham.\nThe main line may be considered to terminate at Bordesley Junction. From here, there are two routes, both part of the Grand Union Canal. The original line of the Warwick and Birmingham Canal leads to the Digbeth Branch Canal of the Birmingham Canal Navigations at the Warwick Bar, while the later line of the Birmingham and Warwick Junction Canal leads to the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal (and Tame Valley Canal) at Salford Junction, which in turn has connections to the Coventry Canal and the Trent and Mersey Canal.\nThe Leicester line.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Routemap/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFormed by amalgamations of once-independent canals, the 'Leicester Line' of the Grand Union Canal runs north from Norton Junction for about until it reaches Leicester, where it joins the River Soar to provide a link to the River Trent and to the Trent and Mersey Canal. It includes tunnels south of Crick and north of Husbands Bosworth The village of Crick is home to a popular annual boat show.\nThe stretch of the canal that passes through the centre of Leicester is known as the 'Mile Straight' and is home to Leicester Rowing Club, a rowing and sculling club. The club hosts regattas on a stretch co-running with the Soar, typically held in mid-April by over 100 crews over a course.\nAlso on this section are the Foxton Locks and Watford Locks, both staircase locks. Beside Foxton locks is the site of a long-abandoned inclined plane boat lift. This was constructed as part of a project to create a wide-beam canal route to connect the northern and southern parts of the canal system, something which does not exist to this day. Funding to deal with the narrow locks at Watford was not forthcoming and the scheme was aborted. The canal north of Foxton Junction is wide-beam to Leicester and onwards. It was originally intended to build a canal at this width all the way to the River Nene at Northampton. However, that canal never went further than the basin at Market Harborough.\nThe Leicester Line continues along the River Soar Navigation, and reaches the River Trent at Soar Mouth, north of Ratcliffe-on-Soar. It is possible to continue to the Trent and Mersey Canal, Coventry Canal and North Oxford Canal, to complete a circuit known as the Leicester Ring.\nArms.\nThe Grand Union Canal has six main branches, usually termed 'arms'. \nFive miles (eight\u00a0km) from Brentford, the Paddington Arm runs circuitously on the flat to a junction with the Regent's Canal, the latter running north and east of Central London. The triangular canal basin formed by the junction is called the Little Venice in Maida Vale. The Arm's final 500\u00a0m runs south-east to Paddington Basin. \nFrom Cowley Peachey, the Slough Arm runs to the west. \nFrom Marsworth, about by canal from Brentford, two arms diverge: one to Wendover (currently in-part navigable as being restored by the Wendover Arm Trust;) the other descends through 16 narrow locks for to Aylesbury. \nFrom Gayton Junction, about from Brentford, the Northampton Arm links with the River Nene.\nAt Warwick the northernmost branch off of the Grand Union Canal (also known by regular users as the \"GU\"), the Saltisford Canal Arm begins. The restored arm is close to the centre of Warwick. It was originally the main line of the Warwick and Birmingham Canal, 1799, leading to the terminus and a basin with wharfs for timber. When the Warwick and Napton Canal opened, this bypassed channel remained as the town's wharf. The Saltisford Canal Trust have restored most of the surviving canal, 1990\u20132015, such as installing long lengths of sheet piling and restoring a warehouse in 2007. Its last were lost in the 1970s saving a disused road bridge that stands isolated in a car park. Warwick's narrowboat moorings are on the Arm by a public park partly in view of the Castle. Over 800 visiting narrowboats cruise to Warwick each year and moor on the arm.\nThe Leicester Line has two modest arms of its own, see Grand Union Canal (old).\nCurrent developments.\nBedford &amp; Milton Keynes Waterway.\nThe Bedford and Milton Keynes Waterway Consortium plans to build a canal connecting the Grand Union at Milton Keynes to the River Great Ouse at Bedford at an estimated cost of \u00a3150\u00a0million. The project is supported by British Waterways (and its successor, the Canal &amp; River Trust), the Bedford &amp; Milton Keynes Waterway Trust, other waterways campaign groups, and also local councils. The first element of the canal is an underpass under the A421, completed in 2009 and efforts are continuing to obtain funding to complete the scheme in 'bite-size chunks'. The new waterway would create a new cruising ring connecting through from the Grand Union to the waterways of East Anglia which are beneficial to leisure cruising as tourists are able to follow circular routes, as well as completing a missing link between the north and south of the UK for wide-beam boats - all current inland waterways have restrictive pinch points around the Midlands, only suited to narrowboats, effectively dividing wide-beam cruising grounds into two disconnected halves.\nThe history of the proposal is considerably older; the route was first discussed in 1810, when its promoters included Samuel Whitbread.\nFrom Milton Keynes, the canal is planned to pass beneath the M1 using an existing cattle creep, then cross over Brogborough Hill, and across the Marston Vale through to the River Great Ouse in Kempston.\nBuckingham Arm restoration.\nThe Buckingham Arm once ran from Cosgrove, Northamptonshire to Buckingham. It was built as an arm of the Grand Junction Canal, in two separate phases, opening in 1800 and 1801. It was disused from 1932, but was not finally abandoned until 1964. It is now the subject of a restoration project.\nSlough-Eton canal.\nThe predecessor to the Canal and River Trust, British Waterways, received mild financial support indications from the two local authorities covering Slough and Eton, Berkshire to extend the Slough Arm to join the Thames, via any course i.e. covering a minimum ; the 2008-estimated cost was \u00a330\u00a0million. The trust confirmed in 2012 this remains a long-term objective, to be actioned when the economic conditions allow.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences and notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is responsible for the administration of federal laws governing occupational safety and health, wage and hour standards, unemployment benefits, reemployment services, and occasionally, economic statistics. It is headed by the secretary of labor, who reports directly to the president of the United States and is a member of the president's Cabinet.\nThe purpose of the Department of Labor is to foster, promote, and develop the well-being of the wage earners, job seekers, and retirees of the United States; improve working conditions; advance opportunities for profitable employment; and assure work-related benefits and rights. In carrying out this mission, the Department of Labor administers and enforces more than 180 federal laws and thousands of federal regulations. These mandates and the regulations that implement them cover many workplace activities for about 10\u00a0million employers and 125\u00a0million workers. The current secretary of labor is Lori Chavez-DeRemer, who was sworn in on March 11, 2025.\nThe department's headquarters is housed in the Frances Perkins Building, named in honor of Frances Perkins, the secretary of labor from 1933 to 1945.\nHistory.\nIn 1884, the U.S.\u00a0Congress first established a Bureau of Labor Statistics with the Bureau of Labor Act, to collect information about labor and employment. This bureau was under the Department of the Interior. The bureau started collecting economic data in 1884, and published their first report in 1886. Later, in 1888, the Bureau of Labor became an independent Department of Labor, but lacked executive rank.\nIn February 1903, it became a bureau again when the Department of Commerce and Labor was established.\nUnited States president William Howard Taft signed the March 4, 1913, bill (the last day of his presidency), establishing the Department of Labor as its own Cabinet-level department. William B. Wilson was appointed as the first secretary of labor on March 5, 1913, by President Wilson. As part of this action, the United States Conciliation Service was created as an agency within the department; its purpose was to provide mediation for labor disputes. In October 1919, Secretary Wilson chaired the first meeting of the International Labour Organization even though the U.S. was not yet a member.\nIn September 1916, the Federal Employees' Compensation Act introduced benefits to workers who are injured or contract illnesses in the workplace. The act established an agency responsible for federal workers' compensation, which was transferred to the Labor Department in the 1940s and has become known as the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs.\nFrances Perkins, the first female cabinet member, was appointed to be Secretary of Labor by President Roosevelt on March 4, 1933. Perkins served for 12 years, and became the longest-serving secretary of labor.\nThe passage of the Taft\u2013Hartley Act in 1947 led to the end of the U.S. Conciliation Service, which was reconstituted outside the department as a new independent agency, the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service.\nDuring the John F. Kennedy Administration, planning was undertaken to consolidate most of the department's offices, then scattered around more than 20 locations. In the mid\u20111960s, construction on the \"New Labor Building\" began and construction was finished in 1975. In 1980, it was named in honor of Frances Perkins.\nPresident Lyndon B. Johnson asked Congress to consider the idea of reuniting Commerce and Labor. He argued that the two departments had similar goals and that they would have more efficient channels of communication in a single department. However, Congress never acted on it.\nIn the 1970s, following the civil rights movement, the Labor Department under Secretary George P. Shultz made a concerted effort to promote racial diversity in unions.\nIn 1978, the Department of Labor created the Philip Arnow Award, intended to recognize outstanding career employees such as the eponymous Philip Arnow. In the same year, Carin Clauss became the department's first female solicitor of the department.\nIn 2010, a local of the American Federation of Government Employees stated their unhappiness that a longstanding flextime program reduced under the George W. Bush administration had not been restored under the Obama administration. Department officials said the program was modern and fair and that it was part of ongoing contract negotiations with the local.\nIn August 2010, the Partnership for Public Service ranked the Department of Labor 23rd out of 31 large agencies in its annual \"Best Places to Work in the Federal Government\" list.\nIn December 2010, Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis was named the chair of the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, of which Labor has been a member since its beginnings in 1987.\nIn July 2011, Ray Jefferson, Assistant Secretary for VETS resigned due to his involvement in a contracting scandal.\nIn March 2013, the department began commemorating its centennial.\nIn July 2013, Tom Perez was confirmed as Secretary of Labor.

{"id": "44276", "revid": "47513202", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44276", "title": "Gun control", "text": "Laws or policies that regulate firearms\nGun control, or firearms regulation, is the set of laws or policies that regulate the manufacture, sale, transfer, possession, modification, or use of firearms and ammunition by civilians.\nMost countries allow civilians to own firearms, but have strong firearms laws to prevent misuse or violence. They typically restrict ownership of firearms with certain characteristics, and require a mandatory gun safety course and firearms license to own a gun.\nOnly a few countries, such as Iraq, Yemen, Pakistan and the United States are considered permissive jurisdictions.\nIn some countries, such as Australia or the United States, measures can be implemented at the national, state, or local levels. Countries like the United States and Mexico have constitutionally protected gun rights. \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTerminology and context.\nGun control refers to domestic and international attempts to regulate, and harmonize the regulation of, the private and industrial manufacture, trade, possession, use, and transport of a class of weapons typically identified as small arms. This class of arms commonly includes revolvers, self-loading pistols, rifles and carbines, assault rifles, and some categories of machine gun.\nIn the United States, the term \"gun control\" itself is considered polarizing and politicized. Many gun control advocates prefer the use of terms like \"gun-violence prevention\", \"gun safety\", or \"common-sense regulation\" to describe their objectives. Topics of gun control and gun rights is often considered with more prevalent of discussions in the United States then other countries, as it is more heavily debated there then anywhere else, However still quite prevalent in other countries such as Canada.\nRegulation of civilian firearms.\nWith few exceptions, most countries in the world allow some form of civilian firearm ownership. A 2011 survey of 28 countries over five continents found that a major distinction between different national gun control regimes is whether civilian gun ownership is seen as a right or a privilege.\nThe study concluded that both the United States and Yemen were distinct from the other countries surveyed in that they viewed gun ownership as a basic right of citizenship, and therefore their gun control policies are more permissive. In the remaining countries sampled, civilian gun ownership is considered a privilege and their corresponding gun control policies are more restrictive.For many countries who don't have gun ownership as a right but as a privilege, Gun rights, such as the extent in the United States, might often be seen as too permissive.\nSome countries like in East Asia can be particularly strict. East Asian countries are usually more indifferent to gun control and gun rights debate. Countries like Japan and China enact strict controls on gun ownership. Others East Asian countries or South East Asian countries can be especially strict, a few with more extreme punishments then typically by most countries for the same crime. Indonesian Illegal gun ownership can be punished from a maximum of 20 years in prison to life in prison or the death penalty.\nFor almost all Europe, most countries gun ownership extends to hunting and sport, and require licensure with backgrounds checks.\nInternational and regional gun control.\nAt the international and regional level, diplomatic attention has tended to focus on the cross-border illegal trade in small arms as an area of particular concern rather than the regulation of civilian-held firearms. During the mid-1990s, however, the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) adopted a series of resolutions relating to the civilian ownership of small arms. These called for an exchange of data on national systems of firearm regulation and for the initiation of an international study of the issue. In July 1997, ECOSOC issued a resolution that underlined the responsibility of UN member states to competently regulate civilian ownership of small arms and which urged them to ensure that their regulatory frameworks encompassed the following aspects: firearm safety and storage; penalties for the unlawful possession and misuse of firearms; a licensing system to prevent undesirable persons from owning firearms; exemption from criminal liability to promote the surrender by citizens of illegal, unsafe or unwanted guns; and, a record-keeping system to track civilian firearms.\nIn 1997, the UN published a study based on member state survey data titled the \"United Nations International Study on Firearm Regulation\" which was updated in 1999. This study was meant to initiate the establishment of a database on civilian firearm regulations which would be run by the Centre for International Crime Prevention, located in Vienna, who were to report on national systems of civilian firearm regulation every two years. These plans never reached fruition and further UN-led efforts to establish international norms for the regulation of civilian-held firearms were stymied. Responding to pressure from the U.S. government, any mention of the regulation of civilian ownership of small arms was removed from the draft proposals for the 2001 UN Programme of Action on Small Arms.\nAlthough the issue is no longer part of the UN policy debate, since 1991 there have been eight regional agreements involving 110 countries concerning aspects of civilian firearm possession. The Bamako Declaration, was adopted in Bamako, Mali, on 1 December 2000 by the representatives of the member states of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU). The provisions of this declaration recommend that the signatories would establish the illegal possession of small arms and light weapons as a criminal offence under national law in their respective countries. UN conducted another study in 2011 and found after identifying a number of methodological problems in studies, it stated \"not withstanding such challenges, a significant body of literature tends to suggest that firearm availability predominantly represents a risk factor rather than a protective factor for homicide. In particular, a number of quantitative studies tend towards demonstrating a firearm prevalence\u2013homicide association.\"\nHistorical context.\nCountries always had some form of concern for armed civilians in history. In more recent years, calls for gun control grew as school shootings risen. High rates of gun mortality and injury are often cited as a primary impetus for gun control policies.\nIn 2007, a global supply of 875\u00a0million small arms were estimated to be in the hands of civilians, law enforcement agencies, and national armed forces. Of these firearms, 650\u00a0million, or 75%, were estimated to be held by civilians. U.S. civilians account for 270\u00a0million of this total. A further 200\u00a0million are controlled by national military forces. Law enforcement agencies may have some 26\u00a0million small arms. Non-state armed groups have about 1.4\u00a0million firearms. Finally, gang members hold between 2 and 10\u00a0million small arms. Together, the small arms arsenals of non-state armed groups and gangs have been estimated to account for, at most, 1.4% of the global total.\nUnited States.\nThe United States has more guns per citizen than any other western country. In the United States, gun rights activists argue gun laws are too restrictive or should not be altered, and gun control activists argue gun laws are too permissive. Both camps center their arguments upon the legal and traditional interpretations of the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Gun control measures include the Federal Assault Weapons Ban of 1994 that prohibited manufacturing certain semi-automatic firearms that were defined as assault weapons for civilian use. The act expired ten years after its effective date, and thus the act expired in 2004. Attempted measures included the Assault Weapons Ban of 2013 bill, which was not passed into law.\nCanada.\nIn Canada, The \"Canadian Criminal Code\", enacted in 1892, required individuals to have a permit to carry a pistol unless the owner had cause to fear assault or injury. Handgun registration became law in 1934, and automatic firearms registration was added in 1951, then the Criminal Law Amendment Act, Then In 1977, Bill C-51 required firearms acquisition certificates (FACs) to purchase any firearm.\nOn May 1, 2020, after deadly shootings in Nova Scotia, Justin Trudeau's Liberal government banned 1,500 kinds of military-style semi-automatic rifles, including the popular AR-15 and its variants. The ban was enacted via an Order In Council.\nThen on October 21, 2022, under Justin Trudeau's government, Bill C-21 came into effect, aiming to address gun violence and strengthen gun control. The legislation introduced a national freeze on the sale, purchase, or transfer of handguns by individuals within Canada. It also established new \"red flag\" and \"yellow flag\" laws, allowing courts and Chief Firearms Officers (CFOs) to issue emergency weapons prohibition orders and temporarily suspend licenses, respectively. Moreover, the bill increased maximum penalties for firearms-related offenses, including gun smuggling and gun trafficking, from 10 to 14 years imprisonment. Additionally, Bill C-21 prohibited mid-velocity 'replica' airguns that closely resemble real firearms and discharge projectiles at a velocity between 366 and 500 feet per second.\nAustralia.\nIn Australia, gun control laws were enacted in the Australian state of Victoria in 1988 with the Opinel shooting lead to a big change in gun ownership legislation and 1996 following the Port Arthur massacre. The Port Arthur massacre led to the National Firearms Agreement (NFA), 12 days after the killing. John Howard, the Prime minister at the time, proposing it said \"We need to achieve a total prohibition on the ownership, possession, sale and importation of all automatic and semi-automatic weapons. That will be the essence of the proposal... \". The National Firearms Agreement was agreed on and formed on the 10th of May 1996.\nStudies for legislature effectiveness.\nA 1998 review found that suicide rates generally declined after gun control laws were enacted, and concluded, \"The findings support gun control measures as a strategy for reducing suicide rates.\" A 2016 review found that laws banning people under restraining orders due to domestic violence convictions from accessing guns were associated with \"reductions in intimate partner homicide\". Another 2016 review identified 130 studies regarding restrictive gun laws and found that the implementation of multiple such laws simultaneously was associated with a decrease in gun-related deaths. According to \"Vox\", \"The authors are careful to note that their findings do not conclusively prove that gun restrictions reduce gun deaths. However, they did find a compelling trend whereby new restrictions on gun purchasing and ownership tended to be followed by a decline in gun deaths.\"\nAccording to a 2011 UN study, after identifying a number of methodological problems, it stated \"not withstanding such challenges, a significant body of literature tends to suggest that firearm availability predominantly represents a risk factor rather than a protective factor for homicide. In particular, a number of quantitative studies tend towards demonstrating a firearm prevalence\u2013homicide association.\"\nUnited States.\nA National Research Council critical review in 2004 found that while some strong conclusions are warranted from current research, the state of our knowledge is generally poor. The result of the scarcity of relevant data is that gun control is one of the most fraught topics in American politics, and scholars remain deadlocked on a variety of issues. Notably, since 1996, when the Dickey Amendment was first inserted into the federal spending bill, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been prohibited from using its federal funding \"to advocate or promote gun control\", thwarting gun violence research at the agency at the time. The funding provision's author has said that this was an over-interpretation, but the amendment still had an effect effectively halting federally funded firearm-related research. Since the amendment, the CDC has continued to research gun violence and publish studies about it, although their funding for such research has fallen by 96% since 1996, according to Mayors Against Illegal Guns. According to a spokesman, the CDC has limited funding and has not produced any comprehensive study aimed at reducing gun violence since 2001.\nIn 2007, a global supply of 875\u00a0million small arms were estimated to be in the hands of civilians, law enforcement agencies, and national armed forces. Of these firearms, 650\u00a0million, or 75%, were estimated to be held by civilians. U.S. civilians account for 270\u00a0million of this total. A further 200\u00a0million are controlled by national military forces. Law enforcement agencies may have some 26\u00a0million small arms. Non-state armed groups have about 1.4\u00a0million firearms. Finally, gang members hold between 2 and 10\u00a0million small arms. Together, the small arms arsenals of non-state armed groups and gangs have been estimated to account for, at most, 1.4% of the global total.\nIn 1988 and 1996, gun control laws were enacted in the Australian state of Victoria, both times following mass shootings. A 2004 study found that in the context of these laws, overall firearm-related deaths, especially suicides, declined dramatically. A 1995 study found preliminary evidence that gun control legislation enacted in Queensland, Australia, reduced suicide rates there.\nCross-sectional studies.\nIn 1983, a cross-sectional study of all 50 U.S. states found that the six states with the strictest gun laws (according to the National Rifle Association of America) had suicide rates that were lower than in other states by approximately 3 in 100,000 people, and that these states' suicide rates were lower than those of states with the least restrictive gun laws by 4 in 100,000 people.\nA 2003 study published in the \"American Journal of Preventive Medicine\" looked at the restrictiveness of gun laws and suicide rates in men and women in all 50 U.S. states and found that states whose gun laws were more restrictive had lower suicide rates among both sexes. In 2004, another study found that the effect of state gun laws on gun-related homicides was \"limited\".\nA 2005 study looked at all 50 states in the U.S. and the District of Columbia, and found that no gun laws were associated with reductions in firearm homicide or suicide, but that a \"shall-issue\" concealed carry law (mandatory issue of a license when legal criteria met) may be associated with increased firearm homicide rates.\nA 2011 study found that firearm regulation laws in the United States have \"a significant deterrent effect on male suicide\".\nA 2013 study by the American Medical Association found that in the United States, \"a higher number of firearm laws in a state are associated with a lower rate of firearm fatalities in that state.\" A 2016 study published in \"The Lancet\" found that of 25 laws studied, and in the time period examined (2008\u20132010), nine were associated with reduced firearm mortality (including both homicide and suicide), nine were associated with increased mortality, and seven had an inconclusive association. The three laws most strongly associated with reduced firearm mortality were laws requiring universal background checks, background checks for ammunition sales, and identification for guns. In an accompanying commentary, David Hemenway noted that this study had multiple limitations, such as not controlling for all factors that may influence gun-related deaths aside from gun control laws, and the use of 29 explanatory variables in the analysis.\nOther studies comparing gun control laws in different U.S. states include a 2015 study which found that in the United States, \"stricter state firearm legislation is associated with lower discharge rates\" for nonfatal gun injuries. A 2014 study that also looked at the United States found that children living in states with stricter gun laws were safer.\nA study looking specifically at suicide rates in the United States found that the four handgun laws examined (waiting periods, universal background checks, gun locks, and open carrying regulations) were associated with \"significantly lower firearm suicide rates and the proportion of suicides resulting from firearms\". The study also found that all four of these laws (except the waiting-period one) were associated with reductions in the overall suicide rate.\nAnother study, published the same year, found that states with permit to purchase, registration, and/or license laws for handguns had lower overall suicide rates, as well as lower firearm suicide rates.\n2014 study found that states that required licensing and inspections of gun dealers tended to have lower rates of gun homicides. Another study published the same year, analyzing panel data from all 50 states, found that stricter gun laws may modestly reduce gun deaths.\n2016 study found that U.S. military veterans tend to commit suicide with guns more often than the general population, thereby possibly increasing state suicide rates, and that \"the tendency for veterans to live in states without handgun legislation may exacerbate this phenomenon\". California has exceptionally strict gun sales laws, and a 2015 study found that it also had the oldest guns recovered in crimes of any states in the U.S. The same study concluded that \"These findings suggest that more restrictive gun sales laws and gun dealer regulations do make it more difficult for criminals to acquire new guns first purchased at retail outlets.\"\n2016 study found that stricter state gun laws in the United States reduced suicide rates.\nAnother 2016 study found that U.S. states with lenient gun control laws had more gun-related child injury hospital admissions than did states with stricter gun control laws.\n2017 study found that suicide rates declined more in states with universal background check and mandatory waiting period laws than in states without these laws.\nAnother 2017 study found that states without universal background check and/or waiting period laws had steeper increases in their suicide rates than did states with these laws.\nA third 2017 study found that \"waiting period laws that delay the purchase of firearms by a few days reduce gun homicides by roughly 17%\".\nA 2017 study in the \"Economic Journal\" found that mandatory handgun purchase delays reduced \"firearm-related suicides by between 2 and 5 percent with no statistically significant increase in non-firearm suicides\", and were \"not associated with statistically significant changes in homicide rates\".\nAnother study in 2017 showed that laws banning gun possession by people subject to intimate partner violence restraining orders, and requiring such people to give up any guns they have, were associated with lower intimate partner homicide rates.\n2021 study found that firearm purchase delay laws reduced homicide; the authors suggested that it was driven by reductions in gun purchases by impulsive customers.\nReviews.\nIn 2015, Daniel Webster and Garen Wintemute reviewed studies examining the effectiveness of gun laws aimed at keeping guns out of the hands of high-risk individuals in the United States. They found that some laws prohibiting gun possession by people under domestic violence restraining orders or who had been convicted of violent misdemeanors were associated with lower violence rates, as were laws establishing more procedures to see if people were prohibited from owning a gun under these laws. They also found that multiple other gun regulations intended to prevent prohibited individuals from obtaining guns, such as \"rigorous permit-to-purchase\" laws and \"comprehensive background checks\", were \"negatively associated with the diversion of guns to criminals\".\nA 2016 systematic review found that restrictive gun licensing laws were associated with lower gun injury rates, while concealed carry laws were not significantly associated with rates of such injuries. Another systematic review found that stricter gun laws were associated with lower gun homicide rates; this association was especially strong for background check and permit-to-purchase laws.\nA 2020 review of almost 13,000 studies by RAND Corporation found only 123 that met their criteria of methodological rigor, \"a surprisingly limited base of rigorous scientific evidence\". Only 2 of the 18 gun policies examined had supporting evidence. Among the policies for which RAND found supporting evidence were that child-access prevention laws reduce firearm injuries and deaths among children and that \"stand-your-ground\" laws increase firearm homicides. RAND also noted that the limited evidence currently available \"does not mean that these policies are ineffective\u00a0... Instead, it partly reflects shortcomings in the contributions that science has made to policy debates.\"\nStudies of individual laws.\nOther studies have examined trends in firearm-related deaths before and after gun control laws are either enacted or repealed. A 2004 study in the \"Journal of the American Medical Association\" found evidence that child access prevention laws were \"associated with a modest reduction in suicide rates among youth aged 14 to 17 years\".\nTwo 2015 studies found that the permit-to-purchase law passed in Connecticut in 1995 was associated with a reduction in firearm suicides and homicides. One of these studies also found that the repeal of Missouri's permit-to-purchase law was associated with \"a 16.1% increase in firearm suicide rates\", and a 2014 study by the same research team found that the repeal of this law was associated with a 16% increase in homicide rates.\nA 2000 study designed to assess the effectiveness of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act found that the law was not associated with reductions in overall homicide or suicide rates, but that it was associated with a reduction in the firearm suicide rate among individuals aged 55 or older.\nA 1991 study looked at Washington, D.C.'s Firearms Control Regulations Act of 1975, which banned its residents from owning all guns except certain shotguns and sporting rifles, which were also required to be stored unloaded, disassembled, or with a trigger lock in their owners' homes. The study found that the law's enactment was associated with \"a prompt decline in homicides and suicides by firearms in the District of Columbia\". A 1996 study reanalyzed this data and reached a significantly different conclusion as to the effectiveness of this law.\nOther studies and debate.\nIn 1993, Kleck and Patterson analyzed the impact of 18 major types of gun control laws on every major type of gun-involved crime or violence (including suicide) in 170 U.S. cities, and found that gun laws generally had no significant effect on violent crime rates or suicide rates. Similarly, a 1997 study found that gun control laws had only a small influence on the rate of gun deaths in U.S. states compared to socioeconomic variables like poverty and unemployment.\nPhilosophy professor Michael Huemer argues that gun control may be morally wrong, even if its outcomes would be positive, because individuals have a \"prima facie\" right to own a gun for self-defense and recreation.\nA 2007 article published by the \"Journal of Injury Prevention\" states that approximately 60% of firearms used to commit violent crime can be traced to 1% of licensed dealers. This finding indicates that, although gun laws effectively regulate approximately 99% of purchases made from licensed dealers, a majority of gun-related violent crimes are perpetrated using guns that were purchased in violation of regulations. The \"Journal of Injury Prevention\" article advocates for increased monitoring of gun vendors in tandem with the optimization of gun sale regulation, as a means to decrease violent crime perpetrated with a firearm.\nIn 2009, the Public Health Law Research program, an independent organization, published several evidence briefs summarizing the research assessing the effect of a specific law or policy on public health, that concern the effectiveness of various laws related to gun safety. Among their findings:\nRAND Corporation did a study that demonstrates that background checks may decrease suicides and violent crime; child-access prevention laws may decrease the number of suicides and unintentional injuries and deaths; minimum age requirements may decrease suicides; and prohibitions associated with mental illness may decrease suicides and violent crimes. On the other hand, concealed-carry laws may increase violent crimes and suicides, while stand-your-ground laws may increase violent crime. Bans on the sale of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines may increase the sale price for these items. An August 2019 article in \"Business Insider\" entitled \"Gun control really works\" looked at a dozen studies by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \"The Journal of the American Medical Association\", Rand Corporation, the journal \"Preventive Medicine,\" Everytown for Gun Safety, Johns Hopkins University, and others. They concluded that mirroring the firearms regulations in Switzerland such as banning the sale of new assault weapons, denying concealed-carry licenses to some individuals, and prohibiting firearm sales to people convicted of multiple alcohol-related offenses will decrease gun-related deaths and injuries.\nCanada.\nWith respect to the Criminal Law Amendment Act, a gun control law passed in Canada in 1977, some studies have found that it was ineffective at reducing homicide or robbery rates, with one study finding that the law may have actually increased robberies involving firearms.\nA 1993 study found that after 1977 law was passed, gun suicides decreased significantly, as did the proportion of suicides committed in the country with guns, with a 2003 study finding that the law \"may have had an impact on suicide rates, even after controls for social variables,\" and a 2001 study by the same research team concluding that the law \"may have had an impact on homicide rates, at least for older victims.\"\nA 1994 study found that after this law came into force in 1978, suicide rates decreased over time in Ontario, and that there was no evidence of method substitution. The same study found that \"These decreases may be only partly due to the legislation.\"\nIn 1991, Canada implemented the gun control law Bill C-17. According to a 2004 study, after this law was passed, firearm-related suicides and homicides, as well as the percentage of suicides involving firearms, declined significantly in that country. A 2010 study found that after this law was passed, firearm suicides declined in Quebec among men, but acknowledged that this may not represent a causal relationship. In 1992, Canada promulgated the Canadian Firearms Act, which aimed at ensuring that guns were stored safely.\nA 2004 study found that although firearm suicide rates declined in the Quebec region Abitibi-T\u00e9miscamingue after the law was passed, overall suicide rates did not. A study in 2005 also found that overall suicide rates did not change after passage of Bill C-17.\nA 2008 study reached similar conclusions with regard to the entire Quebec province; this study also found that C-17 did not seem to increase the rate at which the firearm suicide rate was declining. Other researchers have criticized this 2008 study for looking at too short a time period and not taking account of the fact that the regulations in C-17 were implemented gradually.\nA 1990 study compared suicide rates in the Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada metropolitan area (where gun control laws were more restrictive) with those in the Seattle, Washington area in the United States. The overall suicide rate was essentially the same in the two locations, but the suicide rate among 15 to 24 year olds was about 40 percent higher in Seattle than in Vancouver. The authors concluded that \"restricting access to handguns might be expected to reduce the suicide rate in persons 15 to 24 years old, but ... it probably would not reduce the overall suicide rate.\" A study that looked at provincial gun ownership rates, and associated suicide rates found no significant correlations with overall suicide rates.\nA 2011 study looked at gun control passed in Canada between 1974 and 2004 and found that gun laws were responsible for 5 to 10 percent drops in homicides. The study found that the homicide reduction effects of Canadian gun legislation remained even after accounting for sociodemographic and economic factors associated with homicide rates.\nA 2012 study looked at gun control laws passed in Canada from 1974 to 2008 and found no evidence that these laws had a beneficial effect on firearm homicide rates in that country. According to the study, \"other factors found to be associated with homicide rates were median age, unemployment, immigration rates, percentage of population in low-income bracket, Gini index of income equality, population per police officer, and incarceration rate.\"\nA 2013 study of the 1995 Canadian gun control law \"Firearms Act\" reported little evidence that this law significantly reduced rates of lethal gun violence against women.\nA 2020 study examining laws passed from 1981 to 2016 found no significant changes in overall homicide or suicide rates following changes in legislation. In addition, it also found that firearm ownership by province was not correlated to overall suicide rates by province.\nAustralia.\nA 2006 study by gun lobby-affiliated researchers Jeanine Baker and Samara McPhedran found that after Australia enacted the National Firearms Agreement (NFA), a gun control law, in 1996, gun-related suicides may have been affected, but no other parameter appeared to have been.\nAnother 2006 study, led by Simon Chapman, found that after this law was enacted in 1996 in Australia, the country went more than a decade without any mass shootings, and gun-related deaths (especially suicides) declined dramatically. The study looking at firearm deaths before and after the implication of the 1996 gun control reforms in the affects on control on mass shootings, homicides, and suicides found \"an accelerated decline in firearm deaths, particularly suicides. The study further found that removing \"rapid firing firearms may be an effective way of reducing mass shootings, firearm homicides and firearm suicides.\" The latter of these studies also criticized the former for using a time-series analysis despite the fact that, according to Chapman et al., \"calculating mortality rates and then treating them as a number in a time series ignores the natural variability inherent in the counts that make up the numerator of the rate.\" Chapman et al. also said that Baker and McPhedran used the Box\u2013Jenkins model inappropriately.\nIn 1988 and 1996, gun control laws were enacted in the Australian state of Victoria, both times following mass shootings. A 2004 study found that in the context of these laws, overall firearm-related deaths, especially suicides, declined dramatically. A 1995 study found preliminary evidence that gun control legislation enacted in Queensland, Australia, reduced suicide rates there.\nA 2010 study looking at the effect of the NFA on gun-related deaths found that the law \"did not have any large effects on reducing firearm homicide or suicide rates,\" although David Hemenway has criticized this study for using a structural break test despite the fact that such tests can miss the effects of policies in the presence of lags, or when the effect occurs over several years.\nAnother study, published the same year, found that Australia's gun buyback program reduced gun-related suicide rates by almost 80%, while non-gun death rates were not significantly affected.\nOther research has argued that although gun suicide rates fell after the NFA was enacted, the NFA may not have been responsible for this decrease and \"a change in social and cultural attitudes\" may have instead been at least partly responsible.\nA 2011 study found that \"Australia's prohibition of certain types of firearms\" has not prevented mass shootings. In 2016, Chapman co-authored another study that found that after the NFA was passed, there were no mass shootings in the country (as of May\u00a02016[ [update]]), and that gun-related death rates declined more quickly after the NFA than they did before it. The study also found, however, that non-gun suicide and homicide rates declined even more quickly after the NFA, leading the authors to conclude that \"it is not possible to determine whether the change in firearm deaths can be attributed to the gun law reforms.\"\nOther countries.\n2007 study found evidence that gun control laws passed in Austria in 1997 reduced the rates of firearm suicide and homicide in that country.\nIn Brazil, after disarmament laws were passed in 2003, gun-related mortality declined by 8% in 2004 relative to the previous year, the first decline observed in a decade. Gun-related hospitalizations also reversed their previous trend by decreasing 4.6% from 2003 to 2004.\n2006 study found that after gun control laws were passed in New Zealand in 1992, suicides committed with guns declined significantly, especially among youth. This study however found that overall suicide rates did not change significantly. A case-control study conducted in New Zealand found that gun ownership was significantly associated with a greater risk of gun suicides, but not suicides overall.\nA 2010 study looked at the effect of a policy adopted by the Israeli Defense Forces that restricted access to guns among adolescents on suicide rates, and found that \"Following the policy change, suicide rates decreased significantly by 40%.\" The authors concluded that \"The results of this study illustrate the ability of a relatively simple change in policy to have a major impact on suicide rates.\"\nA 2013 study showed that after the Military of Switzerland adopted the Army XXI reform, which restricted gun availability, in 2003, suicide rates\u00a0\u2013 both overall and firearm-related\u00a0\u2013 decreased.\nAnother 2013 study looking at four restrictive gun laws passed in Norway found that two of them may have reduced firearm mortality among men, but that the evidence was more inconclusive with respect to all of the laws they studied.\nA 2014 study found that after South Africa's Firearm Control Act was passed in 2000, homicide rates in the country declined, and concluded that \"stricter gun control mediated by the FCA accounted for a significant decrease in homicide overall, and firearm homicide in particular, during the study period [2001\u20132005].\"\nA 2000 study found that a ban on carrying guns in Colombia was associated with reductions in homicide rates in two cities in the country, namely, Cali and Bogot\u00e1.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

But if anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also. 40And if anyone would sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well. 41And if anyone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles. 42Give to the one who begs from you, and do not refuse the one who would borrow from you.\u2014\u200a\nIn the Sermon on the Plain in the Gospel of Luke chapter 6, as part of his command to \"love your enemies\", Jesus says:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;27But I say to you who hear, Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, 28bless those who curse you, pray for those who abuse you. 29To one who strikes you on the cheek, offer the other also, and from one who takes away your cloak do not withhold your tunic either. 30Give to everyone who begs from you, and from one who takes away your goods do not demand them back. 31And as you wish that others would do to you, do so to them.\u2014\u200a\nInterpretations.\nThis phrase, as with much of the Sermon on the Mount, has been subject to both literal and figurative interpretations.\nChristian anarchist interpretation.\nAccording to this interpretation, the passages call for total nonresistance to the point of \"facilitating\" aggression against oneself, and since human governments defend themselves by military force, some have advocated for Christian anarchism, including Leo Tolstoy who elucidated his reasoning in his 1894 book \"The Kingdom of God Is Within You\".\nNonviolent resistance interpretation.\nJewish scholars Amy-Jill Levine and Marc Brettler state that the issue is about justice after an injury has been committed. They argue that since the Greek word used in Matthew 5:39 for 'resist' is (which usually refers to armed resistance or violent struggle) Jesus is offering to confront violence, maintain one's honor, and shame the perpetrator, instead of escalating violence, or losing dignity. By offering the left cheek, the victim resists humiliation by inviting a right-handed jab which exposes the slap as a violent act that failed to reduce the humanity of the victim, thus challenging the perpetrator and shaming them for cruelty of treatment.\nThe scholar Walter Wink, in his book \"Engaging the Powers: Discernment and Resistance in a World of Domination\", interprets the passage as ways to subvert the power structures of the time. At the time of Jesus, says Wink, striking backhand a person deemed to be of lower socioeconomic class was a means of asserting authority and dominance. If the persecuted person \"turned the other cheek,\" the discipliner was faced with a dilemma: the left hand was used for unclean purposes, so a back-hand strike on the opposite cheek would not be performed. An alternative would be a slap with the open hand as a challenge or to punch the person, but this was seen as a statement of equality. Thus, by turning the other cheek, the persecuted was demanding equality.\nWink continues with an interpretation of handing over one's cloak in addition to one's tunic. The debtor has given the shirt off his back, a situation forbidden by Hebrew law as stated in Deuteronomy (24:10\u201313). By giving the lender the cloak as well, the debtor was reduced to nakedness. Wink notes that public nudity was viewed as bringing shame on the viewer, and not just the naked, as seen in Noah's case (Genesis 9:20\u201323).\nWink interprets the succeeding verse from the Sermon on the Mount as a method for making the oppressor break the law. The commonly invoked Roman law of Angaria allowed the Roman authorities to demand that inhabitants of occupied territories carry messages and equipment the distance of one mile post, but prohibited forcing an individual to go further than a single mile, at the risk of suffering disciplinary actions. In this example, the nonviolent interpretation sees Jesus as placing criticism on an unjust and hated Roman law, as well as clarifying the teaching to extend beyond Jewish law."}

Starring Howard Keel, Susan Kohner and John Saxon, the production is adapted from the 1948 novel of the same name by Lloyd C. Douglas. The film was shot at Universal-International studios but released by Buena Vista, the film releasing company of Walt Disney Productions.\n\"The Robe\" ends with \"the Big Fisherman\" as a nickname for Peter; Jesus called him \"the fisher of men\" and \"the Rock\".\nPlot.\nThe story traces Peter's journey from self-sufficient fisherman to his dependency on a risen Christ. It also presents another story of redemption and forgiveness, as he takes in a young Arab/Jewish girl, Fara. As they both learn of Jesus, it changes their lives.\nThe young Fara discovers that she is the daughter of Herod Antipas who married and shortly discarded her Arab mother Arnon in favor of Herodias. Disguised as a boy, Fara goes to Galilee to assassinate Antipas in revenge.\nRobbed by bandits, Fara is discovered by John the Baptist who advises her to listen to the great teacher, Jesus. She comes under the protection of Peter but persists in her vows to kill Antipas. She manages to be employed in Antipas' household to translate a series of prophecies.\nFara and Peter hear Jesus teaching. Fara turns away when he urges nonviolence. Peter is initially cynical, but in stages is drawn to become his disciple.\nFara gains an opportunity to kill Antipas, and reveals her identity to him. As Peter watches, Antipas urges her not to sink to murder. Fara recalls the words of Christ, and lowers her knife. Peter declares her free of her own chains.\nPeter takes Fara to Arabia where they rescue Voldi, an Arab prince who wishes to marry her. However, Fara realises that her mixed race would jeopardize his future rule, so she leaves with Peter to spread the word of peace.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Howard Keel as Simon-Peter\nProduction.\nThe film was Rowland V. Lee's first in over 10 years. It was shot in Super Panavision 70 (the first film so credited) by Lee Garmes. The original music score was composed by Albert Hay Malotte, an American composer who is best known for his musical setting of The Lord's Prayer, composed in 1935, and introduced on radio that year by John Charles Thomas.\nThough originally rejected by Walt Disney because of its religious tone, the film was supported by Roy Disney, and was distributed by Buena Vista, making it one of the few religious films ever associated with the Disney Company.\nIt was shot on location in the San Fernando Valley in California. Portions were shot at La Quinta, California.\nAfter having starred in a number of MGM film musicals from 1950 (\"Annie Get Your Gun\") to 1955 (\"Kismet\"), Howard Keel switched to straight acting roles with the 1958 British noir thriller \"Floods of Fear\", followed by \"The Big Fisherman\". He starred or co-starred in six additional features (four of which were westerns) between 1961 and 1968 and made his final appearance in a 2002 film, playing a supporting role.\nJohn Saxon was borrowed from Universal. It was the last film that Borzage completed.\nReception.\n\"Variety\" called it \"pious but plodding.\"\n\"Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide\" (2012 edition) gave \"The Big Fisherman\" 2\u00bd stars out of 4, describing it as a \"sprawling religious epic\" and deciding that it is \"seldom dull, but not terribly inspiring.\" \"Steven H. Scheuer's Movies on TV and Videocassette\" (1993\u20131994 edition) also settled on 2\u00bd stars out of 4, writing that \"the story of Simon called Peter\" \"unfolds with predictable pageantry and uplifting sermonizing\".\nAssigning 2 stars (out of 5), \"The Motion Picture Guide\" (1987 edition) found it to be \"long, often-enraging and totally miscast\" with \"a nonsinging Keel as Saint Peter\". Evaluating the presentation as \"just so much biblical nonsense because such liberties are taken that any serious student of the life and surrounding events will take exception,\" the write-up declares that \"Douglas wrote the novel but made the mistake of entrusting it to the wrong people.\" After pointing out the film's \"numerous technical mistakes: microphone boom shadows, klieg lights, Martha Hyer's vaccination mark\", the \"Guide\" concludes that \"to make a love story the focal point of such a potentially dynamic saga of history's most memorable era was a bad decision. One of the rare bummers by Disney in those years.\"\nLeslie Halliwell in his \"Film and Video Guide\" (5th edition, 1985) dismissed it as a \"well-meaning but leaden adaptation of a bestselling novel which followed on from \"The Robe\". He concluded that it is \"too reverent by half, and in many respects surprisingly incompetent.\" Halliwell's quoted \"Monthly Film Bulletin\" (\"its overall flatness of conception and execution is a stiff price to pay for the lack of spectacular sensationalism characterizing its fellow-epics\") and \"The Hollywood Reporter\" (\"the picture is three hours long, and, except for those who can be dazzled by big gatherings of props, horses and camels, it is hard to find three minutes of entertainment in it\").\nRunning time.\n\"Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide\" (2012 edition) notes that the film's running time was originally 184 minutes, then cut to 164 minutes then to 149 minutes.\nAwards and honors.\nThe film was nominated for three Academy Awards:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "44284", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44284", "title": "Non-coding DNA", "text": "DNA that does not code for proteins\nNon-coding DNA (ncDNA) sequences are components of an organism's DNA that do not encode protein sequences. Some non-coding DNA is transcribed into functional non-coding RNA molecules (e.g. transfer RNA, microRNA, piRNA, ribosomal RNA, and regulatory RNAs). Other functional regions of the non-coding DNA fraction include regulatory sequences that control gene expression; scaffold attachment regions; origins of DNA replication; centromeres; and telomeres. Some non-coding regions appear to be mostly nonfunctional, such as introns, pseudogenes, intergenic DNA, and fragments of transposons and viruses. Regions that are completely nonfunctional are called junk DNA.\nFraction of non-coding genomic DNA.\nIn bacteria, the coding regions typically take up 88% of the genome. The remaining 12% does not encode proteins, but much of it still has biological function through genes where the RNA transcript is functional (non-coding genes) and regulatory sequences, which means that almost all of the bacterial genome has a function. The amount of coding DNA in eukaryotes is usually a much smaller fraction of the genome because eukaryotic genomes contain large amounts of repetitive DNA not found in prokaryotes. The human genome contains somewhere between 1\u20132% coding DNA. The exact number is not known because there are disputes over the number of functional coding exons and over the total size of the human genome. This means that 98\u201399% of the human genome consists of non-coding DNA and this includes many functional elements such as non-coding genes and regulatory sequences.\nGenome size in eukaryotes can vary over a wide range, even between closely related species. This puzzling observation was originally known as the C-value paradox where \"C\" refers to the haploid genome size. The paradox was resolved with the discovery that most of the differences were due to the expansion and contraction of repetitive DNA and not the number of genes. Some researchers speculated that this repetitive DNA was mostly junk DNA. The reasons for the changes in genome size are still being worked out and this problem is called the C-value Enigma.\nThis led to the observation that the number of genes does not seem to correlate with perceived notions of complexity because the number of genes seems to be relatively constant, an issue termed the G-value Paradox. For example, the genome of the unicellular \"Polychaos dubium\" (formerly known as \"Amoeba dubia\") has been reported to contain more than 200 times the amount of DNA in humans (i.e. more than 600 billion pairs of bases vs a bit more than 3 billion in humans). The pufferfish \"Takifugu rubripes\" genome is only about one eighth the size of the human genome, yet seems to have a comparable number of genes. Genes take up about 30% of the pufferfish genome and the coding DNA is about 10%. (Non-coding DNA = 90%.) The reduced size of the pufferfish genome is due to a reduction in the length of introns and less repetitive DNA.\n\"Utricularia gibba\", a bladderwort plant, has a very small nuclear genome (100.7 Mb) compared to most plants. It likely evolved from an ancestral genome that was 1,500 Mb in size. The bladderwort genome has roughly the same number of genes as other plants but the total amount of coding DNA comes to about 30% of the genome. \nThe remainder of the genome (70% non-coding DNA) consists of promoters and regulatory sequences that are shorter than those in other plant species. The genes contain introns but there are fewer of them and they are smaller than the introns in other plant genomes. There are noncoding genes, including many copies of ribosomal RNA genes. The genome also contains telomere sequences and centromeres as expected. Much of the repetitive DNA seen in other eukaryotes has been deleted from the bladderwort genome since that lineage split from those of other plants. About 59% of the bladderwort genome consists of transposon-related sequences but since the genome is so much smaller than other genomes, this represents a considerable reduction in the amount of this DNA. The authors of the original 2013 article note that claims of additional functional elements in the non-coding DNA of animals do not seem to apply to plant genomes.\nAccording to a New York Times article, during the evolution of this species, \"... genetic junk that didn't serve a purpose was expunged, and the necessary stuff was kept.\" According to Victor Albert of the University of Buffalo, the plant is able to expunge its so-called junk DNA and \"have a perfectly good multicellular plant with lots of different cells, organs, tissue types and flowers, and you can do it without the junk. Junk is not needed.\"\nTypes of non-coding DNA sequences.\nNoncoding genes.\nThere are two types of genes: protein coding genes and noncoding genes. Noncoding genes are an important part of non-coding DNA and they include genes for transfer RNA and ribosomal RNA. These genes were discovered in the 1960s. Prokaryotic genomes contain genes for a number of other noncoding RNAs but noncoding RNA genes are much more common in eukaryotes.\nTypical classes of noncoding genes in eukaryotes include genes for small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), small nucleolar RNAs (sno RNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). In addition, there are a number of unique RNA genes that produce catalytic RNAs.\nNoncoding genes account for only a few percent of prokaryotic genomes but they can represent a vastly higher fraction in eukaryotic genomes. In humans, the noncoding genes take up at least 6% of the genome, largely because there are hundreds of copies of ribosomal RNA genes. Protein-coding genes occupy about 38% of the genome; a fraction that is much higher than the coding region because genes contain large introns.\nThe total number of noncoding genes in the human genome is controversial. Some scientists think that there are only about 5,000 noncoding genes while others believe that there may be more than 100,000 (see the article on Non-coding RNA). The difference is largely due to debate over the number of lncRNA genes.\nPromoters and regulatory elements.\nPromoters are DNA segments near the 5' end of the gene where transcription begins. They are the sites where RNA polymerase binds to initiate RNA synthesis. Every gene has a noncoding promoter.\nRegulatory elements are sites that control the transcription of a nearby gene. They are almost always sequences where transcription factors bind to DNA and these transcription factors can either activate transcription (activators) or repress transcription (repressors). Regulatory elements were discovered in the 1960s and their general characteristics were worked out in the 1970s by studying specific transcription factors in bacteria and bacteriophage.\nPromoters and regulatory sequences represent an abundant class of noncoding DNA but they mostly consist of a collection of relatively short sequences so they do not take up a very large fraction of the genome. The exact amount of regulatory DNA in mammalian genome is unclear because it is difficult to distinguish between spurious transcription factor binding sites and those that are functional. The binding characteristics of typical DNA-binding proteins were characterized in the 1970s and the biochemical properties of transcription factors predict that in cells with large genomes, the majority of binding sites will not be biologically functional.\nMany regulatory sequences occur near promoters, usually upstream of the transcription start site of the gene. Some occur within a gene and a few are located downstream of the transcription termination site. In eukaryotes, there are some regulatory sequences that are located at a considerable distance from the promoter region. These distant regulatory sequences are often called enhancers but there is no rigorous definition of enhancer that distinguishes it from other transcription factor binding sites.\nIntrons.\nIntrons are the parts of a gene that are transcribed into the precursor RNA sequence, but ultimately removed by RNA splicing during the processing to mature RNA. Introns are found in both types of genes: protein-coding genes and noncoding genes. They are present in prokaryotes but they are much more common in eukaryotic genomes.\nGroup I and group II introns take up only a small percentage of the genome when they are present. Spliceosomal introns (see Figure) are only found in eukaryotes and they can represent a substantial proportion of the genome. In humans, for example, introns in protein-coding genes cover 37% of the genome. Combining that with about 1% coding sequences means that protein-coding genes occupy about 38% of the human genome. The calculations for noncoding genes are more complicated because there is considerable dispute over the total number of noncoding genes but taking only the well-defined examples means that noncoding genes occupy at least 6% of the genome.\nUntranslated regions.\nThe standard biochemistry and molecular biology textbooks describe non-coding nucleotides in mRNA located between the 5' end of the gene and the translation initiation codon. These regions are called 5'-untranslated regions or 5'-UTRs. Similar regions called 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTRs) are found at the end of the gene. The 5'-UTRs and 3'UTRs are very short in bacteria but they can be several hundred nucleotides in length in eukaryotes. They contain short elements that control the initiation of translation (5'-UTRs) and transcription termination (3'-UTRs) as well as regulatory elements that may control mRNA stability, processing, and targeting to different regions of the cell.\nOrigins of replication.\nDNA synthesis begins at specific sites called origins of replication. These are regions of the genome where the DNA replication machinery is assembled and the DNA is unwound to begin DNA synthesis. In most cases, replication proceeds in both directions from the replication origin.\nThe main features of replication origins are sequences where specific initiation proteins are bound. A typical replication origin covers about 100-200 base pairs of DNA. Prokaryotes have one origin of replication per chromosome or plasmid but there are usually multiple origins in eukaryotic chromosomes. The human genome contains about 100,000 origins of replication representing about 0.3% of the genome.\nCentromeres.\nCentromeres are the sites where spindle fibers attach to newly replicated chromosomes in order to segregate them into daughter cells when the cell divides. Each eukaryotic chromosome has a single functional centromere that is seen as a constricted region in a condensed metaphase chromosome. Centromeric DNA consists of a number of repetitive DNA sequences that often take up a significant fraction of the genome because each centromere can be millions of base pairs in length. In humans, for example, the sequences of all 24 centromeres have been determined and they account for about 6% of the genome. However, it is unlikely that all of this noncoding DNA is essential since there is considerable variation in the total amount of centromeric DNA in different individuals. Centromeres are another example of functional noncoding DNA sequences that have been known for almost half a century and it is likely that they are more abundant than coding DNA.\nTelomeres.\nTelomeres are regions of repetitive DNA at the end of a chromosome, which provide protection from chromosomal deterioration during DNA replication. Recent studies have shown that telomeres function to aid in its own stability. Telomeric repeat-containing RNA (TERRA) are transcripts derived from telomeres. TERRA has been shown to maintain telomerase activity and lengthen the ends of chromosomes.\nScaffold attachment regions.\nBoth prokaryotic and eukarotic genomes are organized into large loops of protein-bound DNA. In eukaryotes, the bases of the loops are called scaffold attachment regions (SARs) and they consist of stretches of DNA that bind an RNA/protein complex to stabilize the loop. There are about 100,000 loops in the human genome and each SAR consists of about 100 bp of DNA, so the total amount of DNA devoted to SARs accounts for about 0.3% of the human genome.\nPseudogenes.\nPseudogenes are mostly former genes that have become non-functional due to mutation, but the term also refers to inactive DNA sequences that are derived from RNAs produced by functional genes (processed pseudogenes). Pseudogenes are only a small fraction of noncoding DNA in prokaryotic genomes because they are eliminated by negative selection. In some eukaryotes, however, pseudogenes can accumulate because selection is not powerful enough to eliminate them (see Nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution).\nThe human genome contains about 15,000 pseudogenes derived from protein-coding genes and an unknown number derived from noncoding genes. They may cover a substantial fraction of the genome (~5%) since many of them contain former intron sequences.\nPseudogenes are junk DNA by definition and they evolve at the neutral rate as expected for junk DNA. Some former pseudogenes have secondarily acquired a function and this leads some scientists to speculate that most pseudogenes are not junk because they have a yet-to-be-discovered function.\nRepeat sequences, transposons and viral elements.\nTransposons and retrotransposons are mobile genetic elements. Retrotransposon repeated sequences, which include long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs) and short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs), account for a large proportion of the genomic sequences in many species. Alu sequences, classified as a short interspersed nuclear element, are the most abundant mobile elements in the human genome. Some examples have been found of SINEs exerting transcriptional control of some protein-encoding genes.\nEndogenous retrovirus sequences are the product of reverse transcription of retrovirus genomes into the genomes of germ cells. Mutation within these retro-transcribed sequences can inactivate the viral genome.\nOver 8% of the human genome is made up of (mostly decayed) endogenous retrovirus sequences, as part of the over 42% fraction that is recognizably derived of retrotransposons, while another 3% can be identified to be the remains of DNA transposons. Much of the remaining half of the genome that is currently without an explained origin is expected to have found its origin in transposable elements that were active so long ago (&gt; 200 million years) that random mutations have rendered them unrecognizable. Genome size variation in at least two kinds of plants is mostly the result of retrotransposon sequences.\nHighly repetitive DNA.\nHighly repetitive DNA consists of short stretches of DNA that are repeated many times in tandem (one after the other). The repeat segments are usually between 2 bp and 10 bp but longer ones are known. Highly repetitive DNA is rare in prokaryotes but common in eukaryotes, especially those with large genomes. It is sometimes called satellite DNA.\nMost of the highly repetitive DNA is found in centromeres and telomeres (see above) and most of it is functional although some might be redundant. The other significant fraction resides in short tandem repeats (STRs; also called microsatellites) consisting of short stretches of a simple repeat such as ATC. There are about 350,000 STRs in the human genome and they are scattered throughout the genome with an average length of about 25 repeats.\nVariations in the number of STR repeats can cause genetic diseases when they lie within a gene but most of these regions appear to be non-functional junk DNA where the number of repeats can vary considerably from individual to individual. This is why these length differences are used extensively in DNA fingerprinting.\nJunk DNA.\nJunk DNA is DNA that has no biologically relevant function such as pseudogenes and fragments of once active transposons. Bacteria and viral genomes have very little junk DNA but some eukaryotic genomes may have a substantial amount of junk DNA. The exact amount of nonfunctional DNA in humans and other species with large genomes has not been determined and there is considerable controversy in the scientific literature.\nThe nonfunctional DNA in bacterial genomes is mostly located in the intergenic fraction of non-coding DNA but in eukaryotic genomes it may also be found within introns. There are many examples of functional DNA elements in non-coding DNA, and it is erroneous to equate non-coding DNA with junk DNA.\nGenome-wide association studies (GWAS) and non-coding DNA.\nGenome-wide association studies (GWAS) identify linkages between alleles and observable traits such as phenotypes and diseases. Most of the associations are between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the trait being examined and most of these SNPs are located in non-functional DNA. The association establishes a linkage that helps map the DNA region responsible for the trait but it does not necessarily identify the mutations causing the disease or phenotypic difference.\nSNPs that are tightly linked to traits are the ones most likely to identify a causal mutation. (The association is referred to as tight linkage disequilibrium.) About 12% of these polymorphisms are found in coding regions; about 40% are located in introns; and most of the rest are found in intergenic regions, including regulatory sequences.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is known for writing most of the Captain Future stories.\nEarly life.\nBorn in Youngstown, Ohio, he was raised there and in nearby New Castle, Pennsylvania. Something of a child prodigy, he graduated from high school and entered Westminster College in New Wilmington, Pennsylvania at the age of 14, but dropped out at 17.\nWriting career.\nEdmond Hamilton's career as a science fiction writer began with the publication of \"The Monster God of Mamurth\", a short story, in the August 1926 issue of \"Weird Tales\". Hamilton quickly became a central member of the remarkable group of \"Weird Tales\" writers assembled by editor Farnsworth Wright, that included H. P. Lovecraft and Robert E. Howard. \"Weird Tales\" would publish 79 works of fiction by Hamilton from 1926 to 1948, making him one of the magazine's most prolific contributors. Hamilton became a friend and associate of several \"Weird Tales\" veterans, including E. Hoffmann Price and Otis Adelbert Kline; most notably, he struck up a 20-year friendship with close contemporary Jack Williamson, as Williamson records in his 1984 autobiography \"Wonder's Child.\" In the late 1930s \"Weird Tales\" printed several striking fantasy tales by Hamilton, most notably \"He That Hath Wings\" (July 1938), one of his most popular and frequently reprinted pieces. Hamilton wrote one of the first hardcover compilations of what would eventually come to be known as the science fiction genre, \"The Horror on The Asteroid and Other Tales of Planetary Horror\" (1936). The book comprises the following stories: \"The Horror on the Asteroid\", \"The Accursed Galaxy\", \"The Man Who Saw Everything\" (\"The Man With the X-Ray Eyes\"), \"The Earth-Brain\", \"The Monster-God of Mamurth\", and \"The Man Who Evolved\".\nThrough the late 1920s and early 1930s Hamilton wrote for all of the science fiction pulp magazines then publishing, and contributed horror and thriller stories to various other magazines as well. He was popular as an author of space opera, a subgenre he created along with E. E. Smith, and which earned him nicknames like \u201cThe World Wrecker\u201d. His story \"The Island of Unreason\" (\"Wonder Stories\", May 1933) won the first Jules Verne Prize as the best science fiction story of the year (this was the first science fiction prize awarded by the votes of fans, a precursor of the later Hugo Awards). In the later 1930s, in response to the economic strictures of the Great Depression, he also wrote detective and crime stories. Always prolific in stereotypical pulp magazine fashion, Hamilton sometimes saw four or five of his stories appear in a single month in these years; the February 1937 issue of the pulp \"Popular Detective\" featured three Hamilton stories, one under his name and two under pseudonyms. In the 1940s, Hamilton was the primary force behind the \"Captain Future\" franchise, a science fiction pulp designed for juvenile readers that won him many fans, but diminished his reputation in later years when science fiction moved away from space opera. Hamilton was associated with an extravagant, romantic, high-adventure style of science fiction, perhaps best represented by his 1947 novel \"The Star Kings.\"\nIn 1942 Hamilton began writing for DC Comics, specializing in stories for their characters Superman and Batman. His first comics story was \"Bandits in Toyland\" in \"Batman\" #11 (June\u2013July 1942). He wrote the short-lived science fiction series Chris KL-99 in \"Strange Adventures\", loosely based on Captain Future. He and artist Sheldon Moldoff created Batwoman in \"Detective Comics\" #233 (July 1956). Hamilton co-created Space Ranger in \"Showcase\" #15 (July\u2013Aug. 1958) with Gardner Fox and Bob Brown. He also wrote the well-regarded three-part story \"The Last Days of Superman\" in \"Superman\" #156 (Oct 1962). Hamilton was also among the first regular writers for \"Legion of Super-Heroes\", where he created Timber Wolf, the Time Trapper, and the Legion of Substitute Heroes, among other characters. \"The Clash of Cape and Cowl\" in \"World's Finest Comics\" #153 (Nov. 1965) is the source of an Internet meme in which Batman slaps Robin. Hamilton retired from comics with the publication of \"The Cape and Cowl Crooks\" in \"World's Finest Comics\" #159 (August 1966).\nIn 1969, the Macfadden/Bartell Corporation published a collection of short science fiction stories \"Alien Earth and Other Stories\" (520-00219-075), where Hamilton's 1949 \"Alien Earth\" was featured along with novelettes by Isaac Asimov, Robert Bloch, Ray Bradbury, Arthur C. Clarke and others.\nMarriage and collaboration.\nHamilton met fellow science fiction author and screenwriter Leigh Brackett for the first time in the summer of 1940, but lost track of her during the war years. They met once again at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, where she and Ray Bradbury invited him to the coast in 1946. On December 31, 1946, Hamilton married her in San Gabriel, California, and moved with her to Kinsman, Ohio. Afterward he would produce some of his best work including his novels \"The Star of Life\" (1947), \"The Valley of Creation\" (1948), \"City at World's End\" (1951) and \"The Haunted Stars\" (1960). In this more mature phase of his career, Hamilton moved away from the romantic and fantastic elements of his earlier fiction to create some unsentimental and realistic stories, such as \"What's It Like Out There?\" (\"Thrilling Wonder Stories\", December 1952), his single most frequently-reprinted and anthologized work.\nThough Hamilton and Leigh Brackett worked side by side for a quarter-century, they rarely shared the task of authorship; their single formal collaboration, \"Stark and the Star Kings\", originally intended for Harlan Ellison's \"The Last Dangerous Visions\", would not appear in print until 2005. It has been speculated that when Brackett temporarily abandoned science fiction for screenwriting in the early 1960s, Hamilton did an uncredited revision and expansion of two early Brackett stories, \"Black Amazon of Mars\" and \"Queen of the Martian Catacombs\"\u00a0\u2014 revised texts were published as the novellas \"People of the Talisman\" and \"The Secret of Sinharat\" (1964).\nHamilton died in February 1977 in Lancaster, California, of complications following kidney surgery. In the year before his death, Toei Animation had launched production of an anime adaptation of his Captain Future novels and Tsuburaya Productions adapted \"Star Wolf\" into a tokusatsu series; both series were aired on Japanese television in 1978. The \"Captain Future\" adaptation was later exported to Europe, winning Hamilton a new and different fan base than the one that had acclaimed him half a century before, notably in France, Italy and Germany.\nJoint interviews of Brackett and Hamilton by Dave Truesdale were published in \"Tangent\" (Summer 1976), and by Darrell Schweitzer in \"Amazing Stories\" (January 1978),\u00a0\u2014 the latter published several months after Hamilton's death, but conducted \"much earlier\", Truesdale attributes to Schweitzer.\nEdmond Hamilton / Leigh Brackett Day.\nOn July 18, 2009, Kinsman, Ohio, \"celebrat[ed] Edmond Hamilton Day, honoring 'The Dean of Science Fiction' and Kinsman resident\".\nSelected works.\n\"Captain Future\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nVolumes #14 (\"Worlds to Come\", 1943) and #17 (\"Days of Creation\", 1944) were written by Joseph Samachson while #20, \"The Solar Invasion\" (1946) was by Manly Wade Wellman.

DNA analysis intended to identify a species, rather than an individual, is called DNA barcoding.\nDNA profiling is a forensic technique in criminal investigations, comparing criminal suspects' profiles to DNA evidence so as to assess the likelihood of their involvement in the crime. It is also used in paternity testing, to establish immigration eligibility, and in genealogical and medical research. DNA profiling has also been used in the study of animal and plant populations in the fields of zoology, botany, and agriculture. DNA profiling was discovered by British geneticist Sir Alec Jeffreys in 1984 while he was working at the University of Leicester. He developed the technique of genetic fingerprinting by realizing that some regions of DNA have highly variable repetitive sequences that are unique to each individual. \nBackground.\nStarting in the mid 1970s, scientific advances allowed the use of DNA as a material for the identification of an individual. The first patent covering the direct use of DNA variation for forensics (https://) was issued in 1997, continued from an application first filed by Jeffrey Glassberg in 1983, based upon work he had done while at Rockefeller University in the United States in 1981.\nBritish geneticist Sir Alec Jeffreys independently developed a process for DNA profiling in 1984 while working in the Department of Genetics at the University of Leicester. Jeffreys discovered that a DNA examiner could establish patterns in unknown DNA. These patterns were a part of inherited traits that could be used to advance the field of relationship analysis. These discoveries led to the first use of DNA profiling in a criminal case.\nThe process, developed by Jeffreys in conjunction with Peter Gill and Dave Werrett of the Forensic Science Service (FSS), was first used forensically in the solving of the murder of two teenagers who had been raped and murdered in Narborough, Leicestershire in 1983 and 1986. In the murder inquiry, led by Detective David Baker, the DNA contained within blood samples obtained voluntarily from around 5,000 local men who willingly assisted Leicestershire Constabulary with the investigation, resulted in the exoneration of Richard Buckland, an initial suspect who had confessed to one of the crimes, and the subsequent conviction of Colin Pitchfork on January 2, 1988. Pitchfork, a local bakery employee, had coerced his coworker Ian Kelly to stand in for him when providing a blood sample\u2014Kelly then used a forged passport to impersonate Pitchfork. Another coworker reported the deception to the police. Pitchfork was arrested, and his blood was sent to Jeffreys' lab for processing and profile development. Pitchfork's profile matched that of DNA left by the murderer which confirmed Pitchfork's presence at both crime scenes; he pleaded guilty to both murders. After some years, a chemical company named Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) introduced the first ever commercially available kit to the world. Despite being a relatively recent field, it had a significant global influence on both criminal justice system and society.\nAlthough 99.9% of human DNA sequences are the same in every person, enough of the DNA is different that it is possible to distinguish one individual from another, unless they are monozygotic (identical) twins. DNA profiling uses repetitive sequences that are highly variable, called variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs), in particular short tandem repeats (STRs), also known as microsatellites, and minisatellites. VNTR loci are similar between closely related individuals, but are so variable that unrelated individuals are unlikely to have the same VNTRs.\nBefore VNTRs and STRs, people like Jeffreys used a process called restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). This process regularly used large portions of DNA to analyze the differences between two DNA samples. RFLP was among the first technologies used in DNA profiling and analysis. However, as technology has evolved, new technologies, like STR, emerged and took the place of older technology like RFLP.\nThe admissibility of DNA evidence in courts was disputed in the United States in the 1980s and 1990s, but has since become more universally accepted due to improved techniques.\nProfiling processes.\nDNA extraction.\nWhen a sample such as blood or saliva is obtained, the DNA is only a small part of what is present in the sample. Before the DNA can be analyzed, it must be extracted from the cells and purified. There are many ways this can be accomplished, but all methods follow the same basic procedure. The cell and nuclear membranes need to be broken up to allow the DNA to be free in solution. Once the DNA is free, it can be separated from all other cellular components. After the DNA has been separated in solution, the remaining cellular debris can then be removed from the solution and discarded, leaving only DNA. The most common methods of DNA extraction include organic extraction (also called phenol\u2013chloroform extraction), Chelex extraction, and solid-phase extraction. Differential extraction is a modified version of extraction in which DNA from two different types of cells can be separated from each other before being purified from the solution. Each method of extraction works well in the laboratory, but analysts typically select their preferred method based on factors such as the cost, the time involved, the quantity of DNA yielded, and the quality of DNA yielded.\nRFLP analysis.\nRFLP stands for restriction fragment length polymorphism and, in terms of DNA analysis, describes a DNA testing method which utilizes restriction enzymes to \"cut\" the DNA at short and specific sequences throughout the sample. To start off processing in the laboratory, the sample has to first go through an extraction protocol, which may vary depending on the sample type or laboratory SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures). Once the DNA has been \"extracted\" from the cells within the sample and separated away from extraneous cellular materials and any nucleases that would degrade the DNA, the sample can then be introduced to the desired restriction enzymes to be cut up into discernable fragments. Following the enzyme digestion, a Southern Blot is performed. Southern Blots are a size-based separation method that are performed on a gel with either radioactive or chemiluminescent probes. RFLP could be conducted with single-locus or multi-locus probes (probes which target either one location on the DNA or multiple locations on the DNA). Incorporating the multi-locus probes allowed for higher discrimination power for the analysis, however completion of this process could take several days to a week for one sample due to the extreme amount of time required by each step required for visualization of the probes.\nPolymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis.\nThis technique was developed in 1983 by Kary Mullis. PCR is now a common and important technique used in medical and biological research labs for a variety of applications.\nPCR, or Polymerase Chain Reaction, is a widely used molecular biology technique to amplify a specific DNA sequence.\nAmplification is achieved by a series of three steps:\n1- Denaturation : In this step, the DNA is heated to 95 \u00b0C to dissociate the hydrogen bonds between the complementary base pairs of the double-stranded DNA.\n2-Annealing : During this stage the reaction is cooled to 50-65 \u00b0C . This enables the primers to attach to a specific location on the single -stranded template DNA by way of hydrogen bonding.\n3-Extension : A thermostable DNA polymerase which is Taq polymerase is commonly used at this step. This is done at a temperature of 72 \u00b0C . DNA polymerase adds nucleotides in the 5'-3' direction and synthesizes the complementary strand of the DNA template .\nSTR analysis.\nThe system of DNA profiling used today is based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and uses simple sequences.\nFrom country to country, different STR-based DNA-profiling systems are in use. In North America, systems that amplify the CODIS 20 core loci are almost universal, whereas in the United Kingdom the DNA-17 loci system is in use, and Australia uses 18 core markers.\nThe true power of STR analysis is in its statistical power of discrimination. Because the 20 loci that are currently used for discrimination in CODIS are independently assorted (having a certain number of repeats at one locus does not change the likelihood of having any number of repeats at any other locus), the product rule for probabilities can be applied. This means that, if someone has the DNA type of ABC, where the three loci were independent, then the probability of that individual having that DNA type is the probability of having type A times the probability of having type B times the probability of having type C. This has resulted in the ability to generate match probabilities of 1 in a quintillion (1x1018) or more. However, DNA database searches showed much more frequent than expected false DNA profile matches.\nY-chromosome analysis.\nDue to the paternal inheritance, Y-haplotypes provide information about the genetic ancestry of the male population. To investigate this population history, and to provide estimates for haplotype frequencies in criminal casework, the \"Y haplotype reference database (YHRD)\" has been created in 2000 as an online resource. It currently comprises more than 300,000 minimal (8 locus) haplotypes from world-wide populations.\nMitochondrial analysis.\nmtDNA can be obtained from such material as hair shafts and old bones/teeth. Control mechanism based on interaction point with data. This can be determined by tooled placement in sample.\nIssues with forensic DNA samples.\nWhen people think of DNA analysis, they often think about television shows like \"NCIS\" or \"\", which portray DNA samples coming into a lab and being instantly analyzed, followed by the pulling up of a picture of the suspect within minutes\u2060. However, the reality is quite different, and perfect DNA samples are often not collected from the scene of a crime. Homicide victims are frequently left exposed to harsh conditions before they are found, and objects that are used to commit crimes have often been handled by more than one person. The two most prevalent issues that forensic scientists encounter when analyzing DNA samples are degraded samples and DNA mixtures.\nDegraded DNA.\nBefore modern PCR methods existed, it was almost impossible to analyze degraded DNA samples. Methods like restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), which was the first technique used for DNA analysis in forensic science, required high molecular weight DNA in the sample in order to get reliable data. High molecular weight DNA, however, is lacking in degraded samples, as the DNA is too fragmented to carry out RFLP accurately. It was only when polymerase chain reaction techniques were invented that analysis of degraded DNA samples were able to be carried out. Multiplex PCR in particular made it possible to isolate and to amplify the small fragments of DNA that are still left in degraded samples. When multiplex PCR methods are compared to the older methods like RFLP, a vast difference can be seen. Multiplex PCR can theoretically amplify less than 1\u00a0ng of DNA, but RFLP had to have a least 100\u00a0ng of DNA in order to carry out an analysis.\nLow-template DNA.\nLow-template DNA can happen when there is less than 0.1\u00a0ng() of DNA in a sample. This can lead to more stochastic effects (random events) such as allelic dropout or allelic drop-in which can alter the interpretation of a DNA profile. These stochastic effects can lead to the unequal amplification of the 2 alleles that come from a heterozygous individual. It is especially important to take low-template DNA into account when dealing with a mixture of DNA sample. This is because for one (or more) of the contributors in the mixture, they are more likely to have less than the optimal amount of DNA for the PCR reaction to work properly. Therefore, stochastic thresholds are developed for DNA profile interpretation. The stochastic threshold is the minimum peak height (RFU value), seen in an electropherogram where dropout occurs. If the peak height value is above this threshold, then it is reasonable to assume that allelic dropout has not occurred. For example, if only 1 peak is seen for a particular locus in the electropherogram but its peak height is above the stochastic threshold, then we can reasonably assume that this individual is homozygous and is not missing its heterozygous partner allele that otherwise would have dropped out due to having low-template DNA. Allelic dropout can occur when there is low-template DNA because there is such little DNA to start with that at this locus the contributor to the DNA sample (or mixture) is a true heterozygote but the other allele is not amplified and so it would be lost. Allelic drop-in can also occur when there is low-template DNA because sometimes the stutter peak can be amplified. The stutter is an artifact of PCR. During the PCR reaction, DNA Polymerase will come in and add nucleotides off of the primer, but this whole process is very dynamic, meaning that the DNA Polymerase is constantly binding, popping off and then rebinding. Therefore, sometimes DNA Polymerase will rejoin at the short tandem repeat ahead of it, leading to a short tandem repeat that is 1 repeat less than the template. During PCR, if DNA Polymerase happens to bind to a locus in stutter and starts to amplify it to make lots of copies, then this stutter product will appear randomly in the electropherogram, leading to allelic drop-in.\nMiniSTR analysis.\nIn instances in which DNA samples are degraded, like if there are intense fires or all that remains are bone fragments, standard STR testing on those samples can be inadequate. When standard STR testing is done on highly degraded samples, the larger STR loci often drop out, and only partial DNA profiles are obtained. Partial DNA profiles can be a powerful tool, but the probability of a random match is larger than if a full profile was obtained. One method that has been developed to analyse degraded DNA samples is to use miniSTR technology. In the new approach, primers are specially designed to bind closer to the STR region.\nIn normal STR testing, the primers bind to longer sequences that contain the STR region within the segment. MiniSTR analysis, however, targets only the STR location, which results in a DNA product that is much smaller.\nBy placing the primers closer to the actual STR regions, there is a higher chance that successful amplification of this region will occur. Successful amplification of those STR regions can now occur, and more complete DNA profiles can be obtained. The success that smaller PCR products produce a higher success rate with highly degraded samples was first reported in 1995, when miniSTR technology was used to identify victims of the Waco fire.\nDNA mixtures.\nMixtures are another common issue faced by forensic scientists when they are analyzing unknown or questionable DNA samples. A mixture is defined as a DNA sample that contains two or more individual contributors. That can often occur when a DNA sample is swabbed from an item that is handled by more than one person or when a sample contains both the victim's and the assailant's DNA. The presence of more than one individual in a DNA sample can make it challenging to detect individual profiles, and interpretation of mixtures should be performed only by highly trained individuals. Mixtures that contain two or three individuals can be interpreted with difficulty. Mixtures that contain four or more individuals are much too convoluted to get individual profiles. One common scenario in which a mixture is often obtained is in the case of sexual assault. A sample may be collected that contains material from the victim, the victim's consensual sexual partners, and the perpetrator(s).\nMixtures can generally be sorted into three categories: Type A, Type B, and Type C. Type A mixtures have alleles with similar peak-heights all around, so the contributors cannot be distinguished from each other. Type B mixtures can be deconvoluted by comparing peak-height ratios to determine which alleles were donated together. Type C mixtures cannot be safely interpreted with current technology because the samples were affected by DNA degradation or having too small a quantity of DNA present.\nWhen looking at an electropherogram, it is possible to determine the number of contributors in less complex mixtures based on the number of peaks located in each locus. In comparison to a single source profile, which will only have one or two peaks at each locus, a mixture is when there are three or more peaks at two or more loci. If there are three peaks at only a single locus, then it is possible to have a single contributor who is tri-allelic at that locus. Two person mixtures will have between two and four peaks at each locus, and three person mixtures will have between three and six peaks at each locus. Mixtures become increasingly difficult to deconvolute as the number of contributors increases.\nAs detection methods in DNA profiling advance, forensic scientists are seeing more DNA samples that contain mixtures, as even the smallest contributor can now be detected by modern tests. The ease in which forensic scientists have in interpenetrating DNA mixtures largely depends on the ratio of DNA present from each individual, the genotype combinations, and the total amount of DNA amplified. The DNA ratio is often the most important aspect to look at in determining whether a mixture can be interpreted. For example, if a DNA sample had two contributors, it would be easy to interpret individual profiles if the ratio of DNA contributed by one person was much higher than the second person. When a sample has three or more contributors, it becomes extremely difficult to determine individual profiles. Fortunately, advancements in probabilistic genotyping may make that sort of determination possible in the future. Probabilistic genotyping uses complex computer software to run through thousands of mathematical computations to produce statistical likelihoods of individual genotypes found in a mixture.\nDNA profiling in plant:\nPlant DNA profiling (fingerprinting) is a method for identifying cultivars that uses molecular marker techniques. This method is gaining attention due to Trade Related Intellectual property rights (TRIPs) and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD).\nAdvantages of Plant DNA profiling:\nIdentification, authentication, specific distinction, detecting adulteration and identifying phytoconstituents are all possible with DNA fingerprinting in medical plants.\nDNA based markers are critical for these applications, determining the future of scientific study in pharmacognosy.\nIt also helps with determining the traits (such as seed size and leaf color) are likely to improve the offspring or not.\nDNA databases.\nAn early application of a DNA database was the compilation of a Mitochondrial DNA Concordance, prepared by Kevin W. P. Miller and John L. Dawson at the University of Cambridge from 1996 to 1999 from data collected as part of Miller's PhD thesis. There are now several DNA databases in existence around the world. Some are private, but most of the largest databases are government-controlled. The United States maintains the largest DNA database, with the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) holding over 13 million records as of May 2018. The United Kingdom maintains the National DNA Database (NDNAD), which is of similar size, despite the UK's smaller population. The size of this database, and its rate of growth, are giving concern to civil liberties groups in the UK, where police have wide-ranging powers to take samples and retain them even in the event of acquittal. The Conservative\u2013Liberal Democrat coalition partially addressed these concerns with part 1 of the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012, under which DNA samples must be deleted if suspects are acquitted or not charged, except in relation to certain (mostly serious or sexual) offenses. Public discourse around the introduction of advanced forensic techniques (such as genetic genealogy using public genealogy databases and DNA phenotyping approaches) has been limited, disjointed, unfocused, and raises issues of privacy and consent that may warrant the establishment of additional legal protections.\nThe U.S. Patriot Act of the United States provides a means for the U.S. government to get DNA samples from suspected terrorists. DNA information from crimes is collected and deposited into the CODIS database, which is maintained by the FBI. CODIS enables law enforcement officials to test DNA samples from crimes for matches within the database, providing a means of finding specific biological profiles associated with collected DNA evidence.\nWhen a match is made from a national DNA databank to link a crime scene to an offender having provided a DNA sample to a database, that link is often referred to as a \"cold hit\". A cold hit is of value in referring the police agency to a specific suspect but is of less evidential value than a DNA match made from outside the DNA Databank.\nFBI agents cannot legally store DNA of a person not convicted of a crime. DNA collected from a suspect not later convicted must be disposed of and not entered into the database. In 1998, a man residing in the UK was arrested on accusation of burglary. His DNA was taken and tested, and he was later released. Nine months later, this man's DNA was accidentally and illegally entered in the DNA database. New DNA is automatically compared to the DNA found at cold cases and, in this case, this man was found to be a match to DNA found at a rape and assault case one year earlier. The government then prosecuted him for these crimes. During the trial the DNA match was requested to be removed from the evidence because it had been illegally entered into the database. The request was carried out.\nThe DNA of the perpetrator, collected from victims of rape, can be stored for years until a match is found. In 2014, to address this problem, Congress extended a bill that helps states deal with \"a backlog\" of evidence.\nDNA profiling databases in Plants:\nPIDS:\nPIDS(Plant international DNA-fingerprinting system) is an open source web server and free software based plant international DNA fingerprinting system.\nIt manages huge amount of microsatellite DNA fingerprint data, performs genetic studies, and automates collection, storage and maintenance while decreasing human error and increasing efficiency.\nThe system may be tailored to specific laboratory needs, making it a valuable tool for plant breeders, forensic science, and human fingerprint recognition.\nIt keeps track of experiments, standardizes data and promotes inter-database communication.\nIt also helps with the regulation of variety quality, the preservation of variety rights and the use of molecular markers in breeding by providing location statistics, merging, comparison and genetic analysis function.\nConsiderations in evaluating DNA evidence.\nWhen using RFLP, the theoretical risk of a coincidental match is 1 in 100 billion (100,000,000,000) although the practical risk is actually 1 in 1,000 because monozygotic twins are 0.2% of the human population. Moreover, the rate of laboratory error is almost certainly higher than that and actual laboratory procedures often do not reflect the theory under which the coincidence probabilities were computed. For example, coincidence probabilities may be calculated based on the probabilities that markers in two samples have bands in \"precisely\" the same location, but a laboratory worker may conclude that similar but not precisely-identical band patterns result from identical genetic samples with some imperfection in the agarose gel. However, in that case, the laboratory worker increases the coincidence risk by expanding the criteria for declaring a match. Studies conducted in the 2000s quoted relatively-high error rates, which may be cause for concern. In the early days of genetic fingerprinting, the necessary population data to compute a match probability accurately was sometimes unavailable. Between 1992 and 1996, arbitrary-low ceilings were controversially put on match probabilities used in RFLP analysis, rather than the higher theoretically computed ones.\nEvidence of genetic relationship.\nIt is possible to use DNA profiling as evidence of genetic relationship although such evidence varies in strength from weak to positive. Testing that shows no relationship is absolutely certain. Further, while almost all individuals have a single and distinct set of genes, ultra-rare individuals, known as \"chimeras\", have at least two different sets of genes. There have been two cases of DNA profiling that falsely suggested that a mother was unrelated to her children.\nFake DNA evidence.\nThe functional analysis of genes and their coding sequences (open reading frames [ORFs]) typically requires that each ORF be expressed, the encoded protein purified, antibodies produced, phenotypes examined, intracellular localization determined, and interactions with other proteins sought. In a study conducted by the life science company Nucleix and published in the journal \"Forensic Science International\", scientists found that an in vitro synthesized sample of DNA matching any desired genetic profile can be constructed using standard molecular biology techniques without obtaining any actual tissue from that person.\nDNA evidence in criminal trials.\nFamilial DNA searching.\nFamilial DNA searching (sometimes referred to as \"familial DNA\" or \"familial DNA database searching\") is the practice of creating new investigative leads in cases where DNA evidence found at the scene of a crime (forensic profile) strongly resembles that of an existing DNA profile (offender profile) in a state DNA database but there is not an exact match. After all other leads have been exhausted, investigators may use specially developed software to compare the forensic profile to all profiles taken from a state's DNA database to generate a list of those offenders already in the database who are most likely to be a very close relative of the individual whose DNA is in the forensic profile.\nFamilial DNA database searching was first used in an investigation leading to the conviction of Jeffrey Gafoor of the murder of Lynette White in the United Kingdom on 4 July 2003. DNA evidence was matched to Gafoor's nephew, who at 14 years old had not been born at the time of the murder in 1988. It was used again in 2004 to find a man who threw a brick from a motorway bridge and hit a lorry driver, killing him. DNA found on the brick matched that found at the scene of a car theft earlier in the day, but there were no good matches on the national DNA database. A wider search found a partial match to an individual; on being questioned, this man revealed he had a brother, Craig Harman, who lived very close to the original crime scene. Harman voluntarily submitted a DNA sample, and confessed when it matched the sample from the brick. As of 2011, familial DNA database searching is not conducted on a national level in the United States, where states determine how and when to conduct familial searches. The first familial DNA search with a subsequent conviction in the United States was conducted in Denver, Colorado, in 2008, using software developed under the leadership of Denver District Attorney Mitch Morrissey and Denver Police Department Crime Lab Director Gregg LaBerge. California was the first state to implement a policy for familial searching under then-Attorney General Jerry Brown, who later became Governor. In his role as consultant to the Familial Search Working Group of the California Department of Justice, former Alameda County Prosecutor Rock Harmon is widely considered to have been the catalyst in the adoption of familial search technology in California. The technique was used to catch the Los Angeles serial killer known as the \"Grim Sleeper\" in 2010. It was not a witness or informant that tipped off law enforcement to the identity of the \"Grim Sleeper\" serial killer, who had eluded police for more than two decades, but DNA from the suspect's own son. The suspect's son had been arrested and convicted in a felony weapons charge and swabbed for DNA the year before. When his DNA was entered into the database of convicted felons, detectives were alerted to a partial match to evidence found at the \"Grim Sleeper\" crime scenes. David Franklin Jr., also known as the Grim Sleeper, was charged with ten counts of murder and one count of attempted murder. More recently, familial DNA led to the arrest of 21-year-old Elvis Garcia on charges of sexual assault and false imprisonment of a woman in Santa Cruz in 2008. In March 2011 Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell announced that Virginia would begin using familial DNA searches.\nAt a press conference in Virginia on 7 March 2011, regarding the East Coast Rapist, Prince William County prosecutor Paul Ebert and Fairfax County Police Detective John Kelly said the case would have been solved years ago if Virginia had used familial DNA searching. Aaron Thomas, the suspected East Coast Rapist, was arrested in connection with the rape of 17 women from Virginia to Rhode Island, but familial DNA was not used in the case.\nCritics of familial DNA database searches argue that the technique is an invasion of an individual's 4th Amendment rights. Privacy advocates are petitioning for DNA database restrictions, arguing that the only fair way to search for possible DNA matches to relatives of offenders or arrestees would be to have a population-wide DNA database. Some scholars have pointed out that the privacy concerns surrounding familial searching are similar in some respects to other police search techniques, and most have concluded that the practice is constitutional. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in \"United States v. Pool\" (vacated as moot) suggested that this practice is somewhat analogous to a witness looking at a photograph of one person and stating that it looked like the perpetrator, which leads law enforcement to show the witness photos of similar looking individuals, one of whom is identified as the perpetrator.\nCritics also state that racial profiling could occur on account of familial DNA testing. In the United States, the conviction rates of racial minorities are much higher than that of the overall population. It is unclear whether this is due to discrimination from police officers and the courts, as opposed to a simple higher rate of offence among minorities. Arrest-based databases, which are found in the majority of the United States, lead to an even greater level of racial discrimination. An arrest, as opposed to conviction, relies much more heavily on police discretion.\nFor instance, investigators with Denver District Attorney's Office successfully identified a suspect in a property theft case using a familial DNA search. In this example, the suspect's blood left at the scene of the crime strongly resembled that of a current Colorado Department of Corrections prisoner.\nPartial matches.\nPartial DNA matches are the result of moderate stringency CODIS searches that produce a potential match that shares at least one allele at every locus. Partial matching does not involve the use of familial search software, such as those used in the United Kingdom and the United States, or additional Y-STR analysis and therefore often misses sibling relationships. Partial matching has been used to identify suspects in several cases in both countries and has also been used as a tool to exonerate the falsely accused. Darryl Hunt was wrongly convicted in connection with the rape and the murder of a young woman in 1984 in North Carolina.\nSurreptitious DNA collecting.\nPolice forces may collect DNA samples without a suspect's knowledge, and use it as evidence. The legality of the practice has been questioned in Australia.\nIn the United States, where it has been accepted, courts often rule that there is no expectation of privacy and cite \"California v. Greenwood\" (1988), in which the Supreme Court held that the Fourth Amendment does not prohibit the warrantless search and seizure of garbage left for collection outside the curtilage of a home. Critics of this practice underline that this analogy ignores that \"most people have no idea that they risk surrendering their genetic identity to the police by, for instance, failing to destroy a used coffee cup. Moreover, even if they do realize it, there is no way to avoid abandoning one's DNA in public.\"\nThe United States Supreme Court ruled in \"Maryland v. King\" (2013) that DNA sampling of prisoners arrested for serious crimes is constitutional.\nIn the United Kingdom, the \"Human Tissue Act 2004\" prohibits private individuals from covertly collecting biological samples (hair, fingernails, etc.) for DNA analysis but exempts medical and criminal investigations from the prohibition.\nEngland and Wales.\nEvidence from an expert who has compared DNA samples must be accompanied by evidence as to the sources of the samples and the procedures for obtaining the DNA profiles. The judge must ensure that the jury must understand the significance of DNA matches and mismatches in the profiles. The judge must also ensure that the jury does not confuse the match probability (the probability that a person that is chosen at random has a matching DNA profile to the sample from the scene) with the probability that a person with matching DNA committed the crime. In 1996 \"R v. Doheny\"\nJuries should weigh up conflicting and corroborative evidence, using their own common sense and not by using mathematical formulae, such as Bayes' theorem, so as to avoid \"confusion, misunderstanding and misjudgment\".\nPresentation and evaluation of evidence of partial or incomplete DNA profiles.\nIn \"R v Bates\", Moore-Bick LJ said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We can see no reason why partial profile DNA evidence should not be admissible provided that the jury are made aware of its inherent limitations and are given a sufficient explanation to enable them to evaluate it. There may be cases where the match probability in relation to all the samples tested is so great that the judge would consider its probative value to be minimal and decide to exclude the evidence in the exercise of his discretion, but this gives rise to no new question of principle and can be left for decision on a case by case basis. However, the fact that there exists in the case of all partial profile evidence the possibility that a \"missing\" allele might exculpate the accused altogether does not provide sufficient grounds for rejecting such evidence. In many there is a possibility (at least in theory) that evidence that would assist the accused and perhaps even exculpate him altogether exists, but that does not provide grounds for excluding relevant evidence that is available and otherwise admissible, though it does make it important to ensure that the jury are given sufficient information to enable them to evaluate that evidence properly.\nDNA testing in the United States.\nThere are state laws on DNA profiling in all 50 states of the United States. Detailed information on database laws in each state can be found at the National Conference of State Legislatures website.\nDevelopment of artificial DNA.\nIn August 2009, scientists in Israel raised serious doubts concerning the use of DNA by law enforcement as the ultimate method of identification. In a paper published in the journal \"Forensic Science International: Genetics\", the Israeli researchers demonstrated that it is possible to manufacture DNA in a laboratory, thus falsifying DNA evidence. The scientists fabricated saliva and blood samples, which originally contained DNA from a person other than the supposed donor of the blood and saliva.\nThe researchers also showed that, using a DNA database, it is possible to take information from a profile and manufacture DNA to match it, and that this can be done without access to any actual DNA from the person whose DNA they are duplicating. The synthetic DNA oligos required for the procedure are common in molecular laboratories.\n\"The New York Times\" quoted the lead author, Daniel Frumkin, saying, \"You can just engineer a crime scene ... any biology undergraduate could perform this\". Frumkin perfected a test that can differentiate real DNA samples from fake ones. His test detects epigenetic modifications, in particular, DNA methylation. Seventy percent of the DNA in any human genome is methylated, meaning it contains methyl group modifications within a CpG dinucleotide context. Methylation at the promoter region is associated with gene silencing. The synthetic DNA lacks this epigenetic modification, which allows the test to distinguish manufactured DNA from genuine DNA.\nIt is unknown how many police departments, if any, currently use the test. No police lab has publicly announced that it is using the new test to verify DNA results.\nResearchers at the University of Tokyo integrated an artificial DNA replication scheme with a rebuilt gene expression system and micro-compartmentalization utilizing cell-free materials alone for the first time. Multiple cycles of serial dilution were performed on a system contained in microscale water-in-oil droplets.\nChances of making DNA change on purpose\nOverall, this study's artificial genomic DNA, which kept copying itself using self-encoded proteins and made its sequence better on its own, is a good starting point for making more complex artificial cells. By adding the genes needed for transcription and translation to artificial genomic DNA, it may be possible in the future to make artificial cells that can grow on their own when fed small molecules like amino acids and nucleotides. Using living organisms to make useful things, like drugs and food, would be more stable and easier to control in these artificial cells.\nOn July 7, 2008, the American chemical society reported that Japanese chemists have created the world's first DNA molecule comprised nearly completely of synthetic components.\nA nano-particle based artificial transcription factor for gene regulation:\nNano Script is a nanoparticle-based artificial transcription factor that is supposed to replicate the structure and function of TFs. On gold nanoparticles, functional peptides and tiny molecules referred to as synthetic transcription factors, which imitate the various TF domains, were attached to create Nano Script. We show that Nano Script localizes to the nucleus and begins transcription of a reporter plasmid by an amount more than 15-fold. Moreover, Nano Script can successfully transcribe targeted genes onto endogenous DNA in a nonviral manner.\nThree different fluorophores\u2014red, green, and blue\u2014were carefully fixed on the DNA rod surface to provide spatial information and create a nanoscale barcode. Epifluorescence and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy reliably deciphered spatial information between fluorophores. By moving the three fluorophores on the DNA rod, this nanoscale barcode created 216 fluorescence patterns.\nDNA evidence as evidence to prove rights of succession to British titles.\nDNA testing has been used to establish the right of succession to British titles.\nCases:\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In 1994, he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for services to genetics.\nEarly life and education.\nJeffreys was born into a middle-class family in Oxford, where he spent the first six years of his life until 1956 when the family moved to Luton, Bedfordshire. He says he inherited his curiosity and inventiveness from his father and paternal grandfather, who held a number of patents. When he was eight, his father gave him a chemistry set, which he enhanced over the next few years with extra chemicals, even including a small bottle of sulphuric acid. He says he liked making small explosions, but an accidental splash of the sulphuric acid caused a burn, which left a permanent scar on his chin (now under his beard). His father also bought him a Victorian-era brass microscope, which he used to examine biological specimens. At about 12, he made a small dissecting kit (including a scalpel, crafted from a flattened pin) which he used to dissect a bumblebee, but he got into trouble with his parents when he progressed to dissecting a larger specimen. One Sunday morning he found a deceased cat on the road while doing his paper round and took it home in his bag. He relates that he started to dissect it on the dining room table before Sunday lunch, causing a foul smell throughout the house after he ruptured its intestines.\nJeffreys was a pupil at Luton Grammar School and then Luton Sixth Form College. He won a scholarship to study at the University of Oxford as an undergraduate of Merton College, Oxford on a four-year course, where he graduated in 1971 with first-class honours in biochemistry. Jeffreys completed his Doctor of Philosophy degree on the mitochondria of cultured mammalian cells, working in the genetics laboratory.\nCareer and research.\nAfter finishing his doctorate, he moved to the University of Amsterdam, where he worked on mammalian genes as a research fellow, and then to the University of Leicester in 1977, where in 1984 he discovered a method of showing variations between individuals' DNA, inventing and developing genetic fingerprinting.\nGenetic fingerprinting.\nJeffreys says he had a \"eureka moment\" in his lab in Leicester after looking at the X-ray film image of a DNA experiment on 10 September 1984, which unexpectedly showed both similarities and differences between the DNA of different members of his technician's family. Within about half an hour, he continued, he realised the possible scope of DNA fingerprinting, which uses variations in the genetic information to identify individuals. The method has become important in forensic science to assist police detective work, and it has also proved useful in resolving paternity and immigration disputes. The method can also be applied to non-human species, for example in wildlife population genetics studies. Before his methods were commercialised in 1987, his laboratory was the only centre in the world that carried out DNA fingerprinting, and was consequently very busy, receiving inquiries from all over the globe.\nJeffreys's DNA method was first put to use in 1985 when he was asked to help in a disputed immigration case to confirm the identity of a British boy whose family was originally from Ghana. The case was resolved when the DNA results proved that the boy was closely related to the other members of the family, and Jeffreys saw the relief in the mother's face when she heard the results. DNA fingerprinting was first used in a police forensic test to identify the killer of two teenagers, Lynda Mann and Dawn Ashworth, who had been raped and murdered in Narborough, Leicestershire, in 1983 and 1986 respectively. Colin Pitchfork was identified and convicted of their murders after samples taken from him matched semen samples taken from the two dead girls. This turned out to be a specifically important identification; British authorities believe that without it an innocent man would have inevitably been convicted. Not only did Jeffreys' work, in this case, prove who the real killer was, but it exonerated Richard Buckland, initially a prime suspect, who likely would have spent his life in prison otherwise. The story behind the investigations is told in Joseph Wambaugh's 1989 best-selling book \"The Blooding: The True Story of the Narborough Village Murders\" and the murders and subsequent solving of the crimes was featured in Episode 4 of the first season of the 1996 American TV series \"Medical Detectives\" in which Jeffreys himself also appears. A further television mini-series based on these events was released in 2015, \"Code of a Killer\". In 1992, Jeffreys's methods were used to confirm the identity for German prosecutors of the body of Josef Mengele, who had died in 1979, by comparing DNA obtained from a femur bone of his exhumed skeleton, with DNA from his mother and son, in a similar way to paternity testing.\nDNA profiling.\nDNA profiling, based on typing individual highly variable minisatellites in the human genome, was also developed by Alec Jeffreys and his team in 1985, with the term (DNA fingerprinting) being retained for the initial test that types many minisatellites simultaneously. By focusing on just a few of these highly variable minisatellites, DNA profiling made the system more sensitive, more reproducible and amenable to computer databases. It soon became the standard forensic DNA system used in criminal case work and paternity testing worldwide.\nThe development of DNA amplification by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) opened up new approaches to forensic DNA testing, allowing automation, greatly increased sensitivity, and a move to alternative marker systems. The most commonly used markers are now variable microsatellites, also known as short tandem repeats (STRs), which Jeffreys first exploited in 1990 in the Mengele case. STR profiling was further refined by a team of scientists led by Peter Gill at the Forensic Science Service in the 1990s, allowing the launch of the UK National DNA Database (NDNAD) in 1995. With highly automated and sophisticated equipment, modern-day DNA profiling can process hundreds of samples each day. Sixteen microsatellites, plus a marker for sex determination, are used with the current system developed for the NDNAD, giving a discrimination power of one in over a billion. Under British law, anyone arrested in England, Wales or Northern Ireland has their DNA profile taken and stored on the database whether or not they are convicted (different rules apply in Scotland). The national database in 2020 contained the DNA information of about 5.6 million people. Jeffreys has opposed the current use of DNA profiling, where the government has access to that database, and has instead proposed a database of all people's DNA, access to which would be controlled by an independent third party.\nHis former doctoral students include Turi King.\nAwards and honours.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPersonal life.\nJeffreys met his future wife, Sue Miles, in a youth club in the centre of Luton, Bedfordshire, before he became a university student, and they married on 28 August 1971. Jeffreys has one brother and one sister; he and his wife have two daughters, born in 1979 and 1983.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Located on the eastern shore of the Black Sea, about north of the Georgia\u2013Turkey border, Batumi lies at the foot of the Caucasus Mountains in a humid subtropical zone. As one of the country\u2019s principal urban centers, it serves as a major seaport, commercial hub, and cultural gateway between Europe and Asia.\nThe city has played a significant role in the history of the south-eastern Black Sea region due to its deep-water harbor and strategic position along regional trade routes. Over the centuries, Batumi has been ruled by the Kingdom of Georgia, the Ottoman Empire, the Russian Empire, and the Soviet Union, each leaving distinct cultural and architectural imprints. Its economy historically relied on maritime trade and oil transit, particularly following the construction of the Baku\u2013Batumi pipeline in the early 20th century. Today, it remains a key transit point for Caspian energy exports and regional commerce.\nSince the early 2000s, Batumi has undergone rapid modernization, with large-scale investments in tourism, high-rise development, and transport infrastructure. It is often referred to as the \u201cLas Vegas of the Black Sea\u201d for its gambling industry, modern hotels, and nightlife, while also being known for restored 19th-century architecture and public spaces. As of 2025, the city has a population of about 187,000 and hosts major cultural events, educational institutions, and one of Georgia\u2019s busiest ports, making it both a leading tourist destination and a vital economic center in the South Caucasus.\nHistory.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTimeline of Batumi \n\u00a0Lazica (to 780)\n Kingdom of Abkhazia, 780\u20131010\n Kingdom of Georgia, 1010\u20131455\n Kingdom of Imereti 1455\u20131703\n Ottoman Empire, 1703\u20131878\n Russian Empire, 1878\u20131918\n British Empire, 1918\u20131920\n Dem.

Archaeological excavations at Pichvnari conducted by the Batumi Archaeological Museum alongside the University of Oxford indicate that the Adjara region was inhabited as early as the 5th century BC, with imported amphorae and other evidence of Greek maritime presence. The ancient settlement is commonly identified with the Greek trading post known as Bathus or Bathys (Greek: , bathys lim\u0113n, \u201cdeep harbor\u201d), a toponym recorded in classical sources. During the reign of Hadrian (c. 117\u2013138 AD), the area featured a Roman fortification. In the 6th century, the Byzantine Empire redirected its regional military focus to the fortress of Petra (modern Tsikhisdziri), reducing Batumi\u2019s strategic importance.\nMedieval Georgian principalities.\nAfter the fragmentation of the Kingdom of Georgia, the area came under the rule of the Princes of Guria. In the 15th\u201316th centuries, Batumi was intermittently occupied by the Ottoman Empire. Following the Battle of Sokhoista (1545), it fell under Ottoman control.\nOttoman rule (15th\u201319th centuries).\nIn the 15th century, during the reign of Prince Kakhaber Gurieli, the Ottoman Empire briefly seized Batumi and its surrounding district but failed to maintain control. A century later, the Ottomans returned with a stronger military presence, inflicting a decisive defeat on Georgian forces at the Battle of Sokhoista in 1545. Batumi subsequently changed hands several times: it was retaken in 1546 by Prince Rostom Gurieli, lost soon afterwards, and again reclaimed in 1609 by Mamia II Gurieli.\nIn 1703, Batumi was permanently incorporated into the Ottoman Empire as part of the Sanjak of Lazistan. Over the next century and a half, it developed into a small but active provincial port serving the empire\u2019s eastern Black Sea hinterland, facilitating trade in timber, tobacco, and other regional products.\nFollowing the Ottoman conquest, a sustained campaign of Islamization began among the predominantly Christian Georgian population of the region. While conversion rates varied by community, this process significantly altered Adjara's demographic and cultural profile. The Islamization trend was halted and in part reversed after Batumi and Adjara were annexed by the Russian Empire following the Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878).\nRussian Imperial era (1878\u20131918).\nBatumi was the last major Black Sea port to be annexed by the Russian Empire during its conquest of the Caucasian Black Sea coast. Under the terms of the Treaty of San Stefano (ratified 23 March 1878), signed between Russia and the Ottoman Empire following the Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878), Batumi was ceded to Russia and formally occupied on 28 August 1878. It was declared a free port (*porto franco*) until 1886 to encourage trade and foreign investment. Initially functioning as the center of a special military district, it was incorporated into the Kutaisi Governorate on 12 June 1883. On 1 June 1903, together with the Artvin Okrug, Batumi was reorganized as the Batum Oblast under the direct administration of the Viceroy of the Caucasus.\nBatumi\u2019s expansion accelerated with major infrastructure projects: the completion of the Batumi\u2013Tiflis\u2013Baku railway in 1883 and the opening of the Baku\u2013Batumi pipeline in 1907. These developments turned Batumi into the chief Russian oil port on the Black Sea. The city\u2019s population doubled within two decades, rising from 8,671 in 1882 to 12,000 in 1889, and by 1902 reached around 16,000, including about 1,000 employed in the oil refinery of Baron Rothschild\u2019s Caspian and Black Sea Oil Company.\nIn the late 1880s and 1890s, Batumi became the departure point for over 7,400 Doukhobor emigrants bound for Canada, following an agreement with the imperial government allowing their resettlement abroad. The Doukhobors, a pacifist religious minority opposed to military service, received financial and logistical assistance from Quaker and Tolstoyan supporters for the transatlantic journey. Most were eventually settled in Manitoba and Saskatchewan.\nBritish occupation and the Democratic Republic of Georgia (1918\u20131921).\nFollowing the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in March 1918, the Ottoman Empire advanced into southwestern Georgia, occupying Batumi in April 1918. The short-lived Treaty of Batum (4 June 1918) formalized Ottoman control over the city and surrounding district, though the Armistice of Mudros in October 1918 forced Ottoman withdrawal.\nIn December 1918, British Army forces under General William M. Thomson occupied Batumi as part of the Allied intervention in the Caucasus, citing the need to secure the port and the Baku\u2013Batumi pipeline in the aftermath of the Russian Civil War. The British administered the city as a strategic base for regional operations, maintaining a garrison of several thousand troops.\nFacing growing Georgian nationalist pressure and changing strategic priorities, Britain transferred control of Batumi to the Democratic Republic of Georgia on 7 July 1920, under an agreement recognizing Georgian sovereignty while allowing temporary Allied access to port facilities. The handover was part of a broader British withdrawal from the Caucasus as post-war demobilization took effect.\nSoviet era (1921\u20131991).\nIn March 1921, during the final stages of the Red Army invasion of Georgia, Turkish troops briefly occupied Batumi under the pretext of protecting the local Muslim population. Following a short period of Georgian control, the city was transferred to the Soviet Union in accordance with the Treaty of Kars (October 1921), which confirmed Turkish recognition of Soviet sovereignty over Batumi and the surrounding Adjara region in exchange for border adjustments in northeastern Turkey.\nTo address the distinct religious and cultural composition of the local population, the Soviets established the Adjarian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic on 16 July 1921, granting nominal autonomy within the Georgian SSR to Adjara\u2019s predominantly Muslim community.\nThroughout the Soviet period, Batumi underwent significant transformation. The port was expanded and modernized, becoming a key hub for Black Sea trade, particularly for oil exports from the Baku\u2013Batumi pipeline. Industrialization brought new factories, ship-repair facilities, and food-processing plants, while Soviet urban planning introduced wide boulevards, parks, and standardized residential districts.\nIn addition to its industrial role, Batumi developed as a resort destination for Soviet citizens, with new hotels, sanatoriums, and a revitalized seaside promenade attracting tourists from across the USSR. The city\u2019s population steadily grew due to internal migration, reflecting its dual role as both a working port and a leisure center on the Black Sea coast.\nPost-independence (1991\u2013present).\nFollowing Georgia\u2019s declaration of independence in April 1991, Adjara remained part of the country but developed into a semi-autonomous region under the de facto control of regional leader Aslan Abashidze. Abashidze consolidated power by maintaining his own security forces, controlling customs revenues from the port, and limiting the influence of the central government in Tbilisi.\nTensions with the Georgian government escalated in early 2004, following the Rose Revolution, as President Mikheil Saakashvili sought to reassert central authority over Adjara. Mass protests in Batumi and surrounding towns in May 2004 combined with the defection of key security officials forced Abashidze to resign and flee to Russia on 6 May 2004. The region was then reintegrated into Georgia\u2019s political and administrative framework.\nSince 2004, Batumi has undergone significant transformation, driven by foreign investment, large-scale urban redevelopment, and government-backed infrastructure projects. The city has emerged as a major tourism hub on the Black Sea, with the construction of modern hotels, a renovated seaside boulevard, and cultural venues aimed at attracting international visitors.Parallel to the tourism boom, the Port of Batumi has been modernized to handle increased cargo traffic, reinforcing its role as a strategic transit point for Caspian oil and regional trade. Ongoing projects include port deepening, new ferry terminals, and expanded logistics facilities, positioning Batumi as both a leisure destination and a commercial gateway in the South Caucasus.\nGeography.\nClimate.\nBatumi has a humid subtropical climate (\"Cfa\") according to K\u00f6ppen's classification. The city's climate is heavily influenced by the onshore flow from the Black Sea and is subject to the orographic effect of the nearby hills and mountains, resulting in significant rainfall throughout most of the year, making Batumi the wettest city in both Georgia and the entire Caucasus Region.\nThe average annual temperature in Batumi is approximately . January is the coldest month with an average temperature of . August is the hottest month, with an average temperature of . The absolute minimum recorded temperature is , and the absolute maximum is . The number of days with daily temperatures above is 239. The city receives 1958 hours of sunshine per year.\nBatumi's average annual precipitation is . November is the wettest month with an average of of precipitation, while May is the driest, averaging . Batumi receives snow most years, but it is often limited in amount (accumulating snowfall of more than is rare), and the number of days with snow cover for the year is 12. The average level of relative humidity ranges from 70 to 80%.\nSubdivisions.\nAccording to the 31 March 2008, decision of the Batumi City Council, Batumi is divided into seven boroughs, those of:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCityscape.\nContemporary architecture.\nBatumi's skyline has been transformed since 2007 with remarkable buildings and monuments of contemporary architecture, including:\nA large Kempinski hotel and casino is to open in 2013, a Hilton Hotel as well as a 47-storey Trump Tower is also planned.\nAlliance Privilege, a building compromising Marriott Hotel, Casino and serviced apartments is one of the contemporary buildings with unique architecture by the beach.\nNovelty architecture.\nNovelty architecture in Batumi includes:\nSites of interest.\nMain sights.\nAttractions include\nTourist attractions.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nDemographics.\nReligion.\nOf the 4,970 inhabitants in 1872, about 4,500 were Muslim (Adjarians, Turks, Circassians, and Abkhazians). In the 1897 census, the Orthodox Christian population was 15,495 (mostly Slavs) while Muslims numbered 3,156, including some of whom were citizens of Turkey.\nAs of 2014, out of 152,839 inhabitants of Batumi, 68,7% is Eastern Orthodox Christian, and they primarily adhere to the national Georgian Orthodox Church. Muslims make up 25,3% of population, while there are also Catholic, Armenian Apostolic, Jehovah's Witness, Seventh-day Adventist, and Jewish communities.\nThe main places of worship in the city are:\nCulture.\nBatumi has 18 various museums, including State Art Museum of Adjara. Rugby Union club Batumi RC competes in the Georgian Didi 10 and previously competed in the Pan-European Rugby Europe Super Cup. Football club FC Dinamo Batumi play at the Batumi stadium.\nA sculpture by Tamara Kvesitadze of two standing figures on the seashore shows the story first told in the 1937 Austrian novel, Ali and Nino, of lovers who are parted after World War I. Each day, the two figures move toward each other but never stay together. Ali, an Azerbaijani Muslim, falls in love with Georgian princess, Nino, but sadly, after they are finally able to get together, the war hits home and Ali is killed.

Batumi has modern electric buses. Using the service is possible by \"BATUMICARD\", transit card, or debit/credit cards. Buses connect almost everywhere in the city. A bike-sharing system named \"BatumVelo\" allows you to rent a bicycle on the street with a smart card.\nThe port of Batumi is on one of the routes of China's proposed Eurasian Land Bridge (part of the \"New Silk Road\"), which would see an eastern freight link to China via Azerbaijan and the Caspian Sea, and a western link by ferry to Ukraine and on to Europe.\nEducation.\nBatumi has become an emerging centre for medical education in the Caucasus region, attracting international students due to its affordable tuition and English-language programs. Institutions such as Batumi Shota Rustaveli State University, BAU International University offer accredited medical degrees recognized across America, Europe and Asia.\nThe city\u2019s growth in medical education is supported by modern infrastructure and increasing foreign enrollment.

It runs southeast along the Bohemian Forest and then north across Bohemia, through \u010cesk\u00fd Krumlov, \u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice, and Prague. It is commonly referred to as the \"Czech national river\".\nEtymology.\nBoth the Czech name ' and the German name ' are believed to originate from the old Germanic words ' 'wild water' (compare Latin '). In the ' (872 AD) it is called '; from 1113 AD it is attested as '. In the ' (1125\u00a0AD) it is attested for the first time in its Bohemian form, \"\". \nCourse.\nThe Vltava originates by a confluence of two rivers, the Tepl\u00e1 Vltava, which is longer, and the Studen\u00e1 Vltava, originating in Bavaria. From a water management point of view, the Vltava and Tepl\u00e1 Vltava are one river with single numbering of river kilometres. The Tepl\u00e1 Vltava originates in the territory of Kvilda in the Bohemian Forest at an elevation of , on the slope of the \u010cern\u00e1 hora mountain. Together with the Tepl\u00e1 Vltava, the Vltava is long. Without the Tepl\u00e1 Vltava, the Vltava is long.

The height difference from source to mouth is .\nThe Vltava River drains an area of in size, over half of Bohemia and about a third of the Czech Republic's entire territory. The waters ultimately drain to the North Sea.\nAs it runs through Prague, the river is crossed by 18 bridges (including the Charles Bridge) and covers within the city. The water from the river was used for drinking until 1912 when the Vinohrady Water Tower ceased pumping operations, and is now a place to view the city. It is, however, the source of drinking water in case of failures of or repairs to the water supply from the \u017delivka and K\u00e1ran\u00e9 sources. The Podol\u00ed water processing plant is on standby for such cases with the long section of the river upstream of the Podol\u00ed plant under the stricter, second degree of pollution prevention regulations.\nAlong its course, the river receives many tributaries. The longest tributaries of the Vltava are:\nFrom a strict hydrological point of view, it is the Elbe upstream of M\u011bln\u00edk that is a tributary of the Vltava rather than the other way around, owing to the Vltava's longer distance upstream ( against of the Elbe), greater discharge, and larger drainage basin; however, since at the confluence point the Elbe flows through the main valley in a straight line, relative to which the Vltava flows at a right angle, the combined river downstream is identified as the Elbe.\nNavigation.\nBetween the confluence with the Elbe at M\u011bln\u00edk and Prague, the river is navigable by vessels of up to displacement. Most of the river upstream of Prague as far as \u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice is navigable by craft of up to displacement, but such vessels cannot pass the dams at Orl\u00edk and Slapy, and are also restricted by a low bridge at T\u00fdn nad Vltavou. Work is planned to complete boat lifts, planned for but never completed, at the two dams, and to rebuild the bridge, in order for them to navigate throughout. Much smaller craft, of up to displacement and under beam and air draft, can avoid these obstacles.\nUpstream of \u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice, the river's section around \u010cesk\u00fd Krumlov (specifically from Vy\u0161\u0161\u00ed Brod to Bor\u0161ov nad Vltavou) is a very popular destination for water tourism.\nDams.\nNine hydroelectric dams have been built on the Vltava south of Prague to regulate the water flow and generate hydroelectric power, starting in the 1930s. Beginning at the headwaters, these are: Lipno, Lipno II, Hn\u011bvkovice, Ko\u0159ensko, Orl\u00edk, Kam\u00fdk, Slapy, \u0160t\u011bchovice and Vran\u00e9. The Orl\u00edk Reservoir supports the largest reservoir on the Vltava by volume, while the Lipno Reservoir retains the largest reservoir by area. The \u0160t\u011bchovice Reservoir is built over the site of St John's Rapids.\nThe river also features numerous weirs that help mitigate its flow from in elevation at its source near the German border to at its mouth in M\u011bln\u00edk.\nFloods.\nThe Vltava basin has flooded multiple times throughout recorded history. Markers have been created along the banks denoting the water line for notable floods in 1784, 1845, 1890, 1940, and the highest of all in 2002.\nIn August of 2002, the basin was heavily affected by the 2002 European floods when the flooded river killed several people and caused massive damage and disruption along its length, including in Prague. It left the oldest bridge in Prague, Charles Bridge, seriously weakened, requiring years of work to repair.\nPrague was again flooded in 2013. Many locations within the Vltava and Elbe basins were left under water, including the Prague Zoo, but metal barriers were erected along the banks of the Vltava to help protect the historic city centre.\nReferences in culture and science.\nIn the classic narrative of the golem in Jewish folklore, the mystic Judah Loew ben Bezalel made the artificial giant \"out of clay from the banks of the Vltava River and brought it to life through rituals and Hebrew incantations to defend the Prague ghetto from antisemitic attacks and pogroms.\"\nOne of the best-known works of classical music by a Czech composer is Bed\u0159ich Smetana's \"Vltava\", sometimes called \"The Moldau\" in English. It is from the Romantic era of classical music and is a musical description of the river's course through Bohemia.\nSmetana's symphonic poem also inspired a song of the same name by Bertolt Brecht. An English version of it, by John Willett, features the lyrics \"Deep down in the Moldau the pebbles are shifting\" / \"In Prague three dead emperors moulder away.\"\nThe Vltava River has been used as the setting for a number of films, including the 1942 Czech drama \"The Great Dam\". More recently, the Vltava has been used as a film location for such films as \"Amadeus\" in 1984 and \"\" in 1996. The river also appeared in the 2002 film \"xXx\". During filming, Vin Diesel's stunt double, Harry O'Connor, was tragically killed when he parasailed into the Palack\u00fd Bridge while filming an action sequence.\nA minor planet, 2123 Vltava, discovered in 1973 by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Stepanovich Chernykh, is named after the river.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is considered a granitoid. Some syenites contain larger proportions of mafic components and smaller amounts of felsic material than most granites; those are classed as being of intermediate composition.\nThe extrusive equivalent of syenite is trachyte.\nComposition.\nThe feldspar component of syenite is predominantly alkaline in character (usually orthoclase). Plagioclase feldspars may be present in small proportions, between 10% and 35% of the feldspar content. Such feldspars often are interleaved as perthitic components of the rock.\nWhen ferromagnesian minerals are present in syenite at all, they usually occur in the form of amphibole (typically hornblende) and clinopyroxene. Biotite is rare, because in a syenite magma the formation of feldspar consumes nearly all the aluminium. However less Al-rich phyllosilicates may be included, such as annite.\nOther common accessory minerals are apatite, titanite, zircon and other opaques.\nMost syenites are either peralkaline with high proportions of alkali elements relative to aluminum, or peraluminous with a higher concentration of aluminum relative to alkali (predominantly K and Na) and earth-alkali (predominantly Ca) elements.\nFormation.\nPartial melting.\nSyenites are products of alkaline igneous activity, generally formed in thick continental crustal areas, or in Cordilleran subduction zones. The formation of syenites can be theorized to be from the melt of granitic or igneous protolith to a fairly low degree of partial melting. This is required because potassium is an incompatible element and tends to enter a melt first, whereas higher degrees of partial melting will liberate more calcium and sodium, which produce plagioclase, and hence a granite, granodiorite or tonalite.\nAt very low degrees of partial melting a silica undersaturated melt is produced, forming a nepheline syenite, where orthoclase is replaced by a feldspathoid such as leucite, nepheline or analcime.\nConversely in certain conditions, large volumes of anorthite crystals may precipitate from thoroughly molten magma in a cumulate process as it cools. This leaves a drastically reduced concentration of silica in the remainder of the melt. The segregation of the silica from the melt leaves it in a state that may favour syenite formation.\nFractional crystallization.\nSome syenites are also theorized to be the product of the fractional crystallization of basaltic magmas.\nOccurrence.\nSyenite is not a common rock. Regions where it occurs in significant quantities include the following.\nEtymology.\nThe term \"syenite\" was originally applied to hornblende granite like that of Syene (now Aswan) in Egypt, from which the name is derived.\nEpisyenite.\nEpisyenite (or \"epi-syenite\") is a term used in petrology to describe veins, pods, or lenses of rock originally rich in silicon dioxide (SiO2) from which quartz has been severely depleted. This is often accompanied by strong enrichment in potassium and rare earth elements, leaving the altered rock a distinctive brick red color, or by albitization (enrichment in sodium), leaving the altered rock a conspicuous white color.\nEpisyenites are heterogenous in their properties, but all have experienced nearly complete disappearance of quartz at sub-solidus temperatures; that is, at temperatures below the melting point of the host rock. The formation of episyenites (\"episyenitization\") typically takes place through leaching of quartz by mildly saline hydrothermal fluids, typically near a cooling intrusion. Because episyenitization usually takes place in granitoid rock and usually involves alkaline metasomatism (addition of alkali metal oxides to the rock) the result is a rock that has the mineral composition of an igneous syenite.\nIn addition to rare earth elements, episyenites may be important sources of uranium and other valuable metals.\nNotable occurrences of episyenite are found in the Central Iberian Massif of Spain, in Cambrian to Ordovician beds of New Mexico and Colorado, Scandinavia, Brazil, and Ukraine.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Most organisms have some junk DNA in their genomes\u2014mostly pseudogenes and fragments of transposons and viruses\u2014but it is possible that some organisms have substantial amounts of junk DNA.\nAll protein-coding regions are generally considered to be functional elements in genomes. Additionally, non-protein coding regions such as genes for ribosomal RNA and transfer RNA, regulatory sequences, origins of replication, centromeres, telomeres, and scaffold attachment regions are considered as functional elements. (See Non-coding DNA for more information.)\nIt is difficult to determine whether other regions of the genome are functional or nonfunctional. There is considerable controversy over which criteria should be used to identify function. Many scientists have an evolutionary view of the genome and they prefer criteria based on whether DNA sequences are preserved by natural selection. Other scientists dispute this view or have different interpretations of the data.\nHistory.\nThe idea that only a fraction of the human genome could be functional dates back to the late 1940s. The estimated mutation rate in humans suggested that if a large fraction of those mutations were deleterious then the human species could not survive such a mutation load (genetic load). This led to predictions in the late 1940s by one of the founders of population genetics, J.B.S. Haldane, and by Nobel laureate Hermann Muller, that only a small percentage of the human genome contains functional DNA elements (genes) that can be destroyed by mutation. (see Genetic load for more information)\nIn 1966 Muller reviewed these predictions and concluded that the human genome could only contain about 30,000 genes based on the number of deleterious mutations that the species could tolerate. Similar predictions were made by other leading experts in molecular evolution who concluded that the human genome could not contain more than 40,000 genes and that less than 10% of the genome was functional.\nThe size of genomes in various species was known to vary considerably and there did not seem to be a correlation between genome size and the complexity of the species. Even closely related species could have very different genome sizes. This observation led to what came to be known as the C-value paradox. The paradox was resolved with the discovery of repetitive DNA and the observation that most of the differences in genome size could be attributed to repetitive DNA. Some scientists thought that most of the repetitive DNA was involved in regulating gene expression but many scientists thought that the excess repetitive DNA was nonfunctional.\nAt about the same time (late 1960s) the newly developed technique of C0t analysis was refined to include RNA:DNA hybridization leading to the discovery that considerably less than 10% of the human genome was complementary to mRNA and this DNA was in the unique (non-repetitive) fraction. This confirmed the predictions made from genetic load arguments and was consistent with the idea that much of the repetitive DNA is nonfunctional.\nThe idea that large amounts of eukaryotic genomes could be nonfunctional conflicted with the prevailing view of evolution in 1968 since it seemed likely that nonfunctional DNA would be eliminated by natural selection. The development of the neutral theory and the nearly neutral theory provided a way out of this problem since it allowed for the preservation of slightly deleterious nonfunctional DNA in accordance with fundamental principles of population genetics.\nThe term \"junk DNA\" began to be used in the late 1950s but Susumu Ohno popularized the term in a 1972 paper titled \"So much 'junk' DNA in our genome\" where he summarized the current evidence that had accumulated by then. In a second paper that same year, he concluded that 90% of mammalian genomes consisted of nonfunctional DNA. The case for junk DNA was summarized in a lengthy paper by David Comings in 1972 where he listed four reasons for proposing junk DNA:\nThe discovery of introns in the 1970s seemed to confirm the views of junk DNA proponents because it meant that genes were very large and even huge genomes could not accommodate large numbers of genes. The proponents of junk DNA tended to dismiss intron sequences as mostly nonfunctional DNA (junk) but junk DNA opponents advanced a number of hypotheses attributing functions of various sort to intron sequences.\nBy 1980 it was apparent that most of the repetitive DNA in the human genome was related to transposons. This prompted a series of papers and letters describing transposons as selfish DNA that acted as a parasite in genomes and produced no fitness advantage for the organism.\nOpponents of junk DNA interpreted these results as evidence that most of the genome is functional and they developed several hypotheses advocating that transposon sequences could benefit the organism or the species. The most important opponent of junk DNA at this time was Thomas Cavalier-Smith who argued that the extra DNA was required to increase the volume of the nucleus in order to promote more efficient transport across the nuclear membrane.\nThe positions of the two sides of the controversy hardened with one side believing that evolution was consistent with large amounts of junk DNA and the other side believing that natural selection should eliminate junk DNA. These differing views of evolution were highlighted in a letter from Thomas Jukes, a proponent of junk DNA, to Francis Crick on December 20, 1979:\nDear Francis, I am sure that you realize how frightfully angry a lot of people will be if you say that much of the DNA is junk. The geneticists will be angry because they think that DNA is sacred. The Darwinian evolutionists will be outraged because they believe every change in DNA that is accepted in evolution is necessarily an adaptive change. To suggest anything else is an insult to the sacred memory of Darwin.\nThe other point of view was expressed by Roy John Britten and Kohne in their seminal paper on repetitive DNA.\nA concept that is repugnant to us is that about half of the DNA of higher organisms is trivial or permanently inert (on an evolutionary timescale).\nJunk DNA and non-coding DNA.\nThere is considerable confusion in the popular press and in the scientific literature about the distinction between non-coding DNA and junk DNA.\nAccording to an article published in 2021 in American Scientist:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Close to 99 percent of our genome has been historically classified as noncoding, useless \"junk\" DNA. Consequently, these sequences were rarely studied.\nA book published in 2020 states:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;When it was first discovered, the nongenic DNA was sometimes called\u2014somewhat derisively by people who did not know better\u2014\"junk DNA\" because it had no obvious utility, and they foolishly assumed that if it was not carrying coding information it must be useless trash.\nThe common theme is that the original proponents of junk DNA thought that all non-coding DNA was junk. This claim has been attributed to a paper by David Comings in 1972 where he is reported to have said that junk DNA refers to \"all\" non-coding DNA. But Comings never said that. In that paper he discusses non-coding genes for ribosomal RNA and tRNAs and non-coding regulatory DNA and he proposes several possible functions for the bulk of non-coding DNA. In another publication from the same year Comings again discusses the term junk DNA with the clear understanding that it does not include non-coding regulatory sequences.\nThe idea that all non-coding DNA was thought to be junk has been criticized by numerous authors for distorting the history of junk DNA; for example:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSome of the criticisms have been strong:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFunctional vs non-functional.\nThe main challenge of identifying junk DNA is to distinguish between \"functional\" and \"non-functional\" sequences. This is non-trivial, but there is some good evidence for both categories.\nFunctional.\nProtein-coding sequences are the most obvious functional sequences in genomes. However, they make up only 1-2% of most vertebrate genomes. However, there are also \"functional\" but \"non-coding\" DNA sequences such as regulatory sequences, origins of replication, and centromeres. These sequences are usually conserved in evolution and make up another 3-8% of the human genome.\nThe Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project reported that detectable biochemical activity was observed in regions covering at least 80% of the human genome, with biochemical activity defined primarily as being transcribed. While these findings were announced as the demise of junk DNA it is important to point out that transcription does not mean a sequence is \"functional\", analogous to some meaningless text that can be transcribed or copied without having any meaning.\nIn a few cases it has been shown that repetitive DNA, such as microsatellites, can have a function. For instance, the HRAS1 minisatellite is a region located approximately 1000 bp downstream from the gene's coding sequences and is composed of 30 to 100 units of a 28-bp consensus sequence. Thirty alleles of 1000 to 3000 bp have been described. Some mutant alleles were found in cancer patients and it was concluded that the region likely binds transcription factors that activate HRAS1 and, as a consequence, causes cancer.\nNon-functional.\nNon-functional DNA is rare in bacterial genomes which typically have an extremely high gene density, with only a few percent being not protein-coding.\nHowever, in most animal or plant genomes, a large fraction of DNA is non-functional, given that there is no obvious selective pressure on these sequences. More importantly, there is strong evidence that these sequences are not functional in other ways (using the human genome as example):\n(1) Repetitive elements, especially mobile elements make up a large fraction of the human genome, such as LTR retrotransposons (8.3% of total genome), SINEs (13.1% of total genome) including Alu elements, LINEs (20.4% of total genome), SVAs (SINE-VNTR-Alu) and Class II DNA transposons (2.9% of total genome). Many of these sequences are the descendents of ancient virus infections and are thus \"non-functional\" in terms of human genome function.\n(2) Many sequences can be deleted as shown by comparing genomes. For instance, an analysis of 14,623 individuals identified 42,765 structural variants in the human genome of which 23.4% affected multiple genes (by deleting them or part of them). This study also found 47 deletions of &gt;1 MB, showing that large chunks of the human genome can get deleted without obvious consequences.\n(3) Only a small fraction of the human genome is conserved, indicating that there is no strong (functional) selection pressure on these sequences, so they can rather freely mutate. About 11% or less of the human genome is conserved and about 7% is under purifying selection.\nOpponents of junk DNA argue that biochemical activity detects functional regions of the genome that are not identified by sequence conservation or purifying selection. According to some scientists, until a region in question has been shown to have additional features, beyond what is expected of the null hypothesis, it should provisionally be labelled as non-functional.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Assemblages of drumlins are referred to as fields or swarms; they can create a landscape which is often described as having a 'basket of eggs topography'.\nMorphology.\nDrumlins occur in various shapes and sizes, including symmetrical (about the long axis), spindle, parabolic forms, and transverse asymmetrical forms. Generally, they are elongated, oval-shaped hills, with a long axis parallel to the orientation of ice flow and with an up-ice (stoss) face that is generally steeper than the down-ice (lee) face.\nDrumlins are typically between long and between wide. Drumlins generally have a length to width ratio of between 1.7 and 4.1 and it has been suggested that this ratio can indicate the velocity of the glacier. That is, since ice flows in laminar flow, the resistance to flow is frictional and depends on area of contact; thus, a more elongated drumlin would indicate a lower velocity and a shorter one would indicate a higher velocity.\nOccurrence.\nDrumlins and drumlin swarms are glacial landforms composed primarily of glacial till. They form near the margin of glacial systems, and within zones of fast flow deep within ice sheets, and are commonly found with other major glacially-formed features (including tunnel valleys, eskers, scours, and exposed bedrock erosion).\nDrumlins are often encountered in drumlin fields of similarly shaped, sized and oriented hills. Many Pleistocene drumlin fields are observed to occur in a fan-like distribution. The long axis of each drumlin is parallel to the direction of movement of the glacier at the time of formation. Inspection of aerial photos of these fields reveals glacier's progress through the landscape. The M\u00falaj\u00f6kull drumlins of Hofsj\u00f6kull are also arrayed in a splayed fan distribution around an arc of 180\u00b0. This field surrounds the current lobe of the glacier and provide a view into the past, showing the previous extent and motion of the ice.\nComposition.\nDrumlins may comprise layers of clay, silt, sand, gravel and boulders in various proportions; perhaps indicating that material was repeatedly added to a core, which may be of rock or glacial till. Alternatively, drumlins may be residual, with the landforms resulting from erosion of material between the landforms. The dilatancy of glacial till was invoked as a major factor in drumlin formation. In other cases, drumlin fields include drumlins made up entirely of hard bedrock (e.g. granite or well-lithified limestone). These drumlins cannot be explained by the addition of soft sediment to a core. Thus, accretion and erosion of soft sediment by processes of subglacial deformation do not present unifying theories for all drumlins\u2014some are composed of residual bedrock.\nFormation.\nThere are two main theories of drumlin formation. The first, \"constructional\", suggests that they form as sediment is deposited from subglacial waterways laden with till including gravel, clay, silt, and sand. As the drumlin forms, the scrape and flow of the glacier continues around it and the material deposited accumulates, the clasts align themselves with direction of flow. It is because of this process that geologists are able to determine how the drumlin formed using till fabric analysis, the study of the orientation and dip of particles within a till matrix. By examining the till particles and plotting their orientation and dip on a stereonet, scientists are able to see if there is a correlation between each clast and the overall orientation of the drumlin: the more similar in orientation and dip of the clasts throughout the drumlin, the more likely it is that they had been deposited during the formation process. If the opposite is true, and there doesn't seem to be a link between the drumlin and the till, it suggests that the other main theory of formation could be true.\nThe second theory proposes that drumlins form by erosion of material from an unconsolidated bed. Erosion under a glacier in the immediate vicinity of a drumlin can be on the order of a meter's depth of sediment per year, depending heavily on the shear stress acting on the ground below the glacier from the weight of the glacier itself, with the eroded sediment forming a drumlin as it is repositioned and deposited.\nA hypothesis that catastrophic sub-glacial floods form drumlins by deposition or erosion challenges conventional explanations for drumlins. It includes deposition of glaciofluvial sediment in cavities scoured into a glacier bed by subglacial meltwater, and remnant ridges left behind by erosion of soft sediment or hard rock by turbulent meltwater. This hypothesis requires huge, subglacial meltwater floods, each of which would raise sea level by tens of centimeters in a few weeks. Studies of erosional forms in bedrock at French River, Ontario, Canada, provide evidence for such floods.\nThe recent retreat of a marginal outlet glacier of Hofsj\u00f6kull in Iceland exposed a drumlin field with more than 50 drumlins ranging from in length, in width, and in height. These formed through a progression of subglacial depositional and erosional processes, with each horizontal till bed within the drumlin created by an individual surge of the glacier. The above theory for the formation of these Icelandic drumlins best explains one type of drumlin. However, it does not provide a unifying explanation of all drumlins. For example, drumlin fields including drumlins composed entirely of hard bedrock cannot be explained by deposition and erosion of unconsolidated beds. Furthermore, hairpin scours around many drumlins are best explained by the erosive action of horseshoe vortices around obstacles in a turbulent boundary layer.\nSemi-submerged or drowned drumlins can be observed where rising sea-levels flooded the low-lying areas in between drumlin ridges. The most notable example of this is Clew Bay in the west of Ireland, which contains hundreds of drumlin islands and islets. It was once a field of drumlins that was \"drowned\" following the Last Glacial Period.\nSoil development on drumlins.\nRecently formed drumlins often incorporate a thin \"A\" soil horizon (often referred to as \"topsoil\" which accumulated after formation) and a thin \"Bw\" horizon (commonly referred to as \"subsoil\"). The \"C\" horizon, which shows little evidence of being affected by soil forming processes (weathering), is close to the surface, and may be at the surface on an eroded drumlin. Below the C horizon the drumlin consists of multiple beds of till deposited by lodgment and bed deformation. On drumlins with longer exposure (e.g. in the Lake Ontario drumlin field in New York State) soil development is more advanced, for example with the formation of clay-enriched \"Bt\" horizons.\nExamples of drumlins.\nAfrica.\nNamibian drumlins, found in the desert in the Kunene Region of northwestern Namibia, are thought to be the result of Paleozoic Era glaciation.\nEurope.\nBesides the Icelandic drumlins mentioned above, the literature also documents extensive drumlin fields in England, Scotland and Wales, Switzerland, Poland, Estonia (Vooremaa), Latvia, Sweden, around Lake Constance north of the Alps, in the Republic of Ireland (County Leitrim, County Monaghan, County Mayo and County Cavan), in Northern Ireland (County Fermanagh, County Armagh, and in particular County Down), Germany, Hindsholm in Denmark, Finland and Greenland.\nNorth America.\nThe majority of drumlins observed in North America were formed during the Wisconsin glaciation.\nThe largest drumlin fields in the world formed beneath the Laurentide Ice Sheet and are found in Canada \u2014 Nunavut, the Northwest Territories, northern Saskatchewan, northern Manitoba, northern Ontario and northern Quebec. Drumlins occur in every Canadian province and territory. Clusters of thousands of drumlins are found in:\nIn the United States, drumlins are common in:\nAsia.\nDrumlins are found at Tiksi, Sakha Republic, Russia.\nSouth America.\nExtensive drumlin fields are found in Patagonia. A major drumlin field extends on both sides of the Strait of Magellan covering the surroundings of Punta Arenas' Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez del Campo Airport, Isabel Island and an area south of Gente Grande Bay in Tierra del Fuego Island. \nLand areas around Beagle Channel host also drumlin fields; for example Gable Island and northern Navarino Island.\nAntarctica.\nIn 2007, drumlins were observed to be forming beneath the ice of a West Antarctic ice stream.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "44299", "revid": "7646666", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44299", "title": "Moraine", "text": "Glacially formed accumulation of debris\nA moraine is any accumulation of unconsolidated debris (regolith and rock), sometimes referred to as glacial till, that occurs in both currently and formerly glaciated regions, and that has been previously carried along by a glacier or ice sheet. It may consist of partly rounded particles ranging in size from boulders (in which case it is often referred to as boulder clay) down to gravel and sand, in a groundmass of finely-divided clayey material sometimes called glacial flour. Lateral moraines are those formed at the side of the ice flow, and terminal moraines are those formed at the foot, marking the maximum advance of the glacier. Other types of moraine include ground moraines (till-covered areas forming sheets on flat or irregular topography) and medial moraines (moraines formed where two glaciers meet).\nEtymology.\nThe word \"moraine\" is borrowed from French , which in turn is derived from the Savoyard Italian ('mound of earth'). in this case was derived from Proven\u00e7al ('snout'), itself from Vulgar Latin ('rounded object'). The term was introduced into geology by Horace B\u00e9n\u00e9dict de Saussure in 1779.\nCharacteristics.\nMoraines are landforms composed of glacial till deposited primarily by glacial ice. Glacial till, in turn, is unstratified and unsorted debris ranging in size from silt-sized glacial flour to large boulders. The individual rock fragments are typically sub-angular to rounded in shape. Moraines may be found on the glacier's surface or deposited as piles or sheets of debris where the glacier has melted.\nFormation.\nMoraines may form through a number of processes, depending on the characteristics of sediment, the dynamics on the ice, and the location on the glacier in which the moraine is formed. Moraine forming processes may be loosely divided into \"passive\" and \"active\".\n\"Passive\" processes involve the placing of chaotic supraglacial sediments onto the landscape with limited reworking, typically forming hummocky moraines. These moraines are composed of supraglacial sediments from the ice surface.\n\"Active\" processes form or rework moraine sediment directly by the movement of ice, known as glaciotectonism. These form push moraines and thrust-block moraines, which are often composed of till and reworked proglacial sediment.\nMoraine may also form by the accumulation of sand and gravel deposits from glacial streams emanating from the ice margin. These fan deposits may coalesce to form a long moraine bank marking the ice margin. Several processes may combine to form and rework a single moraine, and most moraines record a continuum of processes. Reworking of moraines may lead to the formation of placer deposits of gold as is the case of southernmost Chile.\nTypes of moraines.\nMoraines can be classified either by origin, location with respect to a glacier or former glacier, or by shape. \nLateral moraines.\nLateral moraines are parallel ridges of debris deposited along the sides of a glacier. The unconsolidated debris can be deposited on top of the glacier by frost shattering of the valley walls or from tributary streams flowing into the valley, or may be subglacial debris carried to the surface of the glacier, melted out, and transported to the glacier margin.\nLateral moraines can rise up to over the valley floor, can be up to long, and are steeper close to the glacier margin (up to 80 degrees) than further away (where slopes are typically 29 to 36 degrees).\nGround moraines.\nGround moraines are till-covered areas with irregular topography and no ridges, often forming gently rolling hills or plains, with relief of less than . Ground moraine is accumulated at the base of the ice as lodgment till with a thin and discontinuous upper layer of supraglacial till deposited as the glacier retreats. It typically is found in the areas between end moraines.\nRogen moraines.\nRogen moraines or ribbed moraines are a type of basal moraines that form a series of ribs perpendicular to the ice flow in an ice sheet. The depressions between the ribs are sometimes filled with water, making the Rogen moraines look like tigerstripes on aerial photographs. Rogen moraines are named after Lake Rogen in H\u00e4rjedalen, Sweden, the landform's type locality.\nde Geer moraines.\nClosely related to Rogen moraines, de Geer moraines are till ridges up to 5\u00a0m high and 10\u201350\u00a0m wide running perpendicular to the ice flow. They occur in large groups in low-lying areas. Named for Gerard De Geer, who first described them in 1889, these moraines may have developed from crevasses underneath the ice sheet. The Kvarken has a very high density of de Geer moraines.\nEnd or terminal moraines.\nEnd moraines, or terminal moraines, are ridges of unconsolidated debris deposited at the snout or end of the glacier. They usually reflect the shape of the glacier's terminus. Glaciers act much like a conveyor belt, carrying debris from the top of the glacier to the bottom where it deposits it in end moraines. End moraine size and shape are determined by whether the glacier is advancing, receding or at equilibrium. The longer the terminus of the glacier stays in one place, the more debris accumulate in the moraine. There are two types of end moraines: terminal and recessional. Terminal moraines mark the maximum advance of the glacier. Recessional moraines are small ridges left as a glacier pauses during its retreat. After a glacier retreats, the end moraine may be destroyed by postglacial erosion.\nRecessional moraine.\nRecessional moraines are often observed as a series of transverse ridges running across a valley behind a terminal moraine. They form perpendicular to the lateral moraines that they reside between and are composed of unconsolidated debris deposited by the glacier. They are created during temporary halts in a glacier's retreat.\nArctic push moraines.\nIn permafrost areas an advancing glacier may push up thick layers of frozen sediments at its front. An arctic push moraine will then be formed.\nMedial moraine.\nA medial moraine is a ridge of moraine that runs down the center of a valley floor. It forms when two glaciers meet and the debris on the edges of the adjacent valley sides join and are carried on top of the enlarged glacier. As the glacier melts or retreats, the debris is deposited and a ridge down the middle of the valley floor is created. The Kaskawulsh Glacier in the Kluane National Park, Yukon, has a ridge of medial moraine 1\u00a0km wide.\nSupraglacial moraines.\nSupraglacial moraines are created by debris accumulated on top of glacial ice. This debris can accumulate due to ice flow toward the surface in the ablation zone, melting of surface ice or from debris that falls onto the glacier from valley sidewalls.\nWashboard moraines.\nWashboard moraines, also known as minor or corrugated moraines, are low-amplitude geomorphic features caused by glaciers. They consist of low-relief ridges, in height and around apart, accumulated at the base of the ice as lodgment till. The name \"washboard moraine\" refers to the fact that, from the air, it resembles a washboard.\"\nVeiki moraine.\nA Veiki moraine is a kind of hummocky moraine that forms irregular landscapes of ponds and plateaus surrounded by banks. It forms from the irregular melting of ice covered with a thick layer of debris. Veiki moraine is common in northern Sweden and parts of Canada.\n* \n* \n* \n* Kame\n* \n* \n* \nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Written by Jeunet with Guillaume Laurant, the film is a whimsical depiction of contemporary Parisian life, set in Montmartre. It tells the story of Am\u00e9lie Poulain, played by Audrey Tautou, a shy and quirky waitress who decides to change the lives of those around her for the better while dealing with her own isolation. The film features an ensemble cast of supporting roles, including Mathieu Kassovitz, Rufus, Lorella Cravotta, Serge Merlin, Jamel Debbouze, Claire Maurier, Clotilde Mollet, Isabelle Nanty, Dominique Pinon, Artus de Penguern, Yolande Moreau, Urbain Cancelier, and Maurice B\u00e9nichou.\n\"Am\u00e9lie\" was released theatrically in France on 25 April 2001 by UGC-Fox Distribution and in Germany on 16 August 2001 by Prokino Filmverleih. The film received widespread critical acclaim, with praise for Tautou's performance, the cinematography, visuals, production design, sound design, editing, musical score, writing and Jeunet's direction. \"Am\u00e9lie\" won Best Film at the European Film Awards, four C\u00e9sar Awards, including Best Film and Best Director, and two British Academy Film Awards, including Best Original Screenplay. It was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Foreign Language Film and Best Original Screenplay. The film was an enormous commercial success, grossing $174.2\u00a0million worldwide against a budget of $10\u00a0million, and is one of the biggest international successes for a French film.\nPlot.\nAm\u00e9lie Poulain is born in 1974 and brought up by eccentric parents who \u2013 incorrectly believing that she has a heart defect \u2013 decide to homeschool her. To cope with her loneliness, Am\u00e9lie develops an active imagination and a mischievous personality. When Am\u00e9lie is six, her mother, Amandine, is killed when a suicidal Canadian tourist jumps from the roof of Notre-Dame de Paris and lands on her. As a result, her father, Rapha\u00ebl, withdraws more and more from society. Am\u00e9lie leaves home at the age of 18 and becomes a waitress at the Caf\u00e9 des 2 Moulins in Montmartre, which is staffed and frequented by a collection of eccentrics. She is single and lets her imagination roam freely, finding contentment in simple pleasures like dipping her hand into grain sacks, cracking cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e with a spoon, and skipping stones along the Canal Saint-Martin.\nOn 31 August 1997, startled by the news of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, Am\u00e9lie drops a plastic perfume-stopper, which dislodges a wall tile and accidentally reveals an old metal box which contains childhood memorabilia hidden by a boy who lived in her apartment decades earlier. Am\u00e9lie resolves to track down the boy and return the box to him. She promises herself that if it makes him happy, she will devote her life to bringing happiness to others.\nAfter asking the apartment's concierge and several old tenants about the boy's identity, Am\u00e9lie meets her reclusive neighbour, Raymond Dufayel, an artist with brittle bone disease who replicates Pierre-Auguste Renoir's 1881 painting \"Luncheon of the Boating Party\" every year. He recalls the boy's name as \"Bretodeau\". Am\u00e9lie finds the man, Dominique Bretodeau, and surreptitiously gives him the box. Moved to tears by the discovery and the memories it holds, Bretodeau resolves to reconcile with his estranged daughter and the grandson he has never met. Am\u00e9lie happily embarks on her new mission.\nAm\u00e9lie secretly executes complex schemes that positively affect the lives of those around her. She escorts a blind man to the M\u00e9tro station while giving him a rich description of the street scenes he passes. She persuades her father to follow his dream of touring the world by stealing his garden gnome and having a flight attendant friend mail pictures of it posing with landmarks from all over the world. She starts a romance between her hypochondriacal co-worker Georgette and Joseph, a patron of the caf\u00e9. She convinces Madeleine Wallace, the concierge of her block of flats, that the husband who abandoned her had sent her a final conciliatory love letter just before his accidental death years before. She plays practical jokes on Collignon, the nasty greengrocer. Mentally exhausted, Collignon no longer abuses his meek, good-natured assistant Lucien. A delighted Lucien subsequently takes charge at the grocery stand.\nDufayel, having observed Am\u00e9lie, begins a conversation with her about his painting. Although he has copied the same Renoir painting 20 times, he has never quite captured the look of the girl drinking a glass of water. They discuss the meaning of this character, and over several conversations, Am\u00e9lie begins projecting her loneliness onto the image. Dufayel recognizes this and uses the girl in the painting to push Am\u00e9lie to examine her attraction to a quirky young man, Nino Quincampoix, who collects the discarded photographs of strangers from passport photo booths. When Am\u00e9lie bumps into Nino a second time, she realizes she is falling in love with him. He accidentally drops a photo album in the street. Am\u00e9lie retrieves it.\nAm\u00e9lie plays a cat-and-mouse game with Nino around Paris before returning his treasured album anonymously. After arranging a meeting at the 2 Moulins, Am\u00e9lie panics and tries to deny her identity. Her co-worker, Gina, concerned for Am\u00e9lie's well-being, screens Nino for her; Joseph's comment about this misleads Am\u00e9lie to believe she has lost Nino to Gina. It takes Dufayel's insight to give her the courage to pursue Nino, resulting in a romantic night together and the beginning of a relationship. The film ends as Am\u00e9lie experiences a moment of happiness she has found for herself.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nProduction.\nIn his DVD commentary, Jeunet explains that he originally wrote the role of Am\u00e9lie for the English actress Emily Watson. In that first draft, Am\u00e9lie's father was an Englishman living in London. However, Watson's French was not strong, and when she became unavailable to shoot the film, owing to a conflict with the filming of \"Gosford Park\" (2001), Jeunet rewrote the screenplay for a French actress. Audrey Tautou was the first actress he auditioned having seen her on the poster for the 1999 film \"Venus Beauty Institute\".\nFilming took place mainly in Paris. The Caf\u00e9 des 2 Moulins (15 Rue Lepic, Montmartre, Paris) where Am\u00e9lie works is a real place. Principal photography took place from 2 March 2000 to 7 July 2000.\nThe filmmakers made use of computer-generated imagery (including computer animation) and a digital intermediate. The studio scenes were filmed in the MMC Studios Coloneum in Cologne (Germany). The film shares many of the themes in its plot with the second half of the 1994 film \"Chungking Express\".\nRelease.\nThe film was released in France, Belgium, and French-speaking western Switzerland in April 2001, with subsequent screenings at various film festivals followed by releases around the world. It received limited releases in North America, the United Kingdom, and Australasia later in 2001.\nCannes Film Festival selector Gilles Jacob described \"Am\u00e9lie\" as \"uninteresting\", and therefore it was not screened at the festival, although the version he viewed was an early cut without music. The absence of \"Am\u00e9lie\" at the festival caused something of a controversy because of the warm welcome by the French media and audience in contrast with the reaction of the selector. David Martin-Jones, in an article in \"Senses of Cinema\", stated that the film \"[wears] its national [French] identity on its sleeve\" and that this attracted both audiences of mainstream films and those of arthouse ones.\nSubsequent re-releases.\nIn 2021, Newen Connect's TF1 Studio signed a deal with UGC for international distribution and sales rights to its films, including \"Am\u00e9lie\". The film was then re-released in multiple countries for its 20th anniversary, including on 11 May 2021 in Italy, by BIM Distribuzione.\nThe film's U.S. distributor Miramax was sold to Qatari company beIN Media Group in 2016. Then in 2020, beIN sold a 49% stake in Miramax to ViacomCBS (now known as Paramount Skydance), with this deal giving them the rights to Miramax's film catalog. In 2021, Paramount went on to reissue \"Am\u00e9lie\" on home media, along with many other Miramax titles they had acquired.\nIn February 2022, while discussing the legacy of \"Am\u00e9lie\" in an interview with \"The New York Times\", Jeunet stated that U.S. distribution rights to the film, held by Miramax (and later Paramount), had been acquired by Sony Pictures Classics, with the company planning a re-release in the future. While the distributor did confirm this news, no further developments were reported until late December 2023, when Sony announced their acquisition of distribution rights to the film for North America excluding French Canada and scheduled the film for a theatrical re-release in 250 theatres in the United States on 14 February 2024. Sony stated that they had acquired \"all\" North American rights to the film in a press release, although it is unclear whether Sony purchased these rights for a long-term period, or if they were purchased for a temporary period. Some sources report Miramax/Paramount as still controlling certain international rights to \"Am\u00e9lie\", and on their official website, Miramax continue to list it as one of the films in their library.\nReception.\nCritical response.\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 90% approval rating based on 234 reviews, with an average rating of 8.2/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \"The feel-good \"Am\u00e9lie\" is a lively, fanciful charmer, showcasing Audrey Tautou as its delightful heroine.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 69 out of 100, based on 31 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.\nAlan Morrison from \"Empire\" magazine gave \"Am\u00e9lie\" five stars and called it \"one of the year's best, with crossover potential along the lines of \"Cyrano de Bergerac\" (1990) and \"\" (1994). Given its quirky heart, it might well surpass them all\". Paul Tatara of \"CNN\" praised \"Am\u00e9lie\"'s playful nature. In his review, he wrote, \"Its whimsical, free-ranging nature is often enchanting; the first hour, in particular, is brimming with amiable, sardonic laughs.\"\nThe film was attacked by critic Serge Kaganski of \"Les Inrockuptibles\" for an unrealistic and picturesque vision of a bygone French society with few ethnic minorities. Jeunet dismissed the criticism by pointing out that the photo collection contains pictures of people from numerous ethnic backgrounds, and that Jamel Debbouze, who plays Lucien, is of Moroccan descent.\nBox office.\nThe film opened on 432 screens in France and grossed 43.2 million French Franc ($6.2 million) in its opening week, placing it at number one. It stayed in the top 10 for 22 weeks. It was the highest-grossing film in France for the year with a gross of $41 million. The film also grossed $33 million in the United States and Canada theatrically, making it the highest-grossing French-language film of all time in North America.\nAccolades.\n\"Am\u00e9lie\" was selected by \"The New York Times\" as one of \"The Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made\". The film placed No. 2 in \"Empire\" magazine's \"The 100 Best Films of World Cinema\". \"Paste\" magazine ranked it second on its list of the 50 Best Movies of the Decade (2000\u20132009). In August 2016, \"BBC Magazine\" conducted a poll on the 21st century's 100 greatest films so far, with \"Am\u00e9lie\" ranking at number 87.\n\"Entertainment Weekly\" named the film poster one of the best on its list of the top 25 film posters in the past 25 years. It also named Am\u00e9lie setting up a wild goose chase for her beloved Nino all through Paris as No. 9 on its list of top 25 Romantic Gestures. In 2010, an online public poll by the \"American Cinematographer\" \u2013 the house journal of the American Society of Cinematographers \u2013 named \"Am\u00e9lie\" the best shot film of the decade.\n\"Am\u00e9lie\" is rated 37 among the 50 Greatest Romantic Comedies of All Time by \"Rolling Stone\" magazine.\nIn 2025, the film ranked number 41 on \"The New York Times\"' list of \"The 100 Best Movies of the 21st Century\" and number 46 on the \"Readers' Choice\" edition of the list.\nSoundtrack.\nThe soundtrack to \"Am\u00e9lie\" was composed by Yann Tiersen.\nMusical adaptation.\nOn 23 August 2013, composer Dan Messe, one of the founders and members of the band Hem, confirmed speculation that he would be writing the score for a musical adaptation of \"Am\u00e9lie\", collaborating with Craig Lucas and Nathan Tysen. Messe also confirmed he would be composing all original music for the show and not using the Yann Tiersen score. The musical adaptation premiered at the Berkeley Repertory Theater in August 2015. It opened on Broadway in March 2017 and closed in May 2017. The production started its pre-Broadway engagement at the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles in December 2016, with Phillipa Soo in the title role. A London production opened in 2020, with Australian, German, Dutch, and Finnish productions set to open or resume pending the cessation of restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nJeunet has distanced himself from the musical due to his distaste for the art form, saying he only sold the rights to raise funds for children's charity \"M\u00e9c\u00e9nat Chirurgie Cardiaque\".\nHome media.\nThe film has no overall worldwide distributor, but Blu-ray Discs have been released in Canada and Australia. The first release occurred in Canada in September 2008 by TVA Films. This version did not contain any English subtitles and received criticisms regarding picture quality. In November 2009, an Australian release occurred. This time the version contained English subtitles and features no region coding. Momentum Pictures released a Blu-ray in the UK on 17 October 2011. Lionsgate released a U.S. Blu-ray edition in 2011, after entering a temporary agreement to distribute Miramax's library on home video. Sony Pictures issued a U.S. Blu-ray in a steelbook in 2024. The film is also available in HD on iTunes and other digital download services.\nIn the United Kingdom, it was 2013's tenth best-selling foreign-language film on physical home video formats, and the year's third best-selling French film (below \"The Intouchables\" and \"Rust and Bone\").\nLegacy.\nFor the 2007 television show \"Pushing Daisies\", a \"quirky fairy tale\", American Broadcasting Company (ABC) sought an \"Am\u00e9lie\" feel, with the same chords of \"whimsy and spirit and magic\". \"Pushing Daisies\" creator Bryan Fuller said \"Am\u00e9lie\" is his favorite film. \"All the things I love are represented in that movie\", he said. \"It's a movie that will make me cry based on kindness as opposed to sadness\". \"The New York Times\"' review of \"Pushing Daisies\" reported \"the \"Am\u00e9lie\" influence on \"Pushing Daisies\" is everywhere\".\nA species of frog was named \"Cochranella amelie\". The scientist who named it said: \"This new species of glass frog is for Am\u00e9lie, protagonist of the extraordinary movie \"Le Fabuleux Destin d'Am\u00e9lie Poulain\"; a film where little details play an important role in the achievement of \"joie de vivre\"; like the important role that glass frogs and all amphibians and reptiles play in the health of our planet\". The species was described in the scientific journal \"Zootaxa\" in an article entitled \"An enigmatic new species of Glassfrog (Amphibia: Anura: Centrolenidae) from the Amazonian Andean slopes of Ecuador\". The film is also the inspiration behind a painting game called \u00c9t\u00e9 where players can paint Montreal into life.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It has a pale yellowish to dark golden fur with dark spots grouped in rosettes. Its body is slender and muscular, reaching a length of with a long tail and a shoulder height of . Males typically weigh , and females .\nThe leopard was first described in 1758, and several subspecies were proposed in the 19th and 20th centuries. Today, eight subspecies are recognised in its wide range in Africa and Asia. It initially evolved in Africa during the Early Pleistocene, before migrating into Eurasia around the Early\u2013Middle Pleistocene transition. Leopards were formerly present across Europe, but became extinct in the region at around the end of the Late Pleistocene-early Holocene.\nThe leopard is adapted to a variety of habitats ranging from rainforest to steppe, including arid and montane areas. It is an opportunistic predator, hunting mostly ungulates and primates. It relies on its spotted pattern for camouflage as it stalks and ambushes its prey, which it sometimes drags up a tree. It is a solitary animal outside the mating season and when raising cubs. Females usually give birth to a litter of 2\u20134 cubs once in 15\u201324 months. Both male and female leopards typically reach sexual maturity at the age 2\u20132.5 years.\nListed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, leopard populations are currently threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, and are declining in large parts of the global range. Leopards have had cultural roles in Ancient Greece, West Africa and modern Western culture. Leopard skins are popular in fashion.\nEtymology.\nThe English name \"leopard\" comes from Old French or Middle French , that derives from Latin and ancient Greek (). could be a compound of (), meaning 'lion', and (), meaning 'spotted'. The word originally referred to a cheetah (\"Acinonyx jubatus\").\n\"Panther\" is another common name, derived from Latin and ancient Greek (); The generic name \"Panthera\" originates in Latin , a hunting net for catching wild beasts to be used by the Romans in combats. is the masculine singular form.\nTaxonomy.\n\"Felis pardus\" was the scientific name proposed by Carl Linnaeus in 1758.\nThe generic name \"Panthera\" was first used by Lorenz Oken in 1816, who included all the known spotted cats into this group.\nOken's classification was not widely accepted, and \"Felis\" or \"Leopardus\" was used as the generic name until the early 20th century.\nThe leopard was designated as the type species of \"Panthera\" by Joel Asaph Allen in 1902.\nIn 1917, Reginald Innes Pocock also subordinated the tiger (\"P. tigris\"), lion (\"P. leo\"), and jaguar (\"P. onca\") to \"Panthera\".\nLiving subspecies.\nFollowing Linnaeus' first description, 27 leopard subspecies were proposed by naturalists between 1794 and 1956. Since 1996, only eight subspecies have been considered valid on the basis of mitochondrial analysis. Later analysis revealed a ninth valid subspecies, the Arabian leopard.\nIn 2017, the Cat Classification Task Force of the Cat Specialist Group recognized the following eight subspecies as valid taxa:\nResults of an analysis of molecular variance and pairwise fixation index of 182 African leopard museum specimens showed that some African leopards exhibit higher genetic differences than Asian leopard subspecies.\nEvolution.\nResults of phylogenetic studies based on nuclear DNA and mitochondrial DNA analysis showed that the last common ancestor of the \"Panthera\" and \"Neofelis\" genera is thought to have lived about https://\u00a0million years ago. \"Neofelis\" diverged about https://\u00a0million years ago from the \"Panthera\" lineage. The tiger diverged about https://\u00a0million years ago, followed by the snow leopard about https://\u00a0million years ago and the leopard about https://\u00a0million years ago. The leopard is a sister taxon to a clade within \"Panthera\", consisting of the lion and the jaguar.\nResults of a phylogenetic analysis of chemical secretions amongst cats indicated that the leopard is closely related to the lion.\nThe geographic origin of the \"Panthera\" is most likely northern Central Asia. The leopard-lion clade was distributed in the Asian and African Palearctic since at least the early Pliocene. The leopard-lion clade diverged 3.1\u20131.95 million years ago. Additionally, a 2016 study revealed that the mitochondrial genomes of the leopard, lion and snow leopard are more similar to each other than their nuclear genomes, indicating that their ancestors hybridized with the snow leopard at some point in their evolution.\nThe oldest unambiguous fossils of the leopard are from Eastern Africa, dating to around 2 million years ago.\nLeopard-like fossil bones and teeth possibly dating to the Pliocene were excavated in Perrier in France, northeast of London, and in Valdarno, Italy. Until 1940, similar fossils dating back to the Pleistocene were excavated mostly in loess and caves at 40 sites in Europe, including Furninha Cave near Lisbon, Genista Caves in Gibraltar, and Santander Province in northern Spain to several sites across France, Switzerland, Italy, Austria, Germany, in the north up to Derby in England, in the east to P\u0159erov in the Czech Republic and the Baranya in southern Hungary.\nLeopards arrived in Eurasia during the late Early to Middle Pleistocene around 1.2 to 0.6 million years ago.\nFour European Pleistocene leopard subspecies were proposed. \"P. p. begoueni\" from the beginning of the Early Pleistocene was replaced about https://\u00a0million years ago by \"P. p. sickenbergi\", which in turn was replaced by \"P. p. antiqua\" around 0.3 million years ago. \"P. p. spelaea\" is the most recent subspecies that appeared at the beginning of the Late Pleistocene and survived until about 11,000 years ago and possibly into the early Holocene in the Iberian Peninsula.\nLeopards depicted in cave paintings in Chauvet Cave provide indirect evidence of leopard presence in Europe.\nLeopard fossils dating to the Late Pleistocene were found in Bi\u015bnik Cave in south-central Poland.\nFossil remains were also excavated in the Iberian and Italian Peninsula, and in the Balkans.\nLeopard fossils dating to the Pleistocene were also excavated in the Japanese archipelago. Leopard fossils were also found in Taiwan.\nHybrids.\nIn 1953, a male leopard and a female lion were crossbred in Hanshin Park in Nishinomiya, Japan. Their offspring known as a leopon was born in 1959 and 1961, all cubs were spotted and bigger than a juvenile leopard. Attempts to mate a leopon with a tigress proved unsuccessful.\nCharacteristics.\nThe leopard's fur is generally soft and thick, notably softer on the belly than on the back. Its skin colour varies between individuals from pale yellowish to dark golden with dark spots grouped in rosettes. Its underbelly is white and its ringed tail is shorter than its body. Its pupils are round. Leopards living in arid regions are pale cream, yellowish to ochraceous and rufous in colour; those living in forests and mountains are much darker and deep golden. Spots fade toward the white underbelly and the insides and lower parts of the legs. Rosettes are circular in East African leopard populations, and tend to be squarish in Southern African and larger in Asian leopard populations. The fur tends to be grayish in colder climates, and dark golden in rainforest habitats. Rosette patterns are unique in each individual. This pattern is thought to be an adaptation to dense vegetation with patchy shadows, where it serves as camouflage.\nIts white-tipped tail is about long, white underneath and with spots that form incomplete bands toward the end of the tail.\nThe guard hairs protecting the basal hairs are short, in face and head, and increase in length toward the flanks and the belly to about . Juveniles have woolly fur that appear to be dark-coloured due to the densely arranged spots. \nIts fur tends to grow longer in colder climates.\nThe leopard's rosettes differ from those of the jaguar, which are darker and with smaller spots inside. The leopard has a diploid chromosome number of 38.\nMelanistic leopards are also known as black panthers. Melanism in leopards is caused by a recessive allele and is inherited as a recessive trait.\nIn India, nine pale and white leopards were reported between 1905 and 1967.\nLeopards exhibiting erythrism were recorded between 1990 and 2015 in South Africa's Madikwe Game Reserve and in Mpumalanga. The cause of this morph known as a \"strawberry leopard\" or \"pink panther\" is not well understood.\nSize.\nThe leopard is a slender and muscular cat, with relatively short limbs and a broad head. It is sexually dimorphic with males larger and heavier than females. Males stand at the shoulder, while females are tall. The head-and-body length ranges between with a long tail. Sizes vary geographically. Males typically weigh , and females . Occasionally, large males can grow up to . Leopards from the Cape Province in South Africa are generally smaller, reaching only in males.\nThe heaviest wild leopard in Southern Africa weighed around , and it measured . In 2016, an Indian leopard killed in Himachal Pradesh measured with an estimated weight of ; it was perhaps the largest known wild leopard in India.\nThe largest recorded skull of a leopard was found in India in 1920 and measured in basal length, in breadth, and weighed . The skull of an African leopard measured in basal length, and in breadth, and weighed .\nDistribution and habitat.\nThe leopard has the largest distribution of all wild cats, occurring widely in Africa and Asia, although populations are fragmented and declining. It inhabits foremost savanna and rainforest, and areas where grasslands, woodlands and riparian forests remain largely undisturbed. It also persists in urban environments, if it is not persecuted, has sufficient prey and patches of vegetation for shelter during the day.\nThe leopard's range in West Africa is estimated to have drastically declined by 95%, and in the Sahara desert by 97%. In sub-Saharan Africa, it is still numerous and surviving in marginal habitats where other large cats have disappeared. In southeastern Egypt, an individual found killed in 2017 was the first sighting of the leopard in this area in 65 years.\nIn West Asia, the leopard inhabits the areas of southern and southeastern Anatolia.\nLeopard populations in the Arabian Peninsula are small and fragmented.\nIn the Indian subcontinent, the leopard is still relatively abundant, with greater numbers than those of other \"Panthera\" species. Some leopard populations in India live quite close to human settlements and even in semi-developed areas. Although adaptable to human disturbances, leopards require healthy prey populations and appropriate vegetative cover for hunting for prolonged survival and thus rarely linger in heavily developed areas. Due to the leopard's stealth, people often remain unaware that it lives in nearby areas. As of 2020, the leopard population within forested habitats in India's tiger range landscapes was estimated at 12,172 to 13,535 individuals. Surveyed landscapes included elevations below in the Shivalik Hills and Gangetic plains, Central India and Eastern Ghats, Western Ghats, the Brahmaputra River basin and hills in Northeast India.\nIn Nepal's Kanchenjunga Conservation Area, a melanistic leopard was photographed at an elevation of by a camera trap in May 2012.\nIn Sri Lanka, leopards were recorded in Yala National Park and in unprotected forest patches, tea estates, grasslands, home gardens, pine and eucalyptus plantations.\nIn Myanmar, leopards were recorded for the first time by camera traps in the hill forests of Myanmar's Karen State. The Northern Tenasserim Forest Complex in southern Myanmar is considered a leopard stronghold. In Thailand, leopards are present in the Western Forest Complex, Kaeng Krachan-Kui Buri, Khlong Saeng-Khao Sok protected area complexes and in Hala Bala Wildlife Sanctuary bordering Malaysia. In Peninsular Malaysia, leopards are present in Belum-Temengor, Taman Negara and Endau-Rompin National Parks.\nIn Laos, leopards were recorded in Nam Et-Phou Louey National Biodiversity Conservation Area and Nam Kan National Protected Area.\nIn Cambodia, leopards inhabit deciduous dipterocarp forest in Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary and Mondulkiri Protected Forest.\nIn southern China, leopards were recorded only in the Qinling Mountains during surveys in 11 nature reserves between 2002 and 2009.\nIn Java, leopards inhabit dense tropical rainforests and dry deciduous forests at elevations from sea level to . Outside protected areas, leopards were recorded in mixed agricultural land, secondary forest and production forest between 2008 and 2014.\nIn the Russian Far East, it inhabits temperate coniferous forests where winter temperatures reach a low of .\nBehaviour and ecology.\nThe leopard is a solitary and territorial animal. It is typically shy and alert when crossing roadways and encountering oncoming vehicles, but may be emboldened to attack people or other animals when threatened. Adults associate only in the mating season. Females continue to interact with their offspring even after weaning and have been observed sharing kills with their offspring when they cannot obtain any prey. They produce a number of vocalizations, including growls and snarls. Cubs call their mother with meows and an \"urr-urr\" sound. The most notable vocalization is the 'sawing' roar, which consists of deep, repeated strokes. This likely functions in establishing territories and attracting mates.\nThe whitish spots on the back of its ears are thought to play a role in communication.\nIt has been hypothesized that the white tips of their tails may function as a 'follow-me' signal in intraspecific communication. However, no significant association were found between a conspicuous colour of tail patches and behavioural variables in carnivores.\nLeopards are mainly active from dusk till dawn and will rest for most of the day and some hours at night in thickets, among rocks or over tree branches. Leopards have been observed walking up to across their range at night; wandering up to if disturbed. In western African forests, they have been observed to be largely diurnal and hunting during twilight, when their prey animals are active; activity patterns vary between seasons.\nLeopards can climb trees quite skillfully, often resting on tree branches and descending headfirst.\nThey can run at over , leap over horizontally, and jump up to vertically.\n&lt;gallery mode=packed&gt;\nleopard rear view soft.jpg \nSocial spacing.\nIn Kruger National Park, most leopards tend to keep apart. Males occasionally interact with their partners and cubs, and exceptionally this can extend beyond to two generations. Aggressive encounters are rare, typically limited to defending territories from intruders. In a South African reserve, a male was wounded in a male\u2013male territorial battle over a carcass.\nMales occupy home ranges that often overlap with a few smaller female home ranges, probably as a strategy to enhance access to females. In the Ivory Coast, the home range of a female was completely enclosed within a male's. Females live with their cubs in home ranges that overlap extensively, probably due to the association between mothers and their offspring. There may be a few other fluctuating home ranges belonging to young individuals. It is not clear if male home ranges overlap as much as those of females do. Individuals try to drive away intruders of the same sex.\nA study of leopards in the Namibian farmlands showed that the size of home ranges was not significantly affected by sex, rainfall patterns or season; the higher the prey availability in an area, the greater the leopard population density and the smaller the size of home ranges, but they tend to expand if there is human interference.\nSizes of home ranges vary geographically and depending on habitat and availability of prey. In the Serengeti, males have home ranges of and females of ; but males in northeastern Namibia of and females of . They are even larger in arid and montane areas. In Nepal's Bardia National Park, male home ranges of and female ones of are smaller than those generally observed in Africa.\nHunting and diet.\nThe leopard is a carnivore that prefers medium-sized prey with a body mass ranging from . Prey species in this weight range tend to occur in dense habitat and to form small herds. Species that prefer open areas and have well-developed anti-predator strategies are less preferred. More than 100 prey species have been recorded. The most preferred species are ungulates, such as impala, bushbuck, common duiker and chital. Primates preyed upon include white-eyelid mangabeys, guenons and gray langurs. Leopards also kill smaller carnivores like black-backed jackal, bat-eared fox, genet and cheetah. In urban environments, domestic dogs provide an important food source. The largest prey killed by a leopard was reportedly a male eland weighing . A study in Wolong National Nature Reserve in southern China demonstrated variation in the leopard's diet over time; over the course of seven years, the vegetative cover receded, and leopards opportunistically shifted from primarily consuming tufted deer to pursuing bamboo rats and other smaller prey.\nThe leopard depends mainly on its acute senses of hearing and vision for hunting. It primarily hunts at night in most areas. In western African forests and Tsavo National Park, they have also been observed hunting by day. They usually hunt on the ground. In the Serengeti, they have been seen to ambush prey by descending on it from trees. It stalks its prey and tries to approach as closely as possible, typically within of the target, and, finally, pounces on it and kills it by suffocation. It kills small prey with a bite to the back of the neck, but holds larger animals by the throat and strangles them. It caches kills up to apart. It is able to take large prey due to its powerful jaw muscles, and is therefore strong enough to drag carcasses heavier than itself up into trees; an individual was seen to haul a young giraffe weighing nearly up into a tree. It eats small prey immediately, but drags larger carcasses over several hundred metres and caches it safely in trees, bushes or even caves; this behaviour allows the leopard to store its prey away from rivals, and offers it an advantage over them. The way it stores the kill depends on local topography and individual preferences, varying from trees in Kruger National Park to bushes in the plain terrain of the Kalahari. Before their extirpation from Europe, leopards there cached their meat in caves, as evidenced by fossilised bone accumulations in caves such as Los Rincones in the Province of Zaragoza, Spain. \nLeopards are known to drop from trees onto Impalas, which is probably an opportunistic hunting behaviour. A leopard falling from a height of 2.69 metres onto the back of its prey (3.55 metres total height), takes 0.7 seconds to fall and reaches a terminal velocity of 25 km/h; this hunting technique requires that the prey be unaware of the predator's attack and it also requires great precision to avoid falling on the horns of males, which allows for a safe attack.\nAverage daily consumption rates of were estimated for males and of for females. In the southern Kalahari Desert, leopards meet their water requirements by the bodily fluids of prey and succulent plants; they drink water every two to three days and feed infrequently on moisture-rich plants such as gemsbok cucumbers, watermelon and Kalahari sour grass.\nEnemies and competitors.\nAcross its range, the leopard coexists with a number of other large predators. In Africa, it is part of a large predator guild with lions, cheetahs, spotted and brown hyenas, and African wild dogs. The leopard is dominant only over the cheetah while the others have the advantage of size, pack numbers or both. Lions pose a great mortal threat and can be responsible for 22% of leopard deaths in Sabi Sand Game Reserve. Spotted hyenas are less threatening but are more likely to steal kills, being the culprits of up to 50% of stolen leopard kills in the same area. To counter this, leopards store their kills in the trees and out of reach. Lions have a high success rate in fetching leopard kills from trees. Leopards do not seem to actively avoid their competitors but rather difference in prey and habitat preferences appear to limit their spatial overlap. In particular, leopards use heavy vegetation regardless of whether lions are present in an area and both cats are active at the same time of day.\nIn Asia, the leopard's main competitors are tigers and dholes. Both the larger tiger and pack-living dhole dominate leopards during encounters. Interactions between the three predators involve chasing, stealing kills and direct killing. Tigers appear to inhabit the deep parts of the forest while leopards and dholes are pushed closer to the fringes. The three predators coexist by hunting different sized prey. In Nagarhole National Park, the average size for a leopard kill was compared to for tigers and for dholes. At Kui Buri National Park, following a reduction in prey numbers, tigers continued to feed on favoured prey while leopards and dholes had to increase their consumption of small prey. Leopards can live successfully in tiger habitat when there is abundant food and vegetation cover. Otherwise, they appear to be less common where tigers are numerous. The recovery of the tiger population in Rajaji National Park during the 2000s led to a reduction in leopard population densities.\nReproduction and life cycle.\nIn some areas, leopards mate all year round. In Manchuria and Siberia, they mate during January and February. On average, females begin to breed between the ages of 2\u00bd and three, and males between the ages of two and three. The female's estrous cycle lasts about 46 days, and she is usually in heat for 6\u20137 days. Gestation lasts for 90 to 105 days. Cubs are usually born in a litter of 2\u20134 cubs. The mortality rate of cubs is estimated at 41\u201350% during the first year. Predators are the biggest cause for leopard cub mortality during their first year. Male leopards are known to cause infanticide, in order to bring the female back into heat. Intervals between births average 15 to 24 months, but can be shorter, depending on the survival of the cubs.\nFemales give birth in a cave, crevice among boulders, hollow tree or thicket. Newborn cubs weigh , and are born with closed eyes, which open four to nine days after birth. The fur of the young tends to be longer and thicker than that of adults. Their pelage is also more gray in colour with less defined spots. They begin to eat meat at around nine weeks. Around three months of age, the young begin to follow the mother on hunts. At one year of age, cubs can probably fend for themselves, but will remain with the mother for 18\u201324 months. After separating from their mother, sibling cubs may travel together for months. Both male and female leopards typically reach sexual maturity at 2\u20132\u2153 years.\nThe generation length of the leopard is 9.3 years.\nThe average life span of a leopard is 12\u201317 years. \nThe oldest leopard was a captive female that died at the age of 24 years, 2 months and 13 days.\nConservation.\nThe leopard is listed on CITES Appendix I, and hunting is banned in Botswana and Afghanistan; in 11 sub-Saharan countries, trade is restricted to skins and body parts of 2,560 individuals.\nIn 2007, a leopard reintroduction programme was initiated in the Russian Caucasus, where captive bred individuals are reared and trained in large enclosures in Sochi National Park; six individuals released into Caucasus Nature Reserve and Alaniya National Park in 2018 survived as of February 2022.\nThreats.\nThe leopard is primarily threatened by habitat fragmentation and conversion of forest to agriculturally used land, which lead to a declining natural prey base, human\u2013wildlife conflict with livestock herders and high leopard mortality rates. It is also threatened by trophy hunting and poaching. Contemporary records suggest that the leopard occurs in only 25% of its historical range.\nBetween 2002 and 2012, at least four leopards were estimated to have been poached per week in India for the illegal wildlife trade of its skins and bones.\nIn spring 2013, 37 leopard skins were found during a 7-week long market survey in major Moroccan cities. In 2014, 43 leopard skins were detected during two surveys in Morocco. Vendors admitted to have imported skins from sub-Saharan Africa.\nSurveys in the Central African Republic's Chinko area revealed that the leopard population decreased from 97 individuals in 2012 to 50 individuals in 2017. In this period, transhumant pastoralists from the border area with Sudan moved in the area with their livestock. Rangers confiscated large amounts of poison in the camps of livestock herders who were accompanied by armed merchants. They engaged in poaching large herbivores, sale of bushmeat and trading leopard skins in Am Dafok.\nIn Java, the leopard is threatened by illegal hunting and trade. Between 2011 and 2019, body parts of 51 Javan leopards were seized including six live individuals, 12 skins, 13 skulls, 20 canines and 22 claws.\nHuman relations.\nCultural significance.\nLeopards have been featured in art, mythology and folklore of many countries. In Greek mythology, it was a symbol of the god Dionysus, who was depicted wearing leopard skin and using leopards as means of transportation. In one myth, the god was captured by pirates but two leopards rescued him. Numerous Roman mosaics from North African sites depict fauna now found only in tropical Africa. During the Benin Empire, the leopard was commonly represented on engravings and sculptures and was used to symbolise the power of the king or \"oba\", since the leopard was considered the king of the forest. The Ashanti people also used the leopard as a symbol of leadership, and only the king was permitted to have a ceremonial leopard stool. Some African cultures considered the leopard to be a smarter, better hunter than the lion and harder to kill.\nIn Rudyard Kipling's \"How the Leopard Got His Spots\", one of his \"Just So Stories\", a leopard with no spots in the Highveld lives with his hunting partner, the Ethiopian. When they set off to the forest, the Ethiopian changed his brown skin, and the leopard painted spots on his skin. A leopard played an important role in the 1938 Hollywood film \"Bringing Up Baby\". African chiefs, European queens, Hollywood actors and burlesque dancers wore coats made of leopard skins.\nThe leopard is a frequently used motif in heraldry, most commonly as \"passant\". The heraldic leopard lacks spots and sports a mane, making it visually almost identical to the heraldic lion, and the two are often used interchangeably. Naturalistic leopard-like depictions appear on the coat of arms of Benin, Malawi, Somalia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Gabon, the last of which uses a black panther.\nAttacks on people.\nThe Leopard of Rudraprayag killed more than 125 people; the Panar Leopard was thought to have killed over 400 people. Both were shot by British hunter Jim Corbett. The \"spotted devil of Gummalapur\" killed about 42 people in Karnataka, India.\nIn captivity.\nThe ancient Romans kept leopards in captivity to be slaughtered in hunts as well as execute criminals. In Benin, leopards were kept and paraded as mascots, totems and sacrifices to deities. Several leopards were kept in a menagerie originally established by King John of England at the Tower of London in the 13th century; around 1235, three of these animals were given to Henry III by Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II. In modern times, leopards have been trained and tamed in circuses.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Although dead by the time the Vandal Kingdom was overthrown in 534, he nevertheless played a key role in that event.\nLife.\nHilderic was the grandson of king Gaiseric, founder of the Vandal kingdom in Africa. His father was Gaiseric's son Huneric, and his mother was Eudocia, the daughter of the Roman Emperor Valentinian III and Licinia Eudoxia. Most of the Vandals were Arians and had persecuted Chalcedonians, but Hilderic favored Chalcedonianism as the religion of his mother, making his accession to the throne controversial. Soon after becoming king, Hilderic had his predecessor's widow, Amalafrida, imprisoned; he escaped war with her brother, the Gothic king Theoderic the Great, only by virtue of the latter's death in 526.\nHilderic's reign was noteworthy for the kingdom's excellent relations with the Eastern Roman Empire. Procopius writes that he was \"a very particular friend and guest-friend of Justinian, who had not yet come to the throne\", noting that Hilderic and Justinian exchanged large presents of money to each other. Hilderic allowed a new Chalcedonian bishop to take office in the Vandal capital of Carthage, and many Vandals began to convert to Chalcedonianism, to the alarm of the Vandal nobility.\nBy the time he assumed the crown, Hilderic was at least into his fifties, if not more than 60. For this reason, according to Procopius, he was uninterested in the military operations of the Vandals and left them to other family members, of whom Procopius singles out for mention his nephew Hoamer.\nAfter seven years on the throne, on the 15th of June, 530, Hilderic fell victim to a revolt led by his cousin Gelimer. Gelimer then became King of the Vandals and Alans, and restored Arianism as the official religion of the kingdom. He imprisoned Hilderic, along with Hoamer and his brother Euagees, but did not kill him. Justinian protested Gelimer's actions, demanding that Gelimer return the kingdom to Hilderic. Gelimer sent away the envoys who brought him this message, blinding Hoamer and putting both Hilderic and Euagees under closer confinement, claiming that they had planned a coup against him. When Justinian sent a second embassy protesting these developments, Gelimer replied, in effect, that Justinian had no authority to make these demands. Angered at this response, Justinian quickly concluded his ongoing war with the Sassanian Empire and prepared an expedition against the Vandals in 533. Once Gelimer learned of the arrival of the Roman army, he had Hilderic murdered, along with Euagees and other supporters of Hilderic he had imprisoned.\nAccording to later legend, Hilderic had a daughter, Hildis, who through her legendary son Halfdan the Old was an ancestor of Ragnar Lodbrok and his descendants.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "44305", "revid": "19014806", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44305", "title": "Pap test", "text": "Cervical screening test to detect potential cancers\nThe Papanicolaou test (abbreviated as Pap test, also known as Pap smear (AE), cervical smear (BE), cervical screening (BE), or smear test (BE)) is a method of cervical screening used to detect potentially precancerous and cancerous processes in the cervix (opening of the uterus or womb) or, more rarely, anus (in both men and women). Abnormal findings are often followed up by more sensitive diagnostic procedures and, if warranted, interventions that aim to prevent progression to cervical cancer. The test was independently invented in the 1920s by the Greek physician Georgios Papanikolaou and named after him. A simplified version of the test was introduced by the Canadian obstetrician Anna Marion Hilliard in 1957.\nA Pap smear is performed by opening the vagina with a speculum and collecting cells at the outer opening of the cervix at the transformation zone (where the outer squamous cervical cells meet the inner glandular endocervical cells), using an Ayre spatula or a cytobrush. The collected cells are examined under a microscope to look for abnormalities. The test aims to detect potentially precancerous changes (called cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or cervical dysplasia; the squamous intraepithelial lesion system (SIL) is also used to describe abnormalities) caused by human papillomavirus, a sexually transmitted DNA virus. The test remains an effective, widely used method for early detection of precancer and cervical cancer. While the test may also detect infections and abnormalities in the endocervix and endometrium, it is not designed to do so.\nGuidelines on when to begin Pap smear screening are varied, but usually begin in adulthood. Guidelines on frequency vary from every three to five years. If results are abnormal, and depending on the nature of the abnormality, the test may need to be repeated in six to twelve months. If the abnormality requires closer scrutiny, the patient may be referred for detailed inspection of the cervix by colposcopy, which magnifies the view of the cervix, vagina and vulva surfaces. The person may also be referred for HPV DNA testing, which can serve as an adjunct to Pap testing. In some countries, viral DNA is checked for first, before checking for abnormal cells. Additional biomarkers that may be applied as ancillary tests with the Pap test are evolving.\nMedical uses.\nScreening guidelines vary from country to country. In general, screening starts about the age of 20 or 25 and continues until about the age of 50 or 60. Screening is typically recommended every three to five years, as long as results are normal.\nAmerican Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and others recommend starting screening at age 21. Many other countries wait until age 25 or later to start screening. For instance, some parts of Great Britain start screening at age 25. ACOG's general recommendation is that people with female reproductive organs age 30\u201365 have an annual well-woman examination, that they not get annual Pap tests, and that they do get Pap tests at three to five year intervals.\nHPV is passed through skin to skin contact; sex does not have to occur, although it is a common way for it to spread. It takes an average of a year, but can take up to four years, for a person's immune system to clear the initial infection. Screening during this period may show this immune reaction and repair as mild abnormalities, which are usually not associated with cervical cancer, but could cause the patient stress and result in further tests and possible treatment. Cervical cancer usually takes time to develop, so delaying the start of screening a few years poses little risk of missing a potentially precancerous lesion. For instance, screening people under age 25 does not decrease cancer rates under age 30.\nHPV can be transmitted in sex between females, so those who have only had sex with other females should be screened, although they are at somewhat lower risk for cervical cancer.\nGuidelines on frequency of screening vary\u2014typically every three to five years for those who have not had previous abnormal smears. Some older recommendations suggested screening as frequently as every one to two years, however there is little evidence to support such frequent screening; annual screening has little benefit but leads to greatly increased cost and many unnecessary procedures and treatments. It has been acknowledged since before 1980 that most people can be screened less often. In some guidelines, frequency depends on age; for instance in Great Britain, screening is recommended every three years for women under 50, and every five years for those over.\nScreening should stop at about age 65 unless there is a history of abnormal test result or disease. There is probably no benefit in screening people aged 60 or over whose previous tests have been negative. If a woman's last three Pap results were normal, she can discontinue testing at age 65, according to the USPSTF, ACOG, ACS, and ASCP; England's NHS says 64. There is no need to continue screening after a complete hysterectomy for benign disease.\nPap smear screening is still recommended for those who have been vaccinated against HPV since the vaccines do not cover all HPV types that can cause cervical cancer. Also, the vaccine does not protect against HPV exposure before vaccination.\nThose with a history of endometrial cancer should discontinue routine Pap tests after hysterectomy. Further tests are unlikely to detect recurrence of cancer but do bring the risk of giving false positive results, which would lead to unnecessary further testing.\nMore frequent Pap smears may be needed to follow up after an abnormal Pap smear, after treatment for abnormal Pap or biopsy results, or after treatment of cancer (cervical, anal, etc.).\nEffectiveness.\nThe Pap test, when combined with a regular program of screening and appropriate follow-up, can reduce cervical cancer deaths by up to 80%.\nFailure of prevention of cancer by the Pap test can occur for many reasons, including not getting regular screening, lack of appropriate follow-up of abnormal results, and sampling and interpretation errors. In the US, over half of all invasive cancers occur in females who have never had a Pap smear; an additional 10 to 20% of cancers occur in those who have not had a Pap smear in the preceding five years. About one-quarter of US cervical cancers were in people who had an abnormal Pap smear but did not get appropriate follow-up (patient did not return for care, or clinician did not perform recommended tests or treatment).\nAdenocarcinoma of the cervix has not been shown to be prevented by Pap smears. In the UK, which has a Pap smear screening program, adenocarcinoma accounts for about 15% of all cervical cancers.\nEstimates of the effectiveness of the United Kingdom's call and recall system vary widely, but it may prevent about 700 deaths per year in the UK.\nMultiple studies have performed sensitivity and specificity analyses on Pap smears. Sensitivity analysis captures the ability of Pap smears to correctly identify women with cervical cancer. Various studies have revealed the sensitivity of Pap smears to be between 47.19 - 55.5%. Specificity analysis captures the ability of Pap smears to correctly identify women without cervical cancer. Various studies have revealed the specificity of Pap smears to be between 64.79 - 96.8%. While Pap smears may not be entirely accurate, they remain one of the most effective cervical cancer prevention tools. Pap smears may be supplemented with HPV DNA testing.\nResults.\nIn screening a general or low-risk population, most Pap results are normal.\nIn the United States, about 2\u20133 million abnormal Pap smear results are found each year. Most abnormal results are mildly abnormal (ASC-US (typically 2\u20135% of Pap results) or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) (about 2% of results)), indicating HPV infection. Although most low-grade cervical dysplasias spontaneously regress without ever leading to cervical cancer, dysplasia can serve as an indication that increased vigilance is needed.\nIn a typical scenario, about 0.5% of Pap results are high-grade SIL (HSIL), and less than 0.5% of results indicate cancer; 0.2 to 0.8% of results indicate Atypical Glandular Cells of Undetermined Significance (AGC-NOS).\nAs liquid-based preparations (LBPs) become a common medium for testing, atypical result rates have increased. The median rate for all preparations with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions using LBPs was 2.9% in 2006, compared with a 2003 median rate of 2.1%. Rates for high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (median, 0.5%) and atypical squamous cells have changed little.\nAbnormal results are reported according to the Bethesda system. They include:\nEndocervical and endometrial abnormalities can also be detected, as can a number of infectious processes, including yeast, herpes simplex virus and trichomoniasis. However it is not very sensitive at detecting these infections, so absence of detection on a Pap does not mean absence of the infection.\nPregnancy.\nPap tests can usually be performed during pregnancy up to at least 24 weeks of gestational age. Pap tests during pregnancy have not been associated with increased risk of miscarriage. An inflammatory component is commonly seen on Pap smears from pregnant women and does not appear to be a risk for subsequent preterm birth.\nAfter childbirth, it is recommended to wait 12 weeks before taking a Pap test because inflammation of the cervix caused by the birth interferes with test interpretation.\nIn transgender individuals.\nTransgender men are also typically at risk for HPV due to retention of the uterine cervix in the majority of individuals in this subgroup. As such, professional guidelines recommend that transgender men be screened routinely for cervical cancer using methods such as Pap smear, identical to the recommendations for cisgender women.\nHowever, transgender men have lower rates of cervical cancer screening than cisgender women. Many transgender men report barriers to receiving gender-affirming healthcare, including lack of insurance coverage and stigma/discrimination during clinical encounters, and may encounter provider misconceptions regarding risk in this population for cervical cancer. Pap smears may be presented to patients as non-gendered screening procedures for cancer rather than one specific for examination of the female reproductive organs. Pap smears may trigger gender dysphoria in patients and gender-neutral language can be used when explaining the pathogenesis of cancer due to infection, emphasizing the pervasiveness of HPV infection regardless of gender.\nTransgender women who have not had vaginoplasties are not at risk of developing cervical cancer because they do not have cervices. Transgender women who have had vaginoplasties and have a neo-cervix or neo-vagina have a small chance of developing cancer, according to the Canadian Cancer Society. Surgeons typically use penile skin to create the new vagina and cervix, which can contract HPV and lead to penile cancer, although it is considerably rarer than cervical cancer. Because the risk of this kind of cancer is so low, cervical cancer screening is not routinely offered for those with a neo-cervix.\nProcedure.\nAccording to the CDC, intercourse, douching, and the use of vaginal medicines or spermicidal foam should be avoided for 2 days before the test. A number of studies have shown that using a small amount of water-based gel lubricant does not interfere with, obscure, or distort the Pap smear. Further, cytology is not affected, nor are some STD testing. The CDC states that Pap smears can be performed during menstruation. However, the NHS recommends against cervical screening during, or in the 2 days before and after, menstruation. Pap smears can be performed during menstruation, especially if the physician is using a liquid-based test; however if bleeding is extremely heavy, endometrial cells can obscure cervical cells, and if this occurs the test may need to be repeated in 6 months.\nPap smears begin with the insertion of a speculum into the vagina, which spreads the vagina open and allows access to the cervix. The health care provider then collects a sample of cells from the outer opening or external os of the cervix by scraping it with either a spatula or brush.\nObtaining a Pap smear should not cause much pain, but may be uncomfortable. Conditions such as vaginismus, vulvodynia, or cervical stenosis can cause insertion of the speculum to be painful.\nIn a conventional Pap smear, the cells are placed on a glass slide and taken to the laboratory to be checked for abnormalities.\nA plastic-fronded broom is sometimes used in place of the spatula or brush. The broom is not as good a collection device, since it is much less effective at collecting endocervical material than the spatula and brush. The broom is used more frequently with the advent of liquid-based cytology, although either type of collection device may be used with either type of cytology.\nThe sample is stained using the Papanicolaou technique, in which tinctorial dyes and acids are selectively retained by cells. Unstained cells cannot be seen adequately with a light microscope. Papanicolaou chose stains that highlighted cytoplasmic keratinization, which actually has almost nothing to do with the nuclear features used to make diagnoses now.\nA single smear has an area of 25 x 50\u00a0mm and contains a few hundred thousand cells on average. Screening with light microscopy is first done on low (10x) power and then switched to higher (40x) power upon viewing suspicious findings. Cells are analyzed under high power for morphologic changes indicative of malignancy (including enlarged and irregularly shaped nucleus, an increase in nucleus to cytoplasm ratio, and more coarse and irregular chromatin). Approximately 1,000 fields of view are required on 10x power for screening of a single sample, which takes on average 5 to 10 minutes.\nIn some cases, a computer system may prescreen the slides, indicating those that do not need examination by a person or highlighting areas for special attention. The sample is then usually screened by a specially trained and qualified cytotechnologist using a light microscope. The terminology for who screens the sample varies according to the country; in the UK, the personnel are known as cytoscreeners, biomedical scientists (BMS), advanced practitioners and pathologists. The latter two take responsibility for reporting the abnormal sample, which may require further investigation.\nAutomated analysis.\nSince the early 2000s, there have been successful attempts to develop automated, computer image analysis systems for screening. Although, on the available evidence, automated cervical screening could not be recommended for implementation into a national screening program, an NHS Health technology appraisal in 2005 concluded that the \"general case for automated image analysis ha(d) probably been made\". Automation may improve sensitivity and reduce unsatisfactory specimens. Two systems have been approved by the FDA and function in high-volume reference laboratories, with human oversight.\nTypes of screening.\nPap tests commonly examine epithelial abnormalities, such as metaplasia, dysplasia, or borderline changes, all of which may be indicative of CIN. Nuclei will stain dark blue, squamous cells will stain green and keratinised cells will stain pink/ orange. Koilocytes may be observed where there is some dyskaryosis (of epithelium). The nucleus in koilocytes is typically irregular, indicating possible cause for concern; requiring further confirmatory screens and tests.\nIn addition, human papillomavirus (HPV) test may be performed either as indicated for abnormal Pap results, or in some cases, dual testing is done, where both a Pap smear and an HPV test are done at the same time (also called Pap co-testing).\nPractical aspects.\nThe endocervix may be partially sampled with the device used to obtain the ectocervical sample, but due to the anatomy of this area, consistent and reliable sampling cannot be guaranteed. Since abnormal endocervical cells may be sampled, those examining them are taught to recognize them.\nThe endometrium is not directly sampled with the device used to sample the ectocervix. Cells may exfoliate onto the cervix and be collected from there, so as with endocervical cells, abnormal cells can be recognised if present but the Pap test should not be used as a screening tool for endometrial malignancy.\nIn the United States, a Pap test itself costs $20 to $30, but the costs for Pap test visits can cost over $1,000, largely because additional tests are added that may or may not be necessary.\nHistory.\nThe test was invented by and named after the Greek doctor Georgios Papanikolaou, who started his research in 1923. Aurel Babe\u0219 independently made similar discoveries in 1927. However, Babe\u0219' method was radically different from Papanikolaou's.\nThe Pap test was finally recognized only after a leading article in the \"American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology\" in 1941 by Papanikolaou and Herbert F. Traut, an American gynecologist. A monograph titled \"Diagnosis of Uterine Cancer by the Vaginal Smear\" that they published contained drawings of the various cells seen in patients with no disease, inflammatory conditions, and preclinical and clinical carcinoma. The monograph was illustrated by Hashime Murayama, who later became a staff illustrator with the National Geographic Society. Both Papanikolaou and his wife, Andromachi Papanikolaou, dedicated the rest of their lives to teaching the technique to other physicians and laboratory personnel.\nExperimental techniques.\nIn the developed world, cervical biopsy guided by colposcopy is considered the \"gold standard\" for diagnosing cervical abnormalities after an abnormal Pap smear. Other techniques such as triple smear are also done after an abnormal Pap smear. The procedure requires a trained colposcopist and can be expensive to perform. However, Pap smears are very sensitive and some negative biopsy results may represent undersampling of the lesion in the biopsy, so negative biopsy with positive cytology requires careful follow-up.\nExperimental visualization techniques use broad-band light (e.g., direct visualization, speculoscopy, cervicography, visual inspection with acetic acid or with Lugol's, and colposcopy) and electronic detection methods (e.g., Polarprobe and \"in vivo\" spectroscopy). These techniques are less expensive and can be performed with significantly less training. They do not perform as well as Pap smear screening and colposcopy. At this point, these techniques have not been validated by large-scale trials and are not in general use.\nImplementation by country.\nAustralia.\nAustralia has used the Pap test as part of its cervical screening program since its implementation in 1991 which required women past the age of 18 be tested every two years. In December 2017 Australia discontinued its use of the Pap test and replaced it with a new HPV test that is only required to be conducted once every five years from the age of 25. Medicare covers the costs of testing; however, if a patient's doctor does not allow bulk billing, they may have to pay for the appointment and then claim the Medicare rebate.\nTaiwan.\nFree Pap tests were offered from 1974\u20131984 before being replaced by a system in which all women over the age of 30 could have the cost of their Pap test reimbursed by the National Health Insurance in 1995. This policy was still ongoing in 2018 and encouraged women to screen at least every three years.\nDespite this, the number of people receiving Pap tests remain lower than countries like Australia. Some believe this is due to a lack of awareness regarding the test and its availability. It has also been found that women who have chronic diseases or other reproductive diseases are less likely to receive the test.\nEngland.\nAs of 2020[ [update]] the NHS maintains a cervical screening program in which women between the age of 25\u201349 are invited for a smear test every three years, and women past 50 every five years. Much like Australia, England uses a HPV test before examining cells that test positive using the Pap test. The test is free as part of the national cervical screening program.\nCoccoid bacteria.\nThe finding of coccoid bacteria on a Pap test is of no consequence with otherwise normal test findings and no infectious symptoms. However, if there is enough inflammation to obscure the detection of precancerous and cancerous processes, it may indicate treatment with a broad-spectrum antibiotic for streptococci and anaerobic bacteria (such as metronidazole and amoxicillin) before repeating the smear. Alternatively, the test will be repeated at an earlier time than it would otherwise. If there are symptoms of vaginal discharge, bad odor or irritation, the presence of coccoid bacteria also may indicate treatment with antibiotics as per above.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "44307", "revid": "49369565", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44307", "title": "Michel de Montaigne", "text": "French author, philosopher, and statesman (1533\u20131592)\nMichel Eyquem, Seigneur de Montaigne ( ; ; ; 28 February 1533\u00a0\u2013 13 September 1592), commonly known as Michel de Montaigne, was one of the most significant philosophers of the French Renaissance. He is known for popularising the essay as a literary genre. His work is noted for its merging of casual anecdotes and autobiography with intellectual insight. Montaigne had a direct influence on numerous writers of Western literature; his \"Essais\" contain some of the most influential essays ever written.\nDuring his lifetime, Montaigne was admired more as a statesman than as an author. The tendency in his essays to digress into anecdotes and personal ruminations was seen as detrimental to proper style, rather than as an innovation; moreover, his declaration that \"I am myself the matter of my book\" was viewed by his contemporaries as self-indulgent. In time, however, Montaigne came to be recognised as embodying the spirit of critical thought and open inquiry that began to emerge around that time. He is best known for his sceptical remark, \"\" (\"What do I know?\", in Middle French; \"\" in modern French).\nBiography.\nFamily, childhood and education.\nMontaigne was born in the Guyenne (Aquitaine) region of France, on the family estate Ch\u00e2teau de Montaigne in a town now called Saint-Michel-de-Montaigne, near Bordeaux. The family was very wealthy. His great-grandfather Ramon Felipe Eyquem had made a fortune as a herring merchant and had bought the estate in 1477, thereby becoming the Lord of Montaigne. His father, Pierre Eyquem, Seigneur of Montaigne, was the mayor of Bordeaux and later a French Catholic soldier in Italy for a time.\nAlthough there were several families having the patronym \"Eyquem\" in Guyenne, his father's family is thought to have had some degree of Marrano (Spanish and Portuguese Jewish) origins, while his mother, Antoinette L\u00f3pez de Villanueva, was a convert to Protestantism. His maternal grandfather, Pedro L\u00f3pez, from Zaragoza, came from a wealthy Marrano (Sephardic Jewish) family that had converted to Catholicism. His maternal grandmother, Honorette Dupuy, was from a Catholic family in Gascony, France.\nAlthough Montaigne's mother lived nearby for much of his life \u2013 and even outlived him \u2013 she is mentioned only twice in his essays. Montaigne's relationship with his father, however, is often reflected on and discussed in the essays.\nMontaigne's education began in early childhood and followed a pedagogical plan that his father had developed, refined by the advice of the latter's humanist friends. Soon after his birth, Montaigne was brought to a small cottage, where he lived for three years in the sole company of a peasant family; according to the elder Montaigne, this was to \"draw the boy close to the people, and to the life conditions of the people, who need our help\". After these first spartan years, Montaigne was returned to the ch\u00e2teau.\nAnother pedagogical objective was for Latin to become Montaigne's first language. His intellectual education was assigned to a German tutor (a doctor named Horstanus, who did not speak French). His father hired only servants who could speak Latin, and they also were given strict orders always to speak to the boy in Latin. The same rule applied to his mother, father, and servants, who were obliged to use only Latin words that he employed; thus they acquired a knowledge of the language that Montaigne's tutor taught him. His Latin education was accompanied by constant intellectual and spiritual stimulation. He was acquainted with Greek through a pedagogical method that employed games, conversation, and exercises with solitary meditation, rather than more traditional books.\nThe atmosphere of his upbringing engendered in Montaigne a spirit of \"liberty and delight\" that he would later describe as making him \"relish...duty by an unforced will, and of my own voluntary motion...without any severity or constraint\". His father instructed a musician to wake him every morning, playing one instrument or another; an \"epinettier\" (a player of a type of zither) was a constant companion to Montaigne and his tutor, playing tunes to alleviate boredom and tiredness.\nAround 1539, Montaigne was sent to study at a highly-regarded boarding school in Bordeaux, the College of Guienne, then under the direction of the greatest Latin scholar of the era, George Buchanan; there Montaigne mastered the entire curriculum by the age of thirteen. He finished the first phase of his studies at the College in 1546. He then began to study law and entered a career in the local legal system. (His alma mater remains unknown, since little is certain about his activities from 1546 to 1557.)\nCareer.\nMontaigne was a councillor of the Court des Aides of P\u00e9rigueux, and in 1557 he was appointed councillor of the Parlement in Bordeaux, a high court. From 1561 to 1563, he was a courtier at the court of Charles IX, and he was with the king at the siege of Rouen (1562). He was awarded the highest honour of the French nobility, the collar of the Order of Saint Michael.\nFriendship with Etienne de La Bo\u00e9tie.\nWhile serving at the Bordeaux Parlement, he became a close friend of the humanist poet \u00c9tienne de La Bo\u00e9tie, whose death in 1563 deeply affected Montaigne. Donald M. Frame, in the introduction to his book \"The Complete Essays of Montaigne,\" makes the following suggestion: because of Montaigne's \"imperious need to communicate\" after losing \u00c9tienne, he began the \"Essais\" as a new \"means of communication\", and \"the reader takes the place of the dead friend\".\nThe most significant event of this period in Montaigne's life was his meeting, at the age of 25, with \u00c9tienne de La Bo\u00e9tie. At the time, La Bo\u00e9tie was serving in the Parliament of Bordeaux. He was 28 years old\u2014and would die at 32. Orphaned early, married, and entrusted with sensitive political missions by his colleagues (notably the pacification of Guyenne during the 1561 unrest), he was more mature and more established than Montaigne. His best-known work is \"Discourse on Voluntary Servitude\". Montaigne had initially intended to include it in the \"Essays\", but refrained when Protestant circles began interpreting the work as an attack on the Catholic monarchy.\nMontaigne and La Bo\u00e9tie's friendship became legendary. In the first edition of the \"Essays\", Montaigne wrote:\n \"If you press me to say why I loved him, I can say no more than because it was he, because it was I.\"\nThis famous phrase appeared in the posthumous 1595 edition known as the \"Bordeaux Copy.\" Montaigne had added it in the margins of his personal 1588 edition\u2014first \"because it was he,\" then in different ink, \"because it was I.\"\nAlthough sociable and surrounded by many friends, Montaigne considered this friendship exceptional\u2014one that only occurs \"once every three centuries\":\n \"Our souls mingled and blended with each other so completely that they effaced the seam that had joined them.\"\nMontaigne's admiration for La Bo\u00e9tie's intellectual greatness was matched by deep cultural affinities and a shared ideological harmony, especially in the context of the French Wars of Religion.\n \"The greatest man I have known... for the natural goodness and capacity of his soul and for a well-born upbringing, was \u00c9tienne de La Bo\u00e9tie. It was truly a full soul, and of a beautiful composition in every respect; a classical soul, which would have produced great achievements if fate had allowed it. For it had enriched those fine natural gifts with study and learning.\"\nBut just four years after their meeting, La Bo\u00e9tie died\u2014likely of plague or tuberculosis\u2014in 1563. During his three days of agony, he displayed a strength of soul that deeply moved Montaigne. Montaigne first described this in a letter to his father, then in a \"Discourse\" published in 1571 as a postface to La Bo\u00e9tie's collected works.\n \"There is no action or thought in which I do not miss him. I was already so habituated and accustomed to being second everywhere, that it seems to me I am no longer whole.\"\nMontaigne then sought to perpetuate his friend's memory\u2014first by publishing his writings addressed to prominent figures, and then by continuing their dialogue internally, a dialogue that would ultimately become the \"Essays\".\nMarriage.\nMontaigne married Fran\u00e7oise de la Cassaigne in 1565, probably in an arranged marriage. She was the daughter and niece of wealthy merchants in Toulouse and Bordeaux. The couple had six daughters, but only the second-born, L\u00e9onor, survived infancy. He wrote very little about the relationship with his wife, and little is known about their marriage. Of his daughter L\u00e9onor, he wrote: \"All my children die at nurse; but L\u00e9onore, our only daughter, who has escaped this misfortune, has reached the age of six and more, without having been punished, the indulgence of her mother aiding, except in words, and those very gentle ones.\" His daughter married Fran\u00e7ois de la Tour and later Charles de Gamaches. She had a daughter with each husband.\nWriting.\nAfter a request from his father, Montaigne began work on the first translation of the Catalan monk Raymond Sebond's book \"Theologia naturalis\" (\"Natural Theology\"), which he published a year after his father's death in 1568. In 1595, Sebond's Prologue was put on the \"Index Librorum Prohibitorum\" (\"Index of Forbidden Books\"), because of its declaration that the Bible is not the only source of revealed truth. Montaigne also published a posthumous edition of the works of his friend Bo\u00e9tie.\nIn 1570, he moved back to the family estate, the Ch\u00e2teau de Montaigne, which he had inherited. He thus became the Lord of Montaigne. Around this time, he was seriously injured in a riding accident on the ch\u00e2teau grounds, when one of his mounted companions collided with him at full speed, throwing Montaigne from his horse and briefly knocking him unconscious. His recovery took weeks or months, and this close brush with death apparently affected him greatly, as he discussed it at length in writings during the following years. Soon after the accident, he relinquished his magistracy in Bordeaux; his first child was born (and died a few months later); and by 1571, he had completely retired from public life to the tower of the ch\u00e2teau \u2013 his so-called \"citadel\" \u2013 where he almost fully isolated himself from all social and family matters. Sealed in his library, which contained a collection of some 1,500 volumes, he began work on the writings that would later be compiled into his \"Essais\" (\"Essays\"), first published in 1580. On the day of his 38th birthday, as he began this almost ten-year period of self-imposed seclusion, he had the following inscription placed on the crown of the bookshelves in his work chamber:\nIn the year of Christ 1571, at the age of thirty-eight, on the last day of February, his birthday, Michael de Montaigne, long weary of the servitude of the court and of public employments, while still entire, retired to the bosom of the learned virgins, where in calm and freedom from all cares he will spend what little remains of his life, now more than half run out. If the fates permit, he will complete this abode, this sweet ancestral retreat; and he has consecrated it to his freedom, tranquility, and leisure.\nTravels.\nDuring the Wars of Religion in France, Montaigne, a Roman Catholic, acted as a moderating force; he was respected both by the Catholic King Henry III and the Protestant Henry of Navarre, who later converted to Catholicism.\nIn 1578, Montaigne, whose health had always been excellent, began to suffer from painful kidney stones, a tendency he had inherited from his father's family. Throughout this illness, he avoided doctors and drugs. From 1580 to 1581, Montaigne traveled in France, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and Italy \u2013 partly in search of a cure \u2013 establishing himself at the commune of Bagni di Lucca in Italy, where he visited the springs. His journey was also a pilgrimage to the Holy House of Loreto, to which he donated a silver relief, considering himself fortunate that it would be hung on a wall in the shrine; the relief depicted his wife, their daughter, and him kneeling before the Madonna. He maintained a journal in which he recorded regional differences and customs, in addition to a variety of personal episodes, including the dimensions of the kidney stones that he succeeded in expelling. This journal was published nearly two hundred years later, in 1774, after its discovery in a trunk displayed in his tower.\nDuring a visit to the Vatican that Montaigne described in his journal, the \"Essais\" were examined by Sisto Fabri, who served as Master of the Sacred Palace under Pope Gregory XIII. After Fabri examined the \"Essais\", the text was returned to Montaigne on 20 March 1581. Montaigne had apologised for references to the pagan concept of \"fortuna\", as well as for writing favorably about Julian the Apostate and heretical poets; Montaigne was released to follow his own conscience in making alterations to the text.\nLater career.\nWhile in the city of Lucca in 1581, Montaigne learned that he had been elected mayor of Bordeaux, like his father before him. He therefore returned to the city and served in this office. He was re-elected in 1583 and served until 1585, again moderating between Catholics and Protestants. The bubonic plague pandemic broke out in Bordeaux toward the end of his second term in office, in 1585. In 1586, the plague and the French Wars of Religion prompted him to leave his ch\u00e2teau for two years.\nMontaigne continued to extend, revise, and oversee the publication of the \"Essais\". In 1588, he wrote its third book; he also met Marie de Gournay, an author who admired his work, and who later edited and published it. Montaigne later referred to her as his adopted daughter.\nWhen King Henry III was assassinated in 1589, Montaigne was anxious to promote a compromise that would end the bloodshed, despite his aversion to the cause of the Reformation; he therefore supported Henry of Navarre, who would later become King Henry IV. Montaigne's position associated him with the \"politiques\", the establishment movement that prioritised peace, national unity, and royal authority over religious allegiance.\nDeath.\nMontaigne died in 1592 at the age of 59, at the Ch\u00e2teau de Montaigne, from a peritonsillar abscess. In his case, the disease \"brought about paralysis of the tongue\", especially difficult for a person who once said that \"the most fruitful and natural play of the mind is conversation. I find it sweeter than any other action in life; and if I were forced to choose, I think I would rather lose my sight than my hearing and voice.\" Remaining in possession of all his other faculties, he requested a Mass, and he died during the celebration of that Mass.\nMontaigne was buried near the ch\u00e2teau. His remains were later moved to the church of Saint Antoine at Bordeaux. This church no longer exists \u2013 it became the Convent des Feuillants, which has since disappeared as well.\n\"Essais\".\nMontaigne's humanism is expressed in his \"Essais (\"published in 1580), a large collection of short, subjective essays on various topics; these essays were inspired by his studies in the classics, especially the works of Plutarch and Lucretius. Montaigne's stated goal was to describe humans, and especially himself, with complete frankness.\nInspired by considering the lives and ideals of leading figures of his age, Montaigne finds the most basic feature of human nature to be its great variety and volatility. He describes his own poor memory; his ability to solve problems and mediate conflicts without getting deeply involved emotionally; his disdain for the human pursuit of enduring fame; and his attempts to detach himself from worldly things to prepare for his approaching death. He also writes about his disgust with the religious conflicts of the time. He believed that humans are unable to attain true certainty. The longest of his essays, \"Apology for Raymond Sebond\", marks his adoption of Pyrrhonism and contains the famous motto, \"What do I know?\"\nMontaigne considered marriage necessary for raising children, but he disliked feelings of passionate love, because he saw them as detrimental to freedom. In education, he favored concrete examples and experience over abstract knowledge that is intended to be accepted uncritically. His essay \"On the Education of Children\" is dedicated to Diana of Foix.\nThe \"Essais\" exerted a significant influence on both French and English literature, shaping thought as well as style. Francis Bacon's \"Essays\", published more than a decade later (first in 1597), are usually assumed to reflect direct influence by Montaigne's collection, and Montaigne is cited by Bacon alongside other classical sources in later essays.\nMontaigne's influence on psychology.\nAlthough not a scientist, Montaigne made observations on topics in psychology. In the essays, he developed and explained his observations on these themes. His thoughts and ideas covered subjects such as thought, motivation, fear, happiness, child education, experience, and human action. Montaigne's ideas have influenced psychology and are a part of its rich history.\nChild education.\nAmong the psychological topics that Montaigne addressed was the education of children. His essays \"On the Education of Children\", \"On Pedantry\", and \"On Experience\" explain his views on this subject. Some of these views are still relevant today.\nMontaigne's views on child education were in opposition to common practices during his time. He found fault with both the content and the style of teaching. Much education at the time focused on reading the classics and learning through books. Montaigne disagreed with learning only through books. He believed that children must be educated in a variety of ways. He also disagreed with the way that information was presented to students \u2013 encouraging them to take educational content as absolute truth. Students were denied an opportunity to question information. By contrast, Montaigne generally believed that effective learning required a student to take new information and make it their own:Let the tutor make his charge pass everything through a sieve and lodge nothing in his head on mere authority and trust: let not Aristotle's principles be principles to him any more than those of the Stoics or Epicureans. Let this variety of ideas be set before him; he will choose if he can; if not, he will remain in doubt. Only the fools are certain and assured. \"For doubting pleases me no less than knowing.\" [Dante]. For if he embraces Xenophon's and Plato's opinions by his own reasoning, they will no longer be theirs, they will be his. He who follows another follows nothing. He finds nothing; indeed he seeks nothing. \"We are not under a king; let each one claim his own freedom.\" [Seneca]. ... He must imbibe their way of thinking, not learn their precepts. And let him boldly forget, if he wants, where he got them, but let him know how to make them his own. Truth and reason are common to everyone, and no more belong to the man who first spoke them than to the man who says them later. It is no more according to Plato than according to me, since he and I see it in the same way. The bees plunder the flowers here and there, but afterward they make of them honey, which is all and purely their own, and no longer thyme and marjoram.Fundamentally, Montaigne believed that the selection of a good tutor was important for a student's becoming well educated. Education by a tutor should be conducted at the student's pace. Montaigne believed that a tutor should be in dialogue with a student, allowing the student to speak first. A tutor also should allow for discussion and debate. Such dialogue was meant to create an environment in which students would teach themselves. They would be able to recognize their own mistakes and correct them as needed:\nLet him be made to understand that to confess the flaw he discovers in his own argument, though it be still unnoticed except by himself, is an act of judgment and sincerity, which are principal qualities he seeks\u2026 that to change his mind and correct himself, to give up a bad position at the height of his ardor are rare, strong, and philosophical qualities.\nIndividualised learning was integral to his theory of child education. He argued that a student combines previously-known information with what is newly learned, and thereby forms a unique perspective on the new information. Montaigne also believed that tutors should encourage student's natural curiosity and allow them to question things. He postulated that successful students were encouraged to question new information and study it for themselves, rather than merely accepting what they had heard from experts on a given topic. Montaigne believed that a child's curiosity could serve as an important teaching tool when the child is allowed to explore subjects that genuinely interest them.\nIn addition, Montaigne believed that experience was a key element of learning. Tutors needed to teach students through experience, rather than through rote memorization as often practised with book learning. Montaigne argued that students would become passive adults, uncritically obedient and unable to think independently. No important knowledge would be retained, and no skills would be acquired. Montaigne believed that learning through experience was superior to learning through books. For this reason, he encouraged tutors to educate their students through practice, travel, and human interaction. By doing so, he argued, students would become active learners, who could claim knowledge for themselves.\nMontaigne's views on child education continue to be influential today. Elements of his thinking have been integrated into modern educational practices. In summary, he argued against the popular teaching style of his time, encouraging individualised learning instead. He believed in the importance of experience over book learning and memorization. Ultimately, Montaigne asserted that the purpose of education was to teach a student how to lead a successful life by practising an active and socially interactive lifestyle.\nRelated writers and influence.\nThinkers exploring ideas similar to Montaigne's include Erasmus, Thomas More, John Fisher and Guillaume Bud\u00e9, who all worked about fifty years before Montaigne's time. Many of Montaigne's Latin quotations come from Erasmus' collection \"Adagia\", and notably all of his quotations from Socrates. Plutarch may be Montaigne's strongest influence in terms of substance and style; there are more than 500 quotations from Plutarch in Montaigne's \"Essais\".\nSince Edward Capell first proposed the idea in 1780, scholars have pointed to Montaigne as an influence on William Shakespeare, who would have had access to John Florio's translation of Montaigne's \"Essais\", published in English in 1603; a scene in Shakespeare's play \"The Tempest\" \"follows the wording of Florio [translating \"Of Cannibals\"] so closely that his indebtedness is unmistakable\". Most parallels between the two writers may be explained, however, as literary ; relative to works by Miguel de Cervantes and Shakespeare, similarities with writers in other countries could be due to shared study of Latin moral and philosophical writers, such as Seneca the Younger, Horace, Ovid, and Virgil.\nMuch of Blaise Pascal's scepticism in his \"Pens\u00e9es\" has traditionally been attributed to his reading Montaigne. Pascal listed Montaigne and Epictetus as the two philosophers with whom he was most familiar.\nThe English essayist William Hazlitt expressed unlimited admiration for Montaigne, exclaiming that \"he was the first who had the courage to say as an author what he felt as a man. ... He was neither a pedant nor a bigot. ... In treating of men and manners, he spoke of them as he found them, not according to preconceived notions and abstract dogmas\". Beginning most clearly with essays in the \"familiar\" style in his own collection \"Table-Talk\", Hazlitt sought to follow Montaigne's example.\nThe American philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson chose \"Montaigne; or, the Skeptic\" as the subject of one lecture in a series titled \"Representative Men\", which included Shakespeare and Plato. In \"The Skeptic\", Emerson said of his experience reading Montaigne that \"It seemed to me as if I had myself written the book, in some former life, so sincerely it spoke to my thought and experience.\" The German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche evaluated Montaigne as follows: \"That such a man wrote has truly augmented the joy of living on this Earth\". The French critic Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve advised that \"to restore lucidity and proportion to our judgments, let us read every evening a page of Montaigne.\" Stefan Zweig drew inspiration from one of Montaigne's quotations for the title of his polemical essay \"A Conscience Against Violence\".\nThe American philosopher Eric Hoffer employed Montaigne in both style and thought. In his memoir, \"Truth Imagined\", he said of Montaigne that \"He was writing about me. He knew my innermost thoughts.\" The British novelist John Cowper Powys expressed admiration for Montaigne's philosophy in his books, \"Suspended Judgements\" (1916) and \"The Pleasures of Literature\" (1938). The American theorist Judith N. Shklar introduces her book \"Ordinary Vices\" (1984) as follows: \"It is only if we step outside the divinely ruled moral universe that we can really put our minds to the common ills we inflict upon one another each day. That is what Montaigne did and that is why he is the hero of this book. In spirit he is on every one of its pages...\".\nThe 20th-century literary critic Erich Auerbach called Montaigne the first modern man. In his book \"\" (in Chapter 12), Auerbach writes that \"Among all his contemporaries he had the clearest conception of the problem of man's self-orientation; that is, the task of making oneself at home in existence without fixed points of support\".\nPossible discovery of remains.\nOn 20 November 2019, the Mus\u00e9e d'Aquitaine announced that human remains found in the basement a year earlier might belong to Montaigne. Investigation of these remains, postponed because of the COVID-19 pandemic, resumed in September 2020.\nCommemoration.\nMontaigne's birthdate served as the basis for establishing National Essay Day in the United States.\nThe humanities branch of the University of Bordeaux is named after Montaigne: \"Universit\u00e9 Michel de Montaigne Bordeaux 3\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Called in the Roman age, Civita in the Middle Ages (Judicates period) and Terranova Pausania until the 1940s, \"Olbia\" has again been the official name of the city since the fascist period.\nHistory.\nAlthough the name is of Greek origin, due to the Greek presence during the seventh century B.C., the city of Olbia was first settled either by the Nuragics or by Phoenicians, according to the archaeological findings. It contains ruins from the Nuragic era to the Roman era, when it was an important port, and the Middle Ages, when it was the capital of the Giudicato of Gallura, one of the four independent states of Sardinia. During the First Punic War, the Romans fought against the Carthaginians and the Sardinians near Olbia, where the general Hanno died in battle.\nFrom 1113 it was the episcopal see of the Diocese of Civit\u00e0 (succeeding to the Diocese of Gallura, the 1070 restoration of the Diocese of Fausania, c. 500\u2013750), which was renamed in 1839 as Diocese of Civita\u2013Tempio until its formal suppression in favor of (in fact merger into) the Diocese of Tempio\u2013Ampurias (also integrating the Diocese of Ampurias, which was in personal union with the see of Civita from 1506).\nGeography.\nIt is the economic centre of this part of the island (commercial centres, food industry) and is very close to the Costa Smeralda tourist area. It was one of the administrative capitals of the province of Olbia-Tempio, operative since 2005 and canceled after a referendum seven years later. Olbia is a tourist destination thanks to its sea and beaches and also for the large number of places of cultural interest to visit.\nClimate.\nOlbia has a Mediterranean climate (\"Csa\"), with mild winters, warm springs and autumns and hot summers.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMain sights.\n \nSport.\nOlbia Calcio 1905 represents Olbia in Serie D, the fourth division of Italian football.\nOlbia hosted several legs of Aquabike World Championship (powerboating) in 2003, 2004, 2018, 2019.\nTransport.\nOlbia is one of the main connections between Sardinia and the Italian peninsula, with an airport (Olbia \u2013 Costa Smeralda), a passenger port (Olbia-Isola Bianca), and a railway from Olbia railway station to Porto Torres, Golfo Aranci and Cagliari.

Some critics have argued that some of his work constitutes an American variant of what Martin Esslin identified as and named the Theater of the Absurd. Three of his plays won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama and two of his other works won the Tony Award for Best Play.\nHis works are often considered frank examinations of the modern condition. His early works reflect a mastery and Americanization of the Theatre of the Absurd that found its peak in works by European playwrights such as Samuel Beckett, Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco, and Jean Genet.\nHis middle period comprised plays that explored the psychology of maturing, marriage and sexual relationships. Younger American playwrights, such as Paula Vogel, credit Albee's mix of theatricality and biting dialogue with helping to reinvent postwar American theatre in the early 1960s. Later in life, Albee continued to experiment in works such as \"The Goat, or Who Is Sylvia?\" (2002).\nEarly life.\nEdward Albee was born in 1928. His biological father left his mother, Louise Harvey, and he was placed for adoption two weeks later and taken to Larchmont, New York, where he grew up. Albee's adoptive father, Reed A. Albee, the wealthy son of vaudeville magnate Edward Franklin Albee\u00a0II, owned several theaters. His adoptive mother, Reed's second wife, Frances (Cotter), was a socialite. He later based the main character of his 1991 play \"Three Tall Women\" on his mother, with whom he had a conflicted relationship.\nAlbee attended the Rye Country Day School, then the Lawrenceville School in New Jersey, from which he was expelled. He then was sent to Valley Forge Military Academy in Wayne, Pennsylvania, where he was dismissed in less than a year. He enrolled at The Choate School (now Choate Rosemary Hall) in Wallingford, Connecticut, graduating in 1946. He had attracted theatre attention by having scripted and published nine poems, eleven short stories, essays, a long act play, \"Schism\", and a 500-page novel, \"The Flesh of Unbelievers\" (Horn, 1) in 1946. His formal education continued at Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut, where he was expelled in 1947 for skipping classes and refusing to attend compulsory chapel.\nAlbee left home for good in his late teens. In a later interview, he said: \"I never felt comfortable with the adoptive parents. I don't think they knew how to be parents. I probably didn't know how to be a son, either.\" In a 1994 interview, he said he left home at 18 because \"[he] had to get out of that stultifying, suffocating environment.\" In 2008, he told interviewer Charlie Rose that he was \"thrown out\" because his parents wanted him to become a \"corporate thug\" and did not approve of his aspirations to be a writer.\nCareer.\n1959\u20131966: The Early Plays.\nAlbee moved into New York's Greenwich Village, where he supported himself with odd jobs while learning to write plays. His roommate in New York was the composer William Flanagan. Primarily in his early plays, Albee's work had various characters that challenged the image of a heterosexual marriage. Despite challenging society's views about the gay community, he did not view himself as an LGBT advocate. Albee's work typically criticized the American Dream. His first play, \"The Zoo Story\", written in three weeks, was first staged in Berlin in 1959 before premiering Off-Broadway in 1960. His next, \"The Death of Bessie Smith\", similarly premiered in Berlin before arriving in New York.\nAlbee's most iconic play, \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\", opened on Broadway at the Billy Rose Theatre on October 13, 1962, and closed on May 16, 1964, after five previews and 664 performances. The opening night cast featured Uta Hagen, Arthur Hill, George Grizzard and Melinda Dillon. The play won the Tony Award for Best Play in 1963 and was selected for the 1963 Pulitzer Prize by the award's drama jury, but the selection was overruled by the advisory committee, which elected not to give a drama award at all. The two members of the jury, John Mason Brown and John Gassner, subsequently resigned in protest. An Academy Award-winning film adaptation by Ernest Lehman was released in 1966 starring Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, George Segal, and Sandy Dennis, and was directed by Mike Nichols. In 2013, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n1971\u20131987: The Middle Plays.\nIn 1971 he wrote \"All Over\", a two-act play originally titled \"Death\", the second half of a projected double bill with another play called \"Life\" (which later became \"Seascape\"). The play premiered on Broadway at the Martin Beck Theatre with John Gielgud directing and starred Jessica Tandy, Madeleine Sherwood, and Colleen Dewhurst. \"The New York Times\" writer Clive Barnes wrote, \"It is a lovely, poignant and deeply felt play. In no way at all is it an easy play -- this formal minuet of death, this symphony ironically celebrating death's dominion. It is not easy in its structure, a series of almost operatic arias demanding, in their precision, pin-point concentration from the audience, and it is certainly not easy in its subject matter.\"\nIn 1974 he wrote \"Seascape\", which won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. It debuted on Broadway with Deborah Kerr and Frank Langella. It was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Play losing to Peter Shaffer's \"Equus\". Clive Barnes of \"The New York Times\" declared the play \"a major event\", adding, \"As Mr. Albee has matured as a playwright, his work has become leaner, sparer and simpler. He depends on strong theatrical strokes to attract the attention of the audience, but the tone of the writing is always thoughtful, even careful, even philosophic.\" He compared his work alongside Samuel Beckett and Harold Pinter.\nAlbee continued to write plays including \"Listening\" (1976), \"Counting the Ways\" (1976) before a brief break before \"The Lady from Dubuque\" (1980) which had a short run on Broadway. He wrote the three act play \"The Man Who Had Three Arms\" (1983) which was received negatively with Frank Rich of \"The New York Times\" writing, \"isn't a play - it's a temper tantrum in two acts... One of the more shocking lapses of Mr. Albee's writing is that he makes almost no attempt even to pretend that Himself is anything other than a maudlin stand-in for himself, with the disappearing arm representing an atrophied talent.\"\nAlbee's plays during the 1980s received mixed reviews with Michael Billington of \"The Guardian\" writing, \"American dramatists invariably end up as victims of their own myth: in a success-crazed culture they are never forgiven for failing to live up to their own early masterpieces. But if Edward Albee has suffered the same cruel fate as Arthur Miller and Tennessee Williams, he has kept on trucking\". Billington wrote of Albee's 1987 play, \"Marriage Play\", \"At the end the play achieves a metaphorical resonance by suggesting that marriage is an accumulation of meaningless habits and that \"nothing has made any difference\".\n1991\u20132016: The Later Plays.\nIn 1991 he wrote the play \"Three Tall Women\", a two act play that premiered at the Vienna's English Theatre about three unnamed women. The play was revived in 2018 directed by Joe Mantello starring Glenda Jackson, Laurie Metcalf, and Allison Pill. The 2018 production received the Tony Award for Best Revival of a Play. Allison Adato of \"Entertainment Weekly\" wrote of the play, \"Edward Albee's Three Tall Women, in which a nonagenarian revisits events of her life refracted through both her own dementia and the differing recollections of her younger selves, is a not-quite-memory play filled with regret, resentment, entitlement, various bodily indignities\".\nGeorgia State University English professor Matthew Roudane divides Albee's plays into three periods: the Early Plays (1959\u20131966), characterized by gladiatorial confrontations, bloodied action and fight to the metaphorical death; the Middle Plays (1971\u20131987), when Albee lost the favor of Broadway audience and started premiering in the U.S. regional theaters and in Europe; and the Later Plays (1991\u20132016), received as a remarkable comeback and watched by appreciative audiences and critics the world over.\nAccording to \"The New York Times\", Albee was \"widely considered to be the foremost American playwright of his generation.\" The less-than-diligent student later dedicated much of his time to promoting American university theatre. He served as a Distinguished Professor of Playwriting and held the Lyndall Finley Wortham Chair in the Performing Arts at the University of Houston. His plays are published by Dramatists Play Service and Samuel French, Inc.\nPhilanthropy.\nAlbee established the Edward F. Albee Foundation, Inc. in 1967, from royalties from his play \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\". The foundation funds the William Flanagan Memorial Creative Persons Center (named after the composer William Flanagan, but better known as \"The Barn\") in Montauk, New York, as a residence for writers and visual artists.\nThe foundation's mission is \"to serve writers and visual artists from all walks of life, by providing time and space in which to work without disturbance.\"\nPersonal life and death.\nAlbee was gay and stated that he first knew he was gay at age twelve and a half.\nAs a teen in Larchmont, Albee became a close friend of English-born Muir Weissinger Jr. and his family. Albee, along with others, referred to Florence, Muir's mother, as \"Mummy\". For her part, Albee's mother felt he spent too much time at the Weissinger household. Albee dated Muir's sister, Delphine, and escorted her to her coming-out party. Albee and Delphine had a \"long and intense relationship\" while it lasted; Albee has said they were \"unofficially engaged\". Albee kept in touch for a long time with Florence and Muir Weissinger.\nAlbee insisted that he did not want to be known as a \"gay writer\", saying in his acceptance speech for the 2011 Lambda Literary Foundation's Pioneer Award for Lifetime Achievement: \"A writer who happens to be gay or lesbian must be able to transcend self. I am not a gay writer. I am a writer who happens to be gay.\" His longtime partner, Jonathan Richard Thomas, a sculptor, died on May 2, 2005, from bladder cancer. They had been partners from 1971 until Thomas's death. Albee also had a relationship of several years with playwright Terrence McNally during the 1950s.\nAlbee died at his home in Montauk, New York on September 16, 2016, aged 88.\nAlbee lived in a 6,000-square-foot loft that was a former cheese warehouse in New York's Tribeca neighborhood. At the time of his death Albee held an expansive collection of fine art, utilitarian works and sculptures. Albee was especially interested in artworks created by indigenous cultures in Africa and Oceania.\nAccolades and accomplishments.\nA member of the Dramatists Guild Council, Albee received three Pulitzer Prizes for drama\u2014for \"A Delicate Balance\" (1967), \"Seascape\" (1975), and \"Three Tall Women\" (1994). Albee was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1972. In 1985, Albee was inducted into the American Theatre Hall of Fame. In 1999, Albee received the PEN/Laura Pels Theater Award as a Master American Dramatist. He received a Special Tony Award for Lifetime Achievement (2005); the gold medal in Drama from the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters (1980); as well as the Kennedy Center Honors and the National Medal of Arts (both in 1996). In 2009, Albee received honorary degree from the Bulgarian National Academy of Theater and Film Arts (NATFA), a member of the Global Alliance of Theater Schools. In 2008, in celebration of Albee's 80th birthday, a number of his plays were mounted in distinguished Off-Broadway venues, including the historic Cherry Lane Theatre where the playwright directed two of his early one-acts, \"The American Dream\" and \"The Sandbox\".\nHonorary awards\nWorks.\nPlays.\nWorks written or adapted by Albee:\nStage Adaptations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* \"The Ballad of the Sad Caf\u00e9\"&lt;br&gt; (Broadway 1963, adapted from the novella by Carson McCullers)\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is from the Italian peninsula and from the French island of Corsica.\nThe coast of Gallura is very jagged and continues along in a continuous series of small fiords, rock-cliffs and little islands that form the archipelago of La Maddalena, a natural bridge towards nearby Corsica.\nThe landscape is characterised by granite rocks and harsh mountains that, even if not particularly high, have constituted for millennia a barrier between this region and the nearby territories of Baronie and Montalbo. Monte Limbara is the highest mountain (1,362 m/4,469\u00a0ft). It represents the boundary between Gallura and the nearby region called Logudoro. Its highest peak is Punta Balestrieri (1362 m above the sea level). In the past, Monte Limbara used to be the location of an important NATO long range radar base and a Carabinieri\u2019s barrack. Today it is used as a telecommunications center for the Italian Air Force and a heliport for the Servizio Antincendi. It is also the location of all the major TV relay stations of West Sardinia. Another small mountain is Monte Cruzitta (666 m). Even if it is not very high, it offers a very characteristic landscape.\nThe climate is typical of the Mediterranean. The weather is clear. During the year approximately 300 days are sunny and the few others are rainy, with a major concentration of rainfall in the winter and autumn, some heavy showers in the spring, and snowfalls on the highest massifs and highlands. The mistral is the dominant wind, fresh, strong, and usually dry and cold, blowing from the northwest throughout the year, but most frequently in winter and spring.\nHistory.\nPrehistory.\nThe first human settlements in Gallura date back to approximately 30.000 years ago, when the first populations crossed the strait between Tuscany and Sardinia. This historic period is known as the Stone Age.\nForeign populations colonize Gallura due to its numerous natural resources. Many people from the nearby island of Corsica came as well to Gallura during this historic period. The mid-late neolithic Arzachena culture subsisted almost exclusively in this area, and here is found the remains of perhaps the oldest megalith on Sardinia, at Li Muri.\nFrom Nuragic Prehistory to Antiquity.\nThe historic period that goes from 1700 BC to the Roman Age is also known in Sardinia as the Nuragic Age. The particular name of this historic period takes after the Nuraghes, the biggest megalithic edifices ever found in Europe, which still today represent a symbol for Sardinia.\nThe Phoenicians founded the (hence Punic) city of Olbia (renamed in Greek, though), which was conquered by the Romans with all of Gallura in 238 BC.\nThe Judicate of Gallura.\nDuring the Middle Ages, Gallura was one of the four Judicates, the four autonomous states into which Sardinia was divided under pope Alexander's assent. \nCivita (which today is known as Olbia) was the capital of the Giudicato of Gallura and the (first) bishop's see.\nThe Judicate of Gallura included today's area of Gallura, the area surrounding the city of Nuoro, and the area called \"Baronias\" (Italian: \"Baronie\"). It was occupied by the republic of Pisa in 1288 after the fall of the last ruling judge Nino Visconti.\nLate Middle Ages till the eighteenth century.\nAt the end of the 13th century, the city of Civita (today's Olbia) takes the name of Terranova, a new settlement founded by the pisans near the site of the ancient Roman port of Olbia.\nPirates \u2013 primarily from North Africa \u2013 raided the coasts of Gallura and people moved consequently from there to the hinterland. The city of Tempio became especially populated.\nBetween 1300 and 1800 there was a big emigration of people from the nearby island of Corsica to Gallura. Corsicans deeply influenced the language and the culture of Gallura, which still today is considered quite different from the culture and the dialects of the rest of Sardinia.\nBy the end of the 1700s people started to move from the hinterland to the coasts.\nNineteenth century, Twentieth century and today.\nDuring the nineteenth century the bishop's see was transferred from the city of Olbia to the city of Tempio, which also became a district's capital.\nIn the second half of the 20th century, tourism increased greatly, especially in the areas of Costa Smeralda, Santa Teresa di Gallura and San Teodoro.\nToday, Gallura has the highest capital income in all of Sardinia.\nEcclesiastical history.\nThe region's original Roman bishopric, the Diocese of Fausania (P(h)ausania), founded no later than the 5th century (tradition says by the 3rd century saint Simplicius), of disputed location (Olbia, Tempio Pausania or Posano) perished under Byzantine rule, probably in the 8th century.\nIt was restored under the name of Gallura in 1070, renamed Civita after its see (the medieval name of Olbia) and from 1506 held in personal union with the Diocese of Ampurias, but no later than the 12th century a second bishopric was established, the Diocese of Galtelli.\nDemographics.\nGallura has a population of 143,921 people; the Sardinians from this area are called Galluresi (). The population density has remarkably increased in small centers along the eastern coast and in the cities of Arzachena and Olbia. The population density of 12 municipalities out of 26 has however decreased (-4%) in centers located in the country -side and on the mountains. This tendency depends on the increase of the seaside tourism.\nIn general, Sardinia represents the Italian region with the lowest fertility rate (1.087 births per woman), and the region with the second lowest birth rate.\nMain towns.\nOlbia (medieval Civita) is a town of approximately 55,000 inhabitants. It represents the city with the highest population density of the entire Gallura. In 2005 it became an administrative capital together with Tempio-Pausania. They form the province called Olbia-Tempio.\nFounded in 350 BC, it used to be one of the most important trade areas of the Mediterranean Sea.\nToday, it represents the economic center of Sardinia due to its airport, its seaport and also to its closeness to the famous Costa Smeralda tourist area.\nTempio Pausania is a town of 13,800 inhabitants. Together with Olbia, it is the administrative capital of the province Olbia-Tempio.\nFounded around 250 BC, Tempio Pausania is located 560m above the sea level. It represents both the geographical and the cultural capital of Gallura. Every year, thousands of tourists come to visit Tempio Pausania to assist to the characteristic carnevale (carnival), which takes place at the end of February.\nArzachena is a town of 12,080 inhabitants. \nIt represents the administrative capital of the Costa Smeralda tourist area. Founded in 1961 by the prince Karim Aga Khan, Costa Smeralda represents the most exclusive tourist area of Gallura.\nArzachena is also famous for its archeology. Its archeological sites include the LiMuri Tomba dei Giganti (Giants\u2019 Grave).\nLa Maddalena is part of an archipelago called Arcipelago della Maddalena. It is situated in the Straits of Bonifacio, which divide Sardinia from Corsica. La Maddalena represents the largest town of this archipelago, which includes the islands of Caprera, S. Stefano, Spargi, Budelli, S. Maria and Razzoli. La Maddalena represents an important tourist site in Gallura and the island of Caprera is famous for being the residence of the Italian revolutionary Giuseppe Garibaldi.\nEconomy.\nThe economy of Gallura is based mostly on tourism and hospitality due to the presence of Costa Smeralda and other world-famous sea sites.\nThe primary sector is not as important as in the rest of Sardinia. It is based mostly on wine production. Also sheep breeding, dairy production, and poultry farm are relevant.\nThe secondary sector is quite important. It is mostly based on cork work and mineral processing of granite. In fact, it is easy to find cork oaks in many parts of the region and the whole area is rich in granite, especially in vicinity of Monte Limbara. Cork production is one of the main economic activity in the interior, while on the coasts are developed fish factories and shipyards.\nTransportation.\nGallura has one international airport (Olbia-Costa Smeralda Airport), which is situated in the city of Olbia. It represents one of the three international airports of Sardinia and the base of the Sardinian airline Meridiana, Italy's third-largest airline.\nAnother way to reach the region of Gallura is by ferry. The ferry companies operating on the Island are Tirrenia di Navigazione, Moby Lines, Corsica Ferry, Grandi Navi Veloci, Snav, SNCM and CMN. They link the harbors of Olbia, Golfo Aranci, Santa Teresa di Gallura and Palau to the harbors of the Italian peninsula, France, Corsica and Spain.\nCulture.\nLanguage.\nThe native language of the area is Gallurese, which is also recognized by the Regional Government of Sardinia. Gallurese is usually not considered a dialect of Sardinian, since it is quite different from most of the other Sardinian dialects, but rather as a direct offshoot from Corsican. Luras and Padru, two small towns in the province of Olbia-Tempio, are the only areas in Gallura in which Gallurese is not traditionally spoken. Sardinian is also spoken in its Logudorese variety.\nEnvironment.\nWith 1,213,250 hectares of woods, Sardinia represents the Italian region with the largest forest extension. Regional landscape plans regulate building activities along the coasts, the forests, and other natural sites.\nSardinia has ten regional parks and three national parks. One of these three national parks is located in Gallura, i.e., the Archipelago of La Maddalena's National Park. This park is a world-famous tourist area due to the beauty of its beaches and to the one of its landscape, where granite rocks alternate with green areas.\nRenewable energies.\nRenewable energies have increased impressively during the recent years in Sardinia. Due to the windy climate, the most important renewable energy in Gallura is the wind power. During the past years however, the installation of wind power systems has been the subject of controversial debates due to its landscape impact.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "44312", "revid": "22938531", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44312", "title": "Invention", "text": "Novel device, material or technical process\nAn invention is a unique or novel device, method, composition, idea, or process. An invention may be an improvement upon a machine, product, or process for increasing efficiency or lowering cost. It may also be an entirely new concept. If an idea is unique enough either as a stand-alone invention or as a significant improvement over the work of others, it can be patented. A patent, if granted, gives the inventor a proprietary interest in the patent over a specific period of time, which can be licensed for financial gain.\nAn inventor creates or discovers an invention. The word \"inventor\" comes from the Latin verb \"invenire\", \"invent-\", to find. Although inventing is closely associated with science and engineering, inventors are not necessarily engineers or scientists. The ideation process may be augmented by the applications of algorithms and methods from the domain collectively known as artificial intelligence.\nSome inventions can be patented. The system of patents was established to encourage inventors by granting limited-term, limited monopoly on inventions determined to be sufficiently novel, non-obvious, and useful or has industrial applicability. A patent is jurisdictional, meaning that a patent only provides rights to the patent owner within the jurisdiction (Country or Countries) in which the patent was obtained. A patent provides the patent owner (who may or may not be an inventor) the right to exclude others from making, using, offering for sale, or selling an invention or importing it into the jurisdiction. The rules and requirements for patenting an invention vary by country and the process of obtaining a patent is often expensive.\nAnother meaning of invention is cultural invention, which is an innovative set of useful social behaviours adopted by people and passed on to others. The Institute for Social Inventions collected many such ideas in magazines and books. Invention is also an important component of artistic and design creativity. Inventions often extend the boundaries of human knowledge, experience or capability.\nTypes.\nInventions are of three kinds: scientific-technological (including medicine), sociopolitical (including economics and law), and humanistic, or cultural.\nScientific-technological inventions include railroads, aviation, vaccination, hybridization, antibiotics, astronautics, holography, the atomic bomb, computing, the Internet, and the smartphone.\nSociopolitical inventions comprise new laws, institutions, and procedures that change modes of social behavior and establish new forms of human interaction and organization. Examples include the British Parliament, the US Constitution, the Manchester (UK) General Union of Trades, the Boy Scouts, the Red Cross, the Olympic Games, the United Nations, the European Union, and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as well as movements such as socialism, Zionism, suffragism, feminism, and animal-rights veganism.\nHumanistic inventions encompass culture in its entirety and are as transformative and important as any in the sciences, although people tend to take them for granted. In the domain of linguistics, for example, Hunminjeongeum or many alphabets have been inventions, as are all neologisms (Shakespeare invented about 1,700 words). Literary inventions include the epic, tragedy, comedy, the novel, the sonnet, the Renaissance, neoclassicism, Romanticism, Symbolism, Aestheticism, Socialist Realism, Surrealism, postmodernism, and (according to Freud) psychoanalysis. Among the inventions of artists and musicians are oil painting, printmaking, photography, cinema, musical tonality, atonality, jazz, rock, opera, and the symphony orchestra. Philosophers have invented logic (several times), dialectics, idealism, materialism, utopia, anarchism, semiotics, phenomenology, behaviorism, positivism, pragmatism, and deconstruction. Religious thinkers are responsible for such inventions as monotheism, pantheism, Methodism, Mormonism, iconoclasm, puritanism, deism, secularism, ecumenism, and the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith. Some of these disciplines, genres, and trends may seem to have existed eternally or to have emerged spontaneously of their own accord, but most of them have had inventors.\nProcess.\nPractical means.\nIdeas for an invention may be developed on paper or on a computer, by writing or drawing, by trial and error, by making models, by experimenting, by testing and/or by making the invention in its whole form. Brainstorming also can spark new ideas for an invention. Collaborative creative processes are frequently used by engineers, designers, architects and scientists. Co-inventors are frequently named on patents.\nIn addition, many inventors keep records of their working process \u2013 notebooks, photos, etc., including Leonardo da Vinci, Galileo Galilei, Evangelista Torricelli, Thomas Jefferson and Albert Einstein.\nIn the process of developing an invention, the initial idea may change. The invention may become simpler, more practical, it may expand, or it may even \"morph\" into something totally different. Working on one invention can lead to others too.\nHistory shows that turning the concept of an invention into a working device is not always swift or direct. Inventions may also become more useful after time passes and other changes occur. For example, the parachute became more useful once powered flight was a reality.\nConceptual means.\nInvention is often a creative process. An open and curious mind allows an inventor to see beyond what is known. Seeing a new possibility, connection or relationship can spark an invention. Inventive thinking frequently involves combining concepts or elements from different realms that would not normally be put together. Sometimes inventors disregard the boundaries between distinctly separate territories or fields. Several concepts may be considered when thinking about invention.\nPlay.\nPlay may lead to invention. Childhood curiosity, experimentation, and imagination can develop one's play instinct. Inventors feel the need to play with things that interest them, and to explore, and this internal drive brings about novel creations.\nSometimes inventions and ideas may seem to arise spontaneously while daydreaming, especially when the mind is free from its usual concerns. For example, both J. K. Rowling (the creator of Harry Potter) and Frank Hornby (the inventor of Meccano) first had their ideas while on train journeys.\nIn contrast, the successful aerospace engineer Max Munk advocated \"aimful thinking\".\nRe-envisioning.\nTo invent is to see anew. Inventors often envision a new idea, seeing it in their mind's eye. New ideas can arise when the conscious mind turns away from the subject or problem when the inventor's focus is on something else, or while relaxing or sleeping. A novel idea may come in a flash\u2014a Eureka! moment. For example, after years of working to figure out the general theory of relativity, the solution came to Einstein suddenly in a dream \"like a giant die making an indelible impress, a huge map of the universe outlined itself in one clear vision\". Inventions can also be accidental, such as in the case of polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon).\nInsight.\nInsight can also be a vital element of invention. Such inventive insights may begin with questions, doubt or a hunch. It may begin by recognizing that something unusual or accidental may be useful or that it could open a new avenue for exploration. For example, the odd metallic color of plastic made by accidentally adding a thousand times too much catalyst led scientists to explore its metal-like properties, inventing electrically conductive plastic and light emitting plastic\u2014an invention that won the Nobel Prize in 2000 and has led to innovative lighting, display screens, wallpaper and much more (see conductive polymer, and organic light-emitting diode or OLED).\nExploration.\nInvention is often an exploratory process with an uncertain or unknown outcome. There are failures as well as successes. Inspiration can start the process, but no matter how complete the initial idea, inventions typically must be developed.\nImprovement.\nInventors may, for example, try to improve something by making it more effective, healthier, faster, more efficient, easier to use, serve more purposes, longer lasting, cheaper, more ecologically friendly, or aesthetically different, lighter weight, more ergonomic, structurally different, with new light or color properties, etc.\nImplementation.\nIn economic theory, inventions are one of the chief examples of \"positive externalities\", a beneficial side effect that falls on those outside a transaction or activity. One of the central concepts of economics is that externalities should be internalized\u2014unless some of the benefits of this positive externality can be captured by the parties, the parties are under-rewarded for their inventions, and systematic under-rewarding leads to under-investment in activities that lead to inventions. The patent system captures those positive externalities for the inventor or other patent owner so that the economy as a whole invests an optimum amount of resources in the invention process.\nComparison with innovation.\nIn contrast to invention, innovation is the implementation of a creative idea that specifically leads to greater value or usefulness. That is, while an invention may be useless or have no value yet still be an invention, an innovation must have some sort of value, typically economic.\nAs defined by patent law.\nThe term \"invention\" is also an important legal concept and central to patent law systems worldwide. As is often the case for legal concepts, its legal meaning is slightly different from common usage of the word. Additionally, the \"legal\" concept of invention is quite different in American and European patent law.\nIn Europe, the first test a patent application must pass is, \"Is this an invention?\" If it is, subsequent questions are whether it is new and sufficiently inventive. The implication\u2014counter-intuitively\u2014is that a legal invention is not inherently novel. Whether a patent application relates to an invention is governed by Article 52 of the European Patent Convention, that excludes, e.g., discoveries \"as such\" and software \"as such\". The EPO Boards of Appeal decided that the technical character of an application is decisive for it to represent an invention, following an age-old Italian and German tradition. British courts do not agree with this interpretation. Following a 1959 Australian decision (\"NRDC\"), they believe that it is not possible to grasp the invention concept in a single rule. A British court once stated that the technical character test implies a \"restatement of the problem in more imprecise terminology.\"\nIn the United States, all patent applications are considered inventions. The statute explicitly says that the American invention concept includes discoveries (35 USC \u00a7 100(a)), contrary to the European invention concept. The European invention concept corresponds to the American \"patentable subject matter\" concept: the first test a patent application is submitted to. While the statute (35 USC \u00a7 101) virtually poses no limits to patenting whatsoever, courts have decided in binding precedents that abstract ideas, natural phenomena and laws of nature are not patentable. Various attempts have been made to substantiate the \"abstract idea\" test, which suffers from abstractness itself, but none have succeeded. The last attempt so far was the \"machine or transformation\" test, but the U.S. Supreme Court decided in 2010 that it is merely an indication at best.\nIn India, invention means a new product or process that involves an inventive step, and capable of being made or used in an industry. Whereas, \"new invention\" means any invention that has not been anticipated in any prior art or used in the country or anywhere in the world.\nIn the arts.\nInvention has a long and important history in the arts. Inventive thinking has always played a vital role in the creative process. While some inventions in the arts are patentable, others are not because they cannot fulfill the strict requirements governments have established for granting them. (see patent).\nSome inventions in art include the:\nLikewise, Jackson Pollock invented an entirely new form of painting and a new kind of abstraction by dripping, pouring, splashing and splattering paint onto un-stretched canvas lying on the floor.\nInventive tools of the artist's trade also produced advances in creativity. Impressionist painting became possible because of newly invented collapsible, resealable metal paint tubes that facilitated spontaneous painting outdoors. Inventions originally created in the form of artwork can also develop other uses, e.g. Alexander Calder's mobile, which is now commonly used over babies' cribs. Funds generated from patents on inventions in art, design and architecture can support the realization of the invention or other creative work. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Auguste Bartholdi's 1879 design patent on the Statue of Liberty helped fund the famous statue because it covered small replicas, including those sold as souvenirs.\nThe timeline for invention in the arts lists the most notable artistic inventors.\nGender gap in inventions.\nHistorically, women in many regions have been unrecognised for their inventive contributions (except Russia and France), despite being the sole inventor or co-inventor in inventions, including highly notable inventions. Notable examples include Margaret Knight who faced significant challenges in receiving credit for her inventions; Elizabeth Magie who was not credited for her invention of the game of \"Monopoly\"; and among other such examples, Chien-Shiung Wu whose male colleagues alone were awarded the Nobel Prize for their joint contributions to physics. Societal prejudice, institutional, educational and often legal patent barriers have both played a role in the gender invention gap. For example, although there could be found female patenters in US patent Office who also are likely to be helpful in their experience, still a patent applications made to the US Patent Office for inventions are less likely to succeed where the applicant have a \"feminine\" name, and additionally women could lose their independent legal patent rights to their husbands once married.

{"id": "44318", "revid": "48585559", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44318", "title": "Phocas", "text": "Roman emperor from 602 to 610\nPhocas (; ; 547\u00a0\u2013 5 October 610) was Eastern Roman emperor from 602 to 610. Initially a middle-ranking officer in the Roman army, Phocas rose to prominence as a spokesman for dissatisfied soldiers in their disputes with the court of the Emperor Maurice. When the army rebelled in 602, Phocas emerged as the leader of the mutiny. The revolt led to the overthrow and execution of Maurice in November 602.\nPhocas deeply mistrusted the uncooperative elite of Constantinople, to whom he was a usurper and a provincial boor. He therefore attempted to base his regime on relatives installed in high military and administrative positions. He immediately faced challenges in domestic and foreign affairs, and responded with little success. He dealt with domestic opposition with increasing ruthlessness that alienated ever wider circles, including some of his own household. The Sasanian Empire launched a massive invasion of the eastern provinces. Finally, the exarch of Africa, Heraclius the Elder, rebelled against Phocas and gained wide support throughout the empire. Phocas attempted to use border troops to crush the rebellion, but this only resulted in allowing invaders to break into the heartlands of the Empire. Heraclius the Elder's son, Heraclius, took Constantinople on 5 October 610, executed Phocas the same day, and declared himself emperor.\nSurviving sources are universally extremely hostile to Phocas. He is described as an incompetent tyrant and usurper who brutally purged any real or perceived opposition and left the Empire wide open to foreign aggression. The veracity of these sources is difficult to ascertain since emperors of the Heraclian dynasty who succeeded Phocas had a vested interest in tarnishing his reputation.\nLife.\nEarly life.\nPhocas was most likely born in 547, as he was said to be aged 55 when he became emperor. He and his family were likely of Thraco-Roman or Cappadocian origin. The life of Phocas before his usurpation of the Byzantine Empire's throne is obscure, but he was said to have served as a centurion in the army in Thrace under Emperor Maurice.\nLate in Maurice's reign, the army sent Phocas to Constantinople as their spokesperson to complain about the conduct of general Comentiolus. As Phocas presented their case, he argued with the emperor, and as a result, had his beard pulled by an outraged patrician.\nUsurpation.\nIn autumn 602, the Thracian army rebelled against Maurice, largely due to exhaustion and outrage over orders to continue campaigning north of the Danube in winter, as well as previous cuts in wages. The army initially sent a delegation, which included Phocas, to general Peter and demanded a dismissal within the Roman borders. But when Maurice reiterated his command, the troops made Phocas their leader and started marching to Constantinople. They insisted that Maurice abdicate and offered to proclaim as successors Theodosius, son and co-emperor of Maurice, or his father-in-law Germanus. As Maurice tried to arrest Germanus, riots broke out in Constantinople. That night, on 22 November 602, Maurice and his family fled on a warship to Bithynia, sending Theodosius on a mission to ask for Persian King Khusrow II's help. According to Theophylact Simocatta (c.\u2009630), Germanus initially made an attempt for the throne, but when rebuffed by the Greens, he paid homage to Phocas, who had emerged as the heavy favorite.\nOn 23 November 602, Phocas was crowned by the patriarch Cyriacus in the church of St John the Baptist at the Hebdomon. He entered Constantinople in a ceremonial procession two days later, on 25 November, while being unanimously acclaimed.\nMaurice and his sons were soon captured and executed. There were, however, stories that Theodosius managed to escape to Persia. Maurice's wife Constantina and daughters were put in the monastery of Nea Metanoia. They were executed around 605, when Constantina and Germanus were found conspiring after hearing rumors of Theodosius' survival.\nForeign conflict.\nDespite the executions of the previous emperor and his dynastic successors, Phocas remained in a precarious position, which led him to devote his energy to purging enemies and destroying conspiracies. The Sassanian Empire launched an invasion of the eastern provinces of the empire.\nDuring his reign, the Balkan frontier remained stable. He concluded a treaty with the Avars in 604, though warfare flared up again as a consequence of the Heraclian rebellion in 609.\nThe Sassanid Persians had formerly been at peace with Maurice as a result of a treaty they made with him in 591. After Phocas usurped and killed Maurice, the Persians invaded the empire in 603. The Sassanids rapidly occupied the eastern provinces, leading the \"Magister militum per Orientem\", Narses, to defect to their side. Phocas swiftly dealt with him, by inviting him to Constantinople under the promise of safe conduct, then having him burnt alive when he arrived. Though Dara was lost in connection with the revolt, Phokas was able to fight the Sasanians to a standstill until 606, with no further major strongholds falling. Between 607 and 610, the armies of Khosrow managed to slowly conquer the Mesopotamian fortresses, and by August 610, they had established a bridgehead across the Euphrates. Some historians blame the civil war between Phocas and Heraclius for the collapse of the eastern frontier in the following years.\nContemporary accounts describe the Persians as being very brutal to the occupied population. The 'miracle of St Demetrios' described the carnage:\n[T]he devil raised the whirlwind of hatred in all the East, Cilicia, Asia, Palestine and all the lands from there to Constantinople: the factions, no longer content simply to spill blood in public places, attacked homes, slaughtered women, children, the aged, and the young who were sick; those whose youth and frailty impeded their escape from the massacre, [saw] their friends, acquaintances, and parents pillaged, and after all that, even set on fire so that the most wretched inhabitant was not able to escape.\nAdministration.\nPhocas frequently filled senior posts with his relatives, due to his isolation from the bulk of Constantinople's elite, with whom he had had no connection before, or because of Constantinople's system of imperial patronage which prioritized loyalty to the emperor. Phocas installed: his brother Domentziolus as \"Magister officiorum\" in 603; his nephew Domentziolus as \"Magister militum per Orientem\" in 604, giving him command over the eastern provinces; and his brother Comentiolus as \"Magister militum per Orientem\" around 610. All three remained loyal to Phocas until they were killed by Heraclius. On the other hand, Phocas appointed Priscus, a general under Maurice, as the Count of the Excubitors (\"comes excubitorum\") in 603. Priscus would later marry Phocas' daughter Domentzia around 607. During his reign, Phocas was unable to control either the state or the army effectively.\nItalian policy.\nWhen Phocas was emperor, Byzantine Italy was under continual attack from Lombards, but the Byzantine government spent few resources to aid Italy due to troubles elsewhere. In the entirety of Phocas' reign, the only public structure built with taxes in the city of Rome was a statue of Phocas completed in 608.\nWhen Phocas usurped Maurice, Gregory the Great was bishop of Rome and he praised Phocas as a restorer of liberty. Gregory referred to him as a pious and clement lord, and compared his wife (the new Empress) Leontia to Marcian's consort Pulcheria (whom the Council of Chalcedon called the new Helena). In May 603, portraits of the imperial couple arrived in Rome and were ordered by the pope to be placed in the oratory of St. Caesarius in the imperial palace on the Palatine.\nImperial approval was needed at that time to appoint a new pope, but the approval was delayed by a year upon the death of Pope Sabinian in 606, as Phocas was occupied with killing internal enemies that threatened his rule. He finally gave approval in 607 and Boniface III became pope. Phocas declared Rome \"the head of all churches\". Shortly afterwards, Phocas had a gilded statue of himself erected on a monumental column in the Roman Forum, known as the Column of Phocas.\nDownfall.\nDespite being appointed as \"Comes excubitorum\", Priscus was not loyal to Phocas, and in 608 he appealed to Heraclius the Elder, the Exarch of Carthage, to rebel against Phocas. Heraclius the Elder agreed, and began to prepare to invade, by cutting off the supply of grain to Constantinople and assembling a large army and navy. Heraclius the Elder launched his invasion in 609, with his nephew, Nicetas, marching troops overland to the capital, and his son, Heraclius, leading a naval invasion of Thessalonica, before marching to Constantinople. Heraclius arrived outside Constantinople on 3 October 610, and seized the city on 5 October. Heraclius was declared emperor on the same day, and swiftly had Phocas executed.\nWhen Heraclius captured Phocas, he was said to have asked him \"Is this how you have ruled, wretch?\" Phocas's reply\u2014\"And will you rule better?\"\u2014so enraged Heraclius that he beheaded Phocas on the spot. According to John of Nikiu he later had the genitalia removed from the body because Phocas had allegedly raped the wife of Photius, a powerful politician in the city.\nLegacy.\nPhocas is generally depicted as a villain by Byzantines and modern historians alike, but some of the earliest sources available about Phocas' reign were written during the reign of Heraclius. The writings that survive are not reliably neutral and the writers would have good reason to demonize him in order to strengthen the rule of Heraclius.\nThe reign of Phocas is marked by the change of imperial fashion set by Constantine the Great (r.\u2009306\u00a0\u2013\u00a0337). Starting with Constantine, it became common again to show emperors as clean-shaven on coinage in line with the style of early emperors until the reign of Hadrian (r.\u2009117\u00a0\u2013\u00a0138). However, Phocas was consistently depicted with a beard, which became the convention until the end of the Byzantine empire. Virtually all emperors after him were depicted with facial hair.\nOn 19 February 607, Emperor Phocas appointed Boniface III as the new bishop of Rome. Phocas issued an imperial decree by the Roman government, recognizing Boniface III as the \"Head of all Churches\" and \"Universal Bishop\". Phocas transferred the title of \"Universal Bishop\" from the Diocese of Constantinople to the Diocese of Rome. Boniface sought and obtained a decree from Phocas in which he restated that \"the See of Blessed Peter the Apostle should be the head of all the Churches\" and ensured that the title of \"Universal Bishop\" belonged exclusively to the Bishop of Rome. This act effectively ended the attempt by Patriarch Cyriacus of Constantinople to establish himself as \"Universal Bishop\".\nIn calling the Pope the \"head of all churches\", Phocas' decree has been important in discussions about papal primacy and papal supremacy. Some Protestant historicist commentators have seen the decree of Phocas (usually taken to be in 606) as having eschatological significance. For example, in his \"Horae Apocalypticae\", Edward Bishop Elliott took the 1260 days of Revelation 11:3 to be the period between 606 and the Unification of Italy in 1866.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
