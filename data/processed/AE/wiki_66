It was released in Japan in June 1997 and in North America in January 1998 by Sony Computer Entertainment. It is the first game of the \"Tactics\" sub-series within the \"Final Fantasy\" franchise, and the first entry set in the fictional world later known as Ivalice. The story follows Ramza Beoulve, a highborn cadet placed in the middle of a military conflict known as The Lion War, where two opposing noble factions are coveting the throne of the kingdom.\nProduction was begun in 1995 by Yasumi Matsuno, a newcomer who had created the \"Ogre Battle\" series at Quest Corporation. Matsuno's wish was for an accessible tactical game with a storyline focusing on class-based conflict and the rewriting of history. Matsuno acted as director and writer, \"Final Fantasy\" creator Hironobu Sakaguchi was producer, and the battles were designed by Hiroyuki Ito. Multiple other staff members were veterans of the \"Ogre Battle\" series, including artists Hiroshi Minagawa and Akihiko Yoshida, and composers Hitoshi Sakimoto and Masaharu Iwata. The game received critical acclaim and has become a cult classic since its release. It sold over one million units in Japan during 1997, and over 2.4 million worldwide by August 2011. It has been cited as one of the greatest video games of all time.\nThe world of Ivalice became the setting for multiple other titles, including other \"Tactics\" games, and the 2006 mainline entry \"Final Fantasy XII\". An enhanced port of the game, \"\", was released in 2007 as part of the \"Ivalice Alliance\" project. An expanded remaster for eighth and ninth generation consoles and Windows, subtitled The Ivalice Chronicles, was released on September 30, 2025.\nGameplay.\n\"Final Fantasy Tactics\" is a tactical role-playing game in which players follow the story of protagonist Ramza Beoulve. The game features two modes of play: battles and the world map. Battles take place on three-dimensional, isometric fields. Characters move on a battlefield composed of square tiles; movement and action ranges are determined by the character's statistics and job class. The battlefield also factors in elements such as terrain and weather to determine strategic advantages and disadvantages during clashes. Battles are turn-based; a unit may act when its Charge Time (CT) reaches 100 and increased once every CT unit (a measure of time in battles) by an amount equal to the unit's speed statistic. During battle, whenever a unit performs an action successfully, it gains experience points (EXP) and job points (JP). Actions can include magical attacks, physical attacks, or using an item. Hit points (HP) of enemy units are also visible to the player (except in the case of certain bosses), allowing the player to know how much damage they still have to inflict on a particular unit.\nIn the world map, the player moves on predefined paths connecting the towns and battle points. When the character icon is over a town, a menu can be opened with several options: \"Bar\" for taking sidequest job offers, \"Shop\" for buying supplies and equipment, and \"Soldier Office\" for recruiting new characters. Later in the game, some towns contain \"Fur Shops\" for obtaining items by way of poaching monsters. Random battles happen in pre-set locations on the map, marked in green. Passing over one of these spots may result in a random encounter.\n\"Tactics\" features a character class system, which allows players to customize characters into various roles. The game makes extensive use of most of the original character classes seen in earlier \"Final Fantasy\" games, including Summoners, Wizards (Black Mages), Priests (White Mages), Monks, Lancers (Dragoons), and Thieves. New recruits start out as either a Squire or a Chemist, the base classes for warrior and magician jobs, respectively. The game features twenty jobs accessible by normal characters.\nThe JP rewarded in battle are used to learn new abilities within each job class. Accumulating enough JP results in a job level up; new jobs are unlocked by attaining a certain level in the current job class (for instance, to become a Priest or Wizard, the unit must first attain Job Level2 as a Chemist), which also allows the character to gain more JP in that class in battles. Once all the abilities of a job class have been learned, the class is \"Mastered\". A soldier in a specific Job always has its innate skill equipped (Wizards always have \"Black Magic\", Knights always have \"Battle Skill\") but a second job-skill slot and several other ability slots (Reaction, Support, and Movement) can be filled with any skill the particular soldier has learned.\nPlot.\nSetting.\nThe story takes place in the kingdom of Ivalice, inspired by the Middle Ages. The kingdom is located in a peninsula surrounded by sea on the north, west and south, with a headland south of the landmass. It is heavily populated by human beings, although intelligent monsters can be found living in less populated areas. Magic is predominant in the land, although ruins and artifacts indicated that the past populace had relied on machinery, such as airships and robots. Ivalice's neighbors are the kingdom of Ordalia in the east and Romanda, a military nation to the north. While the three nations share common royal bloodlines, major wars have taken place between them. An influential religious institution known as the Glabados Church heads the dominant faith, centering around a religious figure known as Saint Ajora.\nThe story takes place after Ivalice ended its war with the two nations in what is known as the Fifty Years War, and is facing economic problems and political strife. The king of Ivalice has recently died and his heir is an infant, so a regent is needed to rule in place of the prince. The kingdom is split between two candidates named Prince Goltana, represented by the Black Lion, and Prince Larg, symbolized by the White Lion. The conflict leads to what is known in the game as the Lion War. Behind this backdrop is a revelation by the game's historian Alazlam J. Durai, who seeks to reveal the story of an unknown character whose role in the Lion War was major but was covered up by the kingdom's church.\nCharacters.\nMost of the game's plot is portrayed from Ramza's perspective, who is the player character of the story. He is joined by a cadre of characters which include Delita Hyral, his closest friend, and Agrias Oaks, the knight in charge of protecting Princess Ovelia. He is introduced to various factions of the Lion War; the most prominent are those of Duke Goltana and Duke Larg, who both want to become the guardian of Ivalice's monarch and are engaged in a war with each other. The story progresses to include characters from the Glabados Church, which has been controlling Ivalice silently and engineering the war in question.\nAs the game progresses, players are able to recruit generic player characters and customize them using the Job system of the Final Fantasy series. Several battles also feature characters controlled via the game's A.I., which may be recruited later in the game according to the story proper. The characters were designed by Akihiko Yoshida, who was also in charge of the illustration and character designs for \"Tactics Ogre\", and then went on to do the same for \"Final Fantasy Tactics Advance\", \"Final Fantasy XII\", and \"Vagrant Story\".\nStory.\nThe story is presented as a historical account by Alazlam J. Durai based on recently discovered documents dubbed the \"Durai Report\", written by his ancestor Olan Durai. Ivalice is recovering from the Fifty Year War against Ordalia. After the death of its ruler, Princess Ovelia and Prince Orinas are both candidates for the throne. The former is supported by Prince Goltana of the Black Lion, and the latter by Queen Ruvelia and her brother, Prince Larg of the White Lion. The two groups engage in battles in the Lion War. Nobles and commoners regard each other negatively and many commoners joined the Corpse Brigade to fight against the nobles' soldiers.\nRamza, part of the noble Beoulve family of knights, and Delita, his childhood friend who was an ordinary commoner, witness the murder of Delita's sister during an uprising. This causes Delita and Ramza to abandon their ties to the nobility. Ramza joins a mercenary group, led by Gafgarion, who protects Princess Ovelia from being hunted by both sides of the Lion War. Delita joins Goltana's forces. They are reunited when Gafgarion attempts to take Ovelia to Prince Larg. Agrias suggests visiting Cardinal Delacroix of the Glabados Church to protect Ovelia. Along the way, Ramza meets Mustadio, a machinist in possession of a holy relic called the Zodiac Stone. Hunted by a trading company for the power it contains, Mustadio also seeks Delacroix's intervention.\nRamza discovers that High Confessor Marcel Funebris and the church used the legend of the holy Zodiac Braves to gather the Zodiac Stones and instigated the Lion War. To prevent Ramza's interference, Delacroix uses the stone to transform into a Lucavi demon and Ramza defeats him. Ramza is regarded as a heretic by the church and he is chased by the Knights Templar, the soldiers of the church who are hunting the Zodiac Stones. He acquires proof of the Church's lies about Saint Ajora, a central figure in the religion, and attempts to use it along with the Zodiac Stone to reveal the organization's plot.\nThe two sides in the Lion War face off in a major battle that results in the deaths of Larg and Goltana. Ramza stops the battle and rescues the general, Count Cidolfus Orlandeau, though the Church eliminates the two leaders to secure its control over Ivalice. Ramza discovers that the Knights Templar are possessed by the Lucavi, who are seeking to resurrect their leader Ultima, and they needed bloodshed and a suitable body to complete the resurrection. Alma, Ramza's sister, is to serve as the host for Ultima's incarnation. Ultima is resurrected and Ramza and his allies succeed in destroying her and escape Ivalice.\nIn the epilogue, Delita marries Ovelia and becomes the King of Ivalice, while Ramza and Alma fake their deaths and go into hiding. Delita fails to find true satisfaction as even Ovelia distrusts him, leading to a confrontation where they stab each other; their fates are left ambiguous in the game. Closing text from Alazlam reveals Olan Durai, who encountered Ramza several times, compiled the Durai Report and sought to reveal the Church's complicity, but he was burned as a heretic and his papers confiscated. His descendent Alazlam hopes now that Ramza's role in the Lion Wars will be remembered in full.\nDevelopment.\n\"Tactics\" was conceived in 1993 by \"Final Fantasy\" series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi, who is a fan of the tactical role-playing genre. Due to his heavy involvement with the mainline series, he was unable to realize it at the time. Production finally began at the end of 1995 under Yasumi Matsuno, who until that year had worked at Quest Corporation on the \"Ogre Battle\" series, resigning once work was completed on \"\" and bringing several of its staff over to Square. During this period, Square had broken its long-standing development partnership with Nintendo and moved their game projects over to Sony's PlayStation.\nMatsuno acted as director and lead scenario writer. Sakaguchi was the game's producer. The lead programmer was Taku Murata, who had previously worked on the \"Mana\" series. Matsuno described the working environment at Square as more democratic than at Quest, with a greater ability for the whole staff to contribute design ideas. The art design was a collaborative effort led by \"Tactics Ogre\" veterans Hiroshi Minagawa and Akihiko Yoshida, with additional character designs and artwork by Hideo Minaba and Eiichiro Nakatsu. Contrasting against the polished CGI aesthetic of \"Final Fantasy VII\", the team wanted a hand-drawn artstyle. The opening and closing cinematics were created by Western company Animatek International.\nDesign.\nMatsuno's prototype was originally closer to \"\", a real-time strategy title with similar 2D graphics. Some sample images were produced, but this concept was then scrapped. For the final game, Matsuno aimed for a tactical RPG that would be accessible, something he originally aimed for with the \"Ogre Battle\" titles and later felt he had failed to accomplish with \"Tactics\". When deciding how to differentiate \"Tactics\" from his earlier title, he placed a focus on individual character growth similar to the main series, contrasting against the army-based simulation of \"Tactics Ogre\" while keeping its chess-inspired gameplay. While Matsuno designed most of the rest of the game systems, due to staff shortages and needing to focus on the scenario the battle system was designed by Hiroyuki Ito. Ito disliked tactical RPGs of the time, growing bored with their mechanics, so designed the battle system to be engaging and feel fast and exciting. Matsuno had to push against Ito's wish to simplify the class system. The level design, which used compact diorama-style levels, was chosen to allow the intended 60 frames per second, carrying over the smooth gameplay experience gamers expected from the genre. The small scale of battles also reinforced the personal nature of the game's narrative conflicts. Level design and mastering continued until a week before the game shipped.\nUnder Matsuno's direction, the game's design strayed significantly from Sakaguchi's original concept, particularly in its narrative tone. Ito at the time described a wish for the narrative to emulate \"a sense of swashbuckling heroism\". Matsuno's aim was to create a \"Final Fantasy\"-themed morality tale. Matsuno stated that the game's thematic use of class-based society was derived from his experiences within game production companies, observing their hierarchy and how senior designers were treated as royalty. The story premise of a long-suppressed account of ancient history was inspired by the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, and the story of \"The Name of the Rose\". Its themes of economic and class inequality were inspired by the Lost Decades following the Japanese bubble economy, which Matsuno described as a time when \"many [in Japan] were robbed of hope\". The specific themes were represented by Ramza, who sought to upend the social order, and Delita, who used it to gain power. For \"Tactics\", Matsuno created an entire new world dubbed Ivalice, which he would use in multiple later projects. Ivalice was designed as a complex setting with a deep historical background. He described it as a blank canvas on which he and later others could create narratives. While some aspects of the ending were left ambiguous, Matsuno considered the narrative complete on its own.\nMusic.\nDuring its preplanning phase, the music was going to be in an upbeat style in line with the mainline \"Final Fantasy\" series. Due to its portrayal of people fighting each other rather than fighting monsters, Matsuno felt upbeat music was wrong. The original score was written by Hitoshi Sakimoto and Masaharu Iwata, both veterans of the \"Ogre Battle\" series. Sakimoto, who was brought on board the project by Matsuno, was advised by both Matsuno and established \"Final Fantasy\" composer Nobuo Uematsu not to worry about keeping to the style of the main \"Final Fantasy\" series. Iwata described the game as a \"giant project\" to work on, and he received a lot of help from other staff members at Square. Several tracks were inspired by the game's storyline and concept art, with some track names being chosen by Sakimoto based on first impressions of relevant characters. Sakimoto described his music for the game as \"bright and cheerful tunes\", carrying themes of hope and love. Sakimoto and Iwata worked separately on their own tracks. The album was first released on two compact discs by DigiCube on June 21, 1997, and was re-released by Square Enix on March 24, 2006.\nVersions and re-releases.\n\"Tactics\" was first released in Japan on June 20, 1997. It came bundled with a demo disc for \"SaGa Frontier\". The English localization was partly outsourced, with the other part of translation and localization being handled by Square Soft's Michael Baskett. Baskett started writing the script in an \"Olde English style,\" but this was beginning to impact the game's understandability and made characters sound alike, so it was toned down in the final script. It was released in North America on January 28, 1998, by Sony Computer Entertainment America, who, at the time, acted as Square's Western publisher for the platform. It was re-released as part of the Square's Millennium Collection. This series of games was released only in Japan, and each title is bought with a set of related merchandise. \"Final Fantasy Tactics\" was sold on June 29, 2000, along with titles such as \"Saga Frontier\", \"Saga Frontier 2\", \"Brave Fencer Musashi\", \"Front Mission 3\", \"Ehrgeiz\" and \"Legend of Mana\".\nIn 2001, four years after its release, \"Final Fantasy Tactics\" was selected as part of the Sony Greatest Hits line of re-releases. \"Final Fantasy Tactics\" also became part of Ultimate Hits, Square Enix's main budget range available in Japan.\n\"The War of the Lions\".\nA PlayStation Portable version of \"Final Fantasy Tactics\", entitled \"\" was released on May 10, 2007, in Japan, and later across all regions. It is the second game announced as part of the \"Ivalice Alliance\". The game features an updated version of \"Final Fantasy Tactics\", along with new features including in-game cutscenes, new characters, and multiplayer capability. The updated mechanics contain a 16:9 widescreen support, new items, new jobs, and cel-shaded full motion videos. The English version contains full voice acting during the cinematic cut scenes, whereas the Japanese version does not.\n\"The Ivalice Chronicles\".\nAn expanded remaster, subtitled \"The Ivalice Chronicles\", was released on September 30, 2025, for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows. Developed by Square Enix, the remaster includes an updated script and story, gameplay additions including an easier difficulty and options to increase field visibility, updated graphics, and full voice acting in English and Japanese. The original game is included with the localization used in \"The War of the Lions\". Multiple original staff returned including Kazutoyo Maehiro as director, Matsuno as writer and script editor, and Minagawa as art director. Yoshida returned to draw new cover art featuring Ramza and Delita.\nProduction of \"The Ivalice Chronicles\" was spurred on by Maehiro, who had played the original and wanted it both to be accessible on modern platforms, and easier for players to understand and complete. Maehiro chose the PlayStation version as the remaster's starting point over \"The War of the Lions\", due to both a lack of direct experience among the team and a wish to highlight the original. Speaking after the announcement, Matsuno felt he was presenting the game to a modern audience who were facing similar social and economic issues to those that initially inspired the game's tone. Development was complicated due to the original master data source code not being preserved, with the team reconstructing the code using multiple commercial versions and experience from repeated playthroughs. Maehiro compared the process to porting an arcade game to an early home console. Full voice acting was included as a modern concession, with the dialogue being rewritten to flow more naturally while preserving the original tone. For the PlayStation original included in \"The Ivalice Chronicles\", the team added an autosave function along with fixing various bugs. The graphics were also improved with a focus on presenting them in their best light rather than changing anything. Due to the choice to focus on the original, added content from \"The War of the Lions\" was not included.\nReception.\n\"Final Fantasy Tactics\" sold nearly 825,000 copies in Japan in the first half of 1997, and ended the year at almost 1.24 million copies sold. By 2007 the game had sold approximately 1.35 million copies in Japan. As of August 2011, the game had sold over 2.4 million copies worldwide.\n\"Final Fantasy Tactics\" received critical acclaim upon its release. Some reviews lauded the battle sequences as challenging, requiring more strategic planning than ordinary RPGs and utilising many gameplay mechanics in later battle sequences. The visuals were also lauded, particularly the spell effects, 3D battlegrounds, and camera that can be rotated and zoomed. Other reviewers disagreed and considered these elements a problem because it necessitated that the battles consist of fewer characters. John Ricciardi, in his review for \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\", argued that the game should have been done in 2D style so that the PlayStation's processors could handle larger battlefields. Nob Ogasawara, when writing for \"GamePro\", was also concerned with the small scale of the battles, saying that as a result the game \"isn't so much \"Tactics Ogre\" with a \"Final Fantasy\" flavor as it is FF with a TO flavor\". A reviewer at \"RPGFan\" criticized the game's difficulty as inconsistent, in part due to abilities unique to certain characters which unfairly sway the tide of battle either in favor of or against the player.\nCritics praised the story's depth and plot twists but some remarked that the large number of similar-looking characters made it hard to distinguish between characters to develop an emotional attachment. \"RPGFan\" criticized the English localization as rife with grammatical mistakes. The game's soundtrack was also praised.\n\"IGN\" awarded the game the Editor's Choice Award in 1998, praising the in-game graphics as \"amazing\" and the battle environments with its extra details as being \"extremely well designed\". \"GameSpot\" named \"Final Fantasy Tactics\" as one of \"the greatest games of all time\" in 2007. The game placed 84th in the \"Top 100 Favorite Games of All Time\" poll by Japanese magazine \"Famitsu\" in March 2006, 45th in \"Game Informer\"'s list of top 100 games, 43rd in \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\"'s list, and 38th in \"IGN\"'s rankings of greatest games.\nLegacy.\nThe world of \"Final Fantasy Tactics\" has been featured in several other Square video games. After the game's release, the development staff developed \"Vagrant Story\", which featured several subtle references to \"Final Fantasy Tactics\". In an interview, Matsuno said both titles are set in the same fictional world of Ivalice.\nDuring the development of \"Vagrant Story\", Matsuno and Sakaguchi initiated a sequel to \"Tactics\", which would have used 2D graphics due to issues with 3D development at the time. The project was outsourced to an unspecified developer because of the team's commitment to \"Vagrant Story\" and was later cancelled for unspecified reasons.\nIn 2006, \"Final Fantasy XII\" was released, also set in the world of Ivalice. Square Enix announced at the end of the same year the \"Ivalice Alliance\", a new series of games set in the world of Ivalice, during a Tokyo press conference. The first title released was '. Square released \"Final Fantasy Tactics Advance\" for the Nintendo Game Boy Advance in 2003. The game setting and engine are similar to the ones of its predecessor, but the cast of characters is considerably smaller and the plot is simpler. An indirect sequel to \"Final Fantasy Tactics Advance\", titled ', was released in Japan in 2007 and in the rest of the world in 2008. It is also one of the titles released under the \"Ivalice Alliance\" game series, and takes place in the Ivalice universe.\nRamza and Agrias appeared in online trading card game \"Lord of Vermilion III\" in 2014. Ramza also appears as a playable character in the fighting game \"Dissidia Final Fantasy NT\". In 2017, the MMORPG \"\" portrayed an alternate version of \"Final Fantasy Tactics\" in which Ramza and his companions died at the end of \"Tactics\". Matsuno said that the inspiration to depict this plot came from the number of players that misunderstood the ending of \"Tactics\". \"Final Fantasy Tactics\" is featured in the \"Final Fantasy Trading Card Game\", with Ramza, Delita, Agrias, and other characters appearing in Opus I (Roman Numeral). \"Tactics\" has made additional appearances in Opus III, IV, V, VII, X, and XIII.\nA remixed version of the song \"Ovelia &amp; Delita\" was nominated for \"Best Game Music Cover/Remix\" at the 16th Annual Game Audio Network Guild Awards.\nAn upcoming game, \"Unsung Story\", is meant to be a spiritual successor to \"Final Fantasy Tactics\". It has design input from Yasumi Matsuno and a soundtrack composed by Hitoshi Sakimoto.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Novoselic co-founded and played bass on every album for the rock band Nirvana.\nNovoselic and Kurt Cobain formed the band Nirvana in 1987, soon recruiting drummer Aaron Burckhard, who was the drummer of the group until October 1987. Through the late 1980s, Nirvana established themselves as part of the Seattle grunge scene, releasing three albums between 1989 and 1993. Nirvana abruptly ended in 1994 following the death of Kurt Cobain. Novoselic has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Nirvana, and has also received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award as a member of the band.\nAfter Nirvana disbanded, Novoselic formed Sweet 75 in 1995 and Eyes Adrift in 2002, releasing one album with each band. From 2006 to 2009, he played in the punk rock band Flipper. In 2011, he contributed bass and accordion to the song \"I Should Have Known\" on the Foo Fighters' studio album \"Wasting Light\". From 2017 to 2020, he played \nbass and accordion for the band Giants in the Trees.\nOutside of music, Novoselic has been active politically. From 2007 through 2010, he wrote a weekly column on music and politics for the \"Seattle Weekly\" website. Novoselic has served on the board of the electoral reform organization FairVote and has served as its chair. In 2020, he became board chair of Z\u00f3calo Public Square. He joined the Forward Party in 2023 and became the party's leader in Washington after the resignation of Chris Vance. In 2024, he founded the Cascade Party of Washington.\nEarly life.\nKrist Anthony Novoselic was born in Compton, California, on May 16, 1965, the son of Croatian immigrants Krsto Novaseli\u0107 and Marija Musta\u0107. Kristo was a native of Veli I\u017e on the island of I\u017e while Marija originates from Privlaka. The original Croatian surname of Novaseli\u0107 was mistakenly changed to Novoselic by a clerk when Kristo was applying for a passport to go to America. Novoselic lived in Compton for one year before his parents moved to the ethnically Croatian Los Angeles neighborhood of San Pedro. His first language is Croatian. He has a younger brother and a younger sister. In 1979, his family relocated to Aberdeen, Washington. In 1980, his parents sent him to live with relatives in Zadar, Croatia, Yugoslavia. He returned to Aberdeen in 1981. His earliest memory of listening to music is listening to Chuck Berry with his father. Growing up, he had a severe underbite, for which he underwent corrective surgery.\nNovoselic was interested in bands such as Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, The Who, Van Halen, Devo, and Aerosmith. He also enjoyed listening to Yugoslavian bands such as Zabranjeno Pu\u0161enje, Prljavo kazali\u0161te and Azra. He became interested in punk rock, and discovered bands such as the Sex Pistols and the Ramones when he lived in the Socialist Republic of Croatia, Yugoslavia at the age of 14 for one year. He has cited Paul McCartney, Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, and Gene Simmons as fundamental influences of his bass playing.\nNovoselic's brother Robert introduced him to his friend Kurt Cobain, who had noticed loud music coming from upstairs in the Novoselic household. Robert told Cobain that it was his older brother, who listened to punk rock. Cobain eventually befriended the older Novoselic, as the pair had similar musical tastes, including a fondness for local band Melvins. The two had several mutual friends and began hanging out shortly thereafter. Krist attended Aberdeen High School while Kurt attended high school in nearby Montesano. At one point, Cobain gave Novoselic a demo tape of his former band Fecal Matter, and asked him to form a band together. After several months, Novoselic finally listened to the tape, liked it, and agreed to start a band with Cobain. After high school, Novoselic worked as a painter and decorator but was eventually laid off.\nCareer.\nNirvana (1987\u20131994).\nCobain and Novoselic's first band lasted barely a few weeks before it disbanded, leaving the pair to move on. However, the duo eventually discovered that the Melvins could pull $80 a night for one show. Inspired, Cobain and Novoselic started a Creedence Clearwater Revival cover band, in which Cobain played drums and Novoselic sang and played guitar. That band was short-lived as well. Some months later, Cobain and Novoselic met drummer Aaron Burckhard. While the new band never used the name, it was the first incarnation of Nirvana.\nBurckhard lasted only a few months and Melvins' drummer Dale Crover filled in until Novoselic and Cobain met Chad Channing. The trio recorded their debut album \"Bleach\", released in 1989. Channing left the band in 1990 and was briefly replaced by Crover and Mudhoney drummer Dan Peters. Novoselic contributed to the writing of various songs, providing ideas for Cobain.\nLater in 1990, Melvins' singer-guitarist Buzz Osborne encouraged Novoselic and Cobain to check out a punk band called Scream. The pair were impressed by their drummer, Dave Grohl. A few weeks later, Scream disbanded, and Grohl placed a call to Osborne for advice. Osborne gave him Novoselic's phone number, and Novoselic invited Grohl up to Seattle (from San Francisco, where Scream broke up). Grohl passed the audition and joined Nirvana. Grohl was Nirvana's fifth and final drummer. Novoselic spent the following months with Nirvana traveling to various labels as the band shopped for a deal, eventually signing with DGC Records.\nIn the spring of 1991, the band entered Sound City Studios in Los Angeles to record \"Nevermind.\" Novoselic helped write the song \"Polly\". Upon its release, \"Nevermind\" (1991) exceeded all expectations and became a worldwide commercial success.\" Nevermind\" had launched the band as a worldwide phenomenon with their hit single \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\".\nAt the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards, Nirvana would win awards for Best New Artist in a Video and Best Alternative Video for \"Smells Like Teen Spirit.\" At the show, Nirvana performed \"Lithium\". When Novoselic started playing the opening bass riff, he signaled that he could not hear his bass. Instead of continuing to play, Novoselic threw his bass guitar in the air, to perform a \"Bass Toss.\" He failed to catch it, later stating that he misjudged the height; he further stated that he \"faked like he was knocked out.\" Musician Brian May ran to give him medical attention; he did not suffer any injuries.\nIn 1992, Novoselic and the rest of Nirvana released a compilation album named \"Incesticide\". Novoselic helped write lyrics for the songs \"Dive\", \"Hairspray Queen\", and \"Aneurysm\" on the album. This album was produced by a joint venture between DGC and Sub Pop.\nDuring Nirvana's 1992 Reading concert, Novoselic sang Oakland punk band 'Fang's' \"The Money Will Roll Right In\" with Cobain. Novoselic was an occasional vocalist and backing vocalist in Nirvana, occasionally singing \"Scoff\" and \"Rape Me\" at live shows. Novoselic stated that \"I kind of discovered my voice for the first time, and the more I did it, the better it got.\"\nIn September 1993, Nirvana's third album \"In Utero\", debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. However, the recording sessions mixed by Steve Albini were criticized by the band members, saying some songs \"didn't sound perfect\", as well as the band agreeing that Novoselic's bass lines sounded \"too low\". \"In Utero\" sold 3.5 million copies in the United States. In November of that year, Nirvana performed on MTV Unplugged with Lori Goldston playing cello, the introduction of guitarist Pat Smear, and Novoselic playing acoustic bass guitar, accordion, and acoustic rhythm guitar. This live performance was released a year later as an album, named \"MTV Unplugged in New York,\" which earned a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Performance.\nPrior to their 1994 European tour, the band scheduled session time at Robert Lang Studios in Seattle to work on demos. For most of the three-day session, Cobain was absent, so Novoselic and Grohl worked on demos of their own songs. The duo completed several songs, including \"Exhausted\", \"Big Me\", \"February Stars\", and \"Butterflies\". On the third day of the session, Cobain finally arrived. The song \"You Know You're Right\" was the band's final studio recording.\nNirvana ended abruptly in April 1994 following Cobain's death. For most of the rest of that year, Novoselic retreated from the spotlight. One of a few public appearances came that September at the MTV Video Music Awards, where the video for Nirvana's \"Heart-Shaped Box\" was awarded Best Alternative Video. Novoselic took the opportunity to pay tribute to Cobain.\nOn April 10, 2014, Novoselic was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Nirvana. Novoselic spoke at the band's induction ceremony. On February 4, 2023, Nirvana received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award; Novoselic was on hand, along with Dave Grohl and Pat Smear, to receive the award.\nPost-Nirvana (1995\u2013present).\nAfter Cobain's death, Novoselic continued to dabble in musical endeavors. He co-formed the band Sweet 75 with Venezuelan musician Yva Las Vegass in 1995, releasing a single self-titled album in 1997. In 1996, Novoselic joined singer Johnny Cash, guitarist Kim Thayil of Soundgarden and drummer Sean Kinney of Alice in Chains to record a cover of Willie Nelson's \"Time of the Preacher\", for the tribute album \"Twisted Willie\", released in January 1996. In 1998, Novoselic directed his first movie, \"L7: \", a pseudo-documentary that utilizes concert footage taped in 1997 in three American cities. In 1999, he joined Jello Biafra and Soundgarden guitarist Kim Thayil in the No WTO Combo.\nIn 2002, Novoselic performed uncredited background vocals on Foo Fighters' song \"Walking a Line\", written as a tribute to Cobain, during the \"One by One\" album sessions. The track is included on the \"One by One\" bonus DVD, as well as being a bonus track to the album. He then joined former Meat Puppets front man Curt Kirkwood and former Sublime drummer Bud Gaugh to form Eyes Adrift. In Australia, there was another group called \"Eyes Adrift\", and rather than pay to license that name, the trio called the band and album \"Bud, Curt &amp; Krist\" in this nation. Eyes Adrift released a self-titled album with twelve songs, with the Japanese version including two extras. Eyes Adrift was the first official release in Krist's career where he sang lead vocals, singing lead on \"Inquiring Minds\", \"Dottie Dawn &amp; Julie Jewel\" and \"Pasted\". They also released a single named \"Alaska\". He also took a highly active role in the songwriting process, co-writing several songs with Kirkwood. They toured mostly around the United States. The group disbanded in 2003.\nFollowing the end of Eyes Adrift, Novoselic announced that he was quitting the music business, noting that he disliked the process of building up publicity for new records. However, in 2005, Novoselic had occasionally worked on music for a possible solo album, noting, \"Right now, I'm just doing it for myself, and that's what it's all about.\"\nIn November 2006, it was announced that Novoselic would join Flipper, replacing Bruno DeSmartas on bass, for a tour of the United Kingdom and Ireland. He was a full-time member of the band and had been working on their new album. On September 22, 2008, because of responsibilities at home, Novoselic announced his departure from the band. As a result, the band canceled the remainder of the tour. Rachel Thoele then replaced Novoselic.\nIn 2009, Novoselic played a newspaper vendor in the movie \"World's Greatest Dad\" starring Robin Williams. In October 2010, Dave Grohl, former Nirvana bandmate of Novoselic, announced live on BBC radio, that Novoselic would be joining Foo Fighters as a bassist and accordionist on their next album, \"Wasting Light\", which was released in 2011. Novoselic also played bass on children's music artist Caspar Babypants' 2010 album \"This Is Fun!\", for a cover of the Nirvana song \"Sliver\". In 2011, he performed \"On a Plain\" and \"Sliver\" with the band at the \"Nevermind\" 20th anniversary celebration in Seattle.\nIn 2012, Novoselic and Grohl partnered with Paul McCartney on the song \"Cut Me Some Slack\", which was composed specially for \"Sound City\", directed by Grohl. The song was first shown on December 12, 2012, at the , which brought together music stars for the victims of Hurricane Sandy in New York. The song was received well by critics. Allmusic called it a \"tune with an immediate hook [and] melody\". The song won the Grammy award for Best Rock Song in 2014. The partnership was referred to as \"Sirvana\" by Novoselic, referring to \"Sir Paul McCartney\".\nOn April 17, 2016, Novoselic performed \"Helter Skelter\" with Paul McCartney in Seattle as part of the One on One tour. In November 2016, Novoselic confirmed that he was in the process of writing new music. Novoselic then founded the band Giants in the Trees in 2017, featuring band members Jillian Raye, Erik Friend and Ray Prestegard. He also played in the band Filthy Friends, contributing bass and accordion on their debut album \"Invitation\". He also collaborates with Lepidopterist and author Robert Michael Pyle with the musical project Butterfly Launches from Spar Pole. In late July 2017, Giants in the Trees released their first song, \"Sasquatch\", which features a music video Novoselic joked as \"costing over 2 million U.S. dollars to produce\". Giants in the Trees' first album was released in late 2017. Giants In The Trees' second album, \"Volume 2\", was released in 2019. In 2020, Giants in the Trees dissolved, with Novoselic attributing the dissolution to COVID-19.\nNovoselic has been currently working with musicians such as Soundgarden's Kim Thayil, alongside Matt Cameron, with production being handled by Jack Endino, as a new band, called 3rd Secret. A self-titled album was released in April 2022, with eleven songs recorded at The Bait Shop, in Ballard, Washington, as well as Novoselic's home, on which Novoselic contributed acoustic guitar, accordion, and bass. In June 2023, 3rd Secret released their second studio album \"The 2nd 3rd Secret\" featuring Novoselic.\nPerformance and recording with Foo Fighters.\nIn 1994, Grohl founded a new band, Foo Fighters. Grohl and his bandmates decided against Novoselic joining; Grohl said it would have felt \"really natural\" for them to work together again, but would have been uncomfortable for the other band members and placed more pressure on Grohl.\nDuring the encore of the Foo Fighters' show on August 29, 1997, at Memorial Stadium as part of the Bumbershoot festival, Novoselic played bass on covers of \"Purple Rain\" and \"Communication Breakdown\". In January 2002, Novoselic performed backing vocals for a non-album Foo Fighters track titled \"Walking a Line\", later released on a special edition of their album \"One by One\".\nDuring the encore of Foo Fighters' secret show at Paladino's in Tarzana, California on December 22, 2010, the band, with Grohl on drums, was joined onstage by Novoselic and the band's live guitarist Pat Smear for a version of Nirvana's \"Marigold\", a 1992 Grohl original, which was a B-side on Nirvana's \"Heart-Shaped Box\". Novoselic also recorded bass and accordion for the song \"I Should Have Known\", appearing on Foo Fighters' seventh studio album \"Wasting Light\".\nOn December 5, 2017, Novoselic joined Foo Fighters on stage at Matthew Knight Arena in Eugene, Oregon, to play bass guitar on \"Big Me\", a song from the Foo Fighters' debut album \"Foo Fighters\". Ten months later, on October 6, 2018, Novoselic joined the band during an encore to play several Nirvana songs, with Grohl on drums, Pat Smear on guitar, and John J. McCauley and Joan Jett filling in as their lead singer.\nPolitical and social activism.\nNovoselic was interested in politics at a young age, including the Northern Ireland conflict between Irish Nationalists and Unionists.\nIn 1992, the Washington State Legislature attempted to pass a bill called the Erotic Music Law. The law would have allowed courts to declare certain albums \"erotic\" due to their content and would have made it illegal to sell those albums to anyone under the age of 18. Novoselic and Nirvana actively campaigned against the bill and performed a benefit concert for an organization that opposed it. Novoselic appeared on KOMO-TV's \"Town Meeting\" as part of the campaign against this bill.\nIn 1995, the Erotic Music Law was reintroduced to the Washington State Legislature as the Matters Harmful to Minors bill. Noting that the music industry had serious clout in Seattle given the success of the grunge scene, Novoselic proposed creating a political action committee, which was named JAMPAC (Joint Artists and Musicians Political Action Committee). Over the next several years, JAMPAC fought a number of different issues, including the Teen Dance Ordinance, a 1985 law that strictly limited the ability of minors to attend shows. With JAMPAC, Novoselic began to turn his focus more and more towards politics.\nNovoselic has advocated for electoral reform (especially instant-runoff voting and proportional representation). He considered a 2004 run for Lieutenant Governor of Washington as a Democrat, challenging an incumbent of the same party, but ultimately decided against it. He also joined the board of FairVote (then the Center for Voting and Democracy) and was appointed chair in January 2008. In 2020, Novoselic became board chair of Z\u00f3calo Public Square.\nNovoselic's first book, \"\", was published in October 2004. It covers Novoselic's musical past, including Nirvana's worldwide popularity in the early 1990s.\nNovoselic supported Democratic Senator Barack Obama in the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries and in the 2008 general election. He later broke with the Democratic Party, stating that \"it's a top-down structure\" averse to reform from its grassroots. \nIn 2009, Novoselic ran for county clerk of Wahkiakum County, Washington, but later withdrew his candidacy. He had sought the office as a candidate of the \"Grange Party\" (a reference to his membership in the National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry) although no such party exists. His campaign was intended as a protest against Washington State's party system, in which a candidate can claim any party (real or fictional) as their own without consent or support from the party. Novoselic explained his support for fair voting reforms on C-SPAN's \"Washington Journal\" in 2012.\nIn 2014, Novoselic voiced his support for Eddie Vedder\u2018s statements regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\nIn an interview for \"Reason TV\", Novoselic was asked how he described his political views. He responded, \"I'm an anarcho-capitalist, socialist, moderate... I don't know\" and continued to say that while his political views couldn't be easily categorized, he finds fault in the political philosophies of both the left and right-wing. In 2015, he supported Lawrence Lessig's presidential campaign. In 2016, Novoselic supported and campaigned for Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson.\nIn June 2020, Novoselic made a Facebook post discussing President Donald Trump's speech in response to unrest following the murder of George Floyd. He called Trump \"strong and direct\" but added that he \"should not be sending troops into states\". Following criticism, Novoselic made his Facebook page private and deleted his Twitter account. After receiving backlash for the original post, Novoselic clarified: \"As an avowed independent, I don't endorse a major party or candidate. And it feels insane to have to say this, but I don't support fascism, and I don't support an authoritarian state. I believe in a civilized society and that we all have to work toward that\".\nOn May 22, 2023, the Forward Party published a tweet welcoming Novoselic onto their board.\nIn 2024, Novoselic founded the Cascade Party of Washington, a minor political party. To qualify as a political party, he announced a campaign for president in the 2024 United States presidential election, with a goal to gather 1,000 signatures. On August 24, 2024, he gathered the votes needed, and dropped out.\nIn other media.\nIn November 2007, Novoselic started writing blogs for the \"Seattle Weekly\" website. He stopped writing for Seattle Weekly in September 2010.\nNovoselic has been the DJ numerous times for Coast radio on KMUN.\nIn 2014, ahead of Nirvana's induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Novoselic and Dave Grohl made guest appearances on \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\".\nPersonal life.\nIn 1989, Novoselic married Shelli Hyrkas, whom he had dated in high school. They divorced in 1999. In early 2004, he married American artist Darbury Ayn Stenderu. Together they have two children. They reside on a farm near Deep River, Washington, where they grow their own food. Novoselic stated, \"I live out in the country now and it's quiet and it's a place where I can think a lot.\"\nNovoselic is an FAA-licensed pilot, earning a single-engine land rating after passing his flight test in April 2002. He went on to earn a multi-engine pilot certificate in February 2018. He has a strong interest in animals, geology, nature, and other sciences.\nIn 2016, Novoselic earned a BSc in social sciences from Washington State University.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "52725", "revid": "5718152", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52725", "title": "Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer", "text": "English progressive rock band\nEmerson, Lake &amp; Palmer (informally known as ELP) were an English progressive rock supergroup formed in London in 1970. The band consisted of Keith Emerson (keyboards) of the Nice, Greg Lake (vocals, bass, guitars, producer) of King Crimson, and Carl Palmer (drums, percussion) of Atomic Rooster. With nine RIAA-certified gold record albums in the US, and an estimated 48 million records sold worldwide, they were one of the most popular and commercially successful progressive rock groups of the 1970s, with a musical sound including adaptations of classical music with jazz and symphonic rock elements, dominated by Emerson's flamboyant use of the Hammond organ, Moog synthesizer, and piano (although Lake wrote several acoustic songs for the group).\nThe band came to prominence following their performance at the Isle of Wight Festival in August 1970. In their first year, the group signed with E.G. Records (who distributed the band's records through Island Records in the United Kingdom, and Atlantic Records in North America), and released \"Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer\" (1970) and \"Tarkus\" (1971), both of which reached the UK top five. The band's success continued with \"Pictures at an Exhibition\" (1971), \"Trilogy\" (1972), and \"Brain Salad Surgery\" (1973, released on ELP's own Manticore Records label). After a three-year break, Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer released \"Works Volume 1\" (1977) and \"Works Volume 2\" (1977). After \"Love Beach\" (1978), the group disbanded in 1979.\nThe band re-formed partially in the 1980s as Emerson, Lake &amp; Powell featuring Cozy Powell in place of Palmer, who was, by then, a member of Asia. Robert Berry then replaced Lake while Palmer returned, forming 3. In 1991, the original trio re-formed and released two more albums, \"Black Moon\" (1992) and \"In the Hot Seat\" (1994), and toured at various times between 1992 and 1998. Their final performance took place in 2010 at the High Voltage Festival in London to commemorate the band's 40th anniversary. Both Emerson and Lake died in 2016, leaving Palmer as the only surviving member of the band.\nStylistically, the band was known for \"[combining] heavy riffs with classical influences.\" Bruce Eder of AllMusic wrote, \"Their flamboyance on record and in the studio echoed the best work of the heavy metal bands of the era, proving that classical rockers could compete for that arena-scale audience.\"\nHistory.\n1969\u20131970: Formation and first gigs.\nBy the end of 1969, the Nice keyboardist Keith Emerson and King Crimson bassist/vocalist Greg Lake were looking to leave their respective groups and form a new band. The pair first met in New York City and discussed the possibility of forming one together; they met again in December 1969 when the Nice and King Crimson were billed together for concerts at the Fillmore West in San Francisco. During a soundcheck before one of the shows, Emerson described the first time he and Lake played together: \"Greg was moving a bass line and I played the piano in back and Zap! It was there.\" When the Nice split in March 1970 and Lake left King Crimson a month later, the pair began the search for a drummer, which turned out to be a difficult process. They initially approached Mitch Mitchell, who was at a loose end following the break-up of the Jimi Hendrix Experience and suggested a jam session take place among the three of them and guitarist Jimi Hendrix. The session never happened, but it led to the press later reporting rumours of a planned supergroup named HELP, an acronym for \"Hendrix Emerson Lake Palmer\", which Lake later debunked. As part of auditions for drummers at a studio by Soho Square, Emerson's manager, Tony Stratton Smith, suggested Carl Palmer of Atomic Rooster and previously the Crazy World of Arthur Brown. Palmer turned up for a session and enjoyed the chemistry, but was reluctant to commit as Atomic Rooster were starting to gain attention in Europe. Emerson and Lake persisted, and after several weeks Palmer agreed to join.\nThe three named themselves Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer to remove the focus on Emerson as the most famous of the three, and to ensure that they were not called the \"new Nice\". Triton was a name that Emerson said \"was buzzing around\" for a little while, and Triumvirate and Seahorse were also in contention. They moved to Island Studios in Notting Hill to rehearse and form a live set. Most of the numbers were rock adaptations and arrangements of classical pieces, including: \"Allegro barbaro\" by B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k entitled \"The Barbarian\", the jazz standard \"Blue Rondo \u00e0 la Turk\" by Dave Brubeck entitled \"Rondo\" that Emerson had recorded with the Nice, \"Nut Rocker\" as an encore, and \"Pictures at an Exhibition\" by Modest Mussorgsky that Emerson wanted to do after seeing it performed by an orchestra. An original song from Lake, \"Take a Pebble\", was also worked out. The group wished to enhance their live act, and spent \u00a39,000 on a sound mixer and \u00a34,000 on a Moog modular synthesizer imported from America that was adapted for better performance on stage.\nThe trio's first live gig followed at Plymouth Guildhall on 23 August 1970, supported by Earth, a local band. They travelled to the venue in a transit van previously owned by fellow progressive rock band Yes, and were paid around \u00a3400 for the gig. A small venue outside London was deliberately chosen in case the concert was a failure, but the concert was well received. Their second gig took place on 29 August with a set at the Isle of Wight Festival which was attended by an estimated 600,000 people and drew considerable attention from the public and music press. At the end of \"Pictures at an Exhibition\", the band fired two cannons that Emerson had tested in a field near Heathrow Airport.\nThe success of the group's debut, as well as Lake's prior association with King Crimson, led to the band signing management and recording contracts with E.G. Records, who distributed their records through Island in the UK and Cotillion, a subsidiary of Atlantic Records, in North America. Emerson believed that Atlantic's chief and co-founder Ahmet Ertegun agreed to take the band on \"because we could sell out 20,000-seaters before we even had a record out. That was enough for him to think that a lot of people would go out and buy the record when it did come out.\"\n1970\u20131971: Debut album, \"Tarkus\", and \"Pictures at an Exhibition\".\nIn the months surrounding their debut gigs, the band recorded their first album, \"Emerson Lake &amp; Palmer\", at Advision Studios. Lake took on the role of producer, which he had also done in King Crimson, with Eddy Offord as their engineer. The album included studio versions of \"The Barbarian\" and \"Take a Pebble\", \"Knife-Edge\", based on the first movement of \"Sinfonietta\" by Leo\u0161 Jan\u00e1\u010dek and the Allemande of French Suite No. 1 in D minor by Johann Sebastian Bach, Palmer's drum solo \"Tank\", the three-part \"The Three Fates\", and \"Lucky Man\", an acoustic ballad that Lake wrote when he was twelve. The album was released in the UK in November 1970, and reached No. 4 in the UK and No. 18 in the US. \"Lucky Man\" was released as a single that peaked at No. 48 in the US.\nFrom September 1970 to March 1971, the band completed their first concert tour with shows across the UK, Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. Emerson used a large Moog modular synthesizer on stage but it was unreliable as heat affected its sound. Their performance on 9 December 1970 at the Lyceum Theatre in London was filmed and released in UK theatres in 1972 with added psychedelic effects including characters from Marvel Comics.\nDuring a break in their first tour in January 1971, Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer returned to Advision Studios with Offord to record their second album, \"Tarkus\". Friction between Emerson and Lake during the early recording sessions almost caused the group to disband as Lake disliked the material that Emerson was writing. Following a meeting with the band and management, Lake agreed to write his own songs and continue recording. The album was recorded in six days. The album's first side is occupied by the 20-minute title track, a seven-part song based on reverse evolution that was recorded in four days. Its cover art was designed by painter and graphic designer William Neal. \"Tarkus\" was released in June 1971 and was a commercial success, reaching No. 1 in the UK and No. 9 in the US. The band resumed touring with their first North American tour, starting 24 April 1971 at Thiel College in Greenville, Pennsylvania, and continued until the end of May. Further dates across Europe followed until the end of the year.\nThe band's third album, \"Pictures at an Exhibition\", was released as a budget album in the UK in November 1971. It features their version of the Mussorgsky suite performed live at Newcastle City Hall on 26 March 1971 plus the concert's encore, \"Nut Rocker\". It was to be released before \"Tarkus\", but the group delayed its release on purpose to show the music press and public that they could write their own songs, and were not merely \"the band that did classical music\". Atlantic Records declined to release it in the US, claiming it would not sell or receive any radio airplay because of its classical orientation and offered to release it on its sister label Nonesuch Records which handled budget, classical, and avant-garde albums. The band refused until Island imported 250,000 copies into the US which quickly sold, helped by radio DJ Scott Muni playing the entire album on WNEW-FM in New York City. The strong response prompted Atlantic to release it through Cotillion at full price in January 1972. The album peaked at No. 3 in the UK and No. 10 in the US.\n1971\u20131974: \"Trilogy\" and \"Brain Salad Surgery\".\n\"Trilogy\", the band's third studio album, was recorded at Advision Studios with Offord between October 1971 and January 1972. Its cover art was designed by Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell of Hipgnosis. \"Hoedown\" is an adaptation of \"Rodeo\" by Aaron Copland. Released in July 1972, \"Trilogy\" reached No. 2 in the UK and No. 5 in the US. \"From the Beginning\", an acoustic ballad featuring an extended synthesizer solo, was released as a single which reached No. 39 in the US. Lake has picked \"Trilogy\" as his favourite studio album by the band. The album was supported with a North American tour in March and April 1972 which included a spot at the Mar y Sol Pop Festival in Manat\u00ed, Puerto Rico on 3 April. Following dates across Europe, including their first in Italy, the band performed at the Concert 10 Festival at Pocono International Raceway in Long Pond, Pennsylvania, on 9 July 1972. This was followed by their first dates in Japan where a riot broke out during the show in Osaka, causing the power to be cut and the group fleeing the stage.\nIn early 1973, the band formed their own record label, Manticore Records, and purchased an abandoned cinema as their own rehearsal hall in Fulham, London. In June 1973, Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer began recording \"Brain Salad Surgery\" in London at Advision and Olympic Studios which lasted until September that year. Offord was not present for the recording sessions as he was working with Yes, leaving engineering and mixing duties to Chris Kimsey and Geoff Young. Lake wrote the album's lyrics with Peter Sinfield and its sleeve was designed by H. R. Giger and includes the band's new logo. Formed of five tracks, the album includes a rendition of \"Jerusalem\" which features the debut of the Moog Apollo, a prototype polyphonic synthesizer. \"Toccata\" is a cover of the fourth movement of Piano Concerto No. 1 by Argentine composer Alberto Ginastera and contains synthesised percussion in the form of an acoustic drum kit fitted with pick-ups that triggered electronic sounds. The 29-minute track \"Karn Evil 9\" is the longest song recorded by the group. \"Brain Salad Surgery\" was released in November 1973 and reached No. 2 in the UK and No. 11 in the US.\nFrom November 1973 to August 1974, the band toured North America and Europe which saw them carry almost 40 tons of equipment. On 6 April 1974, the band headlined the inaugural California Jam Festival at the Ontario Motor Speedway, California, to an attendance of 250,000 people. The show was filmed and broadcast across the US. These shows exhibited a mix of virtuoso musicianship and over-the-top performances which some criticised as excessive, such as Emerson playing a piano as it spun, suspended, end-over-end; Palmer playing on a rotating drum platform; and Emerson throwing a Hammond organ around the stage to create feedback. Emerson often used a knife, given to him by Lemmy Kilmister, who had roadied for the Nice, to force the keys on the organ to stay down. The tour was one of the top concert draws during the 1973\u20131974 period. Performances from Anaheim, California, were documented in the live album, \"Welcome Back, My Friends, to the Show That Never Ends ~ Ladies and Gentlemen\", released in August 1974 as a triple LP. The album peaked at No. 5 in the UK and No. 4 in the US.\n1974\u20131978: Hiatus and \"Works\".\nAfter touring in 1974, the band took an extended break. The three members bought homes overseas and became tax exiles in the process, but Emerson suffered a setback in 1975 when his Sussex home burned down and lost most of his possessions. The ordeal left him depressed, and he later credited his bandmates in helping him recover from drug misuse.\nThey regrouped in 1976 to record \"Works Volume 1\" at Mountain Studios in Montreux, Switzerland and EMI Studios in Paris, France. It is a double album with one side of an LP containing songs by each member and a fourth of group material. Much of the album was recorded with an orchestral accompaniment; Emerson's side consists of his 18-minute, three-movement \"Piano Concerto No. 1\". Lake contributed five songs he co-wrote with Sinfield, and Palmer's includes two covers of classical pieces by Sergei Prokofiev and Bach as well as an orchestral remake of \"Tank\" from the group's debut album. One of the two group tracks, \"Fanfare for the Common Man\", is a cover of the same-titled orchestral piece by Aaron Copland, who gave permission to have the band release it. \"Works Volume 1\" was released in March 1977 and peaked at No. 9 in the UK and No. 12 in the US. A single of \"Fanfare for the Common Man\" was released and reached No. 2 in the UK, the band's highest charting UK single. In November 1977, \"Works Volume 2\" was released as a compilation of shorter tracks recorded from 1973 to 1976 during various album recording sessions. The album was not as commercially successful as the band's previous albums; it reached No. 20 in the UK and No. 37 in the US. Three tracks from the album were released as singles: \"Tiger in a Spotlight\", \"Maple Leaf Rag\", and \"Watching Over You\".\nThe two \"Works\" albums were supported by North American tours which lasted from May 1977 to February 1978, spanning over 120 dates. The original plan was to have an orchestra on stage with the band each night, but the idea was dropped after 11 shows due to the high costs and difficulties with the orchestra unions. The 64-piece orchestra and choir were formed from the 500 who auditioned for a position. The orchestra was used two other times on the tour: for three dates at Madison Square Garden in New York City and the August 1977 show at the Olympic Stadium in Montreal that was attended by an estimated 78,000 people, the highest attended Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer concert as a solo act. The concert was filmed and released as a live album in 1979 entitled \"Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer in Concert\" that reached No. 73 in the US. Emerson wished for a double album release, but Atlantic Records decided against it due to the band's pending dissolution at its time of release. In 1993, the album was repackaged with additional tracks as \"Works Live\", and put out on video in 1998. Emerson later said that his insistence on the band using an orchestra was a mistake, but he was unwilling to tour without one. Lake looked back on this period as the beginning of the end of the group's original run.\n1978\u20131979: \"Love Beach\" and first break-up.\nAfter their 1977\u201378 tour, the band discussed their next move. Emerson recalled that in order for the group to continue, \"we would have to do a lot of cutting down\" and considered the possibility of producing music with just a piano, bass guitar, and drums. As the group were contractually obliged to record one more studio album, the band relocated to Emerson's home near Nassau in the Bahamas and recorded \"Love Beach\" at the nearby Compass Point Studios in 1978. Lake did not carry out the production duties, leaving Emerson to complete the record on his own after his bandmates returned home when recording was complete. The album has been dismissed by the band, who explained it was produced to fulfil a contractual obligation. Sinfield is credited on the majority of the tracks as a lyricist except \"Canario\", an instrumental based on \"Fantas\u00eda para un gentilhombre\" by Spanish composer Joaqu\u00edn Rodrigo. The second side is taken up with \"Memoirs of an Officer and a Gentleman\", a four-part 20-minute track that tells a coming of age story of a soldier during the World War II-era. Its cover is a photograph of the group at a beach off an island from Salt Cay, Turks Islands, \"decked out as bare-chested late-seventies disco stars\". Despite Emerson expressing his disapproval on the album's title and cover to Ertegun, neither was changed.\n\"Love Beach\" was released in November 1978 and was poorly received by the music press. \"All I Want Is You\" was released as a single in the UK, but failed to chart. It did sell enough to be certified gold in the US for 500,000 copies sold, in January 1979. In early 1979, Palmer attempted to organise a farewell summer tour and have the group disband at its conclusion. Due to internal problems, such as \"what we should play and how we should play it\", the tour never materialised. The band made no announcement of their break-up, and Palmer moved on by forming a band, PM, which released one album entitled \"1PM\".\n1985\u20131989: Related activity.\nIn 1985, Emerson and Lake formed Emerson, Lake &amp; Powell with former Rainbow drummer Cozy Powell. Palmer declined to participate in a reunion as he was busy with commitments with Asia. Rumours also linked Bill Bruford to their new line-up, but he was committed to King Crimson and Earthworks. The group's only album, \"Emerson Lake &amp; Powell\", was released in June 1986 and charted at No. 35 in the UK and No. 23 in the US. The single \"Touch and Go\" went to No. 60 in the US and No. 2 on the \"Billboard\" Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. The trio toured the album in 1986, playing material by the Nice and Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer.\nIn 1988, Emerson and Palmer joined with Robert Berry to form the band 3. They released an album, \"To the Power of Three\", in 1988.\n1990\u20131998: Re-formation, \"Black Moon\", \"In the Hot Seat\", and second break-up.\nIn 1990, former Atlantic Records executive Phil Carson approached Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer to reunite and produce music for a proposed film. The project never developed, but the trio remained in London and started to come up with new musical ideas. The sessions were productive, with the band working as much as five to six days a week for three months, which convinced them to abandon soundtrack work in favour of putting out a new album. By mid-1991, Carson had secured them with a two-album deal with his new independent label, Victory Music. Lake's voice had deepened by this point, and the band took greater care in the key that songs were written to better suit his vocals. They also utilised modern recording technology to complement the songs, including MIDI and digital sampling, which Palmer said kept their material fresh. Atlantic capitalised on the reunion by releasing \"The Atlantic Years\", a two-and-a-half hour compilation of their early material.\n\"Black Moon\" was released in July 1992; it peaked at No. 78 in the US but failed to chart in the UK. The group supported it with a world tour between July 1992 and April 1993, which included their first shows in England since 1974. The concerts at London's Royal Albert Hall were broadcast on BBC radio and released as a live album in 1993, entitled \"Live at the Royal Albert Hall\". The shows were also filmed and subsequently released on DVD. Later in 1993, Victory Music released \"The Return of the Manticore\" a 4-disc box set retrospective of the band's career and previously unreleased studio tracks, including a new studio recording of \"Pictures at an Exhibition\" in Dolby surround sound.\nThe band's final studio album, \"In the Hot Seat\", was released in September 1994. Victory Music was in financial trouble by this time, as albums by fellow label acts Tin Machine and Yes failed to generate strong enough sales, causing Victory and producer Keith Olsen to put pressure on Emerson to make a more commercially oriented album with the band. When Emerson reluctantly agreed, Victory and Olsen brought in several individuals to assist in the songwriting; Olsen received a credit on four tracks and Bill Wray on two. In the summer of 1994, the band cancelled an upcoming North American and Japanese tour, and the group split for a short period to pursue solo projects. Emerson underwent surgery to correct a compressed nerve in his arm in October, which left him able to play at only half his previous capacity. Palmer also had an operation to fix his carpal tunnel syndrome. Initial plans to commemorate the band's 25th anniversary in 1995 were shelved. Following the demise of Victory Music, their back catalogue transferred to Rhino Records.\nEmerson and Palmer eventually recovered enough to start touring again from August 1996, beginning with a 33-date US tour opening for Jethro Tull. This was followed by a Japanese tour in October, where the group played a full set. In 1997, the band completed a 50-date world tour. It is noted for Emerson's Hammond organ catching fire during the show in Boston. The remains were donated to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In May 1998, Lake's manager announced that the band had started work on a new studio album. This was followed by a North American tour in August as openers for Deep Purple and Dream Theater, which included the \"Tarkus\" suite performed in its entirety for the first time since 1974. After the tour, friction arose within the group as Lake wanted to relinquish his role as producer on the new album, and blamed the band's recent creative lull on this fact. Emerson and Palmer were against the idea, and claimed Lake had not presented any tangible material for them to work on despite knowing he was collecting ideas for a solo album. The rift resulted in the trio's split by the end of 1998, and a tour booked for the spring of 1999 was cancelled.\n2010\u2013present: 40th anniversary concert, deaths of Emerson and Lake, and aftermath.\nIn April and May 2010, Emerson and Lake embarked on a North American tour, 'Manticore Hall', with stripped-down versions of Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, the Nice, and King Crimson songs. It originated when the pair got together at Lake's home studio earlier in the year to write new songs. When they stopped for a break, they occasionally played an Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer song which led to the idea of recreating it on stage as it gave the songs a different feel to the originals. The first show of the tour was cancelled at the last minute following a backstage argument between Emerson and Lake, and the following two dates were subsequently cancelled. Later in 2010, the 4-CD box set \"A Time and a Place\" was released that features live tracks from 1970 to 1998. Two archival concerts followed in 2011: \"Live at Nassau Coliseum '78\" and \"Live at the Mar Y Sol Festival '72\".\nIn September 2009, Palmer announced that the band had planned to reform earlier in the year, but it had to be pushed back for Emerson to receive medical attention on one of his hands. The three got together for a one-off concert for their 40th anniversary, headlining the High Voltage Festival at London's Victoria Park on 25 July 2010. The show was recorded and filmed; a live album was released as \"High Voltage\". The DVD and Blu-ray of the concert followed in August 2011, which also contained a documentary on the band's career. Lake said that despite the band having \"tremendous technical problems\" on stage and struggled at points, the audience were enthusiastic and people enjoyed their performance. Palmer held a more critical view, and said the group rehearsed for five weeks before the show, which he initially considered excessive, but upon hearing the recording, \"maybe five weeks was not long enough. It wasn't to the standard that I liked and I didn't think it sounded that good.\"\nFollowing their 2010 reunion, the band expressed differing opinions regarding their future. In early 2010, Emerson and Lake had not ruled out further Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer concerts or the possibility of a new studio album; the former said: \"I see no reason why we shouldn't be doing more.\" In 2011, Lake said that Emerson and he were open to the idea of more group activity, but acknowledged Palmer's more negative comments to the press shortly before the 40th anniversary concert. Lake said: \"I don't know why Carl has a propensity to dwell on negative issues... Keith and I have had our differences over the years, but we've certainly put them behind us and just forgot about them... I'm waiting for Carl to reach the point of wisdom in his life when he realises that carrying around grudges from the past is pointless.\" In 2012, Lake was unsure that a reunion could take place: \"I doubt very much it will happen because I don't think Carl and Keith are in that same frame of mind.\" In 2013, Palmer revealed that he put a stop on further group plans.\nIn December 2010, Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer signed a worldwide licensing deal with Sony Music Entertainment. In 2012, they secured a new back catalogue agreement with American-based Razor &amp; Tie, and acquired a worldwide catalogue distribution deal with BMG Rights Management three years later.\nOn 11 March 2016, Emerson died by suicide from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to his head. On 7 December, Lake died from cancer.\nIn October 2021, Rocket 88 Books released \"Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer\", the first official book about the band that was made in co-operation with Palmer and Emerson and Lake's families, with Palmer as executive editor. It was available in three editions, Classic, Signature, and Ultimate, all containing rare and previously unpublished interviews and photographs.\nInfluence and appraisal.\nA 2016 retrospective review in \"Rolling Stone\" listed \"10 Essential Songs by EL&amp;P\" and noted, \"ELP became one of rock's first supergroups upon forming in 1970\u2026The result was a stretch of albums\u2026that turned prog from a black-light-in-the-basement listening experience into a stadium-filling phenomenon. At their heart was Emerson, whose eternal quest for a bigger, grander sound (thanks to a bank of organs and synthesizers that grew to resemble a fortress onstage) helped make ELP one of the most accomplished and absorbing bands rock ever birthed.\" Koji Kondo, Nintendo's first video game composer, cited ELP as a major influence on his work. Nobuo Uematsu, best known for scoring the majority of titles in the \"Final Fantasy\" series, cites ELP as one of his influences. The trio are described as \"genuinely classically aware, and openly demonstrated their respect for classical music.\" They are said to have \"formed a genuine fusion between rock and jazz\" and were noted for their \"virtuosity and their uninhibited aggression.\"\nDespite their success and influence, ELP received criticism from some music critics, one citing a popular joke from the 1970s: \"How do you spell pretentious? E-L-P.\" Robert Christgau said of the band in \"\" (1981), \"these guys are as stupid as their most pretentious fans\", also calling them the \"world's most overweening 'progressive' group\". John Kelman of \"All About Jazz\" noted that an \"overbearing sense of self-importance turned ELP from one of the 1970s' most exciting new groups into the definition of masturbatory excess and self-aggrandizement in only a few short years.\" Kelman also stated that \"in their fall from grace, [ELP] represented everything wrong with progressive rock.\" Paul Stump, in his \"History of Progressive Rock\", likewise attributed ELP's infamy to their decadent activities during progressive rock's fall from favour: \"What prompted ELP to do what they did to their listeners, their critics and ultimately themselves in 1977 can only be guessed at. What is certain is that it consigned them to eternal rock notoriety. Even discounting Punk, had not the musical climate changed enough to convince them that epics were out of fashion, both on record and in concert?\" DJ John Peel went so far as to describe the band as \"a tragic waste of talent and electricity\". In an appraisal of the band's legacy, \"PopMatters\" journalist Sean Murphy said ELP \"wore immoderation like a badge of courage\", regardless of whether they were loved or loathed:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Here are three words that strike fear in the hearts of all those allergic to prog rock: Emerson. Lake. Palmer. Popular enough to have several songs still in the regular FM rotation, obscure enough to be forever relegated as one of \"those\" bands from a certain time and place (the '70s), ambitious enough to attempt things few if any other bands did, for better or worse, pretentious enough to earn the full-throated derision of holier-than-thou tastemakers. And album art awful enough to ensure they will never be forgotten, for better or worse.\nDiscography.\nMain studio and live discography\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt; \nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources"}
{"id": "52726", "revid": "35111337", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52726", "title": "Green Day", "text": "American rock band\nGreen Day is an American rock band formed in Rodeo, California, in 1987, by the lead singer and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong and the bassist and backing vocalist Mike Dirnt, with the drummer Tr\u00e9 Cool joining in 1990. In 1994, their major-label debut \"Dookie\", released through Reprise Records, became a breakout success and eventually shipped over 20 million copies in the US. Green Day has been credited with reigniting mainstream interest in punk rock.\nBefore taking its current name in 1989, the band was named Sweet Children. They were part of the late 1980s/early 1990s Bay Area punk scene that emerged from 924 Gilman Street, a club in Berkeley, California. The band's early releases were with the independent record label Lookout! Records, including their first album \"39/Smooth\" (1990). For most of the band's career, they have been a power trio with Cool, who replaced John Kiffmeyer in 1990, before the recording of the band's second studio album \"Kerplunk\" (1991). Though the albums \"Insomniac\" (1995), \"Nimrod\" (1997), and \"Warning\" (2000) did not match the success of \"Dookie\", they were still successful, with \"Insomniac\" and \"Nimrod\" reaching double platinum status, while \"Warning\" achieved gold. Green Day's seventh album, a rock opera called \"American Idiot\" (2004), found popularity with a younger generation and sold six million copies in the US. Their next album \"21st Century Breakdown\" was released in 2009. It was followed by a trilogy of albums, \"\u00a1Uno!\", \"\u00a1Dos!\", and \"\u00a1Tr\u00e9!\", released in September, November, and December 2012, respectively. The trilogy did not commercially perform as well as expected, in comparison to their previous albums, largely due to a lack of promotion and Armstrong entering rehab. These albums were followed by \"Revolution Radio\" (2016) - their third to debut at No. 1 on the \" Billboard\" 200 - \"Father of All Motherfuckers\" (2020), and \"Saviors\" (2024).\nIn 2010, a stage adaptation of \"American Idiot\" debuted on Broadway. The musical was nominated for three Tony Awards: Best Musical, Best Scenic Design, and Best Lighting Design, winning the latter two. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2015, their first year of eligibility. Members of the band have collaborated on the side projects Pinhead Gunpowder, the Network, Foxboro Hot Tubs, the Longshot, and the Coverups. They have also worked on solo careers.\nGreen Day has sold roughly 75 million records worldwide as of 2024, making them one of the best-selling music artists. The group has been nominated for 20 Grammy Awards and won five: Best Alternative Album for \"Dookie\", Best Rock Album for \"American Idiot\" and \"21st Century Breakdown\", Record of the Year for \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\", and Best Musical Show Album for \"\".\nHistory.\n1987\u20131993: Formation and Lookout! years.\nIn 1987, guitarist friends Billie Joe Armstrong and Mike Dirnt, both 15 years old at the time, along with bassist Sean Hughes and drummer Raj Punjabi, a fellow student from Pinole Valley High School, formed the band Desecrated Youth and played together in Punjabi's house garage in Rodeo, California.\nA few months later, the band renamed to Sweet Children. One of their first songs written together was \"Best Thing in Town\". The group's first live performance took place on October 17, 1987, at Rod's Hickory Pit in Vallejo, California. In 1988, Armstrong and Dirnt began working with former Isocracy drummer John Kiffmeyer, also known as \"Al Sobrante\", who replaced original drummer Raj Punjabi. It was around this time that bassist Sean Hughes also left the band, causing Dirnt to switch from guitar to bass. Armstrong cites the band Operation Ivy (featuring Tim Armstrong and Matt Freeman, who would later contact Armstrong to fill in as a second guitarist for their band Rancid) as a major influence in inspiring him to form a band.\nIn 1988, Larry Livermore, owner of Lookout! Records, saw the band play an early gig and signed them to his label. In April 1989, the band released its debut extended play \"1,000 Hours\". Shortly before the EP's release, the group dropped the name Sweet Children. According to Livermore, this was done to avoid confusion with another local band Sweet Baby. Sweet Children adopted the name Green Day, instead, due to the members' fondness for cannabis. In the Bay Area, where the band was formed, \"green day\" was slang for spending a day doing nothing but smoking marijuana. Armstrong admitted in 2001 that he considered it to be \"the worst band name in the world\".\nLookout! released Green Day's debut studio album \"39/Smooth\" in early 1990. Green Day recorded two extended plays later that year, \"Slappy\" and \"Sweet Children\", the latter of which included older songs the band recorded for Minneapolis independent label Skene! Records. In 1991, Lookout! Records re-released \"39/Smooth\" as \"1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours\" and added the songs from the band's first two EPs, \"Slappy\" and \"1,000 Hours\". In late 1990, shortly after the band's first nationwide tour, Kiffmeyer left the East Bay area to attend Humboldt State University in Arcata, California. The Lookouts' drummer Tr\u00e9 Cool began filling in temporarily, and later permanently, a situation which Kiffmeyer \"graciously accepted\". The band went on tour for most of 1992 and 1993 and played a number of shows overseas in Europe. By then, the band's second studio album \"Kerplunk\" had sold 50,000 copies in the US. Green Day supported another California punk band Bad Religion as an opening act for their \"Recipe for Hate Tour\" for most of 1993.\n1993\u20131995: Signing with Reprise Records and breakthrough success.\n\"Kerplunks underground success led to interest from major record labels and a bidding war to sign Green Day. The band eventually left Lookout! and signed with Reprise Records after attracting the attention of producer Rob Cavallo. The group was impressed by his work with fellow Californian band the Muffs and later remarked that Cavallo \"was the only person we could talk to and connect with\". Reflecting on this period, Armstrong told \"Spin\" magazine in 1999, \"I couldn't go back to the punk scene, whether we were the biggest success in the world or the biggest failure ... The only thing I could do was get on my bike and go forward.\" After signing with Reprise, the band began recording its major-label debut, \"Dookie\". On September 3, 1993, Green Day played their last show at 924 Gilman under the pseudonym Blair Hess\"' before being banned permanently because of their major label signing.\nRecorded in three weeks and released in February 1994, \"Dookie\" became a commercial success, helped by extensive MTV airplay for the videos of the songs \"Longview\", \"Basket Case\", and \"When I Come Around\", all of which reached the number one position on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. The album went on to sell over 10 million copies in the US. At a performance on September 9, 1994, at Hatch Memorial Shell in Boston, mayhem broke out during the band's set (cut short to seven songs), and by the end of the rampage 100 people were injured and 45 arrested. The band also joined the lineups of both the festivals Lollapalooza and Woodstock '94, at the later of which the group started an infamous mud fight. During the concert a security guard mistook bassist Mike Dirnt for a stage-invading fan and punched out some of his teeth. Viewed by millions on pay-per-view television, the Woodstock 1994 performance further aided Green Day's growing publicity and recognition. In 1995, \"Dookie\" won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Album, and the band was nominated for nine MTV Video Music Awards, including Video of the Year.\nIn the band's homestead East Bay following \"Dookie\"'s success, the band felt a sense of hostility. Billie Joe Armstrong recalled aggressive glares and furtive whispers. The band's success would trickle onto other East Bay bands such as Jawbreaker, a local favorite of Armstrong's, which garnered accusations of selling out during a concert he attended.\n1995\u20132002: Middle years and decline in popularity.\nIn 1995, a single titled \"J.A.R.\" for the \"Angus\" soundtrack was released and debuted at number one on the \"Billboard\" Modern Rock Tracks chart. The band's fourth studio album \"Insomniac\" was released in the fall. Compared to the more melodic \"Dookie,\" \"Insomniac\" was a much darker and heavier response to the band's newfound popularity. The album opened to warm critical reception, earning 4 of 5 stars from \"Rolling Stone\", which said \"In punk, the good stuff unfolds and gains meaning as you listen without sacrificing any of its electric, haywire immediacy. And Green Day are as good as this stuff gets.\" The singles released from \"Insomniac\" were \"Geek Stink Breath\", \"Stuck with Me\", \"Brain Stew/Jaded\", and \"Walking Contradiction\".\nThough the album did not approach the success of \"Dookie\", it sold three million copies in the United States. The album earned the band award nominations for Favorite Artist, Favorite Hard Rock Artist, and Favorite Alternative Artist at the 1996 American Music Awards, and the video for \"Walking Contradiction\" earned the band nominations for Best Video, Short Form, at the Grammys, in addition to Best Special Effects at the MTV Video Music Awards. After that, the band abruptly canceled a European tour, citing exhaustion.\nFollowing a brief hiatus in 1996, Green Day began work on their next album in 1997. From the outset, Cavallo and the band agreed it had to be different from previous albums. The result was \"Nimrod\", an experimental deviation from the band's standard melodic punk rock. The album was released in October 1997 and provided a variety of music, from punk, pop, hardcore, folk, surf rock, and ska, to the acoustic ballad \"Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)\". \"Nimrod\" entered the Billboard charts at Number 10. The mainstream success of \"Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)\" won the band an MTV Video Award for Best Alternative Video. The song was used in the second clip show episode of \"Seinfeld\" and two episodes of \"ER\". The other singles released from \"Nimrod\" were \"Nice Guys Finish Last\", \"Hitchin' a Ride\", and \"Redundant\". The band made a guest appearance in an episode of \"King of the Hill\" later that year. In late 1997 and most of 1998, Green Day embarked on a tour in support of \"Nimrod\". In 1999, Jason White began supporting the band during concerts as guitarist.\nIn 2000, Green Day released their folk-punk-inspired sixth studio album \"Warning,\" and, in support, participated in that year's Warped Tour. In November 2000, in a show produced by Ian Brennan, the band performed for free on the steps on San Francisco's City Hall to protest the eviction of artists from the city. The band also launched an independent tour to support the album in 2001. Critics' reviews of the album were varied. AllMusic gave it 4.5/5, saying, \"\"Warning\" may not be an innovative record per se, but it's tremendously satisfying.\" \"Rolling Stone\" was more critical, giving it 3/5 and saying, \"\"Warning ...\" invites the question: Who wants to listen to songs of faith, hope and social commentary from what used to be snot core's biggest-selling band?\" Though it produced the hit \"Minority\" and smaller hits \"Warning\" and \"Waiting\" , some observers were coming to the conclusion that the band was losing relevance, and a decline in popularity followed. While all of Green Day's previous albums had reached at least triple platinum sales, \"Warning\" was only certified gold.\nAt the 2001 California Music Awards, Green Day won all eight awards for which they were nominated: Outstanding Album (\"Warning\"), Outstanding Punk Rock/Ska Album (\"Warning\"), Outstanding Group, Outstanding Male Vocalist, Outstanding Bassist, Outstanding Drummer, Outstanding Songwriter, and Outstanding Artist. The release of two compilation albums, \"International Superhits!\" and \"Shenanigans\", followed \"Warning\". \"International Superhits!\" had a companion collection of music videos, \"International Supervideos!\" \"Shenanigans\" contained collected B-sides, including \"Espionage\", which was featured in the 1999 film \"\" and nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance. In Spring 2002, Green Day co-headlined the Pop Disaster Tour with Blink-182, documented on the DVD \"Riding in Vans with Boys\".\n2003\u20132006: \"American Idiot\" and renewed success.\nIn the Summer and Fall of 2002, the band wrote and recorded material for an album tentatively titled \"Cigarettes and Valentines\", set to release in August 2003. Dirnt said the album was written and recorded in six months, and the official track list consisted of 16 songs. He also said two or three additional songs were recorded and were something \"worth chasing\" after turning in the record. The band got together and thought the additional songs were really good. Instead of releasing \"Cigarettes and Valentines\", the band decided to make an album with those additional songs, which led to the creation of \"American Idiot\":\nHowever, the band has stated multiple times that when the album was nearly finished, the master recordings were stolen from the studio. Instead of re-recording the stolen tracks, the band decided to abandon the entire project and start over, considering the taken material to be unrepresentative of the band's best work.\nIt was then revealed that a band called The Network was signed to Armstrong's record label Adeline Records with little fanfare and information. After the band, who concealed their identities with masks and costumes, released an album called \"Money Money 2020\" in September 2003, it was rumored that The Network was a Green Day side project, due to similarities in the bands' sounds. At the time, these rumors were not addressed by the band or Adeline Records, except for a statement on the Adeline website discussing an ongoing dispute between the two bands. The bands \"feuded\" via press releases and statements from Armstrong. Several journalists openly referred to the group as a Green Day side project, although it was not confirmed as such until 2013.\nGreen Day collaborated with Iggy Pop on two tracks for his album \"Skull Ring\" in November 2003. On February 1, 2004, a cover of \"I Fought the Law\" (originally performed by The Crickets) made its debut on a commercial for iTunes during NFL Super Bowl XXXVIII.\n\"American Idiot\" was released in September 2004 and debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart. Backed by the success of the album's first single \"American Idiot\", it was the band's first album to reach this pinnacle. \"American Idiot\" was labeled a \"punk rock opera\" and follows the journey of the fictitious \"Jesus of Suburbia\". It depicts modern American life under the control of an idiot ruler who lets people be misinformed by the media and a \"redneck agenda\". It gives different angles on an everyman, modern icons, and leaders. Released two months before US President George W. Bush was reelected, it became protest art and went on to sell 6 million copies in the US.\n\"American Idiot\" won the 2005 Grammy for Best Rock Album and was nominated in six other categories, including Album of the Year. The album helped Green Day win seven of the eight awards it was nominated for at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards; the \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\" video won six of those awards. A year later, \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\" won Grammy Award for Record of the Year. In 2009, \"Kerrang!\" named \"American Idiot\" the best album of the decade, \"NME\" ranked it number 60 in a similar list, and \"Rolling Stone\" ranked it 22nd. \"Rolling Stone\" also listed \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\" and \"American Idiot\" among the 100 best songs of the 2000s, at number 65 and 47, respectively. In 2005, the album ranked 420 in \"Rock Hard\" magazine's book \"The 500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time\". In 2012, the album was ranked number 225 on \"Rolling Stone\"'s list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.\nDuring the American Idiot World Tour, the group filmed and recorded the two concerts at the Milton Keynes National Bowl in England. These recordings were released as a live CD and DVD set \"Bullet in a Bible\" on November 15, 2005. The DVD featured behind-the-scenes footage of the band and showed how its members prepared to put on the show. The final concerts of the 2005 world tour were in Sydney and Melbourne, Australia, on December 14 and 17, respectively.\nOn August 1, 2005, Green Day announced it had rescinded the master rights to its pre-\"Dookie\" material from Lookout Records, citing a continuing breach of contract regarding unpaid royalties, a complaint shared with other Lookout! bands. On January 10, 2006, the band was awarded People's Choice Award for favorite musical group or band.\n2007\u20132011: \"21st Century Breakdown\" and \"American Idiot\"'s stage adaptation.\nGreen Day engaged in many smaller projects in the time following the success of \"American Idiot\". In 2008, under the name Foxboro Hot Tubs, the group released a garage-rock-inspired album titled \"Stop Drop and Roll!!!\". The Foxboro Hot Tubs went on a mini tour to promote the record, hitting tiny Bay Area venues such as the Stork Club in Oakland and Toot's Tavern in Crockett, California.\nIn an interview with Carson Daly, Garbage lead singer Shirley Manson revealed that the band's drummer Butch Vig would be producing Green Day's forthcoming album. The span of nearly five years between \"American Idiot\" and \"21st Century Breakdown\" was the longest gap between studio albums in Green Day's career. The band had been working on new material since January 2006. By October 2007, Armstrong had 45 songs written, but the band showed no further signs of progress until October 2008, when two videos showing the band recording with producer Butch Vig were posted on YouTube. The writing and recording process, spanning three years and four recording studios, was finally finished in April 2009.\n\"21st Century Breakdown\" was released on May 15, 2009. The album received mainly positive reception from critics, who gave it an average rating between 3 and 4 stars. It reached number one in fourteen countries and was certified gold or platinum in each, achieving Green Day's best overall chart performance to date. The band started playing shows in California in April and early May. These were the group's first live shows in about three years. Green Day went on a world tour starting in North America in July 2009, and continued through the rest of 2009 and early 2010. The album won Grammy Award for Best Rock Album at the 52nd Grammy Awards on January 31, 2010. As of December 2010, \"21st Century Breakdown\" has sold 1,005,000 copies in the US.\nWalmart refused to carry the album, as it contains a Parental Advisory sticker, and requested that Green Day release a censored edition. The band members did not wish to change any lyrics on the album and responded by stating, \"There's nothing dirty about our record... They want artists to censor their records in order to be carried in there. We just said no. We've never done it before. You feel like you're in 1953 or something.\"\nIn 2009, the band met with award-winning director Michael Mayer, along with many cast and crew members of the Tony Award-winning musical \"Spring Awakening,\" to create a stage version of the album \"American Idiot\". The musical \"American Idiot\" opened in the Berkeley Repertory Theatre at the end of 2009. The show featured an expanded story of the original album, with new characters such as Will, Extraordinary Girl, and Favorite Son. On April 20, 2010, \"American Idiot\" opened on Broadway, and Green Day released the to the musical, featuring a new song titled \"When It's Time\". In June 2010, it was released as a single on iTunes.\nDuring the Spike TV Video Game Awards 2009, it was announced that Green Day was set to have its own \"Rock Band\" video game titled ' (2010), as a follow-up to the last band-specific game, ' (2009). The game features the full albums of \"Dookie\", \"American Idiot\", and \"21st Century Breakdown,\" as well as select songs from the rest of Green Day's discography.\nDuring the second leg of the 21st Century Breakdown World Tour, the band members stated they were writing new material. In an interview with \"Kerrang!\" magazine, Armstrong spoke about the possible new album: \"We did some demos in Berlin, some in Stockholm, some just outside of Glasgow, and some in Amsterdam. We wanted get [the songs] down in some early form.\" The band members also stated that the group was recording a live album of the tour, featuring the previously unreleased song \"Cigarettes and Valentines\". In October 2010, Dirnt was interviewed by Radio W and mentioned that the group had completed the writing process of their ninth studio album. Dirnt also mentioned that a new live album would most likely be released. The live CD/DVD and CD/Blu-ray titled \"Awesome as Fuck\" was released on March 22, 2011.\n2011\u20132014: \"\u00a1Uno! \u00a1Dos! \u00a1Tr\u00e9!\".\nDuring the end of 2011, the band played several secret shows (under the name Foxboro Hot Tubs) whose setlists consisted almost entirely of previously unheard songs. Green Day entered the studio and began recording new material in February 2012, later announcing a trilogy of albums titled \"\u00a1Uno!\", \"\u00a1Dos!\", and \"\u00a1Tr\u00e9!\" which would be released in fall 2012. The trilogy featured longtime touring guitarist Jason White joining the band in the studio as an additional musician. This marks the first time that White had played guitar on a Green Day album. That summer, Green Day played several festivals and promotional shows, including the Rock en Seine festival in France, the Rock am See festival in Germany, and the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom.\n\"\u00a1Uno!\", \"\u00a1Dos!\", and \"\u00a1Tr\u00e9!\" were released on September 21, November 9, and December 7, 2012, respectively, and were met with generally positive reviews from critics, though fans were more lukewarm towards the albums. On January 22, 2013, the band announced that \"\u00a1Cuatro!\", a documentary about the making of \"\u00a1Uno!, \u00a1Dos!\" and \"\u00a1Tr\u00e9!\", would premiere on January 26 in Aspen, Colorado as part of the X Games FILM showcase, and would be released on DVD April 9, 2013. Another documentary was announced called \"Broadway Idiot\" which focuses on the creation on the American Idiot musical and Armstrong's run as playing the character of St. Jimmy. On March 10, 2013, Green Day began its 99 Revolutions Tour to support the trilogy. In June, Green Day broke Emirates Stadium attendance record with 60,000 tickets sold. The band played \"Dookie\" from start to finish on several dates on the tour's European leg, including during the Reading Festival 2013 headline show.\n\"Demolicious\", a compilation album that contains alternate versions and demos of songs from \"\u00a1Uno!\", \"\u00a1Dos!\" and \"\u00a1Tr\u00e9!\" recorded during the studio sessions of these albums, was released on April 19, 2014, for Record Store Day. It also contains a previously unreleased song called \"State of Shock\" and an acoustic version of \"Stay the Night\", from \"\u00a1Uno!\".\n2014\u20132018: Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and \"Revolution Radio\".\nGreen Day performed their first concert in a year on April 16, 2015. The group first played a set as Sweet Children with John Kiffmeyer, followed by a set as Green Day. On April 18, 2015, Green Day were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by Fall Out Boy.\nOn April 24, 2015, Rob Cavallo revealed Green Day were recording a twelfth studio album. Cavallo claimed to have heard \"five new songs that Billie has written and demoed\", and that the fans should be \"sure that when they do return, the music will be amazing\". On December 24, 2015, Green Day released a Christmas song, \"Xmas Time of the Year\".\nOn August 11, 2016, Green Day released the first single, \"Bang Bang\", from the group's twelfth studio album, \"Revolution Radio\", which was released on October 7, 2016. The band went on a world tour supporting the album. In November 2016, the band performed at the American Music Awards in Los Angeles and made a political statement about the then-recent US election of Donald Trump by chanting \"No Trump, No KKK, No Fascist USA\" during their rendition of \"Bang Bang\".\nAaron Burgess at \"Alternative Press\" observed, \"It's the first time in years Green Day haven't had all the answers. But as a statement on how it feels to fight, it's the closest to the truth they've ever gotten.\" Gwilym Mumford of \"The Guardian\" stated \"[after their last few albums] the band have decided to get back to basics: \"Revolution Radio\" is their most focused work in years. Lead single \"Bang Bang\" sets the tone, with a caustic consideration of the fame-hungry psychosis of a mass shooter\".\nThe band released their second greatest hits compilation, \"God's Favorite Band\", on November 17, 2017. It contains 20 of their hits, along with two new tracks: a different version of the \"Revolution Radio\" track \"Ordinary World\", featuring country singer Miranda Lambert, and a previously unreleased song titled \"Back in the USA\".\n2019\u20132023: \"Father of All Motherfuckers\".\nOn April 13, 2019, for Record Store Day, the band released their Woodstock 1994 performance on vinyl for the first time. It contains all 9 songs they played live, as well as audio of the ensuing mud fight. On September 10, 2019, the band announced the Hella Mega Tour with Fall Out Boy and Weezer as headliners alongside themselves, with the Interrupters as the opening act. They also released the single, \"Father of All...\" off their thirteenth album, \"Father of All Motherfuckers\". The same day, in an interview with KROQ, Armstrong announced the band would be parting ways with Reprise after the album's release, as they were off their contract with Warner. On September 30, 2019, Green Day signed a two-year agreement with the National Hockey League (NHL). The album's second single, \"Fire, Ready, Aim\", was released on October 9, 2019. The album's third single, \"Oh Yeah!\", was released on January 16, 2020. The album was released on February 7, 2020. The album's fourth single, \"Meet Me on the Roof\", was released on the same day as the album.\nOn April 6, 2020, Armstrong revealed that he had written six songs intending to record new music with the band once the COVID-19 pandemic had passed. On May 21, 2020, the band released a cover of Blondie's \"Dreaming\".\nOn October 30, 2020, the band's secret side project, the Network, teased upcoming activity with a video titled \"The Prophecy\" and mentioned their upcoming sequel album. Then on November 2, 2020, the Network released a music video for their first song in 17 years, named \"Ivankkka Is a Nazi\". After a couple of weeks of small hints on social media, as well as Green Day claiming they were not the Network, the band released an EP on November 20, 2020, titled \"Trans Am\". On December 4, 2020, the Network released their second album, \"\".\nIn February 2021, Green Day announced a single, titled \"Here Comes the Shock\", which was later released on February 21, 2021. The band would release a remastered version of \"Insomniac\" in March for the belated 25th anniversary of the album's release, with bonus live tracks. On May 17, 2021, Green Day released the single \"Pollyanna\".

This song was also in the soundtrack of the 2021 film \"Mark, Mary &amp; Some Other People\".\n\"BBC Sessions\", the fourth live album by Green Day, was released on December 10, 2021. Eight days later, they put out a teaser video with the captions \"RAK Studios. London, England. Green Day. 1972\".\nIn 2022, Green Day played a handful of major festivals in the United States, including Lollapalooza, and Outside Lands. The band also played a surprise Lollapalooza aftershow set at Metro Chicago on July 29, a set that was mostly improvised. The set included their first performances of \"Church on Sunday\", and \"Warning\" since 2001, and also included fan favorite deep tracks \"Whatsername\", \"Letterbomb\", and \"Murder City\". On October 26, 2022, Green Day was announced as a headliner for the fifth annual Innings Festival in Arizona.\n2023\u2013present: \"Saviors\".\nIn November 2022, the band stated they were recording for a new studio album. The album was produced by Rob Cavallo, marking his first album working with the band since \"\u00a1Tr\u00e9!\" (2012). Prior to the album's release, the band played a new song titled \"1981\" during their live performance at Festival d'\u00e9t\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec on July 16, 2023. On September 30, 2023, Green Day was announced as the halftime show at the 110th Grey Cup. The following day, the band launched a new website with the name \"The American Dream Is Killing Me\". Included on the website was a video appearing to tease new music, and a circled date of October 24, 2023, leading some news outlets to believe that it is related to their next album. Before the album's release, they played the first song, \"The American Dream Is Killing Me\", during a live show in Las Vegas, Nevada, on October 19, 2023, and announced the Saviors Tour, which first North American leg was joined by the Smashing Pumpkins, Rancid, and the Linda Lindas. They played another song, titled \"Look Ma, No Brains!\", from the upcoming album during the When We Were Young Festival on October 22, 2023.\nOn October 24, 2023, the title of the new album was announced as \"Saviors\", and the album's first single, \"The American Dream Is Killing Me\", was released. The album was released on January 19, 2024. The second single, \"Look Ma, No Brains!\", was released on November 2, 2023. A third single, \"Dilemma\", was announced on December 4, 2023, and released three days later on December 7, 2023. On New Year's Eve, Green Day performed \"American Idiot\" on the television special \"Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve\". Armstrong replaced the line \"I'm not a part of a redneck agenda\" with \"I'm not a part of the MAGA agenda\", a reference to Donald Trump's Make America Great Again slogan, in criticism of Trump. The album's fourth single, \"One Eyed Bastard\", was released on January 5, 2024. On the evening of January 16, 2024, the band appeared in a surprise performance in the 47th\u201350th Streets\u2013Rockefeller Center station of the New York subway system, with late-night host Jimmy Fallon joining them on tambourine to help draw attention to the upcoming album and tour, and played several songs, including the recent single \"Look Ma, No Brains\", \"Basket Case\", and \"American Idiot\"; this time, Armstrong left space to let the subway crowd sing out the song's revised line \"I'm not a part of the MAGA agenda.\" The album, and a music video for \"Bobby Sox\", were both released simultaneously on January 19, 2024. A music video for \"Corvette Summer\" was released on July 23, 2024.\nGreen Day opened for the FireAid benefit concert on January 30, 2025; it was hosted by both Intuit Dome, and the Kia Forum. The band opened with a duet of \"Last Night on Earth\" with Billie Eilish, followed by \"Still Breathing\", and \"When I Come Around\".\nOn April 9, 2025, Green Day announced the deluxe edition of \"Saviors\", titled in French \"Saviors (\u00c9dition De Luxe)\", with \"Smash It Like Belushi\" released as the first single. The same month, the band performed as headliners in the year's Coachella Festival. \"Ballyhoo\" was released as the second single of \"Saviors\" deluxe on May 2, 2025. The deluxe edition, and an official music video for \"One Eyed Bastard\", were both released on May 23, 2025.\nArtistry.\nMusical style and influences.\nGreen Day's sound is described as \"often hard-driving and aggressive\", and is often compared to first wave American and British punk rock bands such as the Ramones, Sex Pistols, the Clash, the Dickies, and Buzzcocks. The band is primarily known for its heavy use of power chords combined with \"strong pop melodic sensibility\". Several publications have characterized the band as punk rock, pop-punk, skate punk, melodic punk, alternative rock, and more controversially, power pop. The band has casually explored other musical styles, including post-punk and pop-rock with \"21st Century Breakdown\", and garage rock on \"\u00a1Dos!\" and \"Father of All..\". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described Green Day as \"punk revivalists who recharged the energy of speedy, catchy three-chord punk-pop songs.\" Among the labels of the band by critics, members Billie Joe Armstrong and Tr\u00e9 Cool have stated in interviews with \"Livewire\" and \"Kerrang!\" self-describing Green Day as just a punk rock band.\nBillie Joe Armstrong has mentioned that some of his biggest influences are seminal hardcore punk bands H\u00fcsker D\u00fc and the Replacements, and that their influence is particularly noted in the band's chord changes in songs. Green Day has covered H\u00fcsker D\u00fc's \"Don't Want to Know If You Are Lonely\" as a B-side to the \"Warning\" single, and the character \"Mr. Whirly\" in the group's song \"Misery\" is a reference to the Replacements song of the same name. Southern California-based hardcore bands Social Distortion and Bad Religion have also been cited as influences. Green Day would cover the former's song \"Another State of Mind\" from their 1983 debut release, \"Mommy's Little Monster\" as a bonus track for \"21st Century Breakdown\".\nOutside of their punk influences, Green Day have also cited hard rock bands the Kinks, the Who, and Cheap Trick. In August 1996, Billie Joe Armstrong told \"Guitar World\" he \"can remember a few different instances\" of when he first discovered punk rock: \"There were these two guys who introduced me to things like D.O.A. and the Dead Kennedys. Then, in the seventh grade, there was a girl at school who would bring in records like T.S.O.L. and say, 'Here, listen to this.'\" Armstrong said he thinks he \"really started getting into\" punk rock \"in 1987 with \"Turn It Around!\", a double seven-inch compilation record put out by [punk fanzine] \"Maximumrocknroll\".\" Armstrong cited \"Turn It Around!\" as an influence, calling it \"a pretty big record\" for him. Armstrong would also cite fellow East Bay punk bands Operation Ivy, Jawbreaker, and Crimpshrine as influences. Tr\u00e9 Cool has stated that the band is influenced by music that they did not like, naming artists like Hall &amp; Oates, Cyndi Lauper and other 1980s music.\nAlthough Green Day has been compared to Buzzcocks, the Ramones and the Clash, Mike Dirnt said he had never heard Buzzcocks when Green Day began. Dirnt said: \"First off, you can't sound like any of those bands. And secondly, those are probably the last ones in my record collection.\" Armstrong responded to Dirnt, saying: \"Mine too. Those are all bands I got into later.\" The Dickies is another band Green Day has been compared to. Dirnt said he \"never owned a Dickies album, although\" he \"did see\" the Dickies live \"around the time of\" \"Kerplunk!\". Dirnt said \"by that time, we'd played so many shows it had no bearing.\" Armstrong referred to the Dickies as \"just another Ramones rip-off\". Although in August 1996, Armstrong said bands like the Ramones are bands he listened to later, in June 2010, Armstrong cited the Ramones as an influence. He also said his \"range of favorite songwriters goes anywhere from the Sex Pistols to Lennon\u2013McCartney\". During the \"American Idiot\" and \"21st Century Breakdown\" era of Green Day, the band was influenced by the Who, U2, Motown albums, and musicals such as \"Grease\".\nLyrical themes.\nGreen Day's lyrics explore themes including adolescence, substance abuse, heartbreak, political sociology and anti-authoritarianism. While Armstrong is the band's primary songwriter, he looks to the other band members for organizational help. The band's lyrics frequently incorporate profanity. In 2016, a study of 361 musical artists conducted by Italian music data company Musixmatch found that Green Day used profanity the most among the rock music artists included in the study, beating out Red Hot Chili Peppers and Aerosmith. The study suggested that across a selection of 136 tracks from the band's catalogue, the swear words most frequently uttered were \"fuck\", \"fucking\", and \"shit\", respectively.\nLive performances.\nBillie Joe Armstrong regularly invites musicians at Green Day concerts onstage to substitute for the band members on guitar, bass and drums, often letting the guest musicians keep the instruments they used during their guest spots. Armstrong is quoted saying: \"I remember being a kid and seeing Van Halen play. I was, like, 12, and Eddie would come out, and I'd go, 'God, it would be so cool to be up there and do what he's doing. So I was always keeping that in mind, subconsciously that's basically what ended up happening, breaking down the barrier between the band and the audience.\"\nIn 2016, Armstrong began altering lyrics during live performances to criticize members of the Trump Administration. He later did this to JD Vance and Elon Musk. Other live lyrical alterations include references to the Israel-Gaza War, which voiced support for Palestine.\nLegacy.\nCritical recognition and influence.\nGreen Day is credited (alongside Bad Religion, the Offspring, NOFX, Social Distortion, and Rancid) with popularizing mainstream interest in punk rock in the United States, particularly with the album \"Dookie\", which was cited by Fuse as the most important pop-punk album of all time, the best alternative album of 1994 by \"Rolling Stone\", and as one of the best punk rock albums of all time by \"Rolling Stone\", \"Kerrang!\", \"Revolver\", and \"LA Weekly\". Diffuser.fm listed \"Dookie\" as the greatest album of the 90s. It was also placed on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's \"Definitive 200\" list of 200 classic albums. Both \"Dookie\" and \"American Idiot\" appeared on \"Rolling Stone\"'s list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. \"Kerplunk\" was also listed in a 2007 ranking of the 100 greatest indie albums by Blender. In 2011, they were voted the best punk rock band of all time by \"Rolling Stone\". \nThe band has been cited as an influence by a variety of artists, including Alkaline Trio, Avril Lavigne, AFI, Fall Out Boy, Blink-182, Joyce Manor, Lady Gaga, Wavves, Fidlar, Tegan and Sara, the Menzingers, New Found Glory, Prince Daddy &amp; the Hyena, Bowling for Soup, Billie Eilish, and Sum 41.\nAwards and achievements.\nGreen Day has sold roughly 75 million records worldwide as of 2024, making them one of the highest-selling artists of all time. \"Kerplunk\" is one of the bestselling independent albums of all time, selling over 4.5 million copies worldwide. The group has been nominated for 20 Grammy awards and has won five of them with Best Alternative Album for \"Dookie\", Best Rock Album for \"American Idiot\" and \"21st Century Breakdown\", Record of the Year for \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\", and Best Musical Show Album for \"\". \nIn 2010, a stage adaptation of \"American Idiot\" debuted on Broadway. The musical was nominated for three Tony Awards. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in April 2015, their first year of eligibility. They received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on May 1, 2025. \nRelated projects.\nSince 1991, members of the band have branched out past Green Day, starting other projects with various musicians. Notable projects related to Green Day include Billie Joe Armstrong's Pinhead Gunpowder with Jason White and the Longshot with Jeff Matika, the Frustrators with Mike Dirnt, and the Network, a collaboration between Green Day and friends in which all members play under fake stage names. Green Day has also released an album titled \"Stop Drop and Roll!!!\" on May 20, 2008, under the name Foxboro Hot Tubs, which the band uses to book secret shows. In late December 2011, Armstrong formed a family band called the Boo which recorded a one-off Christmas record for their friends and family making a few copies available in a local store. Since January 2018, Armstrong, Dirnt and White have played in the band the Coverups along with Green Day audio engineer Chris Dugan and tour manager Bill Schneider. The band sporadically performs one-off shows, usually in small clubs, and cover the songs of classic rock and alternative rock bands such as Cheap Trick, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, the Clash, and Nirvana.\nIn September 2006, Green Day collaborated with U2 and producer Rick Rubin to record a cover of the song \"The Saints Are Coming\", originally recorded by the Skids, with an accompanying video. The song was recorded to benefit Music Rising, an organization to help raise money for musicians' instruments lost during Hurricane Katrina, and to bring awareness on the eve of the one-year anniversary of the disaster. In December 2006, Green Day and NRDC opened a web site in partnership to raise awareness on America's dependency on oil.\nGreen Day released a cover of the John Lennon song \"Working Class Hero\", which was featured on the album \"\". The band performed the song on the season finale of \"American Idol\". The song was nominated for a Grammy Award in 2008 but lost to the White Stripes' \"Icky Thump\". That summer, the band appeared in a cameo role in \"The Simpsons Movie\", where the band performed a rock version of the show's theme song. Their version of it was released as a single on July 23, 2007.\nIn 2009, the band collaborated with theater director Michael Mayer to adapt the group's rock opera \"American Idiot\" into a one-act stage musical that premiered at the Berkeley Rep on September 15, 2009. The show then moved to Broadway on April 20, 2010. The reviews of \"American Idiot: The Musical\" have been positive to mixed. Charles Isherwood of \"The New York Times\" wrote an enthusiastic review for the Broadway production. He called the show \"a pulsating portrait of wasted youth that invokes all the standard genre conventions ... only to transcend them through the power of its music and the artistry of its execution, the show is as invigorating and ultimately as moving as anything I've seen on Broadway this season. Or maybe for a few seasons past.\" Jed Gottlieb of the \"Boston Herald\" enjoyed the premise of the show but found that \"the music and message suffer in a setting where the audience is politely, soberly seated\".\nMichael Kuchiwara of the Associated Press found the show to be \"visually striking [and] musically adventurous\", but noted that \"the show has the barest wisp of a story and minimal character development\". Paul Kolnik in \"USA Today\" enjoyed the contradiction that Green Day's \"massively popular, starkly disenchanted album ... would be the feel-good musical of the season\". \"Time\" magazine's Richard Zoglin opined that the score \"is as pure a specimen of contemporary punk rock as Broadway has yet encountered, [yet] there's enough variety. ... Where the show falls short is as a fully developed narrative.\" He concluded that \"\"American Idiot\", despite its earnest huffing and puffing, remains little more than an annotated rock concert. ... Still, [it] deserves at least two cheers\u2014for its irresistible musical energy and for opening fresh vistas for that odd couple, rock and Broadway.\" Peter Travers from \"Rolling Stone\", in his review of \"American Idiot\", wrote \"Though \"American Idiot\" carries echoes of such rock musicals as \"Tommy\", \"Hair\", \"Rent\" and \"Spring Awakening\", it cuts its own path to the heart. You won't know what hit you. \"American Idiot\" knows no limits\u2014it's a global knockout.\" The musical has been nominated for three Tony Awards, including Best Musical and Best Scenic Design. It was also nominated for several Drama Desk Awards and Outer Critics Circle Awards.\nIn October 2009, a Green Day art project was exhibited at StolenSpace Gallery in London. The exhibition showed artworks created for each of the songs on \"21st Century Breakdown\", was supported by the band, and led by the group's manager Pat Magnarella. He explained in an interview that \"[Artists are] basically like rock bands. Most are creating their art, but don't know how to promote it.\" For Billie Joe Armstrong, \"Many of the artists... show their work on the street, and we feel a strong connection to that type of creative expression.\"\nOn April 13, 2011, a film version of \"American Idiot\" was confirmed. Michael Mayer, director of the Broadway musical, would have directed the film. It will be produced by Green Day, Pat Magnarella (Green Day's manager who also produced \"Bullet in a Bible\", \"Awesome as Fuck\", and \"Heart Like a Hand Grenade\"), Playtone (Tom Hanks and Gary Goetzman) and Tom Hulce. However, in February 2020, Billie Joe Armstrong revealed to \"NME\" that plans for a film adaptation of the stage musical had been \"pretty much scrapped\", without providing anymore details as to the reason.\nOn January 23, 2013, it was announced that a documentary showing Armstrong's journey from punk rock to Broadway was to be released. Called \"Broadway Idiot\" and showing a lot of behind-the-scenes of the \"American Idiot\" musical production, the movie was directed by Doug Hamilton, veteran television journalist for CBS News' \"60 Minutes\" and PBS documentaries such as \"Nova\", \"Frontline\" and \"American Masters\". A trailer was released on January 30, 2013. The documentary premiered at the South by Southwest Film Festival on March 15, 2013.\nGreen Day served as executive producers of \"\" (2017), an extensive documentary film about the San Francisco Bay area punk scene from the late 1970s to the 1990s.\n\"New Years Rev\".\nOn February 10, 2025, Live Nation Productions announced a comedy film titled \"New Years Rev\", which was described as a \"coming-of-age tale\", inspired by the true exploits of the band prior to their mainstream breakthrough in 1994. Production of the film was said to be underway in the US state of Oklahoma. Lee Kirk was announced as the film's writer and director. Live Nation Productions, the film and TV arm of Live Nation Entertainment, was said to be producing the film. Green Day guitarist and vocalist Billie Joe Armstrong, bassist Mike Dirnt, and drummer Tr\u00e9 Cool were announced as the film's producers, in collaboration with Tim Perell. The band members were also confirmed to be making an appearance in the film themselves. Ryan Kroft, Michael Rapino, Jonathan Daniel were announced as the film's executive producers. Mason Thames, Kylr Coffman and Ryan Foust were announced as the film's stars. Jenna Fischer, who portrayed the character Pam Beesley in the American sitcom \"The Office\", was confirmed to have a role in the film. Angela Kinsey, who acted in the same series, was also confirmed to have a role in the film. The film's logline read, \"Their roadtrip is a rowdy and mischievous jaunt across the country filled with adventures, based on the exploits of Green Day and their years of living in a tour van.\" According to Ryan Kroft of Live Nation Productions, the film \"[tells] the story of three friends as they travel across the United States after mistakenly thinking they'll be opening for a Green Day New Years concert in Los Angeles.\" Billie Joe Armstrong said, \"Van days rule. You will drive all night on no sleep then play a show for 10 kids in a basement of a friend of a friend's house 50 miles east of anywhere you've ever heard of. But you'll do it again the next day, and the one after that. Because you're doing it with your bandmates who become your family and it's unlike anything you've ever known. It's electric. Let the music and mischief ensue.\" Lee Kirk had previously worked with Billie Joe Armstrong on the 2016 \"Ordinary World\", which the latter had made an appearance in. Kirk had also previously directed an episode of \"The Office\", and is also the spouse of Jenna Fischer.\nThe film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 12, 2025. \nControversies.\nMusical style and classification.\nGreen Day has generated controversy over whether their musical style and major-label status constitutes \"true punk\". In reaction to both the style of music and the background of the band, John Lydon, former frontman of the 1970s punk band the Sex Pistols commented, \"So there we are fending off all that and it pisses me off that years later a wank outfit like Green Day hop in and nick all that and attach it to themselves. They didn't earn their wings to do that and if they were true punk they wouldn't look anything like they do.\" However, others in the punk rock scene would come to the defense of the band on their punk status. Bad Religion lead guitarist Brett Gurewitz and founder of the independent punk label Epitaph Records would state, \"They [Green Day] are a punk band, but you know, punk is the legacy of rock and roll, and Green Day are the biggest band in the genre.\"\nArmstrong has discussed the group's status of being a punk band on a major record label, saying, \"Sometimes I think we've become redundant because we're this big band now; we've made a lot of money\u2014we're not punk rock anymore. But then I think about it and just say, 'You can take us out of a punk rock environment, but you can't take the punk rock out of us.'\" In 2021, Armstrong condemned the band's labeling as \"pop-punk\" by critics in a Vulture magazine interview, stating, \"I never really liked that term (pop punk), it turned into sort of a genre. I never thought of myself as a pop artist. I've always been left of center. To say you're a pop-punker ... it never sat well with me.\" Armstrong acknowledged the band's more melodic punk style compared to other bands from the Bay Area scene it emerged from, but also brought up the band's performance alongside East Bay hardcore bands like Neurosis, Engage, Spitboy, Blatz, and Filth.\nIn 2006, English rock musician Noel Gallagher of the Britpop band Oasis complained about the band semi-jokingly, claiming that the band had ripped off his song \"Wonderwall\" with \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\".\n2012 iHeartRadio Festival incident.\nOn September 21, 2012, while Green Day was performing at the iHeartRadio music festival, Armstrong stopped while performing \"Basket Case\", because he believed the group's time was being shortened, possibly to extend R&amp;B artist Usher's performance. Angered, Armstrong began ranting while a screen in the rear of the audience was labeled \"1 Minutes [Left]\", saying \"You're gonna give me one fucking minute? You've gotta be fucking kidding me!\" He also told the crowd he \"was not Justin Bieber\" and labeled the festival as a \"joke\". When the screen went blank, Armstrong smashed his guitar, while bassist Mike Dirnt smashed his bass. Armstrong then gave the finger, and declared that Green Day would be back before throwing his microphone down and walking off the stage. Two days later, the band's representative apologized for the incident on the group's behalf stating that \"Green Day would like everyone to know that their set was not cut short by Clear Channel and to apologize to those they offended at the iHeartRadio Festival in Las Vegas\", also adding that Armstrong would be headed to rehab, for abuse of alcohol and prescription pills. However, Dirnt would later say in an interview with \"Rolling Stone\" that he agreed with what Armstrong meant by his rant. The band later made amends with the company and played an album release party for their 2016 release, \"Revolution Radio\". They also returned to the festival in 2019 supporting the album \"Father of All Motherfuckers\".\nMad Cool incident.\nOn July 7, 2017, about 20 minutes before Green Day headlined Mad Cool, a festival in Madrid, an acrobat fell about from a cage above the stage and died. Some fans were upset at the band and festival organizers for continuing the show, which was attended by about 35,000 people. On their website, Armstrong said the band did not know about the accident before their set, and likely would not have played if they had.\nOracle Park incident.\nOn September 20, 2024, Green Day performed a show in San Francisco at Oracle Park. During the concert, Billie Joe Armstrong expressed his anger over the Athletics leaving Oakland, repeatedly cursing Las Vegas and called it \"the worst shithole in America\". He also criticized A's owner John Fisher, saying \"We don't take shit from people like fucking John Fisher\u2026 I hate Las Vegas.\" In protest of Armstrong's comments, two Las Vegas radio stations (KOMP 92.3 and X107.5) banned all Green Day music from their playlists.\nElon Musk incidents.\nIn January 2025, while on tour in South Africa, Green Day once again adapted the lyrics of their breakout hit \"American Idiot\" to criticize Elon Musk. At their Calabash Festival headliner performance at Johannesburg's FNB Stadium on 19 January, lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong altered the line \"I'm not a part of a redneck agenda\" to \"I'm not a part of the Elon agenda.\"\nMusk, who had previously mocked Green Day on X (formerly Twitter) in early 2024, calling their commentary \"milquetoastedly raging for it\", had branded the band as hypocritical in their anti\u2011\"machine\" rhetoric. In response, bassist Mike Dirnt told \"Rolling Stone\": \"Elon Musk actually is the machine... He's not shy about saying stupid shit on the internet... The song's twenty years old, and we're Green Day. What did you expect?\"\nBand members.\nCurrent\nCurrent touring\nFormer\nFormer touring\nDiscography.\nStudio albums\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nTours.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "52727", "revid": "16490402", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52727", "title": "Radiant Silvergun", "text": "1998 shooter video game\n is a shoot 'em up video game developed and published by Treasure. It was originally released in Japanese arcades in 1998 and subsequently ported to the Sega Saturn later that year. The story follows a team of fighter pilots in the far future who are battling waves of enemies summoned by a mysterious crystal dug up from the Earth. The player hosts an arsenal of six different types of shots to choose from, and a sword to destroy nearby targets. The stages are tightly designed to present players with scenarios that can be approached differently with the various weapon types.\nTreasure was primarily known for developing action and platform games for home consoles before \"Radiant Silvergun\". Despite the company's concerns about the financial viability of arcade games and the shooter genre, they felt they had a good premise for a game and decided to pursue it. \"Radiant Silvergun\" was developed by ten people, with Gonzo outsourced for animated cutscenes. The game was developed for the ST-V arcade board first and later ported to the architecturally similar Sega Saturn. Towards the end of development, the team recruited professional gamers that held high scores in shooters to play test the game.\n\"Radiant Silvergun\" was first released in Japanese arcades in May 1998. Treasure president Masato Maegawa went in person to arcades to gauge the reaction of players. The Saturn port was released two months later in Japan. Despite its region exclusivity, \"Radiant Silvergun\" was imported by Western critics and received critical acclaim. Journalists agreed that the game revived the shoot 'em up genre, which had fallen by the wayside after the rise in popularity of arcade fighting games in the 1990s. In retrospect, it is considered one of the greatest shooters and Sega Saturn games of all time. It received a spiritual sequel in the form of \"Ikaruga\" (2001), and was ported worldwide to the Xbox 360 in 2011, to the Nintendo Switch in 2022 and to Windows in 2023.\nGameplay.\n\"Radiant Silvergun\" is a vertically scrolling shoot 'em up. The player is given a wide arsenal from the start of the game featuring three primary weapons: strong forward laser, weak homing projectiles, and a spread gun which fires pairs of exploding projectiles at a wide angle. Combining any of these weapons with another will result in one of three new types of attack: a rear firing laser (laser + spread), an auto-targeting plasma beam (laser + homing), and a close range missile targeting system (homing + spread). Using all 3 weapons together activates a sword that can be swung around the ship to damage nearby enemies and defensively absorb a common type of enemy projectile. Absorbing enemy fire charges up the sword for a screen-clearing special attack. The stages are methodically and tightly paced with carefully crafted scenarios that can be approached differently with the varying weapons.\nThe game's scoring system is based on enemy color. All enemies are one of three colors: red, blue, or yellow. Destroying three enemies of the same color in a row starts a bonus scoring chain. Destroying another set of the same color continues the chain and increases the bonus, while shooting another color resets it. Unlike Ikaruga, switching colors between sets breaks the chain. In addition to gaining a higher score, chains contribute to leveling up the weapon being used, increasing its effectiveness. The weapons stay powered up for the remainder of the game. The player can also obtain extra points by destroying bosses more methodically. Each boss has different segments and appendages that can be destroyed before targeting their weak spot. If all these segments are destroyed first, the player will earn a greater bonus. There are also hidden dogs that when shot, will give the player bonus points and unlock more game options.\nPlot.\nThe story of \"Radiant Silvergun\" is told non-linearly through animated videos and scripted dialogue between stages. In the year 2520, scientists on Earth have unearthed a giant crystal along with an ancient robot bearing the same serial number as another robot called \"Creator\" on the Tetra spaceship orbiting around Earth. The crystal creates a massive explosion, engulfing the Earth and killing all humans except for the remaining four on the spaceship. One year later, exhausted of supplies, they return to Earth in fighter jets known as Silverguns, fighting through hordes of enemies until they reach the crystal, which is referred to as \u201cthe Stone-Like\u201d. After battling the Stone-Like and failing to destroy it, it brings the last two remaining pilots 100,000 years into the past, and tells them that it is the guardian of the Earth and destroyed humans in order to protect the planet, before destroying the last two humans in another explosion. 20 years later, still in the distant past, the Creator uses DNA from the pilots of the Silverguns to create clones and start humanity anew before the Creator finally breaks down for good, bringing the story into a loop.\nDevelopment.\nBackground.\nSince the company's inception, Treasure had primarily been a developer of action and platform games for home consoles. Sega had repeatedly asked the company to develop an arcade game for them, but Treasure president Masato Maegawa was concerned the shrinking arcade business would be too risky from a business perspective and arcade goers would not appreciate the effort placed into their game. Despite this concern the team had wanted to develop a 2D arcade style shoot 'em up for some time. Much of the staff were fans of the genre, having grown up during the genre's golden age, but entering their careers after fighting games started filling arcades. Director Hiroshi Iuchi was especially passionate about starting the project. Although the team was eager to develop the game, there were still concerns. Maegawa believed that the shoot 'em up genre was dying, and was risky from a sales perspective. Iuchi was also concerned there would be no place for a 2D shooter in an arcade space that was advancing more towards large and specialized 3D game machines. In the face of these concerns about commercial viability, the team felt they had a good concept and pushed forth.\nIuchi thought arcade developers of the era were not innovating enough and only settling for rehashes of old ideas. He thought shooting games at the time were most commonly in the style of Toaplan-developed vertical shooters, but he remembered in the past when developers like Konami and Irem had distinct shooter styles. In response to this, Iuchi's first thought was to develop a non-Toaplan style shooter. He claimed to have the idea for \"Radiant Silvergun\" long before it was released, not pulling any influence from games of the era. The key philosophies he carried was to make a classic style game, but make it unlike anything else. He was a big fan of Irem's \"Image Fight\" (1988), and believes that some of that inspiration is reflected in \"Radiant Silvergun\".\nThe Treasure team wanted to develop the game for home console in addition to arcades. They agreed the game had to be released in arcades first, as a console exclusive shooter may be a hard sell. They hoped the game would appeal to shooting fans in the arcades while also convincing home console players that shooters were still fun. Maegawa thought it would be best to keep the arcade and console portions of the development cycle separate, because arcades and consoles are so different. Iuchi treated the arcade version as the \"test version\" with the console version released soon after that. He believed that if the team was not successful with the console port, the 2D shoot 'em up genre would soon die.\nProduction.\nDevelopment on \"Radiant Silvergun\" started in late 1997, and progressed smoothly as opposed to past projects where they had to scrap ideas and restart from scratch. The title is in reference to an early concept that had people flying through the sky holding silver guns in each hand. Some of the staff thought the name was difficult to remember, but Iuchi believed that if it was hard to remember, it was hard to forget. Only ten people worked on the game, including three programmers, four artists, and one sound designer. They chose to develop for the Sega ST-V arcade board because Treasure had normally developed games for Sega and it was similar to the Sega Saturn home console, which they were planning on porting the game to. The team had knowledge of the Sega Saturn's hardware from developing previous games for it, so they believed it would be easier this time around. They did not use any expensive hardware, just conventional computers. They used LightWave for the 3D objects and freeware downloaded from the internet to make the 2D graphics. The programmers and designers worked hard to use every bit of power from Sega's hardware.\nIuchi did not include power-ups in \"Radiant Silvergun\" because he felt they were distracting, and he often found himself dying when trying to manage different weapons and items. To combat this, he made the game progress simply through shooting and dodging, and mapped weapons to individual buttons and button combinations instead of needing to press a button to cycle through weapons. The team also made the bullets deliberately slow to appeal to a wider playing audience. The team recruited animation studio Gonzo to create movie sequences with deeper story elements for the Saturn version. These sequences were not included in the arcade version because players there do not want to wait through story sequences. Gonzo had previously done animation for Treasure's \"Silhouette Mirage\" (1997) and Iuchi was happy with the outcome of their work on \"Radiant Silvergun\". The game's music was composed by Hitoshi Sakimoto.\nTowards the end of development, Maegawa could not finish the game to properly debug it because it was too difficult. He brought in skilled players who held national records at shooters to debug the game.\nRelease.\n\"Radiant Silvergun\" was released in Japanese arcades on May 28, 1998. The team was anxious about whether it was going to be received well in arcades since it was such a unique shooter and their first arcade game, so Maegawa went in person to arcades to gauge the player reaction. He later said they observed people playing the game for a very long time, which made them happy. The game was released at retail for the Sega Saturn on July 23, 1998, and sold around 50,000 copies.\nReception.\nIn July 1998, \"Game Machine\" listed the game as being the fifth most popular arcade game in Japan at the time.\nThe Sega Saturn port of \"Radiant Silvergun\" received critical acclaim, with some calling it one of the best shoot 'em ups ever made. Critics agreed that Treasure successfully revived and redefined the shooter genre following a period of stagnation in the wake of the advent of fighting games during the 16-bit era.\nSeveral journalists commented on the game's visuals. \"Edge\" wrote the game was \"arguably the finest technical showcase the Saturn has ever played host to.\" They praised the parallax backdrops, Mode 7 style distortion effects, and use of 3D polygons to create imaginative bosses. They felt the game was a successful attempt to push the Sega Saturn's graphical capabilities to its limits, calling it \"a wonder to behold.\" \"Sega Saturn Magazine\" also thought the game had some of the most impressive Sega Saturn graphics, and highlighted the great mix of 2D and 3D graphics. \"Computer and Video Games\" thought the game outclassed graphics capable on the PlayStation or Nintendo 64. \"Arcade\" called it a \"gorgeous\" and \"sense-pummeling\" shooter with spectacular explosions and visual effects.\nCritics also praised \"Radiant Silvergun\"'s gameplay, and most commonly highlighted its replayability thanks to the depth of its scoring system and hidden bonuses. \"Arcade\" called it \"the kind of repeat play magnetism that makes you wonder why 2D shoot 'em ups fell from grace in the first place.\" \"Sega Saturn Magazine\" argued that there are role-playing games with less depth than \"Radiant Silvergun\". \"Edge\" claimed that Treasure's commitment to \"old school\" gaming principles paid off, and praised the game's hardcore appeal. Both \"Edge\" and \"Sega Saturn Magazine\" shared positive thoughts on the game's weapon systems, and also agreed that it was satisfyingly difficult, although \"Edge\" complained that sometimes it sacrificed fairness for visual flair. \"GameSpot\" concluded their thoughts saying: \"This game is an absolute must-buy. Never has a shooter combined relentless, thoughtfully-designed action with such stunning graphics and sound...\"Radiant Silvergun\" makes you feel as if you've never really played a shooter before. It's a whole new experience.\"\nLegacy.\nIn retrospective reviews, \"Radiant Silvergun\" is considered one of the greatest shooters of all time, and one of the best Sega Saturn games. \"IGN\" called \"Radiant Silvergun\" a \"milestone in shooter design\" and in 2008 listed it as their number one classic shoot 'em up. In 2005, \"IGN\" also compiled all their reader's review ratings of the 31,000 games in their database, among which \"Radiant Silvergun\" reached the twelfth spot. Because of the game's limited availability, it soon became an expensive and sought after collector's item, selling for at least US$ by 2011.\nThe game received a spiritual successor in the form of \"Ikaruga\" (2001), which was originally subtitled \"Radiant Silvergun 2\". It was first released on the Sega NAOMI arcade platform until later being ported to the Dreamcast and GameCube. Like its predecessor, \"Ikaruga\" gained a reputation as one of the greatest shooters ever made. It was rereleased in 2008 on the Xbox 360.\nXbox 360 port.\nFollowing \"Ikaruga\"'s rerelease, fans began asking Treasure why \"Radiant Silvergun\" had not been rereleased as well, so Treasure began work on a port. At first, the port was being developed solely by Katsuhiro Sanjo at Treasure until others assisted. Development lasted two and a half years. Sanjo stated that bringing \"Radiant Silvergun\" to the Xbox 360 was more difficult than anticipated. He had difficulties recreating some of the backgrounds and the Saturn's special effects. In October 2010, Microsoft announced the game was coming to the Xbox Live Arcade in 2011, marking the game's first official release in the West.\nThe port features online and offline cooperative play, leaderboards, downloadable replays, and an option to play with updated graphics. There is also an option for a scoring system based on \"Ikaruga\". It was released on 14 September 2011 garnering \"generally favorable\" reviews according to ratings aggregator Metacritic. Critics praised the new high-resolution graphics options and new online modes and enhancements. They also appreciated the rerelease for giving more people the opportunity to play it given the Saturn version's expensive cost on second hand markets.\nThe Xbox 360 version was ported and released to the Nintendo Switch in September 2022. It was briefly pulled from the online store in North America at release due to a change in the game's content rating, but was added back six days later. The game was released on Steam in November 2023.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In 1611, he honored Galileo Galilei as a member of the papal Accademia dei Lincei and supported his discoveries. In 1616, Pope Paul V instructed Cardinal Robert Bellarmine to inform Galileo that the Copernican theory could not be taught as fact, but Bellarmine's certificate allowed Galileo to continue his studies in search for evidence and use the geocentric model as a theoretical device. That same year Paul V assured Galileo that he was safe from persecution so long as he, the Pope, should live. Bellarmine's certificate was used by Galileo for his defense at the trial of 1633.\nTrained in jurisprudence, Borghese was made Cardinal-Priest of Sant'Eusebio and the Cardinal Vicar of Rome by Pope Clement VIII. He was elected as Pope in 1605, following the death of Pope Leo XI. Pope Paul V was known for being stern and unyielding, defending the privileges of the Church. He met with Galileo Galilei in 1616 and was involved in the controversy over heliocentrism. He canonized and beatified several individuals during his papacy and created 60 cardinals in ten consistories.\nHis insistence on ecclesiastical jurisdiction led to conflicts with secular governments, notably with Venice, which resulted in an interdict on the city in 1606. This disagreement was eventually mediated by France and Spain in 1607. Pope Paul V's diplomacy also strained relations with England, as his actions were perceived as undermining moderate Catholics in the country.\nIn Rome, he financed the completion of St. Peter's Basilica, improved the Vatican Library, and restored the ancient Roman aqueduct Aqua Traiana. Pope Paul V established the Banco di Santo Spirito in 1605 and is also known for fostering the rise of the Borghese family through nepotism. He died on 28 January 1621, after suffering from a series of strokes and was succeeded by Pope Gregory XV.\nEarly life.\nCamillo Borghese was born in Rome on 17 September 1550 into the Borghese family of Siena which had recently established itself in Rome. He was the eldest of seven sons of the lawyer and Sienese patrician Marcantonio Borghese and his wife Flaminia Astalli, a Roman noblewoman. Camillo was carefully trained in jurisprudence at Perugia and Padua, and became a canonist of marked ability.\nCardinal.\nIn June 1596 Camillo was made the Cardinal-Priest of Sant'Eusebio and the Cardinal Vicar of Rome by Pope Clement VIII, and had as his secretary Niccol\u00f2 Alamanni. He then opted for other titular churches like San Crisogono and Santi Giovanni e Paolo.\nClement VIII also bestowed upon him episcopal consecration in 1597 after his appointment as Bishop of Jesi; the co-consecrators were Cardinal Silvio Savelli (former Latin Patriarch of Constantinople) and Cardinal Francesco Cornaro (former Bishop of Treviso). Bishop Borghese retained the diocese of Iesi until 1599. He held aloof from all parties and factions, devoting all his spare time to his law-books.\nPapacy.\nElection.\nWhen Pope Leo XI died, 1605, Cardinal Borghese became pope over a number of candidates including Caesar Baronius and Robert Bellarmine; his neutrality in the factional times made him an ideal compromise candidate. \nIn character he was very stern and unyielding, a lawyer rather than diplomat, who defended the privileges of the Church to his utmost. His first act was to send home to their sees the bishops who were sojourning in Rome, for the Council of Trent had insisted that every bishop reside in his diocese.\nTheology.\nPaul met with Galileo Galilei in 1616 after Cardinal Bellarmine had, on his orders, warned Galileo not to hold or defend the heliocentric ideas of Copernicus. Whether there was also an order not to teach those ideas in any way has been a matter for controversy. A letter from Bellarmine to Galileo states only the injunction that the heliocentric ideas could not be defended or held; this letter was written expressly to enable Galileo to defend himself against rumors concerning what had happened in the meeting with Bellarmine.\nIn 1618, a \"Decreto de Nuestro Sanctissimo Padre el Papa Paulo V. en favor dela Immaculada Concepci\u00f3n dela Sanctissima Virgen Madre de Dios y Se\u00f1ora Nuestra\" (Decree of our most holy father Pope Paul V in favor of the Immaculate Conception of the blessed Virgin Mary..) was published in Lima, Peru. \nCanonisations and beatifications.\nPaul V canonised Charles Borromeo on 1 November 1610 and Frances of Rome on 29 May 1608. He also canonized Pompejanus in 1615 and canonized Cardinal Albert de Louvain on 9 August 1621.\nHe also beatified a number of individuals which included Ignatius Loyola (27 July 1609), Philip Neri (11 May 1615), Teresa of Avila (24 April 1614), Aloysius Gonzaga (10 October 1605), and Francis Xavier (25 October 1619).\nConsistories.\nThe pope created 60 cardinals in ten consistories held during his pontificate. He named his nephew Scipione Borghese as a cardinal (continuing the trend of nepotism) and also named Alessandro Ludovisi, who would become his immediate successor, Pope Gregory XV, as a cardinal.\nForeign relations.\nEcclesiastical jurisdiction.\nPaul's insistence of ecclesiastical jurisdiction led to a number of quarrels between the Church and the secular governments of various states, notably Venice, where patricians, such as Ermolao Barbaro (1548\u20131622) of the noble Barbaro family, argued in favor of the exemption of the clergy from the jurisdiction of the civil courts. Venice passed two laws obnoxious to Paul, one forbidding the alienation of real estate in favour of the clergy, the second demanding approval of the civil power for the building of new churches. Two priests charged by the Venetian state with cruelty, wholesale poisoning, murder and licentiousness, were arrested by the Venetian Senate and put in dungeons for trial. Having been found guilty, they were committed to prison.\nPaul V insisted that they be released to the Church. He demanded the release of the priests as not being amenable to the secular law. When this was refused, the Pope threatened an interdict on account of the property laws and the imprisonment of ecclesiastics, which threat was presented to the Senate on Christmas 1605. The Venetian position was ably defended by a canon lawyer, Paolo Sarpi, who extended the matter to general principles defining separate secular and ecclesiastical spheres. In April 1606 the Pope excommunicated the entire government of Venice and placed an interdict on the city. Father Sarpi strongly advised the Venetian government to refuse to receive the Pope's interdict, and to reason with him while opposing force by force. The Venetian Senate willingly accepted this advice and Fra Paolo presented the case to Paul V, urging from history that the Pope's claim to intermeddle in civil matters was a usurpation; and that in these matters the Republic of Venice recognized no authority but that of God. The rest of the Catholic clergy sided with the city, with the exception of the Jesuits, the Theatines, and the Capuchins. The dissenting clergy were forthwith expelled from Venetian territories. Masses continued to be said in Venice, and the feast of Corpus Christi was celebrated with displays of public pomp and \"magnificence\", in defiance of the Pope. Within a year (March 1607) the disagreement was mediated by France and Spain. The Most Serene Republic refused to retract the laws, but asserted that Venice would conduct herself \"with her \"accustomed piety\".\" The Jesuits, which Venice considered subversive Papal agents, remained banned. No more could be expected. Paul withdrew his censure.\nThe Venetian Republic rewarded Fra Paulo Sarpi, its successful canon lawyer, with the distinction of state counsellor in jurisprudence and the liberty of access to the state archives, which infuriated Pope Paul. In September 1607, after unsuccessfully attempting to lure Father Sarpi to Rome, the Pope responded by putting out a contract on his life. Father Sarpi was the target of at least two assassination plots in September and October. Stabbed three times with a stiletto, Fra Sarpi somehow managed to recover, while the assassins found refuge in the Papal States.\nRelations with England.\nPaul V's hard-edged Catholic diplomacy cut the ground from under moderate Catholics in England. His letter of 9 July 1606 to congratulate James I on his accession to the throne was three years late and seemed to English eyes merely a preamble to what followed, and his reference to the Gunpowder Plot, made against the life of the monarch and all the members of Parliament the previous November, was unfortunate for the Papal cause, for Papal agents were considered by the English to have been involved (the effigy of Pope Paul V is still burnt every year during the Lewes Bonfire celebrations). However, the Pope in that letter pleaded with James not to make the innocent Catholics suffer for the crime of a few, and Paul V also promised to exhort all the Catholics of the realm to be submissive and loyal to their sovereign\u2014in all things not opposed to the honour of God. The oath of allegiance James demanded of his subjects, however contained clauses to which no 17th-century Catholic could in conscience subscribe: the oath of allegiance was solemnly condemned in a brief published a matter of weeks later (22 September 1606, extended 23 August 1607). This condemnation served only to divide English Catholics. The other irritant (to the papacy) in English relations was Cardinal Bellarmine's letter to the English archpriest George Blackwell, reproaching him for having taken the oath of allegiance in apparent disregard of his duty to the Pope. The letter received enough circulation to be referred to in one of James's theological essays (1608), and Bellarmine was soon fencing in a pamphlet exchange with the king of England.\nRelations with Japan.\nIn November 1615, Paul V welcomed the embassy of the Japanese samurai Hasekura Tsunenaga in Rome.\nHasekura gave the Pope a letter (from Date Masamune) which requested a trade treaty between Japan and New Spain. The letter also asked for Christian missionaries to be sent to Japan. The Pope agreed to the dispatch of missionaries, but left the decision for trade to the King of Spain.\nConstructions.\nIn Rome, the pope financed the completion of St. Peter's Basilica; this is noted in the Latin inscription across the facade of the Basilica, \"IN HONOREM PRINCIPIS APOST. PAULUS V BURGHESIUS ROMANUS PONT. MAX. AN. MDCXII PONT VII\" (\"In honour of the Prince of the Apostles Paul V Borghese, Supreme Roman Pontiff, in the year 1612, the 7th year of his pontificate\"). He also improved the Vatican Library, separating out the Vatican Apostolic Archives. He restored the Aqua Traiana, an ancient Roman aqueduct (named after him \"Acqua Paola\"), bringing water to the rioni located on right bank of the Tiber (Trastevere and Borgo) using materials from his demolition of the Forum of Nerva. He had always encouraged Guido Reni. Like many Popes of the time he was also allegedly guilty of nepotism, and his nephew Scipione Borghese wielded enormous power on his behalf, consolidating the rise of the Borghese family.\nPaul V also established the Bank of the Holy Spirit in 1605.\nDeath.\nPaul V died on 28 January 1621 of a stroke in the Quirinal Palace and was succeeded as pope by Pope Gregory XV. The pope had been ill for more than three months following a series of strokes, and died six hours following his last stroke the morning of his death. He was interred in the basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\u00a0This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain:\u00a0"}

Millions of years after the seamounts rose above the Atlantic, the first lizards, insects and plants came to the archipelago, possibly on ocean currents from the African mainland when the ocean's salinity was lower.\nThe archipelago experienced several large volcanic eruptions, including Praia Grande 4.5 million years ago, S\u00e3o Vicente (and, possibly, present-day Porto Grande) 300,000 years ago, Topo da Coroa 200,000 years ago, and east of present-day Fogo 73,000 years ago which inundated coastal Santiago Island and possibly Brava and part of the Barlavento Islands.\nDuring the last Ice Age, the sea level dropped to about below its current level. Cape Verde's islands were slightly larger, and there was a large island known as Northwest Island. Santo Ant\u00e3o was one kilometer northwest of the island; Boa Vista and Maio were one island, and another island known as Nola (Ilha da Nola, northwest of Santo Ant\u00e3o) was about meters above sea level. Before the end of the Ice Age, the Eastern Island (Ilha Occidental) split into three islands; one became submerged and is now the Jo\u00e3o Valente Reef, the Canal de S\u00e3o Vicente widened to provide separation from Santo Ant\u00e3o, Nola Island was submerged and again became a seamount, and eastern Northwest Island broke up into S\u00e3o Vicente, the smaller Santa Luzia, and the two islets of Branco and Raso.\nPossible classical references.\nCape Verde may have been referenced in \"De choreographia\" by Pomponius Mela and \"Historia naturalis\" by Pliny the Elder. Mela and Pliny called the islands \"Gorgades\", referring to the home of the mythical Gorgons killed by Perseus. In typical ancient euhemerism, they suggested the islands as the place where the Carthaginian Hanno the Navigator slew two female \"Gorillai\".\nPliny, citing the Greek writer Xenophon of Lampsacus, placed the Gorgades at two days' travel from \"Hesperu Ceras\" (the westernmost part of the African continent, today called Cap-Vert). As quoted by Gaius Julius Solinus, he also said that the voyage from the Gorgades to the Hesperides took around 40 days. The Isles of the Blessed, written about by Marinus of Tyre and referenced by Ptolemy in his \"Geographia\", may have been the Cape Verde islands.\nPortuguese discovery and colonisation.\n15th and 16th centuries.\nIn 1456, Alvise Cadamosto, Antoniotto Usodimare (Venetian and Genoese captains, respectively, in the service of Prince Henry the Navigator) and an unnamed Portuguese captain discovered some of the islands. During the next decade, Diogo Gomes and Ant\u00f3nio de Noli (also captains in the service of Prince Henry) discovered the remaining islands of the archipelago. When they first landed in Cape Verde, the islands were barren of people but not of vegetation.\nPrince Fernando, King Afonso V of Portugal's brother, was granted the archipelago as a fiefdom.\nThe Portuguese established Ribeira Grande (present-day Cidade Velha) in 1462 on the island of S\u00e3o Tiago. This was the first permanent European settlement in the tropics. The first settlers included Portuguese, Genoese, and Flemish adventurers; reprieved convicts; and Sephardic Jews fleeing persecution. In 1466, with the settlement failing to attract enough settlers, Afonso gave the population trading rights in all of West Africa except Arguim. He rescinded this a few years later, when the monarchy began selling lucrative trade monopolies instead, but enterprising Cape Verdeans and Luso-Africans would still play a prominent role in the first centuries of European trade in the region, often in defiance of the Portuguese crown.\nIn Spain, the Reconquista was growing in its mission to conquer Iberia and expel the Muslims and Jews. In 1492, the Spanish Inquisition also emerged in its fullest expression of anti-Semitism. It spread to neighboring Portugal (as the Portuguese Inquisition), where King Jo\u00e3o II and Manuel I exiled thousands of Jews to S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9, Pr\u00edncipe, and Cape Verde in 1496.\nThe Portuguese soon brought slaves from the West African coast. Positioned on trade routes between Africa, Europe, and the New World, the archipelago prospered from the transatlantic slave trade during the 16th century. Sao Tiago and Fogo hosted slave plantations growing sugar and cotton for shipment to Portugal, and producing \"panos\" (cotton cloth) for export to West Africa. Massive amounts of salt were produced on Maio, Boa Vista, and Sal, sold to cod fishermen. Horses were reared on Santiago and shipped to the African coast as well.\nSettlements began to appear on other islands. S\u00e3o Filipe was founded in 1500; Ponta do Sol and Ribeira Grande were founded in the mid-16th century (when its first settlers also arrived in Madeira and Ribeira Brava on S\u00e3o Nicolau). Povoa\u00e7\u00e3o Velha on Boa Vista, Furna, Nova Sintra on Brava, and Palmeira on Sal were later founded.\nCabo Verdean society at this period was deeply segregated and hierarchical. At the top were the peninsula-born Portuguese whites, mostly government officials, soldiers, and the upper clergy. The next group were the \"brancos da terra\", the local whites, with the earliest settlers and their descendants, the \"morgados\", chief among them. Free \"pardos\" (mulattos) and \"pretos\" (blacks) came next, and the \"escravos\" (slaves) were at the bottom.\nThe islands' prosperity encouraged sacking by pirates, particularly during the period of the Iberian Union 1580\u20131640, when Spain's enemies, the British, French, and Dutch, raided Portuguese colonies. Sir Francis Drake sacked Ribeira Grande in 1582, captured the island in 1585 and raided Cidade Velha, Praia and S\u00e3o Domingos.\n17th and 18th centuries.\nDuring the 17th century, Algerian corsairs established a base on the Cape Verde islands. They raided Madeira in 1617, stealing the church bells and taking 1,200 people captive.\nGiven the scarcity of capital for the region's development, the Portuguese Finance and Overseas Councils authorized the 1664 foundation of the Guinea Coast Company. The company aimed at the slave trade, ending individual tenancy and encouraging slave companies. The Company of Cacheu and Rivers and Commerce of Guinea, which operated between 1676 and 1682, was succeeded by the Company of Cacheu and Cape Verde in 1690.\nPico do Fogo erupted in 1680, which resulted in the movement of the population to Brava and other regions (including Brazil). For a few years, the volcano was a natural lighthouse for sailors. The latter decades of the 17th century also saw the first emigration flows from the islands to North America. Whales abounded in the waters around Cape Verde, and whaling ships from Massachusetts and Rhode Island recruited local crewmen who knew the currents and weather from the islands of Brava and Fogo. These outflows would continue for centuries.\nAs a result of the 1712 French Cassard expedition in which Ribeira Grande was destroyed, the capital was partially moved to Praia. With the Portuguese increasingly sidelined in Atlantic trade, Cape Verde became a poor backwater. By 1740, the island was a supply point for American slave ships and whalers. This began a stream of male immigration to the American colonies. Praia, with its natural harbor, became the permanent capital in 1770 as the plantation economy diminished in importance relative to trade and naval supply.\nIn 1747, the islands were hit with the first of several droughts and famines which have plagued them ever since at average five-year intervals. The situation was made worse by deforestation and overgrazing, which destroyed the ground vegetation that provided moisture. Three major droughts during the 18th and 19th centuries resulted in well over 100,000 people starving to death. The Portuguese government sent little relief during the droughts.\nIn 1758 the Gr\u00e3o Par\u00e1 and Maranh\u00e3o Company was granted a 20-year monopoly on all trade in Cape Verde and the West African coast. Its agents ruthlessly exploited the islands' inhabitants, commandeering panos, liquor, food, and other supplies regardless of droughts and famines. Many were recruited for service in Guinea. Construction of the Fortaleza de S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 da Amura in Bissau cost more than 2,600 lives, most of them Cabo Verdean laborers. Textiles were smuggled and sold on the black market. Between 1766 and 1776, 95,000 \"barafulas\" (Cape Verdean textiles) were imported to the Guinean coast.\nPico do Fogo again erupted in 1769. This was the last time it erupted from the top, although it also erupted in 1785 and 1799. Another famine, affecting Brava and Fogo, began in 1774; 20,000 people starved. Fogo's population dropped from 5,700 to 4,200 around 1777. The company's mismanagement made the situation worse, as they sold desperately needed food and raised the prices of what little was available. In 1778 the monopoly ended, and the Portuguese created the province of Cabo Verde e Guine.\nAlthough Portugal was neutral in the Anglo-French War and American Revolutionary War, British and French squadrons fought the Battle of Porto Praya off Praia on 16 April 1781.\n19th century.\nMindelo (originally Nossa Senhora da Luz) was founded in 1795, Pedra de Lume on Sal in 1799, and Santa Maria in early 1830 on the same island. Praia (the colonial capital) was modernized in 1822, expanding northward.\nIn the aftermarth of the Liberal Revolution of 1820, slave trader Manuel Ant\u00f3nio Martins used the unrest to form a junta with other leading civilians, driving the governor out and ruling the islands until 1823. Martins was officially appointed prefect of the province in 1833. Soon after he took office, he disbanded the \"branco\"-dominated militias. When, in 1835, some conservative officers in the local garrison mutinied, the disaffected \"brancos\" accused Martins of abetting the plot and arrested him. A new governor, Joaquim Pereira Marinho, arrived in September to restore order. He attempted to start local fishing companies, where previously Cape Verdean had been banned from owning boats for fear of slaves escaping, but his successor cancelled the project.\nThe British established a station in Mindelo to refuel ships with coal, water, and other supplies beginning in 1839, and the city flourished. Two attempts to move the colonial capital from Praia were made: a plan to move to Picos in 1831 when another famine struck Cape Verde, and Mindelo was proposed in 1838. Many people did not want to move the colonial capital, and it remained in Praia. Two submarine telegraph cables were linked in 1874 to Pernambuco, Brazil and to Cameroon via Bathurst in the Gambia in 1885.\nThe system of \"morgados\" was abolished in 1863, and slavery in 1864, but much of the population remained dependent on their former masters, renting or sharecropping land. The decline of the slave trade dealt a blow to Cape Verde's economy. The shipping traffic at Mindelo, however, served as an important engine of economic activity. Ships plying the South Atlantic to and from Africa and Asia stopped at Mindelo for coal, salt, meat, water, and wine imported from Madeira and the Azores. In 1890 a total of 156 ships unloaded 657,633,588 metric tons of coal there, and the port was visited by 2,264 ships carrying 344,907 persons.\n20th century.\nThroughout much of the 20th century, the colonial government organized forced emigration to supply \"contract\" labor for Portugal's tropical colonies. Between 1900 and 1970, particularly during periods of famine when people were desperate, some 80,000 Cabo Verdeans were shipped to the plantations of Sao Tome e Principe, and more than 7,000 to Angola and Mozambique.\nMindelo became the most-used transatlantic telegraph station in 1912. A total of 669 ships were refueled each year at the port, reaching 1,927 ships a decade later. When gasoline began to be used as fuel, however, Mindelo could not rival the improved port facilities of Las Palmas on Grand Canary or nearby Dakar in Senegal. The Suez Canal had also rerouted much of the maritime traffic out of the south Atlantic. The use of coal declined, leading to a coal strike in 1912 due to insufficient work. When the Great Depression began in 1930, ship activity ended.\nTwo of Cabo Verde's worst-ever famines occurred in 1941-43 and 1947\u201348, killing an estimated 45,000 people. The massive disaster was not reported in the Portuguese press, and no food aid was sent, due to World War II. Half the population of Fogo perished. Portuguese authorities forbade reporting on the deaths or even the use of the word \"famine.\"\nEspargos, in the centre of the island of Sal was founded in the late 1940s as the last Portuguese airport town. From 1950 to 1970, the number of flights increased. Espargos became an important stop for Alitalia's Portuguese-Brazilian flights and South African Airways' (SAA) 1967 flights between London and Johannesburg. The airline had to use the airport because to the international boycott of South Africa due to its apartheid policy.\nIn 1952, the Portuguese government planned to transfer over 10,000 settlers to the island of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe (another Portuguese colony) to work on plantations. Africans came primarily from the islands of S\u00e3o Nicolau, Santiago, Santo Ant\u00e3o, Fogo, and Brava. When the two colonies became independent, many people left for Europe and the United States, and few returned to Cape Verde. Several famines occurred at this time due to poor harvests, the Second World War, and a poor response from the Portuguese colonial administration. Until and during the Portuguese Colonial War, those planning and fighting in the armed conflict in Portuguese Guinea often linked the liberation of Guinea-Bissau to liberation in Cape Verde; in 1956, Am\u00edlcar and Lu\u00eds Cabral founded the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde.\nIndependence movement.\nAlthough Cape Verde was neglected by Portugal, Portuguese treatment of Cape Verdeans was differed from their treatment of other colonized peoples; the people of Cape Verde fared slightly better than Africans in other Portuguese colonies because of their lighter skin. A small minority received an education, and Cape Verde was the first African-Portuguese colony to have an institution of higher education. By the time of independence, one-quarter of the population could read (compared to five percent in Portuguese Guinea, present-day Guinea-Bissau).\nLiterate Cape Verdeans became aware of the pressures for independence which were building on the mainland. The islands continued experiencing droughts, famines, epidemics and volcanic eruptions amid Portuguese government indifference. Thousands of people died of starvation during the first half of the 20th century. Although the nationalist movement appeared less fervent in Cape Verde than in Portugal's other African holdings, the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (Partido Africano da Independ\u00eancia da Guin\u00e9 e Cabo Verde, or PAIGC) was founded in 1956 by Am\u00edlcar Cabral and other pan-Africanists. Many Cape Verdeans fought for independence in Guinea-Bissau.\nIn 1926, Portugal had become a rightist dictatorship which regarded the colonies as an economic frontier to be developed in the interest of Portugal and the Portuguese. Famines, unemployment, poverty, and the failure of the Portuguese government to address those issues caused resentment, but Portuguese dictator Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar did not want to give up his colonies as easily as other European colonial powers had given up theirs.\nAfter World War II, Portugal was intent on holding onto its former colonies (known since 1951 as overseas territories). When most former African colonies gained independence between 1957 and 1964, the Portuguese still held on. After the Pijiguiti Massacre, however, the people of Cape Verde and Guinea-Bissau fought one of the longest African liberation wars.\nLike other colonies, autonomy was granted in 1972 and Portuguese Cape Verde held its only parliamentary elections in 1973 in which only Portuguese citizens could vote. Only 25,521 people registered to vote out of a total population of 272,071, and a total of 20,942 people voted. The Portuguese constitution banned political parties at the time, and most of the candidates were put forward by the ruling People's National Action movement; some civic associations, however, were allowed to nominate candidates.\nAfter the 25 April 1974 Carnation Revolution, Cape Verde became more autonomous but continued to have an overseas governor until that post became a high commissioner. Widespread unrest forced the government to negotiate with the PAIGC, and agreements for an independent Cape Verde were on the table. Pedro Pires (at the time still in Algeria) signed an agreement at the end of August that year to give Portuguese Guinea and Cape Verde both paths to independence, with the islands planned to hold a referendum on such in the near future. However, such referendum never ended up being scheduled, with the PAIGC renouncing the agreement by the next February as they established their government on the islands, asking for immediate independence without a referendum instead. On 5 July in Praia, Portuguese Prime Minister Vasco Gon\u00e7alves transferred power to National Assembly President Abilio Duarte. The colonial history of Cape Verde ended when Cape Verde become independent, a negotiated transfer, and one of the few Portuguese African colonies to achieve independence without guerilla fighting within its borders.\nAfter independence (1975).\nOne-party rule.\nImmediately after a November 1980 coup in Guinea-Bissau (Portuguese Guinea declared independence in 1973 and was granted \"de jure\" independence in 1974), relations between the two countries became strained. Cape Verde abandoned its hope for unity with Guinea-Bissau, and formed the African Party for the Independence of Cape Verde (PAICV).\nResponding to growing pressure for a political opening, the PAICV called an emergency congress in February 1990 to discuss proposed constitutional changes to end one-party rule. Opposition groups came together to form the Movement for Democracy (MpD) in Praia in April of that year, and campaigned for the right to contest the presidential election scheduled for December 1990. The one-party state was abolished on 28 September of that year, and the first multi-party elections were held in January 1991.\nEnd of one-party rule.\nThe MpD won a majority of the seats in the National Assembly. MpD presidential candidate Ant\u00f3nio Mascarenhas Monteiro defeated the PAICV candidate, 73.5 percent to 26.5 percent.\nLegislative elections in December 1995 increased the MpD majority in the National Assembly, where the party held 50 of its 72 seats. A February 1996 presidential election returned Monteiro to office.\nIn the presidential election campaign of 2000 and 2001, two former prime ministers (Pedro Pires and Carlos Veiga) were the main candidates. Pires was prime minister during the PAICV regime; Veiga was prime minister during most of Monteiro's presidency, stepping aside to campaign. In what might have been one of the closest races in electoral history, Pires won by 12 votes; he and Veiga each received nearly half the votes. Pires was narrowly re-elected in the 2006 elections.\nJorge Carlos Almeida Fonseca, President of Cape Verde since 2011, was re-elected in October 2016. Fonseca was supported by the Movement for Democracy (MpD). MpD leader Ulisses Correia e Silva has been prime minister since the 2016 elections, when his party ousted the ruling PAICV for the first time in 15 years. In April 2021, the ruling party, led by Prime Minister Jose Ulisses Correia e Silva, maintained its parliamentary majority in the election.\nIn October 2021, opposition candidate and former prime minister Jose Maria Neves of PAICV won Cape Verde's presidential election. On 9 November of that year, Neves was sworn in as president.\nOn 2 February 2024, Cape Verde became the third African country to be free of malaria.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He previously served as the 31st governor of Illinois from 1949 to 1953 and was the Democratic Party nominee for president of the United States in 1952 and 1956, losing both elections to Dwight D. Eisenhower. \nStevenson was the grandson of Adlai Stevenson, the 23rd vice president of the United States. He was raised in Bloomington, Illinois. After a short stint in the U.S. Navy at the end of World War I, he became a lawyer. He served in many positions in the federal government during the Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry Truman presidential administrations, including in the Department of the Navy, and the State Department during World War II. In 1945, he served on the committee that created the United Nations, and was a member of the initial U.S. delegations to the UN.\nIn 1948, Stevenson was elected governor of Illinois, defeating incumbent governor Dwight H. Green in an upset. As governor, Stevenson reformed the state police, cracked down on illegal gambling, improved the state highways, and attempted to cleanse the state government of corruption. Stevenson also sought, with mixed success, to reform the Illinois state constitution and introduced several crime bills in the state legislature.\nIn 1952 and 1956, Stevenson was chosen as the Democratic nominee for president but was defeated in a landslide by Eisenhower both times, campaigning on themes of diplomatic engagement, moderate economic management, and the preservation of civil liberties amid the tensions of the early Cold War. In 1960, he unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination for a third time at the Democratic National Convention. After President John F. Kennedy was elected, persistent tensions \u2013 particularly Kennedy's perception that Stevenson had been late to endorse his candidacy \u2013 prompted Kennedy to decline offering him a cabinet position and instead appoint him as the United States ambassador to the United Nations (UN). Two major events Stevenson dealt with during his time as UN ambassador were the Bay of Pigs Invasion of Cuba in April 1961 and the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962. He was still serving as UN ambassador through the Lyndon Johnson administration when he suffered a heart attack during a visit to London on July 14, 1965, dying later that day at the age of 65. He is buried in Evergreen Cemetery in his hometown of Bloomington, Illinois.\nEarly life and education.\nAdlai Ewing Stevenson II was born in Los Angeles, California, in a neighborhood that is now designated as the North University Park Historic District. His home and birthplace at 2639 Monmouth Avenue has been designated as a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument. He was a member of a prominent Illinois political family. His grandfather and namesake Adlai Stevenson was Vice President of the United States under President Grover Cleveland from 1893 to 1897. His father, Lewis Stevenson, never held an elected office, but was appointed Illinois Secretary of State (1914\u20131917) and was considered a strong contender for the Democratic vice-presidential nomination in 1928. A maternal great-grandfather, Jesse W. Fell, had been a close friend and campaign manager for Abraham Lincoln in his 1858 US Senate race; Stevenson often referred to Fell as his favorite ancestor. Stevenson's eldest son, Adlai E. Stevenson III, became a U.S. Senator from Illinois (1970\u20131981). His mother was Helen Davis Stevenson, and he had an older sister, Elizabeth Stevenson Ives, an author who was called \"Buffie\". Actor McLean Stevenson was a second cousin once removed. He was the nephew by marriage of novelist Mary Borden, and she assisted in the writing of some of his political speeches.\nStevenson was raised in the city of Bloomington, Illinois, and his family was a member of Bloomington's upper class and lived in one of the city's well-to-do neighborhoods. On December 30, 1912, at the age of twelve, Stevenson accidentally killed Ruth Merwin, a 16-year-old friend, while demonstrating drill technique with a rifle, inadvertently left loaded, during a party at the Stevenson home. Stevenson was devastated by the accident and rarely mentioned or discussed it as an adult, even with his wife and children. However, in 1955 Stevenson heard about a woman whose son had experienced a similar tragedy. He wrote to her that she should tell her son that \"he must now live for two\", which Stevenson's friends took to be a reference to the shooting incident.\nStevenson left Bloomington High School after his junior year and attended University High School in Normal, Illinois, Bloomington's \"twin city\", just to the north. He then went to boarding school in Connecticut at The Choate School (now Choate Rosemary Hall), where he played on the tennis team, acted in plays, and was elected editor-in-chief of \"The Choate News\", the school newspaper. Upon his graduation from Choate in 1918, he enlisted in the United States Naval Reserve for World War I. He served as a seaman apprentice while undergoing training but the Armistice of November 11, 1918 ended the war while he was still in training, and he was discharged as a seaman second class in January 1919.\nHe attended Princeton University, becoming managing editor of \"The Daily Princetonian\", a member of the American Whig-Cliosophic Society, a member of the Quadrangle Club, and received a B.A. degree in 1922 in literature and history. Under prodding from his father, he then went to Harvard Law School, but found law to be \"uninteresting\", and withdrew after failing several classes. He returned to Bloomington where he wrote for the family newspaper, \"The Daily Pantagraph\", which was founded by his maternal great-grandfather Jesse Fell. The \"Pantagraph\", which had one of the largest circulations of any newspaper in Illinois outside the Chicago area, was a main source of the Stevenson family's wealth. Following his mother's death in 1935, Adlai inherited one-quarter of the \"Pantagraph's\" stock, providing him with a large, dependable source of income for the rest of his life.\nA year after leaving Harvard, Stevenson became interested in the law again after talking to Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. When he returned home to Bloomington, he decided to finish his degree at Northwestern University School of Law, attending classes during the week and returning to Bloomington on the weekends to write for the \"Pantagraph\". Stevenson received his J.D. degree from Northwestern in 1926 and passed the Illinois state bar examination the same year. He obtained a position at Cutting, Moore &amp; Sidley, one of Chicago's oldest and most prestigious law firms.\nFamily.\nOn December 1, 1928, Stevenson married Ellen Borden, a well-to-do socialite. The young couple soon became popular and familiar figures on the Chicago social scene; they especially enjoyed attending and hosting costume parties. They had three sons: Adlai Stevenson III, who would become a U.S. Senator; Borden Stevenson, and John Fell Stevenson. In 1935, Adlai and Ellen purchased a tract of land along the Des Plaines River near Libertyville, Illinois, a wealthy suburb of Chicago. They built a home on the property and it served as Stevenson's official residence for the rest of his life. Although he spent relatively little time there due to his career, Stevenson did consider the estate to be his home, and in the 1950s, he was often called \"The Man from Libertyville\" by the national news media. Stevenson also purchased a farm in northwestern Illinois, just outside Galena, where he frequently rode horses and kept some cattle.\nOn December 12, 1949, Adlai and Ellen were divorced; their son Adlai III later recalled that \"There hadn't been a good relationship for a long time. I remember her [Ellen] as the unreasonable one, not only with Dad, but with us and the servants. I was embarrassed by her peremptory way with servants.\" Several of Stevenson's biographers have written that his wife suffered from mental illness: \"Incidents that went from petulant to bizarre to nasty generally have been described without placing them in the context of the progression of [her] increasingly serious mental illness. It was an illness that those closest to her \u2013 including Adlai for long after the divorce \u2013 were slow and reluctant to recognize. Hindsight, legal proceedings, and psychiatric testimony now make understandable the behavior that baffled and saddened her family.\" Stevenson did not remarry after his divorce, but instead dated a number of prominent women throughout the rest of his life, including Alicia Patterson, Marietta Tree, and Betty Beale.\nReligion.\nStevenson belonged to the Unitarian faith, and was a longtime member of Bloomington's Unitarian church. However, he also occasionally attended Presbyterian services in Libertyville, where a Unitarian church was not present, and as governor he became close friends with the Rev. Richard Graebel, the pastor of Springfield's First Presbyterian church. Graebel \"acknowledged that Stevenson's Unitarian rearing had imbued him with the means of translating religious and ethical values into civic issues\". According to one historian, \"religion never disappeared entirely from his public messages \u2013 it was indeed part of his appeal\".\nEarly career.\nIn July 1933, Stevenson took a job opportunity as special attorney and assistant to Jerome Frank, the general counsel of the Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA), a part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal. Following the repeal of Prohibition in December 1933, Stevenson changed jobs, becoming chief attorney for the Federal Alcohol Control Administration (FACA), a subsidiary of the AAA which regulated the activities of the alcohol industry.\nIn 1935, Stevenson returned to Chicago to practice law. He became involved in civic activities, particularly as chairman of the Chicago branch of the Committee to Defend America by Aiding the Allies from 1940 to 1941. As chairman, Stevenson worked to raise public support for military and economic aid to the United Kingdom and its allies in fighting Nazi Germany during the Second World War. Stevenson \"believed Britain [was] America's first line of defense\" and \"argued for a repeal of the neutrality legislation\" and support for President Roosevelt's Lend-Lease programme. His efforts earned strong criticism from Colonel Robert R. McCormick, the powerful, isolationist publisher of the \"Chicago Tribune,\" and a leading member of the non-interventionist America First Committee.\nIn 1940, Major Frank Knox, newly appointed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt as Secretary of the Navy, offered Stevenson a position as Principal Attorney and special assistant. Stevenson accepted the position and in this capacity wrote speeches, represented Secretary Knox and the Navy on committees, toured the various theaters of war, and handled many administrative duties. Since Knox was largely a figurehead, there were few major roles for Stevenson. However, in early 1944 he joined a mission to Sicily and Italy for the Foreign Economic Administration to report on the country's economy. After Knox died in April 1944, Stevenson returned to Chicago where he attempted to purchase Knox's controlling interest in the \"Chicago Daily News\", but his syndicate was outbid by another party.\nIn 1945, Stevenson took a temporary position in the State Department, as special assistant to US Secretary of State Edward Stettinius to work with Assistant Secretary of State Archibald MacLeish on a proposed world organization. Later that year, he went to London as Deputy United States Delegate to the Preparatory Commission of the United Nations Organization, a position he held until February 1946. When the head of the delegation fell ill, Stevenson assumed his role. His work at the commission, and in particular his dealings with the representatives of the Soviet Union, resulted in appointments to the US delegations to the United Nations in 1946 and 1947.\nGovernor of Illinois, 1949 to 1953.\nIn 1948, Stevenson was chosen by Jacob Arvey, leader of the powerful Chicago Democratic political organization, to be the Democratic candidate in the Illinois gubernatorial race against the incumbent Republican, Dwight H. Green. In an upset, Stevenson defeated Green by 572,067 votes, a record margin in Illinois gubernatorial elections. President Truman carried Illinois by only 33,612 votes against his Republican opponent, Thomas E. Dewey, leading a biographer to write that \"Clearly, Adlai had carried the President in with him.\" Paul Douglas, a University of Chicago professor of economics, was elected senator on the same ticket.\nPrincipal among Stevenson's achievements as Illinois governor were reforming the state police by removing political considerations from hiring practices and instituting a merit system for employment and promotion, cracking down on illegal gambling, and improving the state highways. He sought, with mixed success, to cleanse the Illinois state government of corruption; in one instance he fired the warden of the state penitentiary for overcrowding, political corruption, and incompetence that had left the prisoners on the verge of revolt, and in another instance Stevenson fired the superintendent of an institution for alcoholics when he learned that the superintendent, after receiving bribes from local tavern owners, was allowing the patients to buy drinks at local bars. Two of Stevenson's major initiatives as governor were a proposal to create a constitutional convention (called \"con-con\") to reform and improve the Illinois state constitution, and several crime bills that would have provided new resources and methods to fight criminal activities in Illinois. Most of the crime bills and con-con failed to pass the state legislature, much to Stevenson's chagrin. However, Stevenson agreed to support a Republican alternative to con-con called \"Gateway\", it passed the legislature and was approved by Illinois voters in a 1950 referendum. Stevenson's push for an improved state constitution \"began the process of constitutional change...and in 1969, four years after his death, the goal was achieved. It was perhaps his most important achievement as governor.\" The new constitution had the effect of removing the structural limitations on the growth of government in the state.\nStevenson's governorship coincided with the Second Red Scare, and during his term, the Illinois state legislature passed a bill that would have \"made it a felony to belong to any subversive group\", and would have required \"a loyalty oath of public employees and candidates for office.\" Stevenson vetoed the bill. In his public message regarding the veto, Stevenson wrote:Does anyone seriously think that a real traitor will hesitate to sign a loyalty oath? Of course not. Really dangerous subversives and saboteurs will be caught by careful, constant, professional investigation, not by pieces of paper. The whole notion of loyalty inquisitions is a natural characteristic of the police state, not of democracy. I know full well this veto will be distorted and misunderstood...I know that to veto this bill in this period of grave anxiety will be unpopular with many. But I must, in good conscience, protest against any unnecessary suppression of our ancient rights as free men...we will win the contest of ideas that afflicts the world not by suppressing those rights, but by their triumph.\nStevenson proved to be a popular public speaker and gained a national reputation as an intellectual, with a self-deprecating sense of humor to match. One example came when the Illinois legislature passed a bill (supported by bird lovers) declaring that cats roaming unescorted was a public nuisance. Stevenson vetoed the bill and sent this public message regarding the veto:It is in the nature of cats to do a certain amount of unescorted roaming... the problem of cat versus bird is as old as time. If we attempt to solve it by legislation who knows but what we may be called upon to take sides as well in the age old problem of dog versus cat, bird versus bird, or even bird versus worm. In my opinion, the State of Illinois and its local governing bodies already have enough to do without trying to control feline delinquency. For these reasons, and not because I love birds the less or cats the more, I veto and withhold my approval from Senate Bill No. 93.\nOn June 2, 1949, Stevenson privately gave a sworn deposition as a character witness for Alger Hiss, a former State Department official who was later found to be a spy for the Soviet Union. Stevenson had infrequently worked with Hiss, first in the legal division of the Agricultural Adjustment Administration in 1933 and then in 1945, 1946, and 1947 on various United Nations projects, but he was not a close friend or associate of him. In the deposition, Stevenson testified that the reputation of Hiss for integrity, loyalty, and veracity was good. In 1950, Hiss was found guilty of perjury on the spying charges. Stevenson's deposition, according to his biographer Porter McKeever, would later be used in the 1952 presidential campaign by senators Joseph McCarthy and Richard Nixon to \"inflame public opinion and attack Adlai as 'soft on communism'.\" In the 1952 campaign, Senator Nixon would claim that Stevenson's \"defense of Hiss\" reflected such \"poor judgment\" on his part that \"doubt was cast about Adlai's capacity to govern.\" In a 1952 appearance on NBC's \"Meet the Press\", Stevenson responded to a question about his deposition for Hiss by saying, \"I'm a lawyer. I think that one of the most fundamental responsibilities... particularly of lawyers, is to give testimony in a court of law, to give it honestly and willingly, and it will be a very unhappy day for Anglo-Saxon justice when a man, even in public life, is too timid to state what he knows and what he has heard about a defendant in a criminal trial for fear that defendant might later be convicted. That would to me be the ultimate timidity.\"\nPresidential campaigns.\n1952 Presidential election.\nEarly in 1952, while Stevenson was still governor of Illinois, President Harry S. Truman decided that he would not seek another term as president. Instead, Truman met with Stevenson in Washington and proposed that Stevenson seek the Democratic nomination for president; Truman promised him his support if he did so. Stevenson at first hesitated, arguing that he was committed to running for a second gubernatorial term in Illinois. However, a number of his friends and associates (such as George Wildman Ball) quietly began organizing a \"draft Stevenson\" movement for president; they persisted in their activity even when Stevenson (both publicly and privately) told them to stop. When Stevenson continued to state that he was not a candidate, President Truman and the Democratic Party leadership looked for other prospective candidates. However, each of the other main contenders had a major weakness. Senator Estes Kefauver of Tennessee won most of the presidential primaries and entered the 1952 Democratic National Convention with the largest number of delegates, but he was unpopular with President Truman and other prominent Democrats. In 1950, Kefauver had chaired a Senate committee that traveled to several large cities and held televised hearings into organized crime. The hearings revealed connections between organized-crime syndicates and big-city Democratic political organizations, which led Truman and other Democratic leaders to oppose Kefauver's bid for the nomination: \"a machine politician and proud of it, [Truman] had no use for reformers who blackened the names of fellow Democrats.\" Truman favored U.S. diplomat W. Averell Harriman, but he had never held elected office and was inexperienced in national politics. Truman next turned to his vice-president, Alben Barkley, but at 74 years of age he was dismissed as being too old by labor union leaders. Senator Richard Russell Jr. of Georgia was popular in the South and his campaign easily won the Florida primary, but his support for racial segregation and opposition to civil rights for blacks made him unacceptable to Northern and Western Democrats. In the end, Stevenson, despite his reluctance to run, remained the most attractive candidate heading into the 1952 Democratic National Convention in Chicago.\nAt the convention, Stevenson, as governor of the host state, was assigned to give the welcoming address to the delegates. His speech was so stirring and witty that it invigorated efforts to secure the nomination for him, in spite of his continued protests that he was not a presidential candidate. In his welcoming speech he poked fun at the 1952 Republican National Convention, which had been held in Chicago in the same coliseum two weeks earlier. Stevenson described the achievements of the Democratic Party under presidents Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman, but noted:our Republican friends have said it was all a miserable failure. For almost a week pompous phrases marched over this landscape in search of an idea, and the only idea that they found was that the two great decades of progress...were the misbegotten spawn of bungling, of corruption, of socialism, of mismanagement, of waste and worse...after listening to this everlasting procession of epithets about our [party's] misdeeds I was even surprised the next morning when the mail was delivered on time. But we Democrats were by no means the only victims here. First they [Republicans] slaughtered each other, and then they went after us...perhaps the proximity of the stockyards accounts for the carnage.\nFollowing this speech, the Illinois delegation (led by Jacob Arvey) announced that they would place Stevenson's name in nomination, and Stevenson called President Truman to ask if \"he would be embarrassed\" if Stevenson formally announced his candidacy for the nomination. Truman told Stevenson \"I have been trying since January to get you to say that. Why should it embarrass me?\" Kefauver led on the first ballot, but was well below the vote total he needed to win. Stevenson gradually gained strength until he was nominated on the third ballot. The 1952 Democratic National Convention was the last political convention of either major party to require more than one ballot to nominate a presidential candidate.\nHistorian John Frederick Martin says party leaders selected Stevenson because he was \"more moderate on civil rights than Estes Kefauver, yet nonetheless acceptable to labor and urban machines\u2014so a coalition of southern, urban, and labor leaders fell in behind his candidacy in Chicago\". Stevenson's 1952 running mate was Senator John Sparkman of Alabama.\nStevenson accepted the Democratic nomination with an acceptance speech that, according to contemporaries, \"electrified the delegates:\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;When the tumult and the shouting die, when the bands are gone and the lights are dimmed, there is the stark reality of responsibility in an hour of history haunted with those gaunt, grim specters of strife, dissension, and materialism at home, and ruthless, inscrutable, and hostile power abroad. The ordeal of the twentieth century\u00a0\u2013 the bloodiest, most turbulent age of the Christian era\u00a0\u2013 is far from over. Sacrifice, patience, understanding, and implacable purpose may be our lot for years to come. ... Let's talk sense to the American people! Let's tell them the truth, that there are no gains without pains, that we are now on the eve of great decisions.\nAlthough Stevenson's eloquent oratory and thoughtful, stylish demeanor impressed many intellectuals, journalists, political commentators, and members of the nation's academic community, the Republicans and some working-class Democrats ridiculed what they perceived as his indecisive, aristocratic air. During the 1952 campaign Stewart Alsop, a powerful Connecticut Republican, labeled Stevenson an \"egghead\", based on his baldness and intellectual air. His brother, the influential newspaper columnist Joe Alsop, used the word to underscore Stevenson's difficulty in attracting working-class voters, and the nickname stuck. Stevenson himself made fun of his \"egghead\" nickname; in one speech he joked \"eggheads of the world unite, you have nothing to lose but your yolks!\" In his campaign speeches Stevenson strongly criticized the Communist-hunting tactics of Senator Joseph McCarthy, labeling \"McCarthy's kind of patriotism\" as \"a disgrace\" and ridiculing right-wing Republicans \"who hunt Communists in the Bureau of Wildlife and Fisheries while hesitating to aid the gallant men and women who are resisting the real thing in the front lines of Europe and Asia...they are finally the men who seemingly believe that we can confound the Kremlin by frightening ourselves to death.\" In return, Senator McCarthy stated in a speech that \"he would like to get on the Stevenson campaign trail with a club and thereby make a good and loyal American out of the governor\".\nIn the 1952 campaign, Stevenson also developed a strong dislike for Richard M. Nixon, then the GOP vice-presidential candidate. \"Adlai literally loathed Nixon. No other person aroused such disgust; not even Joseph McCarthy...Friends who often wished he could be more of a hater were awed at the strength of his distaste for Nixon.\" A biographer wrote that \"for Stevenson, Nixon was an ambitious, unprincipled partisan who craved winning, the exact personification of what was wrong with modern American politics...[for Stevenson] Nixon was an entirely plastic politician...Nixon was Stevenson's complete villain. Others sensed the potential for immorality that led to Nixon's humiliating resignation in 1974, but Stevenson was among the first.\" During the 1952 campaign Stevenson often used his wit to attack Nixon, and once stated that Nixon \"was the kind of politician who would cut down a redwood tree, and then mount the stump and make a speech for [tree] conservation\".\nJournalist David Halberstam later wrote that \"Stevenson [was] an elegant campaigner who raised the political discourse\" and that in 1952 \"Stevenson reinvigorated [the Democratic Party] and made it seem an open and exciting place for a generation of younger Americans who might otherwise never have thought of working for a political candidate.\" During the campaign, a photograph revealed a hole in the sole of Stevenson's right shoe. This became a symbol of Stevenson's frugality and earthiness. The Eisenhower campaign attempted to use the symbol of the shoe with a hole to criticize Stevenson in advertising, to which Stevenson said, \u201cBetter a hole in the shoe than a hole in the head.\u201d Photographer William M. Gallagher of the \"Flint Journal\" won the 1953 Pulitzer Prize on the strength of the image.\nStevenson did not use television as effectively as his Republican opponent, war hero Dwight D. Eisenhower, and was unable to rally the New Deal voting coalition for one last hurrah. Historian Richard Aldous wrote \"Occasionally persuasive, [Stevenson] was rarely compelling and, unlike Eisenhower, he lacked any kind of rapport or common touch with large crowds. He also failed to respond quickly enough to Eisenhower's pioneering use of TV. Both candidates resisted the new medium at first, but Ike relented sooner. He used \"Mad Men\" advertising executive Rosser Reeves of the Ted Bates agency to create brilliant thirty-second TV spots. Ironically, Stevenson came across well on TV, but his arrogant nature caused him to minimize it in the campaign. \"This is the worst thing I've ever heard of,\" he scoffed, \"selling the presidency like breakfast cereal!\" That attitude left him behind the curve.\" On election day, Eisenhower won the national popular vote by 55% to 45%. Stevenson lost heavily outside the Solid South; he carried only nine states and lost the Electoral College vote 442 to 89. In his concession speech on election night, Stevenson said: \"Someone asked me...how I felt, and I was reminded of a story that a fellow townsman of ours used to tell \u2013 Abraham Lincoln. He said he felt like the little boy who had stubbed his toe in the dark. He said that he was too old to cry, but it hurt too much to laugh.\"\nBiographer Jean H. Baker summarized Stevenson's 1952 campaign: \"Uncomfortable with the carnival side of elections, Stevenson tried to be a man for the people, not of them; a man of reason talking sense, not manipulation or sentiment.\" She continued:Liberals...were attracted to the Illinois governor because he firmly opposed McCarthyism, [and] they also appreciated Stevenson because of his style...he had clearly dissociated himself, as did many Americans, from the plebians. Stevenson dramatized the complex feelings of educated elites, some of whom came to adore him not because he was a liberal, but because he was not...he spoke a language that set apart from average Americans an increasingly college-educated population. His approach to voters as rational participants in a process that depended on weighing the issues attracted reformers, intellectuals, and middle-class women with time and money (the \"Shakespeare vote\", joked one columnist). Or as one enthralled voter wrote \"You were too good for the American people ... Adlai Stevenson ended the 1952 campaign with an adoring group of Stevensonites. Articulate and loyal...they would soon create the Stevenson legend and make the Man from Libertyville a counterhero to President Eisenhower, whom they would portray as inept and banal.\"\n1953 World Tour and 1954 elections.\nFollowing his defeat, Stevenson in 1953 made a well-publicized world tour through Asia, the Middle East and Europe, writing about his travels for \"Look\" magazine. His political stature as head of the Democratic Party gave him access to many foreign leaders and dignitaries. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1953. In the 1954 off-year elections, Stevenson took a leading role in campaigning for Democratic congressional and gubernatorial candidates around the nation. When the Democrats won control of both houses of Congress and picked up nine gubernatorial seats it \"put Democrats around the country in Stevenson's debt and greatly strengthened his position as his party's leader.\"\n1956 Presidential election.\nUnlike 1952, Stevenson was an announced, active candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1956. Initially, with polls showing Eisenhower headed for a landslide re-election, few Democrats wanted the 1956 nomination, and Stevenson hoped that he could win the nomination without a serious contest, and without entering any presidential primaries. However, on September 24, 1955, Eisenhower suffered a serious heart attack. Although he recovered and eventually decided to run for a second term, concerns about his health led two prominent Democrats, Tennessee Senator Estes Kefauver and New York Governor Averell Harriman, to decide to challenge Stevenson for the Democratic nomination. After being told by his aides that he needed to enter and win several presidential primaries to defeat Kefauver and Harriman, Stevenson officially entered the race on November 16, 1955, and campaigned in the Minnesota, Florida, and California primaries. Stevenson was upset in the Minnesota primary by Kefauver, who successfully portrayed him as a \"captive\" of corrupt Chicago political bosses and \"a corporation lawyer out of step with regular Democrats\". Stevenson next battled Kefauver in the Florida primary, where he agreed to debate Kefauver on radio and television. Stevenson later joked that in Florida he had appealed to the state's citrus farmers by \"bitterly denouncing the Japanese beetle and fearlessly attacking the Mediterranean fruit fly\". He narrowly defeated Kefauver in Florida by 12,000 votes, and then won the California primary over Kefauver with 63% of the vote, effectively ending Kefauver's presidential bid.\nAt the 1956 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, former President Truman endorsed Governor Harriman, to Stevenson's dismay, but the blow was softened by former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt's continued enthusiastic support. Stevenson easily defeated Harriman on the first ballot, winning his second Democratic presidential nomination. He was aided by strong support from younger delegates, who were said to form the core of the \"New Politics\" movement. In a bid to raise enthusiasm for the Democratic ticket, Stevenson made the unusual decision to leave the selection of his running mate up to the convention delegates. This set off a frantic scramble among several prominent Democrats to win the vice-presidential nomination, including Kefauver, Senator Hubert Humphrey, and Senator John F. Kennedy. After fending off a surprisingly strong challenge from Kennedy, Kefauver narrowly won the vice-presidential nomination on the second ballot. In his acceptance speech, Stevenson spoke of his plan for a \"New America\", which included extending New Deal programs to \"areas of education, health, and poverty\". He also criticized Republicans for trying to \"merchandise candidates like breakfast cereal\".\nFollowing his nomination, Stevenson waged a vigorous presidential campaign, delivering 300 speeches and traveling ; he crisscrossed the nation three times before the election in November. Robert F. Kennedy traveled with the Stevenson campaign, hoping to \"take home some lessons on how to manage a presidential campaign\". Kennedy was deeply disillusioned by Stevenson's campaign, later saying that \"I thought it was ghastly. It was poorly organized...my feeling was that he had no rapport with his audience \u2013 no comprehension of what campaigning required, no ability to make decisions...In 1952 I had been crazy about him...Then I spent six weeks with him on the campaign and he destroyed it all.\" Kennedy voted for Eisenhower in November. For their part, Stevenson and many of his aides resented Kennedy's attitude during his stay with the campaign; Stevenson friend and aide George W. Ball recalled \"My impression was that Bobby was a very surly and arrogant young man...he wasn't doing any good for Adlai. I don't know why we had him along.\" The tension that developed between Stevenson and Robert Kennedy would have significant consequences for the 1960 presidential campaign, and for Stevenson's relationships with both John and Robert Kennedy during President Kennedy's administration.\nAgainst the advice of many of his political advisers, Stevenson insisted on calling for an international ban to aboveground nuclear weapons tests, and for an end to the military draft. Despite strong criticism from President Eisenhower and other leading Republicans, such as Vice President Nixon and former New York Governor Thomas Dewey, that his proposals were na\u00efve and would benefit the Soviet Union in the Cold War, Stevenson held his ground and said in various speeches that \"Earth's atmosphere is contaminated from week to week by exploding hydrogen bombs...We don't want to live forever in the shadow of a radioactive mushroom cloud... [and] growing children are the principal potential sufferers\" of increased strontium 90 in the atmosphere. In the end, Stevenson's push to ban atmospheric nuclear bomb tests \"cost him dearly in votes,\" but \"Adlai finally won the verdict,\" as Eisenhower suspended above-ground nuclear tests in 1958, President Kennedy would sign the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty into law in 1963, and President Nixon would end the military draft in 1973.\nCivil rights was emerging rapidly as a major political issue. Stevenson urged caution and warned against aggressive enforcement of the Supreme Court's decision in \"Brown v. Board of Education\" in order to gain Southern white support. Kotlowski writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Liberal Democrats, too, flinched before Brown. Adlai E. Stevenson, front-runner for the party's presidential nomination in 1956, urged the government to \"proceed gradually\" on school desegregation in deference to the South's long-held \"traditions\". Stevenson backed integration but opposed using armed personnel to enforce Brown... It certainly helped. Stevenson carried most of Dixie in the fall campaign but received just 61 percent of the black vote, low for a Democrat, and lost the election to Eisenhower by a landslide.\nStevenson's views on racial progress were described after his death by his long-time companion Marietta Tree as: \"He thought of all Negroes as being loveable old family retainers and not as individuals like you and me who were longing to get educated and who had aspirations and dreams just like the rest of us. I think this took him a long time to get over--the fact that they really indeed not only were created equal; they wanted equality of opportunity and wanted it now. It was hard for him to understand the urgency.\"\nWhile President Eisenhower suffered heart problems, the economy enjoyed robust health. Stevenson's hopes for victory were dashed when, in October, Eisenhower's doctors gave him a clean bill of health and the Suez and Hungary crises erupted simultaneously. The public was not convinced that a change in leadership was needed. Stevenson lost his second bid for the presidency by a landslide, winning only 42% of the popular vote and 73 electoral votes from just seven states, all except Missouri in the solid Democratic South.\nEarly in 1957, Stevenson resumed law practice and allied himself with Judge Simon H. Rifkind to create a law firm based in Washington, DC. (Stevenson, Paul, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison), and a second firm in Chicago (Stevenson, Rifkind &amp; Wirtz). Both law firms were related to New York City's Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison. Stevenson's associates in the new law firm included Willard Wirtz, William McCormick Blair Jr., and Newton N. Minow; each of these men later served in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations. He also accepted an appointment, along with other prominent Democrats, to the new Democratic Advisory Council, which \"pursued an aggressive line in attacking the [Republican] Eisenhower administration and in developing new Democratic policies\". He was also employed part-time by the \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\" as a legal consultant.\n1960 Presidential election.\nIn early 1960, Stevenson announced that he would not seek a third Democratic presidential nomination, but would accept a draft. One of his closest friends told a journalist that \"Deep down, he wants [the Democratic nomination]. But he wants the [Democratic] Convention to come to him, he doesn't want to go to the Convention.\" In May 1960, Senator John F. Kennedy, who was actively campaigning for the Democratic nomination, visited Stevenson at his Libertyville home. Kennedy asked Stevenson for a public endorsement of his candidacy; in exchange Kennedy promised, if elected, to appoint Stevenson as his Secretary of State. Stevenson turned down the offer, which strained relations between the two men. At the 1960 Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, Stevenson's admirers, led by Eleanor Roosevelt, Agnes Meyer, and such Hollywood celebrities as Dore Schary and Henry Fonda, vigorously promoted him for the nomination, even though he was not an announced candidate. JFK's campaign manager, his brother Robert F. Kennedy, reportedly threatened Stevenson in a meeting, telling him that unless he agreed to place his brother's name in nomination \"you are through\". Stevenson refused and ordered him out of his hotel room. In letters to friends, Stevenson described both John and Robert Kennedy as \"cold and ruthless\", referred to Robert Kennedy as the \"Black Prince\", and expressed his belief that JFK, \"though bright and able, was too young, too unseasoned, to be President; he pushed too hard, was in too much of a hurry; he lacked the wisdom of humility...[Stevenson felt] that both Kennedy and the nation would benefit from a postponement of his ambition.\"\nThe night before the balloting, Stevenson began working actively for the nomination, calling the leaders of several state delegations to ask for their support. The key call went to Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley, the leader of the Illinois delegation. The delegation had already voted to give Kennedy 59.5 votes to Stevenson's 2, but Stevenson told Daley that he now wanted the Democratic nomination, and asked him if the \"delegates' vote might merely indicate they thought he was not a candidate\". Daley told Stevenson that he had no support in the delegation. Stevenson then \"asked if this meant no support in fact or no support because the delegates thought he was not a candidate. Daley replied that Stevenson had no support.\" According to Stevenson's biographer John Bartlow Martin, the phone conversation with Daley \"was the real end of the [1960] Stevenson candidacy...if he could not get the support of his home state his candidacy was doomed\". However, Stevenson continued to work for the nomination the next day, fulfilling what he felt were obligations to old friends and supporters such as Eleanor Roosevelt and Agnes Meyer. Senator Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota delivered an impassioned nominating speech for Stevenson, urging the convention to not \"reject the man who has made us proud to be Democrats. Do not leave this prophet without honor in his own party.\" However, Kennedy won the nomination on the first ballot with 806 delegate votes; Stevenson finished in fourth place with 79.5 votes.\nAmbassador to the United Nations.\nOnce Kennedy won the nomination, Stevenson, always an enormously popular public speaker, campaigned actively for him. Due to his two presidential nominations and previous United Nations experience, Stevenson perceived himself an elder statesman and the natural choice for Secretary of State. However, according to historian Robert Dallek, \"neither Jack nor Bobby [Kennedy] thought all that well of Stevenson...they saw him as rather prissy and ineffective. [Stevenson] never met their standard of tough-mindedness.\" Stevenson's refusal to publicly endorse Kennedy before the Democratic Convention was something that Kennedy \"couldn't forgive\", with JFK telling a Stevenson supporter after the election, \"I'm not going to give him anything.\" The prestigious post of Secretary of State went instead to the (then) little-known Dean Rusk. However, \"although Jack and Bobby would have been just as happy to freeze Stevenson out of the administration, they felt compelled to offer him something\" due to his continued support from progressive Democrats. President Kennedy offered Stevenson the choice of becoming ambassador to Britain, attorney general (a post that eventually went to Robert Kennedy), or United States Ambassador to the United Nations. Stevenson accepted the UN position.\nMany years later, it was revealed that during the campaign Stevenson was approached by Soviet ambassador Mikhail A. Menshikov, who offered Soviet financial and public relations help to assist him in getting elected if he decided to run. Stevenson flatly rejected the Soviet offer, telling Menshikov that he \"considered the offer of such assistance highly improper, indiscreet and dangerous to all concerned\". Stevenson then reported the incident directly to President Eisenhower.\nAt the United Nations, Stevenson worked hard to support U.S. foreign policy, even when he personally disagreed with some of President Kennedy's actions. However, he was often seen as an outsider in the Kennedy administration, with one historian noting \"everyone knew that Stevenson's position was that of a bit player\". Kennedy told his adviser Walt Rostow that \"Stevenson wouldn't be happy as president. He thinks that if you talk long enough you get a soft option and there are very few soft options as president.\"\nBay of Pigs incident.\nIn April 1961 Stevenson suffered the greatest humiliation of his diplomatic career in the Bay of Pigs invasion. After hearing rumors that \"a lot of refugees wanted to go back and overthrow Castro\", Stevenson voiced his skepticism about an invasion, but \"he was kept on the fringes of the operation, receiving...nine days before the invasion, only an unduly vague briefing by Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.\" and the CIA. Senior CIA official Tracy Barnes told Stevenson and his staff that \"there was going to be a clandestine operation in Cuba...it was strictly a Cuban affair. It would have some American cooperation, but only with the training and financing.\" According to historian Peter Wyden, Barnes did not tell Stevenson that there would be a large-scale invasion of Cuba, nor did he provide details about the full extent of American support for, and involvement with, the Cuban rebels, nor did he tell Stevenson about the planned air strikes to destroy Castro's air force. Kennedy Library historian Sheldon Stern interviewed Ambassador Charles W. Yost, Stevenson's deputy, who attended the meeting and confirmed that Yost had been suspicious of the story from the start. Yost agreed that this was another one of the CIA's \"clumsy tricks\". Assistant Secretary of State Harlan Cleveland, who attended the briefing, felt that Barnes was too evasive in his description of the operation, and that it was clear that Stevenson was not to be given the full details of the invasion plan. Historian Garry Wills has written that \"news of the invasion was leaking out...Castro knew the landings would occur; only Adlai Stevenson was kept in the dark\" about the invasion by President Kennedy and his aides.\nKennedy, anticipating that Stevenson might be angered at being left out of the discussions over whether to invade Cuba, told Schlesinger that \"the integrity and credibility of Adlai Stevenson constitute one of our great national assets. I don't want to do anything to jeopardize that\", and he asked Schlesinger to let Stevenson know that the president was shielding him from many of the details to protect him in case the clandestine operation failed. Instead, as Robert Dallek has written, \"by leaving him out of the discussion it led to his humiliation\". Unaware that the anti-Castro Cuban exiles landing at the Bay of Pigs were being armed and assisted directly by the CIA and US Navy, and that American pilots were participating in bombing raids of Cuban targets, Stevenson unwittingly \"repeated a CIA cover story in a speech before the UN General Assembly\". He argued that the rebels were not assisted in any way by the U.S. government; when this claim was proven to be false Stevenson complained that \"I took this job on the understanding that I would be consulted and kept fully informed on everything. Now my credibility has been compromised and therefore my usefulness.\" When he told his friend Harlan Cleveland that his own government had \"deliberately tricked\" him into believing there was no direct American involvement in the invasion, Cleveland replied \"I feel as betrayed as you do.\" Stevenson seriously considered resigning, but was convinced by his friends and President Kennedy to stay.\nCuban Missile Crisis.\nDuring the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, Stevenson gave a presentation at an emergency session of the Security Council. In his presentation, which attracted national television coverage, he forcefully asked Soviet UN representative Valerian Zorin if his country was installing nuclear missiles in Cuba, and when Zorin appeared reluctant to reply, Stevenson punctuated with the demand \"Don't wait for the translation, [answer] 'yes' or 'no'!\" When Zorin replied that \"I am not in an American court of law, and therefore do not answer a question put to me in the manner of a prosecuting counsel...you will have your answer in due course\", Stevenson retorted, \"I am prepared to wait for my answer until Hell freezes over.\" Stevenson then showed photographs taken by a U-2 spy plane which proved the existence of nuclear missiles in Cuba, just after Zorin had implied they did not exist.\nStevenson also attended several meetings of the EXCOMM at the White House during the Missile Crisis, where he boldly proposed to make an exchange with the Soviets: if they would remove their missiles from Cuba, the United States would agree to remove its obsolete Jupiter missiles from Turkey. However, he faced strong opposition from some other EXCOMM members, who regarded such an exchange as a sign of weakness. According to Kennedy adviser and Stevenson friend George W. Ball, who was present, these members \"intemperately upbraided Stevenson...[and were] outraged and shrill\". However, President Kennedy remarked \"You have to admire Adlai, he sticks to his position even when everyone is jumping on him\", and Robert Kennedy wrote that \"Stevenson has since been criticized for the position he took at the meeting...although I disagreed strongly with his recommendations, I thought he was courageous to make them, and I might add that they made as much sense as some others considered during that period of time.\" Stevenson remarked \"I know that most of those fellows will consider me a coward for the rest of my life for what I said today, but perhaps we need a coward in the room when we are talking about nuclear war.\" In fact, the Kennedy Administration did remove the Jupiter-class MRBMs from Italy and Turkey some six months after the Cuban Missile Crisis ended, and there is evidence that President Kennedy privately agreed that, if the Soviets would remove their missiles from Cuba, he would remove the Jupiter missiles from Turkey and Italy at a later date. The deal was kept a secret for many years, however, and Stevenson was thus given no credit for his original suggestion.\nIn December 1962 journalists Stewart Alsop and Charles Bartlett published an article about the Missile Crisis in the \"Saturday Evening Post.\" The article quoted a \"non-admiring official\" who claimed that Stevenson \"Wanted a Munich. He wanted to trade U.S. bases for Cuban bases\" and generally portrayed Stevenson's behavior and actions during the Missile Crisis as weak and inept. Stevenson was deeply angered by the article, especially as it was widely believed that the \"non-admiring\" official who criticized Stevenson was President Kennedy himself \u2013 \"Kennedy had fed the Stevenson story to Alsop and Bartlett, partly because it enabled him to look strong\" in comparison to Stevenson. However, a number of Stevenson's friends and supporters, such as historian and White House aide Arthur Schlesinger Jr., came to Stevenson's defense. Schlesinger told Kennedy \"The suggestion in the Alsop-Bartlett story that Stevenson favored a Caribbean Munich is grossly unfair and shows the number of people who still have their knives out for him.\" Stevenson, knowing that Bartlett was a close friend of President Kennedy, assumed that the article had been written with Kennedy's permission and let the president know through friends that if Kennedy had wanted him to resign, \"he did not have to go about it in such a roundabout fashion.\" Kennedy told Stevenson that he did not want him to resign and had his Press Secretary, Pierre Salinger, release a letter to the press praising Stevenson's performance during the Missile Crisis. Although the letter did \"cause the public furor to die down... for months Washington continued to buzz over what everyone saw as an effort to force Adlai's resignation\", and Stevenson friend George Ball later said that the \"injury inflicted by the magazine article lingered on and on... After the Cuban Missile Crisis, Adlai was only going through the motions. From then on, he knew he was not going to have an impact on foreign policy.\"\nKennedy assassination and Vietnam War.\nDuring his time as UN ambassador, Stevenson often traveled around the country promoting the United Nations in speeches and seminars. On these trips, he frequently faced opposition and protests from groups skeptical of the United Nations, such as the right-wing John Birch Society. On October 25, 1963, Stevenson spoke in Dallas, Texas, where he was heckled and spat upon by unruly protestors led by retired General Edwin Walker's \"National Indignation Convention\". At one point a woman hit Stevenson on the head with a sign, leading Stevenson to remark \"is she animal or human?\", and telling a policeman \"I don't want her to go to jail, I want her to go to school.\" Afterwards, Stevenson warned President Kennedy's advisers about the \"ugly and frightening\" mood he had found in Dallas, but he did not discuss his concerns directly with Kennedy before the president's visit to Texas in late November 1963. On November 22, Stevenson was attending a luncheon held by the Chilean ambassador when he was informed that Kennedy had been shot in Dallas. He told friends and aides \"That Dallas! Why, why, didn't I insist that he not go there?\"\nAfter President Kennedy was assassinated, Stevenson continued to serve in his position as ambassador to the UN under President Lyndon Johnson. As the country moved toward the 1964 presidential election, the war in Vietnam became an important campaign issue. The Republican presidential candidate, Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater, advocated victory in Vietnam\u2014a rollback strategy that Johnson denounced as tantamount to nuclear war. Stevenson was not a major player on the Vietnam issue. He did support Johnson publicly and in private because he believed in the containment of communism, but he also wanted to start negotiations with North Vietnam through the United Nations, which Johnson rejected.\nDeath and legacy.\nIn July 1965, Stevenson traveled to Geneva, Switzerland, to attend the annual meeting of the United Nations Economic and Social Council. After the conference he stopped in London for several days, where he visited UK Prime Minister Harold Wilson, discussed the situation in South Vietnam with British officials, and was interviewed by CBS newsman Eric Sevareid. On the afternoon of July 14, while walking in London with his aide and girlfriend Marietta Tree to Grosvenor Square, Stevenson suffered a massive heart attack, and died later that day at age 65 of heart failure at St\u00a0George's\u00a0Hospital. Marietta Tree recalled:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;As we were walking along the street he said do not walk quite so fast and do hold your head up Marietta. I was burrowing ahead trying to get to the park as quickly as possible and then the next thing I knew, I turned around and I saw he'd gone white, gray really, and he fell and his hand brushed me as he fell and he hit the pavement with the most terrible crack and I thought he'd fractured his skull.\nThat night in her diary, she wrote, \"Adlai is dead. We were together.\" Following memorial services at the United Nations General Assembly Hall (on July 19, 1965), and in Washington, D.C.; Springfield, Illinois; and Bloomington, Illinois, Stevenson was interred in the family plot in Evergreen Cemetery, Bloomington, Illinois. The funeral in Bloomington's Unitarian Church was attended by many national figures, including President Lyndon B. Johnson, Vice President Hubert Humphrey, and Chief Justice Earl Warren.\nHistorian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., who served as one of his speechwriters, described Stevenson as a \"great creative figure in American politics. He turned the Democratic Party around in the fifties and made JFK possible...to the United States and the world he was the voice of a reasonable, civilized, and elevated America. He brought a new generation into politics, and moved millions of people in the United States and around the world.\"\nJournalist David Halberstam wrote that \"Stevenson's gift to the nation was his language, elegant and well-crafted, thoughtful and calming.\" His biographer Jean H. Baker stated that Stevenson's memory \"still survives...as an expression of a different kind of politics \u2013 nobler, more issue-oriented, less compliant to the greedy ambitions of modern politicians, and less driven by public opinion polls and the media.\"\nW. Willard Wirtz, his friend and law partner, once said \"If the Electoral College ever gives an honorary degree, it should go to Adlai Stevenson.\"\nHalberstam wrote of Stevenson that\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;he had played a historic role for his party, twice its presidential candidate, the first time running against impossible odds in 1952, at the height of the Korean War and McCarthyism, with the [Democratic] party already decaying from the scandals of twenty years in power. Running against the great hero of the era, Dwight Eisenhower, Stevenson had lost, of course, but his voice had seemed special in that moment, a voice of rationality and elegance. In the process of defeat, he had helped to salvage the party, giving it a new vitality and bringing to its fold a whole new generation of educated Americans, volunteers now in the political process, some very professional amateurs who would be masterly used by the Kennedys in 1960. If John and Robert Kennedy seemed to symbolize style in politics, much of that was derived directly from Stevenson. He had, at what should have been a particularly low point for the party, managed to keep it vibrant and vital, and to involve a new kind of people in politics.\nHis biographer Jean H. Baker wrote of Stevenson's two presidential campaigns in 1952 and 1956 that \"what would be remembered...were not his public programs and ideas for a New America but, ironically, the private man \u2013 his character and personality, his wit and charm, his efforts to negotiate and keep the peace within the Democratic Party, his elegant speeches, and the grace with which he accepted defeat.\"\nThe Central Illinois Regional Airport near Bloomington has a whimsical statue of Stevenson, sitting on a bench with his feet propped on his briefcase and his head in one hand, as if waiting for his flight. He is depicted wearing shoes that had a hole in the sole, from having walked many miles during his election campaign. The shoe had become a symbol of his campaign.\nThe Adlai E. Stevenson II Farm in Mettawa, Illinois, which was Stevenson's home from 1936 to 1965, is on the National Register of Historic Places and has been designated a National Historic Landmark.\nAdlai Stevenson II was inducted as a Laureate of The Lincoln Academy of Illinois and awarded the Order of Lincoln (the state's highest honor) by the governor of Illinois in 1965 in the area of government.\nIn October 1965, the United States Post Office Department issued a 5 cent stamp in Bloomington, Illinois, to commemorate the life of Stevenson.\nStevenson in popular culture.\nIn film and television.\nStevenson has been referenced in television episodes of \"The Simpsons\" in the episodes \"Lisa the Iconoclast\" and \"The Secret War of Lisa Simpson\" (appearing in the latter in an educational film, with Harry Shearer providing the cartoon Stevenson's voice. In the former, a gag occurs, as the mob of Springfielders exhume the corpse of Jedediah, Willie mistakenly throws dirt over the flame of a candle vigil set in front of Adlai's grave).\nHe has also been referenced in \"The Golden Girls\", \"Happy Days\" (in the January 28, 1975, episode \"The Not Making of the President\") and \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\"'s presentation of \"\" (a Stevenson lookalike buys a car and one of the MST3K characters comments on it). Murphy Brown briefly names her newborn son 'Adlai Stevenson'. He was also mentioned in \"The West Wing\" (Arnold Vinick compares himself to Stevenson, the latter having been nominated twice to run for president)\nStevenson has also been referenced in films. Peter Sellers claimed that his portrayal of President Merkin Muffley in ' was modeled on Stevenson. Stevenson's \"\" speech to Russian ambassador Valerian Zorin during the Cuban Missile Crisis inspired dialogue in a courtroom scene in '. The historical speech itself is depicted in the 2000 film \"Thirteen Days\" with Michael Fairman playing Stevenson, as well as partially depicted in the 1974 television play \"The Missiles of October\" by Ralph Bellamy. Stevenson is also referenced in \"Wayne's World 2\" (\"Waynestock\" is held in an Aurora, Illinois, park named for Stevenson), \"Plain Clothes\" (the high school is named for Stevenson), \"Annie Hall\" (Woody Allen's character tells a standup joke about the Stevenson-Eisenhower campaign) and \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\". Stevenson also appears in \"A Global Affair\" credited as himself.\nIn \"Pioneer One\", a crowd-financed TV series published under a Creative Commons license, one of the characters introduces himself as \"Adlai Steve DiLeo\", named after Adlai Stevenson, \"someone who ran three times for president unsuccessfully\".\nIn a parallel universe featured in the \"Sliders\" episode \"The Return of Maggie Beckett\", the German Wehrmacht breaks through the Allied lines in the Battle of the Bulge in 1944, which causes World War II to drag on until 1947. General Eisenhower is relieved as the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Europe and returns to the United States in disgrace. Consequently, Stevenson becomes president. The Stevenson administration makes the Roswell UFO incident in July 1947 public knowledge and signs the Reticulan-American Free Trade Agreement (RAFTA), giving the US access to advanced Reticulan technology. This leads to a human mission to Mars in the 1990s.\nIn the 2016 movie \"Bogie and Bacall\", Stevenson was portrayed by actor Ryan Paevey.\nIn other media.\nThe writer Gore Vidal, who admired and supported Stevenson, based a main character in his 1960 Broadway play \"The Best Man\" on Stevenson. The play, which was nominated for six Tony Awards, centers on the contest for the presidential nomination at a fictitious political convention. One of the main contenders for the nomination is Secretary of State William Russell, a principled, liberal intellectual. The character is based on Stevenson; his main opponent is the ruthless, unscrupulous Senator Joseph Cantwell, whom Vidal modeled on Richard Nixon and the Kennedy brothers. The play was turned into a 1964 film of the same name, with actor Henry Fonda playing Russell. Fonda had been a Stevenson supporter at the 1960 Democratic National Convention.\n\"\", a 2006 album by Sufjan Stevens of songs about the state of Illinois, contains a song called \"Adlai Stevenson\". Stevenson's speech to the UN during the midst of the Cuban Missile Crises plays a minor but important role in Stephen King's 2011 time-travel novel \"11/22/63\".\nThings named after Stevenson.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nElectoral history.\nGubernatorial.\n1948"}
{"id": "52738", "revid": "36336112", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52738", "title": "C\u00e1diz", "text": "Municipality in Andalusia, Spain\nC\u00e1diz ( , , ) is a city in Spain and the capital of the Province of C\u00e1diz in the autonomous community of Andalusia. It is located in the southwest of the Iberian Peninsula off the Atlantic Ocean separated from neighbouring San Fernando by a narrow isthmus. One of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in Western Europe, C\u00e1diz was founded by the Phoenicians as a trading post. In the 18th century, the Port in the Bay of C\u00e1diz consolidated as the main harbour of mainland Spain, enjoying the virtual monopoly of trade with the Americas until 1778. It is also the site of the University of C\u00e1diz.\nSituated on a narrow slice of land surrounded by the sea\u201a C\u00e1diz is, in most respects, a typical Andalusian city with well-preserved historical landmarks. The older part of C\u00e1diz, within the remnants of the city walls, is commonly referred to as the Old Town (), and represents a large area of the total size of the city. It is characterized by the antiquity of its various quarters (), among them , , and , which present a marked contrast to the newer areas of town. While the Old City's street plan consists of narrow winding alleys connecting large plazas, newer areas of C\u00e1diz typically have wide avenues and more modern buildings. The city is dotted with parks where exotic plants flourish, including giant trees supposedly brought to the Iberian Peninsula from the New World. This includes the historic Parque Genov\u00e9s.\nNames and etymology.\nNumismatic inscriptions in the Phoenician language record that the Phoenicians knew the site as or (, ), meaning 'wall', 'compound', or (by metonymy) 'stronghold'. Borrowed by the Berber languages, this became the \"agadir\" (Tamazight for 'wall' and Shilha for 'fortified granary') common in North African place names, such as that of the Moroccan city of Agadir. The Carthaginians continued to use this name and all subsequent names have derived from it.\nAttic Greek sources hellenized \"Gadir\" as (), which is neuter plural. Herodotus, using Ionic Greek, transcribed it a little differently, as (). Rarely, as in Stephanus of Byzantium's notes on the writings of Eratosthenes, is the name given in the feminine singular form as ().\nIn Latin, the city was known as and its Roman colony as ('The August City of Julia of C\u00e1diz'). In Arabic, the Latin name became (), from which the Spanish derives. The Spanish demonym for people and things from C\u00e1diz is .\nThe same root also gives the modern Italian \"C\u00e0dice\", Catalan \"Cadis\", Portuguese \"C\u00e1dis\", and French \"Cadix\", the last also appearing in many English sources before the 20th century.\nThe name \"Cales\", which usually refers to Calais in France, is also used for C\u00e1diz, especially in the context of the 1596 Capture of C\u00e1diz by the British and Dutch, as Thomas Percy notes in his introduction of the ballad \"The Winning of Cales\" (and it is also found in the sarcastic rhyme beginning \"A gentleman of Wales, a knight of Cales\").\nIn English, the name \"C\u00e1diz\", traditionally spelt without the acute accent mark on the \"a\", is pronounced variously. When the accent is on the second syllable, it is usually pronounced but, when the accent is on the first syllable, it may be pronounced as , , , and similar, typically in American English. In Spanish, the accent is always, as according to the spelling, on the first syllable but, while the usual pronunciation in Spain is , the local dialect says or even instead.\nHistory.\nFoundation and early history under the Phoenicians.\nFounded as \"Gadir\" or \"Agadir\" by Phoenicians from Tyre, C\u00e1diz is often regarded as the most ancient city still standing in Western Europe. The city was an important trading hub founded to access different metals including gold, tin, and especially silver. The Phoenicians established a port in the 7th century\u00a0BC.\nTraditionally, C\u00e1diz's founding is dated to c. 1100 BC, although no archaeological strata on the site can be dated earlier than the 9th century BC. One resolution for this discrepancy has been to assume that Gadir was merely a small seasonal trading post in its earliest days.\nAncient Gadir occupied two small islands\u2014Erytheia, primarily a settlement, and Kotinoussa, hosting cemeteries and sanctuaries outside the urban area\u2014situated near the mouth of River Guadalete. Presently, these islands are interconnected. While the ancient ruins of Gadir beneath modern C\u00e1diz's historical center remain largely unexcavated, excavations have been carried out in the southern cemeteries.\nBy the 6th century BC, disturbances within Phoenicia itself, notably the fall of Tyre to the Babylonians (573 BC), led to the end of Phoenician control over southern Iberia. This vacuum was later filled by ancient Carthage, which rose as a predominant power in the region during subsequent eras.\nPart of the Carthaginian Empire.\nThe expeditions of Himilco around Spain and France and of Hanno around Western Africa began there. The Phoenician settlement traded with Tartessos, a city-state whose exact location remains unknown but is thought to have been somewhere near the mouth of the Guadalquivir River.\nOne of the city's notable features during antiquity was the temple on the south end of its island dedicated to the Phoenician god Melqart, who was conflated with Hercules by the Greeks and Romans under the names \"Tyrian Hercules\" and \"Hercules Gaditanus\". It had an oracle and was famed for its wealth. In Greek mythology, Hercules was sometimes credited with founding \"Gadeira\" after performing his tenth labor, the slaying of Geryon, a monster with three heads and torsos joined to a single pair of legs. (A tumulus near Gadeira was associated with Geryon's final resting-place.) According to the \"Life of Apollonius of Tyana\", the \"Heracleum\" (i.e., the temple of Melqart) was still standing during the 1st century. Some historians, based in part on this source, believe that the columns of this temple were the origin of the myth of the \"pillars of Hercules\".\nThe city fell under the sway of Carthage during Hamilcar Barca's Iberian campaign after the First Punic War. C\u00e1diz became a depot for Hannibal's conquest of southern Iberia, and he sacrificed there to Hercules/Melqart before setting off on his famous journey in 218\u00a0BC to cross the Alps and invade Italy. Later the city fell to Romans under Scipio Africanus in 206\u00a0BC.\nUnder Rome's rule.\nUnder the Roman Republic and Empire, the city flourished as a port and naval base known as \"Gades\". Suetonius relates how Julius Caesar, when visiting Gades as a quaestor (junior senator), saw a statue of Alexander the Great there and was saddened to think that he himself, though the same age, had still achieved nothing memorable.\nThe people of Gades had an alliance with Rome and Julius Caesar bestowed Roman citizenship on all its inhabitants in 49\u00a0BC. By the time of Augustus's census, C\u00e1diz was home to more than five hundred \"equites\" (members of the wealthy upper class), a concentration rivaled only by Patavium (Padua) and Rome itself. It was the principal city of the Roman colony of Augusta Urbs Julia Gaditana. An aqueduct provided fresh water to the town, the island's supply being poor, running across open sea for its last leg. However, Roman Gades was never very large. It consisted only of the northwest corner of the present island, and most of its wealthy citizens maintained estates outside of it on the nearby island or on the mainland. The lifestyle maintained on the estates led to the Gaditan dancing girls (the ) becoming famous throughout the ancient world.\nAlthough it is not in fact the most westerly city in the Spanish peninsula, for the Romans C\u00e1diz had that reputation. The poet Juvenal begins his famous tenth satire with the words: \"Omnibus in terris quae sunt a Gadibus usque Auroram et Gangen\" ('In all the lands which exist from Gades as far as Dawn and the Ganges ...').\nSwitching hands in later antiquity.\nThe overthrow of Roman power in Hispania Baetica by the Visigoths in the AD 400s saw the destruction of the original city, of which few traces remain today. The site was later reconquered by Justinian in 551 as part of the Byzantine province of Spania. It would remain Byzantine until Leovigild's reconquest in 572 returned it to the Visigothic Kingdom.\nAl-Andalus.\nUnder Moorish rule between 711 and 1262, the city was called \"Q\u0101dis\", whence the modern Spanish name was derived. A famous Muslim legend developed concerning an \"idol\" (\"sanam Q\u0101dis\") over 100 cubits tall on the outskirts of C\u00e1diz whose magic blocked the strait of Gibraltar with contrary winds and currents; its destruction by Abd-al-Mumin c.\u20091145 supposedly permitted ships to sail through the strait once more. It also appeared (as \"Salamcadis\") in the 12th-century Pseudo-Turpin's history of Charlemagne, where it was considered a statue of Muhammad and thought to warn the Muslims of Christian invasion. Classical sources are entirely silent on such a structure, but it has been conjectured that the origin of the legend was the ruins of a navigational aid constructed in late antiquity. Abd-al-Mumin (or Admiral Ali ibn-Isa ibn-Maymun) found that the idol was gilded bronze rather than pure gold, but coined what there was to help fund his revolt. In 1217, according to the \"De itinere Frisonum\" the city was raided by a group of Frisian crusaders en route to the Holy Land who burned it and destroyed its congregational mosque. The Moors were ousted by Alphonso X of Castile in 1262.\nHistorically, there was a Jewish community living in C\u00e1diz under Muslim rule.\nPost-1492.\nDuring the Age of Exploration, the city experienced a renaissance. Christopher Columbus sailed from C\u00e1diz on his second and fourth voyages and the city later became the home port of the Spanish treasure fleet. Consequently, it became a major target of Spain's enemies. The 16th century saw a series of failed raids by Barbary corsairs; the greater part of the old town was consumed in a major fire in 1569; and in April 1587 a raid by the Englishman Francis Drake occupied the harbor for three days, captured six ships, and destroyed 31 others (an event which became known in England as the Singeing the King of Spain's Beard. The attack delayed the sailing of the Spanish Armada by a year.\nThe city suffered a still more serious attack in 1596, when it was captured by an Anglo-Dutch fleet, this time under the Earls of Essex and Nottingham. 32 Spanish ships were destroyed and the city was captured, looted and occupied for almost a month. Finally, when the royal authorities refused to pay a ransom demanded by the English for returning the city intact, they burned much of it before leaving with their booty. A third English raid was mounted against the city in 1625 by George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, and Edward Cecil, but the attempt was unsuccessful. During the Anglo-Spanish War, Admiral Robert Blake blockaded C\u00e1diz from 1655 to 1657. In the 1702 Battle of C\u00e1diz, the English attacked again under George Rooke and James Butler, 2nd Duke of Ormonde, but they were repelled after a costly siege.\nIn the 18th century, the sand bars of the Guadalquivir forced the Spanish government to transfer its American trade from Seville to C\u00e1diz, which now commanded better access to the Atlantic. Although the empire itself was declining, C\u00e1diz now experienced another golden age because of its new importance, and many of today's historic buildings in the Old City date from this era. It became one of Spain's greatest and most cosmopolitan cities and home to trading communities from many countries, chief among which were the French and Anglo-Irish. Irish Catholics were prohibited by the penal laws from owning land or entering a profession in Ireland, whereas in Spain they were as Catholics permitted to trade more freely than the English.\nOn 12 October 1778, the right to trade with the Americas was expanded to most ports of mainland Spain, bringing the monopoly of trade hitherto enjoyed by the Port of the Bay of C\u00e1diz to an end.\nDuring the Napoleonic Wars, C\u00e1diz was blockaded by the British from 1797 until the Peace of Amiens in 1802 and again from 1803 until the outbreak of the Peninsular War in 1808. In that war, it was one of the few Spanish cities to hold out against the invading French and their candidate Joseph Bonaparte. C\u00e1diz then became the seat of Spain's military high command and Cortes (parliament) for the duration of the war. It was here that the liberal Spanish Constitution of 1812 was proclaimed. The citizens revolted in 1820 to secure a renewal of this constitution and the revolution spread successfully until Ferdinand VII was imprisoned in C\u00e1diz. French forces secured the release of Ferdinand in the 1823 Battle of Trocadero and suppressed liberalism for a time. In 1868, C\u00e1diz was once again the seat of a revolution, resulting in the eventual abdication and exile of Queen Isabella II. The Cortes of C\u00e1diz decided to reinstate the monarchy under King Amadeo just two years later.\nIn recent years, the city has undergone much reconstruction. Many monuments, cathedrals, and landmarks have been cleaned and restored.\nDiocese.\nThe diocese of C\u00e1diz and Ceuta is a suffragan of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Seville; that is, it is a diocese within the metropolitan see of Seville. It became a diocese in 1263 after its Reconquista (reconquest) from the Moors. By the Concordat of 1753, in which the Spanish crown also gained the rights to make appointments to church offices and to tax church lands, the Diocese of C\u00e1diz was merged with the Diocese of Ceuta, a Spanish conclave on the northern coast of Africa, and the diocesan bishop became, by virtue of his office, the apostolic administrator of Ceuta.\nMain sights.\nAmong many landmarks of historical and scenic interest is an unusual cathedral of various architectural styles, a theater, an old municipal building, an 18th-century watchtower, a vestige of the ancient city wall, an ancient Roman theater, and electrical pylons of modern design carrying cables across the Bay of C\u00e1diz. The old town is characterized by narrow streets connecting squares (\"plazas\"), bordered by the sea and by the city walls. Most of the landmark buildings are situated in the plazas.\nPlazas and their landmark buildings.\nThe old town of C\u00e1diz is one of the most densely populated urban areas in Europe, and is packed with narrow streets with several plazas. These are the \"Plaza de Mina\", \"Plaza San Antonio\", \"Plaza de Candelaria\", \"Plaza de San Juan de Dios\", and \"Plaza de Espa\u00f1a\".\nPlaza de Mina.\nIn the centre of the old town, the Plaza de Mina was developed in the first half of the 19th century. The land was previously occupied by the orchard of the convent of San Francisco. The area was converted into a plaza in 1838 by the architect Torcuato Benjumeda and (later) Juan Daura, with its trees being planted in 1861. It was then redeveloped again in 1897, and has remained virtually unchanged since that time. It is named after General Francisco Espoz y Mina, a hero of the war of independence. Manuel de Falla y Matheu was born in Number 3 Plaza de Mina, where a plaque bears his name. The plaza also contains several statues, one of these is a bust of Jos\u00e9 Macpherson (a pioneer in the development of petrography, stratigraphy and tectonics) who was born in number 12 Plaza de Mina in 1839. The Museum of C\u00e1diz, is to be found at number 5 Plaza de Mina, and contains many objects from C\u00e1diz's 3000-year history as well as works by artists such as Peter Paul Rubens. The houses which face the plaza, many of which can be classified as neo-classical architecture or built in the style of Isabelline Gothic, were originally occupied by the C\u00e1diz bourgeoisie.\nThe Plaza de la Catedral houses both the Cathedral and the Baroque church of \"Santiago\", built in 1635.\nPlaza de San Francisco and San Francisco Church and Convent.\nLocated next to Plaza de Mina, this smaller square houses the San Francisco church and convent. Originally built in 1566, it was substantially renovated in the 17th century, when its cloisters were added. Originally, the Plaza de Mina formed the convent's orchard.\nPlaza San Antonio.\nIn the 19th century Plaza San Antonio was considered to be C\u00e1diz's main square. The square is surrounded by a number of mansions built in neo-classical architecture or Isabelline Gothic style, once occupied by the C\u00e1diz upper classes. San Antonio church, originally built in 1669, is also situated in the plaza.\nThe plaza was built in the 18th century, and on 19 March 1812 the Spanish Constitution of 1812 was proclaimed here, leading to the plaza to be named Plaza de la Constituci\u00f3n, and then later Plaza San Antonio, after the hermit San Antonio.\nIn 1954 the city's mayor proclaimed the location a historic site. All construction is prohibited.\nPlaza de Candelaria.\nThe Plaza de Candelaria is named after the Candelaria convent, situated in the square until it was demolished in 1873 under the First Spanish Republic, when its grounds were redeveloped as a plaza. The plaza is notable for a statue in its centre of Emilio Castelar, president of the first Spanish republic, who was born in a house facing the square. A plaque situated on another house, states that Bernardo O'Higgins, an Irish-Chilean adventurer and former dictator of Chile, also lived in the square.\nPlaza de la Catedral and the Cathedral.\nOne of C\u00e1diz's most famous landmarks is its cathedral. Unlike in many places, the Cathedral of C\u00e1diz, known locally as the \"New Cathedral,\" is officially the Cathedral de \"Santa Cruz sobre el mar\" or \"Santa Cruz sobre las Aguas\". It was not built on the site of the original Cathedral de Santa Cruz. The latter was completed in 1263 at the behest of Alfonso X, and burned in the Anglo-Dutch attack on the city in 1596. The reconstruction of the old cathedral started in the early 17th century, but when the city became more prosperous following the move of the \"Casa de Contrataci\u00f3n\" from Seville to C\u00e1diz in 1717, it was felt that a grander cathedral was needed.\nWork on the New Cathedral started in 1722 and was supervised by the architect Vicente Acero, who had also built the Granada Cathedral. Acero resigned from the project and was succeeded by several other architects. As a result, this largely Baroque-style cathedral was built over a period of 116 years, and, due to this drawn-out period of construction, the cathedral underwent several major changes to its original design. Though the cathedral was originally intended to be a baroque edifice with some rococo elements, it was completed in the neoclassical style. Its chapels have many paintings and relics from the old cathedral in C\u00e1diz and as well as from monasteries throughout Spain.\nPlaza de San Juan de Dios and the Old Town Hall.\nConstruction of this plaza began in the 15th century on lands reclaimed from the sea. With the demolition of the City walls in 1906 the plaza increased in size and a statue of the C\u00e1diz politician Segismundo Moret was unveiled. Overlooking the plaza, the \"Ayuntamiento\" is the town hall of C\u00e1diz's \"Old City\". The structure, constructed on the bases and location of the previous Consistorial Houses (1699), was built in two stages. The first stage began in 1799 under the direction of architect Torcuato Benjumeda in the neoclassical style. The second stage was completed in 1861 under the direction of Garc\u00eda del Alamo, in the Isabelline Gothic ( or, simply, the \"Isabelino\") style. Here, in 1936, the flag of Andalusia was hoisted for the first time.\nPlaza de Espa\u00f1a and the monument to the constitution of 1812.\nThe Plaza de Espa\u00f1a is a large square close to the port. It is dominated by the Monument to the Constitution of 1812, which came into being as a consequence of the demolition of a portion of the old city wall. The plaza is an extension of the old Plazuela del Carb\u00f3n.\nThe goal of this demolition was to create a grand new city square to mark the hundredth anniversary of the liberal constitution, which was proclaimed in this city in 1812, and provide a setting for a suitable memorial. The work is by the architect, Modesto Lopez Otero, and of the sculptor, Aniceto Marinas. The work began in 1912 and finished in 1929.\nPlaza Fragela and the Gran Teatro Falla (Falla Grand Theater).\nThe original \"Gran Teatro\" was constructed in 1871 by the architect Garc\u00eda del Alamo, and was destroyed by a fire in August 1881. The current theater was built between 1884 and 1905 over the remains of the previous Gran Teatro. The architect was Adolfo Morales de los Rios, and the overseer of construction was Juan Cabrera de la Torre. The outside was covered in red bricks and is of a neo-Mud\u00e9jar or Moorish revival style. Following renovations in the 1920s, the theater was renamed the \"Gran Teatro Falla\", in honor of composer Manuel de Falla, who is buried in the crypt of the cathedral. After a period of disrepair in the 1980s, the theater has since undergone extensive renovation.\nOther sights.\nTavira tower.\nIn the 18th century, C\u00e1diz had more than 160 towers from which local merchants could look out to sea to watch for arriving merchant ships from the New World. These towers often formed part of the merchants' houses, but this particular tower was located on a high point in the city, 45 meters above sea level, and was chosen by the Navy as their official lookout in 1787 (after eliminating several other locations previously). The \"Torre Tavira\", was named for its original watchman, Don Antonio Tavira, a lieutenant in the Spanish Navy. Today it is the tallest of the towers which still dot the C\u00e1diz skyline. Since 1994 there is a \"camera obscura\", a room that uses the principle of the pinhole camera and a specially prepared convex lens to project panoramic views of the Old City onto a concave disc. There are also two exhibition rooms and a rooftop terrace.\nAdmiral's House.\nThe \"Casa del Almirante\" is a palatial house, adjacent to the Plaza San Mart\u00edn in the Barrio del P\u00f3pulo, which was constructed in 1690 with the proceeds of the lucrative trade with the Americas. It was built by the family of the admiral of the Spanish treasure fleet, the so-called Fleet of the Indies, Don Diego de Barrios. The exterior is sheathed in exquisite red and white Genoan marble, prepared in the workshops of Andreoli, and mounted by the master, Garc\u00eda Narv\u00e1ez. The colonnaded portico, the grand staircase under the cupola, and the hall on the main floor are architectural features of great nobility and beauty. The shield of the Barrios family appears on the second-floor balcony.\nOld customs house.\nSituated within the confines of the walls which protect the flank of the port of C\u00e1diz are three identical adjacent buildings: the Customs House, the House of Hiring and the consulate. Of the three, the former had been erected first, built in a sober neo-classical style and of ample and balanced proportions. The works began in 1765 under the direction of Juan Caballero at a cost of 7,717,200 reales.\nPalacio de Congresos.\nC\u00e1diz's refurbished tobacco factory offers international conference and trade-show facilities. Home to the third annual MAST Conference and trade-show (12 to 14 November 2008).\nPylons of C\u00e1diz.\nThe Pylons of C\u00e1diz are electricity pylons of unusual design, one on either side of the Bay of C\u00e1diz, used to support huge electric-power cables. The pylons are high and designed for two circuits. The very unconventional construction consists of a narrow frustum steel framework with one crossbar at the top of each one for the insulators.\nRoman theatre.\nThe Roman theatre was discovered in 1980, in the El P\u00f3pulo district, after a fire had destroyed some old warehouses, revealing a layer of construction that was judged to be the foundations of some medieval buildings; the foundations of these buildings had been built, in turn, upon much more ancient stones, hand-hewn limestone of a Roman character. Systematic excavations have revealed a largely intact Roman theatre.\nThe theatre, constructed by order of Lucius Cornelius Balbus (minor) during the 1st century BC, is the second-largest Roman theatre in the world, surpassed only by the theatre of Pompeii, south of Rome. Cicero, in his \"Epistulae ad Familiares\" ('Letters to his friends'), wrote of its use by Balbus for personal propaganda.\nLa Pepa Bridge.\nLa Pepa Bridge, officially \"La Pepa\" and also named the second bridge to C\u00e1diz or new access to C\u00e1diz. It opened 24 September 2015. It crosses the Bay of C\u00e1diz linking C\u00e1diz with Puerto Real in mainland Spain. It is the longest bridge in Spain and the longest span cable-stayed in the country.\nThe Constitution of 1812 Bridge, also known as La Pepa Bridge, is a new bridge across the Bay of C\u00e1diz, linking C\u00e1diz with the town of Puerto Real.\nThis is one of the highest bridges in Europe, with 5 kilometers in total length. It is the third access to the city, along with the San Fernando road and the Carranza bridge.\nCity walls and fortifications.\n\"Las Puertas de Tierra\" originated in the 16th century. Once consisting of several layers of walls, only one of these remain today. By the 20th century it was necessary to remodel the entrance to the Old City to accommodate modern traffic. Today, the two side-by-side arches cut into the wall serve as one of the primary entrances to the city.\n\"El Arco de los Blancos\" is the gate to the Populo district, built around 1300. It was the principal gate to the medieval town. The gate is named after the family of Felipe Blanco who built a chapel (now disappeared) above the gate.\n\"El Arco de la Rosa\" (\"Rose Arch\") is a gate carved into the medieval walls next to the cathedral. It is named after captain Gaspar de la Rosa, who lived in the city during the 18th century. The gate was renovated in 1973.\nThe \"Baluarte de la Candelaria\" (fortress or stronghold of Candlemas) is a military fortification. Taking advantage of a natural elevation of land, it was constructed in 1672 at the initiative of the governor, Diego Caballero de Illescas. Protected by a seaward-facing wall that had previously served as a seawall, Candelaria's cannons were in a position to command the channels approaching the port of C\u00e1diz. In more recent times, the edifice has served as a headquarters for the corps of military engineers and as the home to the army's homing pigeons, birds used to carry written messages over hostile terrain. Thoroughly renovated, it is now used as a cultural venue. There has been some discussion of using it to house a maritime museum, but, at present, it is designated for use as a permanent exposition space.\nThe \"Castle of San Sebasti\u00e1n\" is also a military fortification and is situated at the end of a road leading out from the Caleta beach. It was built in 1706. Today the castle remains unused, although its future uses remain much debated.\nThe \"Castle of Santa Catalina\" is also a military fortification, and is situated at the end of the Caleta beach. It was built in 1598 following the English sacking of C\u00e1diz two years earlier. Recently renovated, today it is used for exhibitions and concerts.\nClimate.\nC\u00e1diz has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen \"Csa\"; Trewartha: \"Csal\") with very mild winters and warm to hot summers. The city has significant maritime influences due to its position on a narrow peninsula. C\u00e1diz has one of the warmest winters in Spain and the warmest winter in Europe outside Spain, with an average temperature of in the coldest month. The annual sunshine hours of C\u00e1diz are above 3,000h, being one of the sunniest cities in Europe. Although summer nights are tropical in nature, daytime temperatures are comparatively subdued compared to nearby inland areas such as Jerez and the very hot far inland areas in Andaluc\u00eda. The average sea temperature is around during the winter and around during the summer. Snowfall is unknown at least since 1935.\nBeaches.\nC\u00e1diz, situated on a peninsula, is home to many beaches.\n\"La Playa de la Caleta\" is the most popular beach of C\u00e1diz. It has always been in Carnival songs, due to its unequalled beauty and its proximity to the \"Barrio de la Vi\u00f1a\". It is the beach of the Old City, situated between two castles, San Sebastian and Santa Catalina. It is around long and wide at low tide. La Caleta and the boulevard show a lot of resemblance to parts of Havana, the capital city of Cuba, like the malecon. Therefore, it served as the set for several of the Cuban scenes in the beginning of the James Bond movie \"Die Another Day\".\n\"La Playa de la Victoria\", in the newer part of C\u00e1diz, is the beach most visited by tourists and natives of C\u00e1diz. It is about three km long, and it has an average width of of sand. The moderate swell and the absence of rocks allow family bathing. It is separated from the city by an avenue; on the landward side of the avenue, there are many shops and restaurants.\n\"La Playa de Santa Mar\u00eda del Mar\" or \"Playita de las Mujeres\" is a small beach in C\u00e1diz, situated between La Playa de Victoria and La Playa de la Caleta. It features excellent views of the old district of C\u00e1diz.\nOther beaches are \"Torregorda\", \"Cortadura\" and \"El Chato\".\nCulture.\nLanguage.\nThe Spanish spoken in C\u00e1diz reflects features of Western Andalusian and urban dialects. It is \"seseante\", meaning there is no distinction between the sounds of \"s\" and \"z,\" and the \"s\" is pronounced with the front part of the tongue (predorsal s). Key characteristics include:\nThese features make the C\u00e1diz accent unique, showcasing a strong influence of regional and urban speech patterns.\nCarnival.\nThe Carnival of C\u00e1diz is one of the best known carnivals in the world. Throughout the year, carnival-related activities are almost constant in the city; there are always rehearsals, public demonstrations, and contests of various kinds.\nThe Carnival of C\u00e1diz is famous for the satirical groups called \"chirigotas\", who perform comical musical pieces. Typically, a chirigota is composed of seven to twelve performers who sing, act and improvise accompanied by guitars, kazoos, a bass drum, and a variety of noise-makers. Other than the chirigotas, there are many other groups of performers: choruses; ensembles called \"comparsas\", who sing in close harmony much like the barbershop quartets of African-American culture or the mariachis of Mexico; \"cuartetos\", consisting of four (or sometimes three) performers alternating dramatic parodies and humorous songs; and \"romanceros\", storytellers who recite tales in verse. These diverse spectacles turn the city into a colourful and popular open-air theatre for two entire weeks in February.\nThe \"\" (the official association of carnival groups) sponsors a contest in the \"Gran Teatro Falla\" (see above) each year where chirigotas and other performers compete for prizes. This is the climactic event of the C\u00e1diz carnival.\nCuisine.\nThe gastronomy of C\u00e1diz includes stews and sweets typical of the \"comarca\" and the city.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAccording to a 2021 census estimate, the population of the city of C\u00e1diz was 114,244 (the third-most-populated city of the province after Jerez de la Frontera, with 212,830 inhabitants, and Algeciras with 122,982). It is the only capital city in Spain that is not the most or second-most populated City on its province. C\u00e1diz is the fifty-seventh-largest Spanish city. In recent years, the city's population has steadily declined; it is the only municipality of the Bay of C\u00e1diz (the \"comarca\" composed of C\u00e1diz, Chiclana, El Puerto de Santa Mar\u00eda, Puerto Real, and San Fernando), whose population has diminished. There are forecasts that C\u00e1diz may become the fourth or fifth city in the province after losing more than 10,000 inhabitants from 2011 to 2021. Between 1995 and 2006, it lost more than 14,000 residents, a decrease of 9%.\nAmong the causes of this loss of population is the peculiar geography of C\u00e1diz; the city lies on a narrow spit of land hemmed in by the sea. Consequently, there is a pronounced shortage of land to be developed. The city has very little vacant land, and a high proportion of its housing stock is relatively low in density. (That is to say, many buildings are only two or three stories tall, and they are only able to house a relatively small number of people within their \"footprint\".) The older quarters of C\u00e1diz are full of buildings that, because of their age and historical significance, are not eligible for urban renewal.\nTwo other physical factors tend to limit the city's population. It is impossible to increase the amount of land available for building by reclaiming land from the sea; a new national law governing coastal development thwarts this possibility. Also, because C\u00e1diz is built on a sandspit, it is a costly proposition to sink foundations deep enough to support the high-rise buildings that would allow for a higher population density. As it stands, the city's skyline is not substantially different from in the Middle Ages. A 17th-century watchtower, the Tavira Tower, still commands a panoramic view of the city and the bay despite its relatively modest height. (See below.)\nC\u00e1diz is the provincial capital with the highest rate of unemployment in Spain. This, too, tends to depress the population level. Young Gaditanos, those between 18 and 30 years of age, have been migrating to other places in Spain (Madrid and Castell\u00f3n, chiefly), as well as to other places in Europe and the Americas. The population younger than twenty years old is only 20.58% of the total, and the population older than sixty-five is 21.67%, making C\u00e1diz one of the most aged cities in all of Spain.\nPopulation density.\nThe population distribution of the municipality is extremely uneven. In its inhabited areas, C\u00e1diz is one of the most densely populated cities in Europe. The uninhabited Zona Franca industrial area, Bay of C\u00e1diz Port Area, and Bay of C\u00e1diz Natural Park occupy 63.63% of the municipal area. The entire city population lives in the remaining , at an average density close to 30,000 inhabitants per square kilometer. The city is divided for statistical purposes into 10 divisions, the most densely populated one having 39,592 inhabitants per square kilometer, the least having 20,835.\nThe table below lists the area, population, and population density of the ten statistical divisions of C\u00e1diz. Divisions 1 to 7, the \"stats divisions\", belong to the old town; 8, 9 and 10 correspond to the \"new city\".\nTransportation.\nC\u00e1diz is connected to European route E5 which connects it with Sevilla, Cordoba and Madrid to the North and Algeciras to the South East, continuing as E15 northbound along the Spanish Mediterranean coast.\nThe city is served by Jerez Airport, which is approximately 40\u00a0km (25\u00a0mi) north of the city centre. The airport offers regular domestic flights to Madrid and Barcelona as well as scheduled and seasonal charter flights to the UK, Germany and other European destinations. Cercan\u00edas C\u00e1diz line C1 connects the airport to C\u00e1diz main train station in 1hr.\nC\u00e1diz railway station is located just outside the old town. It offers suburban, regional and national services. The connection to the Madrid-Seville high-speed rail line was finished in 2015 after 14 years of construction, which extends the high speed Alvia trains to the city. Local services make the outskirts and regional destinations accessible along the line to Jerez and Seville. It is also the terminal of the new C\u00e1diz Bay tram-train.\nThe port opposite the train station provides weekly ferry services to the Canary Islands (2\u20133 days travel time) as well as providing a stop for seasonal cruise ships.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nC\u00e1diz is twinned with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "52739", "revid": "38664462", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52739", "title": "Hernando de Soto", "text": "Spanish explorer and conquistador (c.1479\u20131542)\nHernando de Soto (; ; c. 1497 \u2013 21 May 1542) was a Spanish explorer and conquistador who was involved in expeditions in Nicaragua and the Yucatan Peninsula. He played an important role in Francisco Pizarro's conquest of the Inca Empire in Peru, but is best known for leading the first European expedition deep into the territory of the modern-day United States (through Florida, Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama, North Carolina, South Carolina, Mississippi, and most likely Arkansas). He is the first European documented as having crossed the Mississippi River.\nDe Soto's North American expedition was a vast undertaking. It ranged throughout what is now the southeastern United States, searching both for gold, which had been reported by various Native American tribes and earlier coastal explorers, and for a passage to China or the Pacific coast. De Soto died in 1542 on the banks of the Mississippi River; sources disagree on the exact location, whether it was what is now Lake Village, Arkansas, or Ferriday, Louisiana.\nAlthough the scribe (Garcilaso) and the translator (Hakluyt) took different approaches regarding the presentation of de Soto's voyage, both intellectuals took unofficial accounts and instilled them with authority for the benefit of their respective empires. Their writings created overlapping yet distinct portrayals of de Soto\u2019s expedition, shaped by each author\u2019s cultural and political context. \nEarly life.\nHernando de Soto was born around the late 1490s or early 1500s in Extremadura, Spain, to parents who were both \"hidalgos\", nobility of modest means. The region was poor and many people struggled to survive; young people looked for ways to seek their fortune elsewhere. He was born in the current province of Badajoz. Three towns\u2014Badajoz, Barcarrota and Jerez de los Caballeros\u2014each claim to be his birthplace. Historian Ursula Lamb writes that the Barcarrota claim can be traced to Inca Garcilaso de la Vega and is probably incorrect, having been written down 45 years after De Soto's death. According to Lamb, his birthplace is most likely Jerez de los Caballeros. Although he spent time as a child at each place, De Soto stipulated in his will that his body be interred at Jerez de los Caballeros, where other members of his family were buried.\nA few years before his birth, the Kingdoms of Castille and Aragon conquered the last Islamic kingdom of the Iberian Peninsula. Spain and Portugal were filled with young men seeking a chance for military fame after the defeat of the Moors. With Christopher Columbus's discovery of new lands (which he thought to be East Asia) across the ocean to the west, young men were attracted to rumors of adventure, glory and wealth.\nIn the New World.\nDe Soto sailed to the New World with Pedro Arias D\u00e1vila, appointed as the first Governor of Panama. Hernando de Soto landed in Central America as a teenager in 1514, becoming a skilled soldier. In 1520 he participated in Gaspar de Espinosa's expedition to Veragua, and in 1524, he participated in the conquest of Nicaragua under Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba. There he acquired an \"encomienda\" and a public office in Le\u00f3n, Nicaragua.\nBrave leadership, unwavering loyalty, and ruthless schemes for the extortion of native villages for their captured chiefs became de Soto's hallmarks during the conquest of Central America. He gained fame as an excellent horseman, fighter, and tactician. During that time, de Soto was influenced by the achievements of Iberian explorers: Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n, the first European to reach Florida; Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa, the first European to reach the Pacific Ocean coast of the Americas (he called it the \"South Sea\" on the south coast of Panama); and Ferdinand Magellan, who first sailed that ocean to East Asia.\nIn 1530, de Soto became a \"regidor\" of Le\u00f3n, Nicaragua. He led an expedition up the coast of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula searching for a passage between the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean to enable trade with the Orient, the richest market in the world. Failing that, and without means to explore further, de Soto, upon Pedro Arias D\u00e1vila's death, left his estates in Nicaragua. Bringing his own men on ships which he hired, de Soto joined Francisco Pizarro at his first base of Tumbes shortly before departure for the interior of present-day Peru.\n Pizarro quickly made de Soto one of his captains.\nConquest of Peru.\nWhen Pizarro and his men first encountered the army of Inca Atahualpa at Cajamarca, Pizarro sent de Soto with fifteen men to invite Atahualpa to a meeting. When Pizarro's men attacked Atahualpa and his guard the next day (the Battle of Cajamarca), de Soto led one of the three groups of mounted soldiers. The Spanish captured Atahualpa. De Soto was sent to the camp of the Inca army, where he and his men plundered Atahualpa's tents.\nDuring 1533, the Spanish held Atahualpa captive in Cajamarca for months while his subjects paid for his ransom by filling a room with gold and silver objects. During this captivity, de Soto became friendly with Atahualpa and taught him to play chess. By the time the ransom had been completed, the Spanish became alarmed by rumors of an Inca army advancing on Cajamarca. Pizarro sent de Soto with 200 soldiers to scout for the rumored army.\nWhile de Soto was gone, the Spanish in Cajamarca decided to kill Atahualpa to prevent his rescue. De Soto returned to report that he found no signs of an army in the area. After executing Atahualpa, Pizarro and his men headed to Cuzco, the capital of the Incan Empire. As the Spanish force approached Cuzco, Pizarro sent his brother Hernando and de Soto ahead with 40 men. The advance guard fought a pitched battle with Inca troops in front of the city, but the battle had ended before Pizarro arrived with the rest of the Spanish party. The Inca army withdrew during the night. The Spanish plundered Cuzco, where they found much gold and silver. As a mounted soldier, de Soto received a share of the plunder, which made him very wealthy. It represented riches from Atahualpa's camp, his ransom, and the plunder from Cuzco.\nOn the road to Cuzco, Manco Inca Yupanqui, a brother of Atahualpa, had joined Pizarro. Manco had been hiding from Atahualpa in fear of his life, and was happy to gain Pizarro's protection. Pizarro arranged for Manco to be installed as the Inca leader. De Soto joined Manco in a campaign to eliminate the Inca armies under Quizquiz, a general who had been loyal to Atahualpa.\nBy 1534, de Soto was serving as lieutenant governor of Cuzco while Pizarro was building his new capital on the coast; it later became known as Lima. In 1535 King Charles awarded Diego de Almagro, Francisco Pizarro's partner, the governorship of the southern portion of the Inca Empire. When de Almagro made plans to explore and conquer the southern part of the Inca empire (now Chile), de Soto applied to be his second-in-command, but de Almagro turned him down. De Soto packed up his treasure and returned to Spain.\nReturn to Spain.\nDe Soto returned to Spain in 1536, with wealth gathered from plunder in the Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire. He was admitted into the prestigious Order of Santiago and \"granted the right to conquer Florida\". His share was awarded to him by the King of Spain, and he received 724 marks of gold, and 17,740 pesos. He married Isabel de Bobadilla, daughter of Pedrarias D\u00e1vila and a relative of a confidante of Queen Isabella.\nDe Soto petitioned King Charles to lead the government of Guatemala, with \"permission to create discovery in the South Sea.\" He was granted the governorship of Cuba instead. De Soto was expected to colonize the North American continent for Spain within 4 years, for which his family would be given a sizable piece of land.\nFascinated by the stories of Cabeza de Vaca, who had survived years in North America after becoming a castaway and had just returned to Spain, de Soto selected 620 Spanish and Portuguese volunteers, including some of mixed-race African descent known as Atlantic Creoles, to accompany him to govern Cuba and colonize North America. Averaging 24 years of age, the men embarked from Havana on seven of the King's ships and two caravels of de Soto's. With tons of heavy armor and equipment, they also carried more than 500 head of livestock, including 237 horses and 200 pigs, for their planned four-year continental expedition.\nDe Soto wrote a new will upon arriving in what is now the Tampa Bay area of Florida. On 10 May 1539, he wrote in his will:\nThat a chapel be erected within the Church of San Miguel in Jerez de Los Caballeros, Spain, where De Soto grew up, at a cost of 2,000 ducats, with an altarpiece featuring the Virgin Mary, Our Lady of the Conception, that his tomb be covered in a fine black broadcloth topped by a red cross of the Order of the Knights of Santiago, and on special occasions a pall of black velvet with the De Soto coat of arms be placed on the altar; that a chaplain be hired at the salary of 12,000 maravedis to perform five masses every week for the souls of De Soto, his parents, and wife; that thirty masses be said for him the day his body was interred, and twenty for our Lady of the Conception, ten for the Holy Ghost, sixty for souls in purgatory and masses for many others as well; that 150000 maravedis be given annually to his wife Isabel for her needs and an equal amount used yearly to marry off three orphan damsels...the poorest that can be found,\" to assist his wife and also serve to burnish the memory of De Soto as a man of charity and substance.\nDe Soto's exploration of North America.\nHistoriography.\nHistorians have worked to trace the route of de Soto's expedition in North America, a controversial process over the years. Local politicians vied to have their localities associated with the expedition. The most widely used version of \"De Soto's Trail\" comes from a study commissioned by the United States Congress. A committee chaired by the anthropologist John R. Swanton published \"The Final Report of the United States De Soto Expedition Commission\" in 1939. Among other locations, Manatee County, Florida, claims an approximate landing site for de Soto and has a national memorial recognizing that event. In the early 21st century, the first part of the expedition's course, up to de Soto's battle at Mabila (a small fortress town in present-day central Alabama), is disputed only in minor details. His route beyond Mabila is contested. Swanton reported the de Soto trail ran from there through Mississippi, Arkansas, and Texas.\nHistorians have more recently considered archeological reconstructions and the oral history of the various Native American peoples who recount the expedition. Most historical places have been overbuilt and much evidence has been lost. More than 450 years have passed between the events and current history tellers, but some oral histories have been found to be accurate about historic events that have been otherwise documented.\nThe Governor Martin Site at the former Apalachee village of Anhaica, located about a mile east of the present-day Florida state capitol in Tallahassee, has been documented as definitively associated with de Soto's expedition. The Governor Martin Site was discovered by archaeologist B. Calvin Jones in March 1987. It has been preserved as the DeSoto Site Historic State Park.\nThe Hutto/Martin Site, 8MR3447, in southeastern Marion County, Florida, on the Ocklawaha River, is the most likely site of the principal town of \"Acuera\" referred to in the accounts of the \"entrada\", as well as the site of the seventeenth-century mission of Santa Lucia de Acuera.\nAs of 2016, the Richardson/UF Village site (8AL100) in Alachua County, west of Orange Lake, appears to have been accepted by archaeologists as the site of the town of Potano visited by the de Soto expedition. The 17th-century mission of San Buenaventura de Potano is believed to have been founded here.\nMany archaeologists believe the Parkin Archeological State Park in northeast Arkansas was the main town for the indigenous province of Casqui, which de Soto had recorded. They base this on similarities between descriptions from the journals of the de Soto expedition and artifacts of European origin discovered at the site in the 1960s.\nTheories of de Soto's route are based on the accounts of four chroniclers of the expedition.\nMilanich and Hudson warn that older translations of the chronicles are often \"relatively free translations in which the translators took considerable liberty with the Spanish and Portuguese text.\"\nThe chronicles describe de Soto's trail in relation to Havana, from which they sailed; the Gulf of Mexico, which they skirted while traveling inland then turned back to later; the Atlantic Ocean, which they approached during their second year; high mountains, which they traversed immediately thereafter; and dozens of other geographic features along their way, such as large rivers and swamps, at recorded intervals. Given that the natural geography has not changed much since de Soto's time, scholars have analyzed those journals with modern topographic intelligence, to develop a more precise account of the De Soto Trail.\n1539: Florida.\nIn May 1539, de Soto landed nine ships with over 620 men and 220 horses in an area of \"La Florida\" generally identified as the current location of south Tampa Bay. Historian Robert S. Weddle has suggested that he landed at either Charlotte Harbor or San Carlos Bay. He named the land as \"Esp\u00edritu Santo\", after the Holy Spirit. The ships carried priests, craftsmen, engineers, farmers, and merchants; some with their families, some from Cuba, most from Europe and Africa. Few of the men had traveled before outside of Spain, or even away from their home villages.\nNear de Soto's port, the party found Juan Ortiz, a Spaniard living with the Mocoso people. Ortiz had been captured by the Uzita while searching for the lost Narv\u00e1ez expedition; he later escaped to Mocoso. When Ortiz was found, he was naked and in his hand he had a bow and arrows, accompanied by nine Indians who scattered once they were spotted by the party. He was saved from being killed due to yelling \"the Virgin Mary\" and made signs that he was a Christian, since he had almost forgot the Spanish language. Ortiz had learned the Timucua language and served as an interpreter to de Soto as he traversed the Timucuan-speaking areas on his way to Apalachee.\nOrtiz developed a method for guiding the expedition and communicating with the various tribes, who spoke many dialects and languages. He recruited guides from each tribe along the route. A chain of communication was established whereby a guide who had lived in close proximity to another tribal area was able to pass his information and language on to a guide from a neighboring area. Because Ortiz refused to dress as a \"hidalgo\" Spaniard, other officers questioned his motives. De Soto remained loyal to Ortiz, allowing him the freedom to dress and live among his native friends. Another important guide was the seventeen-year-old boy \"Perico\", or Pedro, from what is now Georgia. He spoke several of the local tribes' languages and could communicate with Ortiz. Perico was taken as a guide in 1540. The Spanish had also captured other Indians, whom they used as slave labor. Perico was treated better due to his value to the Spaniards.\nThe expedition traveled north, exploring Florida's West Coast, and encountering native ambushes and conflicts along the way. Hernando de Soto's army seized the food stored in the villages, captured women to be used as slaves for the soldiers' sexual gratification, and forced men and boys to serve as guides and bearers. The army fought two battles with Timucua groups, resulting in heavy Timucua casualties. After defeating the resisting Timucuan warriors, Hernando de Soto had 200 executed, in what was to be called the Napituca Massacre, the first large-scale massacre by Europeans in the current United States. One of Soto's most important battles with the natives, along his conquest of Florida, was a 1539 battle with Chief Vitachuco. Unlike other native chiefs who entered into peace with the Spanish, Vitachuco did not trust them and had secretly plotted to kill Soto and his army, but he was betrayed by interpreters who told Soto the plan. So, Soto struck first and, in the process, killed thousands of natives. Those that survived were surrounded and cornered by woods and water. Thousands were killed during the 3 hours battle and 900 survivors took refuge in the pond, specifically Two-mile Pond in Melrose, where they continued to fight, while swimming. Due to De Narvaez mutilating an Indian chief, when Hernando de Soto was then met by that same chief, he was forced to fight with them despite attempts to not pursue a fight. This came to be common with many other Indian tribes who had previously encountered Narvaez. Most eventually surrendered, but after 30 hours in the water, 7 men remained and had to be dragged out of the water by the Spanish. De Soto's first winter encampment was at \"Anhaica\", the capital of the Apalachee people. It is one of the few places on the route where archaeologists have found physical traces of the expedition. The chroniclers described this settlement as being near the \"Bay of Horses\". The bay was named for events of the 1527 Narv\u00e1ez expedition, the members of which, dying of starvation, killed and ate their horses while building boats for escape by the Gulf of Mexico.\n1540: The Southeast.\nFrom their winter location in the western panhandle of Florida, having heard of gold being mined \"toward the sun's rising\", the expedition turned northeast through what is now the modern state of Georgia toward Ocute territory. Based on archaeological finds made in 2009 at a remote, privately owned site near the Ocmulgee River, researchers believe that de Soto's expedition stopped in Telfair County. Artifacts found here include nine glass trade beads, some of which bear a chevron pattern made in Venice for a limited period of time and believed to be indicative of the de Soto expedition. Six metal objects were also found, including a silver pendant and some iron tools. The rarest items were found within what researchers believe was a large council house of the indigenous people whom de Soto was visiting.\nThe expedition continued to present-day South Carolina. There the expedition recorded being received by the female chief of Cofitachequi, who gave her tribe's pearls, food and other goods to the Spanish soldiers. The expedition found no gold, however, other than pieces from an earlier coastal expedition (presumably that of Lucas V\u00e1zquez de Ayll\u00f3n).\nDe Soto headed north into the Appalachian Mountains of present-day western North Carolina, where he spent a month resting the horses while his men searched for gold. De Soto next entered eastern Tennessee. At this point, de Soto either continued along the Tennessee River to enter Alabama from the north (according to John R. Swanton), or turned south and entered northern Georgia (according to Charles M. Hudson). Swanton's final report, published by the Smithsonian, remains an important resource\u00a0but Hudson's reconstruction of the route was conducted 40 years later and benefited from considerable advances in archaeological methods.\nDe Soto's expedition spent another month in the Coosa chiefdom a vassal to Tuskaloosa, who was the paramount chief, believed to have been connected to the large and complex Mississippian culture, which extended throughout the Mississippi Valley and its tributaries. De Soto turned south toward the Gulf of Mexico to meet two ships bearing fresh supplies from Havana. De Soto demanded women and servants, and when Tuskaloosa refused, the European explorers took him hostage. The expedition began making plans to leave the next day, and Tuskaloosa gave in to de Soto's demands, providing bearers for the Spaniards. He informed de Soto that they would have to go to his town of \"Mabila\" (or \"Mauvila\"), a fortified city in southern Alabama, to receive the women. De Soto gave the chief a pair of boots and a red cloak to reward him for his cooperation. The Mobilian tribe, under chief Tuskaloosa, ambushed de Soto's army. Other sources suggest de Soto's men were attacked after attempting to force their way into a cabin occupied by Tuskaloosa. The Spaniards fought their way out, and retaliated by burning the town to the ground. During the nine-hour encounter, about 200 Spaniards died, and 150 more were badly wounded, according to the chronicler Elvas. Twenty more died during the next few weeks. They killed an estimated 2,000\u20136,000 Native Americans at Mabila, making the battle one of the bloodiest in recorded North American history.\nThe Spaniards won a Pyrrhic victory, as they had lost most of their possessions and nearly one-quarter of their horses. The Spaniards were wounded and sickened, surrounded by enemies and without equipment in an unknown territory. Fearing that word of this would reach Spain if his men reached the ships at Mobile Bay, de Soto led them away from the Gulf Coast. He moved into inland Mississippi, most likely near present-day Tupelo, where they spent the winter.\n1541: Westward.\nIn the spring of 1541, de Soto demanded 200 men as porters from the Chickasaw. They refused his demand and attacked the Spanish camp during the night.\nOn 8 May 1541, de Soto's troops reached the Mississippi River.\nDe Soto had little interest in the river, which in his view was an obstacle to his mission. There has been considerable research into the exact location where de Soto crossed the Mississippi River. A commission appointed by Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1935 determined that Sunflower Landing, Mississippi, was the \"most likely\" crossing place. De Soto possibly traveled down Charley's Trace, which had been used as a trail through the swamps of the Mississippi Delta, to reach the Mississippi River. De Soto and his men spent a month building flatboats, and crossed the river at night to avoid the Native Americans who were patrolling the river. De Soto had hostile relations with the native people in this area.\nIn the late 20th century, research suggests other locations may have been the site of de Soto's crossing, including three locations in Mississippi: Commerce, Friars Point, and Walls, as well as Memphis, Tennessee. Once across the river, the expedition continued traveling westward through modern-day Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. They wintered in \"Autiamique\", on the Arkansas River.\nAfter a harsh winter, the Spanish expedition decamped and moved on more erratically. Their interpreter Juan Ortiz had died, making it more difficult for them to get directions and food sources, and generally to communicate with the Natives. The expedition went as far inland as the Caddo River, where they clashed with a Native American tribe called the Tula in October 1541. The Spaniards characterized them as the most skilled and dangerous warriors they had encountered. This may have happened in the area of present-day Caddo Gap, Arkansas (a monument to the de Soto expedition was erected in that community). Eventually, the Spaniards returned to the Mississippi River.\nDeath.\nDe Soto died of a fever on 21 May 1542, in the native village of \"Guachoya.\" Historical sources disagree as to whether de Soto died near present-day Lake Village, Arkansas McArthur, Arkansas, or Ferriday, Louisiana. Louisiana erected a historical marker at the conjectured site on the western bank of the Mississippi River.\nBefore his death, de Soto chose Luis de Moscoso Alvarado, his former maestro de campo (or field commander), to assume command of the expedition. At the time of death, de Soto owned four Indian slaves, three horses, and 700 hogs.\nDe Soto had deceived the local natives into believing that he was a deity, specifically an \"immortal Son of the Sun\", to gain their submission without conflict. Some of the natives had already become skeptical of de Soto's deity claims, so his men were anxious to conceal his death. The actual site of his burial is not known. According to one source, de Soto's men hid his corpse in blankets weighted with sand and sank it in the middle of the Mississippi River during the night.\nReturn of the expedition to Mexico City.\nDe Soto's expedition had explored \"La Florida\" for three years without finding the expected treasures or a hospitable site for colonization. They had lost nearly half their men, and most of the horses. By this time, the soldiers were wearing animal skins for clothing. Many were injured and in poor health. The leaders came to a consensus (although not total) to end the expedition and try to find a way home, either down the Mississippi River, or overland across Texas to the Spanish colony of Mexico City.\nThey decided that building boats would be too difficult and time-consuming and that navigating the Gulf of Mexico was too risky, so they headed overland to the southwest. Eventually, they reached a region in present-day Texas that was dry. The native populations were made up mostly of subsistence hunter-gatherers. The soldiers found no villages to raid for food, and the army was still too large to live off the land. They were forced to backtrack to the more developed agricultural regions along the Mississippi, where they began building seven \"bergantines\", or pinnaces. They melted down all the iron, including horse tackle and slave shackles, to make nails for the boats. They survived through the winter, and the spring floods delayed them another two months. By July they set off on their makeshift boats down the Mississippi for the coast.\nTaking about two weeks to make the journey, the expedition encountered hostile fleets of war canoes along the whole course. The first was led by the powerful paramount chief \"Quigualtam\", whose fleet followed the boats, shooting arrows at the soldiers for days as they drifted through their territory. The Spanish had no effective offensive weapons on the water, as their crossbows had long since ceased working. They relied on armor and sleeping mats to block the arrows. About 11 Spaniards were killed along this stretch and many more wounded.\nOn reaching the mouth of the Mississippi, they stayed close to the Gulf shore heading south and west. After about 50 days, they made it to the P\u00e1nuco River and the Spanish frontier town of P\u00e1nuco. There they rested for about a month. During this time many of the Spaniards, having safely returned and reflecting on their accomplishments, decided they had left \"La Florida\" too soon. There were some fights within the company, leading to some deaths. But, after they reached Mexico City and the Viceroy Don Antonio de Mendoza offered to lead another expedition to \"La Florida\", few of the survivors volunteered. Of the recorded 700 participants at the start, between 300 and 350 survived (311 is a commonly accepted figure). Most of the men stayed in the New World, settling in Mexico, Peru, Cuba, and other Spanish colonies.\nEffects of expedition in North America.\nThe Spanish believed that de Soto's excursion to Florida was a failure. They acquired neither gold nor prosperity and founded no colonies. But the expedition had several major consequences.\nIt contributed to the process of the Spanish Columbian Exchange. For instance, some of the swine brought by de Soto escaped and became the ancestors of feral razorback pigs in the southeastern United States.\nDe Soto was instrumental in contributing to the development of a hostile relationship between many Native American tribes and Europeans. When his expedition encountered hostile natives in the new lands, more often than not it was his men who instigated the clashes.\nMore devastating than the battles were the diseases which may have been carried by the members of the expedition. Because the indigenous people lacked the immunity which the Europeans had acquired through generations of exposure to these Eurasian diseases, the Native Americans may have suffered epidemics of illness after exposure to such diseases as measles, smallpox, and chicken pox. Several areas traversed by the expedition became depopulated, potentially by disease caused by contact with the Europeans. Seeing the high fatalities and devastation caused, many natives would have fled the populated areas for the surrounding hills and swamps. In some areas, the social structure would have changed because of high population losses due to epidemics. However, recent scholars have begun to question whether the expedition brought novel disease at all. The arrival of many diseases, aside from malaria, is disputed and they may not have entered the region until much later. The first documented smallpox epidemic in the southeast arrived in 1696, and Mississippian social structures persisted in some parts of the region until the 18th century. \nThe records of the expedition contributed greatly to European knowledge about the geography, biology, and ethnology of the New World. The de Soto expedition's descriptions of North American natives are the earliest-known source of information about the societies in the Southeast. They are the only European description of the culture and habits of North American native tribes before these peoples encountered other Europeans. De Soto's men were both the first and nearly the last Europeans to witness the villages and civilization of the Mississippian culture.\nDe Soto's expedition led the Spanish crown to reconsider Spain's attitude toward the colonies north of Mexico. He claimed large parts of North America for Spain.\nEfforts to reconstruct de Soto's route was met with resistance from public denunciation questioning the credibility of the \"official route\u201d. earning more details on the de Soto used matters because with a precise reconstruction of the de Soto route in hand, the information and incidents of the expedition can then be linked to archaeological information, and in this way we can build a picture of the social geography of a significant portion of the sixteenth-century southeastern United States.\nNamesakes.\nMany parks, towns, counties, and institutions have been named after Hernando de Soto, to include:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Australia's first and only military coup, its name derives from the illicit rum trade of early Sydney, over which the 'Rum Corps', as it became known, maintained a monopoly. During the first half of the 19th century, it was widely referred to in Australia as the Great Rebellion.\nBligh, a former Royal Navy captain known for his overthrow in the mutiny on the \"Bounty\", had been appointed governor in 1805 to rein in the power of the Corps. Over the next two years, Bligh made enemies not only of Sydney's military elite, but several prominent civilians, notably John Macarthur, who joined Major George Johnston in organising an armed takeover. On 26 January 1808, 400 soldiers marched on Government House and arrested Bligh. He was kept in confinement in Sydney, then aboard a ship off Hobart, Van Diemen's Land, for the next two years while Johnston acted as Lieutenant-Governor of New South Wales. The military remained in control until the 1810 arrival from Britain of Major-General Lachlan Macquarie, who took over as governor.\nBligh's appointment as governor.\nWilliam Bligh succeeded Philip Gidley King. Bligh was well known for his overthrow in the mutiny on the \"Bounty\". It is likely that he was deliberately selected by the British government because of his reputation as a \"hard man\" and was expected to have a good chance of reining in the maverick New South Wales Corps; something that his predecessors had not been able to do. Bligh left for Sydney with his daughter, Mary Putland, and her husband, Lieutenant John Putland, while Bligh's wife remained in England.\nEven before his arrival, Bligh's style of governance led to problems with his subordinates. The Admiralty gave command of the storeship and the convoy to the lower-ranked Captain Joseph Short, while Bligh took command of a transport ship. This led to quarrels which eventually resulted in Captain Short firing across Bligh's bow in an attempt to force Bligh to obey his signals. When this failed, Short tried to give an order to Lieutenant Putland to stand by to fire on Bligh's ship. Bligh boarded \"Porpoise\" and seized control of the convoy.\nWhen they arrived in Sydney, Bligh, backed up by statements from two of Short's officers, had Short stripped of the captaincy of \"Porpoise\" \u2013 which he gave to his son-in-law, cancelled the land grant Short had been promised as payment for the voyage, and shipped him back to England for court-martial. Short was acquitted. The president of the court, Sir Isaac Coffin, wrote to the Admiralty and made several serious accusations against Bligh, including that he had influenced the officers to testify against Short. Bligh's wife obtained a statement from one of the officers denying this, and Banks and other supporters of Bligh lobbied successfully against his recall as governor.\nArrival in Sydney.\nSoon after his arrival at Sydney, in August 1806, Bligh was given an address of welcome signed by Major George Johnston for the military, by Richard Atkins for the civilian officers, and by John Macarthur for the free settlers. However, not long after, Bligh also received addresses from the free and freed settlers of Sydney and the Hawkesbury River region, with a total of 369 signatures, many made only with a cross, complaining that Macarthur did not represent them. They blamed him for withholding sheep so as to raise the price of mutton.\nOne of Bligh's first actions was to use the colony's stores and herds to provide relief to farmers who had been severely affected by flooding on the Hawkesbury River, a situation that had disrupted the barter economy in the colony. Supplies were divided according to those most in need, and provisions were made for loans to be drawn from the store based on capacity to repay. This earned Bligh the gratitude of the farmers, but the enmity of traders in the Corps who had been profiting greatly from the situation.\nUnder instructions from the Colonial Office, Bligh attempted to normalise trading conditions in the colony by prohibiting the use of spirits as payment for commodities. He communicated his policy to the Colonial Office in 1807, with the advice that his policy would be met with resistance. On 31 December 1807 Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh, Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, wrote back to Bligh with instructions to stop the barter of spirits.\nH. V. Evatt concludes in his history of the Rebellion that Bligh \"was authorised to prevent free importation, to preserve the trade under his entire control, to enforce all penalties against illegal import, and to establish regulations at his discretion for the sale of spirits\". He argues that the enmity of the monopolists within the colony stemmed from this prohibition and other policies which counteracted the power of the rich and promoted the welfare of the poor settlers. Bligh ceased the practice of handing out large land grants to the powerful in the colony; during his term, he granted just over 1,600 hectares of land, half of it to his daughter and himself.\nBligh also caused controversy by allowing a group of Irish convicts to be tried for revolt by a court that included their accusers. But when six of the eight were acquitted, he ordered them kept under arrest anyway. He dismissed D'Arcy Wentworth from his position of Assistant Surgeon to the Colony without explanation, and sentenced three merchants to a month's imprisonment and a fine for writing a letter that he considered offensive. Bligh also dismissed Thomas Jamison from the magistracy, describing him in 1807 as being \"inimical\" to good government. Jamison was the highly capable (if crafty) Surgeon-General of New South Wales, and had accumulated significant personal wealth as a maritime trader; he was also a friend and business partner of the powerful Macarthur.\nIn October 1807 Major Johnston wrote a formal letter of complaint to the Commander-in-Chief of the British Army, stating that Bligh was abusive and interfering with the troops of the New South Wales Corps. Bligh had clearly made enemies of some of the most influential people in the colony. He also antagonised some of the less wealthy when he ordered those who had leases on government land within Sydney to remove their houses.\nEnmity between Bligh and Macarthur.\nMacarthur had arrived with the New South Wales Corps in 1790 as a lieutenant, and by 1805 he had substantial farming and commercial interests in the colony. He had quarrelled with the governors preceding Bligh and had fought three duels.\nBligh and Macarthur's interests clashed in a number of ways. Bligh stopped Macarthur from cheaply distributing large quantities of rum into the Corps and halted his allegedly illegal importation of stills. Macarthur's interest in an area of land granted to him by King conflicted with Bligh's town-planning interests. The two men were also engaged in other disagreements, including a conflict over landing regulations. In June 1807, a convict had stowed away and escaped Sydney on Macarthur's schooner . When \"Parramatta\" returned to Sydney in December 1807, the bond held to ensure that masters and owners of vessels did not help prisoners escape the colony was deemed to be forfeited.\nBligh had the Judge Advocate, Richard Atkins, issue an order for Macarthur to appear on the matter of the bond on 15 December 1807. Macarthur disobeyed the order, was arrested and bailed, and failed to appear for trial at the next sitting of the Sydney Criminal Court on 25 January 1808. Atkins rejected this, but Macarthur's protest had the support of the other six members of the court, all officers of the New South Wales Corps. Macarthur objected to Atkins being fit to sit in judgement of him because he was his debtor and inveterate enemy. Without the Judge Advocate, the trial could not take place and the court dissolved.\nBligh accused the six officers of what amounted to mutiny and summoned Johnston to come and deal with the matter. Johnston replied that he was ill, as he had wrecked his gig on the evening of 24 January on his way home to his farm after dining with officers of the Corps.\nOverthrow of Governor Bligh.\nOn the morning of 26 January 1808, Bligh again ordered that Macarthur be arrested and also ordered the return of court papers, which were held by officers of the New South Wales Corps. The Corps responded with a request for a new Judge Advocate and the release of Macarthur on bail. Bligh summoned the officers to Government House to answer charges made by Atkins, and he informed Johnston that he considered the action of the officers of the Corps to be treasonable.\nJohnston, instead, visited the jail and issued an order releasing Macarthur, who drafted a petition calling for Johnston to arrest Bligh and take charge of the colony. This petition was signed by the officers of the Corps and other prominent citizens but, according to Evatt, most signatures had probably been added only after Bligh was safely under house arrest. Johnston consulted with the officers and issued an order stating that Bligh was \"charged by the respectable inhabitants of crimes that render you unfit to exercise the supreme authority another moment in this colony; and in that charge all officers under my command have joined.\" Johnston went on to call for Bligh to resign and submit to arrest.\nAt 6:00 pm, the Corps, with full band and colours, marched to Government House to arrest Bligh. They were hindered by his daughter and her parasol, but Captain Thomas Laycock finally found Bligh, in full dress uniform, behind his bed where he claimed he was hiding papers. Bligh was painted as a coward for this action, but Duffy argues that if Bligh was hiding, it would have been to escape and thwart the coup. In his book \"Captain Bligh's Other Mutiny\", Stephen Dando-Collins agrees and suggests that Bligh was planning to escape to the Hawkesbury River and to lead settlers there who were strongly supportive of him. During 1808 Bligh and his daughter were confined to Government House under house arrest. Bligh refused to leave for England until lawfully relieved of his duty.\nJohnston took control with the rank of lieutenant-colonel on 25 April 1808 and appointed Charles Grimes, the Surveyor-General, as Judge Advocate. He ordered Macarthur and the six officers be tried; they were found not guilty. Macarthur was appointed as Colonial Secretary and effectively ran the business affairs of the colony.\nAnother prominent opponent of Bligh, Macarthur's ally Thomas Jamison, was appointed as the colony's Naval Officer (the equivalent of Collector of Customs and Excise) and also reinstated as a magistrate. This enabled him and his fellow legal officers to scrutinise Bligh's personal papers for evidence of wrongdoing. In June 1809 Jamison sailed to London to bolster his business interests and give evidence against Bligh in any legal prosecutions that might be brought against the mutineers. He died in London at the beginning of 1811, however, so could not testify at Johnston's court martial in June of that year.\nShortly after the coup, a watercolour by an unknown artist, illustrating Bligh's arrest, was exhibited in Sydney at perhaps Australia's first public art exhibition. The watercolour depicts a Corps soldier dragging Bligh from underneath one of the servants' beds in Government House, with two other soldiers standing by. The two soldiers in the watercolour are most likely John Sutherland and Michael Marlborough, and the other figure on the far right is believed to represent Lieutenant William Minchin. This watercolour is Australia's earliest surviving political cartoon. The Corps regarded themselves as gentlemen and in depicting Bligh as a coward, the cartoon declares that Bligh was not a gentleman and therefore not fit to govern.\nThe origins of the watercolour derive from a dispute between Bligh and Sergeant Major Whittle about Bligh demanding Whittle to pull down his house as it was halting improvements to the town. It has been suggested Whittle either commissioned the painting or had painted the watercolour himself, but neither is likely as Whittle was illiterate.\nA new governor is appointed.\nFollowing Bligh's overthrow, Johnston had notified his superior officer, Colonel William Paterson of events. At the time, Paterson was in Van Diemen's Land (now called Tasmania) establishing a settlement at Port Dalrymple (now Launceston). He was reluctant to get involved until clear orders arrived from England. When he learned in March that Lieutenant-Colonel Joseph Foveaux was returning to Sydney with orders to become acting Lieutenant-Governor of New South Wales, Paterson left Foveaux to deal with the prevailing situation.\nFoveaux arrived in July and took over the colony as lieutenant-colonel on 28 July 1808, which annoyed Macarthur. Since a decision was expected from England, and feeling that Bligh's behaviour had been insufferable, Foveaux left Bligh under house arrest. He turned his attention to improving the colony's roads, bridges and public buildings, which he felt had been badly neglected. When there was still no word from England, he summoned Paterson to Sydney in January 1809 to sort out matters. Paterson sent Johnston and Macarthur to England for trial, and confined Bligh to the barracks until he signed a contract agreeing to return to England. Paterson, whose health was failing, retired to Government House and left Foveaux to run the colony.\nIn January 1809 Bligh was given the control of HMS \"Porpoise\" on condition that he return to England. However, Bligh sailed to Hobart in Van Diemen's Land, seeking the support of Lieutenant-Governor David Collins to retake control of the New South Wales Colony. Collins refused to support him and on Paterson's orders, Bligh remained cut off on board \"Porpoise\", moored at the mouth of the River Derwent south of Hobart, until January 1810.\nThe Colonial Office finally decided that sending naval governors to rule the New South Wales Colony was untenable. Instead the New South Wales Corps, now known as the 102nd Regiment of Foot, was to be recalled to England and replaced with the 73rd Regiment of Foot, whose commanding officer would take over as governor. Bligh was to be reinstated for twenty-four hours, then recalled to England; Johnston sent to England for court martial; and Macarthur tried in Sydney. Major-General Lachlan Macquarie was put in charge of the mission after Major-General Miles Nightingall fell ill before departure. Macquarie took over as governor with an elaborate ceremony on 1 January 1810.\nAftermath.\nMacquarie reinstated all the officials who had been sacked by Johnston and Macarthur, replaced the alcoholic Atkins with Ellis Bent (the first professional lawyer to occupy a public post in Australia) as Judge Advocate, and cancelled all land and stock grants that had been made since Bligh's deposition. To calm things down, he made grants that he thought appropriate and prevented any reprisals. When Bligh received the news of Macquarie's arrival, he sailed to Sydney, arriving on 17 January 1810 to collect evidence for the forthcoming court martial of Johnston. He departed for the trial in England on 12 May, arriving on 25 October 1810 aboard .\nHaving informally heard arguments from both sides, the government authorities in England were not impressed by either Macarthur and Johnston's accusations against Bligh, nor by Bligh's ill-tempered letters accusing key figures in the colony of unacceptable conduct. Johnston was court-martialled, found guilty and cashiered, the lowest penalty possible. He was able to return as a free citizen to his estate, Annandale, in Sydney. Macarthur was not tried but was refused permission to return to New South Wales until 1817, since he would not admit his wrongdoing. Bligh's promotion to rear admiral was held up until the end of Johnston's trial. Afterward it was backdated to 31 July 1810, and Bligh took up a position that had been kept for him. He continued his naval career in the Admiralty, without command, and died of cancer in Bond Street, London in 1817.\nMacquarie had been impressed with Foveaux's administration, putting his name forward to succeed Collins as Lieutenant-Governor of Tasmania because he could think of no one more fitting; and considered that he could not have acted otherwise with regard to Bligh. However, when Foveaux returned to England in 1810 he was court-martialled for assenting to Bligh being deposed and imprisoned; Macquarie's recommendation was ignored. Foveaux was taken back into active service in 1811 and promoted to lieutenant-colonel of the 1st Regiment Greek Light Infantry. He pursued an uneventful military career after that, rising to the rank of lieutenant-general.\nCauses.\nMichael Duffy, an author writing in 2006, says\nEssentially it was the culmination of a long-running tussle for power between the government and private entrepreneurs, a fight over the future and the nature of the colony. The early governors wanted to keep NSW as a large-scale open prison, with a primitive economy based on yeomen ex-convicts and run by government fiat.\nDuffy goes on to say that the Rebellion was not thought of at the time as being about rum:\n... almost no one at the time of the rebellion thought it was about rum. Bligh tried briefly to give it that spin, to smear his opponents, but there was no evidence for it and he moved on.\nMany years later, in 1855, an English Quaker named William Howitt published a popular history of Australia. Like many teetotallers, he was keen to blame alcohol for all the problems in the world. Howitt took Bligh's side and invented the phrase Rum Rebellion, and it has stuck ever since.\n\"The Biography of Early Australia\" dismisses Macarthur's complaints as ridiculous and quotes Evatt as saying that legally Macarthur was guilty of two out of the three charges brought against him, including sedition. Both consider that Bligh was wholly justified in his actions because he was the legitimate authority. Duffy asserts that had Johnston arrived when summoned on 25 January, the Rum Rebellion probably would never have happened.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The most common configuration has a case that houses the power supply, motherboard (a printed circuit board with a microprocessor as the central processing unit, memory, bus, certain peripherals and other electronic components), disk storage (usually one or more hard disk drives, solid-state drives, optical disc drives, and in early models floppy disk drives); a keyboard and mouse for input; and a monitor, speakers, and, often, a printer for output. The case may be oriented horizontally or vertically and placed either underneath, beside, or on top of a desk.\nDesktop computers with their cases oriented vertically are referred to as towers. As the majority of cases offered since the mid 1990s are in this form factor, the term \"desktop\" has been retronymically used to refer to modern cases offered in the traditional horizontal orientation.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nPrior to the widespread use of microprocessors, a computer that could fit on a desk was considered remarkably small; the type of computers most commonly used were minicomputers, which, despite the name, were rather large and were \"mini\" only compared to the so-called \"big iron\". Early computers, and later the general purpose high throughput \"mainframes\", took up the space of a whole room. Minicomputers, on the contrary, generally fit into one or a few refrigerator-sized racks, or, for the few smaller ones, \"built into\" a fairly large desk, not put \"on top\" of it.\nIt was not until the 1970s when fully programmable computers appeared that could fit entirely on top of a desk. 1970 saw the introduction of the Datapoint 2200, a \"smart\" computer terminal complete with keyboard and monitor, was designed to connect with a mainframe computer but that did not stop owners from using its built-in computational abilities as a stand-alone desktop computer. The HP 9800 series, which started out as programmable calculators in 1971 but was programmable in BASIC by 1972, used a smaller version of a minicomputer design based on ROM memory and had small one-line LED alphanumeric displays and displayed graphics with a plotter. The Wang 2200 of 1973 had a full-size cathode-ray tube (CRT) and cassette tape storage. The IBM 5100 in 1975 had a small CRT display and could be programmed in BASIC and APL. These were generally expensive specialized computers sold for business or scientific uses.\nGrowth and development.\nApple II, TRS-80 and Commodore PET were first generation personal home computers launched in 1977, which were aimed at the consumer market \u2013 rather than businessmen or computer hobbyists. \"Byte\" magazine referred to these three as the \"1977 Trinity\" of personal computing. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, desktop computers became the predominant type, the most popular being the IBM PC and its clones, followed by the Apple Macintosh, with the third-placed Commodore Amiga having some success in the mid-1980s but declining by the early 1990s.\nEarly personal computers, like the original IBM Personal Computer, were enclosed in a \"desktop case\", horizontally oriented to have the display screen placed on top, thus saving space on the user's actual desk, although these cases had to be sturdy enough to support the weight of CRT displays that were widespread at the time. Over the course of the 1990s, desktop cases gradually became less common than the more-accessible tower cases that may be located on the floor under or beside a desk rather than on a desk. Not only do these tower cases have more room for expansion, they have also freed up desk space for monitors which were becoming larger every year. Desktop cases, particularly the compact form factors, remain popular for corporate computing environments and kiosks. Some computer cases can be interchangeably positioned either horizontally (desktop) or upright (mini-tower).\nInfluential games such as \"Doom\" and \"Quake\" during the 1990s had pushed gamers and enthusiasts to frequently upgrade to the latest CPUs and graphics cards (3dfx, ATI, and Nvidia) for their desktops (usually a tower case) in order to run these applications, though this has slowed since the late 2000s as the growing popularity of Intel integrated graphics forced game developers to scale back. Creative Technology's Sound Blaster series were a \"de facto\" standard for sound cards in desktop PCs during the 1990s until the early 2000s, when they were reduced to a niche product, as OEM desktop PCs came with sound boards integrated directly onto the motherboard.\nDecline.\nWhile desktops have long been the most common configuration for PCs, by the mid-2000s the growth shifted from desktops to laptops. Laptops had long been produced by contract manufacturers based in Asia, such as Foxconn, and this shift led to the closure of the many desktop assembly plants in the United States by 2010. Another trend around this time was the increasing proportion of inexpensive base-configuration desktops being sold, hurting PC manufacturers such as Dell whose build-to-order customization of desktops relied on upselling added features to buyers.\nBattery-powered portable computers had just a 2% worldwide market share in 1986. However, laptops have become increasingly popular, both for business and personal use. Around 109 million notebook PCs shipped worldwide in 2007, a growth of 33% compared to 2006. In 2008, it was estimated that 145.9 million notebooks were sold and that the number would grow in 2009 to 177.7 million. The third quarter of 2008 was the first time when worldwide notebook PC shipments exceeded desktops, with 38.6 million units versus 38.5 million units.\nThe sales breakdown of the Apple Macintosh has seen sales of desktop Macs staying mostly constant while being surpassed by that of Mac notebooks whose sales rate has grown considerably; seven out of ten Macs sold were laptops in 2009, a ratio projected to rise to three out of four by 2010. The change in sales of form factors is due to the desktop iMac moving from affordable G3 to upscale G4 model and subsequent releases are considered premium all-in-ones. By contrast, the MSRP of the MacBook laptop lines have dropped through successive generations such that the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro constitute the lowest price of entry to a Mac, with the exception of the even more inexpensive Mac Mini (albeit without a monitor and keyboard), and the MacBooks are the top-selling form factors of the Macintosh platform today.\nThe decades of development mean that most people already own desktop computers that meet their needs and have no need of buying a new one merely to keep pace with advancing technology. Notably, the successive release of new versions of Windows (Windows 95, 98, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10 and so on) had been drivers for the replacement of PCs in the 1990s, but this slowed in the 2000s due to the poor reception of Windows Vista over Windows XP. IDC analyst Jay Chou suggested that Windows 8 actually hurt sales of PCs in 2012, as businesses decided to stick with Windows 7 rather than upgrade. Some suggested that Microsoft had acknowledged \"implicitly ringing the desktop PC death knell\" as Windows 8 offered little upgrade in desktop PC functionality over Windows 7; instead, Windows 8's innovations were mostly on the mobile side.\nThe post-PC trend saw a decline in the sales of desktop and laptop PCs. The decline was attributed to increased power and applications of alternative computing devices, namely smartphones and tablet computers. Although most people exclusively use their smartphones and tablets for more basic tasks such as social media and casual gaming, these devices have in many instances replaced a second or third PC in the household that would have performed these tasks, though most families still retain a powerful PC for serious work.\nAmong PC form factors, desktops remain a staple in the enterprise market but lost popularity among home buyers. PC makers and electronics retailers responded by investing their engineering and marketing resources towards laptops (initially netbooks in the late 2000s, and then the higher-performance Ultrabooks from 2011 onwards), which manufacturers believed had more potential to revive the PC market than desktops.\nIn April 2017, StatCounter declared a \"Milestone in technology history and end of an era\" with the mobile Android operating system becoming more popular than Windows (the operating system that made desktops dominant over mainframe computers). Windows is still most popular on desktops (and laptops), while smartphones (and tablets) use Android or iOS.\nResurgence.\nTowards the middle of the 2010s, media sources began to question the existence of the post-PC trend, at least as conventionally defined, stating that the so-called post-PC devices are just other portable forms of PCs joining traditional desktop PCs which still have their own operation areas and evolve.\nAlthough for casual use traditional desktops and laptops have seen a decline in sales, in 2018, global PC sales experienced a resurgence, driven by the business market. Desktops remain a solid fixture in the commercial and educational sectors. In 2019 the global PC market recorded its first full year of growth in eight years. Inclusive of desktops, notebooks and workstations, 268.1 million units were shipped, up 2.7% on 2018. According to the International Data Corporation (IDC), PC sales shot up 14.8% between 2020 and 2021 and desktop market grew faster than the laptop market in the second quarter of 2021. Total PC shipments during 2021 reached 348.8 million units, up 14.8% from 2020. This represents the highest level of shipments the PC market has seen since 2012. In addition, gaming desktops have seen a global revenue increase of 54% annually. For gaming the global market of gaming desktops, laptops, and monitors was expected to grow to 61.1 million shipments by the end of 2023, up from 42.1 million, with desktops growing from 15.1 million shipments to 19 million. PC gaming as a whole accounts for 28% of the total gaming market as of 2017. This is partially due to the increasing affordability of desktop PCs. In 2024 255.5 million PCs (including desktops and laptops) were shipped, up from 246 million in 2023 - a 3.8% year-over-year growth with Lenovo maintaining the largest market share.\nTypes.\nBy size.\nFull-size.\nFull-sized desktops are characterized by separate display and processing components. These components are connected to each other by cables or wireless connections. They often come in a tower form factor. These computers are easy to customize and upgrade per user requirements, e.g. by expansion card.\nEarly extended-size (significantly larger than mainstream ATX case) tower computers sometimes were labeled as \"deskside computers\", but currently this naming is quite rare.\nCompact.\nCompact desktops are reduced in physical proportions compared to full-sized desktops. They are typically small-sized, inexpensive, low-power computers designed for basic tasks such as web browsing, accessing web-based applications, document processing, and audio/video playback. Hardware specifications and processing power are usually reduced and hence make them less appropriate for running complex or resource-intensive applications. A nettop is a notable example of a compact desktop. A laptop without a screen can functionally be used as a compact desktop, sometimes called a \"slabtop\".\nForm factor.\nAll-in-one.\nAn \"all-in-one\" (AIO) desktop computer integrates the system's internal components into the same case as the display, thus occupying a smaller footprint (with fewer cables) than desktops that incorporate a tower. The All-in-one systems are rarely labeled as desktop computers.\nTower.\nIn personal computing, a tower is a form factor of desktop computer case whose height is much greater than its width, thus having the appearance of an upstanding tower block.\nPizza box form factor.\nIn computing, a pizza box enclosure is a design for desktop computers. Pizza box cases tend to be wide and flat, resembling pizza delivery boxes and thus the name.\nCube.\nCube Workstations have a cube case enclosure to house the motherboard, PCI-E expansion cards, GPU, CPU, DRAM DIMM slots, computer cooling equipment, chipsets, I/O ports, hard disk drives, and solid-state drives.\nOpen Frame.\nOpen Frame cases have easy service access, and have no airflow problems,&lt;ref name=\"TH/open-frame-launches\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; are great for building liquid-cooled systems and have an industrial design look, but will draw a lot of dust on components and needs cleaning them more often, yet the design allows blowing dust away with ease.&lt;ref name=\"pcguide/best-open-air\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"guru3d/nagao-open-frame\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"notebookcheck/556909.0\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nBy usage.\nGaming computer.\nGaming computers are desktop computers with high performance CPU, GPU, and RAM optimized for playing video games at high resolution and frame rates. Gaming computer peripheries usually include mechanical keyboards for faster response time, and a gaming computer mouse which can track higher dots per inch movement.\nHome theater.\nThese desktops are connected to home entertainment systems and typically used for amusement purpose. They come with high definition display, video graphics, surround sound and TV tuner systems to complement typical PC features.\nThin client / Internet appliance.\nOver time some traditional desktop computers have been replaced with thin clients utilizing off-site computing solutions like the cloud. As more services and applications are served over the internet from off-site servers, local computing needs decrease, this drives desktop computers to be smaller, cheaper, and need less powerful hardware. More applications and in some cases entire virtual desktops are moved off-site and the desktop computer runs only an operating system or a shell application while the actual content is served from a server. Thin client computers may do almost all of their computing on a virtual machine in another site. Internal, hosted virtual desktops can offer users a completely consistent experience from anywhere.\nWorkstation.\nWorkstations are advanced class of personal computers designed for a user and more powerful than a regular PC but less powerful than a server in regular computing. They are capable of high-resolution and three-dimensional interfaces, and typically used to perform scientific and engineering work. Like server computers, they are often connected with other workstations. The main form-factor for this class is a Tower case, but most vendors produce compact or all-in-one low-end workstations. Most tower workstations can be converted to a rack-mount version.\nDesktop server.\nOriented for small business class of servers; typically entry-level server machines, with similar to workstation/gaming PC computing powers and with some mainstream servers features, but with only basic graphic abilities; and some desktop servers can be converted to workstations.\nComparison with laptops.\nDesktops have an advantage over laptops in that the spare parts and extensions tend to be standardized, resulting in lower prices and greater availability. For example, the size and mounting of the motherboard are standardized into ATX, microATX, BTX or other form factors. Desktops have several standardized expansion slots, like conventional PCI or PCI Express, while laptops tend to have only one mini-PCI slot and one PC Card slot (or ExpressCard slot). Procedures for assembly and disassembly of desktops tend to be simple and standardized as well. This tends not to be the case for laptops, though adding or replacing some parts, like the optical drive, hard disk, or adding an extra memory module is often quite simple. This means that a desktop computer configuration, usually a tower case, can be customized and upgraded to a greater extent than laptops. This customization has kept tower cases popular among gamers and enthusiasts.\nAnother advantage of the desktop is that (apart from environmental concerns) power consumption is not as critical as in laptop computers because the desktop is exclusively powered from the wall socket. Desktop computers also provide more space for cooling fans and vents to dissipate heat, allowing enthusiasts to overclock with less risk. The two large microprocessor manufacturers, Intel and AMD, have developed special CPUs for mobile computers (i.e. laptops) that consume less power and lower heat, but with lower performance levels.\nLaptop computers, conversely, offer portability that desktop systems (including small form factor and all-in-one desktops) cannot due to their compact size and clamshell design. The laptop's all-in-one design provides a built-in keyboard and a pointing device (such as a touchpad) for its user and can draw on power supplied by a rechargeable battery. Laptops also commonly integrate wireless technologies like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and 3G, giving them a broader range of options for connecting to the internet, though this trend is changing as newer desktop computers come integrated with one or more of these technologies.\nA desktop computer needs a UPS to handle electrical disturbances like short interruptions, blackouts, and spikes; achieving an on-battery time of more than 20\u201330 minutes for a desktop PC requires a large and expensive UPS. A laptop with a sufficiently charged battery can continue to be used for hours in case of a power outage and is not affected by short power interruptions and blackouts.\nA desktop computer often has the advantage over a comparable laptop in computational capacity. Overclocking is often more feasible on a desktop than on a laptop; similarly, hardware add-ons such as discrete graphics co-processors may be possible to install only in a desktop.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was the son of the eleventh sh\u014dgun Ashikaga Yoshizumi.\nFrom a western perspective, Yoshiharu is significant, as he was sh\u014dgun when the first contact of Japan with the European West took place in 1543. A Portuguese ship, blown off its course to China, landed in Japan. In 1526, Yoshiharu invited archers from neighbouring provinces to come to the capital for an archery contest.\nBiography.\nHis childhood name was Kameomaru (\u4e80\u738b\u4e38). On 1 May 1521, after Sh\u014dgun Ashikaga Yoshitane and Hosokawa Takakuni struggled for power over the shogunate and Yoshitane withdrew to Awaji Island, the way was clear for Ashikaga Yoshiharu to be installed as sh\u014dgun as he enters Kyoto.\nIn 1521, Hosokawa Takakuni orchestrated the appointment of Yoshiharu as sh\u014dgun. By 1526, tumultuous events marked by the Kasai and Miyoshi rebellions unfolded. In 1528, the political landscape shifted dramatically as Yoshiharu was ousted by Miyoshi Nagamoto, setting the stage for a period of significant change.\nThe 1530s further complicated the era, beginning with the eruption of the Ikk\u014d rebellion in 1533. 1536 became a pivotal year with Emperor Go-Nara's ascension, and by 1538, internal strife plagued the Koga Kub\u014d's family, introducing new layers of discord. Later in 1546 Yoshiharu sought refuge in \u014cmi, while his son, Yoshiteru, assumed the role of sh\u014dgun in exile.\nVoid of any political power and repeatedly forced from the capital in Kyoto, Yoshiharu retired in 1546 over a political struggle between Miyoshi Nagayoshi and Hosokawa Harumoto making his son Ashikaga Yoshiteru the thirteenth sh\u014dgun. He died on 20th May, 1550. Later in 1568, supported by Oda Nobunaga, his other son Ashikaga Yoshiaki became the fifteenth sh\u014dgun.\nEras of Yoshiharu's \"bakufu\".\nThe years in which Yoshiharu was \"sh\u014dgun\" are more specifically identified by more than one era name or \"neng\u014d\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

For that, he was elected to the French Academy of Sciences in 1764.\nBorda was a mariner and a scientist, spending time in the Caribbean testing out advances in chronometers. Between 1777 and 1778, he participated in the American Revolutionary War. In 1781, he was put in charge of several vessels in the French Navy. In 1782, he was captured by the English, and was returned to France shortly after. He returned as an engineer in the French Navy, making improvements to waterwheels and pumps. He was appointed as France's Inspector of Naval Shipbuilding in 1784, and with the assistance of the naval architect Jacques-No\u00ebl San\u00e9 in 1786 introduced a massive construction programme to revitalise the French navy based on the standard designs of San\u00e9.\nIn 1770, Borda formulated a ranked preferential voting system that is referred to as the Borda count. The French Academy of Sciences used Borda's method to elect its members for about two decades until it was quashed by Napoleon Bonaparte who insisted that his own method be used after he became president of the Acad\u00e9mie in 1801. The Borda count is in use today in some academic institutions, competitions and several political jurisdictions. The Borda count has also served as a basis for other methods such as the Quota Borda system, Black's method and Nanson's method.\nIn 1778, he published his method of reducing lunar distance for computing the longitude, still regarded as the best of several similar mathematical procedures for navigation and position fixing in pre-chronometer days. They were used, for example, by Lewis and Clark to measure their latitude and longitude during their exploration of the North-western United States.\nAnother of his contributions is his construction of the standard metre, basis of the metric system to correspond to the arc measurement of Delambre and M\u00e9chain.\nAs an instrument maker, he improved the reflecting circle (invented by Tobias Mayer) and the repeating circle (invented by his assistant, Etienne Lenoir), the latter used to measure the meridian arc from Dunkirk to Barcelona by Delambre and M\u00e9chain.\nTables of logarithms.\nWith the advent of the metric system, after the French Revolution it was decided that the quarter circle should be divided into 100 angular units, currently known as the \"gradian\", instead of 90 degrees, and the gradian into 100 centesimal minutes of arc (centigrades) instead of 60 arc-minutes. This required the calculation of trigonometric tables and logarithms corresponding to the new unit and instruments for measuring angles in the new system.\nBorda constructed instruments for measuring angles in the new units (the instrument could no longer be called a \"sextant\") which was later used in the arc measurement of the meridian between Dunkirk and Barcelona by Delambre to determine the radius of the Earth and thus define the length of the metre. The tables of logarithms of sines, secants, and tangents were also required for the purposes of navigation. Borda was an enthusiast for the metric system and constructed tables of these logarithms starting in 1792 but their publication was delayed until after his death and only published in the Year IX (1801) as \"Tables of Logarithms of sines, secants, and tangents, co-secants, co-sines, and co-tangents for the Quarter of the Circle divided into 100 degrees, the degree into 100 minutes, and the minute into 100 seconds\" to ten decimals, and including his tables of logarithms to 7 decimals from 10,000 to 100,000 with tables for obtaining results to 10 decimals.\nThe division of the degree into hundredths was accompanied by the division of the day into 10 hours of 100 minutes (decimal time) and maps were required to show the new degrees of latitude and longitude. The Republican Calendar was abolished by Napoleon in 1806, but the 400-unit circle lived on as the Gradian."}

The International Astronomical Union uses the name \"Albireo\" specifically for the brightest star in the system. Although designated 'beta', it is fainter than Gamma Cygni, Delta Cygni, and Epsilon Cygni and is the fifth-brightest point of light in the constellation of Cygnus. Appearing to the naked eye to be a single star of magnitude 3, viewing through even a low-magnification telescope resolves it into its two components. The brighter yellow star, itself a very close trinary system, makes a striking colour contrast with its fainter blue companion.\nNomenclature.\n\"\u03b2 Cygni\" (Latinised to \"Beta Cygni\") is the system's Bayer designation. The brighter of the two components is designated \"\u03b21 Cygni\" or \"Beta Cygni A\" and the fainter \"\u03b22 Cygni\" or \"Beta Cygni B\".\nThe origin of the star system's traditional name \"Albireo\" is unclear. Christian Ludwig Ideler traced it to https:// in Ptolemy's star catalog, in the translation of the Almagest by Gerard of Cremona: \"Stellatio Eurisim: et est volans; et jam vocatur gallina. et dicitur eurisim quasi redolens ut lilium ab ireo\" (\"Constellation Eurisim: and it is the Flyer, and it is also called the Hen, and it is called Eurisim as if redolent like the lily from the 'ireo'\"). (The original Greek just calls the constellation \"\u039f\u03c1\u03bd\u03b9\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2\", \"the constellation of the Bird\".) The word \"ireo\" is obscure as well\u00a0\u2013 Ideler suggests that Gerard took \"Eurisim\" to mean the plant \"Erysimum\", which is called \"irio\" in Latin, but the ablative case of that is not \"ireo\" but \"irione\". In any case, Ideler proposed that (somehow) the phrase \"ab ireo\" was applied to the star at the head of the bird, and this became \"Albireo\" when an \"l\" was mistakenly inserted as though it was an Arabic name. Ideler also supposed that the name Eurisim was a mistaken transliteration of the Arabic name \"Urnis\" for Cygnus (from the Greek \"\u039f\u03c1\u03bd\u03b9\u03c2\").\nIn 2016, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN's first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included \"Albireo \" for \u03b2\u00a0Cygni\u00a0Aa. It is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names.\nMedieval Arabic-speaking astronomers called Beta Cygni ' (English: \"the hen's beak\"). The term ' (\u0645\u0646\u0642\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u062c\u0627\u062c\u0629) or \"Menchir al Dedjadjet\" appeared in the catalogue of stars in the \"Calendarium of Al Achsasi Al Mouakket\", which was translated into Latin as \"Rostrum Gallinae\", meaning \"the hen's beak\".\nSince Cygnus is the swan, and Beta Cygni is located at the head of the swan, it is sometimes called the \"beak star\". With Deneb, Gamma Cygni (Sadr), Delta Cygni, and Epsilon Cygni (Gienah), it forms the asterism called the Northern Cross.\nProperties.\nBeta Cygni is about away from the Sun. When viewed with the naked eye, Albireo appears to be a single star. However, in a telescope it resolves into a double star consisting of \u03b2 Cygni A (amber, apparent magnitude 3.1), and \u03b2 Cygni B (blue-green, apparent magnitude 5.1). Separated by 35 seconds of arc, the two components provide one of the best contrasting double stars in the sky due to their different colors.\nIt is not known whether the two components \u03b2 Cygni A and B are orbiting around each other in a physical binary system, or if they are merely an optical double. If they are a physical binary, their orbital period is probably at least 100,000 years. Some experts, however, support the optical double argument, based on observations that suggest different proper motions for the components, which implies that they are unrelated. The primary and secondary also have different measured distances from the Hipparcos mission \u2013 for the primary and for the secondary. More recently the Gaia mission has measured distances of about 330\u2013390 light years (100\u2013120 parsecs) for both components, but noise in the astrometric measurements for the stars means that data from Gaia's second data release is not yet sufficient to determine whether the stars are physically associated.\nIn around 3.87 million years, Albireo will become the brightest star in the night sky. It will peak in brightness with an apparent magnitude of \u20130.53 in 4.61 million years.\nThere are a further 10 faint companions listed in the Washington Double Star catalogue, all fainter than magnitude 10. Only one is closer to the primary than Albireo B, with the others up to 142\" away.\nAlbireo A.\nThe spectrum of Beta Cygni A was found to be composite when it was observed as part of the Henry Draper Memorial project in the late 19th century, leading to the supposition that it was itself double. This was supported by observations from 1898 to 1918 which showed that it had a varying radial velocity. In 1923, the two components were identified in the Henry Draper Catalogue as HD 183912 and HD 183913.\nIn 1976 speckle interferometry was used to resolve a companion using the 2.1-meter telescope at the Kitt Peak National Observatory. It was measured at a separation of 0.44\", and it is noted that the observation was inconsistent with the Haute-Provence observations and hence not of the same star. Although these observations pre-dated those at Haute-Provence, they were not published until 1982 and this component is designated Ac in the Washington Double Star Catalog. It is designated as component C in the Catalog of Components of Double and Multiple Stars, not to be confused with component C in the Washington Double Star Catalog which is a faint optical companion. An orbit for the pair has since been computed using interferometric measurements, but as only approximately a quarter of the orbit has been observed, the orbital parameters must be regarded as preliminary. The period of this orbit is 214 years.\nIn 1978, speckle interferometry observations using the 1.93m telescope at the Haute-Provence Observatory alleged the detection of a companion at 0.125\". This observation was published in 1980, and the companion is referred to as component Ab in the Washington Double Star Catalog. Similarly, a star at 0.045\" was reported by speckle inferterometry in 2002. However, subsequent observations failed to confirm both stars, and the existence of Albireo Ab is now considered unlikely.\nIn 2022, a third component was found to be orbiting Albireo Aa, named Albireo Ad. It is a very-low-mass star with around 8.5% the Sun's mass and an orbital period of 371 days.\nThe diameter of the primary K-type giant star has been measured using interferometry from the Navy Precision Optical Interferometer. A limb-darkened angular diameter of was measured. At the parallax-derived distance of 111.4pc, a radius equivalent to 58.69\u00a0R\u2609 is calculated.\nIn 2023, the Gaia team announced that, during data analysis in preparation of Gaia DR4, they had confirmed a mass discrepancy in the Aa/Ac orbit. Gaia DR4 contains more data and improved binary star orbit analysis compared to previous releases; this enabled the first direct measurement of the acceleration upon Aa by Ac. The result is that Aa accelerates considerably more than can be explained by a 2.7 M\u2609 companion like Ac is presumed to be. Rather, Ac must be on the order of 5-7 M\u2609. The most \"obvious\" possibilities are that Ac is itself a very tight unresolved binary, either with a stellar companion or a compact object. Further investigation is required. The Aa acceleration discrepancy (as measured by proper motion history) was first noted in 2018.\nAlbireo B.\n\u03b2 Cygni B is a fast-rotating Be star, with an equatorial rotational velocity of at least 250 kilometers per second. Its surface temperature has been spectroscopically estimated to be about 13,200 K.\n\u03b2 Cygni B has been reported to be a very close double, but the observations appear to have been incorrect.\nMoving group.\nAnalysis of Gaia Data Release 2 astrometry suggests that four fainter stars may form a moving group along with the brighter visible components. The four are 14th, 15th, 16th, and 17th magnitudes, and are respectively 0.8\u00b0, 0.4\u00b0, 0.4\u00b0, and 3.7\u00b0 from Albireo. Analysis of their colours, brightnesses, and parallaxes shows all four to be cool stars much less luminous than the Sun.\nNamesakes.\n\"Albireo\" (AK-90) was a United States Navy \"Crater\"-class cargo ship named after the star.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "52750", "revid": "50197585", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52750", "title": "Basarab I of Wallachia", "text": "First independent ruler of Wallachia (r. c. 1310\u20131351/52)\nJohn Alexander Basarab I (), also known as Basarab the Founder (; c.\u20091270 \u2013 1351/1352), was a \"voivode\" and later the first independent ruler of Wallachia who lived in the first half of the 14th century. Many details of his life are uncertain. According to two popular theories, Basarab either came into power between 1304 and 1324 by dethroning or peacefully succeeding the legendary founder of Wallachia, Radu Negru, or in 1310 by succeeding his father, Thocomerius.\nA royal charter issued on 26 July 1324 is the first document to reference Basarab. According to the charter, he was subject to Charles I of Hungary as the \"voivode\" of Wallachia. Basarab became \"disloyal to the Holy Crown of Hungary\" in 1325. He seized the Banate of Severin and raided the southern regions of the Kingdom of Hungary. Basarab supported Michael Shishman of Bulgaria's attack against the Kingdom of Serbia, but their united armies were defeated in the Battle of Velbazhd on 28 July 1330. Soon after, Charles I of Hungary invaded Wallachia, but the Wallachians ambushed the royal troops in the Battle of Posada, between the 9 and 12 November 1330, nearly annihilating the entire force, subsequently ending Hungarian suzerainty in Wallachia, allowing the foundation of the first independent Romanian principality. Basarab's descendants ruled Wallachia for at least two centuries. The region of Bessarabia, situated between the rivers Dniester and Prut, was named for the Basarab dynasty.\nOrigins.\nBasarab was the son of Thocomerius, according to a charter written by Charles I of Hungary in 1332. Thocomerius' social position cannot be determined. A scholarly hypothesis states that he was descended from Seneslau, a mid-13th-century Vlach (Romanian) lord. Historian Vlad Georgescu writes that Thocomerius was the probable successor to B\u0103rbat, the late 13th-century ruler of Oltenia. Historian Tudor S\u0103l\u0103gean says that Thocomerius was \"a local potentate.\"\nBasarab's name is of Turkic origin. Its first part is the present participle for the verb \"bas-\" (\"press, rule, govern\"); the second part matches the Turkic honorific title \"aba\" or \"oba\" (\"father, elder kinsman\"), which can be recognized in Cuman names, such as Terteroba, Arslanapa and Ursoba. Basarab's name implies that he was of Cuman or Pecheneg ancestry, but this hypothesis has not been proven. At least four royal charters from the 14th century refer to Basarab as a Vlach. Charles I of Hungary referred to him as \"Basarab, our disloyal Vlach\" in 1332.\nPope John XXII addressed Basarab as a \"devout Catholic prince\" in a letter written on 1 February 1327. On the same day, the pope sent similar letters to Charles I of Hungary and his high officials, including Thomas Sz\u00e9cs\u00e9nyi, the voivode of Transylvania, and Mikcs \u00c1kos, the ban of Slavonia, asking them to support the Dominicans' actions against the \"heretics\". According to scholar Neagu Djuvara, this correspondence with the Holy See proves that Basarab was a Catholic, which also testifies to Basarab's Cuman origin, because the Cumans had been baptized according to Catholic rite. Historians Matei Cazacu and Dan Mure\u0219an reject Djuvara's theory, saying that all other sources prove that Basarab was an Eastern Orthodox. For instance, the \"Illuminated Chronicle\", completed in the late 1350s, referred to Basarab as a \"perfidious schismatic.\"\nReign.\nCharles I's \"voivode\".\nThe details of Basarab's accession are obscure. Early Romanian chronicles attribute the establishment of Wallachia to the legendary Radu Negru. According to 17th-century Wallachian chronicles, Radu Negru, after departing from F\u0103g\u0103ra\u0219, arrived in Wallachia in either 1290 or 1292, accompanied by \"many peoples\". One of those chronicles, \"Istoria \u021a\u0103rii Rom\u00e2ne\u0219ti\", states that \"Basarab\" was the surname of an Oltenian boyar family, who accepted Radu Negru's suzerainty following his \"dismounting\". Historian Neagu Djuvara tentatively associates Basarab (or, alternatively, Basarab's father) with Radu Negru; Lauren\u021biu R\u0103dvan writes that Basarab either dethroned or peacefully succeeded Radu Negru between 1304 and 1324. Other historians, such as Vlad Georgescu, state that Basarab succeeded his father, Thocomerius, around 1310.\nBasarab was first mentioned in a royal charter issued by Charles I of Hungary on 26 July 1324, in which he was described as \"our voivode of Wallachia\". This shows that Charles I regarded Basarab as a loyal vassal at that time. Historian Istv\u00e1n V\u00e1s\u00e1ry states that Basarab only accepted Charles' suzerainty after the king restored royal authority in the Banate of Severin, a Hungarian border province, in 1321. In exchange for his loyalty, Basarab's possession of Severin Fort was confirmed, according to historians Tudor S\u0103l\u0103gean and Attila B\u00e1r\u00e1ny.\nTowards independence.\nA royal charter dated 18 June 1325 records that a person named Stephen, who was the son of a Cuman \"isp\u00e1n\" in Hungary, stated that the king was weaker than Basarab and \"did not even reach up to [his] ankle\". The same charter describes Basarab as \"disloyal to the Holy Crown of Hungary\", showing that Basarab had betrayed the crown. A royal charter from 1329 listed Basarab, along with the Bulgarians, Serbs and Tatars, as an enemy who \"[made] hostile inroads\" around Mehadia. Basarab seems to have entirely controlled the Banate of Severin between 1324 and 1330, since royal charters did not mention a Ban of Severin during this period. In a letter written in 1327, Pope John XXII alluded to \"territories of the Kingdom of Hungary which were subjected\" to Basarab.\nMichael III Shishman, Tsar of Bulgaria, attacked Serbia in 1330. He was accompanied by \"the ruler of the Yas\", along with Vlach and \"black Tatar\" auxiliary troops. According to Serbian sources and a letter written by Stephen Du\u0161an, who became King of Serbia in 1331, Basarab personally led his army to Serbia to assist Shishman. The Serbs routed the united army of Michael Shishman and his allies at the Battle of Velbazhd on 28 July 1330. Shishman was killed while fleeing from the battlefield.\nTaking advantage of the weakened state of Basarab's allies, Charles I of Hungary decided to restore his suzerainty in Wallachia. According to a royal charter issued two years after the events, Charles wanted to recapture \"marginal lands\" that Basarab \"illegally\" held in Wallachia. He invaded Oltenia, captured Severin Fort and appointed Denis Sz\u00e9csi Ban of Severin in September 1330. According to the \"Illuminated Chronicle\", Basarab offered 7,000 \"marks of silver\" as compensation, along with a yearly tribute to the king. He also promised to send one of his sons to the royal court in Visegr\u00e1d.\nHowever, Charles I refused Basarab's offer, saying that \"[h]e is the shepherd of my sheep, and I will drag him by his beard from his lair\". Charles continued his campaign, but he and his soldiers suffered from hunger while marching to Curtea de Arge\u0219 through a sparsely populated region. Charles was compelled to sign an armistice with Basarab, and the royal army started retreating from Wallachia. On 9 November, however, the Wallachians ambushed the king and his soldiers at a narrow pass in the Southern Carpathians. Standing on the cliffs above the valley, the Wallachians shot arrows and threw rocks upon the army. The battle lasted until 12 November. The royal army was decimated, and King Charles narrowly escaped. Historian S\u0103l\u0103gean writes that Basarab repelled Charles' invasion without assistance from his allies. A charter written in 1351 by Louis I, Charles' son and successor, states that pagan \"neighbors and a troop formed of other subjects unfaithful\" to Charles supported Basarab during the war, suggesting that Tatar auxiliaries fought for Basarab. However, the credibility of the report, written decades after the events, is uncertain.\nIndependent ruler.\nArchaeological research shows that after his capital of Curtea de Arge\u0219 was destroyed during Charles I's campaign, Basarab moved his seat to C\u00e2mpulung. Basarab's victory in the Battle of Posada enabled the introduction of an active foreign policy. He supported the efforts of his son-in-law, Ivan Alexander, to seize the Bulgarian crown, which he did in February 1331. With Basarab's support, Ivan Alexander successfully campaigned against the Byzantine Empire in 1331 and 1332. According to S\u0103l\u0103gean, Basarab allegedly took possession of Severin Fort in the early 1330s.\nThe reconstruction of Curtea de Arge\u0219 started after 1340, with the erection of new fortifications and a new palace. The construction of the Princely Church of Saint Nicholas in Curtea de Arge\u0219 also commenced during Basarab's rule, but it was completed after his death. Basarab seems to have made his son, Nicholas Alexander, his co-ruler around 1344. Louis I of Hungary, who had succeeded Charles I in 1342, marched to southeastern Transylvania in the summer of 1344. To prevent a campaign against Wallachia, Nicholas Alexander visited Louis I and swore loyalty to him, according to the nearly contemporaneous John of K\u00fck\u00fcll\u0151's chronicle. Wallachian troops supported Andrew Lackfi's attack against the Mongols in 1345, according to a Wallachian chronicle, but historian Victor Spinei rejects this report. According to a charter of his grandson, Vladislav I Vlaicu, Basarab died in the year 6860 of the Byzantine calendar, which is AD 1351 or 1352.\nFamily.\nA diptych from C\u00e2mpulung contains a reference to \"\"Io\" Basarab voivode and his wife, Marghita\". Although the diptych (which was revised and renewed in 1710) may contain a scribal error, historians tend to accept that Basarab's wife was named Marghita (from Margarete). According to Wallachian folklore, Marghita was the Catholic wife of the legendary founder of Wallachia, Radu Negru. She was told to have erected a Catholic church in C\u00e2mpulung, and committed suicide after the church was destroyed on her husband's order.\nIn his letter concerning the Battle of Velbazhd, Stephen Du\u0161an mentioned that Basarab was \"the father-in-law of Tsar Alexander of Bulgaria\", showing that Basarab's daughter, Theodora, was Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria's wife. Historian V\u00e1s\u00e1ry states that Basarab married her to Ivan Alexander around 1323 to strengthen his alliance with Bulgaria. She gave birth to children, but Ivan Alexander abandoned her and married a converted Jew, Sarah-Theodora, in the 1350s. Basarab's son and successor, Nicholas Alexander, discontinued Basarab's alliance with Bulgaria.\nLegacy.\nBasarab's victory at the Battle of Posada was a turning point in the history of Wallachia. S\u0103l\u0103gean writes that the victory \"sanctioned the independence of Wallachia from the Hungarian crown\" and altered its international status. Georgescu describes Wallachia as the \"first independent Romanian principality.\" Although the kings of Hungary continued to demand loyalty from the voivodes of Wallachia, Basarab and his successors yielded to them only temporarily in the 14th century.\nThe descendants of Basarab ruled Wallachia for at least two centuries. Examples of his descendants include Mircea the Old and Vlad Dracula. Neagoe Basarab, a member of the Craiove\u0219ti boyar family, forged a genealogy to prove that he was a descendant of Basarab, and adopted \"Basarab\" as his family name after his accession in 1512.\nFrom the middle of the 14th century, Bulgarian, Hungarian, Moldavian and Serbian chronicles used the name \"Basarab\" when referring to Wallachia. From the next century onward, the southern region of the land between the Dniester and Prut rivers was named \"Basarabia\". After the Russian Empire annexed Basarabia in 1812, the region was renamed to Bessarabia. The region is now part of the Republic of Moldova.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\nPrimary sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSecondary sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Heep is the primary antagonist during the second part of the novel. His character is notable for his sycophancy.\nIn the novel.\nDavid first meets the 15-year-old Heep when he comes to live with Mr. Wickfield and his daughter Agnes.\nUriah is a law clerk working for Mr. Wickfield. He realises that his widowed employer has developed a severe drinking problem and turns it to his advantage. Uriah encourages Wickfield's drinking, tricks him into thinking he has committed financial wrongdoing while drunk, and blackmails him into making Uriah a partner in his law office. He admits to David (whom he hates) that he intends to manipulate Agnes into marrying him.\nUriah miscalculates when he hires Mr. Micawber as a clerk, assuming Micawber will never risk his own financial security by exposing Uriah's transgressions. Yet Micawber is honest, and he, David, and Tommy Traddles confront Uriah with proof of his frauds. They let Uriah go free only after he had (reluctantly) agreed to resign his position and return the money that he had stolen.\nLater in the novel, David encounters Uriah for the last time. In prison for bank fraud and awaiting transportation, Uriah acts like a repentant model prisoner.

Uriah Heep's schemes and behaviour could also be based on Thomas Powell, an employee of Thomas Chapman, a friend of Dickens'. Powell \"ingratiated himself into the Dickens household\" and was discovered to be a forger and a thief, having embezzled \u00a310,000 from his employer.

{"id": "52753", "revid": "9486271", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52753", "title": "Final Fantasy II", "text": "1988 video game\nborder\n is a 1988 role-playing video game developed and published by Square for the Family Computer as the second installment of the \"Final Fantasy\" series. It was ported to and remade for WonderSwan Color, PlayStation, Game Boy Advance, PlayStation Portable, and mobile phones. Originally exclusive to Japan, later versions were released internationally, including the 2021 \"Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster\" version. The story follows the warrior Firion and his allies as they join a rebellion against the expanding Palamecian Empire. The gameplay is similar to the original game with an overworld and dungeon exploration, but its combat design is changed to a usage-based growth system where characters' statistics increase according to how they are used or acquired.\nThe game began development after the success of \"Final Fantasy\", with the team using a new setting to make the game accessible to players. Returning staff included series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi as director, designer Akitoshi Kawazu, programmer Nasir Gebelli, artist Yoshitaka Amano, writer Kenji Terada, and composer Nobuo Uematsu. The team wanted to create a game that was different from the first \"Final Fantasy\", including creating a narrative that drew inspiration from \"The Empire Strikes Back\" (1980), and redesigning the combat system. The stat growth system was created by Kawazu, and he later felt the team went too far in making the game different from the original.\nUpon its release, \"Final Fantasy II\" received highly positive reviews in Japan; retrospective reviews have noted the game as having a stronger story than \"Final Fantasy\", but have described it as among the most divisive entries in the series due to its progression system. As of 2003, the game sold over one million copies worldwide. \"Final Fantasy II\" saw the introduction of multiple series staples including chocobos and the recurring character Cid. Due to negative feedback, the next title \"Final Fantasy III\" (1990) reverted to the original combat system. Kawazu would continue using his system in the \"SaGa\" series, beginning with 1989's \"Makai Tosho SaGa\" (\"The Final Fantasy Legend\") for the Game Boy.\nGameplay.\n\"Final Fantasy II\" features gameplay similar to that of its predecessor, \"Final Fantasy\". The player can freely roam an overworld containing several towns and dungeons. A menu-based system allows the player to outfit each character with equipment and up to two\u2014often disposable\u2014items for battle. Magic spells are assigned to the character from the item menu, and certain spells, such as \"Cure\" can be used outside of battle. The player can also save their progress on the overworld. Weapons, armor, items, and magic spells can be purchased at shops, and townspeople provide useful information for the player's progression through the game. One new feature is the \"Word Memory\" system: when in conversation with non-player characters (NPCs), the player can \"ask\" about and \"memorize\" special keywords or phrases, which can later be repeated to other NPCs to gain more information or unlock new actions. Similarly, there exist a handful of special items that can be shown to NPCs during conversation or used on certain objects, which have the same effect. Characters and monsters are no longer separated into separate windows in the battle screen as they were in the first \"Final Fantasy\", and players can see their current and total hit points below the battle. Players can also fight with less than four characters in their party, which was not possible in the first game. \"Final Fantasy II\" introduced the chocobo, the signature \"Final Fantasy\" mascot, which lets characters ride to a location at great speed without being attacked by enemies. The recurring character Cid was also introduced, and a character of the same name has appeared in every main-series game since.\nOn the overworld and within dungeons, random encounters with enemies can be fought to improve each character's attributes. Unlike the original \"Final Fantasy\", players cannot upgrade their characters' classes. The game is also one of the few games in the series to not use experience-based levels. Instead, each character participating in battle develops depending on what actions they take. For instance, characters who frequently use a particular type of weapon will become more adept at wielding a weapon of that type, and will also increase in physical strength and accuracy. Attributes include hit points, magic points, magic power, stamina, strength, spirit, agility, intelligence, and evasion. Hit points (HP) and magic points (MP) increase with their use; a character who takes a heavy amount of damage in a battle might earn an increase in maximum HP, while a character who uses a lot of MP during battle might increase their maximum MP. This experience system had several unintended consequences that allowed characters to gain much more experience than intended, such as players having their characters attack each other and repeatedly cast spells, thus causing their HP and abilities to grow extensively. \"Final Fantasy II\" uses the same turn-based battle system seen in the original \"Final Fantasy\", with battle parties consisting of up to four characters at a time. The game introduces a \"back row\" in battle, within which characters or enemies are immune to most physical attacks, but can be harmed with bows and magical attacks.\nPlot.\nSetting and characters.\n\"Final Fantasy II\" is set in a fantasy world divided between multiple nations, including the Palamecian Empire and the kingdom of Fynn. During the game's events, the Palamecian Empire has begun a ruthless expansion, conquering or destroying its neighbours including the kingdom of Kashuan and the dragoon homeland of Deist. A rebellion is formed to fight against the Empire's expansion, headquartered at Fynn Castle. The game's inciting incident is an attack by the Empire that destroys Fynn Castle and the surrounding town.\n\"Final Fantasy II\" features four playable characters as well as several secondary characters who are only briefly controlled by the player. The four main characters are Firion (\"Frioniel\" in the Japanese release), a young man skilled in fighting; his childhood friend Maria; Guy, a man formally raised by wolves before becoming friends with Firion and Guy; and Leon, Maria's brother and temporary ally of the Empire. Other notable characters are Hilda, leader of the rebel army; Minwu, a mage serving Hilda's family; Gordon, heir to the throne of Kashuan; Josef, a villager in the town of Salamand; Leila, a pirate who joins the rebellion later; and Ricard Highwind, last of the dragoons. The main antagonist is the Emperor of Palamecia, a powerful mage who seeks to conquer the world and summons monsters from Hell to achieve this.\nStory.\nFirion, Maria, Guy, and Leon are attacked by Palamecian Black Knight soldiers and left for dead. Firion, Maria, and Guy are rescued by Princess Hilda, who has established a rebel base in the town of Altair after her kingdom of Fynn was invaded by the Emperor. Hilda denies their request to join the rebel army because they are too young and inexperienced. The three set off for Fynn in search of Leon; there, they find a dying Prince Scott of Kashuan, Hilda's fianc\u00e9, who informs them that a former nobleman of Kashuan, Borghen, betrayed the rebellion and became a general in the Imperial army. The party returns to Altair to notify Hilda. She allows the group to join the rebellion and asks them to journey north to find mythril, a metal that could be used to create powerful weapons. The party makes its way north to the occupied village of Salamand, where they save the villagers forced to work in the nearby mines, kill Borghen, and retrieve the Mythril.\nFor their next mission, the party is sent to the city of Bafsk to prevent the construction of a large airship known as the Dreadnought; however, it takes off just as they arrive. After retrieving the Sunfire, a weapon that can blow up the Dreadnought, they watch helplessly as an airship with Hilda on board is captured by the Dreadnought. When the Dreadnought lands to stock up on supplies, the party rescues Hilda and throws the Sunfire into the airship's engine. Before escaping the explosion, the party encounters a dark knight Maria recognizes as Leon.\nOn his deathbed, the king of Fynn tasks the party to seek the help of the seemingly extinct dragoons of Deist. There, the party finds only a mother with her son, learning that all but one of the dragoons are dead, partly as a result of imperial poison. After placing an egg of the last wyvern in a cavern, the party returns to Altair and finds the Hilda they rescued is a lamia in disguise. The party slays the imposter and rescues the real Hilda before successfully reclaiming Fynn from the imperial forces. They then travel west, searching for a powerful magic item, joining forces with the last surviving dragoon. The party returns to Fynn and sees that many towns have been destroyed by a cyclone summoned by the Emperor. The party calls upon the newly born last wyvern to take them to a castle inside the cyclone, where they confront and kill the Emperor. Everyone celebrates the Empire's defeat until a mortally wounded Fynn soldier arrives and reveals that Leon has taken the throne and plans to destroy the rebels with the Imperial army.\nThe party enters the castle of Palamecia and confronts Leon. The Emperor reappears in the throne room in a new demonic form, revealing he has become the ruler of Hell and returned to destroy the entire world. Ricard sacrifices himself to allow the party to escape with Leon and the wyvern. Palamecia Castle transforms into Pandaemonium, the capital of Hell. Leon agrees to help the group seal the Emperor away. The party travels to the Jade Passage, an underground passage to the underworld, and finds the portal to Pandaemonium, where they finally defeat the Emperor. Afterward, Leon chooses to leave in response to the trouble he caused, though Firion assures him that he will be welcomed back if and when he returns.\nIn the \"Dawn of Souls\", an extra story follows the spirits of Minwu, Josef, Scott and Ricard as they arrive in Arubboth, the palace of Heaven and twin to Pandaemonium where the group encounter the spirits of those the Empire killed. They eventually reach the top of Arubboth and find the Emperor's \"light side\" which split from his dark counterpart in Pandaemonium when Firion killed him. He offers them eternal life in return for their forgiveness, but visions of their loved ones convince them that the Light Emperor is just as evil as the Emperor of Hell. The party defeat the Light Emperor, and their spirits visit the living world one last time to watch the celebrations before fading away.\nDevelopment.\nProduction of \"Final Fantasy II\" began after the success of the original \"Final Fantasy\", with its developer and publisher Square having increased the number of copies manufactured to fund a sequel. According to Akitoshi Kawazu, after the first game's release there was a wish to do something different. The game's staff expanded a little compared to the first game, but it was still a relatively small team of around ten people. Series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi was director, and Kawazu co-designed with Hiromichi Tanaka and Koichi Ishii, The producer was Masafumi Miyamoto, founder and former president of Square. Programmer Nasir Gebelli returned from the first game. Due to his work visa expiring, Gebelli needed to return to Sacramento, California, so the team followed with the appropriate equipment so production could be finished with him.\nYoshitaka Amano returned to create character, monster and promotional art; as with the previous game, Amano created the monster design concepts using black and white ink drawings. Kazuko Shibuya was in charge of designing all the sprite art, although multiple artists helped create the game's monster designs. A notable addition was the Chocobo, designed by Ishii based on a chicken he had kept as a childhood pet. When he presented the Chocobo concept as a constant companion for the party, Sakaguchi rejected it and instead incorporated it as a mount. Another creature designed by Ishii for the game, the Moogle, was ultimately left out due to there being no place in the story for them. Their sprite work was redesigned into a different enemy. During production, there were arguments between staff members as the constant addition of monsters to the game prevented a master build being completed.\nKenji Terada returned as scenario writer, and he recalled there being resistance within Square to making the game a numbered sequel due to not continuing the original's world and story. The team decided to carry over some elements from the first, such as crystals, while creating a new story so players could buy the game without issue. Sakaguchi recalled creating the initial premise after watching \"The Empire Strikes Back\" (1980), carrying over the concept of a rebel faction facing an evil empire. Terada wrote his script inspired by the request of a young staff member for a story that would bring tears to his eyes, so wrote it to focus on tangled human relationships. One character created who would be a recurring figure was the engineer Cid, who was created to be an intelligent and wise figure \"like Yoda from the \"Star Wars\" series\".\nUsing the experience gained from the first installment, which focused more on fitting story ideas into their new gameplay system and game world, the developers fully crafted the story of \"Final Fantasy II\" first. The gameplay was then built around the narrative. Sakaguchi remembered that the combat system was Kawazu's original idea. The usage-based growth mechanic was originally created to tie into the story-driven style being used, with players naturally evolving into certain classes rather than having it chosen at the outset. He also expressed his frustration with the abstract nature of experience point systems, wanting something unpredictable for players. The goal for a game that was different from the original, with Kawazu later feeling they had become so invested in that goal that they strayed too far and corrected back to a traditional model for later titles. He also remembered being the only one who understood it among the staff.\nMusic.\nThe music for \"Final Fantasy II\" was originally composed by Nobuo Uematsu, who worked on the original game. As with the first \"Final Fantasy\", Uematsu had a limited number of sound channels to work with on the Famicom, and also had to work round space limitations with the amount of songs he could include. He remembered the restriction to three-note cords on the Famicom sparked his creativity when composing the score. A notable theme created for the game was for when the characters rode a Chocobo, which would be carried forward with different musical styles in later entries.\nThe music was later arranged by Tsuyoshi Sekito for the WonderSwan Color, PlayStation, and Game Boy Advance remakes. Although the two soundtracks were composed separately, the soundtrack to \"II\" has only been released as a combined album with the soundtrack to \"Final Fantasy I\". They were first released as \"All Sounds of Final Fantasy I\u2022II\" in 1989, which was then republished in 1994. An arranged album of music from the two soundtracks titled \"Symphonic Suite Final Fantasy\" was also released in 1989, while \"Final Fantasy &amp; Final Fantasy II Original Soundtrack\", a combined soundtrack album for the PlayStation versions of the games, was released in 2002 and re-released in 2004. The music of \"Final Fantasy II\" has also appeared in various official concerts and live albums, such as \"20020220 music from Final Fantasy\", a live recording of an orchestra performing music from the series including several pieces from the games. Additionally, several songs from the game were performed as part of a medley by the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra for the \"Distant Worlds \u2013 Music from Final Fantasy\" concert tour, while a different medley of songs from the game were performed by the New Japan Philharmonic Orchestra in the \"Tour de Japon: Music from Final Fantasy\" concert series.\nRelease.\n\"Final Fantasy II\" was released on December 17, 1988, noted as being close to the same date as the original game the previous year. The original version was ported in Japan onto a number of systems including onto Nintendo's Virtual Console platform for Wii (June 16, 2009) and the Wii U (December 11, 2013).\nFollowing the successful North American release of the original \"Final Fantasy\" by Nintendo in 1990, Square's North American subsidiary began work on an English localization, to be called \"Final Fantasy II: Dark Shadow Over Palakia\". Assigned to the project was Kaoru Moriyama, whose later work included script translations for \"Final Fantasy IV\" and \"Secret of Mana\" (known as \"Seiken Densetsu 2\" in Japan). Although a beta version was produced, and the game was advertised in several Square Soft trade publications, the long development time, the age of the original Japanese game and the arrival of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, the NES's successor console, led Square Soft to cancel work on the \"Final Fantasy II\" localization in favor of the recently released \"Final Fantasy IV\" (which, to avoid confusing North American players, was retitled \"Final Fantasy II\").\nAlthough a prototype cartridge of the English NES \"Final Fantasy II\" was produced, the project was, by Moriyama's own admission, still far from complete: \"We had so very limited memory capacity we could use for each game, and it was never really \"translating\" but chopping up the information and cramming them back in... [Additionally] our boss had no understanding in putting in extra work for the English version at that time\". A fan translation of the original game was created using an original translation as the existence of the prototype cartridge was not common knowledge at the time. The first international release of its original version came as part of the \"Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster\" series, initially releasing on Windows and mobile platforms on July 28, 2021.\nRemakes.\n\"Final Fantasy II\" was ported to the WonderSwan Color as part of a deal with Bandai to bring the first three \"Final Fantasy\" titles to the console; Square was one of the major supporters for the WonderSwan platform during its tenure. The port was released on May 3, 2001. Its visuals were updated for the platform, and it was included as a bundle with a special themed edition of the console. A PlayStation version released as a standalone by Square in Japan on October 31, 2002. It was bundled together with the original game and released as \"Final Fantasy Origins\" on March 14, 2003 in Europe by Infogrames, and on April 8 in North America by the newly-formed Square Enix. The PlayStation version was the first time the game releases in English and came with reworked graphics, a new CGI opening cutscene, a monster database, and art gallery. The port was re-released as part of the \"Final Fantasy 25th Anniversary Ultimate Box\" package in December 2012. Both the WonderSwan Color and PlayStation ports were handled by Kan Navi.\nAn expanded remake of the game was released for the Game Boy Advance (GBA) bundled with the original game under the title \"Final Fantasy I &amp; II: Dawn of Souls\" in 2004. It was published by Square Enix in Japan on July 29, then by Nintendo on November 29 in North America and December 10 in Europe. The port was produced by Takashi Tokita, and developed by Square Enix's Development Division 7 and Tose. The remake included redrawn sprite artwork and adjustments to bring in-game terminology in line with the rest of the series. The gameplay was left unchanged, as Tokita considered it a hallmark of Kawazu's design. The new storyline was intended by Tokita to shine a spotlight on characters that had relatively little presence in the main narrative such as Minwu, who was made the new scenario's lead character. The character art was redrawn by Gen Kobayashi. The redrawn characters were made cuter compared to their original versions to be more appealing to children.\nIn 2005 and 2006, Square Enix released a version of \"Final Fantasy II\" for three Japanese mobile phone networks. To celebrate the \"Final Fantasy\" series' 20th anniversary, the game was released in Japan for the PlayStation Portable in 2007. The remake features improved graphics, the cutscenes and soundtrack from \"Final Fantasy Origins\", and the bonus quest and dungeons from the GBA release. It additionally includes four new dungeons in which more character-specific equipment can be found, alongside powerful enemies and two new bosses. On February 25, 2010, Square Enix released a port of the PSP version modified with touchscreen controls for the iOS platform.\nReception.\nAccording to Square, the original Famicom release sold 800,000 copies. As of March 2003, the game, including all re-releases at the time, had shipped 1.28 million copies worldwide, with 1.08 million of those copies being shipped in Japan and 200,000 abroad. As of September 2007 the PlayStation Portable version had shipped 90,000 copies in Japan and 70,000 in North America.\nUpon release, \"Famicom Ts\u016bshin\" (now \"Famitsu\") gave the original Famicom version a score of 35 out of 40, based on a panel of four reviewers giving it ratings of 9, 9, 9 and 8 out of 10. This made it one of their three highest-rated games of 1988, along with \"Dragon Quest III\" (which scored 38/40) and \"Super Mario Bros. 3\" (which scored 35/40). It was also one of the magazine's five highest-rated games up until 1988, along with \"Dragon Quest II\" (which scored 38/40) and \"\" (which scored 36/40). The 1989 \"All Soft Catalog\" issue of \"Famicom Ts\u016bshin\" included \"Final Fantasy II\" in its list of the best games of all time, giving it the Best Scenario award. Retrospectively, G4 described the stat-building system as an \"Innovation\", noting that \"computer RPGs took the \"level\" system wholesale from tabletop role-playing games and made it a genre staple, but \"FF2\" eliminated levels altogether\", but that what \"sounds novel at first wound up being a huge mess\".\n\"Famitsu\" magazine scored the WonderSwan version of the game a 30 out of 40, and GameSpot noted the \"Dawn of Souls\"' mostly outdated graphics but praised its length and bonus content. IGN noted the great improvement in the translation of the story over \"Final Fantasy I\" and the addition of later \"Final Fantasy\" features, such as being able to save anywhere in the overworld map without a tent or cabin. The \"Dawn of Souls\" release was named the IGN Game Boy \"Game of the Month\" for March 2004, and the package was rated 76th in \"Nintendo Power\"'s Top 200 Games list. The dialogue system was thought to be time-consuming and stilted, but was still a milestone for interactivity. The story was considered to be much more involved and deep than the first \"Final Fantasy\", as it involved romance and the death of characters. The game's plot was thought by some reviewers to mirror elements of \"Star Wars: A New Hope\" in its use of an orphan joining a rebellion against an empire that was building a massive ship, with a captive princess inside. GameSpy praised the addition of the ability to save the game at any time, calling the feature crucial for a game on a handheld game console, and in contrast to GameSpot, praised the graphics, saying that while they were primitive, they were \"well-suited\" to the Game Boy Advance. The game's leveling system was re-used in the \"SaGa\" series.\nThe PSP version was met with generally average reviews. GameSpot described the \"more intriguing\" story and \"key words\" system as \"notable\" in \"the evolution of the series and genre\" but called the level up system \"chaotic\" and noted that unlike previous versions, this was shipped without a version of \"Final Fantasy I\". IGN described the \"dialogue and story\" as \"much more interesting than\" its predecessor and the \"proficiency system not unlike what's found in \"The Elder Scrolls\"\" as a \"semi-innovation\" for its time, but also complained about the gameplay. Both sources praised the graphics, however. GameSpy, while echoing similar complaints about the \"quirky and sometimes confusing\" leveling system and praises for the graphics, also applauded the supposed decrease in difficulty of the game, which in the reviewers' opinion eliminated the necessity to abuse the leveling system in order to progress in the game as the player had to do in the original game.\nThe Pixel Remaster of \"Final Fantasy II\" received mostly positive reviews. It received a score of 77/100 on Metacritic, and on \"OpenCritic\", 81% of critics recommended the game. Jenni Lada of \"Siliconera\" gave the release a 7 out of 10, and felt it had aged the best out of the first three \"Final Fantasy\" games, citing it as \"an entry that dared to be different\" while praising its leveling system and story. Conversely, Chris Shive of \"Hardcore Gamer\" described it as \"one of the weaker titles in the franchise\" and felt it \"[suffered] from a bit of middle child syndrome\", but praised the story as being \"vastly expanded on from the first game\". Audra Bowling of \"RPGFan\" gave the release a score of 72 out of 100. She described the game as \"divisive\" and \"the eccentric cousin\" of the \"Final Fantasy\" series, and bemoaned the dungeons as \"extremely poor\" and \"nightmarish affairs\", but praised the story as being \"strong for the era\". Robert Ramsay of \"Push Square\" gave the fame a score of six out of ten, describing it as the \"best version of a divisive Final Fantasy\".\n\"Nintendo World Report\" writer Donald Theriault gave the game a score of 6.5 out of 10, and praised the release for including quality-of-life features that \"make the game something I could finish without cursing the whole way\". Shaun Musgrave of \"TouchArcade\" gave the game 3.5 stars out of 5, calling it a \"lovely remake of a game that people tend to either love or hate\". He praised the game's story, but felt the Game Boy Advance version was superior due to the exclusion of the \"Dawn of Souls\" story from the Pixel Remaster.\nLegacy.\nA novelization \"Final Fantasy II: The Labyrinth of Nightmares\" was written by Terada and illustrated by Amano. It was published in Japan by Kadokawa Sneaker Bunko on March 20, 1989. A second novelization written by Takashi Umemura, which novelised the events of the first three \"Final Fantasy\" games, was published in Japan by Square Enix in 2019 and by Yen Press worldwide in 2020.\nMutliple elements introduced in \"Final Fantasy II\", including the character Cid and the chocobo, would become recurring staples of later \"Final Fantasy\" titles. Firion and the Emperor were the respective hero and villain representing \"Final Fantasy II\" in the fighting game spin-off \"Dissidia Final Fantasy\" (2009) and its sequels. The Emperor also featured as a character in the \"Different Future\" downloadable content expansion for \"\" (2022).\nDue to both negative feedback and a lack of understanding within Square's staff outside Kawazu himself, the following game \"Final Fantasy III\" (1990) reverted to the more traditional role-playing systems of the original \"Final Fantasy\". Kawazu would continue working with usage-based stat increases in his next project, \"Makai Tosho SaGa\" (\"The Final Fantasy Legend\"), released in 1989 for the Game Boy. This would become the first entry in the \"SaGa\" series, with Kawazu being heavily involved in most entries.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "52754", "revid": "1317872838", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52754", "title": "Final Fantasy IV", "text": "1991 video game\nborder\n titled Final Fantasy II in its initial North American release, is a 1991 role-playing video game developed and published by Square for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It is the fourth main installment of the \"Final Fantasy\" series. The game's story follows Cecil Harvey, a dark knight, as he tries to prevent the sorcerer Golbez from seizing powerful crystals and destroying the world. He is joined on this quest by a frequently changing group of allies. \"Final Fantasy IV\" introduced innovations that became staples of the \"Final Fantasy\" series and role-playing games in general. Its \"Active Time Battle\" system was used in five subsequent \"Final Fantasy\" games, and unlike prior games in the series, \"Final Fantasy IV\" gave each character their own unchangeable character class \u2014 although at a few points in the story, members of the cast change or evolve their vocation to suit the narrative.\n\"Final Fantasy IV\" has been ported to several other platforms with varying differences. A 3D remake of the same name was released for the Nintendo DS in 2007. The game was re-titled \"Final Fantasy II\" during its initial release outside Japan as the actual \"II\" and \"III\" had not been released outside Japan at the time. All later localizations of \"Final Fantasy IV\", which began to appear after \"Final Fantasy VII\" (released worldwide under that title), used the original title.\nThe various incarnations of the game have sold more than four million copies worldwide. A sequel, ', was released for Japanese mobile phones in 2008, and worldwide via the Wii Shop Channel on June 1, 2009. In 2011, both \"Final Fantasy IV\" and \"The After Years\" were released for the PlayStation Portable as part of the compilation ', which also included a new game, set between the two; \"Final Fantasy IV: Interlude\". Ports of the Nintendo DS remake were released for iOS in 2012, for Android in 2013 and for Windows in 2014. Another enhanced port of \"Final Fantasy IV\" was released as part of the \"Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster\" compilation series for iOS, Android and Windows in 2021, for Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 in 2023, and for Xbox Series X/S in 2024.\n\"Final Fantasy IV\" was well received and was praised for its graphics, story, characters, and soundtrack. It is often regarded as one of the greatest video games of all time. Many critics have noted that it pioneered many now common console role-playing game features, including the concept of dramatic storytelling in an RPG.\nGameplay.\nIn \"Final Fantasy IV\", the player controls a large cast of characters and completes quests to advance the story. Characters move and interact with people and objects on a field map, which may represent a variety of settings, such as towers, caves, and forests. Travel between areas occurs on the overworld. The player can use towns to replenish strength, buy equipment, and discover clues about their next destination. Conversely, the player fights monsters at random intervals on the overworld and in dungeons. In battle, the player has the option to fight, use magic or an item, retreat, change character positions, parry, or pause. Certain characters have special abilities. The game was the first in the series to allow the player to control up to five characters in their party; previous games had limited the party to four.\nPlayer characters and monsters have hit points (HP), with the characters' HP captioned below the main battle screen. Attacks reduce remaining HP until none are left, at which point the character faints or the monster dies. If all characters are defeated, the game must be restored from a saved game file. The player can restore the characters' hit points by having them sleep in an inn or use items in the party's inventory, such as potions, as well as using healing magic spells. Equipment (such as swords and armor) bought in towns or found in dungeons can be used to increase damage inflicted on monsters or minimize damage received. The player can choose whether characters appear on the front line of a battle or in the back. A character's placement impacts damage received and inflicted depending on the type of attack.\n\"Final Fantasy IV\" introduced Square's Active Time Battle (ATB) system, which differed from the turn-based designs of previous RPGs. The ATB system centers on the player inputting orders for the characters in real time during battles. The system was used in many subsequent Square games.\nEach character has certain strengths and weaknesses; for instance, a strong magic user may have low defense, while a physical fighter may have low agility. Like other \"Final Fantasy\" games, characters gain new, more powerful abilities with battle experience. Magic is classified as either \"White\" for healing and support; \"Black\" for offense; or \"Summon\" (or \"call\") for summoning monsters to attack or carry out specialized tasks. A fourth type, \"Ninjutsu\", consists of support and offensive magic and is available to only one character. Magic users, who account for eight of the twelve playable characters, gain magic spells at preprogrammed experience levels or fixed story events. The game includes balanced point gains, items, and rewards to eliminate long sessions of grinding. Due to the Super NES' greater processing power, \"Final Fantasy IV\" contains improved graphics when compared to previous \"Final Fantasy\" titles, all of which were released on the NES. The game employs the Super NES' Mode 7 technology to give enhanced magic spell visuals and to make airship travel more dramatic by scaling and tilting the ground for a bird's eye view.\nPlot.\nSetting.\nMost of \"Final Fantasy IV\" takes place on Earth, also known as the Blue Planet, which consists of a surface world (or Overworld), inhabited by humans, and an underground world (or Underworld), inhabited by the Dwarves. An artificial moon orbits the planet, upon which the Lunarians live. The Lunarians are a race of beings originally from a world which was destroyed, becoming the asteroid belt surrounding the Blue Planet, and are identified by a moon-shape crest on their foreheads. They created the artificial moon, resting until a time when they believe their kind can co-exist with humans. A second, natural moon orbits the Blue Planet as well, although it is never visited in the game.\nCharacters.\n\"Final Fantasy IV\" offers twelve playable characters, each with a unique, unchangeable character class. During the game, the player can have a total of five, or fewer, characters in the party at any given time. The main character, Cecil Harvey, is a dark knight and the captain of the Red Wings, an elite air force unit of the kingdom of Baron. He serves the king alongside his childhood friend Kain Highwind, the commander of the Dragoons. Rosa Farrell is a white mage and archer, as well as Cecil's love interest. The Red Wings' airships were constructed by Cecil's friend, the engineer Cid Pollendina.\nDuring his quest, Cecil is joined by others, including Rydia, a young summoner from the village of Mist; Tellah, a legendary sage; Edward Chris von Muir, the prince of Damcyan who is a bard as well as the husband of Tellah's daughter Anna; Yang Fang Leiden, the head of the monks of Fabul; Palom and Porom, a black mage and a white mage, twin apprentices from the magical village of Mysidia; Edward \"Edge\" Geraldine, the ninja prince of Eblan; and Fusoya, the guardian of the Lunarians during their long sleep.\nZemus is the main antagonist of the game. He is a Lunarian who wishes to destroy the human race so that his people can populate the earth. He uses Golbez to do this by controlling him and Kain with his psychic powers to activate the Giant of Babil, a huge machine created to carry out the genocide and take over the world.\nStory.\nThe Red Wings attack the city of Mysidia to steal their Water Crystal, and return to the Kingdom of Baron. Afterwards, when Cecil, Captain of the Red Wings, questions the king's motives, he is stripped of his rank and sent with Kain, his friend and Captain of the Dragoons, to deliver a ring to the Village of Mist. There, Kain and Cecil watch in horror as monsters burst forth from inside the ring and lay waste to the village. A young girl, Rydia, is the only survivor and summons a monster named Titan in anger. This monster causes an earthquake, separating Cecil and Kain. Cecil awakens afterward and takes the wounded Rydia to a nearby inn. Baron soldiers come for Rydia but Cecil defends her, and she joins him on his journey.\nIt is revealed that Rosa, Cecil's love interest, had followed him and is extremely ill with a fever. Soon after this, Cecil and Rydia meet Tellah, who is going to Damcyan Castle to retrieve his eloping daughter, Anna. However, Anna is killed when the Red Wings bomb the castle. Edward, Anna's lover and the prince of Damcyan, explains that the Red Wings' new commander, Golbez, did this to steal the Fire Crystal for Baron as they had stolen the Water Crystal from Mysidia. Tellah leaves the party to exact revenge on Golbez for Anna's death. After finding a cure for Rosa, the party decides to go to Fabul to protect the Wind Crystal. On the way there they meet Master Yang, a warrior monk serviced to the kingdom and the protection of the crystal. The Red Wings attack Fabul, and Kain reappears as one of Golbez's servants. He attacks and defeats Cecil; when Rosa intervenes, Golbez kidnaps her and Kain takes the crystal. On the way back to Baron, the party is attacked by Leviathan and separated.\nCecil awakes alone near Mysidia. When he enters the town, he finds that its residents deeply resent him for the prior attack on their town. Through the Elder of Mysidia, he learns that to defeat Golbez, he must climb Mt. Ordeals and become a Paladin. Before embarking on his journey, he is joined by the twin mages, Palom and Porom. On the mountain he encounters Tellah, who is searching for the forbidden spell Meteor to defeat Golbez. After defeating the fiend Scarmiglione and casting aside the darkness within himself, Cecil becomes a Paladin, while Tellah learns the secret of Meteor. Upon reaching Baron, the party discovers an amnesiac Yang and return him to his senses. The party then confronts the King, only to discover that he is an imposter and one of Golbez's minions, Cagnazzo. After defeating him, Cid arrives and takes them to one of his airships, the \"Enterprise\". On the way, the party enters a room booby-trapped by Cagnazzo, where Palom and Porom sacrifice themselves to save Cecil, Tellah, Cid, and Yang.\nOn the airship, Kain appears and demands Cecil retrieve the final crystal in exchange for Rosa's life, which the party obtains with assistance from a bedridden Edward. Kain then leads the party to the Tower of Zot, where Rosa is imprisoned. At the tower's summit, Golbez takes the crystal and attempts to flee. Tellah casts Meteor to stop Golbez, sacrificing his own life in the process, but the spell only weakens Golbez, ending his mind control of Kain. Kain helps Cecil rescue Rosa, and defeat Barbariccia another fiend before Rosa teleports the party out of the collapsing tower to Baron.\nIn Baron, Kain reveals that Golbez must also obtain four subterranean \"Dark Crystals\" to achieve his goal of reaching the Moon. The party travels to the underworld and encounter the Dwarves, who are currently fighting the Red Wings. They defeat Golbez thanks to a sudden appearance by Rydia, now a young woman due to her time spent in the Feymarch, the home of the Eidolons. However, the party ultimately fails to prevent Golbez from stealing the Dwarves' crystal. With the help of the Dwarves, they enter the Tower of Babil in order to obtain the crystals Golbez has stored there, only to find that they have been moved to a surface portion of the tower. Yang later sacrifices himself in order to stop the tower's cannons from firing on the Dwarves (though he's later revealed to have survived). After escaping a trap set by Golbez, the party flees the underworld aboard the \"Enterprise\", with Cid sacrificing himself to reseal the passage between the two worlds and to prevent the Red Wings from continuing their pursuit. The party, now joined by Edge, the prince of Eblan, travels back to the Tower of Babil in order to take back the stolen crystals and revenge himself upon Rubicante the last of the fiends. Upon reaching the crystal room, however, the party falls through a trap door to the underworld. Meeting with the Dwarves once again and finding Cid to be alive, the party sets out to retrieve the eighth crystal before Golbez can. When the crystal is obtained, Golbez appears and reveals he still has control over Kain, while taking the crystal for himself. After learning of the \"Lunar Whale\", a ship designed to take travelers to and from the moon, the party return to Mysidia where the town's Elder and mages summon the ship.\nArriving on the Moon, the party meets the sage Fusoya, who explains that Cecil's father was a Lunarian. Fusoya also explains that a Lunarian named Zemus plans to destroy life on the Blue Planet so that the Lunarians can take over, using Golbez to summon the Giant of Babil, a colossal robot. The party returns to Earth and the forces of the two worlds attack the Giant, including Palom and Porom, who have been revived. After the party breaks the robot, Golbez and Kain confront them, only to have Fusoya break Zemus' control over Golbez, in turn releasing Kain. Cecil learns that Golbez is his older brother. Golbez and Fusoya head to the core of the Moon to defeat Zemus, and Cecil's party follows. In the Moon's core, the party witnesses Golbez and Fusoya kill Zemus, but then quickly fall to an evil spirit named Zeromus, the embodiment of all of Zemus' hatred and rage. Back on Earth, the Elder of Mysidia entreats all of Cecil's allies and friends to pray for the party, which gives Cecil and his allies the strength to fight and destroy Zeromus. Following the battle, Fusoya and Golbez opt to leave Earth with the moon. Cecil, at last accepting the truth, acknowledges Golbez as his brother, and bids him farewell.\nDuring the epilogue, most of the cast reunites to celebrate Cecil and Rosa's wedding and their coronation as Baron's new king and queen, while Kain is seen atop Mount Ordeals, having vowed to atone for his misdeeds.\nDevelopment.\nAfter completing \"Final Fantasy III\" in 1990, Square planned to develop two \"Final Fantasy\" games\u2014one for the Famicom and the other for the forthcoming Super Famicom, to be known as \"Final Fantasy IV\" and \"V\" respectively. Due to financial and scheduling constraints, Square dropped plans for the Famicom game and continued development of the Super Famicom version, retitled \"Final Fantasy IV\". A mock-up screenshot of the cancelled title was produced for a Japanese magazine, but little other information exists about it. Series creator and director Hironobu Sakaguchi has stated that the Famicom version was approximately 80% complete and certain ideas were reused for the Super Famicom version.\n\"Final Fantasy IV\" was lead designer Takashi Tokita's first project at Square as a full-time employee. Before this, Tokita wanted a career as a theater actor, but working on the game made him decide to become a \"great creator\" of video games. Initially Hiromichi Tanaka, the main designer of \"Final Fantasy III\", was also involved in the development of the game. However, Tanaka wanted to create a seamless battle system that had no separate battle screen and was not menu-driven, and since \"Final Fantasy IV\" was not going in that direction, he changed development teams to work on the action RPG \"Secret of Mana\" instead. According to Tanaka, he originally wanted the title to have a \"more action-based, dynamic overworld\" but it \"wound up not being\" \"Final Fantasy IV\" anymore, instead becoming a separate project that eventually became \"Seiken Densetsu 2\" (\"Secret of Mana\"), which was codenamed \"Chrono Trigger\" during development. The development team of \"Final Fantasy IV\" contained 14 people in total, and the game was completed in roughly one year.\nInitial ideas were contributed by Sakaguchi, including the entire story and the name of Baron's royal air force, the \"Red Wings\". The Active Time Battle (ATB) system was conceived and designed by Hiroyuki Ito when he was inspired while watching a Formula One race and seeing racers pass each other at different speeds. This gave him the idea of different speed values for the individual characters. The system was developed by Kazuhiko Aoki, Ito and Akihiko Matsui. As the game's lead designer, Tokita wrote the scenario and contributed pixel art. He said that there was a lot of pressure and that the project would not have been completed if he did not work diligently on it. According to Tokita, \"Final Fantasy IV\" was designed with the best parts of the previous three installments in mind: the job system of \"Final Fantasy III\", the focus on story of the second game, and the four elemental bosses acting as \"symbols for the game\" as in the first installment. Other influences include \"Dragon Quest II\". The themes of the game were to go \"from darkness to light\" with Cecil, a focus on family and friendship among the large and diverse cast, and the idea that \"brute strength alone isn't power\". Tokita feels that \"Final Fantasy IV\" is the first game in the series to really pick up on drama, and the first Japanese RPG to feature deep characters and plot.\nThe game's script had to be reduced to one fourth of its original length due to cartridge storage limits, but Tokita made sure only \"unnecessary dialogue\" was cut, rather than actual story elements. As the graphical capacities of the Super Famicom allowed regular series character designer Yoshitaka Amano to make more elaborate character designs than in the previous installments, with the characters' personalities already evident from the images, Tokita felt the reduced script length improved the pacing of the game. Still, he acknowledges that some parts of the story were \"unclear\" or were not \"looked at in depth\" until later ports and remakes. One of the ideas not included, due to time and space constraints, was a dungeon near the end of the game where each character would have to progress on their own\u2014this dungeon would only be included in the Game Boy Advance version of the game, as the Lunar Ruins.\nMusic.\nThe score of \"Final Fantasy IV\" was written by longtime series composer Nobuo Uematsu. Uematsu has noted that the process of composing was excruciating, involving trial and error and requiring the sound staff to spend several nights in sleeping bags at Square's headquarters. His liner notes were humorously signed as being written at 1:30 AM \"in the office, naturally\". The score was well received; reviewers have praised the quality of the composition despite the limited medium. The track \"Theme of Love\" has even been taught to Japanese school children as part of the music curriculum. Uematsu continues to perform certain pieces in his \"Final Fantasy\" concert series.\nThree albums of music from \"Final Fantasy IV\" have been released in Japan. The first album, ', was released on June 14, 1991, and contains 44 tracks from the game. The second album, ', was released on October 24 the same year, and contains a selection of tracks from the game, arranged and performed by Celtic musician M\u00e1ire Breatnach. Lastly, \"Final Fantasy IV Piano Collections\", an arrangement of tracks for solo piano performed by Toshiyuki Mori, was released on April 21, 1992, and began the \"Piano Collections\" trend for each successive \"Final Fantasy\" game. Several tracks have appeared on \"Final Fantasy\" compilation albums produced by Square, including \"The Black Mages\" and \"\". Independent but officially licensed releases of \"Final Fantasy IV\" music have been orchestrated by such groups as Project Majestic Mix, which focuses on arranging video game music. Selections also appear on Japanese remix albums, called d\u014djin music, and on English remixing websites such as OverClocked ReMix.\nNorth American localization.\nBecause the previous two installments of the \"Final Fantasy\" series had not been localized and released in North America at the time, \"Final Fantasy IV\" was distributed as \"Final Fantasy II\" to maintain naming continuity. This remained the norm until the release of \"Final Fantasy VII\" in North America (after the release of \"Final Fantasy VI\" under the title of \"Final Fantasy III\") and subsequent releases of the original \"Final Fantasy II\" and \"III\" on various platforms. The game has since gone under the title \"Final Fantasy IV\" in all subsequent ports (sans the Wii Virtual Console).\nThe English localization of \"Final Fantasy IV\" retains the storyline, graphics, and sound of the original, but the developers significantly reduced the difficulty for beginning gamers. Square was worried that western fans would find it difficult to adjust to the game's complexity due to not having played the previous two entries, so decreased the overall depth considerably. Other changes include the removal of overt Judeo-Christian religious references and certain potentially objectionable graphics. For example, the magic spell \"Holy\" was renamed \"White\", and all references to prayer were eliminated; the Tower of Prayers in Mysidia was renamed the Tower of Wishes. Direct references to death were also omitted, although several characters clearly die during the course of the game. The translation was changed in accordance with Nintendo of America's censorship policies (at a time before the formation of the ESRB and its rating system).\nRe-releases.\nIn addition to its original release, \"Final Fantasy IV\" has been remade into many different versions. The first of these was \"Final Fantasy IV Easy Type\", a modified version of the game which was released for the Super Famicom in Japan. In this version, the attack powers of weapons have been enhanced, while the protective abilities of certain spells and pieces of armor are amplified. The American release is partially based on \"Easy Type\".\nA PlayStation port debuted in Japan on March 21, 1997. Ported by Tose and published by Square, it was designed and directed by Kazuhiko Aoki, supervised by Fumiaki Fukaya, and produced by Akihiro Imai. This version is identical to the original game, although minor tweaks introduced in the \"Easy Type\" are present. The most notable changes in the PlayStation release are the inclusion of a full motion video opening and ending sequence, the ability to move quickly in dungeons and towns by holding the Cancel button, and the option of performing a \"memo\" save anywhere on the world map. This version was released a second time in Japan in March 1999 as part of the \"Final Fantasy Collection\" package, which also included the PlayStation versions of \"Final Fantasy V\" and \"VI\". Fifty-thousand limited edition copies of the collection were also released and included a \"Final Fantasy\"-themed alarm clock.\nThe PlayStation port was later released with \"Chrono Trigger\" in North America as part of \"Final Fantasy Chronicles\" in 2001 and with \"Final Fantasy V\" in Europe and Australia as part of \"Final Fantasy Anthology\" in 2002. The English localizations feature a new translation, although certain translated lines from the previous localization by Kaoru Moriyama, such as \"You spoony bard!\", were kept, as they had become fan favorites. A remake for the WonderSwan Color, with few changes from the PlayStation version, was released in Japan on March 28, 2002. Character sprites and backgrounds were graphically enhanced through heightened details and color shading.\n\"Final Fantasy IV\" was ported again by Tose for the Game Boy Advance and published as . It was released in North America by Nintendo of America on December 12, 2005; in Japan by Square Enix on December 15; in Australia on February 23, 2006; and in Europe on June 2. In Japan, a special version was available which included a limited edition Game Boy Micro with a themed face plate featuring artwork of Cecil and Kain. The enhanced graphics from the WonderSwan Color port were further improved, and minor changes were made to the music. The localization team revised the English translation, improving the flow of the story, and restoring plot details absent from the original. The abilities that were removed from the original North American release were re-added, while spells were renamed to follow the naming conventions of the Japanese version, changing \"Bolt2\" to \"Thundara\" for example. A new cave at Mt. Ordeals was added featuring powerful armor and stronger weapons for five additional characters, as was the Lunar Ruins, a dungeon accessible only at the end of the game.\nThe game was remade with 3D graphics for the Nintendo DS as part of the \"Final Fantasy\" series' 20th anniversary, and was released as \"Final Fantasy IV\" in Japan on December 20, 2007, in North America on July 22, 2008, and in Europe on September 5. The remake adds a number of features not present in the original, such as voice acting, minigames, and some changes to the basic gameplay. The game was developed by Matrix Software, the same team responsible for the \"Final Fantasy III\" DS remake, and was supervised by members of the original development team: Takashi Tokita served as executive producer and director, Tomoya Asano as producer and Hiroyuki Ito as battle designer. Animator Yoshinori Kanada storyboarded the new cutscenes.\nThe original version of the game was released on the Wii Virtual Console in Japan on August 4, 2009, and in PAL regions on June 11, 2010. An enhanced port for i-mode compatible phones was released in Japan on October 5, 2009. It retains features introduced in the WonderSwan Color and Game Boy Advance ports, while incorporating enhanced character graphics on par with those found in \"The After Years\", as well as an exclusive \"extra dungeon\" available after completing the game.\nAlong with ', the game was released for the PlayStation Portable as part of the compilation '. This version used updated 2D graphics, as opposed to the 3D graphics seen in the DS remake. The collection also includes a new episode called \"Final Fantasy IV: Interlude\", which takes place between the original game and \"The After Years\". Masashi Hamauzu arranged the main theme for the game. It was released worldwide in April 2011, with the exception of Japan in March. The PlayStation port was re-released as part of the \"Final Fantasy 25th Anniversary Ultimate Box\" Japanese package in December 2012.\nIn December 2012, the Nintendo DS version of \"Final Fantasy IV\" was released for the iOS and Android (June 2013) mobile platforms, introducing an optional easier difficulty level. \"Final Fantasy IV\" was also released for Windows in September 2014, with no prior advertisement.\nThe PlayStation version was released as a PSOne Classic in Japan on June 27, 2012, compatible with PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita and PlayStation Portable.\nThe Super Famicom version was released on the Wii U Virtual Console in Japan on February 19, 2014, while the Game Boy Advance version was released on April 13, 2016.\nReception.\nThe game received positive reviews upon release. \"Famitsu\"'s panel of four reviewers gave it ratings of 9, 9, 10, and 8, adding up to an overall score of 36 out of 40, one of the highest scores it awarded to any game in 1991, second only to \"\". In its November 1991 issue, \"Nintendo Power\" proclaimed it set a \"new standard of excellence\" for role-playing games. They praised the battles as being \"more interesting than in previous RPGs\" because the player \"must make snap decisions\" and the \"enemies don't wait for you to make up your mind\" and concluded that the \"story, graphics, play and sound will keep fans riveted\". \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\"' panel of four reviewers gave it ratings of 8, 9, 7, and 8, out of 10, adding up to 32 out of 40 overall. In its December 1991 issue, Ed Semrad, who gave it a 9, wrote that \"Square has just redefined what the ultimate RPG should be like\", noting the \"spectacular Mode 7 effects, outstanding graphics and a quest unequalled in a video game\", concluding that it \"makes use of all the Super NES has to offer\" and is \"the best made to date!\" Ken Williams (as Sushi-X), who gave it an 8, said that it is \"a totally awesome RPG\", the \"storyline is actually coherent and the plot moves along with a combination of speaking sequences and battles\". On the other hand, Martin Alessi, who disliked role-playing games, gave it a 7. They gave the game an award for 1991's Best RPG Video Game, stating that the \"Mode 7 is great here and Square does a spectacular job in using it to zoom in and away from the planet\" and that the \"quest is huge and also one of the most difficult ever attempted in a video game\".\n\"GamePro\" rated it a perfect 5.0 out of 5 in all five categories (graphics, sound, control, fun factor, and challenge) in its March 1992 issue. The reviewer Monty Haul stated that it \"truly redefines the standards for fantasy adventure games\", proclaiming that \"one-dimensional characters, needless hack 'em combat, and linear gameplay will be things of the past if other RPGs learn a lesson or two from this cart\", concluding that it \"is one small step for Square Soft, and one giant leap for SNES role-playing games\". In the November 1993 issue of \"Dragon\", Sandy Petersen gave it an \"Excellent\" rating. He criticized the \"stylized\" combat system and the graphics as \"inferior\" to \"Zelda\", but praised how every \"spell has a different on-screen effect\" and the difficulty for being \"just about right\" where bosses \"nearly beat you every time\" unlike other RPGs such as \"Ultima\" where enough \"adventuring\" makes it possible to \"trash\" enemies \"with ease\". He praised the \"great\" music, preferring it over \"Zelda\", stating what it \"lacks in graphics, it more than makes up for in sound\". He praised the story in particular, noting that, in a departure from other RPGs where the party always \"sticks together through thick and thin\", the characters have their own motives for joining and leaving the group, with one that \"even betrays\" them. He said that it is like \"following the storyline of a fantasy novel\", comparing it to \"The Lord of the Rings\" and \"Man in the Iron Mask\", concluding that, because \"the characters often spoke up for themselves\", he \"got much more attached\" to the party \"than in any other computer game\".\nRetrospectively, major reviewers have called \"Final Fantasy IV\" one of the greatest video games of all time, noting that it pioneered many now common console role-playing game features, including the concept of dramatic storytelling in an RPG. In a 1997 retrospective, \"GamePro\" credited it as \"the first game where a turn-based combat system allowed you to change weapons, cast spells, and use items during a battle, and it featured some of the most exciting villains to date\". Reviewers have praised the game for its graphics, gameplay and score, and have noted that \"Final Fantasy IV\" was one of the first role-playing games to feature a complex, involving plot. However, some retrospective reviews have criticized the game's original English-language translation.\nIt has been included in various lists of the best games of all time. \"Nintendo Power\" included it in the \"100 Greatest Nintendo Games\" lists, placing it ninth in 1997's issue 100, and twenty-eighth in 2005's issue 200. IGN included it in its top 100 lists of the greatest games of all time, ranking it #9 in 2003, as the highest-ranking RPG, and at #26 in 2005, as the highest rated \"Final Fantasy\" title on the list. In 2007, it was ranked at #55, behind \"Final Fantasy VI\" and \"Final Fantasy Tactics\". \"Famitsu\" released a reader poll in 2006 ranking it as the sixth best game ever made. It was also listed among the best games of all time by \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" in 2001 and 2006, \"Game Informer\" in 2001 and 2009, GameSpot in 2005, and GameFAQs in 2005, 2009 and 2014.\n\"Weekly Famitsu\" gave \"Final Fantasy Collection\" a score of 54 out of 60 points, scored by a panel of six reviewers. The Game Boy Advance version, \"Final Fantasy IV Advance\", was met with praise from reviewers, although a few noted the game's graphics do not hold up well to current games, especially when compared to \"Final Fantasy VI\". Reviewers noted that some fans may still nitpick certain errors in the new translation. The Nintendo DS version of the game was praised for its visuals, gameplay changes and new cutscenes. It was a nominee for Best RPG on the Nintendo DS in IGN's 2008 video game awards.\nSales.\nUpon release in Japan, \"Final Fantasy IV\" sold about cartridges on its first day, about 4.5 times less than what \"Final Fantasy V\" sold on its first day a year later, no doubt because audiences were hoping for more of the same. The Super Famicom version of \"Final Fantasy IV\" went on to sell 1.44 million copies in Japan.\nThe PlayStation version sold an additional 261,000 copies in Japan in 1997. By March 2003, the game, including the PlayStation and WonderSwan Color remakes, had shipped 2.16 million copies worldwide, with 1.82 million of those copies being shipped in Japan and 340,000 abroad. The Game Boy Advance version of the game sold over 219,000 copies in Japan by the end of 2006. As of 2007, just before the release of the Nintendo DS version, nearly 3 million copies of the game had been sold around the world. By May 2009, the DS version of the game had sold 1.1 million copies worldwide. According to Steam Spy, another 190,000 copies of the PC version were sold by April 2018.\nIn addition, \"Final Fantasy Collection\", which includes \"Final Fantasy IV\", sold over 400,000 copies in 1999. This makes it the 31st best selling release of that year in Japan.\nLegacy.\n\"Final Fantasy IV: The After Years\", the sequel to \"Final Fantasy IV\", is set seventeen years after the events of the original. The first two chapters of the game were released in Japan in February 2008 for NTT DoCoMo FOMA 903i series phones, and for au WIN BREW series phones in spring. The game revolves around Ceodore, the son of Cecil and Rosa, with most of the original cast members returning, some of whom are featured in more prominent roles than before, among other new characters. After the mobile release, \"The After Years\" was released outside Japan, for Wii's WiiWare service. The first two chapters were released in June 2009, in North America and PAL territories, with the additional chapters being released in the following months.\nA two-volume novelization of \"Final Fantasy IV\" was released in Japan on December 25, 2008.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "52755", "revid": "1719098", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52755", "title": "Final Fantasy VI", "text": "1994 video game\n titled Final Fantasy III in its initial North American release, is a 1994 role-playing video game developed and published by Square for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It is the sixth main entry in the \"Final Fantasy\" series, the final to feature 2D sprite based graphics, and the first to be directed by someone other than series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi; the role was instead filled by Yoshinori Kitase and Hiroyuki Ito. Long-time collaborator Yoshitaka Amano returned as character designer and concept artist, while composer Nobuo Uematsu returned to compose the game's score, which has been released on several soundtrack albums.\nSet in a world with technology resembling the Second Industrial Revolution, the game's story follows an expanding cast that includes fourteen permanent playable characters. The game's themes of a rebellion against an immoral military dictatorship, pursuit of a magical arms race, use of chemical weapons in warfare, depictions of violent and apocalyptic confrontations, several personal redemption arcs, teenage pregnancy, and the renewal of hope and life itself all make the storyline darker and more mature than earlier entries in the franchise.\nIt was ported by Tose with minor differences to the PlayStation in 1999, and the Game Boy Advance in 2006. The Super NES version was rereleased for the Wii's Virtual Console in 2011, and by Nintendo as part of the company's Super NES Classic Edition in 2017. The game was known as \"Final Fantasy III\" when it was first released in North America, as the actual \"Final Fantasy II\", \"III\", and \"V\" had not been released outside Japan at the time (leaving \"IV\" as the second title released outside Japan and \"VI\" as the third). However, all later versions of the game\u2014other than re-releases of the original version\u2014use the original title.\n\"Final Fantasy VI\" received widespread critical acclaim and was praised for its graphics, soundtrack, story, characters, and setting. Many critics have ranked it as the best entry in the series, as well as one of the best video games of all time. Due to its impact, \"Final Fantasy VI\" is also often deemed a watershed title for the role-playing genre. The game was a commercial success, with the Super NES and PlayStation versions selling over 3.48 million copies worldwide by 2003, as well as over 750,000 copies as part of the Japanese \"Final Fantasy Collection\" and the North American \"Final Fantasy Anthology\".\nGameplay.\nLike previous installments, \"Final Fantasy VI\" consists of four basic modes of gameplay: an overworld map, town and dungeon field maps, a battle screen, and a menu screen. The overworld map is a scaled-down version of the game's world, which the player uses to direct characters to various locations. As with most games in the series, the three primary means of travel across the overworld are by foot, chocobo, and airship. With a few plot-driven exceptions, enemies are randomly encountered on field maps and on the overworld when traveling by foot. The menu screen is where the player makes such decisions as which characters will be in the traveling party, which equipment they wield, the magic they learn, and the configuration of the gameplay. It is also used to track experience points and levels.\nThe game's plot develops as the player progresses through towns and dungeons. Town citizens will offer helpful information, and some residents own item or equipment shops. Later in the game, visiting certain towns will activate side-quests. Dungeons appear as a variety of areas, including caves, forests, and buildings. These dungeons often have treasure chests containing rare items that are not available in most stores. Dungeons may feature puzzles and mazes, with some dungeons requiring the player to divide the characters into multiple parties which must work together to advance through the dungeon.\nCombat.\nCombat in \"Final Fantasy VI\" is menu-based, in which the player selects an action from a list of such options as Fight, Magic, and Item. A maximum of four characters may be used in battles, which are based on the series' traditional Active Time Battle (ATB) system, first featured in \"Final Fantasy IV\". Under this system, each character has an action bar that replenishes itself at a rate dependent on their speed statistic. When a character's action bar is filled, the player may assign an action. In addition to standard battle techniques, each character possesses a unique special ability. For example, Locke possesses the ability to steal items from enemies, while Celes' \"Runic\" ability allows her to absorb most magical attacks cast until her next turn.\nAnother element is the Desperation Attack, a powerful attack substitution that occasionally appears when a character's health is low. Similar features appear in later \"Final Fantasy\" titles under a variety of different names, including Limit Breaks, Trances, and Overdrives. Characters are rewarded for victorious battles with experience points and money, called gil (Gold Piece (GP) in the original North American localization). When characters attain a certain number of experience points, they gain a level, which increases their statistics. An additional player may play during battle scenarios, with control of individual characters assigned from the configuration menu.\nCustomization.\nCharacters in \"Final Fantasy VI\" can be equipped with a variety of weapons, armor and, particular to this entry, powerful accessories known as \"Relics\". Weapons and armor increase combat capability, mostly by increasing statistics and adding beneficial effects to attacks. By comparison, Relics have a variety of uses and effects, are almost entirely interchangeable among party members, and are extended in sophistication to alter basic battle commands and exceed normal limitations of the game's systems.\nAlthough in \"VI\" only two playable characters start the game with the ability to use magic, magic may later be taught to almost all other playable characters through the game's introduction of magicite and the Espers that magicite shards contain. \"Espers\" are the game's incarnation of the series' trope of \"summons\", powerful monstrous beings, many of which are recurring throughout the series, such as Ifrit, Shiva, Bahamut and Odin. Besides those returning from previous entries, \"VI\" features approximately two dozen of them in total, with more added to later versions of the game.\nThe setting and plot of the game revolve heavily around Espers and their remains when deceased, which are referred to as \"magicite\". Each piece of magicite has a specific set of magic spells that a character can learn when they are equipped with it in the menu. If used often enough, these abilities become permanently accessible, even if the magicite is removed. Additionally, some pieces of magicite grant a statistical bonus to a character when they gain a level. Finally, when a character equips a piece of magicite, they may summon the corresponding Esper during battle.\nPlot.\nSetting.\nInstead of the strictly medieval fantasy settings featured in previous \"Final Fantasy\" titles, \"Final Fantasy VI\" is set in a world with deliberately more industrial and mechanical design elements; developers described a setting where machinery and magic coexist. Opera and the fine arts serve as recurring motifs\u2014most notably the opera sequence\u2014documented in developer interviews and later remaster materials. During the first half of the game, the planet is referred to as the World of Balance, and is divided into three lush continents. The northern continent is punctuated by a series of mountain ranges, the southern continent has been mostly subjugated by the cruel Gestahl Empire, and the eastern continent is home to the Veldt, a massive wilderness inhabited by monsters from all over the world. An apocalyptic event mid-game transforms the planet into the World of Ruin; its withering landmasses are fractured into numerous islands surrounding a larger continent.\nThe game alludes to a conflict known as the \"War of the Magi\", which occurred one thousand years prior to the beginning of the game. In this conflict, three quarreling entities known as the \"Warring Triad\" used innocent humans as soldiers by transforming them into enslaved magical beings called Espers. The Triad realized their wrongdoings; they freed the espers and sealed their own powers inside three stone statues. As a precaution, the espers sealed off both the statues and themselves from the realm of humans. The concept of magic gradually faded to myth as mankind built a society extolling science and technology. At the game's opening, the Empire has taken advantage of the weakening barrier between the human and esper domains, capturing several espers in the process. Using these espers as a power source, the Empire has created \"Magitek\", a craft that combines magic with machinery (including mechanical infantry) and infuses humans with magical powers. The Empire is opposed by the Returners, a rebel organization seeking to free the subjugated lands.\nCharacters.\n\"Final Fantasy VI\" features fourteen permanent playable characters, the most of any game in the main series, as well as several secondary characters who are only briefly controlled by the player. The starting character, Terra Branford, is a reserved half-human, half-esper girl who spent most of her life as a slave to the Empire, thanks to a mind-controlling device, and is unfamiliar with love. Other primary characters include Locke Cole, a treasure hunter and rebel sympathizer with a powerful impulse to protect women; Celes Chere, a former general of the Empire, who joined the Returners after being jailed for questioning imperial practices; Edgar Roni Figaro, a consummate womanizer and the king of Figaro, who claims allegiance to the Empire while secretly supplying aid to the Returners; Sabin Rene Figaro, Edgar's independent brother, who fled the royal court to hone his martial arts skills; Cyan Garamonde, a loyal knight to the kingdom of Doma who lost his family and friends when Kefka poisoned the kingdom's water supply; Setzer Gabbiani, a habitual gambler, thrill seeker, and owner of the world's only known airship; Shadow, a ninja mercenary who offers his services to both the Empire and the Returners; Relm Arrowny, a young but tough artistic girl with magical powers; Strago Magus, Relm's elderly grandfather and a Blue Mage; Gau, a feral child surviving since infancy on the Veldt; Mog, a pike-toting Moogle from the mines of Narshe; Umaro, a savage but loyal yeti also from Narshe, talked into joining the Returners through Mog's persuasion; and Gogo, a mysterious, fully shrouded master of the art of mimicry.\nMost of the main characters in the game hold a significant grudge against the Empire and, in particular, Kefka Palazzo, who is one of the game's main antagonists along with Emperor Gestahl. The clownish Kefka became the first experimental prototype of a line of magically empowered soldiers called Magitek Knights, rendering him insane; his actions throughout the game reflect his demented nature. The supporting character Ultros is a recurring villain and comic relief. A handful of characters have reappeared in later games. \"Final Fantasy SGI\", a short tech demo produced for the Silicon Graphics Onyx workstation, featured polygon-based 3D renderings of Locke, Terra, and Shadow.\nStory.\nIn the town of Narshe, Terra participates in an Imperial mission to seize a powerful Esper encased in ice. Upon locating it, a magical reaction occurs between Terra and the Esper; as a result, the soldiers accompanying Terra are killed and Terra is knocked unconscious. Upon awakening, Terra is informed that the Empire had been using a device called a \"slave crown\" to control her actions. With the crown now removed, Terra cannot remember anything more than her name and her rare ability to use magic unaided. Terra is then introduced to an organization known as the \"Returners\", who she agrees to help in their revolution against the Empire. The Returners learn that Imperial soldiers, led by Kefka, are planning another attempt to seize the frozen Esper. After repelling Kefka's attack, Terra experiences another magical reaction with the frozen Esper; she transforms into a creature resembling an Esper and flies to another continent. Upon locating Terra, the party is confronted by an Esper named Ramuh, who informs the group that Terra may require the assistance of another Esper imprisoned in the Imperial capital city of Vector.\nAt Vector, the party attempts to rescue several Espers; however, the Espers are already dying from Magitek experiments and choose instead to offer their lives to the party by transforming into magicite. The group returns to Terra and observes a reaction between her and the magicite \"Maduin\". The reaction calms Terra and restores her memory; she reveals that she is the half-human, half-Esper child of Maduin and a human woman. With this revelation, the Returners ask Terra to convince the Espers to join their cause. To do this, she travels to the sealed gate between the human and Esper worlds. However, unbeknownst to the party, the Empire also uses Terra to gain access to the Esper world. There, Emperor Gestahl and Kefka retrieve the statues of the Warring Triad, raising a landmass called the Floating Continent. The group confronts Emperor Gestahl and Kefka at the Floating Continent, whereupon Kefka, whose mental state has progressively deteriorated over the course of the story, usurps and murders Gestahl. Kefka then tampers with the alignment of the statues, which upsets the balance of magic and destroys most of the surface of the world.\nOne year later, Celes awakens on a deserted island. She learns that Kefka is using the Warring Triad to rule the world in a tyrannical god-like manner, destroying whole villages who oppose him and causing all life to slowly wither away. After Celes escapes the island, she searches for her lost comrades, who are found scattered throughout the ruined world. They come to terms with their situation and resolve to confront Kefka and end his reign, with Terra additionally accepting her half-Esper heritage and finding a new purpose in life in fighting for a better future. The group infiltrates Kefka's tower and destroys the Warring Triad before confronting Kefka himself, who has descended into nihilism as a result of his madness and plans to destroy all of existence as a means of self-validation. However, the group successfully destroys Kefka in battle, at which point magic and Espers disappear from the world; despite this, Terra is able to survive by hanging onto the human half of her existence. The group escapes from Kefka's tower as it collapses and flies away while watching as the world rejuvenates itself.\nDevelopment.\nCreation.\n\"Final Fantasy VI\" entered development after the release of its predecessor \"V\" in December 1992. The development of the game took just one year to complete. Series creator and director Hironobu Sakaguchi could not be as intimately involved as in previous installments due to his other projects and his promotion to Executive Vice President of the company in 1991. For that reason, he became the producer and split director responsibilities for \"VI\" up between Yoshinori Kitase and Hiroyuki Ito: Kitase was in charge of event production and the scenario, while Ito handled all battle aspects. Sakaguchi supervised Kitase's cutscene direction and ensured that the project would coalesce as a whole. The idea behind the story of \"VI\" was that every character is the protagonist. All members of the development team contributed ideas for characters and their \"episodes\" for the overall plot in what Kitase described as a \"hybrid process\". Consequently, Terra and Locke were conceived by Sakaguchi; Celes and Gau by Kitase; Shadow and Setzer by graphic director Tetsuya Nomura; and Edgar and Sabin by field graphic designer Kaori Tanaka.\nIt was Kitase's task to unite the story premise provided by Sakaguchi with all the individual ideas for character episodes to create a cohesive narrative. The scenario of \"Final Fantasy VI\" was written by a group of four or five people, among them Kitase who provided key elements of the story, such as the opera scene and Celes' suicide attempt, as well as all of Kefka's appearances. The team decided to split the game into two halves, commonly termed the World of Balance and World of Ruin, because they were tired of the common game scenario of the hero narrowly saving the world. When writing the post-apocalypse second half of the story, the developers decided to let the player choose their favorite characters to emphasize that every character is the protagonist.\nRegular series character designer Yoshitaka Amano's concept art became the basis for the models in the full motion videos produced for the game's PlayStation re-release. Tetsuya Takahashi, one of the graphic directors, drew the imperial Magitek Armors seen in the opening scene. By doing so, he disregarded Sakaguchi's intention to reuse the regular designs from elsewhere in the game. The sprite art for the characters' in-game appearance was drawn by Kazuko Shibuya. While in the earlier installments, the sprites were less detailed on the map than in battle, \"Final Fantasy VI\"'s had an equally high resolution regardless of the screen. This enabled the use of animations depicting a variety of movements and facial expressions. Though it was not the first game to utilize the Super NES' Mode 7 graphics, \"Final Fantasy VI\" made more extensive use of them than its predecessors. For instance, unlike both \"IV\" and \"V\", the world map is rendered in Mode 7, which lends a somewhat three-dimensional perspective to an otherwise two-dimensional game.\nLocalization.\nThe original North American localization and release of \"Final Fantasy VI\" by Square for the Super NES featured several changes from the original Japanese version. The most obvious of these is the change of the game's title from \"Final Fantasy VI\" to \"Final Fantasy III\"; because only two games of the series had been localized in North America at the time, \"VI\" was distributed as \"Final Fantasy III\" to maintain naming continuity. Unlike \"Final Fantasy IV\" (which was first released in North America as \"Final Fantasy II\"), there are no major changes to gameplay, though several changes of contents and editorial adjustments exist in the English script. In a January 1995 interview with \"Super Play\" magazine, translator Ted Woolsey explained that \"there's a certain level of playfulness and ... sexuality in Japanese games that just doesn't exist here [in the USA], basically because of Nintendo of America's rules and guidelines\". Consequently, objectionable graphics (e.g. nudity) were censored and building signs in towns were changed (such as Bar being changed to Caf\u00e9), as well as religious allusions (e.g. the spell \"Holy\" was renamed \"Pearl\").\nAlso, some direct allusions to death, killing actions, and violent expressions, as well as offensive words have been replaced by softer expressions. For example, after Edgar, Locke and Terra flee on chocobos from Figaro Castle, Kefka orders two Magitek Armored soldiers to chase them by shouting \"Go! KILL THEM!\", in the Japanese version. It was translated as \"Go! Get them!\" Also, when Imperial Troopers burn Figaro Castle, and Edgar claims Terra is not hidden inside the castle, Kefka replies \"then you can burn to death\" in the Japanese version, which was replaced in the English version by \"Then welcome to my barbecue!\". Similarly, as Magitek soldiers watch Edgar and his guests escape on Chocobos, Kefka swears in Japanese, which was translated by Ted Woolsey as \"Son of a submariner!\". The localization also featured changes to several names, such as \"Tina\" being changed to \"Terra\". Finally, dialogue text files had to be shortened due to the limited data storage space available on the game cartridge's read-only memory. As a result, additional changes were rendered to dialogue in order to compress it into the available space.\nThe PlayStation re-release featured only minor changes to the English localization. The title of the game was reverted to \"Final Fantasy VI\" from \"Final Fantasy III\", to unify the numbering scheme of the series in North America and Japan with the earlier release of \"VII\". A few item and character names were adjusted, as in the expansion of \"Fenix Down\" to \"Phoenix Down\". Unlike the PlayStation re-release of \"Final Fantasy IV\" included in the later \"Final Fantasy Chronicles\" compilation, the script was left essentially unchanged. The Game Boy Advance re-release featured a new translation by a different translator, Tom Slattery. This translation preserved most of the character names, location names, and terminology from the Woolsey translation, but changed item and spell names to match the conventions used in more recent titles in the series. The revised script preserved certain quirky lines from the original while changing or editing others, and it cleared up certain points of confusion in the original translation. The Wii Virtual Console release used the \"Final Fantasy III\" name of the Super NES game.\nMusic.\nThe soundtrack for \"Final Fantasy VI\" was composed by long-time series contributor Nobuo Uematsu. The score consists of themes for each major character and location, as well as music for standard battles, fights with boss enemies and for special cutscenes. The extensive use of leitmotif is one of the defining points of the audio tracks. The \"Aria di Mezzo Carattere\" is one of the latter tracks, played during a cutscene involving an opera performance. This track features an unintelligible synthesized \"voice\" that harmonizes with the melody, as technical limitations for the SPC700 sound format chip prevented the use of an actual vocal track (although some developers eventually figured out how to overcome the limitation a few years later, and in the \"Pixel Remaster\", it is voiced by opera singers). The orchestral album \"Final Fantasy VI Grand Finale\" features an arranged version of the aria, using Italian lyrics performed by Svetla Krasteva with an orchestral accompaniment. This version is also found in the ending full motion video of the game's Sony PlayStation re-release, with the same lyrics but a different musical arrangement. In addition, the album \"Orchestral Game Concert 4\" includes an extended version of the opera arranged and conducted by K\u014dsuke Onozaki and performed by the Tokyo Symphony Orchestra, featuring Wakako Aokimi, Tetsuya \u014cno, and Hiroshi Kuroda on vocals. It was also performed at the \"More Friends\" concert at the Gibson Amphitheatre in 2005 using a new English translation of the lyrics, an album of which is now available. \"Dancing Mad\", accompanying the game's final battle with Kefka, is 17 minutes long and contains an organ cadenza, with variations on Kefka's theme. The \"Ending Theme\" combines every playable character theme into one composition lasting over 21 minutes.\nThe original score was released on three compact discs in Japan as \"Final Fantasy VI: Original Sound Version\". A version of this album was later released in North America as \"Final Fantasy III: Kefka's Domain\". This version of the album is the same as its Japanese counterpart, except for different packaging and small differences in the translation of some track names between the album and newer releases. Additionally, \"Final Fantasy VI: Grand Finale\" features eleven tracks from the game, arranged by Shir\u014d Sagisu and Tsuneyoshi Saito and performed by the Ensemble Archi Della Scala and Orchestra Sinfonica di Milano (Milan Symphony Orchestra). \"\", a second arranged album, features thirteen tracks from the game, performed for piano by Reiko Nomura. More recently, \"Dancing Mad\", the final boss theme from \"Final Fantasy VI\", has been performed at Play! A Video Game Symphony in Stockholm, Sweden on June 2, 2007, by the group Machinae Supremacy.\nNobuo Uematsu's former rock band, The Black Mages, released a progressive metal version of Dancing Mad on their eponymous first album in 2003. Their third album, subtitled \"\", is so named after its premiere track: a rock opera version of the entire opera from \"FFVI\", including the Aria di Mezzo Carattere performed by Etsuyo Ota.\nIn 2012, a Kickstarter campaign for OverClocked ReMix was funded at $153,633 for the creation of a multiple CD album of remixes of the music from \"VI\". Andrew Aversa directed the creation of the album, \"Balance and Ruin\", which contains 74 tracks from 74 artists, each with its own unique style. The album is free and available at the OverClocked ReMix website. Video Games Live composer Jillian Aversa, Andrew Aversa's wife, created a music video tribute to Aria di Mezzo Carattere, together with cellist Tina Guo, expanding on the arrangement from \"Balance and Ruin\".\nRe-releases.\nPlayStation.\n\"Final Fantasy VI\" was ported to the PlayStation by Tose and re-released in Japan and North America in 1999. In Japan, it was available in both a standalone release and as part of \"Final Fantasy Collection\", while in North America it was available only as part of \"Final Fantasy Anthology\". In Europe it was sold only as a standalone release. Fifty thousand limited-edition copies were also released in Japan and included a \"Final Fantasy\"-themed alarm clock.\n\"Final Fantasy VI\"'s PlayStation port is very similar to the original Japanese Super Famicom release. With the exception of the addition of two full motion video opening and ending sequences and new screen-transition effects used for the start and end of battles, the graphics, music and sound are left unchanged from the original version. The only notable changes to gameplay (in addition to loading times not present in the cartridge versions) involve the correction of a few software bugs from the original and the addition of a new \"memo save\" feature, allowing players to quickly save their progress to the PlayStation's RAM. The re-release included other special features, such as a bestiary and an artwork gallery. The port was re-released in December 2012 as part of the \"Final Fantasy 25th Anniversary Ultimate Box\" package in Japan.\n\"Final Fantasy VI\" was re-released as a PSone Classic in 2011: in Japan on April 20, in PAL territories on June 2 and in North America on December 6.\nThe \"Pixel Remaster\" series version of \"Final Fantasy VI\" was released for PlayStation 4 in April 2023.\nNintendo consoles.\nAfter the PlayStation, Tose then ported the game to the Game Boy Advance, on which it was released as \"Final Fantasy VI Advance\". It was released in Japan by Square Enix on November 30, 2006, with Nintendo handling publishing in North America on February 5, 2007, and in Europe on July 6. It was the last game to be released on the Game Boy Advance in Asia, as well as the last one to be published by Nintendo on the system. It includes additional gameplay features, slightly improved visuals, and a new translation that follows Japanese naming conventions for the spells and monsters. It does not, however, have the full-motion videos from the PlayStation version of the game. Four new espers appear in \"Advance\": Leviathan, Gilgamesh, Cactuar, and Diabolos. Two new areas include the Dragons' Den dungeon, which includes the Kaiser Dragon, a monster coded, but not included, in the original, and a \"Soul Shrine\", a place where the player can fight monsters continuously. Three new spells also appear, and several bugs from the original are fixed. In addition, similarly to the other handheld \"Final Fantasy\" re-releases, a bestiary and a music player are included. Even in the Japanese version, the music player is in English and uses the American names, e.g. \"Strago\" over \"Stragus\". The package features new artwork by series veteran and original character and image designer Yoshitaka Amano.\nThe original Super Famicom version was released for the Wii Virtual Console in Japan on March 15, 2011, in PAL territories (Europe and Australia) on March 18, and in North America on June 30. The game was released in the West with its original North American title of \"Final Fantasy III\". The Super Famicom version was later released on the Wii U Virtual Console in Japan. Square Enix released the Game Boy Advance version on the Wii U Virtual Console in Japan in December 2015.\nNintendo re-released \"Final Fantasy VI\" worldwide in September 2017 as part of the company's Super NES/Super Famicom Classic Edition.\nThe \"Pixel Remaster\" series version of \"Final Fantasy VI\" was released worldwide for Nintendo Switch in April 2023.\nMobile platforms and PC.\nPorts of \"Final Fantasy VI\" for Android and iOS mobile operating systems were also published in 2014, for Android on January 15, and for iOS on February 6, with features such as new high-resolution graphics with sprites designed by Kazuko Shibuya, who did the original game's artwork, movement in eight directions, and auto-battle.\nA Windows PC port, itself a port of the Android version, was released for Windows PC via Steam on December 16, 2015. Another port from the \"Pixel Remaster\" line was released on Steam on February 23, 2022. The \"Pixel Remaster\" series features new 16-bit sprites, new soundtracks, and a return to the game's originally released content. No added content from any of the ported versions appears in any of the \"Pixel Remasters\".\nXbox Series X &amp; S.\nThe \"Pixel Remaster series\" version of \"Final Fantasy VI\" was announced and launched for Xbox Series X/S in September 2024, marking the first release of the game alongside the other NES/SNES entries of the series on any Xbox consoles.\nReception.\nInitial.\n\"Final Fantasy VI\" received critical acclaim and was commercially successful in Japan upon release. In mid-1994, Square's publicity department reported that the game had sold 2.55 million copies in Japan, where it became the best-selling video game of 1994. In the United States, where it went on sale in the last quarter of 1994, it was the top-selling Super NES game in October and became the year's eighth best-selling Super NES cartridge. Despite this, it was not a commercial success in that region, according to Sakaguchi. As of March 2003, the game had shipped 3.48 million copies worldwide, with 2.62 million of those copies being shipped in Japan and 860,000 abroad. \"Final Fantasy Collection\" sold over 400,000 copies in 1999, making it the 31st-best-selling release of that year in Japan. \"Final Fantasy Anthology\" has sold approximately 364,000 copies in North America. \"Final Fantasy VI Advance\" sold over 223,000 copies in Japan by the end of 2006, one month after release.\n\"GamePro\" rated it 4.5 out of 5 in graphics and a perfect 5.0 in sound, control, and fun factor, stating that \"characters, plotlines, and multiple-choice scenarios all combine to form one fantastic game!\" The four reviewers of \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" found that it had set the new standard for excellence in RPGs. They particularly praised the graphics, music, and the strong emotional involvement of the story. It won several awards from \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" in their 1994 video game awards, including Best Role-Playing Game, Best Japanese Role-Playing Game, and Best Music for a Cartridge-Based Game. Additionally, they ranked the game ninth in their 1997 list of the 100 greatest console games of all time. \"\"Famitsu\" gave \"Final Fantasy VI\" some of their highest scores of 1994. \"Nintendo Power\" said it had improved sound and graphics over its predecessors, and the game's broadened thematic scope. Moreover, they suggested that \"with so much story and variation of play ... fans may become lost in the world for months at a time\". \"Nintendo Power\" also opined that the game plot was \"not particularly inventive\" and the \"story is often sappy\u2013not written for an American audience\".\nIn 1997, \"Nintendo Power\" ranked it as the eighth greatest Nintendo game, saying it \"had everything you could want\u2014heroes, world-shattering events, magic, mindless evil\u2014plus Interceptor the wonder dog!\" The same year, \"GamePro\" said it \"still remains one of the most fun, innovative, and challenging RPGs to date\". In 1996, \"Next Generation\" said the scene in which Terra cares for a village of orphaned children \"can perhaps be safely named as the series' finest hour... no other game series has tackled such big issues, or reached such a level of emotional depth and complexity\".\nRetrospective.\n\"Final Fantasy Collection\" received 54 out of 60 points from \"Weekly Famitsu\", scored by a panel of six reviewers. \"IGN\" described the graphics of the PlayStation re-release as \"beautiful and stunning\", reflecting that, at the time of its release, \"\"Final Fantasy III\"... represented everything an RPG should be\", inspiring statistic growth systems that would later influence titles like \"Wild Arms\" and \"Suikoden\". Moreover, they praised its gameplay and storyline, claiming that these aspects took \"all... preceding RPG concepts and either came up with something completely new or refined them enough to make them its own\", creating an atmosphere in which \"[players] won't find it difficult to get past the simplistic graphics or seemingly out-dated gameplay conventions and become involved\". \"RPGamer\" gave a perfect rating to both the original game and its PlayStation re-release, citing its gameplay as \"self-explanatory enough that most any player could pick up the game and customize their characters' equipment\", while praising its music as \"a 16-bit masterpiece\". Joe Juba of \"Game Informer\" called the split between the World of Balance and World of Ruin one of the game's distinguishing features, citing its non-linear, freeform nature, a contrast to the standard linear gameplay of the first half. Calling it a \"pioneering approach\" to wander the land reassembling your former team, he noted that it made the narrative \"largely player-driven\", calling it part of the basic structure that would later be used by open world games.\nThe game's release for the Game Boy Advance also garnered praise. the Game Boy Advance re-release was named eighth best Game Boy Advance game of all time in \"IGN\"'s feature reflecting on the Game Boy Advance's long lifespan. \"Official Nintendo Magazine\" ranked the GBA version of the game 32nd on a list of greatest Nintendo games in 2009. \"Final Fantasy VI\" is often regarded as one of the best titles in the series, and one of the best role-playing video games ever created according to multiple websites. Readers of the Japanese magazine \"Famitsu\" voted it as the 25th best game of all time. In an updated version of the \"Top 100\" list in 2007, \"IGN\" ranked \"Final Fantasy VI\" as the ninth top game of all time, above all other \"Final Fantasy\" games in the series. They continued to cite the game's character development, and especially noted Kefka as one of the most memorable villains in RPG history. \"Nintendo Power\" listed the ending to \"Final Fantasy VI\" as one of the best finales, citing the narrative and cast variety. Time Extension included the game on their \"Best JRPGs of All Time\" list.\nLegacy.\nFollowing \"Final Fantasy VI\", Square began testing for its next entry \"Final Fantasy VII\" on the Nintendo 64, but technical issues, escalating cartridge costs and the higher storage capacity of CD technology persuaded Square to move \"VII\" and all their subsequent titles onto the PlayStation. During early testing on 3D development software, the team rendered a battle involving \"Final Fantasy VI\" characters Terra, Locke and Shadow. The decision to move to PlayStation soured the relations between Square and Nintendo. Due to this, \"Final Fantasy VI\" was the last series title to release on a Nintendo platform until \"Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles\" came out on the Nintendo GameCube in 2003. It was also the last new mainline \"Final Fantasy\" game to come to a Nintendo platform until 2018 when the abridged ' was released on Nintendo Switch, followed by the subsequent rereleases of \"Final Fantasy VII\", \"VIII\", \"IX\", \"X\", \"X-2\" and ' the following year. \"Final Fantasy VI\" was included in the Super NES Classic Edition under its original titling as \"Final Fantasy III\" for the North American and European release in September 2017.\nIn 2010, Square Enix producer Shinji Hashimoto said that the development of a remake of \"Final Fantasy VI\" for the Nintendo DS was \"undecided\" due to \"technical issues\". Later, however, Square discussed remaking \"VI\" as well as \"V\" for the Nintendo 3DS. Tetsuya Nomura, then directing \"Final Fantasy VII Remake\", expressed interest in remaking \"V\" and \"VI\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The seventh main installment in the \"Final Fantasy\" series, it was released in Japan by Square and internationally by Sony Computer Entertainment, becoming the first game in the main series to have a PAL release. The game's story follows Cloud Strife, a mercenary who joins an eco-terrorist organization to stop a world-controlling megacorporation from using the planet's life essence as an energy source. Ensuing events send Cloud and his allies in pursuit of Sephiroth, a superhuman who seeks to wound the planet and harness its healing power in order to be reborn as a god. Throughout their journey, Cloud bonds with his party members, including Aerith Gainsborough, who holds the secret to saving their world.\nDevelopment began in 1994, originally for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. After delays and technical difficulties from experimenting with several platforms, most notably the Nintendo 64, Square moved production to the PlayStation, largely due to the advantages of the CD-ROM format. Veteran \"Final Fantasy\" staff returned, including series creator and producer Hironobu Sakaguchi, director Yoshinori Kitase, and composer Nobuo Uematsu. The title was the first in the series to use full motion video and 3D computer graphics, featuring 3D character models superimposed over 2D pre-rendered backgrounds. Although the gameplay remained mostly unchanged from previous entries, \"Final Fantasy VII\" introduced more widespread science fiction elements and a more realistic presentation. The combined development and marketing budget amounted to approximately US$80 million.\n\"Final Fantasy VII\" received widespread critical acclaim upon release and was a commercial success. Critics praised its graphics, gameplay, music, and story, although some criticism was directed towards the original English localization. It remains widely regarded as a landmark title and one of the greatest and most influential video games of all time. The title won numerous Game of the Year awards and is credited for boosting the sales of the PlayStation and popularizing Japanese role-playing games worldwide. Its success has led to enhanced ports on various platforms, a multimedia subseries called the \"Compilation of Final Fantasy VII\", and a high definition remake trilogy currently comprising \"Final Fantasy VII Remake\" (2020) and \"Final Fantasy VII Rebirth\" (2024).\nGameplay.\nThe gameplay of \"Final Fantasy VII\" is similar to earlier \"Final Fantasy\" titles and Japanese role-playing games. The game features three modes of play: the world map, the field, and the battle screen. At its grandest scale, players explore the world of \"Final Fantasy VII\" on a 3D world map. The world map contains representations of areas for the player to enter, including towns, environments, and ruins. Natural barriers\u2014such as mountains, deserts, and bodies of water\u2014block access by foot to some areas; as the story progresses, the player receives vehicles that help traverse these obstacles, thus opening more of the game world for exploration. Chocobos can be found in certain spots on the map and, if caught, can be ridden to areas inaccessible on foot or by vehicle. In field mode, the player navigates fully scaled versions of the areas represented on the world map. \"VII\" marks the first time in the series that the mode is represented in a three-dimensional space. In this mode, the player can explore the environment, talk with characters, advance the story, and initiate event games. Event games are short minigames that use special control functions and are often tied to the story. While in field mode, the player can also make use of shops and inns. Shops allow the player to buy and sell items that can aid Cloud and his party, such as weapons, armor, and accessories. Inns restore the hit points and mana points of characters who rest at them and cure abnormalities contracted during battles.\nAt random intervals on the world map and in field mode, and at specific moments in the story, the game will enter the battle screen, which places the player characters on one side and the enemies on the other. It employs an Active Time Battle (ATB) system, in which the characters exchange moves until one side is defeated. The damage or healing dealt by either side is quantified on screen. Characters have several statistics that determine their effectiveness in battle; for example, hit points determine how much damage they can take, and magic determines how much damage they can inflict with spells. Each character on the screen has a time gauge; when a character's gauge is full, the player can input a command for them to perform. The commands change as the game progresses, and are dependent on the characters in the player's party and on the abilities, spells, etc., the player has added to their equipment. Commands include attacking with a weapon, casting magic, using items, summoning monsters, and other actions that either damage the enemy or aid the player characters. \"Final Fantasy VII\" also features powerful, character-specific commands called Limit Breaks, which can be used only after a special gauge is charged by taking enemy attacks. After being attacked, characters can be afflicted by one or more abnormal \"statuses\", such as poison or paralysis. These statuses and their adverse effects can be removed by special items or abilities or by resting at an inn. Once all enemies are defeated, the battle ends, and the player is rewarded with money, items, and experience points. If the player is defeated, it is game over and the game must be loaded from the last save point.\nWhen not in battle, the player can use the menu screen, where they can review each character's status and statistics, use items and abilities, change equipment, save the game when on the world map or at a save point, and manage orbs called Materia. Materia are the main method of customizing characters in \"Final Fantasy VII\", and can be added to equipment to provide characters with new magic spells, monsters to summon, commands, statistical upgrades, and other benefits. Materia level up through their own experience point system and can be combined to create different effects.\nSynopsis.\nSetting and characters.\n\"Final Fantasy VII\" takes place on a world referred to in-game as the \"Planet\" and retroactively named \"Gaia\". The planet's lifeforce, called the Lifestream, is a flow of spiritual energy that gives life to everything on the Planet; its processed form is known as \"Mako\". On a societal and technological level, the game has been defined as an industrial or post-industrial science fiction setting. During \"Final Fantasy VII\", the Shinra Electric Power Company, a world-dominating megacorporation headquartered in the city of Midgar, is draining the Planet's Lifestream for energy, weakening the Planet and threatening its existence and all life. Significant factions within the game include AVALANCHE, an eco-terrorist group seeking Shinra's downfall so the Planet can recover; the Turks, a covert branch of Shinra's security forces; SOLDIER, an elite Shinra fighting force created by enhancing humans with Mako; and the Cetra, a near-extinct human tribe which maintains a strong connection to the Planet and the Lifestream.\nThe main protagonist is Cloud Strife, an aloof mercenary who claims to be a former 1st Class SOLDIER. Early on, he works with two members of AVALANCHE: Barret Wallace, its brazen but fatherly leader; and Tifa Lockhart, a shy yet nurturing martial artist and his childhood friend. During their journey, they meet Aerith Gainsborough, a carefree flower merchant and one of the last surviving Cetra; Red XIII, an intelligent feline from a tribe that protects the planet; Cait Sith, a fortune-telling robotic cat controlled by repentant Shinra staff member Reeve; and Cid Highwind, a pilot whose dream of being the first human in outer space was unrealized. The group can also recruit Yuffie Kisaragi, a young ninja and skilled Materia thief; and Vincent Valentine, a former Turk and victim of Shinra's experiments. The game's main antagonists are Rufus Shinra, the son of President Shinra and the later leader of the Shinra Corporation; Sephiroth, a former SOLDIER who reappears several years after being presumed dead; and Jenova, a hostile extraterrestrial life-form who the Cetra imprisoned 2,000 years ago and who Sephiroth was created from. A key character in Cloud's backstory is Zack Fair, a member of SOLDIER and Aerith's first love.\nPlot.\nAVALANCHE destroys a Shinra Mako reactor in Midgar, but an attack on another reactor goes wrong and Cloud falls into the city's slums. There, he meets Aerith and protects her from Shinra. Meanwhile, Shinra finds AVALANCHE's base of operations and intentionally collapses part of the upper city level in retaliation for the Mako reactor being destroyed, killing many AVALANCHE members and innocent bystanders as collateral damage. Aerith is also captured since Shinra believes that as a Cetra, she can potentially reveal the \"Promised Land\", which they believe is overflowing with Lifestream energy they can exploit. Cloud, Barret, and Tifa rescue Aerith, and during their escape from Midgar, discover that Sephiroth murdered President Shinra despite being presumed dead five years earlier. The party pursues Sephiroth across the Planet, with now-President Rufus on their trail; they are soon joined by the rest of the playable characters.\nAt a Cetra temple, Sephiroth reveals he intends to use a powerful magical artifact known as \"Black Materia\" to cast the spell \"Meteor\", which would have a devastating impact on the Planet. Sephiroth claims he will absorb the Lifestream as it attempts to heal the wound caused by Meteor, and become a god-like being in the process. The party retrieves the Black Materia, but Sephiroth manipulates Cloud into surrendering it. Aerith departs alone to stop Sephiroth and follows him to an abandoned Cetra city. While Aerith prays to the Planet for help, Sephiroth attempts to force Cloud to kill her; after this fails, he kills her himself before fleeing, leaving the White Materia behind. The party then learns of Jenova, a hostile alien lifeform who landed on the Planet two thousand years prior to the game's events. Upon arrival on the Planet, Jenova began infecting the Cetra with a virus, and they were nearly wiped out. However, a small group managed to seal away Jenova in a tomb, which Shinra later unearthed. At Nibelheim, Jenova's cells were used in experiments which led to the creation of Sephiroth. Five years before the game's events, Sephiroth and Cloud visited Nibelheim, where Sephiroth learned of his origins and was driven insane as a result. He murdered the townspeople, and then vanished after Cloud confronted him.\nAt the Northern Crater, the party learns that the \"Sephiroths\" they have encountered are Jenova clones who the insane Shinra scientist Hojo created. Cloud confronts the real Sephiroth as he is killing his clones to reunite Jenova's cells, but is again manipulated into giving him the Black Materia. Sephiroth then taunts Cloud by showing another SOLDIER in his place in his memories of Nibelheim, suggesting that Cloud is a failed clone of Sephiroth. Sephiroth summons Meteor and seals the Crater as Cloud falls into the Lifestream and Rufus captures the party.\nAfter escaping Shinra, the party discovers Cloud at an island hospital in a catatonic state from Mako poisoning, and Tifa decides to stay as his caretaker. When a planetary defense force called Weapon attacks the island, the two fall into the Lifestream, where Tifa helps Cloud reconstruct his memories. Cloud was a mere infantryman who was never accepted into SOLDIER; the SOLDIER in his memories was his friend Zack. At Nibelheim, Cloud ambushed and wounded Sephiroth after the latter's mental breakdown, but Jenova preserved Sephiroth's life. Hojo experimented on Cloud and Zack for four years, injecting them with Jenova's cells and Mako. They managed to escape, but Zack was killed in the process. The trauma of these events triggered an identity crisis in Cloud, and he constructed a false persona based around Zack's stories and his own fantasies. Cloud accepts his past and reunites with the party, who learn that Aerith's prayer to the Planet had been successful: the Planet had attempted to summon Holy to prevent Meteor's impact, but Sephiroth prevented it from having any effect.\nShinra fails to destroy Meteor, but manages to defeat a Weapon and puncture the Northern Crater as Rufus seemingly dies in the process. After killing Hojo, who is revealed to be Sephiroth's biological father, the party descends to the Planet's core through the opening in the Northern Crater and defeats both Jenova and Sephiroth. The party escapes and Holy is summoned once again, destroying Meteor with help from the Lifestream. Five hundred years later, Red XIII is seen with two cubs looking out over the ruins of Midgar, which are now covered in greenery, showing that the planet has healed.\nDevelopment.\nInitial concept talks for \"Final Fantasy VII\" began in 1994 at Square studio, following the completion of \"Final Fantasy VI\". As with the previous installment, series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi reduced his role to producer and granted others a more active role in development: these included Yoshinori Kitase, one of the directors of \"FFVI\". The next installment was planned as a 2D game for Nintendo's Super Nintendo Entertainment System (Super NES). After creating an early 2D prototype of it, the team postponed development to help finish \"Chrono Trigger\". Once \"Chrono Trigger\" was completed, the team resumed discussions for \"Final Fantasy VII\" in 1995.\nThe team discussed continuing the 2D strategy, which would have been the safe and immediate path just prior to the imminent industry shift toward 3D gaming; such a change would require radical new development models. The team decided to take the riskier option and make a 3D game on new generation hardware but had yet to choose between the cartridge-based Nintendo 64 or the CD-ROM-based PlayStation from Sony Computer Entertainment. The team also considered the Sega Saturn console and Microsoft Windows. Their decision was influenced by two factors: a highly successful tech demo based on \"Final Fantasy VI\" using the new Softimage 3D software, and the escalating price of cartridge-based games, which was limiting Square's audience. Tests were made for a Nintendo 64 version, which would use the planned 64DD peripheral despite the lack of 64DD development kits and the prototype device's changing hardware specifications. This version was discarded during early testing, as the 2000 polygons needed to render the Behemoth monster placed excessive strain on the Nintendo 64 hardware, causing a low frame rate. It would have required an estimated thirty 64DD discs to run \"Final Fantasy VII\" properly with the data compression methods of the day. Faced with both technical and economic issues on Nintendo's current hardware, and impressed by the increased storage capacity of CD-ROM when compared to the Nintendo 64 cartridge, Square shifted development of \"Final Fantasy VII\", and all other planned projects, onto the PlayStation.\nThe \"Final Fantasy 7\" staff at one point were planning to use a first person camera for world map exploration with enemies visible on the world map terrain and also wanted up to 10 characters to be in your party at once in the battle scenes. In the final version, the overall gameplay system remained mostly unchanged from \"Final Fantasy V\" and \"VI\", but with an emphasis on player control. The initial decision was for battles to feature shifting camera angles. Battle arenas had a lower polygon count than field areas, which made creating distinctive features more difficult. The summon sequences benefited strongly from the switch to the cinematic style, as the team had struggled to portray their scale using 2D graphics. In his role as producer, Sakaguchi placed much of his effort into developing the battle system. He proposed the Materia system as a way to provide more character customization than previous \"Final Fantasy\" games: battles no longer revolved around characters with innate skills and roles in battle, as Materia could be reconfigured between battles. Artist Tetsuya Nomura also contributed to the gameplay; he designed the Limit Break system as an evolution of the Desperation Attacks used in \"Final Fantasy VI\". The Limit Breaks served a purpose in gameplay while also evoking each character's personality in battle.\nSquare retained the passion-based game development approach from their earlier projects, but now had the resources and ambition to create the game they wanted. This was because they had extensive capital from their earlier commercial successes, which meant they could focus on quality and scale rather than obsessing over and working around their budget. \"Final Fantasy VII\" was at the time one of the most expensive video game projects ever, costing an estimated US$40 million, which adjusted for inflation came to $61 million in 2017. Development of the final version took a staff of between 100 and 150 people just over a year to complete. As video game development teams were usually only 20 people, the game had what was described as the largest development team of any game up to that point. The development team was split between both Square's Japanese offices and its new American office in Los Angeles; the American team worked primarily on city backgrounds.\nArt design.\nThe game's art director was Yusuke Naora, who had previously worked as a designer for \"Final Fantasy VI\". With the switch into 3D, Naora realized that he needed to relearn drawing, as 3D visuals require a very different approach than 2D. With the massive scale and scope of the project, Naora was granted a team devoted entirely to the game's visual design. The department's duties included illustration, modeling of 3D characters, texturing, the creation of environments, visual effects, and animation. The Shinra logo, which incorporated a kanji symbol, was drawn by Naora personally. Promotional artwork, in addition to the logo artwork, was created by Yoshitaka Amano, an artist whose association with the series went back to its inception. While he had taken a prominent role in earlier entries, Amano was unable to do so for \"Final Fantasy VII\", due to commitments at overseas exhibitions. His logo artwork was based on Meteor: when he saw images of Meteor, he was not sure how to turn it into suitable artwork. In the end, he created multiple variations of the image and asked staff to choose which they preferred. The green coloring represents the predominant lighting in Midgar and the color of the Lifestream, while the blue reflected the ecological themes present in the story. Its coloring directly influenced the general coloring of the game's environments.\nAnother prominent artist was Nomura. Having impressed Sakaguchi with his proposed ideas, which were handwritten and illustrated rather than simply typed on a PC, Nomura was brought on as main character designer. Nomura stated that when he was brought on, the main scenario had not been completed, but he \"went along like, 'I guess first off you need a hero and a heroine', and from there drew the designs while thinking up details about the characters. After [he'd] done the hero and heroine, [he] carried on drawing by thinking what kind of characters would be interesting to have. When [he] handed over the designs [he'd] tell people the character details [he'd] thought up, or write them down on a separate sheet of paper\". Something that could not be carried over from earlier titles was the chibi sprite art, as that would not fit with the new graphical direction. Naora, in his role as an assistant character designer and art director, helped adjust each character's appearance so the actions they performed were believable. When designing Cloud and Sephiroth, Nomura was influenced by his view of their rivalry mirroring the legendary animosity between Miyamoto Musashi and Sasaki Kojir\u014d, with Cloud and Sephiroth being Musashi and Kojir\u014d respectively. Sephiroth's look was defined as \"kakkoii\", a Japanese term combining good looks with coolness. Several of Nomura's designs evolved substantially during development. Cloud's original design of slicked-back black hair was deemed \"not very heroic\", so developers changed his hair color to bright blond. Vincent's occupation changed from researcher to detective to chemist, and finally to a former Turk with a tragic past.\nScenario.\nSakaguchi was responsible for writing the initial plot, which was quite different from the final version. In this draft for the planned SNES version, the game's setting was envisioned as New York City in 1999. Similar to the final story, the main characters were part of an organization trying to destroy Mako reactors, but they were pursued by a hot-blooded detective named Joe. The main characters would eventually blow up the city. An early version of the Lifestream concept was present at this stage. According to Sakaguchi, his mother had died while \"Final Fantasy III\" was being developed, and choosing life as a theme helped him cope with her passing in a rational and analytical manner. Square eventually used the New York setting in \"Parasite Eve\" (1998). While the planned concept was dropped, \"Final Fantasy VII\" still marked a drastic shift in setting from previous entries, dropping the Medieval fantasy elements in favor of a world that was \"ambiguously futuristic\".\nWhen Kitase was put in charge of \"Final Fantasy VII\", he and Nomura reworked the entire initial plot. Scenario writer Kazushige Nojima joined the team after finishing work on \"Bahamut Lagoon\". While \"Final Fantasy VI\" featured an ensemble cast of numerous playable characters that were equally important, the team soon decided to develop a central protagonist for \"FFVII\". The pursuit of Sephiroth that formed most of the main narrative was suggested by Nomura, as nothing similar had been done in the series before. Kitase and Nojima conceived AVALANCHE and Shinra as opposing organizations and created Cloud's backstory as well as his relationship to Sephiroth. Among Nojima's biggest contributions to the plot were Cloud's memories and split personality; this included the eventual conclusion involving his newly created character of Zack. The crew helped Kitase adjust the specifics of Sakaguchi's original Lifestream concept.\nRegarding the overall theme of the game, Sakaguchi said it was \"not enough to make 'life' the theme, you need to depict living and dying. In any event, you need to portray death\". Consequently, Nomura proposed killing off the heroine. Aerith had been the only heroine, but the death of a female protagonist would necessitate a second; this led to the creation of Tifa. The developers decided to kill Aerith, as her death would be the most devastating and consequential. Kitase wanted to depict it as very sudden and unexpected, leaving \"not a dramatic feeling but great emptiness\", \"feelings of reality and not Hollywood\". The script for the scene was written by Nojima. Kitase and Nojima then planned that most of the main cast would die shortly before the final battle; Nomura vetoed the idea because he felt it would undermine the impact of Aerith's death. Several character relations and statuses underwent changes during development. Aerith was to be Sephiroth's sister, which influenced the design of her hair. The team then made Sephiroth a previous love interest of hers to deepen her backstory, but later swapped him with Zack. Vincent and Yuffie were to be part of the main narrative, but due to time constraints, they were nearly cut and eventually relegated to being optional characters.\nNojima was charged with writing the scenario and unifying the team's ideas into a cohesive narrative, as Kitase was impressed with his earlier work on the mystery-like \"Heracles no Eik\u014d III: Kamigami no Chinmoku\", an entry in the \"Glory of Heracles\" series. To make the characters more realistic, Nojima wrote scenes in which they would occasionally argue and raise objections: while this inevitably slowed down the pace of the story, it added depth to the characters. The graphical improvements allowed even relatively bland lines of dialogue to be enhanced with reactions and poses from the 3D character models. Voice acting would have led to significant load times, so it was omitted. Masato Kato wrote several late-game scenes, including the Lifestream sequence and Cloud and Tifa's conversation before the final battle. Initially unaffiliated with the project, Kato was called on to help flesh out less important story scenes. He wrote his scenes to his own tastes without outside consultation, something he later regretted.\nGraphics.\nWith the shift from the SNES to the next generation consoles, \"Final Fantasy VII\" became the first project in the series to use 3D computer graphics. Aside from the story, \"Final Fantasy VI\" had many details undecided when development began; most design elements were hashed out along the way. In contrast, with \"Final Fantasy VII\", the developers knew from the outset it was going to be \"a real 3D game\", so from the earliest planning stage, detailed designs were in existence. The script was also finalized, and the image for the graphics had been fleshed out. This meant that when actual development work began, storyboards for the game were already in place. The shift from cartridge ROM to CD-ROM posed some problems: according to lead programmer Ken Narita, the CD-ROM had a slower access speed, delaying some actions during the game, so the team needed to overcome this issue. Certain tricks were used to conceal load times, such as offering animations to keep players from getting bored. When it was decided to use 3D graphics, there was a discussion among the staff whether to use sprite-based characters on 3D backgrounds or fully rendered polygonal models. While sprites proved more popular with the staff, the polygon models were chosen as they could better express emotion. This decision was influenced by the team's exposure to the 3D character models used in \"Alone in the Dark\". Sakaguchi decided to use deformed models for field navigation and real-time event scenes, for better expression of emotion, while realistically proportioned models would be used in battles. The team purchased Silicon Graphics Onyx supercomputers and related workstations, and accompanying software including Softimage 3D, PowerAnimator, and N-World for an estimated total of $21 million. Many team members had never seen the technology before.\nThe transition from 2D graphics to 3D environments overlaid on pre-rendered backgrounds was accompanied by a focus on a more realistic presentation. In previous entries, the sizes for characters and environments were fixed, and the player saw things from a scrolling perspective. This changed with \"Final Fantasy VII\"; environments shifted with camera angles, and character model sizes shifted depending on both their place in the environment and their distance from the camera, giving a sense of scale. The choice of this highly cinematic style of storytelling, contrasting directly with Square's previous games, was attributed to Kitase, who was a fan of films and had an interest in the parallels between film and video game narrative. Character movement during in-game events was done by the character designers in the planning group. While designers normally cooperate with a motion specialist for such animations, the designers taught themselves motion work, resulting in each character's movements differing depending on their creators\u2014some designers liked exaggerated movements, while others went for subtlety. Much of the time was spent on each character's day-to-day, routine animations. Motion specialists were brought in for the game's battle animations. The first characters the team worked with were Cloud and Barret. Some of the real-time effects, such as an explosion near the opening, were hand-drawn rather than computer-animated.\nThe main creative force behind the overall 3D presentation was Kazuyuki Hashimoto, the general supervisor for these sequences. Being experienced in the new technology the team had brought on board, he accepted the post at Square as the team aligned with his own creative spirit. One of the major events in development was when the real-time graphics were synchronized to computer-generated full motion video (FMV) cutscenes for some story sequences, notably an early sequence where a real-time model of Cloud jumps onto an FMV-rendered moving train. The backgrounds were created by overlaying two 2D graphic layers and changing the motion speed of each to simulate depth perception. While this was not a new technique, the increased power of the PlayStation enabled a more elaborate version of this effect. The biggest issue with the 3D graphics was the large memory storage gap between the development hardware and the console: while the early 3D tech demo had been developed on a machine with over 400 megabytes of total memory, the PlayStation only had two megabytes of system memory and 500 kilobytes for texture memory. The team needed to figure out how to shrink the amount of data while preserving the desired effects. This was aided with reluctant help from Sony, who had hoped to keep Square's direct involvement limited to a standard API package, but they eventually relented and allowed the team direct access to the hardware specifications.\n\"Final Fantasy VII\" features two types of cutscenes: real-time cutscenes featuring polygon models on pre-rendered backgrounds, and FMV cutscenes. The game's computer-generated imagery (CGI) FMVs were produced by Visual Works, a then-new subsidiary of Square that specialized in computer graphics and FMVs creation. Visual Works had created the initial movie concept for a 3D game project. The FMVs were created by an international team, covering both Japan and North America and involving talent from the gaming and film industry; Western contributors included artists and staff who had worked on the \"Star Wars\" film series, \"Jurassic Park\", \"\", and \"True Lies\". The team tried to create additional optional CGI content which would bring optional characters Vincent and Yuffie into the ending. As this would have further increased the number of discs the game needed, the idea was discarded. Kazuyuki Ikumori, a future key figure at Visual Works, helped with the creation of the CGI cutscenes, in addition to general background design. The CGI FMV sequences total around 40 minutes of footage, something only possible with the PlayStation's extra memory space and graphical power. This innovation brought with it the added difficulty of ensuring that the inferiority of the in-game graphics in comparison to the FMV sequences was not too obvious. Kitase has described the process of making the in-game environments as detailed as possible to be \"a daunting task\".\nMusic.\nThe musical score of \"Final Fantasy VII\" was composed, arranged, and produced by Nobuo Uematsu, who had served as the sole composer for the six previous \"Final Fantasy\" games. Originally, Uematsu had planned to use CD quality music with vocal performances to take advantage of the console's audio capabilities but found that it resulted in the game having much longer loading times for each area. Uematsu then decided that the higher-quality audio was not worth the trade-off with performance, and opted instead to use MIDI-like sounds produced by the console's internal sound sequencer, similar to how his soundtracks for the previous games in the series on the Super NES were implemented. While the Super NES only had eight sound channels to work with, the PlayStation had twenty-four. Eight were reserved for sound effects, leaving sixteen available for the music. Uematsu's approach to composing the game's music was to treat it like a film soundtrack and compose music that reflected the mood of the scenes, rather than trying to make strong melodies to \"define the game\", as he felt that approach would come across too strong when placed alongside the game's new 3D visuals. As an example, he composed the track intended for the scene in the game where Aerith Gainsborough is killed to be \"sad but beautiful\", rather than more overtly emotional, creating what he felt was a more understated feeling. Uematsu additionally said that the soundtrack had a feel of \"realism\", which also prevented him from using \"exorbitant, crazy music\".\nThe first piece that Uematsu composed for the game was the opening theme; game director Yoshinori Kitase showed him the opening cinematic and asked him to begin the project there. The track was well received in the company, which gave Uematsu \"a sense that it was going to be a really good project\". \"Final Fantasy VII\" was the first game in the series to include a track with high-quality digitized vocals, \"One-Winged Angel\", which accompanies a section of the final battle of the game. The track has been called Uematsu's \"most recognizable contribution\" to the music of the \"Final Fantasy\" series, which Uematsu agrees with. Inspired by \"The Rite of Spring\" by Igor Stravinsky to make a more \"classical\" track, and by rock and roll music from the late 1960s and early 1970s to make an orchestral track with a \"destructive impact\", he spent two weeks composing short unconnected musical phrases, and then arranged them together into \"One-Winged Angel\", an approach he had never used before.\nMusic from the game has been released in several albums. Square released the main soundtrack album, \"Final Fantasy VII Original Soundtrack\", on four Compact Discs through its DigiCube subsidiary in 1997. A limited edition release was also produced, containing illustrated liner notes. The regular edition of the album reached third on the Japan Oricon charts, while the limited edition reached #19. Overall, the album had sold nearly 150,000 copies by January 2010. A single-disc album of selected tracks from the original soundtrack, along with three arranged pieces, titled \"Final Fantasy VII Reunion Tracks\", was also released by DigiCube in 1997, reaching #20 on the Japan Oricon charts. A third album, \"Piano Collections Final Fantasy VII\", was released by DigiCube in 2003, and contains one disc of piano arrangements of tracks from the game. It was arranged by Shir\u014d Hamaguchi and performed by Seiji Honda, and reached #228 on the Oricon charts.\nRelease.\n\"Final Fantasy VII\" was announced in February 1996. Square president and chief executive officer Tomoyuki Takechi were fairly confident about Japanese players making the game a commercial success despite it being on a new platform. A playable demo was included on a disc giveaway at the 1996 Tokyo Game Show, dubbed \"Square's Preview Extra: Final Fantasy VII &amp; Siggraph '95 Works\". The disc also included the early test footage Square created using characters from \"Final Fantasy VI\". The initial release date was at some point in 1996, but to properly realize their vision, Square postponed the release date almost a full year. \"Final Fantasy VII\" was released on January 31, 1997. It was published in Japan by Square. A re-release of the game based on its Western version, titled \"Final Fantasy VII International\", was released on October 2 the same year. This improved \"International\" version would kickstart the trend for Square to create an updated version for the Japanese release, based on the enhanced Western versions. The \"International\" version was re-released as a physical disc as part of the \"Final Fantasy 25th Anniversary Ultimate Box\" Japanese package on December 18, 2012.\nWhile its success in Japan had been taken for granted by Square executives, North America and Europe were another matter, as up to that time the Japanese role-playing genre was still a niche market in Western territories. Sony, due to the PlayStation's struggles against Nintendo and Sega's home consoles, lobbied for the publishing rights in North America and Europe following \"Final Fantasy VII\"'s transfer to PlayStation\u2014to further persuade Square, Sony offered a lucrative royalties deal with profits potentially equaling those Square would get by self-publishing the game. Square accepted Sony's offer as Square itself lacked Western publishing experience. Square was uncertain about the game's success, as other JRPGs including \"Final Fantasy VI\" had met with poor sales outside Japan. To help with promoting the title overseas, Square dissolved their original Washington offices and hired new staff for fresh offices in Costa Mesa. It was first exhibited to the Western public at Electronic Entertainment Expo 1996 (E3).\nTo promote the game overseas, Square and Sony launched a widespread three-month advertising campaign in August 1997. Beginning with a television commercial that ran alongside popular shows such as \"Saturday Night Live\" and \"The Simpsons\" by TBWA\\Chiat\\Day, the campaign included numerous articles in both gaming and general interest magazines, advertisements in comics from publishers such as DC Comics and Marvel Comics, a special collaboration with Pepsi, media events, sample discs, and merchandise. According to estimations by Takechi, the total worldwide marketing budget came to US$40 million; $10 million had been spent in Japan, $10 million in Europe, and $20 million in North America. Unlike its predecessors, \"Final Fantasy VII\" did not have its numeral adjusted to account for the lack of a Western release for \"Final Fantasy II\", \"III\", and \"V\" \u2014 while only the fourth \"Final Fantasy\" released outside Japan, its Japanese title was retained. It was released in North America on September 7, 1997. The game was released in Europe on November 17, becoming the first \"Final Fantasy\" game to be released in Europe. The Western version included additional elements and alterations, such as streamlining of the menu and Materia system, reducing the health of enemies, new visual cues to help with navigation across the world map, and additional cutscenes relating to Cloud's past.\nPC version.\nA version for PC was developed by Square's Costa Mesa offices. Square invested in a PC version to reach as wide a player base as possible; many Western consumers did not own a PlayStation, and Square's deal with Sony did not prohibit such a port. Having never released a title for PC, Square decided to treat the port as a sales experiment. The port was handled by a team of 15 to 20 people, mostly from Costa Mesa but with help from Tokyo. Square did not begin the port until the console version was finished. The team needed to rewrite an estimated 80% of the game's code, due to the need to unify what had been a custom build for a console written by multiple staff members. Consequently, programmers faced problems such as having to unify the original PlayStation version's five different game engines, leading to delays. The PC version came with a license for Yamaha Corporation's software synthesizer S-YXG70, allowing high-quality sequenced music despite varying sound hardware setups on different user computers. The conversion of the nearly 100 original musical pieces to XG format files was done by Yamaha.\nTo maximize their chances of success, Square searched for a Western company to assist with releasing the PC version. Eidos Interactive, whose release of \"Tomb Raider\" had turned them into a publishing giant, agreed to market and publish the port. The port was announced in December 1997, along with Eidos' exclusivity deal for North America and Europe at the time, though the port was rumored to happen as early as December 1996, prior to the PlayStation version's release. To help the product stand out in stores, Eidos chose a trapezoidal shape for the cover and box. They agreed on a contract price of $1.8 million, making initial sales forecasts of 100,000 units based on that outlay. The PC version was released in North America and Europe on June 25, 1998; the port was not released in Japan. Within one month, sales of the port exceeded the initial forecasts. The PC version would end up providing the source code for subsequent ports.\nLocalization.\nLocalization of \"Final Fantasy VII\" was handled internally by Square. The English localization, led by Seth Luisi, was completed by a team of about fifty people and faced a variety of problems. According to Luisi, the biggest hurdle was making \"the direct Japanese-to-English text translation read correctly in English. The sentence structure and grammar rules for the Japanese language is very different from English\", making it difficult for the translation to read like native English without distorting the meaning. Michael Basket was the sole translator for the project, though he received the help of native Japanese speakers from the Tokyo office. The localization was taxing for the team due to their inexperience, lack of professional editors, and poor communication between the North American and Japanese offices. A result of this disconnect was the original localization of Aerith's name\u2014which was intended as a conflation of \"air\" and \"earth\"\u2014as \"Aeris\" due to a lack of communication between localization staff and the QA team.\nThe team also faced several technical issues due to programming practices which took little account of subsequent localization, such as dealing with a fixed-width font and having to insert kanji through language input keys to add special characters (for example, vowels with diacritics) to keep the code working. Consequently, the text was still read as Japanese by the word processor; the computer's spellcheck could not be used, and mistakes had to be caught manually. The code used obscure kanji to refer to main character's names, which made it unintuitive for the translators to identify characters. Translated text usually takes up more space than the Japanese text, though still had to fit to the screen appropriately without overusing page breaks (for example, item names, which are written in kanji in Japanese language, could overflow message windows in translated text); to mitigate this problem, a proportional typeface was implemented into the source code to fit more text into the screen. Swear words were used frequently in the localization to help convey the original Japanese meaning, though most profanities were censored in a manner described by Square employee Richard Honeywood as the \"old comic book '@#$%!'-type replacement\". The European release was described as being in a worse condition, as the translations into multiple European languages were outsourced by Sony to another company, further hindering communication. For the PC port, Square attempted to fix translation and grammar mistakes for the North American and European versions but did not have the time and budget to retranslate all the text. According to Honeywood, the success of \"Final Fantasy VII\" in the West encouraged Square to focus more on localization quality; on future games, Square hired additional translators and editors, while also streamlining communication between the development and localization teams.\nSome months prior to the game's North American release, Sony publicly stated that it was considering cutting the scene at the Honey Bee Inn due to the salacious content, prompting numerous online petitions and letters of protest from RPG fans. Square subsequently stated that it would never allow Sony to localize the game in any way. In addition to translating the text, the North American localization team made tweaks to the gameplay, including reducing the enemy encounter rate, simplifying the Materia menu, and adding new boss fights.\nLater releases.\nThe \"International\" version of \"Final Fantasy VII\" was released on PlayStation Network (PSN) as a PSOne Classic in Japan on April 10, 2009. This version was compatible with both PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable with support for PlayStation Vita and PlayStation TV coming later. \"Final Fantasy VII\" was later released as a PSOne Classic in North America, Europe, and Australia on June 2. The PC version was updated by DotEmu for use on modern operating systems and released via Square Enix's North American and European online stores on August 14, 2012. It included high-resolution support, cloud saves, achievements and a character booster. It would later be released via Steam on July 4, 2013, replacing the version available on Square Enix's North American and European online stores. The PC version would be released in Japan for the first time on May 16, 2013, exclusively via Square Enix's Japanese online store with the \"International\" version title. It has features unavailable in the western version including high-speed mode, no random encounters mode, and a max stats command. A release for iOS, based on the PC version and adjusted for mobile devices by D4 Enterprise, was released on August 19, 2015, with an auto-save feature. The PC version was released for PlayStation 4 on December 5, 2015. DotEmu developed the PS4 version, which included the E3 2015 reveal trailer for \"Final Fantasy VII Remake\". The game was also released for Android on July 7, 2016, for the PlayStation Classic on December 3, 2018, and for the Nintendo Switch and Xbox One, also developed by DotEmu, worldwide on March 26, 2019.\nReception.\nCommercial.\nWithin three days of its release in Japan, \"Final Fantasy VII\" sold over two million copies. This popularity inspired thousands of retailers in North America to break street dates in September to meet public demand for the title. In the game's debut weekend in North America, it sold 330,000 copies, and had reached sales of 500,000 copies in less than three weeks. The momentum established in the game's opening weeks continued for several months; Sony announced the game had sold one million copies in North America by early December, prompting business analyst Edward Williams from Monness, Crespi, Hardt &amp; Co. to comment that \"Sony redefined the role-playing game (RPG) category and expanded the conventional audience with the launch of \"Final Fantasy VII\"\". According to \"Weekly Famitsu\", \"Final Fantasy VII\" sold 3.27 million units in Japan by the end of 1997.\nBy the end of 2005, the PlayStation version had sold 9.8 million copies including 4 million sales in Japan, making it the highest-selling game in the \"Final Fantasy\" series. By the end of 2006, \"The Best\", the bargain reissue of the game, had sold over 158,000 copies in Japan. By May 2010, it had sold over 10 million copies worldwide, making it the most popular title in the series in terms of units sold. The original PC version surpassed Eidos' expectations: while initially forecast to sell 100,000 units, it quickly exceeded sales of one million units, garnering royalties of over $2 million for Square. By August 2015, the PlayStation and PC versions had sold over 11 million units worldwide. \"Steam Spy\" estimated the game to have sold over 1.2 million downloads on Steam as of April 2018, with a later Steam leak estimating it had 1.14 million players on the platform as of July 2018. As of June 2020, the game has sold more than 13.3 million units worldwide. As of September 2025, the original version of the game has sold over 15.3 million units worldwide.\nCritical.\n\"Final Fantasy VII\" received acclaim from critics upon release, receiving perfect scores from \"1Up.com\", \"AllGame\", \"Computer and Video Games\", \"GameFan\", \"GamePro\", \"Next Generation\", and official PlayStation magazines for Australia and the United States.\nIt was referred to by \"GameFan\" as \"quite possibly the greatest game ever made\", a quote selected for the back cover of the game's jewel case. \"GameSpot\" commented that \"never before have technology, playability, and narrative combined as well as in \"Final Fantasy VII\"\", expressing particular favor toward the game's graphics, audio, and story. The four reviewers of \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" unanimously gave it a 9.5 out of 10 and their \"Game of the Month\" award, lauding its rendered backgrounds, use of FMV, battles, and especially the story line, though they expressed disappointment that the ending did not resolve all of the loose ends. They also considered the North American localization a dramatic improvement over the original Japanese version. \"GamePro\" called the storytelling \"dramatic, sentimental, and touching in a way that draws you into the characters\", who \"come alive thanks to sweetly subtle body movements\". Both \"GamePro\" and \"Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine\" (\"OPM\") said the ATB system gives battles a tension and urgency not usually seen in RPGs, and OPM called the summon animations \"absolutely awe-inspiring\". \"IGN\"'s Jay Boor insisted the game's graphics were \"light years beyond anything ever seen on the PlayStation\", and regarded its battle system as its strongest point.\n\"Computer and Video Games\"'s Alex C praised the dramatic story and well-developed characters. In addition to calling the graphics \"bar none the best the PlayStation has ever seen\", \"Next Generation\" said of the story that \"while \"FFVII\" may take a bit to get going, as in every entry in the series, moments of high melodrama are blended with scenes of sheer poetry and vision\". \"Edge\" noted that \"Final Fantasy VII\" had come close to being an interactive movie in playable form, praising its combination of a complex story that went against Western graphic adventures trends and \"excellently orchestrated chip music\". \"RPGamer\" praised the game's soundtrack, both in variety and sheer volume, stating that \"Uematsu has done his work exceptionally well\" and saying that it was potentially his best work.\n\"Final Fantasy VII\" has received some negative criticism. \"OPM\" and \"GameSpot\" questioned the game's linear progression. \"OPM\" considered the game's translation \"a bit muddy\". Similarly, \"RPGamer\" cited its translation as \"packed with typos and other errors which further obscure what is already a very confusing plot\". \"GamePro\" also considered the Japanese-to-English translation a significant weakness in the game, and \"IGN\" regarded the ability to use only three characters at a time as \"the game's only shortcoming\".\nReviewers gave similar praise to the PC version but criticized its various technical faults. \"Computer Games Magazine\" said that no other recent game had the same \"tendency to fail to work in any capacity on multiple [computers]\". \"Computer Gaming World\" complained that the music quality suffered on PC sound cards, and \"Next Generation\" found the game's pre-rendered backgrounds significantly less impressive than those of the PlayStation version. However, the latter magazine found the higher-resolution battle visuals \"absolutely stunning\", and \"Computer Games Magazine\" said that they showed off the potential graphical power of PCs. All three magazines concluded by praising the game despite its technical flaws, and \"PC Gamer\" summarized that, while \"Square apparently did only what was required to get its PlayStation game running under Windows\", \"Final Fantasy VII\" is \"still a winner on the PC\".\nAwards.\n\"Final Fantasy VII\" was given numerous Game of the Year awards in 1997. At the second CESA Awards, it won the Grand Prize, Scenario Award and Sound Award. During the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences' inaugural Interactive Achievement Awards, \"Final Fantasy VII\" won in the categories of \"Console Adventure Game of the Year\" and \"Console Role-Playing Game of the Year\"; it also received nominations for \"Interactive Title of the Year\", \"Console Game of the Year\", \"Outstanding Achievement in Art/Graphics\", and \"Outstanding Achievement in Interactive Design\". In the Origins Awards, it won in the category \"Best Roleplaying Computer Game of 1997\". \"Final Fantasy VII\" was awarded Game of the Year by magazines including \"Game Informer\", \"GamePro\", and \"Hyper\". It was also awarded the \"Readers' Choice All Systems Game of the Year\", \"Readers' Choice PlayStation Game of the Year\" and \"Readers' Choice Role-Playing Game of the Year\" by \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" (\"EGM\"), which gave it Editors' Choice Awards for \"Role-Playing Game of the Year\" and \"Best Graphics\" (plus a runner-up slot for \"Game of the Year\"), and also gave it awards for \"Hottest Video Game Babe\" (for Tifa Lockhart), \"Most Hype for a Game\", \"Best Ending\", and \"Best Print Ad\".\nSince 1997, it has been selected by many game magazines as one of the top video games of all time, listed as 91st in \"EGM\"'s 2001 \"100 Best Games of All Time\", and as fourth in \"Retro Gamer\"'s \"Top 100 Games\" in 2004. In 2018, it was ranked 99th in \"IGN\"'s \"Top 100 Games of All Time\" and as third in \"PALGN\"'s \"The Greatest 100 Games Ever\". \"Final Fantasy VII\" was included in \"The Greatest Games of All Time\" list by \"GameSpot\" in 2006, and ranked as second in \"Empire\"'s 2006 \"100 Greatest Games of All Time\", as third in \"Stuff\"'s \"100 Greatest Games\" in 2008 and as 15th in \"Game Informer\"'s 2009 \"Top 200 Games of All Time\" (down five places from its previous best games of all-time list). \"GameSpot\" placed it as the second most influential game ever made in 2002; in 2007, \"GamePro\" ranked it 14th on the list of the most important games of all time, and in 2009 it finished in the same place on their list of the most innovative games of all time. In 2012, \"Time\" named it one of their \"All-Time 100 Video Games\". In March 2018, \"Game Informer\"'s \"Readers Choice Top 300 Games of All Time\", \"Final Fantasy VII\" ranked in seventh place. In March 2018, \"GamesRadar+\" rated \"The 25 best PS1 games of all time\", \"Final Fantasy VII\" was ranked in 12th place.\nIt has also appeared in numerous other greatest game lists. In 2007, \"Dengeki PlayStation\" gave it the \"Best Story\", \"Best RPG\" and \"Best Overall Game\" retrospective awards for games on the original PlayStation. The same year, \"Play\" magazine ranked it first place on its list of top 25 best role-playing games of all time. \"GamePro\" named it the best RPG title of all time in 2008, and featured it in their 2010 article \"The 30 Best PSN Games\". In 2012, \"GamesRadar\" also ranked it as the sixth saddest game ever. On the other hand, \"GameSpy\" ranked it seventh on their 2003 list of the most overrated games.\n\"Final Fantasy VII\" has often placed at or near the top of many reader polls of all-time best games. It was voted the \"Reader's Choice Game of the Century\" in an \"IGN\" poll in 2000, and placed second in the \"Top 100 Favorite Games of All Time\" by Japanese magazine \"Famitsu\" in 2006 (it was also voted as ninth in \"Famitsu\"'s 2011 poll of most tear-inducing games of all time). Users of \"GameFAQs\" voted it the \"Best Game Ever\" in 2004 and in 2005, and placed it second in 2009. In 2008, readers of \"Dengeki\" magazine voted it the best game ever made, as well as the ninth most tear-inducing game of all time.\nLegacy.\nThe game inspired an unofficial version for the NES by Chinese company Shenzhen Nanjing Technology. This port features the \"Final Fantasy VII\" game scaled back to 2D, with some of the side quests removed.\nThe game also inspired a \"LittleBigPlanet\" fan remake by Jamie Colliver. Colliver's adaptation reimagines the entire original game as a platformer and was awarded two Guinness World Records in 2014, for the first complete \"Final Fantasy\" remake made in another video game and the first role-playing game remade in \"LittleBigPlanet\". \nThe game's popularity and open-ended nature also led director Kitase and scenario writer Nojima to establish a plot-related connection between \"Final Fantasy VII\" and \"Final Fantasy X-2\". The character Shinra from \"X-2\" proposes the concept of extracting the life energy from within the planet Spira. Nojima has stated that Shinra and his proposal are a deliberate nod to the Shinra Company and that he envisioned the events of \"Final Fantasy X-2\" as a prequel to those in \"VII\". The advances in technology used to create the FMV sequences and computer graphics for \"Final Fantasy VII\" allowed Sakaguchi to begin production on the first \"Final Fantasy\" film, \"\". The game introduced a particular aesthetic to the series\u2014fantasy suffused with modern-to-advanced technology\u2014which was explored further in \"Final Fantasy VIII\", \"The Spirits Within\", and \"XV\". Re-releases of Square games in Japan with bonus features would occur frequently after the release of \"Final Fantasy VII International\". Later titles that would be re-released as international versions include \"Final Fantasy X\" and other follow-ups from the franchise, as well as the \"Kingdom Hearts\" series.\n\"Final Fantasy VII\" is credited as having the largest impact of the \"Final Fantasy\" series, and with allowing console role-playing games to gain mass-market appeal outside of Japan. Aerith's death in the game has often been referred to as one of the most significant moments from any video game. In addition, \"Final Fantasy VII\" is also noted for its use of the unreliable narrator literary concept, drawing comparisons to films such as \"Fight Club\" (1999), \"The Sixth Sense\" (1999), \"American Psycho\" (2000) and \"Memento\" (2000). Patrick Holleman and Jeremy Parish argue that the game takes the unreliable narrator concept a step further, with its interactivity establishing a connection between the player and the protagonist Cloud, setting \"Final Fantasy VII\" apart from films as well as other video games. According to Holleman, \"no RPG has ever deliberately betrayed the connection between protagonist and player like \"FFVII\" does\". Harry Mackin writing for \"Paste\" called the game \"a subversion that deconstructs and comments meaningfully on how we think about heroism, masculinity and identity in videogame storytelling\". Ric Manning of \"The Courier-Journal\" noted elements of psychoanalysis in the game. The game is also noted for its cyberpunk themes; \"GamesRadar+\" called it one of the best games of the genre, and \"Paste Magazine\" compared its cyberpunk city of Midgar to \"Akira\" and \"Blade Runner\". According to \"Comic Book Resources\", the game's climate change theme is more meaningful in 2019 than it was in 1997.\nSeveral characters from \"Final Fantasy VII\" have made cameo appearances in other Square Enix titles, most notably the fighting game \"Ehrgeiz\" and the popular \"Final-Fantasy\"-to-Disney crossover series \"Kingdom Hearts\". Additionally, fighting video game \"Dissidia Final Fantasy\" includes \"Final Fantasy VII\" characters such as Cloud and Sephiroth, and allows players to fight with characters from throughout the \"Final Fantasy\" series, and its follow-up, \"Dissidia 012\", included Tifa as well. Cloud is also a playable character in \"Final Fantasy Tactics\". In December 2015, Cloud was released as a downloadable content character for the Nintendo crossover fighting game \"Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U\", along with a stage based on Midgar. He returned in the 2018 sequel, \"Super Smash Bros. Ultimate\", with Sephiroth being added as downloadable content in December 2020.\nRelated media and merchandise.\nThe world of \"Final Fantasy VII\" is explored further in the \"Compilation of Final Fantasy VII\", a series of games, animated features, and short stories. The first title in the \"Compilation\" is the mobile game ', a prequel focusing on the Turks' activities six years before the original game. The CGI film sequel ', set two years after the game, was the first title announced but the second to be released. Special DVD editions of the film included ', an original video animation that recounts the destruction of Nibelheim. ' and its mobile phone counterpart, ', are third-person shooters set one year after \"Advent Children\". \"Dirge\" focuses on the backstory of Vincent Valentine, whose history was left mostly untold in \"Final Fantasy VII\". The most recent title is the PlayStation Portable game ', an action role-playing game that centers on Zack's past.\nReleases not under the \"Compilation\" label include \"Maiden Who Travels the Planet\", which follows Aerith's journey in the Lifestream after her death, taking place concurrently with the second half of the original game. In 1998, the \"Official Final Fantasy VII Strategy Guide\" was licensed by SquareSoft and published by Brady Games. \"Final Fantasy VII Snowboarding\" is a mobile port of the snowboard minigame featured in the original game, featuring different courses for the player to tackle. The game is downloadable on V Cast-compatible mobile phones and was first made available in 2005 in Japan and North America.\n\"Final Fantasy VII G-Bike\" is a mobile game released for iOS and Android in December 2014, based on the motorbike minigame featured in the original game. In September 2007, Square Enix published \"Final Fantasy VII 10th Anniversary Ultimania\". This book is an in-depth compilation of \"FFVII\" story-line and artwork. The Universal Studios Theme Park in Japan is developing a \"Final Fantasy VII\" themed virtual reality attraction.\nRemakes.\nWith the announcement and development of the \"Compilation of Final Fantasy VII\", speculation spread that a remake of the original \"Final Fantasy VII\" would be released for the PlayStation 3. This conjecture was sparked by the release of a video featuring the opening sequence of \"FFVII\" recreated using the PlayStation 3's graphical capabilities at E3 2005. After a decade of speculation, a remake was announced at E3 2015. The game saw changes made to its story and combat system. The game is planned to be released over three installments, with the first part being released for the PlayStation 4 in 2020. The follow-up, \"Final Fantasy VII Rebirth\", was released for PlayStation 5 in February 2024. \"\", a remaster of \"Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII\", which was released in December 2022, is also considered a prequel to the larger \"Final Fantasy VII Remake\" project.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "52757", "revid": "46096448", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52757", "title": "Final Fantasy VIII", "text": "1999 video game\nborder\n is a 1999 role-playing video game developed and published by Square for the PlayStation console. It is the eighth main installment in the \"Final Fantasy\" series. Set on an unnamed fantasy world with science fiction elements, the game follows a group of young mercenaries, led by Squall Leonhart, as they are drawn into a conflict sparked by a sorceress named Edea Kramer who seized control of a powerful military state. During the quest to defeat the sorceress and the forces manipulating her, Squall struggles with his role as leader and develops a romance with one of his comrades, Rinoa Heartilly.\nDevelopment began in 1997, during the English localization of \"Final Fantasy VII\". The game builds on the visual changes brought to the series by \"VII\", including the use of 3D graphics and pre-rendered backgrounds, while also departing from many \"Final Fantasy\" traditions. It is the first \"Final Fantasy\" to use realistically proportioned characters consistently, feature a vocal piece as its theme music and forgo the use of magic points for spellcasting.\n\"Final Fantasy VIII\" was critically acclaimed by critics. The game was a commercial success, grossing $ in its first day of release in Japan, and more than $ during its first 13 weeks in North America, making it the fastest-selling \"Final Fantasy\" title until \"Final Fantasy XIII\", a multi-platform release. A Windows port followed in 2000, with the addition of the \"Chocobo World\" minigame. \"Final Fantasy VIII\" was re-released worldwide as a PSOne Classic on the PlayStation Store in 2009, for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable, with support for PlayStation Vita in 2012. It was re-released via Steam in 2013. By August 2019, it had sold more than 9.6 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling \"Final Fantasy\" games in the series. A remastered version was released for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One in September 2019, and Android and iOS in March 2021.\nGameplay.\nLike the \"Final Fantasy\" games before it, \"Final Fantasy VIII\" consists of three main modes of play: the world map, the field map, and the battle screen. The world map is a 3D display in which the player may navigate freely across a small-scale rendering of the game world. Characters travel across the world map in a variety of ways, including by foot, car, Chocobo, train, and airship. The field map consists of controllable 3D characters overlaid on one or more 2D pre-rendered backgrounds, which represent environmental locations such as towns or forests. The battle screen is a 3D model of a location such as a street or room, where turn-based fights between playable characters and CPU-controlled enemies take place. The interface is menu-driven, as in previous titles, but with the typical weapon and armor systems removed and new features present, such as the Junction system. Also featured is a collectible card-based minigame called \"Triple Triad\".\nFor \"Final Fantasy VIII\", Hiroyuki Ito designed a battle system based on summoned monsters, called \"Guardian Forces\", abbreviated in-game as \"GF\". Assigning (\"junctioning\") a GF onto a character allows the player to use battle commands beyond \"Attack\" with the main weapon, such as Magic, GF (to have a junctioned GF perform an action), and Item. Previous titles provided each character with a limited pool of magic points that were consumed by each spell; in \"Final Fantasy VIII\", spells are acquired (\"drawn\") either from enemies in battle, Draw Points distributed throughout the environments, or by refining items and cards. Spells are then stocked on characters as quantified inventory (up to 100 per spell and limited to 32 distinct spells per character) and are consumed one by one when used. Characters can also junction (equip) these spells onto their statistics\u2014such as Strength, Vitality, and Luck\u2014for various bonuses, provided the character has junctioned a Guardian Force. The junction system's flexibility affords the player a wide range of customization.\nThese expanded mechanics for summons were a departure for the series; in previous titles, summons were relegated to a single action during battle. The junction system also acts as a substitute for armor and accessories, which were used in earlier games to modify character statistics. Moreover, where earlier titles required weapons to be equipped and tailored to the character, each major character in \"Final Fantasy VIII\" features a unique weapon which can be upgraded, affecting its appearance, power, and Limit Break.\nAs in \"Final Fantasy VII\", characters in \"VIII\" have unique abilities called \"Limit Breaks\", which range from powerful attacks to support spells. While the characters in \"Final Fantasy VII\" receive Limit Breaks after incurring significant damage, in \"VIII\", Limit Breaks become available only at low health (hit points) under normal circumstances. The magic spell \"Aura\" increases the probability of Limit Breaks appearing, regardless of a character's remaining hit points, while various status afflictions can prevent Limit Breaks. They are similar to the Desperation Attacks of \"Final Fantasy VI\", albeit more frequent. \"Final Fantasy VIII\" also introduced interactive elements to complement Limit Break animations. These interactive sequences, which vary between character, weapon, and Limit Break, range from randomly selected magic spells to precisely timed button inputs. Successfully completing an interactive sequence increases the potency of the Limit Break.\n\"Final Fantasy VIII\" features an experience point (EXP) system quite different from previous titles. The essentials remain unchanged: characters gain EXP after defeating enemies, which are typically encountered randomly throughout the game's environments. Earning a set amount of EXP causes the character to gain a level, which increases their overall statistics. While previous titles feature an EXP curve that increases with each level (e.g. getting to level 2 requires 200 EXP, level 3 requires 400, etc.), characters in \"Final Fantasy VIII\" gain a level after accumulating a flat rate of 1000 points. Enemy levels scale based on the party's average level; in most RPGs at the time, enemy levels remain stagnant. Some bosses have level caps to prevent the main quest from becoming too difficult. Higher-level enemies are capable of inflicting and withstanding significantly more damage, may have additional special attacks, and carry additional magic spells, allowing for Junctioning bonuses which themselves far exceed the bonuses imparted by level-gain. The game's unique EXP and level system allows a player to grind to maximum Level 100 before even beginning the plot, though this will result in far more powerful enemies.\nIn addition to gaining levels, Guardian Forces earn Ability Points (AP) after battles, which are automatically allocated to special abilities that Guardian Forces can learn. When a Guardian Force has learned an ability, that ability becomes available for any character or the character party, as is the case with field abilities. These abilities allow characters to attack more efficiently, refine magic spells from items, receive stat bonuses upon leveling up, access shops remotely, and use additional battle commands.\nPlot.\nSetting and characters.\nMost of \"Final Fantasy VIII\" is set on an unnamed fantasy world. The setting is highly European in design and features a blend of modern and futuristic locales. The planet contains five major landmasses, with Esthar, the largest, covering most of the eastern portion of the map. Galbadia, the second-largest continent, lies to the west, and contains many of the game's locations. The northernmost landmass is Trabia, an Arctic region. Positioned roughly in the middle of the world map lies Balamb, the smallest continent, the island on which the game begins. The remaining landmass is small and mostly desolate, riddled with rough, rocky terrain caused by the impact of a \"Lunar Cry\", an event where monsters from the moon fall to the planet. The southernmost landmass includes an archipelago of broken sections of land that have drifted apart. Islands and marine structures flesh out the game world, and a handful of off-world locations round out the playable areas.\nThe six main protagonists of \"Final Fantasy VIII\" are: Squall Leonhart, a loner who avoids vulnerability by focusing on his duty; Rinoa Heartilly, an outspoken and passionate young woman who follows her heart; Quistis Trepe, an instructor with a serious, patient attitude; Zell Dincht, an energetic martial artist with a fondness for hot dogs; Selphie Tilmitt, a cheerful girl who loves trains and pilots the airship \"Ragnarok\"; and Irvine Kinneas, a charismatic and promiscuous marksman. All but Rinoa and Irvine are members of \"SeeD\", an elite military force based out of futuristic installations called Gardens. Temporarily playable characters include Laguna Loire, Kiros Seagill, and Ward Zabac, who appear in \"flashback\" sequences; SeeD cadet-turned-antagonist Seifer Almasy; and sorceress Edea Kramer. The main antagonist is Ultimecia, a sorceress from the future who wishes to compress time.\nStory.\nSquall and Seifer spar with each other while training outside Balamb Garden, giving each other scars in the process. Meanwhile, the Republic of Galbadia invades the Dollet Dukedom, forcing Dollet to hire SeeD. The school uses the mission as a final exam for its cadets; with the help of his instructor, Quistis, Squall passes the mission's prerequisite and is grouped with Seifer and Zell. Selphie replaces Seifer mid-mission when the latter disobeys orders and abandons his team. SeeD halts the Galbadian advance; Squall, Zell, and Selphie graduate to SeeD status, but Seifer is disciplined for his disobedience. During the graduation party, Squall meets Rinoa, whose personality is the opposite of his. When assigned with Zell and Selphie to help Rinoa's resistance in Galbadian-occupied Timber, Squall learns that Sorceress Edea is behind Galbadia's recent hostilities. Under orders from Garden, Squall and his comrades\u2014joined by Rinoa, Quistis, and Irvine\u2014attempt to assassinate Edea. During the effort, Squall's party also learns that Seifer has left Garden to become Edea's second-in-command. Edea survives the attempt, stabs Squall in the shoulder with an ice shard, and detains the party.\nAfter Squall's party escapes the prison they were sent to, Edea destroys Trabia Garden in a retaliatory missile strike and prepares to attack Balamb Garden. Selphie delays the launch while Squall's team returns to Balamb Garden and activates its mobile functions to evade the missiles. Garden cannot be controlled, however, and it crashes into the docks at Fishermans' Horizon. While Garden is being repaired, Galbadia invades the town in search of a girl named Ellone, who had been staying at Balamb Garden. Before leaving, Ellone reveals that she has been \"sending\" Squall and his team into flashbacks set 17 years earlier in a vain effort to alter history. The scenes center on Laguna and his friends as he evolves from Galbadian soldier (where he shared a crush with Rinoa's future mother Julia) to village protector (where he served as caretaker to Ellone alongside a bartender named Raine) to leader of an Estharian resistance against Sorceress Adel. Ellone eventually escapes to Esthar, the world's technological superpower.\nMeanwhile, Squall confronts his personal anxieties fueled by ongoing developments, such as Headmaster Cid appointing him as SeeD's new leader and his increasing attraction to Rinoa. Squall and his comrades learn that they, along with Seifer and Ellone but minus Rinoa, were all raised in an orphanage run by Edea; after eventual separation, they later developed amnesia due to their use of Guardian Forces, except Irvine, who did not use them. Cid and Edea had established Garden and SeeD primarily to defeat corrupt sorceresses. After these revelations, the forces of Balamb Garden defeat the Galbadian Army, led by Seifer, aboard Galbadia Garden. Edea is also defeated by SeeD, but the party learns that Edea is merely an unwilling host for Ultimecia, who planned to use Ellone to help achieve time compression. Ultimecia transfers her powers to Rinoa; Edea survives, but Rinoa enters a coma. Squall travels to Esthar to find Ellone, as he believes that she can help save Rinoa.\nWhile Rinoa is being treated on Esthar's space station, Ultimecia uses her to free Adel from an orbital prison. Ultimecia then orders Seifer to activate the Lunatic Pandora facility, inciting a Lunar Cry that sends Adel's containment device to the planet. Having selected Adel as her next host, Ultimecia abandons Rinoa in outer space. Squall rescues her, and they return to the planet on a derelict starship and share a romantic moment; Ellone is captured by Galbadia shortly thereafter. After landing, the party encounters Laguna, now President of Esthar; he reveals Dr. Odine's plan to allow Ultimecia to cast time compression on their terms so that Ellone can send SeeD into Ultimecia's time period. At Lunatic Pandora, Squall's team defeats Seifer, rescues Ellone, and kills Adel; Ultimecia possesses Rinoa and begins casting time compression. Ellone sends Squall's team into Ultimecia's era, where she is defeated in a fierce battle before time compression can be fully achieved.\nSquall, lost in time and space, witnesses the dying Ultimecia traveling back in time to pass her powers to Edea. Rinoa finds him unconscious, and they return together to their restored world and time. Seifer is reunited with his companions, Laguna and Ellone visit Raine's grave, and the SeeD celebrate their victory at Balamb Garden. Squall and Rinoa share a kiss under the moonlight.\nDevelopment.\nDevelopment of \"Final Fantasy VIII\" began in 1997, during the English-language translation of \"Final Fantasy VII\". As with much of the production of \"VII\", series creator and veteran Hironobu Sakaguchi served as the executive producer, working primarily on the development of \"\" and leaving direction of \"Final Fantasy VIII\" to Yoshinori Kitase. Shinji Hashimoto was assigned to be the producer in Sakaguchi's place, while the game and battle system were designed by Kitase and Hiroyuki Ito, respectively. One of the development difficulties encountered was having three real-time characters exploring an environment at the same time. The card game \"Triple Triad\" was conceived and implemented by programmer Kentarow Yasui. The concept was derived from trading cards which is a popular hobby in some parts of Japan. \"Triple Triad\" was meant to keep the player's interest during long stretches without cutscenes. Originally, it was simply about collecting cards but Yasui considered this too disconnected from the main game and \"begged\" for the inclusion of an ability to transform cards into items. The game's total development costs were approximately \u00a5 or $30 million (equivalent to $\u00a0million in 2024). The staff consisted of about 180 people.\nFollowing the turbulent development of \"Final Fantasy VII\", there was a shake-up of Square's localization process. \"Final Fantasy VIII\" was the first title to have extensive communication between the Japanese and North American teams during the process. Lead translator Richard Honeywood wrote a text parser that would automatically convert text from English ASCII to Shift JIS format required by the game engine's compiler, streamlining the translation process dramatically. The game was the first major project of Alexander O. Smith, who would later earn acclaim for his work on \"Vagrant Story\". Smith said that due to a lack of communication with the development team, they were surprised that an IT employee used GameShark to access text files for localizing to Western audiences. The translation was finished by September 1999. The game's European release was delayed due to necessary graphical changes; the cited example was the removal of a Nazi-like uniform.\nVisual design.\nFrom the beginning, Kitase knew he wanted a thematic combination of fantasy and realism. To this end, he aimed to include a cast of characters who appeared to be ordinary people. Character designer and battle visual director Tetsuya Nomura and art director Yusuke Naora strove to achieve this impression through the inclusion of realistically proportioned characters, a departure from the super deformed designs used in the previous title. Additionally, Naora attempted to enhance the realism of the world through predominantly bright lighting effects with shadows distributed as appropriate. Other measures taken included implementing rental cars for travel in-game, and the use of motion capture technology to give the game's characters lifelike movements in the game's full motion video sequences. The FMV sequences were created by a team of roughly 35 people, with the total cinematic run-time being estimated at over an hour, approximately 20 minutes longer than the FMV sequences in \"VII\". Motion capture was used to give a general realism to character movement, but the team favored manual animation over relying on motion capture. A major challenge was the technical advances made since the release of \"VII\", and the aim for more realistic characters. A major issue with the cutscenes was having real-time character models moving across environments within an FMV.\nIn an interview with \"Famitsu\", Naora described that the game was generally designed to be a \"bright, fresh \"Final Fantasy\"\". The main reason was that the team had dealt extensively with dark and \"weird\" imagery with \"VII\". The designers felt a need to invert the atmosphere of previous games in the series, which had feelings of \"light emerging from darkness\". This decision was easy for the developers to make, because most of them had worked on \"Final Fantasy VII\" and felt that a new direction was acceptable. The world designs were also developed with the knowledge that most of the staff were now used to computer graphics, which was not the case with \"VII\". The developers also noted that with \"Final Fantasy VIII\", they attempted to \"mix future, real life and fantasy\". As part of a theme desired by Kitase to give the game a foreign atmosphere, various designs were given to its locations using the style of internationally familiar places, while also maintaining a fantasy atmosphere. Inspiration ranged from ancient Egyptian and Greek architecture, to the city of Paris, France, to an idealized futuristic European society. Flags were also given to some factions, their designs based on the group's history and culture.\nTo maintain a foreign atmosphere, the characters of the game were designed to have predominantly European appearances. The first \"Final Fantasy VIII\" character created was Squall. Desiring to add a unique angle to Squall's appearance and emphasize his role as the central character, Nomura gave him a scar across his brow and the bridge of his nose. As there was not yet a detailed history conceived for the character, Nomura left the explanation for Squall's scar to scenario writer Kazushige Nojima. Squall was given a gunblade, a fictional revolver\u2013sword hybrid that functions primarily as a sword, with an added damaging vibration feature activated by use of its gun mechanism, similar to a vibroblade. His character design was complemented by a fur lining along the collar of his jacket, incorporated by Nomura as a challenge for the game's full motion video designers. Additionally, some designs Nomura had previously drawn, but had not yet used in a \"Final Fantasy\" game, were incorporated into \"Final Fantasy VIII\". These were the designs of Edea, Fujin and Raijin. The latter two had originally been designed for use in \"Final Fantasy VII\", but with the inclusion of the Turks characters in that game, it was felt that Fujin and Raijin were unnecessary. Nomura had designed Edea before the development of \"VII\", based on the style of Yoshitaka Amano. For the Guardian Forces, Nomura felt they should be unique beings, without clothes or other human-like concepts. This was problematic, as he did not want them to \"become the actual monsters\", so he took great care in their design. Leviathan was the first GF, created as a test and included in a game demo. After it received a positive reaction from players, Nomura decided to create the remaining sequences in a similar fashion.\nStory development.\nThe plot of \"Final Fantasy VIII\" was conceived by Kitase, with the story and the characters provided by Nomura and the actual scenario written by Nojima. During the game's pre-production, Nomura suggested the game be given a \"school days\" feel. Nojima already had a story in mind in which the main characters were the same age; their ideas meshed, taking form as the \"Garden\" military academies. Nojima planned that the two playable parties featured in the game (Squall's present day group and Laguna's group from the past) would be highly contrasted with one another. This idea was conveyed through the age and experience of Laguna's group, versus the youth and na\u00efvet\u00e9 of Squall's group. Nojima has expressed that the dynamic of players' relationships with the protagonist is important to him. Both \"Final Fantasy VII\" and \"VIII\" feature reserved, quiet protagonists in the form of Cloud Strife and Squall. With \"VIII\", however, Nojima worked to give players actual insight into what the character was thinking, a direct contrast with his handling of \"VII\", which encouraged the player to speculate.\nOther media.\nIn March 1999, one month after the game's release, \"Final Fantasy VIII Ultimania\" was published, a book that features an in-depth guide to \"Final Fantasy VIII\" and interviews with the developers. An origami book was released in November 1999. Later on September 22, a CD-ROM titled \"Final Fantasy VIII Desktop Accessories\" was released. It contains desktop icons, computer wallpapers, screensavers, and an e-mail application. It additionally features a stand-alone edition of the \"Triple Triad\" minigame, which allowed players to compete against one another via a local area network.\nAlso in 1999, the ballroom dance scene of \"Final Fantasy VIII\" was featured as a technical demo for the PlayStation 2. In 2000, a PC version was released for Windows. This port featured smoother graphics, enhanced audio, and the inclusion of \"Chocobo World\", a minigame starring Boko, a Chocobo featured in one of the side-quests in \"Final Fantasy VIII\". For most North American and European players, the PC version of the game was the only means of playing \"Chocobo World\", as the game was originally designed to be played via the PocketStation, a handheld console never released outside Japan. \"Final Fantasy VIII\" was released on the Sony's Greatest Hits on August 28, 2000. In 2009, the title was added to the PlayStation Store on the PlayStation Network.\n\"Final Fantasy VIII\" was re-released as part of the \"Final Fantasy 25th Anniversary Ultimate Box\" Japanese package in December 2012. An upscaled PC version was released on Steam on December 5, 2013.\nMusic.\nRegular series composer Nobuo Uematsu wrote the soundtrack for \"Final Fantasy VIII\". He tried to base the songs on the emotional content of the scenes in which they would be played, asserting that expressing the emotions he desired was more important than improving skills, because \"I think it will be a shame if we won't be able to cry as we play our own game\". He could not determine a character's emotions solely based on the plot, instead using images of appearance and attire: \"It's important to know when their emotions are at their height, but it usually takes until a month before release for them to finish the ending dialog...!\" When IGN Music stated that the music of \"Final Fantasy VIII\" was very dark and perhaps influenced by the plot of the game, Uematsu said that \"the atmosphere of music varies depending on story line, of course, but it's also my intention to put various types of music into one game\". The absence of character themes found in the previous two games was due to Uematsu finding those of \"Final Fantasy VI\" and \"VII\" ineffective. Uematsu considers it reasonable to have character themes if each character has a \"highlight\" in the game, but he found \"Final Fantasy VIII\" only focused on Squall Leonhart and Rinoa Heartilly as a couple, resulting in the \"Eyes on Me\" theme.\nThe original soundtrack was released on four compact discs by DigiCube in Japan on March 10, 1999, and by Square Electronic Arts in North America as \"Final Fantasy VIII Music Collection\" in January 2000. It was republished worldwide by Square Enix on May 10, 2004. An album of orchestral arrangements of selected tracks from the game was released under the title \"Fithos Lusec Wecos Vinosec Final Fantasy VIII\" on November 19, 1999, by DigiCube, and subsequently published on July 22, 2004, by Square Enix. The pieces were arranged and conducted by Shir\u014d Hamaguchi for a live orchestra. A collection of piano arrangements performed by Shinko Ogata was released under the title \"Piano Collections: Final Fantasy VIII\" by DigiCube on January 21, 2000, and subsequently re-published by Square Enix on July 22, 2004.\nThe score is best known for two songs: \"Liberi Fatali\", a Latin choral piece that is played during the introduction to the game, and \"Eyes On Me\", a pop song serving as the game's theme, performed by Chinese singer Faye Wong. Near the end of the production of \"Final Fantasy VII\", the developers suggested to use a singer, but abandoned the idea due to a lack of reasoning based on the game's theme and storyline. However, Nobuo Uematsu thought a ballad would closely relate to the theme and characters of \"Final Fantasy VIII\". This resulted in the game's developers sharing \"countless\" artists, eventually deciding on Wong. Uematsu claims \"her voice and mood seem to match my image of the song exactly\", and that her ethnicity \"fits the international image of \"Final Fantasy\"\". After negotiations were made, \"Eyes on Me\" was recorded in Hong Kong with an orchestra. The song was released as a CD single in Japan and sold over 400,000 copies, setting the record for highest-selling video game music disc ever released in that country at the time. \"Liberi Fatali\" was played during the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens during the women's synchronized swimming event.\nThe music of \"Final Fantasy VIII\" has appeared in various official \"Final Fantasy\" concerts. These include 2002's \"20020220 Music from FINAL FANTASY\", in which the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra played \"Liberi Fatali\", \"Don't Be Afraid\", \"Love Grows\", and \"The Man with the Machine Gun\", the 2004 \"Tour de Japon\" series, which featured \"The Oath\", the \"Dear Friends\" series that began that same year and included \"Liberi Fatali\" and \"Love Grows\", and the 2005 \"More Friends\" concert, which included \"Maybe I'm a Lion\". More recent concerts include the \"Voices \u2013 Music from Final Fantasy\" 2006 concert showcasing \"Liberi Fatali\", \"Fisherman's Horizon\", and \"Eyes on Me\" and the international \"Distant Worlds\" concert tour that continues to date, which includes \"Liberi Fatali\", \"Fisherman's Horizon\", \"Man with the Machine Gun\", and \"Love Grows\". Several of these concerts have produced live albums as well. Music from the game has also been played in non \"Final Fantasy\"-specific concerts such as the \"Play! A Video Game Symphony\" world tour from 2006 onwards, for which Nobuo Uematsu composed the opening fanfare that accompanies each performance.\n\"Final Fantasy VIII Remastered\".\nA remastered version of \"Final Fantasy VIII\" was released in September 2019, and was announced officially at E3 2019. The remaster, which features high definition graphics and improved character models, was produced in collaboration with Dotemu and Access Games, and was released on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One. It was later ported to Android and iOS, and released on March 24, 2021.\nReception.\n\"Final Fantasy VIII\" received critical acclaim. In general, the game was compared favorably to its predecessors. Though questioning the game's lack of voice overs for its characters, \"Game Revolution\" praised its storyline and ending. For their part, \"Edge\" labeled \"Final Fantasy VIII\" \"a far more accomplished game than \"FFVII\"\". On the other hand, the magazine also felt that the game's length left its story unable to \"offer consistently strong dialogue and sub-plots\". Additionally, it found some of the story's plot twists \"not... suitably manipulated and prepared\", leaving it \"hard not to greet such... moments with anything but indifference\". Overall, \"Edge\" considered \"Final Fantasy VIII\" to be \"yet another outstanding edition of SquareSoft's far-from-final fantasies\", summarizing it as \"aesthetically astonishing, rarely less than compelling, and near peerless in scope and execution\". \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" offered similar comments, stating that the game's character development \"is the best of any RPGs\" and that \"\"Final Fantasy VIII\" is the pinnacle of its genre\".\nJeff Lundrigan reviewed the PlayStation version of the game for \"Next Generation\", rating it four stars out of five. Francis Hwang of \"Spin\" magazine praised the \"brilliant-looking\" cinematic visuals, stating the cutscenes rival \"even the most major of major animated pictures\" and that the \"combat scenes are filled with the same dramatic poses and dazzling, 70 mm explosions seen in such classics as \"Akira\" and \"Dragon Ball Z\"\".\nReviews of the gameplay have been mixed. \"IGN\" felt that it was the weakest aspect of the game, citing its Guardian Force attack sequences as \"incredibly cinematic\" but tedious, sentiments echoed by \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\". They also regarded the battle system as intensely complicated, yet refreshingly innovative and something that \"RPG fanatics love to obsess over\". \"Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine\" claims that the game's Junction system is a major flaw due to repetitive stocking of spells, while the video game magazine \"Edge\" commented that the battle system consists of a \"bewildering\" number of intricate options and techniques that \"most gamers will [...] relish\". \"GameSpot\" praised the game's battle system, commenting that the \"possibilities for customization [with the Junction system] are immense\".\nThe PC port received mixed reception. \"Maximum PC\" praised the full motion video sequences as \"phenomenal\", adding that while the gameplay took getting used to, they enjoyed the teamwork emphasized by it, and that the game's visual presentation added to its appeal. \"GameSpy\" stated that while the game was not a \"huge leap forward\" from the previous title, its gameplay and visual appeal worked for its benefit, though that on a computer the pre-rendered backgrounds appeared blurry and the controls at time difficult with a keyboard. \"GameSpot\" criticized the game for not taking advantage of the capabilities afforded to computers at the time, describing the PlayStation version as both looking and sounding superior, and recommending that the title was \"not worth buying period\" for the PC. \"UGO.com\" also described the port as inferior to its original counterpart, adding that its presentation was in turn detrimental to the reception the game received as a whole. \"Computer Gaming World\" praised some of the changes made to the game in light of previous titles and the inclusion of the Triple Triad sub-game, though heavily criticized the port as \"lazy\" and \"disappointing\", stating that it only served to emphasize the original game's flaws. Despite their complaints, they named it the twentieth-best game of 2000.\nAt the 3rd Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences awarded \"Final Fantasy VIII\" with \"Outstanding Achievement in Animation\", \"Outstanding Achievement in Art Direction\", and \"Console Adventure/Role-Playing Game of the Year\".\nSales.\nIt was a best-seller in Japan. It had more than 2 million pre-orders prior to release. The game set a single-day sales record, selling 2.21 million copies and grossing \u00a5 or $151\u00a0million (equivalent to $\u00a0million in 2024) in its first day of release. It sold approximately 2.57 million units in Japan within the first four days of release. Within two days of its North American release on September 7, 1999, \"Final Fantasy VIII\" became the top-selling video game in the United States, a position it held for more than three weeks. It sold more than 1 million units and grossed more than $50\u00a0million (equivalent to $\u00a0million in North America during the 13 weeks that followed, making it the fastest-selling \"Final Fantasy\" title). It was also a best-seller in the UK. In Europe, it grossed \u20ac26,549,294 or $ in 1999, adding up to more than $228 million (equivalent to $\u00a0million) grossed in Japan, North America and Europe during 1999.\nBy the end of 1999, 6.08 million units were sold worldwide, including 3.61 million in Japan, 1.35 million in North America, and 1.12 million in Europe and other territories (including Australia, mainland East Asia, and Africa). Its sales had increased to 7 million units by early 2001. By March 2003, the game had shipped 8.15 million copies worldwide, including 3.7 in Japan and 4.45 abroad. By 2009, it had sold over 8.6 million copies on the PlayStation. According to \"Steam Spy\", an estimated 703,000 digital copies of the PC version were sold on Steam by April 2018. By August 2019, worldwide sales were over 9.6 million units across all platforms.\nRetrospective.\nThe opening cut scene in \"Final Fantasy VIII\" was ranked second on \"Game Informer\"'s list of \"Top 10 Video Game Openings\", and first by \"IGN\". \"GameSpy\" listed it as the 15th-best cinematic moment in video games. \"IGN\" named the game's ending the third best of any game for the PlayStation, while \"UGO.com\" named it one of the series' best and most memorable moments. \"Final Fantasy VIII\" was voted by readers of Japanese magazine \"Famitsu\" as the 22nd-best game of all time in 2006, and named one of the 20 essential Japanese role-playing games by \"Gamasutra\", stating \"[t]here's a lot that \"Final Fantasy VIII\" does wrong, but there's even more that it does right\".\n\"UGO.com\" said that while no other game in the series had stirred the controversy that \"Final Fantasy VIII\" had and that while it was flawed, the title was a \"daring, groundbreaking game [...] decidedly the most original console-style RPG ever created\". In 2002, \"IGN\" named it the seventh-best title for the PlayStation, placing higher on the list than \"Final Fantasy VII\"; the publication felt that \"VIII\" improved on the strengths of its predecessor. Kat Bailey, writing for \"1Up.com\", noted \"Final Fantasy VIII\" as the first game in the \"Final Fantasy\" series which features a love story as the game's overarching theme, calling it a daring choice and a symbol of the video game medium's continued evolution as a form of storytelling, with numerous subsequent video games adopting romantic subplots to varying degrees of success. In 2024, Phil Salvador, library director of the Video Game History Foundation, created a new website \"ff8isthe.best\" dedicated to essays about the game.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "52758", "revid": "50170345", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52758", "title": "Final Fantasy IX", "text": "2000 video game\nborder\n is a 2000 role-playing video game developed and published by Square for the PlayStation video game console. It is the ninth game in the main \"Final Fantasy\" series. The plot focuses on a war between nations in a medieval fantasy world called Gaia. Players follow a thief named Zidane Tribal who kidnaps princess Garnet Til Alexandros XVII as part of a ploy by the neighboring nation of Lindblum. He joins Garnet and a growing cast of characters on a quest to take down her mother, Queen Brahne of Alexandria, who started the war.\nGame development occurred in parallel with \"Final Fantasy VIII\". Envisioned by developers as a retrospective for the series, it departed from the futuristic settings of \"Final Fantasy VI\", \"VII\", and \"VIII\" by returning to the medieval style of the earlier games. Consequently, it draws heavy influence from the original \"Final Fantasy\" and features allusions to the rest of the series. The game introduced new features to the series despite this approach, such as \"Active Time Event\" cutscenes, \"Mognet\", and skill systems. \"Final Fantasy IX\" was the last game in the main series whose music was composed solely by Nobuo Uematsu.\n\"Final Fantasy IX\" was released to critical acclaim and commercial success, selling 8.9 million copies by March 2025. It was re-released in 2010 as a PS1 Classic on the PlayStation Store\u2014this version was compatible with PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable; PlayStation Vita support arrived in 2012. In 2016 Square Enix released an enhanced port featuring minor gameplay and graphical enhancements, which would be released on several platforms. An animated series adaptation by Square Enix and Cyber Group Studios was announced in 2021.\nGameplay.\nIn \"Final Fantasy IX\", the player navigates a character through the game world, exploring areas and interacting with non-player characters. Most of the game occurs on \"field screens\" consisting of pre-rendered backgrounds representing towns and dungeons. To aid exploration on the field screen, \"Final Fantasy IX\" introduces the \"field icon\", an exclamation mark appearing over the lead character's head, indicating a point of interest. Players speak with Moogles to record their progress, recover their energy, and purchase items. An extensive optional quest involves sending and receiving letters from Moogles and other non-playable characters via Mognet, an in-game postal service.\nPlayers journey between field screen locations on the world map, a three-dimensional representation of \"Final Fantasy IX\"'s world presented from a top-down perspective. Players can freely navigate around the world map unless restricted by obstacles such as bodies of water or mountain ranges. To traverse these impediments, players can ride chocobos, sail on a boat, or pilot airships. Like previous \"Final Fantasy\" games, players enter battles caused by random encounters with enemies while traveling across the world map or hostile field screens. \"Final Fantasy IX\" offers a new approach to town exploration with Active Time Events (ATE). These allow the player to view events unfolding at different locations, providing character development, unique items, and prompts for story-altering decisions. ATEs are occasionally used to simultaneously control two teams when the party divides to solve puzzles and navigate mazes.\nCombat and character progression.\nWhen the player encounters an enemy, the map changes to a battle screen. The player issues commands to characters from an on-screen menu on the battle screen, including physically attacking, using items from the inventory, and unique character-specific abilities that define their role in battle. For example, the thief Zidane can steal items, Eiko and Garnet can summon \"eidolons\" to aid the party, and Vivi can use black magic to damage the opposition. The speed and order in which the characters and enemies take their turn varies according to their agility, an implementation of the Active Time Battle system first featured in \"Final Fantasy IV\". Character-specific commands change when the character goes into \"Trance mode\", which is activated for a short duration when the character sustains a specified amount of damage similar to the Limit Breaks in \"Final Fantasy VII\". Trance mode amplifies the character's strength and allows the player to select more powerful attack commands. For example, Vivi's \"Black Magic\" command changes into \"Double Black\", allowing him to cast two magic spells at once. Winning battles awards money, items, \"experience points\", and \"ability points\".\nExperience points determine a character's combat attributes like agility, strength, and magical power. Accumulating sufficient experience points results in a \"level up\", which permanently increases combat attributes. Equipment worn by a character may also amplify their attributes. Certain weapons and armor also bestow special abilities, which the character may use when equipped. When the character earns enough ability points, it becomes usable without the item equipped. There are two types of abilities: action and support. Action abilities require magic points to use and include magical spells and special moves used in battle. Support abilities provide functions that are automatically enabled in battle, such as increasing power against certain types of enemies. The maximum number of effects characters can equip at once is determined by each character's Magic Stones.\nPlot.\nSetting and characters.\n\"Final Fantasy IX\" takes place primarily in a world named Gaia. Most of Gaia's population lives on the Mist Continent, named after the thick Mist that blankets the lowlands. Large mountain ranges act as natural borders that separate its four nations: Alexandria, Lindblum, Burmecia, and Cleyra. Alexandria is a warmongering monarchy that controls the eastern half of the continent. One of its cities is Treno, a cultural nexus under perpetual starlight that is home to many aristocrats and paupers alike. The technologically advanced Lindblum, a hub of airship travel, is nestled on a plateau to the southwest. Both countries feature a mix of humans, humanoids, and anthropomorphic animals. Burmecia, a kingdom showered by endless rain, is in the northwest. Cleyra, a neighboring settlement that seceded from Burmecia due to its appreciation for war, is situated in a giant tree in the desert, protected by a sandstorm. Both are inhabited by anthropomorphic rats with a fondness for dance and spear fighting.\nPlayers eventually explore the Outer, Lost, and Forgotten Continents as well. Civilizations on the Outer Continent include Conde Petie, home of the dwarves; Black Mage Village, a secret settlement of sentient magician drones; and Madain Sari, once home to a near-extinct race of horned humanoid summoners who conjure powerful magical beings called eidolons. Also on the Outer Continent is the Iifa Tree, which disperses the Mist to other continents through its roots. This Mist stimulates the fighting instinct in humanoids and contributes to Gaia's bloody history. The Lost and Forgotten continents are littered mostly with ancient ruins. Scattered throughout the marshes of Gaia are the Qu: large, frog-eating, and seemingly androgynous humanoids who are considered great gourmands. Late in the game, players briefly travel to the parallel world of Terra and the dream realm of Memoria.\nThe main playable characters are: Zidane Tribal, a member of a group of bandits called Tantalus who are masquerading as a theater troupe; Garnet Til Alexandros XVII (alias Dagger), the Princess of Alexandria who runs away with Zidane; Vivi Ornitier, a young, timid, and kind black mage with an unknown origin; Adelbert Steiner, a brash Alexandrian knight captain and loyal servant of Princess Garnet; Freya Crescent, a Burmecian dragoon searching for her lost love; Quina Quen, a Qu whose master wants them to travel the world so that they will learn about cuisine; Eiko Carol, a young girl living in Madain Sari who is one of the last summoners; and Amarant Coral, a bounty hunter hired to return Garnet to Alexandria. Other important characters include Cid Fabool, the charismatic Regent of Lindblum; Brahne, Garnet's adoptive mother and the power-hungry Queen of Alexandria; Beatrix, the general of Alexandria's all-female army; Garland, an elderly Terran male tasked with saving his world; and antagonist Kuja, an arms dealer and pawn of Garland who questions his own existence.\nStory.\nIn Alexandria, Zidane and Tantalus kidnap Princess Garnet by order of Cid. Garnet does not resist, for she was already planning to flee and warn Cid of Queen Brahne's increasingly erratic behavior. Vivi and Steiner join the party during the escape. En route to Lindblum, the group discovers that Brahne is manufacturing soulless black mage soldiers that look similar to Vivi. In Lindblum, Cid confirms that he hired the group to protect Garnet from Brahne's newfound aggression. After learning that Alexandria has invaded Burmecia with the black mages, Zidane and Vivi join Freya to investigate. Garnet and Steiner secretly return to Alexandria to reason with Brahne.\nZidane's team finds that the Alexandrian forces, headed by Beatrix, conquered Burmecia with help from Kuja and the refugees have fled to Cleyra. Brahne imprisons Garnet, extracts her eidolons, and uses the eidolon, Odin to destroy Cleyra while Zidane's group defends the city. The party escapes on Brahne's airship, rendezvous with Steiner, and rescues Garnet. Meanwhile, Brahne cripples Lindblum with another eidolon, Atomos. Cid explains that Kuja supplies Brahne with black mages and the knowledge to use eidolons. The party befriends Quina and tracks Kuja to the Outer Continent. Brahne hires bounty hunters Lani and Amarant to capture Garnet. On the Outer Continent, the party defeats Lani and meets Eiko, a summoner who lives with a group of moogles in the village of Madain Sari. Eiko leads Zidane and the others to the Iifa Tree. Inside, they learn that Kuja uses Mist to create the black mages and that Vivi was a prototype. The party defeats the monster that generates the Mist within the Tree, which clears it from the Mist Continent. While waiting for Kuja's reprisal at Madain Sari, Lani and Amarant attempt to kidnap Eiko but Zidane and the moogles foil them. Amarant then challenges Zidane to a duel and loses. He joins the party and Garnet learns of her heritage as a summoner who was adopted by Brahne as a child. At the Tree, Brahne attempts to kill Kuja with an eidolon so she can rule unopposed, but he takes control of it and destroys her and her army.\nAfter Garnet's coronation, Kuja attacks Alexandria Castle. Garnet and Eiko summon an extremely powerful eidolon in defense; Kuja attempts to steal the eidolon as a means to kill his master, Garland, but the latter arrives and destroys it. The party chases Kuja through a portal to Terra, where the antagonists' goals become clear. The Terrans created Garland to merge their dying world with Gaia; Garland, in turn, created self-aware, soulless vessels called Genomes. For millennia, Garland has been using the Iifa Tree to replace deceased Gaian souls with the hibernating Terran souls, turning the former into Mist in the process; this will allow the Terrans to be reborn into the Genomes after the planetary merge. Kuja and Zidane are Genomes created to accelerate this process by bringing war and chaos to Gaia. Kuja had betrayed Garland to avoid becoming occupied by a Terran soul. Kuja defeats Garland, who reveals before dying that the former has a limited lifespan anyhow: Garland designed Zidane to be his replacement. Enraged, Kuja destroys Terra and escapes to the Iifa Tree.\nAt the Iifa Tree, the party enters Memoria and reaches the origin of the universe: the Crystal World. They defeat Kuja, preventing him from destroying the original crystal of life and thus the universe. After defeating Necron, a force of death, the Tree collapses; the party flees, while Zidane stays behind to rescue Kuja. One year later, the game reveals the cast's fate: Tantalus arrives in Alexandria to put on a show; Vivi has implicitly died as Black Mages only live for a year, but he has left behind several identical \"sons,\" as well as grown to understand the meaning of life; Freya and Fratley are rebuilding Burmecia; Cid has adopted Eiko; Quina works in the castle's kitchen; Amarant and Lani are travelling together; and Garnet presides as queen of Alexandria, with Steiner and Beatrix as her guards. In the climax of Tantalus's performance, the lead actor reveals himself as Zidane in disguise and reunites with Queen Garnet.\nDevelopment.\nEarly planning for \"Final Fantasy IX\" began in July 1998 before Square had finished development on \"Final Fantasy VIII\". The game was developed in Hawaii as a compromise to developers living in the United States. As the series' last game on the PlayStation, Sakaguchi envisioned a \"reflection\" on the older games of the series. Leading up to its release, Sakaguchi called \"Final Fantasy IX\" his favorite \"Final Fantasy\" game as \"it's closest to [his] ideal view of what \"Final Fantasy\" should be\". This shift was also a response to demands from fans and other developers. Additionally, the team wanted to create a coherent story with deep character development; this led to the creation of Active Time Events which showcase the character's individual exploration away from the protagonist. Sakaguchi wrote the scenario for the game, with further contributions from Kazuhiko Aoki and Nobuaki Komoto.\nIn the game's conceptual stage, the developers made it clear that the title would not necessarily be \"Final Fantasy IX\", as its break from the realism of \"VII\" and \"VIII\" may have alienated audiences. This idea led fans to speculate that it would be a \"gaiden\" (side story) to the main series. By late 1999, however, Square had confirmed that the game would indeed be titled \"Final Fantasy IX\", and by early 2000, they had almost finished the game. The developers made several adjustments to the game, such as changing the ending seven times. Director Hiroyuki Ito had designed the battle system.\nThe game's developers sought to make the game's environment more \"fantasy-oriented\" than its PlayStation predecessors by reintroducing a medieval setting. In the game world, steam technology is just beginning to become widely available. The population relies on hydropower or wind power for energy sources but sometimes harness Mist or steam to drive more advanced engines. Norse and Northern European mythology also inspired the game's setting. According to Ito, \"[the development team is] attracted to European history and mythology because of its depth and its drama\". The game's art director was Hideo Minaba, while the characters were designed by Sh\u016bk\u014d Murase and Toshiyuki Itahana. Recurring artist Yoshitaka Amano created promotional concept art of the characters and world, and designed the logo. The main \"Final Fantasy IX\" website says the development of the game's world serves as a culmination of the series by blending the \"successful elements of the past, such as a return to the fantasy roots\", with newer elements. To accomplish this and satisfy fans who had become used to the realistic designs of \"Final Fantasy VIII\", the designers stressed creating characters with whom the player could easily relate. The characters had \"comic-like looks\" as a result. In addition, \"The Dark Crystal\" was used as inspiration for the design of the world and characters. Ito suggested that the protagonist Zidane should be flirtatious towards women.\nMusic.\nRegular series composer Nobuo Uematsu wrote the music of \"Final Fantasy IX\". In early discussions about the game, Ito asked him to compose themes for the eight main characters along with \"an exciting battle track, a gloomy, danger-evoking piece, and around ten other tracks\". Uematsu spent a year composing and producing \"around 160\" pieces, with 140 appearing in the game. During writing sessions, Square gave him a travel break in Europe for inspiration, where he spent time admiring ancient architecture in places like Germany. Uematsu cited medieval music as a significant influence on the score of \"IX\". He aimed for a \"simple\" and \"warm\" atmosphere and incorporated uncommon instruments like the kazoo and dulcimer. Unlike the stark realism of its predecessors, the high fantasy undertones of \"IX\" allowed for a broader spectrum of musical styles and moods. Uematsu composed with a piano and used two contrasting methods: \"I create music that fits the events in the game, but sometimes, the [developers] will adjust a game event to fit the music I've already written\".\nUematsu incorporated several motifs from older \"Final Fantasy\" games into the score, such as the original battle music intro, a reworked \"Volcano Theme\" from \"Final Fantasy\" and the Pandemonium theme in \"Final Fantasy II\". Tantalus' band plays \"Rufus' Welcoming Ceremony\" from \"Final Fantasy VII\" near the beginning of the game. Uematsu has stated on several occasions that \"Final Fantasy IX\" is his favorite score. \"Melodies of Life\" is the theme song of \"IX\" and shares its main melody with pieces frequently used in the game itself, such as the overworld theme and a lullaby that Garnet sings. Emiko Shiratori performed this piece in both the Japanese and English versions with arrangement by Shir\u014d Hamaguchi.\nRelease.\n\"Final Fantasy IX\"'s release was delayed to avoid a simultaneous release with then-rival Enix's \"Dragon Quest VII\". On October 7, 2000, a demo day for the North American version of \"IX\" was held at the Metreon in San Francisco, California. The first American release of the game was also at the Metreon; limited-edition merchandise was included with the game and fans cosplayed as \"Final Fantasy\" characters in celebration of the release. In Canada, a production error left copies of \"Final Fantasy IX\" without an English version of the instruction manual, prompting Square to ship copies of the English manual to Canadian stores several days later. Square heavily promoted the game both before and after its release. Starting on March 6, 2000, the game's characters appeared in a line of computer-generated Coca-Cola commercials. Figurines of several characters were also used as prizes in Coca-Cola's marketing campaign. That same year, \"IGN\" awarded \"Final Fantasy\" dolls and figurines for prizes in several of their contests.\n\"Final Fantasy IX\" was released on Sony's Greatest Hits on June 30, 2003.\n\"Final Fantasy IX\" was also the benchmark of Square's interactive PlayOnline service. PlayOnline was initially developed to interface with \"Final Fantasy X\" but became a strategy site for \"IX\" when those plans fell through. Square designed the website to complement BradyGames' and Piggyback Interactive's official strategy guides for the game, where players who bought the print guide had access to \"keywords\" that they could search for on PlayOnline's site for extra tips and information. This design caused anger among buyers of the guide who felt cheated by the expensive print version's omissions. The blunder made \"GameSpy\"'s \"Top 5 Dumbest Moments in Gaming\" list, and Square dropped the idea for \"Final Fantasy X\", which was under development at the time.\nSquare Enix re-released the game as part of the \"Final Fantasy 25th Anniversary Ultimate Box\" Japanese package in December 2012. A remastered version was released for Android and iOS in February 2016.&lt;ref name=\"iOS/Android\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The remaster features HD movies and character models, an auto-save feature, seven different game boosters (cheats), including high speed and no encounter modes, and achievements. A port for Windows was released on April 14 the same year. In September 2017, the Windows port was released on PlayStation 4. It was also released on the Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, and Windows 10 in North America on February 13, 2019, and in other regions a day later.\nReception.\n\"Final Fantasy IX\" sold over 2.65 million copies in Japan by the end of 2000, making it the second-highest selling game of the year in the region. Although it was a top-seller in Japan and America, \"Final Fantasy IX\" did not sell as many copies as \"VII\" or \"VIII\" in either Japan or the United States. In 2001, the game received a \"Gold\" certification from the Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland (VUD), for sales of at least 100,000 units across Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. The original PlayStation version sold over 5.5 million copies by March 2016. Across all releases, the game was announced to have sold 8.9 million copies by March 2025.\n\"Final Fantasy IX\" received universal acclaim both in Japan and abroad. It achieved a 94/100 on the review aggregator Metacritic making it their highest-scoring \"Final Fantasy\" game. The game was voted the 24th-best game of all time by readers of the Japanese magazine \"Famitsu\" in 2006. Francesca Reyes of \"Next Generation\" called it \"an imaginative return to the roots of the \"Final Fantasy\" series that hits the RPG mark dead-on\".\nCritics generally praised the title's gameplay and combat system. \"GameSpot\" approved of the simple learning curve and that the ability system is not as complex as in \"VII\" or \"VIII\". Each character possesses unique abilities, which prevents one character from overpowering the others. \"GameSpot\" describes the battle system as having a tactical nature and notes that the expanded party allows for more interaction between players and between enemies. Nevertheless, \"IGN\" disliked the lengthy combat pace and the repeated battles, describing it as \"aggravating\". \"RPGFan\" felt the Trance system was ineffective because the meter buildup is slow and unpredictable, with characters Trancing just before the enemy dies.\nThe characters and graphics also received positive reviews. Although \"IGN\" felt that the characters were similar to those in other \"Final Fantasy\" games, the characters were still engaging and sympathetic. \"GameSpot\" found the characters amusing and full of humor. \"IGN\" also noted that even the Active Time Event system helps expand the player's understanding of the characters' personalities as they grapple with many ideas and emotions. \"RPGFan\" enjoyed the detailed animation and design of the semi-deformed graphical style. They also praised the pre-rendered backgrounds, noting the careful attention given to the artwork, movement in animations, and character interactivity. They commended the cutscenes for being emotionally compelling and highlighted the seamless transition between cutscenes and in-game graphics. The music also received praise, with \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" listing it the best soundtrack on their list of top five original soundtracks, while \"GamePro\" praised the audio for evoking \"emotions throughout the story, from battles to heartbreak to comedy\".\nCritics acknowledged that Square primarily built the storyline upon elements found in previous \"Final Fantasy\" installments, such as evil empires and enigmatic villains. The main villain, although considered by \"GameSpot\" to be the least threatening in the series, was seen by \"IGN\" as an impeccable combination of \"Kefka's cackling villainy\" and \"plenty of the bishonenosity that made Sephiroth such a hit with the ladies\". \"RPGFan\" felt that the music was \"uninspired and dull\" compared to previous \"Final Fantasy\" titles and criticized composer Uematsu for reusing some tracks from past iterations of the series. Still, reviewers have concluded that this and many other elements are part of the overall effort to create a nostalgic game for fans of the older \"Final Fantasy\" games.\nThe strategy guide also received criticism; it urged buyers to log onto an online site to gain the information instead of providing it within the actual guide. The book's given links are no longer accessible on the PlayOnline website. The minigame \"Tetra Master\" was seen by \"GameSpot\" as inferior and confusing compared to \"Final Fantasy VIII\"'s minigame \"Triple Triad\" as the rules are vaguely explained and offered few rewards despite its expansive nature.\nDuring the 4th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences honored \"Final Fantasy IX\" with the \"Console Role-Playing\", \"Art Direction\" and \"Animation\" awards, as well as received nominations for \"Game of the Year\", \"Console Game of the Year\", \"Original Musical Composition\", and \"Character or Story Development\".\nLegacy.\n\"Final Fantasy IX\" was voted the 4th best \"Final Fantasy\" game in a poll by Japan's national broadcasting organization NHK. \"IGN\" named it the 14th best game on the original PlayStation, calling it an \"incredible\" way to close out the \"Final Fantasy\" series's first nine games and complimented its reverence for those titles. \"Rock Paper Shotgun\" named the title their 4th best \"Final Fantasy\" game available on PC, praising the cast and its eclectic group of heroes. Though overshadowed during its initial release by other \"Final Fantasy\" titles, the game has been recognized for its mature themes, including mortality and handling death and is considered a JRPG masterpiece. The music has also been called one of Uematsu's greatest scores. The game has inspired a number of mods such as \"Moguri Mod\", which is an unofficial remaster project developed by fans which saw its initial release in 2018.\nIn 2015, OverClocked ReMix released a four-disc collection called \"Worlds Apart\" with 120 songs to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the game's release. In June 2021, Cyber Group Studios and Square Enix announced plans to develop an animated television series based on \"Final Fantasy IX\". The status of it is currently unknown due to Cyber Group Studios' bankruptcy in 2025.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nStory notes\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "52759", "revid": "50958936", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52759", "title": "Final Fantasy X", "text": "2001 video game\n is a 2001 role-playing video game developed and published by Square for PlayStation 2. The tenth main installment in the \"Final Fantasy\" series, it is the first game in the series to feature fully three-dimensional areas (though some areas were still pre-rendered), and voice acting. \"Final Fantasy X\" replaces the Active Time Battle (ATB) system with the \"Conditional Turn-Based Battle\" (CTB) system, and uses a new leveling system called the \"Sphere Grid\".\nSet in the fantasy world of Spira, a setting influenced by the South Pacific, Thailand and Japan, the city of Samarkand in Uzbekistan has been cited as an inspiration for Zanarkand. the game's story revolves around a group of adventurers and their quest to defeat a rampaging monster known as Sin. The player character is Tidus, a star athlete in the fictional sport of blitzball, who finds himself in Spira after Sin destroyed his home city of Zanarkand.\nDevelopment of \"Final Fantasy X\" began in 1999, with a budget of more than $ ($ in 2024 dollars) and a team of more than 100 people. The game was the first in the main series not entirely scored by Nobuo Uematsu; Masashi Hamauzu and Junya Nakano were signed as Uematsu's fellow composers. \"Final Fantasy X\" was both a critical and commercial success, shipping over 8.5 million units worldwide on PlayStation 2. It has been cited as one of the greatest video games of all time. It was followed by \"Final Fantasy X-2\" in March 2003, making it the first \"Final Fantasy\" game to have a direct game sequel. As of September 2021, the \"Final Fantasy X\" series had sold over 20.8 million units worldwide, and at the end of March 2022 had surpassed 21.1 million. A remaster, \"Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster\" was released for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita in 2013, for PlayStation 4 in 2015, Windows in 2016, and for Nintendo Switch and Xbox One in 2019.\nGameplay.\nLike previous games in the series, \"Final Fantasy X\" is presented in a third-person perspective, with players directly navigating the main character, Tidus, around the world to interact with objects and people. Unlike previous games, however, the world and town maps have been fully integrated, with terrain outside of cities rendered to scale. As Tidus explores the world, he randomly encounters enemies. When an enemy is encountered, the environment switches to a turn-based battle area where characters and enemies await their turn to attack.\nThe gameplay of \"Final Fantasy X\" differs from that of previous \"Final Fantasy\" games in its lack of a top-down perspective world map. Earlier games featured a miniature representation of the expansive areas between towns and other distinct locations, used for long-distance traveling. In the game, almost all the locations are essentially continuous and never fade out to a world map. Regional connections are mostly linear, forming a single path through the game's locations, though an airship becomes available late in the game, giving the player the ability to navigate Spira faster. Like previous games in the series, \"Final Fantasy X\" features numerous minigames, including the underwater sport blitzball.\nCombat.\n\"Final Fantasy X\" introduces the Conditional Turn-Based Battle (CTB) system in place of the series' traditional Active Time Battle (ATB) system first used in \"Final Fantasy IV\". Whereas the ATB concept features real-time elements, the CTB system is a turn-based format that pauses the battle during each of the player's turns. Thus, the CTB design allows the player to select an action without time pressure. A graphical timeline along the upper-right side of the screen details who will be receiving turns next, and how various actions taken will affect the subsequent order of turns. The ordering of turns can be affected by a number of spells, items, and abilities that inflict status effects upon the controlled characters or the enemies. The player can control up to three characters in battle, though a swapping system allows the player to replace them with a character outside the active party at any time. \"Limit Breaks\", highly damaging special attacks, reappear in \"Final Fantasy X\" as \"Overdrives\". In this incarnation of the feature, most of the techniques are interactive, requiring button inputs to increase their effectiveness. While initially the Overdrives can be used when the character receives a significant amount of damage, the player is able to modify the requirements to unlock them.\n\"Final Fantasy X\" overhauled the summoning system employed in previous games of the series. Whereas in previous titles a summoned creature would arrive, perform one action, and then depart, the \"Aeons\" in \"X\" arrive and replace the battle party, fighting in their place until either the aeon wins the battle, is defeated itself, or is dismissed by the player. Aeons have their own statistics, commands, special attacks, spells, and Overdrives. The player acquires five aeons over the course of the game through the completion of Cloister of Trials puzzles; three additional aeons can be obtained by completing various side-quests.\nSphere Grid.\nAs with previous titles in the series, players can develop and improve their characters by defeating enemies and acquiring items, though the traditional experience point system is replaced by a new system called the \"Sphere Grid\". Instead of characters gaining pre-determined statistic bonuses for their attributes after leveling up, each character gains \"Sphere Levels\" after collecting enough Ability Points (AP). Sphere Levels allow players to move around the Sphere Grid, a pre-determined grid of interconnected nodes consisting of various statistic and ability bonuses. \"Spheres\" are applied to these nodes, unlocking its function for the selected character.\nThe Sphere Grid system allows players to fully customize characters in contrast to their intended battle roles, such as turning the White Mage-roled Yuna into a physical powerhouse and the swordsman Auron into a healer. The \"International\" and PAL versions of the game include an optional \"Expert\" version of the Sphere Grid; in these versions, all of the characters start in the middle of the grid and may follow whichever path the player chooses. As a trade-off, the Expert grid has fewer nodes in total, thus decreasing the total statistic upgrades available during the game.\nBlitzball.\nBlitzball is a minigame that requires strategy and tactics. The underwater sport is played in a large, hovering sphere of water surrounded by a larger audience of onlookers. The player controls one character at a time as they swim through the sphere performing passes, tackles, and attempts to score. The gameplay is similar to that of the main game in the way that the controlled character moves through the area until they encounter an enemy. In this case, the enemy is a member of the opposing team. Status effects are also implemented in the minigame as each player can learn techniques that are equivalent to abilities in the main game.\nBlitzball is introduced in the beginning of the game during one of the early cinematic sequences in which Tidus, the main character who is described as a star blitzball player, is part of an intense game. It is the only minigame that plays a role in the overall plot line as it is a main part of Tidus's character, and is in the first scene where the game's main antagonist, Sin is shown. Unlike with the other minigames, playing blitzball is mandatory near the beginning of the game, but it is later optional.\nPlot.\nSetting and characters.\n\"Final Fantasy X\" is set in the fictional world of Spira, consisting of one large landmass divided into three subcontinents, surrounded by small tropical islands. It features diverse climates, ranging from the tropical Besaid and Kilika islands, to the temperate Mi'ihen region, to the frigid Macalania and Mt. Gagazet areas. Spira is very different from the mainly European-style worlds found in previous \"Final Fantasy\" games, being much more closely modeled on Southeast Asia, most notably with respect to vegetation, topography, architecture, and names.\nSpira features a variety of races, though predominantly populated by humans. Among them are the Al Bhed, a technologically advanced but disenfranchised sub-group of humans with distinctive green eyes and unique language. The Guado are less human in appearance, with elongated fingers and other arboreal features. Still less human are the lion-like Ronso and the frog-like Hypello. A subset of Spira's sentient races are the \"unsent\", the strong-willed spirits of the dead that remain in corporeal form. In Spira, the dead who are not sent to the Farplane by a summoner come to envy the living and transform into \"fiends\", the monsters that are encountered throughout the game; however, unsent with strong attachments to the world of the living may retain their human form. Other fauna in Spira, aside from those drawn from real animals, such as cats, dogs, birds, and butterflies, include the gigantic, amphibious shoopufs (which are similar to elephants); and the emu-like chocobo, which appears in most \"Final Fantasy\" games.\nThere are seven main playable characters in \"Final Fantasy X\", starting with Tidus (James Arnold Taylor/Masakazu Morita), a cheerful young teenager and a star blitzball player from Zanarkand, who seeks a way home after an encounter with Sin transported him to Spira. To do so, he joins Yuna (Hedy Burress/Mayuko Aoki), a summoner on a journey to obtain the Final Aeon and defeat the enormous whale-like \"Sin\". Journeying with them are: Kimahri Ronso (John DiMaggio/Katsumi Ch\u014d), a young warrior of the Ronso tribe who watched over Yuna during her childhood; Wakka (DiMaggio/Kazuya Nakai), a blitzball player whose younger brother was killed by Sin; and Lulu (Paula Tiso/Rio Natsuki), a stoic black mage close to Yuna and Wakka. During the journey, they are joined by Auron (Matt McKenzie/Hideo Ishikawa), a former warrior monk, who worked with both Tidus' and Yuna's fathers to defeat Sin 10 years prior; and Rikku (Tara Strong/Marika Matsumoto), Yuna's cousin, a perky Al Bhed girl and the first friendly person Tidus meets upon arriving in Spira.\nStory.\nTidus waits with his allies outside the ruins of an ancient city. He narrates the events that led to the present, spanning most of the game's storyline. It begins in his home city, the high-tech metropolis of Zanarkand, where he is a renowned blitzball player and son of the famous blitzball star Jecht, an abusive father who disappeared 10 years prior. During a blitzball tournament, the city is attacked by an immense creature that Auron, a man not originally from Zanarkand, calls \"Sin\". Sin destroys Zanarkand and takes Tidus and Auron to the world of Spira. Upon arriving in Spira, Tidus is rescued by Al Bhed salvagers, with the young Rikku explaining that Sin destroyed Zanarkand 1,000 years ago. After Sin attacks again, Tidus is separated from the divers and drifts to the tropical island of Besaid, where he meets Wakka, captain of the local blitzball team. Wakka introduces Tidus to Yuna, a young summoner about to go on a pilgrimage to obtain the Final Aeon and defeat Sin with her guardians Lulu, a mage of black magic, and Kimahri, a member of the Ronso tribe. The party travels across Spira to gather aeons, defending against attacks by Sin and its \"offspring\" called Sinspawn. Tidus meets Auron again, who convinces Tidus to become Yuna's guardian upon revealing that Jecht is Sin's true identity. Ten years ago, Auron and Jecht bodyguarded Yuna's late father Braska to defeat Sin but Jecht became a new Sin. As Yuna's party continues their pilgrimage, Tidus reunites with Rikku, who the party learns is Yuna's cousin.\nWhen the party arrives in the city of Guadosalam, the leader of the Guado and major clergy member Seymour Guado, proposes to Yuna, saying that it will ease Spira's sorrow. At Macalania Temple, the group discovers a message from the spirit of Seymour's father, Lord Jyscal; he declares that he was killed by his own son, who now aims to destroy Spira. The group reunites with Yuna and kills Seymour in battle; soon afterward, Sin attacks, separating Yuna and sending the others to the arid Bikanel Island. While searching for Yuna at the island's Al Bhed settlement, Tidus has an emotional breakdown when he learns that summoners die after summoning the Final Aeon, leading to his desire to find a way to defeat Sin while keeping Yuna alive. The group finds Yuna in Bevelle, the center of the clergy's power, where she is being forced to marry the unsent Seymour. They crash the wedding, after which Seymour reveals his plan to become Sin with Yuna's help. The party defeats him a second time and escapes with Yuna. The group heads toward the ruins of Zanarkand, seen in the introduction of the game.\nShortly before arriving, Tidus learns that he, Jecht, and the Zanarkand they hail from are summoned entities akin to aeons based on the original Zanarkand and its people. Long ago, the original Zanarkand battled Bevelle in a machina war, in which the former was defeated. Zanarkand's survivors became \"fayth\" so that they could use their memories of Zanarkand to create a new city in their image, removed from the reality of Spira. Once they reach Zanarkand, Yunalesca\u2014the first summoner to defeat Sin and unsent ever since\u2014tells the group that the Final Aeon is created from the fayth of one close to the summoner. After defeating Sin, the Final Aeon kills the summoner and transforms into a new Sin, which has caused its cycle of rebirth to continue. The group decides against using the Final Aeon, due to the futile sacrifices it carries and the fact that Sin would still be reborn. Yunalesca tries to kill Tidus' group, but she is defeated and vanishes, ending hope of ever attaining the Final Aeon.\nAfter the fight, the group learns that Yu Yevon \u2014 the deity of the Yevon religion who was a summoner from Zanarkand before losing his humanity and mind \u2014 is behind Sin's cycle of rebirth. This leads the group to infiltrate Sin's body to find Yu Yevon. Inside Sin, the party finds the unsent Seymour, who was absorbed by Sin and intends to control it from within. Yuna defeats him for the final time before sending him to the Farplane. Shortly after, the group reaches the core of Sin and finds Jecht's imprisoned spirit. Tidus and Jecht come to terms with the latter's abuse. Jecht transforms into his Final Aeon form, asking the party to defeat him and end the cycle; they do so. With Sin's host defeated, Yuna summons and the group defeats each aeon after Yu Yevon possesses each one until they vanquish Yu Yevon himself.\nSin's cycle of rebirth ends when Yuna sends Sin and the Aeons to the farplane, and the spirits of Spira's fayth are freed from their imprisonment. Auron, who had been revealed to be unsent, is sent to the Farplane. Dream Zanarkand and Tidus disappear, now that the freed fayth stopped the summoning. Afterward, in a speech to the citizens of Spira, Yuna resolves to help rebuild their world now that it is free of Sin and gives a speech remembering all those that have been lost. In a post-credits scene, Tidus awakens underwater and swims towards the ocean surface reaching towards the light.\nDevelopment.\n\"Final Fantasy X\"'s development began in 1999, costing approximately \u00a54 billion (approximately $, or $ in 2024 dollars) with a crew of over 100 people, most of whom worked on previous games in the series. Executive producer Hironobu Sakaguchi has stated that although he had concerns about the transition from 2D to 3D backgrounds, the voice acting, and the transition to real-time story-telling, the success of the \"Final Fantasy\" series can be attributed to constantly challenging the development team to try new things. Producer Yoshinori Kitase was also the chief director of \"Final Fantasy X\", while the direction of events, maps and battles was split up between Motomu Toriyama, Takayoshi Nakazato and Toshiro Tsuchida, respectively. The development of the script for the game took three to four months, with the same amount of time dedicated to the voice recording afterwards. Tetsuya Nomura and Kazushige Nojima collaborated with Daisuke Watanabe, Toriyama and Kitase on writing the scenario for \"Final Fantasy X\". Nojima was particularly concerned with establishing a connection in the relationship between player and main character. Thus, he penned the story such that the player's progress through the world and growing knowledge about it is reflected in Tidus' own understanding and narration.\nAccording to the Square Enix companion book \"Final Fantasy Ultimania Archive Volume III\", \"17 SEVEN TEEN\" was a temporary title early in \"Final Fantasy X\"'s production. \"17 SEVEN TEEN\"'s story differed from the final version: the protagonist, who looked similar to Tidus, traveled the world seeking a cure for a pandemic that killed people when they reached the age of seventeen. This inevitable death motif was later carried over to Yuna's fate as a summoner.\nInfluences.\nCharacter designer Tetsuya Nomura identified the South Pacific, Thailand and Japan as major influences on the cultural and geographic design of Spira, particularly concerning the geographic location of the southern Besaid and Kilika islands. He has also said that Spira deviates from the worlds of past \"Final Fantasy\" games in the level of detail incorporated, something he has expressed to have made a conscious effort to maintain during the design process. Kitase felt that if the setting went back to a medieval European fantasy, it would not seem to help the development team advance. While he was thinking of different world environments, Nojima suggested a fantasy world that incorporated Asian elements.\nSub-character chief designer Fumi Nakashima's focus was to ensure that characters from different regions and cultures bore distinctive characteristics in their clothing styles, so that they could be quickly and easily identified as members of their respective sub-groups. For example, she has said that the masks and goggles of the Al Bhed give the group a \"strange and eccentric\" appearance, while the attire of the Ronso lend to them being able to easily engage in battle. Tidus was originally envisioned to be a plumber as to connect to the underwater elements used in the game, according to Nojima, but they later made him into a blitzball athlete, helping to distinguish his character from prior \"Final Fantasy\" protagonists; Tidus' final outfit still incorporated elements of the original plumber outfit they had designed for him.\nTidus' relationship with his father Jecht was based on \"stories throughout the ages, such as the ancient Greek legends\". This would eventually reveal the key of Sin's weakness and eventual defeat. Auron was intended to be silent throughout the game but became a voiced character as they developed out the Guardian storyline between Tidus and Yuna. Although \"Final Fantasy X\" was originally centered on the relationship between Tidus and Yuna, the addition of Jecht's character and his feud with his son was added later in the making of the game to provide more focus on how the father and son produce a bigger impact in Spira's history rather than the romantic couple. Kitase found the story between Tidus and Jecht to be more moving than the story between Tidus and Yuna.\nDesign.\n\"Final Fantasy X\" features innovations in the rendering of characters' facial expressions, achieved through motion capture and skeletal animation technology. This technology allowed animators to create realistic lip movements, which were then programmed to match the speech of the game's voice actors.\nThe cutscene of Tidus and Yuna kissing was developed by Visual Works, a subsidiary of Square Enix. Many of the animators were not experienced with romance scenes - Visual Works director Kazuyuki Ikumori said that the animators sought feedback from younger staff at Square Enix, as well as female members of staff. The scene was remade multiple times after receiving responses that earlier drafts were \"unnatural\" and \"not believable\".\nNojima has revealed that the inclusion of voice acting enabled him to express emotion more powerfully than before, and he was therefore able to keep the storyline simple. He also said that the presence of voice actors led him to make various changes to the script to match the voice actors' personalities with the characters they were portraying. The inclusion of voice, however, led to difficulties. With the game's cutscenes already programmed around the Japanese voice work, the English localization team faced the difficulty of establishing English-oriented dialogue and the obstacle of incorporating this modified wording with the rhythm and timing of the characters' lip movements. Localization specialist Alexander O. Smith noted that the team had to keep the localized sound file within the duration of the original Japanese, as longer files would cause the game to crash. He described the process of fitting natural-sounding English speech into the game as \"something akin to writing four or five movies' worth of dialogue entirely in haiku form [and] of course the actors had to act, and act well, within those restraints\".\nThe game was initially going to feature online elements, offered through Square's PlayOnline service. The features were dropped during production, and online gaming would not become part of the series until \"Final Fantasy XI\". Map director Nakazato wanted to implement a world map concept with a more realistic approach than that of the traditional \"Final Fantasy\" game, in line with the realism of the game's 3D backgrounds, as opposed to pre-rendered backgrounds. Battle art director Shintaro Takai has explained that it was his intention that battles in \"Final Fantasy X\" come across as a natural part of the story and not an independent element. Features would have included wandering enemies visible on the field map, seamless transitions into battles, and the option for players to move around the landscape during enemy encounters. However, hardware limitations resulted in these ideas not being used. Instead, a compromise was made, whereby some transitions from the field map to the battle map were made relatively seamless with the implementation of a motion blur effect that would happen at the end of an event scene. The desire for seamless transitions also led to the implementation of the new summoning system seen in the game.\nAs a player of the games in the \"Final Fantasy\" series, battle director Toshiro Tsuchida wanted to recreate elements he found interesting or entertaining, which eventually led to the removal of the \"Active Time Battle\" system, and instead, incorporated the strategy-focused \"Conditional Turn-Based Battle\" system. Kitase has explained that the purpose behind the Sphere Grid is to give players an interactive means of increasing their characters' attributes, such that they will be able to observe the development of those attributes firsthand. At the time of the game's development, Nojiima had been reading about cryptography, and thus created the means to decode the Al Bhed language within the game, albeit simpler than initially planned.\nMusic.\n\"Final Fantasy X\" marks the first time regular series composer Nobuo Uematsu has had any assistance in composing the score for a game in the main series. His fellow composers for \"X\" were Masashi Hamauzu and Junya Nakano. They were chosen for the soundtrack based on their ability to create music that was different from Uematsu's style while still being able to work together. PlayOnline.com first revealed that the game's theme song was completed in November 2000. As Square still had not revealed who would sing the song, GameSpot personally asked Uematsu, who jokingly answered that it was going to be Rod Stewart.\nThe game features three songs with vocalized elements, including the J-pop ballad \"Suteki da ne\", which translates to \"Isn't it Wonderful?\". The lyrics were written by Kazushige Nojima, and the music was written by Uematsu. The song is performed by Japanese folk singer Rikki, whom the music team contacted while searching for a singer whose music reflected an Okinawan atmosphere. \"Suteki da ne\" is also sung in Japanese in the English version of \"Final Fantasy X\". Like \"Eyes on Me\" from \"VIII\" and \"Melodies of Life\" from \"IX\", an orchestrated version of \"Suteki da ne\" is used as part of the ending theme. The other songs with lyrics are the heavy metal opening theme, \"Otherworld\", sung in English by Bill Muir; and \"Hymn of the Fayth\", a recurring piece sung using Japanese syllabary.\nThe original soundtrack spanned 91 tracks on four discs. It was first released in Japan on August 1, 2001, by DigiCube, and was re-released on May 10, 2004, by Square Enix. In 2002, Tokyopop released a version of \"Final Fantasy X Original Soundtrack\" in North America entitled \"Final Fantasy X Official Soundtrack\", which contained 17 tracks from the original album on a single disc. Other related CDs include \"feel/Go dream: Yuna &amp; Tidus\" which, released in Japan by DigiCube on October 11, 2001, featured tracks based on Tidus' and Yuna's characters. \"Piano Collections Final Fantasy X\", another collection of music from the game, and \"Final Fantasy X Vocal Collection\", a compilations of exclusive character dialogues and songs were both released in Japan in 2002.\nThe Black Mages, a band led by Uematsu that arranges music from \"Final Fantasy\" video games into a rock music style, have arranged three pieces from \"Final Fantasy X\". These are \"Fight With Seymour\" from their self-titled album, published in 2003, and \"Otherworld\" and \"The Skies Above\", both of which can be found on the album \"\", published in 2004. Uematsu continues to perform certain pieces in his \"Dear Friends: Music from Final Fantasy\" concert series. The music of \"Final Fantasy X\" has also appeared in various official concerts and live albums, such as \"20020220 Music from Final Fantasy\", a live recording of an orchestra performing music from the series including several pieces from the game. An odd note is that the unreleased/promo CD-R (Instrumental) version of Madonna's \"What It Feels Like For A Girl\" done by Tracy Young was used in the blitzball sequences. Additionally, \"Swing de Chocobo\" was performed by the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra for the \"Distant Worlds \u2013 Music from Final Fantasy\" concert tour, while \"Zanarkand\" was performed by the New Japan Philharmonic Orchestra in the \"Tour de Japon: Music from Final Fantasy\" concert series. Independent but officially licensed releases of \"Final Fantasy X\" music have been composed by such groups as Project Majestic Mix, which focuses on arranging video game music. Selections also appear on Japanese remix albums, called dojin music, and on English remixing websites.\nVersions and merchandise.\nThe Japanese version of \"Final Fantasy X\" included an additional disc entitled \"The Other Side of Final Fantasy\", which featured interviews, storyboards, and trailers for \"Blue Wing Blitz\", \"Kingdom Hearts\", and \"\", as well as the first footage of \"Final Fantasy XI Online\". An international version of the game was released in Japan as \"Final Fantasy X International\" in January 2002, and in PAL regions under its original title. It features content not available in the original NTSC releases, including battles with \"Dark\" versions of the game's aeons and an airship fight with the superboss Penance. \"Final Fantasy X\" was released as Greatest Hits in North America in September 2003. Electronic Arts handled distribution of \"International\" in Asian territories, except Japan. The Japanese release of \"Final Fantasy X International\" also includes \"Eternal Calm\", a 14-minute video clip bridging the story of \"Final Fantasy X\" with that of its sequel, \"Final Fantasy X-2\". The video clip was included in a bonus DVD for \"Unlimited Saga Collector's Edition\" under the name \"Eternal Calm, Final Fantasy X-2: Prologue\". It was first released in Europe on October 31, 2003, and featured English voice-overs.\nThe international and PAL versions include a bonus DVD called \"Beyond Final Fantasy\", a disc including interviews with the game's developers, and two of the game's English voice actors, James Arnold Taylor (Tidus) and Hedy Burress (Yuna). Also included are trailers for \"Final Fantasy X\" and \"Kingdom Hearts\", a concept and promotional art gallery for the game, and a music video of \"Suteki da ne\" performed by Rikki. In 2005, a compilation featuring \"Final Fantasy X\" and \"X-2\" was released in Japan as \"Final Fantasy X/X-2 Ultimate Box\".\nSquare also produced various types of merchandise and several books, including \"The Art of Final Fantasy X\" and three \"Ultimania\" guides, a series of artbooks/strategy guides published by DigiCube in Japan. They feature original artwork from \"Final Fantasy X\", offer gameplay walkthroughs, expand upon many aspects of the game's storyline and feature several interviews with the game's designers. There are three books in the series: \"Final Fantasy X Scenario Ultimania\", \"Final Fantasy X Battle Ultimania\", and \"Final Fantasy X Ultimania \u03a9\". The game was re-released as part of the \"Final Fantasy 25th Anniversary Ultimate Box\" release in December 2012.\n\"HD Remaster\".\n\"Final Fantasy X\" was re-released in high-definition for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita, in celebration of the game's 10-year anniversary. The remaster was released in December 2013 for Japan, and the following year in March for other markets. The production of the remaster started in January 2012. Producer Yoshinori Kitase was once again involved in the production, and wanted to work on its quality. Character models of Tidus, Yuna, Bahamut and Yojimbo were presented in HD quality. The remaster also included its sequel \"X-2\", remastered in HD and they were released under the title \"Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster\" on a single Blu-ray disc game. It was sold separately on game cartridges on Vita in Japan and sold together in North America, Europe and Australia as a set, with \"FFX\" being on a cartridge and \"FFX-2\" being included as a download voucher. Downloadable versions were available for both systems. The games contain all the content found in the \"International\" version, including \"Eternal Calm\" and \"Last Mission\".\n\"Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster\" was released for the PlayStation 4 worldwide in May 2015. It included enhanced graphics in full HD (1080p), the option to switch to the original soundtrack, and the ability to transfer save files from the PS3 and PS Vita versions. One year later, it was released for Windows via Steam on May 16. It includes an auto-save feature, five game boosters, three parameter changes, the option to skip FMVs/cinematics, 4K resolution support, audio settings and graphic options. A version for the Nintendo Switch and the Xbox One was released on April 16, 2019.\nReception.\n\"Final Fantasy X\" received critical acclaim from video game critics. The Japanese video game magazine \"Famitsu\" and \"Famitsu PS2\" awarded the game a near-perfect 39/40 score. Another Japanese gaming magazine, \"The Play Station\", gave the game a score of 29/30. \"Famitsu\", \"Famitsu PS2\", and \"The Play Station\" expressed particularly favorable responses toward the game's storyline, graphics, and movies. The game maintains a 92 out of 100 on Metacritic. Producer Shinji Hashimoto said that the overall reception to the game was \"excellent\", having received praise and awards from critics.\n\"IGN\"'s David Smith offered praise for the voice actors and the innovations in gameplay, particularly with the revised battle and summon systems, the option to change party members during battle, and the character development and inventory management systems. He also felt that the game's graphics had improved on its predecessors in every way possible, and that the game as a whole was \"the best-looking game of the series [and] arguably the best-playing as well\". Greg Kasavin of \"GameSpot\" praised the game's storyline, calling it surprisingly complex, its ending satisfying, and its avoidance of role-playing game clich\u00e9s commendable with Tidus viewed as an appealing protagonist. He also lauded the music, feeling it was \"diverse and well suited to the various scenes in the game\". Similarly, \"GamePro\" described its character building system and battle system as \"two of the best innovations in the series\". The visuals of the game were commended by \"GameSpy\"'s Raymond Padilla, who referred to them as \"top-notch\", as well as giving praise to the character models, backgrounds, cutscenes, and animations. The voice casting was praised by \"Game Revolution\", who noted most of them were \"above average\" and called the music \"rich\".\n\"Edge\" rated the game considerably lower, criticizing many aspects of the game for being tedious and uninnovative and describing the dialogue as \"nauseating\", particularly panning Tidus. Andrew Reiner of \"Game Informer\" criticized the game's linearity and that players were no longer able to travel the world by chocobo or control the airship. \"Eurogamer\"'s Tom Bramwell noted that the game's puzzle segments were \"depressing\" and \"superfluous\", and that although the Sphere Grid was \"a nice touch\", it took up too much of the game. The linearity of the game was positively commented on by \"GamePro\" who stated that a player would not be required to participate in side-quests or the mini-game to reach the game's conclusion, finding some of them unappealing. Game Revolution complained that cutscenes could not be skipped, some even being too long.\nSales.\nSquare initially expected the game to sell at least two million copies worldwide owing to the reduced PlayStation 2's fanbase, making it smaller than the last three released titles. However, within its first day of its release in Japan, more than 2.14 million units were shipped, including 1.4 to 1.5 million pre-orders. A million units were sold within hours, and first-day shipments were expected to generate \u00a5 or $ in sales revenue. These figures exceeded the performances of \"Final Fantasy VII\" and \"IX\" in a comparable period, and \"Final Fantasy X\" became the first PlayStation 2 game to reach two and four million sold copies. In October 2007, the game was listed as the 8th best-selling game for the PlayStation 2. \"Final Fantasy X\" sold over 2.43 million copies in Japan alone in 2001.\nBy June 2002, it had sold 5.07 million units worldwide, including 2.76 million in the Asia-Pacific region, 1.47 million in North America, and 840,000 in Europe. By March 2003, the game had sold 5.89 million units worldwide, including 2.87 million in Japan and 3.02 million abroad. It sold 6.6 million copies worldwide by January 2004. By July 2006, it had sold 2.3 million copies and earned $95 million in the United States ($ in 2024). \"Next Generation\" ranked it as the 11th highest-selling game launched for the PlayStation 2, Xbox or GameCube between January 2000 and July 2006 in that country. As of March 2013, the game had shipped over 8.5 million copies worldwide on PS2. As of 2017, the PS2 version of the game has sold over 8 million copies worldwide.\nThe \"Ultimate Hits\" bargain reissue of the game in September 2005 sold over 131,000 copies in Japan by the end of 2006. As of October 2013, \"Final Fantasy X\" and its sequel \"X-2\" had together sold over 14 million copies worldwide on PlayStation 2.\nAwards.\n\"Final Fantasy X\" received the Best Game Award from the Japan Game Awards for 2001\u201302. In \"GameSpot\"'s \"Best and Worst Awards\" from 2001, it came seventh in the category \"Top 10 Video Games of the Year\", and won the \"Best Story\" and \"Best Role-Playing Game\" awards. The game also received a PlayStation 2 Game of the Year award nomination at the 2002 Golden Joystick Awards, but lost to \"Grand Theft Auto III\". Readers of \"Famitsu\" magazine voted it the best game of all time in early 2006. \"Final Fantasy X\" came in fifth on \"IGN\"'s \"Top 25 PS2 Games of All Time\" list in 2007 and sixth in \"The Top 10 Best Looking PS2 Games of All Time\". In a similar list by \"GameSpy\", the game took the 21st place. \"1UP.com\" listed its revelation during the ending as the third-biggest video game spoiler, while \"IGN\" ranked the ending as the fifth best pre-rendered cutscene. In a Reader's Choice made in 2006 by \"IGN\", it ranked as the 60th-best video game. It was also named one of the 20 essential Japanese role-playing games by \"Gamasutra\". It also placed 43rd in \"Game Informer\"'s list of \"The Top 200 Games of All Time\". In 2004, \"Final Fantasy X\" was listed as one of the best games ever made by \"GameFAQs\", while in November 2005 it was voted as the 12th \"Best Game Ever\". In a general overview of the series, both \"GamesRadar\" and \"IGN\" listed \"Final Fantasy X\" as the fourth best game. At the 6th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards in 2003, it was nominated for \"Outstanding Achievement in Animation\" and \"Console Role-Playing Game of the Year\". Readers from GameFaqs also voted it as Game of the Year during 2001. In 2008, readers of \"Dengeki\" magazine voted it the second best game ever made. It was voted first place in \"Famitsu\"'s and \"Dengeki\"'s polls of most tear-inducing games of all time. Both Tidus and Yuna have been popular characters in games due to their personalities and their romantic relationship.\nLegacy.\nDue to its commercial and critical success, Square Enix released a direct sequel to \"Final Fantasy X\" in 2003, titled \"Final Fantasy X-2\". The sequel is set two years after the conclusion of \"Final Fantasy X\", establishing new conflicts and dilemmas and resolving loose ends left by the original game. Although the sequel did not sell as well as the original, 5.4 million units versus over 8 million units, it can still be considered a commercial success. As a result of the title's popularity, Yoshinori Kitase and Kazushige Nojima decided to establish a plot-related connection between \"Final Fantasy X\" and \"Final Fantasy VII\", another well-received\" Final Fantasy\" game. In 2013, after the release of the \"HD Remaster\", Nojima said that he would like to see a second sequel to \"X\", and if there were demand for it, it could happen. The minigame of blitzball has made it into other games, such as its sequel, and was mentioned as a possibility for \"\".\nThe advancements in portraying realistic emotions achieved with \"Final Fantasy X\" through voice-overs and detailed facial expressions have since become a staple of the series, with \"X-2\" and other subsequent titles (such as \"\", \"Final Fantasy XII\", \"XIII\" and its sequels, and \"XV\") also featuring this development. Traversing real-time 3D environments instead of an overworld map has also become a standard of the series. \"Final Fantasy X\" can be considered a pioneer in 3-D RPG maps. The Sphere Grid system of \"FFX\" had an influence on the action role-playing game \"Path of Exile\" (2013), along with the Materia system of \"Final Fantasy VII\".\nAccording to Square Enix producer Shinji Hashimoto, cosplays of the characters have been popular. Takeo Kujiraoka, director of \"Dissidia Final Fantasy NT\", regarded \"Final Fantasy X\" as his favorite game from the franchise based on its emotional impact on the players as well as the multiple amount of playable content that surpasses 100 hours. Kujiraoka noted that the staff received multiple requests by fans to include Tidus' and Yuna's \"Will\" look as an alternative design but Nomura said it was not possible as the company would first need to develop \"Final Fantasy X-3\".\nIn addition, a kabuki stage adaptation of the game's story, \"Kinoshita Group presents New Kabuki Final Fantasy X\", a collaboration between Square Enix and Tokyo Broadcasting System, was performed at the IHI Stage Around Tokyo from March 4 to April 12, 2023, with a cast including Kikunosuke Onoe as Tidus and Yonekichi Nakamura as Yuna.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "52761", "revid": "1340380", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52761", "title": "Final Fantasy Chronicles", "text": "Video game compilation released in 2001\nFinal Fantasy Chronicles is a compilation of Square's role-playing video games \"Final Fantasy IV\" (1991) and \"Chrono Trigger\" (1995), released for the North American Sony PlayStation on July 2, 2001. TOSE ported both titles from the Super Nintendo Entertainment System; each had been previously released as individual Japanese PlayStation ports in 1997 (\"Final Fantasy IV\") and 1999 (\"Chrono Trigger\"). Several bonus features were added to each game, such as art galleries, bestiaries, and cutscenes\u2014including computer-generated imagery full motion video used at the beginning of \"Final Fantasy IV\" and anime scenes used throughout \"Chrono Trigger\".\n\"Final Fantasy Chronicles\" was received well by players and critics, who praised the peripheral features and the fact that Square was offering RPG classics to a new generation of gamers. Conversely, reviewers sharply criticized \"long and frequent loading\" between areas and battles due to poor emulation. Enough copies of \"Chronicles\" were sold to warrant a second release as part of Sony's Greatest Hits in June 2003.\nGameplay.\nIn \"Final Fantasy IV\" and \"Chrono Trigger\", the player controls a set of characters, closely following the role-playing video game genre. The methods of viewing and controlling the characters are separated by three different \"screens\": the overworld, where the characters traverse to different locations; the field map, where the characters explore locations such as towns and dungeons; and the battle screen, where the characters fight with monsters or other enemies.\n\"Final Fantasy IV\".\n\"Final Fantasy IV\" introduced the Active Time Battle, a system designed by Hiroyuki Ito. It centers around the player inputting orders for the characters in \"real time\" during battles. Each character is balanced through certain strengths and weaknesses; for instance, a strong magic user may have low defense, while a physical fighter may have low agility.\n\"Chrono Trigger\".\n\"Chrono Trigger\"'s gameplay deviates from traditional role-playing games in that, rather than random encounters, most enemies are openly visible on field maps or lie in wait to ambush the party. Contact with enemies on a field map initiates a battle that occurs directly on the field map itself rather than on a separate battle screen. \"Chrono Trigger\" uses an updated form of the Active Time Battle introduced in \"Final Fantasy IV\", with additions such as \"Techs\" that rely on enemy positioning and abilities of characters. Other features are the employment of time travel and a \"New Game Plus\" option.\nDevelopment.\n\"Final Fantasy Chronicles\" features two previously released ports by TOSE; \"Final Fantasy IV\" and \"Chrono Trigger\" were released separately, and \"IV\" was re-released as a part of \"Final Fantasy Collection\", all published in Japan. \"Chronicles\" was designed and directed by Kazuhiko Aoki, supervised by Fumiaki Fukaya, and produced by Akihiro Imai. It was created as a follow-up to \"Final Fantasy Anthology\", a compilation of \"Final Fantasy V\" and \"VI\".\nThe original \"Final Fantasy IV\" was released in North America as \"Final Fantasy II\" in 1991, with various \"Easytype\" modifications. These were removed in the \"Final Fantasy Chronicles\" version, and the game was re-localized, achieving a script closer Takashi Tokita's original scenario. \"Chrono Trigger\", released in 1995, was already localized by Ted Woolsey, but the \"Final Fantasy Chronicles\" version has additional modifications.\nA primary addition to both games is full-motion video. \"Final Fantasy IV\" features computer animated cutscene sequences, while \"Chrono Trigger\" features anime-style sequences designed by Akira Toriyama and animated by Toei Animation that \"help further tell the story of Chrono Trigger\". \"Final Fantasy IV\" was given gameplay features such as a two-player mode, a \"Sprint Feature\" to \"enhance and quicken gameplay\", and the \"Memo File\" system to \"reduce saving time\". \"Chrono Trigger\", instead of added gameplay features, has an \"Extras Mode\". This features databases such as a bestiary and a gallery of artwork created in development.\nPromotion and merchandising.\nA compilation of \"Final Fantasy IV\" and \"Chrono Trigger\" was in consideration in December 2000, with \"Final Fantasy Anthology\"'s success a key decision factor. \"Final Fantasy Chronicles\" was announced by Square Electronic Arts in April 2001. President Jun Iwasaki mentioned an \"overwhelming number\" of requests to re-release \"Chrono Trigger\", and believed the compilation of it and \"Final Fantasy IV\" would \"appeal to fans of the original games and introduce a new generation of gamers to some of our classic titles\". An event was held on July 10 in San Francisco, primarily to celebrate the film \"\" and release of \"Final Fantasy Chronicles\". It featured a cosplay contest, a memorabilia raffle, and booths to play \"Final Fantasy Chronicles\" and \"Final Fantasy X\".\n\"Music from Final Fantasy Chronicles\" is a set of two separately released compact discs published by TokyoPop. \"Final Fantasy IV Official Soundtrack\" and \"Chrono Trigger Original Soundtrack\" were both released on August 21, 2001. \"Final Fantasy IV Official Soundtrack\" is nearly the same release as \"Final Fantasy IV: Original Sound Version\", the soundtrack album for the original game, except that the songs were rerecorded by TOSE, resulting in minor differences, some song titles were slightly changed, and a 45th track was added, \"Theme of Love (Arranged)\", which had previously only been released as a piano version on the second track of \"Piano Collections Final Fantasy IV\". This release has the catalog number TPCD 0210\u20132, and its 45 tracks had a length of 62 minutes. \"Chrono Trigger Original Soundtrack\" was the corresponding album for \"Chrono Trigger\". The album was heavily based on \"Chrono Trigger Original Soundtrack\", the soundtrack album for the PlayStation release of \"Chrono Trigger\"; the first 21 tracks of the album out of 25 were identical to \"Chrono Trigger Original Soundtrack\", while the next three tracks corresponded to tracks 22, 23, and 29 of the \"Original Soundtrack\" and the final track was the same as the first track of \"Brink of Time\", an arranged album of \"Chrono Trigger\" music. The album is 1:13:03 long, and has a catalog number of TPCD 0209\u20132. In addition to the albums, a strategy guide for \"Final Fantasy Chronicles\" written by Dan Birlew and was published by BradyGames on July 2, 2001.\nReception.\n\"Final Fantasy Chronicles\" was commercially and critically successful, becoming the top selling PlayStation title for two weeks, and scoring an average of 89 out of 100 in Metacritic's aggregate, a review tallying website. Gaming website \"IGN\" rated it 9.4/10 and awarded an \"Editor's Choice Award\", calling the game a \"must buy\" for RPG fans. It was a runner-up for \"GameSpot\"'s annual \"Best PlayStation Game\" award, which went to \"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3\".\n\"GameSpot\" reviewer Brad Shoemaker gave the game an 8.5, but cited \"muffled sound effects\" in \"Final Fantasy IV\", and was displeased with frequent loading in \"Chrono Trigger\". He added that the visuals were \"stupendous\" when the games were originally released, but they now look dated and will \"turn off those looking for a bigger thrill for their gaming dollar\". Marcus Lai of Gaming Age was disappointed with a lack of additions, calling the ports \"barebone games\" and claiming that the full motion videos are \"nice touches to both games but don't add much\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "52762", "revid": "6729166", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52762", "title": "Final Fantasy Mystic Quest", "text": "1992 video game\nFinal Fantasy Mystic Quest, released as Mystic Quest Legend in PAL regions and as in Japan, is a role-playing video game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It was released as a spin-off to Square's \"Final Fantasy\" series of video games. \"Final Fantasy Mystic Quest\" was first released in North America in 1992 and marketed as a \"simplified role-playing game... designed for the entry-level player\" in an attempt to broaden the genre's appeal. The game's presentation and battle system is broadly similar to that of the main series, but differs in its inclusion of action-adventure game elements. It was also the first \"Final Fantasy\" game to be released in Europe.\nThe player controls a youth named Benjamin in his quest to save the world. His goal is to reclaim a set of stolen crystals that determine the state of the world's four elemental powers. The gameplay takes a departure from the main series in a variety of ways, eliminating many series staples such as random battles, save points, manual equipment, and the party system. The game received middling reviews and sales in North America and Japan, citing its simplified gameplay and lack of depth in the game's story. It has retained its reputation for being a \"beginner's \"Final Fantasy\"\" and has been praised for its music.\nGameplay.\nExploration.\nLike previous games in the series, \"Final Fantasy Mystic Quest\" is presented in a top-down perspective, with players directly navigating the main character around the world to interact with objects and people. The game features a unique way of traveling the world map. Unlike past \"Final Fantasy\" games, players cannot freely roam the world map. Instead, they travel along set paths from one \"icon\" (pictorial image on the world map) to the next. Some routes are blocked off (restriction is indicated by a gray arrow), but become accessible when the player succeeds in a specific task, such as completing a dungeon. Once its path is open, the player can enter an icon; the game's plot and action takes place within these icons, which include towns, dungeons, and battlefields. The game is characterized by featuring action-adventure game elements; besides jumping, players can use weapons outside of battle, which play an active role in exploration. Players can chop down trees with an axe, detonate bombs to open sealed doorways, or use a grappling hook to clear wide gaps. The game has more puzzles than earlier \"Final Fantasy\" games. In the Falls Basin, for example, players must move pillars of ice across the ground level in such a fashion that they can be used as platforms to jump across on the second level. \"Mystic Quest\" does away with save points; players can save their progress at any time during exploration.\nBattle system.\n\"Final Fantasy Mystic Quest\" eliminates the system of random enemy encounters, a trademark of the main series. Instead, battles are represented in dungeons as stationary enemy sprites, and the player is given the option of approaching the enemy and engaging a battle. Once engaged in battle, the player is thrust into the battle screen, which presents a window-based menu with three commands to choose from: battle, run, or control. Running from battle transports the player back to the field screen, while choosing \"control\" toggles between the ally's battle mode, where the player can manually control the main character's ally or opt for a computer-controlled ally. If players choose to battle, they are presented with a submenu of four more options: physically attack the enemy, cast a spell, use a curative item (such as a Cure potion), or defend. The game's battle system relies on conditional turn-based combat, where the characters and enemies cycle through rounds in battling each other, with the first action of the turn awarded to the fastest character. Enemy sprites are always far larger than player sprites in battle, despite appearing further away from the game camera. Some animals attack by physically crushing the players.\nCharacter health is represented by an incremental life bar, although the player may choose to have it displayed in numerical fractions as in most role-playing games. If all character life bars reach zero, the game is over, but the player is given the option of continuing and restarting the battle. If the player chooses this option, however, the main character's attack power may suffer temporarily as a penalty. A character's performance in battle is determined by numerical figures (called statistics) for vitality, attacking power, defensive capabilities, speed, magical prowess, accuracy, and evasion. Character statistics are driven by experience points (EXP) gained from winning battles, which accumulate until players achieve milestones known as \"experience levels\". Besides awarding experience points, battling enemies also earns the player gold pieces (GP), which can be used to buy weapons, armor, and curative items. In the absence of random enemy encounters, battlefields are scattered across the world map. Players are immediately thrust into a battle when entering a battlefield, and must win ten enemy battles to \"clean out\" the battlefield. Once a battlefield is cleaned out, players are awarded either a large amount of experience, a large amount of GP, a piece of armor, or a magic spell.\nCustomization.\nUnlike all other \"Final Fantasy\" games, players cannot manually equip characters with armor. Instead, newly acquired armor replaces the main character's current equipment, or upgrades a current version of a weapon, e.g. obtaining the knight sword will replace the steel sword. Using the L and R buttons allows the user to cycle through the weapons that have been collected so far. Benjamin uses four types of weapons: swords, axes, bombs, and claws. Although the weapons share a similar function in battle, all have different purposes when exploring the field map. The Dragon Claw, for example, doubles as a grappling hook. The weapon arsenal in \"Final Fantasy Mystic Quest\" is considerably smaller than most role-playing games.\nMagic in \"Mystic Quest\" is not learned by designated spellcasters through experience. Instead, the main character acquires magic spells through treasure chests or as a reward for clearing out battlefields. The system of spellcasting is similar to that of the original \"Final Fantasy\"; rather than using magic points to draw upon for supplying magic, spells are used according to a set number for their type, i.e., white magic, black magic, or wizard magic. The allotted number for each type increases as a character levels up. A spell's effectiveness is proportional to a character's experience level; the higher the character's level, the more powerful the Fire spell, for example. The spell catalog in \"Mystic Quest\" is limited compared to most other \"Final Fantasy\" games. Items in the game are analogous to the spells. Notably, the Heal spell and potion act as a cure-all for status ailments, eliminating the need for unique status recovery items. Similarly, the Cure spell and potion each restore 25% of player's maximum hit points regardless of level, so there is no need for a range of potion or spell strengths.\nPlot.\nSetting.\n\"Final Fantasy Mystic Quest\" takes place on a single continent of an unnamed world, which is divided into four distinct regions: Foresta, Aquaria, Fireburg, and Windia. The welfare of each region is determined by the state of one of four shining crystals: earth, water, fire, and wind, respectively. For centuries the Focus Tower had stood at the heart of the world. It had been a center for trade and knowledge, and the world's people met there to peacefully settle their differences. But on one warm summer day, powerful monsters stormed the Tower, stole the four crystals, and took off with the magical coins that kept the Tower's doors unlocked. The monsters began consuming the power of the crystals; they grew in strength while the world began to decay. An old prophecy tells that at the time the \"vile four\" steal the power and divide the world behind four doors, a knight will appear to vanquish the darkness.\nStory.\nThe game opens with an adventurous youth named Benjamin climbing the Hill of Destiny. While exploring, his village is destroyed in an earthquake. As Benjamin is climbing the Hill, he meets a mysterious old man who charges Benjamin with fulfilling the knight's prophecy. Although initially in disbelief, Benjamin accepts the role and the Old Man shows him the Focus Tower, supposedly the center of the World. After defeating a monster at the top of the hill, Benjamin follows the Old Man to the Level Forest, where he is tasked with recovering the Crystal of Earth. Proceeding to Foresta, he meets with an axe-wielding girl named Kaeli, who agrees to help Benjamin if he can help her rid the Level Forest of monsters. Kaeli is ambushed and poisoned in the process, and her mother informs Benjamin of the Elixir and where it can be found. Benjamin's search for Elixir to heal Kaeli brings him to Bone Dungeon, where he's aided by a treasure hunter named Tristam in succeeding dual purposes: not only does Benjamin get Elixir from Tristam to heal Kaeli, but he defeats one of the four Vile Evils, Flamerous Rex, to free the Crystal of Earth and in turn restore life to the dying village of Foresta. Tristam leaves and Benjamin heals Kaeli.\nBenjamin is told that Aquaria is in danger, and is in need of help. He is told by the Old Man and various others that he should see Spencer. He is told that a girl named Phoebe can help him as well. After proceeding through the first stage of the Focus Tower, and arriving in the province of Aquaria, Benjamin locates Phoebe, and learns that Spencer is trapped underground by thick ice floes. Phoebe needs the \"wakewater\", which is said to be able to help free Aquaria. Benjamin and Phoebe head to the Wintry Cave and defeat a monster to obtain the Libra Crest. Using this crest to enter Life Temple from the Libra Temple, they find that the source of the \"wakewater\" has dried up. Finding the Old Man in the back of the Life Temple, they find that he holds the only bag of wakewater, and to use it on the plant in the center of town. Back in Aquaria, they find that the wakewater does not work, and reviving the crystal is the only thing that will save the town and Spencer. They head off for the Ice Pyramid and defeat the second of the Vile Evils, the Ice Golem. The Water Crystal is saved, and Benjamin and Phoebe head back to Aquaria. They find the town is now like Foresta after the crystal is revived there and Spencer is back and digging his tunnel to save Kaeli's father Captain Mac. Upon leaving, Spencer hands the Venus Key to Benjamin, and tells him to head for Fireburg.\nBenjamin arrives in the Focus Tower to find the Old Man again, who tells him to find Reuben, and disappears. Benjamin heads for Fireburg, and finds Reuben. Reuben joins when Benjamin promises to help free Reuben's dad, Arion. Upon finding Tristam in the Inn who gives Benjamin the Multi-Key, they find the coward who left Arion in the mine in a locked house. He teaches Benjamin how to throw the bombs and says that it will free Arion. Benjamin and Reuben then proceed to the Mine and free Arion. Arion tells some tales of how the Fire Crystal has gone berserk, and Reuben goes off with Benjamin to the Volcano to stop the Vile Evil from stealing the crystal's power. After defeating the Dualhead Hydra, Benjamin and Reuben find the Fire Crystal returning to power. They decide to head to Windia, and Reuben is ambushed by monsters and falls off the rope bridge. Tristam comes along and helps Benjamin cross the bridge, but they are stymied by a tree who won't talk to them. Tristam says that there is a gal in Foresta who can talk to tree spirits, and the two drop in on Aquaria where Kaeli was trying to find Spencer. Benjamin and Tristam go down into the tunnel and find Spencer, who tells Tristam of a great treasure. They leave, and Phoebe plants a bomb that collapses a tunnel Spencer was building. She leaves to tell Spencer what happened, and Benjamin takes Kaeli to the Alive Forest to talk to the dormant tree spirit. He tells them that he will take them to Windia if they kill the monsters dwelling within him. They do and he takes them to Windia.\nUpon arriving in Windia, Benjamin and Kaeli find Otto, whose daughter Norma was caught in Pazuzu's Tower when the winds from nearby Mount Gale knocked out his Rainbow Road. The only way the road works is when there is no wind, so Benjamin and Kaeli proceed to Mount Gale and stop the wind by defeating a powerful monster at the top. After returning to Windia, Otto powers up the Rainbow Road and the two adventurers proceed to Pazuzu's Tower. After giving chase, they corner Pazuzu and defeat the fourth Vile Evil and restore the Wind Crystal. Norma is reunited with Otto, and Kaeli stays to take care of her. Reuben shows up and after a series of long events Captain Mac is rescued. Reuben falls down because of the injury sustained on the Rope Bridge, and Phoebe joins Benjamin instead.\nThe Old Man tells Benjamin an ominous addendum to the prophecy: \"The one behind the four is darker than the night, and rises midst the land\". It becomes known that the Dark King is the true source of evil. Benjamin thus sails to Doom Castle to confront the Dark King, who threatens to enslave Benjamin along with the rest of mankind. The Dark King claims that he wrote and spread the prophecy Benjamin had followed throughout his quest. Once the Dark King is defeated, the old man congratulates Benjamin and reveals that he is the Crystal of Light in the guise of a human. At the end of the game, Benjamin is seen still craving adventure, and he borrows the ship from Captain Mac as his friends gather to wish him off. While sailing, Tristam makes a surprise appearance.\nDevelopment.\nAlthough designed by one of Square's development teams in Japan, \"Final Fantasy Mystic Quest\" was specifically geared for the U.S. market. At the time, console role-playing games were not a major genre in North America; Square thus attempted to broaden the genre's appeal through this title. Square had already released several \"Final Fantasy\" spin-offs in North America, including the first three titles in the \"SaGa\" series as \"Final Fantasy Legend\", and the first \"Mana\" series game as \"Final Fantasy Adventure\", and wished to further break into the popular American consciousness. Square's executives cited the alleged difficulty of role-playing games as the reason Americans shied away from them, and eased the difficulty level by tweaking various aspects of the main series' gameplay. The American release of \"Final Fantasy IV\" was altered to make the game simpler, for example. \"Mystic Quest\" was to take this one step further, and the Japanese developers worked with the American offices to make sure the game was accessible to children.\n\"Mystic Quest\" was developed in a graphic and gameplay style similar to \"Final Fantasy Legend III\" (part of the aforementioned \"SaGa\" series). The gameplay shares numerous similarities with that title, featuring a very similar battle system, graphical interface, and dungeon system. Even the jump feature from \"Final Fantasy Legend III\" has been reproduced, and almost all of the icons - from caves to the enemy sprites - are a color-upgraded version of \"Final Fantasy Legend III\"'s character set. Besides allowing for computer-controlled allies, the game did away with random battles, complicated storylines, and text-based menus. To appeal to the perceived tastes of North American audiences, which gravitated towards fast-paced games, Square included action-adventure game elements; players could now brandish weapons outside of battle, jump, use a grappling hook, and set bombs to open new paths. North American translator Ted Woolsey explained that \"the action/adventure players... are larger in numbers and the demographic is different. They tend to be younger and like the idea of jumping straight into the action with a sword in their hands; it's an empowerment issue - you get to go out there, start whacking things and it feels good! With the more traditional RPGs, it takes a good 15 or 20 hours of playing before you're finally hooked\". Woolsey said that \"Mystic Quest\" was one of the easiest games he had to translate, due to the game's small size. Because the game was marketed towards a younger demographic, the game sold for US$39.99.\nRelease.\nAfter its U.S. debut, \"Final Fantasy Mystic Quest\" was released in Japan under the title \"Final Fantasy USA: Mystic Quest\". The European release of the game was released in English, German and French. The European release had its title changed to \"Mystic Quest Legend\" to avoid confusion with \"Final Fantasy Adventure\", which had been released in Europe as \"Mystic Quest\". \"Final Fantasy Mystic Quest\" was first unveiled in June at the 1992 Summer Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago, where it was a popular venue, and the game was later presented in more detail in the Fall 1992 issue of the \"Ogopogo Examiner\".\nAudio.\nThe game's soundtrack was composed by Ryuji Sasai and Yasuhiro Kawakami. It was one of the first games bearing the \"Final Fantasy\" name not to be composed by series regular Nobuo Uematsu, after \"Final Fantasy Adventure\" (known in Japan as \"Seiken Densetsu: Final Fantasy Gaiden\") and the \"Final Fantasy Legend\" trilogy (known in Japan as the \"Sa\u00b7Ga\" trilogy). The album was first released on one compact disc by NTT Publishing on September 10, 1993. ROM capacity limits and hardware limitations made the composition process difficult. After the game was completed, Sasai recorded two remixes on his days off for the game's album, and personally played the guitar parts. \"Mountain Range of Whirlwinds\" was built off of Sasai's liking of the sound of the french horn, and its ability to go the length of the song and convey a sense of mountains. The track \"Last Castle\" was written in a short time, and was used to create imagery of a field, but its length left very little space for the \"Battle 3\" song.'\nReception.\nAccording to Square's publicity department, \"Final Fantasy Mystic Quest\" sold a total of 800,000 units, with roughly half of these sold in Japan.\nThe game did not generate much excitement in either America or Japan, although it is thought to have appealed to younger fans. The game ultimately failed in its bid to bring mainstream North American popularity to console RPGs, and simultaneously alienated fans of the series anticipating another epic following \"Final Fantasy IV\". \"Electronic Games\" described the title as \"\"Final Fantasy\" with an identity crisis\" due to the inherent flaw of creating a game that didn't appeal to the masses or the hard-core gaming audience.\nReviews written in the years after its initial release remained largely negative. After the Wii Virtual Console release, \"Kotaku\" dubbed it \"The Worst Final Fantasy\" in the title of the review, and \"GamesRadar\" called it a \"franchise embarrassment\" for its enemies that stand still and wait for players to attack. \"IGN\" rated the Wii Virtual Console release a 6.0, or \"Okay\", citing an extremely repetitive and simple battle system, and very little character development. \"1UP.com\" rated the game a \"Not Worth It!\", calling it \"handholding\" and \"insubstantial\".\nIt was, however, praised for its music, including \"1UP.com\" praising its \"sweet sampled metal guitar licks\", and listed the final boss battle music as one of the must download songs for the \"Final Fantasy\" music game \"Theatrhythm Final Fantasy\". It was also praised by \"GamesRadar\" for its music, mentioning the boss battle in their \"Game Music of the Day\" column, and also mentioning the rest of the game music as smooth and easy listening. On April 1, 2006, \"GameSpot\" included \"Mystic Quest\" in an April's Fools list entitled \"Top 10 Final Fantasy Games\", which mostly consisted of spin-offs from the main series and unrelated games. \"Mystic Quest\" was \"praised\" for being easy and having simplistic graphics and plot. In October 2010, the game was released on Nintendo's Virtual Console. \"Famitsu\" has also reported that Square was preparing the game for release on the Android mobile platform in 2012. In 2018, \"Complex\" ranked the game 66th on their \"The Best Super Nintendo Games of All Time\". They liked the game being a simple more laid back \"Final Fantasy\" game and also liked the game music.\nThe main character Benjamin and several songs have appeared in \"\" and \"Theatrhythm Final Bar Line\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "52763", "revid": "6729166", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52763", "title": "The Final Fantasy Legend", "text": "1989 video game\nThe Final Fantasy Legend, originally released in Japan as is a 1989 role-playing video game developed and published by Square for the Game Boy. It was originally released in Japan in December 1989 and North America in September 1990. It is the first game in the \"SaGa\" series and the first role-playing game for the system. Square translated the game into English for worldwide release and renamed it, linking it with the \"Final Fantasy\" series to improve marketing. Sunsoft re-released it in North America during 1998; Square followed with a Japan-exclusive remake released for the WonderSwan Color and mobile phones in 2002 and 2007 respectively, it was also ported to the Nintendo Switch in 2020 and later ported to Android, iOS and Microsoft Windows in 2021.\n\"The Final Fantasy Legend\" operates on a turn-based system similar to that of \"Final Fantasy II\". The game's characters battle monsters and fiends using a variety of weapons, armor, and skills that develop through the player's actions. The game follows the story of four heroes who attempt to scale a tower at the center of the world that supposedly leads to paradise. The four heroes may belong to one of three character classes, each housing a unique customization path.\n\"The Final Fantasy Legend\" was conceived by Nobuyuki Hoshino and developed under director Akitoshi Kawazu; renowned composer Nobuo Uematsu wrote its score. The game is Square's first million seller with 1.37 million units shipped. Though released to mixed reception, it has since been described as one of the Game Boy's greatest games and cited as an influence for series such as the \"Pok\u00e9mon\" franchise.\nGameplay.\nIn \"The Final Fantasy Legend\", the player navigates a character throughout the game world with a party of up to four characters, exploring areas and interacting with non-player characters. Most of the game occurs in towns, castles, caves, and similar areas. To aid exploration on the field screen, the game makes use of various signs within towns. The player is initially limited to the World of Continent to explore, and given access to later worlds as his or her party climbs the Tower. Players can save their game anytime and anywhere when not in combat to a save slot for later play.\nPlayers can journey between field screen locations via the world map, a downsized representation of \"Final Fantasy Legend\"'s various worlds. Players can freely navigate around the world map screen unless restricted by terrain, such as water or mountains. The goal in each world is to find the entrance to the next level of the Tower. Random enemy encounters occasionally interrupt travel across the world map screen and hostile areas, as in other \"Final Fantasy\" related games.\nClasses.\nAt the beginning of the game, the player must choose a character class, gender, and name for the group's \"party leader\". There are three available classes: \"humans\", \"mutants\" (\"espers\" in the Japanese version), and \"monsters\", each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Character classes cannot be changed once the game has begun. The player may recruit up to three additional party members through a similar process via \"Member Guilds\" in various towns. Characters may also be recruited to replace fallen party members, though the party leader is irreplaceable. Higher-level party members may be recruited at later towns in the game.\nA character's performance in battle is determined by numerical values (\"statistics\") for four categories. Each statistic has a range of 1 to 99. The categories are \"strength\", the effectiveness of physical attacks; \"defense\", the ability to reduce damage received; \"agility\", the effectiveness of ranged weapons or skills and at avoiding attacks; and \"mana\", the effectiveness of magical attacks. A character's health is measured in \"hit points\" (\"HP\"), consisting of a current HP statistic and a maximum HP statistic, ranging from 0 to 999. Character statistics are relative to their class\u2014humans have higher HP levels, strength, and defense, and mutants are physically weaker but enjoy a higher mana statistic. Human and mutant statistics can be amplified by worn equipment of different types. Monster-class characters are dependent on their sub-class, and their statistics vary greatly.\nHumans raise their statistics through items that grant permanent bonuses, such as \"STRENGTH\" or \"HP200\". Mutant attributes simply increase by random increments after battles, and new abilities may be gained (or lost) in the process. Monsters change in power by consuming \"meat\" dropped in battles; depending on the monster's current sub-class and the meat's origin, the monster may transform into a stronger or weaker sub-class or fully recover health. Later versions of the game released upon the WonderSwan and mobile phones removed the latter effect entirely.\nEquipment and abilities.\nThe basic function of equipment in \"SaGa\" games is to increase character attributes. Arming a character with a gold helmet increases his or her base defense statistic, for example. The amount of equipment that can be placed on any one character at any time depends on the character's class. Humans can hold eight, mutants four, and monsters none. There are five types of armor: \"shields\", \"helmets\", \"breastplates\", \"gauntlets\", and \"shoes\". Only one of each at a time may be added to one character and cannot be added to monsters. Weapons, consisting of swords, hammers, whips, spell books, and guns, utilize either the strength, agility or mana attribute of a character, and can be used only a certain number of times before breaking and being removed from the player's inventory. Shields can be used as items in combat, most with a limited number of uses, and allow the user to evade enemy attacks.\nMutants and monsters have different spells and abilities depending on their battle experience and sub-class. These come in one of four categories: \"attack\", \"non-combative\", \"healing\", and \"resistances/weaknesses\". When used in combat, attack spells and abilities will damage a target by an elemental type, while non-combative spells and abilities inflict various status ailments (such as \"blindness\") or grant benefits upon a target. Healing spells and abilities restore a target's HP and can be used outside of combat. Certain spells and abilities have added traits, like affecting a group of enemies or draining HP from a target. Each spell and ability has a finite number of uses, and once depleted the party must visit an inn to recharge them. Resistances and weaknesses are abilities that are active throughout combat. Represented by an \"O\" or \"X\" next to the related element or status ailment, they respectively give the user either resistance or weakness to one or more types of attack; status ailments grant immunity against a particular ailment.\nCurative items can be found or purchased in the game through various means, each with a limited number of uses and able to be activated from a character's inventory or the items sub-menu to restore HP or remove a status ailment in or out of combat from a single target. Like other inventory items, in order to be used during combat these must be placed in a party member's equipment slot prior to battle.\nCombat.\nCombat is initiated when the player encounters an enemy, which changes the map to the \"battle screen\". The enemy appears at the top, above the current party characters; each battle uses a menu-driven turn-based system. At the beginning of each turn, the player selects whether to fight or attempt to run. If the fight option is selected, the player selects an action for each party member from his or her equipment or skills to attack, defend, use magic, or use equipped items. Once the player has chosen actions for each player character, the player characters and enemy begin battle. Participants move one at a time determined by their agility statistic. If the player tries the \"attempt to run\" option and it fails, the party skip their turn and the enemy attacks. Combat ends if the party successfully flees, all enemies are defeated, or all player characters are defeated; in the last case, the game ends and must be reloaded from the last save.\nWinning battles may award the player money (\"GP\") and items. Enemy monsters occasionally drop meat, which can be consumed by monster-class characters. Mutant classes may \"evolve\" at this point, randomly gaining either increased statistics or a new random magic spell or ability, possibly overwriting an existing one. Party members that lose HP during combat can have them restored via curative items, spells, inns, or elements of the world such as healing fountains. If a party member other than the starting character is defeated in battle, he or she loses a \"heart\" and must be resurrected in a town via the building with a large heart-shaped symbol on it. Defeated characters with no remaining hearts cannot be revived. An item can be bought at significant expense to restore a heart to a character. Alternatively, a fallen party member can also be replaced completely with a new character recruited from a town guild, regardless of the number of hearts they have remaining.\nStory.\nSetting.\n\"The Final Fantasy Legend\" takes place on several worlds centered around a large tower, built by the Creator in ancient times (God in the Japanese version) to link worlds. There are four unique major worlds that make up different layers of the tower: the World of Continent at the base, the World of Ocean on the 5th floor, the World of Sky on the 10th, and the World of Ruins on the 16th. Time does not flow at a constant pace between levels of the tower, rendering some worlds more technologically advanced than others. Various monsters come forth from the tower into each world; many are hostile, but some of them are friendly to humans and willing to coexist. An offshoot of the human race (named mutants, espers in the Japanese version) also exists in each world; they are the magic-attuned descendants of a union between humans and the World of Continent's older races.\nThe World of Continent is a large land mass ruled by three kings in constant war for control of their world. They each carry an object needed to open the tower's entrance. The World of Ocean consists of various small islands surrounded by water, each connected by small caves. Pirates roam the sea of this world, forbidding travel by ship. The World of Sky contains large land masses suspended in clouds, and is ruled by a powerful dictator from his flying castle. The World of Ruins is a technologically advanced cityscape, reduced to a post-apocalyptic wasteland by constant monster attacks.\nPlot.\nStanding in front of the tower, the hero and party learn that they cannot climb it to paradise without first unsealing its base door. In the base world, three kings named Armor, Sword, and Shield fight for dominance using pieces of legendary equipment corresponding to their names. Visiting King Armor, the party learns that he is in love with a girl who returns his feelings, but cannot marry him, as a bandit holds her village hostage in return for her love. They defeat the bandit, and the king gives them his armor in gratitude. King Sword attacks the heroes, who vanquish him and take the sword. Lastly, King Shield is murdered by his own steward, and after a fight, the party recovers his shield. Restoring the items to a statue of a great hero, they receive the Black Sphere, but are attacked by Gen-bu, one of four fiends controlled by Ashura. They defeat him and use the power of the Sphere to enter the tower.\nThey climb the tower and come to another door; inside lies a world surrounded by large bodies of water. By navigating caves, they find a floating island which allows them to travel around the world by air. They locate an old man, Ryu-O, and solve his riddle to obtain the Airseed, allowing them to breathe underwater and enter the undersea palace. They defeat the second fiend, Sei-ryu, and recover half of the second sphere. Upon returning to Ryu-O, he reveals himself to be the guardian of the other half of the sphere, and the two halves form the Blue Sphere.\nUsing the Blue Sphere to continue up the tower, the party comes to a world of clouds, dominated by Byak-ko and an army of thugs. They learn that Byak-ko recently wiped out an underground resistance movement, except for Millie and Jeanne, the two daughters of its leader. The party temporarily joins Byak-ko's gang to find the girls, and attempt to defend them, but Millie betrays Jeanne and the party is captured. Breaking free, they confront the fiend, who tries to kill Millie; Jeanne takes the blow and dies in her stead. The party defeats the fiend, recovers the White Sphere, and continues their journey.\nThe fourth world is a post-apocalyptic wasteland; Su-Zaku roams the surface defended by an impenetrable forcefield. The party retreats to an abandoned subway for refuge and meets Sayaka, who directs them to the nearest town. There the party is confronted by the leader of a biker gang, So-Cho, but his sister Sayaka intervenes and the two groups agree to work together to defeat Su-Zaku. As they gather the needed parts for a device to deactivate the forcefield, So-Cho sacrifices his life to guide the party through an atomic power plant. Beasts then ambush the town, and Su-Zaku kidnaps Sayaka. The party defeats Su-Zaku, earns the Red Sphere and travels on.\nClimbing the tower, the party discovers the remains of a family that attempted to reach Paradise but failed, and a library suggesting Ashura is controlled by someone else. They encounter him at the top, guarding the final door; he offers each of them control of one of the worlds, but they refuse and defeat him. Before they can pass through the door, a trap drops them to the bottom floor. Encountering the allies they made along their journey, they decide to rescale the tower. As they climb stairs that wrap outside of the tower, they engage each of the fiends revived and defeat them. They find the Creator at the summit, and learn that the fiends and the tower itself are actually part of a game created by him to see heroes defeat evil; for succeeding they would be granted a wish as a reward. Angry at his manipulation, they reject the reward and challenge the Creator, who insists that because he created everything he was allowed to use them as he saw fit. They then attack and defeat the Creator. The heroes then discover a door leading to an unknown location; they consider entering, but decide to return to their own world.\nDevelopment.\n\"The Final Fantasy Legend\" was the first installment of the \"SaGa\" series in Japan and the first Game Boy game produced by Square. Square president Masafumi Miyamoto requested developers create a Game Boy game after he noticed the success of \"Tetris\" and the popularity of the handheld system. Akitoshi Kawazu and partner Koichi Ishii decided that instead of creating a game similar to \"Tetris\", they would produce what they felt customers desired most: a role-playing game.\nSquare's concept for the game was a title that could be completed in six to eight hours, based on the duration of an airplane flight between Narita, Japan and Honolulu, Hawaii. Developers sought to optimize the game for short bursts of gameplay, as if played by a train passenger between stations. Square raised random battle encounter rate relative to its other role playing games, ensuring players would have at least one enemy encounter during short playtime to maintain an interesting experience. \"The Final Fantasy Legend\" was designed to be difficult and feature advanced gameplay, described by Kawazu as the main difference between \"SaGa\" and \"Final Fantasy\". Square implemented several other ideas to distance the games, notably the \"meat\" system to allow players to collect enemy abilities, though these proved difficult to portray at first.\nKawazu took a direct hand in shaping the game's scenario development, working alongside Ishii, Takashi Tokita, and Hiroyuki Ito, who were involved in other Square projects at the time. Ishii and Ito developed the game's world layout and geography as well; Ry\u014dko Tanaka designed the background graphics. Tokita developed character concept art and handled the in-game sprites. The Japanese cover artwork was designed by Katsutoshi Fujioka. The monochrome screen of the Game Boy proved an obstacle, as some graphics such as fire were more difficult to portray without color. As a result, they had to develop a world that \"works in black and white\". Tanaka later revealed that the 2-megabit capacity of contemporary Game Boy cartridges severely limited their designs; the team removed some elements from the finished game to ensure peak performance.\nAudio.\n\"The Final Fantasy Legend\"'s soundtrack was composed by Nobuo Uematsu and consists of sixteen tracks. Uematsu struggled with composition at first, as the Game Boy's sound hardware was different from the Famicom's, featuring a new stereo option, unique waveforms, and only three musical notes. Kawazu wanted the game's music to resemble that of Square's two preceding \"Final Fantasy\" titles, but Uematsu chose to develop new waveforms. The music was severely limited by the Game Boy's technical specifications, having only three note types available.\nSquare has reused several songs from the game (notably the \"Battle\" theme) in later titles and released them on compilation soundtracks. The introductory music, titled \"Prologue\", appeared remixed as the opening for the next two \"SaGa\" games. \"Heartful Tears\" (also known as \"Wipe Your Tears Away\") became a staple for later \"SaGa\" titles, used in five of the games and arranged differently each time. Fifteen tracks were later included in the 1991 two-disc \"All Sounds of SaGa\" soundtrack, encompassing the Game Boy \"SaGa\" series and re-released by Square Enix in December 2004 as \"SaGa Zenkyoku Shu\". The final track of the set, \"Journey's End\", is a synthesizer-arranged version of six of the game's tracks combined into one by Uematsu. In the liner notes for \"All Sounds of SaGa\", Uematsu states he enjoys listening to the track while remembering scenes from the game. The Kanagawa Philharmonic Orchestra played the song in the \"\" concert as part of the \"When Nobuo Uematsu Was Young\" medley, while the \"Main Theme\" was played alongside \"Save the World\" from \"Final Fantasy Legend II\" on July 9, 2011, at the \"Symphonic Odysseys\" concert.\nMerchandise.\nSeveral items of merchandise have been released for the game, including books and telephone cards. Futabasha Publishers Ltd. released a book in February 1990 titled \"Makai Toushi Sa\u00b7Ga\u2014Boukenshatachi no Rekuiemu\" (, Requiem of the Adventurers). Written by Misa Ikeda, the 287-page book was part of Futabasha's Game Boy Adventure series for children, and detailed a hero's trek to the top of the tower to reach Paradise. In August, Square featured the game in \"Final Fantasy Ry\u016bkishi Dan - Knights\" (=, Final Fantasy Dragon Knights), a fan book which consisting of reactions and artworks to the series. The game was one of four titles featured in October 1992 by \"Game Players\" magazine on a video tape named \"Game Player's Gametape for Game Boy Games\", which demonstrated the game and offered a gameplay tutorial.\nVersions and re-releases.\nSquare released the game December 1989 in Japan as \"Makai Toushi Sa\u00b7Ga\" and included a map for the four major worlds in the game; a revised version followed shortly after. Square translated it to English in March 1990, and planned to release it in North America with new artwork as \"The Great Warrior Saga\". Square retitled it \"The Final Fantasy Legend\" before releasing it on September 30, 1990, to tie into the popularity of the \"Final Fantasy\" video game. Developers made slight modifications for this version, such as removing the game's credits and adjusting the longevity of certain weapons. Changes to the text were also made, including the omission of some of Ryu-O's riddles, removal of mention about self-sacrifice and a hint of the Tower's true purpose. Notably, the exchange between the player's party and the Creator, where the latter reveals that he created Asura simply out of boredom, is altered. In 1998, Sunsoft acquired the license to the Game Boy \"Final Fantasy\" games, re-releasing them in North America the same year. Despite advertising compatibility with Nintendo's Game Boy Color handheld, the re-released version featured no enhancements.\nSquare re-released of \"The Final Fantasy Legend\" for Bandai's WonderSwan Color unit; the Japan-exclusive port debuted in March 2002 under the Japanese title. Toshiyuki Itahana redrew the concept art and graphics, and Square added animated cutscenes. Developers also enabled players to see in advance what a monster would transform into before eating meat left behind after battle. The port allowed playthrough of the intact original Game Boy version. Among other changes and additions were gameplay tweaks, a bestiary, and an added feature that allowed players to automatically target an enemy for attack in combat.\nAs of January 2007, Square Enix had renewed their trademark on the Japanese name for the game, and at Square Enix's 2007 Tokyo Game Show in September made a mobile phone port of the WonderSwan version available for play. Square released the game for download in 2007 and 2008 for Japanese i-mode, EZweb and SoftBank Mobile compatible phones. The port removed the bestiary mode and the original Game Boy version of the game, and condensed some of the in-game cutscenes. It added Japanese kanji support and extra shops with new equipment throughout the quest.\nIn 2020, the original version was re-released alongside the other two Game Boy \"SaGa\" titles for the Nintendo Switch. The collection was published worldwide by Square Enix on December 19 under the title \"Collection of SaGa: Final Fantasy Legend\". It was a digital exclusive release, and included English and Japanese text options worldwide. Production began at Square Enix so players could enjoy the original \"SaGa\" trilogy on modern hardware. While Kawazu had earlier plans to bring the originals onto newer hardware, the series' 30th anniversary provided a good opportunity to fulfil his wish.\nThe port included color and resolution options, higher speed options during gameplay, control options that emulated the Game Boy console, a commemorative track created by later composer Kenji Ito, and new artwork by Fujioka. The minor adjustments were done to reflect modern gaming tastes, but otherwise the games were unaltered. The WonderSwan port of the first \"SaGa\" was considered for release, but it was decided to leave it out to focus on the originals. While the titles were rebranded as part of the \"SaGa\" series, their original \"Final Fantasy\" branding was retained as a subtitle to avoid undue confusion for original players. This edition was the first time the Game Boy titles officially released in Europe.\nReception and legacy.\n\"The Final Fantasy Legend\" is Square's first game to sell over a million copies; the Game Boy version alone shipped 1.37 million copies worldwide (1.15 million in Japan) as of March 2003. Square quickly released two sequels for the Game Boy, and marketed subsequent \"SaGa\" games on other video game consoles. The one-eyed monster featured on the Japanese box art later became the series' mascot, appearing in the sequel as a character named \"Mr. S\". Game Freak founder Satoshi Tajiri cited the game's influence behind the Game Boy \"Pok\u00e9mon\" series, stating it gave him the idea that the system could handle more than action games.\nUpon release, \"Makai Toushi Sa\u00b7Ga\" was acclaimed by Japanese critics. In \"Famitsu\", two reviewers complimented that the game really suited the Game Boy, while two wished it was expanded upon and released for the Famicom. It was one of their two highest-rated games of 1989, along with \"Ys I &amp; II\". It entered the \"Famitsu\" Platinum Hall of Fame, being one only seven games up until 1989 to have received a score of at least 35 or above from \"Famitsu\".\nWestern critics gave mostly positive reviews upon its initial release. Author Jeff Rovin heavily praised the title in the book \"How to Win at Game Boy Games\", citing the thorough manual and considering the game a \"masterful achievement for the Game Boy unit, and a superlative game of [its] kind\", though not as complex as \"The Legend of Zelda\". In May 1991, \"Nintendo Power\" named the game the third all-around best Game Boy game of the previous year, and in September 1997 they ranked it 70th on their list of the \"Top 100\" games to appear on a Nintendo system, stating that it had \"stayed true to the Square Soft tradition\". The \"Chicago Tribune\" in 1991 called the game \"a little slow in spots, but, like \"Final Fantasy\", worth your patience\", and a \"good quest\". The newspaper gave the game ratings of 8 out of 10 and 7 out of 10. German gaming magazine \"Power Play\u200a\" wrote that they had been waiting for a portable role-playing game and found it unbelievable that the programmers managed to get so much in a game style that was normally only found on large home computers. He found that the combat system did not have the depth of an \"Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" game, but hardly found that to be a serious problem.\nThe Game Boy version of the game received mixed reviews in retrospective. \"IGN\" called \"The Final Fantasy Legend\" a \"compelling RPG with a complex gameplay system and a solid soundtrack\", but complained about the game's difficulty and \"dated\" graphics. \"Allgame\" praised the title on its merits as a role-playing game, but criticized its high difficulty and lack of a sense of direction. \"1UP\"'s \"Retronauts\" described its gameplay as a successor to \"Final Fantasy II\"'s, though added that the systems involved were not properly refined until its sequel; they further stated that the randomness of the mutant and monster character classes made the game very difficult. Spencer Yip of Siliconera named it as a game he was thankful for playing, citing it as opening his mind to story-based games more so than titles like \"Dragon Quest\", and in part led to the creation of the website.\nTechnoBuffalo's Ron Duwell said that, while it was regarded less favorably than its sequels, its flaws could be worked around and added that there was no such other title to compete like \"The Final Fantasy Legend\". 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish called it one of the \"essential\" games for the Game Boy as well as one of the best of 1989, noting its introduction of new ideas that contrasted the \"Final Fantasy\" series and calling it \"a pretty decent portable RPG in its own right\". \"GameDaily\" named it a definite game for Game Boy alongside the related \"Final Fantasy\" titles, describing it as providing \"hours of role-playing excitement\". Andrew Vanden Bossche described the game as \"unusual\" amongst Japanese roleplaying games, describing its narrative as \"loosely connected experiences rather than the sort of epic narrative the RPG genre is commonly thought of\". As a result, the off-screen deaths of non-player characters felt more \"poignant\" and an example of memento mori. However, he also felt the monster class system as counter-intuitive, as frequently said classes emphasized the point of enemies as \"designed to pose challenges, not overcome them\". \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\", \"Pocket Games\", and GameSpot shared this sentiment; the latter three named it one of the top fifty games for the Game Boy. Along with \"Final Fantasy Adventure\" and the other two \"Final Fantasy Legend\" games, \"Game Informer\" placed as the sixth in their list of the \"Top 25 Game Boy Games of All-Time\" in 1997.\nThe difficulty and significance of the game's final boss, the Creator, has elicited several mentions. \"GamePro\" named him one of the \"47 Most Diabolical Video-Game Villains of All Time\", placing him 37th on the list and adding \"You gotta wonder... how many hit points did the developers give God?\" \"1UP.com\" described the battle as \"epic\", considering it part of a recurring theme of Japanese role-playing games in which characters band together to kill God. Comedian Jackie Kashian referenced the Creator on \"Comedy Central Presents\", describing the game's final battle as \"the worst premise ever of any video game\", and recalling how she still tried for eight months to defeat the boss. Despite the final boss' difficulty, it can be killed easily by the instant-death \"chainsaw\" weapon. In 2009, Square Enix battle planner Nobuyuki Matsuoka paid homage to the fact in the game \"Final Fantasy XIII\", by deliberately giving the title's final boss a similar vulnerability. Square brought back the character as a boss in later SaGa games \"Imperial SaGa Eclipse\" and \"Romancing SaGa Re;univerSe\", the former of which included a line referencing his weakness to the chainsaw.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is a spin-off of the \"Final Fantasy\" series and the first game in the \"Mana\" series. \nOriginally developed under the name \"Gemma Knights\", it features gameplay roughly similar to that of the original \"The Legend of Zelda\", but with the addition of role-playing statistical elements. A remake, \"Sword of Mana\", was released for the Game Boy Advance in 2003, changing the plot and many gameplay aspects. A second remake was released on mobile phones in Japan which improved the graphics and music of the original version. A third remake, \"Adventures of Mana\", was released for iOS, Android, and PlayStation Vita on February 4, 2016.\nThe story follows the hero and the heroine as they attempt to thwart the Dark Lord of Glaive and his sorcerer assistant, Julius, from destroying the Tree of Mana and dooming their world. The game was released with many familiar elements of the \"Final Fantasy\" series, such as chocobos, but these were later changed to feature common enemies and the gameplay style of the \"Mana\" series.\n\"Final Fantasy Adventure\" was met with generally positive reviews at the time of its release. Over the course of time, reviewers have considered it one of the best action adventure games on the Game Boy. The game also spawned an entirely new game series, called the \"Mana\" series, which became a successful video game role-playing franchise. Its sequel, \"Secret of Mana\", was released in 1993. A port for mobile was released on Mobile in Japan in 2006. A port was also released as part of the \"Collection of Mana\" on Nintendo Switch on 2017 and 2019.\nGameplay.\nThe gameplay is similar to the original \"The Legend of Zelda\" for the NES: the world is viewed from a top-down camera angle, it is divided up into many different squares that can fit on the screen, and the main character can move up, down, left, and right across the screen. The player can interact with individuals within towns by gathering information and buying or selling items and equipment. A variety of enemies can be battled on a field screen to gain experience, GP, and items. Within dungeon areas, a number of puzzles may be present and required to be solved in order for the player to advance. The player can also save at any point. A number of weapons can be found throughout the game to maneuver through obstacles such as cutting through trees and thorns.\nThe main character possesses several statistics, including hit points, power, and stamina, which can all increase upon gaining an experience level. Magic spells, which expend the character's MP, can be used to heal oneself or damage enemies. These spells can only be found in certain locations or obtained from other characters at specific plot intervals. In addition, the protagonist has a power gauge that affects his attack strength\u2014the higher the gauge, the stronger his attack will be. The speed at which it fills is directly affected by the character's will level. The gauge will slowly fill up over time, but once the main character attacks, the gauge is emptied. When the gauge is completely filled up and the main character attacks with a weapon, he will perform a special attack.\nOne additional non-player character may occasionally accompany the main character in the story and can perform different activities to aid the main character in his quest. The game introduced the ability to kill townspeople, something that many Japanese role-playing video games of the time lacked.\nPlot.\nThe Hero (named by the player, officially called Sumo) is a prisoner of the Dark Lord. One day, the Hero's friend informs him of the Dark Lord's goals, and he urges him to seek a Knight named Bogard. As the Hero escapes imprisonment, he learns that the Dark Lord is seeking a key to the Mana Sanctuary in order to control the Mana Tree, an energy source that sustains life. The Hero is befriended by the Heroine (named by the player, officially called Fuji) who is also seeking Bogard. The two find Bogard, who recommends they seek out a man named Cibba. During their journey to meet him, the Heroine is kidnapped. With the aid of a mysterious man, she is later rescued by the Hero. When they meet Cibba, he plays a message left by the Heroine's mother, who reveals she is a descendant of the guardians of the Mana Tree and her pendant is the key to it. The mysterious man, upon discovering that the heroine holds the pendant, reveals himself to be Julius, the Dark Lord's advisor, and kidnaps her. The Hero then attempts to rescue the Heroine, but he fails and is knocked off of Julius's airship. However, the Heroine gives the Hero the pendant just before he falls.\nThe Hero is then reunited with Amanda, an escapee from his prison, who steals the pendant in order to win her brother Lester's freedom. The mayor of Jadd, Davias, takes the pendant, but he transforms Lester into a parrot. The Hero and Amanda confront a Medusa for its tear, which will break the spell. They kill it, but Amanda is infected by the Medusa's attack, causing her to transform into one herself. The Hero reluctantly kills her, and uses her tears to break Lester's spell. Lester avenges Amanda's death by killing Davias, who reveals that he gave the pendant to the Dark Lord. The Hero confronts and defeats the Dark Lord; however, Hero discovers that the Heroine is under Julius' mind control and has opened the entrance to the Mana Tree. Julius reveals he is the last survivor of the Vandole Empire, the empire who attempted to control the Mana Tree years ago, and handily defeats the Hero.\nRealizing he is powerless to defeat Julius, the Hero learns from Cibba about a powerful sword called Excalibur. Cibba helps him find the Excalibur only to find a rusty sword instead. He explains that the rusty sword is the Excalibur and would reveal its true strength to whoever it finds worthy. The Hero then raises Dime Tower to reach the Mana Sanctuary and meets a robot known as Marcie. After reaching the top, the tower begins to collapse and Marcie sacrifices himself by throwing the Hero across. After obtaining and passing the sword's trials, the Hero confronts and defeats Julius at the cost of the Mana Tree's life. The Mana Tree reveals that she is the Heroine's mother and before dying, asks the Heroine to succeed her current position. The Heroine agrees and bids farewell to the Hero as she becomes the next Mana Tree, and the Hero her guardian.\nDevelopment.\nSquare trademarked \"Seiken Densetsu\" in 1987 intending to use it for a game project subtitled \"The Emergence of Excalibur\", and led by Kazuhiko Aoki for the Famicom Disk System. According to early advertisements, the game would consist of an unprecedented five floppy disks, making it one of the largest titles developed for the Famicom up until that point. Although Square solicited pre-orders for the game, Kaoru Moriyama, a former Square employee, affirms that management canceled the ambitious project before it advanced beyond the early planning stages. In October 1987, customers who had placed orders were sent a letter informing them of the cancellation and had their purchases refunded. The letter also suggested to consider placing an order on another upcoming Square role-playing game in a similar vein: \"Final Fantasy\".\nAfter the release of the third \"Final Fantasy\" title in 1990, Square offered designer Koichi Ishii to direct a spin-off series game. It began development for the Game Boy under the working title \"Gemma Knights\"; eventually, Square revived the trademarked name and released the game as \"Seiken Densetsu: Final Fantasy Gaiden\". It was later released in Europe as \"Mystic Quest\". Ishii suggested the basis of the game's story, while scenario writer Yoshinori Kitase helped write the game's script. Ishii designed all of the characters himself, while Goro Ohashi was responsible for the development of the game system.\nThe \"Mana\" series, of which \"Final Fantasy Adventure\" was the first game, was the result of Koichi Ishii's desire to create a fictional world. In Ishii's opinion, \"Mana\" is not a series of video games, but rather a world which is illustrated by and can be explored through video games. When working on the series, Koichi Ishii drew inspiration from abstract images from his memories of childhood, as well as films and fantasy books that captivated him as a child. Ishii took care to avoid set conventions, and his influences are correspondingly very wide and non-specific. Nonetheless, among his literary influences, he acknowledges Tove Jansson's \"Moomin\", Lewis Carroll's \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\", and J. R. R. Tolkien's \"Lord of the Rings\".\nMusic.\nThe was released in Japan on July 15, 1991. Most of the tracks were composed by Kenji Ito, while track 16, \"Chocobo Tanjou (Chocobo's Birth)\", is credited to Square composer Nobuo Uematsu. , a set of arranged tracks was also released on September 30 the same year. Both albums were compiled into \"Seiken Densetsu: Final Fantasy Gaiden Sound Collections\", originally released on August 18, 1995. The game's music was included in a 20th anniversary CD compilation of all of the \"Mana\" series games' soundtracks. A second arranged album titled was released on December 10, 1998. The album was compiled by Yu Hong Ishikawa and Kushiro Negishi.\nVersions and merchandise.\nIn 1998, Sunsoft obtained the license for it and re-released it along with the \"Final Fantasy Legend\" games. This version was advertised as having Game Boy Color support, although the release was not enhanced in any way. RPGamer reported in July 2004 that Square Enix was polling die-hard customers, testing the feasibility of porting \"Final Fantasy Adventure\" to the Nintendo DS. GamesRadar listed \"Final Fantasy Adventure\" as one of the titles they wanted in the 3DS Virtual Console.\nThe game received a remake for the Game Boy Advance called \"Sword of Mana\" in 2003. The original version was remade again to mobile phones and released on August 16, 2006, for SoftBank's 3G network. It was later ported onto i-Mode distribution service on November 6 and EZweb distribution service on February 5, 2007. The gameplay of the mobile phone version is closer to the original game's design, but featuring updated graphics and sound, an improved world map, and other minor changes. The characters have been redesigned several times between each remake. A 3D remake, \"Adventures of Mana\", was released in 2016 for PlayStation Vita, Android and iOS. A port of the original game was released with ports of \"Secret of Mana\" and \"Trials of Mana\" as part of the \"Seiken Densetsu Collection\" on June 1, 2017 in Japan and on June 11, 2019 in North America and Europe as \"Collection of Mana\" for the Nintendo Switch.\nTwo guidebooks have been released in Japan: and , each of which contains character illustrations and manga. The guidebooks were released in May and August 1991 respectively.\nOther manga.\n\"Final Fantasy Adventure\" is one of the video games featured in the manga titled \"Rock'n Game Boy\", by Shigeto Ikehara and published by Comic BomBom from October 1989 to December 1991.\nReception.\nAccording to Square's publicity department, the game sold 700,000 units worldwide, with 500,000 of these sold in Japan.\n\"Final Fantasy Adventure\" was featured in \"Nintendo Power\" when it was re-released in the United States. \"IGN\" praised the Game Boy re-release version noting its strong story, graphics, and music. They additionally praised the game's puzzle elements as innovative and drew comparisons to \"\", though noted that its role-playing gameplay did not blend well with its action-oriented nature. \"RPGFan\" also praised the game and called it one of the best RPG titles for Game Boy. \"RPGamer\" praised the game's plot and the characters. \"Nintendojo\" also gave similar praise to the game but noting it being vastly different from other \"Final Fantasy\" titles.\nThe game has been perceived very positively in the years following its initial release. \"GameDaily\" named it alongside the other Game Boy \"Final Fantasy\" titles as definitive games for the system, describing it as providing \"hours of role-playing\" to play. The sentiment was shared by gaming magazine \"Pocket Games\", which ranked the titles together 8th out of the Top 50 games for the Game Boy, stating that every game in the series is a classic with well-written scripts and solid characters. \"Kotaku\" praised the original release of the game as a \"really great action-RPG\". \"1UP.com\" called the game ambitious for its time, writing that it represented an evolution of the overhead perspective action adventure genre. They also rated the game as \"Worth It!\" in terms of buying and enjoying the original game in 2007, and noted it as the origins of the \"Mana\" series' many unique gameplay features. \"GamesRadar\" named it the 13th best Game Boy game ever made, noting that its interesting leveling system and a large number of collectible items made up for a poor English translation. \"Game Informer\" also praised the game's leveling system, though it did call it a \"simplistic\" title in comparison to its sequels.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A spin-off of the \"Final Fantasy\" series of role-playing video games, it was also the first entry in what would become the \"Chocobo\" series. It saw a Japan-only release on December 23, 1997, for PlayStation, and a version was released on March 4, 1999, for WonderSwan. The game was re-released in 2010 on PlayStation Network in Japan as a PSOne Classic.\nThe game's protagonist is a yellow chocobo, a fictional species of bird in the \"Final Fantasy\" universe, named . The player must fight through procedurally generated dungeons, picking up items and battling enemies.\nGameplay.\n\"Chocobo's Mysterious Dungeon\" combines real-time combat with an Active Time Battle (ATB) system reminiscent of a \"Final Fantasy\" game. Attacks have reduced power and accuracy if made before the ATB gauge fills up. The game consists of three dungeons: a 30-level dungeon, a 60-level dungeon, and an infinite dungeon which recycles enemy types every 100 levels.\nDevelopment.\nThe game was produced by Koichi Nakamura, the founder of Chunsoft. It also marks the solo composing debut of Masashi Hamauzu, who prepared both the soundtrack and an arrangement album named \"Coi Vanni Gialli\".\nThe game appeared in a booth at Tokyo Game Show 1997, but did not appear in playable form, only having a complete video presentation of the game on the company's video wall along with \"Front Mission 2\" and \"Front Mission Alternative\". Upon its release, it was bundled with the \"Mysterious Data Disc\", a bonus containing a number of movies from unreleased games and a playable demo of \"Xenogears\". In early 1998, it was still the 10th best-selling game in Japan according to Famitsu.\nReception.\nIn pre-release coverage of the game, \"IGN\" stated that the decision to not show a playable version of the game was \"somewhat bizarre\", but that the title was \"shaping up quite nicely\", saying that while the game was not as flashy as \"Final Fantasy VII\", and lacked any polygonal graphics, it was \"obvious\" that much effort went into designing the game's artwork. They also said that, while there was no word of a US release, they hoped the game would receive one due to the success of \"Final Fantasy VII\".\nIn a post-release review, \"The Elf\" of \"Superjuegos\" magazine stated that, while the game's setting was \"not very attractive\", the gameplay was highly addictive and engaging, with \"beautiful\" magic, funny characters, and attractive cutscenes. He also called the game's music memorable, citing its remixes of classic themes from \"Final Fantasy\". However, ECM of \"GameFan\" had a more negative take, characterizing \"Xenogears\" as \"infinitely better\", while Stephen Frost of \"\" also stated that the game felt \"rushed and [not] very fun\", appending an image of a dead chocobo with the caption \"Ugh. What was Square thinking?\"\nLegacy.\n\"Chocobo's Mysterious Dungeon\" was the first in the \"Mystery Dungeon\" series to surpass one million units sold due to its connection to \"Final Fantasy\" and chocobo protagonist. It was followed by a 1998 sequel, \"Chocobo's Dungeon 2\".

It is the fifth main installment of the \"Final Fantasy\" series. The game begins as a wanderer named Bartz investigates a fallen meteor. There, he encounters several characters, one of whom reveals the danger facing the four Crystals that control the world's elements. These Crystals act as a seal on Exdeath, an evil sorcerer. Bartz and his party must keep the Crystals from being exploited by Exdeath's influence and prevent his resurgence.\nIt has been ported with minor differences to Sony's PlayStation and Nintendo's Game Boy Advance. An original video animation produced in 1994 called \"\" serves as a sequel to the events depicted in the game. It was released for the PlayStation Network on April 6, 2011, in Japan. An enhanced port of the game, with new high-resolution graphics and a touch-based interface, was released for iPhone and iPad on March 28, 2013, for Android on September 25 the same year and for Windows on September 24, 2015. A more enhanced re-release of the game as part of the \"Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster\" series, was released on November 10, 2021 for Android, iOS, and Windows, for Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 on April 19, 2023, and for Xbox Series X/S on September 26, 2024.\n\"Final Fantasy V\" has been praised for the freedom of customization that the player has over the characters, achieved through the greatly expanded Job System. Despite being released only in Japan at the time, the Super Famicom version sold more than two million copies. The PlayStation version has earned \"Greatest Hits\" status, selling more than 350,000 copies.\nGameplay.\n\"Final Fantasy V\" includes many standard role-playing elements as well as renovated features introduced in earlier \"Final Fantasy\" games. Players navigate from a top-down perspective; a traversable overworld connects the various towns, dungeons, and other points of interest. The player can traverse the overworld by foot, Chocobo, hydra-guided ship, wind drake, or airship, depending on the situation. Most towns contain scattered inns for resting, shops for purchasing equipment, and people from whom the player can gain information. The player may also embark on several side quests that become available as the story progresses. Characters grow in strength by gaining experience points from random encounters with monsters on the overworld or in a dungeon. Experience culminates in a \"level up\", in which character attributes such as hit points and magic power increase. A menu-based management system allows the player to equip, heal, and change each character's selected job outside of battle as well as to save the game's progress.\n\"Final Fantasy V\" is the second \"Final Fantasy\" game to use the Active Time Battle (ATB) system, in which time flows continuously for both the player and enemies during combat. This system was first established in \"Final Fantasy IV\", but in that game, there was no way to visibly anticipate which character's turn would come up next. In \"Final Fantasy V\", the player can see which playable character's turn is next in battle, in the form of a time gauge\u2014or \"ATB Bar\"\u2014which fills according to a character's speed. When the selected character's turn arrives, the player can execute one of several commands, such as attacking the enemy with an equipped weapon, using a special ability or item, or changing the character's row position. The ATB mechanic with a gauge, as seen in \"V\", would be used in the four following main titles in the series and remains a staple mechanic of the franchise.\nJob System.\nThe main feature of the gameplay of \"Final Fantasy V\" is the Job System. Players can freely select jobs (also called \"classes\") for their characters to master, allowing each character to gain special abilities and potentially master all 22 jobs (26 in the Game Boy Advance version). Each character begins with only the \"Freelancer\" class; to gain access to new jobs, players must acquire crystal shards. This system is an improved version of the one in \"Final Fantasy III\"; several older jobs were either reused or revamped for \"V\", such as the Black Mage and Thief. The game also introduces several classes to the series, including the Blue Mage, Time Mage, and Mime. Each of these classes has been featured in numerous \"Final Fantasy\" installments since.\nOnce the player gains access to the job system, characters begin to earn a separate form of experience\u2014Ability Points\u2014in conjunction with regular experience points. Characters gain job levels after accumulating AP; as with regular levels, the required amount of experience increases after each job level. AP and job levels do not transfer from class to class. As job levels increase, new skills become available for the character to use in a new form of customization; characters learn job-specific abilities that may be transferred to a new job. For example, a character with the Knight job who has also earned job levels as a Black Mage may set Black Magic as a secondary command, enabling both Black Mage and Knight abilities in battle. The nature of these abilities varies; while some serve as special commands in battle, others may be innate to the class or activated automatically when conditions are met, such as the Thief's \"Caution\" skill, which prevents rear attacks from enemies. This system allows for deeper customization of characters.\nPlot.\nSetting.\nThe backstory of \"Final Fantasy V\" is revealed in phases through cutscenes and interactions with non-playable characters. One millennium before the events of the main story, a powerful mage named Enuo imperiled the world using the power of an evil entity called the \"Void\". The people retaliated by using twelve legendary weapons to vanquish Enuo, but the Void itself could not be destroyed. Consequently, the people split the world's four elemental Crystals into two sets, effectively creating two worlds. The Void then became sealed in a dimensional cleft between the two worlds.\nNearly a thousand years passed without incident, and both worlds prospered due to the powers of their Crystals of Wind, Water, Fire, and Earth. New kingdoms and towns flourished, and travel by ship acted as a critical means of commerce and communication. However, a sinister force was stirring in the second world\u2014ever since the Void incident, malicious demons had been sealed inside a tree in the Great Forest of Moore. The corrupted amalgamation of spirits emerged as Exdeath, the game's primary antagonist. When Exdeath attempted to claim the world for himself, a group of heroes called the \"Four Warriors of Dawn\" (Galuf, Xezat, Dorgann, and Kelger) sealed him within the first world using its Crystals, and peace returned for another thirty years.\nCharacters.\n\"Final Fantasy V\" features five player characters, though only up to four are playable at any given time:\nDuring the story, the player characters encounter many non-player characters. The other Warriors of Dawn, Dorgann Klauser (Bartz's father), Kelger Vlondett, and Xezat Matias Surgate, play important roles. Supporting characters also include engineer Cid Previa, his grandson Mid Previa, and turtle sage Ghido. One of Exdeath's henchmen, Gilgamesh, is a recurring mini-boss in the second half of the game. Gilgamesh has appeared in several \"Final Fantasy\" titles since. All characters concept art was designed by Yoshitaka Amano.\nStory.\nKing Tycoon departs to investigate the weakening of the Wind Crystal at the Wind Shrine. Bartz witnesses a meteor plunge to the planet's surface. He encounters Lenna, King Tycoon's daughter; Galuf, an amnesiac old man; and Faris, a pirate captain. They make their way to the Wind Shrine pursuing Lenna's father. There the shards of the shattered crystal grant them new powers. An image of King Tycoon appears, saying the crystals have chosen the four adventurers as their protectors.\nThe party discovers the crystals make their planet habitable and also seal away Exdeath, an evil sorcerer. The party attempts to save the crystals of Water, Fire, and Earth. Each time, they fail but gain new powers from the crystals' shards. Having been freed, Exdeath defeats the party and returns to his homeworld. King Tycoon, who was controlled by Exdeath to destroy the last crystal, sacrifices himself to save the others.\nGaluf's granddaughter Krile arrives by a meteorite, restoring Galuf's memory completely. He recalls he originated from the same world as Exdeath, and resolves to pursue him back home with Krile, with Bartz, Lenna and Faris traveling there as well.\nOn Galuf's world, Exdeath is already wreaking havoc in pursuit of that world's crystals. The party wins a victory against Exdeath's lieutenant Gilgamesh, but are blown to a distant continent when a magical barrier is activated during their escape. They deactivate the barrier with help from Galuf's allies. The party then travels to Moore Forest in an attempt to protect the world's crystals there. Exdeath deceives them into destroying the crystals' guardians and takes the crystals for himself. Krile arrives to help but is herself trapped by the sorcerer's powers. Galuf saves the others from Exdeath at the cost of his own life. His abilities pass to Krile, who joins the party in his place. The party pursues Exdeath to his castle, where they defeat Gilgamesh again and then Exdeath himself. The crystals shatter, reuniting the split worlds.\nFor a time, it seems Exdeath has been truly destroyed, and the party celebrates in Tycoon. However, a thorn leaps from Krile's palm, manifesting as Exdeath, now resurrected and fully in command of the Void. With it, he removes entire towns and kingdoms from existence, tossing them into an interdimensional rift.\nThe reunification of worlds has opened the pathways to ancient sites where powerful artifacts are hidden. So armed, the party enters the rift. With help from a reformed Gilgamesh, they find Exdeath at the center of the rift seeking the power of the Void. They fight Exdeath, first in his demonic tree form, and then after he transforms into Neo Exdeath, intent on destroying all reality, including himself. The heroes defeat Exdeath and use the crystal shards' power to seal the Void once more and restore the reunified world and its crystals.\nThe game's ending varies based on how many party members are still alive at Neo Exdeath's defeat, detailing the events after the world's resurrection. In the end, the remaining group visits Moore Forest and find that the fallen party members have returned to life.\nDevelopment.\n\"Final Fantasy V\" was directed by \"Final Fantasy\" series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi who, prior to the release of \"Final Fantasy IX\", called it his favorite \"Final Fantasy\" game. The image, and title logo designs were created by series illustrator and image designer Yoshitaka Amano, while the character designs and character sprites were designed by Kazuko Shibuya. The monsters were designed by Tetsuya Nomura. Amano has stated that he counts his depictions of both Faris from \"Final Fantasy V\" and Terra from \"VI\" among his favorite \"Final Fantasy\" designs. The writing of the scenario text was a collaborative effort between Sakaguchi and Yoshinori Kitase. Sakaguchi conceived the plot and was in charge of it, while Kitase tried to include more humor to lighten up the relatively serious story. The Job System was designed by Hiroyuki Ito, who worked on the game as a battle planner alongside Akihiko Matsui. Mode 7 effects were used in the airship sequences, which moving in the airship would cause the planet to rotate on its axis. In total, Square employed a team of 45 people to create the game, and 16 Mbits of space were used to accommodate the sprites, animations, and detailed background. According to \"GamePro\" in a May 1993 issue, the Japanese authorities had asked Square not to release the game during a school day because schoolchildren would skip class to wait in line for the game.\nThe official English translation of \"Final Fantasy V\" began shortly after the release of the Japanese version. The game was to be titled \"Final Fantasy III\" in North America, but the project was abandoned. Square then announced that due to its differing tone and much higher difficulty from the rest of the series, they would be releasing it in North America as a standalone game with a yet-to-be-determined title, rather than part of the \"Final Fantasy\" series. This plan was quickly aborted. Translator Ted Woolsey explained in a 1994 interview, \"[\"Final Fantasy V\" is] just not accessible enough to the average gamer\". Rumors circulated that a second attempt at localization would be made and that the game would be titled \"Final Fantasy Extreme\", but this attempt was also canceled. A third attempt was made to port the game to Windows-based personal computers for North American release by developer Top Dog Software, but this was canceled. Another attempt to port the game to Windows for North America was \"handled by Eidos Interactive\" circa 1998, but it is unclear whether this is the same version Top Dog Software was working on or an actual fourth attempt. The continual canceling of the localization angered fans and led to \"Final Fantasy V\" becoming one of the first games to receive a complete fan translation.\nMusic.\nThe game's soundtrack was composed by Nobuo Uematsu and consists of 56 tracks. A two-disc album was released alongside the game totaling 67 tracks. Uematsu had originally calculated that the game would require more than 100 pieces of music, but he managed to reduce the number to 56. The song \"Dear Friends\" would become the title piece in the 2004 concert tour \"Dear Friends -Music from Final Fantasy-\", chosen to reflect Uematsu's appreciation for his music's worldwide fan support. The song \"Clash on the Big Bridge\" would later be arranged by Hitoshi Sakimoto for the \"Final Fantasy XII Original Soundtrack\" in 2006.\nThe album \"Final Fantasy V: 5+1\" was released in 1992 and contained five songs from the original score as well as a previously unreleased Super Famicom version of \"Matoya's Cave\" from the original 1987 \"Final Fantasy\" for the Nintendo Entertainment System. A collection of arranged tracks, \"Final Fantasy V Dear Friends\"; a 13-track disc, \"Piano Collections Final Fantasy V\"; and a short series of remixes, \"Final Fantasy V: Mambo de Chocobo\", were all released in 1993. Finally, many of the original songs were included on the North American \"Final Fantasy Anthology Soundtrack\", together with the two-game compilation.\nPorts and remakes.\n\"Final Fantasy V\" was ported by Tose to the Sony PlayStation and re-released in Japan on March 19, 1998; it was included in the 1999 release of \"Final Fantasy Collection\", alongside \"IV\" and \"VI\". The PlayStation version boasted two new full motion video opening and ending sequences and a \"memo-save\" feature, but the game otherwise remained unchanged. Square released 50,000 limited edition copies of the collection which included a \"Final Fantasy\"-themed alarm clock. In the same year, Square released the PlayStation compilation \"Final Fantasy Anthology\" in North America, which included \"Final Fantasy V\", as well as the PlayStation version of \"VI\". This would mark the first time the game was published outside Japan, nearly seven years after its initial release. As early as July 1998 there was media coverage of a port to the PC by Square Enix Europe (then Eidos Interactive) that was never officially released. Screenshots of the cancelled Eidos version include English dialogue that appears to be based on the North American localization that would not be released until September 1999. In 2002, Square released this version of the game in Europe and Australia, this time alongside \"Final Fantasy IV\". The English version of the game received changes from its original format \u2014 most notably, Faris was given a Cornish \"pirate\" accent and there was a different interpretation of character names, such as the names \"Bartz\" as opposed to \"Butz\" and \"Gill\" as opposed to \"Guido\", the official romanizations in Japan. The port was re-released as part of the \"Final Fantasy 25th Anniversary Ultimate Box\" Japanese package in December 2012.\nFollowing the release of the PlayStation 2, Sony reported that the new system had compatibility issues with the \"Final Fantasy V\" half of \"Final Fantasy Anthology\". The game experienced a bug where if players attempted to save their games, a graphical error would occur. Square then released a statement that only the look of the save screen was corrupted, and saving was still possible, and if players wished, repeatedly going into and out of the save screen would make a normal screen eventually appear. This incompatibility was fixed for the PAL and Greatest Hits releases of \"Final Fantasy Anthology\".\n\"Final Fantasy V\" was ported a second time by Tose to the Nintendo Game Boy Advance as \"Final Fantasy V Advance\", which was released on October 12, 2006, in Japan, November 6 in North America, and April 20, 2007, in Europe. Similar to the Game Boy Advance re-releases of its predecessors, this version features updated graphics, though the changes are very subtle. Additional features include four new jobs (Gladiator, Cannoneer, Necromancer, and Oracle), a new dungeon called \"The Sealed Temple\", and a new optional boss from the backstory of \"Final Fantasy V\", Enuo, which was designed by Tetsuya Nomura, the monster designer of the original game. In addition, the game included a bestiary, a quick save function, music player, and additional equipment in the style of previous Game Boy Advance re-releases. Like the remakes of its predecessors, \"Final Fantasy V Advance\" featured a new English translation.\nThe original version of the game was released on the Virtual Console in Japan in January 2011 for the Wii, in March 2014 for the Wii U and August 2017 for the New 3DS, and the PlayStation version of the game was re-released on the PlayStation Store as a PSOne Classic in Japan and Europe in April 2011 and in North America on November 22.\nIn early 2010s, Square Enix considered developing a remake of \"Final Fantasy V\" for Nintendo DS, but was concerned that the technical issues would prevent it from happening. The Nintendo 3DS was also considered for the remake. An iOS port, which was developed by Matrix Software, was released on March 28, 2013 on the Apple App Store for iOS devices, with an Android release via the Google Play Store on September 26. The game features new high-resolution graphics with sprites designed by Kazuko Shibuya, who did the original game's artwork, new gameplay features such as movement in eight directions and auto-battle, and contains the Sealed Temple and super-boss Enuo from the Game Boy Advance release. In September 2015 the remaster was released on PC via Steam.\nTetsuya Nomura, director of \"Final Fantasy VII Remake\", expressed interest in remaking \"Final Fantasy V\" and \"VI\". Kitase, who produced \"Final Fantasy VII Remake\", also expressed a desire to remake \"Final Fantasy V\".\nA 2D pixel remaster was released in North America for Steam, iOS, and Android on November 10, 2021. Unlike the previous remake, many of the features added in the GameBoy Advance remake are absent from this version. The Pixel Remaster version was later released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox Series X|S in 2023 and 2024 respectively.\nSequel.\nIn 1994, Square released an original video animation sequel to \"Final Fantasy V\", simply titled \"Final Fantasy\". Produced by animation studio Madhouse, the anime was released in four 30-minute VHS tapes in Japan and was set two hundred years after the game. The story focuses on four warriors, one of them the descendant of Bartz, protecting the Wind Crystal from the villain Deathgyunos, who pursues it to achieve godhood. It was localized by Urban Vision in 1998 and released in two VHS volumes for North America under the title \"Final Fantasy: Legend of the Crystals\".\nReception.\nSales.\nWithin a day of its release in Japan, \"Final Fantasy V\" sold about 900,000 cartridges for \u00a5 ($ at the time, or $ adjusted for inflation), selling about 4.5 times as many copies as what \"Final Fantasy IV\" (1991) sold on its first day and close to the 1.3 million sold by \"Dragon Quest V\" (1992) on its first day. \"Final Fantasy V\" topped the Japanese sales charts in December 1992 and January 1993, selling 2 million copies during its first two months of release. It was Japan's fourth multi-million seller released in 1992 (following \"Street Fighter II\", \"Super Mario Kart\", and \"Dragon Quest V\"), and ended the year as the second best-selling game of 1992 in Japan (below \"Dragon Quest V\").\n\"Final Fantasy V\" went on to sell a total of 2.45 million units for the Super Famicom in Japan. It was also a commercial success overseas in South Korea, where it was the second best-selling game of 1992 (below \"Street Fighter II\"). The Japanese Game Boy Advance version has also sold nearly 260,000 copies as of December 2007. \"Final Fantasy Collection\" sold over 400,000 copies in 1999, making it the 31st best selling release of that year in Japan. The North American release of \"Final Fantasy Anthology\" sold 364,000 copies as of 2004.\nCritical response.\nThe original Super Famicom version received a positive critical reception upon release, with \"Famitsu\"'s four reviewers scoring it 34 out of 40, and the first \"GameFan\" Golden Megawards awarding it for Best Import Game and Best Music (Import Game) of 1992. Retrospectively, 1UP's staff wrote that, while the game's story was very weak, the gameplay was \"another story\", heavily praising the job system and the feature to combine abilities from different job classes, and gave it a score of B\u2212. Allgame's retrospective review shared similar sentiments regarding the storyline and job system, adding praise for the addition of hidden events and items for players to search for, giving the game a score of 3.5 out of 5. RPGamer gave it a mixed retrospective review, stating that the game improved on the visual presentation, menu system, and overall field navigation of \"Final Fantasy IV\", but the \"maddeningly high encounter rate\", \"average sound selection\", and \"washed out\" color palette hurt the game's presentation, giving it a score of 5/10.\nCritics gave generally positive to mixed reviews for the \"Anthology\" version of the game. GameSpot praised the job system for being \"one of the series' most in-depth and detailed game systems\", but criticized the game for having \"paper-thin characters\" and a clich\u00e9d plot, augmented by a lack of character development during the game's fetch quests. They went further to say that the translation was poor and overshadowed by the two previous fan efforts. IGN called \"Final Fantasy V\"'s graphics \"dated\" but cited \"incredibly engrossing\" job system as the game's highlight and praised its music. \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" repeated the sentiments towards the job system, adding that while the game suffered from long load times periodically, \"Final Fantasy V\" was the main reason to buy the collection.\nIn comparison, reviews of the Game Boy Advance re-release of the game were mostly positive. GameSpot's review regarded the game more favorably than its PlayStation counterpart, calling it \"better than ever\" and citing the strong localization of the script and extensive special features. They further stated that while the game's characters seemed unlikable and that the plot felt \"predictable or trite\", they felt the game was still more sophisticated than most games at the time, giving the game a score of 8.5. \"Nintendo Power\" wrote that \"while playing \"Final Fantasy V\" is a chore on the PlayStation, it's good fun on the GBA because of the vastly improved translation and new features\", further calling it the \"definitive\" version of one of the series' best titles. IGN gave the game a score of 8.5, calling it a \"must-own\" for the portable system and describing it further as always an \"entertaining and surprisingly deep role-playing game\". 1UP.com said the port of the game from the Super Famicom to the Game Boy Advance was \"rock solid\", and added that while the game's story started off at a slow pace, it gradually improved. The review further praised the addition of features and removal of questionable ones that had been added to the \"Anthology\" version of the game. GameDaily gave the game a score of 7/10, noting that while enjoyable, the high encounter rate, the necessity to constantly engage in battle to gain abilities through the job system, and other aspects made the game feel repetitive at times.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "52770", "revid": "42411631", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52770", "title": "Les Claypool", "text": "American musician (born 1963)\nLeslie Edward Claypool (born September 29, 1963) is an American musician, best known as the founder, lead singer, bassist, and primary songwriter of Primus. Ranked as one of the greatest bassists of all time by \"Rolling Stone\", his unique playing style mixes tapping, flamenco-like strumming, whammy bar bends, and slapping.\nClaypool has been involved in a number of non-Primus projects, including supergroups such as Oysterhead (with Trey Anastasio and Stewart Copeland) and Colonel Claypool's Bucket of Bernie Brains (with Buckethead, Bryan Mantia, and Bernie Worrell) and duos such as Duo de Twang (with Bryan Kehoe) and The Claypool Lennon Delirium (with Sean Lennon). He also fronts the experimental rock projects Colonel Les Claypool's Fearless Flying Frog Brigade and Les Claypool's Fancy Band. He has produced and engineered several of his own releases from Rancho Relaxo, which is his studio in California.\nClaypool appears in the opening titles of the animated comedy series \"South Park\", for which Primus has performed the theme song since its debut in 1997. In 2006, he made his debut as both a filmmaker and author when he wrote and directed the mockumentary \"\" and released the novel \"South of the Pumphouse\".\nEarly life.\nLeslie Edward Claypool was born into a working-class family of car mechanics in Richmond, California, on September 29, 1963. He was raised in El Sobrante, California. He learned to play the bass guitar at age 14, but did not begin a career in music until much later. He attended De Anza High School in Richmond, where he was friends with Kirk Hammett, and worked as a carpenter for several years after graduating from high school.\nCareer.\nEarly career.\nAfter the death of Metallica bassist Cliff Burton in 1986, Metallica guitarist Kirk Hammett reconnected with his high school friend Claypool and asked him to audition as Burton's replacement. In Metallica's episode of the documentary series \"Behind the Music\", Claypool said that he jokingly asked the members of Metallica if they wanted to \"jam on some Isley Brothers tunes\" during the audition, a reference to his lack of experience with Metallica's thrash metal style. He later recalled Hammett giving him a copy of Metallica's 1984 album \"Ride the Lightning\", which he enjoyed, but also stressed he \"wasn't a big metal guy\" and did not realize how popular Metallica had become until he arrived at the audition. He also did not realize at the time that the intro riff of \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" was performed on bass, and thus did not play it during the audition. Metallica frontman James Hetfield said that Claypool was not offered the job because \"he was too good\" and \"should do his own thing\". Claypool responded by admitting that he \"wasn't the right guy\" for the band due to being a self-proclaimed \"weirdo\" and said that Hetfield was just \"being nice\" with his comments.\nPrimus.\nPrimus began as \"Primate\" in the mid-1980s. The band featured Claypool on bass, Todd Huth on guitar, and various drummers (most notably Jay Lane); however, Huth and Lane left shortly thereafter to pursue other projects. Claypool replaced them with guitarist Larry LaLonde and drummer Tim Alexander.\nClaypool is considered to be the leader of the band, as well as the driving force behind its blending of funk with other genres. He frequently utilizes the slap-bass technique prominent in funk music, and is the only member of Primus who comes from a funk background. Because of Claypool's strong funk influence, Primus is often described as \"thrash-funk\" or funk metal, although Claypool dislikes the labels. He said, \"We've been lumped in with the funk metal thing just about everywhere. I guess people just have to categorize you.\nFrom 1989 to 2000, Primus gained significant mainstream airplay, headlining Lollapalooza in 1993 and appearing on \"Late Show with David Letterman\" and \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\" in 1995. They also appeared at Woodstock '94, where they performed their \"Pork Soda\" hit \"My Name Is Mud\" and were pelted with mud by the audience, much to the band's displeasure. It drove Claypool to stop playing telling the audience \"the song's called My Name is Mud, but keep the mud to yourself you son of a bitch\". In 1991, the band was featured in the movie \"Bill &amp; Ted's Bogus Journey\" performing their song \"Tommy the Cat\" live. Claypool and Tom Waits first recorded on each other's records in 1991 and have continued to do so since. In 1997, Primus was asked to play and record the theme song for the animated television show \"South Park\". In 1999, Claypool allowed Activision's use of the song \"Jerry Was a Race Car Driver\" in the popular video game \"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater\". Primus went on hiatus in 2000.\nIn mid-2003, Claypool reunited with former Primus drummer Tim Alexander and guitarist Larry LaLonde to record a DVD/EP called \"Animals Should Not Try to Act Like People\". In October of the same year, the band embarked on a two-month tour in which two sets were performed per show, the second set consisting of their 1991 release \"Sailing the Seas of Cheese\" being performed in its entirety. Primus continued touring into 2004, performing their 1990 release \"Frizzle Fry\" as their second set, as documented on the DVD \"Hallucino-Genetics: Live 2004\".\nOn October 17, 2006, Primus released both their first greatest hits album, \"They Can't All Be Zingers\", and their third DVD, \"Blame It on the Fish\", subtitled \"An Abstract Look at the 2003 Primus Tour De Fromage.\" The band toured in 2006 on their Primus: The Beat a Dead Horse Tour 2006, and played at a small number of festivals in 2008. In 2010, Alexander, who had left the band for the second time due to lack of interest, was replaced by Jay Lane, who had not played with the band since 1988. The band resumed touring after the free \"June 2010 Rehearsal\" was released later that year, and a studio album, \"Green Naugahyde\", was released in 2011.\nIn 2013, Lane left Primus for the second time to focus on his other band RatDog, who were coming off hiatus at the time, and was replaced again by Alexander. Primus' eighth studio album, \"Primus &amp; the Chocolate Factory with the Fungi Ensemble\", a re-imagining of the soundtrack from the 1971 film \"Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory\", was released in October 2014.\nIn 2017, Primus released \"The Desaturating Seven\", an album that is based on a bedtime story published by Italian author Ul de Rico, which is about a group of rainbow eating goblins. They then started a tour with Mastodon through most of 2018.\nIn 2024, Alexander resigned from Primus \"effective immediately,\" seemingly retiring from music due to a \"lost passion to play.\" The band announced plans to continue touring with members from Claypool's other bands and began searching for \"the world's best drummer\" to replace Alexander on X (formerly Twitter).\nSolo work.\nSausage.\nIn 1988 Claypool began a short-lived alternative/funk rock band featuring Todd Huth on guitar and Jay Lane on drums. The group released their first album in April 1994 \"Riddles Are Abound Tonight\" by Prawn Song Records, and did a few short tours and opened for groups such as Helmet, Rollins Band, and Slayer. The band reunited for a show on December 31, 2019, opening for The Claypool Lennon Delirium and have not returned since.\nHoly Mackerel.\nIn 1996, Claypool produced, engineered, and released a solo album, \"Les Claypool and the Holy Mackerel presents\" \"Highball with the Devil\". He is credited with playing bass, and drums as well as vocals on several tracks as well as guitar. Also on the album are Mark \"Mirv\" Haggard, Adam Gates, Jay Lane, Joe Gore, Charlie Hunter, and Henry Rollins. The accompanying tour included Haggard and Gates on guitars with Bryan Mantia on drums. It was announced during the Holy Mackerel tour that Mantia had been chosen to become the next Primus drummer.\nOysterhead.\nIn April 2000, Claypool collaborated with Trey Anastasio (of Phish) and Stewart Copeland (of the Police) to form a supergroup called Oysterhead. Claypool and Anastasio had been looking for an opportunity to collaborate. Each had a mutual interest in playing with Copeland who had been a rock idol of their teen years. Plus, Claypool and Copeland already had an established friendship. Oysterhead were originally intended as a one time performance during Jazz Fest in New Orleans. Though timid of the band's sudden and surprising popularity they decided to record and tour. They released one studio album, \"The Grand Pecking Order\", and toured before disbanding in 2001. They re-united in 2006, at the Bonnaroo Music Festival. In 2016 Les tried to reunite the group, but ended up releasing an album with The Claypool Lennon Delirium. Fortunately they re-united once again in 2020 for two shows at the 1stBank Center in Broomfield, Colorado, with the rest of their tour cut short by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Frog Brigade.\nIn May 2000, Claypool formed Les Claypool's Fearless Flying Frog Brigade, an experimental rock group. He was asked to put together a band for the Mountain Aire Festival in Angels Camp, California. The band \"of the most incredible guys (he) could possibly find\" debuted that Memorial Day weekend and played a number of other festivals including moe.down. Originally he was going to call the band \"Les Claypool's Thunder Brigade\". Claypool said:\nI originally was going to do the two drummer thing with Herb and Jack Irons, so I was gonna call it the Les Claypool Thunder Brigade. Michael Bailey from Bill Graham Presents said to me that it may sound a bit too heavy for the Mountain Aire crowd and to perhaps try something a little different that had to do with the event itself. Since it was home of the Calaveras County Frog Jump... hence the Frog Brigade and then it evolved into Colonel Les Claypool's Fearless Flying Frog Brigade.\nThe Primus hiatus allowed him to return to his musical roots, playing songs by bands such as Pink Floyd, King Crimson, and the Beatles. Claypool has called the Frog Brigade his \"mid-life crisis band\". From a set of October shows recorded at Great American Music Hall in San Francisco, Claypool released two Frog Brigade live albums, one being a cover of Pink Floyd's \"Animals\". The line-up included Todd Huth, Eenor, Jeff Chimenti, Jay Lane, Skerik and Claypool.\nThe Frog Brigade is also noted for Claypool's being accepted into the jam band scene. \"Live Frogs Set 1\" won \"Best Live Album\" at the second annual Jammys. Jay Lane and Jeff Chimenti are both members of Bob Weir's bands Ratdog and Wolf Bros. Claypool performed with the Rat Brigade when opening for Ratdog once in 2000 and again in 2007. The Rat Brigade includes Claypool, drummer Lane and keyboardist Chimenti, with guest appearances by saxophonist Kenny Brooks and Bob Weir.\nClaypool also guested on the Ratdog sets in 2000, 2006 and 2009.\nIn 2002, Claypool released a studio album of the Frog Brigade, \"Purple Onion\". Musicians on multiple tracks for \"Purple Onion\" include Warren Haynes (Gov't Mule) Eenor, Mike Dillon, Skerik, Jay Lane, Ben Barnes, and Sam Bass (Dillon and Skerik were both from Critters Buggin; Barnes and Sam Bass were from Deadweight). The album includes \"Whamola\" which later appeared as a remix for the theme of South Park Season 10.\nC2B3.\nAlso in 2002, Claypool collaborated with guitarist Buckethead, Parliament-Funkadelic/Talking Heads keyboardist Bernie Worrell, and former Primus drummer Bryan Mantia under the name Colonel Claypool's Bucket of Bernie Brains (stylized \"C2B3,\" which is pronounced as \"C Squared, B Cubed\"). Their concerts pushed the improvisational envelope by preparing no material and not rehearsing beforehand. At one of their shows they prepared sandwiches onstage for the audience to eat.\nC2B3 re-united in 2004 to record \"The Big Eyeball in the Sky\", an album with equal parts instrumental and vocal songs. The band began an 18-state https:// of the US on September 24, 2004. Aux TV was dismissive of Claypool's effort, but when the tour arrived in Northern California where Claypool lives the local press gave a very positive review.\nThe album features only one guest, the childlike multi-instrumentalist Gabby La La (noted as Gabby Lang on Les Claypool's Frog Brigade's Purple Onion) on vocals and sitar. She also opened on every show (sometimes to scathingly negative reviews) during the 2004 tour as a solo act, and sometimes with members of C2B3. Claypool also produced and performed on Gabby La La's first album, \"Be Careful What You Wish For...\". Gabby La La is the first artist Les has signed to his label since Charlie Hunter in 1993. He has performed select shows with her (including the 2005 Bonnaroo Music Festival) and added her to his then new touring band, Les Claypool &amp; His Fancy Band. The 2005 Fancy Band line-up also included Skerik, Dillon and Lane.\nAt the end of 2005, Claypool released \"5 Gallons of Diesel\", a video retrospective of all of his work away from Primus.\n2006.\n\"Of Whales and Woe\" and the Fancy Band.\nOn May 30, 2006, Claypool released a solo album, \"Of Whales and Woe\", with guest appearances by Skerik, Mike Dillon, and Gabby La La. The album includes the song \"Robot Chicken\", which is the theme song of the show of the same name that airs on Adult Swim. His son Cage and his daughter Lena make a special appearance on the song \"Back Off Turkey\". The release was followed by a tour of the U.S. with the following lineup:\nThe lineup is called Les Claypool's Fancy Band and did national tours in both 2006 and 2007. A live DVD, \"Fancy\", was recorded from the 2006 tour and released in 2007. The audio track includes a mix of both soundboard and taper recordings. A song from the album, \"One Better\", was used in in a fight scene between Preston Lacy and Lee Majors.\n2007\u20132016.\nBesides touring in the summer of 2007 nationally with the Fancy Band, Claypool performed that October with a version of the band, dubbed the Fancy Trio. The trio consisted of Claypool, Skerik on saxophone, and Mike Dillon on drums, vibraphone and percussion. They played at The Echo Project, an inaugural ecologically minded 3-day festival in Fairburn, Georgia on the Boukeart family farm. The set was similar to that of the Fancy Band's tours, culling from Claypool' solo and Frog Brigade albums, as well containing a cover of \"One Step Beyond\" by Prince Buster and teases of other songs, including several Primus tunes, throughout their improvisational jams.\nFor many years Claypool has done a New Year's Eve show at The Fillmore in San Francisco. More recently the New Year's Eve show has been an annual New Year's Eve Hatter's Ball featuring a hat contest. December 31, 2007 was the 3rd such annual event.\nIn 2008, a United States tour spanned from February 29 to April 5. It kicked off at the Neighborhood Theatre in Charlotte, North Carolina and ended at The Warfield in San Francisco. The 2008 tour was a quartet featuring Claypool, Dillon, Skerik and Baldi.\nDuring the year Claypool also performed several shows with Primus at festivals across America and Canada.\"Pig Hunt\" is a film directed by James Isaac released in 2008. Claypool contributes previously unreleased material and plays the role of \"The Preacher\". He composed several songs for the Wii game \"Mushroom Men\", released in December 2008.\nOn December 31, 2008, Claypool rang in the New Year with his annual New Year's Eve show. It was at the San Francisco Opera House with Zappa Plays Zappa sharing the bill and playing first.\nClaypool was also a judge for the 7th annual Independent Music Awards. His contributions helped assist upcoming independent artists' careers. His second solo album, \"Of Fungi and Foe\", was released on March 17, 2009. The album consists of expanded material of the music from the \"Mushroom Men\" game, as well as the \"Pig Hunt\" motion picture, and features a guest appearance by Gogol Bordello's Eugene Hutz.\nIn 2009, Claypool toured with Matisyahu, performing as a 'double-feature' set, as well as appearing together on stage. On March 28, 2010, Claypool performed a rendition of Rush's \"The Spirit of Radio\" for their induction into the Canadian Songwriter's Hall of Fame.\nFrom May 2010 to July 2013, Claypool toured extensively with Primus, alongside Larry LaLonde, and the return of former Primus drummer, Jay Lane. On September 6, 2012, a new side project was revealed as an acoustic band called Duo de Twang. Featuring Claypool and originally Marc Haggard. After two shows, Haggard was replaced with Bryan Kehoe. Both guitarists play together in the associated band M.I.R.V.\nOn September 25, 2013, it was announced Lane had left Primus to rejoin the Bob Weir group RatDog. Tim Alexander was named as his replacement. Claypool and Dean Ween worked together for a reality TV show called Musishermen.\nOn February 4, 2014, Duo de Twang released their debut album \"Four Foot Shack\" and began touring in late February. During the last part of the 2014 Spring Tour, Primus's drummer, Tim Alexander, had a small heart attack rendering him unable to play. Luckily instead of canceling the September shows, they were able to use their close friend Danny Carey as a drummer for the late shows.\nOn January 19, 2016, it was announced that The Claypool Lennon Delirium, a collaboration between Claypool and Sean Lennon, would debut at Bonnaroo 2016. Claypool has spoken fondly of the collaboration, stating, \"Sean is a musical mutant after my own heart. He definitely reflects his genetics \u2013 not just the sensibilities of his dad, but also the abstract perspective and unique approach of his mother. It makes for a glorious freak stew.\"\nOn March 21, 2016, it was announced that the duo would release their debut album, entitled \"Monolith of Phobos\", on June 3, 2016. Their second album, \"South of Reality\", was released February 22, 2019.\nOn May 31, 2016, he was featured on the Death Grips song \"More Than The Fairy\".\nThe Claypool Lennon Delirium.\nIn 2016, Claypool formed a group with Sean Lennon of The Ghost of a Saber Tooth Tiger, Paulo Baldi of Cake, and Jo\u00e3o Nogueira of Stone Giant. Claypool met Lennon in 2015 when he was on tour with Primus, The Ghost of a Saber Tooth Tiger, and Dinosaur Jr. Claypool stayed in touch with Lennon and the group released their first album \"The Monolith Of Phobos\" in 2016. On their first tour they switched out their keyboardist Money Mark of Beastie Boys for Pete Drungle. In 2017, The Delirium returned with their EP \"Lime And Limpid Green\" and released their second album \"South Of Reality\" in 2019, this time with Nogueira on keyboards.\nOther work.\nClaypool was a special guest star in a \"Space Ghost Coast to Coast\" episode with the most celebrities on Cartoon Network in 1996.\nClaypool's first book, \"South of the Pumphouse\", was released on July 1, 2006, by Akashic Books. Copies of the book were sold during his 2006 tour of the U.S. following the release of \"Of Whales and Woe\". The book is a dark tale of brothers, murder, drugs, and fishing; it has been likened to the work of Hunter S. Thompson. Claypool gave his first interview about the book on May 11, 2006.\nAlso in 2006, Claypool wrote and directed the mockumentary film \"\". It was shown at various film festivals and is a spoof of the jam band scene centered on the fake band Electric Apricot, with Claypool also playing the band's drummer and backing vocalist. The band performed real shows in the California area (such as High Sierra Music Festival) for the filming of the movie. During a question and answer session at the Tiburon Film Festival, where the film debuted, he said that the DVD would have an accompanying soundtrack CD. The film has won awards including Best Feature (audience choice) at the Malibu Film Festival. Claypool also said that the band would possibly perform a few select shows, but a tour never transpired as the film's star Adam Gates worked for Pixar, which made touring difficult.\nIn 2007, Claypool created Claypool Cellars, a wine-making project that turned into a boutique business. It makes wine from grapes grown in California's Russian River Valley. The wines are named based on his music, such as \"Purple Pachyderm\" and \"Pink Platypus\". \"Purple Pachyderm\" in particular was co-created alongside Claypool's wife, Chaney.\nArtistry.\nClaypool is well known for his \"quirky and eccentric\" style of bass playing, and is noted for his musical versatility. In addition to the sheer prominence of his bass playing on recorded works throughout his discography, Claypool's style also incorporates several other unusual techniques, such as flamenco-style strumming, tapping, slapping, and guitar-like chording. He has made prominent use of a Kahler \"bass tremolo\" vibrato system, as well as effects such as fuzz boxes and envelope filters. For most of his career, Claypool has played four-stringed basses, but has experimented with extended-range basses, most notably six-stringed models, as heard on songs like \"Jerry Was a Race Car Driver\", which features Claypool tapping the main melody on a fretless six-string bass; Claypool noted he was \"getting more into the six-string\" during the making of \"Pork Soda\", giving the album a heavier edge.\nClaypool has cited Rush and their bassist Geddy Lee, Larry Graham, Chris Squire, Tony Levin, Roger Waters, Paul McCartney, Geezer Butler, Bootsy Collins, Stanley Clarke, John Paul Jones, and the Residents as being musical influences.\nEquipment.\nClaypool has, for a long time, endorsed Carl Thompson basses, but also uses a custom \"Pachyderm\" bass built by luthier Dan Maloney, and an NS Design upright bass. He uses Mesa/Boogie amplifiers, and an extensive set of effect pedals.\nPersonal life.\nClaypool married clothes designer Chaney Smith in December 1995. They reside in Sonoma County, California, and have a son and daughter together.\nClaypool is known for his eccentric personality, surreal sense of humor, cannabis use and his love of wine. His love of wine led him to start the process of opening https:// in Sebastopol, California with his wife Chaney in 2007. They produce high-end wine with the aim of providing the utmost flavor and quality, mainly focusing on Pinot Noir wines and Champagne. The company, whose name is https://, originally released their wine in 2012. Ross Cobb and Katy Wilson were hired as the wine makers at the inception, but Wilson left in 2018 to pursue other ventures. The store and restaurant are open to the public for wine tasting and meals, where Les has a food truck that serves his Whamola Weiners, which are a high-end hotdog.\n\"Les Claypool Day\" was declared by Cincinnati mayor John Cranley on June 12, 2018. It was presented to Claypool during Primus' show that night at the Riverbend Music Center by members of the Cincinnati USA Music Heritage Foundation, alongside Claypool's friend and influence Bootsy Collins.\n1991 \u2013 \"Bill &amp; Ted's Bogus Journey\", features Les Claypool performing with Primus.\n2002 \u2013 \"Rising Low\" (Documentary on Allen Woody, directed by Mike Gordon)\n2002 \u2013 Various Artists \u2013 \"Live from Bonnaroo Music Festival 2002\" (featuring Les Claypool's Frog Brigade and Colonel Claypool's Bucket of Bernie Brains)\n2003 \u2013 Gov't Mule \u2013 \"The Deepest End, Live In Concert\"\n2005 \u2013 Les Claypool \u2013 \"5 Gallons of Diesel\"\n2007 \u2013 Les Claypool \u2013 \"Fancy\"\n2008 \u2013 \"\" (Rock- mockumentary feature film)\n2011 \u2013 \"A Cure for Pain: The Mark Sandman Story\" (documentary on Mark Sandman)\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is a white, water-soluble solid. Cyanide has a high affinity for metals, which leads to the high toxicity of this salt. Its main application, in gold mining, also exploits its high reactivity toward metals. It is a moderately strong base.\nProduction and chemical properties.\nSodium cyanide is produced by treating hydrogen cyanide with sodium hydroxide:\nWorldwide production was estimated at 500,000 tons in the year 2006. Formerly it was prepared by the Castner process involving the reaction of sodium amide with carbon at elevated temperatures.\nThe structure of solid NaCN is related to that of sodium chloride. The anions and cations are each six-coordinate. Potassium cyanide (KCN) adopts a similar structure.\nWhen treated with acid, it forms the toxic gas hydrogen cyanide:\nBecause the salt is derived from a weak acid, sodium cyanide readily reverts to HCN by hydrolysis; the moist solid emits small amounts of hydrogen cyanide, which is thought to smell like bitter almonds (not everyone can smell it\u2014the ability thereof is due to a genetic trait). Sodium cyanide reacts rapidly with strong acids to release hydrogen cyanide. This dangerous process represents a significant risk associated with cyanide salts. It is detoxified most efficiently with hydrogen peroxide () to produce sodium cyanate (NaOCN) and water:\nApplications.\nCyanide mining.\nGold cyanidation (also known as the cyanide process) is the dominant technique for extracting gold, much of which is obtained from low-grade ore. More than 70% of cyanide consumption globally is used for this purpose. The application exploits the high affinity of gold(I) for cyanide, which induces gold metal to oxidize and dissolve in the presence of air (oxygen) and water, producing the salt sodium dicyanoaurate (or sodium gold cyanide) ():\nA similar process uses potassium cyanide (KCN, a close relative of sodium cyanide) to produce potassium dicyanoaurate ().\nThese soluble forms of gold (and silver) can be converted back to the metals by electrolysis.\nChemical feedstock.\nSome commercially significant chemicals are derived from cyanide: cyanuric chloride, cyanogen chloride, and cyanogen. \nSeveral specialty nitriles may be produced by alkylation of cyanide, a strong nucleophile. Illustrative is the synthesis of benzyl cyanide by the reaction of benzyl chloride and sodium cyanide:\nElectroplating.\nCyanide baths (solutions) of metal ions are used to electroplate many metals, including platinum, gold, and silver. Cadmium plating gives excellent corrosion resistance and is achieved using cadmium oxide and sodium cyanide. Copper 'strikes' (thin high quality layers) are traditionally formed using cyanide electroplating, these thin interstitial layers allow adhesion between metals that are usually incompatible, such as chromium and aluminium.\nNiche uses.\nBeing highly toxic, sodium cyanide is used to kill or stun rapidly such as in collecting jars used by entomologists and in widely illegal cyanide fishing.\nIt was used as an insecticide, rodenticide and antibacterial, but these uses were cancelled by the EPA in 1987.\nToxicity.\nSodium cyanide, like other soluble cyanide salts, is among the most rapidly acting of all known poisons. NaCN is a potent inhibitor of cellular respiration, acting on mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase and hence blocking electron transport. This results in decreased oxidative metabolism and oxygen utilization. Lactic acidosis then occurs as a consequence of anaerobic metabolism. An oral dosage as small as 200\u2013300\u00a0mg can be fatal.\nDisposal.\nDue to toxicity considerations, the disposal of cyanide is subject to stringent regulations. Industrial cyanide effluent is typically destroyed by oxidation using peroxysulfuric acid, hydrogen peroxide, sulfur dioxide/copper salts (\"Inco process\") or all three (\"Combiox Process\"). Use of sodium hypochlorite, traditional for laboratory-scale wastes, is impractical on a commercial scale. Hydrolysis at higher temperatures is highly effective, but requires specialized equipment. Lastly, cyanide wastes can be acidified for recovery of hydrogen cyanide.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The group comprises Bono (lead vocals), the Edge (lead guitar, keyboards, and vocals), Adam Clayton (bass guitar), and Larry Mullen Jr. (drums and percussion). Initially rooted in post-punk, U2's musical style has evolved throughout their career, yet has maintained an anthemic quality built on Bono's expressive vocals and the Edge's chiming, effects-based guitar sounds. Bono's lyrics, often embellished with spiritual imagery, focus on personal and sociopolitical themes. Popular for their live performances, the group have staged several elaborate tours over their career.\nThe band was formed when the members were teenaged pupils of Mount Temple Comprehensive School and had limited musical proficiency. Within four years, they signed with Island Records and released their debut album, \"Boy\" (1980). Works such as their first UK number-one album, \"War\" (1983), and singles \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\" and \"Pride (In the Name of Love)\" helped establish U2's reputation as a politically and socially conscious group. Their fourth album, \"The Unforgettable Fire\" (1984), was their first collaboration with producers Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois, whose influence resulted in a more abstract, ambient sound for the band. By the mid-1980s, U2 had become renowned globally for their live act, highlighted by their performance at Live Aid in 1985. Their fifth album, \"The Joshua Tree\" (1987), made them international stars and was their greatest critical and commercial success. One of the world's best-selling albums with 25 million copies sold, it yielded the group's only number-one singles in the US: \"With or Without You\" and \"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\".\nFacing creative stagnation and a backlash to their documentary and double album \"Rattle and Hum\" (1988), U2 reinvented themselves in the 1990s. Beginning with their acclaimed seventh album, \"Achtung Baby\" (1991), and the multimedia spectacle of the Zoo TV Tour, the band pursued a new musical direction influenced by alternative, industrial, and electronic dance music, and they embraced a more ironic, flippant image. This experimentation continued on \"Zooropa\" (1993) and concluded after \"Pop\" (1997) and the PopMart Tour, which polarized audiences and critics. The group re-established a more conventional, mainstream sound on \"All That You Can't Leave Behind\" (2000) and \"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\" (2004), which were critical and commercial successes. Sales of subsequent albums declined, but the group remained a popular live act. The U2 360\u00b0 Tour of 2009\u20132011 held records for the most-attended and highest-grossing concert tour until 2019. \"Songs of Innocence\" (2014), the first of two companion albums in the 2010s, was criticised for its pervasive release through the iTunes Store. In 2023, U2 released \"Songs of Surrender\", an album of re-recorded songs, and began the concert residency to inaugurate Sphere in the Las Vegas Valley.\nU2 have released 15 studio albums and are one of the world's best-selling music artists, having sold an estimated 150\u2013170 million records worldwide. Their accolades include 22 Grammy Awards, eight Brit Awards, four Ivor Novello Awards, and two Golden Globe Awards. They were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2004 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2005. According to \"Pollstar\", they were the second-highest-grossing live music artist from 1980 to 2022, earning US$2.13\u00a0billion. \"Rolling Stone\" ranked U2 at number 22 on its list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\". Throughout their career, as a band and as individuals, they have campaigned for human rights and social justice causes, working with organisations and coalitions that include Amnesty International, Jubilee 2000, DATA/the ONE Campaign, Product Red, War Child, and Music Rising.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistory.\nFormation and early years (1976\u20131980).\nIn 1976, Larry Mullen Jr., then a 14-year-old pupil of Mount Temple Comprehensive School in Dublin, Ireland, posted a note on the school's notice board in search of musicians for a new band. For the first practice, which was held on 25\u00a0September in Mullen's kitchen, Mullen played drums and was joined by at least five other people: Paul Hewson (\"Bono Vox\") on lead vocals; David Evans (\"the Edge\") and his older brother Dik Evans on guitar; Adam Clayton, a friend of the Evans brothers, on bass guitar; and Ivan McCormick. Mullen later described it as \"'The Larry Mullen Band' for about ten minutes, then Bono walked in and blew any chance I had of being in charge.\" Peter Martin, a friend of Mullen and McCormick, loaned his guitar and amplifier for the first practice, but he could not play and was quickly phased out; sources differ on whether he was in attendance at the first meeting or not. Within a few weeks, McCormick was also dropped from the group. The remaining five members settled on the name \"Feedback\" for the group because it was one of the few technical terms they knew. Early rehearsals took place in their music teacher's classroom at Mount Temple. Most of their initial material consisted of cover songs, which they admitted was not their forte. The emergence of punk rock, in particular the influence of acts such as the Stranglers, the Jam, the Clash, Buzzcocks, and Sex Pistols, convinced them that musical proficiency was not a prerequisite to success.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWe couldn't believe it. I was completely shocked. We weren't of an age to go out partying as such but I don't think anyone slept that night\u00a0... Really, it was just a great affirmation to win that competition, even though I've no idea how good we were or what the competition was really like. But to win at that point was incredibly important for morale and everyone's belief in the whole project.\n\u00a0\u2014The Edge, on the band's winning a 1978 talent contest in Limerick\nIn April 1977, Feedback played their first gig for a paying audience at St. Fintan's High School. Shortly thereafter, the band changed their name to \"The Hype\". Dik Evans, who was older and by that time attending college, was becoming the odd man out of the group. The other members were leaning towards the idea of a four-piece ensemble. In March 1978, the group changed their name to \"U2\", selecting it from a list of six options suggested by Steve Averill, a punk rock musician with the Radiators from Space and a family friend of Clayton. The band chose U2 for its open-ended interpretations, visual strength on posters, and because it was the name that they disliked the least. Dik Evans officially left the band with a farewell concert at the Presbyterian Hall in Sutton on 4 March. During the show, which featured the group playing cover songs as the Hype, Dik ceremonially walked offstage. The remaining four members returned later in the concert to play original material as U2. Dik joined the Virgin Prunes, a band made up of mutual friends of U2; early on, the Prunes served as U2's default opening act, and the two groups often shared members for live performances to fill in for occasional absences. On 18 March, the four-piece U2 won the \"Pop Group '78\" talent contest sponsored by the \"Evening Press\" and Guinness's Harp Lager as part of Limerick Civic Week. The win was an important milestone and affirmation for the fledgling act. The contest prize consisted of \u00a3 () and a recording session for a demo that would be heard by the record label CBS Ireland. U2's demo tape was recorded at Keystone Studios in Dublin in April 1978, but the results were largely unsuccessful due to their inexperience.\nIrish magazine \"Hot Press\" was influential in shaping U2's future; in addition to being one of their earliest allies, the publication's journalist Bill Graham introduced the band to Paul McGuinness, who agreed to be their manager in mid-1978. With the connections he was making within the music industry, McGuinness booked demo sessions for the group and sought to garner them a record deal. The band continued to build their fanbase with performances across Ireland, the most famous of which were a series of weekend afternoon shows at Dublin's Dandelion Market in mid-1979. \nIn August 1979, U2 recorded demos at Windmill Lane Studios with CBS talent scout Chas de Whalley as producer, marking the first of the band's many recordings at the studio during their career. The following month, three songs from the session were released by CBS in Ireland as the EP \"Three\". It was the group's first chart success, selling all 1,000 copies of its limited edition 12-inch vinyl almost immediately. In December 1979, the band performed in London for their first shows outside Ireland, although they were unable to gain much attention from audiences or critics. On 26 February 1980, their second single, \"Another Day\", was released on the CBS label, again only for the Irish market. The same day, U2 performed at the 2,000-seat National Stadium in Dublin as part of an Irish tour. Despite their gamble of booking a concert in such a large venue, the move paid off. Bill Stewart, an A&amp;R representative for Island Records, was in attendance and offered to sign them to the label. The following month, the band signed a four-year, four-album contract with Island, which included a \u00a3 advance () and \u00a3 in tour support.\n\"Boy\" and \"October\" (1980\u20131982).\nIn May 1980, U2 released \"11 O'Clock Tick Tock\", their first international single and their debut on Island, but it failed to chart. Martin Hannett, who produced the single, was in consideration to produce the band's debut album, \"Boy\", but was replaced with Steve Lillywhite. From July to September 1980, U2 recorded the album at Windmill Lane Studios, drawing from their nearly 40-song repertoire at the time. Lillywhite employed an experimental approach as producer, setting up Mullen's drums in a stairwell and recording overdubs such as smashed bottles and cutlery skimmed against a spinning bicycle wheel. The band found Lillywhite very encouraging and creative; Bono called him \"such a breath of fresh air\", and the Edge said he \"had a great way of pulling the best out of everybody\". The album's lead single, \"A Day Without Me\", was released in August. Although it did not chart, the song was the impetus for the Edge's purchase of a delay effect unit, the Electro-Harmonix Memory Man, which came to define his guitar playing style.\nReleased in October 1980, \"Boy\" received generally positive reviews. Paul Morley of \"NME\" called it \"touching, precocious, full of archaic and modernist conviction\", while Declan Lynch of \"Hot Press\" said he found it \"almost impossible to react negatively to U2's music\". Bono's lyrics reflected on adolescence, innocence, and the passage into adulthood, themes represented on the album cover by a closeup of an adolescent Peter Rowen, the younger brother of Bono's friend Guggi. \"Boy\" peaked at number 52 in the United Kingdom and number 63 in the United States. The album included the band's first songs to receive airplay on US radio, including the single \"I Will Follow\", which reached number 20 on \"Billboard\"'s Top Tracks rock chart. \"Boy\"'s release was followed by the Boy Tour, U2's first tour of continental Europe and the US. Reviewing the band's early live performances, critics complimented their ambition and Bono's exuberance, and found the shows to be illustrative of U2's potential despite lacking polish.\nThe band faced several challenges in writing their second album, \"October.\" On an American leg of the Boy Tour, Bono's briefcase containing in-progress lyrics and musical ideas was lost backstage during a March 1981 performance at a nightclub in Portland, Oregon. The band had limited time to write new music on tour and in July began a two-month recording session at Windmill Lane Studios largely unprepared, forcing Bono to quickly improvise lyrics. Lillywhite, reprising his role as producer, called the sessions \"completely chaotic and mad\". \"October\"'s lead single, \"Fire\", was released in July and was U2's first song to chart in the UK. Despite earning the band an appearance on UK television programme \"Top of the Pops\", the single fell in the charts afterwards. On 16 August 1981, the group opened for Thin Lizzy at the inaugural Slane Concert; the Edge called it one of U2's worst shows. Adding to this period of self-doubt, Bono's, the Edge's, and Mullen's involvement in a Charismatic Christian group in Dublin called the \"Shalom Fellowship\" led them to question the relationship between their religious faith and the lifestyle of a rock band. Bono and the Edge considered quitting U2 due to their perceived spiritual conflicts before deciding to leave Shalom instead.\n\"October\" was released in October 1981 and contained overtly spiritual themes. The album received mixed reviews and limited radio play. It debuted at number 11 in the UK, but sold poorly elsewhere. The single \"Gloria\" was U2's first song to have its music video played on MTV, generating excitement for the band during the October Tour of 1981\u20131982 in markets where the television channel was available. During the tour, U2 met Dutch photographer Anton Corbijn, who became their principal photographer and has had a major influence on their public image. In March 1982, the band played 14 dates as the opening act for the J. Geils Band. U2 were disappointed by their lack of progress by the end of the October Tour. Having run out of money and feeling unsupported by their record label, the group committed to improving; Clayton recalled that \"there was a firm resolve to come out of the box fighting with the next record\".\n\"War\" and \"Under a Blood Red Sky\" (1982\u20131983).\nAfter the October Tour, U2 decamped to a rented cottage in Howth, where they lived, wrote new songs, and rehearsed for their third album, \"War\". Significant musical breakthroughs were achieved by the Edge in August 1982 during a two-week period of independent songwriting, while the other band members holidayed and Bono honeymooned with his wife, Ali. From September to November, the group recorded \"War\" at Windmill Lane Studios. Lillywhite, who had a policy of not working with an artist more than twice, was convinced by the group to return as producer for a third time. The recording sessions featured contributions from violinist Steve Wickham and the female singers of Kid Creole and the Coconuts. For the first time, Mullen played drums to a click track to keep time. After completing the album, U2 played a short tour of Western Europe in December.\n\"War\"'s lead single, \"New Year's Day\", was released in January 1983. It reached number 10 in the UK and became the group's first hit outside Europe; in the US, it received extensive radio coverage and peaked at number 53. Resolving their doubts of the \"October\" period, U2 released \"War\" in February. Critically, the album received favourable reviews, although a few UK reviewers were critical of it. It was the band's first commercial success, debuting at number one in the UK, while reaching number 12 in the US. \"War\"'s sincerity and \"rugged\" guitar were intentionally at odds with the trendier synthpop of the time. Described as a record on which the band \"turned pacifism itself into a crusade\", \"War\" was lyrically more political than their first two records, focusing on the physical and emotional effects of warfare. The album included the protest song \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\", in which Bono lyrically contrasted the events of the 1972 Bloody Sunday shooting with Easter Sunday. Other songs addressed nuclear proliferation (\"Seconds\") and the Polish Solidarity movement (\"New Year's Day\"). \"War\" was U2's first record to feature Corbijn's photography. An adolescent Rowen was again featured on the album cover, with his previously innocent expression replaced by a fearful one.\nOn the subsequent 1983 War Tour of Europe, the US and Japan, the band played progressively larger venues, moving from clubs to halls to arenas. Bono attempted to engage the growing audiences with theatrical, often dangerous antics, climbing scaffolding and lighting rigs and jumping into the audience. The sight of Bono waving a white flag during performances of \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\" became the tour's iconic image. The band played several dates at large European and American music festivals, including a performance at the US Festival on Memorial Day weekend for an audience of 125,000 people. Nearly rained out, the group's 5 June 1983 concert at Red Rocks Amphitheatre was singled out by \"Rolling Stone\" as one of \"50 Moments that Changed the History of Rock and Roll\". The show was recorded for the concert video \"\", and was one of several concerts from the tour captured on their live album \"Under a Blood Red Sky\". The releases received extensive play on MTV and the radio, expanding the band's audience and showcasing their prowess as a live act. During the tour, the group established a new tradition by closing concerts with the \"War\" track \"40\", during which the Edge and Clayton would exchange instruments and the band members would leave the stage one by one as the crowd continued to sing the refrain \"How long to sing this song?\". The War Tour was U2's first profitable tour, grossing about US$.\n\"The Unforgettable Fire\" and Live Aid (1984\u20131985).\nWith their record deal with Island Records coming to an end, U2 signed a more lucrative extension in 1984. They negotiated the return of the copyrights of their songs, an increase in their royalty rate, and a general improvement in terms, at the expense of a larger initial payment.\nFollowing the \"War\" album and tour, U2 feared that they were in danger of becoming another \"shrill\", \"sloganeering arena-rock band\". While they were confident that fans would embrace them as successors to groups like the Who and Led Zeppelin, according to Bono: \"something just didn't feel right. We felt we had more dimension than just the next big anything, we had something unique to offer.\" They sought experimentation for their fourth studio album, \"The Unforgettable Fire\". Clayton said, \"We were looking for something that was a bit more serious, more arty.\" The Edge admired the ambient and \"weird works\" of Brian Eno, who, along with his engineer Daniel Lanois, eventually agreed to produce the record. The decision to hire them was against the wishes of Island Records founder Chris Blackwell, who believed that just when the band were about to achieve the highest levels of success, Eno would \"bury them under a layer of avant-garde nonsense\".\nPartly recorded in Slane Castle, \"The Unforgettable Fire\" was released in October 1984 and marked a major change of style. It was ambient and abstract, and featured a rich, orchestrated sound. Under Lanois' direction, Mullen's drumming became looser, funkier, and more subtle, and Clayton's bass became more subtle. Complementing the album's atmospheric sound, the lyrics were left open to interpretation, providing what the band called a \"very visual feel\". Due to a tight recording schedule, Bono felt songs like \"Bad\" and \"Pride (In the Name of Love)\" were incomplete \"sketches\". The album reached number one in the UK, and was successful in the US. The lead single \"Pride (In the Name of Love)\", written about civil rights movement leader Martin Luther King Jr., was their first song to chart in the US top 40.\nMuch of the Unforgettable Fire Tour moved into indoor arenas as U2 built their audience. The complex textures of the new studio-recorded tracks, such as \"The Unforgettable Fire\" and \"Bad\", was hard to translate to live performances. One solution was programming music sequencers, which the band had previously been reluctant to use but now incorporate into the majority of their performances. Songs on the album had been criticised as being \"unfinished\", \"fuzzy\", and \"unfocused\", but were better received by critics when played on stage. \"Rolling Stone\", which was critical of the album version of \"Bad\", described its live performance as a \"show stopper\".\nIn March 1985, a \"Rolling Stone\" cover story called U2 the \"Band of the '80s\", saying that \"for a growing number of rock &amp; roll fans, U2... has become the band that matters most, maybe even the only band that matters\". On 13 July 1985, the group performed at the Live Aid concert at Wembley Stadium for Ethiopian famine relief, before a crowd of 72,000 fans and a worldwide television audience of 1.5\u00a0billion people. During a 12-minute performance of \"Bad\", Bono climbed down from the stage to embrace and dance with a female fan he had picked out of the crowd, showing a global audience the personal connection that he could make with fans. The performance was a pivotal event in the band's career; \"The Guardian\" cited Live Aid as the moment that made stars of U2, and it included their performance on a list of 50 key events in rock history.\n\"The Joshua Tree\" and \"Rattle and Hum\" (1986\u20131990).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe wild beauty, cultural richness, spiritual vacancy and ferocious violence of America are explored to compelling effect in virtually every aspect of \"The Joshua Tree\"\u2014in the title and the cover art, the blues and country borrowings evident in the music\u00a0... Indeed, Bono says that 'dismantling the mythology of America' is an important part of \"The Joshua Tree\"'s artistic objective.\n\u00a0\u2014Anthony DeCurtis\nFor their fifth album, \"The Joshua Tree\", the band wanted to build on \"The Unforgettable Fire\"'s textures, but instead of experimentation, sought a harder-hitting sound within the limitation of conventional song structures. Realising that \"U2 had no tradition\" and that their knowledge of music from before their childhood was limited, the group delved into American and Irish roots music. Friendships with Bob Dylan, Van Morrison, and Keith Richards motivated Bono to explore blues, folk, and gospel music and to focus on his skills as a songwriter and lyricist. U2 halted the album sessions in June 1986 to play as a headline act on the Conspiracy of Hope benefit concert tour for Amnesty International. Rather than distract the band, the tour invigourated their new material. The following month, Bono travelled to Nicaragua and El Salvador and saw first-hand the distress of peasants affected by political conflicts and US military intervention. The experience became a central influence on their new music.\n\"The Joshua Tree\" was released in March 1987. The album juxtaposes antipathy towards US foreign policy against the group's deep fascination with the country, its open spaces, freedom, and ideals. The band wanted music with a sense of location and a \"cinematic\" quality, and the record draws on imagery created by American writers whose works the band had been reading. \"The Joshua Tree\" was critically acclaimed; Robert Hilburn of the \"Los Angeles Times\" said the album \"confirms on record what this band has been slowly asserting for three years now on stage: U2 is what the Rolling Stones ceased being years ago\u2014the greatest rock and roll band in the world\". The record went to number one in over 20 countries, including the UK where it received a platinum certification in 48 hours and sold 235,000\u00a0copies in its first week, making it the fastest seller in British chart history at the time. In the US, it spent nine consecutive weeks at number one. The album included the hit singles \"With or Without You\", \"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\", and \"Where the Streets Have No Name\", the first two of which became the group's only number-one hits in the US. U2 became the fourth rock band to be featured on the cover of \"Time\" magazine, which called them \"Rock's Hottest Ticket\". The album and its songs received four Grammy Award nominations, winning Album of the Year and Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. Many publications, including \"Rolling Stone\", have cited \"The Joshua Tree\" as one of rock's greatest albums. The Joshua Tree Tour was the first tour on which the band played shows in stadiums alongside smaller arena shows. It was the highest-grossing North American tour of the year with US$ earned at the box office, and globally it grossed US$ from 3.17\u00a0million tickets sold.\nIn October 1988, the group released \"Rattle and Hum\", a double album and theatrically released documentary film that captured the band's experiences with American roots music on the Joshua Tree Tour. The record featured nine studio tracks and six live U2 performances, including recordings at Sun Studio in Memphis and collaborations with Dylan and B.B. King. Intended as a tribute to American music, one \"Rolling Stone\" editor spoke of the album's \"excitement\" and another described it as \"misguided and bombastic\". The film's director, Phil Joanou, described it as \"an overly pretentious look at U2\". The film underperformed at the box office and was withdrawn from theatres after three weeks, having grossed only US$. Despite the criticism, the album sold 14\u00a0million copies and reached number one worldwide. Lead single \"Desire\" became the band's first number-one song in the UK while reaching number three in the US. Most of the album's new material was played on 1989\u20131990's Lovetown Tour, which visited Australasia, Japan, and Europe. They had grown dissatisfied with their live performances; Mullen recalled, \"We were the biggest, but we weren't the best\". With a sense of musical stagnation, Bono hinted at changes to come during a 30 December 1989 concert near the end of the tour; before a hometown crowd in Dublin, he said on stage that it was \"the end of something for U2\" and that they had to \"go away and\u00a0... just dream it all up again\".\n\"Achtung Baby\", Zoo TV, and \"Zooropa\" (1990\u20131993).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBuzzwords on this record were \"trashy, throwaway, dark, sexy,\" and \"industrial\" (all good) and \"earnest, polite, sweet, righteous, rockist\" and \"linear\" (all bad). It was good if a song took you on a journey or made you think your hifi was broken, bad if it reminded you of recording studios or U2\u00a0...\n\u00a0\u2014Brian Eno, on the recording of \"Achtung Baby\"\nStung by the criticism of \"Rattle and Hum\", the band sought to transform themselves musically. Seeking inspiration from German reunification, they began work on their seventh studio album, \"Achtung Baby\", at Berlin's Hansa Studios in October 1990 with producers Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno. The sessions were fraught, as the band argued over their musical direction and the quality of their material. Clayton and Mullen preferred a sound similar to U2's previous work; Bono and the Edge were inspired by European industrial music and electronic dance music and advocated a change. Weeks of tension and slow progress nearly prompted the group to break up until they made a breakthrough with the improvised writing of the song \"One\". They returned to Dublin in 1991, where morale improved and the majority of the album was completed.\n\"Achtung Baby\" was released in November 1991. The album represented a calculated change in musical and thematic style, their most dramatic since \"The Unforgettable Fire\". Sonically, the record incorporated influences from alternative rock, dance, and industrial music, and Bono referred to it as \"four men chopping down the Joshua Tree\". Thematically, it was a more introspective and personal record; it was darker, yet more flippant than the band's previous work. Commercially and critically, it has been one of the band's most successful albums. It produced five hit singles, including \"The Fly\", \"Mysterious Ways\", and \"One\", and was a crucial part of the band's early 1990s reinvention. In 1993, \"Achtung Baby\" won the Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. Like \"The Joshua Tree\", many publications have cited the record as one of rock's greatest.\nLike \"Achtung Baby\", the 1992\u20131993 Zoo TV Tour was a break with the band's past. In contrast to the austere stage setups of previous U2 tours, Zoo TV was an elaborate multimedia event. It satirised the pervasive nature of television and its blurring of news, entertainment, and home shopping by attempting to instill \"sensory overload\" in its audience. The stage featured large video screens that showed visual effects, random video clips from pop culture, and flashing text phrases, along with a lighting system partially made of Trabant cars. U2 were known for their earnest performances in the 1980s, but the Zoo TV performances were intentionally ironic and self-deprecating. Bono performed as several over-the-top characters, including the leather-clad egomaniac \"The Fly\", the greedy televangelist \"Mirror Ball Man\", and the devilish \"MacPhisto\". Prank phone calls were made to US President George H. W. Bush, the United Nations, and others. Live satellite link-ups to war-torn Sarajevo caused controversy. Zoo TV was the highest-grossing North American tour of 1992, earning US$.\nIn June 1993, U2 signed a six-album deal to remain with Island Records/PolyGram. The \"Los Angeles Times\" estimated that the deal was worth US$ to the band, making them the highest-paid rock group ever. The following month, the group released a new album, \"Zooropa\". Quickly recorded during a break in the Zoo TV Tour in early 1993, it expanded on many of the themes from \"Achtung Baby\" and the tour. Initially intended to be an EP, \"Zooropa\" evolved into a full-length LP album. It delved further into electronic, industrial, and dance music. Country musician Johnny Cash sang the lead vocals on the closing track \"The Wanderer\". Most of the songs were played at least once during the 1993 legs of the tour, which visited Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan; half the album's tracks became long-term fixtures in the setlist. \"Zooropa\" reached the top ten in 26 countries, sold 7\u00a0million copies, and won the 1994 Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album, but the band regard it with mixed feelings; the Edge called it \"an interlude\".\nClayton's issues with alcohol came to a head on the final leg of the Zoo TV Tour. After experiencing a blackout, Clayton was unable to perform for the group's 26 November 1993 show in Sydney, which served as the dress rehearsal for a . Bass guitar technician Stuart Morgan filled in for him, the first time a member of U2 had missed a concert since their earliest days. After the incident, Clayton resolved to stop drinking alcohol. The tour concluded the following month in Japan. It earned 5.3\u00a0million in ticket sales and US$ in gross revenues. \"Q\"'s Tom Doyle said in 2002 that Zoo TV was \"the most spectacular rock tour staged by any band\".\nPassengers, \"Pop\", and PopMart (1994\u20131998).\nIn 1995, following a long break, U2 contributed \"Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me\" to the soundtrack album of the film \"Batman Forever\". The song reached number one in Australia and Ireland, number two in the UK, and number 16 in the US. In November, the band released an experimental album called \"Original Soundtracks 1\", a collaboration with Brian Eno, who contributed as a full songwriting partner and performer. Due to his participation and the record's experimental nature, the band released it under the moniker \"Passengers\" to distinguish it from U2's conventional albums. Mullen said of the release: \"There's a thin line between interesting music and self-indulgence. We crossed it on the Passengers record.\" It was commercially unnoticed by U2 standards and it received mixed reviews. The single \"Miss Sarajevo\" (featuring Luciano Pavarotti) was among Bono's favourite U2 songs.\nU2 began work on their next studio album, \"Pop\", in mid-1995, holding recording sessions with Nellee Hooper, Flood, and Howie B. The band mixed the contrasting influences of each producer into their music, in particular Howie B's experiences with electronica and dance music. Mullen was sidelined due to back surgery in November, prompting the other band members to take different approaches to songwriting, such as programming drum loops and playing to samples provided by Howie B. Upon Mullen's return in February 1996, the group began reworking their material but struggled to complete songs, causing them to miss their mid-year deadline to complete the record. The band allowed manager Paul McGuinness to book their 1997\u20131998 PopMart Tour with the album still in progress; Bono called it \"the worst decision U2 ever made\". Rushed to complete the album, the band delayed its release date a second time from late 1996 to March 1997, cutting into tour rehearsal time. Even with the additional recording time, U2 worked up to the last minute to complete songs.\nIn February 1997, the group released \"Pop\"'s lead single, \"Discoth\u00e8que\", a dance-heavy song with a music video in which the band wore Village People costumes. The song reached number one in the UK, Japan, and Canada, but did not chart for long in the US despite debuting at number 10. Within days of the single's release, the group announced the PopMart Tour with a press conference in the lingerie section of a Kmart department store. Tickets went on sale shortly after, but \"Pop\" would not be released until March. The album represented U2's further exploration of nightclub culture, featuring heavy, funky dance rhythms. The record drew favourable reviews. \"Rolling Stone\" stated that U2 had \"defied the odds and made some of the greatest music of their lives\". Other critics felt that the album was a major disappointment. Despite debuting at number one in over 30 countries, \"Pop\" dropped off the charts quickly. Bono admitted that the album \"didn't communicate the way it was intended to\", while the Edge called it a \"compromise project by the end\".\nThe PopMart Tour began in April 1997 and was intended as a satire of consumerism. The stage included a 100-foot-tall (30 m) golden yellow arch reminiscent of the McDonald's logo, a 40-foot-tall (12 m) mirrorball lemon, and a 150-foot-long (46 m) LED video screen, at the time the world's largest. U2's \"big shtick\" failed to satisfy many who were seemingly confused by the band's new kitsch image and the tour's elaborate set. The reduced rehearsal time for the tour affected the quality of early shows, and in some US markets, the band played to half-empty stadiums. On several occasions, the mirrorball lemon from which the band emerged for the encores malfunctioned, trapping them inside. Despite the mixed reviews and difficulties of the tour, Bono considered PopMart to be \"better than Zoo TV aesthetically, and as an art project it is a clearer thought.\" He later explained, \"When that show worked, it was mindblowing.\"\nThe group's 20 September 1997 show in Reggio Emilia was attended by over 150,000 people, which was reported to have set a world record for the largest paying audience for a one-act show. U2 also performed in Sarajevo on 23 September, making them the first major group to stage a concert there following the Bosnian War. Mullen described the show as \"an experience I will never forget for the rest of my life, and if I had to spend 20 years in the band just to play that show, and have done that, I think it would have been worthwhile.\" Bono called the show \"one of the toughest and one of the sweetest nights of my life.\" The tour concluded in March 1998 with gross revenues of US$ and 3.98\u00a0million tickets sold. The following month, U2 appeared on the 200th episode of the animated sitcom \"The Simpsons\", in which Homer Simpson disrupts the band on stage during a PopMart concert. In November 1998, U2 released their first compilation album, \"The Best of 1980\u20131990\", which featured a re-recording of a 1987 B-side, \"Sweetest Thing\", as its single. The album broke a first-week sales record in the US for a greatest hits collection by a group, and \"Sweetest Thing\" topped the singles charts in Ireland and Canada.\n\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\" and Elevation Tour (1998\u20132002).\nFollowing their musical pursuits in the 1990s, U2 sought to simplify their sound; the Edge said that with \"Pop\", the group had \"taken the deconstruction of the rock 'n' roll band format to its absolute 'nth degree\". For their tenth album, \"All That You Can't Leave Behind\", the group wanted to return to their old recording ethos of \"the band in a room playing together\". Reuniting with Eno and Lanois, U2 began working on the album in late 1998. After their experiences with being pressured to complete \"Pop\", the band were content to work without deadlines. With Bono's schedule limited by his commitments to debt relief for Jubilee 2000 and the other band members spending time with their families, the recording sessions lasted until August 2000.\nReleased that October, \"All That You Can't Leave Behind\" was seen by critics as a \"back to basics\" album, on which the group returned to a more mainstream, conventional rock sound. For many of those not won over by the band's forays into dance music, it was considered a return to grace; \"Rolling Stone\" called it U2's \"third masterpiece\" alongside \"The Joshua Tree\" and \"Achtung Baby\". The album debuted at number one in 32 countries and sold 12\u00a0million copies. Its lead single, \"Beautiful Day\", reached number one in Ireland, the UK, Australia, and Canada, and number 21 in the US. The song won Grammy Awards for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, Song of the Year, and Record of the Year. At the awards ceremony, Bono declared that U2 were \"reapplying for the job\u00a0... [of] the best band in the world\". The album's other singles, \"Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of\", \"Elevation\", and \"Walk On\", reached number one in Canada, and charted in the top five in the UK and top ten in Australia.\nThe band's 2001 Elevation Tour started in March, visiting North America and Europe across three legs. For the tour, U2 performed on a scaled-down stage, returning to arenas after nearly a decade of stadium productions. Mirroring the album's themes of \"emotional contact, connection, and communication\", the tour's set was designed to bring the group closer to their fans; a heart-shaped catwalk around the stage encircled many audience members, and festival seating was offered in the US for the first time in the group's history. During the tour, U2 headlined two Slane Concerts in Ireland, playing to crowds of 80,000. Following the September 11 attacks in the US, \"All That You Can't Leave Behind\" found added resonance with American audiences, as the album climbed in the charts and songs such as \"Walk On\" and \"Peace on Earth\" received radio airplay. In October, U2 performed at Madison Square Garden in New York City for the first time since the attacks. Bono and the Edge said these shows were among their most memorable and emotional performances. The Elevation Tour was the top-earning North American tour of 2001 with a gross of US$, the second-highest amount ever at the time for a North American tour. Globally, it grossed US$ from 2.18\u00a0million tickets sold, making it the year's highest-grossing tour overall. \"Spin\" named U2 the \"Band of the Year\" for 2001, saying they had \"schooled bands half their age about what a rock show could really accomplish\".\nOn 3 February 2002, U2 performed during the Super Bowl XXXVI halftime show. In a tribute to those who died in the 11 September attacks, the victims' names were projected onto a backdrop, and at the end, Bono opened his jacket to reveal an American flag in the lining. \"Sports Illustrated\", \"Rolling Stone\", and \"USA Today\" ranked the band's performance as the best halftime show in Super Bowl history. Later that month, U2 received four additional Grammy Awards; \"All That You Can't Leave Behind\" won Best Rock Album, while \"Walk On\" was named Record of the Year, the first time an artist had won the award in consecutive years for songs from the same album. In November 2002, the band released their second compilation, \"The Best of 1990\u20132000\", which featured several remixed 1990s songs and two new tracks, including the single \"Electrical Storm\".\n\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\" and Vertigo Tour (2003\u20132006).\nLooking for a harder-hitting rock sound than that of \"All That You Can't Leave Behind\", U2 began recording their eleventh studio album, \"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\", in February 2003 with producer Chris Thomas. After nine months of work, the band had an album's worth of material ready for release, but they were not satisfied with the results; Mullen said that the songs \"had no magic\". The group subsequently enlisted Steve Lillywhite to take over as producer in Dublin in January 2004. Lillywhite, along with his assistant Jacknife Lee, spent six months with the band reworking songs and encouraging better performances. Several other producers received credits on the album, including Lanois, Eno, Flood, Carl Glanville, and Nellee Hooper; Bono acknowledged that the involvement of multiple producers affected the record's \"sonic cohesion\".\nReleased in November 2004, \"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\" received favourable reviews from critics. The album featured lyrics touching on life, death, love, war, faith, and family. It reached number one in 30 countries, including the US, where first-week sales of 840,000 copies nearly doubled those of \"All That You Can't Leave Behind\", setting a personal best for the band. Overall, it sold 9\u00a0million copies globally. For the album's release, U2 partnered with Apple for several cross-promotions: the first single, \"Vertigo\", was featured in a television advertisement for the company's iPod music player, while a U2-branded iPod and digital box set exclusive to the iTunes Store were released. \"Vertigo\" was an international hit, topping the charts in Ireland and the UK, and reaching number two in Canada and number five in Australia. The song won three Grammy Awards, including one for Best Rock Song. Other singles from the album were also hits; \"Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own\", written as a tribute to Bono's late father, went to number one in the UK and Canada, while \"City of Blinding Lights\" reached number two in both regions. In March 2005, U2 were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by Bruce Springsteen in their first year of eligibility. During his speech, Springsteen said the band had \"beaten [the odds] by continuing to do their finest work and remaining at the top of their game and the charts for 25 years\".\nU2's 2005\u20132006 Vertigo Tour was preceded by several complications. A sudden illness afflicting the Edge's daughter nearly resulted in the tour's cancellation, before the group decided to adjust the tour schedule to accommodate her treatment. Additionally, ticket presales on the band's website were plagued with issues, as subscribing members encountered technical glitches and limited ticket availability, partially due to scalpers exploiting the system. Commencing in March 2005, the Vertigo Tour consisted of arena shows in North America and stadium shows internationally across five legs. The indoor stage replaced the heart-shaped ramp of the Elevation Tour with an elliptical one and featured retractable video curtains around the stage, while the stadium stage used a massive LED video screen. Setlists on tour varied more than in the group's past and included songs they had not played in decades. Like its predecessor, the Vertigo Tour was a commercial success, ranking as the top-earning tour of 2005 with US$ grossed.\nIn February 2006, U2 received five additional Grammy Awards, including Song of the Year for \"Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own\", and Best Rock Album and Album of the Year for \"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\"; the awards made the album and its singles winners in all eight categories in which U2 were nominated, spanning two separate Grammy ceremonies. The group resumed the Vertigo Tour that month with a Latin American leg, on which several shows were filmed for the concert film \"U2 3D\". It was released in theatres nearly two years later, and was the world's first live-action digital 3D film. In March, the band postponed the tour's remaining shows until the end of the year due to the health of the Edge's daughter. On 25 September 2006, U2 and Green Day performed at the Louisiana Superdome prior to an NFL football game, the New Orleans Saints' first home game in the city since Hurricane Katrina. The two bands covered the Skids' song \"The Saints Are Coming\" during the performance and for a benefit single, which reached number one in Australia and throughout Europe. U2 issued an official autobiography, \"U2 by U2\", that month, followed in November by their third compilation album, \"U218 Singles\". The Vertigo Tour concluded in December, having sold 4.6\u00a0million tickets and having earned US$, the second-highest gross ever at the time.\nIn August 2006, the band incorporated its publishing business in the Netherlands following the capping of Irish artists' tax exemption at \u20ac. The Edge stated that businesses often seek to minimise their tax burdens. The move was criticised in the Irish parliament. The band defended themselves, saying approximately 95% of their business took place outside Ireland, that they were taxed globally because of this, and that they were all \"personal investors and employers in the country\". Bono later said, \"I think U2's tax business is our own business and I think it is not just to the letter of the law but to the spirit of the law.\"\n\"No Line on the Horizon\" and U2 360\u00b0 Tour (2006\u20132011).\nRecording for U2's twelfth album, \"No Line on the Horizon\", began with producer Rick Rubin in 2006, but the sessions were short-lived and the material was shelved. In May 2007, the group began new sessions with Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois in Fez, Morocco, involving the producers as full songwriting partners. Intending to write \"future hymns\"\u2014songs that would be played forever\u2014the group spent two weeks recording in a riad and exploring local music. The Edge called it \"a very freeing experience\" that \"reminded [him] in many ways of early on and why [they] got into a band in the first place. Just that joy of playing.\" As recording on the album continued in New York, London, and Dublin, the band scaled back their experimental pursuits, which Eno said \"sounded kind of synthetic\" and were not easily married with the group's sound.\n\"No Line on the Horizon\" was released in February 2009, more than four years after \"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\", the longest gap between albums of the band's career to that point. It received generally positive reviews, including their first five-star \"Rolling Stone\" review, but critics found it was not as experimental as originally billed. The album debuted at number one in over 30 countries, but its sales of 5\u00a0million were seen as a disappointment by U2 standards and it did not contain a hit single. Following the album's release, the band discussed tentative plans for a follow-up record entitled \"Songs of Ascent\". Bono described the project as \"a more meditative album on the theme of pilgrimage\".\nThe group embarked on the U2 360\u00b0 Tour in June 2009. It was their first live venture for Live Nation under a 12-year, US$ (\u00a3) contract signed the year prior. As part of the deal, the company assumed control over U2's touring, merchandising, and official website. The 360\u00b0 Tour concerts featured the band playing stadiums \"in the round\", allowing the audience to surround them on all sides. To accommodate the stage configuration, a large four-legged structure nicknamed \"The Claw\" was built above the stage, with the sound system and a cylindrical, expanding video screen on top of it. At tall, it was the largest stage ever constructed. The tour visited Europe and North America in 2009. On 25 October 2009, U2 set a new US record for single concert attendance for one headline act, performing to 97,014 people at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena. In May 2010, while rehearsing for the next leg of the tour, Bono suffered a herniated disk and severe compression of the sciatic nerve, requiring emergency back surgery. The band were forced to postpone the North American leg of the tour and a headlining performance at the Glastonbury Festival 2010 until the following year. After Bono's recovery, U2 resumed the 360\u00b0 Tour in August 2010 with legs in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand, during which they began to play new, unreleased songs live. By its conclusion in July 2011, U2 360\u00b0 had set records for the highest-grossing concert tour (US$) and most tickets sold for a tour (7.3\u00a0million).\n\"Songs of Innocence\" and Innocence + Experience Tour (2011\u20132015).\nThroughout the 360\u00b0 Tour, the band worked on multiple projects, including a rock album produced by Danger Mouse, a dance record produced by RedOne and will.i.am, and \"Songs of Ascent\". The latter was not completed to their satisfaction, and by December 2011, Clayton admitted it would not come to fruition. The sessions with Danger Mouse formed the foundation of U2's next album, and they worked with him until May 2013 before enlisting the help of producers Paul Epworth, Ryan Tedder, Declan Gaffney, and Flood. The band suspended work on the album late in 2013 to contribute a new song, \"Ordinary Love\", to the film \"\". The track, written in honour of Nelson Mandela, won the 2014 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. In November 2013, U2's manager Paul McGuinness stepped down as part of a deal with Live Nation to acquire his management firm, Principle Management. McGuinness, who had managed the group for over 30 years, was succeeded by Guy Oseary. In February 2014, the single \"Invisible\", debuted in a Super Bowl television advertisement and was made available in the iTunes Store at no cost to launch a partnership with Product Red and Bank of America to fight AIDS. Bono called the track a \"sneak preview\" of their pending record.\nOn 9 September 2014, U2 appeared at an Apple product launch event to make a surprise announcement of their thirteenth studio album, \"Songs of Innocence\". They released it digitally the same day to all iTunes Store customers at no cost, making it available to over 500\u00a0million people in what Apple CEO Tim Cook called \"the largest album release of all time\". Apple reportedly paid Universal Music Group and U2 a lump sum for a five-week exclusivity period in which to distribute the album and spent US$ on a promotional campaign. \"Songs of Innocence\" recalls the group members' youth in Ireland, touching on childhood experiences, loves and losses, while paying tribute to their musical inspirations. Bono described it as \"the most personal album we've written\". The record received mixed reviews and was criticised for its digital release strategy; it was automatically added to users' iTunes accounts, which for many, triggered an unprompted download to their electronic devices. Chris Richards of \"The Washington Post\" called the release \"rock-and-roll as dystopian junk mail\". The group's press tour for the album was interrupted after Bono was seriously injured in a bicycle accident in Central Park on 16 November 2014. He suffered fractures of his shoulder blade, humerus, orbit, and pinky finger, leading to uncertainty that he would ever be able to play guitar again.\nFollowing Bono's recuperation, U2 embarked on the Innocence + Experience Tour in May 2015, visiting arenas in North America and Europe from May to December. The group structured their concerts around a loose autobiographical narrative of \"innocence\" passing into \"experience\", with a fixed set of songs for the first half of each show and a varying second half, separated by an intermission\u2014a first for U2 concerts. The stage spanned the length of the venue floor and had three sections: a rectangular main stage, a smaller circular B-stage, and a connecting walkway. The centrepiece of the set was a double-sided video screen that featured an interior catwalk, allowing the band members to perform amidst the video projections. U2's sound system was moved to the venue ceilings and arranged in an oval array to improve the sound. The tour grossed US$ from 1.29\u00a0million tickets sold. The final date of the tour, one of two Paris shows rescheduled due to the 13 November 2015 attacks in the city, was filmed for the video \"\" and broadcast on the American television network HBO.\n\"The Joshua Tree\" anniversary tours and \"Songs of Experience\" (2016\u20132019).\nIn 2016, U2 worked on their next studio album, \"Songs of Experience\", a companion piece to \"Songs of Innocence\". The group had mostly completed the album and planned to release it that year, but after the shift of global politics in a conservative direction, highlighted by the UK's Brexit referendum and the 2016 US presidential election, they put the record on hold to reassess its tone. The group spent the extra time rewriting lyrics, rearranging and remixing songs, and pursuing different production styles. Further impacting the lyrical direction of the album was a \"brush with mortality\" that Bono experienced; in December 2016, he underwent open-heart surgery due to an aortic aneurysm that formed over time as a result of having a bicuspid aortic valve.\nU2 toured in 2017 to commemorate the 30th anniversary of \"The Joshua Tree\", with each show featuring a performance of the entire album. It was the first time the group toured in promotion of an album from their back catalogue. The Edge cited the same world events that caused the group to delay \"Songs of Experience\" for what he judged to be renewed resonance of \"The Joshua Tree\"'s subject matter and a reason to revisit it. The tour's stage featured a 7.6K video screen measuring that was, according to \"The Guardian\", the largest and highest resolution screen used on a concert tour. The tour included a headlining appearance at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in June. The tour grossed more than US$ from over 2.7\u00a0million tickets sold, making it the highest-grossing tour of the year.\n\"Songs of Experience\" was released on 1 December 2017. Lyrically, the album reflects the \"political and personal apocalypse\" that Bono felt in 2016. The first single, \"You're the Best Thing About Me\", is one of several songs from the record for which Bono wrote the lyrics as letters addressed to people and places closest to his heart. \"Songs of Experience\" received mixed reviews from critics; it was the sixth-best-selling album globally in 2017 with 1.3\u00a0million copies sold.\nIn May 2018, the band embarked on the Experience + Innocence Tour, which consisted of arena shows across North America and Europe. \nIt was a sequel to their 2015 Innocence + Experience Tour, reprising its loose narrative and using a similar stage set. Several enhancements were made, such as a higher resolution and more transparent video screen and the addition of LED panels to the B-stage floor. The band incorporated augmented reality into the shows, releasing a mobile app for concertgoers to use and reviving Bono's demonic stage character MacPhisto from the 1993 Zoo TV Tour with the help of a camera filter. The tour concluded in Berlin in November with total revenues of US$ from 924,000 tickets sold, according to \"Billboard\".\nU2's \"Joshua Tree\" anniversary concert tour visited Oceania and Asia in 2019, their first time playing Australia and New Zealand since the 360\u00b0 Tour in 2010, and their first time performing in South Korea, Singapore, India, and the Philippines. The band released the single \"Ahimsa\" with Indian musician A.R. Rahman to promote their December concert in India. The group's 2019 shows grossed US$ and sold 567,000 tickets, bringing the cumulative totals for their \"Joshua Tree\" anniversary tours to US$ grossed and 3.3\u00a0million tickets sold.\n\"Songs of Surrender\" and concert residency at Sphere (2020\u2013current).\nOver a two-year period during lockdowns for the COVID-19 pandemic, the group worked on \"Songs of Surrender\", an album of re-recorded and reinterpreted versions of 40 songs from their back catalogue. Largely the effort of the Edge and Bono, the album was recorded with collaborators that included Bob Ezrin, Duncan Stewart, Declan Gaffney, and Stjepan Hauser. The reimagined songs feature stripped-down and acoustic arrangements, in different keys and tempos and often with re-written lyrics. The project was conceived as a companion to Bono's memoir \"Surrender: 40 Songs, One Story\".\nIn October 2022, several media outlets reported that U2 were in discussions to sign with Irving Azoff and his son Jeffrey of Full Stop Management, following the end of Guy Oseary's nine-year tenure as the band's manager.\nAfter releasing his memoir in November 2022, Bono embarked on a book tour that month called \"Stories of Surrender\", initially consisting of 14 dates across North America and Europe. During the shows, Bono performed U2 songs in stripped-down arrangements mirroring those from \"Songs of Surrender\". The record was released in March 2023. It was the group's first number-one album in the UK since 2009, but sales quickly tapered off; it charted in the UK for three weeks, and in the US for one week after reaching number five. The album's release coincided with a television documentary film, \"Bono &amp; The Edge: A Sort of Homecoming, With Dave Letterman\", that premiered on Disney+. In April, Bono resumed his \"Stories of Surrender\" book tour with an 11-show residency at the Beacon Theatre in New York City.\nFrom September 2023 to March 2024, U2 staged a 40-date concert residency called to inaugurate Sphere in the Las Vegas Valley. The residency was announced during a Super Bowl LVII television advertisement. Performances were focused on the group's 1991 album \"Achtung Baby\" and leveraged the venue's immersive video and sound capabilities, which include a 16K resolution wraparound LED screen and speakers with beamforming and wave field synthesis technologies. Mullen did not participate in the concerts in order to recuperate from surgery, marking the first time since 1978 that U2 performed without him; Dutch drummer Bram van\u00a0den\u00a0Berg from the band Krezip filled in. Coinciding with the beginning of the residency, the group released the Las Vegas-inspired single \"Atomic City\".\nU2:UV \"Achtung Baby\" Live was highly acclaimed by critics; \"Rolling Stone\"'s Andy Greene called it \"a quantum leap forward for concerts\", and Neil McCormick of \"The Telegraph\" said it would \"change live entertainment forever\". The residency grossed US$ from 663,000 tickets sold, making it the fourth-highest-grossing concert residency of all time. It was filmed for the immersive concert film \"V-U2\", which began screening exclusively at Sphere in September 2024.\nMusical style.\nBono's songwriting exhibits a penchant for social, political, and personal subject matter, while maintaining a grandiosity. The Edge has described U2 as a fundamentally live band. U2's early sound was punk-influenced alternative rock, and the group were associated with the post-punk movement. Their influences included acts such as Television, Siouxsie and the Banshees, and Joy Division, and their resulting sound was described as containing a \"sense of exhilaration\" that resulted from the Edge's \"radiant chords\" and Bono's \"ardent vocals\". According to Bob Stanley, \"U2 rejected post-punk's own rejection of pop as lingua franca, its hunkering down in regional particularity, and its raised finger to populist communication.\" U2 were initially labelled by some critics as neo-psychedelia or psychedelic rock, receiving comparisons to groups such as the Teardrop Explodes, the Psychedelic Furs, and Echo &amp; the Bunnymen from \"Newsday\", \"The Boston Globe\", and the \"Chicago Tribune\".\nU2 developed a melodic sound under the early influence of record producer Steve Lillywhite at a time when they were not known for musical proficiency. Their songs began as minimalistic and uncomplicated instrumentals heard on \"Boy\" and \"October\", before evolving with \"War\" to include aspects of rock anthem, funk, and dance rhythms to become more versatile and aggressive. \"Boy\" and \"War\" were labelled \"muscular and assertive\" by \"Rolling Stone\", influenced in large part by Lillywhite's production. \"The Unforgettable Fire\", which began with the Edge playing more keyboards than guitars, as well as follow-up \"The Joshua Tree\", were produced by Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois. With their influence, both albums achieved a \"diverse texture\". The songs from \"The Joshua Tree\" and \"Rattle and Hum\" placed more emphasis on Lanois-inspired rhythm as they mixed distinct and varied styles of gospel and blues music, which stemmed from the band's fascination with America.\nIn the 1990s, U2 began using synthesisers, distortion, and electronic beats derived from noise music, dance, and hip-hop on \"Achtung Baby\", \"Zooropa\", and \"Pop\". According to Stephen Thomas Erlewine, \"U2 was able to sustain their popularity in the '90s by reinventing themselves as a post-modern, self-consciously ironic dance-inflected pop-rock act, owing equally to the experimentalism of late '70s Bowie and '90s electronic dance and techno\". They have also been called a pop-rock band by biographer Michael Heatley and musicologist Gerry Smyth. The band's 1990s output has been regarded as an art rock phase in commentaries by biographer John Jobling, \"Salon\" journalist Nico Lang, and music critic Jim DeRogatis, as well as in an interview by Bono. \"Time\" magazine's Josh Tyrangiel went further in saying that, \"In the towering period that spanned \"The Joshua Tree\" to \"Zooropa\", U2 made stadium-size art rock with huge melodies that allowed Bono to throw his arms around the world while bending its ear about social justice.\"\nIn the 2000s, U2 returned to more stripped-down rock and pop sounds, with more conventional rhythms and reduced usage of synthesisers and effects, \"reinvent[ing] themselves as a quality pop band\", according to music journalist Chris Charlesworth. U2's music has been regarded as pop in analyses by writers David Hawke, Robert Christgau, and Niall Stokes. In an interview with Stokes for \"Hot Press\", Bono explained the band's struggles in the 1980s among highbrow circles who patronised them for being a successful pop group, leading to their embrace of the term \"pop\" by the 1990s. Reviewing their 2000 album \"All That You Can't Leave Behind\", Christgau remarked that, \"since they'd been calling themselves pop for half of their two-decade run, maybe they'd better sit down and write some catchy songs. So they did.\" Summing up U2's stylistic evolution since \"Boy\", \"Guitar\" journalist Owen Bailey said that they \"have gone on to conquer the world's airwaves and arenas in a number of different incarnations, ranging from earnest, politically charged new-wave flagbearers to wide-eyed art-rock musicologists to purveyors of irony-laden alt-rock and ever onward\", with the Edge remaining \"at the heart of their sound\".\nVocals.\nBono is known for his impassioned vocal style, often delivered in a high register through open-throated belting. He has been classified as a tenor, and according to him has a three-octave vocal range; one analysis found it to span from C\u266f2 to G\u266f5 on studio recordings over the course of his career. He frequently employs \"whoa-oh-oh\" vocalisations in his singing. Rock musician Billie Joe Armstrong of Green Day said: \"He's a physical singer, like the leader of a gospel choir, and he gets lost in the melodic moment. He goes to a place outside himself, especially in front of an audience, when he hits those high notes.\" He added that Bono is \"not afraid to go beyond what he's capable of\".\nIn the early days of U2, Bono unintentionally developed an English vocal accent as a result of him mimicking his musical influences such as Siouxsie and the Banshees. He said that he found his own singing voice after attending a Ramones concert and hearing Joey Ramone sing. Bono's vocal style evolved during the band's exploration of roots music for \"The Joshua Tree\"; \"Spin\" said that he learned to command \"the full whisper-to-shout range of blues mannerisms\". Bono attributed this maturation to \"loosening up\", \"discover[ing] other voices\", and employing more restraint in his singing. For \"Where the Streets Have No Name\", he varied the timbre of his voice extensively and used rubato to vary its timing, while author Susan Fast found \"With or Without You\" to be the first track on which he \"extended his vocal range downward in an appreciable way\".\nBono continued to explore a lower range in the 1990s, using what Fast described as \"breathy and subdued colors\" for \"Achtung Baby\". One technique used on the album is octave doubling, in which his vocals are sung in two different octaves, either simultaneously or alternating between verses and choruses. According to Fast, this technique introduces \"a contrasting lyrical idea and vocal character to deliver it\", leading to both literal and ironic interpretations of Bono's vocals. On tracks such as \"Zoo Station\" and \"The Fly\", his vocals were highly processed, giving them a different emotional feel from his previous work. Bono said that lowering his voice helped him find a new vocal vocabulary, which he felt was limited to \"certain words and tones\" by his tenor voice. His singing on \"Zooropa\" was an even further departure from U2's previous style; throughout the record, Bono \"underplay[ed] his lung power\", according to Jon Pareles, and he also used an operatic falsetto he calls the \"Fat Lady\" voice on the tracks \"Lemon\" and \"Numb\". As he has aged, Bono has continued to evolve his singing, relying more on \"the croon than the belt\", according to \"Rolling Stone\"'s Joe Gross.\nGuitar.\nThe Edge's style of playing guitar is distinguished by his chiming timbres, echoing notes, sparse voicings, and extensive use of effects units. He favours the perfect fifth interval and often plays power chords, which are chords consisting of just the fifth and root notes without the third. This style is not explicitly in a minor or major key, but implies both, creating a musical ambiguity. For these chords, he often plays the same notes on multiple strings, some of which are left open, creating an Irish-influenced drone. Against this drone, he changes other notes to imply a harmony. Among the Edge's signature techniques are playing arpeggios, sixteenth note percussive strumming, and harmonics, the latter of which he described as \"so pure and finely-focused that [they have] the incredible ability to pierce through [their] environment of sound, just like lightning\". His approach to guitar playing is relatively understated and eschews virtuosity in favour of \"atmospherics, subtlety, minimalism, and clever signal processing\". Rather than emulate common playing styles, the Edge is interested in \"tearing up the rule book\" and finding new ways to approach the instrument. He cited guitarists such as Tom Verlaine of Television, John McGeoch, Rory Gallagher, and Patti Smith as some of his strongest influences.\nThe Edge's guitar sound is frequently modulated with a delay set to a dotted eighth note for rhythmic effect. After acquiring his first delay pedal, the Electro-Harmonix Memory Man, he became fascinated with how to use its return echo to \"fill in notes that [he's] not playing, like two guitar players rather than one\". The effect unit became a mainstay in his guitar rig and had a significant impact on the band's creative output. The Edge became known for his extensive use of effects units, and for his meticulous nature in crafting specific sounds and guitar tones from his equipment choices. Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page called him a \"sonic architect\", while Neil McCormick described him as an \"effects maestro\". Critics have variously referred to the Edge's guitar sounds as evoking the image of fighter planes on \"Bullet the Blue Sky\", resembling a \"dentist's drill\" on \"Love Is Blindness\", and resembling an \"airplane turbine\" on \"Mofo\". The Edge said that rather than using effects merely to modify his sound, he uses them to spark ideas during his songwriting process.\nThe Edge developed his playing style during his teenage years, partially as a result of him and Mullen trying to accommodate the \"eccentric\" bass playing of Clayton by being the timekeepers of the band. In their early days, the Edge's only guitar was his 1976 Gibson Explorer Limited Edition, which became a signature of the group. He found the sound of the Explorer's bass strings unsatisfactory and avoided them in his playing early on, resulting in a trebly sound. He said by focusing \"on one area of the fretboard [he] was developing a very stylized way of doing something that someone else would play in a normal way\". His 1964 Vox AC30 \"Top Boost\" amplifier (housed in a 1970s cabinet) is favoured for its \"sparkle\" tone, and is the basis for his sound both in the studio and live. Rather than hold his plectrum with a standard grip, the Edge turns it sideways or upside down to use the dimpled edge against the strings, producing a \"rasping top end\" to his tone.\nRhythm section.\nAs a rhythm section, Mullen and Clayton often play the same patterns, giving U2's music a driving, pulsating beat that serves as a foundation for the Edge's guitar work. For his drumming, Mullen locks into the Edge's guitar playing, while Clayton locks his bass playing into Mullen's drumming. Author Bill Flanagan said that their playing styles perfectly reflected their personalities: \"Larry is right on top of the beat, a bit ahead\u2014as you'd expect from a man who's so ordered and punctual in his life. Adam plays a little behind the beat, waiting till the last moment to slip in, which fits Adam's casual, don't-sweat-it personality.\"\nMullen's drumming style is influenced by his experience in marching bands during his adolescence, which helped contribute to the militaristic beats of songs such as \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\". Flanagan said that he plays \"with a martial rigidity but uses his kit in a way a properly trained drummer would not\"; he tends to transition from the snare drum onto tom-toms positioned on either side of him, contrasting with how they are traditionally used. Mullen occasionally rides a tom-tom the way other drummers would play a cymbal, or rides the hi-hat how others would play a snare. He admitted his bass drum technique is not a strength, as he mostly played the snare in marching bands and did not learn to properly combine the separate drumming elements together on a full kit. As a result, he uses a floor tom to his left to create the effect of a bass drum. He said, \"I couldn't do what most people would consider a normal beat for the song, so I chose alternatives.\" He was heavily influenced by glam rock acts of the 1970s when first learning to play. In the early days of U2, Mullen had what Bono called a \"florid\" drumming style, before he pared down his rhythms. His drumming leaves open space, owing to what \"Modern Drummer\" described as his understanding of \"when to hit and when not to hit\". As he matured as a timekeeper, he developed an excellent sense of rhythm; Eno recounted one occasion when Mullen noticed that his click track had been set incorrectly by six milliseconds. Under the tutelage of Lanois, Mullen learned more about his musical role as the drummer in filling out the band's sound, while Flood helped him learn to play along with electronic elements such as drum machines and samples. His kit has a tambourine mounted on a cymbal stand, which he uses as an accent on certain beats for songs such as \"With or Without You\".\nClayton's style of bass guitar playing is noted for what instructor Patrick Pfeiffer called \"harmonic syncopation\". With this technique, Clayton plays a consistent rhythm that stresses the eighth note of each bar, but he \"anticipates the harmony by shifting the tonality\" before the guitar chords do. This gives the music a feeling of \"forward motion\". In the band's early years, Clayton had no formal musical training, and he generally played simple bass parts in time consisting of steady eighth notes emphasising the roots of chords. Over time, he incorporated influences from Motown and reggae into his playing style, and as he became a better timekeeper, his playing became more melodic. Flanagan said that he \"often plays with the swollen, vibrating bottom sound of a Jamaican dub bassist, covering the most sonic space with the smallest number of notes\". Clayton relies on his own instincts when developing basslines, deciding whether to follow the chord progressions of the guitars or play a counter-melody, and when to play an octave higher or lower. He cites bassists such as Paul Simonon, Bruce Foxton, Peter Hook, Jean-Jacques Burnel, and James Jamerson as major influences on him. Describing his role in the rhythm section, Clayton said, \"Larry's drums have always told me what to play, and then the chords tell me where to go\".\nLyrics and themes.\nU2's lyrics are known for their social and political themes, and often contain Christian and spiritual imagery. Songs such as \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\", \"Silver and Gold\", and \"Mothers of the Disappeared\" were motivated by current events. The first was written about the Troubles in Northern Ireland, while the last was a tribute to COMADRES, the women whose children were killed or forcibly disappeared at the hands of the Salvadoran government during the country's civil war. The song \"Running to Stand Still\" from \"The Joshua Tree\" was inspired by the heroin addiction that was sweeping through Dublin\u2014the lyric \"I see seven towers, but I only see one way out\" references the Ballymun Towers of Dublin's Northside and the imagery throughout the song personifies the struggles of addiction.\nBono's personal conflicts and turmoil inspired songs like \"Mofo\", \"Tomorrow\" and \"Kite\". An emotional yearning or pleading frequently appears as a lyrical theme, in tracks such as \"Yahweh\", \"Peace on Earth\", and \"Please\". Much of U2's songwriting and music is motivated by contemplations of loss and anguish, along with hopefulness and resilience, themes that are central to \"The Joshua Tree\". Some of these lyrical ideas have been amplified by Bono and the band's personal experiences during their youth in Ireland, as well as Bono's campaigning and activism later in his life. U2 have used tours such as Zoo TV and PopMart to caricature social trends, such as media overload and consumerism, respectively.\nWhile the band and its fans often affirm the political nature of their songs, U2's lyrics and music were criticised as apolitical by \"Slate\" in 2002 for their perceived vagueness and \"fuzzy imagery\", and a lack of any specific references to people.\nInfluences.\nThe band cite the Who, the Clash, Television, Ramones, the Beatles, Joy Division, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Elvis Presley, Patti Smith, Kraftwerk, and the Associates as influences. Van Morrison has been cited by Bono as an influence, and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame mentioned his influence on U2. U2 have also worked with or had influential relationships with artists including Johnny Cash, Green Day, Leonard Cohen, Bruce Springsteen, B.B. King, Lou Reed, Bob Dylan and Luciano Pavarotti. Bono said that David Bowie helped him discover the works of Bertolt Brecht, William Burroughs, Springsteen, and Brian Eno.\nActivism and philanthropy.\nSince the early 1980s, the members of U2\u2014as a band and individually\u2014have collaborated with other musicians, artists, celebrities, and politicians to address issues concerning poverty, disease, and social injustice.\nIn 1984, Bono and Clayton participated in Band Aid to raise money for the 1983\u201385 famine in Ethiopia. This initiative produced the hit charity single \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\", the first of several collaborations between U2 and Bob Geldof. In July 1985, U2 performed at Live Aid, a follow-up to Band Aid's efforts. Bono and his wife Ali, invited by World Vision, visited Ethiopia that year where they witnessed the famine first-hand. Bono later said that this laid the groundwork for his Africa campaigning and some of his songwriting. In 1986, U2 participated in the Self Aid benefit concert for unemployment in Ireland and the Conspiracy of Hope benefit concert tour in support of Amnesty International. The same year, Bono and Ali also visited Nicaragua and El Salvador at the invitation of the Sanctuary movement and saw the effects of the Salvadoran Civil War. These 1986 events greatly influenced \"The Joshua Tree\" album, which was being recorded at the time.\nDuring their Zoo TV Tour in 1992, U2 participated in the \"Stop Sellafield\" concert with Greenpeace to protest a nuclear fuel reprocessing plant. Events in Sarajevo during the Bosnian War inspired their song with Brian Eno called \"Miss Sarajevo\", which they debuted at a September 1995 Pavarotti &amp; Friends concert to benefit the War Child charity. U2 fulfilled a 1993 promise to play in Sarajevo during the PopMart Tour in 1997. In May 1998, they performed in Belfast to promote Northern Ireland's referendum over the Good Friday Agreement, which ended the Troubles. During the show, Bono brought Northern Irish political leaders David Trimble and John Hume on stage to shake hands; the referendum ultimately was passed. Later that year, all proceeds from the release of the \"Sweetest Thing\" single went towards supporting the Chernobyl Children's Project.\nThe band dedicated their 2000 song \"Walk On\" to Burma's pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who had been under house arrest since 1989. In late 2003, Bono and the Edge participated in the South Africa HIV/AIDS awareness 46664 series of concerts hosted by Nelson Mandela. In 2005, the band played the Live 8 concert in London, which Geldof helped stage on the 20th anniversary of Live Aid to support the Make Poverty History campaign. The band and manager Paul McGuinness were awarded Amnesty International's Ambassador of Conscience Award for their work in promoting human rights.\nSince 2000, Bono's campaigning has included Jubilee 2000 with Geldof, Muhammad Ali, and others to promote the cancellation of third-world debt during the Great Jubilee. In January 2002, Bono co-founded the multinational NGO DATA, with the aim of improving the social, political, and financial state of Africa. He continued his campaigns for debt and HIV/AIDS relief into June 2002 by making high-profile visits to Africa. Product Red, a for-profit licensed brand seeking to raise money for the Global Fund, was co-founded by Bono in 2006. The ONE Campaign, originally the US counterpart of Make Poverty History, was shaped by his efforts and vision.\nIn November 2005, the Edge and producer Bob Ezrin helped introduce Music Rising, an initiative to replace instruments for musicians in the New Orleans area impacted by Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita. In 2006, U2 collaborated with Green Day to record a remake of the song \"The Saints Are Coming\" by the Skids to benefit Music Rising. A live version of the song recorded at the Louisiana Superdome was released on the single.\nU2 have provided funding for music education on several occasions. In 2010, an education programme for children called Music Generation was established from funds provided by U2 and the Ireland Funds. The band initially gave \u20ac for the programme's creation, followed by donations of \u20ac in 2015 and some of their earnings from their Joshua Tree Tour 2017. The programme provided tuition to 116,000 children in 2023. Following U2's residency at Sphere in the Las Vegas Valley, the University of Nevada, Las Vegas's College of Fine Arts announced in January 2025 that the band had made a donation of $300,000 to the U2:UV Music Scholarship and Experiential Fund for music education.\nIn April 2020, the group donated \u20ac to purchase personal protective equipment for Irish healthcare workers working during the COVID-19 pandemic. The band also donated US$ to ease the impact of the pandemic on the music industry, including a \u20ac donation to the Songs from an Empty Room fundraiser. In January 2025, U2 donated $1\u00a0million to FireAid to benefit those affected by the Southern California wildfires.\nU2 were honoured with the Innovator Award at the 3rd iHeartRadio Music Awards in April 2016 for their \"impact on popular culture and commitment to social causes\". Bono has received many awards for his music and activism, including the Legion of Honour from the French Government in 2003, \"Time\"'s Person of the Year for 2005 (along with Bill Gates and Melinda Gates), and an honorary British knighthood in 2007. Some news sources have questioned the efficacy of Bono's campaign to relieve debt and provide assistance to Africa.\nOther projects and collaborations.\nThe members of U2 have undertaken side projects, sometimes in collaboration with some of their bandmates. In 1985, Bono recorded the song \"In a Lifetime\" with the Irish band Clannad. The Edge recorded a solo soundtrack album for the film \"Captive\", which was released in 1986 and included a vocal performance by Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor on the song \"Heroine\" that predates her own debut album by a year. For Robbie Robertson's 1987 self-titled solo album, U2 performed on the songs \"Sweet Fire of Love\" and \"Testimony\". Bono and the Edge wrote the song \"She's a Mystery to Me\" for Roy Orbison, which was featured on his 1989 album \"Mystery Girl\". In 1990, Bono and the Edge provided the original score to the Royal Shakespeare Company London's . One track, \"Alex Descends into Hell for a Bottle of Milk/Korova 1\", was on the B-side to \"The Fly\" single. That same year, Mullen produced and played drums on \"Put 'Em Under Pressure\", a song for the Ireland national team for the 1990 FIFA World Cup; the song topped the Irish charts for 13 weeks. For the 1995 James Bond film \"GoldenEye\", Bono and the Edge wrote the title song \"GoldenEye\", which was performed by Tina Turner. Clayton and Mullen reworked Lalo Schifrin's \" for the . Bono and the Edge ventured into theatre again by writing the music and lyrics for the Broadway musical \", which opened in June 2011. Bono and the Edge collaborated with Dutch DJ Martin Garrix on the 2021 track \"We Are the People\", which served as the official song of the UEFA Euro 2020 tournament.\nIn addition to collaborating with fellow musicians, U2 have worked with several authors. American author William S. Burroughs had a guest appearance in U2's video for \"Last Night on Earth\" shortly before he died. Video footage of him reading his poem \"Thanksgiving Prayer\" was used during a Zoo TV Tour television special. Other collaborators include Allen Ginsberg and Salman Rushdie. Lyrics from Rushdie's 1999 book \"The Ground Beneath Her Feet\" were adapted by U2 into the song \"The Ground Beneath Her Feet\", which was one of three tracks the group contributed to \"The Million Dollar Hotel\" in 2000.\nIn April 2017, U2 were featured on a Kendrick Lamar song, \"XXX\", from his album \"DAMN\".\nLegacy.\nU2 have sold an estimated 150\u2013170\u00a0million records worldwide, placing them among the best-selling music artists in history. The group's fifth studio album, \"The Joshua Tree\", is one of the best-selling albums in the US (10\u00a0million copies shipped) and worldwide (25\u00a0million copies sold). With 52\u00a0million certified units by the RIAA, U2 rank as the 24th-highest-selling music artist in the US. U2 have eight albums that have reached number one in the US, the third-most of any group. They were the first group to attain number-one albums in the US in the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s. In the UK, the group have had seven number-one singles, tied for the 17th-most of any artist, and eleven number-one albums, tied for the 8th-most of any artist. The band's 1,468 weeks spent on the UK music charts ranks 18th all-time. In their native Ireland, U2 hold the record for most number-one singles with 21, and they have 10 number-one albums.\nIn the 1980s, U2 \"dominated the alternative rock scene\", according to cultural critic Kevin J. H. Dettmar. Similarly, in the next decade, they were one of the most famous alternative rock bands worldwide and among the highest-selling rock bands. In the 35-year history of \"Billboard\"'s Alternative Airplay chart, U2 holds records for most songs charted (42), most number ones in the 1980s (2, tied), and most number ones in the 1990s (6). Record sales declined in the 2000s and the music industry entered an age of often illegal digital downloading, but according to author Mat Snow, U2 prospered more than younger acts because of a loyal following that held an attachment to the album format. Snow said, \"Children of the album era as they were, U2 would never stop regarding the album as the core statement of their creativity\", despite progressively decreasing sales, while he noted that live shows consequently became the group's greatest source of revenue.\nBased on data from \"Pollstar\", U2 were the second-highest-grossing musical act from 1980 to 2022, earning US$ in revenue from 26.178 million tickets sold. According to \"Billboard Boxscore\", the band grossed US$ in ticket sales from 1990 to 2016, second only to the Rolling Stones. U2 were the only group in the top 25 touring acts from 2000 to 2009 to sell out every show they played. According to \"Pollstar\", the band grossed US$ and sold 9,300,500 tickets from 255 shows played between 2010 and November 2019, earning the publication's title of touring artist of the 2010s decade; U2 were the only artist to surpass US$ grossed during that span. \"Forbes\" has named U2 the world's annual highest-earning music artist a record five times. \"The Sunday Times\"' 2020 Irish Rich List estimated the group's collective wealth at \u20ac.\nU2 are regarded as one of the greatest pop-rock acts of all time. \"Rolling Stone\" placed U2 at number 22 on its list of \"The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time\", while ranking Bono the 32nd-greatest singer, the Edge the 38th-greatest guitarist, and Mullen the 96th-greatest drummer. The magazine placed Bono and the Edge at number 35 on its list of the \"100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time\". In 2004, \"Q\" ranked U2 as the fourth-biggest band in a list compiled based on album sales, time spent on the UK charts, and largest audience for a headlining show. VH1 placed U2 at number 19 on its 2010 list of \"The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time\". In 2010, eight of U2's songs appeared on \"Rolling Stone\"'s updated list of \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\", with \"One\" ranking the highest at number 36. Five of the group's twelve studio albums were ranked on the magazine's 2012 list of \"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\"\u2014\"The Joshua Tree\" placed the highest at number 27. Reflecting on the band's popularity and worldwide impact, Jeff Pollack for \"The Huffington Post\" said, \"like the Who before them, U2 wrote songs about things that were important and resonated with their audience\". \"Houston Press\" journalist John Seaborn Gray attributed U2's pioneering impact on pop-rock music largely to the Edge's unique guitar style.\nU2 received their first Grammy Award in 1988 for \"The Joshua Tree\", and they have won 22 in total out of 46 nominations, more than any other group. These include Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group, Album of the Year, Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Rock Album. In the UK, U2 have received 8 Brit Awards out of 20 nominations from the British Phonographic Industry, including five wins for International Group of the Year. They were the first international group to win the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music. In Ireland, U2 have won 14 Meteor Music Awards since they began in 2001. Other awards won by the band and their members include one American Music Award, four Ivor Novello Awards, six MTV Video Music Awards, eleven Q Awards, two Juno Awards, five NME Awards, and two Golden Globe Awards. The band were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in March 2005. In 2006, all four members of the band received ASCAP awards for writing the songs \"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\" and \"Vertigo\". In 2022, the group received Kennedy Center Honors for their contributions in the performing arts, making them only the fifth musical group to be so honoured. In May 2025, the members of U2 received the Ivors Academy Fellowship for their songwriting, making them the first Irish songwriters to be so honoured.\nDiscography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral and cited references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;"}
{"id": "52784", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52784", "title": "\u0392-Lactam antibiotic", "text": "Class of broad-spectrum antibiotics\n\u03b2-Lactam antibiotics (\"beta\"-lactam antibiotics) are antibiotics that contain a \u03b2-lactam ring in their chemical\nstructure. This includes penicillin derivatives (penams), cephalosporins and cephamycins (cephems), monobactams, carbapenems and carbacephems. Most \u03b2-lactam antibiotics work by inhibiting cell wall biosynthesis in the bacterial organism and are the most widely used group of antibiotics. Until 2003, when measured by sales, more than half of all commercially available antibiotics in use were \u03b2-lactam compounds. The first \u03b2-lactam antibiotic discovered, penicillin, was isolated from a strain of \"Penicillium rubens\" (named as \"Penicillium notatum\" at the time).\nBacteria often develop resistance to \u03b2-lactam antibiotics by synthesizing a \u03b2-lactamase, an enzyme that attacks the \u03b2-lactam ring. To overcome this resistance, \u03b2-lactam antibiotics can be given with \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors such as clavulanic acid.\nMedical use.\n\u03b2-Lactam antibiotics are indicated for the prevention and treatment of bacterial infections caused by susceptible organisms. At first, \u03b2-lactam antibiotics were mainly active only against gram-positive bacteria, yet the recent development of broad-spectrum \u03b2-lactam antibiotics active against various gram-negative organisms has increased their usefulness.\nIn uninflamed (normal) brain meninges, the penetration of beta-lactam antibiotics is low, at 0.15 of AUCCSF/AUCS ratio (the ratio of area under curve of cerebrosopinal fluid against area under curve of serum).\nAdverse effects.\nAdverse drug reactions.\nCommon adverse drug reactions for the \u03b2-lactam antibiotics include diarrhea, nausea, rash, urticaria, superinfection (including candidiasis).\nInfrequent adverse effects include fever, vomiting, erythema, dermatitis, angioedema, pseudomembranous colitis.\nPain and inflammation at the injection site is also common for parenterally administered \u03b2-lactam antibiotics.\nAllergy/hypersensitivity.\nImmunologically mediated adverse reactions to any \u03b2-lactam antibiotic may occur in up to 10% of patients receiving that agent (a small fraction of which are truly IgE-mediated allergic reactions, see amoxicillin rash). Anaphylaxis will occur in approximately 0.01% of patients. There is perhaps a 5\u201310% cross-sensitivity between penicillin-derivatives, cephalosporins, and carbapenems; but this figure has been challenged by various investigators.\nNevertheless, the risk of cross-reactivity is sufficient to warrant the contraindication of all \u03b2-lactam antibiotics in patients with a history of severe allergic reactions (urticaria, anaphylaxis, interstitial nephritis) to any \u03b2-lactam antibiotic. Rarely, allergic reactions have been triggered by exposure from kissing and sexual contact with a partner who is taking these antibiotics.\nA Jarisch\u2013Herxheimer reaction may occur after initial treatment of a spirochetal infection such as syphilis with a \u03b2-lactam antibiotic.\nMechanism of action.\nInhibition of cell wall synthesis.\n\u03b2-Lactam antibiotics are bactericidal, and act by inhibiting the synthesis of the peptidoglycan layer of bacterial cell walls. The peptidoglycan layer is important for cell wall structural integrity, especially in gram-positive organisms, being the outermost and primary component of the wall. The final transpeptidation step in the synthesis of the peptidoglycan is facilitated by -transpeptidases, also known as penicillin binding proteins (PBPs). PBPs vary in their affinity for penicillin and other \u03b2-lactam antibiotics. The number of PBPs varies between bacterial species.\n\u03b2-Lactam antibiotics are analogues of d-alanyl-d-alanine\u2014the terminal amino acid residues on the precursor NAM/NAG-peptide subunits of the nascent peptidoglycan layer. The structural similarity between \u03b2-lactam antibiotics and d-alanyl-d-alanine facilitates their binding to the active site of PBPs. The \u03b2-lactam nucleus of the molecule irreversibly binds to (acylates) the Ser62 residue of the PBP active site. This irreversible inhibition of the PBPs prevents the final crosslinking (transpeptidation) of the nascent peptidoglycan layer, disrupting cell wall synthesis.\n\u03b2-Lactam antibiotics block not only the division of bacteria, including cyanobacteria, but also the division of cyanelles, the photosynthetic organelles of the glaucophytes, and the division of chloroplasts of bryophytes. In contrast, they have no effect on the plastids of the highly developed vascular plants. This is supporting the endosymbiotic theory and indicates an evolution of plastid division in land plants.\nUnder normal circumstances, peptidoglycan precursors signal a reorganisation of the bacterial cell wall and, as a consequence, trigger the activation of autolytic cell wall hydrolases. Inhibition of cross-linkage by \u03b2-lactams causes a build-up of peptidoglycan precursors, which triggers the digestion of existing peptidoglycan by autolytic hydrolases without the production of new peptidoglycan. As a result, the bactericidal action of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics is further enhanced.\nGuanine oxidation.\nAnother possibility that has been proposed to account for much of the cytotoxicity of \u03b2-lactams focuses on the oxidation of the guanine nucleotide in the bacterial nucleotide pool. The incorporation of oxidized guanine nucleotide into DNA could cause cytotoxicity. Bacterial cytotoxicity could arise from incomplete repair of closely spaced 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine lesions in the DNA resulting in double-strand breaks.\nPotency.\nTwo structural features of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics have been correlated with their antibiotic potency. The first is known as \"Woodward's parameter\", \"h\", and is the height (in angstroms) of the pyramid formed by the nitrogen atom of the \u03b2-lactam as the apex and the three adjacent carbon atoms as the base. The second is called \"Cohen's parameter\", \"c\", and is the distance between the carbon atom of the carboxylate and the oxygen atom of the \u03b2-lactam carbonyl. This distance is thought to correspond to the distance between the carboxylate-binding site and the oxyanion hole of the PBP enzyme. The best antibiotics are those with higher \"h\" values (more reactive to hydrolysis) and lower \"c\" values (better binding to PBPs).\nModes of resistance.\nBy definition, all \u03b2-lactam antibiotics have a \u03b2-lactam ring in their structure. The effectiveness of these antibiotics relies on their ability to reach the PBP intact and their ability to bind to the PBP. Hence, there are two main modes of bacterial resistance to \u03b2-lactams: enzymatic hydrolysis of the \u03b2-lactam ring and possession of altered penicillin-binding proteins.\nEnzymatic hydrolysis of the \u03b2-lactam ring.\nIf the bacterium produces the enzyme \u03b2-lactamase or the enzyme penicillinase, the enzyme will hydrolyse the \u03b2-lactam ring of the antibiotic, rendering the antibiotic ineffective. (An example of such an enzyme is New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1, discovered in 2009.) The genes encoding these enzymes may be inherently present on the bacterial chromosome or may be acquired via plasmid transfer (plasmid-mediated resistance), and \u03b2-lactamase gene expression may be induced by exposure to \u03b2-lactams.\nThe production of a \u03b2-lactamase by a bacterium does not necessarily rule out all treatment options with \u03b2-lactam antibiotics. In some instances, \u03b2-lactam antibiotics may be co-administered with a \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor. For example, Augmentin (FGP) is made of amoxicillin (a \u03b2-lactam antibiotic) and clavulanic acid (a \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor). The clavulanic acid is designed to overwhelm all \u03b2-lactamase enzymes, and effectively serve as an antagonist so that the amoxicillin is not affected by the \u03b2-lactamase enzymes. Another \u03b2-lactam/\u03b2-lactamase inhibitor combination is piperacillin/tazobactam with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity that includes gram-positive and -negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The addition of tazobactam to piperacillin has enhanced its stability against a wide range of \u03b2-lactamase enzymes including some Extended-Spectrum \u03b2-lactamases.\nOther \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors such as boronic acids are being studied in which they irreversibly bind to the active site of \u03b2-lactamases. This is a benefit over clavulanic acid and similar \u03b2-lactam competitors, because they cannot be hydrolysed, and therefore rendered useless. Extensive research is currently being done to develop tailored boronic acids to target different isozymes of beta-lactamases.\nHowever, in all cases where infection with \u03b2-lactamase-producing bacteria is suspected, the choice of a suitable \u03b2-lactam antibiotic should be carefully considered prior to treatment. In particular, choosing appropriate \u03b2-lactam antibiotic therapy is of utmost importance against organisms which harbor some level of \u03b2-lactamase expression. In this case, failure to use the most appropriate \u03b2-lactam antibiotic therapy at the onset of treatment could result in selection for bacteria with higher levels of \u03b2-lactamase expression, thereby making further efforts with other \u03b2-lactam antibiotics more difficult.\nIn the context of medical pharmacology, penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems, while all have the \u03b2-lactam ring that serves as the fundamental structure, also have an auxiliary ring that carries a carboxylate group that is positioned on the same side as the carbonyl group within the \u03b2-lactam ring, and, as such, this structural configuration is critical to their antimicrobial activity. Bacterial resistance to these antibiotics primarily occurs through the production of \u03b2-lactamases, enzymes that hydrolyze the amide bond of the \u03b2-lactam ring, thereby eliminating the antimicrobial activity of these antibiotics. This resistance mechanism underscores the importance of the structural integrity of the \u03b2-lactam ring for the antibiotic's function. The color change from colorless or light yellow to amber or even red in an aqueous solution of a \u03b2-lactam antibiotic can denote \u03b2-lactamase hydrolysis of amide bonds in the \u03b2-lactam ring. This is often observed with a chromogenic \u03b2-lactamase substrate like ceftriaxone, merapenem, or nitrocefin, that undergoes a distinctive color change from yellow to red as the amide bond in the \u03b2-lactam ring is hydrolyzed by \u03b2-lactamase. This color change is a visual indicator of the presence and activity of \u03b2-lactamase enzymes, which are responsible for conferring resistance to \u03b2-lactam antibiotics in many bacterial species. The hydrolysis of the \u03b2-lactam ring by \u03b2-lactamase enzymes renders the antibiotic ineffective, thereby allowing the bacteria to survive in the presence of the antibiotic. Some \u03b2-lactam antibiotics like ceftriaxone and meropenem are known to be relatively unstable in solution, especially when stored for extended periods, and degrade in an aqueous solution even without the presence of \u03b2-lactamase. For ceftriaxone, the color of solutions can range from light yellow to amber, depending on the length of storage, concentration, and diluent used. A study found that meropenem concentrations dropped to 90% of the initial concentration at 7.4 hours at 22\u00b0C and 5.7 hours at 33\u00b0C, indicating degradation over time.\nPossession of altered penicillin-binding proteins.\nAs a response to the use of \u03b2-lactams to control bacterial infections, some bacteria have evolved penicillin binding proteins with novel structures. \u03b2-Lactam antibiotics cannot bind as effectively to these altered PBPs, and, as a result, the \u03b2-lactams are less effective at disrupting cell wall synthesis. Notable examples of this mode of resistance include methicillin-resistant \"Staphylococcus aureus\" (MRSA) and penicillin-resistant \"Streptococcus pneumoniae\". Altered PBPs do not necessarily rule out all treatment options with \u03b2-lactam antibiotics.\nNomenclature.\n\u03b2-Lactams are classified according to their core ring structures.\nBy convention, the bicyclic \u03b2-lactams are numbered starting with the position occupied by sulfur in the penams and cephems, regardless of which atom it is in a given class. That is, position 1 is always adjacent to the \u03b2-carbon of \u03b2-lactam ring. The numbering continues clockwise from position one until the \u03b2-carbon of \u03b2-lactam is reached, at which point numbering continues counterclockwise around the lactam ring to number the remaining to carbons. For example, the nitrogen atom of all bicyclic \u03b2-lactams fused to five-membered rings is labelled position 4, as it is in penams, while in cephems, the nitrogen is position 5.\nThe numbering of monobactams follows that of the IUPAC; the nitrogen atom is position 1, the carbonyl carbon is 2, the \u03b1-carbon is 3, and the \u03b2-carbon 4.\nBiosynthesis.\nTo date, two distinct methods of biosynthesizing the \u03b2-lactam core of this family of antibiotics have been discovered. The first pathway discovered was that of the penams and cephems. This path begins with a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), ACV synthetase (ACVS), which generates the linear tripeptide \u03b4-(-\u03b1-aminoadipyl)--cysteine--valine (ACV). ACV is oxidatively cyclized (two cyclizations by a single enzyme) to bicyclic intermediate isopenicillin N by isopenicillin N synthase (IPNS) to form the penam core structure. Various transamidations lead to the different natural penicillins.\nThe biosynthesis of cephems branch off at isopenicillin N by an oxidative ring expansion to the cephem core. As with the penams, the variety of cephalosporins and cephamycins come from different transamidations, as is the case for the penicillins.\nWhile the ring closure in penams and cephems is between positions 1 and 4 of the \u03b2-lactam and is oxidative, the clavams and carbapenems have their rings closed between positions 1 and 2 of the ring. \u03b2-lactam synthetases are responsible for these cyclizations, and the carboxylate of the open-ring substrates is activated by ATP. In clavams, the \u03b2-lactam is formed prior to the second ring; in carbapenems, the \u03b2-lactam ring is closed second in sequence.\nThe biosynthesis of the \u03b2-lactam ring of tabtoxin mirrors that of the clavams and carbapenems. The closure of the lactam ring in the other monobactams, such as sulfazecin and the nocardicins, may involve a third mechanism involving inversion of configuration at the \u03b2-carbon.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A municipal council or local council is the legislative body of a municipality or local government area. Depending on the location and classification of the municipality it may be known as a city council, town council, town board, community council, borough council, rural council, village council, board of aldermen, or board of selectmen.\nLocal governments typically constitute a subdivision of a higher-level political or administrative unit, such as a nation or state. Local governments generally act within the powers and functions assigned to them by law or directives of a higher level of government. In federal states, local government generally comprises a third or fourth level of government, whereas in unitary states, local government usually occupies the second or third level of government.\nThe institutions of local government vary greatly between countries, and even where similar arrangements exist, country-specific terminology often varies. Common designated names for different types of local government entities include counties, districts, cities, townships, towns, boroughs, parishes, municipalities, municipal corporations, shires, villages, and local government areas. The same term may be used in different countries to refer to local governance institutions with vastly different institutional features, powers, or functions.\nIn addition to general-purpose local governments, some countries have special-purpose local governments (special districts), such as independent school districts, elected water boards, or local service districts.\nAlthough there is no single, commonly accepted definition of the term, the most precise definition of local governments is provided by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which divides the general government sector into three sub-sectors (central, state, and local government) and defines local governments as \"institutional units whose fiscal, legislative, and executive authority extends over the smallest geographical areas distinguished for administrative and political purposes.\"\nThe IMF further notes that local governments \"typically provide a wide range of services to local residents,\" while \"the scope of their authority is generally much less than that of central government or state governments, and they may or may not be entitled to levy taxes.\" They are often heavily dependent on grants (transfers) from higher levels of government, and they may also act, to some extent, as agents of central or regional governments. They should also be able to appoint their own officers, independently of external administrative control. Even when local governments act as agents of central or state governments to some extent, they can be treated as a separate level of government, provided they are also able to raise and spend some funds on their own initiative and own responsibility.\"\nOther definitions for local governments are less prescriptive and emphasize the political or representative nature of local governments. For instance, OECD defines local governments as \"decentralized entities whose governance bodies are elected through universal suffrage and which has general responsibilities and some autonomy with respect to budget, staff and assets.\" The Local Public Sector Alliance defines local government institutions as \"a corporate body (or institutional unit) that performs one or more public sector functions within a [local] jurisdiction that has adequate political, administrative, and fiscal autonomy and authority to respond to the needs and priorities of its constituents\".\nQuestions regarding the empowerment of local government institutions, the structure and nature of local political leadership, and the extent of local self-governance and municipal autonomy are key questions of public administration and governance. Local elections are held in many countries.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAfrica.\nEgypt.\nEgypt has a centralised system of local government officially called local administration as it is a branch of the Executive. The country is divided into 27 governorates ( '; ; genitive case: ; plural: '), the top tier of local administration. A governorate is administered by a governor, who is appointed by the President of Egypt and serves at the president's discretion.\nGovernors have the civilian rank of minister and report directly to the prime minister, who chairs the Board of Governors and meets with them on a regular basis. The Minister of Local Development coordinates the governors and their governorate's budgets.\nMali.\nIn recent years, Mali has undertaken an ambitious decentralization program, which involves the capital district of Bamako, seven regions subdivided into 46 cercles, and 682 rural community districts (communes). The state retains an advisory role in administrative and fiscal matters, and it provides technical support, coordination, and legal recourse to these levels. Opportunities for direct political participation, and increased local responsibility for development have been improved.\nIn August\u2013September 1998, elections were held for urban council members, who subsequently elected their mayors. In May/June 1999, citizens of the communes elected their communal council members for the first time. Female voter turnout was about 70% of the total, and observers considered the process open and transparent. With mayors, councils, and boards in place at the local level, newly elected officials, civil society organizations, decentralized technical services, private sector interests, other communes, and donor groups began partnering to further development.\nEventually, the cercles will be reinstituted (formerly grouping arrondissements) with a legal and financial basis of their own. Their councils will be chosen by and from members of the communal councils. The regions, at the highest decentralized level, will have a similar legal and financial autonomy, and will comprise a number of cercles within their geographical boundaries. Mali needs to build capacity at these levels, especially to mobilize and manage financial resources.\nNigeria.\nNigeria as a federal republic operates three tiers of government: federal (or central), states\nand local government. The country's constitution provides for each local government (which exists in a single tier countrywide), and its development areas and autonomous communities created by individual state legislation to have democratically elected local government heads. There is a ministry (or bureau) of local government and chieftaincy affairs in each state charged with the responsibility of administration at that level. Nigeria has a total of 774 Local Government Areas\n(LGAs).\nSouth Africa.\nSouth Africa has a two-tiered local government system comprising local municipalities which fall into district municipalities, and metropolitan municipalities which span both tiers of local government. The country has eight metropolitan municipalities, 44 district municipalities and 205 local municipalities.\nThe largest cities are governed by metropolitan municipalities, often called \"metros\". An example of such is the City of Cape Town, which operates using a City Council (with a City Manager) as head of the executive, and a Mayor as head of the ruling party locally, and overall city governance. A Deputy Mayor is also appointed.\nMetropolitan municipalities govern a total of 24.8 million people, as of the 2022 Census, which constitutes around 40% of the South African population. Outside metros, the rest of the country is governed jointly by district and local municipalities. District municipalities have broader functions, such as integrated planning, infrastructure development, and public transit. Local municipalities have responsibility for all municipal functions not assigned to the district, including local service delivery. Municipalities operate within specific jurisdictions, and can set local bylaws that are quite far-reaching. However, major laws are still set by the provincial and national governments. City budgets are audited annually. Local governments (municipal councils) are elected during municipal elections, held every five years.\nAsia.\nAfghanistan.\nAfghanistan was traditionally divided into provinces governed by centrally appointed governors with considerable autonomy in local affairs. There are currently 34 provinces. During the Soviet occupation and the development of country-wide resistance, local areas came increasingly under the control of mujaheddin groups that were largely independent of any higher authority; local commanders, in some instances, asserted a measure of independence also from the mujaheddin leadership in Pakistan, establishing their own systems of local government, collecting revenues, running educational and other facilities, and even engaging in local negotiations. Mujaheddin groups retained links with the Peshawar parties to ensure access to weapons that were doled out to the parties by the government of Pakistan for distribution to fighters inside Afghanistan.\nThe Taliban set up a shura (assembly), made up of senior Taliban members and important tribal from the area. Each shura made laws and collected taxes locally. The Taliban set up a provisional government for the whole of Afghanistan, but it did not exercise central control over the local shuras.\nThe process of setting up the transitional government in June 2002 by the Loya Jirga took many steps involving local government. First, at the district and municipal level, traditional shura councils met to pick electors\u2014persons who cast ballots for Loya Jirga delegates. Each district or municipality had to choose a predetermined number of electors, based on the size of its population. The electors then traveled to regional centers and cast ballots, to choose from amongst themselves a smaller number of loya jirga delegates\u2014 according to allotted numbers assigned to each district. The delegates then took part in the Loya Jirga.\nThe warlords who rule various regions of the country exert local control. The transitional government is attempting to integrate local governing authorities with the central government, but it lacks the loyalty from the warlords necessary to its governing authority. More traditional elements of political authority\u2014such as Sufi networks, royal lineage, clan strength, age-based wisdom, and the like\u2014still exist and play a role in Afghan society. Karzai is relying on these traditional sources of authority in his challenge to the warlords and older Islamist leaders. The deep ethnic, linguistic, sectarian, tribal, racial, and regional cleavages present in the country create what is called \"Qawm\" identity, emphasizing the local over higher-order formations. Qawm refers to the group to which the individual considers himself to belong, whether a subtribe, village, valley, or neighborhood. Local governing authority relies upon these forms of identity and loyalty.\nArmenia.\nArmenia is subdivided into eleven administrative divisions. Of these, ten are provinces, known as \"marzer\" () or in the singular form \"marz\" () in Armenian.\nAzerbaijan.\nAzerbaijan is administratively divided into the following subdivisions: 67 districts (\"rayonlar\"), 11 cities (\"\u015f\u0259h\u0259rl\u0259r\"). The Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic is a territorial exlcave, which itself contains: 7 districts and a city. The rayons are further divided into municipalities. (\"B\u0259l\u0259diyy\u0259\").\nBangladesh.\nBangladesh is divided into eight administrative divisions, each named after their respective divisional headquarters: Barisal, Chittagong, Dhaka, Khulna, Rajshahi, Sylhet, Rangpur and Mymensingh Division.\nDivisions are divided into \"zila\". There are 64 zila in Bangladesh, each further divided into \"upazila\" or \"thana\". The area within each police station, except for those in metropolitan areas, is divided into several \"unions\", with each union consisting of multiple villages. In the metropolitan areas, police stations are divided into wards, which are further divided into \"mahallas\". There are no directly elected officials at the divisional or district levels, although elected chairs of subdistricts also sit on district councils. Direct elections are held for each union (or ward), electing a chairperson and a number of members. In 1997, a parliamentary act was passed to reserve three seats (out of 12) in every union for female candidates.\nDhaka is the capital and largest city of Bangladesh. The cities with a city corporation, having mayoral elections, include Dhaka South, Dhaka North, Chittagong, Khulna, Sylhet, Rajshahi, Barisal, Rangpur, Comilla and Gazipur. Other major cities, these and other municipalities electing a mayor and councilors for each ward, include Mymensingh, Gopalganj, Jessore, Bogra, Dinajpur, Saidapur, Narayanganj, Naogaon and Rangamati. Both the municipal heads are elected for a span of five years.\nBrunei.\nThe administrative divisions of Brunei mainly consist of \"daerah\", \"mukim\" and \"kampung\" or \"kampong\". They are organised hierarchically, with \"daerah\" being the first level and \"kampong\" the third level. All the administrative divisions are under direct governance of the government through the Ministry of Home Affairs. There are four districts in Brunei: Brunei-Muara, Belait, Tutong and Temburong. The administrative level of mukim lies below the district. At present, there are 38 mukims, with 17 in Brunei-Muara, 8 in Tutong, 8 in Belait and 5 in Temburong District. A mukim is headed by a penghulu. A village (Malay: kampung or kampong) is the lowest administrative level in Brunei and headed by a ketua kampong or village head. Its population varies from a few hundreds to tens of thousands.\nChina.\nMunicipal councils exist in the People's Republic of China, these are designated as \"Municipal People's Congress\" in many sub-provincial cities and direct-administered municipalities such as the Shanghai Municipal People's Congress.\nHong Kong.\nEstablished as the Sanitary Board in 1883, the Municipal Council in Hong Kong Island and Kowloon (including the New Kowloon) provided municipal services to the covered regions in the then British Hong Kong. Partial elections were allowed in 1887, though merely enabling selected persons to vote for members of the Board. The Board was reconstituted in 1935 and hence renamed as Urban Council in the following year after the government had passed the Urban Council Ordinance. Democratisation had been implemented, allowing universal suffrage to happen throughout its development. Two years after the Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong, the council was disbanded in 1999 by the then Chief Executive of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. All members of the council were elected through universal suffrage by the time of the dissolution.\nThe counterpart of the Municipal Council serving the New Territories (excluding New Kowloon) was the Regional Council established as the Provisional Regional Council in 1986. The functional select committees, district committees, and sub-committees constituted the entire Regional Council. All members were elected from the constituencies and district boards.\nBoth of the Municipal Councils in Hong Kong are now defunct.\nGeorgia.\nThe subdivisions of Georgia are autonomous republics (Georgian: , \"avtonomiuri respublika\"), regions (\u10db\u10ee\u10d0\u10e0\u10d4, \"mkhare\"), and municipalities (\u10db\u10e3\u10dc\u10d8\u10ea\u10d8\u10de\u10d0\u10da\u10d8\u10e2\u10d4\u10e2\u10d8, \"munits'ipaliteti\").\nIndia.\nLocal government is the third tier of government in India, after Union Government and State Government. The urban local bodies (municipalities) are for urban governance and panchayati raj institutions (panchayats) for rural governance.\nThe Urban Local Bodies (ULBs): are Municipal Corporation, Municipal Council (municipality) and Town panchayat (notified area council).\nThe Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs), knowns as \"Panchayats\" are a three-tier system of local self-government in rural areas in India: District Panchayat (district level), Block Panchayat (block level) and Village Panchayat (village level).\nIn India, a municipal council (also referred to as a municipal committee, municipal board) functions as the elected governing body of a municipality, which is the local government institution for smaller urban areas. A municipality is generally divided into territorial constituencies known as wards. Residents of each ward elect a representative called a municipal councillor, and together these councillors constitute the municipal council.\nThe council is headed by a chairperson or president, assisted by a vice-chairperson or vice-president. Council meetings are presided over by the chairperson. For administrative purposes, the state government appoints a chief executive officer or municipal secretary, who oversees day-to-day operations and implements council decisions.\nMunicipalities are established by the respective State Municipal Acts, enacted under the framework of Part IXA of the Constitution (74th Amendment Act, 1992). The composition, powers, and functions of municipal councils are defined by state legislation.\nIn larger urban areas, municipal corporations serve as the local governing bodies, while municipal councils generally administer smaller towns and urban centres.\nIsrael.\nThe Israeli Ministry of Interior recognizes four types of local government in Israel: \nIsraeli municipal elections are scheduled every five years, and apply to all local governments in the country, Jewish and Arab alike.\nJapan.\nSince the Meiji restoration, Japan has had a local government system based on prefectures. The national government oversees much of the country. Municipal governments were historical villages. Now mergers are common for cost effective administration. There are 47 prefectures. They have two main responsibilities. One is mediation between national and municipal governments. The other is area wide administration. Municipal councils are parliamentary bodies established in local authorities in accordance with Article 93 of the Constitution of Japan and Article 89 of the Local Autonomy Act, etc. The Yokohama and Osaka City Councils are examples.\nMalaysia.\nLocal government is the lowest level in the system of government in Malaysia\u2014after federal and state. Councillors are not elected in local-level elections which have been abolished in 1976, but rather appointed by state governments. It has the power to collect taxes (in the form of assessment tax), to create laws and rules (in the form of by-laws) and grants licenses and permits for any trade in its area of jurisdiction, in addition to providing basic amenities, collecting and managing waste and garbage as well as planning and developing the area under its jurisdiction.\nNepal.\nGaunpalika (Rural Council) and Nagarpalika (Municipal council) are the local level divisions in Nepal. Which is ruled by third level of government after Federal and Provincial government. In Nepal there are total 753 local levels government (including 6 Metropolises, 11 Sub-metropolises, 276 Municipalities and 460 Gaunpalikas). And there are total 6,743 wards are formed under these 753 local levels. These local government are ruled by local leaders and the Mayor is the supreme of each local government which is elected every 5 (Five) year by local public.\nPakistan.\nLocal government is the third tier of government in Pakistan, after Federal Government and Provincial Government. There are three types of administrative unit of local government in Pakistan are District Government Administrations, Town Municipal Administrations and Union Council Administrations\nThere are over five thousand local governments in Pakistan. Since 2001, these have been led by democratically elected local councils, each headed by a Nazim (the word means \"supervisor\" in Urdu, but is sometimes translated as Mayor). Some districts, incorporating large metropolitan areas, are called City Districts. A City District may contain subdivisions called Towns and Union Councils. Council elections are held every four years. District Governments also include a District Coordination Officer (DCO), who is a civil servant in-charge of all devolved departments. Currently, the Powers of Nazim are also held by the DCO.\nPalestinian Authority.\nLocal government in the Palestinian National Authority-controlled areas are divided into three main groups: Municipal councils, village council and local development committees.\nPhilippines.\nThe Local Government Code of 1991 provides for the three levels of Local Government Units or LGUs in the Philippines: (1) the province (2) city and municipality, and (3) the barangay. The country remains a unitary state and the National Government continues to have strong influence over local government units.\nA province is led by a governor along with the \"Sangguniang Panlalawigan\" (Provincial Council) composed of board members. A mayor leads a city or municipality while the \"Sangguniang Panlungsod\" (City Council) and the \"Sangguniang Bayan\" (Municipal Council) constitute the legislative branches of a city and municipality, respectively. A barangay is headed by the Barangay Captain and the Barangay Council. Barangays can be further divided into puroks and sitios but their leadership is unelected.\nThe 1987 Philippine Constitution also provides for the existence of autonomous regions. The Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) is the only autonomous region in the Philippines. There was an attempt to institute an autonomous region in the Cordillera, but that failed and instead the Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR) was established.\nLocal governments have limited taxing authority. Most of their funds come from the national government via the Internal Revenue Allotment\nAll municipalities have their own municipal council, and these are officially called: \"Sangguniang Bayan\". Cities have a similar but separate form of legislature called \"Sangguniang Panlungsod\" (literally \"city council\"). The Local Government Code of 1991 established the current local government structure, including municipal councils. City councils range from 12, in most cities, to 38 members, such as the Manila City Council. Members of city councils are called \"councilors\".\nSaudi Arabia.\nThere are three levels of local government in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia: the city council, the municipal council and the municipality.\nThe city council is the highest level of local government. The municipal councils began in 2005 and is the second level of local government. The municipality is the third level of local government. There are 178 municipalities across the kingdom. The first began in Jeddah during the Othmanic period. Each municipality is run by its city's mayor. Collectively, the kingdom's municipalities make up the Ministry of Municipality and Rural Affairs (MoMRA).\nSingapore.\nIn Singapore, town councils are in charge of maintaining the common areas of Housing and Development Board (HDB) flats and estates, such as the common corridors, void decks, lifts, water tanks, external lighting and the open spaces surrounding the estates. They are regulated under the Town Councils Act (https://).\nThe rationale was to delegate the duties of estate management to the members of parliament in addition to their existing responsibilities. They would also gain management experience and be accountable to their district's resident voters.\nTown councils boundaries are drawn based on electoral districts boundaries. A town council area can consist of a Group Representation Constituency (GRC), a Single Member Constituency (SMC), or a collection of neighbouring GRCs and SMCs controlled by the same political party. The Members of Parliament head the town councils of their constituencies. Town councils boundaries do not correspond to new town boundaries; different parts of the same HDB town may be managed by different town councils.\nTaiwan.\nThe Republic of China government in Taiwan consists of special municipality governments, provincial city governments and county governments for their local governments. They also have councils in each of those three local government levels.\nTurkey.\nTurkey has two levels of local government; provinces (Turkish: iller) and districts (Turkish: il\u00e7eler).\nThe territory of Turkey is subdivided into 81 provinces for administrative purposes. The provinces are organized into 7 regions for census purposes; however, they do not represent an administrative structure. Each province is divided into districts, for a total of 957 districts.\nVietnam.\nVietnam has 3 levels of local government:\nEach level has a People's Committee (executive \u2013 up to third tier), a People's Council (legislative \u2013 up to third tier) and a People's Court (judiciary \u2013 up to second tier).\nEurope.\nAlbania.\nSince its Declaration of Independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1912, Albania has reformed its internal divisions 21 times. Before the implementation of the 1998 Constitution, the primary division was into about 36 districts (), whose number, size, and importance varied over time. Following their abolishment in the year 2000, the counties were divided into urban () and rural municipalities () until the 2015 elections, when they were replaced by the current system.\nPresently, Albania has 3\u20134 levels of local government :\nThe prefects who oversee each county are appointed by the central government, but the mayors of the municipalities and the local government councils are elected democratically.\nAndorra.\nAndorra is formed by seven parishes (parr\u00f2quies, singular \u2013 parr\u00f2quia); Andorra la Vella, Canillo, Encamp, La Massana, Escaldes-Engordany, Ordino, Sant Juli\u00e0 de L\u00f2ria.\nSome parishes have a further territorial subdivision. Ordino, La Massana and Sant Juli\u00e0 de L\u00f2ria are subdivided into \"quarts\" (quarters), while Canillo is subdivided into 10 \"ve\u00efnats\" (neighborhoods). Those mostly coincide with villages, which are found in all parishes. Each parish has its own elected mayor who is the nominal head of the local government known as a \"com\u00fa\" in Catalan.\nBelarus.\nAt the top level of administration, Belarus is divided into six \"regions\" and the city of Minsk, which has a special status being the capital of Belarus. Minsk is also the capital of Minsk Region.\nAt the second level, the regions are divided into \"raions\" (\"districts\").\nBulgaria.\nSince the 1880s, the number of territorial management units in Bulgaria has varied from seven to 26. Between 1987 and 1999 the administrative structure consisted of nine provinces (\"oblasti\", singular \"oblast\"). A new administrative structure was adopted in parallel with the decentralisation of the economic system. It includes 27 provinces and a metropolitan capital province (Sofia-Grad). All areas take their names from their respective capital cities. The provinces subdivide into 264 municipalities.\nMunicipalities are run by mayors, who are elected to four-year terms, and by directly elected municipal councils. Bulgaria is a highly centralised state, where the national Council of Ministers directly appoints regional governors and all provinces and municipalities are heavily dependent on it for funding.\nCroatia.\nCroatia is divided into 20 counties and the capital city of Zagreb, the latter having the authority and legal status of a county and a city at the same time. The counties subdivide into 127 cities and 429 municipalities.\nCzech Republic.\nThe highest tier of local government in the Czech Republic are the thirteen regions (Czech: \"kraje\", singular \"kraj\") and the capital city of Prague. Each region has its own elected Regional Assembly (\"krajsk\u00e9 zastupitelstvo\") and \"hejtman\" (usually translated as hetman or governor). In Prague, their powers are executed by the city council and the mayor.\nThe regions are divided into seventy-six districts (\"okresy\", singular \"okres\") including three \"statutory cities\" (without Prague, which had special status). The districts lost most of their importance in 1999 in an administrative reform; they remain as territorial divisions and seats of various branches of state administration. A further reform in effect since January 2003 created 204 Municipalities with Extended Competence (obce s roz\u0161\u00ed\u0159enou p\u016fsobnost\u00ed); also obce III. stupn\u011b \u2013 third-level municipalities, unofficially also called \"little districts\" (Czech: 'mal\u00e9 okresy') which took over most of the administration of the former district authorities. Some of these are further divided between Municipalities with Commissioned Local Authority (obce s pov\u011b\u0159en\u00fdm obecn\u00edm \u00fa\u0159adem, shortened to pov\u011b\u0159en\u00e1 obec, pl. pov\u011b\u0159en\u00e9 obce; \"second-level municipalities\"). In 2007 the borders of the districts were slightly adjusted, and 119 municipalities are now within different districts.\nDenmark.\nFor local government purposes, Denmark is divided into five regions (), with their most important area of responsibility being the public health service. They are also responsible for employment policies, while some regions are responsible for public mass transit. Regions are not financial independent as they rely entirely on central state funding (around 70%) and funding coming from the municipalities (around 30%). Regions are led by directly elected councils (\"regionsr\u00e5d\") consisting of 41 members each.\nThe regions are further divided into 98 municipalities (\"kommuner\"). Elections for the municipalities are held on the third Tuesday of November every four years.\nEstonia.\nEstonia is divided into 79 municipalities (\"omavalitsus\"), and each municipality is a unit of self-government with its representative and executive bodies. Furthermore, the country is also divided into fifteen counties (), each of which were used to be led by a county governor (\"maavanem\"), who represents the national government at the regional level. This although changed with 2017 administrative reform.\nFinland.\nThe most important administrative layer of local government in Finland are the 311 municipalities, which may also call themselves towns or cities. They account for half of public spending. Spending is financed by municipal income tax, property tax, state subsidies, and other revenue.\nIn addition to municipalities, there are two intermediate levels of local government. Municipalities co-operate in seventy-four sub-regions and nineteen regions. These are governed by the member municipalities and have only limited powers. However, the autonomous province of \u00c5land has a directly elected regional council, and the Sami people have a semi-autonomous Sami Domicile Area in Lapland for issues on language and culture.\nFrance.\nAccording to its Constitution of 1958, France has 3 levels of local government:\nHowever, in addition to the constitutional clauses of 1958, there now exist specificities:\nIn spite of enormous differences in populations, each of the communes of the French Republic possesses a mayor () and a municipal council (), which manage the commune from the \"mairie\" (city hall), with exactly the same powers no matter the size of the commune and council. The one exception is the city of Paris, where the city police is in the hands of the central state, not in the hands of the mayor of Paris. This uniformity of status is a clear legacy of the French Revolution, which wanted to do away with the local idiosyncrasies and tremendous differences of status that existed in the kingdom of France. The size of a commune still matters, however, in two domains: French law determines the size of the municipal council according to the population of the commune; and the size of the population determines which voting process is used for the election of the municipal council.\nGreece.\nSince 1 January 2011, Greece consists of thirteen regions subdivided into a total of 325 municipalities and communities. The regions have their own elected governors and regional councils, however there are seven decentralized administrations, which group from one to three regions under a government-appointed general secretary. There is also one autonomous area, Mount Athos.\nHungary.\nFor local government, Hungary is divided into 19 counties. In addition, the capital (\"f\u0151v\u00e1ros\"), Budapest and the 25 Cities with county rights (\"megyei jog\u00fa v\u00e1rosok\") is independent of any county government. But all the county capitals are cities with county rights, except Pest county where Budapest is the capital of the county.\nThe local authorities of these cities have extended powers, but they belong to the territory of the respective county instead of being independent territorial units.\nThe counties are further subdivided into 198 districts (\"j\u00e1r\u00e1sok\"), and Budapest is its own 23 districts (\"ker\u00fcletek\").\nIceland.\nThe Municipalities of Iceland are local administrative areas in Iceland that provide a number of services to their inhabitants such as kindergartens, elementary schools, waste management, social services, public housing, public transportation, services to senior citizens and handicapped people. They also govern zoning and can voluntarily take on additional functions if they have the budget for it. The autonomy of municipalities over their own matters is guaranteed by the constitution of Iceland.\nThe municipalities are governed by municipal councils which are directly elected every four years. The sizes of these councils vary from five members in the smallest municipalities to fifteen in the largest one. Most municipalities except for the very small ones hire an executive manager who may or may not be a member of the municipal council. These managers are usually referred to as mayors (\"b\u00e6jarstj\u00f3ri / borgarstj\u00f3ri\") in the mostly urban municipalities but \"commune manager\" (\"sveitarstj\u00f3ri\") in the rural or mixed municipalities.\nIreland.\nThe Republic of Ireland's local government is laid out by the Local Government Reform Act 2014. With a few exceptions, local government is two-tier. At the lowest level are the municipal, metropolitan or borough councils, which are elected during local elections. These councillors from the relevant county then together form the council, termed either County or City and County Councils. For example, the 4 municipal districts in Westmeath County each elect their own councils, who together form Westmeath County Council. Many functions are performed by the Chief Executive, who is appointed by the Minister for Local Government.\nThe exceptions to the above is the county of Dublin and the cities of Cork and Galway, the later two's councils are directly elected with no lower council. Dublin county is made up of four local area authorities, each elected directly. There are thirty-one local authorities.\nThe main sources of funding for local government in Ireland are local property and motor tax revenues, payments from the Exchequer, charges for goods and services, and state grants.\nItaly.\nThe Constitution of Italy defines three levels of local government:\nMajor cities also have an extra tier of local government named \"Circoscrizione di Decentramento Comunale\" or, in some cities (e.g. Rome) \"Municipio\".\nLatvia.\nLatvia is a unitary state, currently divided into 110 municipalities () and 9 republican cities () with their own council.\nLiechtenstein.\nLiechtenstein is divided into eleven municipalities (\"Gemeinden\"\u00a0\u2013 singular \"Gemeinde\"), most consisting of only a single town.\nLithuania.\nLithuania has a three-tier division of local government: the country is divided into 10 counties (Lithuanian: singular \u2013 \"apskritis\", plural \u2013 \"apskritys\") that are further subdivided into 60 municipalities (Lithuanian: singular \u2013 \"savivaldyb\u0117\", plural \u2013 \"savivaldyb\u0117s\") which consist of over 500 elderships (Lithuanian: singular \u2013 \"seni\u016bnija\", plural \u2013 \"seni\u016bnijos\").\nThe counties are ruled by county governors (Lithuanian: \"apskrities vir\u0161ininkas\") appointed by the central government, and effectively oversee the two lower tiers of local government.\nMunicipalities are the most important administrative unit of local government. Each municipality has its own government and council, with elections taking place every four years. The mayor, who is a member of the council, is elected directly by the residents in a majority vote. The council appoints elders to govern the elderships.\nElderships, numbering over 500, are the smallest units of local government. They provide public services such as registering births and deaths and identifying individuals or families in need of welfare.\nMalta.\nMalta is a unitary city state divided into 68 municipalities (local councils), according to the constitution of the Malta.\nMoldova.\nThe Municipal Council in Moldova is the governing body in five municipalities: Chi\u0219in\u0103u, B\u0103l\u021bi, Tiraspol and Bendery (also known as \"Tighina\" or \"Bender\"). The Municipal Council (Moldovan language: \"Consiliul municipal\") serves as a consultative body with some powers of general policy determination. It is composed of a legally determined number of counsellors (for example 35 in B\u0103l\u021bi) elected every four years, representing political parties and independent counsellors. Once elected, counsellors may form fractions inside of the Municipal Council.\nNetherlands.\nThe Netherlands has three tiers of local government: national, provincial, municipal and water board.\nThe Netherlands is divided into twelve provinces (\"provincie\", pl. \"provincies\"). They form the tier of administration between the central government and the municipalities. Each province is governed by a provincial council, the States-Provincial (\"Provinciale Staten\", abbr. to \"PS\"). Its members are elected every four years. The day-to-day management of the province is in the hands of the provincial executive, the States Deputed (\"Gedeputeerde Staten\", abbr. to \"GS\"). Members of the executive are chosen by the provincial council. The size of the executive varies from one province to another. In Flevoland, the smallest of the Dutch provinces, it has four members, while most other provinces have six or seven. Meetings of the provincial executive are chaired by the King's Commissioner (\"Commissaris van de Koning(in)\", abbr. to \"CvdK\"). The King's Commissioner is not elected by the residents of the province, but appointed by the Crown (the King and government ministers). The appointment is for six years and may be extended by a second term. The King's Commissioner can be dismissed only by the Crown. King's Commissioners play an important part in the appointment of municipal mayors. When a vacancy arises, the King's Commissioner first asks the municipal council for its views as to a successor, then writes to the Minister of the Interior recommending a candidate.\nMunicipalities (\"gemeente\", pl. \"gemeenten\") form the lowest tier of government in the Netherlands, after the central government and the provinces. There are 415 of them (1 January 2012). The municipal council (\"gemeenteraad\") is the highest authority in the municipality. Its members are elected every four years. The role of the municipal council is comparable to that of the board of an organisation or institution. Its main job is to decide the municipality's broad policies and to oversee their implementation. The day-to-day administration of the municipality is in the hands of the municipal executive (\"college van burgemeester en wethouders\", abbr. to \"(college van) B&amp;W)\", made up of the mayor (\"burgemeester\") and the aldermen (\"wethouder\", pl. \"wethouders\"). The executive implements national legislation on matters such as social assistance, unemployment benefits and environmental management. It also bears primary responsibility for the financial affairs of the municipality and for its personnel policies. Aldermen are appointed by the council. Councillors can be chosen to act as aldermen. In that case, they lose their seats on the council and their places are taken by other representatives of the same political parties. Non-councillors can also be appointed. Unlike councillors and aldermen, mayors are not elected (not even indirectly), but are appointed by the Crown. Mayors chair both the municipal council and the executive. They have a number of statutory powers and responsibilities of their own. They are responsible for maintaining public order and safety within the municipality and frequently manage the municipality's public relations. As Crown appointees, mayors also have some responsibility for overseeing the work of the municipality, its policies and relations with other government bodies. Although they are obliged to carry out the decisions of the municipal council and executive, they may recommend that the Minister of the Interior quash any decision that they believe to be contrary to the law or against the public interest. Mayors are invariably appointed for a period of six years. They can be dismissed only by the Crown and not by the municipal council.\nWater boards (\"waterschap\" and \"hoogheemraadschap\", pl. \"waterschappen\" and \"hoogheemraadschappen\") are among the oldest government authorities in the Netherlands. They literally form the foundation of the whole Dutch system of local government; from time immemorial they have shouldered the responsibility for water management for the residents of their area. In polders this mainly involves regulating the water level. It has always been in the common interest to keep water out and polder residents have always had to work together. That is what led to the creation of water boards. The structure of the water boards varies, but they all have a general administrative body and an executive board (\"college van dijkgraaf en heemraden\") consisting of a chairperson (\"dijkgraaf\") and other members (\"(hoog)heemraad\", pl. \"(hoog)heemraden\"). The chairperson also presides the general administrative body. This body consists of people representing the various categories of stakeholders: landholders, leaseholders, owners of buildings, companies and, since recently, all the residents as well. Importance and financial contribution decide how many representatives each category may delegate. Certain stakeholders (e.g. environmental organisations) may be given the power to appoint members. The general administrative body elects the executive board from among its members. The government appoints the chairperson for a period of six years. The general administrative body is elected for a period of four years. In the past the administrative body was elected as individuals but from 2009 they will be elected as party representatives.\nNorway.\nNorway had 357 municipalities of varying size in 2024, each administered by an elected municipal council. They are grouped into 15 counties (fylker), each governed by an elected county council.\nEach county has a governor appointed by the central government, responsible for ensuring legality in their administration. The municipal sector is a provider of vital services to the Norwegian public, accounting for about 20% of Norwegian GNP and 24% of total employment. They have the right to tax and to use their resources to support education, libraries, social security, and public works such as streetcar lines, gas and electricity works, roads, and town planning, but they are usually aided in these activities by state funds.\nOslo is the only urban center that alone constitutes a county; the remaining 14 counties consist of both urban and rural areas. County and municipal councils are popularly elected every four years.\nThe municipal council (; lit.\u2009'municipal board') is the highest governing body of the municipality in Norway. Municipalities are the only unit of local government in Norway (in addition to the regional \"county\" level and the national level). The municipal council sets the scope of municipal activity, takes major decisions, and delegates responsibility. The council is led by a mayor, or , and is divided into an executive council () and a number of committees, each responsible for a subsection of tasks. It is not uncommon for some members of the council to sit in the county councils too, but very rare that they also hold national office in the Storting or Government without taking a leave of absence from the municipal council.\nThe municipal council in Norway dates back the \"Formannskapsdistrikt\" law that went into effect on 1 January 1838. Historically, the council was known as a or in rural municipalities and in urban/city municipalities. During the 1960s, the distinction between rural and urban municipalities was eliminated, however, many Norwegian cities still refer to their municipal council as a city council (\"bystyre\").\nPortugal.\nCurrently, mainland Portugal is divided into 18 districts (in Portuguese, \"distritos\"). Each district takes the name of their respective capital city. Insular Portugal, comprising the two Atlantic archipelagos of the Azores and Madeira, is organized as two autonomous regions (in Portuguese, \"regi\u00f5es aut\u00f3nomas\").\nEach district and each Autonomous region is divided into municipalities (in Portuguese, \"munic\u00edpios\") which, in turn, are subdivided into parishes (in Portuguese, \"freguesias\").\nSince 1976, when the two Autonomous regions of Portugal were established, the Azores and Madeira are no longer divided into districts.\nPoland.\nPoland has three levels of subdivision. The Polish territory is divided into 16 voivodeships (provinces); these are further divided into 379 powiats (counties or districts), and these powiats are further divided into 2,479 gminas (communes or municipalities). Major cities normally have the status of both gmina and powiat.\nEach voivodeship is jointly governed by the National-government appointed voivode and a locally elected sejmik (provincial assembly), which appoints an executive board led by a voivodeship marshal.\nRussia.\nThe Russian Federation consistes of eighty-five federal subjects that are constituent members of the Federation. However, two of these federal subjects \u2014 the Republic of Crimea and the federal city of Sevastopol\u2014are internationally recognized as part of Ukraine. All federal subjects are of equal federal rights in the sense that they have equal representation\u2014two delegates each\u2014in the Federation Council (upper house of the Federal Assembly). But they do differ in the degree of autonomy they enjoy.\nThe modern administrative-territorial structures of the federal subjects vary significantly from one federal subject to another. While the implementation details may be considerably different, in general, however, the following types of high-level administrative divisions are recognized:\nTypical lower-level administrative divisions include:\nSlovenia.\nSlovenia has only one level of local self-government established: municipalities. The https:// provides also basis for establishing second level, regions, but they haven't been established yet (Article 143).\nThere are two types of municipalities in Slovenia:\nSlovenia signed (1994) and ratified (1996) European Charter of Local Self-Government without any reservations. The Charter is in force since March 1, 1997. The Congress of Local and Regional Authorities (Council of Europe) performed three https:// (2001, 2011, and 2018).\nSpain.\nSpain is divided into 17 autonomous communities, which in turn are divided into 50 provinces. There are also two autonomous cities: those of Ceuta and Melilla. Finally, each province comprises a number of municipalities.\nEach administrative entity is given powers, structure, and boundaries by a law that was passed by the Prime Minister .\nLaw 7/1985, passed by the former Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez M\u00e1rquez (socialist), lays down the procedure of the Local Government. Every city in Spain used this Law until 2003. This year, the former Spanish Prime Minister Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar (conservative), passed a Law (57/2003) to modernize organic rules of those cities which had more than 250,000 inhabitants, and other important cities (like capital cities of provinces with at least 175,000 inhabitants). Also, it exists two other important Laws for specifically Madrid (Law 22/2006) and Barcelona (Law 1/2006). The main governing body in most municipalities is called Ayuntamiento (in the less populated municipalities an alternative local organization system called open council, \"concejo abierto\", is used). The Ayuntamiento in turn is formed by the Plenary (\"el Pleno\", the collective formed by the city councillors) and the Mayor. The number of members that compose The Plenary varies depending on city's population (for example, since 2007 Valencia has 33 members and Pamplona has 27). The name given to the members of the Plenary is councillor (\"concejal\"). Those councillors are elected between city's inhabitants every four years by direct vote. After being elected, councillors meet in a special Plenary session to determine who will be elected, between them, as city's Mayor. In the next days after the election, the mayor chooses some councillors to set up the executive governing body (\"Junta de Gobierno\" or \"Comisi\u00f3n de Gobierno\"). After that, and for the next four years, city's mayor and the \"Junta de Gobierno\" will govern over the city according to their competences (urbanism, some taxes, local police, licenses for specific activities, cleaning services, etc.). Meanwhile, councillors in the Plenary but not part of the \"Junta de Gobierno\" (the opposition) will oversee Mayor's rule.\nThe autonomous community of Catalonia is divided in 4 provinces and more than 900 municipalities. Between these two tiers, there are 41 \"comarques\" (singular, \"comarca\"), roughly equivalent to 'district' or 'county'. The \"comarca\" is a commonwealth, or union, of municipalities with competences in several fields (Law 6/1987 of the Parliament of Catalonia).\nSweden.\nEvery fourth year general elections are held in Sweden to elect members of the national parliament, 20 county council assemblies and 290 municipal assemblies. As the parliament elects the national government, the local assemblies elect their executive committees and their boards. Members in local committees and boards are elected proportionally by the political parties in the assemblies, giving all the major parties representation. The parties usually cooperate well on the local levels.\nThe county councils (\"landsting\") are responsible for health care and usually provide transportation.\nThe municipalities (\"kommuner\") are responsible for:\nOn a voluntary basis, the municipalities provide sports, culture, housing, energy as well as commercial service.\nThe activities are financed by income taxes. Swedes pay around 20% of their taxable income to the municipality and around 11% to the county council. (The national government is financed by VAT and payroll taxes and fees.)\nUkraine.\nIn Ukraine, almost all cities have their City Council, and the mayors (usually elected by people) are the chairmen of them (e.g.: Kyiv City Council, Kharkiv City Council, Odesa City Council, Lviv City Council, Chernihiv City Council).\nUnited Kingdom and dependencies.\nThe system of local government is different in each of the four home nations of the UK. In total there are 426 local authorities in the UK. 346 of these are in England, 11 in Northern Ireland, 32 in Scotland and 22 are in Wales.\nEngland.\nThe most complex system is in England, the result of numerous reforms and reorganisation over the centuries. The top-level of sub-national administration within England until the end of March 2012 consisted of the nine regions. The regions were used by central government for various statistical purposes, and Government Offices for the English Regions and assorted other institutions including Regional Development Agencies. Regional Government Offices, Regional Development Agencies and Regional Ministers were all abolished by the Cameron ministry in 2010. Only the London region which is a sub-region compared to the other regions of England has a directly elected government. Only one regional referendum has been held to date to seek consent for the introduction of direct elections elsewhere \u2014 by John Prescott in the northeast of England \u2014 and this was initially rejected by the people of the North East in 2004.\nThe layers of elected local government vary. In different areas the highest tier of elected local government may be:\nIn most areas there is a lower tier of government, civil parishes, with unlimited functions and powers under the 2011 Localism Act.\nMost civil parishes are in rural areas, but if the parish is a town the parish council may be called a town council. In a few cases the parish is a city, and the parish council is called a city council.\nMetropolitan counties, and a few non-metropolitan counties, no longer have elected councils or administrative functions, and their former functions are performed by districts. Such counties remain ceremonial counties.\nIsle of Man.\nLocal government on the Isle of Man is partly based on the ancient parishes. There are four types of local authorities: a borough corporation, town commissioners, village commissioners, and parish commissioners.\nNorthern Ireland.\nSince 1 April 2015 Northern Ireland is divided into 11 districts. Local government in Northern Ireland does not carry out the same range of functions as those in the rest of the United Kingdom.\nScotland.\nLocal government in Scotland is arranged on the lines of unitary authorities, with the nation divided into 32 council areas.\nWales.\nWales has a uniform system of 22 unitary authorities, variously styled as county, county borough, city or city and county local authorities. There are also communities, equivalent to parishes.\nThe Local Government Association (LGA) is\u202fthe\u202fnational membership body for local authorities in England and Wales. Its core membership is made up of 317 English councils and\u202fthe 22 Welsh councils through the Welsh Local Government Association. Across the UK, the Association for Public Service Excellence (APSE) also works to assist local authorities in the UK to improve their frontline services. APSE works with more than 250 local authorities \"to advise and share information and expertise on a broad range of frontline public services\".\nNorth America.\nCanada.\nIn Canada's federal system, local government is the responsibility of provincial and territorial governments. The most prominent form of local government is the municipality, which is a locally elected authority with responsibility over a variety of services, such as roads, parks, fire protection, policing, planning, libraries, transit, and waste management. The exact responsibilities, powers, and governance of municipalities varies from province to province. In British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec, municipalities operate on a two-tiered system, where lower-tier local municipalities administer some services, such as fire protection or parks, while upper-tier regional municipalities administer shared services, such as utilities, waste management, or policing. The remaining provinces and territories use a single-tier system of municipal government, where each municipality is legally independent of every other, although they may still voluntarily share services.\nIn addition to municipal government, some provinces maintain special purpose boards to govern police services, school districts, conservation authorities, or to provide certain municipal services to unincorporated areas that would not otherwise receive them.\nThe federal government regulates First Nations band governments, which deliver local services to Indigenous reserves in the country. Many band governments administer more than one reserve, and may participate in tribal councils, a form of voluntary regional organization for several band governments.\nOntario.\nTownship councils in Ontario play a similar role as city councils in cities for smaller or low tier municipalities. Directly elected every four years, the number of councillors vary depending on the size of their municipalities. The councillors' powers and responsibilities are governed by the \"Municipal Act\" of Ontario.\nManitoba.\nManitoba town council members serve primarily as a policy and direction board for the community. They consist of five to seven members with the head of council being the mayor or reeve.\nMexico.\nMexico is a Federal Republic made up by 31 states and Mexico City. Each state is divided in \"municipios\", while Mexico City is divided in sixteen (formerly called \"delegaciones\"). Twenty-nine states of Mexico were created as administrative divisions by the constitution of 1917, which grants them those powers not expressly vested in the federal government; Mexico's two remaining territories, Baja California Sur and Quintana Roo, achieved statehood on 8 October 1974, raising the total to 31. Each state has a constitution, a governor elected for six years, and a unicameral legislature, with representatives elected by district vote in proportion to population. An ordinary session of the legislature is held annually, and extraordinary sessions may be called by the governor or the permanent committee. Bills may be introduced by legislators, by the governor, by the state supreme court, and by municipalities (a unit comparable to a US county). In addition to the 31 states, there is also Mexico City, whose Head of Government serves as a member of the city's cabinet and its title is compared as a governor. Many state services are supported by federal subsidies.\nThe principal unit of state government is the municipality. Mexico's 2,378 municipalities are governed by municipal presidents and municipal councils. State governors generally select the nominees for the municipal elections. Municipal budgets are approved by the respective state governors. Until 1997, the president appointed the mayor of Mexico City. Political reforms allowed the first open elections in 1997, and Cuauht\u00e9moc Cardenas Sol\u00f3rzano became Mexico City's first elected mayor.\nUnited States.\nLocal government in the United States refers to governmental jurisdictions below the level of the state. Most states have at least two tiers of local government: counties and municipalities. In some states, counties are divided into townships. There are several different types of jurisdictions at the municipal level, including the city, town, parish, borough, village, reservations and boundaries. The types and nature of these municipal entities varies from state to state.\nCity councils and town boards generally consist of several (usually somewhere between 5 and 51) elected aldermen or councillors. In the United States, members of city councils are typically called council member, council man, council woman, councilman, or councilwoman, while in Canada they are typically called councillor.\nIn some cities, the mayor is a voting member of the council who serves as chairman; in others, the mayor is the city's independent chief executive (or strong mayor) with veto power over city council legislation. In larger cities the council may elect other executive positions as well, such as a council president and speaker.\nThe council generally functions as a parliamentary or presidential style legislative body, proposing bills, holding votes, and passing laws to help govern the city.\nThe role of the mayor in the council varies depending on whether or not the city uses council\u2013manager government or mayor\u2013council government, and by the nature of the statutory authority given to it by state law, city charter, or municipal ordinance.\nThere is also a mayor pro tem councilmember. In cities where the council elects the mayor for one year at a time, the mayor pro tem is in line to become the mayor in the next year. In cities where the mayor is elected by the city's voters, the mayor pro tem serves as acting mayor in the absence of the mayor. This position is also known as vice mayor.\nIn some cities a different name for the municipal legislature is used. In Portland, Oregon, for example, it is known as the City Commission. In San Francisco, it is known as the Board of Supervisors; San Francisco is a consolidated city-county and the California constitution requires each county to have a Board of Supervisors.\nOhio constitution allows local home rule to define any type of government via a Charter Commission including a type with no Mayor (city manager) or potentially citizen's could vote to institute a pure democracy with no council\nIndiana.\nIndiana town council members serve as both the executive and legislative branches for small communities incorporated as towns within the state. They consist of three or five members, depending upon the town's population.\nUnlike some states, Indiana council members must declare a political party affiliation, if any, when they file to run for office. Upon election in November, they are sworn in before 1 January of the following year, where they serve a four-year term. There are no state term limits affecting how many times a candidate may run for re-election to office.\nThe first meeting after an election, members of the town council hold an organising meeting, where they elect a president to set future agendas and act as an official spokesman for the town or as liaison between the town and state and county government.\nIndiana town councils work in conjunction with an elected town clerk, who manages the day-to-day business of the municipal government. As an elected official, the town clerk is solely executive in function and operates independently of the town council. But the council has final say on budgets which clerks depend upon to operate.\nIn addition to a clerk, the council can authorise the hiring of other staff to run the operations of government, including law enforcement officers, utility workers, park and recreation employees and town managers. These employees serve at the pleasure of the council.\nMassachusetts.\nTown councils in Massachusetts are essentially city councils in towns which have adopted a city form of government but prefer to retain the \"town of\" in their names. In several communities which have adopted such a government, the official name of the community is \"The City known as the Town of...\" The legislative body of a legal town in Massachusetts is a town meeting; the executive board is a board of selectmen. In addition to having the structure of a city with a mayor and council, cities in Massachusetts can enact ordinances, while towns may adopt by-laws, which are subject to the approval of the Attorney General. City ordinances are presumed to be legal unless challenged and set aside in court.\nMichigan.\nIn Michigan, there are 257 incorporated villages that are governed by village councils, which is a form of weak\u2013mayor administration. Michigan does not use \"town\" as a defined municipality, and villages are the lowest-level form of incorporated municipality. Villages are distinct from cities in that they share certain duties with their surrounding township and are not completely autonomous. Guidelines for village governments are defined in the General Law Village Act (Act 3) of 1895. Village councils consist of elected officials, including a village president, trustees, clerk, and treasurer.\nNew Hampshire.\nIn New Hampshire, the Town Council is an elected body which serves as the legislative and executive body of the town. The town is governed by a charter, which is allowed under the home rule provision of the New Hampshire Constitution (Pt I, Art. 39) and Title III of the New Hampshire Revised Statutes Annotated. The charter for a Town Council must meet the following requirements of http:// and all other applicable laws. The basic notion of home rule in New Hampshire is that local communities are not allowed to supersede the authority specifically granted to them by the state.\nOfficial Ballot Town Council.\nThe Official Ballot Town Council is a variant form of the Town Council. In the Official Ballot form of government, the town council is vested with the limited authority to vote on all matters not voted on by official ballot. The authority and restrictions on the Official Ballot town council is the same as the Town Council, except with respect to those matters specified to be voted on by official ballot. Also, the council decides what is placed on the ballot, not the registered voters.\nThe charter of the Official Ballot Town Council is required by law to specify specifically:\nThe charter also must specify whether a &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2\u20443 or &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;3\u20445 majority vote is required to approve bonds or notes, with the default being &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2\u20443.\nNew Jersey.\nIn New Jersey, under the Faulkner Act, municipalities have a variety of models of local government. The legislative branch follows the subdivision's style: city council, town council, borough council, township committee, or village council, except for Newark, New Jersey which has a municipal council.\nOhio.\nIn Ohio, the default form of municipal government organization provides limitations on the legislative body of a statutory form of government. The Ohio Revised Code does not allow the local legislative authority (council) the power to review contracts nor perform administrative duties. https:// limiting the checks &amp; balances in a statutory form of government. A charter form of government could provide the legislative body more administrative powers, change number of seats, or change required qualifications.\nThe Ohio Constitution provides for local self-government powers via a charter as defined in https:// reads as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Any municipality may frame and adopt or amend a charter for its government and may, subject to the provisions of section 3 of this article, exercise thereunder all powers of local self-government.\nSections 8 and 9 of Article XVIII provide the procedures for adoption and amendment of a municipal charter. &lt;br&gt;\nThe initial form of Municipal Government in Ohio is called Statuary because it is based on the default form outlined in the Ohio Revised Code statute https://. &lt;br&gt;\nOhio Revised code allows for a system with no Mayor and strong council, known as https://\nThe City of Kent, Ohio has a https:// of Government which: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Mayor shall be recognized as head of the City government for all ceremonial purposes, but shall have no administrative duties. (Amended 11-08-05)\nBicameralism.\nBicameral city councils were common in the United States until the 20th century, when many were abolished for cost cutting purposes and replaced with unicameral legislatures. Typically, bicameral city councils were divided into Common Councils and Boards of Aldermen, to reflect the structure of federal and state legislatures. The city of Everett, Massachusetts was the last to abolish its own bicameral city council (a seven-member Board of Aldermen and an 18-member Common Council) and replace it with an 11-member City Council, doing so with a November 8, 2011 referendum which took effect in 2014.\nExamples include:\nCentral America.\nBelize.\nThere are currently seven town councils in Belize. Each town council consists of a mayor and a number of councillors, who are directly elected in municipal elections every three years. Town councils in Belize are responsible for a range of functions, including street maintenance and lighting, drainage, refuse collection, public cemeteries, infrastructure, parks and playgrounds.\nOceania.\nAustralia.\nLocal government is the third tier of government in Australia, after federal and state.\nBecause of the differences in legislation between the states, the exact definition of a city council varies. However, it is generally only those local government areas which have been specifically granted city status (usually on a basis of population) that are entitled to refer to themselves as cities. The official title is \"Corporation of the City of ______\" or similar.\nSome of the urban areas of Australia are governed mostly by a single entity (e.g. Brisbane and other Queensland cities), while others may be controlled by a multitude of much smaller city councils. Also, some significant urban areas can be under the jurisdiction of otherwise rural local governments. Periodic re-alignments of boundaries attempt to rationalize these situations and adjust the deployment of assets and resources.\nNew Zealand.\nNew Zealand has a local government system comprising two complementary sets of local authorities\u2014regional councils and territorial authorities. There are 78 local authorities consisting of:\nSix of the territorial authorities are unitary authorities, which also have the powers of a regional council. They are Auckland Council, Nelson City Council, the Gisborne, Marlborough and Tasman district councils, and Chatham Islands Council.\nRegional council areas are based on water catchment areas, whereas territorial authorities are based on community of interest and road access. Within a regional council area there are usually many city or district councils, although city and district councils can be in multiple regional council areas.\nLocal councils in New Zealand do vary in structure, but are overseen by the government department Local Government New Zealand. For many decades until the local government reforms of 1989, a borough with more than 20,000 people could be proclaimed a city. The boundaries of councils tended to follow the edge of the built-up area, so little distinction was made between the urban area and the local government area. New Zealand's local government structural arrangements were significantly reformed by the Local Government Commission in 1989 when approximately 700 councils and special purpose bodies were amalgamated to create 87 new local authorities. As a result, the term \"city\" began to take on two meanings. The word \"city\" came to be used in a less formal sense to describe major urban areas independent of local body boundaries. Gisborne, for example, adamantly described itself as the first city in the world to see the new millennium. Gisborne is administered by a district council, but its status as a city is not generally disputed. Under the current law, the minimum population for a new city is 50,000.\nSouth America.\nArgentina.\nArgentina is a federation of 23 provinces and the federal capital of Buenos Aires. During the 19th century there was a bitter struggle between Buenos Aires and the interior provinces, and there has long been an element of tension regarding the division of powers between the central government and provincial bodies. The federal government retains control over such matters as the regulation of commerce, customs collections, currency, civil or commercial codes, or the appointment of foreign agents. The provincial governors are elected every four years.\nThe constitutional \"national intervention\" and \"state of siege\" powers of the president have been invoked frequently. The first of these powers was designed to \"guarantee the republican form of government in the provinces.\" Since the adoption of the 1853 constitution, the federal government has intervened over 200 times, mostly by presidential decree. Under this authority, provincial and municipal offices may be declared vacant, appointments annulled, and local elections supervised. Between 1966 and 1973, all local legislatures were dissolved, and provincial governors were appointed by the new president. A restoration of provincial and municipal government followed the return to constitutional government in 1973. After the March 1976 coup, the federal government again intervened to remove all provincial governors and impose direct military rule over all municipalities. Since 1983, representative local government has been in force again.\nUntil 1996, the President appointed the mayor of Buenos Aires, and by law, the president and Congress controlled any legislation that affected the city. Constitutional reforms that year led to an elected mayoral position, and a 60-member Poder Legislativo (legislative power).\nBrazil.\nBrazil is a federation consisting of 27 federative units: 26 states and one Federal District. Government exists at three levels: federal, state, and municipal. The states are subdivided into 5,570 municipalities, while the Federal District has no municipalities (divided into administrative regions instead) and has powers of both a state and a municipality..\nMunicipal government consists of an executive branch headed by a mayor (\"Prefeito/Prefeita\"), and a legislative branch (\"C\u00e2mara Municipal),\" serving four-year terms\".\" Municipalities are enshrined in the constitution of 1988 as entities of the federation; their responsibilities are distinct from the other two levels in theory, but overlap in practice (e.g. education, health, transportation). With their broad powers, municipalities may create their own constitutions, termed organic law, and cannot be overruled by state governments.\nElections at the municipal level follow a similar, partisan system to state and federal elections, but take place in different years. Municipalities may have anywhere from 9 to 55 members of the \"C\u00e2mara Municipal\", depending on the population. There is no minimum or maximum population requirement for municipalities: while the average population of a municipality in 2005 was 30,099, Bor\u00e1, S\u00e3o Paulo state (the least populous) had only 823 inhabitants, while S\u00e3o Paulo (the largest) had 10.9 million inhabitants. Municipalities within a state may choose to merge or separate with approval in a plebiscite and enacting of a state law.\nParaguay.\nParaguay is divided into 17 departments, which are subdivided into districts, which, in turn, comprise municipalities (the minimum requirement for a municipality is 3,000 persons) and rural districts (partidos). A governor, elected by popular vote, runs each department. Municipal government is exercised through a municipal board, chosen by direct election, and an executive department. In the principal cities and capitals, the executive department is headed by a mayor appointed by the minister of the interior; in other localities, the mayor is appointed by the presidents of the municipal boards. Police chiefs are appointed by the central government.\nPeru.\nPeru is divided into 25 regions and the province of Lima. Each region has an elected government composed of a president and council that serve four-year terms. These governments plan regional development, execute public investment projects, promote economic activities, and manage public property. The province of Lima is administered by a city council. The goal of devolving power to regional and municipal governments was among others to improve popular participation. NGOs played an important role in the decentralisation process and still influence local politics.\nUruguay.\nUruguay's administrative subdivisions consisted of nineteen territories called departments and governed by intendencias, which were subordinate to the central government and responsible for local administration. They enforced national laws and administered the nation's social and educational policies and institutions within their territories. These territories had limited taxing powers, but they could borrow funds and acquire property. They also had the power to establish unpaid five-member local boards or town councils in municipalities other than the departmental capital if the population was large enough to warrant such a body.\nExecutive authority was vested in a governor (intendente), who administered the department, and in a thirty-one-member departmental board (junta departmental), which carried out legislative functions. These functions included approval of the departmental budget and judicial actions, such as impeachment proceedings against departmental officials, including the governor. At the municipal level, a mayor (intendente municipal) assumed executive and administrative duties, carrying out resolutions made by the local board (whose members were appointed on the basis of proportional representation of the political parties). The governor was required to comply with and enforce the constitution and the laws and to promulgate the decrees enacted by the departmental board. The governor was authorized to prepare the budget, submit it for approval to the departmental board, appoint the board's employees, and, if necessary, discipline or suspend them. The governor represented the department in its relations with the national government and other departmental governments and in the negotiation of contracts with public or private agencies.\nLike the governor, the members of the departmental board and the mayor were elected for five-year terms in direct, popular elections. A governor could be reelected only once, and candidates for the post had to meet the same requirements as those for a senator, in addition to being a native of the department or a resident therein for at least three years before assuming office. Departmental board members had to be at least twenty-three years of age, native born (or a legal citizen for at least three years), and a native of the department (or a resident for at least three years).\nThe board sat in the capital city of each department and exercised jurisdiction throughout the entire territory of the department. It could issue decrees and resolutions that it deemed necessary either on the suggestion of the governor or on its own initiative. It could approve budgets, fix the amount of taxes, request the intervention of the Accounts Tribunal for advice concerning departmental finances or administration, and remove from office\u2014at the request of the governor\u2014members of nonelective local departmental boards. The board also supervised local public services; public health; and primary, secondary, preparatory, industrial, and artistic education. Although Montevideo was the smallest department in terms of area (divided into twenty-three geographic zones that generally coincided with the electoral zones), its departmental board had sixty-five members in 1990; all other departments had thirty-one-member boards and a five-member executive council appointed by the departmental board, with proportional representation from the principal political parties.\nData as of December 1990\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The condition results in the partial or complete inability of cells to respond to androgens. This unresponsiveness can impair or prevent the development of male genitals, as well as impairing or preventing the development of male secondary sexual characteristics at puberty. It does not significantly impair female genital or sexual development. The insensitivity to androgens is therefore clinically significant only when it occurs in genetic males, (i.e. individuals with a Y-chromosome, or more specifically, an SRY gene). Clinical phenotypes in these individuals range from a typical male habitus with mild spermatogenic defect or reduced secondary terminal hair, to a full female habitus, despite the presence of a Y-chromosome.\nAIS is divided into three categories that are differentiated by the degree of genital masculinization:\nAndrogen insensitivity syndrome is the largest single entity that leads to 46,XY undermasculinized genitalia.\nManagement of AIS is currently limited to symptomatic management; no method is currently available to correct the malfunctioning androgen receptor proteins produced by \"AR\" gene mutations. Areas of management include sex assignment, genitoplasty, gonadectomy to reduce tumor risk, hormone replacement therapy, genetic counseling, and psychological counseling.\nGenetics.\nThe human androgen receptor (AR) is a protein encoded by a gene located on the proximal long arm of the X chromosome (locus Xq11-Xq12). The protein coding region consists of approximately 2,757 nucleotides spanning eight exons. Like other nuclear receptors, the AR protein consists of several functional domains: the transactivation domain (also called the transcription-regulation domain or the NH2-terminal domain), the DNA-binding domain, the hinge region, and the steroid-binding domain (also called the carboxyl-terminal ligand-binding domain). The transactivation domain is encoded by exon 1, and makes up more than half of the AR protein. Exons 2 and 3 encode the DNA-binding domain, while the 5' portion of exon 4 encodes the hinge region. The remainder of exons 4 through 8 encodes the ligand binding domain.\nTrinucleotide satellite lengths and AR transcriptional activity.\nThe AR gene contains two polymorphic trinucleotide microsatellites in exon 1. The first microsatellite (nearest the 5' end) contains 8 to 60 repetitions of the glutamine codon \"CAG\" and is thus known as the polyglutamine tract. The second microsatellite contains 4 to 31 repetitions of the glycine codon \"GGC\" and is known as the polyglycine tract. The average number of repetitions varies by ethnicity, with Caucasians exhibiting an average of 21 CAG repeats, and Blacks 18. In men, disease states are associated with extremes in polyglutamine tract length; prostate cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and intellectual disability are associated with too few repetitions, while spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is associated with a CAG repetition length of 40 or more. Some studies indicate that the length of the polyglutamine tract is inversely correlated with transcriptional activity in the AR protein, and that longer polyglutamine tracts may be associated with male infertility and undermasculinized genitalia in men. However, other studies have indicated no such correlation exists. A comprehensive meta-analysis of the subject published in 2007 supports the existence of the correlation, and concluded these discrepancies could be resolved when sample size and study design are taken into account. Some studies suggest longer polyglycine tract lengths are also associated with genital masculinization defects in men. Other studies find no such association.\nAR mutations.\nAs of 2010, over 400 \"AR\" mutations have been reported in the \"AR\" mutation database, and the number continues to grow. Inheritance is typically maternal and follows an X-linked recessive pattern; individuals with a 46,XY karyotype always express the mutant gene since they have only one X chromosome, whereas 46,XX carriers are minimally affected. About 30% of the time, the \"AR\" mutation is a spontaneous result, and is not inherited. Such \"de novo\" mutations are the result of a germ cell mutation or germ cell mosaicism in the gonads of one of the parents, or a mutation in the fertilized egg itself. In one study, three of eight \"de novo\" mutations occurred in the postzygotic stage, leading to the estimate that up to one-third of \"de novo\" mutations result in somatic mosaicism. Not every mutation of the \"AR\" gene results in androgen insensitivity; one particular mutation occurs in 8 to 14% of genetic males, and is thought to adversely affect only a small number of individuals when other genetic factors are present.\nOther causes.\nSome individuals with CAIS or PAIS do not have any \"AR\" mutations despite clinical, hormonal, and histological features sufficient to warrant an AIS diagnosis; up to 5% of women with CAIS do not have an \"AR\" mutation, as well as between 27 and 72% of individuals with PAIS.\nIn one patient, the underlying cause for presumptive PAIS was a mutant steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) protein. In another patient, CAIS was the result of a deficit in the transmission of a transactivating signal from the N-terminal region of the androgen receptor to the basal transcription machinery of the cell. A coactivator protein interacting with the activation function 1 (AF-1) transactivation domain of the androgen receptor may have been deficient in this patient. The signal disruption could not be corrected by supplementation with any coactivators known at the time, nor was the absent coactivator protein characterized, which left some in the field unconvinced that a mutant coactivator would explain the mechanism of androgen resistance in CAIS or PAIS patients with a typical \"AR\" gene.\nXY karyotype.\nDepending on the mutation, a person with a 46,XY karyotype and AIS can have either a male (MAIS) or female (CAIS) phenotype, or may have genitalia that are only partially masculinized (PAIS). The gonads are testes regardless of phenotype due to the influence of the Y chromosome. A 46,XY female, thus, does not have ovaries, and can not contribute an egg towards conception. In some cases, 46, XY females do form a vestigial uterus and have been able to gestate children. Such examples are rare and have required the use of an egg donor, hormone therapy, and IVF.\nSeveral case studies of fertile 46,XY males with AIS have been published, although this group is thought to be a minority. In some cases, infertile males with MAIS have been able to conceive children after increasing their sperm count through the use of supplementary testosterone.\nA genetic male conceived by a man with AIS would not receive his father's X chromosome, thus would neither inherit nor carry the gene for the syndrome. A genetic female conceived in such a way would receive her father's X chromosome, thus would become a carrier.\nXX karyotype.\nGenetic females (46,XX karyotype) have two X chromosomes, thus have two \"AR\" genes. A mutation in one (but not both) results in a minimally affected, fertile, female carrier. Some carriers have been noted to have slightly reduced body hair, delayed puberty, and/or tall stature, presumably due to skewed X-inactivation. A female carrier will pass the affected \"AR\" gene to her children 50% of the time. If the affected child is a genetic female, she, too, will be a carrier. An affected 46,XY child will have AIS.\nA genetic female with mutations in both \"AR\" genes could theoretically result from the union of a fertile man with AIS and a female carrier of the gene, or from \"de novo\" mutation. However, given the scarcity of fertile AIS men and low incidence of \"AR\" mutation, the chances of this occurrence are small. The phenotype of such an individual is a matter of speculation; as of 2010, no such documented case has been published.\nCorrelation of genotype and phenotype.\nIndividuals with partial AIS, unlike those with the complete or mild forms, present at birth with ambiguous genitalia, and the decision to raise the child as male or female is often not obvious. Unfortunately, little information regarding phenotype can be gleaned from precise knowledge of the \"AR\" mutation itself; the same \"AR \"mutation may cause significant variation in the degree of masculinization in different individuals, even among members of the same family. Exactly what causes this variation is not entirely understood, although factors contributing to it could include the lengths of the polyglutamine and polyglycine tracts, sensitivity to and variations in the intrauterine endocrine milieu, the effect of coregulatory proteins active in Sertoli cells, somatic mosaicism, expression of the \"5RD2\" gene in genital skin fibroblasts, reduced \"AR\" transcription and translation from factors other than mutations in the AR coding region, an unidentified coactivator protein, enzyme deficiencies such as 21-hydroxylase deficiency, or other genetic variations such as a mutant steroidogenic factor-1 protein. The degree of variation, however, does not appear to be constant across all \"AR\" mutations, and is much more extreme in some. Missense mutations that result in a single amino acid substitution are known to produce the most phenotypic diversity.\nPathophysiology.\nAndrogens and the androgen receptor.\nThe effects that androgens have on the human body (virilization, masculinization, anabolism, etc.) are not brought about by androgens themselves, but rather are the result of androgens bound to androgen receptors; the androgen receptor mediates the effects of androgens in the human body. Likewise, the androgen receptor itself is generally inactive in the cell until androgen binding occurs.\nThe following series of steps illustrates how androgens and the androgen receptor work together to produce androgenic effects:\nIn this way, androgens bound to androgen receptors regulate the expression of target genes, thus produce androgenic effects.\nTheoretically, certain mutant androgen receptors can function without androgens; \"in vitro\" studies have demonstrated that a mutant androgen receptor protein can induce transcription in the absence of androgen if its steroid binding domain is deleted. Conversely, the steroid-binding domain may act to repress the AR transactivation domain, perhaps due to the AR's unliganded conformation.\nAndrogens in fetal development.\nHuman embryos develop similarly for the first six weeks, regardless of genetic sex (46,XX or 46,XY karyotype); the only way to tell the difference between 46,XX or 46,XY embryos during this time period is to look for Barr bodies or a Y chromosome. The gonads begin as bulges of tissue called the genital ridges at the back of the abdominal cavity, near the midline. By the fifth week, the genital ridges differentiate into an outer cortex and an inner medulla, and are called indifferent gonads. By the sixth week, the indifferent gonads begin to differentiate according to genetic sex. If the karyotype is 46,XY, testes develop due to the influence of the Y chromosome's \"SRY\" gene. This process does not require the presence of androgen, nor a functional androgen receptor.\nUntil around the seventh week of development, the embryo has indifferent sex accessory ducts, which consist of two pairs of ducts: the M\u00fcllerian ducts and the Wolffian ducts. Sertoli cells within the testes secrete anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone around this time to suppress the development of the M\u00fcllerian ducts, and cause their degeneration. Without this anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone, the M\u00fcllerian ducts develop into the female internal genitalia (uterus, cervix, fallopian tubes, and upper vaginal barrel). Unlike the M\u00fcllerian ducts, the Wolffian ducts will not continue to develop by default. In the presence of testosterone and functional androgen receptors, the Wolffian ducts develop into the epididymides, vasa deferentia, and seminal vesicles. If the testes fail to secrete testosterone, or the androgen receptors do not function properly, the Wolffian ducts degenerate.\nMasculinization of the male external genitalia (the penis, penile urethra, and scrotum), as well as the prostate, are dependent on the androgen dihydrotestosterone. Testosterone is converted into dihydrotestosterone by the 5-alpha reductase enzyme. If this enzyme is absent or deficient, then dihydrotestosterone is not created, and the external male genitalia do not develop properly. As is the case with the internal male genitalia, a functional androgen receptor is needed for dihydrotestosterone to regulate the transcription of target genes involved in development.\nPathogenesis of AIS.\nMutations in the androgen receptor gene can cause problems with any of the steps involved in androgenization, from the synthesis of the androgen receptor protein itself, through the transcriptional ability of the dimerized, androgen-AR complex. AIS can result if even one of these steps is significantly disrupted, as each step is required for androgens to activate the AR successfully and regulate gene expression. Exactly which steps a particular mutation will impair can be predicted, to some extent, by identifying the area of the AR in which the mutation resides. This predictive ability is primarily retrospective in origin; the different functional domains of the AR gene have been elucidated by analyzing the effects of specific mutations in different regions of the AR. For example, mutations in the steroid binding domain have been known to affect androgen binding affinity or retention, mutations in the hinge region have been known to affect nuclear translocation, mutations in the DNA-binding domain have been known to affect dimerization and binding to target DNA, and mutations in the transactivation domain have been known to affect target gene transcription regulation. Unfortunately, even when the affected functional domain is known, predicting the phenotypical consequences of a particular mutation (see Correlation of genotype and phenotype) is difficult.\nSome mutations can adversely impact more than one functional domain. For example, a mutation in one functional domain can have deleterious effects on another by altering the way in which the domains interact. A single mutation can affect all downstream functional domains if a premature stop codon or framing error results; such a mutation can result in a completely unusable (or unsynthesizable) androgen receptor protein. The steroid binding domain is particularly vulnerable to the effects of a premature stop codon or framing error, since it occurs at the end of the gene, and its information is thus more likely to be truncated or misinterpreted than other functional domains.\nOther, more complex relationships have been observed as a consequence of mutated \"AR\"; some mutations associated with male phenotypes have been linked to male breast cancer, prostate cancer, or in the case of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, disease of the central nervous system. The form of breast cancer seen in some men with PAIS is caused by a mutation in the AR's DNA-binding domain. This mutation is thought to cause a disturbance of the AR's target gene interaction that allows it to act at certain additional targets, possibly in conjunction with the estrogen receptor protein, to cause cancerous growth. The pathogenesis of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) demonstrates that even the mutant AR protein itself can result in pathology. The trinucleotide repeat expansion of the polyglutamine tract of the AR gene that is associated with SBMA results in the synthesis of a misfolded AR protein that the cell fails to proteolyze and disperse properly. These misfolded AR proteins form aggregates in the cell cytoplasm and nucleus. Over the course of 30 to 50 years, these aggregates accumulate and have a cytotoxic effect, eventually resulting in the neurodegenerative symptoms associated with SBMA.\nDiagnosis.\nThe phenotypes that result from the insensitivity to androgens are not unique to AIS, thus the diagnosis of AIS requires thorough exclusion of other causes. Clinical findings indicative of AIS include the presence of a short vagina or undermasculinized genitalia, partial or complete regression of M\u00fcllerian structures, bilateral nondysplastic testes, and impaired spermatogenesis and/or virilization. Laboratory findings include a 46,XY karyotype and typical or elevated postpubertal testosterone, luteinizing hormone, and estradiol levels. The androgen binding activity of genital skin fibroblasts is typically diminished, although exceptions have been reported. Conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone may be impaired. The diagnosis of AIS is confirmed if androgen receptor gene sequencing reveals a mutation, although not all individuals with AIS (particularly PAIS) will have an \"AR\" mutation (see Other Causes).\nEach of the three types of AIS (complete, partial, and mild) has a different list of differential diagnoses to consider. However, cases have been reported of individuals with both AIS and certain diagnoses listed here, such as Klinefelter syndrome or Turner syndrome with mosaicism. Depending on the form of AIS suspected, the list of differentials can include:\nClassification.\nAIS is broken down into three classes based on phenotype: complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS), partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS), and mild androgen insensitivity syndrome (MAIS). A supplemental system of phenotypic grading that uses seven classes instead of the traditional three was proposed by pediatric endocrinologist Charmian A. Quigley et al. in 1995. The first six grades of the scale, grades 1 through 6, are differentiated by the degree of genital masculinization; grade 1 is indicated when the external genitalia is fully masculinized, grade 6 is indicated when the external genitalia is fully feminized, and grades 2 through 5 quantify four degrees of decreasingly masculinized genitalia that lie in the interim. Grade 7 is indistinguishable from grade 6 until puberty, and is thereafter differentiated by the presence of secondary terminal hair; grade 6 is indicated when secondary terminal hair is present, whereas grade 7 is indicated when it is absent. The Quigley scale can be used in conjunction with the traditional three classes of AIS to provide additional information regarding the degree of genital masculinization, and is particularly useful when the diagnosis is PAIS.\nManagement.\nManagement of AIS is currently limited to symptomatic management; no method is currently available to correct the malfunctioning androgen receptor proteins produced by \"AR\" gene mutations. Areas of management include sex assignment, genitoplasty, gonadectomy in relation to tumor risk, hormone replacement therapy, genetic counseling, and psychological counseling.\nEpidemiology.\nAIS represents about 15% to 20% of DSDs and affects 1 in 20,000 to 1 in 64,000 males.\nEstimates for the incidence of androgen insensitivity syndrome are based on a relatively small population size, thus are known to be imprecise. CAIS is estimated to occur in one of every 20,400 46,XY births. A nationwide survey in the Netherlands based on patients with genetic confirmation of the diagnosis estimates that the minimal incidence of CAIS is one in 99,000. The incidence of PAIS is estimated to be one in 130,000. Due to its subtle presentation, MAIS is not typically investigated except in the case of male infertility, thus its true prevalence is unknown.\nControversy.\nPreimplantation genetic diagnosis.\nPreimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD or PIGD) refers to genetic profiling of embryos prior to implantation (as a form of embryo profiling), and sometimes even of oocytes prior to fertilization. When used to screen for a specific genetic sequence, its main advantage is that it avoids selective pregnancy termination, as the method makes it highly likely that a selected embryo will be free of the condition under consideration.\nIn the UK, AIS appears on a list of serious genetic diseases that may be screened for via PGD. Some ethicists, clinicians, and intersex advocates have argued that screening embryos to specifically exclude intersex traits is based on social and cultural norms as opposed to medical necessity.\nHistory.\nRecorded descriptions of the effects of AIS date back hundreds of years, although significant understanding of its underlying histopathology did not occur until the 1950s. The taxonomy and nomenclature associated with androgen insensitivity went through a significant evolution that paralleled this understanding.\nEarly terminology.\nThe first descriptions of the effects of AIS appeared in the medical literature as individual case reports or as part of a comprehensive description of intersex physicalities. In 1779, William Hunter studied a few freemartins. One of them, \"Mr. Wright's Free-Martin\" was likely not a freemartin, but a case of testicular feminization. In 1839, Scottish obstetrician Sir James Young Simpson published one such description in an exhaustive study of intersexuality that has been credited with advancing the medical community's understanding of the subject. Simpson's system of taxonomy, however, was far from the first; taxonomies or descriptions for the classification of intersexuality were developed by Italian physician and physicist Fortun\u00e9 Affaitati in 1549, French surgeon Ambroise Par\u00e9 in 1573, French physician and sexology pioneer Nicolas Venette in 1687 (under the pseudonym V\u00e9nitien Salocini), and French zoologist Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire in 1832. All five of these authors used the colloquial term \"hermaphrodite\" as the foundation of their taxonomies, although Simpson himself questioned the propriety of the word in his publication. Use of the word \"hermaphrodite\" in the medical literature has persisted to this day, although its propriety is still in question. An alternative system of nomenclature has been recently suggested, but the subject of exactly which word or words should be used in its place still one of much debate.\nPseudohermaphroditism.\n\"Pseudohermaphroditism\" has, until very recently, been the term used in the medical literature to describe the condition of an individual whose gonads do not match the expected external genitalia in of their sex. For example, 46,XY individuals who have a female phenotype, but also have testes instead of ovaries\u2014a group that includes all individuals with CAIS, as well as some individuals with PAIS\u2014are classified as having \"male pseudohermaphroditism\", while individuals with both an ovary and a testis (or at least one ovotestis) are classified as having \"true hermaphroditism\". Use of the word in the medical literature antedates the discovery of the chromosome, thus its definition has not always taken karyotype into account when determining an individual's sex. Previous definitions of \"pseudohermaphroditism\" relied on perceived inconsistencies between the internal and external organs; the \"true\" sex of an individual was determined by the internal organs, and the external organs determined the \"perceived\" sex of an individual.\nGerman-Swiss pathologist Edwin Klebs is sometimes noted for using the word \"pseudohermaphroditism\" in his taxonomy of intersexuality in 1876, although the word is clearly not his invention as is sometimes reported; the history of the word \"pseudohermaphrodite\" and the corresponding desire to separate \"true\" hermaphrodites from \"false\", \"spurious\", or \"pseudo\" hermaphrodites, dates back to at least 1709, when Dutch anatomist Frederik Ruysch used it in a publication describing a subject with testes and a mostly female phenotype. \"Pseudohermaphrodite\" also appeared in the \"Acta Eruditorum\" later that same year, in a review of Ruysch's work. Also some evidence indicates the word was already being used by the German and French medical community long before Klebs used it; German physiologist Johannes Peter M\u00fcller equated \"pseudohermaphroditism\" with a subclass of hermaphroditism from Saint-Hilaire's taxonomy in a publication dated 1834, and by the 1840s \"pseudohermaphroditism\" was appearing in several French and German publications, including dictionaries.\nTesticular feminization.\nIn 1953, American gynecologist John Morris provided the first full description of what he called \"testicular feminization syndrome\" based on 82 cases compiled from the medical literature, including two of his own patients. The term \"testicular feminization\" was coined to reflect Morris' observation that the testicles in these patients produced a hormone that had a feminizing effect on the body, a phenomenon now understood to be due to the inaction of androgens, and subsequent aromatization of testosterone into estrogen. A few years before Morris published his landmark paper, Lawson Wilkins had shown through experiment that unresponsiveness of the target cell to the action of androgenic hormones was a cause of \"male pseudohermaphroditism\". Wilkins' work, which clearly demonstrated the lack of a therapeutic effect when 46,XY patients were treated with androgens, caused a gradual shift in nomenclature from \"testicular feminization\" to \"androgen resistance\".\nOther names.\nA distinct name has been given to many of the various presentations of AIS, such as Reifenstein syndrome (1947), Goldberg-Maxwell syndrome (1948), Morris' syndrome (1953), Gilbert-Dreyfus syndrome (1957), Lub's syndrome (1959), \"incomplete testicular feminization\" (1963), Rosewater syndrome (1965), and Aiman's syndrome (1979). Since it was not understood that these different presentations were all caused by the same set of mutations in the androgen receptor gene, a unique name was given to each new combination of symptoms, resulting in a complicated stratification of seemingly disparate disorders.\nOver the last 60 years, as reports of strikingly different phenotypes were reported to occur even among members of the same family, and as steady progress was made towards the understanding of the underlying molecular pathogenesis of AIS, these disorders were found to be different phenotypic expressions of one syndrome caused by molecular defects in the androgen receptor gene.\nAIS is now the accepted terminology for the syndromes resulting from unresponsiveness of the target cell to the action of androgenic hormones. CAIS encompasses the phenotypes previously described by \"testicular feminization\", Morris' syndrome, and Goldberg-Maxwell syndrome; PAIS includes Reifenstein syndrome, Gilbert-Dreyfus syndrome, Lub's syndrome, \"incomplete testicular feminization\", and Rosewater syndrome; and MAIS includes Aiman's syndrome.\nThe more virilized phenotypes of AIS have sometimes been described as \"undervirilized male syndrome\", \"infertile male syndrome\", \"undervirilized fertile male syndrome\", etc., before evidence was reported that these conditions were caused by mutations in the \"AR\" gene. These diagnoses were used to describe a variety of mild defects in virilization; as a result, the phenotypes of some men who have been diagnosed as such are better described by PAIS (e.g. micropenis, hypospadias, and undescended testes), while others are better described by MAIS (e.g. isolated male infertility or gynecomastia).\nSociety and culture.\nIn the film \"Orchids, My Intersex Adventure\", Phoebe Hart and her sister Bonnie Hart, both women with CAIS, documented their exploration of AIS and other intersex issues.\nRecording artist Dalea is a Hispanic-American Activist who is public about her CAIS. She has given interviews about her condition and founded Girl Comet, a non-profit diversity awareness and inspiration initiative.\nIn 2017, fashion model Hanne Gaby Odiele disclosed that they were born with androgen insensitivity syndrome. As a child, they underwent medical procedures relating to the condition, which they said took place without their or their parents' informed consent. They were told about their intersex condition weeks before beginning their modelling career.\nIn the 1991 Japanese horror novel \"Ring\" and its sequels, by Koji Suzuki (later adapted into Japanese, Korean, and American films), the central antagonist Sadako has this syndrome, as revealed by Dr Nagao when confronted by Ryuji and Asakawa. Sadako's condition is referred to by the earlier name \"testicular feminisation syndrome\".\nIn season 2, episode 13 (\"Skin Deep\") of the TV series \"House\", the main patient's cancerous testicle is mistaken for an ovary due to the patient's undiscovered CAIS. The episode has been criticized for its medical inaccuracy as well as its stigmatizing and offensive portrayal of CAIS.\nIn season 2 of the MTV series \"Faking It\", a character has CAIS. The character, Lauren Cooper, played by Bailey De Young, was the first intersex series regular on American television.\nIn , episode 11 (\"Delko for the Defense\") of the , the primary suspect has AIS which gets him off a rape charge.\nIn series 8, episode 5 of \"Call the Midwife\", a woman discovers that she has AIS. She attends a cervical smear and brings up that she has never had a period, and is concerned about having children as she is about to be married. She is then diagnosed with \"testicular feminisation syndrome\", the old term for AIS.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "52790", "revid": "635492", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52790", "title": "Alexander Pushkin", "text": "Russian poet, playwright and novelist (1799\u20131837)\nAlexander Sergeyevich Pushkin (6\u00a0June\u00a0[O.S. 26 May]\u00a01799\u00a0\u2013 10 February\u00a0[O.S. 29 January]\u00a01837) was a Russian poet, playwright, and novelist of the Romantic era. He is considered by many to be the greatest Russian poet, as well as the founder of modern Russian literature.\nPushkin was born into the Russian nobility in Moscow. His father, Sergey Lvovich Pushkin, belonged to an old noble family. One of his maternal great-grandfathers was Abram Petrovich Gannibal, a nobleman of African origin who was kidnapped from his homeland by the Ottomans, then freed by the Russian Emperor and raised in the Emperor's court household as his godson.\nHe published his first poem at the age of 15, and was widely recognized by the literary establishment by the time of his graduation from the Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum. Upon graduation from the Lyc\u00e9e, Pushkin recited his controversial poem \"Ode to Liberty\", one of several that led to his exile by Emperor Alexander I. While under strict surveillance by the Emperor's political police and unable to publish, Pushkin wrote his most famous play, \"Boris Godunov\". His novel in verse \"Eugene Onegin\" was serialized between 1825 and 1832. Pushkin was fatally wounded in a duel with his wife's alleged lover (her sister's husband), Georges-Charles de Heeckeren d'Anth\u00e8s, also known as Dantes-Gekkern, a French officer serving with the Chevalier Guard Regiment.\nAncestry.\nPushkin's father, Sergei Lvovich Pushkin (1767\u20131848), was descended from a distinguished family of the Russian nobility that traced its ancestry back to the 12th century. Pushkin's mother, Nadezhda (Nadya) Ossipovna Gannibal (1775\u20131836), was descended through her paternal grandmother from German and Scandinavian nobility. She was the daughter of Ossip Abramovich Gannibal (1744\u20131807) and his wife, Maria Alekseyevna Pushkina (1745\u20131818).\nOssip Abramovich Gannibal's father, Pushkin's great-grandfather, was Abram Petrovich Gannibal (1696\u20131781), an African page kidnapped and taken to Constantinople as a gift for the Ottoman Sultan and later transferred to Russia as a gift for Peter the Great. Abram wrote in a letter to Empress Elizabeth, Peter the Great's daughter, that Gannibal was from the town of \"Lagon\", largely on the basis of a mythical biography by Gannibal's son-in-law Rotkirch.\nVladimir Nabokov, when researching \"Eugene Onegin\", cast serious doubt on this origin theory. Later research by the scholars Dieudonn\u00e9 Gnammankou and Hugh Barnes eventually conclusively established that Gannibal was instead born in Central Africa, in an area bordering Lake Chad in modern-day Cameroon. After education in France as a military engineer, Gannibal became governor of Reval and eventually G\u00e9n\u00e9ral en Chief (the third most senior army rank) in charge of the building of sea forts and canals in Russia.\nEarly life.\nBorn in Moscow, Pushkin was entrusted to nursemaids and French tutors, and spoke mostly French until the age of ten. He became acquainted with the Russian language through communication with household serfs and his nanny, Arina Rodionovna, whom he loved dearly and to whom he was more attached than to his own mother.\nHe published his first poem at the age of 15. When he finished school, as part of the first graduating class of the prestigious Imperial Lyceum in Tsarskoye Selo, near Saint Petersburg, his talent was already widely recognized on the Russian literary scene. At the Lyceum, he was a student of David Mara, known in Russia as David de Boudry, a younger brother of French revolutionary Jean-Paul Marat. After school, Pushkin plunged into the vibrant and raucous intellectual youth culture of St. Petersburg, which was then the capital of the Russian Empire. In 1820, he published his first long poem, \"Ruslan and Ludmila\", with much controversy about its subject and style.\nSocial activism.\nWhile at the Lyceum, Pushkin was heavily influenced by the Kantian liberal individualist teachings of Alexander Kunitsyn, whom Pushkin would later commemorate in his poem \"19 October\". Pushkin also immersed himself in the thought of the French Enlightenment, to which he would remain permanently indebted throughout his life, especially Voltaire, whom he described as \"the first to follow the new road, and to bring the lamp of philosophy into the dark archives of history\".\nPushkin gradually became committed to social reform, and emerged as a spokesman for literary radicals. That angered the government and led to his transfer from the capital in May 1820. He went to the Caucasus and to Crimea and then to Kamianka and Chi\u0219in\u0103u in Bessarabia.\nHe joined the Filiki Eteria, a secret organization whose purpose was to overthrow Ottoman rule in Greece and establish an independent Greek state. He was inspired by the Greek Revolution and when the war against the Ottoman Empire broke out, he kept a diary recording the events of the national uprising.\nRise.\nHe stayed in Chi\u0219in\u0103u until 1823 and wrote two Romantic poems which brought him acclaim: \"The Prisoner of the Caucasus\" and \"The Fountain of Bakhchisaray\". In 1823, Pushkin moved to Odessa, where he again clashed with the government, which sent him into exile on his mother's rural estate of Mikhailovskoye, near Pskov, from 1824 to 1826.\nIn Mikhailovskoye, Pushkin wrote nostalgic love poems which he dedicated to Elizaveta Vorontsova, wife of Novorossiya's General-Governor. Then Pushkin worked on his verse-novel \"Eugene Onegin\".\nIn Mikhailovskoye, in 1825, Pushkin wrote the poem \"To***\". It is generally believed that he dedicated this poem to Anna Kern, but there are other opinions. Poet Mikhail Dudin believed that the poem was dedicated to the serf Olga Kalashnikova. Pushkinist Kira Victorova believed that the poem was dedicated to the Empress Elizaveta Alekseyevna. Vadim Nikolayev argued that the idea about the Empress was marginal and refused to discuss it, while trying to prove that poem had been dedicated to Tatyana Larina, the heroine of \"Eugene Onegin\". During that same year (1825) Pushkin also wrote what would become his most famous play, the drama \"Boris Godunov\", while at his mother's estate. He could not, however, gain permission to publish it until five years later. The original and uncensored version of the drama was not staged until 2007.\nAuthorities summoned Pushkin to Moscow after his poem \"Ode to Liberty\" was found among the belongings of the rebels from the Decembrist Uprising (1825). After his exile in 1820 Pushkin's friends and family continually petitioned for his release, sending letters and meeting Emperor Alexander I and then Emperor Nicholas I on the heels of the Decembrist Uprising. Many of the Decembrists were his friends and fellow writers; Pushkin was known widely for his belief in freedom from political and moral oppression, but the Decembrists did not trust him because \u201che had a big mouth\u201d and was known to be impulsive and egotistical.\nUpon meeting Emperor Nicholas I Pushkin obtained his release from exile and began to work as the emperor's Titular Counsel of the National Archives. However, because insurgents in the Decembrist Uprising (1825) in Saint Petersburg had kept some of Pushkin's earlier political poems, the emperor retained strict control of everything Pushkin published and he was banned from travelling at will.\nPushkin\u2019s conversation with Nicholas I is not known to us, and it can only be restored from Pushkin\u2019s later statements. After this conversation Pushkin became a supporter of Nicholas I. It was not the betrayal of Pushkin\u2019s social ideals, it was his confidence that in the personality of Nicholas I Russia had a conductor of those events that put it forward in the direction dictated precisely by these social ideals, joined by a feeling of personal gratitude to Nicholas, who had freed the poet from exile. This attitude was vividly expressed in the stanzas: \u201cNo, I am not a flatterer when I compose free praise to the Tsar\u201d. Pushkin's patriotic poem \"To the Slanderers of Russia\" written during the 1830\u20131831 Polish uprising aroused hostility among some of the Russian liberals.\nAround 1825\u20131829 he met and befriended the Polish poet Adam Mickiewicz, during exile in central Russia. In 1829 he travelled through the Caucasus to Erzurum to visit friends fighting in the Russian army during the Russo-Turkish War. At the end of 1829 Pushkin wanted to set off on a journey abroad, the desire reflected in his poem \"Let's go, I'm ready\". He applied for permission for the journey but received negative response from Nicholas I on 17 January 1830.\nAround 1828 Pushkin met Natalia Goncharova, then 16 years old and one of the most talked-about beauties of Moscow. After much hesitation Natalia accepted a proposal of marriage from Pushkin in April 1830, but not before she received assurances that the Tsarist government had no intention of persecuting the libertarian poet. Later Pushkin and his wife became regulars of court society. They officially became engaged on 6 May 1830 and sent out wedding invitations. Owing to an outbreak of cholera and other circumstances, the wedding was delayed for a year. The ceremony took place on 18 February 1831 (Old Style) in the Great Ascension Church on Bolshaya Nikitskaya Street in Moscow.\nPushkin's marriage to Goncharova was largely a happy one, but his wife\u2019s characteristic flirtatiousness and frivolity would lead to his fatal duel seven years later, for Pushkin had a highly jealous temperament.\nIn 1831, during the period of Pushkin's growing literary influence, he met one of Russia's other influential early writers, Nikolai Gogol. After reading Gogol's 1831\u20131832 volume of short stories \"Evenings on a Farm Near Dikanka\", Pushkin supported him and would feature some of Gogol's most famous short stories in the magazine \"The Contemporary\", which he founded in 1836.\nDeath.\nBy the autumn of 1836, Pushkin was falling into greater and greater debt and faced scandalous rumours that his wife was having a love affair. On 4 November, he sent a challenge to a duel to Georges d'Anth\u00e8s, also known as Dantes-Gekkern. Jacob van Heeckeren, d'Anth\u00e8s' adoptive father, asked that the duel be delayed by two weeks. With efforts by the poet's friends, the duel was cancelled.\nOn 17 November, d'Anth\u00e8s proposed to Natalia Goncharova's sister, Ekaterina. The marriage did not resolve the conflict. D'Anth\u00e8s continued to pursue Natalia Goncharova in public and rumours circulated that d'Anth\u00e8s had married Natalia's sister just to save her reputation.\nOn 26 January (7 February in the Gregorian calendar) 1837 Pushkin sent a \"highly insulting letter\" to Gekkern. The only answer to that letter could be a challenge to a duel, as Pushkin knew. Pushkin received the formal challenge to a duel through his sister-in-law, Ekaterina Gekkerna, approved by d'Anth\u00e8s, on the same day through the attach\u00e9 of the French Embassy, Viscount d'Archiac.\nPushkin asked Arthur Magenis, then attach\u00e9 to the British Consulate-General in Saint Petersburg, to be his second. Magenis did not formally accept but on 26 January (7 February) approached Viscount d'Archiac to attempt a reconciliation; however d'Archiac refused to speak with him as he was not yet officially Pushkin's second. Magenis, unable to find Pushkin in the evening, sent him a letter through a messenger at 2 o'clock in the morning declining to be his second, as the possibility of a peaceful settlement had already been quashed, and the traditional first task of the second was to try to bring about a reconciliation.\nThe pistol duel with d'Anth\u00e8s took place on 27 January (8 February) at the Black River, without the presence of a second for Pushkin. The duel they fought was of a kind known as a \"barrier duel\". The rules of this type dictated that the duellists began at an agreed distance. After the signal to begin, they walked towards each other, closing the distance. They could fire at any time they wished, but the duellist that shot first was required to stand still and wait for the other to shoot back at his leisure.\nD'Anth\u00e8s fired first, critically wounding Pushkin; the bullet entered at his hip and penetrated his abdomen. D'Anth\u00e8s was only lightly wounded in the right arm by Pushkin's shot. Two days later, at 2.45 pm on 29 January (10 February), Pushkin died of peritonitis.\nIn Fyodor Dostoevsky's novel The Idiot, a character suggests that the shot was accidental: \u2018The bullet hit so low that d\u2019Anth\u00e8s was probably aiming somewhere higher, the chest or the head; nobody aims where that bullet hit, that means it probably hit Pushkin by chance, a fluke. I\u2019ve been told that by people who know.\u2019 \nAt Pushkin's wife's request he was put in the coffin in evening dress, not in chamber-cadet uniform, the uniform provided by the emperor. The funeral service was initially assigned to St Isaac's Cathedral but was moved to Konyushennaya church. Many people attended. After the funeral the coffin was lowered into the basement, where it stayed until 3 February, when it was removed to Pskov province. Pushkin was buried in the grounds of Svyatogorsky monastery in present-day Pushkinskiye Gory, near Pskov, beside his mother. His last home is now a museum.\nDescendants.\nPushkin had four children from his marriage to Natalia: Maria (b. 1832), Alexander (b. 1833), Grigory (b. 1835) and Natalia (b. 1836), the last of whom married morganatically Prince Nikolaus Wilhelm of Nassau of the House of Nassau-Weilburg and was granted the title of Countess of Merenberg. Her daughter Sophie married Grand Duke Michael Mikhailovich of Russia, a grandson of Emperor Nicholas I.\nOnly the lines of Alexander and Natalia still remain. Natalia's granddaughter, Nadejda, married into the extended British royal family, her husband being the uncle of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, and is the grandmother of the present Marquess of Milford Haven. Descendants of the poet now live around the globe in the United Kingdom, the Czech Republic, Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg and the United States.\nLegacy.\nLiterary.\nCritics consider many of his works masterpieces, such as the poem \"The Bronze Horseman\" and the drama \"The Stone Guest\", a tale of the fall of Don Juan. His poetic short drama \"Mozart and Salieri\" (like \"The Stone Guest\", one of the so-called four \"Little Tragedies\", a collective characterization by Pushkin himself in 1830 letter to Pyotr Pletnyov) was the inspiration for Peter Shaffer's \"Amadeus\" as well as providing the libretto (almost verbatim) to Rimsky-Korsakov's opera \"Mozart and Salieri\".\nPushkin is also known for his short stories. In particular his cycle \"The Tales of the Late Ivan Petrovich Belkin\", including \"The Shot\", were well received. According to the literary theorist Kornelije Kvas, \"the narrative logic and the plausibility of that which is narrated, together with the precision, conciseness \u2013 economy of the presentation of reality \u2013 all of the above is achieved in \"Tales of Belkin\", especially, and most of all in the story \"The Stationmaster\". Pushkin is the progenitor of the long and fruitful development of Russian realist literature, for he manages to attain the realist ideal of a concise presentation of reality\". Pushkin himself preferred his verse novel \"Eugene Onegin\", which he wrote over the course of his life and which, starting a tradition of great Russian novels, follows a few central characters but varies widely in tone and focus.\n\"Onegin\" is a work of such complexity that, though it is only about a hundred pages long, translator Vladimir Nabokov needed two full volumes of material to fully render its meaning into English. Because of this difficulty in translation, Pushkin's verse remains largely unknown to English readers. Even so Pushkin has profoundly influenced western writers such as Henry James.\nPushkin wrote The Queen of Spades, a short story frequently anthologized in English translation.\nMusical.\nPushkin's works also provided fertile ground for Russian composers. Glinka's \"Ruslan and Lyudmila\" is the earliest important Pushkin-inspired opera, and a landmark in the tradition of Russian music. Tchaikovsky's operas \"Eugene Onegin\" (1879) and \"The Queen of Spades\" (\"Pikovaya Dama\", 1890) became perhaps better known outside of Russia than Pushkin's own works of the same name.\nMussorgsky's monumental \"Boris Godunov\" (two versions, 1868\u20139 and 1871\u20132) ranks as one of the very finest and most original of Russian operas. Other Russian operas based on Pushkin include Dargomyzhsky's \"Rusalka\" and \"The Stone Guest\"; Rimsky-Korsakov's \"Mozart and Salieri\", \"Tale of Tsar Saltan\", and \"The Golden Cockerel\"; Cui's \"Prisoner of the Caucasus\", \"Feast in Time of Plague\", and \"The Captain's Daughter\"; Tchaikovsky's \"Mazeppa\"; Rachmaninoff's one-act operas \"Aleko\" (based on \"The Gypsies\") and \"The Miserly Knight\"; Stravinsky's \"Mavra\", and N\u00e1pravn\u00edk's \"Dubrovsky\".\nAdditionally, ballets and cantatas, as well as innumerable songs, have been set to Pushkin's verse (including even his French-language poems, in Isabelle Aboulker's song cycle \"Caprice \u00e9trange\"). Supp\u00e9, Leoncavallo and Malipiero have also based operas on his works. Composers Yudif Grigorevna Rozhavskaya, Galina Konstantinovna Smirnova, Yevgania Yosifovna Yakhina, Maria Semyonovna Zavalishina, Zinaida Petrovna Ziberova composed folk songs using Pushkin's text.\n\"The Desire of Glory\", which has been dedicated to Elizaveta Vorontsova, was set to music by David Tukhmanov, as well as \"Keep Me, Mine Talisman\" \u2013 by Alexander Barykin and later by Tukhmanov.\nRomanticism.\nPushkin is considered by many to be the central representative of Romanticism in Russian literature; however, he was not unequivocally known as a Romantic. Russian critics have traditionally argued that his works represent a path from Neoclassicism through Romanticism to Realism. An alternative assessment suggests that \"he had an ability to entertain contrarities which may seem Romantic in origin, but are ultimately subversive of all fixed points of view, all single outlooks, including the Romantic\" and that \"he is simultaneously Romantic and not Romantic\".\nRussian literature.\nPushkin is usually credited with developing Russian literature. He is seen as having originated the highly nuanced level of language which characterizes Russian literature after him, and he is also credited with substantially augmenting the Russian lexicon. Whenever he found gaps in the Russian vocabulary, he devised calques. His rich vocabulary and highly-sensitive style are the foundation for modern Russian literature. His accomplishments set new records for development of the Russian language and culture. He became the father of Russian literature in the 19th century, marking the highest achievements of the 18th century and the beginning of literary process of the 19th century. He introduced Russia to all the European literary genres as well as a great number of West European writers. He brought natural speech and foreign influences to create modern poetic Russian. Though his life was brief, he left examples of nearly every literary genre of his day: lyric poetry, narrative poetry, the novel, the short story, the drama, the critical essay and even the personal letter.\nAccording to Vladimir Nabokov, Pushkin's idiom combined all the contemporaneous elements of Russian with all he had learned from Derzhavin, Zhukovsky, Batyushkov, Karamzin and Krylov:\nHis work as a critic and as a journalist marked the birth of Russian magazine culture which included him devising and contributing heavily to one of the most influential literary magazines of the 19th century, the \"Sovremennik\" (\"The Contemporary\", or \"\u0421\u043e\u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0438\u043a\"). Pushkin inspired the folk tales and genre pieces of other authors: Leskov, Yesenin and Gorky. His use of Russian formed the basis of the style of novelists Ivan Turgenev, Ivan Goncharov and Leo Tolstoy, as well as that of subsequent lyric poets such as Mikhail Lermontov. Pushkin was analysed by Nikolai Gogol, his successor and pupil, and the great Russian critic Vissarion Belinsky, who produced the fullest and deepest critical study of Pushkin's work, which still retains much of its relevance.\nSoviet centennial celebrations.\nIn the centennial year of Pushkin's death in 1937, a mass renaming of streets across the entire Soviet Union occurred in his honour. Prior to 2022, Pushkin was the third most common historical figure represented in Ukraine\u2019s streets; however, his monuments were removed and streets bearing his name were renamed following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. These monuments, along with any toponymy named after him, are now illegal in Ukraine following the implementation of a law that bans symbols \"dedicated to persons who publicly, including \u2026 in literary and other artistic works, supported, glorified, or justified Russian imperial policy\".\nThe centennial of Pushkin's death in 1937 was one of the most significant literary commemorations of the Soviet era, second only to the 1928 centennial of Leo Tolstoy's birth. Although Pushkin's image was prominently displayed in Soviet propaganda, from billboards to candy wrappers, it conflicted with the ideal Soviet persona. Pushkin was reputed as a libertine with aristocratic tendencies, which clashed with Soviet values and led to a form of repressive revisionism, akin to the Stalinist reworking of Tolstoy's Christian anarchism.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is located in Volkhonka street, just opposite the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour. The International musical festival Sviatoslav Richter's December Nights has been held in the Pushkin Museum since 1981.\nEtymology.\nDespite its name, the museum has no direct association with the Russian poet Alexander Pushkin, other than as a posthumous commemoration. The facility was founded by professor Ivan Tsvetaev (father of the poet Marina Tsvetaeva) in 1912. Tsvetaev persuaded the millionaire and philanthropist Yuriy Nechaev-Maltsov and the architect Roman Klein of the urgent need to give Moscow a fine arts museum. After going through a number of name changes, particularly in the transition to the Soviet era and the return of the Russian capital to Moscow, the museum was finally renamed to honour Pushkin in 1937, the 100th anniversary of his death.\nHistory.\nDuring the Bolshevik Revolution, works by French impressionists and modern artists were confiscated and then exhibited in the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg before being privately stored. In 2019, those works reappeared and some of them rejoined the Pushkin museum. In 1981, the museum held the Moscow-Paris exhibition. In 2016, art historians discovered 59 Italian Renaissance sculptures in the Pushkin Museum that had been missing from Berlin's collections since the Second World War.\nIn March 2022, a number of museum officials, including deputy directors, resigned to protest against Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\nBuilding.\nThe building of the Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts was designed by Roman Klein and Vladimir Shukhov. Construction lasted from 1898 until early 1912, with Ivan Rerberg heading structural engineering effort on the museum site for the first 12 years.\nIn 2008, President Dmitri A. Medvedev announced plans for a $177 million restoration. A 22 billion rubles ($670 million) expansion, developed by Norman Foster in collaboration with local architectural firm Mosproject-5, was confirmed in 2009, but became mired in disputes with officials and preservationists and concern grew that it would not be completed on schedule for 2018. After Moscow's chief architect Sergei Kuznetsov issued an ultimatum, demanding that Foster take a more active role in the project and prove his commitment by coming to the Russian capital within a month, Norman Foster's firm resigned from the project in 2013. In 2014, Russian architect Yuri Grigoryan, and his firm Project Meganom, were chosen to take over the project. Grigoryan's design provides new modern buildings and, following the protest of heritage groups who campaigned to save the pre-revolutionary architecture, preserves the historic 1930s gas station near the Pushkin's main building inside a glass structure.\nCollection.\nThe holdings of the Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts currently include around 700,000 paintings, sculptures, drawings, applied works, photographs, and archaeological and animalistic objects.\nPainting.\n The earliest monuments from the museum collection are pieces of Byzantine art: mosaics and icons. The early stage of development of Western European painting is represented by a relatively small collection of Italian Primitives. The hall of early Italian art was opened on October 10, 1924.\nGraphic art.\nThe Department of Prints and Drawings was founded in 1924, when the museum received the holdings of the Printing Cabinet of the Moscow Public and Rumyantsev Museum. In 1861, Alexander II made a valuable gift to the Printing Cabinet: the Moscow Public and Rumyantsev Museum received more than 20,000 prints from the Hermitage. \nSculpture.\nThe collection of Western European sculptures includes more than 600 pieces. The museum has expanded its holdings over the years and currently owns artworks from the 6th-21st centuries. The first artifacts presented to the Museum of Fine Arts were sculptures from Mikhail Schekin's collections. After the revolution, the museum received sculptures from nationalized collections. \nCollection of decorative art pieces (Department of the Old Masters).\nThe collection of decorative art pieces from Europe includes around 2,000 items. The earliest are from the Middle Ages, and the set as a whole is very diverse. \nArchaeological collection.\nThe Museum of Fine Arts was intended primarily as a museum of classical arts. Ancient artifacts were the core and the main components of its collection, and the Department of Antiquity was one of the three major scientific departments. Its founder and director, Ivan Tsvetaev (1847-1913), was an expert in ancient art, as were his closest associates, Vladimir Malmberg (1860-1921) and Nikolay Scherbakov (1884-1933).\nEgypt.\nMost of the objects presented in Hall No. 1 have been on display since the museum opening in 1912 and come from the collection of Vladimir Golenishchev (1856-1947).\nAncient civilizations.\nThe museum holdings of genuine artifacts of Southwest Asia are based on the collection of Russian Orientalist and Egyptologist Vladimir Golenishchev.\nAntiquity.\nThe antique collection of the Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts includes many genuine artifacts: more than 1,000 vessels, small plastic pieces, and sculptures.\nTsvetaev's collection of casts.\nThe collection of casts and copies, typical for European museums of the nineteenth century, is unique today in its preservation and consistency. With a similar cohesiveness, Tsvetaev wanted to present plastic art of the modern era and complete the collection with casts made from contemporary sculptures, where Auguste Rodin's works would take the central place.\nNumismatic collection.\nToday, the holdings of the Numismatics Department of the Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts form a collection in excess of 200,000 items and 3,000 volumes of the special library. It was started at Imperial Moscow University. In 1888, the collection was divided and formed the basis for the major numismatic collections of Moscow that belonged to the Historical Museum and the Alexander III Fine Arts Museum.\nSince 1912, objects of ancient and Western European numismatics from the university collection were transferred to the Sculpture Department of the Fine Arts Museum and mostly kept packaged. By June 1925, museum custodians had grouped together a number of cases with coins, medals, and casts and created the Numismatic Cabinet located on the balcony of the White Hall. In 1945, the museum's Numismatic Cabinet became an independent department. It includes archaeological material from Central Asia, such as a hoard of Kushano-Sasanian coins acquired in 2002.\nMuseum Quarter.\nThe work on the Museum Quarter of the Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts started in the late 2000s. In 2019\u201323, the Main Building of the Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts will be reconstructed.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
