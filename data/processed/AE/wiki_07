The population was 97,422 in the 2020 census and it ranked as the 23rd-largest city in Florida in 2022. Many people with a Boca Raton postal address live outside of municipal boundaries, such as in West Boca Raton. As a business center, the city also experiences significant daytime population increases. Boca Raton is north of Miami and is a principal city of the Miami metropolitan area.\nIt was first incorporated on August 2, 1924 as \"Bocaratone\", and then incorporated as \"Boca Raton\" on May 26, 1925. While the area had been inhabited by the Glades culture, as well as Spanish and later British colonial empires prior to its annexation by the United States, the city's present form was developed predominantly by American architect Addison Mizner starting in the 1920s. Mizner contributed to many buildings in the area having Mediterranean Revival or Spanish Colonial Revival architecture. Boca Raton also became a key city in the development of the early computer industry. The city is the birthplace of IBM's first personal computer and various other technologies created by the company.\nStill centered around luxury beach culture, the city today is dotted by many malls and shopping centers, including the Town Center at Boca Raton. The ODP Corporation, which operates Office Depot and OfficeMax, is headquartered here. Boca Raton is also home to the main campus of Florida Atlantic University and the Evert Tennis Academy, owned by former professional tennis player Chris Evert. The city has a strict development code for the size and types of commercial buildings, building signs, and advertisements that may be erected within the city limit, which has led to major thoroughfares without billboards and large advertisements, as well as increased green spaces on roads.\nName.\nEtymology.\n\"Boca Rat\u00f3n\" translates to \"Mouse Mouth\" in English. Its name was originally labeled in the early European maps of the area as . , meaning \"mouth\", was a common term to describe an inlet on maps by sailors (as in a river mouth). The meaning of the word \"ratones\" for the area is less certain. Some claim that the word appears in old Spanish maritime dictionaries referring to \"rugged rocks or stony ground on the bottom of some ports and coastal outlets, where the cables rub against\". Thus, one possible translation of \"Boca Raton\" is \"Rugged Inlet\". Others claim that referred to pirates who hid out in the area, and thus the name could translate to \"Pirates' Inlet\".\nPronunciation.\nCity residents pronounce \"Raton\" as . People not from the region often mispronounce this as instead.\nHistory.\nTimeline.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Hidden begin/styles.css\"/&gt;Timeline of Boca Raton, Florida\nEarly history.\nThe area where Boca Raton is now located was originally occupied by the Glades culture, a Native American tribe of hunter-gatherers who relocated seasonally and between shellfish sources, distinct from the Tequesta to the south and the Jaega to the north.\nWhat Spanish voyagers called \"Boca de Ratones\" was originally to the south, in present-day Biscayne Bay in Miami-Dade County. The area of Boca Raton was labeled \"Rio Seco\", meaning \"Dry River\", during this time. By mistake during the 19th century, mapmakers moved this location to the north and began referring to the city's lake, today known as Lake Boca Raton, as \"Boca Ratone Lagoon\" and later \"Boca Ratone Sounde\". An inland stream near the lake was later renamed Spanish River, and eventually became part of the Intracoastal Waterway.\nWhen Spain surrendered Florida to Britain in 1763, the remaining Tequestas, along with other Indians who had taken refuge in the Florida Keys, were evacuated to Cuba. In the 1770s, Bernard Romans reported seeing abandoned villages in the area, but no inhabitants.\nThe area remained largely uninhabited for long afterwards, during the early years of Florida's incorporation in the United States. The first significant European settler to this area was Captain Thomas Moore Rickards in 1895, who resided in a house made of driftwood on the east side of the East Coast Canal, south of what is now the Palmetto Park Road bridge. He surveyed and sold land from the canal to beyond the railroad north of what is now Palmetto Park Road. Early settlement in the area increased shortly after Henry Flagler's expansion of the Florida East Coast Railway, connecting West Palm Beach to Miami.\nAddison Mizner's resort town.\nBoca Raton as a city was the creation of architect Addison Mizner. Prior to him, Boca Raton was an unincorporated farming town with a population of 100 in 1920.\nIn 1925, Mizner announced his plan for \"the foremost resort city on the North American continent,\" \"a new exclusive social capital in America.\" After spending several years in Palm Beach, where, in his own words, he \"did more than any one man to make the city beautiful,\" and designed the Everglades Club among many other buildings, in Boca Raton his plan was to create from scratch \"a resort as splendid in its entirety as Palm Beach is in spots.\"\nActivity in that area began at least a year, and probably more, before Mizner's announcement. Land acquisition, tens of thousands of acres, was the largest part. But it is hard not to see Mizner's hand in the incorporation of Boca Raton in 1924; the city immediately appointed him Town Planner. The Mizner Development Company was incorporated in 1925, and promptly issued $5 million of stock, which was fully subscribed in less than a week. $500,000 was reserved for the \"average Floridian\"; the remainder was purchased by, as Addison called them, \"noted personages\", all with a Palm Beach connection: Lytle Hall, Harold Vanderbilt, J. Leonard Repogle, the Duchess of Sutherland, Rodman Wanamaker, Paris Singer, Irving Berlin, Madame Frances Alda, W. C. Robinson, H. H. Rodgers, D. H. Conkling, A. T. Herd, Porte, William Kissam Vanderbilt II, Elizabeth Arden, Jesse Livermore, Clarence H. Geist, and T. Coleman du Pont as chairman. Addison's brother Wilson also appears on the list of investors, but he had little to invest.\nInstead of the existing Palmetto Park Road, the main street in Mizner's Boca was to be El Camino Real, 20 lanes wide, which Mizner fancifully translated as \"The Royal Highway\", referring to Spain's road network and to the road to Santa Fe and to the Spanish missions in California. (Spanish kings rarely or never travelled on these roads; \"The Government Road\" would be just as accurate.) It was originally to be circular, with a lagoon in the middle. Soon it became, in the plans, Boca Raton's main east\u2013west street, to be wide and with a canal for pleasure boats in the center. (In the drawing of it on the cover of Mizner Development's first brochure is a Venetian gondola.) His statement that it was inspired by Botafogo, a neighborhood and beach in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, is another of his many inventions of foreign \"facts\". Mizner, who never went to Brazil nor knew Brazilians, simply made it up because the name \"Botafogo\" (\"fire thrower\") sounded impressive, as was the concept of imitating Rio de Janeiro. (The only street in Rio de Janeiro anything like the supposed picture, actually an artist's conception, of \"Botafogo\" that Mizner included in his first catalogue, is the , which runs down the middle of two streets, but is nowhere near Botafogo, a more elegant name than Mangue \"mangrove\".)\nOnly of the road was built (although the street has subsequently been extended to the west at normal scale). According to drawings, the centerpiece of the street was to be a canal for pleasure boats; it was never built. All streets were to be at least wide.\nHis first buildings in Boca Raton were his Administrative Buildings, on El Camino Real (in 2018 the https://), and a small hotel to house interested investors. Mizner designed Boca's first town hall/police station/fire station/library, although the design actually built is much smaller and less expensive than what Mizner planned. Today (2018) it is the Boca Raton History Museum, which houses Boca's Welcome Center and the Boca Raton Historical Society.\nThe hotel was his Ritz-Carlton Cloister Inn, built in 1926, later renamed the Boca Raton Resort &amp; Club, and is one of the only \"5 star\" hotels in Florida. The 1969 addition of its \"pink tower\" hotel building is visible from miles away as a towering monument on the Intracoastal Waterway.\nBecause of the end of the Florida land boom of the 1920s and the 1926 Miami hurricane, the Mizner Development Corporation went into bankruptcy in 1927. Little of Mizner's Boca Raton was ever built: his Administration Buildings, the Cloister Inn, 1/2 mile of El Camino Real, the small Dunagan Apartments (demolished), a few houses near the Cloister Inn (demolished), the Spanish Village neighborhood, and a few small houses in what is now the Old Floresta Historic District neighborhood.\nWorld War II Army Air Force Base.\nDuring World War II, some of the land used by the Japanese farmers of the Yamato Colony was confiscated and used as the site of the Boca Raton Army Air Force Base, a major training facility for B-29 bomber crews and the only facility in the U.S. training radar operators. Much of the Boca Raton Army Airfield was later donated to Palm Beach County and became the grounds of Florida Atlantic University. Many of FAU's parking lots are former runways of the airbase. When viewed from above, the site's layout for its previous use as an airfield is plainly evident. Boca Raton Airport's runway was once part of the original airbase, and is still active to this day, although the runway has been rebuilt. Army School Building #3 (T-604) of the Army Air Forces Base has survived as the office building for the Cynthia Gardens apartment complex on Northwest 4th Avenue.\nPost-World War II history.\nBoca Raton was the site of two now vanished amusement parks, Africa U.S.A. (1953\u20131961) and Ancient America (1953\u20131959). Africa U.S.A. was a wild animal park in which tourists rode a \"Jeep Safari Train\" through the park. There were no fences separating the animals from the tourists. It is now the Camino Gardens subdivision one mile west of the Boca Raton Hotel. A red wooden bridge and remnants from the Watusi Geyser and Zambezi Falls, a 30-foot waterfall, from Africa USA can still be seen at the entrance to Camino Gardens. Ancient America was built surrounding a real Native American burial mound. Today, the mound is still visible within the Boca Marina &amp; Yacht Club neighborhood on U.S. 1 near Yamato Road.\nIBM.\nIn the late 1960s, IBM announced their intentions to open a manufacturing plant in the area. In 1965, well before the extension of I-95 into Southern Florida, IBM, working in secret with the Arvida corporation, quietly purchased several hundred acres of real estate west of the CSX rail line and northwest of Florida Atlantic University. Originally situated in unincorporated Palm Beach County, the site was annexed into Boca Raton almost a year following its dedication in 1970.\nConstruction of IBM's main complex began in 1967, designed by Marcel Breuer, and the manufacturing and office complex was dedicated in March 1970. The campus was designed with self-sufficiency in mind and sported its own electrical substation, water pumping station, and rail spur.\nBy 1984 IBM was Palm Beach County's largest corporate employer, with 8,500 Boca Raton employees. Among other noteworthy IT accomplishments, such as the mass production of the System/360 and development of the Series/1 mainframe computers, IBM's main complex was the birthplace of the IBM PC, which later evolved into the IBM Personal System/2, developed in nearby Delray Beach. Starting in 1987, IBM relocated its manufacturing for what became the IBM PC division to Research Triangle Park in Raleigh, North Carolina, and converted the manufacturing facilities into offices and laboratories, later producing products such as the OS/2 operating system and VoiceType Dictation, later known as ViaVoice voice-recognition software.\nIBM maintained its facilities in the South Florida area until 1996, when the facility was closed and sold to Blue Lake Real Estate. The site was sold to T-REX Management Consortium, then to the Blackstone Group in 2005, who renamed it the Boca Corporate Center and Campus. The site was later renamed the Boca Raton Innovation Campus (BRiC). Crocker Partners, noted for its development of Mizner Park and Office Depot headquarters, purchased BRiC in April 2018.\nWhat used to be IBM's Building 051, an annex separated from the former main IBM campus by Spanish River Boulevard, was donated to the Palm Beach County School District and converted into Don Estridge High Tech Middle School. It is named after Don Estridge, whose team was responsible for developing the IBM PC. IBM returned in July 2001, opening the software development laboratory at Beacon Square off Congress Avenue.\nIt is noteworthy that still left standing inside the old IBM complex is the office and conference table where Bill Gates signed his historic deal to supply IBM with the Microsoft MS-DOS operating system for its personal computer line.\nSuburban expansion.\nIn 1991, the downtown outdoor shopping and dining center, Mizner Park, was completed over the site of the old Boca Raton Mall. It has since become a cultural center for southern Palm Beach County. Featuring a landscaped central park between the two main roads (collectively called Plaza Real) with stores only on the outside of the roads, Mizner Park resembles a Mediterranean suburban \"town center\" with a more contemporary look. It features many restaurants and is home to the Boca Raton Museum of Art, which moved to the new facility in 2001. In 2002, a new amphitheater was built, replacing a smaller one and providing a large-capacity outdoor venue where concerts and other performances are held. The Mizner Park Cultural Center, an indoor performing arts/comedy show theater is located to the southwest of the amphitheater within the Mizner Park property.\nThe National Cartoon Museum was built on the southwest edge of Mizner Park in 1996. Open for six years, the museum relocated to its original home in New York City in 2002.\nAs development continued to focus to the west of the city in the 1980s and 1990s, the mall area known as Town Center at Boca Raton became the geographic center of what is referred to as West Boca Raton, though this mall was not annexed into the city until 2004.\nForbes ranked Boca's Royal Palm Yacht and Country Club the third most exclusive gated community in the US in 2017. Many mansions and estates have been built and reflect the high real estate values. 18.1% of homes for sale are within the $655,000\u2013$966,000 range, 8.5% in the $966,000\u2013$1.288 million range, and 11.9% in the $1.288 million plus range. Since the mid-2010s, there has been a developing boom such as the building of the Mandarin Oriental's Residences, remodeling of Downtown Boca Raton's Mizner Park, and development around Florida Atlantic University and Lynn University.\nOn November 2, 2004, the voters of the Via Verde Association, Waterside, Deerhurst Association (Boca South), Marina Del Mar Association, Rio Del Mar Association (both originally Boca Del Mar communities), and Heatherwood of Boca Raton Condominium Association approved annexation into the Boca Raton city limits, increasing the city land area to . A new gated community called Royal Palm Polo was annexed to the City of Boca Raton, which is the only jurisdiction north of Clint Moore Road.\nGeography.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which of this is land and of it (6.63%) is water. Boca Raton is a \"principal city\" (as defined by the Census Bureau) of the Miami Metropolitan Area. Approximately 1 square mile is on the barrier island Deerfield Beach Island (http://), also colloquially known as Deerfield Cay. Like other South Florida cities, Boca Raton has a water table that does not permit building basements, however plumbing and sewage is constructed underneath the homes and streets, in addition to electrical systems in some areas. There are several high points in the city, such as 4th Avenue which is aptly named \"High Street\". The highest point in this area is the guard shack at Camino Gardens, which is above sea level. The Boca Raton Hotel's Beach Club rests at above sea level.\nSeveral small tunnels run under roads in Boca, but the roads are built up several feet at these locations, or are on dunes. Several of these tunnels are under State Road A1A at Spanish River Park, from the west side of the road where parking is available to beachgoers, to the east side of the road, which is where the beach is located. State Road A1A is already higher than the surrounding land here due to sand dunes formed by erosion and other natural features.\nNeighborhoods.\nPearl City is a neighborhood in Boca Raton, immediately north of downtown and within city limits. The neighborhood was originally platted on May 30, 1915, for the blue-collar African Americans employed at the Boca Raton Resort and similar establishments, on area farms, in construction, and various other jobs.\nClimate.\nBoca Raton has a tropical rainforest climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification \"Af\"), as its driest month (December) averages of rainfall, narrowly meeting the minimum standard of during the driest month to qualify for that designation. In general the climate is very warm to hot and sunny much of the year, although daily thundershowers occur in the hot season from June through September. Boca Raton is frost free. The warm tropical climate in South Florida supports the growth of tropical trees and plants such as the coconut palm that was introduced hundreds of years ago to Florida in nearby West Palm Beach.\nWinter high temperatures are typically in the range, while summer high temperatures are about .\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\nBoca Raton and other parts of Palm Beach County have a significant Jewish population.

Each conference participates four times during the six-year agreement, which began with the 2014 season. The Bowl is held at FAU Stadium.\nSt. Mark Greek Orthodox Church in Boca Raton hosts a popular Greek festival during the last weekend of January. An estimated 15,000 people attended the festival in 2018.\nAdditionally, the city hosts the \"https://\" annually during the spring, and the Brazilian Beat Festival in the fall.\nMizner Park.\nMizner Park is a lifestyle center in downtown Boca Raton. The area contains several stores and fashion boutiques, restaurants, an iPic movie theater, and housing. The Center for the Arts at Mizner Park is on the development's north end, which includes the Boca Raton Museum of Art and the Count de Hoernele Amphitheater. Royal Palm Place is adjacent to Mizner Park, and it contains upscale shopping, restaurants, and apartments.\nTown Center Mall.\nTown Center at Boca Raton is an upscale super-regional shopping center in Boca Raton that is the largest enclosed and conventional shopping mall within Palm Beach County, and the third largest by square feet in South Florida, behind Sawgrass Mills and Aventura Mall.\nIn 1999, the Simon Property Group bought Town Center at Boca Raton and began building a new wing on its southeastern side, and completed renovations in 2018.\nSeritage Growth Properties plans to build a lifestyle center called The Collection at Boca Town Center which will provide shopping, dining, and entertainment.\nCrocker Partners will build a Restaurant Row near the mall.\nBeaches and parks.\nBoca Raton's eastern coast has two miles of beaches, notably Red Reef Park and South Inlet Park.\nThe beach at Spanish River Park was awarded the international Blue Flag beach award, an annual award recognizing high-quality beaches.\nRed Reef Park has the Gumbo Limbo Environmental Complex, an environmental education center.

Henderson School is recognized as Florida Atlantic University School District #72, under the College of Education's administrative oversight.\nUniversity schools in Florida are authorized to provide instruction for grades K\u201312 and university students, support university research efforts, and test educational reforms for Florida schools. Both ADHUS and FAUHS are public schools and thus do not charge tuition. And they are open to children who reside in Palm Beach County or Broward County. ADHUS admission is by lottery, while FAUHS admission is determined by academic ability. Student characteristics of gender, race, family income and student ability are used to match the student population profile to that of the state.\nFAU High School is a dual-enrollment program that involves itself primarily in collegiate classes. Students in ninth grade take advanced classes at the ADHUS sister campus, while students in higher grades attend only collegiate classes on Florida Atlantic University's campus, earning dual credit for both high school and college.

This case was featured on \"America's Most Wanted\". Though there is no forensic evidence to suggest the murders were committed by the same person, the similarities in the cases led police to believe they were related. To this day, the murders all remain unsolved.\nThe Pearl City neighborhood has been known as a drug trafficking hub in the past. In recent years, the city, like most of the county (especially neighboring Delray Beach) has experienced a steady rise in heroin and opioid overdoses.\nAs of the end of 2019, the crime rate in Boca Raton was down 26% over the preceding 13 years.\nTransportation.\nAir.\nThe Boca Raton Airport (BCT) is a general aviation airport immediately adjacent to Florida Atlantic University and Interstate 95.

Most commercial international flights to the region will pass through Miami International Airport, which can be accessed via I-95 and Florida State Route 112 by road or by using Tri-Rail.\nPassenger\nFreight\nWater.\nLong before any settlers arrived, the original 1870 government survey of the area showed that just west of and parallel to the Atlantic Ocean's coastal dune was the \"Boca Ratones Lagoon\", which extended south for measured from just north of the present location of Atlantic Avenue in Delray Beach. Along the southern half of the lagoon were three wide areas each called a \"Lake\", which are now named (north to south) Lake Rogers, Lake Wyman, and Lake Boca Raton. At the southeast end of the lagoon was a short protrusion toward the south which would become the Boca Raton Inlet after a sandbar at its mouth was removed.\nThe lagoon and lakes were part of a half-mile (0.8\u00a0km) wide swamp, west of which was scrub land a mile (1.6\u00a0km) wide (part of the Atlantic Coastal Ridge) where the Florida East Coast Railway (1896) and Dixie Highway (1923) were built. To the west of the scrub was a half mile or wider swamp within which flowed north to south the \"Prong of Hillsborough River\", which is now the El Rio Canal. It now forms the eastern border of Florida Atlantic University and the Old Floresta neighborhood. The prong entered the \"Hillsborough River\" at the present eastern end of the straight portion of the Hillsboro Canal (dredged 1911\u20131914), which is the southern city limits. The river flowed southeast in several channels along the western edge of the present Deerfield Island County Park, formerly called Capone Island (named for Al Capone who owned it during the 1930s), which did not become an island until the Royal Palm Canal was dredged along its northern edge in 1961. Flowing south from the lagoon to the river along the eastern edge of the 'island' was a \"Small boat Pass into Hillsboro' River\", also called the Little Hillsboro. The river continued due south about just inland of the coastal dune until it emptied into the Atlantic Ocean at the \"Hillsborough Bar\", now the Hillsboro Inlet.\nThe lagoon was dredged in 1894\u20131895 to form part of the Florida East Coast Canal with a minimum depth of and a minimum width of . After 1895, the lagoon and canal were sometimes called the Spanish River. Between 1930 and 1935 the canal was improved to by the federal government and renamed the Intracoastal Waterway. It was improved again between 1960 and 1965 to . All three versions were subject to shoaling which reduced their depths below the specified minimum. Forming part of the northern city limits is the C-15 canal, connecting the El Rio Canal to the Intracoastal Waterway.\nBoca Raton pioneered an innovative means to recycle wastewater that involves selling the recycled water to golf courses, to use for irrigation. This system is called the IRIS system. Instead of pumping the nutrient laden wastewater out to sea, or under the ground into an aquifer, the IRIS system prevents nutrients from ending up in the ocean, reducing Boca Raton's impact on the problem of toxic algae blooms.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He later voiced characters for Hanna-Barbera's television cartoons, including: Barney Rubble and Dino on \"The Flintstones\", Mr. Spacely on \"The Jetsons\", Secret Squirrel on \"The Atom Ant/Secret Squirrel Show\", the title character of \"Speed Buggy\", and Captain Caveman on \"Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels\" and \"The Flintstone Kids\". He was also the voice of Gideon's hiccups in \"Pinocchio\", his only appearance at Disney. Blanc was also the voice of Woody Woodpecker in the first four animated shorts from 1940 to 1941, his only appearance at Universal Pictures. He also provided the screams for Tom and Jerry in the short films from 1963 to 1967, in just 34 short films directed by Chuck Jones.\nReferred to as \"The Man of a Thousand Voices\", he is regarded as one of the most influential people in the voice acting industry, and as one of the greatest voice actors of all time.\nEarly life.\nBlanc was born on May 30, 1908, in San Francisco, California. He grew up in San Francisco's Western Addition neighborhood, and later in Portland, Oregon, where he attended Lincoln High School. He had an early fondness for voices and dialect, which he began practicing at the age of 10. He claimed that he changed the spelling of his name when he was 16, from Blank to Blanc, because a teacher told him that he would amount to nothing and be like his name, a \"blank\". He joined the Order of DeMolay as a young man, and was eventually inducted into its Hall of Fame. After graduating from high school in 1927, he divided his time between leading an orchestra, becoming the youngest conductor in the country at the age of 19; and performing \"shtick\" in vaudeville shows around Washington, Oregon and northern California.\nCareer.\nRadio work.\nBlanc began his radio career at the age of 19 in 1927, when he made his acting debut on the KGW program \"The Hoot Owls\", where his ability to provide voices for multiple characters first attracted attention. He moved to Los Angeles in 1932, where he met Estelle Rosenbaum (1909\u20132003), whom he married a year later, before returning to Portland. He moved to KEX in 1933 to produce and co-host his \"Cobweb and Nuts\" show with his wife Estelle, which debuted on June 15. The program played Monday through Saturday from 11:00\u00a0pm to midnight, and by the time the show ended two years later, it appeared from 10:30\u00a0pm to 11:00\u00a0pm.With his wife's encouragement, Blanc returned to Los Angeles and joined Warner Bros.\u2013owned KFWB in Hollywood in 1935. He joined \"The Johnny Murray Show\", but the following year switched to CBS Radio and \"The Joe Penner Show\".\nBlanc was a regular on the NBC Red Network show \"The Jack Benny Program\" in various roles, including voicing Benny's Maxwell automobile (in desperate need of a tune-up), violin teacher Professor LeBlanc, Polly the Parrot, Benny's pet polar bear Carmichael and the train announcer. The first role came from a mishap when the recording of the automobile's sounds failed to play on cue, prompting Blanc to take the microphone and improvise the sounds himself. The audience reacted so positively that Benny decided to dispense with the recording altogether and have Blanc continue in that role. One of Blanc's characters from Benny's radio (and later TV) programs was \"Sy, the Little Mexican\", who spoke one word at a time. He continued to work with Benny on radio until the series ended in 1955 and followed the program into television from Benny's 1950 debut episode through guest spots on NBC specials in the 1970s.\n\"Radio Daily\" magazine wrote in 1942 that Blanc \"specialize[d] in over fifty-seven voices, dialects, and intricate sound effects\", and by 1946, he was appearing on over fifteen programs in various supporting roles. His success on \"The Jack Benny Program\" led to his own radio show on the CBS Radio Network, \"The Mel Blanc Show\", which ran from September 3, 1946, to June 24, 1947. Blanc played himself as the hapless owner of a fix-it shop, as well as his young cousin Zookie. Blanc also appeared on such other national radio programs as \"The Abbott and Costello Show\", the Happy Postman on \"Burns and Allen\", and as August Moon on \"Point Sublime\". During World War II, he appeared as Private Sad Sack on various radio shows, including \"G.I. Journal\". Blanc recorded a song titled \"Big Bear Lake\".\nAnimation voice work during the golden age of Hollywood.\nIn December 1936, Mel Blanc joined , which was producing theatrical cartoon shorts for Warner Bros. After sound man Treg Brown was put in charge of cartoon voices, and Carl Stalling became music director, Brown introduced Blanc to animation directors Tex Avery, Bob Clampett, Friz Freleng, and Frank Tashlin, who loved his voices. The first cartoon Blanc worked on was \"Picador Porky\" (1937) as the voice of Porky's drunken friends who dress up as a bull. He soon after received his first starring role when he replaced Joe Dougherty as Porky Pig's voice in \"Porky's Duck Hunt\", which marked the debut of Daffy Duck, also voiced by Blanc.\nFollowing this, Blanc became a very prominent vocal artist for Warner Bros., voicing a wide variety of the \"Looney Tunes\" characters. Bugs Bunny, as whom Blanc made his debut in \"A Wild Hare\" (1940), was known for eating carrots frequently (especially while saying his catchphrase \"Eh, what's up, doc?\"). To follow this sound with the animated voice, Blanc would bite into a carrot and then quickly spit into a spittoon. One often-repeated story is that Blanc was allergic to carrots, which Blanc denied.\nIn Disney's \"Pinocchio\", Blanc was hired to perform the voice of Gideon the Cat. However, it was eventually decided to have Gideon be a mute character (similar to Dopey from \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\"), so all of Blanc's recorded dialogue was deleted except for a solitary hiccup, which was heard three times in the finished film.\nBlanc also originated the voice and laugh of Woody Woodpecker for the theatrical cartoons produced by Walter Lantz for Universal Pictures, but stopped voicing Woody after the character's first four shorts when he was signed to an exclusive contract with Warner Bros. Blanc had recorded some of Woody's lines for \"Pantry Panic\", but had already left the Lantz studio before the short was released, so Danny Webb was hired to finished Woody's remaining lines for that particular short. Despite this, his laugh was still used in the \"Woody Woodpecker\" cartoons until 1951, when Grace Stafford recorded a softer version, while his \"Guess who!?\" signature line was used in the opening titles until the end of the series and closure of Walter Lantz Productions in 1972.\nDuring World War II, Blanc served as the voice of the hapless Private Snafu in a series of shorts produced by Warner Bros. as a way of training recruited soldiers through the medium of animation.\nThroughout his career, Blanc, aware of his talents, protected the rights to his voice characterizations contractually and legally. He, and later his estate, never hesitated to take civil action when those rights were violated. Voice actors at the time rarely received screen credits, but Blanc was an exception; by 1944, his contract with Warner Bros. stipulated a credit reading \"Voice characterization(s) by Mel Blanc\". According to his autobiography, Blanc asked for and received this screen credit from studio boss Leon Schlesinger after he was denied a salary raise. Initially, Blanc's screen credit was limited only to cartoons in which he voiced Bugs Bunny. This changed in March 1945 when the contract was amended to also include a screen credit for cartoons featuring Porky Pig and/or Daffy Duck. This however, excluded any shorts with the two characters made before that amendment occurred, even if they released after the fact (\"Book Revue\" and \"Baby Bottleneck\" are both examples of this). By the end of 1946, Blanc began receiving a screen credit in any subsequent Warner Bros. cartoon for which he provided voices.\nVoice work for Hanna-Barbera and others.\nIn 1960, after the expiration of his exclusive contract with Warner Bros., Blanc continued working for them, but also began providing voices for the TV cartoons produced by Hanna-Barbera; his roles during this time included Barney Rubble of \"The Flintstones\" and Cosmo Spacely of \"The Jetsons\". His other voice roles for Hanna-Barbera included Dino the Dinosaur, Secret Squirrel, Speed Buggy, and Captain Caveman, as well as voices for \"Wally Gator\" and \"The Perils of Penelope Pitstop\".\nBlanc also worked with former \"Looney Tunes\" director Chuck Jones, who by this time was directing shorts with his own company Sib Tower 12 (later MGM Animation/Visual Arts), doing vocal effects for the \"Tom and Jerry\" series from 1963 to 1967. Blanc was the first voice of Toucan Sam in Froot Loops commercials.\nBlanc reprised some of his Warner Bros. characters when the studio contracted him to make new theatrical cartoons in the mid- to late 1960s. For these, Blanc voiced Daffy Duck and Speedy Gonzales, the characters who received the most frequent use in these shorts (later, newly introduced characters such as Cool Cat and Merlin the Magic Mouse were voiced by Larry Storch). Blanc also continued to voice the \"Looney Tunes\" for the bridging sequences of \"The Bugs Bunny Show\", as well as in numerous animated advertisements and several compilation features, such as \"The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Movie\" (1979). He also voiced Granny on Peter Pan Records in \"4 More Adventures of Bugs Bunny\" (1974) and \"Holly-Daze\" (1974), in place of June Foray, and replaced the late Arthur Q. Bryan as Elmer Fudd's voice during the post-golden age era.\nCar accident and aftermath.\nOn January 24, 1961, Blanc was driving alone when his sports car was involved in a head-on collision on Sunset Boulevard; his legs and his pelvis were fractured as a result. He was in a coma and completely non-responsive. About two weeks later, one of Blanc's neurologists at the UCLA Medical Center tried a different approach than just trying to address the unconscious Blanc\u2014address his characters instead. Blanc was asked, \"How are you feeling today, Bugs Bunny?\" After a slight pause, Blanc answered, in a weak voice, \"Eh\u00a0... just fine, Doc. How are you?\" The doctor then asked Tweety if he was there, too. \"I tawt I taw a puddy tat\", was the reply. Blanc returned home on March 17. Four days later, Blanc filed a US$500,000 lawsuit against the City of Los Angeles. His accident, one of 26 in the preceding two years at the intersection known as Dead Man's Curve, resulted in the city funding the restructuring of curves at the location.\nYears later, Blanc's son Noel revealed that he performed some of his father's Warner Bros. characters for some cartoons during his recovery. Warner Bros. had also asked Stan Freberg to provide the voices for Bugs Bunny and Porky Pig, but Freberg declined, out of respect for Blanc. Jerry Hausner briefly filled in for Blanc as Bugs and Yosemite Sam for some commercials and spots for \"The Bugs Bunny Show\" and additional lines in \"Devil's Feud Cake\". At the time of the accident, Blanc was also serving as the voice of Barney Rubble in \"The Flintstones\". His absence from the show was relatively brief; Daws Butler provided the voice of Barney for a few episodes, after which the show's producers set up recording equipment in Blanc's hospital room and later at his home to allow him to work from there. Some of the recordings were made while he was in full-body cast as he lay flat on his back with the other \"Flintstones\" co-stars gathered around him. He returned to \"The Jack Benny Program\" to film the program's 1961 Christmas show, moving around by crutches and a wheelchair.\nLater years.\nOn January 29, 1962, Mel and his son Noel formed Blanc Communications Corporation, a media company which produced over 5,000 commercials and public service announcements, which remains in operation. Mel and Noel appeared with many stars, including: Kirk Douglas, Lucille Ball, Vincent Price, Phyllis Diller, Liberace and The Who.\nIn the 1970s, Blanc gave a series of college lectures across the US and appeared in commercials for American Express. In 1972, Chuck McKibben started working as Blanc's personal recording engineer/producer and studio manager. His daily responsibilities at Mel Blanc Audiomedia in Beverly Hills, California included recording Blanc's voice for a variety of film, advertising and theme park projects. In 1982, Mel's production company, Blanc Communications Corporation, collaborated on a special with the Boston-based Shriners' Burns Institute called \"Ounce of Prevention\", which became a 30-minute TV special.\nThroughout the late 1970s and 1980s, Blanc performed his \"Looney Tunes\" characters for bridging sequences in various compilation films of Golden Age-era Warner Bros. cartoons, such as: \"The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Movie\", \"The Looney Looney Looney Bugs Bunny Movie\", \"\", \"Daffy Duck's Fantastic Island\" and \"Daffy Duck's Quackbusters\". His final performance of his \"Looney Tunes\" roles was in \"Bugs Bunny's Wild World of Sports\" (1989). After spending most of two seasons voicing the diminutive robot Twiki in \"Buck Rogers in the 25th Century\", Blanc's last major original character was Heathcliff, who he voiced from 1980 to 1988.\nIn the live-action film \"Strange Brew\" (1983), Blanc voiced the father of Bob and Doug McKenzie, at the request of comedian Rick Moranis. In the live-action/animated movie \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" (1988), Blanc reprised several of his roles from Warner Bros. cartoons (Bugs, Daffy, Porky, Tweety, and Sylvester), but left Yosemite Sam to Joe Alaskey (who later became one of Blanc's regular replacements until his death in 2016). The film was one of the few Disney projects in which Blanc was involved. Blanc died just a year after the film's release. His final recording session was for \"\" (1990).\nPersonal life.\nBlanc and his wife Estelle Rosenbaum were married on January 4, 1933, and remained married until his death in 1989. Their son, Noel Blanc, was also a voice actor.\nBlanc was a Freemason as a member of Mid Day Lodge No. 188 in Portland, Oregon. He held membership at the lodge for 58 years. Blanc was also a Shriner.\nDeath.\nBlanc began smoking at least one pack of cigarettes per day at the age of nine and continued up through 1985, having quit smoking after being diagnosed with emphysema. He was later diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), after his family checked him into the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles on May 19, 1989 when they noticed he had been coughing profusely while shooting an Oldsmobile commercial. He was originally expected to recover, but after his health had worsened, doctors discovered that he had advanced coronary artery disease. He also fell from his bed and broke his femur during the stay.\nBlanc died at the age of 81 from complications related to both illnesses on July 10, 1989, at 2:30\u00a0pm, nearly two months after being admitted into the hospital. He is interred in Hollywood Forever Cemetery section 13, Pinewood section, plot No. 149 in Hollywood. His will specified that his memorial marker read \"That's all folks\"\u2014the phrase with which Blanc's character, Porky Pig, concluded Warner Bros. cartoons from 1937 to 1946.\nLegacy.\nBlanc is regarded as the most prolific voice actor in entertainment history. He was the first voice actor to receive on-screen credit.\nBlanc's death was considered a significant loss to the cartoon industry because of his skill, expressive range, and the sheer number of the continuing characters he portrayed, whose roles were subsequently assumed by several other voice talents. As film critic Leonard Maltin observed, \"It is astounding to realize that Tweety Bird and Yosemite Sam are the same man!\" Darrell Van Citters drew a lithograph titled \"Speechless\" in tribute to Blanc, which showed a spotlight on a microphone while the \"Looney Tunes\" characters somberly bowed their heads in a moment of silence.\nBlanc said that Sylvester the Cat was the easiest character for him to voice, because \"[he's] just my normal speaking voice with a spray at the end\"; and that Yosemite Sam was the hardest, because of his loudness and raspiness. A doctor who examined Blanc's throat found that he possessed unusually thick, powerful vocal cords that gave him an exceptional range, and compared them to those of opera singer Enrico Caruso.\nAfter his death, Blanc's voice continued to be heard in newly released productions, such as recordings of Dino the Dinosaur in the live-action films \"The Flintstones\" (1994) and \"The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas\" (2000). Similarly, recordings of Blanc as Jack Benny's Maxwell were featured in ' (2003). In 1994, the Blanc estate and Warner Bros. created the Warner-Blanc Audio Library, consisting of 550 songs and voices of Blanc's \"Looney Tunes\" characters, which he had begun setting down at his multi-track studio in 1958. 15 hours of new tapes of Mel's material were discovered in 1996. Noel Blanc stated that they could also rearrange \"syllables\" of the new recordings to create custom dialogue for the characters. These recordings were also used for toys, watches, video games, commercials, and websites. Later archive recordings of Blanc were featured in computer-generated imagery-animated \"Looney Tunes\" theatrical shorts; \"I Tawt I Taw a Puddy Tat\" (shown with \"Happy Feet Two\") and \"Daffy's Rhapsody\" (shown with ').\nFor his contributions to the radio industry, Blanc has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6385 Hollywood Boulevard. His character Bugs Bunny was also awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on December 10, 1985.\nBlanc trained his son Noel in the field of voice characterization. Noel performed his father's characters (particularly Porky Pig) on some programs, but did not become a full-time voice artist. Warner Bros. expressed reluctance to have a single voice actor succeed Blanc, and employed multiple new voice actors to fill the roles since the 1990s, including Noel Blanc, Jeff Bergman, Joe Alaskey, Greg Burson, Billy West and Eric Bauza.\nOn September 19, 2017, publisher Penguin Random House released the picture book \"Melvin the Mouth\", written by Mel's daughter-in-law Katherine Blanc and illustrated by Jeffrey Ebbeler. The book follows the daily life of Blanc (here named \"Melvin\") during his childhood, in which he makes his comical noises and sound effects. An audiobook adaptation was released on December 15, 2017, narrated by Ram\u00f3n De Ocampo.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The film, which was based on the character of the Cisco Kid in the 1907 story \"The Caballero's Way\" by O. Henry, was a major innovation in Hollywood. It was the first major Western to use the new technology of sound and the first talkie to be filmed outdoors. It made extensive use of authentic locations, filming in Bryce Canyon National Park and Zion National Park in Utah, and the Mission San Juan Capistrano and the Mojave Desert in California. The film premiered in Los Angeles on December 25, 1928, and went into general release on January 20, 1929.\n\"In Old Arizona\" contributed to creating the image of the singing cowboy, as its star, Warner Baxter, does some incidental singing. Baxter went on to win the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance. Other nominations included Best Director for Irving Cummings, Best Writing for Tom Barry, Best Cinematography for Arthur Edeson, and Best Picture. The film entered the public domain on January 1, 2024.\nPlot.\nIn Arizona, a bandit known as the Cisco Kid robs a stagecoach. Word of this deed reaches to Sergeant Micky Dunn, who is tasked by his superior to bring in the Cisco Kid dead or alive, with a $5,000 reward promised once he succeeds. They meet in a barber shop, though Dunn is unaware of the Cisco Kid's true identity and passes him off as a friendly civilian. When he leaves, the local blacksmith tells him that was the Cisco Kid, much to Dunn's chagrin.\nThe Cisco Kid is in a relationship with Tonia Maria, and visits her often. He loves her, but she has frequent affairs without his knowledge. Dunn and Maria meet each other and begin an affair. Dunn tells Maria that once he takes down the Cisco Kid, he will give the $5,000 reward to Maria, making her fall in love with him. They express their love for each other while the Cisco Kid secretly watches and listens nearby, learning of her betrayal.\nShe writes a secret letter to Dunn telling him to come that evening to take down the Cisco Kid before he makes his escape. However, the Cisco Kid finds this letter and replaces it with a fake letter \"from Maria\" which he has written himself. His letter says that he will be dressed up in Maria's clothes in an effort to disguise himself from Dunn, while Maria is actually in the Cisco Kid's clothes riding away. Dunn receives this fake letter, believing it to be from Maria. When the Cisco Kid leaves her house, Dunn shoots Maria, believing her to be the Cisco Kid in disguise. Now farther away, the Cisco Kid laments that \"[Maria's] flirting days are over, and she can finally settle down\". He then makes his escape.\nProduction.\nRaoul Walsh was set to direct the film and star as the Cisco Kid, but had to abandon the project when a jackrabbit jumped through the windshield of a vehicle he was driving; the resulting wreck cost Walsh an eye. He never acted again, but continued his successful career as a film director. \nMusic.\nThe film features a theme song entitled \"My Tonia\" which was composed by B. G.

It is part of beach wrack.\nIn some waterfront areas, driftwood is a major nuisance. However, the driftwood provides shelter and food for birds, fish and other aquatic species as it floats in the ocean. Gribbles, shipworms and bacteria decompose the wood and gradually turn it into nutrients that are reintroduced to the food web. Sometimes, the partially decomposed wood washes ashore, where it also shelters birds, plants, and other species. Driftwood can become the foundation for sand dunes.\nMost driftwood is the remains of trees, in whole or part, that have been washed into the ocean, due to flooding, high winds, or other natural occurrences, or as the result of logging. There is also a subset of driftwood known as drift lumber. Drift lumber includes the remains of man-made wooden objects, such as buildings and their contents washed into the sea during storms, wooden objects discarded into the water from shore, dropped dunnage or lost cargo from ships (jetsam), and the remains of shipwrecked wooden ships and boats (flotsam). Erosion and wave action may make it difficult or impossible to determine the origin of a particular piece of driftwood.\nDriftwood can be used as part of decorative furniture or other art forms, and is a popular element in the scenery of fish tanks.\nHistory.\nAccording to Norse mythology, the first humans, Ask and Embla, were formed out of two pieces of driftwood, an ash and an elm, by the god Odin and his brothers, Vili and V\u00e9. The Vikings would cast wood into the sea before making landfall. The location of the wood would be an indication as to where to build their mead halls. The wood used would found the high-seat pillars of the new hall.\nDriftwood carried by Arctic rivers was the main, or sometimes only, source of wood for some Inuit and other Arctic populations living north of the tree line until they came into regular contact with European traders. Traditional Inuit boats such as the kayak were fashioned from driftwood frames covered in skins. The Inuit classified driftwood into seven different types, each possessing its own unique material and visual properties. Driftwood could be used to make bows if it was straight grained and in reasonably good condition; these were reinforced with sinew cables. The Inuit even made arrows from driftwood; these were often short and fitted with bone or antler foreshafts. Dry scrapings produced by working this material were collected, stored and used for the starting of fires year-round by Inuit. Wood that is burned today in these regions mainly consists of the remains of condemned wooden structures. Driftwood is still used as kindling by some. Woods with resinous qualities, such as cedar, are preferred for their lengthier burning times. \nThe \"Old Man of the Lake\" in Crater Lake, Oregon is a full-size tree that has been bobbing vertically in the lake for more than a century. Due to the cold water of the lake, the tree has been well preserved.\nAlice Gray, the legendary \"Diana of the Dunes\", who fought to preserve the Indiana Dunes, which contain quantities of driftwood, named her cottage \"Driftwood\" and made all her furniture from the material.\nUses.\nSculptures.\nDriftwood sculptures are sculptures that are made of driftwood found on beaches or along riverbanks.\nForts.\nDriftwood is commonly used to make a temporary shelter on beaches.\nFirewood.\nThe EPA includes driftwood in its list of \"Items You Should Never Burn in Your [Wood-Burning] Appliance,\" because it will \"release toxic chemicals when burned\".\nThe government of British Columbia also advises against burning driftwood, as dioxins may be released from the reaction of chloride ions with other materials in the smoke.\nAs a habitat.\nLarge diameter \"Sequoia sempervirens\" logs spent enough time exposed to wave action to round their contours before being driven into the mouth of a narrow ravine by storm surf. Sequoia's high tannin content is resistant to decay, so these logs retain structural strength for decades. Storm flows within Shorttail Gulch are insufficient to move the logs back to sea. This unique habitat at the mouths of small estuaries of the California coast is threatened by the diminished quantity of large redwood logs available in flood waters since the logging of native forests.\nDecline.\nWith the advent of industrial logging practices, the global quantity of driftwood has declined. Early accounts indicate that driftwood was once more plentiful. Early photographs of the Pacific coast reveal greater amounts of driftwood on the beaches than is present today. Likewise, when traveling in Dixon Entrance in the late 1800s, George A. Dorsey recorded that many beaches were \"piled high with drift, often to a height of sixty feet or more.\" Melting polar ice may also contribute to the decline of Siberian driftwood in the Atlantic as the sea ice enabled driftwood to travel greater distances without becoming waterlogged.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The German remake \"Menschen im Hotel\" was released in 1959, and it served as the basis for the 1989 Tony Award-winning stage musical \"Grand Hotel\". In 1977, MGM announced a musical remake, to take place at Las Vegas' MGM Grand Hotel and directed by Norman Jewison, but the production was cancelled.\n\"Grand Hotel\" has proven influential in the years since its release.

Pleased with its success, Thalberg had Drake and B\u00e9la Bal\u00e1zs write the screenplay, and had a budget at $700,000.\nThere was some controversy about Greta Garbo, with her strong Swedish accent, playing a Russian.\nThe film was seen as an artistic achievement in its art direction and production design. The lobby scenes were extremely well done, portraying a 360\u00b0 front desk. This set allowed audiences to watch the hotel action from all around the characters. It changed the way sets were made from that point onward.\nIt was the first film to feature brothers Lionel and John Barrymore together. Thalberg initially cast Marie Dessler for the role of Suzette, but replaced her with Rafaela Ottiano, the only cast member from the Broadway production.\n\"I want to be alone\".\nAs Grusinskaya, Greta Garbo delivers the line \"I want to be alone\", and, immediately following, she says \"I just want to be alone.\" Soon after, in conversation with Baron Felix von Geigern, she says \"And I want to be alone.\" Referring to its legendary use as a characterization of her reclusive personal life, Garbo later insisted \"I never said I want to be alone; I only said, 'I want to be let alone.' There is all the difference.\"\nReception.\nBox office.\n\"Grand Hotel\" was a massive commercial success upon its release. It opened April 12, 1932 at the Astor Theatre in New York City where it played for almost 5 months. It played at Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles for 11 weeks. The film had a roadshow theatrical release in 700 cities. According to MGM records, the film earned $1,235,000 in the U.S. and Canada and $1,359,000 in other markets, resulting in a profit of $947,000.\nCritical reception.\nAlfred Rushford Greason of \"Variety\" comparing the film to the stage production, wrote \"[it] may not entirely please the theatregoers who were fascinated by its deft stage direction and restrained acting, but it will attract and hold the wider public to which it is now addressed\". He added, \"The drama unfolds with a speed that never loses its grip, even for the extreme length of nearly two hours, and there is a captivating pattern of unexpected comedy that runs through it all, always fresh and always pat.\"\nMordaunt Hall of \"The New York Times\" praised the performances of Greta Garbo and John Barrymore, in a mostly positive review. \"The picture adheres faithfully to the original\", he said, \"and while it undoubtedly lacks the life and depth and color of the play, by means of excellent characterizations it keeps the audience on the qui vive.\"\n\"Film Daily\" called it an \"engrossing drama\" that \"never lags\", and \"one of the classiest moving picture affairs you've seen in a long time\".\nJohn Mosher of \"The New Yorker\" called it a \"tricky, clever film\", praising Goulding as \"a director at last to give Garbo her due\" and for his \"ingenious\" camera work, \"relishing, I suspect, the advantages the screen offers in these respects over the stage, where the awkward constant shifting of scenes clogged the action of the play\".\nPauline Kael wrote: \"From her first line, \"I have never been so tired in my life,\" Greta Garbo sets the movie in vibration with her extraordinary sensual presence... There is every reason to reject \"Grand Hotel\" as an elaborate chunk of artifice... But if you want to see what screen glamour used to be, and what, originally, \"stars\" were, this is perhaps the best example of all time. \"Grand Hotel\" is still entertaining because of... the force of the personalities involved in the omnibus story.\" Leonard Maltin gave it four of four stars: \"Vicki Baum's novel and play of plush Berlin hotel where \"nothing ever happens.\" Stars prove the contrary... \" Leslie Halliwell wrote: \"It's a little faded now, but much of the magic still works in this first of the portmanteau movies; the production is opulent yet somehow stiff, and the performances have survived with varying success.\"\nLegacy.\nThe film holds an 85% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 55 reviews. The site's consensus reads: \"Perhaps less a true film than a series of star-studded vignettes, \"Grand Hotel\" still remains an entertaining look back at a bygone Hollywood era.\"\nWriting in 2009, Blake Goble of \"The Michigan Daily\" called it \"the original \"Ocean's Eleven\" for its star power\", and compared it to \"Gosford Park\" \"for its dense structure and stories\". He added \"[T]he pacing is quick, the acting is eloquent, and the stories are actually interesting. It's pure theatricality. But \"Hotel\" lasted thanks to its simplicity, and the star power doesn't hurt either. This is grand, old Hollywood captured on film.\"\nIn 2022, Leila Jordan of \"Paste\" magazine noted the film as highly influential: \"Recognizable names, intersecting stories and a cast that makes you go \u201cwait they\u2019re in this too?\u201d Grand Hotel didn\u2019t invent the genre, but it was the first to assemble the pieces into a sensational hit.\"\nAborted late 1970s musical remake.\nIn his memoir \"Adventures in the Screen Trade\", screenwriter William Goldman recalls being contacted by director Norman Jewison about doing a remake of the film as a musical, to be set at the original MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas (now Bally's). It would also be filmed at the hotel, named for the film and opened just four years earlier, where MGM had not yet allowed any filming of its luxurious interiors. Goldman was very enthusiastic, since even though movie musicals were not very popular with studios or audiences at the time, he believed \"Grand Hotel\" could be an exception, recalling the classic Hollywood movie musicals of the 1940s and 1950s, with the real interiors of the Grand, never before seen on screen, as their setting. Goldman also worried that he was being seen too much as a screenwriter of thrillers and wanted to show that he was not a genre writer.\nMGM executives, initially cooperative, began to have second thoughts about the project once one of them remembered that Jewison had final cut in his contract, meaning the studio could not force him to make changes to the film before release. Goldman characterized their perception of the hotel as \"Pristine. Unsullied. The diamond in the Metro crown\", and believed they feared the film would not depict the Grand this way, instead focusing on the less glamorous aspects of Las Vegas. Goldman wrote a draft of the script with far more detail than he normally added to make clear that this was not his or Jewison's intention, but the studio was not sufficiently persuaded. As a compromise, they offered Jewison final cut on any material filmed outside the hotel, but not inside. Jewison was unwilling to accept that, and the project fell through.\nFour years later, Jewison called Goldman again and said the hotel, now under separate management from the studio, was again interested. Staff at the hotel took Goldman on tours of the building as part of his research. While visiting the suites on the uppermost floors, never rented but instead comped to heavy gamblers and their entourages, he was told that director Hal Ashby had used one for a scene in the then-unreleased \"Lookin' to Get Out\", apparently after Caesars Palace had refused him permission to use one of their suites. Goldman and Jewison learned that in the scene Ashby filmed at the Grand, one of the main characters goes into the suite with a prostitute while his friend waits outside. This was at odds with the image of the Grand management had gone to great lengths to avoid projecting in 1977. \nAfter the 1981 MGM film \"...All the Marbles\", set in the world of women's professional wrestling, staged its climax at the MGM Grand in Reno, Nevada, Goldman felt the Grand had lost its mystique and so lost his enthusiasm for working on the film; the project was dropped.\nHome media.\nWarner Home Video released the first Region 1 DVD on February 3, 2004. The film is in 4:3 frame format, with audio tracks in English and French, and subtitles in English, French, and Spanish. Bonus features include \"Checking Out: Grand Hotel\", a documentary about the making of the film; a 1932 newsreel with highlights of the Hollywood premiere; \"Nothing Ever Happens\", a 1933 Vitaphone short film spoofing \"Grand Hotel\"; and theatrical trailers.\nThe 2013 Warner Home Video Blu-ray release of \"Grand Hotel\" contains an audio commentary track by film historians Jeffrey Vance and Mark A. Vieira.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Born in Tokyo, she was raised in Aomori and began her singing career in the mid-1970s. She has been called \"one of the major musical talents of the Japanese popular music world\". Her vocals and eclectic style have often been compared to her slightly later English contemporary Kate Bush.\nShe has recorded with Yellow Magic Orchestra and its members Ryuichi Sakamoto, Haruomi Hosono and Yukihiro Takahashi, as well as with Swing Out Sister, Pat Metheny, The Chieftains, Lyle Mays, members of Little Feat, David Sylvian, Mick Karn, Kenji Omura, Gil Goldstein, Toninho Horta, Mino Cinelu, Jeff Bova, Charlie Haden, Peter Erskine, Anthony Jackson, David Rhodes, Bill Frisell, Thomas Dolby, the band Quruli, Rei Harakami as Yanokami and her daughter Miu Sakamoto.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nAkiko Yano was born Akiko Suzuki in Tokyo in 1955. She grew up in Aomori, Japan, and learned to play the piano when she was three. She dropped out of high school and moved to Tokyo at the age of fifteen to become a professional musician, quickly became involved in the jazz scene, and by seventeen was working as a studio recording artist for hire. She also performed with the band Tin Pan Alley.\nSolo career.\nYano's debut album, \"Japanese Girl\", was released on July 25, 1976, was a major hit in Japan, and gave Yano overnight success. The album was recorded in Los Angeles with Little Feat, and of the album's ten tracks, she wrote nine of them. The album has been praised for its unique blend of different musical styles such as jazz, pop, blues, and traditional Japanese folk music, and \"still sounds fresh today\", according to Paul Bowler of \"Record Collector\" magazine. The success led to her self-producing the second album, \"Iroha Ni Konpeitou\", which was released in 1977. It was recorded primarily in Japan, and features Yano improvising on a variety of instruments, backed up by prominent musicians such as Rick Marotta and Haruomi Hosono. Around this time, Yano started collaborating with Yellow Magic Orchestra and joined them on two world tours. They also played as the backing band for her 1980 album \"Gohan Ga Dekitayo\", which translates to \"Dinner's Ready\", and marked a shift in her musical style towards electro-pop. The album was also one of the earliest CDs ever released in 1982.\n1981's \"Tadaima\" (\"I'm Home\") has become one of the most beloved of Yano's discography, and also one of her personal favorites. The record company asked for an album that would be a commercial success, so Yano gave them what they wanted on side one, but took side two in a different avant-garde direction, composed around nine short stories that were written by children. The album once again featured the Yellow Magic Orchestra, as well as a cartoonish \"heta-uma\" cover designed by Teruhiko Yumura, but was only released in Japan. The album's single \"Harusaki Kobeni\" was released before the album was recorded, and reached the top 40 chart after being used in cosmetics commercials.\nYano was introduced to British band, Japan, by Ryuichi Sakamoto of the Yellow Magic Orchestra, and in 1982 they met at the AIR Studios in London to record an album, \"Ai Ga Nakucha Ne\" (\"There Must Be Love\"). The record company, Japan Record, released the album as a set with a book of photography and at a lower price, as requested by Yano. After her 1984 album \"Oh Hisse, Oh Hisse\", Yano took a one-year break from recording music to raise her children, and decided to refocus her career on jazz, which led to the 1989 album \"Welcome Back\" featuring Pat Metheny, Charlie Haden and Peter Erskine. She relocated to New York City in 1990.\nOther projects.\nYano's credits extend beyond her album projects. She was showcased by Japanese animation film company Studio Ghibli, which is known for works such as \"Princess Mononoke\" and \"Spirited Away\". Yano composed the music for the film \"My Neighbors the Yamadas\" (as well as performing a minor role as Fujihara-sensei) and created and performed the sound effects using only her voice for two short films \"Yadosagashi\" and \"Mizugumo Monmon\" by animation director Hayao Miyazaki. Both films were shown at the Ghibli Museum in Mitaka, Tokyo. More recently in 2008, Yano performed as a voiceover actress on \"Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea\" as Ponyo's sisters. In addition, Yano composed music for Toei's animated feature, \"Atashin'chi\" and piano-based soundtrack for the film \"Tagatameni\".\nAs an international artist, Yano has toured Europe extensively, performing at \"The Montreux Jazz Festival\", \"Caf\u00e9 de la Danse\", and \"Cit\u00e9 de la Musique\" in Paris. In 2002, she also performed a week of special concerts at \"Pizza Express\" in London. In the United States, Yano has performed in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Boston and New York City where she periodically plays concerts throughout the year at \"Joe's Pub\" at the New York Public Theater. In July 2009, she performed at the North Sea Jazz Festival along with fellow pianist Hiromi Uehara.\nIn recent years she has appeared at the \"Blue Note in New York\" as a guest performer for Janis Siegel of The Manhattan Transfer, and as part of a trio with Anthony Jackson on bass and Cliff Almond on drums in concerts at the Blue Note Tokyo since 2003. In 2008, New York guitarist Marc Ribot joined Yano for sold-out shows at the \"Blue Note Tokyo\".\nYano joined with Rei Harakami to create the duo Yanokami, and in 2007 they released their first studio album \"Yanokami\". In 2009, Will Lee and Chris Parker joined her to form the Akiko Yano Trio.\nPersonal life.\nYano married and soon after divorced Makoto Yano, the producer of her first recording. In 1975, her son Fuuta Yano was born. She later married fellow musician Ryuichi Sakamoto, with whom she had a daughter, Miu Sakamoto. The young couple can be seen playing a duet on the piano at home in the 1985 documentary \"Tokyo Melody\". Yano separated from him in 1992, and they divorced in August 2006. Yano is Christian.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "44755", "revid": "372290", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44755", "title": "William of Tyre", "text": "12th-century clergyman, writer, and Archbishop of Tyre\nWilliam of Tyre (; c.\u20091130\u00a0\u2013 29 September 1186) was a medieval prelate and chronicler. As archbishop of Tyre, he is sometimes known as William II to distinguish him from his predecessor, William I, the Englishman, a former prior of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, who was Archbishop of Tyre from 1127 to 1135. He grew up in Jerusalem at the height of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, which had been established in 1099 after the First Crusade, and he spent twenty years studying the liberal arts and canon law in the universities of Europe.\nFollowing William's return to Jerusalem in 1165, King Amalric made him an ambassador to the Byzantine Empire. William became tutor to the king's son, the future King Baldwin IV, whom William discovered to be a leper. After Amalric's death, William became chancellor and archbishop of Tyre, two of the highest offices in the kingdom, and in 1179 William led the eastern delegation to the Third Council of the Lateran. As he was involved in the dynastic struggle that developed during Baldwin IV's reign, his importance waned when a rival faction gained control of royal affairs. He was passed over for the prestigious Patriarchate of Jerusalem, and died in obscurity, probably in 1186.\nWilliam wrote an account of the Lateran Council and a history of the Islamic states from the time of Muhammad, neither of which survives. He is famous today as the author of a historical chronicle of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. William composed his chronicle in excellent Latin for his time, with numerous quotations from classical literature. The chronicle is sometimes given the title \"Historia rerum in partibus transmarinis gestarum\" (\"History of Deeds Done Beyond the Sea\") or \"Historia Ierosolimitana\" (\"History of Jerusalem\"), or the \"Historia\" for short. It was translated into French soon after his death, and thereafter into numerous other languages. Because it is the only source for the history of twelfth-century Jerusalem written by a native, historians have often assumed that William's statements could be taken at face value. However, more recent historians have shown that William's involvement in the kingdom's political disputes resulted in detectable biases in his account. Despite this, he is considered the greatest chronicler of the crusades, and one of the best authors of the Middle Ages.\nEarly life.\nThe Kingdom of Jerusalem was founded in 1099 at the end of the First Crusade. It was the third of four Christian territories to be established by the crusaders, following the County of Edessa and the Principality of Antioch, and followed by the County of Tripoli. Jerusalem's first three rulers, Godfrey of Bouillon (1099\u20131100), his brother Baldwin I (1100\u20131118), and their cousin Baldwin II (1118\u20131131), expanded and secured the kingdom's borders, which encompassed roughly the same territory as modern-day Israel, Palestine, and Lebanon. During the kingdom's early decades, the population was swelled by pilgrims visiting the holiest sites of Christendom. Merchants from the Mediterranean city-states of Italy and France were eager to exploit the rich trade markets of the east.\nWilliam's family probably originated in either France or Italy, since he was very familiar with both countries. His parents were likely merchants who had settled in the kingdom and were \"apparently well-to-do\", although it is unknown whether they participated in the First Crusade or arrived later. William was born in Jerusalem around 1130. He had at least one brother, Ralph, who was one of the city's burgesses, a non-noble leader of the merchant community. Nothing more is known about his family, except that his mother died before 1165.\nAs a child William was educated in Jerusalem, at the cathedral school in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. The \"scholaster\", or school-master, John the Pisan, taught William to read and write, and first introduced him to Latin. From the \"Historia\" it is clear that he also knew French and possibly Italian, but there is not enough evidence to determine whether he learned Greek, Persian, and Arabic, as is sometimes claimed.\nAround 1145 William went to Europe to continue his education in the schools of France and Italy, especially in those of Paris and Bologna, \"the two most important intellectual centers of twelfth-century Christendom.\" These schools were not yet the official universities that they would become in the 13th century, but by the end of the 11th century both had numerous schools for the arts and sciences. They were separate from the cathedral schools, and were established by independent professors who were masters of their field of study. Students from all over Europe gathered there to hear lectures from these masters. William studied liberal arts and theology in Paris and Orl\u00e9ans for about ten years, with professors who had been students of Thierry of Chartres and Gilbert de la Porr\u00e9e. He also spent time studying under Robert of Melun and Adam de Parvo Ponte, among others. In Orl\u00e9ans, one of the pre-eminent centres of classical studies, he read ancient Roman literature (known simply as \"the Authors\") with Hilary of Orl\u00e9ans, and learned mathematics (\"especially Euclid\") with William of Soissons. For six years, he studied theology with Peter Lombard and Maurice de Sully. Afterwards, he studied civil law and canon law in Bologna, with the \"Four Doctors\", Hugo de Porta Ravennate, Bulgarus, Martinus Gosia, and Jacobus de Boragine. William's list of professors \"gives us almost a who's who of the grammarians, philosophers, theologians, and law teachers of the so-called Twelfth-Century Renaissance\", and shows that he was as well-educated as any European cleric. His contemporary John of Salisbury had many of the same teachers.\nReligious and political life in Jerusalem.\nThe highest religious and political offices in Jerusalem were usually held by Europeans who had arrived on pilgrimage or crusade. William was one of the few natives with a European education, and he quickly rose through the ranks. After his return to the Holy Land in 1165, he became canon of the cathedral at Acre. In 1167 he was appointed archdeacon of the cathedral of Tyre by Frederick de la Roche, archbishop of Tyre, with the support of King Amalric.\nAmalric had come to power in 1164 and had made it his goal to conquer Egypt. Egypt had been invaded by King Baldwin I fifty years earlier, and the weak Fatimid Caliphate was forced to pay yearly tribute to Jerusalem. Amalric turned towards Egypt because Muslim territory to the east of Jerusalem had fallen under the control of the powerful Zengid sultan Nur ad-Din. Nur ad-Din had taken control of Damascus in 1154, six years after the disastrous siege of Damascus by the Second Crusade in 1148. Jerusalem could now expand only to the southwest, towards Egypt, and in 1153 Ascalon, the last Fatimid outpost in Palestine, fell to the crusaders. Nur ad-Din, however, also wished to acquire Egypt, and sent his army to hinder Amalric's plans. This was the situation in the east when William returned from Europe. In 1167 Amalric married Maria Comnena, grand-niece of Byzantine emperor Manuel I Comnenus, and in 1168 the king sent William to finalize a treaty for a joint Byzantine-crusader campaign against Egypt. The expedition, Amalric's fourth, was the first with support from the Byzantine navy. Amalric, however, did not wait for the fleet to arrive. He managed to capture Damietta, but within a few years he was expelled from Egypt by one of Nur ad-Din's generals, Saladin, who would later become Jerusalem's greatest threat.\nMeanwhile, William continued his advancement in the kingdom. In 1169 he visited Rome, possibly to answer accusations made against him by Archbishop Frederick, although if so, the charge is unknown. It is also possible that while Frederick was away on a diplomatic mission in Europe, a problem within the diocese forced William to seek the archbishop's assistance.\n On his return from Rome in 1170 he may have been commissioned by Amalric to write a history of the kingdom. He also became the tutor of Amalric's son and heir, Baldwin IV. When Baldwin was thirteen years old, he was playing with some children, who were trying to cause each other pain by scratching each other's arms. \"The other boys gave evidence of pain by their outcries,\" wrote William, \"but Baldwin, although his comrades did not spare him, endured it altogether too patiently, as if he felt nothing\u00a0 ... \u00a0It is impossible to refrain from tears while speaking of this great misfortune.\" William inspected Baldwin's arms and recognized the possible symptoms of leprosy, which was confirmed as Baldwin grew older.\nAmalric died in 1174, and Baldwin IV succeeded him as king. Nur ad-Din also died in 1174, and his general Saladin spent the rest of the decade consolidating his hold on both Egypt and Nur ad-Din's possessions in Syria, which allowed him to completely encircle Jerusalem. The subsequent events have often been interpreted as a struggle between two opposing factions, a \"court party\" and a \"noble party.\" The \"court party\" was led by Baldwin's mother, Amalric's first wife Agnes of Courtenay, and her immediate family, as well as recent arrivals from Europe who were inexperienced in the affairs of the kingdom and were in favour of war with Saladin. The \"noble party\" was led by Raymond III of Tripoli and the native nobility of the kingdom, who favoured peaceful co-existence with the Muslims. This is the interpretation offered by William himself in the \"Historia\", and it was taken as fact by later historians. Peter W. Edbury, however, has more recently argued that William must be considered extremely partisan as he was naturally allied with Raymond, who was responsible for his later advancement in political and religious offices. The accounts of the 13th-century authors who continued the \"Historia\" in French must also be considered suspect, as they were allied to Raymond's supporters in the Ibelin family. The general consensus among recent historians is that although there was a dynastic struggle, \"the division was not between native barons and newcomers from the West, but between the king's maternal and paternal kin.\"\nMiles of Plancy briefly held the regency for the underaged Baldwin IV. Miles was assassinated in October 1174, and Raymond III was soon appointed to replace him. Raymond named William chancellor of Jerusalem, as well as archdeacon of Nazareth, and on 6 June 1175, William was elected archbishop of Tyre to replace Frederick de la Roche, who had died in October 1174. William's duties as chancellor probably did not take up too much of his time; the scribes and officials in the chancery drafted documents and it may not have even been necessary for him to be present to sign them. Instead he focused on his duties as archbishop. In 1177 he performed the funeral services for William of Montferrat, husband of Baldwin IV's sister Sibylla, when the patriarch of Jerusalem, Amalric of Nesle, was too sick to attend.\nIn 1179, William was one of the delegates from Jerusalem and the other crusader states at the Third Lateran Council; among the others were Heraclius, archbishop of Caesarea, Joscius, bishop of Acre and William's future successor in Tyre, the bishops of Sebastea, Bethlehem, Tripoli, and Jabala, and the abbot of Mount Sion. Patriarch Amalric and Patriarch of Antioch Aimery of Limoges were unable to attend, and William and the other bishops did not have sufficient weight to persuade Pope Alexander III of the need for a new crusade. William was, however, sent by Alexander as an ambassador to Emperor Manuel, and Manuel then sent him on a mission to the Principality of Antioch. William does not mention exactly what happened during these embassies, but he probably discussed the Byzantine alliance with Jerusalem, and Manuel's protectorate over Antioch, where, due to pressure from Rome and Jerusalem, the emperor was forced to give up his attempts to restore a Greek patriarch. William was absent from Jerusalem for two years, returning home in 1180.\nPatriarchal election of 1180.\nDuring William's absence a crisis had developed in Jerusalem. King Baldwin had reached the age of majority in 1176 and Raymond III had been removed from the regency, but as a leper Baldwin could have no children and could not be expected to rule much longer. After the death of William of Montferrat in 1177, King Baldwin's widowed sister Sibylla required a new husband. At Easter in 1180, the two factions were divided even further when Raymond and his cousin Bohemond III of Antioch attempted to force Sibylla to marry Baldwin of Ibelin. Raymond and Bohemond were King Baldwin's nearest male relatives in the paternal line, and could have claimed the throne if the king died without an heir or a suitable replacement. Before Raymond and Bohemond arrived, however, Agnes and King Baldwin arranged for Sibylla to be married to a Poitevin newcomer, Guy of Lusignan, whose older brother Aimery of Lusignan was already an established figure at court.\nThe dispute affected William, since he had been appointed chancellor by Raymond and may have fallen out of favour after Raymond was removed from the regency. When Patriarch Amalric died on 6 October 1180, the two most obvious choices for his successor were William and Heraclius of Caesarea. They were fairly evenly matched in background and education, but politically they were allied with opposite parties, as Heraclius was one of Agnes of Courtenay's supporters. It seems that the canons of the Holy Sepulchre were unable to decide, and asked the king for advice; due to Agnes' influence, Heraclius was elected. There were rumours that Agnes and Heraclius were lovers, but this information comes from the partisan 13th-century continuations of the \"Historia\", and there is no other evidence to substantiate such a claim. William himself says almost nothing about the election and Heraclius' character or his subsequent patriarchate, probably reflecting his disappointment at the outcome.\nDeath.\nWilliam remained archbishop of Tyre and chancellor of the kingdom, but the details of his life at this time are obscure. The 13th-century continuators claim that Heraclius excommunicated William in 1183, but it is unknown why Heraclius would have done this. They also claim that William went to Rome to appeal to the Pope, where Heraclius had him poisoned. According to Peter W. Edbury and John Rowe, the obscurity of William's life during these years shows that he did not play a large political role, but concentrated on ecclesiastical affairs and the writing of his history. The story of his excommunication, and the unlikely detail that he was poisoned, were probably an invention of the Old French continuators. William remained in the kingdom and continued to write up until 1184, but by then Jerusalem was internally divided by political factions and externally surrounded by the forces of Saladin, and \"the only subjects that present themselves are the disasters of a sorrowing country and its manifold misfortunes, themes which can serve only to draw forth lamentations and tears.\"\nHis importance had dwindled with the victory of Agnes and her supporters, and with the accession of Baldwin V, infant son of Sibylla and William of Montferrat. Baldwin was a sickly child and he died the next year. In 1186 he was succeeded by his mother Sibylla and her second husband Guy of Lusignan, ruling jointly. William was probably in failing health by this point. Rudolf Hiestand discovered that the date of William's death was 29 September, but the year was not recorded; whatever the year, there was a new chancellor in May 1185 and a new archbishop of Tyre by 21 October 1186. Hans E. Mayer concluded that William died in 1186, and this is the year generally accepted by scholars.\nWilliam's foresight about the misfortunes of his country was proven correct less than a year later. Saladin defeated King Guy at the Battle of Hattin in 1187, and went on to capture Jerusalem and almost every other city of the kingdom, except the seat of William's archdiocese, Tyre. News of the fall of Jerusalem shocked Europe and plans were made to send assistance. According to Roger of Wendover, William was present at Gisors in France in 1188 when Henry II of England and Philip II of France agreed to go on crusade: \"Thereupon the king of the English first took the sign of the cross at the hands of the Archbishop of Rheims and William of Tyre, the latter of whom had been entrusted by our lord the pope with the office of legate in the affairs of the crusade in the western part of Europe.\" Roger was however mistaken; he knew that an unnamed archbishop of Tyre was present and assumed it must have been the William whose chronicle he possessed, although the archbishop in question was actually William's successor Joscius.\nWorks.\n\"Historia\".\nLatin chronicle.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In the present work we seem to have fallen into manifold dangers and perplexities. For, as the series of events seemed to require, we have included in this study on which we are now engaged many details about the characters, lives, and personal traits of kings, regardless of whether these facts were commendable or open to criticism. Possibly descendants of these monarchs, while perusing this work, may find this treatment difficult to brook and be angry with the chronicler beyond his just deserts. They will regard him as either mendacious or jealous\u2014both of which charges, as God lives, we have endeavored to avoid as we would a pestilence.\u2014\u200a\nWilliam's great work is a Latin chronicle, written between 1170 and 1184. It contains twenty-three books; the final book, which deals with the events of 1183 and the beginning of 1184, has only a prologue and one chapter, so it is either unfinished or the rest of the pages were lost before the whole chronicle began to be copied. The first book begins with the conquest of Syria by Umar in the seventh century, but otherwise the work deals with the advent of the First Crusade and the subsequent political history of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. It is arranged, but was not written, chronologically; the first sections to be written were probably the chapters about the invasion of Egypt in 1167, which are extremely detailed and were likely composed before the Fatimid dynasty was overthrown in 1171. Much of the \"Historia\" was finished before William left to attend the Lateran Council, but new additions and corrections were made after his return in 1180, perhaps because he now realized that European readers would also be interested in the history of the kingdom. In 1184 he wrote the Prologue and the beginning of the twenty-third book.\nAugust C. Krey thought William's Arabic sources may have come from the library of the Damascene diplomat Usama ibn Munqidh, whose library was looted by Baldwin III from a shipwreck in 1154. Alan V. Murray, however, has argued that, at least for the accounts of Persia and the Turks in his chronicle, William relied on Biblical and earlier medieval legends rather than actual history, and his knowledge \"may be less indicative of eastern ethnography than of western mythography.\" William had access to the chronicles of the First Crusade, including Fulcher of Chartres, Albert of Aix, Raymond of Aguilers, Baldric of Dol, and the \"Gesta Francorum\", as well as other documents located in the kingdom's archives. He used Walter the Chancellor and other now-lost works for the history of the Principality of Antioch. From the end of Fulcher's chronicle in 1127, William is the only source of information from an author living in Jerusalem. For events that happened in William's own lifetime, he interviewed older people who had witnessed the events about which he was writing, and drew on his own memory.\nWilliam's classical education allowed him to compose Latin superior to that of many medieval writers. He used numerous ancient Roman and early Christian authors, either for quotations or as inspiration for the framework and organization of the \"Historia\". His vocabulary is almost entirely classical, with only a few medieval constructions such as \"loricator\" (someone who makes armour, a calque of the Arabic \"zarra\") and \"assellare\" (to empty one's bowels). He was capable of clever word-play and advanced rhetorical devices, but he was prone to repetition of a number of words and phrases. His writing also shows phrasing and spelling which is unusual or unknown in purely classical Latin but not uncommon in medieval Latin, such as:\nLiterary themes and biases.\nDespite his quotations from Christian authors and from the Bible, William did not place much emphasis on the intervention of God in human affairs, resulting in a somewhat \"secular\" history. Nevertheless, he included much information that is clearly legendary, especially when referring to the First Crusade, which even in his own day was already considered an age of great Christian heroes. Expanding on the accounts of Albert of Aix, Peter the Hermit is given prominence in the preaching of the First Crusade, to the point that it was he, not Pope Urban II, who originally conceived the crusade. Godfrey of Bouillon, the first ruler of crusader Jerusalem, was also depicted as the leader of the crusade from the beginning, and William attributed to him legendary strength and virtue. This reflected the almost mythological status that Godfrey and the other first crusaders held for the inhabitants of Jerusalem in the late twelfth century.\nWilliam gave a more nuanced picture of the kings of his own day. He claimed to have been commissioned to write by King Amalric himself, but William did not allow himself to praise the king excessively; for example, Amalric did not respect the rights of the church, and although he was a good military commander, he could not stop the increasing threat from the neighbouring Muslim states. On a personal level, William admired the king's education and his interest in history and law, but also noted that Amalric had \"breasts like those of a woman hanging down to his waist\" and was shocked when the king questioned the resurrection of the dead.\nAbout Amalric's son Baldwin IV, however, \"there was no ambiguity\". Baldwin was nothing but heroic in the face of his debilitating leprosy, and he led military campaigns against Saladin even while still underaged; William tends to gloss over campaigns where Baldwin was not actually in charge, preferring to direct his praise towards the afflicted king rather than subordinate commanders. William's history can be seen as an \"apologia\", a literary defense, for the kingdom, and more specifically for Baldwin's rule. By the 1170s and 1180s, western Europeans were reluctant to support the kingdom, partly because it was far away and there were more pressing concerns in Europe, but also because leprosy was usually considered divine punishment.\nWilliam was famously biased against the Knights Templar, whom he believed to be arrogant and disrespectful of both secular and ecclesiastical hierarchies, as they were not required to pay tithes and were legally accountable only to the Pope. Although he was writing decades later, he is the earliest author to describe the actual foundation of the Templar order. He was generally favourable towards them when discussing their early days, but resented the power and influence they held in his own time. William accused them of hindering the siege of Ascalon in 1153; of poorly defending a cave-fortress in 1165, for which twelve Templars were hanged by King Amalric; of sabotaging the invasion of Egypt in 1168; and of murdering Assassin ambassadors in 1173.\nCompared to other Latin authors of the twelfth century, William is surprisingly favourable to the Byzantine Empire. He had visited the Byzantine court as an official ambassador and probably knew more about Byzantine affairs than any other Latin chronicler. He shared the poor opinion of Alexius I Comnenus that had developed during the First Crusade, although he was also critical of some of the crusaders' dealings with Alexius. He was more impressed by Alexius' son John II Comnenus; he did not approve of John's attempts to bring the crusader Principality of Antioch under Byzantine control, but John's military expeditions against the Muslim states, the common enemy of both Greeks and Latins, were considered admirable. Emperor Manuel, whom William met during his visits to Constantinople, was portrayed more ambivalently, much like King Amalric. William admired him personally, but recognized that the Empire was powerless to help Jerusalem against the Muslim forces of Nur ad-Din and Saladin. William was especially disappointed in the failure of the joint campaign against Egypt in 1169. The end of the \"Historia\" coincides with the massacre of the Latins in Constantinople and the chaos that followed the coup of Andronicus I Comnenus, and in his description of those events, William was certainly not immune to the extreme anti-Greek rhetoric that was often found in Western European sources.\nAs a medieval Christian author William could hardly avoid hostility towards the kingdom's Muslim neighbours, but as an educated man who lived among Muslims in the east, he was rarely polemical or completely dismissive of Islam. He did not think Muslims were pagans, but rather that they belonged to a heretical sect of Christianity and followed the teachings of a false prophet. He often praised the Muslim leaders of his own day, even if he lamented their power over the Christian kingdom; thus Muslim rulers such as Mu'in ad-Din Unur, Nur ad-Din, Shirkuh, and even Jerusalem's ultimate conqueror Saladin are presented as honourable and pious men, characteristics that William did not bestow on many of his own Christian contemporaries.\nCirculation of the chronicle.\nAfter William's death the \"Historia\" was copied and circulated in the crusader states and was eventually brought to Europe. In the 13th century, James of Vitry had access to a copy while he was bishop of Acre, and it was used by Guy of Bazoches, Matthew Paris, and Roger of Wendover in their own chronicles. However, there are only ten known manuscripts that contain the Latin chronicle, all of which come from France and England, so William's work may not have been very widely read in its original form. In England, however, the \"Historia\" was expanded in Latin, with additional information from the \"Itinerarium Regis Ricardi\", and the chronicle of Roger Hoveden; this version was written around 1220.\nIt is unknown what title William himself gave his chronicle, although one group of manuscripts uses \"Historia rerum in partibus transmarinis gestarum\" and another uses \"Historia Ierosolimitana\". The Latin text was printed for the first time in Basel in 1549 by Nicholas Brylinger; it was also published in the \"Gesta Dei per Francos\" by Jacques Bongars in 1611 and the \"Recueil des historiens des croisades\" (RHC) by Auguste-Arthur Beugnot and Auguste Le Pr\u00e9vost in 1844, and Bongars' text was reprinted in the \"Patrologia Latina\" by Jacques Paul Migne in 1855. The now-standard Latin critical edition, based on six of the surviving manuscripts, was published as \"Willelmi Tyrensis Archiepiscopi Chronicon\" in the \"Corpus Christianorum\" in 1986, by R. B. C. Huygens, with notes by Hans E. Mayer and Gerhard R\u00f6sch. The RHC edition was translated into English by Emily A. Babcock and August C. Krey in 1943 as \"A History of Deeds Done Beyond the Sea,\" although the translation is sometimes incomplete or inexact.\nOld French translation.\nA translation of the \"Historia\" into Old French, made around 1223, was particularly well-circulated and had many anonymous additions made to it in the 13th century. In contrast to the surviving Latin manuscripts, there are \"at least fifty-nine manuscripts or fragments of manuscripts\" containing the Old French translation. There are also independent French continuations attributed to Ernoul and Bernard le Tr\u00e9sorier. The translation was sometimes called the \"Livre dou conqueste\"; it was known by this name throughout Europe as well as in the crusader Kingdom of Cyprus and in Cilician Armenia, and 14th-century Venetian geographer Marino Sanuto the Elder had a copy of it. The French was further translated into Spanish, as the \"Gran conquista de Ultramar\", during the reign of Alfonso the Wise of Castile in the late 13th century. The French version was so widespread that the Renaissance author Francesco Pipino translated it back into Latin, unaware that a Latin original already existed. A Middle English translation of the French was made by William Caxton in the 15th century.\nOther works.\nWilliam reports that he wrote an account of the Third Council of the Lateran, which does not survive. He also wrote a history of the Holy Land from the time of Muhammad up to 1184, for which he used Eutychius of Alexandria as his main source. This work seems to have been known in Europe in the 13th century but it also does not survive.\nModern assessment.\nWilliam's neutrality as an historian was often taken for granted until the late twentieth century. August C. Krey, for example, believed that \"his impartiality\u00a0 ... \u00a0is scarcely less impressive than his critical skill.\" Despite this excellent reputation, D. W. T. C. Vessey has shown that William was certainly not an impartial observer, especially when dealing with the events of the 1170s and 1180s. Vessey believes that William's claim to have been commissioned by Amalric is a typical ancient and medieval \"topos\", or literary theme, in which a wise ruler, a lover of history and literature, wishes to preserve for posterity the grand deeds of his reign. William's claims of impartiality are also a typical \"topos\" in ancient and medieval historical writing.\nHis depiction of Baldwin IV as a hero is an attempt \"to vindicate the politics of his own party and to blacken those of its opponents.\" As mentioned above, William was opposed to Baldwin's mother Agnes of Courtenay, Patriarch Heraclius, and their supporters; his interpretation of events during Baldwin's reign was previously taken as fact almost without question. In the mid twentieth century, Marshall W. Baldwin, Steven Runciman, and Hans Eberhard Mayer were influential in perpetuating this point of view, although the more recent re-evaluations of this period by Vessey, Peter Edbury and Bernard Hamilton have undone much of William's influence.\nAn often-noted flaw in the \"Historia\" is William's poor memory for dates. \"Chronology is sometimes confused, and dates are given wrongly\", even for basic information such as the regnal dates of the kings of Jerusalem. For example, William gives the date of Amalric's death as 11 July 1173, when it actually occurred in 1174.\nDespite his biases and errors, William \"has always been considered one of the greatest medieval writers.\" Runciman wrote that \"he had a broad vision; he understood the significance of the great events of his time and the sequence of cause and effect in history.\" Christopher Tyerman calls him \"the historian's historian\", and \"the greatest crusade historian of all,\" and Bernard Hamilton says he \"is justly considered one of the finest historians of the Middle Ages\". As the \"Dictionary of the Middle Ages\" says, \"William's achievements in assembling and evaluating sources, and in writing in excellent and original Latin a critical and judicious (if chronologically faulty) narrative, make him an outstanding historian, superior by medieval, and not inferior by modern, standards of scholarship.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\nPrimary.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSecondary.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\nPrimary sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSecondary sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

One of the ten campuses of the University of California system, UCI offers 87 undergraduate degrees and 129 graduate and professional degrees, and roughly 30,000 undergraduates and 7,000 graduate students were enrolled at UCI as of Fall 2024. The university is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities \u2013 Very high research activity\" and had $609.6 million in research and development expenditures in 2023, ranking it 56th nationally. UCI became a member of the Association of American Universities in 1996.\nThe university administers the UC Irvine Medical Center, a large teaching hospital in Orange, and its affiliated health sciences system; the University of California, Irvine, Arboretum; and a portion of the University of California Natural Reserve System. UC Irvine set up the first Earth System Science Department in the United States. The university was rated as one of the \"Public Ivies\" in 1985 and 2001 surveys comparing publicly funded universities the authors claimed provide an education comparable to the Ivy League.\nThe UC Irvine Anteaters currently compete in the NCAA Division I as members of the Big West Conference. During the early years of the school's existence, the teams played at the NCAA Division II level. The Anteaters have won 28 national championships in nine different team sports, 64 Anteaters have won individual national championships, and 53 Anteaters have competed in the Olympics, winning a total of 33 Olympic medals.\nAs of 2025, alumni, academics, and affiliates of UCI include 5 Nobel Prize laureates, 7 Pulitzer Prize winners, 61 Sloan Research Fellowship recipients, 61 Guggenheim Fellows, and 1 Turing Award winner. In addition, of the current faculty, 24 have been named to the National Academy of Sciences, 6 have been named to the National Academy of Medicine, 17 to the National Academy of Engineering, 41 to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and 20 to the National Academy of Inventors.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nThe University of California, Irvine (with San Diego and Santa Cruz) was one of three new University of California campuses established in the 1960s under the California Master Plan for Higher Education. During the 1950s, the University of California saw the need for the new campuses to handle the expected increase in enrollment from the post-war baby boom. One of the new campuses was to be in the Los Angeles area; the location selected was Irvine Ranch, an area of agricultural land bisecting Orange County from north to south. This site was chosen to accommodate the county's growing population, complement the growth of nearby UCLA and UC Riverside, and allow for the construction of a master planned community in the surrounding area.\nOn June 20, 1964, U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson dedicated UC Irvine before a crowd of 15,000 people, and on October 4, 1965, the campus began operations with 1,589 students, 241 staff members, 119 faculty, and 43 teaching assistants. However, many of UCI's buildings were still under construction and landscaping was still in progress, with the campus only at 75% completion. By June 25, 1966, UCI held its first Commencement with fourteen students, which conferred ten Bachelor of Arts degrees, three Master of Arts degrees, and one Doctor of Philosophy degree.\nDevelopment.\nUnlike most other University of California campuses, UCI was not named for the city it was built in; at the time of the university's founding (1965), the current city of Irvine (incorporated in 1971) did not exist. The name \"Irvine\" is a reference to James Irvine, a landowner who administered the Irvine Ranch. In 1960, The Irvine Company sold of the Irvine Ranch to the University of California for one dollar, since company policy prohibited the donation of property to a public entity. On campus, UC Irvine's first Chancellor, Daniel G. Aldrich selected a wide variety of Mediterranean-climate flora and fauna, feeling that it served an \"aesthetic, environmental, and educational [purpose].\" To plan the remainder of the ranch, the university hired William Pereira and Associates. Pereira intended for the UC Irvine campus to complement the neighboring community, and it became clear that the original grant would not suffice. In 1964, the university purchased an additional in 1964 for housing and commercial developments.\nMuch of the land that was not purchased by UCI (which is now occupied by the cities of Irvine, Tustin, and Newport Beach) remains held by The Irvine Company, but the completion of the university rapidly drove the development of Orange County. The City of Irvine became incorporated and established in 1971 and 1975, respectively. UCI remains the second-largest employer in Orange County, with an annual economic impact of $5 billion.\nAldrich developed the campus's first academic plan around a College of Letters and Science, a Graduate School of Administration, and a School of Engineering. The \"principal author\" of the plan was Ivan Hinderaker, who served under Aldrich as UCI's vice-chancellor for academic affairs before departing to become the second chancellor of UC Riverside. The UCI College of Letters and Science was to be divided into five divisions which together would initially offer about a dozen majors: Biological Sciences, Fine Arts, Humanities, Physical Sciences, and Social Sciences. Hinderaker came up with the idea \"to appoint deans with strong authority for each of the divisions and to give them as much freedom as possible in determining the internal organization of their divisions\". In 1967, the UCI Academic Senate voted to redesignate the divisions as \"schools\", with all their deans reporting directly to the vice chancellor for academic affairs. This is why schools became the dominant academic unit at UCI, in contrast to the relatively large colleges at the older UC campuses.\nIn 1967, the California College of Medicine (originally a school of osteopathy founded in 1896 and the oldest continuously operating medical college in the Southwest) became part of UC Irvine. In 1976, plans to establish an on-campus hospital were set aside, with the university instead purchasing the Orange County Medical Center (renamed the UC Irvine Medical Center) around 12 miles from UC Irvine, in the City of Orange.\nRecent history.\nOn November 30, 2007, the Office of Civil Rights of the United States Department of Education issued a report finding insufficient evidence in support of allegations that Jewish students at UCI were harassed and subjected to a hostile environment based on their religious beliefs. The agency ultimately found that none of the incidents leading to the allegations qualified as \"sufficiently severe, pervasive or persistent as to interfere with or limit the ability of an individual to participate in from the services, activities or privileges\" provided by UCI, and that university officials had acted appropriately in response to each incident. In December 2007, UCI Administration was cleared of anti-semitism complaints by the US Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights. Following a speech by Chancellor Drake at the national Hillel meeting in Washington, D.C. in March 2008, Anteaters for Israel, along with three other Jewish organizations, issued a press release defending Drake and claiming that the anti-Semitic activity was \"exaggerated\".\nIrvine 11 controversy.\nIn 2010, eleven students from the Muslim Student Union disrupted a speech by Israeli Ambassador Michael Oren. The students and the student's union involved were first disciplined by UCI and then had criminal charges brought against them. They were convicted of misdemeanor charges and sentenced to three years probation, community service, and fines. This led to a debate on whether the students' protest was free speech and whether filing criminal charges against them was fair after UCI had already disciplined them. Critics argued that the students were victims of selective prosecution and that they were targeted because they were Muslims and supported the Palestinians.\nIn early July 2018, UC Irvine removed benefactor Francisco J. Ayala's name from its biology school and central science library after an internal investigation by the university's Office of Equal Opportunity and Diversity substantiated a number of sexual harassment claims. Chancellor Gillman also authorized the removal of the Ayala name from graduate fellowships, scholar programs, and endowed chairs. Ayala resigned July 1, 2018 and was ordered to abstain from future university activities, following the university's consultative procedures that include a faculty review committee. The results from the investigation were compiled in a 97-page report, which included testimony from victims of Ayala.\nCampus.\nThe layout of the core campus resembles a rough circle with its center being Aldrich Park (initially known as Campus Park), lined up by the Ring Mall and buildings surrounding the road. To further emphasize the layout, academic units are positioned relative to the center, wherein undergraduate schools are closer to the center than the graduate schools.\nAs of 2010, Aldrich Park is planted with over 11,120 trees (there are over 24,000 trees on the entire campus), including 33 species of eucalyptus. At the time, it was one of 74 campuses nationwide to earn the designation of \"Tree Campus USA\" from the Arbor Day Foundation. Two ceremonial trees were planted in 1990, one for Arbor Day and the second for former chancellor Daniel Aldrich who had died that year. On the first anniversary of the September 11th tragedies, the chancellor planted a bay laurel tree in remembrance of the heroes and victims of the events of September 11, 2001. The tree itself was a gift from the UCI Staff Assembly. Aldrich Park is the site for \"Wayzgoose\", a medieval student festival held each year in conjunction with the \"Celebrate UCI\" open house. It also hosts many extracurricular activities.\nRing Mall is the main pedestrian road used by students and faculty to travel around the core campus. The road measures up to a perfect mile and completely encircles Aldrich Park. Most schools and libraries orbit this road with each of these schools having their own central plaza which also connects to the park.\nOther areas of the university outside of the core campus such as the School of Arts are connected by four pedestrian bridges. Beyond the core campus and the bridges, the layout of the campus is more suburban.\nSurroundings.\nIrvine, California consistently ranks as the safest city in the United States. UCI is close to the beaches, mountains, and attractions of Southern California. Disneyland is approximately 20 minutes away by car. While the university is located in Irvine, the campus is directly bounded by the city of Newport Beach and the community of Newport Coast. The western side of the campus borders the San Diego Creek and the San Joaquin Freshwater Marsh Reserve, through which Campus Drive connects UCI to the 405 freeway. The northern and eastern sides of UCI are adjacent to Irvine proper; the eastern side of the campus is delineated by Bonita Canyon Road, which turns into Culver Drive at its northern terminus. California State Route 73 marks UCI's southern boundary and separates the campus from Newport Beach.\nThe \"North Campus\" houses the Facilities Management Department, the Faculty Research Facility, Central Receiving, Fleet Services, the Air Pollution Health Effects Laboratory, and the 1.2 million square foot Irvine Campus Medical Complex (ICMC). It is located next to the UCI Arboretum, which was closed until further notice due to the COVID-19 pandemic with plans to relocate to the main campus. Both the North Campus and the arboretum are located about from the main campus. In 2024, construction of the Joe C. Wen &amp; Family UCI Health Center for Advanced Care and the Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center was completed. In late 2025, an all-electric 144-bed acute care hospital will follow suit, making this the nation\u2019s first medical center to be powered by an all-electric central utilities plant. \nWilliam Pereira's original street layout for the region surrounding the university had a wingnut-shaped loop road as the main thoroughfare, which twice crossed the campus. However, the Irvine Company's development plans expanded before it could be completed, and portions of California, Carlson, Harvard and Turtle Rock roads today constitute segments of what would have been the Loop Road.\nDespite the suburban environment, a variety of wildlife inhabits the university's central park, open fields, and wetlands. The university is home to cougar, hawks, golden eagles, great blue herons, squirrels, opossums, peregrine falcons, rabbits, raccoons, owls, skunks, weasels, bats, and coyotes. The UCI Arboretum hosts a collection of plants from California and Mediterranean climates around the world. The rabbits in particular can be seen across campus in high numbers, especially during hours of low student traffic.\nArchitecture.\nThe first buildings were designed by a team of architects led by William Pereira and including A. Quincy Jones and William Blurock. The initial landscaping, including Aldrich Park, was designed by an association of three firms, including that of the noted urban-landscaping innovator Robert Herrick Carter. Aldrich Park was designed under the direction of landscape architect Gene Uematsu, and was modeled after Frederick Law Olmsted's designs for New York City's Central Park. The campus opened in 1965 with the inner circle and park only half-completed. There were only nine buildings and a dirt road connecting the main campus to the housing units. Only three of the six \"spokes\" that radiate from the central park were built, with only two buildings each. Pereira was retained by the university to maintain a continuity of style among the buildings constructed in the inner ring around the park, the last of which was completed in 1974. These buildings were designed with the appearance of being displayed on \"pedestals\" (containing the first floor and basement levels) that elevated them above the rolling terrain, with distinctive white railings evoking the deck of an ocean liner. They additionally feature an elevated second pedestrian level above ground, originally intended as a \"skyway\" to connect all the buildings in each of the six \"spokes\".\nConstruction on the campus all but ceased after the Administration building, Aldrich Hall, was completed in 1974, and then resumed in the late 1980s, beginning a massive building boom that continues today. This second building boom continued the futuristic trend, but emphasized a much more colorful, postmodern approach that somewhat contradicted the earthy, organic designs of the early buildings. New campus architect David J. Neuman, succeeding Pereira in 1977, brought in architects such as Frank Gehry, Robert Venturi, Eric Owen Moss, James Stirling and Arthur Erickson to bring the campus more up to date. The recession in the early 1990s along with internal politics led to a change in direction, due to the reduced capital budget, and changing attitudes towards architectural innovation at the university. This, in turn, led to a \"contextualist\" approach beginning in the late 1990s combining stylistic elements of the first two phases in an attempt to provide an architectural \"middle ground\" between the two vastly different styles. Sticking out like a \"sore thumb\" amongst the postmodern structures with its sea foam green exterior, Canadian architect Arthur Erickson's Biological Sciences II (later renamed McGaugh Hall in 2001) was designed in 1986 with Francisco Kripacz and completed in 1991. Even with its disparate color palette, reminding some of a \"plant cell\" and in stark contrast with the campus's early buildings, it was still limited to a height comparable to its surrounding buildings and constrained by the curvature of Aldrich Park. \nIn the mid-2000s, the campus underwent a historic $1.1 billion dollar expansion to keep pace with projected enrollment, adding another 2.7 million square feet of instructional and research facilities and over 20 buildings. As a consequence, Frank Gehry's Information and Computer Science/Engineering Research Facility (ICS/ERF) building, which won a Progressive Architecture Award in 1985 and had brought UCI to prominence in architectural circles, was demolished in 2007 to make way for the new six-story, 180,000 square foot Engineering Hall. It sparked outcry from architecture critics and art historians alike, while campus architect and associate vice chancellor Rebekah Gladson maintained that the ICS/ERF building was an \"interim fix\" during the building boom of the 1980s. The relatively inexpensive cost of construction, at $2 million in 1986, was merely adequate at a time when state funding was insufficient for larger, more permanent facilities. As a result, the twenty years that had passed since construction had led to problems with exterior waterproofing and structural deterioration. A target enrollment of about 30,000 students, which called for higher density accommodations on campus were other motivators for the razing. Two buildings designed by Frank Gehry in the Henry Samueli School of Engineering still remain today, the McDonnell Douglas Engineering Auditorium and the Rockwell Engineering Center, completed in 1990. \nIn a later reversal of Pereira's vision, a 2008 earthquake retrofit of Steinhaus Hall saw the removal of Pereira's signature sunshades for a \"flat skin of stone and glass\", after the precast originals had deteriorated and presented a hazard for those walking below.\nIn 2009, the Humanities Gateway building, designed by Curtis W. Fentress, was opened. The curvilinear design marked a return to the sculptural treatment of concrete begun by Pereira. The design sought to encapsulate the multifaceted nature of a humanities education, with a split-persona inspired by Janus, the two-faced god of mythological literature. The side that faces the Humanities Quad and the interior of the campus was intended to maintain formality and harmony with existing campus architecture while the opposing courtyard side contrasts this with an organic, free-flowing design. In addition, it achieved 57 of the 69 benchmark points (minimum 52) required to reach USGBC's LEED Platinum certification, which recognizes new construction that has gone above and beyond in incorporating eco-friendly features in its design and operations. This was the first building on campus to receive the distinction.\nLibraries and study centers.\nIn addition to holding a noted critical theory archive and Southeast Asian archive, the Libraries also contain extensive collections in Dance and Performing Arts, Regional History, and more. Additionally, Langson Library hosts an extensive East Asian collection with materials in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean.\nNearly all departments and schools on campus complement the resources of the UC Irvine Libraries by maintaining their own reading rooms and scholarly meeting rooms. They contain small reference collections and are the choice for more intimate lectures, graduate seminars, and study sessions. There is also the large Gateway Study Center located across from Langson Library, one of the university's original buildings and under the custody of UC Irvine Libraries. Having served formerly as a cafeteria and student center, it is now a dual-use computer lab and study area which is open nearly 24 hours.\nThe UCI Student Center offers a large number of study areas, auditoriums, and two food courts, and therefore is one of the most popular places to study on campus. UC Irvine also has a number of computer labs that serve as study centers. The School of Humanities maintains the Humanities Instructional Resource Center, a drop-in computer lab specializing in language and digital media. Additionally, UCI maintains five other drop-in labs, four instructional computer labs, and a number of reservation-only SmartClassrooms, some of which are open 24 hours. Other popular study areas include Aldrich Park, the Cross-Cultural Center, the Locus (a study room and computer lab used by the Campuswide Honors Program), and plazas located in every school.\nTunnels.\nA network of tunnels runs between many of the major buildings on campus and the Central Plant, with the major trunk passage located beneath Ring Mall. Smaller tunnels branch off from this main passage to reach individual buildings, carrying electrical and air-conditioning utilities from the Central Plant. These tunnels have been the subject of much campus lore, the most popular story being that the tunnels were constructed to facilitate the safe evacuation of faculty in the event of a student riot. The main tunnel actually contains an above-ground section, in the form of the interior of an unusually thick pedestrian bridge near the Engineering Tower, in an area where the Ring Mall crosses between two hills. The tunnels are only accessible to maintenance staff, although there are also publicly accessible tunnels which intersect the utility tunnels, such as the one that goes between the main Information &amp; Computer Science building and the Engineering Tower.\nWashington Center.\nThe University of California, Irvine, is one of nine UC undergraduate campuses that sends students to the University of California, Washington DC (UCDC) program. This is a UC systemwide program housed in the University of California Washington Center, located on Scott Circle in Downtown Washington (\n). The center serves as the headquarters of the University of California Office of Federal Governmental Relations and supports UC students interning in the District of Columbia. UC Washington Center is currently led by UC Merced sociology professor, Tanya Golash-Boza.\nGovernance.\nLike other University of California campuses, UC Irvine operates under a system of shared governance, or a partnership between the Chancellor and his administration and the faculty through the Academic Senate. The Chancellor is the chief campus officer and has authority over the campus budget. The Academic Senate has authority to determine the conditions for admission and supervise courses and curricula. The Chancellor is nominated by and is responsible to the Regents of the University of California and the UC President.\nAfter the Chancellor, the second most senior official is the Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost, the university's chief academic and operating officer. Every school on campus reports to the Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost through a Dean, and all other academic and administrative units report to his office through a Vice Chancellor or chief administrator. A partial list of these units includes Campus Recreation, Intercollegiate Athletics, Planning and Budget, Student Affairs, UC Irvine Libraries, UC Irvine Medical Center, and University Advancement.\nAcademics.\nAcademic units.\nUC Irvine's academic units are referred to as schools. As of the 2023\u20132024 school year, there were fifteen schools and several interdisciplinary programs. The College of Health Sciences was established in 2004, but no longer exists as a separate academic unit. On November 16, 2006, the University of California Regents approved the establishment of the School of Law. The School of Education was established by the UC Regents in 2012. In 2016, the university announced that it had received a $40 million donation from Bill Gross' philanthropic foundation to turn its nursing science program into the Sue and Bill Gross School of Nursing. The UC Regents formally approved the establishment of the school in January 2017. In July 2020, the UC Regents approved the establishment of the School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences. In July of 2024, UCI received a gift of $50 million to support the transition of the former Program in Public health to the Joe C. Wen School of Population and Public Health, named for the donor and his family. Supplementary education programs offer accelerated or community education in the form of Summer Session and UC Irvine Extension.\nThe academic units consist of (with their founding in parentheses):\nHealth care.\nThe School of Medicine constitutes the professional schools of health science. The UC Irvine Medical Center is ranked among the nation's top 50 hospitals by \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\" for the 12th consecutive year. The school has 19 clinical and 6 basic science departments with 560 full-time and 1,300 volunteer faculty members involved in teaching, patient care, and medical and basic science research. With an acceptance rate of 3.98% for 6,929 applicants in 2025, it is among the nation's 20 most selective medical schools.\nResearch organizations.\nUCI's many research organizations are either chaired by or composed of UCI faculty, frequently draw upon undergraduates and graduates for research assistance, and produce innovations, patents, and scholarly works. Some are housed in a school or department office; others are housed in their own facilities. These are a few of the research organizations at UCI:\nRankings.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nGlobal.\nAmong universities under 50 years of age, \"Times Higher Education\" ranked UCI 4th in the world and 1st in the US for 2012, 5th in the world and 1st in the US for 2013, 7th in the world and 1st in the US in 2014, and 7th in the world and 1st in the US in 2015. 2015 was the final year UCI was eligible for this ranking. In 2025, THE ranked UCI's Psychology program 42nd, their law school 66th, and Computer Science program as 75th globally. Nationally, the university was 35th overall. In 2025's Academic Ranking of World Universities, UC Irvine was 34th among US universities and ranked globally in the subjects Atmospheric Science (10), Law (14), Education (25), Water Resources (31), and Psychology (32). The 2024 World University Rankings by CWUR ranked UC Irvine 85th globally out of 20,966 universities and 44th nationally, placing it among the top 0.5% in the world. UCI's graduate philosophy program ranks among the finest worldwide, according to the Philosophical Gourmet Report, with the Department of Philosophy and the Department of Logic and Philosophy of Science jointly achieving a 28th position in global rankings. The Webometrics Ranking of World Universities for 2024 ranked UCI 31st in the world, using \"web indicators as proxies to assess [universities'] global performance comprehensively, considering its activities, outputs, relevance, and impact\". The composite score was determined by \"visibility\" (24th), \"transparency\" (22nd), and \"excellence\" (83rd).\nNational.\nFor 2026, \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\" ranked UC Irvine tied for 32nd among national universities in the U.S., tied for 9th among public universities, 12th in \"Top Performers on Social Mobility\", tied for 56th in \"Most Innovative Schools\", and tied for 35th in \"Best Undergraduate Engineering Programs\".In 2019, \"Forbes\" ranked UCI 3rd out of the 300 Best Value Colleges, based on Return on Investment.In 2017, \"Kiplinger\" ranked UCI 26th out of the top 100 best-value public colleges and universities in the nation, and 5th in California.In 2018, \"Sierra Magazine\" ranked UCI 1st in its \"Coolest Schools\" in America list for campus sustainability and climate change efforts. In 2021, it was ranked 2nd, marking the 12th time in a row it had placed in the top 10.In 2024, The Princeton Review ranked UCI 5th among public universities by return on investment (ROI) in its Best Value Colleges list. It also ranked 13th in ROI among public schools for students that do not qualify for financial aid.\nWashington Monthly's 2025 Best Colleges For Research ranked UCI 34th out of 139 institutions, based on total search spending, science and engineering PhDs awarded, faculty receiving major national awards, and the share of faculty elected to the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. \nFor 2025-26, Niche, whose ranking methodology combines both student experiential reviews with objective metrics supplied from third-party institutions, ranked UCI 63rd nationally amongst colleges (including LACs) and 18th amongst public universities. It ranked UCI in the top 50 nationally for Criminal Justice (6), Public Health (15), Film and Photography (27), Performing Arts (24), Music (28), Psychology (30), Computer Science (39), Education (33), Anthropology and Sociology (37), Physics (48), Math (39), Engineering (39), Chemistry (40), Biology (46), International Relations (47), and Philosophy (49).\nIn addition, many of UCI's graduate programs are ranked in the top 50 of the 2025 \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\" rankings: Criminology (2), Organic Chemistry (14), English (21), Chemistry (24), Sociology (20), Computer Science (27), Public Health (27), Physics (35), Psychology (27), Law (38), Statistics (27), Education (18), Biological Sciences (32), Earth Sciences (27), History (42), Engineering (37), Business Part-Time MBA (23), Political Science (41), Mathematics (34), and Economics (41).\nLearned societies affiliations.\nUCI faculty are affiliated with the following learned societies.\nAdmissions.\nUndergraduate\nUC Irvine is categorized by \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\" as \"most selective\" for college admissions in the United States. It was the third-most selective University of California campus for the freshman class entering in the fall of 2019, as measured by the ratio of admitted students to applicants (behind UC Berkeley and UCLA). UC Irvine received 124,231 applications for admission to the fall 2025 incoming freshman class and 35,964 were admitted, making UC Irvine's acceptance rate 28.94% for fall 2025. The first-year median weighted GPA was 4.19 for fall 2025. \nThe incoming 2025 freshmen were predominantly from Orange County (25.7%), followed by Los Angeles County (25.3%), San Diego County (7.3%), Riverside County (7.0%), and San Bernardino County (5.4%). Of the 2025 freshmen international students, a majority came from Asia. 67.0% were from China, 6.1% from India, 5.6% from South Korea, 4.0% from Taiwan, and a distant 1.9% from Canada.\nAdmission and yield rates also vary by the residency of applicants. For Fall 2025, California residents had a selectivity rate of 21.9% out of 86,230 applicants, with a yield rate of 25.7%. Out of state residents saw greater rate of admission, with 47.5% of 16,381 applicants receiving acceptance. However, only 5.8% of those admitted went on to enroll. Of the 21,620 international students who applied, 42.8% were accepted and 11.9% went on to enroll.\nThat year, the most popular major for freshmen (excluding transfers) was Undeclared (15.4%), followed by Biological Sciences (12.8%), Business Administration (4.0%), Computer Science (3.9%), Public Health Sciences (3.7%), and Political Science (3.3%).\nThe choice to offer admission is based on the University of California's comprehensive review program, which considers a candidate's personal situation, community involvement, extracurricular activities, and academic potential in addition to the traditional high school academic record, personal statement, and entrance examination scores. While residency is not a factor in admission, it is a factor in tuition expenses, with out-of-state residents fees much greater than California residents. Since the approval of Proposition 209 in November 1996, California state law has prohibited all public universities (including UC Irvine) from practicing affirmative action as part of their admissions processes.\nGraduate \nIn Fall 2025, The School of Law enrolled 189 out of 3,720 applicants for an enrolling class that has a median LSAT score of 169 (166-170 interquartile range), and median GPA of 3.80 (interquartile range 3.59-3.90). In Fall of 2024, the acceptance rate was 17.38%. The School of Medicine admitted 273 of 6,929 applicants for the 2024-25 academic year for an admission rate of 3.98%, placing it among the nation's 20 most selective medical schools. Of the 273 admitted students, 114 matriculated, with an observed median GPA of 3.94 and median MCAT score of 516 among the 2024 MS1 (first-year) class. \nDiscoveries and innovation.\nMachine Learning Repository.\nThe University of California Irvine hosts the UCI Machine Learning Repository, a data resource which is very popular among machine learning researchers and data mining practitioners. It was created in 1987 and contains 622 datasets from several domains including biology, medicine, physics, engineering, social sciences, games, and others. The datasets contained in the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository have been used by thousands of students and researchers in the computer science community and facilitated the publication of approximately 26 thousand scientific articles.\nStudent life.\nFraternities and sororities.\nThe first fraternities and sororities at UCI began in 1973 with three sororities and three fraternities.\nClubs and organizations.\nThere are around 600 student clubs and organizations on campus. Campus activities throughout the year include cultural nights, arts performances, and live music at Anteater Plaza. Special events such as Aldrich Park After Dark, Summerlands, Soulstice, and Earth Day are held yearly. ASUCI, the university's undergraduate student government, traditionally organizes a world record attempt by the university at the beginning of each academic year. UCI has won Guinness World Records for the largest game of capture the flag six times, with the most recent one in September 2015. In addition, the university has broken the record for the largest game of dodgeball three years straight. They have also won records for largest water pistol fight and largest pillow fight.\nResidential accommodations.\nUC Irvine has a number of residential options for students interested in living on campus, and guarantees two years of housing to undergraduates who are single and under the age of 25. Part of UCI's 2007 long-range development plan involves expanding on-campus housing to accommodate 60% of all UCI students, and to support a growing graduate population. In the wake of the pandemic, the university has considered additional construction as student demand in the surrounding region soars, placing a strain on the housing available. As of 2024, UCI houses approximately 17,878 students or about 50% of the campus enrollment, with plans to add another 1,000 beds by 2030.\nMiddle Earth.\nMiddle Earth is a student housing complex that includes housing approximately 1,784 first-year students in 24 \"classics\" residence halls, and another 640 in two five-level \"towers\", a student center (Pippin Center), dining facility (Brandywine) and several resource centers. Each hall houses 48\u201396 students, although Quenya was built with sixty single-suite rooms originally intended for graduate students. The names of the halls and other facilities were selected from J.R.R. Tolkien's legendarium.\nMiddle Earth is located along Ring Road, toward the core of the university's campus. The residence halls were built in three consecutive phases, beginning in 1974. The first phase was designed by William Pereira. The first phase included seven halls: Hobbiton, Isengard, Lorien, Mirkwood, Misty Mountain, Rivendell, and the Shire, along with a separate Head Resident's manufactured home called \"Bag End\". The second phase was built in 1989 with thirteen more halls: Balin, Harrowdale, Whispering Wood, Woodhall, Calmindon, Grey Havens, Aldor, Rohan, Gondolin, Snowbourn, Elrond, Shadowfax, and Quenya. The third phase was built in 2000 with four halls: Crickhollow, Evenstar, Oakenshield, and Valimar. The last phase was completed in the summer of 2019 and officially opened September 16, 2019; although reported in the media as being called the two towers of Middle Earth, its two buildings are actually named Telperion and Laurelin, after the Two Trees of Valinor. These towers house around 640 undergraduate students.\nMesa Court.\nMesa Court is another housing community intended for freshman as part of the \"First Year Experience\". It houses around 3,484 students in 29 \"classics\" halls and four residential towers. The towers themselves accommodate 1,440 students and include study areas, computer labs, a fitness center, with shared kitchenettes and laundry facilities. Situated below \"Caballo\", one of the towers, is the other major dining facility on campus (The Anteatery) which can serve 780 students at maximum. The most recent addition, Oso Tower, was completed in 2025 and began accommodating around 400 residents for the 2025-26 school year.\nMesa Court is situated closer to the northern edge of campus and is fed via pedestrian bridges from the Student Center and the School of Humanities making it less connected to the core campus than Middle Earth. Located in close proximity are the Claire Trevor School of the Arts and the Bren Events Center. \nEast Campus Student Housing.\nAmerican Campus Communities.\nFor continuing and transfer students, apartments in East Campus have been privately managed and constructed in phases by a partnership with American Campus Communities since 2004 through a ground lease to Collegiate Housing Foundation as a non-profit owner. The first phase of apartments, Vista del Campo, was completed in 2004 and houses 1,488 students in 488 units. The second phase, Vista del Campo Norte, consists of 1,564 beds distributed across 545 units and began operation in 2006. The third phase, Puerta del Sol and Camino del Sol, finished construction in 2010, adding 2,111 spaces, combined, in two separate townhome communities. This phase of construction also added an 1,822 stall parking garage, located adjacent to the Anteater Recreation Center. The most recent phase, was completed in two stages: In 2019, the completion of Plaza Verde added 1,441 beds, and Plaza Verde II finished in 2023 to provide accommodations for another 1,077 students. These two complexes share a community center and 543-stall parking structure. \nArroyo Vista.\nAdditional on-campus housing for undergraduates under the age of 25 in East Campus comes in the form of a community of 42 academic theme, fraternity, and sorority chapter houses. Over two-thirds of the houses are Academic Theme Houses, which are sponsored by academic programs and group together students of similar areas of study. The rest are available for occupation through Greek life organizations.\nGraduate Housing.\nFull-time graduate students are guaranteed on-campus housing for the duration of a determined \"normal time to degree\" for their program, and as long as they maintain good academic standing. They are accommodated in either the Palo Verde, Verano Place, Campus Village, or ACC apartments.\nVerano Place.\nThe Verano Place apartments first began housing graduate students in 1966, not long after the founding of the university. Subsequent development has supplemented the original residence halls with higher-density housing for a predominantly medical, law, and graduate student population of about 2,095.\nIn summer of 2022, the Verano 8 Graduate Student Housing Community was completed, adding 1,055 beds across five seven-story buildings to help alleviate the demand of a growing graduate population. Included in the housing community is a community center and an 853-stall parking garage.\nAthletics.\nUC Irvine's sports teams are known as the Anteaters and the student body is known as Antourage. They currently participate in the NCAA's Division I, as members of the Big West Conference and the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation. In the early years of the school's existence, the teams participated at the NCAA Division II level with great success as explained in the UC Irvine Anteaters page. UC Irvine fields nationally competitive teams in baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, track and field, volleyball and water polo. The university has won 28 national championships in nine different sports, and fielded 64 individual national champions, 53 Olympians and over 500 All-Americans.\nThe university's most recent NCAA Division I national championship was won by the men's volleyball team in 2013. UC Irvine men's volleyball won four national championships in 2007, 2009, 2012 and 2013.\nUC Irvine won three NCAA Division I men's water polo titles, with championships in 1970, 1982 and 1989.\nUC Irvine Anteaters baseball won back-to-back national championships at the NCAA College Division College World Series and the NCAA Division II College World Series in 1973 and 1974. Anteater baseball moved to the NCAA Division I level. The 2007 baseball team finished 3rd at the College World Series, and in 2009 the baseball team earned a No. 1 national ranking in NCAA Division I polls from Baseball America and Collegiate Baseball for the first time, as well as a national seed and the right to host an NCAA Regional. The 2014 baseball team returned to the College World Series and finished 5th.\nUCI Anteater's golf team won the NCAA Division II national team championship in 1975 with team member Jerry Wisz winning the individual title. At the NCAA national championships in 1973, 1974 and 1976, those teams finished second twice and fourth the other year. These teams included seven All-Americans.\nIn 2015, for the first time, the UC Irvine Anteaters men's basketball team appeared in the Division I tournament. It was narrowly defeated in a first-round tournament game by Louisville. The Anteaters made their second NCAA appearance in 2019, beating fourth-seed Kansas State University for their first March Madness win ever.\nPeople.\nUC Irvine has more than 200,000 living alumni. These include astronauts (Tracy Caldwell Dyson), athletes (Steve Scott, Scott Brooks, Greg Louganis and 53 Olympians), Broadway, film, and television actors (Bob Gunton, James LeGros, Jon Lovitz, Brian Thompson, Teal Wicks, Windell Middlebrooks), technological innovators (Roy Fielding, Paul Mockapetris, and Patrick J. Hanratty), educators (Erin Gruwell), musicians (Kevin Kwan Loucks), and scientists (Mika Tosca).\nFive people affiliated with UCI have been honored with the Nobel Prize: three faculty members, one postdoctoral scholar, and one alumnus. In 1995, professor Frank Sherwood Rowland along with postdoctoral student Mario Molina won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry while Frederick Reines won the Nobel Prize in Physics. In 1974, Rowland and Molina worked together to discover the harmful effects of CFCs on the ozone layer, while Reines received the Nobel Prize for his work in discovering the neutrino. In 2004, Irwin Rose, a professor at the School of Medicine, was co-awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry along with two professors from the Technion for the discovery of ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. Additionally, David MacMillan, who completed his PhD. from UCI in 1996 was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2021 for the development of asymmetric organocatalysis.\nSeven Pulitzer Prize winners have been associated with UCI, including three faculty members and four alumni. These include Michael Chabon, who won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 2001 for The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay, and Richard Ford, who won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1996 for Independence Day. Claude Yarbrough (aka Jonathan Pendragon), class of '76, is one of the most influential magicians of the 20th and 21st centuries. Thomas Keneally was a visiting professor at UCI in 1985 (when he taught the graduate fiction workshop) and again from 1991 to 1995 (when he was a visiting professor in the writing program). Keneally is most famous for his book \"Schindler's Ark\" (1982) (later republished as \"Schindler's List\"), which won the Booker Prize and is the basis of the film \"Schindler's List\" that was directed by Steven Spielberg.\nThe Comparative Literature and Philosophy departments at Irvine have accommodated distinguished intellectuals of international acclaim, including Jacques Derrida, a philosopher and critic most commonly associated with postmodern and post-structuralist thought, who held a position at the University of California, Irvine Department of Comparative Literature from 1986 to his death in 2004; his colleague, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard, who taught at UCI from 1987 until 1994; Fellow at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, British philosopher Margaret Gilbert best known for her founding contributions to the analytic philosophy of social phenomena; and British philosopher and FRSE Duncan Pritchard.\nIn addition to the Department of Philosophy at UCI, its sister department, the Department of Logic and Philosophy of Science, which together are ranked as one of the top philosophy programs in the world, also accommodates philosophers such as Brian Skyrms, known for his contributions on game theory and social norms; Jeffrey A. Barrett, known for his contributions to philosophy of physics; and Kai Wehmeier, known for his contributions to Frege.\nRalph J. Cicerone, an earth system science professor and former chancellor of UCI, served as president of the National Academy of Sciences from 2005 to 2016.\nThree UCI faculty members have been named National Medal of Science recipients. In January 2009, UCI Professor Reg Penner won the Faraday Medal for his research with nanowires.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "44758", "revid": "12336988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44758", "title": "Goldbach's conjecture", "text": "Even integers as sums of two primes\nGoldbach's conjecture is one of the oldest and best-known unsolved problems in number theory and all of mathematics. It states that every even natural number greater than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers.\nThe conjecture has been shown to hold for all natural numbers less than , but remains unproven despite considerable effort.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nOn 7 June 1742, the Prussian mathematician Christian Goldbach wrote a letter to Leonhard Euler (letter XLIII), in which he proposed the following conjecture:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Every integer that can be written as the sum of two primes can also be written as the sum of as many primes (including unity) as one wishes, until all terms are units.\nGoldbach was following the now-abandoned convention of considering 1 to be a prime number, so that a sum of units would be a sum of primes. He then proposed a second conjecture in the margin of his letter, which implies the first:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It seems at least, that every integer greater than 2 can be written as the sum of three primes.\nEuler replied in a letter dated 30 June 1742 and reminded Goldbach of an earlier conversation they had had (), in which Goldbach had remarked that the first of those two conjectures would follow from the statement\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;Every positive even integer can be written as the sum of two primes.\nThis is in fact equivalent to his second, marginal conjecture. In the letter dated 30 June 1742, Euler stated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;That\u00a0... every even integer is a sum of two primes, I regard as a completely certain theorem, although I cannot prove it.\nSimilar conjecture by Descartes.\nRen\u00e9 Descartes wrote, \"Every even number can be expressed as the sum of at most three primes.\" This proposition is similar to, but weaker than, Goldbach's conjecture. Paul Erd\u0151s said, \"Descartes actually discovered this before Goldbach ... but it is better that the conjecture was named for Goldbach because, mathematically speaking, Descartes was infinitely rich and Goldbach was very poor.\"\nPartial results.\nGoldbach's conjecture involving the sum of two primes is much more difficult than the weak Goldbach conjecture, which says that every odd integer greater than 5 is the sum of three primes. Using Vinogradov's method, Nikolai Chudakov, Johannes van der Corput, and Theodor Estermann showed (1937\u20131938) that almost all even numbers can be written as the sum of two primes (in the sense that the fraction of even numbers up to some N which can be so written tends towards 1 as N increases). In 1930, Lev Schnirelmann proved that any natural number greater than 1 can be written as the sum of not more than C prime numbers, where C is an effectively computable constant; see Schnirelmann density. Schnirelmann's constant is the lowest number C with this property. Schnirelmann himself obtained \"C\" &lt;. This result was subsequently enhanced by many authors, such as Olivier Ramar\u00e9, who in 1995 showed that every even number \"n\" \u2265 4 is in fact the sum of at most 6 primes. The best known result stems from the proof of the weak Goldbach conjecture by Harald Helfgott, which directly implies that every even number \"n\" \u2265 4 is the sum of at most 4 primes.\nIn 1924, Hardy and Littlewood showed under the assumption of the generalized Riemann hypothesis that the number of even numbers up to X violating the Goldbach conjecture is much less than \"X\"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20442 + \"c\" for small c.\nIn 1948, using sieve theory methods, Alfr\u00e9d R\u00e9nyi showed that every sufficiently large even number can be written as the sum of a prime and an almost prime with at most K factors. Chen Jingrun showed in 1973 using sieve theory that every sufficiently large even number can be written as the sum of either two primes, or a prime and a semiprime (the product of two primes). See Chen's theorem for further information.\nIn 1975, Hugh Lowell Montgomery and Bob Vaughan showed that \"most\" even numbers are expressible as the sum of two primes. More precisely, they showed that there exist positive constants c and C such that for all sufficiently large numbers N, every even number less than N is the sum of two primes, with at most \"CN\"1 \u2212 \"c\" exceptions. In particular, the set of even integers that are not the sum of two primes has density zero.\nIn 1951, Yuri Linnik proved the existence of a constant K such that every sufficiently large even number is the sum of two primes and at most K powers of 2. J\u00e1nos Pintz and Imre Ruzsa found in 2020 that \"K\" = 8 works. Assuming the generalized Riemann hypothesis, \"K\" = 7 also works, as shown by Roger Heath-Brown and Jan-Christoph Schlage-Puchta in 2002.\nIn 2013, Harald Helfgott submitted a proof of the weak conjecture to the \"Annals of Mathematics Studies\" book series. The article was accepted, but Helfgott decided to undertake major modifications suggested by the referee. Despite several revisions, Helfgott's proof has not yet appeared in a peer-reviewed publication. The weak conjecture is implied by the Goldbach conjecture, as if \"n\" \u2212 3 is a sum of two primes, then n is a sum of three primes. But the converse implication and thus the Goldbach conjecture remain unproven even if Helfgott's proof is correct.\nComputational results.\nFor small values of n, the strong Goldbach conjecture (and hence the weak Goldbach conjecture) can be verified directly. For instance, in 1938, Nils Pipping laboriously verified the conjecture up to \"n\" \n . With the advent of computers, many more values of n have been checked; T. Oliveira e Silva ran a distributed computer search that has verified the conjecture for \"n\" \u2264 (and double-checked up to ) as of 2013. One record from this search is that is the smallest number that cannot be written as a sum of two primes where one is smaller than 9781.\nIn popular culture.\n\"Goldbach's Conjecture\" () is the title of Xu Chi's biography of Chinese mathematician and number theorist Chen Jingrun.\nThe conjecture is a central point in the plot of Apostolos Doxiadis's 1992 novel \"Uncle Petros and Goldbach's Conjecture\", in Isaac Asimov's short story \"Sixty Million Trillion Combinations\", and in Michelle Richmond's 2008 mystery novel \"No One You Know\".\nGoldbach's conjecture is part of the plot of the 2007 Spanish film \"Fermat's Room\".\nGoldbach's conjecture is featured as the main topic of research of the eponymous character Marguerite in the 2023 French-Swiss film \"Marguerite's Theorem\".\nFormal statement.\nEach of the three conjectures has a natural analog in terms of the modern definition of a prime, under which 1 is excluded. A modern version of the first conjecture is:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;Every integer that can be written as the sum of two primes can also be written as the sum of as many primes as one wishes, until either all terms are two (if the integer is even) or one term is three and all other terms are two (if the integer is odd).\nA modern version of the marginal conjecture is:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;Every integer greater than 5 can be written as the sum of three primes.\nAnd a modern version of Goldbach's older conjecture of which Euler reminded him is:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;Every even integer greater than 2 can be written as the sum of two primes.\nThese modern versions might not be entirely equivalent to the corresponding original statements. For example, if there were an even integer \"N\" \n \"p\" + 1 larger than 4, for p a prime, that could not be expressed as the sum of two primes in the modern sense, then it would be a counterexample to the modern version of the third conjecture (without being a counterexample to the original version). The modern version is thus probably stronger (but in order to confirm that, one would have to prove that the first version, freely applied to any positive even integer n, could not possibly rule out the existence of such a specific counterexample N). In any case, the modern statements have the same relationships with each other as the older statements did. That is, the second and third modern statements are equivalent, and either implies the first modern statement.\nThe third modern statement (equivalent to the second) is the form in which the conjecture is usually expressed today. It is also known as the \"strong\", \"even\", or \"binary\" Goldbach conjecture. A weaker form of the second modern statement, known as \"Goldbach's weak conjecture\", the \"odd Goldbach conjecture\", or the \"ternary Goldbach conjecture\", asserts that \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;Every odd integer greater than 7 can be written as the sum of three odd primes.\nHeuristic justification.\nStatistical considerations that focus on the probabilistic distribution of prime numbers present informal evidence in favour of the conjecture (in both the weak and strong forms) for sufficiently large integers: the greater the integer, the more ways there are available for that number to be represented as the sum of two or three other numbers and the more \"likely\" it becomes that at least one of these representations consists entirely of primes.\nA very crude version of the heuristic probabilistic argument (for the strong form of the Goldbach conjecture) is as follows. The prime number theorem asserts that an integer m selected at random has roughly a chance of being prime. Thus if n is a large even integer and m is a number between 3 and , then one might expect the probability of m and \"n\" \u2212 \"m\" simultaneously being prime to be . If one pursues this heuristic, one might expect the total number of ways to write a large even integer n as the sum of two odd primes to be roughly\nformula_1\nSince ln \"n\" \u226a \u221a\"n\", this quantity goes to infinity as n increases, and one would expect that every large even integer has not just one representation as the sum of two primes, but in fact very many such representations.\nThis heuristic argument is actually somewhat inaccurate because it assumes that the events of m and \"n\" \u2212 \"m\" being prime are statistically independent of each other. For instance, if m is odd, then \"n\" \u2212 \"m\" is also odd, and if m is even, then \"n\" \u2212 \"m\" is even, a non-trivial relation because, besides the number 2, only odd numbers can be prime. Similarly, if n is divisible by 3, and m was already a prime other than 3, then \"n\" \u2212 \"m\" would also be coprime to 3 and thus be slightly more likely to be prime than a general number. Pursuing this type of analysis more carefully, G. H. Hardy and John Edensor Littlewood in 1923 conjectured (as part of their \"Hardy\u2013Littlewood prime tuple conjecture\") that for any fixed \"c\" \u2265 2, the number of representations of a large integer n as the sum of c primes \"n\" \n \"p\"1 + \u22ef + \"pc\" with \"p\"1 \u2264 \u22ef \u2264 \"pc\" should be asymptotically equal to\nformula_2\nwhere the product is over all primes p, and \"\u03b3\"\"c\",\"p\"(\"n\") is the number of solutions to the equation \"n\" \n \"q\"1 + \u22ef + \"qc\" mod \"p\" in modular arithmetic, subject to the constraints \"q\"1, ..., \"qc\" \u2260 0 mod \"p\". This formula has been rigorously proven to be asymptotically valid for \"c\" \u2265 3 from the work of Ivan Matveevich Vinogradov, but is still only a conjecture when \"c\" \n 2. In the latter case, the above formula simplifies to 0 when n is odd, and to\nformula_3\nwhen n is even, where \u03a02 is Hardy\u2013Littlewood's twin prime constant\nformula_4\nThis is sometimes known as the \"extended Goldbach conjecture\". The strong Goldbach conjecture is in fact very similar to the twin prime conjecture, and the two conjectures are believed to be of roughly comparable difficulty.\nGoldbach partition function.\nThe \"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Goldbach partition function\" associates to each even integer the number of ways it can be decomposed into a sum of two primes. Its graph looks like a comet and is therefore called Goldbach's comet.\nGoldbach's comet suggests tight upper and lower bounds on the number of representations of an even number as the sum of two primes, and also that the number of these representations depends strongly on the value modulo 3 of the number.\nRelated problems.\nAlthough Goldbach's conjecture implies that every positive integer greater than one can be written as a sum of at most three primes, it is not always possible to find such a sum using a greedy algorithm that uses the largest possible prime at each step. The Pillai sequence tracks the numbers requiring the largest number of primes in their greedy representations.\nSimilar problems to Goldbach's conjecture exist in which primes are replaced by other particular sets of numbers, such as the squares:\nGoldbach's conjecture is used to study computational complexity. The connection is made through the Busy Beaver function, where BB(\"n\") is the maximum number of steps taken by any \"n\" state Turing machine that halts. There is a 27-state Turing machine that halts if and only if Goldbach's conjecture is false. Hence if BB(27) was known, and the Turing machine did not stop in that number of steps, it would be known to run forever and hence no counterexamples would exist (proving the conjecture). This is a completely impractical way to settle the conjecture; instead it is used to suggest that BB(27) will be very hard to compute, at least as difficult as settling the Goldbach conjecture.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Confections are items that are rich in sugar and carbohydrates, although exact definitions are difficult. In general, however, confections are divided into two broad and somewhat overlapping categories: baker's confections and sugar confections.\nBaker's confectionery, also called flour confections, includes principally sweet pastries, cakes, and similar baked goods. Baker's confectionery excludes everyday breads, and thus is a subset of products produced by a baker.\nSugar confectionery (known as candy making in the US) includes candies (also called \"sweets\", short for \"sweetmeats\", in many English-speaking countries), candied nuts, chocolates, chewing gum, bubble gum, pastillage, and other confections that are made primarily of sugar. In some cases, chocolate confections (confections made of chocolate) are treated as a separate category, as are sugar-free versions of sugar confections. The words \"candy\" (Canada and US), \"sweets\" (UK, Ireland, and others), and \"lollies\" (Australia and New Zealand) are common words for some of the most popular varieties of sugar confectionery.\nThe occupation of confectioner encompasses the categories of cooking performed by both the French \"patissier\" (pastry chef) and the \"confiseur\" (sugar worker). The confectionery industry also includes specialized training schools and extensive historical records. Traditional confectionery goes back to ancient times and continued to be eaten through the Middle Ages and into the modern era.\nEtymology.\nThe oldest recorded use of the word \"confectionery\" discovered so far by the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" is by Richard Jonas in 1540, who spelled or misspelled it as \"confection nere\" in a passage \"Ambre, muske, frankencense, gallia muscata and confection nere\", thus in the sense of \"things made or sold by a confectioner\". \nAlso according to the OED, the sense of \"the art and business of a confectioner\" is first recorded in 1743, and the earliest use in the sense of a \"confectioner's shop\" dates to 1803.\nHistory.\nBefore sugar was readily available in the ancient western world, confectionery was based on honey. Honey was used in Ancient China, Ancient India, Ancient Egypt, Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome to coat fruits and flowers to preserve them or to create sweetmeats. Between the 6th and 4th centuries BCE, the Persians, followed by the Greeks, made contact with the Indian subcontinent and its \"reeds that produce honey without bees\". They adopted and then spread sugar and sugarcane agriculture. Sugarcane is indigenous to tropical Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia.\nIn the early history of sugar usage in Europe, it was initially the apothecary who had the most important role in the production of sugar-based preparations. Medieval European physicians learned the medicinal uses of the material from the Arabs and Byzantine Greeks. One Middle Eastern remedy for rheums and fevers were little, twisted sticks of pulled sugar called in Arabic or \"\". These became known in England as alphenics, or more commonly as penidia, penids, pennet or pan sugar. They were the precursors of barley sugar and modern cough drops. In 1390, the Earl of Derby paid \"two shillings for two pounds of penydes.\"\nAs the non-medicinal applications of sugar developed, the comfitmaker, or confectioner gradually came into being as a separate trade. In the late medieval period the words confyt, comfect or cumfitt were generic terms for all kinds of sweetmeats made from fruits, roots, or flowers preserved with sugar. By the 16th century, a cumfit was more specifically a seed, nut or small piece of spice enclosed in a round or ovoid mass of sugar. The production of comfits was a core skill of the early confectioner, who was known more commonly in 16th and 17th century England as a comfitmaker. Reflecting their original medicinal purpose, however, comfits were also produced by apothecaries and directions on how to make them appear in dispensatories as well as cookery texts. An early medieval Latin name for an apothecary was , and it was in this sort of sugar work that the activities of the two trades overlapped and that the word \"confectionery\" originated.\nIn the cuisine of the Late Ottoman Empire diverse cosmopolitan cultural influences were reflected in published recipes such as European-style molded jellies flavored with cordials. In Europe, Ottoman confections (especially \"lumps of delight\" (Turkish delight) became very fashionable among European and British high society. An important study of Ottoman confectionery called \"Conditorei des Orients\" was published by the royal confectioner Friedrich Unger in 1838.\nThe first confectionery in Manchester, England was opened by Elizabeth Raffald who had worked six years in domestic service as a housekeeper.\nSweetening agents.\nConfections are defined by the presence of sweeteners. These are usually sugars, but it is possible to buy sugar-free candies, such as sugar-free peppermints. The most common sweetener for home cooking is table sugar, which is chemically a disaccharide containing both glucose and fructose. Hydrolysis of sucrose gives a mixture called invert sugar, which is sweeter and is also a common commercial ingredient. Finally, confections, especially commercial ones, are sweetened by a variety of syrups obtained by hydrolysis of starch. These sweeteners include all types of corn syrup.\nBaker's confectionery.\nBaker's confectionery includes sweet baked goods, especially those that are served for the dessert course. Baker's confections are sweet foods that feature flour as a main ingredient and are baked. Major categories include cakes, sweet pastries, doughnuts, scones, and cookies. In the Middle East and Asia, flour-based confections predominate.\nThe definition of which foods are \"confectionery\" vs \"bread\" can vary based on cultures and laws. In Ireland, the definition of \"bread\" as a \"staple food\" for tax purposes requires that the sugar or fat content be no more than 2% of the weight of the flour, so some products sold as bread in the US would be treated as confectionery there.\nTypes.\nCakes have a somewhat bread-like texture, and many earlier cakes, such as the centuries-old stollen (fruit cake), or the even older king cake, were rich yeast breads. The variety of styles and presentations extends from simple to elaborate. Major categories include butter cakes, tortes, and foam cakes. Confusingly, some confections that have the word \"cake\" in their names, such as cheesecake, are not technically cakes, while others, such as Boston cream pie are cakes despite seeming to be named something else.\nPastry is a large and diverse category of baked goods, united by the flour-based doughs used as the base for the product. These doughs are not always sweet, and the sweetness may come from the sugar, fruit, chocolate, cream, or other fillings that are added to the finished confection. Pastries can be elaborately decorated, or they can be plain dough.\nDoughnuts may be fried or baked.\nScones and related sweet quick breads, such as bannock, are similar to baking powder biscuits and, in sweeter, less traditional interpretations, can seem like a cupcake.\nCookies are small, sweet baked treats. They originated as small cakes, and some traditional cookies have a soft, cake-like texture. Others are crisp or hard.\nSugar confectionery.\nSugar confections include sweet, sugar-based foods, which are usually eaten as snack food. This includes sugar candies, chocolates, candied fruits and nuts, chewing gum, and sometimes ice cream. In some cases, chocolate confections are treated as a separate category, as are sugar-free versions of sugar confections. \nDifferent dialects of English use regional terms for sugar confections:\nIn the US, a chocolate-coated candy bar (e.g. Snickers) would be called a \"candy bar\", in Britain more likely a \"chocolate bar\" than unspecifically a \"sweet\".\nClassification.\nThe United Nations' International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC) scheme (revision 4) classifies both chocolate and sugar confectionery as ISIC 1073, which includes the manufacture of chocolate and chocolate confectionery; sugar confectionery proper (caramels, cachous, nougats, fondant, white chocolate), chewing gum, preserving fruit, nuts, fruit peels, and making confectionery lozenges and pastilles. In the European Union, the Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community (NACE) scheme (revision 2) matches the UN classification, under code number 10.82.\nIn the United States, the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS 2012) splits sugar confectionery across three categories: National industry code 311340 for all non-chocolate confectionery manufacturing, 311351 for chocolate and confectionery manufacturing from cacao beans, and national industry 311352 for confectionery manufacturing from purchased chocolate.\nIce cream and sorbet are classified with dairy products under ISIC 1050, NACE 10.52, and NAICS 311520. The classification of ice cream has varied widely; for example, in 1930, it was classified as a form of flour confectionery.\nExamples.\nSugar confectionery items include candies, lollipops, candy bars, chocolate, cotton candy, and other sweet items of snack food. Some of the categories and types of sugar confectionery include the following:\nStorage and shelf life.\nShelf life is largely determined by the amount of water present in the candy and the storage conditions. High-sugar candies, such as boiled candies, can have a shelf life of many years if kept covered in a dry environment. Spoilage of low-moisture candies tends to involve a loss of shape, color, texture, and flavor, rather than the growth of dangerous microbes. Impermeable packaging can reduce spoilage due to storage conditions.\nCandies spoil more quickly if they have different amounts of water in different parts of the candy (for example, a candy that combines marshmallow and nougat), or if they are stored in high-moisture environments. This process is due to the effects of water activity, which results in the transfer of unwanted water from a high-moisture environment into a low-moisture candy, rendering it rubbery, or the loss of desirable water from a high-moisture candy into a dry environment, rendering the candy dry and brittle.\nAnother factor, affecting only non-crystalline amorphous candies, is the glass transition process. This can cause amorphous candies to lose their intended texture.\nCultural roles.\nBoth baker's and sugar confections are used to offer hospitality to guests.\nConfections are used to mark celebrations or events, such as Christmas, Easter, a wedding cake, birthday cake, or Halloween. \nThe chocolate company Cadbury (under the guidance of Richard Cadbury) was the first to commercialize the connection between romance and confectionery, producing a heart-shaped box of chocolates for Valentine's Day in 1868. \nTourists commonly eat confections as part of their travels. The indulgence in rich, sugary foods is seen as a special treat, and choosing local specialties is popular. For example, visitors to Vienna eat Sachertorte and visitors to seaside resorts in the UK eat Blackpool rock candy. Transportable confections like fudges and tablet may be purchased as souvenirs.\nNutrition.\nGenerally, confections are low in micronutrients and protein but high in calories. They may be fat-free foods, although some confections, especially fried doughs and chocolate, are high-fat foods. Many confections are considered empty calories and ultra-processed foods. Specially formulated chocolate has been manufactured in the past for military use as a high-density food energy source.\nMany sugar confections, especially caramel-coated popcorn and the different kinds of sugar candy, are defined in US law as foods of minimal nutritional value.\nRisks.\nContaminants and coloring agents in confectionery can be particularly harmful to children. Therefore, confectionery contaminants, such as high levels of lead, have been restricted to 1 ppm in the US. There is no specific maximum in the EU.\nCandy colorants, particularly yellow colorants such as E102 Tartrazine, E104 Quinoline Yellow WS and E110 Sunset Yellow FCF, have many restrictions around the world. Tartrazine, for example, can cause allergic and asthmatic reactions and was once banned in Austria, Germany, and Norway. Some countries such as the UK have asked the food industry to phase out the use of these colorants, especially for products marketed to children.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Coventry had been a large settlement for centuries. Founded in the early Middle Ages, its city status was formally recognised in a charter of 1345. The city is governed by Coventry City Council, and the West Midlands Combined Authority.\nFormerly part of Warwickshire until 1451, and again from 1842 to 1974, Coventry had a population of 345,324 at the 2021 census, making it the tenth largest city in England and the 13th largest in the United Kingdom.\nIt is the second largest city in the West Midlands region, after Birmingham, from which it is separated by an area of green belt known as the Meriden Gap; and is the third largest in the wider Midlands after Birmingham and Leicester. The city is part of a larger conurbation known as the Coventry and Bedworth Urban Area, which in 2021 had a population of 389,603.\nCoventry is east-south-east of Birmingham, south-west of Leicester, north of Warwick and north-west of London. Coventry is also the most central city in England, being only south-west of the country's geographical centre in Leicestershire.\nCoventry became an important and wealthy city of national importance during the Middle Ages. Later it became an important industrial centre, becoming home to a large bicycle industry in the 19th century. In the 20th century, it became a major centre of the British motor industry; this made it a target for German air raids during the Second World War, and in November 1940, much of the historic city centre was destroyed by a large air raid.\nThe city was rebuilt after the war, and the motor industry thrived until the mid-1970s. However, by the late 1970s and early 1980s, Coventry was in an economic crisis, with one of the country's highest levels of unemployment due to major plant closures and the collapse of the respective local supply-chain. In recent years, it has seen regeneration and an increase in population. The city also has three universities: Coventry University in the city centre, the University of Warwick on the southern outskirts and the smaller private Arden University with its headquarters close to Coventry Airport. In addition, Coventry was awarded UK City of Culture for 2021.\nHistory.\nOrigins and toponymy.\nThe Romans founded a large fort on the outskirts of what is now Coventry at Baginton, next to the River Sowe; it has been excavated and partially reconstructed in modern times and is known as the Lunt Fort. The fort was probably constructed around AD 60 in connection with the Boudican revolt and then inhabited sporadically until around 280 AD.\nThe origins of the present settlement are obscure, but Coventry probably began as an Anglo-Saxon settlement. Although there are various theories of the origin of the name, the most widely accepted is that it was derived from \"Cofa's tree\"; derived from a Saxon landowner called \"Cofa\", and a tree which might have marked either the centre or the boundary of the settlement.\nMedieval.\nAround c.\u2009AD\u00a0700 a Saxon nunnery was founded here by St Osburga, which was later left in ruins by King Canute's invading Danish army in 1016. Leofric, Earl of Mercia and his wife Lady Godiva built on the remains of the nunnery and founded a Benedictine monastery in 1043 dedicated to St Mary. It was during this time that the legend of Lady Godiva riding naked on horseback through the streets of Coventry, to protest against unjust taxes levied on the citizens of Coventry by her husband, was alleged to have occurred. Although this story is regarded as a myth by modern historians, it has become an enduring part of Coventry's identity.\nA market was established at the abbey gates and the settlement expanded. At the time of the Norman Conquest in 1066, Coventry was probably a modest sized town of around 1,200 inhabitants, and its own minster church.\nCoventry Castle was a motte and bailey castle in the city. It was built in the early 12th\u00a0century by Ranulf de Gernon, 4th Earl of Chester. Its first known use was during The Anarchy when Robert Marmion, a supporter of King Stephen, expelled the monks from the adjacent priory of Saint Mary in 1144, and converted it into a fortress from which he waged a battle against the castle which was held by the Earl. Marmion perished in the battle. It was demolished in the late 12th\u00a0century. St Mary's Guildhall was built on part of the site. It is assumed the name \"Broadgate\" comes from the area around the castle gates.\nThe Bishops of Lichfield were often referred to as the Bishops of Coventry and Lichfield, or Lichfield and Coventry (from 1102 to 1541), and in the medieval period Coventry was a major centre of pilgrimage of religion. The Benedictines, Carthusians, Carmelites and Franciscans all had religious houses in the city of Coventry. The Carthusian Priory of St Anne was built between 1381 and 1410 with royal patronage from King Richard II and his queen Anne of Bohemia Coventry has some surviving religious artworks from this time, such as the doom painting at Holy Trinity Church which features Christ in judgement, figures of the resurrected, and contrasting images of Heaven and Hell.\nBy the 13th\u00a0century, Coventry had become an important centre of the cloth trade, especially blue cloth dyed with woad and known as Coventry blue. Throughout the Middle Ages, it was one of the largest and most important cities in England, which at its Medieval height in the early 15th century had a population of up to 10,000, making it the most important city in the Midlands, and possibly the fourth largest in England behind London, York and Bristol. Reflecting its importance, in around 1355, work began on a defensive city wall, which, when finally finished around 175 years later in 1530, measured long, at least high, and up to thick, it had two towers and twelve gatehouses. Coventry's city walls were described as one of the wonders of the late Middle Ages. Today, Swanswell Gate and Cook Street Gate are the only surviving gatehouses and they stand in the city centre framed by Lady Herbert's Garden.\nCoventry claimed the status of a city by ancient prescriptive usage, and was granted a charter of incorporation and coat of arms by King Edward III in 1345. The motto \"Camera Principis\" (the Prince's Chamber) refers to Edward, the Black Prince. In 1451 Coventry became a county in its own right, a status it retained until 1842, when it was reincorporated into Warwickshire.\nCoventry's importance during the Middle Ages was such, that on a two occasions a national Parliament was held there, as well as a number of Great Councils. In 1404, King Henry IV summoned a parliament in Coventry as he needed money to fight rebellion, which wealthy cities such as Coventry lent to him. During the Wars of the Roses, the Royal Court was moved to Coventry by Margaret of Anjou, the wife of Henry VI, as she believed that London had become too unsafe. On several occasions between 1456 and 1459 parliament was held in Coventry, including the so-called Parliament of Devils. For a while Coventry served as the effective seat of government, but this would come to an end in 1461 when Edward IV was installed on the throne.\nTudor period.\nIn 1506 the draper Thomas Bond founded Bond's Hospital, an almshouse in Hill Street, to provide for 10 poor men and women. This was followed in 1509 with the founding of another almshouse, when the wool merchant William Ford founded Ford's Hospital and Chantry on Greyfriars' Lane, to provide for 5 poor men and their wives.\nThroughout the Middle Ages Coventry had been home to several monastic orders and the city was badly hit by Henry VIII's dissolution of the monasteries. Between 1539 and 1542, monasteries, priories and other properties belonging to the Carmelites, Greyfriars, Benedictines and Carthusians, were either sold off or dismantled. The greatest loss to the city was of Coventry's first Cathedral, St Mary's Priory and Cathedral which was mostly demolished, leaving only ruins, making it the only English Cathedral to be destroyed during the dissolution. Coventry would not have another Cathedral until 1918, when the parish church of St Michael was elevated to Cathedral status, and it was itself destroyed by enemy bombing in 1940. Coventry therefore has had the misfortune of losing its Cathedral twice in its history.\nWilliam Shakespeare, from nearby Stratford-upon-Avon, may have witnessed plays in Coventry during his boyhood or 'teens', and these may have influenced how his plays, such as \"Hamlet\", came about.\nCivil War and aftermath.\nDuring the English Civil War Coventry became a bastion of the Parliamentarians: In August 1642, a Royalist force led by King Charles I attacked Coventry. After a two-day battle, however, the attackers were unable to breach the city walls, and the city's garrison and townspeople successfully repelled the attack, forcing the King's forces to withdraw. During the Second Civil War many Scottish Royalist prisoners were held in Coventry; it is thought likely that the idiom \"sent to Coventry\", meaning to ostracise someone, derived from this period, owing to the often hostile attitude displayed towards the prisoners by the city folk.\nFollowing the restoration of the monarchy, as punishment for the support given to the Parliamentarians, King Charles II ordered that the city's walls be slighted (damaged and made useless as defences) which was carried out in 1662.\nIndustrial age.\nIn the 18th and early 19th centuries, silk ribbon weaving and watch and clock making became Coventry's staple industries. In the 1780s, the silk ribbon weaving industry was estimated to employ around 10,000 weavers in Coventry, and its surrounding towns like Bedworth and Nuneaton. Coventry's growth was aided by the opening of the Coventry Canal in 1769, which gave the city a connection to the growing national canal network. Nevertheless, during the 18th century, Coventry lost its status as the Midlands' most important city to nearby Birmingham, which overtook Coventry in size. During the same period, Coventry became one of the three main British centres of watch and clock manufacture and ranked alongside Prescot, in Lancashire and Clerkenwell in London. By the 1841 census the population was 30,743.\nBy the 1850s, Coventry had overshadowed its rivals to become the main centre of British watch and clock manufacture, which by that time employed around 2,000 people. The watch and clock industry produced a pool of highly skilled craftsmen, who specialised in producing precision components, and the \"Coventry Watchmakers' Association\" was founded in 1858.\nAs the city prospered industrially in the 18th and early 19th centuries, several Coventry newspapers were founded. These include \"Jopson's Coventry Mercury,\" first issued by James Jopson of Hay Lane in 1741; the \"Coventry Gazette and Birmingham Chronicle\", first published in 1757; the \"Coventry Herald,\" first published in 1808; the \"Coventry Observer,\" first published in 1827; and the \"Coventry Advertiser\", first published in 1852.\nThe ribbon weaving and clock industries both rapidly collapsed after 1860, due to cheap imports following the Cobden\u2013Chevalier free trade treaty, which flooded the market with cheaper French silks, and Swiss Made clocks and watches. For a while, this caused a devastating slump in Coventry's economy.\nA second wave of industrialisation, however, began soon after. Coventry's pool of highly skilled workers attracted James Starley, who set up a company producing sewing machines in Coventry in 1861. Within a decade, he became interested in bicycles, and developed the penny-farthing design in 1870. His company soon began producing these bicycles, and Coventry soon became the centre of the British bicycle industry. Further innovation came from Starley's nephew, John Kemp Starley, who developed the Rover safety bicycle, the first true modern bicycle with two equal-sized wheels and a chain drive in 1885. By the 1890s Coventry had the largest bicycle industry in the world, with numerous manufacturers, however bicycle manufacture went into steady decline from then on, and ended entirely in 1959, when the last bicycle manufacturer in the city relocated.\nBy the late-1890s, bicycle manufacture began to evolve into motor manufacture. The first motor car was made in Coventry in 1897, by the Daimler Company. Before long Coventry became established as one of the major centres of the British motor industry. In the early-to-mid 20th century, a number of famous names in the British motor industry became established in Coventry, including Alvis, Armstrong Siddeley, Daimler, Humber, Jaguar, Riley, Rootes, Rover, Singer, Standard, Swift and Triumph. Thanks to the growth of the car industry attracting workers, Coventry's population doubled between 1901 and 1911.\nFor most of the early-20th century, Coventry's economy boomed; in the 1930s, a decade otherwise known for its economic slump, Coventry was noted for its affluence. In 1937 Coventry topped a national purchasing power index, designed to calculate the purchasing power of the public.\nGreat War (1914\u20131918).\nMany Coventry factories switched production to military vehicles, armaments and ammunitions during the Great War. Approximately 35,000 men from Coventry and Warwickshire served during the First World War, so most of the skilled factory workers were women drafted from all over the country. Due to the importance of war production in Coventry it was a target for German zeppelin attacks and defensive anti-aircraft guns were established at Keresley and Wyken Grange to protect the city.\nIn June 1921, the War Memorial Park was opened on the former Styvechale Common to commemorate the 2587 soldiers from the city who lost their lives in the war. The War Memorial was designed by Thomas Francis Tickner and is a Grade II* building. It was unveiled by Earl Haig in 1927, with a room called the Chamber of Silence inside the monument holding the roll of honour. Soldiers who lost their lives in recent conflicts have been added to the roll of honour over the years.\nUrban expansion and development.\nWith many of the city's older properties becoming increasingly unfit for habitation, the first council houses were let to their tenants in 1917. With Coventry's industrial base continuing to soar after the end of the Great War in 1918, numerous private and council housing developments took place across the city in the 1920s and 1930s to provide housing for the large influx of workers who came to work in the city's booming factories. The areas which were expanded or created in this development included Radford, Coundon, Canley, Cheylesmore and Stoke Heath. \nAs the population grew, the city boundaries underwent several expansions, in 1890, 1928, 1931 and 1965, and between 1931 and 1940 the city grew by 36%.\nThe development of a southern by-pass around the city, starting in the 1930s and being completed in 1940, helped deliver more urban areas to the city on previously rural land. In the 1910s plans were created to redevelop Coventry's narrow streets and by the 1930s the plans were put into action with Coventry's medieval street of Butcher Row being demolished. even before the war, the plans had been put in place to destroy the medieval character of Coventry.\nThe London Road Cemetery was designed by Joseph Paxton on the site of a former quarry to meet the needs of the city.\nGerman bombing of Coventry.\nCoventry suffered severe bomb damage during the Second World War. The most severe was a massive Luftwaffe air raid that the Germans called Operation Moonlight Sonata. The raid, which involved more than 500 aircraft, started at 7pm on 14 November 1940 and carried on for 11 hours into the morning of 15 November. The raid led to severe damage to large areas of the city centre and to Coventry's historic cathedral, leaving only a shell and the spire. More than 4,000 houses were damaged or destroyed, along with around three quarters of the city's industrial plants. Between 380 and 554 people were killed, with thousands injured and homeless.\nAside from London, Hull and Plymouth, Coventry suffered more damage than any other British city during the Luftwaffe attacks, with huge firestorms devastating most of the city centre. The city was probably targeted owing to its high concentration of armaments, munitions, aircraft and aero-engine plants which contributed greatly to the British war effort, although there have been claims that Hitler launched the attack as revenge for the bombing of Munich by the RAF six days before the Coventry Blitz and chose the Midlands city because its medieval heart was regarded as one of the finest in Britain. Following the raids, the majority of Coventry's historic buildings were demolished by a council who saw no need of them in a modern city, although some of them could have been repaired and some of those demolished were unaffected by the bombing.\nPost-Second World War.\nRedevelopment.\nIn the post-war years Coventry was largely rebuilt under the general direction of the Gibson Plan, gaining a new pedestrianised shopping precinct (the first of its kind in Europe on such a scale) and in 1962 Sir Basil Spence's much-celebrated new St Michael's Cathedral (incorporating one of the world's largest tapestries) was consecrated. Its prefabricated steel spire (fl\u00e8che) was lowered into place by helicopter.\nFurther housing developments in the private and public sector took place after the Second World War, partly to accommodate the growing population of the city and also to replace condemned and bomb damaged properties. Several new suburbs were constructed in the post-war period, including Tile Hill, Wood End, and Stoke Aldermoor.\nBoom and bust.\nCoventry's motor industry boomed during the 1950s and 1960s and Coventry enjoyed a 'golden age'. In 1960 over 81,000 people were employed in the production of motor vehicles, tractors and aircraft in Coventry. During this period the disposable income of Coventrians was amongst the highest in the country and both the sports and the arts benefited. A new sports centre, with one of the few Olympic standard swimming pools in the UK, was constructed and Coventry City Football Club reached the First Division of English Football. The Belgrade Theatre (named in recognition of a gift of timber from the Yugoslavian capital city) was also constructed along with the Herbert Art Gallery. Coventry's pedestrianised Precinct shopping area came into its own and was considered one of the finest retail experiences outside London. In 1965 the new University of Warwick campus was opened to students, and rapidly became one of the country's leading higher-education institutions.\nCoventry's large industrial base made it attractive to the wave of Asian and Caribbean immigrants who arrived from Commonwealth colonies after 1948. In 1950, one of Britain's first mosques\u2014and the very first in Coventry\u2014was opened on Eagle Street to serve the city's growing Pakistani community.\nThe 1970s, however, saw a decline in the British motor industry and Coventry suffered particularly badly, especially towards the end of that decade. By the 1970s, most of Coventry's motor companies had been absorbed and rationalised into larger companies, such as British Leyland and Chrysler which subsequently collapsed. The early 1980s recession dealt Coventry a particularly severe blow: By 1981, Coventry was in an economic crisis, with one in six of its residents unemployed. By 1982, the number of British Leyland employees in the city had fallen from 27,000 at its height, to just 8,000. Other Coventry industrial giants such as the tool manufacturer Alfred Herbert also collapsed during this time.\nIn the late-1970s and early-1980s, Coventry also became the centre of the Two-tone musical phenomena. The two-tone style was multi-racial, derived from the traditional Jamaican music genres of ska, reggae and rocksteady combined with elements of punk rock and new wave. Bands considered part of the genre include the Specials, the Selecter, Madness, the Beat, Bad Manners, the Bodysnatchers and Akrylykz. Most famously the Specials 1981 UK no.1 hit 'Ghost Town' reflected the unemployment and desolation of Coventry at the time.\n21st century.\nSome motor manufacturing continued into the early 21st century: One of the research and design centres of Jaguar Land Rover is in the city at their Whitley plant and although vehicle assembly ceased at the Browns Lane plant in 2004, the head office of the Jaguar brand returned to the city in 2011, and is also sited in Whitley. The closure of the Peugeot factory at Ryton-on-Dunsmore in 2006, ended volume car manufacture in Coventry. By 2008, only one motor manufacturing plant was operational, that of LTI Ltd, producing the popular TX4 taxi cabs. On 17 March 2010 LTI announced they would no longer be producing bodies and chassis in Coventry, instead producing them in China and shipping them in for final assembly in Coventry.\nSince the 1980s, Coventry has recovered, with its economy diversifying into services, with engineering ceasing to be a mass employer, what remains of manufacturing in the city is driven by smaller more specialist firms. By the 2010s the biggest drivers of Coventry's economy had become its two large universities; the University of Warwick and Coventry University, which between them, had 60,000 students, and a combined annual budget of around \u00a31 billion.\nIn 2021 Coventry became the UK City of Culture. A range of artistic and local history events and projects took place over the next year, including \"Coventrypedia\" and the creation of the Coventry Atlas local history map.\nGeography.\nClimate.\nAs with the rest of the British Isles and the Midlands, Coventry experiences a maritime climate with cool summers and mild winters. The nearest Met Office weather station is Coundon/Coventry Bablake. Temperature extremes recorded in Coventry range from in February 1947, to in July 2022. The lowest temperature reading of recent years was during December 2010.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCity boundaries.\nCoventry forms the largest part of the Coventry and Bedworth Urban Area. The city proper covers an area of almost .\nThe protected West Midlands Green Belt, which surrounds the city on all sides, has prevented the expansion of the city into both the administrative county of Warwickshire and the metropolitan borough of Solihull (the Meriden Gap), and has helped to prevent the coalescence of the city with surrounding towns such as Kenilworth, Nuneaton, Leamington Spa, Warwick and Rugby as well as the large village of Balsall Common.\nPanoramic views of Coventry City Centre from the cathedral tower\nSuburbs and other surrounding areas.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPlaces of interest.\nCathedral.\nThe spire of the ruined cathedral forms one of the \"three spires\" which have dominated the city skyline since the 14th\u00a0century, the others being those of Christ Church (of which only the spire survives) and Holy Trinity Church (which is still in use).\nSt Michael's Cathedral is Coventry's best-known landmark and visitor attraction. The 14th\u00a0century church was largely destroyed by German bombing during the Second World War, leaving only the outer walls and spire. At high, the spire of St Michael's is claimed to be the third tallest cathedral spire in England, after Salisbury and Norwich. Due to the architectural design (in 1940 the tower had no internal wooden floors and a stone vault below the belfry) it survived the destruction of the rest of the cathedral. \nThe new Coventry Cathedral was opened in 1962 next to the ruins of the old. It was designed by Sir Basil Spence. The cathedral contains the tapestry \"Christ in Glory in the Tetramorph\" by Graham Sutherland. The bronze statue \"St Michael's Victory over the Devil\" by Jacob Epstein is mounted on the exterior of the new cathedral near the entrance. Benjamin Britten's \"War Requiem\", regarded by some as his masterpiece, was written for the opening of the new cathedral. The cathedral was featured in the 2009 film \"Nativity!\".\nCoventry Cathedral is also notable for being one of the newest cathedrals in the world, having been built following the Second World War bombing of the ancient cathedral by the Luftwaffe. Coventry has since developed an international reputation as one of Europe's major cities of peace and reconciliation, centred on its cathedral, and holds an annual Peace Month. John Lennon and Yoko Ono planted two acorns outside the cathedral in June 1968 to thank the city for making friends with others.\nCoventry also has a Baptist church named Queens Road Baptist Church, which was first established in 1723 and moved to its current building in 1884.\nCultural institutions.\nThe Herbert Art Gallery and Museum is one of the largest cultural institutions in Coventry. Another visitor attraction in the city centre is Coventry Transport Museum, which has the largest public collection of British-made road vehicles in the world. The most notable exhibits are the world speed record-breaking cars, Thrust2 and ThrustSSC The museum received a refurbishment in 2004 which included the creation of a new entrance as part of the city's Phoenix Initiative project. It was a finalist for the 2005 Gulbenkian Prize. \nHistoric Coventry Trust (previously known as The Charterhouse Coventry Preservation Trust) was founded in 2011. The Trust is a social enterprise aiming to regenerate Coventry's historic buildings and landscapes. Their sites across Coventry include the Charterhouse, the two surviving City Gates, Drapers' Hall, London Road Cemetery: Paxton's Arboretum and Priory Row.\nThe \u00a35 million Fargo Village creative quarter shopping precinct was open in 2014 on Far Gosford Street with a mixture of retail units.\nAbout from the city centre and just outside Coventry in Baginton is the Lunt Fort, a reconstructed Roman fort on its original site. The Midland Air Museum is situated just within the perimeter of Coventry on land adjacent to Coventry Airport and near Baginton.\nCoventry was one of the main centres of watchmaking during the 18th and 19th\u00a0centuries and as the industry declined, the skilled workers were key to setting up the cycle trade. A group of local enthusiasts founded the Coventry Watch Museum in Spon Street.\nThe city's main police station in Little Park Street also hosts a museum of Coventry's police force. The museum, based underground, is split into two sections\u2014one representing the history of the city's police force, and the other compiling some of the more unusual, interesting and grisly cases from the force's history. The museum is funded from charity donations\u2014viewings can be made by appointment.\nCoventry City Farm was a small farm in an urban setting. It was mainly to educate city children who might not get out to the countryside very often. The farm closed in 2008 due to funding problems.\nDemographics.\nCoventry has an ethnic minority population which represented 34.5% of the population at the 2021 census. The ethnic minority population is concentrated in the Foleshill and the St Michael's wards. Islam is the largest non-Christian religion, but the composition of the ethnic minority population is not typical of the UK with significant numbers of other South Asians. Both Sikh and Hindu religions are represented significantly higher than in the rest of the West Midlands in general.\nCoventry has a large student population (approximately 15,000 are non-UK) who are in the UK for 12 months or longer that are included in these figures.\nAccording to the 2021 Census, 43.9% (151,577) of residents identified themselves as Christian making Christianity the largest followed religion in the city. Islam was the second most followed religion with 10.4% (35,800) of residents identifying with the religion. 5.0% (17,297) of Coventry's population were Sikh, disproportionately larger than the national average in England of 0.8%. Hindus made up 4.0% (13,724) of the resident population followed by Buddhists at 0.4% (1,257) and Jews at 0.1% (259) respectively. The adherents of other religions made up 0.6% (1,908) of the city's population.\nAlmost a third of Coventry residents, 29.6% (102,338), identified themselves as having no religion and 6.1% did not declare any religion.\nGovernment and politics.\nLocal and national government.\nTraditionally a part of Warwickshire (although it was a county in its own right for 400 years), Coventry became an independent county borough in 1889. It later became a metropolitan district of the West Midlands county under the Local Government Act 1974 (c. 7), even though it was entirely separate to the Birmingham conurbation area (this is why Coventry appears to unnaturally \"jut out\" into Warwickshire on political maps of the UK). In 1986, the West Midlands County Council was abolished and Coventry became administered as an effective unitary authority in its own right.\nCoventry is administered by Coventry City Council, controlled since 2010 by the Labour Party, and led since May 2016 by George Duggins. The city is divided up into 18 Wards each with three councillors. The chairman of the council is the Lord Mayor, who has a casting vote.\nCertain local services are provided by West Midlands wide agencies including the West Midlands Police, the West Midlands Fire Service and Transport for West Midlands (Centro) which is responsible for public transport.\nIn 2006, Coventry and Warwickshire Ambulance Service was merged with the West Midlands Ambulance Service. The Warwickshire and Northamptonshire Air Ambulance service is based at Coventry Airport in Baginton.\nCoventry is represented in Parliament by three Members of Parliament (MPs). They are:\nUp until 1997, Coventry was represented by four Members of Parliament, whereupon the Coventry South West and Coventry South East constituencies were merged to form Coventry South.\nOn Tuesday, 10 September 2024, Zarah Sultana, the Member of Parliament for Coventry South, was suspended from the Labour Party for voting in favour of a Scottish National Party amendment to end the two child benefit cap.\nOn Thursday, 19 May 2016, Councillor Lindsley Harvard was inaugurated Lord Mayor of Coventry for 2016\u201317 as Coventry's 65th Lord Mayor. Councillor Lindsley Harvard has been a Labour Councillor serving on the council for fourteen years, for Earlsdon Ward (1996\u20132000) and for Longford Ward since 2006. On Thursday, 19 May 2016, Councillor Tony Skipper was inaugurated as the Deputy Lord Mayor of Coventry for 2016\u201317. He has been a Labour councillor since 1995; representing Earlsdon Ward between 1995 and 2001, and then Radford Ward since 2001.\nThe Bishop of Coventry is Christopher John Cocksworth, who was consecrated on 3 July 2008.\nCouncil affiliation.\nIn May 2016, it was as follows\nTwinning with other cities; \"city of peace and reconciliation\".\nCoventry and Stalingrad (now Volgograd) were the world's first 'twin' cities when they established a twinning relationship during the Second World War. The relationship developed through ordinary people in Coventry who wanted to show their support for the Soviet Red Army during the Battle of Stalingrad. The city was also subsequently twinned with Dresden, as a gesture of peace and reconciliation following the Second World War. Each twin city country is represented in a specific ward of the city and in each ward has a peace garden dedicated to that twin city. Coventry is now twinned with 26 places across the world: On 22 March 2022, Coventry City Council voted unanimously to suspend the twinning arrangement with Volgograd in light of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nArts and culture.\nOn 7 December 2017 it was announced that the city would be the 2021 UK City of Culture, being the third such place to hold the title after Derry in 2013 and Hull in 2017. After the financial collapse of the Coventry City of Culture Trust, set up to run legacy projects following Coventry's year as UK City of Culture in 2021, local MP Taiwo Owatemi raised an adjournment debate in the House of Commons.\nMusic and cinema.\nDuring the late-1970s and early 1980s, Coventry was the centre of the Two Tone musical phenomenon, with bands such as The Specials and The Selecter coming from the city. The Specials achieved two UK number 1 hit singles between 1979 and 1981, namely \"Too Much Too Young\" and \"Ghost Town\".\nCoventry has a range of music events including an international jazz programme, the Coventry Jazz Festival, and the Godiva Festival. On the Saturday of the Godiva Festival, a carnival parade starts in the city centre and makes its way to War Memorial Park where the festival is held. Coventry's music is celebrated at The Coventry Music Museum, part of the 2-Tone Village complex.\nIn the 1969 film \"The Italian Job\", the famous scene of Mini Coopers being driven at speed through Turin's sewers was actually filmed in Coventry, using what were then the country's biggest sewer pipes, that were accessible because they were being installed. The BBC medical TV drama series \"Angels,\" which ran from 1975 to 1983 was filmed at Walsgrave Hospital.\nMore recently various locations in Coventry have been used in the BAFTA nominated film \"The Bouncer\" starring Ray Winstone, \"All in the Game\", also starring Ray Winstone (Ricoh Arena), the BBC sitcom \"Keeping Up Appearances\" (Stoke Aldermoor and Binley Woods districts). In August 2006 scenes from \"The Shakespeare Code\", an episode of the third series of \"Doctor Who\", were filmed in the grounds of Ford's Hospital. The 2013 ITV comedy-drama \"Love and Marriage\" was also set in the city. Coventry is home to three major feature films the Nativity! franchise which are all shot and set in the city. These Christmas films have all reached top box office spots on their release in UK cinemas. Their writer and director the Bafta award-winning Debbie Isitt is resident in the city. In 2023, the 10 part TV series \"Phoenix Rise\" was set and filmed in Coventry.\nBBC Radio 1 has announced that its BBC Radio One's Big Weekend will take place in Coventry at the end of May 2022, as part of the closing ceremony for the UK City of Culture.\nCustoms and traditions.\nCoventry Godcakes are a regional delicacy, originating from the 14th\u00a0century and are still baked today.\nThe Coventry Flag.\nThe Coventry Flag, designed by Simon Wyatt, was adopted through a popular vote on 7 December 2018. The Coventry Flag represents the unique identity of the Warwickshire city and its residents. It emerged as the winner in a competition organised by BBC Coventry &amp; Warwickshire and proudly flew during Coventry's tenure as the UK City of Culture in 2021. The design features Lady Godiva, a local heroine, depicted in black on a white pale, symbolising Coventry's history, principles, and its reputation as a city of peace. Sky blue panels on either side of Lady Godiva represent \"Coventry Blue,\" reminiscent of the historic local textile industry and Coventry City Football Club, known as the \"Sky Blues.\"\nVenues and shopping.\nThere are several theatre, art and music venues in Coventry attracting popular sporting events and singing musicians. Along with this, the city has several retail parks located out of the city centre and its own shopping mall in the heart of the city:\n Coventry Building Society Arena: located north of the city centre, the 32,600 capacity sports stadium which is home to the city's only professional football team Coventry City, who play in the second tier of English football, and is also used to hold major concerts for some of the world's biggest acts, including Oasis, Bon Jovi, Coldplay, Lady Gaga, Rod Stewart, Kings of Leon and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. It was also one of the venues chosen for the footballing events at the 2012 Olympic Games. The adjacent Jaguar Exhibition Hall is a 6,000-seat events venue for hosting a multitude of other acts.\nSport.\nOn the sporting scene, Coventry Rugby Football Club was consistently among the nation's leading rugby football sides from the early 20th\u00a0century, peaking in the 1970s and 1980s. Association football, on the other hand, was scarcely a claim to fame until 1967, when Coventry City F.C. finally won promotion to the top flight of English football as champions of the Football League Second Division. They would stay among the elite for the next 34 years, reaching their pinnacle with FA Cup glory in 1987\u2014the first and to date only major trophy in the club's history. Their long stay in the top flight of English football ended in relegation in 2001, and in 2012 they were relegated again to the third tier of English football. Highfield Road, to the east of the city centre, was Coventry City's home for 106 years from 1899. They finally departed from the stadium in 2005 on their relocation to the 32,600-seat Ricoh Arena some to the north of the city centre, in the Rowleys Green district. Since 2000, the city has also been home to one of the most successful ice hockey teams in the country, the Coventry Blaze who are four time Elite League champions, and play their home games at the SkyDome Arena.\nFootball.\nThere are two professional football teams representing the city: Coventry City F.C. of the EFL Championship in men's football and Coventry United L.F.C. of the FA Women's Championship in women's football.\nCoventry City F.C., formed in 1883 as \"Singers F.C.\". Nicknamed the \"Sky Blues\", the club competes in the EFL Championship (second tier of English football), but spent 34 years from 1967 to 2001 in the top tier of English football, winning the FA Cup in 1987. They were founder members of the Premier League in 1992. In 2005, Coventry City moved to the 32,600 capacity Ricoh Arena which opened in the Rowleys Green district of the city. The 2013\u201314 season saw the football club begin a ground share with Northampton Town F.C. at Sixfields Stadium, Northampton, which lasted until their return to the Ricoh Arena in September 2014. The 2019\u201320 season saw the Sky Blues once again playing their home fixtures out of Coventry, at Birmingham City's St Andrew's Stadium. This arrangement continued until August 2021, when Coventry moved back to the newly renamed Coventry Building Society Arena.\nCoventry United L.F.C. play at the Butts Park Arena and were originally Coventry City Ladies before the Sky Blues discontinued their women's team, at which point they affiliated with Coventry United, and rose through the divisions to their current position in the second-tier of the women's game.\nAside from these clubs, there are several other clubs in the city playing non-league football. Coventry Sphinx, Coventry Alvis, Coventry Copsewood and Coventry United all play in the Midland Football League.\nBoth Coventry University and the University of Warwick compete in the British Universities and Colleges Sport (BUCS) football competitions. For the 2014\u201315 season, the Coventry University men's 1st team compete in BUCS Midlands 1a, while the University of Warwick men's 1st team competes in BUCS Midlands 2a. Both institutions' women's 1st teams both play in BUCS Midlands 2a.\nRugby Union.\nAt the beginning of the 2014\u201315 season, there were 14 clubs based in Coventry, playing at various levels of the English rugby union system. However, on 21 December 2014, this rose to 15, when Aviva Premiership club Wasps RFC played their first home game at the Ricoh Arena, completing their relocation to the city. This followed Wasps' purchase of Arena Coventry Limited (the company which runs the Ricoh Arena). The club announced that they will build a new 'state of the art' training complex in the area by 2016.\nWasps' stay in the City ended in 2022 after the club collapsed into administration and were forced to relinquish their ownership of the arena. As it stands, Wasps currently have no plans to play in Coventry again.\nCoventry Rugby Football Club play in the RFU Championship, the second tier of the English rugby union system. The club enjoyed national success during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, with many of its players playing for their countries, notable players include Ivor Preece, Peter Jackson, David Duckham, Fran Cotton and Danny Grewcock. From 1921 to 2004, the club played at Coundon Road Stadium. Their current home ground is the Butts Park Arena, which was opened in 2004.\nBroadstreet R.F.C. are the only other club to play in a 'national league' currently playing in National Division 2 North.\nThere are a further 12 clubs playing in the Midland divisions of the English Rugby Union system.

Originally known as Coventry Bears, the Hurricanes compete in the Betfred League 1, as a semi-professional team in the third tier of the game. They play their home matches at the Butts Park Arena.\nIn 2002, the club won the Rugby League Conference, and took the step up to the national leagues. In 2004, they won the National Division 3 title and have appeared in the Challenge Cup. In 2015 the Bears entered their reserve team into the Conference League South league, a level below the first team under the name Coventry Bears Reserves playing home games at the Xcel Leisure Centre.\nBoth Coventry University and the University of Warwick compete in the British Universities and Colleges Sport (BUCS) Midlands 1a competition.\nSpeedway.\nCoventry Speedway was based at Brandon Stadium (also known as Coventry Stadium). The stadium is located just outside the city in the village of Brandon, Warwickshire ( to the east of the city). The stadium operated both sides of the Second World War. Before the Second World War speedway also operated for a short time at Foleshill Stadium, off Lythalls Lane in the city. Between 1998 and 2000, Coventry Stadium hosted the Speedway Grand Prix of Great Britain.\nThe Coventry Bees started in 1948 and operated continuously until the end of the 2018 season. They started out in the National League Division Three before moving up to the Second Division and, later to the top flight. The Bees were crowned League Champions on nine occasions (1953, 1968, 1978, 1979, 1987, 1988, 2005, 2007 and 2010).\nAmongst the top speedway riders who represented Coventry teams were Tom Farndon, Jack Parker, Arthur Forrest, Nigel Boocock, Kelvin Tatum, Chris Harris, Scott Nicholls, Emil Sayfutdinov and World Champions Ole Olsen, Hans Nielsen, Greg Hancock, Billy Hamill, Ronnie Moore and Jack Young.\nIn 2007, the Bees won the domestic speedway treble of Elite League, Knock-out Cup and Craven Shield, while Chris Harris won both the Speedway Grand Prix of Great Britain and the British Championship.

As with speedway, Stock Car racing ceased in 2017 because of the unavailability of the stadium.\nCricket.\nThe city's current leading cricket club is Coventry and North Warwickshire Cricket Club. Coventry &amp; North Warwickshire CC is currently competing in the ECB Birmingham &amp; District Premier Cricket League, having won the Warwickshire Premier Division in 2022, achieving promotion through the county league play-offs against the respective winners of the Worcestershire, Staffordshire and Shropshire premier leagues.\nHistorically, first class county games were played by Warwickshire County Cricket Club at the Courtaulds Ground from 1949 up to 1982.

In this industry it competed locally with Norwich and Leicester and internationally with Saint-\u00c9tienne in France.\nCoventry has been a centre of motor and cycle manufacturing. Starting with Coventry Motette, The Great Horseless Carriage Company, Swift Motor Company, Humber, Hillman, Riley, Francis-Barnett and Daimler and Triumph motorcycles having its origins in 1902 in a Coventry factory. The Massey Ferguson tractor factory was situated on Banner Lane, Tile Hill, until it closed in the early 2000s.\nAlthough the motor industry has declined almost to the point of extinction, Jaguar Land Rover has retained its Jaguar brand headquarters in the city (at Whitley) and an Advanced R&amp;D team at the University of Warwick, while Peugeot still have a large parts centre in Humber Road despite the closure of its Ryton factory (formerly owned by the Rootes Group) just outside the city in December 2006 with the loss of more than 2,000 jobs \u2013 denting the economy of Coventry shortly before the onset of a recession which sparked further economic decline and high unemployment.\nThe Standard Motor Company opened a car factory at Canley in the south of the city in 1918, occupying a former munitions factory. This site was later expanded and produced Triumph cars after the Standard brand was phased out by BMC during the 1960s. In August 1980, however, it was closed down as part of British Leyland's rationalisation process, although the Triumph brand survived for another four years on cars produced at other British Leyland factories. The closure of the Triumph car factory was perhaps the largest blow to Coventry's economy during the early 1980s economic decline.\nThe famous London black cab taxis are produced by Coventry-based LEVC (formerly LTI); until its 2017 relocation from the historic Holyhead Road factory to a new plant at Ansty Park a few miles outside the city, these were the only remaining motor vehicles wholly built in Coventry.\nThe manufacture of machine tools was once a major industry in Coventry. Alfred Herbert Ltd became one of the largest machine tool companies in the world. In later years the company faced competition from foreign machine tool builders and ceased trading in 1983. Other Coventry machine tool manufacturers included A.C. Wickman, and Webster &amp; Bennett. The last Coventry machine tool manufacturer was Matrix Churchill which was forced to close in the wake of the Iraqi Supergun (Project Babylon) scandal.\nCoventry's main industries include: cars, electronic equipment, machine tools, agricultural machinery, man-made fibres, aerospace components and telecommunications equipment. In recent years, the city has moved away from manufacturing industries towards business services, finance, research, design and development and creative industries.\nRedevelopment.\nMajor improvements continue to regenerate the city centre. The Phoenix Initiative, which was designed by MJP Architects, reached the final shortlist for the 2004 RIBA Stirling Prize and has now won a total of 16 separate awards. It was published in the book 'Phoenix : Architecture/Art/Regeneration' in 2004. Further major developments are potentially afoot, particularly the Swanswell Project, which is intended to deepen Swanswell Pool and link it to Coventry Canal Basin, coupled with the creation of an urban marina and a wide Parisian-style boulevard. A possible second phase of the Phoenix Initiative is also in the offing, although both of these plans are still on the drawing-board. On 16 December 2007, IKEA's first city centre store in the UK was opened, in Coventry.\nOn 4 February 2020, it was announced that IKEA's Coventry city centre store was to close the same year due to changing shopping habits and consistent losses at the store.\nThe River Sherbourne runs under Coventry's city centre; the river was paved over during the rebuilding after the Second World War and is not commonly known. When the new rebuild of Coventry city centre takes place from 2017 onwards, it is planned that river will be re-opened, and a river walk way will be placed alongside it in parts of the city centre. In April 2012, the pedestrianisation of Broadgate was completed.\nMedia.\nRadio.\nLocal radio stations include:\nWritten media.\nThe main local newspapers are:\nTelevision news.\nThe city is covered on regional TV News by:\nPublic services.\nEmergency services.\nCoventry is covered by West Midlands Police, the West Midlands Fire Service and the West Midlands Ambulance Service.\nHealthcare.\nHealthcare in Coventry is provided primarily by the National Health Service (NHS); the principal NHS hospital covering the city is the University Hospital Coventry, which was opened in 2006 as a 1,250 bed 'super hospital', funded by a private finance initiative (PFI) scheme.\nElectricity.\nElectricity was first supplied to Coventry in 1895 from Coventry power station off Sandy Lane adjacent to the canal (now Electric Wharf). A larger 130\u00a0MW power station was built at Longford in 1928, this operated until 1976, and was subsequently demolished.\nWaste management.\nCoventry has an energy from waste incinerator which burns rubbish from both Coventry and Solihull, producing electricity for the National Grid and some hot water that is used locally through the Heatline project. Rubbish is still put into landfill.\nIn October 2006, Coventry City Council signed the Nottingham Declaration, joining 130 other UK councils in committing to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of the council and to help the local community do the same.\nTransport.\nRoads.\nCoventry is near to the M1, M6, M40, M45 and M69 motorways. The M45, which is situated a few miles to the south-east of the city, was opened in 1959 as a spur to the original section of the M1 motorway, which linked London with the Midlands. This was, in effect, the first motorway to serve Coventry, as the section of the M6 north of the city did not open until 1971 and the M69 between Coventry and Leicester opened five years later. The M40, which is connected to the city via the A46, is south of the city centre, south of Warwick and gives the city's residents an alternative dual carriageway and motorway route to London.\nIt is served by the A45 and A46 dual carriageways. The A45 originally passed through the centre of the city, but was re-routed in the 1930s on the completion of the Coventry Southern Bypass, with westbound traffic heading in the direction of Birmingham and eastbound traffic in the direction of Northampton. The A46 was re-routed to the east of the city in 1989 on completion of the Coventry Eastern Bypass, which directly leads to the M6/M69 interchange. To the south, it gives a direct link to the M40, making use of the existing Warwick and Kenilworth bypasses.\nCoventry has a dual-carriageway Ring Road (officially road number A4053) that is 2.25 miles long. It loops around the city centre and roughly follows the lines of the old city walls. The Ring Road began construction in the late 1950s, the first stretch was opened in 1962, and it was finally completed in 1974. Ring Road junctions have all been numbered since the 1980s. The road has a reputation for being difficult to navigate. A single street of Victorian terraces, Starley Road, remains inside the ring road after a campaign by residents prevented its demolition in the 1980s.\nPhoenix Way, a dual-carriageway running north\u2013south completed in 1995, links the city centre with the M6 motorway.\nRailway.\nCoventry railway station is a principal stop on the West Coast Main Line; it is served by three train operating companies:\nCoventry has also three suburban railway stations at Coventry Arena, Canley and Tile Hill. Coventry Arena, serving the north of city on the Coventry to Nuneaton Line, opened in January 2016 primarily for the Ricoh Arena where football, rugby matches and concerts take place.\nLight rail.\nA light rail system is planned for Coventry, known as \"Coventry Very Light Rail\". The first vehicle came off the production line in March 2021 and the first line, to University Hospital Coventry, was proposed to be operational by 2024.\nBuses.\nBus operators in Coventry include National Express Coventry, Arriva Midlands and Stagecoach in Warwickshire. Pool Meadow bus station is the main bus and coach interchange in the city centre. Coventry has a single Park and Ride service from War Memorial Park served by Stagecoach in Warwickshire. From Pool Meadow, there are national coach links to major towns and cities, seaside towns, ferry ports and events with National Express, with four stands (A, B, C and D).\nCoventry aims to have all of its buses powered by electricity by 2025.\nAir.\nThe nearest major airport is Birmingham Airport, some to the west of the city. Coventry Airport, located south of the city centre in Baginton, is now used for general aviation only.\nWater.\nThe Coventry Canal terminates near the city centre at Coventry Canal Basin and is navigable for to Fradley Junction in Staffordshire. The canal engineer James Brindley was responsible for the initial planning of the canal. The Coventry Canal Society was formed in 1957.\nAccent.\nOrigins.\nCoventry in a linguistic sense looks both ways, towards both the 'West' and 'East' Midlands. One thousand years ago, the extreme west of Warwickshire (what today we would designate Birmingham and the Black Country) was separated from Coventry and east Warwickshire by the forest of Arden, with resulting inferior means of communication. The west Warwickshire settlements too were smaller in comparison to Coventry which, by the 14th\u00a0century, was England's third city. Even as far back as Anglo-Saxon times Coventry\u2014situated as it was, close to Watling Street\u2014was a trading and market post between King Alfred's Saxon Mercia and Danelaw England with a consequent merging of dialects.\nCoventry and Birmingham accents.\nPhonetically the accent of Coventry, like the perhaps better known accent of Birmingham, is similar to Northern English with respect to its system of short vowels. For example, it lacks the BATH/TRAP (Cov. /ba\u03b8/, Southern /b\u0251\u02d0\u03b8/) and FOOT/STRUT (Cov. /str\u028at/, Southern /str\u028ct/) splits. Yet the longer vowels in the accent also contain traces of Estuary English such as a partial implementation of the London diphthong shift, increasingly so amongst the young since 1950. We also see other Estuary English features, such as a /l/-vocalisation whereby words such as 'milk' come to be pronounced as /m\u026a\u028ak/. However, the distinction between Coventry and Birmingham accents is often overlooked. Certain features of the Birmingham accent (e.g. occasional tapping of prevocalic /r/ in words such as 'crack') stop starkly as one moves beyond Solihull in the general direction of Coventry, a possible approximation of the 'Arden Forest' divide perhaps. In any case, Coventry sits right at a dialectal crossroads, very close to isoglosses that generally delineate 'Northern' and 'Southern' dialects, exhibiting features from both sides of the divide.\nCoventry accent on television.\nThe BBC's 2009 documentary \"The Bombing of Coventry\" contained interviews with Coventrians. Actress Becci Gemmell, played Coventry character Joyce in the BBC drama \"Land Girls\".\nHonours.\nA minor planet, 3009 Coventry, discovered by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Stepanovich Chernykh in 1973, is named after the city.\nEducation.\nUniversities and further education colleges.\nCoventry has two universities; Coventry University is situated on a modern city centre campus while the University of Warwick lies to the south of the city centre. The University of Warwick is one of only five universities never to have been rated outside the top ten in terms of teaching excellence and research and is a member of the prestigious Russell Group. The university won the BBC TV \"University Challenge\" trophy in April 2007 and April 2021. Coventry University is one of only a handful of universities to run a degree course in automotive design, which is in its Coventry School of Art and Design.\nCoventry also has two further education colleges within city boundaries, Coventry College and Hereward College.\nSchools.\nMany of the secondary schools in and around Coventry are specialist colleges, such as Finham Park School, which is a mathematics and IT college, a teacher training school and the only school in Coventry to offer studying the International Baccalaureate, and Coventry Blue Coat Church of England School which has recently become a specialist college of music, one of only a few in the country. Cardinal Wiseman Catholic School specialises in languages. Bishop Ullathorne RC School became a specialist college in humanities in 2006. Ernesford Grange Community Academy, in the south east, is a specialist science college. Coundon Court School is a Technology College. Pattison College, a private school opened in 1949, specialises in the performing arts. Caludon Castle School is a business and enterprise school, which was rebuilt over 2005\u201307. Exhall Grange School and Science College is in the north of the city, although, its catchment area is north Warwickshire. There is also Cardinal Newman Catholic School and Community College and Whitley Academy in the city.\nCoventry has a variety of schools: Two of the oldest secondary schools being President Kennedy School founded in 1966 and located in the north-west of Coventry (currently undergoing rebuilding work) and Sidney Stringer Academy which is located in the centre of the city. It is a co-educational school and has moved into a larger building costing \u00a328 million.\nThe Coventry School Foundation comprises the independent schools King Henry VIII School and Bablake School together with King Henry VIII Preparatory School.\nThe Woodlands Academy and Tile Hill Wood School were the last remaining single sex schools in the city, serving boys and girls respectively. These schools merged onto the Tile Hill Wood site in 2016 before officially being rebranded as West Coventry Academy in 2017. Both Woodlands and Tile Hill shared a joint sixth form along with The Westwood Academy called West Coventry Sixth Form, but in 2018 Westwood left the sixth form and it now operates under the name West Coventry Academy Sixth Form.\nThe Westwood Academy, which is a Technology College, is close to the University of Warwick. It is the only school in Coventry that is a CISCO Academy and has links with other educational establishments, industry and the local community.\nSherbourne Fields School is a school for young people with disabilities and is located in the Coundon area. It opened in the 1960s.\nNotable people associated with Coventry.\nHistory and politics.\nCoventry is well known for the mythical 11th century exploits of Lady Godiva who, according to legend, rode through the city naked on horseback in protest at high taxes being levied on the city folk by her husband Leofric, Earl of Mercia. Contemporary historians do not dispute that lady Godiva was a real figure, as she was the first woman to be mentioned in the \"Domesday Book\" (1086), however her ride is considered mythical. The residents of the city were commanded to look away as she rode, but one man did not and was allegedly struck blind. He became known as Peeping Tom thus originating a new idiom, or metonym, in English. There is a Grade II* listed statue of her in the city centre, which for 18 years had been underneath a Cathedral Lanes shopping centre canopy, removed in October 2008.

{"id": "44767", "revid": "3138265", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44767", "title": "Alcamo", "text": "Comune in Sicily , Italy\nAlcamo (; ) is the fourth-largest town and commune of the Province of Trapani, Sicily, with a population of 44.925 inhabitants. It is on the borderline with the Metropolitan City of Palermo at a distance of about 50 kilometres from Palermo and Trapani.\nNowadays the town territory includes an area of 130,79 square kilometres and is the second municipality as for population density in the province of Trapani, after Erice.\nAlcamo is bounded by the Tyrrhenian Sea on the north, Balestrate and Partinico on the east, Camporeale on the south and Calatafimi-Segesta and Castellammare del Golfo on the west. Its most important hamlet is Alcamo Marina at about 6 kilometres from the town centre.\nTogether with other municipalities it takes part in the \"Associazione Citt\u00e0 del Vino\", the movement \"Patto dei Sindaci\", \"Progetto Citt\u00e0 dei Bambini\", \"Rete dei Comuni Solidali\" and \"Patto Territoriale Golfo di Castellammare\".\nGeography.\nTerritory.\nAlcamo is situated in the middle of the Gulf of Castellammare, at 258 metres above the sea level and at the foot of Mount Bonifato, a calcareous complex 825 metres high. At the altitude of 500 metres (near the \"Funtanazza\") there is the Nature Reserve of Monte Bonifato.\nThe territory of Alcamo also includes Alcamo Marina, mainly used as a summer resort.\nClimate.\nThe climate is mild, with higher rainfall during winter than summer.\nThe average annual temperature is 16.9 \u00b0C, with higher temperatures in August (24.8\u00a0\u00b0C) and lower temperatures in February (10.3\u00a0\u00b0C).\nThe average annual rainfall is 558\u00a0mm. Rainfall is particularly scarcer in July (4\u00a0mm) and more abundant in December (83\u00a0mm).\nHistory.\nEtymology.\nThere are discordances about the etymology of the toponym \"Alcamo\". According to some scholars, the name Alcamo would derive from \"caccamu\", a dialectal word referring to the plant \"Citrullus colocynthis\".\nPrehistory.\nThough there is little information about it, there are evidences that territory of Alcamo was inhabited even in prehistoric times; in one of the most ancient sites, near \"contrada\" Molinello (a country district), they discovered archaeological findings dating back to the Mesolithic, approximately 9,000\u20136,000 BC and other very old ones dating back to the Neolithic during the archaeological excavations done by the archaeologist Paolo Orsi (1899) and the marquis Antonio De Gregorio (1917) near the river Fiume Freddo. One of the most important finds is an axe from the Neolithic, kept at the Museo archeologico regionale Paolo Orsi of Syracuse.\nLonguro and Longarico.\nFrom the quotations by Lycophron we know that in old times there was an inhabited centre called \"Longuro\" on Mount Bonifato. According to an old story, this settlement was founded by a Greek colony which had escaped from the destruction of the town of Troy.\nDuring the Roman period the inhabitants of Longuro moved to the foot of the mountain so they could practice agriculture in the surrounding lands. The town was called Longaricum; this name appears in the \"Itinerario di Antonino Pio\" (=\u00a0Itinerary of Antoninus Pius, in the 3rd century AD) and would coincide with the Latin name of Longuro.\nAccording to a supposition the two hillocks appearing on the gonfalon of Alcamo would represent both the towns of Longaricum and Longuro.\nOrigins.\nThe first document mentioning Alcamo is dating back to 1154, in a paper written by the Berber geographer Idrisi who was given this task by Roger II of Sicily in order to get a collection of geographic maps. From a distance longer than a mile, the writer describes the position of Alcamo viewed from the Castle of Calatubo (visible even today from the town territory) and defines it as a hamlet or a group of houses with rich soil and a flourishing market.\nMedieval age.\nAlcamo was divided into four hamlets named San Vito, San Leonardo, Sant'Ippolito and San Nicol\u00f2 del Vauso. but a series of revolts between 1221 and 1243 led King Frederick II to move most of the population to a colony at Lucera, while Christians from Bonifato came to inhabit the town. In this period the poet Ciullo or Cielo d'Alcamo was born.\nIn 1340 Raimondo Peralta acquired the feud and barony of Alcamo from Peter II of Aragon. Then the barony passed to his son Guglielmo Peralta Sclafani, called \"Guglielmone\". and afterwards to the Ventimiglia family (up to 1397), Giaimo de Prades (1407), the Cabrera family, the Speciale family, Pietro Balsamo prince of Roccafiorita (1618) and finally to Giuseppe Alvarez (1777).\nIn the 14th century Alcamo had several thousands of inhabitants and hundreds of them had immigrated from different parts of Sicily and Italy (in particular: Pisa, Amalfi, Bologna, Calabria, Liguria), and some also from Spain. During this period, Antonello da Messina moved to Alcamo for three years (around 1438\u20131441) in order to learn the tanning techniques from the tanner master Guglielmo Adragna di Alcamo, in fact the town was an important pole of development for commerce and handicraft. In particular, it had a massive exchange of wheat and wine with the nearby towns and there were also expert artisans such as bakers, blacksmiths, tanners and weavers. During this century Alcamo was an important centre for wheat storage and sorting. In the same period the writer Giacomo Adragna transcribed the \"Commentarii in Persium\" and Pietro d'Alcamo many works from the library of San Martino.\nModern age.\nAt about the year 1500, Alcamo was under the jurisdiction of the captain of justice Ferdinando Vega, who fought against the raiding Turkish pirates. The town was surrounded by defensive embattled walls provided with four gates:\nDuring this period, the town was divided into four-quarters, each one associated with the name of the main church in that area:\nThe division between these quarters was coincident with the main streets of the town, that are the present Corso 6 Aprile and Via Rossotti and its continuation via dei Baroni Emanuele di San Giuseppe (called incorrectly \"Via Barone di San Giuseppe\").\nIn 1535, in coincidence with the visit of the emperor Charles V, coming back from Tunisia, the old Porta Trapani was closed and four gates were opened:\nDuring the 16th century there was a development in education in Alcamo because of the construction of new schools and the activity of expert teachers, in particular the poet and scholar Sebastiano Bagolino (1562\u20131604). In 1547 the Madonna appeared to some women of the people and an image of Madonna \"Fons Misericordiae\" was discovered and worshipped as \"Our Lady of Miracles\".\nIn the late 16th century, the population was decimated by an infectious disease. and the victims were buried in the cemetery of Saint Ippolito.\nIn 1667 Mariano Ballo ordered the construction of a theatre, called \"teatro Ferrigno\", later demolished and rebuilt during the 1960s; after the reconstruction it was first called \"cine-teatro Euro\" and later \"Teatro Cielo d'Alcamo\".\nDuring the 18th century, pestilence and popular rebellions occurred in Alcamo again. On the other hand, this age was important for art because of the construction of the Basilica of Our Lady of the Assumption (1699), designed by the architects Angelo Italia and Giuseppe Diamante. Its interior was also decorated with 38 frescoes made by the Flemish painter Guglielmo Borremans between 1736 and 1737. In the same period the Church of Saint Olivia was renovated, Saint Paul and Bartholomew's Church was rebuilt (1689), and the Church of the Holy Crucifix (or saint Francis of Paola) was completed (1699) together with the monumental church of College some decades later(1767).\nBetween 1752 and 1780, Ignazio De Blasi, an Alcamese nobleman, wrote the first book on Alcamo's history, entitled: \"Discorso storico della opulenta citt\u00e0 di Alcamo situata a pi\u00e8 del Monte Bonifato, e dell'antichissima citt\u00e0 di Longarico ossia Lacarico, dopo detta Alcamo, su di esso monte\".\nThe population of the town, gradually recovered from the pestilence and increased to 13,000 in 1798.\nContemporary age.\nAt the beginning of the 19th century Alcamo's feudal status was abolished (1812) and the town became a direct royal possession.\nThe archpriests Stefano Triolo Galifi and Giuseppe Virgilio, together with the baron Felice Pastore were members of the Sicilian Parliament as representatives of Alcamo. In 1820, during a revolt, there were different murders, sacks, release of criminals from prison and a fire in the municipal archives. and in 1829 many people died of cholera. \nIn 1843 the construction of the present Town Hall started, on a land of the baron Felice Pastore.\nOn 6 April 1860, Stefano and Giuseppe Triolo let the Italian Tricolour wave on the town hall, creating groups of volunteers in order to help Giuseppe Garibaldi in the battle of Calatafimi and from Alcamo some dictatorial edicts on Victor Emmanuel II's behalf were issued. Some time later Francesco Crispi prepared the Constitution for the lands set free. Further to this event, Corso Imperiale was named Corso 6 Aprile, in memory of 6 April, in which the volunteers started to be enlisted in Alcamo.\nDuring the Unification of Italy the brothers Triolo of Sant'Anna and Giuseppe Coppola of Monte San Giuliano enlisted many citizens to fight with the \"Garibaldians\" in 1860.\nAt the end of the 19th century, in 1897, public lighting was inaugurated in Alcamo during the traditional feast of Our Lady of Miracles. Among the most important people of this period we have to remind Don Giuseppe Rizzo, a priest who founded the bank called \"Cassa Rurale e Artigiana Don Rizzo\" (1902).\nAt the beginning of the 20th century (1901\u20131911) the number of citizens in Alcamo diminished abruptly, partially because of the emigration of 36,718 Sicilians abroad and in particular to the United States, but it is possible that the statistics about this year and the previous years were not reliable because the census was carried out without following certain criteria. In the same period the cultivations in the territory of Alcamo were affected by phylloxera and two banks (\"Cooperativa\" and \"Segestana\") went bankrupt with subsequent economic difficulties for its citizens.\nThere were also some events linked to the Mafia, such as the murder of Gaspare Cottone, a carter (1899) and the death of the 19-years-old Benedetto Guastella during a fire conflict with carabinieri in 1900.\nAs the Mafia had taken power in the districts of Trapani and Alcamo, the commissary Cesare Mori intervened with a series of arrests and charges against the material executors of the crimes occurred in the area and finally they arrested Vincenzo and Michele Tedesco, brothers, and Baldassare Adragna, considered the heads of the gangs in Trapani's territory.\nDuring the First World War, four hundred citizens from Alcamo died and the following period was characterized by poverty because of monetary inflation and banditry. In 1918 about five hundred people died because of Spanish flu and in the Second World War 213 citizens from Alcamo died or were lost. In 1927, Don Vincenzo Giovenco (1880\u20131954) operated and opened the first cinema in Alcamo, 'Cinema Marconi'. It subsequently closed less than ten years after opening, due to a fire \nThe foundation of \"Societ\u00e0 Elettrotecnica Palermitana\", whose name was changed into \"Societ\u00e0 Generale Electrica della Sicilia\" (SGES) and which installed an important electric workroom in the district of Saint Augustine in Alcamo, dates back to the twenties. The jobs inside this firm were very longed-for because it was the only firm in Trapani Province which had a Health insurance fund and granted holidays. The electric workroom existed until 1963, when it was acquired by Enel and demolished. During the years in which SGES operated, there was an improvement of the electric services in Alcamo's territory, owing also to the realization of several artificial lakes.\nDuring Fascism, the citizens asked the government to appoint Alcamo as the capital of the province (1930), but this request was not satisfied. \nOn 19 August 1937 the fascist leader Benito Mussolini visited the town, crossing Corso 6 Aprile by an open car and parading through the crowd of his supporters. The visit was due to the inauguration of the railway line between Trapani and Alcamo, completed in the same year. Some weeks later, prince Umberto visited Alcamo too.\nOn 21 July 1943 the American troops entered Alcamo without any opposition, freeing the town from Italian Fascism.\nOn 18 December 1944, because of the economic and social discomfort, the citizens raised up, occupied the Town Hall and put its archives on fire.\nSince 1960 the town planning system has been greatly expanding, particularly at the foot of Mount Bonifato with the construction of \"Viale Europa\", which is one of the most important street in Alcamo.\nAt about the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s there was a bloody Mafia war between the clan Greco (related to the Rimi family) and the members of the emergent Mafia of Corleone, led by the boss Vincenzo Milazzo in the territory of Alcamo. Vincenzo Milazzo received orders from Tot\u00f2 Riina to eliminate members of the old Mafia (in particular the member of the clan Greco) and put in command only his trusted men. \nJust for this reason the Greco family represented an obstacle: the cause which roused the conflict was the approaching of some members of Cosa Nostra to the rival clan of Grecos. The war bathed the town in blood for about five years and provoked tens of victims. The new Corleone's Mafia prevailed, but the cost to be paid was very high, because a lot of members of this clan died.\nDuring the same period, in which there were armed clashes between the Mafia families, at contrada Virgini in Alcamo, they discovered the biggest heroin refinery in Sicily. (1985) Tens of people died in five years, and at the end the Mafia of Corleone prevailed.\nWhile the crimes of the Mafia went on and tens of people disappeared as victims of \"lupara bianca\", there was a religious revival which led to the birth of several Catholic associations such as \"Rinnovamento nello Spirito Santo\", Neocatechumenal Way and the movement of Comunione e Liberazione. From the last one the parish community of the Church of Jesus Christ the Redeemer originated in the district of Sant'Anna (2006). This religious revival was followed by a new interest into the town's old traditions, mentioned in the works of Roberto Calia and Carlo Cataldo, historians from Alcamo. Carlo Cataldo has also been prized several times both for his historical works and for his dialectal poems which tell Alcamo's folklore.\nIn the 21st century there was a renovation of Alcamo's architectural context, thanks to the restoration of some important historical buildings such as the Castle of the Counts of Modica, the Theatre Cielo d'Alcamo, the Cine-Theatre Marconi, the Ex Jesuits' College, the Cuba delle rose (in 2013), the church of College (in 2014), the fa\u00e7ade of Badia Nuova (in 2014) and the old Arab fountain (in 2016). Thanks also to the intervention of Fondo Ambiente Italiano, it is expected the restoration of the Castle of Calatubo; its chapel and the path leading to the castle have already been cleaned by the volunteers' association \"Salviamo il Castello di Calatubo\" (in 2015).\nAmong the works of revaluation of the urban areas there are the restoration of Piazza Ciullo by the architect Gae Aulenti (1996) and the realization of an underground car park in Piazza Bagolino, together with the creation of the near suburban park San Francesco.\nThe interest in environment is also associated with that in the territory, in fact, after the adhesion to the initiative \"Rifiuti Zero\" (Zero Rubbish), Alcamo has been considered an example to be followed for the results got between 2010 and 2013 in the field of waste sorting (raccolta differenziata).\nCoat of arms.\nThe Coat of arms of Alcamo used since the kingdom of Frederick II of Swabia is a black flying Eagle, crowned by Gold in a Silver range, with three hills below and two Golden Oaks.\nA sculpture of the coat of arms is put on a side wall of the Church of Saint Francis of Assisi, near Porta Palermo.\nMain sights.\nCivil buildings.\nThere are several historical civil buildings in Alcamo:\nMilitary buildings.\nMilitary buildings in Alcamo include:\nArchaeological sites.\nIn the territory of Alcamo there are several and interesting archaeological sites:\nNatural areas.\nAmong the areas of naturalistic interest near Alcamo there are the beaches of Alcamo Marina, the Nature Reserve Bosco di Alcamo on Mount Bonifato and the Segestan thermal baths.\nThe hot springs are produced by the reclimbing of water of meteoric origin which meets the water of Fiume Caldo. They are seven kilometres far from Alcamo and next to the boundary with the territory of Castellammare del Golfo, a small town which shares this naturalistic attraction with Alcamo.\nAccording to the narration given by Diodorus Siculus, they were created by the nymphs to favour Eracle's rest during his trip from Piloro to Erice.\nHinterland.\nThe surrounding areas include interesting touristic and historical locations like Segesta and Gibellina. The old fishing village of Scopello, from Alcamo, has been referred to as having a remarkable seaside. Another small town considered worth visiting is Castellammare del Golfo which is between these two places.\nSociety.\nDemographical evolution.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nEthnic groups and foreign minorities.\nAccording to the ISTAT data of 1 January 2013, the foreign people resident in Alcamo were 1,258 people corresponding to the 2.58% of the residing population. The most represented nationalities, according to the percentage on the total residing population, were:\nCulture.\nThe poet Cielo d'Alcamo (known also as \"Ciullo d'Alcamo\") was the author of the contrasto \"Rosa fresca aulentissima\". He wrote in vernacular in the 12th century and was from Alcamo.\nMany important places of the town, such as the main square, the theatre and the Classical Lyceum founded in 1862, have been named after the famous poet.\nFrom the cultural point of view, in the following centuries Alcamo saw the rise of activities connected with arts such as the construction of churches and buildings, first in the baroque and then Renaissance style, with the coming of several artists of international level: painters (like Guglielmo Borremans and the very talented Pietro Novelli from Monreale), sculptors (Antonello Gagini and Giacomo Serpotta) and other various artists who embellished the town's image.\nInside the Castle of the Counts of Modica there is a puppet theatre: it has born again thanks to the engagement of Salvatore Oliveri, the grandson of the puppet master Gaspare Canino, who worked in Alcamo for about 50 years, continuing the work of Luigi, his father.\nThey often give performances inside the castles or in the square.\nIt is also noteworthy the activity of Compagnia Piccolo Teatro, a theatre company founded in 1976, which has seen the rise (and success) of some actors and theatre directors.\nDuring the feasts in Alcamo there are often streets entertainers and pedlars selling sweets, dried fruit and different objects in their stands called \"baracchelle\".\nMuseums.\nInside Alcamo churches there are several artistic works.\nApart from foreign artists, there were painters Giuseppe Renda and Gino Patti; among the living artists Turi Simeti, Vito Bongiorno and Gisella Giovenco; sculptors were Giuseppe Bambina, Pietro Montana and Nicola Rubino.\nMedia.\nThere is a local radio, Radio Alcamo Centrale, which operates in the territory since 1976.\nThe oldest periodical in Alcamo is \"Il Bonifato\".\nThe networks in Alcamo are Alpa Uno (since 1976) and Video Sicilia (since 1987).\nMusic.\nThere are various musical associations in Alcamo:\nDance.\nThere are different school dances in Alcamo, such as: \nLocal market.\nThe local market in Alcamo (called \"mercatino\") takes place every Wednesday morning in Via Tre Santi, near Viale Italia.\nCuisine.\nSome specialities of cuisine of Alcamo are:\nEconomy.\nAlcamo is one of the most important centres in Sicily for wine production, especially Bianco Alcamo D.O.C., made from vineyards with espalier or \"tendone\" structures and using white common or bright catarratto vines, eventually associated with damaschino, grecanico and trebbiano.\nBesides the wine activity there are cattle and sheep breeding, olive growing (for the extraction of extra virgin olive oil), cereals (particularly wheat) and the typical oval melon, with a green wrinkled peel, locally called \"miluni purceddu\", which has the peculiarity that can be kept longer than other kinds of melon.\nIn the primary sector it is also significant quarrying (of different marbles and mostly travertino), though the tertiary sector (more or less advanced) has however got the majority of employed people.\nTransports and infrastructures.\nThere are two motorway junctions from A29 motorway Palermo-Mazara del Vallo: Alcamo Est and Alcamo Ovest, apart the junction of Castellammare del Golfo which links up with the north entrance to Alcamo. Another motorway junction is from Alcamo Ovest (A29 motorway, diramazione Alcamo-Trapani). \nAlcamo is crossed by two National Roads: strada statale 113, connecting Trapani with Messina, and strada statale 119, connecting Alcamo with Castelvetrano.\nThe Railway line doesn't pass through the town centre but along the coast, then inland on the west side. The railway station of Alcamo Diramazione is located near the motorway junction of Alcamo Ovest and the station of Castellammare del Golfo is situated in the territory of Alcamo, precisely at Alcamo Marina.\nThese State Highways (or National Roads) pass through Alcamo:\nThese Regional Roads (SR) of Sicily:\nAnd also these Provincial Roads (SP) of the province of Trapani pass through Alcamo:\nIn the area of Alcamo there are also the following \"draining roads\" of the province of Trapani:\nAlong the National Road Palermo-Sciacca (SS 624) there is the exit \"Alcamo\" in both directions and is about 30\u00a0km from on the south-west side of the town. This exit, wholly located in the territory of Poggioreale, connects with the National Road of Gibellina (SS 119) near the ex railway station and motorway junction of Gallitello through the Provincial road SP9 (of the series n.182 Macchia-Sella-Bonfalco) and the SB0 (a local link road of Gibellina), to the border between the territories of Poggioreale and Monreale.\nAlcamo is about 40\u00a0km from the airport \"Falcone-Borsellino Airport\" of Palermo-Punta Raisi and about 50\u00a0km from the \"Vincenzo Florio Airport\" of Trapani-Birgi.\nSport.\nThe most popular and practised sport in Alcamo, as in most Italian towns, has always been soccer; the greatest team is the Alcamo team, which was in the past a protagonist in some football seasons in League C (Italian Serie C), for its victories against Bari and Crotone, and in League D. Apart various regional trophies, it has won the Coppa Italia Dilettanti in 1996 and the subsequent Supercoppa Italiana Dilettanti. Together with the golden period in League C, these were the most notable pages of the football history in Alcamo. A recent society crisis has caused bankruptcy and the team which played in League D had to restart from the First Category League. Today it competes in the regional Eccellenza championship following the 2010 refoundation.\nThe activity of juvenile soccer is very active, and the Adelkam football school emerges among the various youth teams because it has launched different football players and has won a lot of national and international competitions. Alcamo is also the principal centre of the \"Costa Gaia International Trophy\", a youth football kermess in which a lot of titled teams take part and where many great players of the bigger championships have been the protagonists.\nBasketball is also popular, today with better results than football anyway. The female team Basket Alcamo (Gea Magazzini) which has obtained important results in its history (a long participation in A1 League and the final match in the Ronchetti Cup), has played in the A2 League for eleven years, and has regained the major league in the season 2011\u20132012. The male team has also obtained good results, but not at the same levels.\nThe local handball team, Pallamano Alcamo plays its home matches at the \"Palasport Enzo D'Angelo\".\nSport facilities.\nThe town has got several sport facilities, the most important are the stadium Lelio Catella (with a capacity of about 10,000 people) for football and athletics, the \"Palazzetto dello Sport (sports hall) Tre Santi\" for Basket and the \"Palasport Enzo D'Angelo\" (an indoor stadium) for handball.\nThere is a private swimpool open to public use (La Fenice) where young boys (who have won National prizes) train regularly. In the same facility there is an ice-skating rink.\nWhen Alcamo football team played in League C, the home matches were played at stadium Don Rizzo, which together with Sant'Ippolito stadium, is now used by juvenile and minor teams.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "44768", "revid": "50850684", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44768", "title": "Mont Blanc", "text": "Highest mountain in the Alps (4,806.m)\nMont Blanc (, ) is a mountain in the Alps, rising above sea level, located right at the Franco-Italian border. It is the highest mountain in Europe outside the Caucasus Mountains, the second-most prominent mountain in Europe (after Mount Elbrus in Russia), and the 11th most prominent mountain in the world.\nThe mountain gives its name to its range, the Mont Blanc massif, which straddles parts of France, Italy, and Switzerland. Mont Blanc's summit lies on the watershed line between the valleys of Ferret and Veny in Italy, and the valleys of Montjoie, and Arve in France. Ownership of the summit area has long been disputed between France and Italy.\nThe Mont Blanc massif is popular for outdoor activities such as hiking, climbing, and trail running and winter sports such as skiing and snowboarding. The most popular climbing route to the summit of Mont Blanc is the Go\u00fbter Route, which typically takes two days.\nThe three towns and their communes which surround Mont Blanc are Courmayeur in Aosta Valley, Italy; and Saint-Gervais-les-Bains and Chamonix in Haute-Savoie, France. The latter town was the site of the first Winter Olympics. A cable car ascends and crosses the mountain range from Courmayeur to Chamonix through the Col du G\u00e9ant. The Mont Blanc Tunnel, constructed between 1957 and 1965, runs beneath the mountain and is a major transalpine transport route.\nGeology.\nMont Blanc and adjacent mountains in the massif are predominantly formed from a large intrusion of granite (termed a batholith) which was forced up through a basement layer of gneiss and mica schists during the Variscan mountain-forming event of the late Palaeozoic period. The summit of Mont Blanc is located at the point of contact of these two rock types. To the southwest, the granite contact is of a more intrusive nature, whereas to the northeast it changes to being more tectonic. The granites are mostly very-coarse grained, ranging in type from microgranites to porphyroid granites. The massif is tilted in a north-westerly direction and was cut by near-vertical recurrent faults lying in a north\u2013south direction during the Variscan orogeny. Further faulting with shear zones subsequently occurred during the later Alpine orogeny. Repeated tectonic phases have caused breakup of the rock in multiple directions and in overlapping planes. Finally, past and current glaciation caused significant sculpting of the landscape into its present-day form.\nThe first systematic account of the minerals of the Mont Blanc area was published in 1873 by Venance Payot. His list, entitled \"Statistique min\u00e9ralogique des environs du Mt-Blanc\", catalogued 90 mineral types although it also included those present only as very small components of rocks. If these are excluded, it is known today that at least 68 separate mineral species occur across the wider range of the Mont Blanc massif.\nClimate.\nLocated on the watershed between the Rh\u00f4ne and the Po, the massif of Mont Blanc is also situated between the two different climatic regions of the northern and western Alps and that of the southern Alps. Climatic conditions on the Mer de Glace are similar to those found on the northern side of the Swiss Alps.\nThe climate is cold and temperate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification \"Cfb\"), and is greatly influenced by altitude. Being the highest part of the Alps, Mont Blanc and surrounding mountains can create their own weather patterns. Temperatures drop as the mountains gain in height, and the summit of Mont Blanc is a permanent ice cap, with temperatures around . The summit is also prone to strong winds and sudden weather changes. Because of its great overall height, a considerable proportion is permanently glaciated or snow-covered and is exposed to extremely cold conditions.\nThere is, however, significant variation in precipitation with altitude. For example, the village of Chamonix below Mont Blanc is at an elevation of approximately . It receives around of annual precipitation, whilst the Col du Midi, which is at above sea level, receives significantly more, totalling . However, at an even higher altitude (near the summit of Mont Blanc), precipitation is considerably less, with only around recorded, despite the latter measurements being taken at the height of .\nHistory.\nThe Mont Blanc was the highest mountain of the Frankish Empire under Charlemagne and the highest mountain of the Holy Roman Empire until 1792.\nPierre Martel's 1744 map and sketch of the Chamonix valley contains what is considered the first printed appearance of the name \"Mont Blanc\".\nIn 1760, Swiss naturalist Horace-B\u00e9n\u00e9dict de Saussure began to go to Chamonix to observe Mont Blanc. He tried to summit it with the Courmayeur mountain guide Jean-Laurent Jordaney, a native of Pr\u00e9-Saint-Didier, who accompanied De Saussure since 1774 on the Miage Glacier and Mont Crammont.\nThe first recorded ascent of Mont Blanc (at the time neither within Italy nor France) was on 8 August 1786 by Jacques Balmat and the doctor Michel Paccard. This climb, initiated by Horace-B\u00e9n\u00e9dict de Saussure, who rewarded the successful ascent, traditionally marks the start of modern mountaineering. The first woman to reach the summit was Marie Paradis in 1808.\nOwnership of the summit.\nAt the scale of the Mont Blanc massif, the border between Italy and France passes along most of the main Alpine watershed, from the Aiguille des Glaciers to Mont Dolent, where it reaches the border with Switzerland. However, its precise location near the summits of Mont Blanc and nearby D\u00f4me du Go\u00fbter is disputed. Italian officials claim the border follows the watershed, splitting both summits between Italy and France. In contrast, French officials claim the border avoids the two summits, placing them entirely with France. The size of these two (distinct) disputed areas is approximately on Mont Blanc and on D\u00f4me du Go\u00fbter.\nIn 1723, the Duke of Savoy, Victor Amadeus II, acquired the Kingdom of Sardinia. The resulting state of Sardinia was to become preeminent in the Italian unification.\nCiting the Treaty of Paris (1796), France claims that the historical border of Savoy and Piedmont diverged from the watershed line, fully encompassing the summit of Mont Blanc within Savoy and consequently, within French territory.\nAfter the Napoleonic Wars, the Congress of Vienna restored the King of Sardinia in Savoy, Nice, and Piedmont, his traditional territories, overruling the 1796 Treaty of Paris. Forty-five years later, after the Second Italian War of Independence, it was replaced by a new legal act. This act was signed in Turin on 24 March 1860 by Napoleon III and Victor Emmanuel II of Savoy, and deals with the annexation of Savoy (following the French neutrality for the plebiscites held in Tuscany, Modena, Parma and Romagna to join the Kingdom of Sardinia, against the Pope's will). A demarcation agreement, signed on 7 March 1861, defined the new border. With the formation of Italy, for the first time, Mont Blanc was located on the border of France and Italy, along the old border between the department of Savoy and that of Piedmont, formerly belonging to the Savoyard state.\nThe 1860 act is still legally valid for both the French and Italian governments. Italy claims, that the border was moved by France in 1865, when surveys carried out by a cartographer of the French army, Captain JJ Mieulet, incorporated the summit into French territory, making the state border deviate from the watershed line, and giving rise to the differences with the maps published in Italy in the same period.\nModern Swiss mapping, published by the Federal Office of Topography, plots a region of disputed territory (statut de territoire contest\u00e9) around the summits of both Mont Blanc and the D\u00f4me du Go\u00fbter. One of its interpretations of the French-Italian border places both summits straddling a line running directly along the geographic ridgeline (watershed) between France and Italy, thus sharing their summits equally between both states. However, a second interpretation places both summits, as well as that of Mont Blanc de Courmayeur (although much less clearly in the latter case), solely within France.\nNATO maps take data from the Italian national mapping agency, the Istituto Geografico Militare, which is based upon past treaties in force.\nJanssen observatory.\nIn 1890, Pierre Janssen, an astronomer and the director of the Meudon astrophysical observatory, considered the construction of an observatory at the summit of Mont Blanc. Gustave Eiffel agreed to take on the project, provided he could build on a rock foundation if found at a depth of less than below the ice. In 1891, the Swiss surveyor Imfeld dug two horizontal tunnels below the ice summit but found nothing solid. Consequently, the Eiffel project was abandoned.\nDespite this, the observatory was built in 1893. During the cold wave of January 1893, a temperature of was recorded on Mont Blanc, being the lowest ever recorded there.\nLevers attached to the ice supported the observatory. This worked to some extent until 1906, when the building started leaning heavily. The movement of the levers corrected the lean slightly, but three years later (two years after Janssen's death), a crevasse started opening under the observatory. It was abandoned. Eventually the building fell, and only the tower could be saved \"in extremis\".\nAir crashes.\nThe mountain was the scene of two fatal air crashes; Air India Flight 245 in 1950 and Air India Flight 101 in 1966. Both planes were approaching Geneva Airport and the pilots miscalculated their descent; 48 and 117 people, respectively, died. The passengers on flight 101 included nuclear scientist Homi J. Bhabha, known as the \"father\" of India's nuclear programme.\nTunnel.\nIn 1946, a drilling project was initiated to carve a tunnel through the mountain. The Mont Blanc tunnel would connect Chamonix, France, and Courmayeur, Italy, and become one of the major transalpine transport routes between the two countries. In 1965, the tunnel opened to vehicle traffic with a length of .\n1999 disaster.\nIn 1999, a transport truck caught fire in the tunnel beneath the mountain. In total, 39 people were killed when the fire raged out of control. The tunnel was renovated in the aftermath to increase driver safety. Renovations include computerised detection equipment, extra security bays, a parallel escape shaft, and a fire station in the middle of the tunnel. The escape shafts also have clean air flowing through them via vents. Any people in the security bays now have live video contact to communicate with the control centre. A remote site for cargo safety inspection was created on each side: Aosta in Italy and Passy-Le Fayet in France. Here all trucks are inspected before entering the tunnel. These remote sites are also used as staging areas to control commercial traffic during peak hours. The renovated tunnel reopened three years after the disaster.\nElevation.\nThe summit of Mont Blanc is a thick, perennial ice-and-snow dome whose thickness varies. Therefore, no exact and permanent summit elevation can be determined, though accurate measurements have been made on specific dates.\nIts official elevation was for a long time. In 2002, the IGN and expert surveyors, with the aid of GPS technology, measured it to be .\nAfter the 2003 heatwave in Europe, a team of scientists remeasured the height on 6 and 7 September. The team was made up of the glaciologist Luc Moreau, two surveyors from the GPS Company, three people from the IGN, seven expert surveyors, four mountain guides from Chamonix and Saint-Gervais and four students from various institutes in France. This team noted that the elevation was , and the peak had shifted to a point away from where it had been in 2002.\nAfter these results were published, more than 500 points were measured to assess the effects of climate change and the mountain's height fluctuations at different points. Since then, the mountain's elevation has been measured every two years.\nThe summit was measured again in 2005, and the results were published on 16 December 2005. The height was found to be , more than the previously recorded height. The rock summit was found to be at , some west of the ice-covered summit.\nIn 2007, the summit was measured at and in 2009 at .\nIn 2013, the summit was measured at and in 2015 at .\nFrom the summit of Mont Blanc on a clear day, the Jura, the Vosges, the Black Forest, and the Massif Central mountain ranges can be seen, as well as the principal summits of the Alps.\nClimbing routes.\nSeveral classic climbing routes lead to the summit of Mont Blanc:\nNowadays, the summit is ascended by an average of 20,000 mountaineer tourists each year. It could be considered a technically easy yet arduous ascent for someone well-trained and acclimatised to the altitude. From l'Aiguille du Midi (where the cable car stops), Mont Blanc seems quite close, being higher. But while the peak looks deceptively close, the La Voie des 3 Monts route (known to be more technical and challenging than other more commonly used routes) requires more ascent over two other mountains, Mont Blanc du Tacul and Mont Maudit, before the final section of the climb is reached. The last push to the summit is undertaken.\nEach year climbing deaths occur on Mont Blanc. On the busiest weekends, normally around August, the local rescue service performs an average of 12 missions, mostly directed to aid people in trouble on one of the normal routes of the mountain. Some routes require knowledge of high-altitude mountaineering and a guide (or at least an experienced mountaineer), and all require proper equipment. All routes are long and arduous, involving delicate passages and the hazard of rockfall or avalanche. Climbers may also suffer altitude sickness, occasionally life-threatening, particularly if they are not properly acclimatised.\nFatalities.\nA 1994 estimate suggests there had been 6,000 to 8,000 alpinist fatalities in total, more than on any other mountain. These numbers exclude the fatalities of Air India Flight 245 and Air India Flight 101, two planes that crashed into Mont Blanc. Despite unsubstantiated claims recurring in media that \"some estimates put the fatality rate at an average of 100 hikers a year\", actual reported annual numbers at least since the 1990s are between 10 and 20: in 2017, fourteen people died out of 20,000 summit attempts, and two remained missing; with 15 in 2018 as of August.\nA French study on the especially risky \"Go\u00fbter couloir, on the normal route on Mont Blanc\" and necessary rescue operations found that, between 1990 and 2011, there were 74 deaths \"between the T\u00eate Rousse refuge (3,187 m) and the Go\u00fbter refuge (3,830 m)\". There were 17 more in 2012\u201315, none in 2016, and 11 in 2017.\nRefuges.\nImpacts of climate change.\nThe recent temperature rises and heatwaves, such as those of the summers of 2015 and 2018, have significantly impacted many climbing routes across the Alps, including those on Mont Blanc. For example, in 2015, the Grand Mulets route, previously popular in the 20th century, was blocked by virtually impenetrable crevasse fields, and the Go\u00fbter Hut was closed by municipal decree for some days because of a very high rockfall danger, with some stranded climbers evacuated by helicopter.\nIn 2016 a crevasse opened at high altitude, also indicating previously unobserved glacial movements. The new crevasse forms an obstacle to be scaled by climbing parties on the final part of the itinerary to the top shared by the popular Go\u00fbter Route and the Grand Mulets Route.\nExploits and incidents.\nIncidents involving children.\nIn July 2014, an American entrepreneur and traveller Patrick Sweeney attempted to break the record with his nine-year-old son and 11-year-old daughter. They were caught in an avalanche, escaped death and decided not to pursue their attempt.\nIn August 2014, an unknown Austrian climber with his 5-year-old son were intercepted by mountain gendarmes at and forced to turn back.\nOn 5 August 2017, 9-year-old Hungarian twins and their mother were rescued from by helicopter while their father and family friend continued their summit attempt.\nProtection.\nThe Mont Blanc massif is being put forward as a potential World Heritage Site because of its uniqueness and cultural importance considered the birthplace and symbol of modern mountaineering. It would require the three governments of Italy, France and Switzerland to request UNESCO for it to be listed.\nMont Blanc is one of the most visited tourist destinations in the world. For this reason, some view it as threatened. Pro-Mont Blanc (an international collective of associations for the protection of Mont Blanc) published in 2002 the book \"Le versant noir du mont Blanc\" (The black hillside of Mont Blanc), which exposes current and future problems in conserving the site.\nIn 2007, Europe's two highest toilets (at 4,260 metres, 13,976 feet) were taken by helicopter to the top of Mont Blanc. They are also serviced by helicopter. They will serve 30,000 skiers and hikers annually, helping to alleviate the discharge of urine and faeces that spreads down the mountain face with the spring thaw.\nGlobal warming has begun to melt glaciers and cause avalanches on Mont Blanc, creating more dangerous climbing conditions.\nPanorama.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Cubemap viewer/styles.css\"/&gt;) * 1px); --pitch: calc( var(--calculator-pitch, -1) * 1deg ); --yaw: calc( var(--calculator-yaw, 30) * 1deg ); background-color: #7D7F7C; color: black /*Make lint happy*/\" data-calculator-for=\"originalYaw;originalPitch;yaw;pitch\" data-calculator-formula=\"ifequal(getclick(type),1,yaw,originalYaw);ifequal(getclick(type),1,pitch,originalPitch);((atan(getclick(startx)/600 * 2 - 1) - atan( getclick(x)/600*2 - 1 )) * 180/pi *hfov / 90 ) + originalYaw;((atan(getclick(y) / 225 * 2 - 1) - atan(getclick(starty) / 225 * 2 - 1)) * 180 / pi * (2 * atan(tan(hfov/360*pi) * 225 / 600) * 180 / PI) / 90) + originalPitch\"&gt;\n-18030\nSpherical panorama from Mont Blanc\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "44770", "revid": "6908984", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44770", "title": "Segesta", "text": "Ancient Sicilian city\nSegesta (, \"Egesta\", or , \"S\u00e9gesta\", or , \"A\u00edgesta\"; ) was one of the major cities of the Elymians, one of the three indigenous peoples of Sicily. The other major cities of the Elymians were Eryx and Entella. It is located in the northwestern part of Sicily in Italy, near the modern commune of Calatafimi-Segesta in the province of Trapani. The hellenization of Segesta happened very early and had a profound effect on its people.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nThe origin and foundation of Segesta are extremely obscure. The tradition current among the Greeks and adopted by Thucydides, ascribed its foundation to a band of Trojan settlers, fugitives from the destruction of their city; and this tradition was readily welcomed by the Romans, who in consequence claimed a kindred origin with the Segestans. Thucydides seems to have considered the Elymians (), a barbarian tribe in the neighborhood of Eryx and Segesta, as descended from the Trojans in question; but another account represents the Elymi as a distinct people, already existing in this part of Sicily when the Trojans arrived there and founded the two cities. A different story seems also to have been current, according to which Segesta owed its origin to a band of Phocians, who had been among the followers of Philoctetes; and, as usual, later writers sought to reconcile the two accounts.\nAnother version of the Trojan story related in Virgil's \"Aeneid\", which would seem to have been adopted by the inhabitants themselves, ascribed the foundation of the city jointly by the territorial king Egestus or Aegestus (the Acestes of Virgil), who was said to be the offspring of a Dardanian damsel named Segesta by the river god Crinisus, and by those of Aeneas' folk who wished to remain behind with Acestes to found the city of Acesta. We are told also that the names of Simois and Scamander were given by the Trojan colonists to two small streams which flowed beneath the town, and the latter name is mentioned by Diodorus Siculus as one still in use at a much later period.\nThe belief that the name of the city was originally Acesta or Egesta and changed to Segesta by the Romans to avoid its ill-omened meaning in Latin ( means \"poverty\" or \"lack\") is disproved by coins which prove that considerably before the time of Thucydides it was called by the inhabitants themselves Segesta, though this form seems to have been softened by the Greeks of Magna Graecia into Egesta.\nThe city was occupied by a people distinct from the Sicanians, the native race of this part of Sicily, and on the other that it was not a Greek colony. Thucydides, in enumerating the allies of the Athenians at the time of the Peloponnesian War, distinctly calls the Segestans barbarians. At the same time they appear to have been, from a very early period, in close connection with the Greek cities of Sicily, and entering into relations both of hostility and alliance with the Hellenic states, wholly different from the other barbarians in the island. The early influence of Greek civilisation is shown also by their coins, which are inscribed with Greek characters, and bear the unquestionable impress of Greek art.\nIn historical accounts.\nThe first historical notice of the Segestans transmitted to us represents them as already engaged (as early as 580 BC) in hostilities with Selinus (modern Selinunte), which would appear to prove that both cities had already extended their territories so far as to come into contact with each other. By the timely assistance of a body of Cnidian and Rhodian emigrants under Pentathlus, the Segestans at this time obtained the advantage over their adversaries. A more obscure statement of Diodorus relates that again in 454 BC, the Segestans were engaged in hostilities with the Lilybaeans for the possession of the territory on the river Mazarus. The name of the Lilybaeans is here certainly erroneous, as no town of that name existed till long afterwards; but we know not what people is really meant, though the presumption is that it is the Selinuntines, with whom the Segestans seem to have been engaged in almost perpetual disputes. It was doubtless with a view to strengthen themselves against these neighbors that the Segestans took advantage of the first Athenian expedition to Sicily under Laches (426 BC), and concluded a treaty of alliance with Athens. This, however, seems to have led to no result, and shortly after, hostilities having again broken out, the Selinuntines called in the aid of the Syracusans, with whose assistance they obtained great advantages, and were able to press Segesta closely both by land and sea. In this extremity the Segestans, having in vain applied for assistance to Agrigentum, and even to Carthage, again had recourse to the Athenians, who were, without much difficulty, persuaded to espouse their cause, and send a fleet to Sicily in 416 BC. It is said that this result was in part attained by fraud, the Segestans having deceived the Athenian envoys by a fallacious display of wealth, and led them to conceive a greatly exaggerated notion of their resources. They, however, actually furnished 60 talents in ready money, and 30 more after the arrival of the Athenian armament.\nBut though the relief of Segesta was thus the original object of the great Athenian expedition to Sicily (415\u2013413\u00a0BC), that city bears little part in the subsequent operations of the war. Nicias, indeed, on arriving in the island, proposed to proceed at once to Selinus, and compel that people to submission by the display of their formidable armament. But this advice was overruled: the Athenians turned their arms against Syracuse, and the contest between Segesta and Selinus was almost forgotten in the more important struggle between those two great powers. In the summer of 415\u00a0BC an Athenian fleet, proceeding along the coast, took the small town of Hyccara, on the coast, near Segesta, and made it over to the Segestans. The latter people are again mentioned on more than one occasion as sending auxiliary troops to assist their Athenian allies; but no other notice occurs of them.\nThe final defeat of the Athenians left the Segestans again exposed to the attacks of their neighbors, the Selinuntines. Feeling themselves unable to cope with them, they again had recourse to the Carthaginians, who determined to espouse their cause, and sent them, in the first instance, an auxiliary force of 5000 Africans and 800 Campanian mercenaries, which sufficed to ensure them a victory over their rivals in 410 BC. This was followed the next year by a vast armament under Hannibal Mago, who landed at Lilybaeum, and, proceeding direct to Selinus, took and destroyed that city as well as Himera. The Carthaginian power now became firmly established in the western portion of Sicily. Segesta, surrounded on all sides by this formidable neighbor, naturally fell gradually into the position of a dependent ally of Carthage. It was one of the few cities that remained faithful to this alliance even in 397 BC, when the great expedition of Dionysius I of Syracuse to the West of Sicily and the siege of Motya seemed altogether to shake the power of Carthage. Dionysius in consequence laid siege to Segesta, and pressed it with the utmost vigor, especially after the fall of Motya. The city, however, was able to defy his efforts, until the landing of Himilco with a formidable Carthaginian force changed the aspect of affairs, and compelled Dionysius to raise the siege.\nFrom this time there are few mentions of Segesta till the time of Agathocles of Syracuse, under whom it suffered a great calamity. The despot landed in the West of Sicily on his return from Africa (307 BC), and was received into the city as a friend and ally. He suddenly turned upon the inhabitants on a pretence of disaffection, and put the whole of the citizens (said to amount to 10,000 in number) to the sword, plundered their wealth, and sold the women and children into slavery. He then changed the name of the city to Dicaeopolis, and assigned it as a residence to the fugitives and deserters that had gathered around him.\nIt is probable that Segesta never altogether recovered this blow; but it soon resumed its original name, and again appears in history as an independent city. Thus it is mentioned in 276 BC, as one of the cities which joined Pyrrhus of Epirus during his expedition into the West of Sicily. It, however, soon after fell again under the power of the Carthaginians; and it was probably on this occasion that the city was taken and plundered by them, as alluded to by Cicero; a circumstance of which there are no other account. It continued subject to, or at least dependent on that people, till the First Punic War. In the first year of that war (264 BC) it was attacked by the consul Appius Claudius Caudex, but without success; but shortly after the inhabitants put the Carthaginian garrison to the sword, and declared for the alliance of Rome. They were in consequence besieged by a Carthaginian force, and were at one time reduced to great straits, but were relieved by the arrival of Gaius Duilius, after his naval victory in 260 BC. Segesta seems to have been one of the first of the Sicilian cities to set the example of defection from Carthage; on which account, as well as of their pretended Trojan descent, the inhabitants were treated with great distinction by the Romans. They were exempted from all public burdens, and even as late as the time of Cicero continued to be \"sine foedere immunes ac liberi\" \u2013 a free and immune city. After the destruction of Carthage, Scipio Africanus restored to the Segestans a statue of Diana which had been carried off by the Carthaginians, probably when they obtained possession of the city after the departure of Pyrrhus.\nDuring the Second Servile War also, in 102 BC, the territory of Segesta is again mentioned as one of those where the insurrection broke out with the greatest fury. But with the exception of these incidental notices we hear little of it under the Roman government. It seems to have been still a considerable town in the time of Cicero, and had a port or emporium of its own on the bay about 10\u00a0km distant. This emporium seems to have grown up in the days of Strabo to be a more important place than Segesta itself: but the continued existence of the ancient city is attested both by Pliny and Ptolemy; and we learn from the former that the inhabitants, though they no longer retained their position of nominal independence, enjoyed the privileges of the Latin citizenship. It seems, however, to have been a decaying place, and no trace of it is subsequently found in history. The site is said to have been finally abandoned, in consequence of the ravages of the Saracens, in 900 AD, and is now wholly desolate. The modern town of Castellammare del Golfo, about 10\u00a0km distant, occupies nearly, if not precisely, the same site as the ancient emporium or port of Segesta.\nSituation.\nThe ruins of the city are located on the top of Monte B\u00e0rbaro at 305\u00a0m above sea level. The city was protected by steep slopes on several sides and by walls on the more gentle slope towards the temple.\nThe hilltop offers a view over the valley towards the Gulf of Castellamare. The city controlled several major roads between the coast to the north and the hinterland. Very little is known about the city plan. Aerial photography indicates a regular city plan, built in part on terraces to overcome the natural sloping terrain. The current remains might be from the reconstruction after the destruction of the city by Agathocles.\nCurrent archaeological work indicates that the site was reoccupied by a Muslim community in the Norman period. Excavations have unearthed a Muslim necropolis and a mosque from the 12th century next to a Norman castle. Evidence suggests that the mosque was destroyed after the arrival of a new Christian overlord at the beginning of the 13th century. The city appears to have been finally abandoned by the second half of the 13th century.\nThe temple.\nOn a hill just outside the site of the ancient city of Segesta lies an unusually well-preserved Doric temple. Some think it to have been built in the 420s BC by an Athenian architect, despite the city not having any Greek population. The prevailing view is that it was built by the indigenous Elymians. The temple has six by fourteen columns on a base measuring 21 by 56\u00a0metres, on a platform three steps high. Several elements suggest that the temple was never finished. The columns have not been fluted as they normally would have been in a Doric temple, and there are still bosses present in the blocks of the base (used for lifting the blocks into place but then normally removed). The temple also lacks a cella, any ornamentation, altar or deity dedication, and was never roofed over. The temple was never completed due to the war between Segesta and Selinunte. It managed to escape destruction by the Carthaginians in the late 5th century BC.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n\u00a0This article\u00a0incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain:\u00a0"}

It was the studio's second feature-length musical, and one of their earliest sound films. Produced by Harry Rapf and Irving Thalberg and directed by Charles Reisner, it features nearly all of MGM's stars in a two-hour revue that includes three segments in Technicolor. The masters of ceremonies are Conrad Nagel and Jack Benny.\nAt the 2nd Academy Awards, the film received a Best Picture nomination (its sole nomination) but lost to another Irving Thalberg MGM production, \"The Broadway Melody\".\nAs a film published in 1929, it entered the public domain on January 1, 2025.\nProduction.\nUnlike M-G-M's imposing feature films, which always boasted strong story values, \"The Hollywood Revue of 1929\" was a plotless parade of variety acts. Conrad Nagel, interviewed for the book \"The Real Tinsel\", recalled, \"Everybody thought Harry Rapf was crazy for making it.\" Billed as an \"All-Star Musical Extravaganza\", the film includes performances by once and future stars, including Joan Crawford singing and dancing on stage. (She later remarked, \"\"Revue\" was one of those let's-throw-everyone-on-the-lot-into-a musical things, but I did a good song-and-dance number.\"). Other segments feature Gus Edwards, John Gilbert, Norma Shearer, Lionel Barrymore, Buster Keaton, Marie Dressler, Bessie Love, Marion Davies, Anita Page, and the comedy team of Karl Dane and George K. Arthur.\nHighlights of the film are a comedy routine starring Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy as inept magicians, and a variety of musical performances. One of these is the debut of \"Singin' in the Rain\", performed initially by Cliff Edwards as \"Ukulele Ike,'\" and later performed at the end of the film by the entire cast. This latter all-star color sequence was a last-minute addition to the film, shot late at night on June 10, 1929, just ten days before the premiere at Grauman's Chinese Theatre. The only major M-G-M stars missing from the revue are Greta Garbo, Ramon Novarro, and Lon Chaney, although Chaney is referred to by name in one of the songs performed and Garbo is spoken of during one of the introductory dialogues. Only one sequence was cut from the film: three songs by The Brox Sisters, which was recycled into a short subject, \"Gems of MGM\". Another sequence, a parody of the Albertina Rasch ballet's \"pearl dance\" by Marie Dressler, was planned but not shot (as the film's production records reveal). Instead, the number was replaced by one featuring Buster Keaton, though Dressler did pose for stills wearing a Lady Godiva wig.\nThe film is sometimes cited, as on the DVD release of the 1952 \"Singin' in the Rain\", as the film that led to the downfall of Gilbert's career. Gilbert, a popular silent film actor best known for his work opposite Garbo, possessed a pleasant, tenor speaking voice which did not always match his heroic, dashing screen image. In \"Hollywood Revue\" he plays the balcony scene from \"Romeo and Juliet\" with Norma Shearer, first straight, then for laughs with contemporary slang. It is possible, though, that the negative effect of the film on Gilbert's career has been overstated, since many contemporary reviews made no criticism of his performance. His problems really began with the next two films he made, \"His Glorious Night\" (1929) and \"Redemption\" (1930).\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Conrad Nagel (singing voice dubbed by Charles King)\nMusical numbers.\nThe circulating print of \"The Hollywood Revue of 1929\" runs as follows:\nReception.\nThe film, which was shot in 25 days with a budget of US$426,000, was popular with audiences and critics alike, especially in its initial big-city engagements. \"Brimming over with good fun and catchy music\", Mordaunt Hall of \"The New York Times\" wrote. \"Variety\" called it \"the top novelty film to be turned out to date...If the theater booths give it an even break, nothing can stop it.\" \"Film Daily\" reported, \"A smash and a wow. Smart revue with plenty of comedy beautifully dressed and a cast that is gilt-edged.\" John Mosher of \"The New Yorker\" called it \"the most extravagant and extensive musical comedy so far presented by the talking pictures, and is in itself a complete evening's entertainment.\"\nThe film went on to make a profit of $1.1 million and was considered for the Academy Award for Best Picture. Producer Rapf tried to follow it up with another revue, \"The Hollywood Revue of 1930\", which was changed during production to \"The March of Time\", and finally abandoned. Musical numbers already shot for the film were edited into M-G-M short subjects of the early 1930s.\nAlternate version.\nSome sources list the original running time of \"Hollywood Revue of 1929\" as 130 minutes. At least two sequences in the original roadshow version are missing from current prints: an opening recitation by the showgirls who are seen posing in the \"Hollywood Revue\" sign after the opening credits, and the appearance of Nils Asther, who assisted Jack Benny in introducing the final \"Orange Blossom\" number.\nPreservation.\nThe film survives intact with its original Technicolor sequences.

{"id": "44772", "revid": "4180087", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44772", "title": "Calabria", "text": "Region of Italy\nCalabria is a region in Southern Italy. It is a peninsula bordered by the region Basilicata to the north, the Ionian Sea to the east, the Strait of Messina to the southwest, which separates it from Sicily, and the Tyrrhenian Sea to the west. It has 1,832,147 residents as of 2025 across a total area of . Catanzaro is the region's capital.\nCalabria is the birthplace of the name of Italy, given to it by the Ancient Greeks who settled in this land starting from the 8th century BC. They established the first cities, mainly on the coast, as Greek colonies. During this period Calabria was the heart of Magna Graecia, home of key figures in history such as Pythagoras, Herodotus and Milo.\nIn Roman times, it was part of the \"Regio III Lucania et Bruttii\", a region of Augustan Italy. After the Gothic War, it became and remained for five centuries a Byzantine dominion, fully recovering its Greek character. Cenobitism flourished, with the rise throughout the peninsula of numerous churches, hermitages and monasteries in which Basilian monks were dedicated to transcription. The Byzantines introduced the art of silk in Calabria and made it the main silk production area in Europe. In the 11th century, the Norman conquest started a slow process of Latinization.\nIn Calabria there are three historical ethnolinguistic minorities: the Grecanici, speaking Calabrian Greek; the Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb people; and the Occitans of Guardia Piemontese. This extraordinary linguistic diversity makes the region an object of study for linguists from all over the world.\nCalabria is famous for its crystal clear sea waters and is dotted with ancient villages, castles and archaeological parks. Three national parks are found in the region: the Pollino National Park (which is the largest in Italy), the Sila National Park and the Aspromonte National Park.\nEtymology.\nStarting in the third century BC, the name \"Calabria\" was originally given to the Adriatic coast of the Salento peninsula in modern Apulia. In the late first century BC this name came to extend to the entirety of the Salento, when the Roman emperor Augustus divided Italy into regions. The whole region of Apulia received the name \"Regio II Apulia et Calabria\". By this time modern Calabria was still known as \"Bruttium\", after the Bruttians who inhabited the region. Later in the seventh century AD, the Byzantine Empire created the Duchy of Calabria from the Salento and the Ionian part of Bruttium. Even though the Calabrian part of the duchy was conquered by the Lombards during the eighth and ninth centuries AD, the Byzantines continued to use the name \"Calabria\" for their remaining territory in Bruttium.\nOriginally the Greeks used \"Italoi\" to indicate the native population of modern Calabria, which according to some ancient Greek writers was derived from a legendary king of the Oenotri, Italus. \nOver time the Greeks started to use \"Italoi\" for the rest of the southern Italian peninsula as well. After the Roman conquest of the region, the name was used for the entire Italian peninsula and eventually the Alpine region too.\nGeography.\nThe region is generally known as the \"toe\" of the Italian Peninsula, and is a long and narrow peninsula which stretches from north to south for , with a maximum width of . Some 42% of Calabria's area, corresponding to 15,080\u00a0km2, is mountainous, 49% is hilly, while plains occupy only 9% of the region's territory. It is surrounded by the Ionian and Tyrrhenian seas. It is separated from Sicily by the Strait of Messina, where the narrowest point between Capo Peloro in Sicily and Punta Pezzo in Calabria is only .\nThree mountain ranges are present: Pollino, La Sila, and Aspromonte, each with its own flora and fauna. The Pollino Mountains in the north of the region are rugged and form a natural barrier separating Calabria from the rest of Italy. Parts of the area are heavily wooded, while others are vast, wind-swept plateaus with little vegetation. These mountains are home to a rare Bosnian Pine variety and are included in the Pollino National Park, which is the largest national park in Italy, covering 1,925.65 square kilometres.\nLa Sila, which has been referred to as the \"Great Wood of Italy\", is a vast mountainous plateau about above sea level and stretches for nearly along the central part of Calabria. The highest point is Botte Donato, which reaches . The area boasts numerous lakes and dense coniferous forests. La Sila also has some of the tallest trees in Italy which are called the \"Giants of the Sila\" and can reach up to in height. The Sila National Park is also known to have the purest air in Europe.\nThe Aspromonte massif forms the southernmost tip of the Italian peninsula bordered by the sea on three sides. This unique mountainous structure reaches its highest point at Montalto, at , and is full of wide, man-made terraces that slope down toward the sea.\nMost of the lower terrain in Calabria has been agricultural for centuries, and exhibits indigenous scrubland as well as introduced plants such as the prickly pear cactus. The lowest slopes are rich in vineyards and orchards of citrus fruit, including the Diamante citron. Further up, olives and chestnut trees appear while in the higher regions there are often dense forests of oak, pine, beech and fir trees.\nClimate.\nCalabria's climate is influenced by the sea and mountains. The Mediterranean climate is typical of the coastal areas with considerable differences in temperature and rainfall between the seasons, with an average low of during the winter months and an average high of during the summer months. Mountain areas have a typical mountainous climate with frequent snow during winter. The erratic behavior of the Tyrrhenian Sea can bring heavy rainfall on the western slopes of the region, while hot air from Africa makes the east coast of Calabria dry and warm. The mountains that run along the region also influence the climate and temperature of the region. The east coast is much warmer and has wider temperature ranges than the west coast. The geography of the region causes more rain to fall along the west coast than that of the east coast, which occurs mainly during winter and autumn and less during the summer months.\nBelow are the two extremes of climate in Calabria, the warm mediterranean subtype on the coastline and the highland climate of Monte Scuro.\nGeology.\nCalabria is commonly considered part of the \"Calabrian Arc\", an arc-shaped geographic domain extending from the southern part of the Basilicata Region to the northeast of Sicily, and including the Peloritano Mountains (although some authors extend this domain from Naples in the north to Palermo in the southwest). The Calabrian area shows basement (crystalline and metamorphic rocks) of Paleozoic and younger ages, covered by (mostly Upper) Neogene sediments. Studies have revealed that these rocks comprise the upper part of a pile of thrust sheets which dominate the Apennines and the Sicilian Maghrebides.\nThe Neogene evolution of the Central Mediterranean system is dominated by the migration of the Calabrian Arc to the southeast, overriding the African Plate and its promontories.) The main tectonic elements of the Calabrian Arc are the southern Apennines fold-and-thrust belt, the \"Calabria-Peloritani\", or simply Calabrian block and the Sicilian Maghrebides fold-and-thrust belt. The foreland area is formed by the Apulia Platform, which is part of the Adriatic Plate, and the Ragusa or Iblean Platform, which is an extension of the African Plate. These platforms are separated by the Ionian Basin. The Tyrrhenian oceanized basin is regarded as the back-arc basin. This subduction system therefore shows the southern plates of African affinity subducting below the northern plates of European affinity.\nThe geology of Calabria has been studied for more than a century. The earlier works were mainly dedicated to the evolution of the basement rocks of the area. The Neogene sedimentary successions were merely regarded as \"post-orogenic\" infill of \"neo-tectonic\" tensional features. In the course of time, however, a shift can be observed in the temporal significance of these terms, from post-Eocene to post-Early Miocene to post-middle Pleistocene.\nThe region is seismically active and is generally ascribed to the re-establishment of an equilibrium after the latest (mid-Pleistocene) deformation phase. Some authors believe that the subduction process is still ongoing, which is a matter of debate.\nHistory.\nCalabria has one of the oldest records of human presence in Italy, which date back to around 700,000 BC when a type of \"Homo erectus\" evolved leaving traces around coastal areas. During the Paleolithic period Stone Age humans created the \"Bos Primigenius\", a figure of a bull on a cliff which dates back around 12,000 years in the Romito Cave in the town of Papasidero. When the Neolithic period came the first villages were founded around 3,500 BC.\nAntiquity.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[...] as after the death of Oenotrius, Oenotria had another name, and was called Italy, and Morgetia, and after this name it was called Sicily, Chonia, Iapigia, and Salentia, and afterwards cogionta in a name it was called Magna Graecia.\u2014\u200a\nAccording to the Greeks, the region would have been inhabited before colonization by several communities, including the Ausones-Oenotrians (vine-growers), who were the Italians, Morgetes, Sicels, and Chone. It is said that it was from the mythical ruler Italus that Calabria was called \u201cItaly\u201d. The figure of Italus is placed in the first half of the 15th century BC. Antiochus of Syracuse, considered the first historian of the West, depicts him as \u201cA good and wise king, capable of subduing neighboring peoples making use of persuasion and force from time to time\u201d.\nAround 1500\u00a0BC a tribe called the Oenotri (\"vine-cultivators\"), settled in the region. Ancient sources state they were Greeks who were led to the region by their king, Oenotrus. However it is believed they were an ancient Italic people who spoke an Italic language.\nDuring the eighth and seventh centuries BC, Greek settlers founded many colonies (settlements) on the coast of southern Italy. In Calabria they founded Chone (Pallagorio), Cosentia (Cosenza), Clampetia (Amantea), Scyllaeum (Scilla), Sybaris (Sibari), Hipponion (Vibo Valentia), Epizephyrian Locris (Locri), Kaulon (Monasterace), Krimisa (Cir\u00f2 Marina), Kroton (Crotone), La\u00fcs (\"comune\" of Santa Maria del Cedro), Medma (Rosarno), Metauros (Gioia Tauro), Petelia (Strongoli), Rh\u00e9gion (Reggio Calabria), Scylletium (Borgia), Temesa (Campora San Giovanni), Terina (Nocera Terinese), Pandosia (Acri) and Thurii, (Thurio, \"comune\" of Corigliano Calabro).\nIn the year 744 B.C. a group of Chalcidian settlers founded the city of Rhegion (today Reggio Calabria) at the southern end of the Calabrian peninsula. Soon after, again the Chalcidans founded Zancle (current Messina) on the other side of the strait, securing their dominion over that arm of the sea. Later Chalcidian settlers from Rhegion and Zancle would found Metauros (Gioia Tauro), divided the river of the same name (today Petrace) from the Italic city of the Tauri.\nIn 710 B.C. Ionian colonists founded Sybaris on the fertile plain of the same name at the mouth of the Crati. From this colony would later originate the founding of Paestum (in Lucania), Lao (at the mouth of the river of the same name) and Scidros (between Cetraro and Belvedere Marittimo). Ionian colonies were Clampetia (in the area between Amantea and San Lucido), Temesa (between Amantea and Nocera Terinese), Terina (in the plain of Sant'Eufemia), Krimisa (Cir\u00f2 Marina), Petelia (Strongoli).\nIn 743 B.C. Achaean settlers instead founded Kroton (current Crotone), on the point now known as Capo Colonna. Crotonians and Sybarites would later become rivals. But meanwhile, the Crotonians founded the colonies of Caulonia (near today's Monasterace Marina) and Scillezio (Squillace). Around 700 B.C. Crotonian colonists founded Bristacia, current Umbriatico.\nAround 680 B.C. colonists who came from the Greek Locris founded Epizephyrian Locris, near present-day Locri. Colonies of the Locrians were Hipponion (Vibo Valentia) and Medma (Rosarno).\nThe Bruttians, similar to the neighboring Lucanians, declared themselves independent of their \u201ccousins\u201d from beyond the Pollino around the 4th century B.C., forming themselves into a confederate state. The capital of the federates was Consentia, present-day Cosenza. It was one of the main cities along with Pandosia, a city whose traces have been lost; some historical references locate it among the municipalities of Castrolibero, Marano Principato, and Marano Marchesato, while other recent archaeological discoveries would locate the city near the present city of Acri, Aufugum (Montalto Uffugo), Argentanum (San Marco Argentano), Bergae, Besidiae (Bisignano), and Lymphaeum (Luzzi).\nBetween 560 and 550 B.C. a decade-long war was fought between Kroton and Epizephyrian Locris, which was resolved by the battle on the Sagra River, which saw the alliance between the people of Reggio and Locri emerge victorious.\nIn 510 B.C. the Crotonians attacked nearby Sybaris, and faced the Sybarites on the River Trionto, in a clash between 100,000 Crotonians and 300,000 Sybarites. The Dorians won the battle and occupied Sybaris by sacking it for 70 days and diverting the waters of the Crati River onto the ruins of the city.\nIn 444 B.C. Athenian and Peloponnesian colonists founded, on the site of the destroyed Sybaris, the colony of Turi, at the behest of Pericles in the d\u00e9tente plan related to the Thirty Years' Peace in the Peloponnesian War.\nIn 338 BC. Locri asked Dionysius of Syracuse for help against the expansion of Reggio (no longer allied with the Locrians) and Croton. The Syracusans intervened in the Calabrian peninsula by defeating the Crotonians on the narrowest point of the river Sagra, current Allaro, and occupying Croton for ten years, an event that put an end to the power of the Crotonians; similar fate befell Reggio, which although having resisted the numerous attacks of Dionysius of Syracuse, in 386 BC after eleven months of siege was taken by the Syracusans, and for some years also weakened in its political power.\nRhegion was the birthplace of one of the famed nine lyric poets, Ibycus and Metauros was the birthplace of another, Stesichorus, who was amongst the first lyric poets of the western world. Kroton spawned many victors during the ancient Olympics and other Panhellenic Games. Amongst the most famous were Milo of Croton, who won six wrestling events in six Olympics in a row, along with seven events in the Pythian Games, nine events in the Nemean Games and ten events in the Isthmian Games and also Astylos of Croton, who won six running events in three Olympics in a row. Through Alcmaeon of Croton (a philosopher and medical theorist) and Pythagoras (a mathematician and philosopher), who moved to Kroton in 530 BC, the city became a renowned center of philosophy, science and medicine. The Greeks of Sybaris created \"Intellectual Property.\" The Sybarites founded at least 20 other colonies, including Poseidonia (Paestum in Latin, on the Tyrrhenian coast of Lucania), La\u00fcs (on the border with Lucania) and Scidrus (on the Lucanian coast in the Gulf of Taranto). Locri was renowned for being the town where Zaleucus created the first Western Greek law, the \"Locrian Code\" and the birthplace of ancient epigrammist and poet Nossis.\nThe Greek cities of Calabria came under pressure from the Lucanians who conquered the north of Calabria and pushed further south, taking over part of the interior, probably after they defeated the Thurians near Laus in 390 BC. A few decades later the Bruttii took advantage of the weakening of the Greek cites caused by wars between them and took over Hipponium, Terina and Thurii. The Bruttii helped the Lucanians fight Alexander of Epirus (334\u201332 BC), who had come to the aid of Tarentum (in Apulia), which was also pressured by the Lucanians. After this, Agathocles of Syracuse ravaged the coast of Calabria with his fleet, took Hipponium and forced the Bruttii into unfavourable peace terms. However, they soon seized Hipponium again. After Agathloces' death in 289 BC the Lucanians and Bruttii pushed into the territory of Thurii and ravaged it. The city sent envoys to Rome to ask for help in 285 BC and 282 BC. On the second occasion, the Romans sent forces to garrison the city. This was part of the episode which sparked the Pyrrhic war.\nWith the passage of time the name Italy was consolidated in common usage beginning to define the inhabitants of the city-states of the Mezzogiorno first as Italiotes, then Italics with the arrival of the Romans, who would later include Cisalpine Gaul.\nRomanization.\nAt the beginning of the 3rd century BC the cities of southern Italy, which had been allies of the Samnites, were still independent but inevitably came into conflict as a result of Rome's continuous expansion as their expansion in central and northern Italy had not been sufficient to provide new arable lands they needed.\nPyrrhic War.\nBetween 280 and 275 BC the Tarentine War was fought between Rome and Taranto. The latter sought help from Pyrrhus, king of Epirus, who in 280, together with his allies, the Bruttians and Lucanians, defeated the Romans at the Battle of Heraclea, thanks to the use of elephants. But Pyrrhus was later defeated by the Romans at Maluentum (current Benevento) in 275 and retreated to Sicily, where Syracuse needed help against the Carthaginians. Transiting through Calabria, Pyrrhus' army is said to have sacked the shrine of Persephone in Locri, running - it is said - into the wrath of the gods. This, combined with the fact that Rome had formed alliances with some of the last poleis of Magna Graecia, including Reggio, caused Pyrrhus to return home. \nAfter Pyrrhus was eventually defeated, to avoid Roman revenge the Bruttii submitted willingly and gave up half of the Sila, a mountainous plateau valuable for its pitch and timber. Rome subjugated southern Italy by means of treaties with the cities.\nPunic Wars.\nBetween 264 and 251 BC the First Punic War was fought in Sicily, between Rome and Carthage, which would end with the creation of the Roman province of Sicily. Following the Carthaginian provocation with the siege of Saguntum, Spain, the Second Punic War broke out in 217 BC. The Carthaginian general Hannibal, after taking Saguntum and Marseille, crossed the Alps and defeated the Romans at the Trebbia River, the Ticino River, Lake Trasimeno, and in 216 BC at Cannae in Apulia.\nAfter the victory at Cannae, Hannibal achieved his first important political-strategic results. He then made a brief raid on the Roman Ager before retiring to Capua for his leisure. Hannibal sent his brother Mago with part of his forces into Bruttium to accommodate the surrender of those cities that abandoned the Romans and to force out those that refused to do so. The people of Petelia, who remained loyal to the Romans, were attacked not only by the Carthaginians, who occupied their region, but also by the Bruttians who had instead allied themselves with Hannibal. After withstanding a long siege, which lasted 11 months, because the Romans were unable to help them, with their consent, they surrendered. The city was conquered and Hannibal led the army to Cosenza, which, after a less harsh defense, fell to the Carthaginians. At the same time an army of Bruttians, besieged and occupied another Greek city, Croton, except for the fortress alone, inhabited by less than 2,000 people. The Locrians also passed to the Bruttians and the Carthaginians. Only the Regginians preserved their loyalty to Rome and their independence to the last.\nHannibal also had a history of the Punic Wars written on the Carthaginian side, and ordered it to be kept in the temple of Juno Lacinia in Crotone so that the Romans could not falsify the history of the war. Plutarch, writing his work, also drew from that source. But in the summer of 204 B.C. they Romans arrived in Calabria and enslaved the Bruttians to punish them for their rebellion. Vast estates were requisitioned and assigned to members of the Roman aristocracy.\nDuring the Second Punic War (218\u2013201 BC) the Bruttii allied with Hannibal, who sent Hanno, one of his commanders, to Calabria. Hanno marched toward Capua (in Campania) with Bruttian soldiers to take them to Hannibal's headquarters there twice, but he was defeated on both occasions. When his campaign in Italy came to a dead end, Hannibal took refuge in Calabria, whose steep mountains provided protection against the Roman legions. He set up his headquarters in Kroton and stayed there for four years until he was recalled to Carthage. The Romans fought a battle with him near Kroton, but its details are unknown. Many Calabrian cities surrendered to the Romans and Calabria was put under a military commander.\nRoman era.\nNearly a decade after the war, the Romans set up colonies in Calabria: at Tempsa and Kroton (Croto in Latin) in 194 BC, Copiae in the territory of Thurii (Thurium in Latin) in 193 BC, and Vibo Valentia in the territory of Hipponion in 192 BC. \nStarting in the third century BC, the name \"Calabria\" was given to the Adriatic coast of the Salento peninsula in modern Apulia. In the late first century BC this name came to extend to the entirety of the Salento, when the Roman emperor Augustus divided Italy into regions and modern Calabria was known as Regio III Lucania et Bruttii.\nFrom 186 B.C., repression of the Bacchanalia, and of the Greek cult of Bacchus, is triggered throughout Magna Graecia as part of a plan to Romanize southern Italy.\nBetween 136 and 132 BC, the First Servile War was fought in Sicily. The Syrian slave Eunus gathered some 200,000 serfs, proclaiming himself king, and for a full four years held out against the Roman legions from the strongholds of Enna and Taormina. Eventually Rome crushed the repression and had 20 000 slaves crucified throughout the island. The servile war was an expression of the discontent of the slave class, who were disenfranchised and on whom the entire Roman economy rested.\nStill in 132 B.C. the consul Popilius Lenate ordered the construction of the Via Capua-Rhegium, also known as Via Popilia, which, tracing the route now occupied by the A2 Highway and State Road 18 Tirrena, reached Reggio. In this period the main towns in Calabria were Cosenza, Crotone, Temesa, Turi, Vibo Valentia Taurianum, and Reggio.\nBetween 91 and 89 BCE the Social War was fought, at the end of which the Roman Senate granted the Italics Roman citizenship.\nBetween 73 and 71 B.C. the Third Servile War was fought, during which the Thracian gladiator Spartacus gathered around him tens of thousands of desperate slaves, including many Bruttians, and set out from Capua northward, defeating many Roman legions. But the intervention of Marcus Licinius Crassus will crush in a battle on the Sele River in Campania any claim of Spartacus and his men. 6,000 slaves will be crucified along the Appian Way.\nMagna Graecia is commiserated by Marcus Tullius Cicero in a 44 B.C. letter written from Calabria, during the journey to Greece that the orator undertook in the confusing situation determined after Caesar's assassination on the Ides of March.\nImperial era.\nIn rearranging Italy's political geography, Octavian Augustus merged Calabria and Basilicata into Regio III Lucania et Bruttii, with the capital and seat of the corrector in Reggio, the region's largest city.\nAlso Augustus exiled his daughter Julia, guilty of excessive sentimental vivacity, to Reggio.\nIn 61 Paul the Apostle passed through Reggio one day on his way to Rome. Christianity spread in Calabria to the port centers and along the Via Popilia, vital areas of the Roman region.\nEmperor Trajan will have the Via Traiana opened during his rule, which is roughly traced by the old State Road 18 Tirrena halfway up the coast.\nIn 305 the Calabrian patrician of Bruttian origin Bulla rebelled against the Roman Empire with 600 horsemen and 5,000 infantrymen. He was defeated by the imperial militia, but Rome could never fully control the forests of Sila.\nOn October 1, 313 Constantine I promulgated the Edict of Milan in favor of Christianity, which began to spread more and more so that in 391 Emperor Theodosius I proclaimed it the state religion. In 363 Basil the Great landed in Calabria. He was then in Caesarea. It was his disciples who from the ninth century founded various monasteries and cenobia, laying the foundations of the Calabrian-Greek monastic tradition.\nIn 365 an earthquake accompanied by a tidal wave shook the southern Mediterranean, affecting the coastal towns of Calabria.\nThe Roman Empire split into two branches. The Western branch, ruled by Honorius with its capital in Ravenna, suffered in 410 the invasion of Alaric's Visigoths, who sacked Rome and then marched south. Legend has it that Alaric died in Cosenza, being buried at the confluence of the Crati and Busento under the two rivers.\nMiddle Ages.\nWith the fall of the western part of the Roman Empire in 476, Italy was taken over by the Germanic chieftain Odoacer and later became part of the Ostrogothic Kingdom in 489. The Ostrogothic kings ruled officially as Magistri Militum of the Byzantine Emperors and all government and administrative positions were held by the Romans, while all primary laws were legislated by the Byzantine Emperor. Therefore, during the sixth century, under the Ostrogoths' rule, Romans could still be at the center of government and cultural life, such as the Roman Cassiodorus who, like Boethius and Symmachus, emerged as one of the most prominent men of his time. He was an administrator, politician, scholar and historian who was born in Scylletium (near Catanzaro). He spent most of his career trying to bridge the divides of East and West, Greek and Latin cultures, Romans and Goths, and official Christianity and Arian Christianity, which was the form of Christianity of the Ostrogoths and which had earlier been banned. He set up his Vivarium (monastery) in Scylletium. He oversaw the collation of three editions of the Bible in Latin. Seeing the practicality of uniting all the books of the Bible in one volume, he was the first who produced Latin Bibles in single volumes. The most well-known of them was the Codex Grandior which was the ancestor of all modern western Bibles.\nCassiodorus was at the heart of the administration of the Ostrogothic kingdom. Theodoric made him quaestor sacri palatii (quaestor of the sacred palace, the senior legal authority) in 507, governor of Lucania and Bruttium, consul in 514 and magister officiorum (master of offices, one of the most senior administrative officials) in 523. He was praetorian prefect (chief minister) under the successors of Theodoric: under Athalaric (Theodoric's grandson, reigned 526\u201334) in 533 and, between 535 and 537, under Theodahad (Theodoric's nephew, reigned 534\u201336) and Witiges (Theodoric's grandson-in-law, reigned, 536\u201340). The major works of Cassiodorus, besides the mentioned bibles, were the Historia Gothorum, a history of the Goths, the Variae and account of his administrative career and the Institutiones divinarum et saecularium litterarum, an introduction to the study of the sacred scriptures and the liberal arts which was very influential in the Middle Ages.\nByzantine (Eastern Roman) Emperor Justinian I, retook Italy from the Ostrogoths between 535 and 556. They soon lost much of Italy to the Lombards between 568 and 590, but retained the south for around 500 years until 1059\u20131071, where they thrived and where the Greek language was the official and vernacular language. In Calabria and towns such as Stilo and Rossano and San Demetrio Corone achieved great religious status. From the 7th Century many monasteries were built in the Amendolea and Stilaro Valleys and Stilo was the destination of hermits and Basilian monks. Many Byzantine churches are still seen in the region. The 10th-century church in Rossano, together with the \"twin\" church of Sant'Adriano in San Demetrio Corone (foundation 955, rebuilt by the Normans on the, still, visible foundations of the previous Byzantine church), are considered between the best preserved Byzantine churches in Italy. They were both built by St. Nilus the Younger as a retreat for the monks who lived in the tufa grottos underneath. The present name of Calabria comes from the duchy of Calabria.\nAround the year 800, Saracens began invading the shores of Calabria, attempting to wrest control of the area from the Byzantines. This group of Arabs had already been successful in Sicily and knew that Calabria was another key spot. The people of Calabria retreated into the mountains for safety. Although the Arabs never really got a stronghold on the whole of Calabria, they did control some villages while enhancing trade relations with the eastern world. In 918, Saracens captured Reggio (which was renamed \"Riv\u00e0\"), holding many of its inhabitants to ransom or keeping them prisoners as slaves. It is during this time of Arab invasions that many staples of today's Calabrian cuisine came into fashion: Citrus fruits and eggplants for example. Exotic spices such as cloves and nutmeg were also introduced.\nUnder the Byzantine dominion, between the end of the 9th and the beginning of the 10th century, Calabria was one of the first regions of Italy to introduce silk production to Europe.\nAccording to Andr\u00e9 Guillou, mulberry trees for the production of raw silk were introduced to southern Italy by the Byzantines at the end of the ninth century.\nAround 1050 the theme of Calabria had 24,000, mulberry trees cultivated for their foliage, and their number tended to expand.\nAt the beginning of the tenth century (c.\u2009903), the city of Catanzaro was occupied by the Muslim Saracens, who founded an emirate and took the Arab name of \u0642\u0637\u0646\u0635\u0627\u0631 \u2013 Qa\u1e6dan\u1e63\u0101r. An Arab presence is evidenced by findings at an eighth-century necropolis which had items with Arabic inscriptions. Around the year 1050, Catanzaro rebelled against Saracen dominance and returned to a brief period of Byzantine control.\nIn the 1060s the Normans, under the leadership of Robert Guiscard's brother, Roger I of Sicily, established a presence in this borderland, and organized a government modeled on the Eastern Roman Empire and was run by the local magnates of Calabria. Of note is that the Normans established their presence here, in southern Italy (namely Calabria), 6 years prior to their conquest of England, (see The Battle of Hastings). The purpose of this strategic presence in Calabria was to lay the foundations for the Crusades 30 years later, and for the creation of two Kingdoms: the Kingdom of Jerusalem, and the Kingdom of Sicily. Ships would sail from Calabria to the Holy Land. This made Calabria one of the richest regions in Europe as princes from the noble families of England, France and other regions, constructed secondary residences and palaces here, on their way to the Holy Land. Guiscard's son Bohemond, who was born in San Marco Argentano, would be one of the leaders in the first crusade. Of particular note is the Via Francigena, an ancient pilgrim route that goes from Canterbury to Rome and southern Italy, reaching Calabria, Basilicata and Apulia, where the crusaders lived, prayed and trained, respectively.\nIn 1098, Roger I of Sicily was named the equivalent of an apostolic legate by Pope Urban II. His son Roger II of Sicily later became the first King of Sicily and formed what would become the Kingdom of Sicily, which lasted nearly 700 years. Under the Normans southern Italy was united as one region and started a feudal system of land ownership in which the Normans were made lords of the land while peasants performed all the work on the land.\nIn 1147, Roger II of Sicily attacked Corinth and Thebes, two important centers of Byzantine silk production, capturing the weavers and their equipment and establishing his own silkworks in Calabria, thereby causing the Norman silk industry to flourish.\nIn 1194, Frederick II, took control of the region, after inheriting the Kingdom from his mother Constance, Queen of Sicily. He created a kingdom that blended cultures, philosophy and customs and would build several castles, while fortifying existing ones which the Normans previously constructed. After the death of Frederick II in 1250, Calabria was controlled by the Capetian House of Anjou, under the rule of Charles d\u2019Anjou after being granted the crown of the Sicilian Kingdom by Pope Clement IV. In 1282, under Charles d\u2019Anjou, Calabria became a domain of the newly created Kingdom of Naples, and no longer of the Kingdom of Sicily, after he lost Sicily due to the rebellion of the Sicilian Vespers. During the 14th century, would emerge Barlaam of Seminara who would be Petrarch's Greek teacher and his disciple Leonzio Pilato, who would translate Homer's works for Giovanni Boccaccio.\nWhile the cultivation of mulberry was moving first steps in northern Italy, silk made in Calabria reached the peak of 50% of the whole Italian/European production. As the cultivation of mulberry was difficult in Northern and Continental Europe, merchants and operators used to purchase in Calabria raw materials to finish the products and resell them for a better price. The Genoese silk artisans used fine Calabrian silk for the production of velvets.\nIn particular, the silk of Catanzaro supplied almost all of Europe and was sold in a large market fair to Spanish, Venetian, Genoese, Florentine and Dutch merchants.\nCatanzaro became the lace capital of Europe with a large silkworm breeding facility that produced all the laces and linens used in the Vatican. The city was known for its fabrication of silks, velvets, damasks and brocades.\nWaldensian emigration in Calabria.\nThe settlement in the land of Calabria of Waldensian peoples from the valleys bordering the Western Alps - predominantly the Germanasca, Chisone and Pellice valleys - might have taken place in the Swabian period, in the 13th century, although it spread mainly from the first half of the 14th century.\nHistorian Pierre Gilles, author in 1644 of A History of the Reformed Churches, recounts how in 1315 some landowners in Calabria offered the Waldensians land to cultivate, in exchange for an annual fee, with the power to establish communities there free of feudal obligations. This would have favored the founding, or repopulation, of numerous urban centers, such as San Sisto and La Guardia (now called Guardia Piemontese because of its Waldensian origins), inhabited mainly by Waldensians, thus giving rise to a linguistic island in central Calabria, where the most common dialect is Occitan, a dialect typical of the Aosta Valley and northern Piedmont. Here the Waldensian community would live until the second half of the 16th century, when, during the European wars of religion between Catholics and Protestants, the Waldensians adhered to the Lutheran faith, suffering persecution by the Spanish viceroyal authorities.\nEarly modern period.\nIn the 15th century, Catanzaro was exporting both its silk cloth and its technical skills to neighbouring Sicily. By the middle of the century, silk spinning was taking place in Catanzaro, on a large scale. In the 15th century, Catanzaro's silk industry supplied almost all of Europe and was sold at large fairs to Spanish, Venetian, Genoan, Florentine, and Dutch merchants. Catanzaro became Europe's silk capital with a large silkworm farm that produced all the lace used in the Vatican. The city was famous for its manufacture of silks, velvets, damasks and brocades. In 1519, Emperor Charles V formally recognized the growth of Catanzaro's silk industry, allowing the city to establish a consulate of silk crafts, charged with regulating and controlling the various stages of a production that flourished throughout the 16th century.\nIn 1442, the Aragonese took control under Alfonso V of Aragon who became ruler under the Crown of Aragon. In 1501 Calabria came under the control of Ferdinand II of Aragon, whose wife Queen Isabella of Castille is famed for sponsoring the first voyage of Christopher Columbus in 1492. Calabria suffered greatly under Aragonese rule with heavy taxes, feuding landlords, starvation and sickness. After a brief period in the early 1700s under the Austrian Habsburgs, Calabria came into the control of the Spanish Bourbons in 1735. It was during the 16th century that Calabria would contribute to modern world history with the creation of the Gregorian calendar by the Calabrian doctor and astronomer Luigi Lilio.\nIn 1466, King Louis XI decided to develop a national silk industry in Lyon and called a large number of Italian workers, mainly from Calabria. The fame of the master weavers of Catanzaro spread throughout France and they were invited to Lyon to teach the techniques of weaving. In 1470, one of these weavers, known in France as Jean Le Calabrais, invented the first prototype of a Jacquard-type loom. He introduced a new kind of machine which was able to work the yarns faster and more precisely. Over the years, improvements to the loom were ongoing.\nCharles V of Spain formally recognized the growth of the silk industry of Catanzaro in 1519 by allowing the city to establish a consulate of the silk craft, charged with regulating and check in the various stages of a production that flourished throughout the sixteenth century. At the moment of the creation of its guild, the city declared that it had over 500 looms. By 1660, when the town had about 16,000 inhabitants, its silk industry kept 1,000 looms, and at least 5,000 people, busy. The silk textiles of Catanzaro were not only sold at the kingdom's markets, they were also exported to Venice, France, Spain and England.\nThis period also saw the migration of entire communities of Albanians to many towns in northern Calabria, called by the king of Naples himself in recognition of the services that the Albanian leader Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg had rendered to the crown against the Angevins. After 1478 the sovereign allowed these refugees fleeing from the Turkish advance in Albania after Skanderbeg's demise to occupy abandoned villages for the purpose of repopulating them, also granting them numerous royal privileges and franchises: hence the Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb community was born.\nIn the 16th century, Calabria was characterized by a strong demographic and economic development, mainly due to the increasing demand of silk products and the simultaneous growth of prices, and became one of the most important Mediterranean markets for silk.\nAfter the relative pacification, Calabria followed the historical and political events of the Kingdom of Naples, also becoming the scene of struggles between the great powers of the time, France and Spain, for territorial control of the Italian peninsula. For example, on June 28, 1495, the Battle of Seminara, north of Reggio Calabria, took place, where French troops that had occupied the Kingdom of Naples beat the Hispano-Napolitan army under the command of Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba and Ferdinand II of Naples, who, however, managed to take revenge and drive out the French the following year. A few years later, in 1502, C\u00f3rdoba himself conquered Reggio, subjecting it to the rule of the Ferdinand II.\nFrom then on, Calabria was placed under Spanish rule for two centuries and was administratively divided into two parts: Calabria Ulteriore and Calabria Citeriore, initially governed by a single governor, then, from 1582, by two separate officials. The administrative capital of Calabria Citeriore was Cosenza, which during the 16th century went through an impressive artistic and humanistic flowering, so much so that it was called the \u201cAthens of Calabria\u201d. In fact, the city, in addition to being, until 1557, one of the most important cities of the realm in the head of law, became, after Naples, the second city to have a school of cartography, while in 1511 the Accademia Cosentina was born, founded by Aulo Giano Parrasio, followed by the philosopher Bernardino Telesio, defined by Francis Bacon as the first of the \"new men\". Instead, Calabria Ulteriore had two different administrative headquarters: the first was Reggio Calabria, which held the role of capital for 12 years, from 1582 to 1594, losing it due to Turkish raids that sacked it several times; for this reason, from 1594 the seat of the administrative offices of the governorate was transferred to Catanzaro, which maintained this role for more than 220 years. In 1563 philosopher and natural scientist Bernardino Telesio wrote \"On the Nature of Things according to their Own Principles\" and pioneered early modern empiricism. He would also influence the works of Francis Bacon, Ren\u00e9 Descartes, Giordano Bruno, Tommaso Campanella and Thomas Hobbes. In 1602 philosopher and poet Tommaso Campanella wrote his most famous work, \"The City of the Sun\" and would later defend Galileo Galilei during his first trial with his work \"A Defense of Galileo\", which was written in 1616 and published in 1622. In 1613 philosopher and economist Antonio Serra wrote \"A Short Treatise on the Wealth and Poverty of Nations\" and was a pioneer in the Mercantilist tradition.\nCalabria was important to the Spanish monarchs since the reign of Emperor Charles V of Habsburg, who also held the title of King of Naples, as when the sovereign granted numerous royal privileges to the city of Catanzaro, which had valiantly resisted on August 28, 1528, the siege by a French army supported by some Calabrian and Apulian nobles of Francophile tendencies. In gratitude, Charles V granted the city the right to use the imperial eagle as its symbol, exempted it from royal tributes and gave it the power to mint coins worth one carlin. In addition, the emperor personally visited the region in 1535 on his return from the victorious capture of Tunis, where, at the command of a fleet of as many as 500 ships, he had defeated the Ottoman army and freed 20,000 Christian slaves. After the African conquest, Charles V landed in Sicily and then in Calabria, where, having passed Aspromonte, he visited Nicastro, Martirano, Carpanzano, Rogliano, Tessano and Cosenza. From here the monarch passed through Bisignano, Castrovillari and Laino, and then continued on to Naples. During Spanish rule in Calabria, many towns tried to defend themselves from Saracen raids, for example Gioja (current Gioia Tauro), which was fortified with city walls reinforced by watchtowers to defend against incursions. Several Calabrian cities such as Palmi (where the Saracen Tower still stands today) and Reggio Calabria were fortified with towers.\nDespite the heavy taxation and the growth of baronial power, the population never ceased to show loyalty to the sovereign, seen as a defender of the poor people against the abuses of the powerful. The behavior of the people of Catanzaro in 1647-1648, when, exasperated by the excessive tax burden, they stormed the offices of the tax collectors (known as \"arrendatori\"), subsequently setting fire to their houses, must be framed in this light. The governor then intervened, who had the leaders of the revolt hanged, causing the rest of the rebels to flee.\nModern era.\nDuring the 17th century, silk production in Calabria begin to suffer by the strong competition of new-raising competitors in Italian Peninsula and Europe (France), but also the increasing import from Ottoman Empire and Persia.\nFoundation of the historical Italo-Albanian College and Library in 1732 by Pope Clement XII transferred from San Benedetto Ullano to San Demetrio Corone in 1794.\nIn 1783, a series of earthquakes across Calabria caused around 50,000 deaths and much damage to property, so that many of the buildings in the region were rebuilt after this date.\nFollowing the War of the Spanish Succession, the Kingdom of Naples passed in 1707 to Austria, whose Emperor Charles VI of Habsburg also became King of Naples: the Habsburgs, while ruling for a short period, sought to modernize the political structures of the kingdom. In 1733, after the outbreak of the War of Polish Succession, the Spanish Bourbons, allies of France against Austria, decided to attack Naples and secure that kingdom for Charles VII, infante of Spain and son of Philip V of Spain. Charles, who entered Naples in 1734, succeeded in defeating the Austrian troops at the Battle of Bitonto, securing control of the kingdom, despite some pockets of resistance, one of which was Reggio Calabria, which fell on June 20, 1734.\nFor ten years, however, the young Bourbon monarchy had to cope with the intrigues of the Austrian party present in Naples, which was particularly strong in Calabria, where the Duke of Verzino, who had already armed an infantry regiment against the Infante in 1734, promised the Austrians that he could arm 12,000 rebels for their cause of reconquest during the War of Austrian Succession. But after the Battle of Velletri in 1744, in which King Charles VII repelled an Austrian invasion of the realm, the Austrian party disappeared, also decimated by the trials and inquisitions of the Bourbon authorities.\nThe ascension of King Charles VII of Naples aroused considerable enthusiasm throughout the continental Mezzogiorno, as the population hoped that now the resources of the Kingdom of Naples would be used for the development of state and social structures. Sicily, too, was united politically with southern Italy, albeit in personal dominion to the Bourbon ruler; this was an advantage for Calabria, which ceased to be a peripheral region of the realm and became once again at the center of the state structure. This was seen in the journey King Charles made to the region in 1735, as he was on his way to Palermo to be crowned King of Sicily: having arrived on January 24 in Calabria Citeriore, welcomed by the dean of the province, the royal procession proceeded on, touching on Sibari, Corigliano, Rossano, Cir\u00f2 and Strongoli, festively welcomed by the local feudal lords and the archbishop of Rossano, Francesco Maria Muscettola. Then Charles met, on the borders of the province of Calabria Ulterior, the Dean of Catanzaro, to stop later in Crotone, festively welcomed by the local patriciate, and in Cutro, where he was hosted by Giovan Battista Filomarino, prince of the Rocca. Continuing on his journey, the Neapolitan sovereign stayed four days in Catanzaro, receiving the homage of the noble families of De Riso and Schipani; he then went to Monteleone and finally arrived in Palmi, as a guest of Prince Giovan Francesco Grimaldi. From here, Charles embarked in late February for Messina, accompanied by a flotilla of boats arranged by the prince of Scylla, Guglielmo Ruffo.\nFrom the earliest years the reforming action of King Charles, aided by the able Tuscan minister Bernardo Tanucci, was aimed at strengthening central power at the expense of baronial and clerical power, as well as alleviating the social and economic conditions of the humblest strata of the population, but it had modest and alternate results, due to the strong pressures and resistance of the local ruling classes, whose privileges and various particularistic interests were harmed. One particularly reformed field was economic and fiscal: in 1739 the Supreme Magistrate of Commerce was created, consisting of magistrates, technicians, merchants and bankers, with absolute jurisdiction over domestic and foreign trade; in 1741 a Concordat was made with the Holy See, thanks to which from that moment on ecclesiastical properties in the Kingdom of Naples were taxed, while in the same period the so-called \"Catasto onciario\" was commissioned, so called because it was evaluated in ounces (nominal currency equal to 6 ducats or 60 carlins), which was supposed to reorder the tax burden by lowering taxes on the poorest. However, the wide exemptions enjoyed by nobles and clergymen represented the concrete resistance of the privileged classes to this attempt at tax reform.\nIn 1759, however, King Charles, as a result of diplomatic agreements and complicated family events, had to abdicate the throne of Naples to encircle the crown of Spain after the death of his half-brother Ferdinand VI of Spain. The Kingdom of Naples then passed to Charles' son, Ferdinand IV of the Two Sicilies, eight years old, placed under the tutelage of a regency council in which Tanucci had decisive weight. This allowed the continuation of the reforming policy pursued by the minister, particularly in the ecclesiastical field, which culminated in the expulsion of the Jesuits from the Kingdom in 1769 and the forfeiture of their property. Even after Ferdinand came of age, Tanucci remained in office, but in 1774 he was exonerated at the instigation of the new Queen Maria Carolina of Austria, who wanted to bring Naples into the Austrian sphere of influence. However, the king continued the reform season for a time, pandering to the Neapolitan Enlightenment current, consisting of intellectuals such as Ferdinando Galiani, Antonio Genovesi and Gaetano Filangeri.\nDuring this period Calabria experienced a period of strong natural disasters, which were accompanied by profound social and economic changes: this was the case with the plague epidemic of 1743, which struck Reggio Calabria and its surroundings from Messina, delaying for some time the compilation of the \"cadastre onciario\" by the local universities. Also the earthquake of 1783, which struck southern Calabria causing the death of about 50,000 people and the total destruction of Reggio, which had to be completely rebuilt according to more rational and linear architectural criteria, while, to meet the immense reconstruction expenses, King Ferdinand IV, who had already sent the prince of Strongoli, Francesco Pignatelli, to cope with emergencies in the earthquake-affected areas, established on June 4, 1784 the Cassa Sacra, a governmental body that was to manage the funds derived from the expropriation of abolished ecclesiastical property and monasteries and then devolve them into the reconstruction works; in reality it was the wealthy landowners, members of the nascent agrarian bourgeoisie in search of social climbing, who grabbed the best land at the best price, to the detriment of the baronage and local clergy.\nThe reforming action of King Ferdinand of Bourbon came to an end after the events immediately following the French Revolution, whose ideas were spreading across continental Europe thanks to the invasion of French revolutionary armies, causing alarm in the courts of the Old Regime. For this very reason, Ferdinand IV in November 1798 joined the anti-French coalition and marched with his army to Rome, where Pope Pius VI had been deposed and the Roman Republic proclaimed there. But the Bourbon army, after its initial successes, showed its organic deficiencies and had to retreat, pursued by French troops supporting the Italian Jacobin revolutionaries, who forced it to leave Naples for Sicily, while on January 21, 1799, the Parthenopean Republic was proclaimed, whose birth certificate was drafted by the Calabrian Jacobin Giuseppe Logoteta.\nThe new republican regime, however, did not consolidate well among the popular strata of the Mezzogiorno, especially in Calabria, where only Cosenza, Catanzaro and Crotone adhered to the republican cause, while the large Ionian centers and the area opposite the Sicilian coast, such as Reggio Calabria, Scilla, Bagnara and Palmi, remained loyal to the Bourbons. This boded well for the Bourbon royals, in exile in Palermo, that they would be able to regain the kingdom in a short time: so Ferdinand gladly accepted Cardinal Fabrizio Ruffo's proposal to mobilize the peasant masses of Calabria under the name of the king and religion, form an army and recapture Naples. Having received, on February 7, 1799, the title of \u201cVicar of the King\u201d, Cardinal Ruffo landed the next day in Calabria, recruiting the first ranks in the family fiefs of Scilla and Bagnara. Soon Ruffo's army, dubbed the Army of the Holy Faith because it marched under the banners of the Church and the throne, grew to 25,000 men, to which were added bands of brigands, stragglers, deserters. With these men the cardinal succeeded in conquering Paola and Crotone, which were strenuously opposed and cruelly sacked, despite Ruffo's attempts to prevent the looting and violence, and then succeeded, in only four months, in reconquering the entire Kingdom of Naples, granting, in June 1799 an honorable surrender to the last Neapolitan Jacobins barricaded at Fort Saint Elmo. However, it was not respected by either the Bourbon rulers or Admiral Horatio Nelson, who, reneging on the terms of surrender, had 124 Neapolitan revolutionaries hanged, depriving Ruffo of his command.\nFrench interlude and the Bourbon restoration.\nAfter regaining the throne, however, King Ferdinand was unable to consolidate his newly regained power, so much so that in 1806, faced with a new French invasion by Napoleon Bonaparte's troops, he again had to take refuge in Palermo, under the protection of the British navy, while the Kingdom of Naples was entrusted by Napoleon to his older brother Joseph Bonaparte. However, numerous outbreaks of legitimist revolts did not mar in the continental Mezzogiorno, such as in Calabria, where a full-fledged popular insurrection, known as the Calabrian Insurrection, broke out, carried out by brigands, peasants and stragglers from the Bourbon army, supported also by British military units that had landed in the region. In order to tame the revolt, which lasted three years, it was necessary to commit substantial forces and two of the best French generals, Andr\u00e9 Mass\u00e9na and Jean Maximilien Lamarque, who also employed cruel and ruthless means, such as the right of reprisal against entire villages that flanked the brigands and sung the Bourbon, as in the case of the massacre of Lauria, perpetrated by Massena's soldiers.\nIn spite of this, the period of Napoleonic rule caused great innovations and upheavals on the social and economic level: in fact, on August 2, 1806, Joseph Bonaparte decreed the subversion of feudalism, thus abolishing baronial jurisdictions, feudal-like personal benefits, and prohibitory rights, i.e., monopolies on certain productive activities. Lands and property put into liquidation and opened for commercial exploitation by the French government were purchased by members of the new agrarian bourgeoisie, which was beginning to gain increasing political clout. This was accompanied by an administrative division of the Kingdom, which by decree of Dec. 8, 1806, was divided into districts and boroughs: Calabria retained the division of the two provinces of \u201cCiteriore,\u201d whose capital remained in Cosenza, and \u201cUlteriore,\u201d\u201d which instead had Monteleone assigned as its administrative seat in place of Catanzaro, both because of its relative ease of communication and military necessity. Both Calabrian provinces, presided over by an intendant, were divided into four districts, placed under the jurisdiction of their respective sub-districts, which in turn were divided into districts, each of which grouped a certain number of municipalities. In 1810 there was a dynastic change on the throne of Naples: instead of Joseph Bonaparte, placed by the emperor his brother to rule newly conquered Spain, Joachim Murat, Napoleon's brother-in-law as the husband of his sister Caroline Bonaparte, became king of Naples. The new king resumed with more vigor the process of social and economic modernization of his new kingdom: he profoundly reformed the tax system, replacing the Bourbon tax levies such as the \"testatico\", the \"focatico\" and the \"tassa d'industria\", with a single direct land tax that was levied on land ownership; from 1811 he initiated government inquiries to learn about the living conditions of rural populations, while in the economic sphere he showed an interest in the exploitation of mineral resources, as in the case of the mines connected to the Mongiana ironworks in the Serre.\nThe period of Napoleonic rule ended in 1815, after the fall of Napoleon following the defeat at Waterloo, which saw the return of the deposed Bourbon ruler to the throne, despite Murat's attempt in October of the same year to regain the throne with a small military expedition, which in his intentions was supposed to raise the whole of the continental Mezzogiorno. But the former king of Naples, having landed in Pizzo Calabro, was betrayed and captured by Bourbon troops: he was then sentenced to death by a military tribunal presided over by General Vito Nunziante and shot, on October 13, 1815, in the castle of the Calabrian town. Thus, having returned to the throne and consolidated his power, the Bourbon king initiated the administrative unification of the two kingdoms he ruled: in fact, with the law of December 16, 1816, the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies was born, of which Ferdinand was the first monarch with the name Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies.\nCarbonari uprisings to the Expedition of the Thousand.\nThe return of the Bourbons to the throne brought a period of absolute monarchical restoration, but it did not undermine the administrative reforms introduced by the French rulers, as these could be functional for a tighter control of the central government over the peripheral territories. On the contrary, they were increased and strengthened, as in the case of Calabria, which by royal decree of May 1, 1816, had two new administrative divisions: the province of Calabria Ulteriore Prima, with its capital in Reggio, and that of Calabria Ulteriore Seconda, with its headquarters in Catanzaro.\nHowever, the monarchical absolutism of the sovereign generated a clear liberal opposition, formed by those bourgeois cadres of leaders who had prospered during French rule and who now saw themselves outclassed again by aristocratic and clerical exponents for reasons of social class. They were mainly army officers, but also bourgeois, intellectuals and civil servants, many of them adherents of the Carbonari sect, which was founded with the specific purpose of creating an Italy independent of foreign domination and forcing the various Italian sovereigns to grant a liberal constitution. Thus, on July 1, 1820, after the news of the granting in Spain of the Constitution of Cadiz, many Carbonari officers, including cavalry second lieutenants Giuseppe Silvati and Michele Morelli (the latter from Calabria), marched with their regiments from Nola to force Ferdinand I to grant the Constitution, gathering numerous supporters along the road to Naples. The ruler had to give in to popular pressure and grant the constitutional charter, but the liberal experiment was short-lived, as Austrian troops, secretly called to the rescue by Ferdinand himself, crushed the Neapolitan Carbonari uprisings. The main leaders of the revolutionary uprising, Morelli and Silvati, were sentenced to death and hanged in September 1822.\nAfter the death of Ferdinand I in 1825 and the brief reign of his son Francis I, the 20-year-old Ferdinand II, son of Francis I, ascended the throne in 1830; after granting some partial economic and administrative reforms (cutting the civil list, abolishing some unnecessary court expenses, reducing ministers' salaries, recalling former Murattian officers into the army, reorganizing the army), the new ruler, however, did not grant those political and institutional reforms so eagerly awaited by the liberals, instead propping up the police regime established by his predecessors and crushing any hint of political revolt. However, unlike his father and grandfather, Ferdinand II was aware of the conditions in the outlying provinces of his kingdom and therefore decided to make several official trips to visit them: the first of these began on April 7, 1833, when the king, departing from Naples, arrived in Calabria, after passing through Sala Consilina and Lagonegro. On April 11 he was in Castrovillari, passed quickly through Cosenza and Monteleone, visited Tropea, Nicotera, Bagnara and Reggio Calabria, from where he embarked for Messina. After a few days King Ferdinand II returned to Bagnara and then went to visit the Mongiana ironworks; on April 23 he stopped in Catanzaro, then traveled along the Ionian coast and went to Taranto and Lecce, traveled through Capitanata, the Principato Ultra and finally returned to the capital on May 6. During his visit the Bourbon ruler did many useful things: he granted pardons, decreed bridges and roads, corrected some arbitrary actions of public administrators and bestowed substantial relief to earthquake victims who had lost everything in the March 8, 1832 earthquake that occurred in the Crati and Coraci basin.\nIn the years that followed, before the outbreak of the revolutions of 1848, Calabria was the scene of numerous insurrectional uprisings of the liberal and Mazzinian kind, all of which were suppressed by the Bourbon regime. The protagonists were both patriots from other parts of Italy, such as the Venetian Bandiera brothers, who had arrived in 1844 to lend support to the aborted Cosenza revolt, only to be betrayed by one of their comrades and captured by the Bourbon gendarmerie, which shot them in August of that year in Rovito after a summary trial, and Calabrians such as the Five Martyrs of Gerace (Michele Bello, Pietro Mazzoni, Gaetano Ruffo, Domenico Salvadori and Rocco Verduci), who in 1847 tried to make the Gerace district rise up as part of the Mazzinian uprising in Reggio Calabria and Messina on Sept. 2, 1847, being shot after the suppression of the liberal uprising. \nWhen King Ferdinand II was forced to grant a liberal constitution in January 1848 after numerous popular demonstrations to that effect, many southern liberals viewed the change of government with sincere interest, so much so that many of them were elected in the April parliamentary elections. But the ruler had no plans to abide by the constitutional charter: on May 5, 1848, in a coup d'\u00e9tat, he dissolved Parliament and also had Naples, which had rebelled, bombed, causing more than 1,000 deaths among the commoners. At this news, insurrectional committees arose in Calabria to resist Bourbon repression, the most organized of which were from Cosenza and Catanzaro, which called together arms, funds and volunteers to resist the Bourbon army. Despite their efforts, because of divisions over how to conduct military operations, the Calabrian insurgents in June were dispersed by the arrival of 5,000 Bourbon soldiers under the command of Generals Nunziante and Busacca. After the defeat, political repression followed, manifested in death sentences or life in prison (some in absentia) of the major leaders of the uprisings.\nThis caused the final rift between the Bourbon monarchy and the liberal bourgeoisie, stricken and decimated by arrests and persecutions, which would soon join the Italian unified cause. And it was counting on this connection that Giuseppe Garibaldi would manage to land on the Calabrian coast, at Melito di Porto Salvo, on August 19, 1860, after conquering Sicily. Backing the Garibaldi volunteers would be the Calabrian insurgents led by Agostino Plutino from Reggio, thanks to whom, on August 21, with the Battle of Piazza Duomo, he managed to conquer the city of Reggio Calabria. Then, after managing to disarm as many as 12,000 of Colonel Vial's men at Soveria Mannelli, Garibaldi's army marched on Naples, where Garibaldi entered on September 6, triumphantly welcomed by the population. Finally, after the victorious Battle of the Volturno (Sept. 26-Oct. 2, 1860), by which the Bourbon reconquest of Naples was averted, the Meeting of Teano between Garibaldi and King Victor Emmanuel II of Savoy took place on Oct. 26, 1860, and after issuing a proclamation to his new southern subjects, he had the Mezzogiorno annexed to his crown.\nOn 19 August 1860, Calabria was invaded from Sicily by Giuseppe Garibaldi and his Redshirts as part of the Expedition of the Thousand. Through King Francesco II of Naples had dispatched 16,000 soldiers to stop the Redshirts, who numbered about 3,500, after a token battle at Reggio Calabria won by the Redshirts, all resistance ceased and Garibaldi was welcomed as a liberator from the oppressive rule of the Bourbons wherever he went in Calabria. Calabria together with the rest of the Kingdom of Naples was incorporated in 1861 into the Kingdom of Italy. Garibaldi planned to complete the \"Risorgimento\" by invading Rome, still ruled by the pope protected by a French garrison, and began with semi-official encouragement to raise an army. Subsequently, King Victor Emmanuel II decided the possibility of war with France was too dangerous, and on 29 August 1862 Garibaldi's base in the Calabrian town of Aspromonte was attacked by the \"Regio Esercito\". The Battle of Aspromonte ended with the Redshirts defeated with several being executed after surrendering while Garibaldi was badly wounded.\nWith the plebiscite of October 21, 1860, Calabria, along with the other southern provinces, became part of the Kingdom of Sardinia: consequently, new political elections were called to allow the newly annexed territories to have representation in Parliament. The round of elections was held on January 27, 1861, while the new Parliament was inaugurated in Turin on February 18 of the same year: the first and most important measure of the new assembly was the founding of the new Kingdom of Italy, proclaimed on March 17, 1861 with Victor Emmanuel II as constitutional king. However, the way of voting between the plebiscite and the parliamentary elections was very different: in fact, if in 1860 all male citizens who were at least 21 years of age and in possession of civil rights had been able to vote, the next round of elections was governed by the Piedmontese electoral law, which was census-based and provided for voting only for male citizens who were at least 25 years of age, able to read and write and who paid at least 40 liras in taxes. This allowed, thanks to a very narrow electorate, many members of the aristocratic and upper middle class, to which many Calabrian patriots also belonged, such as Francesco Stoccoand the brothers Antonino Plutino and Agostino Plutino, who militated in the major political groupings of the time: the historical Right, of liberal and conservative tendencies, and the historical Left, of progressive and democratic ideas.\nThe political clash between Right and Left was focused particularly on how to complete the Unification of Italy, which still lacked Venice and Rome: the moderates wanted national completion through diplomatic agreements and the mediation of France, the country's historical ally, while the Democrats were more inclined to armed interventions by the Italian army to liberate those territories with the consent of the local populations. This diversity of views can find a tangible depiction in 1862, when the Battle of Aspromonte took place, that is, Giuseppe Garibaldi's attempt to repeat the Expedition of the Thousand, starting from Sicily and moving toward Rome to take it away from the pope and hand it over to the Kingdom of Italy. Urbano Rattazzi, head of the historical Left, who had become after Cavour's death the most influential politician in the Kingdom, as he enjoyed the confidence of the sovereign, was in government at that time. When Garibaldi went to Sicily in the summer of 1862, enthusiastically welcomed by the population, the government basically let it slide, perhaps knowing of his real intentions to liberate Rome; when, however, Napoleon III, a great protector of Pope Pius IX, threatened to send a French expeditionary force to defend the temporal power of the Church, then both King Victor Emmanuel II and Rattazzi ran for cover: the monarch issued a proclamation disavowing the Garibaldians' action, while the government mobilized the army to stop the general. After landing on August 25, 1862, at Melito di Porto Salvo at the head of 3,000 men, Garibaldi was met with gunfire from a military unit that had come out of Reggio: so the Garibaldini fell back to the mountainous massif of Aspromonte, where they marched for three days, encamping near Gambarie, in the territory of Sant'Eufemia d'Aspromonte. Here, on August 29, Garibaldi's volunteers were attacked by a military column commanded by Colonel Emilio Pallavicini: after a brief firefight in which there were casualties on both sides (7 dead and 20 wounded for the Garibaldini, 5 dead and 23 wounded for the regular soldiers), Garibaldi, who wanted to avoid the clash, ordered a cease-fire. Also wounded in the left ankle bone, he surrendered to Pallavicini, who had him transported to Scilla and then to Paola, where he was embarked on a military ship, the pirofregata Duca di Genova, and transported to La Spezia, where he was imprisoned in the Varignano fortress. Although he was later amnestied, the affair caused a political earthquake in Italy, culminating in Rattazzi's resignation as head of government and accusations against the King that he had deluded Garibaldi about the feasibility of carrying out the enterprise, only to abandon it when things got complicated.\nIn the early years of the new Kingdom, Calabria, too, was the scene of the post-unification brigandage, which, having always been endemic in the Mezzogiorno, was also connoted, in the transitional phase between the Bourbon and Italian kingdoms, by legitimist aspirations: in fact, local Bourbon legitimists and the government of Francis II of the Two Sicilies in exile in Rome, attempted to guide and coordinate the action of the various bands of brigands that raged in the South and that were especially hard on the exponents of the newly formed liberal regime (the \u201c\"galantuomini\"\u201d), often exponents of that agrarian bourgeoisie in search of social prestige that had always been invisible to the Bourbon dynasty. The Borjes Expedition, a Bourbon legitimist attempt to reconquer the Kingdom of Naples operated by Jos\u00e9 Borjes, a Catalan general distinguished in the Carlist wars in Spain who thought he would succeed by imitating Cardinal Fabrizio Ruffo's Sanfedist expedition sixty years earlier, must therefore be framed in this light. After receiving reassurance that the local population would support his cause, Borjes departed from Malta and landed in Brancaleone on September 14, 1861 with only 21 men, almost all Spanish: his goal was to make contact with the bands of brigands and unite them into one large army to reconquer all of the Neapolitan territory. To this end, he joined the band of Ferdinando Mittiga, a brigand chief operating in the area under the command of 120 men, but disagreements soon arose, because the brigand wanted to assault the town of Plat\u00ec and take revenge on the local liberals, against the opinion of Borjes, who eventually had to give in. The assault took place on September 17 and was unsuccessful, as the brigands and legitimists were repelled by the National Guards and a regular army unit. This failure soon led to a break in the collaboration between the two commanders: on October 20 Borjes left Calabria to go to Basilicata and join his forces with those of Carmine Crocco, thanks to whom he also achieved some partial successes, but did not achieve the final objective, as the brigand leader refused to turn his men into a regular army. Therefore, noting the failure of the plan, the Catalan general attempted to cross the border into the Papal States and travel to Rome to report to the Bourbon ruler, but he was captured in Tagliacozzo and immediately shot on December 8, 1861. The failure of Borjes' expedition, however, did not put an end to the phenomenon of brigandage, which continued in the Mezzogiorno with greater virulence: for this reason, the first Minghetti government on August 15, 1863 promulgated the Pica law, a regulation that, seeking to combat brigandage, suspended constitutional guarantees for the southern provinces, imposing a state of siege and entrusting captured brigands to the judgment of military tribunals, without the possibility of appeal or defense. As far as Calabria was concerned, the law was applied in the provinces of Calabria Citeriore and Calabria Ulteriore Seconda, while the Reggio area was exempted, as was the area around Naples and part of Apulia, as the situation in these territories was under control. The Pica law remained in force until December 31, 1865, and contributed to eradicating the phenomenon of banditry, albeit with repressive methods and without providing a substantial answer to the many social and economic problems of the southern territories.\nAn underlying issue was that of the latifundium, which was in the hands of a few landowners who represented the economic and political elite of the place, forming the backbone of the southern political class. This also explains the widespread illiteracy, which peaked in the Mezzogiorno, where 90 percent of the population could neither read nor write. Even the extension to the entire Kingdom of the Casati Law, which introduced for the first time compulsory schooling for a maximum of two years, did not produce the hoped-for effects: the municipalities had to provide for the construction and maintenance of school buildings, as well as the recruitment and payment of elementary teachers, which was impossible for many southern municipalities, which did not build schools because they often had negative budgets orlacked the political will to start an effective school education system, as local leaders feared its potential and social claims. The same was true for the next school reform, the Coppino Law of 1877, which raised compulsory schooling to 9 years of age and granted low-interest loans to municipalities that built school buildings: southern municipalities, however, often did not get the work started, as they feared that the new school measure would make the peasant masses more aware of their rights, and thus local notables would lose their electoral clientele.\nIn national politics, there were numerous Calabrian politicians, often with a Risorgimento past behind them, who held important roles in the various Italian governments of that period: Giovanni Nicotera, participant of the Sapri Expedition and comrade of Carlo Pisacane, minister of the interior in the governments of Agostino Depretis and Antonio Di Rudin\u00ec, who headed a Left political formation called the Pentarchy because it included the major leaders of the historical Left (Rudin\u00ec, Francesco Crispi, Giuseppe Zanardelli, Alfredo Baccarini and Benedetto Cairoli), hostile to Depretis' transformist policies; Luigi Miceli, Mazzinian and Garibaldian, minister of Agriculture, Industry and Commerce in the third Cairoli government; Bernardino Grimaldi, minister of Finance in the first Crispi government and the first Giolitti government, culminated in the 1893 Banca Romana Scandal.\nDuring the 1880s, the economic conditions of the Mezzogiorno worsened, and its agricultural economy was severely damaged by the customs war that began between Italy and France in 1889: in fact, to protect its fragile industrial fabric, the Italian government raised import duties on foreign goods, to which France responded by shutting down imports of Italian agricultural goods, sending many southern farms into ruin. This, combined with the severe economic repression of those years, stimulated the phenomenon of emigration, especially to America, a fact that, while it decreased the demand for labor, left entire regions and countries depopulated and deprived these territories of their best energies. A case in point is Castrovillari and its surrounding area, which in 1901 recorded a decrease of 7,190 people due to transoceanic emigration.\nIn the newly unified Kingdom of Italy, there were significant differences in level of economic development between the \"Nord\" (north) of Italy and the \"Mezzogiorno\" (the south of Italy). Calabria together with the rest of the \"Mezzogiorno\" was neglected under the Kingdom of Italy with the general feeling in Rome being that the region was hopelessly backward and poor. In the late 19th century about 70% of the population of the \"Mezzogiorno\" were illiterate as the government never invested in education for the south. Owing to the Roman Question, until 1903 the Roman Catholic Church had prohibited on the pain of excommunication Catholic men from voting in Italian elections (Italian women were not granted the right to vote until 1946). As the devoutly Catholic population of Calabria tended to boycott elections, the deputies who were elected from the region were the products of the clientistic system, representing the interests of the land-owning aristocracy. In common with the deputies from other regions of the \"Mezzogiorno\", they voted against more money for education under the grounds that an educated population would demand changes that would threaten the power of the traditional elite. Owing to a weak state, society in Calabria came to be dominated in the late 19th century by an organized crime group known as 'Ndrangheta which, like the Mafia in Sicily and the Camorra in Campania, formed a \"parallel state\" that co-existed alongside the Italian state. Between 1901 and 1914 Calabrians began emigrating in large numbers, mostly for North America and South America, with the peak year being 1905 with 62,690.\u00a0\nOn 28 December 1908, Calabria together with Sicily was devastated by an earthquake and then by a tsunami caused by the earthquake, causing about 80,000 deaths. Within hours of the disaster, ships of the British and Russian navies had arrived on the coast to assist the survivors, but it took the \"Regia Marina\" two days to send a relief expedition from Naples. The bumbling and ineffectual response of the Italian authorities to the disaster caused by feuding officials who did not wish to co-operate with each other contributed to the high death toll as it took weeks for aid to reach some villages and caused much resentment in Calabria. To offset widespread criticism that the northern-dominated government in Rome did not care about the people of Calabria, King Victor Emmanuel III personally took over the relief operation and toured the destroyed villages of Calabria, which won the House of Savoy a measure of popularity in the region. Most notably, after the king took charge of the relief efforts, the feuding between officials ceased and relief aid was delivered with considerably more efficiency, winning Victor Emmanuel the gratitude of the Calabrians. \u00a0\nWorld War I and the rise of fascism.\nThe outbreak of World War I saw Calabria participate in Italy's war effort with the establishment of five brigades, the most famous of which was the Catanzaro Brigade, formed by two regiments (the 141st and 142nd) and composed almost exclusively of Calabrian soldiers, one of the military units most committed and exploited by the Royal Army in the war against Austria-Hungary. Framed in the Third Army under the command of the Duke of Aosta, the king's cousin, it participated in the Third Battle of the Isonzo, where, on Monte San Michele, between October 17 and 26, 1915, it lost almost half of its personnel (about 6,000 men). In addition, during the Strafexpedition of June 1916, the 141st Brigade Regiment lost 38 percent of its components, with 333 casualties.\nIn addition to being one of the most committed Italian military units decorated for valor during the conflict, the Catanzaro Brigade was also the first to trigger the only episode of open rebellion on the Italian front, which occurred in June 1917: the cause was the order to return immediately to the trenches despite the fact that the Calabrian soldiers had just been sent to the rear for a rest period. Many soldiers from some companies of the 142nd Regiment began a revolt against the officers, killing three of them along with four carabinieri. Having quelled the rebellion with the help of departments of cavalry, mobile artillery and carabinieri, the General Staff decided on the decimation of the Brigade, as a warning for possible uprisings: 28 soldiers were thus shot, while the survivors were sent back to the front line under armed escort. The Duke of Aosta, commanding general of the Brigade, sought the causes of the rebellion in the period of prolonged service on the Karst Plateau and the unequal treatment with other brigades, which enjoyed easier rest shifts; of a different opinion was the report of General Tettoni, commander of VII Army Corps, who blamed the origin of the uprising on socialist propaganda among the troops and newspaper reports of the recent defeat in Russia.\nAfter the conclusion of the conflict with the armistice of Villa Giusti on November 3, 1918, the demobilization of the ex-combatants, mostly of peasant extraction, to whom, during the war, had been promised the allocation of land derived from the fractionation of large estates, began. The lack of political will in the implementation of this promise, together with creeping nationalistic tensions in the country due to the Fiume and Dalmatian question, generated in Italy a climate of resentment and social unrest, which turned into strikes, nationalistic anti-government demonstrations and occupations of uncultivated land by the peasants in revolt, often organized in leagues or federations of different political coloring. For these reasons, on Sept. 2, 1919, the Italian government, headed by Francesco Saverio Nitti, issued the Visocchi Decree (named after the Minister of Agriculture, Achille Visocchi), which gave prefects the power to temporarily assign uncultivated land for a period of four years to peasants formed in legally constituted leagues or agrarian bodies. A permit issued by a committee composed equally of peasant and landowner representatives, under prefectorial control, was required to obtain the land assignment, which also stipulated the duration of occupation and the rental price to be paid by the peasants to the landowner. However, seven months after the decree was passed, the land redistribution had very limited effects: it is estimated that only 27,000 hectares were allocated: many scholars have argued that the government measure was not intended to revive agricultural production, but rather to provide a pardon for the numerous occupations of uncultivated land by peasants. The Visocchi Decree was widely criticized by both conservatives and socialists: Arrigo Serpieri, later minister of agriculture in the Fascist period, judged the measure \u201cone of the most infamous of the postwar period\u201d, while socialist Filippo Turati deemed it too \u201ctimid\u201d.\nThe 1920 parliamentary elections saw the affirmation of nationalist candidates, elected thanks to the decisive support of ex-combatants (Saraceni himself would be beaten in his Castrovillari constituency in favor of the candidate supported by veterans from the front), while the Italian Socialist Party, while becoming the country's leading political force with as many as 156 deputies in Parliament, found itself internally divided between the maximalist current, advocating anti-bourgeois revolution, and the reformist current, in favor of dialogue with the government to push forward social reforms. This irreconcilable opposition led first to the expulsion of the reformists, such as Turati and Bissolati (who would go on to found the Unitary Socialist Party), then to the split that took place at the Livorno Congress in 1921, a fact that led to the birth of the Communist Party of Italy (which later evolved into the Italian Communist Party). In the same year the National Fascist Party was officially founded by Benito Mussolini, a former socialist expelled from the party for his interventionist positions on the eve of World War I, from an evolution of the earlier Fasci di Combattimento, founded in Milan in 1919 on the basis of an initially revolutionary and nationalist program. The aversion to socialism took concrete form in the assault by the fascist squads, the armed wing of the movement, on newspapers, cooperatives and party headquarters, whose exponents were truncheoned and forced to drink a strong purgative, castor oil. The squadrism was immediately financed by the large industrial groups and agrarians, fearful of a possible Bolshevik revolution in Italy, in the wake of the so-called \"biennio rosso\", and was often not countered by the police, who on more than one occasion sided with the fascists.\nIn Calabria, too, the actions of fascist squads left their mark: on September 21, 1922, in Casignana, a small town in Aspromonte, carabinieri and fascists opened fire on laborers from the \u201cGaribaldi\u201d agricultural cooperative, who had organized an occupation of land owned by the prince of Roccella, killing the socialist alderman Pasquale Micchia and two peasants, Rosario Conturno and Girolamo Panetta, while the mayor Francesco Ceravolo was seriously wounded; this massacre ended the occupation. Subsequently, on October 4, 1922, at the inauguration of the Casignana Fascio, which was also attended by Giuseppe Bottai, shots were fired, while a rifle shot wounded a fascist who was part of his entourage in the arm. In retaliation, the squadrists ravaged the house of the president of the \u201cGaribaldi\u201d cooperative, while the Carabinieri arrested a dozen antifascists. These events freely inspired writer Mario La Cava for his novel, The Facts of Casignana.\nThe penetration of fascism into Calabrian society was similar to that which took place in the rest of the country: in the city areas, the promoters of the fasces were the merchants and industrialists, who procured the support of the forces of law and order for the squadracce; in the rural areas, on the other hand, the backbone of fascism was represented by the large landowners and village notables, who decided to join the new party in order to weaken the \u201cred\u201d organizations and to maintain their socioeconomic position.\nAfter fascism came to power with the March on Rome on Oct. 28, 1922, the establishment of a centralized dictatorial regime began in the southern region as well, strengthened after the assassination of socialist deputy Giacomo Matteotti in 1924 and concretized with the \u201c\"Leggi fascistissime\"\u201d of 1925-1926, which outlawed political parties except for the fascist party, censored the press, and banned trade union organizations and strikes. In addition, administratively, the electivity of municipal mayors was abolished, replaced by podest\u00e0, appointed directly by the prefect, with absolute powers in the political and economic management of the municipality.\nDuring this period, the most representative Calabrian political personality was Michele Bianchi, a native of Belmonte Calabro, who was a close associate of Mussolini and quadrumviral of the 1922 March on Rome, in addition to holding the posts of deputy, undersecretary at the Ministry of the Interior and, finally, minister of Public Works. In this capacity, which he held until his death in 1930, he had a number of infrastructures built in Calabria, such as the Camigliatello Silano ski resort (initially called Camigliatello Bianchi), as well as promoting public works in Cosenza during the period when Tommaso Arnoni was mayor (1925-1934).\nIn December 1924 when a false rumor spread in Reggio Calabria that Benito Mussolini had resigned as Prime Minister because of the Matteotti affair, joyous celebrations took place in the city that lasted all night. In the morning, the people of Reggio Calabria learned that Mussolini was still prime minister, but several Fascist officials were dismissed for not suppressing the celebrations. The landed aristocracy and gentry of Calabria, through generally not ideologically committed to Fascism, saw the Fascist regime as a force for order and social stability, and supported the dictatorship. Likewise, the prefects and the policemen of Calabria were conservatives who saw themselves as serving King Victor Emmanuel III first and Mussolini second, but supported Fascism as preferable to Socialism and Communism and persecuted anti-Fascists. Traditional elites in Calabria joined the Fascist Party to pursue their own interests, and local branches of Fascist Party were characterized by much jostling for power and influence between elite families. \nIn spite of this, conditions in Calabria under the Fascist regime had not improved, as evidenced by the surveys conducted by meridionalists (and antifascists) Umberto Zanotti Bianco and Manlio Rossi Doria in 1928 and reported in the work \"Tra la perduta gente\", where they analyze the social and economic conditions of Africo, a small village in Aspromonte: nestled on houses ruined by the previous 1908 earthquake and geographically isolated, it was plagued by disease, high infant mortality and indiscriminate taxation, lacking a doctor and school (classes were held in the teacher's bedroom), while the inhabitants ate bread made from lentils and chickpeas.\nDespite the government's desire to maintain the \u201crural\u201d character of the country, with the introduction of restrictions and disincentives to peasants and laborers to move to the city, urban areas also experienced development, as demonstrated by the \"Grande Reggio\" project, that is, the idea of urban expansion and amalgamation strongly desired by the first Reggio podest\u00e0, Giuseppe Genoese Zerbi, who succeeded in obtaining the merger to the city on the Strait of as many as fourteen neighboring municipalities and suburbs, such as Catona, Gallico, Ort\u00ec, Pod\u00e0rgoni, Mosorrofa, Gallina, Pellaro, Cannitello, Villa San Giovanni, Campo Calabro, and Fiumara; the last four, by government decree of January 26, 1933, broke away to form the municipality of Villa San Giovanni (Campo Calabro and Fiumara became autonomous again after the war). The urban population thus exceeded 100,000. The reasons for this conurbation were many: there was a desire to speed up the post-earthquake reconstruction that the war had blocked, to make trade and communication by sea easier because of the city's expansion along the coast, and to entice emigration from small mountain towns into a single large urban center. Moreover, between the 1920s and 1930s Reggio Calabria was modernized with the construction of new neighborhoods: in fact, social housing districts sprang up and several public facilities such as the new Reggio di Calabria Centrale railway station, the National Museum of Magna Graecia and the Francesco Cilea Municipal Theater were built. Other cities also benefited from the building policy of the Fascist regime: in fact, through the work of Minister of Public Works Luigi Razza, the town of Monteleone di Calabria (renamed by royal decree Vibo Valentia, a name it still retains today), his place of origin, had a new municipal palace, inaugurated in 1935; after his death in the same year from a plane crash, his town paid tribute to him with a bronze statue, the work of sculptor Francesco Longo, inaugurated by the Duce himself in 1939. Vibo Valentia also named its military airport, stadium, a square and a street in the historic center after Luigi Razza.\nAs with the rest of Italy, Calabria's period of maximum support for fascism occurred with the Second Italo-Ethiopian War of 1935-1936, in which many Calabrians participated, thus providing momentary relief to the prevailing misery in the region with remittances from volunteers to their families. Many members of the Calabrian high clergy also supported the colonial war in Africa, marking the pinnacle of collaboration between Church and State in the aftermath of the Lateran Pacts of 1929: for example, the Archbishop of Reggio Calabria, Carmelo Pujia, already an interventionist on the eve of World War, had a prayer composed praising the glory of the homeland and the Italian flag.\nUnder the Fascist regime, several concentration camps were built in Calabria and used to imprison foreigners whose presence in Italy was considered undesirable, such as Chinese immigrants and foreign Jews (though not Italian Jews) together with members of the Romani minority, whose nomadic lifestyle was viewed as anti-social. The camps which operated from 1938 to 1943 were not death camps, and the majority of those imprisoned survived, but conditions were harsh for the imprisoned.\nOn June 10, 1940, with Italy's declaration of war on France and the United Kingdom, Calabria also found itself involved in the events of World War II: the civilian population suffered from the first period of the war from starvation and undernourishment, due to the lack of labor, low wages and the increase in basic necessities, which were already scarce and rationed, while other foodstuffs, such as meat and sugar, could only be found on the black market, at triple the price. This was also taken advantage of by the large landowners, who, taking advantage of the wartime period, ambushed part of the crops, which were destined for storage, later reselling them on the black market. Allied aerial bombardments also sapped the morale of civilians, sometimes even claiming some excellent victims: on January 31, 1943, the archbishop of Reggio Calabria, Enrico Montalbetti, was one of 11 people killed during an strafing run by an Allied fighter-bomber while Montalbetti was on a pastoral visit to Melito di Porto Salvo.\nOn 3 September 1943, British and Canadian troops of the Eighth Army landed in Calabria in Operation Baytown, marking the first time that the Allies landed on the mainland of Italy. However, the landings in Calabria were a feint and the main Allied blow came on 8 September 1943 with the landing of the American 5th Army at Salerno in Campania that was intended to cut off Axis forces in the \"Mezzogiorno\". The Germans anticipated that the Allies would land at Salerno, and as a consequence, there was relatively little fighting in Calabria. The Italian troops in Calabria mostly surrendered to the advancing British 5th Infantry Division and 1st Canadian Division while there were relatively few German forces in the region to oppose their advance. The main obstacle to the advancing Anglo-Canadian troops turned out to be the trail of destruction left by German combat engineers who systematically blew up bridges and destroyed roads and railroads as the Wehrmacht retreated north. On the same day the Americans landed at Salerno, General Dwight Eisenhower announced on the radio the Armistice of Cassibile that had been signed on 3 September, and with the announcement of the armistice all Italian resistance ceased.\u00a0The Germans committed most of their forces in the \"Mezzogiorno\" to the Battle of Salerno with the aim of driving the Allies back into the sea and pulled their remaining forces out of Calabria to send them to Salerno. Under the Allied occupation, some Fascists in Calabria waged a terrorist struggle on behalf of the Salo republic, though significantly many of the Fascists tended to be from well-off families concerned about the possibility of social reforms that might weaken their power and only a minority such as Prince Valerio Pignatelli were ideological Fascists. In June 1944, celebrations in Reggio Calabria over the news of the liberation of Rome were disturbed by local Fascists. \nCalabria liberated by the Allied troops was marked by a high economic depression, caused by an extremely backward agricultural sector, an industry in its \u201cinfantile state,\u201d sparsely spread and crippled by the long and catastrophic conflict (the power plants in Sila were safe even if \u201cthe mass of electricity is partly transported elsewhere\u201d as in the Fascist period), civil infrastructures, such as roads and aqueducts in themselves shoddy and insufficient, which had always connoted the backward degree of development and now appeared even more reduced and precarious due to the war outcomes. And finally, to seal the disaster, a territory completely disjointed by the violence anyway suffered, far from the front and yet battered first by Allied bombs and then by the destruction of the retreating Germans. The Allies themselves, faced with the gravity of the situation and general disorientation, were perplexed about the possibility of recovery. In a report to General Harold Alexander, the head of Civil Affairs of the Allied military government, the English Major General Francis Rennell Rodd, even fearing a resurgence of brigandage, manifested how difficult it was to \u201cgovern a discouraged and apathetic population,\u201d with an \u201cincompetent bureaucracy\u201d. This misery spurred masses of the dispossessed into action, exacerbating social tensions and leading, with revolutionary effect, to the ultimate crisis of late-feudalism formed by reactionary classes clinging to parasitic rents that kept the land imprisoned and blocked its development.\nThe Allied military government worked to restart political and administrative life without, however, changing the scaffolding of the Fascist state. The crowds in front of town halls perhaps demanded only a \u201cbureaucratic rip-off\u201d of the bread card, a food support. The demonstrations, however, showed increasingly sharp and marked political thrusts. Increasingly they were led by communist and socialist agitators and expressed anti-fascist motives. Many times these demonstrations degraded into full-fledged riots, becoming violent and resulting in the deaths of several people. The first uprising in Calabria occurred on the morning of September 9 in Limbadi, which quickly turned the newly liberated town into a battlefield, but without causing any deaths. Like a wave, many of the towns liberated by Allied forces revolted against their mayors and municipal secretaries. The best known is the November 4 insurrection in Cosenza, initially motivated by hunger and the housing crisis, which quickly turned into a political struggle to remove the Fascist mayor Enrico Hendrich, who was ousted by popular vote.\nThe fall of fascism and the entry of Allied troops into Calabria also allowed the rebirth of a critical and conscious public opinion in the region, thanks in part to the coming out of hiding of the anti-fascist parties, such as the Italian Socialist Party, the Italian Communist Party and the Christian Democracy, a Catholic-inspired political organization founded in 1942 in semi-clandestinity and heir to Don Luigi Sturzo's Italian People's Party, each with its own newspapers and political headquarters.\nAll this had an impact on the socioeconomic conditions in the areas of Italy liberated by the Allied troops: the peasant masses, which made up about 60 percent of the Italian population, began, while still fighting the Nazi-Fascists in the center-north of the peninsula, to stage a series of violent uprisings in protest against their miserable living conditions and to demand the division of large land holdings, often giving way to large-scale occupations of uncultivated land, as had already happened after World War I. The peasant class reclaiming its rights was countered by the elite of agrarians and large landowners, who, at first staunch supporters of fascism, sought with the Allied advance to realign themselves according to the political dictates of the moment in order to maintain their economic and social privileges.\nTo cope with this social situation, in July 1944, a month after the liberation of Rome and the handover between Victor Emmanuel III of Savoy and his son Umberto II of Savoy, who obtained the Lieutenancy of the Kingdom, Calabrian Communist Fausto Gullo, formerly minister of Agriculture in the second Badoglio government and holder of the same department also in subsequent executives (second Bonomi government, third Bonomi government and Parri government), proposed a series of decrees (named after him) to improve the condition of the peasant class. Among the noteworthy decrees were: the reform of sharecropping, which was changed from annual to biennial; the granting of uncultivated land to individual peasants who had joined in agricultural cooperatives; compensation to farmers who took their produce to storage, which had previously been diverted to the black exchange; and the prohibition of the figure of the caporale, i.e., the day laborer recruiter. With these decrees, defined by historian Paul Ginsborg as \u201cthe only attempt made by leftist government officials to advance on the path of reform\u201d, Gullo, who became the \u201cMinister of the Peasants\u201d, achieved two important results: the southern peasants' awareness of the state's non-stranger status to their problems and the realization by the laborers of their own strength if they acted united in cooperatives, in which all worked for the common goal. Thanks in part to cooperation with the trade unions, especially Giuseppe Di Vittorio's Italian General Confederation of Labour, Gullo's reform efforts were revived with two other decrees, concerning the taxable labor rate and placement lists: with the former, the trade unions were empowered to dictate the number of laborers who were to work a landowner's farmland, while with the latter, trade unionists could manage the placement of the men needed for laboring on the basis of seniority. With these measures they were at least able to avoid the war between the poor and make the union feel on the side of the peasants.\nThe provisions envisaged by the Gullo decrees were opposed by the agrarians, either by using the organized underworld or by enlisting the support of the more conservative currents of the Christian Democrats, who were frightened by the revolutionary repercussions of the government measures. Indeed, local Christian Democrats, often notables involved with the past regime, succeeded in getting the decrees amended with provisions that effectively made them unenforceable: in fact, agricultural cooperatives received uncultivated land from a special provincial commission, composed of the president of the Court of Appeals, a representative of the agrarians and one of the peasants, which often and willingly issued resolutions very favorable to the landowners; at other times, some decrees were declared illegal, such as the one on compensation to peasants, thanks in part to the submissiveness of the national Communist leadership, which did not want to radicalize the social clash so as not to invalidate the government alliance with the Christian Democrats.\nThe Communists thought of supporting revolutionary attempts that had their own origins in these social and economic demands, following instead the strategy of Secretary Palmiro Togliatti, who preferred a slow transaction toward democracy together with Christian Democrat leader Alcide De Gasperi to revolution. This was the case of the Red Republic of Caulonia, proclaimed on March 6, 1945, by Pasquale Cavallaro, mayor of Caulonia, a town where the clash between agrarians and laborers had been increasingly bitter since January 1944, when he had been appointed to the post by the prefect of Reggio Calabria, despite his communist faith, in place of Pasquale Saverio Asciutti, who was strongly colluding with fascism. In order to maintain public order, Mayor Cavallaro had empowered members of the local partisan section, commanded by his son Ercole Cavallaro, to go around armed with police and search duties. Not infrequently these searches ended in violence against the most prominent members of fascism and the agrarian class. During one such operation against two landowners, Ercole, with two comrades, was arrested by the Carabinieri on charges of theft. The mayor immediately did his utmost to obtain his son's release, causing the outbreak of the revolt: on March 5, 1945, Cavallaro's loyalists freed Ercole, closed the access roads to Caulonia, occupied the post office, the telegraph office and the Carabinieri barracks, while the following day, they hoisted the red flag with hammer and sickle on the bell tower, proclaiming the Republic. The Communist Party was immediately made aware of the event by telegram. Each had differentiated tasks: the partisan section took care of the armed defense of the territory, the women assisted the men with provisions, and the communist members had to keep in touch with the party federation. The revolutionaries also established a \u201cPeople's Tribunal,\u201d which was based in the town square and had the power to try \u201cenemies of the people,\u201d while an internment camp was also set up where many local agrarians and notables were locked up. The revolutionary experience worried both the conservatives and the communist leaders themselves, who pressed Cavallaro to calm tempers and end the flaring revolution: the mayor then became spokesman for the rebels and convinced almost all of them to return home and lay down their arms, although the most diehard refused to surrender and went into hiding. Finally, on March 9, 1945, after only three days, everything came to an end: the prefect of Reggio Calabria sent departments of carabinieri and police to Caulonia, who arrested 365 men, who were referred to the Locri court for constitution of an armed gang, murder, violence to private individuals and usurpation of public office, while on April 15, 1945 Cavallaro resigned as mayor.\nThe British historian Jonathan Dunnage wrote that there was an \"institutional continuity\" between the civil servants of the Liberal, Fascist and post-Fascist eras in Calabria as each change of regime saw the bureaucrats of the region adjust to whatever regime was in power in Rome and there was no purge of civil servants either after 1922 or 1943. The \"institutional continuity\" of the bureaucracy of Calabria were committed to preserving the social structure. On 2 June 1946 referendum Calabria, like the rest of the \"Mezzogiorno\", voted solidly to retain the monarchy. The clientistic political system in Calabria under which elite families handed out patronage to their supporters and used violence against their opponents, which was the prevailing norm in the Liberal and Fascist eras continued after 1945. During the Second World War, the already low living standards of Calabria declined further and the region was notorious as one of the most violent and lawless areas of Italy. \nAttempts by the peasants of Calabria to take over the land owned by the elite were usually resisted by the authorities. On 28 October 1949 in Melissa the police opened fire on peasants who had seized the land of a local baron, killing three men who were shot in the back as they attempted to flee. Between 1949 and 1966 another wave of migration took place with the peak year of migration being 1957 with some 38, 090 Calabrians leaving that year.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\nAfter the birth of the Italian Republic, the southern monarchist Enrico De Nicola became the provisional head of state, while De Gasperi regained the task of forming the government, becoming, with the entry into office on July 12, 1946 of the second De Gasperi government, the first Prime Minister of the Italian Republic. In the governmental structure, which still rested on the agreement between the major anti-fascist parties, the left-wing parties were strongly downsized in favor of the Christian Democrats, in view of the opposition between the two blocs (Western and Communist) typical of the Cold War. The Communists and Socialists went from 8 to 6 ministries, whose holders were chosen from among the Christian Democrats: as a result Mario Scelba, a Sicilian Christian Democrat, became Minister of the Interior, the Communist Emilio Sereni was Minister of Public Works, while Gullo, who had presided over the Agriculture ministry since 1943, was appointed Minister of Justice; in his place was the Christian Democrat Antonio Segni, a Sardinian landowner and future President of the Italian Republic, an exponent of the more conservative faction of the Christian Democracy.\nSegni's appointment as Minister of Agriculture seemed to halt the agrarian reform drive that Gullo had imparted, especially in the South: the new minister, coming to meet the demands of the agrarian class, between September 1946 and December 1947 issued two decrees that allowed landowners to reclaim those lands that had not been improved or cultivated by peasants. While this secured the support of the southern elites for the Christian Democrat party on the one hand, enabling it to win the April 18, 1948 general elections, it only increased the tension between the two parties and restarted the occupation of uncultivated land by the laborers. The Massacre of Melissa, which took place in Calabria in the fall of 1949, fits into this context: on October 24 of that year, some 14,000 Calabrian peasants from the provinces of Catanzaro and Cosenza descended from their villages, accompanied also by women, children and work animals, to head for the large latifundia, occupy them and begin planting work. A group of Calabrian Christian Democracy parliamentarians from the agrarian class went to Rome, protesting and asking Interior Minister Mario Scelba to use force against the demonstrators. Scelba then sent units of the Mobile Units, mechanized riot police, to Calabria, which stopped at Melissa, in the province of Crotone, where there was a large number of protesters, camped out on the Fragal\u00e0 estate, owned by local landowner Baron Luigi Berlingeri. The fund, in fact, according to the subversion of feudality and the Napoleonic laws of 1811 was supposed to be assigned to the municipality, but the Berlingeri family had usurped it in its entirety over the years: now the peasants claimed at least half of it as municipal property, but the baron, as a sign of accommodation, was willing to cede only a third, resulting in a clear refusal. So it was that, on Oct. 29, 1949, police, after intimidating the crowd of peasants to clear out, fired at eye level, resulting in 15 wounded and 3 dead: 15-year-old Giovanni Zito, 29-year-old Francesco Nigro, and 23-year-old Angelina Mauro, who died later in the hospital.\nThis massacre, combined with that of Portella della Ginestra, in Sicily, which took place on May 1, 1947, provoked a series of strikes and peasant demonstrations throughout Italy, repressed by the police. The continuing state of unrest, however, induced De Gasperi to pass the first agrarian reform measures, which, however, did not result in an overall reform, but in individual laws valid for specific territories: therefore, on May 12, 1950, the Sila Law was passed, which initially concerned the territory located in the eastern Sila, and provided for the expropriation of latifundia exceeding 300 hectares, lacking improvements or reclamation. These two clauses provided a legal loophole for the agrarians who did not want to lose their estates, as they could subdivide the latifundia among relatives or plant temporary improvements on them. In addition to this, the geographical area to be expropriated was predominantly mountainous and forested, and therefore unsuitable for cultivation. A real agrarian law valid for the whole country, partly financed by funds from the Marshall Plan, was passed on October 21, 1950, with most of the conservative Christian Democracy current abstaining or voting against, supported also by conservative members of Harry Truman's administration. The reform, which according to some scholars was the most important of the entire post-World War II period, proposed, through forced expropriation, the redistribution of land to farmworkers, thus making them de facto small businessmen no longer subject to the large landowner. While this was a beneficial result, it also greatly reduced the size of farms, thus removing any possibility of transforming them into advanced entrepreneurial vehicles. However, this negative element was mitigated and in some cases eliminated by forms of cooperation: in fact, agricultural cooperatives arose which, by scheduling production and centralizing the sale of products, gave agriculture the entrepreneurial character that had been lost with the division of land. Thus there was a better yield of crops, which from extensive became intensive and thus a better exploitation of the land used. Agricultural labor, which until then had been unprofitable though very heavy, began to bear fruit. However, as a result of the development of industry, agriculture ended up becoming a marginal sector of the economy, but as a result of the development of modern cultivation techniques, it saw the income produced per hectare cultivated and thus the profitability of labor multiply.\nIn addition to this, the fourth De Gasperi government had established by Law No. 646 of August 10, 1950, the Cassa per il Mezzogiorno, a public body created for the purpose of financing the infrastructural and industrial development of southern Italy in order to bridge the economic gap with the rest of the country, originally over a 10-year period (until 1960), although the Cassa was refinanced with public funds until its total liquidation by law in 1992. One of the planning instruments used for the finalization of interventions was the A.S.I. plan, or a plan for the creation of Industrial Development Areas: it provided for the establishment of consortia, carried out under Law No. 634 of July 29, 1957 (called \u201cProvvedimenti per il Mezzogiorno\u201d), in the type of sectoral plan, promoted by entities such as municipalities, provinces and chambers of commerce for the initiation of industrial development and the construction of basic infrastructure in the areas involved in the action of the Cassa per il Mezzogiorno.\nThe outcome of the Cassa was by no means questionable in terms of the use of public capital, considering the backwardness of southern Italy in 1950 compared to the rest of the country in terms of infrastructure resources and per capita income: in Calabria, for example, important works were the doubling of 212 km of the Battipaglia-Reggio Calabria railway line (completed in 1965). However, subsequently the politicization of the agency's apparatuses led to a degradation and low quality of public spending, including widespread phenomena of illegality (such as financing entrepreneurs through contracts in order to develop enterprises in the Mezzogiorno, which later turned out to be \u201cghost\u201d companies). Therefore, often huge procurements and other state initiatives ended up creating huge infrastructures that would not find practical application, either because they were alien to the economic realities of the South, or because they remained unfinished: therefore, this type of infrastructure was referred to as a cathedral in the desert.\nThe 1950s and 1960s were known as the period of the \u201ceconomic miracle\u201d: a short but intense period of time characterized by industrial development, economic growth, and an increase in consumption. It was during that period that Italian industry, thanks to the modernization of its industrial apparatus, achieved through the purchase and use of American technological skills and equipment financed by the Marshall Plan, achieved a remarkable rate of growth in production, so much so that in one decade it increased by up to 10 percent, leading to the economic and social transformation of Italy, which was transforming from a predominantly agricultural country into an industrial one. Those who benefited most were the large industrial complexes in northern Italy, which obtained most of the U.S. funding, while small and medium-sized enterprises, although they could not count on programmed interventions, also managed to emerge, thanks to their flexibility and ability to adapt to the market. In addition, the construction of roads and highways made the movement of people and goods faster, favored the production and employment of vehicles the various employment sectors, and profoundly affected the lifestyle of the population.\nGrowth and prosperity, however, did not spread evenly across the country, and did not affect all social strata and all productive sectors of the economy. We need only think of the crisis in the agricultural sector, which led to the substantial failure of the 1950 land reform in many parts of the South, due to the exponential growth of the role of industry in the Italian economy; in fact, between 1951 and 1991, workers employed in agriculture fell from 8,261,000 to 1,629,000, and in particular, those employed in the sector under 30 years of age plummeted from 3,299,000 in 1951 to 341,000 in 1991. However, this was also due to the process of mechanization of agriculture, which between 1954 and 1964 produced a contraction of the agricultural labor force in rural areas (from 8 million to 5 million).\nSuch was the situation in Calabria, where there had also been an increase in population in a land that offered no employment outlets or opportunities for survival, a factor that fostered a strong emigration of labor from the region after the forced blockade during the years of the fascist regime. The causes of the increased flow of migration were many and stemmed from numerous shortcomings: the unstable hydrogeology of the land, the lack of infrastructure works, the inclemency of the climate and, above all, the very high unemployment and underemployment prevailing in the Calabrian labor scene. The Parliamentary Commission for the Study of Misery certified this state of affairs: in fact, the inquiry showed that 179,500 Calabrians (37.7 percent of the region's total population) lived in a state of misery. It was the highest percentage in the entire country, compared to 1.5 percent in the North, 5.9 percent in the Center and the Mezzogiorno itself, where the percentage of misery was around 28.3 percent.\nIn the decade between 1951 and 1961 as many as 400,000 Calabrians emigrated to seek their fortune elsewhere, especially to America (such as Canada or the United States) or to the industrial cities of Northern Italy, especially those concentrated in the industrial triangle, which saw their population increase considerably, especially Turin (+42.6 percent) and Milan (+24.1 percent). In addition to this outward trend, Calabrian emigration also had an interregional one, that is, of people moving from inland areas, often mountainous and hilly, to settle in coastal centers, which were better connected and closer to the main arteries of communication, where there were more job opportunities in construction, urban services and commercial activities. This resulted in the complete abandonment of inland rural areas, with hydrogeological effects that are still felt today, while the ancient mountain and hillside villages lost autonomy and identity, falling into an irreversible crisis. One example is the ancient medieval village of Badolato Superiore, near Soverato, which has become, according to anthropologist Vito Teti, the \u201cmetaphor of the abandonment, ruin, flight, and hope of all of Calabria, of the entire Mezzogiorno\u201d.\nUnder the First Republic, starting in the 1960s, investment plans were launched under which Italian state sponsored industrialisation and attempted to improve the infrastructure of Calabria by building modern roads, railroads, ports, etc. The plan was a notable failure with the infrastructure projects going wildly over-budget and taking far longer to complete then scheduled; for an example, construction started on the A3 highway in 1964 intended to link Reggio Calabria to Salerno, which was as of 2016 still unfinished. The failure to complete the A3 highway after 52 years of effort is regarded as a scandal in Italy, and many parts of Calabria were described as an \"industrial graveyard\" full of the closed down steel mills and chemical plants that all went bankrupt. \nThe Calabrian political landscape of that period was marked by the debate on the establishment of the regional entity and the choice of the capital, due not only to terms of prestige, but also to concrete job opportunities in the public and clerical sectors in a part of the peninsula where labor shortages and emigration were on the rise. Local Calabrian contrasts and rivalries were also reflected at the national level, when, in 1963, in the first Moro government, ministers and undersecretaries from Reggio Calabria and Catanzaro were excluded from the executive: the only Calabrians with institutional appointments were the Socialist Giacomo Mancini (who became Minister of Health) and the Christian Democrat Riccardo Misasi (holder of the Ministry of Grace and Justice), both originally from Cosenza. In addition, economically there were also numerous frictions between Cosenza, Catanzaro and Reggio Calabria, among other demographically diverse areas. On March 21, 1968, the Reggio Calabria City Council, which was considering the law establishing the region, voted on an agenda declaring that the city on the Strait should be the regional capital. Thus, to preserve city interests, the \u201cAgitation Committee for the Defense of Reggio's Interests,\u201d headed by Christian Democrat lawyer Francesco Gangemi, was born. However, the law establishing the Regions, which came into effect in 1970, confirmed the 1949 decision by which the parliamentary investigation committee appointed by the House Institutional Affairs Committee, with the delivery of the report called \u201cDonatini-Molinaroli,\u201d determined that, based on historical and geopolitical parameters, Catanzaro was the capital of the Calabria Region.\nThis situation, which reverberated in the local and regional elections, in which the minor secular leftist parties (social democrats and republicans) elected their first representatives, mainly in the provinces of Reggio and Cosenza, induced the city's mayor, Christian Democrat Pietro Battaglia, to give, on July 5, 1970, a heartfelt speech in Piazza Duomo in front of 7,000 people, to claim the city's just right to be the regional capital. On July 12, the prodrome of the uprising began in the city, with the creation of the first roadblocks and numerous public demonstrations, while, on the same day, in Villa San Giovanni, Senate President Amintore Fanfani, who had come to the city to collect an award, was harshly challenged by the crowd. In retaliation to Fanfani's indifference, the regional deputies from Reggio Calabria (5 Christian Democrats and 1 Socialist), deserted the regional council meeting scheduled for July 13, as opposed to the Communist representatives, who went instead.\nFinally, on July 14, 1970, the actual uprising, which went down in history as the Reggio revolt, broke out, supported by all of the city's social classes (bourgeoisie, clergy, students, political parties, civic committees). On that day there were clashes between the demonstrators and the forces of law and order, which left one person dead, railroad worker Bruno Labate: this prompted the Archbishop of Reggio, Vincenzo Ferro, in September to join the showdown. The uprising was also supported by newspapers of liberal-conservative tendency (such as the Gazzetta del Sud and Il Tempo), and by various intellectuals, who asserted the city's political and social claims. Gradually the leadership of the protests passed from Mayor Battaglia, who did not want to go too far, to the far-right movements, particularly the Movimento Sociale Italiano, seen as the least compromised with the republican regime; soon the Missini imposed their authority on the uprising, including through various slogans (famous was the \"boia chi molla\" of D'Annunzian memory). Ciccio Franco, a CISNAL trade unionist and Reggio Calabria-based Missini exponent, emerged as the undisputed leader of the situation. At this point barricades were erected, the railway station was occupied and all convoys and ferries leaving for Sicily were blocked. In the first months of the uprising, moreover, there were 19 days of general strike, 12 bomb attacks, 32 roadblocks, 14 occupations of the station, 2 of the post office, 1 of the television station, and 4 assaults on the prefecture, with a death toll of 5 (in addition to Labate, Angelo Campanella, a driver for the city's municipal bus company, also perished in the clashes, Vincenzo Curigliano, a policeman struck by a heart attack during an assault on the Questura; Antonio Bellotti, a 19-year-old officer hit by a stone while leaving Reggio by train with his department; and Carmelo Jaconis, a bartender killed by a gunshot), 426 arrested and 200 wounded during the police charges (whose members were insulted and vilified even by hospital doctors). Even, in some parts of the city, \u201cautonomous republics\u201d were proclaimed, such as the \u201cRepublic of Sbarre\u201d and the \u201cGrand Duchy of St. Catherine,\u201d a clear symptom of the prevailing anti-statism among the protesters. The Italian government, presided over by Emilio Colombo after the resignation of Mariano Rumor, after appealing to the people of Reggio Emilia urging them to appease, threatening, in the event of a continuation of the violence, the use of force, decided, for the first time in the history of the Italian Republic, to repress the street demonstrations and urban guerrilla warfare by having the army and carabinieri intervene. Even far-left parties, such as the Communists and the PSIUP, condemned the Reggio uprising, branding it as parochial and non-proletarian, often clashing with their own city voter base. Eventually, on February 23, 1971, after 10 months of rioting and agitation, the revolt ceased: the people of Reggio had to come to a political compromise with the government, which occurred, however, not in Parliament but in the regional council, where they had little political clout. The Prime Minister, meeting with the president of the Calabria Region, Christian Democrat Antonio Guarasci, and various regional politicians from various parties, worked out a compromise agreement, known as the Colombo Package, which sought to bring all parties together: Catanzaro would be the regional capital, while Reggio would host the seat of the regional council; Cosenza, on the other hand, would be the site of Calabria's first university hub (today's University of Calabria), while Gioia Tauro would be the fifth national steel hub and a massive chemical factory would be established in Saline Joniche. The agreement was accepted by the city's population, but the Gioia Tauro steel plant was never built, due to the international steel market crisis, while the Saline Joniche chemical plant, although built, ceased production almost immediately due to the Ministry of Health's provision that had declared the chemical feed supplements it produced to be carcinogenic.\nThe consequences of the Reggio uprising were reflected in electoral performance, when in the 1972 general elections the needle of the scales shifted in favor of the extreme right, which won 27 percent of the vote and became the leading party in the city, outperforming other political formations and electing Ciccio Franco to the Senate. In October of the same year, a two-day demonstration was organized in Reggio by some 40,000 northern metalworkers who were members of the CGIL, in solidarity with the inhabitants' reasons for revolt: the reactions of the latter were diverse, as some welcomed the gesture, while others ignored or opposed it, a sign of the distance between the southern and northern socioeconomic realities.\nThe Reggio revolt remain to this day one of the most controversial pages in the history of Calabria and even Italy, partly because of the lack or absence of related documentation, which is often destroyed or secreted. In order to understand this historical episode, one must refer to historiography, which denies or approves of certain views: it was not a parochial uprising, but complex political and social motivations converged behind it; it was not a fascist uprising, although the Italian Social Movement was at the head of it, as the leftists (especially the communists) said, since it was an interclass, inter-party and intergenerational movement, while it was instead an anti-state uprising (see the case of the \u201cautonomous republics\u201d), spontaneous and without direction behind it, despite Mayor Battaglia's call to strike. In addition to this, recent studies have found that there were also strong infiltrations of the 'ndrangheta, colluding with the extremist subversive right (see the case of the Baracca anarchists), in the uprising; therefore, there are those who believe that deviated sectors of the state and secret services were also involved in the uprising, so much so that the Reggio revolt can be ascribed to a part of the strategy of tension that gripped the country in those years.\nIn the 1980s, the social and economic situation in Calabria was anything but prosperous: as Piero Gagliardo, a professor at the University of Calabria, wrote, the region had no development plan of its own, was apparently abandoned to the various party clienteles, but was effectively run by power groups linked to organized crime and deviant freemasonry. As a result, in Calabria, which is made to play the role of the poorest and most depressed region in Italy, social and economic initiatives, even very significant ones, are undertaken with exasperating slowness, and often based on a human and territorial fabric that is not always suitable for receiving them. In fact, in the region, many works, including those of significant public expenditure, had been initiated, but more for the benefit of the entrepreneurial hundred in the center than for the real needs of the periphery. In addition to this socioeconomic analysis, Gagliardo notes the persistence of widespread electoral clientelism, which the electoral political class, instead of eliminating, wanted to nurture for its own personal gain.\nAlongside this political, cultural and economic landscape, there was the gradual infiltration into the Calabrian social and economic fabric of the 'Ndrangheta, a criminal organization akin to the Mafia and Camorra, which began to make headlines thanks to the season of kidnappings of important hostages in order to demand a ransom to finance their criminal activities (such as the one of John Paul Getty III, grandson of an U.S. oilman, kidnapped in 1973 and released along the Autostrada A2 after the payment of a ransom of one billion seven hundred million lire). In the 1980s, the Calabrian 'ndrine turned instead to international narcotics trafficking, forging contacts with South American drug cartels and enacting numerous internal feuds among the various Mafia clans for control of territory and drug areas. As in Sicily, the 'ndrangheta in Calabria infiltrated into the local political fabric, not infrequently placing its own affiliates in key posts in municipal administrations in order to pilot and profit on public contracts. The case of the Gioia Tauro harbor, completed in 1985, which was conceived as a trading port for the never-planned steel center envisaged by the Colombo Package, and later used as a transit hub for containers transported by transoceanic ships plying the Mediterranean Sea, is well known: from the outset, the port facility was under the control of the Piromalli and Mol\u00e8 clans, who used it to bring drugs and counterfeit goods into Italy. In the 1990s, in order to quell the criminal phenomenon, which was flanking the Mafia in its massacre phase against men of the state (an act that materialized in the 1991 murder of Judge Antonino Scopelliti, who was working on the Palermo Maxi Trial), Operation Riace was implemented, where the army was employed, with a total of 1350 military personnel, while numerous maxiprocesses were subsequently carried out: \u201cWall Street,\u201d \u2018Count Down,\u2019 \u2018Hoca Tuca,\u2019 \u2018North-South,\u2019 \u2018Belgium,\u2019 and \u2018Fine,\u2019 which involved many 'ndrine and the end of the Siderno Group, an underworld consortium between Canada and Calabria that ran international drug trafficking.\nYet, in the last years of the 20th century there have been some changes, partly due to volunteerism and to an awareness of a large part of the Calabrian people, increasingly participating in public affairs. One example is the election on November 28, 1993, of Italo Falcomat\u00e0 as mayor of Reggio Calabria, who was reconfirmed for three terms until his untimely death on December 11, 2001. Falcomat\u00e0, at the head of a center-left junta, was the protagonist of the so-called \u201cSpringtime of Reggio,\u201d or a period in which the first citizen spurred his fellow citizens to re-enamor themselves with the city, after years of torpor in public participation and social apathy. During his tenure, he succeeded in unlocking funds from the \u201cReggio Decree\u201d that had been awaited for years for the redevelopment and development of the city on the Strait, while he tenaciously fought against illegal construction and downsized the open market, which, with its street stalls run by organized crime expanded without limits and permits and congested traffic.\nEconomy.\nThe Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Calabria is subdivided as follows: service industry (28.94%), financial activities and real estate (21.09%), trade, tourism, transportation and communication (19.39%), taxation (11.49%), manufacturing (8.77%), construction (6.19%) and agriculture (4.13%). GDP per capita is 2.34 times less and unemployment is 4 times higher than in Lombardy. Calabria's economy is still based mainly on agriculture.\nThe economy of the region is strongly affected by the presence of the 'Ndrangheta (the local Mafia syndicate).\nAgriculture.\nCalabria is agriculturally rich, with the Italy's second highest number of organic farmers after Sicily.\nThe red onion of Tropea is cultivated during summer period on the Tyrrhenian coast of central Calabria. It has been awarded with the protected geographical indication (PGI).\nThe olive tree represents 29.6% of utilized agricultural area (UAA) and approximately 70% of tree crops. Olive tree cultivation extends from coastal lowland areas to hilly and lower mountainous areas.\nThe region is the second-highest for olive oil production with Carolea, Ogliarola, and Saracena olives as the main regional varieties.\nIn Calabria, there are 3 PDO oils: \"Bruzio\" in the province of Cosenza, \"Lametia\" in the area of Lamezia Terme and the more recent \"Alto Crotonese\". In addition to DOP oils there are also PGI oils. The production area of \"Olio di Calabria\" PGI includes the entire territory of the Calabria region. The production is made exclusively from indigenous olives.\nCalabria produces about a quarter of Italy's citrus fruit. The contribution of this region to growing citrus fruit in Italy can be attributed mainly to clementines, oranges, mandarins and lemons. Calabria is by far the country's most important clementine-growing region, which account for about 62% (16,164 ha) of the Italian surface dedicated to its cultivation and 69% (437,800 tons) of the total production. Clementina di Calabria is the PGI variety grown in the Calabria region. Also chinotto is cultivated and used to produce carbonated soft drink with the same name.\nMinor fruits such as bergamot and citron and lemon-citron hybrids are found exclusively in Calabria. The south coast of the region produces 90% of the world's bergamots, with a huge industry built around the extraction of bergamot oil. According to Harvard Atlas of Economic Complexity, last year with Italian net export of bergamot oil was 2009 in value of $253,000, after that between 2010 and 2018 was no export of it. The Bergamot orange has been intensively cultivated since the 18th century, but only in the coastal area nearby to Reggio, where geological and weather conditions are optimal. The Chabad Hasidic dynasty have a preference to take citrons (\"Etrog\") from this region for the Sukkot festival.\nThere is special research Experimental Station for the Industry of the Essential oils and Citrus products in Reggio di Calabria.\nThe province of Cosenza represents an important area for figs growing belonging to cultivar \"Dottato\" that is used to produce the quality-branded dried figs \"Fichi di Cosenza\" PDO (protected designation of origin). The anona cherimoya, a plant of tropical origin cultivated in Europe only in Reggio di Calabria and Spain.\nIn the province of Catanzaro, between San Floro and Cortale, the ancient tradition of sericulture is still kept alive, thanks to young generations.\nCalabria is the largest producer of porcini mushrooms in Italy, thanks to the heavily wooded forests of the mountains ranges of Pollino, Sila, Serre and Aspromonte. In addition to porcini mushrooms, red pine mushrooms (rositio) are also produced. Chestnut production is also widespread in the Calabrian mountains.\nPeaches and nectarines from Calabria have greatly improved in terms of flavour, quality, safety and service. A part of the production is sold on the domestic market, mainly to retailers. The remaining is exported to Northern Europe, mainly Scandinavia and Germany.\nThe region boasts a very ancient tradition in the cultivation and production of liquorice. The eighty percent of the national production is concentrated in this region.\nCalabria has long coast and produce some distinctive fish products:\nManufacturing.\nFood and textile industries are the most developed and vibrant. Within the industrial sector, manufacturing contributes to a gross value added of 7.2%. In the manufacturing sector the main branches are foodstuff, beverage and tobacco with a contribution to the sector very close to the national average.\nOver the recent decades some petrochemical, engineering and chemical industries have emerged, within the areas of Crotone, Vibo Valentia and Reggio Calabria.\nThe province of Catanzaro boasts a great tradition in the textile manufacturing, especially silk. Recently, several young people have given new life to this activity, developing green and sustainable economy projects. In fact, among the municipalities of Girifalco, San Floro and Cortale, sericulture is still practiced, the breeding of silkworms combined with the cultivation of mulberry trees.\nTiriolo and Badolato are known above all for the manufacturing of the \"vancale\", the typical Calabrian shawl, made of wool or silk, worn by women in ancient times on traditional costumes during the dance of tarantella, or as an ornamental decoration of the houses.\nTypical in Tiriolo is also the manufacturing of carpets, linen and broom fibers, bobbin lace making, embroidery, precious ceramics, furnishing objects and artistic sculptures. The artistic production of weaving is also active in other centers such as in Platania and Petrizzi where once hemp fibers were also produced.\nIn Soveria Mannelli, Lanificio Leo, the oldest textile factory in Calabria founded in 1873, is still active. The factory still retains majestic and evocative tools dating back to the late nineteenth century.\nThe traditional production of artistic ceramics dating back to the Magna Graecia period is handed down in the ancient towns of Squillace and Seminara.\nThe small town of Serrastretta, a green village in the woods of Presila, is known for its wood production, in particular for its chairs characterized by a very original straw.\nThere is a plant of Hitachi Rail Italy in Reggio di Calabria, which manufactures railcars of regional trains such as .\nTourism.\nTourism in Calabria has increased over the years. The main tourist attractions are the coastline and the mountains. The coastline alternates between rugged cliffs and sandy beaches, and is sparsely interrupted by development when compared to other European seaside destinations. The sea around Calabria is clear, and there is a good level of tourist accommodation. The poet Gabriele D'Annunzio called the coast facing Sicily near Reggio Calabria \"... the most beautiful kilometer in Italy\" (\"il pi\u00f9 bel chilometro d'Italia\"). The primary mountain tourist draws are Aspromonte and La Sila, with its national park and lakes. Some other prominent destinations include:\nCalabria attracts year-round tourism, offering both summer and winter activities, in addition to its cultural, historical, artistic heritage, it has an abundance of protected natural habitats and 'green' zones. The of its coast make Calabria a tourist destination during the summer. The low industrial development and the lack of major cities in much of its territory have allowed the maintenance of indigenous marine life.\nThe most sought-after seaside destinations are: Tropea, Pizzo Calabro, Capo Vaticano, Reggio Calabria, Soverato, Scilla, Scalea, Sellia Marina, Montepaone, Montauro, Copanello (\"comune\" of Staletti), Tonnara di Palmi, Diamante, Paola, Fiumefreddo Bruzio, Amantea, Praia a Mare, Belvedere Marittimo, Roseto Capo Spulico, Corigliano Calabro, Cir\u00f2 Marina, Amendolara, Roccella Ionica, Bagnara Calabra, Nicotera, Cariati, Zambrone, Isola di Capo Rizzuto, Caminia (\"comune\" of Staletti), Siderno, Parghelia, Ricadi and San Nicola Arcella.\nIn addition to the coastal tourist destinations, the interior of Calabria is rich in history, traditions, art and culture. Cosenza is among the most important cultural cities of Calabria, with a rich historical and artistic patrimony. Medieval castles, towers, churches, monasteries and other French castles and structures from the Norman to the Aragonese periods are common elements in both the interior and coastline of Calabria.\nThe mountains offer skiing and other winter activities: Sila, Pollino and Aspromonte are three national parks that offer facilities for winter sports, especially in the towns of Camigliatello (\"comune\" of Spezzano della Sila), Lorica (\"comune\" of San Giovanni in Fiore), Gambarie.\nCalabria has many small and picturesque villages, 15 of them have been selected by (), a non-profit private association of small Italian towns of strong historical and artistic interest, that was founded on the initiative of the Tourism Council of the National Association of Italian Municipalities.\nUnemployment rate.\nThe unemployment rate stood at 20.1% in 2020 and was the highest in Italy and one of the highest inside the European Union.\nInfrastructure and transport.\nMotorways and rail.\nThe region is served by three heavily used roads: two national highways along the coasts (the SS18 between Naples and Reggio Calabria and the SS106 between Reggio Calabria and Taranto) and the A2 motorway, which links Salerno to Reggio Calabria, passing by Cosenza along the old inland route. Building this motorway took 55 years and was extremely over budget due to organized crime infiltration.\nThe main road infrastructures can be classified into two separate groups, the first including the road infrastructures that cross the whole of Calabria from north to south:\nThe second group includes the roads, which run through the region from the Tyrrhenian coast to the Ionian coast (west-east) .\nThere is high-speed rail on Calabria's Tyrrhenian Coast with the Frecciargento (Silver Arrow) offering a route from Rome to Reggio Calabria. There are also many ferries connecting Calabria with Sicily through the Strait of Sicily with the main one being from Villa San Giovanni to Messina.\nShipping and ports.\nThe main Calabrian ports are in Gioia Tauro and in Reggio Calabria. \nThe port of Gioia Tauro has seven loading docks with an extension of ; it is the largest in Italy and the eighth largest container port in Europe, with a 2018 throughput of 4.0 million\u00a0TEUs from more than 3,000 ships. In a 2006 report, Italian investigators estimated that 80% of Europe's cocaine arrived from Colombia via Gioia Tauro's docks. The port is also involved in the illegal arms trafficking. These activities are controlled by the \"'Ndrangheta\" criminal syndicate.\nThe port of Reggio is equipped with five loading docks of a length of .\nOther ports:\nBridges.\nCalabria has the two highest bridges in Italy:\nPlanned bridge.\nPlans for a bridge linking Sicily to Calabria have been discussed since 1865. Throughout the last decade, plans were developed for a road and rail link to the mainland via what would be the world's longest suspension bridge, the Strait of Messina Bridge. Planning for the project has experienced several false starts over the past few decades. On 6 March 2009, Silvio Berlusconi's government declared that the construction works for the Messina Bridge would begin on 23 December 2009, and announced a pledge of \u20ac1.3\u00a0billion as a contribution to the bridge's total cost, estimated at \u20ac6.1\u00a0billion.\nThe plan has been criticized by environmental associations and some local Sicilians and Calabrians, concerned with its environmental impact, economic sustainability and even possible infiltrations by organized crime. \nIn August of 2025, the Strait of Messina Bridge was given final approval by the Meloni government. Construction is expected to commence in the fall of 2025. The bridge will connect Villa San Giovanni and Torre Faro when it opens in 2032 and it will be the longest suspension bridge in the world.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe following is a list of Calabrian communes with a population of over 20,000:\nAdministrative divisions.\nCalabria is divided into five provinces:\nLanguage.\nAlthough the official national language of Calabria has been Standard Italian since before unification in 1861, Calabria has dialects that have been spoken in the region for centuries. The Calabrian language is a direct derivative of Latin. Most linguists divide the various dialects into two different language groups. In the northern area of the region, the Calabrian dialects are considered part of the Neapolitan language and are grouped as Northern Calabrian. In the rest of the region, the Calabrian dialects are often grouped as Central and Southern Calabrian, and are considered part of the Sicilian language. However, in Guardia Piemontese, as well as some quarters of Reggio Calabria, a variety of Occitan called Gardiol can also be found. In addition, since Calabria was once ruled by the French and Spanish, some Calabrian dialects exhibit Spanish and French influences.\nAnother important linguistic minority, in the nine towns of Boves\u00eca in the province of Reggio Calabria, speaks a derivative of ancient Greek called Grecanico, a remnant of Byzantine rule and ancient Magna Graecia.\nReligion.\nThe majority of Calabrians are Roman Catholic. Historically, Calabrians were Greek Orthodox, and in 732 the dioceses of southern Italy were even moved to the jurisdiction of the Patriarch of Constantinople. There are also communities of Evangelicals in the region. Calabria has also been called \"The Land of Saints\" as the region was the birthplace of many saints spanning nearly 2,000 years. The most famous saint in Calabria and also the patron saint of the region is St. Francis of Paola. Calabria also has another patron saint called Saint Bruno of Cologne who was the founder of the Carthusian Order. Saint Bruno would build the charterhouse of Serra San Bruno, a town which bears his name, in 1095 and later die there in 1101.\nEven though it is currently a very small community, there has been a long history of the presence of Jews in Calabria. The Jews have had a presence in the region for at least 1600 years and possibly as much as 2300 years. Calabrian Jews have had notably influence on many areas of Jewish life and culture. Although virtually identical to the Jews of Sicily, the Jews of Calabria are considered a distinct Jewish population due to historical and geographic considerations. There is a small community of Italian Anusim who have resumed the Jewish faith.\nIt is important to highlight the presence of Calabrians in Renaissance humanism and in the Renaissance. Indeed, the Hellenistics in this period frequently came from Calabria maybe because of the Greek influence. The rediscovery of Ancient Greek was very difficult because this language had been almost forgotten. In this period the presence of Calabrian humanists or refugees from Constantinople was fundamental. The study of Ancient Greek, in this period, was mainly a work of two monks of the monastery of Seminara: Barlaam, bishop of Gerace, and his disciple, Leonzio Pilato. Leonzio Pilato, in particular, was a Calabrian born near Reggio Calabria. He was an important teacher of Ancient Greek and translator, and he helped Giovanni Boccaccio in the translations of Homer's works.\nCuisine.\nThe cuisine is a typical southern Italian Mediterranean cuisine with a balance between meat-based dishes (pork, lamb, goat), vegetables (especially eggplant), and fish. Pasta (as in central Italy and the rest of southern Italy) is also very important in Calabria. In contrast to most other Italian regions, Calabrians have traditionally placed an emphasis on the preservation of their food and packing vegetables and meats in olive oil, and on making sausages and cold cuts (\"soppressata\", 'nduja, \"capocollo\"). Along the coast fish is cured, especially swordfish, sardines (\"sardelle rosamarina\") and cod (\"baccal\u00e0\"). Local desserts are typically fried, honey-sweetened pastries such as \"cudduraci\", nacatole, \"scalille\" or \"scalidde\", or baked biscotti-type treats such as \"nzudda\".\nSome local specialties include \"caciocavallo\" cheese, \"cipolla rossa di Tropea\" (red onion), \"fr\u00ecttuli\" and \"curc\u00f9ci\" (fried pork), liquorice (\"liquirizia\"), \"lagane e cicciari\" (a pasta dish with chickpeas),\" pecorino crotonese\" (sheep cheese), morzello (bowels of veal), and \"pignolata\".\nIn ancient times Calabria was referred to as \"Enotria\" (from Ancient Greek , ', 'land of wine'). According to ancient Greek tradition, ('), the youngest of the sons of Lycaon, was the eponym of Oenotria. Some vineyards have origins dating back to the ancient Greek colonists. The best known DOC wines are Cir\u00f2 (province of Crotone) and Donnici from the Donnici region (province of Cosenza). 3% of the total annual production qualifies as DOC. Important grape varieties are the red Gaglioppo and white Greco. Many producers are resurrecting local, ancient grape varieties which have been around for as long as 3000 years.\nSport.\nThe most popular sport in Calabria is football. In the 2023\u201324 Serie B season, Calabria hosts 2 out of 20 teams: Cosenza Calcio and Catanzaro. Other big teams of the region are Crotone and Vibonese, who are playing in the 2023\u201324 Serie C.\nViola Reggio Calabria is an Italian professional basketball club based in Reggio Calabria, Calabria.\nUniversities.\nThere are 3 public universities in the region of Calabria\nThere is also the private University for Foreigners \"Dante Alighieri\" in Reggio Calabria.\nHealth.\nThe health service in Calabria is organized into four main public hospitals and thirty secondary ones, and there are numerous private hospital facilities. Because of their debts, since 2009 they were administered by an extraordinary commissioner. It has been seen as an unavoidable step to return to an ordinary and cost-effective administration at a regional level, as it is provided by the Italian Constitution.\nThe four main public hospitals are\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "44774", "revid": "28438", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44774", "title": "Yakuza", "text": "Members of organized crime syndicates in Japan\n, also known as , are members of transnational organized crime syndicates originating in Japan. The Japanese police and media (by request of the police) call them , while the yakuza call themselves . The English equivalent for the term \"yakuza\" is gangster, meaning an individual involved in a Mafia-like criminal organization.\nThe yakuza are known for their strict codes of conduct, their organized fiefdom nature, and several unconventional ritual practices such as \"yubitsume\", or amputation of the left little finger. Members are often portrayed as males with heavily tattooed bodies and wearing a \"fundoshi\", sometimes with a kimono or, in more recent years, a Western-style \"sharp\" suit covering them.\nAt their height, the yakuza maintained a large presence in the Japanese media, and they also operated internationally. In 1963, the number of yakuza members and quasi-members reached a peak of 184,100. However, this number has drastically dropped, a decline attributed to changing market opportunities and several legal and social developments in Japan that discourage the growth of yakuza membership. In 1991, it had 63,800 members and 27,200 quasi-members, but by 2024, it had only 9,900 members and 8,900 quasi-members. The yakuza are aging because young people no longer readily join, and the average age of members at the end of 2022 was 54 years. Of that, only 5% were in their 20s, while 13% in their 30s, 26% in their 40s, 31% in their 50s, 13% in their 60s, and 12% in their 70s or older. More than half of the members were at least 50 years or older.\nThe yakuza still regularly engage in an array of criminal activities, and many Japanese citizens remain fearful of the threat these individuals pose to their safety. There remains no strict prohibition on yakuza membership in Japan today, although many pieces of legislation have been passed by the Japanese government aimed at impeding revenue and increasing liability for criminal activities.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"yakuza\" gives status and originates from the traditional Japanese card game \"Oicho-Kabu\", a game in which the goal is to draw three cards adding up to a score of 9. If the sum of the cards is 10 or more, the second digit is the score. So a sum of 13 is a score of 3, a sum of 14 is a score of 4, etc. A sum of 10 or 20 is a score of 0. If the three cards drawn are 8-9-3 (pronounced ya-ku-za in archaic Japanese), the sum is 20 and therefore the score is zero, making one of the worst possible hands that can be drawn. In Japanese, the word \"yakuza\" is commonly written in katakana (\u30e4\u30af\u30b6).\nOrigins.\nDespite uncertainty about the single origin of yakuza organizations, most modern yakuza derive from two social classifications which emerged in the mid-Edo period (1603\u20131868): \"tekiya\", those who primarily peddled illicit, stolen or shoddy goods; and \"bakuto\", those who were involved in or participated in gambling.\n\"Tekiya\" (peddlers) ranked as one of the lowest social groups during the Edo period. As they began to form organizations of their own, they took over some administrative duties relating to commerce, such as stall allocation and protection of their commercial activities. During Shinto festivals, these peddlers opened stalls and some members were hired to act as security. Each peddler paid rent in exchange for a stall assignment and protection during the fair.\nThe \"tekiya\" were a highly structured and hierarchical group with the \"oyabun\" (boss) at the top and \"kobun\" (gang members) at the bottom. This hierarchy resembles a structure similar to the family \u2013 in traditional Japanese culture, the \"oyabun\" was often regarded as a surrogate father, and the \"kobun\" as surrogate children. During the Edo period, the government formally recognized the \"tekiya\". At this time, within the \"tekiya\", the \"oyabun\" were appointed as supervisors and granted near-samurai status, meaning they were allowed the dignity of a surname and two swords.\n\"Bakuto\" (gamblers) had a much lower social standing even than traders, as gambling was illegal. Many small gambling houses cropped up in abandoned temples or shrines at the edges of towns and villages all over Japan. Most of these gambling houses ran loan-sharking businesses for clients, and they usually maintained their own security personnel. Society at large regarded the gambling houses themselves, as well as the \"bakuto\", with disdain. Much of the undesirable image of the yakuza originates from \"bakuto\"; this includes the name \"yakuza\" itself.\nBecause of the economic situation during the mid-Edo period and the predominance of the merchant class, developing yakuza groups were composed of misfits and delinquents who had joined or formed the groups to extort customers in local markets by selling fake or shoddy goods.\nShimizu Jirocho (1820\u20131893) is Japan's most famous yakuza and folk hero. He was born Chogoro Yamamoto, but changed his name when he was adopted, a common Japanese practice. His life and exploits were featured in sixteen films between 1911 and 1940.\nThe roots of the yakuza survive today in initiation ceremonies, which incorporate tekiya or bakuto rituals. Although the modern Yakuza has diversified, some gangs still identify with one group or the other; for example, a gang whose primary source of income is illegal gambling may refer to themselves as \"bakuto\".\nKyushu.\nThe island of Kyushu (and particularly its northern prefecture Fukuoka) has a reputation for being a large source of yakuza members, including many renowned bosses in the Yamaguchi-gumi. Isokichi Yoshida (1867\u20131936) from the Kitakyushu area was considered by some scholars and political watchers as one of the first renowned modern yakuza. Recently Shinobu Tsukasa and Kunio Inoue, the bosses of the two most powerful clans in the Yamaguchi-gumi, originate from Kyushu. Fukuoka, the northernmost part of the island, has the largest number of designated syndicates among all of the prefectures.\nOrganization and activities.\nStructure.\nDuring the formation of the yakuza, they adopted the traditional Japanese hierarchical structure of oyabun-kobun where \"kobun\" (\u5b50\u5206; lit. foster child) owe their allegiance to the . In a much later period, the code of was developed where loyalty and respect are a way of life. The oyabun-kobun relationship is formalized by ceremonial sharing of sake from a single cup. This ritual is not exclusive to the yakuza \u2013 it is also commonly performed in traditional Japanese Shinto weddings, and may have been a part of sworn brotherhood relationships.\nThe structure of yakuza organizations is characterized by a multi-layered hierarchical structure. The of an organization become and run their own subsidiary organizations, and the \"kobun\" of the subsidiary organizations also become \"oyabun\" and run their own subsidiary organizations. A large yakuza organization such as the Yamaguchi-gumi is made up of five or six layered organizations. In other words, the heads of subsidiary organizations are often executives of the parent organizations.\nThe \"oyabun\" of the organization is generally called a or , the person corresponding to pseudo younger brother of the \"kumich\u014d\" is called a , and the person corresponding to pseudo child of the \"kumich\u014d\" (\"kobun\") is called a or . means younger brother, and its status varies greatly depending on whose brother it is. From the perspective of the organization as a whole, \"shatei\" generally refers to the younger brother of an \"oyabun\", and thus to a high-ranking person in the organization, but it is also possible for a lower-level member to refer to his pseudo younger brother as a \"shatei\".\nAlthough positions in yakuza organizations vary from clan to clan, the three most important yakuza positions are \"kumich\u014d\", , and . , , and , are also important positions. In general, the of an organization is run by the \"wakagashira\", \"shateigashira\", and \"honbuch\u014d\". Since the \"shatei\" are the pseudo-younger brothers of the \"kumich\u014d\", they are generally older and have higher nominal positions but relatively little real authority. In the Yamaguchi-gumi pecking order as of 2024, the order is \"kumich\u014d\", \"wakagashira\", \"shateigashira\", and \"honbuch\u014d\".\nYakuza groups are headed by an \"oyabun\" (\"kumich\u014d\" or \"kaich\u014d\") who gives orders to his subordinates, the \"kobun\". In this respect, the organization is a variation of the traditional Japanese senpai-k\u014dhai (senior-junior) model. Members of yakuza cut their real family ties and transfer their loyalty to the \"oyabun\". They refer to each other as family members\u2014, , and . Among brothers, it is common to refer to a person equal to oneself as \"ky\u014ddai\", a younger brother as \"ky\u014ddai\" or \"shatei\", and an older brother as . The yakuza is populated almost entirely by men and the very few women who are acknowledged are the wives of bosses, who are referred to by the title . When the 3rd Yamaguchi-gumi boss (Kazuo Taoka) died in the early 1980s, his wife (Fumiko) took over as boss of Yamaguchi-gumi, albeit for a short time.\nDuring the World War II period in Japan, the more traditional tekiya/bakuto form of organization declined as the entire population was mobilised to participate in the war effort and society came under the control of the strict military government. However, after the war, the Yakuza adapted again.\nRituals.\nYubitsume, also referred to as \"otoshimae\", or the cutting off of one's finger, is a form of penance or apology. Upon a first offence, the transgressor must cut off the tip of his left little finger and give the severed portion to his boss. Sometimes an underboss may do this in penance to the oyabun if he wants to spare a member of his own gang from further retaliation. This practice has started to wane amongst the younger members, due to it being an easy identifier for police.\nIts origin stems from the traditional way of holding a Japanese sword. The bottom three fingers of each hand are used to grip the sword tightly, with the thumb and index fingers slightly loose. The removal of digits starting with the little finger and moving up the hand to the index finger progressively weakens a person's sword grip.\nThe idea is that a person with a weak sword grip then has to rely more on the group for protection\u2014reducing individual action. In recent years, prosthetic fingertips have been developed to disguise this distinctive appearance.\nMany yakuza have full-body tattoos (including their genitalia). These tattoos, known as irezumi in Japan, are still often \"hand-poked\", that is, the ink is inserted beneath the skin using non-electrical, hand-made, and handheld tools with needles of sharpened bamboo or steel. The procedure is expensive and painful, and can take years to complete.\nWhen yakuza play Oicho-Kabu cards with each other, they often remove their shirts or open them up and drape them around their waists. This enables them to display their full-body tattoos to each other. This is one of the few times that yakuza display their tattoos to others, as they normally keep them concealed in public with long-sleeved and high-necked shirts. When new members join, they are often required to remove their trousers as well and reveal any lower body tattoos.\nSyndicates.\nNumber of members and quasi-members.\nThe total number of yakuza members and quasi-members peaked at 184,100 in 1963, and then continued to decline due to police crackdowns. The number of regular members decreased with the implementation of the in 1992, and the total number of members and quasi-members began to decline rapidly with the implementation of the yakuza exclusion ordinances in all 47 prefectures around 2010. Between 1990 and 2020, the total number of members and quasi-members decreased by 70 percent.\nThe National Police Agency reported that Japanese yakuza organizations had 9,900 members and 8,900 quasi-members in 2024.\nDesignated yakuza (\"Shitei B\u014dryokudan\").\nA is a \"particularly harmful\" yakuza group registered by the Prefectural Public Safety Commissions under the enacted in 1991. Groups are designated as if their members take advantage of the gang's influence to do business, are structured to have one leader, and have a large portion of their members hold criminal records. After the Act on Prevention of Unjust Acts by Organized Crime Group Members was enacted, many yakuza syndicates made efforts to restructure to appear more professional and legitimate.\nAs of 2024, Under the Act on Prevention of Unjust Acts by Organized Crime Group Members, the Prefectural Public Safety Commissions have registered 25 syndicates as the designated yakuza groups. Three of these organizations have more than 1,000 regular members, eight have more than 100, and 14 have less than 100. Fukuoka Prefecture has the largest number of designated yakuza groups among all of the prefectures, at 5; the Kudo-kai, the Taishu-kai, the Fukuhaku-kai, the Dojin-kai, and the Namikawa-kai.\nIn August 2021, the Fukuoka District Court sentenced Satoru Nomura, the fifth head of Kudo-kai, to death for murder and attempted murder. This was the first death sentence handed down to a designated yakuza head. His death sentence was eventually overturned and reduced to life imprisonment in March of 2024. Kudo-kai is the only one of the designated yakuza to be designated as an , a more dangerous type of yakuza.\nThree largest syndicates and six major syndicates.\nAs of 2024, the National Police Agency has designated Yamaguchi-gumi, Kobe Yamaguchi-gumi, Kizuna-kai, Ikeda-gumi (), Sumiyoshi-kai, and Inagawa-kai as among the designated yakuza. These six organizations have a total of 7,300 members and 6,100 quasi-members, for a total of 13,500 members, or 71.8 percent of the total 18,800 yakuza members and quasi-members in Japan.\nKobe Yamaguchi-gumi split off from Yamaguchi-gumi in August 2015, Kizuna-kai split off from Kobe Yamaguchi-gumi in April 2017, and Ikeda-gumi split off from Kobe Yamaguchi-gumi in July 2020. These Yamaguchi-gumi and the three organizations that split from them are fighting each other.\nIn recent years, the three major yakuza syndicates have formed a loose alliance, and in April 2023, Kiyoshi Takayama, the \"wakagashira\" (second-in-command) of the Yamaguchi-gumi, Shuji Ogawa, the \"kaich\u014d\" (chairman) of the Sumiyoshi-kai, and Kazuya Uchibori (), the \"kaich\u014d\" of the Inagawa-kai, held a social gathering.\nCurrent activities.\nJapan.\nIn the 2010s and 2020s, the yakuza's main source of funding is a fraud called , which mainly targets the elderly to cheat them out of large amounts of money. Their methods include calling the homes of elderly people to beg for money by pretending to be the elderly person's son, or visiting the homes of elderly people posing as employees of financial institutions to swindle them out of their money. In 2014, \"tokushu sagi\" accounted for 10.4 percent of all yakuza arrests, surpassing theft for the first time at 10.2 percent, and 34.6 percent of \"tokushu sagi\" perpetrators were yakuza and their associates. The total damage from \"tokushu sagi\" identified in 2019 exceeded 30 billion yen, and while yakuza accounted for just over 10 percent of the lowest level members of criminal groups, such as cash receivers who play the role of financial institution employees, yakuza accounted for nearly 40 percent of the main perpetrators leading fraud schemes.\nThe yakuza and its affiliated gangs control drug trafficking in Japan, especially methamphetamine. While many yakuza syndicates, notably the Yamaguchi-gumi, officially forbid their members from engaging in drug trafficking, some other yakuza syndicates, like the Dojin-kai, are heavily involved in it. The most common charge for yakuza and their associates arrested in 2014 was violation of the , which prohibits the import, export, sale, transfer, possession, and use of methamphetamine, accounting for 26.5 percent of arrests.\nSome yakuza groups are known to deal extensively in human trafficking. In the Philippines Yakuza trick girls from impoverished villages into coming to Japan by promising them respectable jobs with good wages. Instead, they are forced into becoming sex workers and strippers.\nYakuza frequently engaged in a unique form of Japanese extortion known as \"s\u014dkaiya\". In essence, this is a specialized form of protection racket. Instead of harassing small businesses, the Yakuza harass a stockholders' meeting of a larger corporation. Yakuza operatives obtain the right to attend by making a small purchase of stock, and then at the meeting physically intimidate other stockholders. The number of has decreased over the years, and in 2024 there were only about 130 , of whom 20 worked in groups and 110 worked alone.\nYakuza also had ties to the Japanese real estate market and banking sector through \"jiageya\". Jiageya specializes in inducing holders of small real estate to sell their property so that estate companies can carry out much larger development plans. The Japanese bubble economy of the 1980s is often blamed on real estate speculation by banking subsidiaries. After the collapse of the property bubble, a manager of a major bank in Nagoya was assassinated, prompting much speculation about the banking industry's indirect connection to the Japanese underworld.\nIn 1989, Susumu Ishii, the Oyabun of the Inagawa-kai (a well-known yakuza group) bought US$255 million worth of Tokyo Kyuko Electric Railway's stock. Japan's Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission has knowledge of more than 50 listed companies with ties to organized crime, and in March 2008, the Osaka Securities Exchange decided to review all listed companies and expel those with yakuza ties.\nYakuza involvement in politics functions similarly to that of a lobbying group, with them backing those who share in their opinions or beliefs.\nYakuza's aid in earthquakes.\nIn the wake of the 1995 Kobe earthquake, the Yamaguchi-gumi yakuza group, who are based in the area, mobilized to provide disaster relief services (including the use of a helicopter). Media reports contrasted this rapid response with the much slower pace at which the Japanese government's official relief efforts took place.\nFollowing the T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami on 11 March 2011, the yakuza sent hundreds of trucks filled with food, water, blankets, and sanitary accessories to aid the people in the affected areas of the natural disaster.\nCNN M\u00e9xico said that although the yakuza operates through extortion and other violent methods, they \"[moved] swiftly and quietly to provide aid to those most in need.\"\nUnited States.\nThe presence of individuals affiliated with the yakuza in the United States has increased tremendously since the 1960s, and although much of their activity is concentrated in Hawaii, they have made their presence known in other parts of the country, especially in Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area, as well as Seattle, Las Vegas, Arizona, Virginia, Chicago, and New York City. The yakuza are said to use Hawaii as a midway station between Japan and mainland America, smuggling methamphetamine into the country and smuggling firearms back to Japan. They easily fit into the local population, since many tourists from Japan and other Asian countries visit the islands on a regular basis, and there is a large population of residents who are of full or partial Japanese descent. They also work with local gangs, funneling Japanese tourists to gambling parlors and brothels.\nIn California, the yakuza have made alliances with local Korean gangs as well as Chinese triads and Vietnamese gangs. The yakuza identified these gangs as useful partners due to the constant stream of Vietnamese cafe shoot-outs and home invasion burglaries throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. In New York City, they appear to collect finder's fees from Russian, Irish and Italian gang members and businessmen for guiding Japanese tourists to gambling establishments, both legal and illegal.\nHandguns manufactured in the US account for a large share (33%) of handguns seized in Japan, followed by handguns manufactured in China (16%) and in the Philippines (10%). In 1990, a Smith &amp; Wesson .38 caliber revolver that cost $275 in the US could sell for up to $4,000 in Tokyo.\nIn 2001, the FBI's representative in Tokyo arranged for Tadamasa Goto, the head of the group Goto-gumi, to receive a liver transplant at the UCLA Medical Center in the United States, in return for information of Yamaguchi-gumi operations in the US. This was done without prior consultation of the NPA. The journalist who uncovered the deal received threats from Goto and was given police protection in the US and in Japan.\nThe FBI suspects that the yakuza were using various operations to launder money in the US as of 2008[ [update]].\nAsia (outside Japan).\nThe yakuza have engaged in illegal activities in Southeast Asia since the 1960s; they are working there to develop sex tourism and drug trafficking. This is the area where they are still the most active today.\nIn addition to their presence in Southeast Asian countries such as Thailand, the Philippines, and Vietnam, yakuza groups also operate in South Korea, China, Taiwan, and in the Pacific Islands (mainly Hawaii).\nYakuza groups also have a presence in North Korea; in 2009, yakuza Yoshiaki Sawada was released from a North Korean prison after spending five years there attempting to bribe a North Korean official and smuggle drugs.\nConstituent members.\nProspective yakuza come from all walks of life. The most romantic tales tell how yakuza accept sons who have been abandoned or exiled by their parents. Many yakuza start out in junior high school or high school as common street thugs or members of b\u014ds\u014dzoku gangs. Perhaps because of its lower socio-economic status, numerous yakuza members come from burakumin and ethnic Korean backgrounds. Low-ranking youth may be referred to as \"chinpira\" or \"chimpira\".\nAccording to a 2006 speech by Mitsuhiro Suganuma, a former officer of the Public Security Intelligence Agency, around 60 percent of yakuza members come from burakumin, the descendants of a feudal outcast class and approximately 30 percent of yakuza are Japanese-born Koreans, and only 10 percent are from non-burakumin Japanese and Chinese ethnic groups.\nBurakumin.\nThe burakumin is a group that Japanese society socially discriminates against, and its recorded history goes back to the Heian period in the 11th century. The burakumin are the descendants of outcast communities which originated in the pre-modern era, especially the feudal era, mainly those people with occupations which are considered tainted because they are associated with death or ritual impurity, such as butchers, executioners, undertakers, or leather workers. They traditionally lived in their own secluded hamlets and villages away from other groups.\nAccording to David E. Kaplan and Alec Dubro, burakumin account for about 70% of the members of Yamaguchi-gumi, the largest yakuza syndicate in Japan.\nEthnic Koreans.\nWhile ethnic Koreans make up only 0.5% of the Japanese population, they are a prominent part of yakuza because they suffer discrimination in Japanese society along with the \"burakumin\". In the early 1990s, 18 of 90 top bosses of \"Inagawa-kai\" were ethnic Koreans. The Japanese National Police Agency suggested Koreans composed 10% of the yakuza proper. Some of the representatives of the designated B\u014dryokudan are also Koreans. The Korean significance had been an untouchable taboo in Japan and one of the reasons that the Japanese version of Kaplan and Dubro's \"Yakuza\" (1986) had not been published until 1991 with the deletion of Korean-related descriptions of the \"Yamaguchi-gumi\".\nJapanese-born people of Korean ancestry who retain South Korean nationality are considered resident aliens and are embraced by the yakuza precisely because they fit the group's \"outsider\" image.\nNotable yakuza of Korean ancestry include Hisayuki Machii, the founder of the Tosei-kai, Tokutaro Takayama, the head of the 4th-generation Aizukotetsu-kai, Jiro Kiyota, the head of the 5th-generation Inagawa-kai, Shinichi Matsuyama, the head of the 5th-generation Kyokuto-kai, and Hirofumi Hashimoto, the founder of the now-defunct Kyokushinrengo-kai.\nLaw enforcement and indirect enforcement.\nOperation Summit.\nBetween 1964 and 1965, the Japanese police carried out mass arrests of yakuza leaders and executives in what they called the in response to public demands for the yakuza to be banished from society. As a result, crime declined and the number of arrested yakuza fell from about 59,000 in 1964 to 38,000 in 1967. The number of yakuza organizations and members also declined, from 5,216 organizations and 184,091 members in 1963 to 3,500 organizations and 139,089 members in 1969. As a result, 1963, the year before the First Operation Summit was launched, was the peak of yakuza power.\nFrom around 1970, yakuza leaders and executives who had been imprisoned began to be released from prison, and yakuza organizations that had been disbanded during the First Operation Summit were revived and reorganized, leading the police to conduct the Second Operation Summit in 1970 and the Third Operation Summit in 1975. These series of police crackdowns led to a decline in the number of yakuza organizations and members, from 2957 organizations with 123,044 members in 1972 to 2517 organizations with 106,754 members in 1979. As a result, small yakuza organizations were forced to dissolve, and the total number of members decreased, but some members transferred to large yakuza organizations, so the number of members of large organizations actually increased during this period. The three major organizations, Yamaguchi-gumi, Sumiyoshi-kai, and Inagawa-kai, expanded during this period. During this period, Japan was in a recession following the energy crisis of the 1970s, and it became difficult for the yakuza to acquire sufficient financial resources through traditional methods alone, so it was inevitable that they would consolidate into large yakuza organizations with diverse or legal sources of funding.\nAnti-yakuza laws.\nThe , passed in 1991 and enacted in 1992, was a landmark piece of legislation that cracked down on the yakuza. The law prohibited 27 acts by yakuza, including demanding hush money or donations, collecting debts and conducting land grabbing activities in an unjustified manner. The law also made it illegal to demand and collect so-called from downtown restaurants and bars, which were the yakuza's main source of funding. Police could issue two cease-and-desist orders to offenders who demanded \"mikajime-ry\u014d\", and could arrest offenders who still refused to comply. Until then, the yakuza had charged bouncer fees to restaurants and bars in their territory, especially those open at night, and made various threats, such as ramming dump trucks into businesses that refused, and business owners, fearing reprisals, had paid \"mikajime-ry\u014d\", but the new law resulted in more businesses refusing \"mikajime-ry\u014d\" and the yakuza's financial resources were lost. In 1991, the yakuza had 63,800 members, but by 1992, when the new law took effect, the number had dropped sharply to about 56,600, then to about 48,000 in 1994 and 43,100 in 2001.\nAdditional regulations can be found in a 2008 anti-yakuza amendment which allows prosecutors to place the blame on any yakuza-related crime on crime bosses. Specifically, the leader of the Yamaguchi-gumi has since been incarcerated and forced to pay upwards of 85 million yen in damages of several crimes committed by his gangsters, leading to the yakuza's dismissal of around 2,000 members per year; albeit, some analysts claim that these dismissals are part of the yakuza's collective attempt to regain a better reputation amongst the populace. Regardless, the yakuza's culture, too, has shifted towards a more secretive and far less public approach to crime, as many of their traditions have been reduced or erased to avoid being identified as yakuza.\nBeginning in 2009, led by agency chief , Japanese police began to crack down on the gangs. Yamaguchi-gumi's number two and Kodo-kai chief Kiyoshi Takayama was arrested in late 2010. In December 2010, police arrested Yamaguchi-gumi's alleged number three leader, Tadashi Irie.\nYakuza exclusion ordinances.\nIn addition to the anti-yakuza laws, the Yakuza exclusion ordinances enacted by each of Japan's 47 prefectures between 2009 and 2011 also contributed significantly to the decline of the yakuza. Ordinances were enacted in Osaka and Tokyo in 2010 and 2011 to try to combat yakuza influence by making it illegal for any business to do business with the yakuza. While the anti-yakuza laws prohibited the yakuza from making unreasonable demands on businesses and citizens, these ordinances prohibited businesses and citizens from offering benefits to the yakuza. This made it increasingly difficult for the yakuza to raise funds, as fewer businesses and citizens succumbed to the yakuza's threats and offered benefits to the yakuza, such as contracting work or paying money to the yakuza. According to the media, encouraged by tougher anti-yakuza laws and yakuza exclusion ordinances, local governments and construction companies have begun to shun or ban yakuza activities or involvement in their communities or construction projects.\nIn addition, these ordinances have made it difficult for yakuza members to lead normal civilian lives. The ordinances also require businesses and citizens to refuse to rent meeting rooms or parking spaces to the yakuza, or to print business cards with the name of yakuza organizations on them. Companies can now also refuse to open bank accounts, sign mobile phone contracts, credit card contracts, lease real estate, or process various loans for people identified as yakuza under the anti-yakuza laws, making it more difficult for yakuza to live in society. Even companies that provide lifelines have become tough on the yakuza, with Osaka Gas terminating contracts if a contractor is discovered to be a yakuza. To prevent yakuza from nominally leaving the organization and signing contracts with companies, these ordinances allow companies to treat a person as a yakuza for five years even if he or she has nominally left the yakuza and become a civilian.\nSince 2011, regulations outlawing business with yakuza members, government-ordered audits of yakuza finances, and the enactment of yakuza exclusion ordinances have hastened a decline in yakuza membership. The number of yakuza members and quasi-members fell from 78,600 in 2010 to 25,900 in 2020.\nOutside Japan.\nYakuza organizations also face pressure from the US government; in 2011, a federal executive order required financial institutions to freeze yakuza assets, and as of 2013, the U.S. Treasury Department had frozen about US$55,000 of yakuza holdings, including two Japan-issued American Express cards.\nCurrent situation.\nThe number of yakuza members and quasi-members fell by about 70 percent in the 30 years between 1990, before the anti-yakuza law, and 2020, after the anti-yakuza laws and the yakuza exclusion ordinances took effect.\nWith the addition of the employer liability clause in the 2008 amendment to the Anti-yakuza law, there have been a number of situations in which yakuza bosses have been held liable for crimes committed by members of the yakuza. For example, in a civil case, the Tokyo High Court held the head of Sumiyoshi-kai liable for a committed by members of Sumiyoshi-kai under the employer liability article of the Anti-yakuza law in 2021. As a result, Sumiyoshi-kai paid 652 million yen to the victims (approximately $6 million US dollars at the time), 35 million yen more than the amount of damages.\nIn criminal cases, Nomura Satoru became the first boss to be sentenced to death under the employer liability clause on 24 August 2021. Nomura was involved in one murder and assaults of three people. The presiding judge Adachi Ben of the Fukuoka District Court characterized the murders as extremely vicious attacks. On 12 March 2024, the Fukuoka High Court overturned Nomura's death sentence and downgraded it to life imprisonment. The High Court found him not guilty of murder.\nOn top of the already staggering anti-yakuza legislation, Japan's younger generation may be less inclined to gang-related activity, as modern society has made it easier, especially for young men, to gain even semi-legitimate jobs such as ownership in bars and massage parlors and pornography that can be more profitable than gang affiliation - all while protecting themselves by abiding by the strict anti-yakuza laws.\nCitizens who take a stronger stance seem to also have taken action that does not lead to violent reactions from the yakuza. In Kyushu, although store owners initially were attacked by gang members, the region has reached stability after local business owners banned known yakuza and posted warnings against yakuza entering their premises.\nLegacy.\nYakuza in society.\nThe yakuza have had mixed relations with Japanese society. Despite their pariah status, some of their actions may be perceived to have positive effects on society. For example, they stop other criminal organizations from acting in their areas of operation. They have been known to provide relief in times of disaster. These actions have at times painted yakuza in a fairly positive light within Japan. The yakuza also attract membership from traditionally scorned minority groups, such as the Korean-Japanese. However, gang wars and the use of violence as a tool have caused their approval to fall with the general public. According to Jake Adelstein, one study found that 1 in 10 adults under the age of 40 believed that the yakuza should be allowed to exist.\nFilm.\nThe yakuza have been in media and culture in many different fashions. Creating its own genre of movies within Japan's film industry, the portrayal of the yakuza mainly manifests in one of two archetypes; they are portrayed as either honorable and respectable men or as criminals who use fear and violence as their means of operation. Movies like \"Battles Without Honor and Humanity\" and \"Dead or Alive\" portray some of the members as violent criminals, with the focus being on the violence, while other movies focus more on the \"business\" side of the yakuza.\nThe 1992 film \"Minbo\", a satirical view of yakuza activities, resulted in retaliation against the director, as real-life yakuza gangsters attacked the director Juzo Itami shortly after the release of the film.\nYakuza films have also been popular in the Western market with films such as the 1975 film \"The Yakuza\", the 1989 films \"Black Rain\" and \"The Punisher\", the 1995 film \"Johnny Mnemonic\", the 2005 film \"Into the Sun\", 2013's \"The Wolverine\", 2018 film \"The Outsider\", and \"Snake Eyes\" in 2021.\nTelevision.\nThe yakuza feature prominently in the 2015 American dystopian series \"The Man in the High Castle\". They are also the basis for the 2019 BBC TV Series \"Giri/Haji\", which features a character whose life is put in danger after he comes under suspicion for a murder tied to the yakuza. The 2022 HBO Max series \"Tokyo Vice\" explores the dealings of the yakuza from the perspective of an American reporter Jake Adelstein. The anime series \"Akiba Maid War\" is a dark comedic parody in which maid caf\u00e9s and yakuza culture are synonymous with one another.\nVideo games.\nThe video game series \"Like a Dragon,\" formerly known as \"Yakuza\" outside of Japan, launched in 2005, portrays the actions of several different ranking members of the yakuza, as well as criminal associates such as dirty cops and loan sharks. The series addresses some of the same themes as the yakuza genre of film does, like violence, honor, politics of the syndicates, and the social status of the yakuza in Japan. The series has been successful, spawning sequels, spin-offs, a live-action movie and a web TV series.\n\"Grand Theft Auto III\" features a yakuza clan that assists the protagonist in the second and third act after they cut their ties with the Mafia. The yakuza derive most of their income from a casino, Kenji's, and are currently fighting to keep other gangs from peddling drugs in their territory while seeking to protect their activities from police interference. Towards the end of the third act, the player assassinates the leader of the clan, and the other members are later executed by Colombian gangsters. In \"Grand Theft Auto III\"'s prequel, ', the yakuza play a major role in the storyline. In ', the yakuza are mentioned, presumably operating in Vice City.\n\"\" features a mission set in Japan that sees Agent 47 assassinating the son of a wealthy arms dealer during his dinner meeting with a yakuza boss at his private estate. A mission in the 2016 game, \"Hitman\", set at a secluded mountaintop hospital, features a notorious yakuza lawyer and fixer as one of two targets to be assassinated.\nManga, anime and television dramas.\nSeveral manga by Ryoichi Ikegami are located in the middle of the Japanese underworld:\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Naively, we would take the \ud835\udf0e-algebra on formula_4 to be formula_6 the smallest \ud835\udf0e-algebra containing all measurable \"rectangles\" formula_7 for formula_8\nWhile this approach does define a measure space, it has a flaw. Since every singleton set has one-dimensional Lebesgue measure zero,\nformula_9\nfor any subset formula_10 of formula_11 However, suppose that formula_10 is a non-measurable subset of the real line, such as the Vitali set. Then the formula_3-measure of formula_14 is not defined but\nformula_15\nand this larger set does have formula_3-measure zero. So this \"two-dimensional Lebesgue measure\" as just defined is not complete, and some kind of completion procedure is required.\nConstruction of a complete measure.\nGiven a (possibly incomplete) measure space (\"X\",\u00a0\u03a3,\u00a0\"\u03bc\"), there is an extension (\"X\",\u00a0\u03a30,\u00a0\"\u03bc\"0) of this measure space that is complete.

{"id": "44776", "revid": "1314142800", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44776", "title": "Catania", "text": "City in Sicily, Italy\nCatania (, , , ) is the second-largest municipality in Sicily, after Palermo, both by area and by population. Despite being the second city of the island, Catania is the centre of the most densely populated Sicilian conurbation, which is among the largest in Italy. It has important road and rail transport infrastructures, and hosts the main airport of Sicily (fifth-largest in Italy). The city is located on Sicily's east coast, facing the Ionian Sea at the base of the active volcano Mount Etna. It is the capital of the 58-municipality province known as the Metropolitan City of Catania, which is the seventh-largest metropolitan area in Italy. The population of the city proper is 297,517, while the population of the metropolitan city is 1,068,563.\nCatania was founded in the 8th century BC by Chalcidian Greeks in Magna Graecia. The city has weathered multiple geologic catastrophes: it was almost completely destroyed by a catastrophic earthquake in 1169. A major eruption and lava flow from nearby Mount Etna nearly swamped the city in 1669 and it suffered severe devastation from the 1693 Sicily earthquake.\nDuring the 14th century, and into the Renaissance period, Catania was one of Italy's most important cultural, artistic and political centres. It was the site of Sicily's first university, founded in 1434. It has been the native or adopted home of some of Italy's most famous artists and writers, including the composers Vincenzo Bellini and Giovanni Pacini, and the writers Giovanni Verga, Luigi Capuana, Federico De Roberto and Nino Martoglio.\nCatania today is the industrial, logistical, and commercial centre of Sicily. Its airport, the Catania\u2013Fontanarossa Airport, is the largest in Southern Italy. The central \"old town\" of Catania features exuberant late-baroque architecture, prompted after the 1693 earthquake, and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nEtymology.\nThe ancient indigenous population of Sicily, the Sicels, named their villages after geographical attributes of their location. The Siculian word \"katane\" means \"grater, flaying knife, skinning place\" or a \"crude tool apt to pare\". Other translations of the name are \"harsh lands\", \"uneven ground\", \"sharp stones\", or \"rugged or rough soil\". The latter etymologies are easily justifiable since, for many centuries following an eruption, the city has always been rebuilt within its black-lava landscape.\nAround 263 BC, the city was variously known as \"Cat\u012dna\" () and \"Cat\u0103na\" (; ). The former has been primarily used for its supposed assonance with \"catina\", the Latin feminization of the name \"catinus\". \"Catinus\" has two meanings: \"a gulf, a basin or a bay\" and \"a bowl, a vessel or a trough\", thanks to the city's distinctive topography.\nAround 900, when Catania was part of the emirate of Sicily, it was known in Arabic as \"Balad al-f\u012bl\" () and \"Mad\u012bnat al-f\u012bl\" (), respectively meaning \"the Village (or Country) of the Elephant\" and \"the City of the Elephant\". The Elephant likely referred to the ancient lava sculpture, now placed over the fountain in Piazza Duomo. The sculpture is most likely a prehistoric sculpture that was reforged during the Byzantine Era, prized as a protective talisman against enemies, both human, natural or geologic. Another Arab toponym was \"Qa\u1e6d\u0101niyyah\" (), allegedly from the Arabic word for the \"leguminous plants\". Pulses like lentils, beans, peas, broad beans, and lupins were chiefly cultivated in the plains around the city well before the arrival of Aghlabids. Afterwards, many Arabic agronomists developed these crops and the citrus orchards in the area around the city. The toponym \"W\u0101d\u012b M\u016bs\u00e1\" (), or \"the Valley of Moses\" (from the Arabic name of the Simeto River), was rarely used.\nHistory.\nFoundation.\nAround 729 BC, the ancient village of \"Katane\" was occupied by Chalcidian Greek settlers from nearby Naxos along the coast. It became the Chalcidian colony of \"Kat\u00e1n\u0113\" under a leader named Euarchos (Euarchus) and the native population was rapidly Hellenised.\nThucydides states that it came into existence slightly later than Leontini (modern Lentini), which he claims was five years after Syracuse, or 730 BC.\nThe settlement's acropolis was on the hill of Monte Vergine, a defensible hill immediately west of the current city centre. The port of Catania appears to have been much frequented in ancient time and was the chief place of export for the corn of the rich neighbouring plains.\nGreek Catania.\nCatania was associated with the ancient legend of Amphinomos and Anapias, who, on occasion of a great eruption of Etna, abandoned all their property and carried off their aged parents on their shoulders. The stream of lava itself was said to have parted, and flowed aside so as not to harm them. Statues were erected to their honour, and the place of their burial was known as the \"Campus Piorum\"; the Catanaeans even introduced the figures of the youths on their coins, and the legend became a favorite subject of allusion and declamation among the Latin poets, of whom the younger Lucilius and Claudian have dwelt upon it at considerable length.\nThe Greek polis of Catania appears to have been a local center of learning. The philosopher and legislator Charondas (late 6th c. BC), born in Catania, putatively wrote program of laws used here and in other Chalcidic cities, both in Sicily and through Magna Graecia. suggesting a link between Catania and other cities during this time. The poets Ibycus and Stesichorus (c.\u2009630\u2013555 BC) lived in Catania. The latter putatively was buried in a magnificent sepulchre outside one of the gates, therefore named \"Porta Stesichoreia\". Xenophanes (c.\u2009570\u2013475 BC), one of the founders of the Eleatic school of philosophy, also spent the latter years of his life in the city. The first introduction of dancing to accompany the flute was also ascribed to Andron, a citizen of Catania.\nCatania appears to have remained independent until the conquest by the despot Hieron of Syracuse; in 476 BC, he expelled all the original inhabitants of Catania and replaced them with his subjects from the town of Leontini \u2013 said to have numbered no less than 10,000, consisting partly of Syracusans and Peloponnesians. Hieron changed the city's name to (\"A\u00edtn\u0113\", Aetna or \u00c6tna, after the nearby Mount Etna, and proclaimed himself the Oekist or founder of the new city. For this he was celebrated by Pindar, and after his death he received heroic honours from the citizens of his new colony.\nA few years after the death of Hieron and the expulsion of Thrasybulus of Syracuse, the Syracusans combined with Ducetius, king of the Sicels, to expel the newly settled inhabitants of Catania, who went on to settle in the fortress of Inessa (to which they gave the name Aetna). The old Chalcidic citizens returned to the city in 461 BC.\nThe period that followed appears to have been one of great prosperity for Catania, as well as for the Sicilian cities in general.\nIn 415 BC, Catania became involved with the expedition to Sicily pursued by the Athenians to punish Syracuse. Initially the Catanaeans refused to allow the Athenians into their city, but after the latter had forced an entrance, the Athenian leader Alcibiades made a famous speech in front of the assembly. Catania became an ally, and the headquarters of the Athenian army for the first year of the expedition, and a base of their subsequent operations against Syracuse. After the defeat of the Athenians, Catania was again threatened by Syracuse. In 403 BC, Dionysius I of Syracuse plundered the city, sold its citizens as slaves, and repopulated the town with Campanian mercenaries. However, the Carthaginians would take possession of Catania under Himilco and Mago, after the nearby great naval Battle of Catana (397 BC) where they defeated Leptines of Syracuse, and in 396 BC forcing the local Campanian mercenaries to relocate to Aetna.\nCalippus, the assassin of Dion of Syracuse, held Catania for a time (Plut. \"Dion.\" 58); and when Timoleon landed in Sicily in 344 BC Catania was subject to the despot Mamercus who at first joined the Corinthian leader, but afterwards abandoned this allegiance for that of the Carthaginians. As a consequence he was attacked and expelled by Timoleon in 338 BC.\nCatania was now restored to a fragile independence; changing sides during the wars starting in 311 BC of Agathocles of Syracuse with the Carthaginians. When Pyrrhus landed in Sicily in 278 BC, Catania was the first to open its gates to him, and welcomed him with great splendor.\nRoman rule.\nDuring the First Punic War, Catania was one of the first cities of Sicily to submit to the Roman Republic after their first successes in 263 BC when it was taken by Valerius Messalla. A sundial was part of the booty which was placed in the Comitium in Rome. Since then the city became a \"civitas decumana\" i.e. was subject to the payment of a tenth of its agricultural income as a tax to Rome. The conqueror of Syracuse, Marcus Claudius Marcellus, built a gymnasium here.\nIt appears to have continued afterwards to maintain its friendly relations with Rome and though it did not enjoy the advantages of a confederate city (\"foederata civitas\"), like its neighbours Tauromenium (modern Taormina) and Messana (modern Messina), it rose to a position of great prosperity under the Roman rule.\nAround 135 BC during the First Servile War, it was conquered by rebel slaves.\nOne of the most serious eruptions of Mount Etna happened in 121 BC, when a great part of Catania was overwhelmed by streams of lava, and the hot ashes fell in such quantities in the city itself, as to break in the roofs of the houses. Catana was in consequence exempted, for 10 years, from its usual contributions to the Roman state. The greater part of the broad tract of plain to the southwest of Catana (now called the \"Piana di Catania\", a district of great fertility), appears to have belonged, in ancient times, to Leontini or Centuripa (modern Centuripe), but that portion of it between Catana itself and the mouth of the Symaethus was annexed to Catana and must have furnished abundant supplies of grain.\nCicero repeatedly mentions it as, in his time, a wealthy and flourishing city; it retained its ancient municipal institutions, its chief magistrate bearing the title of \"Proagorus\"; and appears to have been one of the principal ports of Sicily for the export of corn.\nIn the Sicilian revolt from 44 BC Sextus Pompeius selected Sicily as his base and Catania gave in to Sextus' revolt and joined his forces. Sextus amassed a formidable army and a large fleet of warships at his base at Messana, with many slaves joining from the villas of patricians. After the victory of Augustus in 36 BC much of the vast farmland in Sicily was either ruined or left empty, and much of this land was taken and distributed to members of the legions which had fought there. Catania suffered severely from the ravages but was afterwards one of the cities raised to the status of colony by Augustus which restored its prosperity through the settlement of veterans, so that in Strabo's time it was one of the few cities in the island that was flourishing.\nAnother revolt led by the gladiator Selurus in 35 BC created mayhem for a while.\nThe Roman aqueduct of Catania was the longest in Roman Sicily at , starting from the springs of Santa Maria di Licodia.\nIt retained its colonial rank, as well as its prosperity, throughout the period of the Roman Empire; so that in the 4th century Ausonius in his \"Ordo Nobilium Urbium\", notices Catania and Syracuse alone among the cities of Sicily.\nMiddle Ages.\nCatania was sacked by the Vandals of Gaiseric in 440\u2013441. After a period under the Ostrogoths, it was reconquered in 535 by the Eastern Roman Empire, under which (aside from a short period in 550\u2013555) it remained until the 9th century. It was the seat of the Byzantine governor of the island.\nCatania was under an Islamic emirate for two centuries, after which it fell to the Normans of Roger I of Sicily. Subsequently, the city was ruled by a bishop-count (1072). In 1194\u20131197 the city was sacked by German soldiers during after the conquest of the island by emperor Henry VI. In 1232 it rebelled to the former's son, Frederick II, who later built a massive castle, \"Castello Ursino\" and also made Catania a royal city, ending the dominance of the bishops.\nCatania was one of the main centers of the Sicilian Vespers revolt (1282) against the House of Anjou and was the seat of the coronation of the new Aragonese king of Sicily, Peter I. The city remained a key Sicilian port during the War of the Sicilian Vespers. After a civil revolt in 1299, the city was captured by an Angevin army, which occupied the city until the Angevins evacuated their holdings on Sicily in 1302.\nIn the 14th century it gained importance as it was chosen by the Aragonese as a Parliament and Royal seat. Here, in 1347, it was signed the treaty of peace that ended the long War of the Vesper between Aragonese and Angevines. Catania lost its capital role when, in the early 15th century, Sicily was turned into a member of the Crown of Aragon, and kept its autonomy and original privileges specially during the period from 1282 to 1410.\nIn 1434 King Alfonso V founded here the \"Siciliae Studium Generale\", the oldest university in the island.\nEarly modern times.\nWith the unification of Castile and Aragon (early 16th century), Sicily became part of the Spanish Empire. It rebelled against the foreign government in 1516 and 1647.\nIn 1669 the city's surroundings suffered great material damage from the 1669 Etna eruption. The city itself was largely saved by its walls that diverted most of the lava into the port. Afterwards, in 1693 the city was nearly completely destroyed by a heavy 1693 Sicily earthquake and its aftershocks. The city was then rebuilt in the Baroque architecture that nowadays characterizes it.\nUnified Italy.\nCatania was one of the vanguards of the movement for Sicilian autonomy in the early 19th century.\nIn 1860 Giuseppe Garibaldi's expedition of the Thousand conquered Sicily for Piedmont from the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. Since the following year Catania was part of the newly unified Italy, whose history it shares since then.\nThe first half of the twentieth century was a cycle of repeated destruction and rebuilding for the city of Catania.\nDuring the years 1923 and 1928, Catania endured two major eruptions of Mt. Etna. The 1923 eruption lasted twenty-nine days, from June 6 until June 29. A large lava flow occurred in the 1928 event and was the first to destroy a population center in over two hundred years.\nAt the onset of World War 1, Italy was part of a defensive alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary referred to as the Triple Alliance. After one year, Italy joined the Allied forces. Many promises made to secure Italy\u2019s help during the war were not kept resulting in stability issues throughout the country leading to the adoption of fascist ideations. As the second World War began, the new regime opted to support Adolf Hitler, resulting in Catania and all the surrounding areas on Sicily being destroyed by Allied bombing.\n During World War II, Catania was heavily bombed by the Allied air forces, owing to the presence of two of the main Axis airfields in Sicily (Gerbini and Fontanarossa) and for its strategically important port and marshalling yard. Altogether, the city suffered eighty-seven air raids. The heaviest took place in the spring and summer of 1943, before and during the Allied invasion of Sicily; they caused heavy damage to the city (among others, twenty-eight churches and most historic palaces suffered damage), killed 750 inhabitants and prompted most of the population to flee to the countryside. After heavy fighting across eastern Sicily, Catania was eventually captured by the British 8th Army on 5 August 1943.\nAfter the conflict, and the constitution of the Italian Republic (1946), Catania attempted to catch up with the economic and social development of Italy's richer northern regions. The problems faced in Catania were emblematic of those faced by other towns in the Mezzogiorno, namely a heavy gap in industrial development and infrastructures, and the threat of the mafia. This notwithstanding, during the 1960s (and partly during the 1990s) Catania enjoyed development and a period of economic, social, and cultural success. In the first decade of the 21st century, Catania's economic and social development somewhat faltered and the city is again facing economic and social stagnation. This was aggravated by the economic crisis left by the administration of mayor Scapagnini in 2008.\nGeography.\nAs observed by Strabo, the location of Catania at the foot of Mount Etna has been both a curse and a blessing. On the one hand, violent outbursts of the volcano throughout history have destroyed large parts of the city, while on the other hand the volcanic ashes yield fertile soil, especially suited for the growth of vines. (Strab. vi. p.\u00a0269)\nTwo subterranean rivers run under the city; the Amenano, which surfaces at one single point south of Piazza Duomo, and the Longane (or Lognina).\nClimate.\nCatania experiences a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen: \"Csa\"). The city has hot summers, one of the hottest in the whole country of Italy. Temperatures of are surpassed almost every year a couple of times.\nWinters are mild, with significant nighttime cooling. Precipitation is concentrated from October to March, leaving late spring and summer virtually dry. The city receives around of rain per year, although the amount can vary greatly from year to year, from over to under .\nDuring winter nights, lows can occasionally reach below freezing. Highs under may happen during winter. Snow, due to the presence of Etna that protects the city from the northern winds, is an uncommon occurrence, but occasional snow flurries have been seen over the recent years, especially in the hilly districts. More recently, light snowfalls occurred on 9 February 2015, 6 January 2017 and 5 January 2019, but the last heavy snowfall dates back to 17 December 1988.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAs of 2025, there are 297,517 people residing in Catania, of whom 48.3% were male and 51.7% were female. Minors total 16.6% of the population compared to pensioners who number 23.5%. This compares with the Italian average of 14.9% minors and 24.7 percent pensioners.\nThe average age of Catania residents is 41 compared to the Italian average of 42. In the 10 years between 2011 and 2021, the population of Catania increased by 2.5%, while Italy as a whole declined by 0.7%.\nThe current birth rate of Catania is 10.07 births per 1,000 inhabitants compared to the Italian average of 9.45 births. As of 2006[ [update]], 98.03% of the population was Italian. The largest immigrant groups come from Sub-Saharan Africa: 0.69%, South Asia: 0.46%, and from other European countries (particularly from Ukraine and Poland): 0.33%. There is currently a small community of Samaritans from Israel.\nAdministrative divisions.\nMetropolitan City.\nThe Metropolitan City of Catania was established in 2015 and replaced the former Province of Catania. It includes the city proper and 57 \"comuni\" (municipalities). The population of the Metropolitan City is 1,107,702.\nMetropolitan area.\nThe Metropolitan area of Catania includes the \"comune\" of Catania (311,584 inhabitants) and 26 surrounding \"comuni\" forming an urban belt (498,650 inhabitants). The total population of the Metropolitan area of Catania is therefore 810,234. The \"comuni\" of the Metropolitan area are:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThese \"comuni\" form a system with the centre of Catania sharing its economical and social life and creating an organic urban texture.\nCity proper.\nThe city of Catania proper (\"comune di Catania\") is divided in six administrative areas called \"circoscrizioni\". The current administrative setup was established in 2013, modifying previous setups dating back to 1971, 1978 and 1995.\nThe six areas are:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMain sights.\nThe symbol of the city is \"u Liotru\", or the \"Fontana dell'Elefante\", assembled in 1736 by Giovanni Battista Vaccarini. It portrays an ancient lavic stone elephant and is topped by an Egyptian obelisk from Syene. Legend has it that Vaccarini's original elephant was neuter, which the men of Catania took as an insult to their virility. To appease them, Vaccarini appropriately appended elephantine testicles to the original statue.\nThe Sicilian name \"u Liotru\" is a phonetic change of Heliodorus, a nobleman who, after trying without success to become bishop of the city, became a sorcerer and was therefore condemned to the stake. Legend has it that Heliodorus himself was the sculptor of the lava elephant and that he used to magically ride it in his fantastic travels from Catania to Constantinople. Another legend has it that Heliodorus was able to transform himself into an elephant.\nThe presence of an elephant in the history of Catania is surely connected to both zooarcheology and popular creeds. In fact, the prehistoric fauna of Sicily from the Upper Paleolithic, included dwarf elephants. Paleontologist Othenio Abel suggested that the presence of dwarf elephants in Sicily may be the origin of the legend of the Cyclops. Ancient Greeks, after finding the skulls of dwarf elephants, about twice the size of a human skull, with a large central nasal cavity (mistaken for a large single eye socket) supposed that they were skulls of giants with a single eye.\nThe \"Catanian Museum of Mineralogy, Paleontology and Vulcanology\" holds the integral unburied skeleton of an \"Elephas falconeri\" in an excellent state of conservation. The first inhabitants of Etna molded such lavic artifacts to idolize the mythical proboscidian.\nClassical buildings.\nOver the course of recorded history, the city has been buried by lava seventeen times. Beneath the present-day Catania lie the remains of the Roman city that once stood here, and below that, the earlier Greek settlement. Many ancient Roman monuments were destroyed by these repeated eruptions, but today, visitors can explore surviving ruins in the city centre, which are part of the Parco Archeologico Greco-Romano di Catania.\nAncient edifices include:\nBaroque and historical churches.\nThe Baroque heart of Catania belongs to the Late Baroque Towns of the Val di Noto, a group of cities in southeastern Sicily celebrated for their post-earthquake reconstruction.\nEconomy.\nCatania is the first economic and industrial hub of Sicily. The city is famous for its mainly petrochemical industry, and the extraction of sulphur. In the year 2000, according to Census, Catania was the 14th richest city in Italy, with a GDP of US$6.6 billion (\u20ac6.304 billion), which was 0.54% of the Italian GDP, a GDP per capita of US$21,000 (\u20ac20,100) and an average GDP per employee of US$69,000 (\u20ac66,100).\nIn the late-19th century and early-20th century, Catania began to be heavily industrialised, with its several factories and chimneys, often being referred to as Southern Italy's \"Manchester\". The economy of Catania suffered heavily from the bad effects of World War I, and was marked by an economic crisis and recession that culminated in the 1920s. Since then, the city lost its industrial and entrepreneurial importance. In the 1930s, Catania remained a small fishing town with derelict and disused industries. However, after the destruction of World War II, Catania's economy began to re-grow in the late-1950s and early-1960s. The city's economic growth was so rapid and dynamic that it was often nicknamed the \"Milan of the South\", or in Italian \"Milano del Sud\". This rapid economic growth prompted a great number of Sicilians living in the more rural areas, or smaller towns such as Enna, Ragusa and Caltanissetta, to move to the city to seek new jobs.\nToday, Catania, despite several problems, has one of the most dynamic economies in the whole of Southern Italy. It still has a strong industrial and agricultural sector, and a fast-growing tourist industry, with many international visitors coming to visit the city's main sights and the nearby Etna volcano. It contains the headquarters or important offices of companies such as STMicroelectronics, and also several chemical and pharmaceutical businesses. There have been several new business developments to further boost Catania's economy, including the construction of Etnapolis, a big shopping mall designed by Massimiliano Fuksas, the same architect who designed the FieraMilano industrial fair in Milan, or the Etna Valley, where several high-tech offices are located.\nTourism is a fast-growing industry in Catania. Lately, the administration and private companies have made several investments in the hospitality industry in order to make tourism a competitive sector in the Metropolitan City. Etnaland, a large amusement and water park located in Belpasso, is in the metropolitan area of Catania, from the city center. It is the largest of its kind in Southern Italy and attracts thousands of tourists, not only from Sicily, but also from the rest of Italy. According to Tripadvisor (2018) it is the third-largest water park in Europe.\nThe seaport of Catania is linked to the road-rail distribution hub of Bologna. In September 2020 Mercitalia Logistics opened the first full railway route to link the city to Northern Italy. It replaced an older mixed maritime-railway line.\nEducation.\nEstablished in 1434, the University of Catania is the oldest university in Sicily. Its academic nicknames are: \"Siculorum Gymnasium\" and \"Siciliae Studium Generale\". It hosts 12 faculties and over 62,000 students; and offers undergraduate and postgraduate programs.\nCatania hosts the \"Scuola superiore di Catania\", linked to the University of Catania, aimed at excellence in education; they offer undergraduate and postgraduate programs for teachers.\nCatania is home to the prestigious \"Istituto Musicale Vincenzo Bellini\" an advanced institute of musical studies (Conservatory) and the \"Accademia di Belle Arti\" an advanced institute of artistic studies. Both institutions offer programs of university level for musical and artistic education.\nCulture.\nOpera composer Vincenzo Bellini was born in Palazzo Gravina-Cruyllas in the city center, the palace now houses a museum about him. The Teatro Massimo Vincenzo Bellini, which opened in 1890, presents a variety of works through a season, which run from December to May, including the works of its namesake.\nGiovanni Verga was born in Catania in 1840. He became the greatest writer of \"Verismo\", an Italian literary movement akin to Naturalism. His novels portray life among the lower levels of Sicilian society, such as fishermen and stonemasons, and were written in a mixture of both literary language and the local dialect. Francesco Longo Mancini was a painter known for his paintings of nudes, who was born in Catania in 1880.\nThe city's patron saint is Saint Agatha, who is celebrated with religious pageantry, the Festival of Saint Agatha, on 5 February every year.\nThe city is the base of the newspaper \"La Sicilia\" and of the TV channel Antenna Sicilia, also known as the Sicilia Channel. Several other local television channels and free-press magazines have their headquarters in Catania.\nCatania hosts Etna Comics, a successful comic book convention now in its 12th edition, and the Catania Tango Festival, an international Tango event. Its 22nd edition has welcomed tango dancers from 27 different countries, confirming the festival as one of the most important international events in its genre.\nThe city is home to the Catania Jazz Festival, which typically runs for several winter months with concerts in different locations. In the late 1980s and during the 1990s Catania had an energetic and unique popular music scene. Indie pop and indie rock bands, local radio stations, and dynamic independent music record labels sprung up as a result. As a result, in those years the city experienced a vital and effervescent cultural period. Artists like Carmen Consoli and Mario Venuti, and internationally known indie rock bands like Uzeda came out of this cultural \"milieu\".\nSport.\nCatania is home to many sports clubs covering a wide range of disciplines. The most famous club is the Catania FC football team, followed by approximately half a million supporters. Another club standing out from the rest is AS Orizzonte Catania, which is the leading women's water polo club in Italy, with 25 National Championship titles (15 in a row from 1992 to 2006), and also in Europe, with 8 European Champions Cup titles.\nCatania is the most successful city in team sports in the entire south of Italy (including Sicily and Sardinia), leading (as of August 2025) with 80 National Championships titles, ahead of Naples and of Bari.\nAs for individual sports, 56 athletes from Catania have won world titles, 54 have won European titles and 139 have won national titles.\nIn the Olympic Games, over the years, Italian athletes from Catania have won a total of 7 gold medals, 8 silver medals, and 4 bronze medals.\nNational Championships Titles Teams (as of August 2025)\nChampion Cups Titles Teams (as of August 2025)\nMain Sports Facilities\nCatania holds the Catania-Etna car competition, organized by the Automobile Club d'Italia. The competition dates back to 1923 and has been taking place on a regular basis (with some gaps) from 1947. Suspended in 2010 due to a serious accident, the 46th edition is planned for the end of June 2021.\nFrom 1960 to 2011 Catania held the International event named \"Trofeo Sant'Agata\", a road running competition which took place in the streets of the city center, every year on 3 February (the day the Festival of Saint Agatha begins).\nThe city also hosted a series of International Sports Events: \nFood and cuisine.\nFood is an important part of Catania's culture and way of life. Local cuisine emphasizes several traits of Sicilian cuisine, whilst developing some of its own character.\nStreet food is one of the best ways to experience traditional dishes. Arancini are perhaps the city's most iconic: they are stuffed rice balls coated in breadcrumbs and deep fried; in Catania, they are shaped like a cone to remind of Mount Etna. Typical specialties from the city include ' (puff pastry with onion, tomato, and prosciutto filling), \"bolognese\" (a small pizza topped with tomato, mozzarella, prosciutto, and boiled egg, and covered in puff pastry), ' (deep fried dough balls with ricotta or anchovies filling).\nDuring street fairs and religious festivals, street stalls sell ' (toasted chickpeas and pumpkin seeds). Typical from old street markets are ' (cooked pork blood), ' (pork tripe), ' (pork jelly), ' (edible seaweed), and raw seafood. Horse meat is very traditional and is sold in shops called ' (\"roast it and eat it\"), which roast the meat in streetside barbecues.\nApart from street food, typical dishes from Catania are: \"pasta alla Norma\" (pasta with fried aubergine, tomato sauce and ricotta salata cheese), named after the namesake opera by Vincenzo Bellini; ' (pasta in cuttlefish ink), ' (fava beans pur\u00e9e), ' or ' (stewed cauliflower or broccoli), ' (saut\u00e9ed vegetables) and ' (a pie filled with tuma cheese) which is traditional during Christmastime.\nCatania is also famous for its \"pasticceria\" (pastries and cakes). Pastries vary according to season and to seasonal events: during the Festival of Saint Agatha, patron saint of the city, there are the ' (small cassatas) and ' (olive shaped almond paste). In Easter, there are ' (boiled eggs covered in biscuit). In summer there is granita. During the \"Festa dei morti\" (traditional celebrations in All Souls' Day) there are biscuits called ', ' and '.\nDrink kiosks are everywhere in town and serve soft drinks. Traditional soft drinks are made by mixing fruit syrups with soda and other flavors such as anisette.\nLocal products include blood oranges, pistachios from Bronte, extra-virgin olive oil, cactus fruit, cherries, grapes from Mazzarrone, strawberries from Maletto, mushrooms, honey and wine.\nTransport.\nCatania has a commercial seaport (Catania seaport), an international airport (Catania Fontanarossa), several railway stations (Catania Centrale is the main one) and it is the main node of the Sicilian motorway system.\nThe motorways serving Catania are the A18 Messina-Catania and the A19 Palermo-Catania; and the prosecution of the A18 going from Catania to Syracuse and to Gela.\nThe Circumetnea is a narrow-gauge railway that runs for from Catania around the base of Mount Etna. It attains an elevation of above sea level before descending to rejoin the coast at Giarre-Riposto to the north.\nIn the late 1990s, the first line of an underground railway (\"Metropolitana di Catania\") was built. The underground service started in 1999 and it is currently active on a route of , from the station Nesima (west of town), passing through the stations of San Nullo, Cibali, Milo, Borgo, Giuffrida, Italia, Galatea, Giovanni XXIII, to Stesicoro. The last two stations, bringing Catania's underground into the city centre, opened on 20 December 2016. The line is planned to be extended from the satellite city of Patern\u00f2 to Fontanarossa Airport.\nCatania public transport statistics.\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting on public transit in Catania on a weekday is 56 min. 13% of public transit riders ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 23 min, while 46% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is , while 3% travel for over in a single direction.\nInternational relations.\nConsulates.\nThe following countries have a consulate in Catania: Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Belgium, Finland, France, United Kingdom, Greece, Malta, the Netherlands, Romania, Senegal, Spain, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Switzerland, and Ukraine.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nCatania is twinned with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nInfluence on the planning of Adelaide, Australia.\nThe site of what was to become the major Australian city of Adelaide was surveyed and laid out by Colonel William Light, the first Surveyor-General of South Australia. In 1823, Light had fondly written of Catania: \"The two principal streets cross each other at right angles in the square in the direction of north and south and east and west. They are wide and spacious and about a mile [1.6\u00a0km] long\". This became the basis for his plan of Adelaide.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A conditionally complete lattice satisfies at least one of these properties for bounded subsets. For comparison, in a general lattice, only \"pairs\" of elements need to have a supremum and an infimum. Every non-empty finite lattice is complete, but infinite lattices may be incomplete.\nComplete lattices appear in many applications in mathematics and computer science. Both order theory and universal algebra study them as a special class of lattices.\nComplete lattices must not be confused with complete partial orders (CPOs), a more general class of partially ordered sets. More specific complete lattices are complete Boolean algebras and complete Heyting algebras (locales).\nFormal definition.\nA \"complete lattice\" is a partially ordered set (\"L\", \u2264) such that every subset \"A\" of \"L\" has both a greatest lower bound (the infimum, or \"meet\") and a least upper bound (the supremum, or \"join\") in (\"L\", \u2264).\nThe \"meet\" is denoted by formula_1, and the \"join\" by formula_2.\nIn the special case where \"A\" is the empty set, the meet of \"A\" is the greatest element of \"L\". Likewise, the join of the empty set is the least element of \"L\". Then, complete lattices form a special class of bounded lattices.\nComplete sublattices.\nA sublattice \"M\" of a complete lattice \"L\" is called a \"complete sublattice\" of \"L\" if for every subset \"A\" of \"M\" the elements formula_1 and formula_2, as defined in \"L\", are actually in \"M\".\nIf the above requirement is lessened to require only non-empty meet and joins to be in \"M\", the sublattice \"M\" is called a \"closed sublattice\" of \"L\".\nComplete semilattices.\nThe terms \"complete meet-semilattice\" or \"complete join-semilattice\" is another way to refer to complete lattices since arbitrary meets can be expressed in terms of arbitrary joins and vice versa (for details, see completeness). \nAnother usage of \"complete meet-semilattice\" refers to a meet-semilattice that is bounded complete and a complete partial order. This concept is arguably the \"most complete\" notion of a meet-semilattice that is not yet a lattice (in fact, only the top element may be missing).\nSee semilattices for further discussion between both definitions. \nConditionally Complete Lattices.\nA lattice is said to be \"conditionally complete\" if it satisfies either or both of the following properties:\nLocally finite complete lattices.\nA complete lattice \"L\" is said to be locally finite if the supremum of any infinite subset is equal to the supremal element. Denoting this supremal element \"1\", the condition is equivalently that the set formula_10 is finite for any formula_11. This notation may clash with other notation, as in the case of the lattice (N, |), i.e., the non-negative integers ordered by divisibility. In this locally finite lattice, the infimal element denoted \"0\" for the lattice theory is the number 1 in the set N and the supremal element denoted \"1\" for the lattice theory is the number 0 in the set N.\nMorphisms of complete lattices.\nThe traditional morphisms between complete lattices, taking the complete lattices as the objects of a category, are the \"complete homomorphisms\" (or \"complete lattice homomorphisms\"). These are characterized as functions that preserve all joins and all meets. Explicitly, this means that a function \"f: L\u2192M\" between two complete lattices \"L\" and \"M\" is a complete homomorphism if\nfor all subsets \"A\" of \"L\". Such functions are automatically monotonic, but the condition of being a complete homomorphism is in fact much more specific. For this reason, it can be useful to consider weaker notions of morphisms, such as those that are only required to preserve all joins (giving a category Sup) or all meets (giving a category Inf), which are indeed inequivalent conditions. These notions may also be considered as homomorphisms of complete meet-semilattices or complete join-semilattices, respectively.\nGalois connections and adjoints.\nFurthermore, morphisms that preserve all joins are equivalently characterized as the \"lower adjoint\" part of a unique Galois connection. For any pair of preorders \"X\" and \"Y\", a Galois connection is given by a pair of monotone functions \"f\" and \"g\" from \"X\" to \"Y\" such that for each pair of elements \"x\" of \"X\" and \"y\" of \"Y\"\nformula_14\nwhere \"f\" is called the \"lower adjoint\" and \"g\" is called the \"upper adjoint\". By the adjoint functor theorem, a monotone map between any pair of preorders preserves all joins if and only if it is a lower adjoint and preserves all meets if and only if it is an upper adjoint.\nAs such, each join-preserving morphism determines a unique \"upper adjoint\" in the inverse direction that preserves all meets. Hence, considering complete lattices with complete semilattice morphisms (of either type, join-preserving or meet-preserving) boils down to considering Galois connections as one's lattice morphisms. This also yields the insight that three classes of morphisms discussed above basically describe just two different categories of complete lattices: one with complete homomorphisms and one with Galois connections that captures both the meet-preserving functions (upper adjoints) and their dual join-preserving mappings (lower adjoints).\nA particularly important class of special cases arises between lattices of subsets of \"X\" and \"Y\", i.e., the power sets &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; and &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, given a function &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; from \"X\" to \"Y\". In these cases, the direct image and inverse image maps induced by &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; between the power sets are upper and lower adjoints to each other, respectively.\nFree construction and completion.\nFree \"complete semilattices\".\nThe construction of free objects depends on the chosen class of morphisms. Functions that preserve all joins (i.e. lower adjoints of Galois connections) are called \"free complete join-semilattices\".\nThe standard definition from universal algebra states that a free complete lattice over a generating set formula_15 is a complete lattice formula_16 together with a function formula_17, such that any function formula_18 from formula_15 to the underlying set of some complete lattice formula_20 can be \"factored uniquely\" through a morphism formula_21 from formula_16 to formula_20. This means that formula_24 for every element formula_25 of formula_15, and that formula_27 is the only morphism with this property. Hence, there is a functor from the category of sets and functions to the category of complete lattices and join-preserving functions which is left adjoint to the forgetful functor from complete lattices to their underlying sets.\nFree complete lattices can thus be constructed such that the complete lattice generated by some set \"formula_15\" is just the powerset formula_29, the set of all subsets of \"formula_15\" ordered by subset inclusion. The required unit formula_31 maps any element formula_25 of formula_15 to the singleton set formula_34. Given a mapping formula_18 as above, the function formula_36 is defined by\nformula_37.\nThen formula_27 transforms unions into suprema and thus preserves joins.\nThese considerations also yield a free construction for morphisms that preserve meets instead of joins (i.e. upper adjoints of Galois connections). The above can be dualized: free objects are given as powersets ordered by reverse inclusion, such that set union provides the meet operation, and the function formula_27 is defined in terms of meets instead of joins. The result of this construction is known as a \"free complete meet-semilattice\". It can be noted that these free constructions extend those that are used to obtain free semilattices, where finite sets need to be considered.\nFree complete lattices.\nThe situation for complete lattices with complete homomorphisms is more intricate. In fact, free complete lattices generally do not exist. Of course, one can formulate a word problem similar to the one for the case of lattices, but the collection of all possible words (or \"terms\") in this case would be a proper class, because arbitrary meets and joins comprise operations for argument sets of every cardinality.\nThis property in itself is not a problem: as the case of free complete semilattices above shows, it can well be that the solution of the word problem leaves only a set of equivalence classes. In other words, it is possible that the proper classes of all terms have the same meaning and are thus identified in the free construction. However, the equivalence classes for the word problem of complete lattices are \"too small,\" such that the free complete lattice would still be a proper class, which is not allowed.\nNow, one might still hope that there are some useful cases where the set of generators is sufficiently small for a free, complete lattice to exist. Unfortunately, the size limit is very low, and we have the following theorem:\n The free complete lattice on three generators does not exist; it is a proper class.\nA proof of this statement is given by Johnstone. The original argument is attributed to Alfred W. Hales; see also the article on free lattices.\nCompletion.\nIf a complete lattice is freely generated from a given \"poset\" used in place of the set of generators considered above, then one speaks of a \"completion\" of the poset. The definition of the result of this operation is similar to the above definition of free objects, where \"sets\" and \"functions\" are replaced by \"posets\" and \"monotone mappings\". Likewise, one can describe the completion process as a functor from the category of posets with monotone functions to some category of complete lattices with appropriate morphisms that are left adjoint to the forgetful functor in the converse direction.\nAs long as one considers meet- or join-preserving functions as morphisms, this can easily be achieved through the so-called Dedekind\u2013MacNeille completion. For this process, elements of the poset are mapped to (Dedekind-) \"cuts\", which can then be mapped to the underlying posets of arbitrary complete lattices in much the same way as done for sets and free complete (semi-) lattices above.\nThe aforementioned result that free complete lattices do not exist entails that an according free construction from a poset is not possible either. This is easily seen by considering posets with a discrete order, where every element only relates to itself. These are exactly the free posets on an underlying set. Would there be a free construction of complete lattices from posets, then both constructions could be composed, which contradicts the negative result above.\nRepresentation.\nG. Birkhoff's book \"Lattice Theory\" contains a very useful representation method. It associates a complete lattice to any binary relation between two sets by constructing a Galois connection from the relation, which then leads to two dually isomorphic closure systems. Closure systems are intersection-closed families of sets. When ordered by the subset relation \u2286, they are complete lattices.\nA special instance of Birkhoff's construction starts from an arbitrary poset \"(P,\u2264)\" and constructs the Galois connection from the order relation \u2264 between \"P\" and itself. The resulting complete lattice is the Dedekind-MacNeille completion. When this completion is applied to a poset that already is a complete lattice, then the result is isomorphic to the original one. Thus, we immediately find that every complete lattice is represented by Birkhoff's method, up to isomorphism.\nThe construction is utilized in formal concept analysis, where one represents real-word data by binary relations (called \"formal contexts\") and uses the associated complete lattices (called \"concept lattices\") for data analysis. The mathematics behind formal concept analysis therefore is the theory of complete lattices.\nAnother representation is obtained as follows: A subset of a complete lattice is itself a complete lattice (when ordered with the induced order) if and only if it is the image of an increasing and idempotent (but not necessarily extensive) self-map. \nThe identity mapping has these two properties. Thus all complete lattices occur.\nFurther results.\nBesides the previous representation results, there are some other statements that can be made about complete lattices, or that take a particularly simple form in this case. An example is the Knaster\u2013Tarski theorem, which states that the set of fixed points of a monotone function on a complete lattice is again a complete lattice. This is easily seen to be a generalization of the above observation about the images of increasing and idempotent functions.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The capital of the Province of Trapani, it has long been associated with the historic salt trade and has increasingly developed as a destination for tourism.\nThe municipality comprises the urban area on the peninsula and a rural hinterland to the south, separated by the municipality of Paceco, while to the north-east the built-up area merges with the lower districts of Erice. Trapani lies at the base of Monte Erice, whose slopes and summit overlook the city and provide a link to the ancient settlement of Eryx.\nHistorically, Trapani\u2019s economy was based on salt extraction and trade, together with red-coral fishing and processing, and tuna fishing and related food-processing industries. These activities were supported by its strategic position on the Mediterranean and by a natural harbour that served as the commercial outlet for Eryx. Today, the local economy is dominated by the service sector, with activities linked to public services, commerce and tourism, as well as services associated with the Port of Trapani and the city\u2019s traditional fisheries.\nHistory.\nEtymology.\nThe city was originally named \"Dr\u00e9panon\" from the Greek word for \"sickle\", because of the curving shape of its harbour.\nTwo ancient legends relate supposed mythical origins for the city and its name. In the first legend, Trapani stemmed from the sickle which fell from the hands of the goddess Demeter while she was seeking for her daughter Persephone, who had been kidnapped by Hades. The second myth features Kronos, who eviscerated his father Ouranos, god of the sky, with a sickle which, falling into the sea, created the city. In ancient times, Saturn (i.e., the Punic god Baal Hammon) was the patron god of Trapani. Today, Saturn's statue stands in a piazza in the centre of the city.\nIn Virgil's \"Aeneid\", Anchises, father of Aeneas, died in Drepanum, and after fleeing from Dido, the Trojan hero returned there to hold funeral games in his honor, known as the \"ludi novendiales\".\nFoundation.\nThe founders of the earliest settlement of Drepana were likely the Elymians, a people who inhabited western Sicily during the protohistoric era, with Eryx (modern-day Erice), one of their main centers, overlooking it from Monte Erice. The foundation of Trapani almost certainly predates the fall of Troy (1184 BC). The original village of Trapani probably arose on an island separated from the marshy mainland by a navigable channel, serving as the commercial port for Erice. Due to its favorable geographical location, Trapani quickly developed into a thriving emporium-city.\nCarthaginian influence.\nBetween the 9th and 8th centuries BC, Trapani came under Punic influence. Throughout the subsequent wars against the Greeks and Syracuse, Trapani fortified itself and remained a steadfast ally of Carthage. In 260 BC, Hamilcar arrived in Sicily, reinforced the city's defensive walls, and constructed the \"Castello di Terra\", the \"Torre Pali\", and the \"Torre Peliade\" (also known as \"Colombaia\"). He also relocated part of Erice's population to Trapani. The Carthaginian general Adherbal, who had established his military headquarters in the city, defeated the Romans in the Battle of Drepana. Together with Lilybaeum (modern-day Marsala), Drepana was among the last Carthaginian strongholds in Sicily.\nFrom Roman times to Spanish domination.\nTrapani's strategic location played a significant role during the First Punic War, notably in 249 BC, when the Carthaginians defeated the Roman fleet in the Battle of Drepana. However, a few years later, in 241 BC, the Romans under Gaius Lutatius Catulus decisively defeated the Carthaginian fleet at the Battle of the Aegates, marking the end of the war. Rome subsequently captured the city, Latinizing its name to \"Drepanum\".\nThe Romans treated Sicilian cities according to their behavior during the Punic Wars. Drepanum was categorized among the 26 \"censorial cities\" (\"civitates censoriae\"), known for their steadfast resistance against Roman forces. Consequently, Rome penalized the city for its loyalty to Carthage, leading Trapani into a period of decline and depopulation.\nAfter Roman rule, the Vandals and later the Byzantines dominated the city. However, significant growth occurred in the 9th century under Arab rule (from 827), who called the city \"Itr\u00e0binis\", \"Tar\u00e0banis\", or \"Tr\u00e0panesch\", and subsequently under the Normans, who captured Trapani in 1077 under Roger I. In these periods, Trapani flourished commercially and culturally, becoming an essential harbor during the Crusades. Throughout the Middle Ages, Trapani's port was among the most prominent in the Mediterranean; all major maritime republics (Genoa, Pisa, Venice, Amalfi) maintained consulates there. The city notably served as a strategic stopover, especially for Genoa and Pisa, en route to their North African territories.\nIn 1266, during the War of Saint Sabas, Venetian and Genoese fleets clashed in front of Trapani's harbor, with the Venetians capturing the entire Genoese fleet.\nIn 1282, after a brief period under Angevin control, Trapani played an active role in the Sicilian Vespers rebellion led by Palmiero Abate, subsequently coming under Aragonese rule. Throughout the 14th and 15th centuries, Trapani expanded, becoming the economic and political center of Western Sicily. In 1478, King Ferdinand II of Aragon honored Trapani with the title \"Invittissima\" (\"Most Invincible\"), acknowledging its steadfast resistance to the kingdom's enemies.\nIn 1516, Trapani was among the Sicilian cities that rebelled against Hugo de Moncada. The revolt was led by Don Simone Sanclemente, who briefly established himself as \"Capitano di giustizia\" (Chief Justice), effectively becoming the city's ruler for several months.\nOn August 20, 1535, Emperor Charles V arrived in Trapani after conquering Tunis. Recognizing the city's strategic importance, Charles V described Trapani as the \"Key to the Kingdom\" and swore to uphold its privileges, including the authority granted to the Senate of Trapani to confer university degrees in medicine, physics, theology, mathematics, fine arts, and law. In 1589, Trapani was formally elevated from \"Terra\" (land) to \"Civitas\" (city).\nThe 17th century was marked by decline, driven by famine-induced uprisings in 1647 and 1670\u20131673, and a severe plague outbreak in 1624. However, in the 18th century, the city's population significantly increased, growing from approximately 16,000 to 25,000 inhabitants.\nFrom Bourbon rule to fascism.\nFollowing brief periods under the House of Savoy (1713) and Habsburg rule (1720), Trapani fell under Bourbon dominion starting in the second half of the 18th century, lasting until 1860.\nIn 1756, Trapani's stonemasons were commissioned to craft the grand staircase (\"scala regia\") of the Royal Palace of Caserta. During Bourbon rule, several marshlands around Trapani were reclaimed, promoting urban development. Residents actively engaged in the commerce of salt and tuna fishing (\"tonnare\"). Trapani participated energetically in the Sicilian revolts of 1848\u20131849, which were violently suppressed. In 1861, Trapani voted in favor of joining the newly established Kingdom of Italy.\nAfter World War I, during which approximately 700 inhabitants of Trapani lost their lives, the city experienced a period of significant growth. Industries related to salt extraction, tuna fishing, wine, and olive oil production made Trapani a dynamic city, economically and culturally. In 1924, following a visit, Benito Mussolini appointed Cesare Mori as prefect of Trapani. After a little more than a year, Mori was transferred to Palermo and granted extraordinary powers to suppress Mafia activity.\nDuring World War II, Trapani became strategically important as a harbor and submarine base. Its airfields at Milo and Chinisia served as critical logistical hubs for Axis troops in North Africa. The city endured extensive bombardments, beginning with French attacks on June 22, 1940, followed by RAF raids on November 10, 1941, and May 31, 1942, as well as 27 subsequent Anglo-American bombings from January to July 1943. These air raids severely damaged Trapani, destroying its historic San Pietro neighborhood entirely and placing the city ninth among Italy\u2019s most heavily bombed provincial capitals. On July 22, 1943, General Patton's Allied forces entered Trapani, encountering a severely devastated city.\nContemporary era.\nIn the 1946 referendum, the Province of Trapani was the only one in Sicily to vote predominantly in favor of the Republic, although the city itself expressed a monarchist preference. Between 1950 and 1965, Trapani gradually revived its industrial and commercial activities, yet it never fully recovered from the post-war crisis, retreating instead into a service-oriented economy and administrative functions associated with its provincial capital status. The Belice Valley earthquake in January 1968 caused death and destruction in Trapani as well. The city also suffered fatalities in the floods of 1965 and November 5, 1976, the latter resulting in 16 deaths.\nStarting in the 1990s, Trapani proactively promoted itself as a tourist, historical, cultural, and sporting destination. This transformation involved restoring the historic city center, developing new urban infrastructure, expanding hospitality and entertainment sectors, and emphasizing its significant historic, architectural, and natural heritage.\nIn recent years, Trapani has gained international prominence by hosting major cultural exhibitions featuring artists such as Caravaggio, Leonardo da Vinci, and Michelangelo (the rediscovered Crucifix), and notable sporting events, including stages of the prestigious Louis Vuitton Cup.\nGeography.\nTrapani lies in western Sicily, roughly 100 km southwest of Palermo, on a narrow crescent-shaped peninsula projecting into the point where the Tyrrhenian Sea and the Mediterranean Sea meet. The city is set at the foot of Monte Erice and is bordered inland by coastal lowlands and historic salt-pans.\nThe peninsula.\nThe city of Trapani occupies a narrow, curved landform projecting westwards into the sea: the peninsula which gives the urban fabric its characteristic \"sickle-shape\" (from Greek \"dr\u00e9panon\", meaning sickle). Historically, the peninsula originally consisted of a promontory or even a small island separated from the mainland by a navigable channel, which was later infilled or reclaimed.\nThe western tip of the peninsula contains Trapani\u2019s historic centre and old harbour, where the city\u2019s defensive walls, bastions and towers once ringed the shoreline, notably along the Mura di Tramontana on the north side of the historic core. The peninsula is narrow and surrounded by the sea on both sides, forming an inlet and natural harbour that underpin Trapani\u2019s role as a \u201ccitt\u00e0-porto\u201d and maritime gateway in the central Mediterranean.\nMuch of the built-up peninsula is very low-lying, with the city\u2019s average elevation around 3 m above sea level. To the north a strip of sandy beach runs below the Mura di Tramontana at the edge of the historic centre, while to the south the urban area gives way to the low-lying salt-pans and wetlands of the Trapani\u2013Paceco reserve. This combination of low relief, beaches and saline basins has encouraged modern expansion mainly eastwards along the Via G.B. Fardella axis on the landward side of the peninsula.\nThe coastal plain.\nSouth of the peninsula, the municipal territory opens onto a broad coastal plain characterised by wetlands, salt-pans and low-intensity agricultural land. Much of this area forms part of the Salt pans of Trapani and Paceco reserve, a protected zone of historic salt works and shallow coastal basins noted for their windmills, birdlife and long-established salt-harvesting traditions. \nThe reserve extends across the lowland between Trapani and Paceco, covering around 1,000 ha of traditional salt works, evaporation ponds, canals and marginal wetlands, and has been managed by WWF Italy since its establishment in 1995. It is one of the last productive salt-pan complexes in Sicily and is designated as a Ramsar wetland, Special Protection Area and Special Area of Conservation. The site is an important stopover for migratory birds crossing the Strait of Sicily, including large numbers of flamingos during migration and wintering periods. \nIn 2024\u20132025 WWF Italy and other stakeholders revived proposals for a \"Parco nazionale delle Isole Egadi e del litorale trapanese\", a national park that would link the Trapani\u2013Paceco salt pans with the Egadi Islands and other Natura 2000 sites along the Trapani\u2013Marsala coast, although no formal perimeter has yet been adopted.\nFurther inland the landscape rises gently towards the rural interior, where mixed cultivation and scattered farmsteads occupy the higher ground. A freshwater reservoir has been constructed on the coastal plain to support irrigation and local water supply, contrasting with the surrounding saline environment. Overall the plain forms a transitional zone between the city\u2019s urban peninsula and the upland slopes of Monte Erice.\nMonte Erice.\nTo the east of Trapani the terrain rises abruptly to form Monte Erice, a limestone massif reaching 751 m above sea level. The mountain dominates the coastal plain and provides a natural backdrop to the city, with steep slopes descending towards the Trapani peninsula. Its summit and upper ridges host the medieval hill town of Erice, while the lower slopes are covered with Mediterranean scrub, pine plantations and traditional terraced agricultural land.\nMonte Erice has long influenced the settlement pattern around Trapani, marking the transition from the low-lying coastal landscape to the upland interior of western Sicily. The mountain also shapes local microclimates, with cooler temperatures and frequent mist or low cloud at higher elevations, and offers extensive views across the Trapani coast, the salt pans and the Aegadian Islands.\nMunicipal boundaries and urban structure.\nThe municipal territory of Trapani is divided into two distinct areas: the urban peninsula and a separate rural zone to the south. These two parts are non-contiguous, being separated by the municipality of Paceco, whose territory extends across the isthmus between them. To the north-east, however, Trapani\u2019s built-up area is continuous with the lower districts of Erice, forming a single urban agglomeration across the municipal boundary.\nThe urban area occupies the peninsula and adjoining coastal strip, characterised by linear development along the shoreline and limited room for expansion due to the sea on both sides. By contrast, the southern rural sector consists of agricultural land, scattered farmsteads and small hamlets set within the low-lying plain between Trapani and the inland hills. This discontinuous municipal structure reflects historical patterns of landholding and the later administrative separation of Trapani, Erice and Paceco.\nIn 2021 the rural districts to the east and south-east of Trapani voted to separate from the city, leading to the establishment of the new municipality of Misiliscemi. The creation of Misiliscemi removed a substantial portion of Trapani\u2019s former rural territory and contributes to the present discontinuous configuration of the municipal area. The Trapani\u2013Birgi Airport now lies within the territory of Misiliscemi (and partly in the municipality of Marsala), rather than within the municipality of Trapani.\nClimate.\nTrapani has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate. Coastal exposure keeps summer days hot and dry, but the proximity of the sea contributes to comparatively cooler nights and a generally mild winter season.\nEconomy.\nTraditional industries in Trapani have included fishing, coral harvesting, salt production and agri-food processing, but the city\u2019s economy has shifted markedly towards services in recent decades. The service sector accounts for over 58% of employment, with a predominance of public administration, logistics and tourism-related activities. Other developments include a growing visitor economy, emerging blue-economy and renewable-energy activities, and significant investment in waterfront and port-regeneration projects.\nTourism.\nTrapani\u2019s visitor economy is shaped by its coastal setting, historic port and proximity to major attractions. Its beaches, waterfront and ferry routes draw visitors to the Aegadian Islands\u2014Favignana, Levanzo and Marettimo\u2014while the city also serves as a base for excursions to Erice, Segesta and the wine-producing areas of western Sicily.\nThe Salt pans of Trapani and Paceco reserve is a key attraction, comprising around 1,000 ha of historic salt-pans and wetlands known for their windmills and seasonal birdlife.\nThe municipality has invested in regeneration projects to strengthen its tourism offer, including new pedestrian access, lighting and paving along the Mura di Tramontana as part of a wider \u20ac60-million waterfront plan. Further works include the Punta Tipa Urban Park (\u20ac5.2 million) and the redevelopment of the city\u2019s indoor retail fish market. Port facilities have also been modernised with a \u20ac7\u20138 million cruise-and-passenger terminal, reinforcing Trapani\u2019s role as a maritime gateway for western Sicily.\nAccording to the Osservatorio Turistico della Regione Siciliana, Trapani and the Aegadian Islands show strong summer seasonality, with hotel stays and island arrivals recording steady growth and an increasing share of international visitors.\nLogistics and shipping.\nThe Port of Trapani serves as an export gateway for regional products including sea salt, wine, olive oil, marble and canned tuna. In 2023 it handled about 605,833 tonnes of cargo, making logistics and maritime trade an important component of the local economy.\nThe port\u2019s facilities include a cargo terminal of approximately 25,000 m\u00b2 equipped with two 100-ton mobile cranes, four reach-stackers and associated handling equipment. Ongoing works include a \u20ac60.5 million project, funded under Italy\u2019s National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP), to deepen access channels and modernise quay facilities at the Ronciglio east pier.\nCargo throughput rose markedly in the first nine months of 2025, when 558,461 tonnes were handled, a year-on-year increase of 25.6%.\nAviation.\nTrapani\u2013Birgi Airport (TPS) contributes substantially to local employment and tourism spending, and military activities generate additional economic impact in the surrounding municipalities. \nThe airport handled 1,074,939 passengers in 2024, with continued growth driven by expanded routes and the establishment of a Ryanair operational base.\nThe airport also hosts a major military installation: it is home to the Italian Air Force\u2019s 37\u00b0 \"Stormo\" and has been designated as an international training site for the F-35 Lightning II programme, reinforcing Trapani\u2019s strategic role in the central Mediterranean.\nBusiness and innovation.\nTrapani has developed activities in the blue economy and renewable-energy sectors, supported by EU maritime programmes and local fisheries initiatives such as the FLAG \"Torri e Tonnare del Litorale Trapanese\", which promotes sustainable fisheries and small marine enterprises. The Egadi Islands Marine Protected Area also hosts research and pilot projects in marine biotechnology and aquaculture.\nThe Port of Trapani has been identified as a potential logistics and assembly hub for offshore wind and low-carbon maritime industries, with port authorities examining options for hydrogen-ready and alternative-fuel infrastructure in line with EU decarbonisation strategies. Research links are supported by the University of Palermo\u2019s Trapani campus, which conducts work in environmental sciences and coastal management. Trapani also forms part of the ZES Sicilia, offering incentives for investment in logistics and renewable-energy services.\nHousing.\nA 2025 analysis by Abitare Co. identified Trapani as the most dynamic housing market in Sicily in the first half of 2025, with 94 residential sales per 10,000 adult inhabitants and annual growth of 7.2%.\nAverage asking prices remain comparatively low: in October 2025 residential property in the municipality averaged around \u20ac931 per m\u00b2. Cost-of-living indices estimate that a single person\u2019s monthly expenses, including rent, are approximately US$1,573 (\u2248 \u20ac1,450).\nThese conditions\u2014relatively low price levels combined with rising transaction volumes\u2014have contributed to interest from retirees, second-home buyers and property investors.\nTransport.\nTrapani\u2019s transport network comprises air, sea and land links, including an international airport, ferry services, a cable car to Erice, and integrated bus and rail connections.\nAir.\nThe city is served by Trapani\u2013Birgi Airport (TPS), located about 15 km south of Trapani, which functions as one of western Sicily\u2019s principal passenger airports. It offers domestic and international flights operated mainly by low-cost carriers; Ryanair has announced the opening of an operational base at the airport from January 2026, adding based aircraft and expanding route coverage. The airport is managed by Airgest and handles over one million passengers annually. A rail link under construction will connect the terminal with Trapani and the wider Sicilian rail network.\nSea.\nThe Port of Trapani provides passenger and ferry services alongside commercial operations. A cruise and passenger terminal, completed in 2021 at a cost of about \u20ac8 million, accommodates visiting cruise liners close to the historic centre. High-speed ferry connections to the Aegadian Islands and Pantelleria operate from the fast-ferry terminal at Molo Marinella.\nPort facilities are being upgraded as part of a wider waterfront redevelopment programme, which includes a one-kilometre port\u2013city interface, a 300-metre pier and dredging of approximately 200,000 m\u00b3.\nRail.\nThe city is served by the main station at Trapani railway station (Piazza Umberto I), with regional services linking to Marsala, Mazara del Vallo and Palermo (via Castelvetrano). A major infrastructure project\u2014the restoration and electrification of the Palermo\u2013Trapani line via Milo, budgeted at \u20ac323 million and due for completion in 2026\u2014aims to shorten journey times by up to 50 minutes, eliminate level crossings in Trapani and link the airport to the rail network.\nCable car.\nThe Funivia Trapani-Erice connects the city of Trapani to Erice in around ten minutes, offering panoramic views of the salt-pans and islands. A compulsory twenty-year general overhaul commenced in early 2025, and a publicly tendered contract for the conservative refurbishment of all 42 cabins \u2014 including new transparent panels and upholstery \u2014 is due to be completed by 30 September 2026.\nBus.\nLocal and suburban bus services in Trapani are operated by ATM Trapani, linking the city centre with surrounding areas including Casa Santa and the lower districts of Erice, Paceco and the cable-car station for Erice. Regional operators such as AST and Tarantola provide inter-city routes to destinations including Marsala, Mazara del Vallo, Palermo and the airports at Palermo and Trapani\u2013Birgi.\nLandmarks.\nThe old city of Trapani dates from the later medieval or early modern periods; there are no more remains of the ancient city and many of the city's historic buildings are designed in the Baroque style. \nCulture.\nReligious traditions.\nThe city is renowned for the \"Misteri di Trapani\", a Good Friday passion procession documented since at least 1612. It is among the longest continuous religious processions in Italy, lasting from afternoon until the early hours of Saturday. The event features twenty sculptural groups depicting the Passion of Christ, created between the 17th and 18th centuries and carried through the historic centre by the traditional guilds and their \"massari\" (porters).\nThe annual feast of the Madonna di Trapani is one of the major religious-civil events of the city. The celebrations begin on 1 August with a \"quindicina\" (fifteen-day period of devotion), and reach their peak between 13 and 16 August, culminating on 16 August with a solemn pontifical Mass in the cathedral, a procession through the historic centre carrying a simulacrum of the Madonna, and fireworks over the harbour. \nThe city also honours Saint Albert of Trapani (Sant\u2019Alberto), a 13th-century Carmelite priest born in Trapani, on 7 August each year. On his feast day the town engages in liturgical celebration, a procession of his bust or relic-simulacrum, and the traditional blessing of water in memory of the miracle attributed to him. \nFestivals and events.\nTrapani hosts a range of annual cultural festivals that highlight the city\u2019s vibrant arts, music and pop-culture scene. These events attract both locals and visitors from across Sicily and beyond, and help underscore the city\u2019s role as a lively cultural hub on the western coast of the island.\nPerforming arts.\nThe principal indoor performing-arts venue in Trapani is the Teatro Maestro Tonino Pardo, located at Via Francesco Sceusa in the city centre. The theatre, reopened in December 2016 following restoration, features around 650 seats and a stage area of approximately 150 m\u00b2. Operated in collaboration with the Ente Luglio Musicale Trapanese, it hosts a diverse year-round programme of opera, concerts, dance and theatre, thereby playing a central role in the city\u2019s cultural infrastructure.\nThe Cine Teatro Ariston, in Trapani\u2019s historic centre, was entirely renovated during the COVID period, including a full refurbishment of the auditorium with new seating and acoustic systems, the introduction of a dedicated \"museum area\" displaying historic equipment, and the re-launch of a diverse 2025/26 season of theatre, comedy, music and cinema.\nLiterature.\nThe English writer Samuel Butler argued, following visits to Trapani in the late 19th century, that the city and its surrounding coastline inspired both Odysseus\u2019s homeland of Ithaca and Scheria, the land of the Phaeacians where Odysseus encounters Nausicaa, in Homer\u2019s \"Odyssey\". Butler\u2019s theory, which also proposed a female authorship for the poem, is not widely accepted by classical scholars but remains a notable example of modern literary engagement with the topography of Trapani and the western coast of Sicily.\nThe novelist Stefania Auci, born in Trapani in 1974, rose to national prominence with her historical saga \"I leoni di Sicilia\" (2019), which became a publishing phenomenon in Italy and abroad. Her work highlights Sicilian history and family enterprise, contributing significantly to Trapani\u2019s contemporary literary identity.\nAnother notable work set in the city is \"Lucio e l\u2019acqua\" (1969/2013) by Trapani-based doctor-writer Franco Di Marco. The novel, set in Trapani province in the 1960s, follows a provincial doctor navigating social and infrastructural challenges, and vividly evokes the local landscape of the city and its surroundings.\nArt.\nThe Museo d\u2019Arte Contemporanea San Rocco is housed in the former church-convent of San Rocco. Founded as a diocesan collection of contemporary religious art (Collezione DiART) in 2004 and re-installed in this location in 2012, it now displays works by over 130 artists from 22 countries, including names such as Carla Accardi, Turi Simeti and Alberto Gianquinto, and stages periodic exhibitions of Italian and international contemporary art.\nThe city\u2019s long-standing crafts tradition includes the production of finely carved red coral devotional plaques (\"capezzale\") \u2014 a form of objet d\u2019art tied to Trapani\u2019s coral-fishing and processing industries.\nTrapani was the birthplace of the Sicilian-Baroque painter Domenico La Bruna (1699-1763), whose altarpieces and fresco cycles in the city\u2019s churches attest to its role as a centre of regional artistic production.\nGastronomy.\nTrapani and its surrounding territory are known for several items listed among the \"Prodotti agroalimentari tradizionali\" (P.A.T.) of Sicily, as recognised by the Italian Ministry of Agriculture. These traditional products reflect the area\u2019s longstanding links to wheat cultivation, garlic farming, artisanal salt production and tuna processing.\nIn 2025 the Municipality of Trapani adopted its first DECO (Denominazione Comunale d\u2019Origine) regulations to protect and promote three traditional local products: \nOther products closely associated with Trapani include the \"mufuletta\", a soft round bread scented with fennel or aniseed and traditionally eaten in the city on 11 November (Saint Martin's Day); \"lattume di tonno\", the cooked and often preserved milt of bluefin tuna from the historic local \"tonnare\"; and \"cassatelle trapanesi\", small deep-fried pastry crescents filled with sweetened sheep's milk ricotta and chocolate, a characteristic dessert of the Trapani area.\nEach summer the city hosts the annual \"Stragusto\" street-food festival. Set in the historic centre, the festival brings together Mediterranean food traditions, local wines and live music, turning the city into a vibrant culinary open-air theatre. \nSport.\nFrom September 28 to October 9, 2005, Trapani was the location of Acts 8 and 9 of the Louis Vuitton Cup. This sailing race featured, among other entrants, all the boats that took part in the 2007 America's Cup.\nThe town is also the base for the local football team Trapani Calcio. Founded in 1905, they are nicknamed the Granata (the Maroons) after their kit colour. In 2010, Trapani Calcio was admitted into the 2010\u201311 Lega Pro Seconda Divisione (formerly Serie C2), ending the club's 13-year absence from the professional ranks. Subsequently, it made debut in Serie B in the 2013\u201314 season. It currently plays in Serie B with the coach Fabrizio Castori.\nInternational relations.\nTwin towns and sister cities.\nTrapani is twinned with:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

After the outbreak of the First World War, he served in the Tank Corps as a tank commander in France, and was awarded both the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) (on 18 February 1918, for his actions at the Battle of Cambrai), and the Croix de Chevalier of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur. He first entered the war zone on 26 June 1917, and was promoted to temporary lieutenant on 10 June 1918, and to acting captain on 22 March 1918, when he took command of a tank section, he retained the rank when he became second-in-command of a tank company on 19 October 1918, and relinquished it on 7 January 1919. He was demobilised on 1 September 1921, and was granted the rank of captain. The full citation for his DSO reads:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Awarded the Distinguished Service Order.\nT./2nd Lt, Wilfred Ruprecht Bion, Tank Corps.\nFor conspicuous gallantry, and devotion to duty. When in command of his tank in an attack he engaged a large number of enemy machine guns in strong positions, thus assisting the infantry to advance. When his tank was put out of action by a direct hit he occupied a section of trench with his men and machine guns and opened fire on the enemy. He moved about in the open, giving directions to other tanks when they arrived, and at one period fired a Lewis gun with great effect from the top of his tank. He also got a captured machine gun into action against the enemy, and when reinforcements arrived he took command of a company of infantry whose commander was killed. He showed magnificent courage and initiative in a most difficult situation.\n\"Bion's daughter, Parthenope...raises the question of just how (and how far) her father was shaped as an analyst by his wartime experiences...under[p]inning Bion's later concern with the coexistence of regressed or primitive proto-mental states alongside more sophisticated one\".\nEducation and early career.\nAfter World War I, Bion studied history at The Queen's College, Oxford, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1922, before studying medicine at University College London.\nInitially attracted to London by the \"strange new subject called psychoanalysis\", he met and was impressed by Wilfred Trotter, an outstanding brain surgeon who published the famous \"Instincts of the Herd in Peace and War\" in 1916, based on the horrors of the First World War. This was to prove an important influence on Bion's interest in group behaviour. Having qualified in medicine by means of the Conjoint Diploma (MRCS England, LRCP London) in 1930 Bion spent seven years in psychotherapeutic training at the Tavistock Clinic, an experience he regarded, in retrospect, as having had some limitations. It did, however, bring him into fruitful contact with Samuel Beckett. He wanted to train in Psychoanalysis and in 1938 he began a training analysis with John Rickman, but this was brought to an end by the advent of the Second World War.\nBion was recommissioned in the Royal Army Medical Corps as a lieutenant on 1 April 1940, and worked in a number of military hospitals including Northfield Military Hospital (Hollymoor Hospital, Birmingham) where he initiated the first Northfield Experiment. These ideas on the psychoanalysis of groups were then taken up and developed by others such as S. H. Foulkes, Rickman, Bridger, Main and Patrick De Mare. The entire group at Tavistock had in fact been taken into the army, and were working on new methods of treatment for psychiatric casualties (those suffering post-traumatic stress, or \"shell shock\" as it was then known.) Out of this his pioneering work in group dynamics, associated with the \"Tavistock group\", Bion's papers describing his work of the 1940s were compiled much later and appeared together in 1961 in his influential book, \"Experiences in Groups and other papers.\" It was less a guide for the therapy of individuals within or by the group, than an exploration of the processes set off by the complex experience of being in a group. The book quickly became a touchstone work for applications of group theory in a wide variety of fields.\nIn 1945, during the Second World War, Bion's wife Betty Jardine gave birth to a daughter, but Betty died a few days afterwards. His daughter, Parthenope, became a psychoanalyst in Italy, and often lectured and wrote about her father's work. Parthenope died, together with her 18-year-old daughter Patrizia, in a car crash in Italy in July 1998.\nLater career.\nReturning to the Tavistock Clinic, Bion chaired the Planning Committee that reorganized the Tavistock into the new Tavistock Institute of Human Relations, alongside a new Tavistock Clinic which was part of the newly launched National Health Service. As his interest in psychoanalysis increased, he underwent training analysis, between 1946 and 1952, with Melanie Klein. He met his second wife, Francesca, at the Tavistock in 1951. He joined a research group of Klein's students (including Hanna Segal and Herbert Rosenfeld), who were developing Klein's theory of the paranoid-schizoid and the depressive positions, for use in the analysis of patients with psychotic disorders. He produced a series of highly original and influential papers (collected as \"Second Thoughts\", 1967) on the analysis of schizophrenia, and the specifically cognitive, perceptual, and identity problems of such patients. To this he added a valuable final section called Commentary, showing how some of his views on clinical and theoretical matters had changed.\nBion's theories, which were always based in the phenomena of the analytic encounter, revealed both correspondences and expansions of core ideas from both Sigmund Freud and Melanie Klein. At one point, he attempted to understand thoughts and thinking from an 'algebraic', 'geometric' and 'mathematised' point of view, believing there to be too little precision in the existing vocabulary, a process culminating in \"The Grid\". Later he abandoned the complex, abstract applications of mathematics, and the Grid, and developed a more intuitive approach, epitomised in \"Attention and Interpretation\" (1970).\nIn 1968, Bion moved to Los Angeles, California, where he remained until 1977. During those years he mentored a number of psychoanalysts interested in Kleinian approaches, including James Gooch (psychoanalyst) and other founding members of the Psychoanalytic Center of California. Shortly before his death, he returned to Oxfordshire.\nReception and stature.\nBion left a reputation which has grown steadily both in Britain and internationally. Some commentators consider that his writings are often gnomic and irritating, but never fail to stimulate. He defies categorisation as a follower of Klein or of Freud. While Bion is most well known outside of the psychoanalytic community for his work on group dynamics, the psychoanalytic conversation that explores his work is mainly concerned with his theory of thinking, and his model of the development of a capacity for thought.\nWilfred Bion was a potent and original contributor to psychoanalysis. He was one of the first to analyse patients in psychotic states using an unmodified analytic technique; he extended existing theories of projective processes and developed new conceptual tools. The degree of collaboration between Hanna Segal, Wilfred Bion and Herbert Rosenfeld in their work with psychotic patients during the late 1950s, and their discussions with Melanie Klein at the time, means that it is not always possible to distinguish their exact individual contributions to the developing theory of splitting, projective identification, unconscious phantasy and the use of countertransference. As Donald Meltzer (1979, 1981), Denis Carpy (1989, p.\u00a0287), and Michael Feldman (2009, pp.\u00a033, 42) have pointed out, these three pioneering analysts not only sustained Klein's clinical and theoretical approach, but through an extension of the concept of projective identification and countertransference they deepened and expanded it. In Bion's clinical work and supervision the goal remains insightful understanding of psychic reality through a disciplined experiencing of the transference\u2013countertransference, in a way that promotes the growth of the whole personality.\n'Bion's ideas are highly unique', so that he 'remained larger than life to almost all who encountered him'. He has been considered by Neville Symington as possibly \"the greatest psychoanalytic thinker...after Freud\".\nBion's work has left a strong impression on a number of contemporary psychoanalytic thinkers, including Antonino Ferro, Thomas Ogden, or Elias Mallet da Rocha Barros.\nThere is some historical evidence to suggest that the idea of containment may have been suggested to Bion in the mid-1930s, by\u00a0an encounter with C.G.Jung: Bion attended Jung's 1935 lectures at the Tavistock Clinic, in which Bion was an active participant (asking three questions of Jung about a range of aspects of Jung's thinking). The experience was described by James Grotstein, Bion's biographer and \"one of Bion's most influential pupils\", as having had a \"dramatic impact\" on Bion.\nGroup experiments.\nBion performed a lot of group experiments when he was put in charge of the training wing of a military hospital. Besides observing the basic assumptions recurring in these groups, he also has observed some very interesting phenomena which he believed may well apply to society.\nAbout his experiences in groups, Bion wrote: \"Judged by ordinary standards of social intercourse, the performance of the group is almost devoid of intellectual content. Furthermore, if we note how assumptions pass unchallenged as statements of fact, and are accepted as such, it seems clear that critical judgment is almost entirely absent.\" He explained this observation by calling attention to the presence of unconscious motivations underlying group behaviour. This observation agrees with Gustave Le Bon's findings about groups to which he mentioned in his book \"\".\nBion also claimed that \"...what the individual says or does in a group illumines both his own personality and his view of the group; sometimes his contribution illumines one more than the other.\" This observation is related to the psychological phenomenon of projection.\nBion posited the presence of \"anonymous\" contributions to a group as the foundations for \"a successful system of evasion and denial\". A related phenomenon is that of \"deindividuation\".\nIn \"Experiences in Groups\", Bion asserted that whenever a group is formed, it seeks a leader to follow. Moreover, he claimed that in the absence of a formal leader who satisfies the group, the most mentally ill member of the group will be treated as an informal leader: \"In its search for a leader the group finds a paranoid schizophrenic or malignant hysteric if possible; failing either of these, a psychopathic personality with delinquent trends will do; failing a psychopathic personality it will pick on the verbally facile high-grade defective.\"\nGroup dynamics\u2014the \"basic assumptions\".\nWilfred Bion's observations about the role of group processes in group dynamics are set out in \"Experiences in Groups and Other Papers,\" written in the 1940s but compiled and published in 1961, where he refers to recurrent emotional states of groups as 'basic assumptions'. Bion argues that in every group, two groups are actually present: the \"work group\", and the \"basic assumption group\". The work group is that aspect of group functioning which has to do with the primary task of the group\u2014what the group has formed to accomplish; will \"keep the group anchored to a sophisticated and rational level of behaviour\". The basic assumption group describes the tacit underlying assumptions on which the behaviour of the group is based. Bion specifically identified three basic assumptions: \"dependency\", \"fight\u2013flight\", and \"pairing\". When a group adopts any one of these basic assumptions, it interferes with the task the group is attempting to accomplish. Bion believed that interpretation by the therapist of this aspect of group dynamics would, whilst being resisted, also result in potential insight regarding effective, co-operative group work.\nIn \"dependency\", the essential aim of the group is to attain security through, and have its members protected by, one individual. The basic assumption in this group culture seems to be that an external object exists whose function it is to provide security for the immature individual. The group members behave passively, and act as though the leader, by contrast, is omnipotent and omniscient. For example, the leader may pose a question only to be greeted with docile silence, as though he or she had not spoken at all. The leader may be idealized into a kind of god who can take care of his or her children, and some especially ambitious leaders may be susceptible to this role. Resentment at being dependent may eventually lead the group members to \"take down\" the leader, and then search for a new leader to repeat the process.\nIn the basic assumption of \"fight\u2013flight\", the group behaves as though it has met to preserve itself at all costs, and that this can only be done by running away from someone or fighting someone or something. In fight, the group may be characterized by aggressiveness and hostility; in flight, the group may chit-chat, tell stories, arrive late or any other activities that serve to avoid addressing the task at hand. The leader for this sort of group is one who can mobilize the group for attack, or lead it in flight.\nThe final basic assumption group, \"pairing\", exists on the assumption that the group has met for the purpose of reproduction\u2014the basic assumption that two people can be met together for only one purpose, and that a sexual one'. Two people, regardless the sex of either, carry out the work of the group through their continued interaction. The remaining group members listen eagerly and attentively with a sense of relief and hopeful anticipation.\nBion considered that \"the three basic-assumption groups seem each in turn to be aggregates of individuals sharing out between them the characteristics of one character in the Oedipal situation\". Behind the Oedipal level, however, Bion postulated the existence of still more primitive, part-object phantasies; and \"the more disturbed the group, the more easily discernible are these primitive phantasies and mechanisms\". Such phantasies would prove the main focus of Bion's interest after his second analysis.\nBion on thinking.\n\"During the 1950s and 1960s, Bion transformed Melanie Klein's theories of infantile phantasy...into an epistemological \"theory of thinking\" of his own.\" Bion used as his starting point the phenomenology of the analytic hour, highlighting the two principles of \"the emergence of truth and mental growth. The mind grows through exposure to truth.\" The foundation for both mental development and truth are, for Bion, emotional experience.\nThe evolution of emotional experience into the capacity for thought, and the potential derailment of this process, are the primary phenomena described in Bion's model. Through his hypothesized alpha and beta elements, Bion provides a language to help one think about what is occurring during the analytic hour. These tools are intended for use outside the hour in the clinician's reflective process. To attempt to apply his models during the analytic session violates the basic principle whereby \"Bion had advocated starting every session 'without memory, desire or understanding'\u2014his antidote to those intrusive influences that otherwise threaten to distort the analytic process.\"\nAlpha elements, beta elements, and alpha function.\nBion created a theory of thinking based on changing beta elements (unmetabolized psyche/soma/affective experience) into alpha elements (thoughts that can be thought by the thinker). Beta elements were seen as cognate to the underpinnings of the \"basic assumptions\" identified in his work with groups: \"the fundamental anxieties that underlie the basic assumption group resistances were originally thought of as \"proto-mental phenomena\"...forerunners of Bion's later concept of beta-elements.\" They were equally conceptual developments from his work on projective identification\u2014from the \"minutely split 'particles'\" Bion saw as expelled in pathological projective identification by the psychotic, who would then go on to \"lodge them in the angry, so-called bizarre objects by which he feels persecuted and controlled\". For \"these raw bits of experience he called beta-elements...to be actively handled and made use of by the mind they must, through what Bion calls alpha-functions, become alpha-elements\".\n\u03b2 elements, \u03b1 elements and \u03b1 function are elements that Bion (1963) hypothesizes. He does not consider \u03b2-elements, \u03b1- elements, nor \u03b1 function to actually exist. The terms are instead tools for thinking about what is being observed. They are elements whose qualities remain unsaturated, meaning we cannot know the full extent or scope of their meaning, so they are intended as tools for thought rather than real things to be accepted at face value (1962, p.\u00a03).\nBion took for granted that the infant requires a mind to help it tolerate and organize experience. For Bion, thoughts exist prior to the development of an apparatus for thinking. The apparatus for thinking, the capacity to have thoughts \"has to be called into existence to cope with thoughts\" (1967, p.\u00a0111). Thoughts exist prior to their realization. Thinking, the capacity to think the thoughts which already exist, develops through another mind providing \u03b1-function (1962, p.\u00a083)\u2014through the \"container\" role of maternal reverie.\nTo learn from experience alpha-function must operate on the awareness of the emotional experience; alpha\u2013elements are produced from the impressions of the experience; these are thus made storable and available for dream thoughts and for unconscious waking thinking... If there are only beta-elements, which cannot be made unconscious, there can be no repression, suppression, or learning. (Bion, 1962, p.\u00a08)\n\u03b1-function works upon undigested facts, impressions, and sensations, that cannot be mentalized\u2014beta-elements. \u03b1-function digests \u03b2-elements, making them available for thought (1962, pp.\u00a06\u20137).\nBeta-elements are not amenable to use in dream thoughts but are suited for use in projective identification. They are influential in producing acting out. These are objects that can be evacuated or used for a kind of thinking that depends on manipulation of what are felt to be things in themselves as if to substitute such manipulations for words or ideas... Alpha-function transforms sense impressions into alpha-elements which resemble, and may in fact be identical with, the visual images with which we are familiar in dreams, namely, the elements that Freud regards as yielding their latent content when the analyst has interpreted them. Failure of alpha-function means the patient cannot dream and therefore cannot sleep. As alpha-function makes the sense impressions of the emotional experience available for conscious and dream\u2014thought the patient who cannot dream cannot go to sleep and cannot wake up. (1962, pp. 6\u20137)\nBizarre object.\nBizarre objects, according to Bion, are impressions of external objects which, by way of projective identification, form a \"screen\" that's imbued with characteristics of the subject's own personality; they form part of his interpretation of object relations theory. Bion saw psychotic attacks on the normal linking between objects as producing a fractured world, where the patient felt themselves surrounded by hostile bizarre objects\u2014the by-products of the broken linkages. Such objects, with their superego components, blur the boundary of internal and external, and impose a kind of externalised moralism on their victims. They can also contain ego-functions that have been evacuated from the self as part of the defence against thinking, sensing, and coming to terms with reality: thus a man may feel watched by his telephone, or that the music player being listened to is in fact listening to him in turn.\nLater developments.\nHanna Segal considered bizarre objects more difficult to re-internalise than either good or bad objects due to their splintered state: grouped together in a mass or psychic gang, their threatening properties may contribute to agoraphobia.\nKnowledge, love and hate.\nSuccessful application of alpha-function leads to \"the capacity to tolerate the actual frustration involved in learning (\"K\") that [Bion] calls 'learning from experience'\". The opposite of knowledge \"K\" was what Bion termed \"\u2212K\": \"the process that strips, denudes, and devalues persons, experiences, and ideas.\"\nBoth K and \u2212K interact for Bion with Love and Hate, as links within the analytic relationship. \"The complexities of the emotional link, whether Love or Hate or Knowledge [L, H, and K \u2013 the Bionic relational triad]\" produce ever-changing \"atmospheric\" effects in the analytic situation. The patient's focus may wish to be \"on Love and Hate (L and H) rather than the knowledge (K) that is properly at stake in psychoanalytic inquiry.\"\nFor Bion, \"knowledge is not a thing we have, but a link between ourselves and what we know ... K is being willing to know but not insisting on knowledge.\" By contrast, -K is \"not just ignorance but the active avoidance of knowledge, or even the wish to destroy the capacity for it\" \u2013 and \"enacts what 'Attacks on Linking' identifies as hatred of emotion, hatred of reality, hatred of life itself.\"\nLooking for the source of such hate (H), Bion notes in \"Learning from Experience\" that, \"Inevitably one wonders at various points in the investigation why such a phenomenon as that represented by \u2212K should exist. ... I shall consider one factor only \u2013 Envy. By this term I mean the phenomenon described by Melanie Klein in \"Envy and Gratitude\"\" (1962, p.\u00a096).\nReversible perspective and \u2212K.\n\"Reversible Perspective\" was a term coined by Bion to illuminate \"a peculiar and deadly form of analytic \"impasse\" which defends against psychic pain\". It represents the clash of \"two independently experienced views or phenomena whose meanings are incompatible\". In Bion's own words, \"Reversible perspective is evidence of pain; the patient reverses perspective so as to make a dynamic situation static.\"\nAs summarised by Etchegoyen, \"Reversible perspective is an extreme case of rigidity of thought. ... As Bion says, what is most characteristic in such cases is the manifest accord and the latent discord.\" In clinical contexts, what may happen is that the analyst's \"interpretation is accepted, but the \"premises have been rejected\" ... the actual specificity, the substance of the interpretation\". Reversible perspective is an aspect of \"the potential destruction and deformation of knowledge\" \u2013 one of the attacks on linking of \u2212K.\nO: The ineffable.\nAs his thought continued to develop, Bion came to use \"Negative Capability\" and the suspension of Memory and Desire in his work as an analyst, in order to investigate psychic reality - which he regarded as essentially 'non-sensuous' (1970). Following his 1965 book Transformations he had an increasing interest in what he termed the domain of \"O\" \u2013 the unknowable, or ultimate Truth. \"In aesthetics, Bion has been described as a neo-Kantian for whom reality, or the thing-in-itself (O), cannot be known, only be \"be-ed\" (1965). What can be known is said by Bion to be in the realm of K, impinging through its sensory channels. If the observer can desist from \"irritably reaching for fact and reason\", and suspend the normal operation of the faculties of memory and apperception, what Bion called transformations in knowledge can permit an 'evolution' where transformations in K touch on transformations in Being (O). Bion believed such moments to feel both ominous and turbulent, threatening a loss of anchorage in everyday 'narrative' security.\nBion would speak of \"an intense catastrophic emotional explosion O,\" which could only be known through its aftereffects. Where before he had privileged the domain of knowledge (K), now he would speak as well of \"resistance to the shift from transformations involving K (knowledge) to transformations involving O ... resistance to the unknowable\". Hence his injunctions to the analyst to eschew memory and desire, to \"bring to bear a diminution of the 'light' \u2013 a penetrating beam of darkness; a reciprocal of the searchlight. If any object existed, however faint, it would show up very clearly\". In stating this he was making connections to Freud, who in a letter to Lou Andreas Salome had referred to a mental counterpart of scotopic, \"mole like vision\", used to gain impressions of the Unconscious. He was also making links with the \"apophatic\" method used by contemplative thinkers such as St John of the Cross, a writer quoted many times by Bion. Bion was well aware that our perception and our attention often blind us to what genuinely and strikingly is new in every moment.\nContainment theory.\nBion's concept of containment, first developed in his 1962 book \"Learning from Experience\", represents one of his most significant contributions to psychoanalytic theory. The theory describes a psychological process whereby one person (the container) receives and processes the unbearable feelings and experiences of another (the contained).\nOrigins and development.\nThe containment model emerged from Bion's observations of the mother-infant relationship and his clinical work with psychotic patients. Drawing on Melanie Klein's concept of projective identification, Bion expanded it from a defensive mechanism to a communicative process essential for psychological development. He proposed that the mother serves as a psychological \"container\" for the infant's primitive anxieties and unprocessed emotional experiences (which he termed \"beta elements\"). \nBion used the notation \"\u2640\ufe0e\u2642\ufe0e\" to represent the container\u2013contained relationship, describing the dynamic interplay between:\nMaternal reverie and alpha function.\nCentral to containment theory is Bion's concept of \"maternal reverie,\" which describes the mother's receptive state of mind that allows her to receive the infant's projections. Through what Bion termed \"alpha function,\" the mother processes the infant's raw sensory data and emotional experiences (beta elements) into manageable, thinkable forms (alpha elements) that can be re-introjected by the infant. Failure of adequate containment may lead to what Bion described as \"nameless dread\" \u2013 primitive anxieties that cannot be processed or thought about.\nApplication to psychoanalysis.\nIn clinical practice, the analyst functions as a container for the patient's unbearable emotions and experiences. Bion emphasized that this process requires the analyst to maintain a state of mind free from \"memory and desire\" to fully receive the patient's projections. Through containment, patients gradually develop their own capacity to contain and process difficult emotional experiences.\nLate Bion.\n\"For the later Bion, the psychoanalytic encounter was itself a site of turbulence, 'a mental space for further ideas which may yet be developed'.\" In his unorthodox quest to maintain such \"mental space\", Bion \"spent the final years of his long and distinguished professional life [writing] a futuristic trilogy in which he is answerable to no one but himself, \"A Memoir of the Future\".\"\nIf we accept that \"Bion introduced a new form of pedagogy in his writings...[via] the density and non-linearity of his prose\", it comes perhaps to a peak here in what he himself termed \"a fictitious account of psychoanalysis including an artificially constructed dream ... science fiction\". We may conclude at least that he achieved his stated goal therein: \"To prevent someone who KNOWS from filling the empty space\".\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was destroyed by the 1968 Belice earthquake.\nThe new city, Gibellina Nuova, was rebuilt some from the old one and it was designed by some of the most prominent artists and architects in Italy. They were summoned by Ludovico Corrao to provide works of art to the city in order to help build it up as an eccentric museum \"en plein air\".

{"id": "44781", "revid": "48697968", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44781", "title": "Erice", "text": "Erice (; ) is a (municipality) contiguous with the provincial capital Trapani, in western Sicily. Its historic core occupies the site of the ancient city of Eryx, one of the most significant archaeological and religious centres in pre-Roman western Sicily.\nLocated on the summit of Monte Erice, the city developed around a site that later became a prominent religious and military stronghold for the Carthaginians and Romans. It retains its medieval layout and architecture, with few modern interventions, and occupies a natural vantage point that historically offered strategic control over the Strait of Sicily and the western coastline.\nThe municipality includes both the hilltop centre and a number of modern lower districts, some of which extend to the Tyrrhenian coast, as well as small agricultural \"frazioni\" (hamlets) on the surrounding foothills.\nErice is a member of \"I Borghi pi\u00f9 belli d'Italia\" (The Most Beautiful Villages of Italy), an association that recognises towns of notable historical and architectural interest. It has at times been mentioned in the local media as a potential candidate for UNESCO World Heritage Site status.\nHistory.\nAntiquity.\nThe earliest occupation of the hilltop is debated, but settlement likely began in the early first millennium BCE. Under the Elymians, who called the site \"Irka\", the community established fortifications and a sanctuary on the summit.\nWith the arrival of the Phoenicians in western Sicily during the early Iron Age (attested by the early 8th century BCE at nearby Motya) and, later, Carthaginian control (from the late 6th century BCE until the Roman annexation in 241 BCE), the settlement developed within a circuit now known as the Elymian\u2013Punic walls. Excavations distinguish an Elymian phase and a Punic rebuilding, including squared blocks bearing Punic mason\u2019s marks; the oldest quarter of the city preserves a capillary network of narrow, irregular lanes often interpreted as part of a defensive, escape-oriented layout.\nThe Greeks (attested from the 5th century BCE) and Romans (after the Roman annexation in 241 BCE) called the settlement \"Eryx\". Within the largely irregular historic street network, Via San Francesco is a notably straight alignment; Caracciolo has interpreted it as evidence of very ancient planning. Excavations and surveys document several ancient construction phases at the sanctuary on the summit.\nMedieval period.\nThe modern settlement of Erice began in the Norman period, when the summit was re-fortified as the Norman Castle of Venus. In the same centuries the kingdom\u2019s ventures in Ifriqiya (1148\u20131160s) heightened the strategic weight of western Sicily\u2019s heights and sea lanes, with Erice again serving as a defensive stronghold over the Strait of Sicily. During this period the town came to be known as \"Monte San Giuliano\" (by tradition since the Norman conquest). In later medieval sources it appears as a royal demesne (\"citt\u00e0 demaniale\"): in 1413 its \"universitas\" petitioned for the royal appointment of a captain and castellan, underscoring direct crown control rather than feudal lordship.\nThe 12th-century traveller Ibn Giubayr described abundant springs, cultivated fields, vineyards, and a fortress accessible by a bridge. Monte San Giuliano held an intermediate status in the territorial hierarchy, positioned between a \"civitas\" and a \"casale\", and was classified as a \"terra\" (land).\nThe Norman fortress anchored the upper citadel, with the Balio Towers serving as its fortified gateway. A second hub formed around the Mother Church, and a third around the Palazzo Giuratorio, seat of the \"giurati\" (sworn civic magistrates). The town\u2019s fabric coalesced around these three nodes, linked by the \u201cRoyal Road\u201d (now Via Albertina degli Abati) and the \u201cGreat Road\u201d (now Via Vittorio Emanuele II). Wealthy families consolidated plots by combining neighbouring properties.\nBy the late 13th\u201314th centuries a parish network and several monastic houses reinforced this layout, further anchoring the three hubs (see Religious significance).\nEarly modern and Bourbon period (16th\u201319th centuries).\nFrom the 1500s Sicily formed part of Habsburg Spain via the Crown of Aragon, governed as a Spanish viceroyalty. In 1713 the island passed to the House of Savoy under the Treaty of Utrecht; in 1720 Victor Amadeus II exchanged Sicily for Sardinia, transferring Sicily to the Habsburg monarchy. In practice, society remained strongly aristocratic: feudal and ecclesiastical estates dominated landholding and local power well into the modern era, especially in Sicily, where large latifundia and church property were prominent.\nWithin this framework Erice prospered: its population rose from 7,657 in 1584 to about 12,000 by the late 1600s, and the town controlled much of the surrounding countryside. Many palaces and churches date to this period, and the patterned cobbled paving laid with small stones became a defining feature of the historic centre. To meet Spanish billeting obligations (\"posata\"), townspeople funded the Spanish Quarter, a barracks begun on the town\u2019s northern edge in the early 17th century and abandoned in 1632, after which troops were housed in the Castle of Venus.\nIn 1734 Charles of Bourbon conquered Naples and Sicily; Bourbon rule continued thereafter, and in December 1816 the two kingdoms were formally unified as the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, which lasted until 1860\u201361. Bourbon land policies redistributed parts of the \"demanio\" (public lands) through \"emphyteusis\"\u2014long leases that transferred cultivation rights while reserving ultimate ownership\u2014encouraging new rural settlements such as Custonaci and San Vito Lo Capo. As administrative functions consolidated in Trapani, noble families and residents relocated, and the hilltop town became increasingly depopulated and economically peripheral. \nIn 1860, during the Sicilian phase of the Risorgimento, Erice supplied volunteers to Giuseppe Garibaldi\u2019s campaign. Local patriot Giuseppe Coppola led the town\u2019s volunteers\u2014\"875 men from Erice\", as a civic plaque records\u2014and fought at the Battle of Calatafimi before helping expel the Bourbon garrison from Trapani. Among the Ericine fallen was the physician Rocco La Russa Peraino, killed at the Ponte dell'Ammiraglio in Palermo on 27 May 1860; both men are commemorated by plaques in Erice. The suppression of monasteries by the Italian state after unification in the late 19th century further altered the town\u2019s institutions and urban fabric.\nVilleggiatura and salons (c. 1870\u20131930s).\nFrom the late 19th century Erice entered a new phase of prosperity shaped by the culture of \"villeggiatura\"\u2014the seasonal retreat of wealthy families to hill towns during the summer. The town\u2019s altitude and cool breezes made it a favoured refuge from the heat of the lowlands, attracting not only residents of Trapani and Palermo but also expatriate Sicilian families from North Africa, including Tunis and Cairo.\nInstitutional life shifted at this time: civic functions moved from the medieval Balio Towers to the newly built Palazzo Municipale, and a piazza was created in front of it as the town\u2019s modern civic centre. The Balio complex was reimagined as a public garden under the patronage of Count Agostino Sieri Pepoli, who leased the towers in the 1870s, laid out the landscaped Balio Gardens, and constructed the neo-Gothic Pepoli Turret as a retreat for study and cultural exchange. The turret became a venue for cultural gatherings, hosting writers, scholars, and musicians of the period. \nBy the early 20th century, civic cultural infrastructure expanded: the Cordici Museum was founded in 1876 and later housed (from 1939) in the upper floors of the town hall, in rooms that had formerly served as the municipal theatre, while the Vito Carvini Municipal Library was formed from suppressed convent collections after unification.\nThese decades also marked the beginnings of organised tourism, with the appearance of guesthouses and small hotels catering to seasonal visitors. The Grand Hotel Igea, opened in 1927\u201328, attracted figures from Sicilian aristocratic, cultural, business, and political circles, and for many years was a symbol of tourism in Erice. Though the tradition of \"villeggiatura\" declined in the 20th century with changing patterns of mobility and leisure, the architecture and public spaces of this period remain distinctive features of Erice.\nIn 1934 the town\u2019s name was officially changed from Monte San Giuliano to Erice. During the Second World War, in 1943, a Luftwaffe operations post associated with \"Zerst\u00f6rergeschwader 26\" and \"Jagdgeschwader 27\"\u2014units flying from nearby Trapani\u2013Milo Airport\u2014was positioned on the slopes of Monte Erice until Allied air raids forced its relocation. After the Allied landings in July 1943, elements of the 2nd Battalion, 505th Infantry Regiment (U.S. Seventh Army) advanced up Monte Erice; Italian forces occupying the ramparts surrendered after initial exchanges of fire. Erice ended the war largely unscathed, with its historic character intact.\nIntellectualism (since 1962).\nThe post-war decades brought new accessibility: a cable car linking Trapani to Erice\u2014first opened in 1956 and re-inaugurated on 8 July 2005\u2014made the hilltop readily reachable for day-trippers and routine travel between the lower districts and the historic centre.\nIn 1962 the physicist Antonino Zichichi founded the Ettore Majorana Foundation and Centre for Scientific Culture in Erice, establishing a year-round centre for international scientific schools and meetings. The Majorana Foundation has hosted residential schools and workshops that attracted scholars from around the world, including Nobel laureates such as Paul Dirac, Steven Weinberg, and Carlo Rubbia.\nCourses have ranged across disciplines\u2014from particle physics to ethics, microelectronics, and nutrition\u2014and have produced declarations such as the Erice statement on the responsibilities of science.\nThe Foundation\u2019s science-for-peace vocation has been acknowledged internationally; the Erice initiatives drew the attention of world leaders including Ronald Reagan, Mikhail Gorbachev, Pierre Trudeau, Olof Palme and Sandro Pertini.\nThe Istituto di Istruzione Superiore Ignazio e Vincenzo Florio (a state hospitality and catering school; IPSEOA \u201cFlorio\u201d) opened \"Officucina\" teaching labs at Palazzo Sales (the former Santa Teresa monastery) in 2019 and expanded its learning spaces in 2024 under Italy\u2019s National Recovery and Resilience Plan (PNRR). The \"Officucina\" are purpose-built culinary laboratories\u2014professional teaching kitchens designed for food innovation projects and hands-on training.\nIn the 2020s the school expanded its facilities in the historic centre, opening boarding facilities (\"convitto\") in the former San Carlo monastery and the former Grand Hotel Igea. The school hosts public demonstrations and masterclasses led by visiting chefs and notable alumni. Guests have included American television chef Marc Murphy, Michelin-starred chef Giuseppe Costa of \"Il Bavaglino\", and television chef Fabio Potenzano; the institute has also hosted an Erasmus+ bakery and chocolate masterclass with Belgian chefs Stijn Van Kerckhoven and Gilles Discart.\nReligious significance.\nPre-Christian origins.\nBy the fifth century BCE, the indigenous Elymians living on the mountain had a sacred place on the summit. Later in the century, in 415 BCE, people from nearby Segesta led Athenian visitors up to see it and showed them silver bowls, ladles and incense burners as proof of wealth. Greek writers in the late fifth century BCE refer to it as \u201cthe temple of Aphrodite at Eryx\u201d. Aphrodite is the Greek goddess of love and beauty. \u201cEryx\u201d is the Greek name for the mountain. \nLater Greek writers wove the summit site into their stories. Diodorus Siculus (1st century BCE) recounts a tale that the craftsman Daedalus built a wall on the crag by the temple and even fashioned a golden ram for the goddess at Mount Eryx. Strabo (early 1st century CE) notes the temple\u2019s wide renown and says that in earlier times many attendants had been dedicated there by people from Sicily and from abroad. Together these accounts show how famous the hilltop sanctuary was in Greek writing.\nRoman veneration.\nIn Roman usage the goddess was called Venus Erycina (\u201cVenus of Eryx\u201d). A Roman coin from 57 BCE shows the sanctuary as a small temple with four front columns, set on a rocky summit within a walled precinct. Coin images are not architectural plans, but they suggest how Romans pictured the hilltop shrine.\nRome later founded two public temples in her honour\u2014one on the Capitoline Hill (dedicated 215 BCE) and another outside the Porta Collina on the Quirinal (vowed 184 BCE; dedicated 181 BCE). Both temples used the epithet \"Erycina\" (\"of Eryx\"). The Sicilian sanctuary stayed important: in 25 CE the people of Segesta asked Emperor Tiberius to restore the old temple on the mountain, and he agreed.\nEarly Christianisation.\nFrom late antiquity onward the old sanctuary declined as the summit was reused. A small church dedicated to \"Santa Maria della Neve\" (often rendered \u201cOur Lady of the Snows\u201d) was probably built within the former sacred area during the time of the Norman castle (11th\u201312th centuries); its ruins are still visible inside the Castle of Venus.\nFrom the 13th and 14th centuries, Erice (then known as Monte San Giuliano) saw new churches and monasteries founded with royal and baronial support. The town\u2019s main church, the Chiesa Matrice (\"Chiesa di Maria Santissima Assunta\"), was built in 1314 under King Frederick III of Aragon, reportedly reusing material from the ancient temple of Venus Erycina. Baronial families backed new monasteries and churches. The Chiaramonte family are linked with the Santissimo Salvatore Benedictine house, set up in their former palace around 1290; the Ventimiglia family backed the Spirito Santo (San Francesco) convent, authorised by a papal bull of Pope Urban V in the 1360s. The pope also issued an edict at Avignon in 1365 to found the nearby San Pietro church.\nErice is linked in Carmelite tradition with several figures. Blessed Luigi Rabat\u00e0 (1443\u20131490) is generally said to have been born at the site of the Church of Sant'Isidoro. Nineteenth-century local historians also report that the palace later adapted as the Spirito Santo convent was traditionally considered the birthplace of Saint Albert of Trapani. Modern Carmelite scholarship, however, generally places Albert\u2019s birth in Trapani rather than Erice.\nBy the 1730s, Erice had at least thirty churches, along with six convents and three monasteries. Municipal \u201criveli\u201d (tax censuses) from 1836\u20131839 record 204 declarations; clergy were the largest single group among registrants\u201438 priests, 6 parish priests, 6 canons, an archpriest, a friar, a vicar, 3 clerics and 3 nuns\u2014and many two-storey \u201csolerate\u201d houses are listed as residences with rooms that often included a small domestic chapel.\nModern devotion.\nErice remains a religious destination. The Diocese of Trapani has renovated and reopened churches as part of the project \"Erice \u2013 la Montagna del Signore\" (Mountain of the Lord), which aims both to conserve and restore the town\u2019s church heritage and to keep the churches open longer \u201cfor the faithful and for visitors\u201d. The churches are presented together as a \u201cmuseo diffuso\u201d (a distributed museum) and are open to visits on a ticketed schedule.\nPilgrimage today often focuses on the Sant\u2019Anna shrine on the lower slopes of the mountain. The footpath known as the \"Sentiero di Sant\u2019Anna\" climbs from the valley cable car station up to the Santuario di Sant\u2019Anna and on to Porta Trapani at the town gate; diocesan groups sometimes organise pilgrimages along these paths. \nNear the summit, the woodland below the Castle of Venus (\"Bosco dei Runzi\") is being restored and signed as part of the municipal \"Bosco Sacro\" (Sacred Wood) project, reopening paths around the historic core; it is a municipal green belt rather than a distinct pilgrimage site.\nIn the Balio Gardens, the \u201cVenus and the Bee\u201d fountain (dated 1933) nods to the old cult in modern form. At the town's Cordici Museum (\"Museo Archeologico Storico-Artistico \u201cAntonino Cordici\u201d\"), an immersive video installation titled \"Venere Ericina\" tells the story of the ancient Erice cult to a generative fertility divinity\u2014identified by the Romans as Venus\u2014dating back to the Elymian period and continued by later colonisers; the projections cover the room\u2019s walls and floor.\nJewish community (medieval).\nIn the 1400s Erice had a substantial Jewish community that helped drive the town\u2019s growth. There were artisans such as blacksmiths, cotton workers and leather tanners, along with doctors and goldsmiths; together their work made the community largely self-sufficient in everyday goods. The Jewish quarter (\"giudecca\") lay mainly between the parish church of Sant\u2019Antonio Abate and the Spanish Quarter, extending east toward the \u201cFontanella\u201d and down to a long-vanished stretch of the old town wall. \nIn 1492, following the expulsion ordered by Ferdinand the Catholic, the quarter was largely abandoned and fell into ruin as families left or converted. The small church Madonna di Custonaci was formerly a synagogue before its conversion to a chapel, a fact once attested by a plaque that has since been lost.\nGeography.\nSetting and topography.\nErice is located approximately 100 kilometres (62 miles) from the regional capital, Palermo. Its historic centre sits at an elevation of about 750 metres (2,460 ft) atop Monte Erice, while the wider comune extends to the coastline, encompassing a varied topography of mountainous, hilly, and coastal terrain.\nIn 2025, WWF Italy and the Italian Alpine Club (CAI) proposed the creation of a national park\u2014the \"Parco Nazionale delle Isole Egadi e del Litorale Trapanese\"\u2014that would extend along the Trapani coastline to include the coastal strip of Erice.\nDistricts and urban structure.\nThe comune comprises 12 officially recognised \"frazioni\" (hamlets or districts): Adragna, Baglio Rizzo, Ballata, Casa Santa, Crocefissello, Lenzi, Napola, Pizzolungo, Rigaletta, San Cusumano, Specchia, and Torretta. Historically, the municipal territory also included neighbouring towns such as Valderice and San Vito Lo Capo, but its present boundaries were finalised in 1955.\nUntil the mid-20th century, Erice\u2019s territory was primarily rural, with an economy based on agriculture, grazing, and scattered farm settlements. From the 1950s onward, rapid and largely unregulated urban expansion reshaped the lower districts. Casa Santa emerged as the municipality\u2019s administrative and commercial hub, while the historic centre transitioned into a centre for tourism.\nClimate, land use and vegetation.\nErice experiences a Mediterranean climate, with heat moderated by its elevation. Summers are warm and dry, while winters are cool and wetter. The hilltop location of Erice results in more frequent fog and lower average temperatures than the coastal areas, contributing to a microclimate distinct from nearby Trapani.\nMuch of the area around the historic centre is wooded with Mediterranean species such as Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis), holm oak (Quercus ilex), and cypress, interspersed with underbrush of myrtle, heather, and broom. Two particularly notable green spaces include the Sacro Bosco\u2014a semi-natural sacred grove with mythological and monastic associations\u2014and the Bosco dei Runzi, a forested area on the northeastern slope known for its biodiversity and shaded walking trails.\nEconomy and tourism.\nPublic services and institutions.\nKey public facilities that serve both Erice and Trapani are located in the lower district of Casa Santa. These include the Sant\u2019Antonio Abate Hospital, the Stadio\u00a0Polisportivo\u00a0Provinciale, and the Polo\u00a0Territoriale\u00a0Universitario\u00a0di\u00a0Trapani, a satellite campus of the University of Palermo.\nAgriculture.\nThe hillsides around the comune support viticulture under the official Denominazione di Origine Controllata (DOC) designation Erice DOC, established in 2004, which allows the cultivation of both native varieties such as Nero d\u2019Avola and Grillo, and international ones like Syrah and Chardonnay. The Erice area is noted for its production of high-quality extra virgin olive oil, primarily from the Nocellara del Belice and Cerasuola cultivars, which are well-adapted to the region's arid summer conditions. These traditional crops form the basis of a rural economy closely linked to Erice\u2019s microclimatic diversity, which also supports limited cultivation of almonds and figs on the lower slopes.\nTourism and hospitality.\nHeritage conservation has underpinned Erice\u2019s visitor economy since the late 20th century, beginning with works on the ancient city walls in the 1970s and continuing with a \u20ac2 million consolidation project approved in 2023 under Italy\u2019s PNRR programme. The Balio Gardens were restored between 2019 and 2024, and additional works\u2014such as the renewal of the San Nicola sports field and Porta Spada gymnasium\u2014have improved recreational infrastructure with a combined investment of over \u20ac3 million.\nRecent studies have called for more inclusive and sustainable heritage strategies to address long-term challenges such as depopulation, inaccessibility, and seasonal tourism pressures. Proposals include the creation of accessible walking routes, a wellbeing park near the ancient walls, and improved visitor resources such as digital guides and interpretive signage. These efforts aim to balance conservation priorities with broader goals of health, community engagement, and inclusive cultural access.\nErice\u2019s 1\u202fkm wide sandy beach, Spiaggia di San Giuliano, features seasonal beach clubs, a dedicated Lido\u00a0Smile, which provides accessible bathing services for people with disabilities, and a cycling path, which forms part of a roughly 3 km coastal route, linking it westward to Trapani\u2019s Dante\u00a0Alighieri beach. \nThe Giardino dello Sport (Sports Garden), inaugurated in 2019 directly across from the San Giuliano beachfront, is one of the largest seafront sports parks in southern Italy. It features a large green area, a children's playground, a multi-purpose indoor facility, and various outdoor courts and fields for team and racket sports, as well as a fitness zone and full amenities including changing rooms, toilets, and refreshment areas.\nThese and other seasonal initiatives have contributed to a sharp rise in visitors. A 2025 study by the Centro Studi Conflavoro projected a 25.7% increase in summer tourism to Erice compared with 2024, as part of a broader forecasted boom in Italian hill towns and rural borghi. The same study estimated that Sicily would account for 14.7% of domestic tourist presences, making it the second most popular Italian region after Puglia. The study attributed Erice\u2019s success to its elevated location, offering cooler temperatures during the peak travel months, along with its medieval charm, panoramic views, and appeal to tourists aged 46\u201360 seeking authentic and temperate destinations.\nLandmarks.\nKey sites in Erice\u2019s historic centre include:\nTransport.\nRoad and air connections.\nErice is accessible by road from Trapani, connected via SP31 and SP3. The A29 motorway provides onward links to Palermo to the east. \nAir travel is served by two nearby airports: Vincenzo Florio Airport (Trapani\u2013Birgi), located about 29 km (18 mi) south of Erice, and Falcone\u2013Borsellino Airport (Palermo), approximately 90 km (56 mi) away. A new railway station at Trapani-Birgi Airport, part of a broader \u20ac13 billion in Sicilian rail infrastructure funded by Italy's National Recovery and Resilience Plan, will connect the airport to Trapani and Palermo via the restored and electrified Palermo\u2013Trapani line.\nCable car.\nA cable car (\"funivia\") runs a regular service that connects the lower district of Casa Santa to the historic centre. While this has improved vertical mobility, broader accessibility challenges persist in Erice\u2019s historic centre. Steep gradients, narrow streets, and uneven paving limit access for people with disabilities, and recent efforts\u2014such as the limited introduction of electric vehicles\u2014reflect the complex balance between conservation priorities and inclusive design.\nBus and ferry services.\nBus transport between Erice and Trapani is fully integrated, with metropolitan routes providing continuous service across both municipalities. These services include connections to Trapani-Birgi Airport and Palermo.\nThe redevelopment of Trapani\u2019s cruise terminal and island ferry facilities\u2014closely linked to the tourism economy in Erice's historic centre\u2014provides access for passengers arriving via the Aegadian Islands and Mediterranean cruise routes.\nCulture.\nErice holds a number of annual events and traditions, including religious processions, cultural festivals, and sporting competitions, many of which are associated with the town\u2019s historical and seasonal calendar. \nGastronomy.\nTraditional foods of Erice reflect the town\u2019s convent heritage and surrounding agricultural landscape, several of which are officially recognised as Prodotti agroalimentari tradizionali (P.A.T.) of Sicily. Local specialities include: \nErice retains a pastry tradition centred on the former San Carlo monastery; local patisseries continue the town\u2019s almond-based recipes. Among its exponents is pastry chef Maria Grammatico, who learned in the monastery and offers short public pastry classes at her own \"Scuola di Arte Culinaria\" in the old town. The Istituto di Istruzione Superiore Ignazio e Vincenzo Florio, which has purpose-built culinary laboratories called \"Officucina\" at its campus in the historic centre, also hosts public demonstrations and masterclasses led by visiting chefs and notable alumni.\nBorgo diVino in Tour stages an annual tasting weekend in the historic centre\u2014typically in late August\u2014featuring local and national wineries, street food, and live performances across venues such as Piazza della Loggia and Piazza San Giuliano.\nIn literature.\nIn 1897 the English novelist Samuel Butler argued in \"The Authoress of the Odyssey\" that the poem was written by a young Sicilian woman from Trapani and that several episodes reflect the landscape of western Sicily; he identified Mount Eryx (Monte Erice) and Trapani with key points in Odysseus\u2019s journey. Erice commemorates Butler with a street, Via Samuel Butler.\nButler\u2019s friend and literary executor Henry Festing Jones devoted four chapters of his travel book \"Diversions in Sicily\" (1909/1920) to Mount Eryx and Erice (\"Monte San Giuliano\", \"The Madonna and the Personaggi\", \"The Universal Deluge\", \"The Return\"), recording local customs, processions and the topography looking toward Trapani and the Egadi islands. Jones\u2019s earlier Sicilian collection \"Castellinaria and Other Sicilian Diversions\" (1911) is dedicated to friends \"di Monte Erice\", reflecting the town\u2019s role in the Anglo-Sicilian circle around Butler and Jones.\nJones\u2019s account includes lively descriptions of Erice\u2019s religious life. In his chapter on Monte San Giuliano, he describes the Festa di Maria Santissima di Custonaci procession of 25 August 1901:\n\"At 7.30 a brass band began to perambulate the town\u2026 at 8.30 the band entered the \"Matrice\", and before Mass the sacred picture was unveiled.\"\nCommemoration of Butler also extended to the surrounding area: Jones notes that, by 1908, a hotel in nearby Calatafimi bore the name \"Albergo Samuel Butler\" and that the town kept his memory in a street name.\nErice also honours the Italian writer Carlo Levi (author of \"Cristo si \u00e8 fermato a Eboli\") with Via Carlo Levi.\nIn film and television.\nErice has served as a filming location or creative inspiration for several film and television productions:\nIn art.\nErice has been a frequent subject for painters and printmakers from the 18th to the 20th century.\nSport.\nACES Europe (the European Capitals and Cities of Sport Federation) in 2025 officially designated the municipality of Erice as a European City of Sport for 2027.\nErice manages or hosts a range of sporting facilities. The largest is the Stadio Polisportivo Provinciale in the Casa Santa district, a 10,000-seat ground that has served as the home stadium for Trapani Calcio. The town also includes the Giardino dello Sport, a 35,000\u00a0m\u00b2 seafront sports park with multiple outdoor courts and pitches and a multi-purpose hall, the Porta Spada gymnasium, the municipal tennis and five-a-side football courts at Viale delle Pinete, and the historic Campo San Nicola football ground. The municipality in 2025 also approved plans for a new multipurpose sports complex in the frazione of Napola, including a rugby and football field, padel courts and other facilities.\nThe town is represented in national women\u2019s volleyball by Pallavolo Erice, which has competed in Serie A2 and plays its home matches at the PalaShark arena in neighbouring Trapani. Football is played at amateur level on the municipal grounds, while local associations also field teams in tennis, basketball and athletics.\nErice also hosts recurring sporting events, including the Cronoscalata Monte Erice, an automobile hillclimb established in 1954 that forms part of the Italian national championship calendar, the Maratona Trapani\u2013Erice and other running events, such as the Erice Trail, a springtime trial-running event. Cycling events also make use of the coastal cycle path along San Giuliano beach.\nPeople.\nThis list includes people born in Erice and figures closely associated with the town\u2019s institutions and heritage.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "44782", "revid": "50811671", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44782", "title": "Battle of Stirling Bridge", "text": "Battle of the First War of Scottish Independence\nThe Battle of Stirling Bridge () was fought during the First War of Scottish Independence. On 11 September 1297, the forces of Andrew Moray and William Wallace defeated the combined English forces of John de Warenne, 6th Earl of Surrey, and Hugh de Cressingham near Stirling, on the River Forth.\nBackground.\nIn 1296, John de Warenne, 6th Earl of Surrey, defeated John Comyn, Earl of Buchan in the Battle of Dunbar. King John Balliol surrendered to King Edward I of England at Brechin on 10 July, and the Scottish landholders were made to acknowledge Edward's overlordship. In 1297, Moray initiated a revolt in northern Scotland and by the late summer, controlled Urquhart, Inverness, Elgin, Banff and Aberdeen. Wallace joined Moray in September near Dundee, and they marched to Stirling. Stirling, in the words of Stuart Reid, was \"traditionally regarded as the key to Scotland.\" Meanwhile, Surrey had joined Cressingham in July and both had arrived at Stirling by 9 September 1297. By then, Moray and Wallace had already occupied Abbey Craig.\nBattle.\nSurrey was concerned with the number of Scots he faced, separated by a long causeway and narrow, wooden bridge, over the River Forth near Stirling Castle. Determining that he would be at a tactical disadvantage if he attempted to take his main force across there, he delayed crossing for several days to allow for negotiations and to reconnoiter the area. On 11 September, Surrey had sent James Stewart, and then two Dominican friars as emissaries to the Scots. According to Walter of Guisborough, Wallace reputedly responded with, \"We are not here to make peace but to do battle to defend ourselves and liberate our kingdom. Let them come on and we shall prove this to their very beards.\"\nWhile traditionally it has been argued that the Scots camped on Abbey Craig, it may be more likely they were to the west on Spittal Hill where the road that becomes the https://. The Scots dominated the soft flat ground north of the river. The English force of English, Welsh and Scots knights, bowmen and foot soldiers camped south of the river. Sir Richard Lundie, a Scots knight who joined the English after the Capitulation of Irvine, offered to outflank the enemy by leading a cavalry force over a ford upstream, where sixty horsemen could cross at the same time. Hugh de Cressingham, King Edward's treasurer in Scotland, persuaded the Earl to reject that advice and order a direct attack across the bridge.\nThe small bridge was broad enough to let only two horsemen cross abreast but offered the safest river crossing, as the Forth widened to the east and the marshland of Flanders Moss lay to the west. The Scots waited as the English knights and infantry, led by Cressingham, with Sir Marmaduke Thweng and Sir Richard Waldegrave, began to make their slow progress across the bridge on the morning of 11 September. It would have taken several hours for the entire English army to cross.\nWallace and Moray waited, according to the Chronicle of Hemingburgh, until \"as many of the enemy had come over as they believed they could overcome\". When a substantial number of the troops had crossed (possibly about 2,000) the attack was ordered. The Scots spearmen came down from the high ground in rapid advance and fended off a charge by the English heavy cavalry and then counterattacked the English infantry. They gained control of the near side of the bridge and cut off the chance of English reinforcements to cross. Caught on the low ground in the loop of the river with no chance of relief or of retreat, most of the outnumbered English on the attacked side were probably killed. A few hundred may have escaped by swimming across the river. Marmaduke Thweng managed to fight his way back across the bridge with some of his men.\nSurrey, who was left with a small contingent of archers, had stayed south of the river and was still in a strong position. The bulk of his army remained intact and he could have held the line of the Forth, denying the Scots a passage to the south, but his confidence was gone. After the escape of Sir Marmaduke Thweng, Surrey ordered the bridge to be destroyed, retreated towards Berwick, leaving the garrison at Stirling Castle isolated and abandoning the Lowlands to the rebels. James Stewart, the High Steward of Scotland, and Malcolm, Earl of Lennox, whose forces had been part of Surrey's army, observing the carnage to the north of the bridge, withdrew. Then the English supply train was attacked at \"The Pows\", a wooded marshy area, by James Stewart and the other Scots lords, and many of the fleeing soldiers were killed.\nThe Stirling Bridge of that time is believed to have been about upstream from the 15th-century stone bridge that now crosses the river. Four stone piers have been found underwater just north () and at an angle to the extant 15th-century bridge, along with man-made stonework on one bank in line with the piers. The site of the fighting was along either side of an earthen causeway leading from the Abbey Craig, atop which the Wallace Monument is now, to the north end of the bridge. The battlefield has been inventoried and protected by Historic Scotland under the Scottish Historical Environment Policy of 2009.\nAftermath.\nSurrey left William de Warine and Sir Marmaduke Thweng in charge of Stirling Castle, as Surrey abandoned his army, and fled towards Berwick.\nThe contemporary English chronicler Walter of Guisborough recorded the English losses in the battle as 100 cavalry and 5,000 infantry killed. Scottish casualties in the battle are unrecorded, with the exception of Andrew Moray, who was mortally wounded during the battle, and was dead by November.\nThe \"Lanercost Chronicle\" records that Wallace had a broad strip of Cressingham's skin, \"...taken from the head to the heel, to make therewith a baldrick for his sword.\"\nThe Scots proceeded to raid the south as far as Durham, England. Wallace was appointed \"Guardian of the kingdom of Scotland and commander of its army.\" Yet, Edward was already planning another invasion of Scotland, which would lead to the Battle of Falkirk.\nPopular culture.\nThe exploits of Wallace were passed on to posterity mainly in the form of tales collected and recounted by the poet Blind Harry, the Minstrel (d. 1492), whose original, probably oral sources were never specified. Blind Harry was active some 200 years after the events described in his \"The Acts and Deeds of the Illustrious and Valiant Champion Sir William Wallace\", c. 1470. The tales were designed to entertain the court of James IV (r. 1488\u20131513) and are undoubtedly a blend of fact and fiction. Like most of his other episodes, Blind Harry's account of the battle of Stirling Bridge is highly improbable, such as his use of figures of biblical magnitude for the size of the participating armies. Nevertheless, his highly dramatised and graphic account of the battle fed the imaginations of subsequent generations of Scottish schoolchildren. Here is his description:\nOn Saturday they [Moray and Wallace] rode on to the bridge, which was of good plain board, well made and jointed, having placed watches to see that none passed from the army. Taking a wright, the most able workman there, he [Wallace] ordered him to saw the plank in two at the mid streit [middle stretch], so that no-one might walk over it. He then nailed it up quickly with hinges, and dirtied it with clay, to cause it to appear that nothing had been done. The other end he so arranged that it should lie on three wooden rollers, which were so placed, that when one was out the rest would fall down. The wright, himself, he ordered to sit there underneath, in a cradle, bound on a beam, to loose the pin when Wallace let him know by blowing a horn when the time was come. No one in all the army should be allowed to blow but he himself.\nHugh Cressingham leads on the vanguard with twenty thousand likely men to see. Thirty thousand the Earl of Warren had, but he did then as wisdom did direct, all the first army being sent over before him. Some Scottish men, who well knew this manner of attack, bade Wallace sound, saying there were now enough. He hastened not, however, but steadily observed the advance until he saw Warren's force thickly crowd the bridge. Then from Jop he took the horn and blew loudly, and warned John the Wright, who thereupon struck out the roller with skill; when the pin was out, the rest of it fell down. Now arose an hideous outcry among the people, both horses and men, falling into the water. (...)\nOn foot and bearing a great sharp spear, Wallace went amongst the thickest of the press and aimed a stroke at Cressingham in his corslet, which was brightly polished. The sharp head of the spear pierced right through the plates and through his body, stabbing him beyond rescue; thus was that chieftain struck down to death. With the stroke Wallace bore down both man and horse.\nThe English army although ready for battle, lost heart when their chieftain was slain and many openly began to flee. Yet, worthy men abode in the place until ten thousand were slain. Then the remainder fled, not able to abide longer, seeking succour in many directions, some east, some west and some fled to the north. Seven thousand full at once floated in the Forth, plunged into the deep and drowned without mercy; none were left alive of all that fell army.\nAs well as the bridge ploy, Wallace's use of a spear appears to be a fictional element. A two-handed sword [claidheamh d\u00e0-l\u00e0imh, in Gaelic, more commonly claidheamh-m\u00f2r or claymore meaning great sword], purporting to be Wallace's, which may contain the original metal from his sword blade, was kept by the Scottish kings and is displayed as a relic in the Wallace Monument.\nThe potency of these tales can be gauged from the following statement by the poet Robert Burns, writing some three centuries after they were first related.\nThe two first books I ever read in private, and which gave me more pleasure than any two books I ever read again, were \"The Life of Hannibal\" and \"The History of Sir William Wallace\" [a modernised version of Blind Harry by William Hamilton of Gilbertfield]. Hannibal gave my young ideas such a turn that I used to strut in raptures up and down after the recruiting drum and bagpipe, and wish myself tall enough that I could be a soldier; while the story of Wallace poured a Scottish prejudice into my veins which will boil along there till the flood-gates of life shut in eternal rest.\nThe Battle of Stirling Bridge is depicted in the 1995 film \"Braveheart\", but it bears little resemblance to the real battle. Significantly, there is no bridge in the movie (due mainly to the difficulty of filming around the bridge itself), and it replaced the tactics of the battle with ones resembling the Battle of Bannockburn.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "44783", "revid": "49209073", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44783", "title": "Apulia", "text": "Region of Italy\nApulia ( ), also known by its Italian name Puglia (), is a region of Italy, located in the southern peninsular section of the country, bordering the Adriatic Sea to the east, the Strait of Otranto and Ionian Sea to the southeast and the Gulf of Taranto to the south. The region comprises , and has 3,874,166 inhabitants as of 2025. It is bordered by the other Italian regions of Molise to the north, Campania to the west, and Basilicata to the southwest. The regional capital is Bari.\nIn ancient times, more precisely at the beginning of the first millennium BC, the region of Apulia was inhabited by the Iapygians, while during the 8th century BC its coastal areas were populated by ancient Greeks. Later, the region was conquered by the ancient Romans. It was then conquered by the Byzantines, followed by the Normans, the Aragonese and the Spanish. Subsequently, it became part of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, to then be annexed to the unified Kingdom of Italy after the Expedition of the Thousand.\nGeography.\nApulia's coastline is longer than that of any other mainland Italian region. In the north, the Gargano promontory extends out into the Adriatic sea like a \"sperone\" (\"spur\"), while in the south, the Salento peninsula forms the \"tacco\" (\"heel\") of Italy's boot. The highest peak in the region is Monte Cornacchia above sea level) within the Daunian Mountains, in the north along the Apennines.\nIt is home to two national parks, the Alta Murgia National Park and Gargano National Park.\nOutside national parks in the North and West, most of Apulia, particularly the Salento peninsula, is geographically flat with only moderate hills.\nThe climate is typically Mediterranean with hot, dry and sunny summers and mild and rainy winters. Snowfall, especially on the coast is rare but has occurred as recently as January 2019 (following on from snow in March 2018 and January 2017). Apulia is among the hottest and driest regions of Italy in summer, with temperatures sometimes reaching and exceeding in Lecce and Foggia.\nThe coastal areas, particularly on the Adriatic Sea and in the southern Salento peninsula, are frequently exposed to winds of varying strengths and directions, strongly affecting local temperatures and conditions, sometimes within the same day. The Northerly Bora wind from the Adriatic Sea can lower temperatures, humidity and moderate summer heat while the Southerly Sirocco wind from North Africa can raise temperatures, and humidity and occasionally drop red dust from the Sahara Desert. On some days in spring and autumn/fall, it can be warm enough to swim in Gallipoli and Porto Cesareo on the Ionian coast while at the same time, cool winds warrant jackets and jumpers/sweaters in Monopoli and Otranto on the Adriatic coast.\nThe area between Otranto and Santa Maria di Leuca is part of the Regional Natural Coastal Park of \"Costa Otranto \u2014 Santa Maria di Leuca e Bosco di Tricase\" wanted by the Apulia Region in 2008. This territory has numerous natural and historical attractions such as Ciolo, which is a rocky cove.\nIn 2010 the Ministry of Health declared 98.6% of the Apulian coasts suitable for bathing.\nHistory.\nAntiquity.\nHuman settlement in Apulia dates back to at least 250,000 years ago, as evidenced by the fossil remains of the Altamura Man, an archaic form of Neanderthal. There are numerous finds from the prehistoric era, including several menhir and dolmen.\nAround the 1st millennium BC, the Iapygians settled in the territory with the tribes of the Daunians, the Peucetians and the Messapians, as well as the populations of the Calabri and the Sallentini (both settled in Salento); later, in the Hellenic era, the Magna Graecia colonies were quite numerous, especially in the southern part of the region, including the city of Taras, now Taranto.\nDuring the second Samnite war (326\u2013304 BC), the Roman army, in an attempt to provide relief to Lucera, besieged by the Samnites, suffered a serious defeat in the Battle of the Caudine Forks, in 321 BC. Rome soon understood the strategic importance of \"Apulia\" (corresponding only to the central-northern part of present-day Apulia, while the Salento Peninsula was known as \"Calabria\" in that period), but the occupation of the region, in the third century BC, was not easy, especially for the resistance of Tarentum and Brundisium. In 216 BC in Cannae the Roman army suffered its worst defeat against Hannibal's Carthage.\nAround 7 BC, emperor Augustus divided Roman Italy into regions, one of them being \"Regio II Apulia et Calabria\". Later on, emperor Diocletian (284-305) reorganized Italian regions into provinces, and the newly created \"Province of Apulia and Calabria\" was placed under the jurisdiction of the Diocese of Suburbicarian Italy. With the construction of the Appian Way and, in the imperial era, of the Via Traiana along which cities such as Troia, Ordona, Gravina, Canosa, Ruvo and Bitonto prospered. The region occupied leading positions in the production of grain and oil, becoming the largest exporter of olive oil in the East.\nMiddle Ages and Renaissance period.\nAt the Fall of the Western Roman Empire (476), Apulia also went through a prolonged period of unrest and political changes. Under the Ostrogothic rule, the old Roman \"Province of Apulia and Calabria\" continued to exist within administrative structures of the Ostrogothic realm. In 535, Byzantine Emperor Justinian I (527-565) launched the re-conquest of Italy, thus initiating the Gothic War, that ended with Byzantine victory (554). Under imperial rule, the Praetorian prefecture of Italy also included the province of \"Apulia and Calabria\" (modern Apulia with Salento). Since 569, the invading Lombards tried and partially succeeded to conquer much of the region. Responding to those threats, remaining Byzantine territories in Italy were regrouped into several regions, or \"eparchies\" in 580, one of them being \"Calabria\", that was encompassing not only ancient Roman \"Calabria\" (Salento), but also remaining parts of Apulia, Lucania and Bruttium, thus laying foundation for the expansion of the term. Already by 584, the entire Italian Prefecture was reorganized into the Exarchate of Ravenna, that was encompassing the enlarged \"Calabria\", but in time much of southern Italy, including parts of Apulia, fell under the rule of Lombard Duchy of Benevento.\nDuring the 9th century, coastal regions of Apulia were briefly occupied by Saracens who established the Emirate of Bari. Saracens were driven out of Apulia during 870s, and the Byzantine rule was imposed again throughout Apulia, with Bari becoming the capital of a distinctive Byzantine province (\"theme\") known as Langobardia (in reference to regions recaptured from Beneventan Lombards), that was by the middle of the 10th century placed under jurisdiction of the newly created Catepanate of Italy.\nWith the advent of the Normans in the 11th century, Taranto became the capital of the Principality of Taranto, which extended across the entire Terra di Otranto.\nIn 1043, the Norman adventurer William of Hauteville founded the county of Apulia, which in 1059 merged into the vast County of Apulia and Calabria, whose borders progressively extended up to in Principality of Salerno. From 1130 it became part of the Kingdom of Sicily. In the 13th century the name Apulia was used by some authors to indicate the southern part of the Italian peninsula. During the Sicilian domination Apulia achieved great material and civil progress, which reached its peak with Frederick II, who was responsible for the construction of a series of secular and religious buildings, some of high artistic value, including Castel del Monte, near Andria. During this period Foggia became one of his residences. From 1282, following the separation of the island of Sicily from the rest of the south of the peninsula, Apulia was under the rule of the Kingdom of Naples, from that moment the power of the landowners began to take root in the territory.\nEarly modern period.\nFrom the middle of the 18th century the region of Apulia experienced a period of strong economic prosperity and excellent development of trade and agriculture. Between 1806 and 1815, during the Napoleonic era, provided the modernization of Apulia with the abolition of feudalism and judicial reforms until the return of the Bourbons and the birth of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. Liberal movements were formed throughout the region in 1820 with the spread of Freemasonry and Carbonari.\nWith the Kingdom of Italy established in 1861, Apulia was administratively divided into the provinces of Foggia, Bari and Lecce; to these were added in the twentieth century the provinces of Brindisi and Taranto. In the period following the unification of Italy, various brigand gangs arose, especially in Capitanata and Terra di Bari; among the major exponents are Michele Caruso, Antonio Angelo Del Sambro and Giuseppe Schiavone, the latter a faithful lieutenant of the Lucanian brigand leader Carmine Crocco.\nModern period.\nWith the progressive decline of the latifundium, the ancient Apulian farms, properties of medium agricultural size, also decayed. During fascism, Apulia was affected by numerous land reclamations in vast areas and, following the post-war agrarian reform, the region enjoyed strong agricultural development. In the 1970s and 1980s the economy of the region moved from the primary sector to the tertiary one, with notable development coming from the tourism sector.\nEconomy.\nThe region's contribution to Italy's gross value added was around 4.6% in 2000, while its population was 7% of the total. The per capita GDP is low compared to the national average and represents about 68.1% of the EU average.\nThe share of gross value added by the agricultural and services sectors was above the national average in 2000. The region has industries specialising in particular areas, including food processing and vehicles in Foggia; footwear and textiles in the Barletta province, and wood and furniture in the Murge area to the west.\nBetween 2007 and 2013 the economy of Apulia expanded more than that of the rest of southern Italy. Such growth, over several decades, is a severe challenge to the hydrogeological system.\nApulia's thriving economy is articulated into numerous sectors boasting several leading companies, but most of them produce materials or components, not finished goods: \nIn Taranto, there is the largest metallurgical work ILVA Acciaierie di Taranto (8,200 empl.) in Europe with a full iron and steel production cycle. It will be sold to Arcelor Mittal.\nIn Brindisi, there is a chemical industrial park with an Eni power station, Eni oil refinery, chemical factory, and Versalis chemical factory (basic chemistry, intermediates, polyethene, styrenics and elastomers). LyondellBasell polypropylene plant, Sanofi plant (antibiotics). Another Eni oil refinery is located in Taranto.\nUnemployment.\nThe unemployment rate stood at 14.1% in 2020.\nFishing and aquaculture.\nThe port of Taranto hosts numerous fishing boats. The fleet is mainly made up of about 80 fishing boats, which do not exceed 10 gross tonnage and which practice trawling, while the remaining small-scale fishing boats operate with gillnets. The sea, rich and generous, is populated by dentex, sea bream, glit-head bream, grouper, redfish, mullet, mussels, sea urchin, anchovies, shrimp and squid. Other significant fishing ports are Manfredonia, Trani, Molfetta, Mola di Bari, Monopoli, Castro, and Gallipoli.\nToday Taranto is the world's largest producer of farmed mussels: with 1,300 employees, around 30,000 tons of mussels are processed per year. Mussel farming has characterized the city's economy for centuries, making the mussel the gastronomic symbol of Taranto. It is said that the first mussel gardens in La Spezia, Pula, Olbia and Chioggia were established by mussel farmers who emigrated from this city. The workplace of the Taranto mussel farmers is the boat; every detail of the working method has improved over time.\n10 m long structures made of wood or metal, called \"pali\" (piles), are attached to the seabed, to which ropes and nets are then attached, on which the mussels are grown. The mussels farmed here are particularly tasty and valued because they grow in a special environment, a mixture of salt seawater and karst freshwater. These special environmental conditions of the seas of Taranto are ideal not only for the mussels but also for the fish and crustaceans that find food and shelter between the piles. While there are around 18 submarine freshwater springs, called \"Citri\", in the Mar Piccolo, there is only one large one in the Mar Grande, which is called \"Anello di San Cataldo\" in honour of the patron saint of the city.\nAgriculture.\nAgriculture plays a prominent economic role in Apulia. It is mainly intensive and modern agriculture that allows the region to be among the first in Italy for the production of many products:\nVegetable growing (lettuce, artichoke, fennel, cabbage, celery, barattiere, borage, sweet potato, caper, portulaca, broccoli rabe) and horticulture (peach, orange, clementine, lemon, kumquat, fig, pomegranate, persimmon, prickly pear) are also developed.\nViticulture.\nVineyards cover in Apulia, which is first place among Italian grape-growing regions. But in the production of quality DOC and DOCG wines, Apulia has only ranked 12th of 20 with 297,667 hl. \nThere are four DOCG wines:\nOliviculture.\nThere are an estimated 50 to 60 million olive trees in Apulia, and the region accounts for 40% of Italy's olive oil production. There are four specific Protected designations of Origin (PDO) covering the whole region. Olive varieties include: \"Baresane\", \"Biancolilla\", \"Brandofino\" (Castiglione), \"Buscionetto\" (Biancolilla), \"Carolea\", \"Cellina di Nard\u00f2\", \"Cerasuola\" (Ogliara), \"Cerignola\" (Bella di Cerignola), \"Cima di Bitonto\", \"Cima di Mola\", \"Coratina\", also grown in Corning, California, a 2018 Gold Medal New York International Olive Oil Competition (NYIOOC) winner, \"Frantoio\", \"Garganica\", \"La Minuta\", \"Leccino\", \"Moresca\", \"Nocellara Etnea\", \"Nocellara Messinese\", \"Ogliarola\", \"Ogliarola Barese\", \"Ogliara Messinese\", \"Ottobratica\", \"Peranzana\", \"Rotondella\", \"Santagatese\", \"Saracena\", \"Tonda Iblea\", and \"Verdello\" (subspecies of San Benedetto).\n\"Xylella fastidiosa\" disease.\nSince 2008\u20132010, the olive oil industry in Apulia has been under threat from the pathogen \"Xylella fastidiosa\", a disease that inhibits the trees' uptake of water and nutrients. The epicentre of the epidemic is the southeastern part of the region.\nTourism.\nApulia has many small and picturesque villages, 14 of them have been selected by (), a non-profit private association of small Italian towns of strong historical and artistic interest, that was founded on the initiative of the Tourism Council of the National Association of Italian Municipalities.\nTransport.\nThe region has a good network of roads, but the railway network is less comprehensive, particularly in the south. There are no high-speed lines, but a high-speed line between Naples and Bari is under construction, which should be completed in 2027. The region is crossed northwest to southeast by the A14 highway (Bologna\u2013Taranto), which connects the region's capital, Bari, to Taranto, the second most populous city in the region. The A14 also connects Foggia and points further north along the Adriatic coast to Pescara, Ancona, Rimini and eventually Bologna. The only other highway in the region is the A16 (Naples\u2013Canosa), which crosses the Italian peninsula east\u2013west and links the region with Naples.\nThere are two international airports, Karol Wojty\u0142a Airport in Bari (IATA: BRI) and Brindisi Airport (IATA: BDS), which serve as the principal logistical hub for the United Nations Global Service Center headquartered in Brindisi. With the approval of a redevelopment project in 2018, the Grottaglie Airfield (IATA: TAR) will host a spaceport for the Italian Space Agency and Virgin Galactic.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nEmigration from the region's depressed areas to northern Italy and the rest of Europe was very intense in the years between 1956 and 1971. Subsequently, the trend declined, as economic conditions improved, to the point where there was net immigration in the years between 1982 and 1985. Since 1986, the stagnation in employment has led to a new inversion of the trend caused by a decrease in immigration.\nGovernment and politics.\nSince 1 June 2015, former judge and mayor of Bari Michele Emiliano of the Democratic Party has served as President of the Apulian region.\nAdministrative divisions.\nApulia is divided into six provinces:\nCulture.\nCuisine.\nImportant locally produced ingredients include olive oil, artichokes, tomatoes, eggplant, asparagus, and various kinds of seafood. Local specialties include the carosello, a variety of muskmelon which is often consumed when unripe. Apulian Protected designation of origin (PDO) and Protected Geographical indication (PGI) products included cheeses, olive oils, fruits and vegetables, and a type of bread.\nTypically Apulian pasta shapes are orecchiette, cavatelli, troccoli, and https://, Popular street foods include panzerotti, sgagliozze (fried polenta), popizze (small fried balls of pizza dough that are sometimes also called ), rustici (puff pastries stuffed with tomatoes, b\u00e9chamel sauce, mozzarella, and black pepper), and focaccia barese (foccaccia with fresh tomatoes and olives). Some popular pastries / desserts include the famous pasticiotto (a flaky shortbread dough filled with custard), chiacchiere, https://, and cupeta. A popular snack from Apulia are Taralli.\nLanguage.\nAs with the other regions of Italy, the national language (since 1861) is Italian. However, because of its long and varied history, other historical languages have been used in this region for centuries. The local languages of northern and central Apulia (roughly the provinces of Bari, Barletta-Andria-Trani, and Foggia as well as the northwestern parts of the Province of Taranto) are the Apulian Southern Italo-Romance dialects, including Bari dialect and Tarantino dialect. In the southern region of Salento, an extreme Southern Italo-Romance language, the Salentino dialect is widely spoken. There is also an Italiot Greek language found in Salento called Griko, which is still spoken by a few thousand Griko people in some areas. In addition, a rare daughter language of the Franco-Proven\u00e7al language called Faetar is spoken in the mountain villages of Faeto and Celle di San Vito, in the Province of Foggia. It is sometimes classified as a pair of dialects of Franco-Proven\u00e7al, Faetar and Cellese. The Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb dialect of the Albanian language has been spoken by a small community since refugees settled there in the 16th century.\nSports.\nApulia is home to several national football, water polo, volleyball, basketball and tennis clubs.\nAcross the top three levels of Italian football, the clubs in Apulia include:\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n "}
{"id": "44784", "revid": "3632083", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44784", "title": "Bari", "text": "City in Apulia, Italy\nBari ( , ; ; ) is the capital city of the Metropolitan City of Bari and of the Apulia region, on the Adriatic Sea in southern Italy. It is one of the most important economic centres of mainland southern Italy. It is a port and university city as well as the city of Saint Nicholas. The city itself has a population of 315,473 inhabitants, and an area of over , while the urban area has 750,000 inhabitants. Its metropolitan province has 1.2 million inhabitants.\nBari is made up of four different urban sections. To the north is the closely built old town on the peninsula between two modern harbours, with the Basilica of Saint Nicholas, the Cathedral of San Sabino (1035\u20131171) and the Norman-Swabian Castle, which is now also a major nightlife district. To the south is the Murat quarter (erected by Joachim Murat), the modern heart of the city, which is laid out on a rectangular grid-plan with a promenade on the sea and the major shopping district (the \"via Sparano\" and \"via Argiro\").\nModern residential zones surrounding the centre of Bari were built during the 1960s and 1970s replacing the old suburbs that had developed along roads splaying outwards from gates in the city walls. In addition, the outer suburbs developed rapidly during the 1990s.\nHistory.\nAncient.\nBari itself known in antiquity as \"Barium\", was a harbour of the Iapygian Peuceti. The authors of the Etymologicum Magnum have preserved an etymology by authors of antiquity about \"Barium\", which they explain as the word \"house\" in Messapic. The city had strong Greek influences before the Roman era. In Ancient Greek, it was known as \"\u0392\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd\". In the 3rd century BC, it became part of the Roman Republic and was subsequently Romanized. The city developed strategic significance as the point of junction between the coast road and the Via Traiana and as a port for eastward trade; a branch road to Tarentum led from Barium. Its harbour, mentioned as early as 181 BC, was probably the principal one of the districts in ancient times, as it is at present, and was the centre of a fishery. The first historical bishop of Bari was Gervasius who was noted at the Council of Sardica in 347.\nMiddle Ages.\nWith the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476, Bari was invaded by Barbarians and occupied by the Ostrogoths. It was taken from them by the Byzantine Empire during the Gothic wars and disputed for the following two centuries with the Lombards of the Duchy of Benevento, who made it a steward.\nThroughout this period, and indeed throughout the Middle Ages, Bari served as one of the major slave depots of the Mediterranean, providing a central location for the trade in Slavic slaves. The slaves were mostly captured by Venice from Dalmatia, by the Holy Roman Empire from what is now Eastern Germany and Poland, and by the Byzantines from elsewhere in the Balkans, and were generally destined for other parts of the Byzantine Empire and (most frequently) the Muslim states surrounding the Mediterranean: the Abbasid Caliphate, the Umayyad Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba, the Emirate of Sicily, and the Fatimid Caliphate (which relied on Slavs purchased at the Bari market for its legions of Sakalaba Mamluks).\nFor 20 years, Bari was the centre of the Emirate of Bari; the city was captured by its first emirs Kalfun in 847, who had been part of the mercenary garrison installed there by Radelchis I of Benevento. The city was conquered and the emirate extinguished in 871 following five-year campaign by Frankish Emperor Louis II, assisted by a Byzantine fleet. Chris Wickham states Louis spent five years campaigning to reduce then occupy Bari, \"and then only to a Byzantine/Slav naval blockade\"; \"Louis took the credit\" for the success, adding \"at least in Frankish eyes\", then concludes by noting that by remaining in southern Italy long after this success, he \"achieved the near-impossible: an alliance against him of the Beneventans, Salernitans, Neapolitans and Spoletans; later sources include Sawad\u0101n as well.\" In 885, Bari became the residence of the local Byzantine \"catapan\", or governor. The failed revolt (1009\u20131011) of the Lombard nobles Melus of Bari and his brother-in-law Dattus, against the Byzantine governorate, though it was firmly repressed at the Battle of Cannae (1018), offered their Norman adventurer allies a first foothold in the region. In 1025, under the Archbishop Byzantius, Bari became attached to the see of Rome and was granted \"provincial\" status.\nIn 1071, Bari was captured by Robert Guiscard, following a three-year siege, ending what remained of the Byzantine power in the region. Following this, Bari's physical and political landscapes were changed: the \"praetorium\" which had functioned as a political centre was converted into the Basilica of Saint Nicholas. Relics of Saint Nicholas were brought to Bari in 1087 and installed in the basilica.\nIn 1095, Peter the Hermit preached the First Crusade there. In October 1098, Urban II, who had consecrated the Basilica in 1089, convened the Council of Bari, one of a series of synods convoked with the intention of reconciling the Eastern and Western Church on the question of the filioque clause in the Creed, which Anselm ably defended, seated at the pope's side.\nIn 1136 the Holy Roman Emperor, Lothair, captured Bari. A Byzantine army took control of Bari from William I of Sicily in 1155. William recaptured the city the following year, and on finding that his house had been destroyed began a campaign of reprisals causing widespread destruction across the city. The city walls were destroyed, an act which archaeologist Giulia Bellato suggests was a symbolic downgrading of Bari's status and that of its inhabitants. The events are chronicled by Hugo Falcandus.\nDuring Joanna I of Naples' conflict with Hungary, Bari was besieged in 1349 and captured by a combined Germany and Hungarian army.\nEarly modern period.\nA long period of decline characterized the city under the dominations of Aldoino Filangieri di Candida, and those of the Kings of Naples, which held the control of the entire mainland southern Italy from 1282 to 1806. This decline was interrupted, however, by the splendor under the Sforzas, who ruled the city as Dukes of Bari, a title given by the Neapolitan crown, in particular under the rule of the dukes Ludovico and Beatrice d'Este, then of the duchesses Isabella of Aragon and Bona Sforza. Bari also underwent Venetian domination, which led to the expansion of the port and a very prosperous period, also favored by the trade of inland products, which were in great demand on foreign markets.\nIn 1556, Princess Bona Sforza of Aragon, second wife of the King of Poland Sigismund I, left Poland and settled in Bari, whose principality she had inherited from her parents. During her reign, she fortified the city's castle, as evidenced by an inscription in bronze letters on the cornice around the courtyard, as well as building several churches, a monastery, two water cisterns and made many donations to the monks of the Basilica of San Nicola. Bona Sforza died in the city in 1557. Following her death, the city of Bari came under the direct rule of the kings of Naples.\nIn 1813, Joachim Murat, King of Naples in the Napoleonic era, began a new urbanization, changing the face of the city and setting a new \"chessboard\" growth model, which continued for many years to come. The village built at the time on the outskirts of the old city still retains its name.\nModern plumbing arrived in the city of Bari on 24 April 1915: it was the first completed leg of the nascent Apulian Aqueduct. During the 1930s, Araldo di Crollalanza, the mayor and minister of Bari, oversaw the development of its modern waterfront.\nWorld War II.\nOn 11 September 1943, in connection with the Armistice of Cassibile, Bari was taken without resistance by the British 1st Airborne Division, then during October and November 1943, New Zealand troops from the 2nd New Zealand Division assembled in Bari.\nThe 1943 chemical warfare disaster.\nA fleet of German Luftwaffe bombers attacked Allied forces and shipping in Bari on 2 December 1943. An American ship, the , carrying a secret cargo of 2,000 mustard gas bombs, was destroyed causing release of the gas into the air and sea, resulting in death, chemical burns, and blindness among sailors and the civilian population of the city.\nA member of U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower's medical staff, Stewart F. Alexander, was dispatched to Bari following the raid. Alexander had trained at the Army's Edgewood Arsenal in Maryland, and was familiar with some of the effects of mustard gas. Although he was not informed of the cargo carried by the \"John Harvey\", and most victims suffered atypical symptoms caused by exposure to mustard diluted in water and oil (as opposed to airborne), Alexander rapidly concluded that mustard gas was present. Although he could not get any acknowledgement of this from the chain of command, Alexander convinced medical staffs to treat patients for mustard exposure and saved many lives as a result. He also preserved many tissue samples from autopsied victims at Bari. After World War II, these samples would result in the development of an early form of chemotherapy based on mustard, Mustine.\nOn the orders of Allied leaders Franklin D. Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, and Eisenhower, records were destroyed and the whole affair was kept secret for many years after the war. The U.S. records of the attack were declassified in 1959, but the episode remained obscure until 1967, when writer Glenn B. Infield exposed the story in his book \"Disaster at Bari\". Additionally, there is considerable dispute as to the exact number of fatalities. In one account: \"[S]ixty-nine deaths were attributed in whole or in part to the mustard gas, most of them American merchant seamen.\" Others put the count as high as \"more than one thousand Allied servicemen and more than one thousand Italian civilians\".\nThe affair is the subject of two books: the aforementioned \"Disaster at Bari\", by Glenn B. Infield, and \"Nightmare in Bari: The World War II Liberty Ship Poison Gas Disaster and Coverup\", by Gerald Reminick.\nIn 1988, through the efforts of Nick T. Spark, U.S. Senators Dennis DeConcini and Bill Bradley, Stewart Alexander received recognition from the Surgeon General of the United States Army for his actions during the Bari disaster.\n\"Charles Henderson\" explosion.\nThe port of Bari was again struck by disaster on 9 April 1945 when the Liberty ship \"Charles Henderson\" exploded in the harbour while offloading 2,000 tons of aerial bombs (half of that amount had been offloaded when the explosion occurred). Three hundred and sixty people were killed and 1,730 were wounded. The harbour was again rendered non-operational, this time for a month.\nGeography.\nBari is the largest urban and metro area on the Adriatic. It is located in southern Italy, at a more northerly latitude than Naples, further south than Rome.\nClimate.\nBari has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen: \"Csa\") bordering on a cold semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen: BSk) due to high evapotranspiration, with mild winters and hot, dry summers.\nQuarters.\nBari is divided into five municipalities (\"Municipi\"), constituted in 2014. The municipality is also divided into 17 official neighbourhoods (\"quartieri\").\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAs of 2015, there are 315,473 people residing in Bari of whom 48.1% were male and 51.9% were female, while 3.8% of the population were foreign residents.\nMigration.\nAccording to an urban migration study in Bari, return migration gain to urban areas is higher than migration loss from urban areas. People migrating from urban destinations tend to migrate to different places in comparison to people migrating from rural areas. These findings are based on the background and behavior of a sample of 211 return migrants to Bari, Italy. Bari is a port city, making it historically important because of its strong trade links with Greece, North Africa, and the eastern Mediterranean. Bari's economic structure is based on industry, commerce, services, and administration. Around two-thirds of the city's employment is in the tertiary sector with its port, commerce, and administrative functions. The highest percentage of Bari's working population is employed in services, with 45.6%. From 1958 to 1982, around 20% of migrants left Bari for other Italian communes, while around 17% or migrants came to Bari from other Italian communes. Under 2% of migrants left Bari to go abroad and came to the city from abroad.\nCulture.\nCuisine and gastronomy.\nBari's cuisine is based on three typical agricultural products found within the surrounding region of Apulia, namely wheat, olive oil, and wine.\nSport.\nLocal football club S.S.C. Bari, currently competing in Serie B (as of the 2024\u20132025 season), plays in the Stadio San Nicola, an architecturally innovative 58,000-seater stadium purpose-built for the 1990 FIFA World Cup. The stadium also hosted the 1991 European Cup final.\nIn 2007, Bari hosted the first and only world games for underwater sports.\nTransport.\nBari has its own airport, Bari Karol Wojty\u0142a Airport, which is located northwest of the centre of Bari. It is connected to the centre by train services from Bari Aeroporto railway station.\nBari Central Station lies on the Adriatic railway and has connection to cities such as Rome, Milan, Bologna, Turin and Venice. Another mainline is connection southwards by the Bari-Taranto railway. The Bari metropolitan railway service operates local commuter services; while regional services also operate to Foggia, Barletta, Brindisi, Lecce, Taranto and other towns and villages in the Apulia region.\nBari has an old fishery port (\"Porto Vecchio\") and a so-called new port in the north, as well as some marinas. The Port of Bari is an important cargo transport hub to Southeast Europe. Various passenger transport lines include some seasonal ferry lines to Albania, Montenegro or Dubrovnik. Bari \u2013 Igoumenitsa is a popular ferry route to Greece. Some cruise ships call at Bari.\nIn popular culture.\nThe Guido Guerrieri novels by Gianrico Carofiglio are set in Bari, where Guerrieri is a criminal lawyer, and include many descriptions of the town.\nBari is one of the primary settings of the 1954 detective novel \"The Black Mountain\" by Rex Stout. It is the characters' point of embarkation to Communist Yugoslavia.\nIn the 1995 film \"The Bridges of Madison County\", Italian housewife Francesca Johnson (Meryl Streep), is mentioned as being from Bari and growing up in Naples.\nThe 2020 Edoardo Ponti film \"La vita davanti a s\u00e9\", starring Sophia Loren, is set in Bari.\nNotable people.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nInternational relations.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nBari is twinned with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "44785", "revid": "4796325", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44785", "title": "Dream", "text": "Phenomenon of the mind while sleeping\nA dream is a succession of images, dynamic scenes and situations, ideas, emotions, and sensations that usually occur involuntarily in the mind during certain stages of sleep. Humans spend about two hours dreaming per night, and each dream lasts around 5\u201320 minutes, although the dreamer may perceive the dream as being much longer.\nThe content and function of dreams have been topics of scientific, philosophical and religious interest throughout recorded history. Dream interpretation, practiced by the Babylonians in the third millennium BCE and even earlier by the ancient Sumerians, figures prominently in religious texts in several traditions, and has played a lead role in psychotherapy. Dreamwork is similar, but does not seek to conclude with definite meaning. The scientific study of dreams is called oneirology. Most modern dream study focuses on the neurophysiology of dreams and on proposing and testing hypotheses regarding dream function. It is not known where in the brain dreams originate, if there is a single origin for dreams or if multiple regions of the brain are involved, or what the purpose of dreaming is for the body (or brain or mind).\nThe human dream experience and what to make of it has undergone sizable shifts over the course of history. Long ago, according to writings from Mesopotamia and Ancient Egypt, dreams dictated post-dream behaviors to an extent that was sharply reduced in later millennia. These ancient writings about dreams highlight visitation dreams, where a dream figure, usually a deity or a prominent forebear, commands the dreamer to take specific actions, and which may predict future events. Framing the dream experience varies across cultures as well as through time.\nDreaming and sleep are intertwined. Dreams occur mainly in the rapid-eye movement (REM) stage of sleep\u2014when brain activity is high and resembles that of being awake. Because REM sleep is detectable in many species, and because research suggests that all mammals experience REM, linking dreams to REM sleep has led to conjectures that animals dream. However, humans dream during non-REM sleep, also, and not all REM awakenings elicit dream reports. To be studied, a dream must first be reduced to a verbal report, which is an account of the subject's memory of the dream, not the subject's dream experience itself. Therefore, dreaming by non-humans is currently unprovable, as is dreaming by human fetuses and pre-verbal infants.\nEtymology.\nIn Old English, the word \"dr\u0113am\" was used to describe \"noise\", \"joy\", or \"music\", but not related to the sleep-induced brain activity. It was only in the 13th century that the word \"dream\" was used to describe \"a series of thoughts, images or emotions occurring during sleep\". Etymologists believe that this change was influenced due to the Old Norse \"draumr\", which had the same meaning as the word \"dream\" nowadays.\nSubjective experience and content.\nPreserved writings from early Mediterranean civilizations indicate a relatively abrupt change in subjective dream experience between Bronze Age antiquity and the beginnings of the classical era.\nIn visitation dreams reported in ancient writings, dreamers were largely passive in their dreams, and visual content served primarily to frame authoritative auditory messaging. Gudea, the king of the Sumerian city-state of Lagash (reigned c. 2144\u20132124 BCE), rebuilt the temple of Ningirsu as the result of a dream in which he was told to do so. After antiquity, the passive hearing of visitation dreams essentially gave way to visualized narratives in which the dreamer becomes a character who actively participates.\nFrom the 1940s to 1985, Calvin S. Hall collected more than 50,000 dream reports at Western Reserve University. In 1966, Hall and Robert Van de Castle published \"The Content Analysis of Dreams\", outlining a coding system to study 1,000 dream reports from college students. Results indicated that participants from varying parts of the world demonstrated similarity in their dream content. The only residue of antiquity's authoritative dream figure in the Hall and Van de Castle listing of dream characters is the inclusion of God in the category of prominent persons. Hall's complete dream reports were made publicly available in the mid-1990s by his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 William Domhoff. More recent studies of dream reports, while providing more detail, continue to cite the Hall study favorably.\nIn the Hall study, the most common emotion experienced in dreams was anxiety. Other emotions included abandonment, anger, fear, joy, and happiness. Negative emotions were much more common than positive ones. The Hall data analysis showed that sexual dreams occur no more than 10% of the time and are more prevalent in young to mid-teens. Another study showed that 8% of both men's and women's dreams have sexual content. In some cases, sexual dreams may result in orgasms or nocturnal emissions. These are colloquially known as \"wet dreams\".\nThe visual nature of dreams is generally highly phantasmagoric; that is, different locations and objects continuously blend into each other. The visuals (including locations, people, and objects) are generally reflective of a person's memories and experiences, but conversation can take on highly exaggerated and bizarre forms. Some dreams may even tell elaborate stories wherein the dreamer enters entirely new, complex worlds and awakes with ideas, thoughts, and feelings never experienced before the dream.\nPeople who are blind from birth do not have visual dreams. Their dream contents are related to other senses, such as hearing, touch, smell, and taste, whichever are present since birth.\nEffects of regional or global catastrophes.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic also influenced the content of people's dreams, according to a scientific study of over 15,000 dream reports by Deirdre Barrett. This analysis revealed that themes involving fear, illness, and death were two to four times more prevalent in dreams following the onset of the pandemic than they were before.\nNeurophysiology.\nDream study is popular with scientists exploring the mind\u2013brain problem. Some \"propose to reduce aspects of dream phenomenology to neurobiology.\" But current science cannot specify dream physiology in detail. Protocols in most nations restrict human brain research to non-invasive procedures. In the United States, invasive brain procedures with a human subject are allowed only when these are deemed necessary in surgical treatment to address medical needs of the same human subject. Non-invasive measures of brain activity like electroencephalogram (EEG) voltage averaging or cerebral blood flow cannot identify small but influential neuronal populations. Also, fMRI signals are too slow to explain how brains compute in real time.\nScientists researching some brain functions can work around current restrictions by examining animal subjects. As stated by the Society for Neuroscience, \"Because no adequate alternatives exist, much of this research must \"[sic]\" be done on animal subjects.\" However, since animal dreaming can be only inferred, not confirmed, animal studies yield no hard facts to illuminate the neurophysiology of dreams. Examining human subjects with brain lesions can provide clues, but the lesion method cannot discriminate between the effects of destruction and disconnection and cannot target specific neuronal groups in heterogeneous regions like the brain stem.\nGeneration.\nDenied precision tools and obliged to depend on imaging, much dream research has succumbed to the law of the instrument. Studies detect an increase of blood flow in a specific brain region and then credit that region with a role in generating dreams. But pooling study results has led to the newer conclusion that dreaming involves large numbers of regions and pathways, which likely are different for different dream events.\nImage creation in the brain involves significant neural activity downstream from eye intake, and it is theorized that \"the visual imagery of dreams is produced by activation during sleep of the same structures that generate complex visual imagery in waking perception.\"\nDreams present a running narrative rather than exclusively visual imagery. Following their work with split-brain subjects, Gazzaniga and LeDoux postulated, without attempting to specify the neural mechanisms, a \"left-brain interpreter\" that seeks to create a plausible narrative from whatever electro-chemical signals reach the brain's left hemisphere. Sleep research has determined that some brain regions fully active during waking are, during REM sleep, activated only in a partial or fragmentary way. Drawing on this knowledge, textbook author James W. Kalat explains, \"[A] dream represents the brain's effort to make sense of sparse and distorted information... The cortex combines this haphazard input with whatever other activity was already occurring and does its best to synthesize a story that makes sense of the information.\" Neuroscientist Indre Viskontas is even more blunt, calling often bizarre dream content \"just the result of your interpreter trying to create a story out of random neural signaling.\"\nTheories on function.\nFor many humans across multiple eras and cultures, dreams are believed to have functioned as revealers of truths sourced during sleep from gods or other external entities. Ancient Egyptians believed that dreams were the best way to receive divine revelation, and thus they would induce (or \"incubate\") dreams. They went to sanctuaries and slept on special \"dream beds\" in hope of receiving advice, comfort, or healing from the gods. From a Darwinian perspective dreams would have to fulfill some kind of biological requirement, provide some benefit for natural selection to take place, or at least have no negative impact on fitness. Robert (1886), a physician from Hamburg, was the first who suggested that dreams are a need and that they have the function to erase (a) sensory impressions that were not fully worked up, and (b) ideas that were not fully developed during the day. In dreams, incomplete material is either removed (suppressed) or deepened and included into memory. Freud, whose dream studies focused on interpreting dreams, not explaining how or why humans dream, disputed Robert's hypothesis and proposed that dreams preserve sleep by representing as fulfilled those wishes that otherwise would awaken the dreamer. Freud wrote that dreams \"serve the purpose of prolonging sleep instead of waking up. \"Dreams are the\" GUARDIANS \"of sleep and not its disturbers.\"\"\nA turning point in theorizing about dream function came in 1953, when \"Science\" published the Aserinsky and Kleitman paper establishing REM sleep as a distinct phase of sleep and linking dreams to REM sleep. Until and even after publication of the Solms 2000 paper that certified the separability of REM sleep and dream phenomena, many studies purporting to uncover the function of dreams have in fact been studying not dreams but measurable REM sleep.\nTheories of dream function since the identification of REM sleep include:\nHobson's and McCarley's 1977 activation-synthesis hypothesis, which proposed \"a functional role for dreaming sleep in promoting some aspect of the learning process...\" In 2010 a Harvard study was published showing experimental evidence that dreams were correlated with improved learning.\nCrick's and Mitchison's 1983 \"reverse learning\" theory, which states that dreams are like the cleaning-up operations of computers when they are offline, removing (suppressing) parasitic nodes and other \"junk\" from the mind during sleep.\nHartmann's 1995 proposal that dreams serve a \"quasi-therapeutic\" function, enabling the dreamer to process trauma in a safe place.\nRevonsuo's 2000 threat simulation hypothesis, whose premise is that during much of human evolution, physical and interpersonal threats were serious, giving reproductive advantage to those who survived them. Dreaming aided survival by replicating these threats and providing the dreamer with practice in dealing with them. In 2015, Revonsuo proposed social simulation theory, which describes dreams as a simulation for training social skills and bonds.\nEagleman's and Vaughn's 2021 defensive activation theory, which says that, given the brain's neuroplasticity, dreams evolved as a visual hallucinatory activity during sleep's extended periods of darkness, busying the occipital lobe and thereby protecting it from possible appropriation by other, non-vision, sense operations.\nErik Hoel proposes, based on artificial neural networks, that dreams prevent overfitting to past experiences; that is, they enable the dreamer to learn from novel situations.\nReligious and other cultural contexts.\nDreams figure prominently in major world religions. The dream experience for early humans, according to one interpretation, gave rise to the notion of a human \"soul\", a central element in much religious thought. J. W. Dunne wrote: But there can be no reasonable doubt that the idea of a soul must have first arisen in the mind of primitive man as a result of observation of his dreams. Ignorant as he was, he could have come to no other conclusion but that, in dreams, he left his sleeping body in one universe and went wandering off into another. It is considered that, but for that savage, the idea of such a thing as a 'soul' would never have even occurred to mankind...\nHindu.\nIn the Mandukya Upanishad, part of the Veda scriptures of Indian Hinduism, a dream is one of three states that the soul experiences during its lifetime, the other two states being the waking state and the sleep state. The earliest Upanishads, written before 300 BCE, emphasize two meanings of dreams. The first says that dreams are merely expressions of inner desires. The second is the belief of the soul leaving the body and being guided until awakened.\nAbrahamic.\nIn Judaism, dreams are considered part of the experience of the world that can be interpreted and from which lessons can be garnered. It is discussed in the Talmud, Tractate Berachot 55\u201360.\nThe ancient Hebrews connected their dreams heavily with their religion, though the Hebrews were monotheistic and believed that dreams were the voice of one God alone. Hebrews also differentiated between good dreams (from God) and bad dreams (from evil spirits). The Hebrews, like many other ancient cultures, incubated dreams in order to receive a divine revelation. For example, the Hebrew prophet Samuel would \"lie down and sleep in the temple at Shiloh before the Ark and receive the word of the Lord\", and Joseph interpreted a Pharaoh's dream of seven lean cows swallowing seven fat cows as meaning the subsequent seven years would be bountiful, followed by seven years of famine. Most of the dreams in the Bible are in the Book of Genesis.\nChristians mostly shared the beliefs of the Hebrews and thought that dreams were of a supernatural character because the Old Testament includes frequent stories of dreams with divine inspiration. The most famous of these dream stories was Jacob's dream of a ladder that stretches from Earth to Heaven. Many Christians preach that God can speak to people through their dreams. The famous glossary, the Somniale Danielis, written in the name of Daniel, attempted to teach Christian populations to interpret their dreams.\nIain R. Edgar has researched the role of dreams in Islam. He has argued that dreams play an important role in the history of Islam and the lives of Muslims, since dream interpretation is the only way that Muslims can receive revelations from God since the death of the last prophet, Muhammad. According to Edgar, Islam classifies three types of dreams. Firstly, there is the true dream (al-ru\u2019ya), then the false dream, which may come from the devil (shaytan), and finally, the meaningless everyday dream (hulm). This last dream could be brought forth by the dreamer's ego or base appetite based on what they experienced in the real world. The true dream is often indicated by Islam's hadith tradition. In one narration by Aisha, the wife of the Prophet, it is said that the Prophet's dreams would come true like the ocean's waves. Just as in its predecessors, the Quran also recounts the story of Joseph and his unique ability to interpret dreams.\nIn both Christianity and Islam dreams feature in conversion stories. According to ancient authors, Constantine the Great started his conversion to Christianity because he had a dream which prophesied that he would win the battle of the Milvian Bridge if he adopted the Chi-Rho as his battle standard.\"\nBuddhist.\nIn Buddhism, ideas about dreams are similar to the classical and folk traditions in South Asia. The same dream is sometimes experienced by multiple people, as in the case of the Buddha-to-be, before he is leaving his home. It is described in the \"Mah\u0101vastu\" that several of the Buddha's relatives had premonitory dreams preceding this. Some dreams are also seen to transcend time: the Buddha-to-be has certain dreams that are the same as those of previous Buddhas, the \"Lalitavistara\" states. In Buddhist literature, dreams often function as a \"signpost\" motif to mark certain stages in the life of the main character.\nBuddhist views about dreams are expressed in the P\u0101li Commentaries and the Milinda Pa\u00f1h\u0101.\nOther.\nIn Chinese history, people wrote of two vital aspects of the soul of which one is freed from the body during slumber to journey in a dream realm, while the other remained in the body. This belief and dream interpretation had been questioned since early times, such as by the philosopher Wang Chong (\u00a0CE).\nThe Babylonians and Assyrians divided dreams into \"good,\" which were sent by the gods, and \"bad,\" sent by demons. A surviving collection of dream omens entitled \"I\u0161kar Zaq\u012bqu\" records various dream scenarios as well as prognostications of what will happen to the person who experiences each dream, apparently based on previous cases. Some list different possible outcomes, based on occasions in which people experienced similar dreams with different results. The Greeks shared their beliefs with the Egyptians on how to interpret good and bad dreams, and the idea of incubating dreams. Morpheus, the Greek god of dreams, also sent warnings and prophecies to those who slept at shrines and temples. The earliest Greek beliefs about dreams were that their gods physically visited the dreamers, where they entered through a keyhole, exiting the same way after the divine message was given.\nAntiphon wrote the first known Greek book on dreams in the 5th century BCE. In that century, other cultures influenced Greeks to develop the belief that souls left the sleeping body. The father of modern medicine, Hippocrates (\u00a0BCE), thought dreams could analyze illness and predict diseases. For instance, a dream of a dim star high in the night sky indicated problems in the head region, while low in the night sky indicated bowel issues. Galen (129\u2013216 AD) believed the same thing. Greek philosopher Plato (427\u2013347 BCE) wrote that people harbor secret, repressed desires, such as incest, murder, adultery, and conquest, which build up during the day and run rampant during the night in dreams. Plato's student, Aristotle (384\u2013322 BCE), believed dreams were caused by processing incomplete physiological activity during sleep, such as eyes trying to see while the sleeper's eyelids were closed. Marcus Tullius Cicero, for his part, believed that all dreams are produced by thoughts and conversations a dreamer had during the preceding days. Cicero's \"Somnium Scipionis\" described a lengthy dream vision, which in turn was commented on by Macrobius in his \"Commentarii in Somnium Scipionis\".\nHerodotus in his \"The Histories\", writes \"The visions that occur to us in dreams are, more often than not, the things we have been concerned about during the day.\"\nThe Dreaming is a common term within the animist creation narrative of indigenous Australians for a personal, or group, creation and for what may be understood as the \"timeless time\" of formative creation and perpetual creating.\nSome Indigenous American tribes and Mexican populations believe that dreams are a way of visiting and having contact with their ancestors. Some Native American tribes have used vision quests as a rite of passage, fasting and praying until an anticipated guiding dream was received, to be shared with the rest of the tribe upon their return.\nInterpretation.\nBeginning in the late 19th century, Austrian neurologist Sigmund Freud, founder of psychoanalysis, theorized that dreams reflect the dreamer's unconscious mind and specifically that dream content is shaped by unconscious wish fulfillment. He argued that important unconscious desires often relate to early childhood memories and experiences. Carl Jung and others expanded on Freud's idea that dream content reflects the dreamer's unconscious desires.\nDream interpretation can be a result of subjective ideas and experiences. One study found that most people believe that \"their dreams reveal meaningful hidden truths\". The researchers surveyed students in the United States, South Korea, and India, and found that 74% of Indians, 65% of South Koreans and 56% of Americans believed their dream content provided them with meaningful insight into their unconscious beliefs and desires. This Freudian view of dreaming was believed significantly more than theories of dreaming that attribute dream content to memory consolidation, problem-solving, or as a byproduct of unrelated brain activity. The same study found that people attribute more importance to dream content than to similar thought content that occurs while they are awake. Americans were more likely to report that they would intentionally miss their flight if they dreamt of their plane crashing than if they thought of their plane crashing the night before flying (while awake), and that they would be as likely to miss their flight if they dreamt of their plane crashing the night before their flight as if there was an actual plane crash on the route they intended to take. Participants in the study were more likely to perceive dreams to be meaningful when the content of dreams was in accordance with their beliefs and desires while awake. They were more likely to view a positive dream about a friend to be meaningful than a positive dream about someone they disliked, for example, and were more likely to view a negative dream about a person they disliked as meaningful than a negative dream about a person they liked.\nAccording to surveys, it is common for people to feel their dreams are predicting subsequent life events. Psychologists have explained these experiences in terms of memory biases, namely a selective memory for accurate predictions and distorted memory so that dreams are retrospectively fitted onto life experiences. The multi-faceted nature of dreams makes it easy to find connections between dream content and real events. The term \"veridical dream\" has been used to indicate dreams that reveal or contain truths not yet known to the dreamer, whether future events or secrets.\nIn one experiment, subjects were asked to write down their dreams in a diary. This prevented the selective memory effect, and the dreams no longer seemed accurate about the future. Another experiment gave subjects a fake diary of a student with apparently precognitive dreams. This diary described events from the person's life, as well as some predictive dreams and some non-predictive dreams. When subjects were asked to recall the dreams they had read, they remembered more of the successful predictions than unsuccessful ones.\nImages and literature.\nGraphic artists, writers and filmmakers all have found dreams to offer a rich vein for creative expression. In the West, artists' depictions of dreams in Renaissance and Baroque art often were related to Biblical narrative. Especially preferred by visual artists were the Jacob's Ladder dream in Genesis and St. Joseph's dreams in the Gospel according to Matthew.\nMany later graphic artists have depicted dreams, including Japanese woodblock artist Hokusai (1760\u20131849) and Western European painters Rousseau (1844\u20131910), Picasso (1881\u20131973), and Dal\u00ed (1904\u20131989).\nIn literature, dream frames were frequently used in medieval allegory to justify the narrative; \"The Book of the Duchess\" and \"The Vision Concerning Piers Plowman\" are two such dream visions. Even before them, in antiquity, the same device had been used by Cicero and Lucian of Samosata.\nDreams have also featured in fantasy and speculative fiction since the 19th century. One of the best-known dream worlds is Wonderland from Lewis Carroll's \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\", as well as Looking-Glass Land from its sequel, \"Through the Looking-Glass\". Unlike many dream worlds, Carroll's logic is like that of actual dreams, with transitions and flexible causality.\nOther fictional dream worlds include the Dreamlands of H. P. Lovecraft's \"Dream Cycle\" and \"The Neverending Story\"'s world of Fantastica, which includes places like the Desert of Lost Dreams, the Sea of Possibilities and the Swamps of Sadness. Dreamworlds, shared hallucinations and other alternate realities feature in a number of works by Philip K. Dick, such as \"The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch\" and \"Ubik\". Similar themes were explored by Jorge Luis Borges, for instance in \"The Circular Ruins\".\nModern popular culture often conceives of dreams, as did Freud, as expressions of the dreamer's deepest fears and desires. In speculative fiction, the line between dreams and reality may be blurred even more in service to the story. Dreams may be psychically invaded or manipulated (\"Dreamscape\", 1984; the \"Nightmare on Elm Street\" films, 1984\u20132010; \"Inception\", 2010) or even come literally true (as in \"The Lathe of Heaven\", 1971).\nLucidity.\nLucid dreaming is the conscious perception of one's state while dreaming. In this state the dreamer may often have some degree of control over their own actions within the dream or even the characters and the environment of the dream. Dream control has been reported to improve with practiced deliberate lucid dreaming, but the ability to control aspects of the dream is not necessary for a dream to qualify as \"lucid\"\u2014a lucid dream is any dream during which the dreamer knows they are dreaming. The occurrence of lucid dreaming has been scientifically verified.\n\"Oneironaut\" is a term sometimes used for those who lucidly dream.\nIn 1975, psychologist Keith Hearne successfully recorded a communication from a dreamer experiencing a lucid dream. On April 12, 1975, after agreeing to move his eyes left and right upon becoming lucid, the subject and Hearne's co-author on the resulting article, Alan Worsley, successfully carried out this task. Years later, psychophysiologist Stephen LaBerge conducted similar work including:\nCommunication between two dreamers has also been documented. The processes involved included EEG monitoring, ocular signaling, incorporation of reality in the form of red light stimuli and a coordinating website. The website tracked when both dreamers were dreaming and sent the stimulus to one of the dreamers where it was incorporated into the dream. This dreamer, upon becoming lucid, signaled with eye movements; this was detected by the website whereupon the stimulus was sent to the second dreamer, invoking incorporation into that dreamer's dream.\nRecollection.\nThe recollection of dreams is extremely unreliable, though it is a skill that can be trained. Dreams can usually be recalled if a person is awakened while dreaming. Women tend to have more frequent dream recall than men. Dreams that are difficult to recall may be characterized by relatively little affect, and factors such as salience, arousal, and interference play a role in dream recall. Often, a dream may be recalled upon viewing or hearing a random trigger or stimulus. The salience hypothesis proposes that dream content that is salient, that is, novel, intense, or unusual, is more easily remembered. There is considerable evidence that vivid, intense, or unusual dream content is more frequently recalled. A dream journal can be used to assist dream recall, for personal interest or psychotherapy purposes.\nAdults report remembering around two dreams per week, on average. Unless a dream is particularly vivid and if one wakes during or immediately after it, the content of the dream is typically not remembered.\nIn line with the salience hypothesis, there is considerable evidence that people who have more vivid, intense or unusual dreams show better recall. There is evidence that continuity of consciousness is related to recall. Specifically, people who have vivid and unusual experiences during the day tend to have more memorable dream content and hence better dream recall. People who score high on measures of personality traits associated with creativity, imagination, and fantasy, such as openness to experience, daydreaming, fantasy proneness, absorption, and hypnotic susceptibility, tend to show more frequent dream recall. There is also evidence for continuity between the bizarre aspects of dreaming and waking experience. That is, people who report more bizarre experiences during the day, such as people high in schizotypy (psychosis proneness), have more frequent dream recall and also report more frequent nightmares.\nDream-recording machine.\nRecording or reconstructing dreams may one day assist with dream recall. Using the permitted non-invasive technologies, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electromyography (EMG), researchers have been able to identify basic dream imagery, dream speech activity and dream motor behavior (such as walking and hand movements).\nMiscellany.\nIllusion of reality.\nSome philosophers have proposed that what we think of as the \"real world\" could be or is an illusion (an idea known as the skeptical hypothesis about ontology). The first recorded mention of the idea was in the 4th century BCE by Zhuangzi, and in Eastern philosophy, the problem has been named the \"Zhuangzi Paradox.\"\nHe who dreams of drinking wine may weep when morning comes; he who dreams of weeping may in the morning go off to hunt. While he is dreaming he does not know it is a dream, and in his dream he may even try to interpret a dream. Only after he wakes does he know it was a dream. And someday there will be a great awakening when we know that this is all a great dream. Yet the stupid believe they are awake, busily and brightly assuming they understand things, calling this man ruler, that one herdsman\u2014how dense! Confucius and you are both dreaming! And when I say you are dreaming, I am dreaming, too. Words like these will be labeled the Supreme Swindle. Yet, after ten thousand generations, a great sage may appear who will know their meaning, and it will still be as though he appeared with astonishing speed.\nThe idea also is discussed in Hindu and Buddhist writings. It was formally introduced to Western philosophy by Descartes in the 17th century in his \"Meditations on First Philosophy\".\nAbsent-minded transgression.\nDreams of absent-minded transgression (DAMT) are dreams wherein the dreamer absent-mindedly performs an action that he or she has been trying to stop (one classic example is of a quitting smoker having dreams of lighting a cigarette). Subjects who have had DAMT have reported waking with intense feelings of guilt. One study found a positive association between having these dreams and successfully stopping the behavior.\nNon-REM dreams.\nHypnogogic and hypnopompic dreams, dreamlike states shortly after falling asleep and shortly before awakening, and dreams during stage 2 of NREM-sleep, also occur, but are shorter than REM-dreams.\nDaydreams.\nA daydream is a visionary fantasy, especially one of happy, pleasant thoughts, hopes or ambitions, imagined as coming to pass, and experienced while awake. There are many different types of daydreams, and there is no consistent definition amongst psychologists. The general public also uses the term for a broad variety of experiences. Research by Harvard psychologist Deirdre Barrett has found that people who experience vivid dreamlike mental images reserve the word for these, whereas many other people refer to milder imagery, realistic future planning, review of memories or just \"spacing out\"\u2014i.e. one's mind going relatively blank\u2014when they talk about \"daydreaming\".\nWhile daydreaming has long been derided as a lazy, non-productive pastime, it is now commonly acknowledged that daydreaming can be constructive in some contexts. There are numerous examples of people in creative or artistic careers, such as composers, novelists and filmmakers, developing new ideas through daydreaming. Similarly, research scientists, mathematicians and physicists have developed new ideas by daydreaming about their subject areas.\nHallucination.\nA hallucination, in the broadest sense of the word, is a perception in the absence of a stimulus. In a stricter sense, hallucinations are perceptions in a conscious and awake state, in the absence of external stimuli, and have qualities of real perception, in that they are vivid, substantial, and located in external objective space. The latter definition distinguishes hallucinations from the related phenomena of dreaming, which does not involve wakefulness.\nNightmare.\nA nightmare is an unpleasant dream that can cause a strong negative emotional response from the mind, typically fear or horror, but also despair, anxiety and great sadness. The dream may contain situations of danger, discomfort, psychological or physical terror. Sufferers usually awaken in a state of distress and may be unable to return to sleep for a prolonged period of time.\nNight terror.\nA night terror, also known as a sleep terror or \"pavor nocturnus\", is a parasomnia disorder that predominantly affects children, causing feelings of terror or dread. Night terrors should not be confused with nightmares, which are bad dreams that cause the feeling of horror or fear.\nD\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\nOne theory of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu attributes the feeling of having previously seen or experienced something to having dreamed about a similar situation or place, and forgetting about it until one seems to be mysteriously reminded of the situation or the place while awake.\nMelatonin.\nMelatonin is a natural hormone secreted by the brain's pineal gland, inducing nocturnal behaviors in animals and sleep in humans during nighttime. Chemically isolated in 1958, melatonin has been marketed as a sleep aid since the 1990s and is currently sold in the United States as an over-the-counter product requiring no prescription. Anecdotal reports and formal research studies over the past few decades have established a link between melatonin supplementation and more vivid dreams.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As another example, the statement \"the solution to an indefinite integral is sin(\"x\"), up to addition of a constant\" tacitly employs the equivalence relation R between functions, defined by \"fRg\" if the difference \"f\"\u2212\"g\" is a constant function, and means that the solution and the function sin(\"x\") are equal up to this R.\nIn the picture, \"there are 4 partitions up to rotation\" means that the set P has 4 equivalence classes with respect to R defined by \"aRb\" if b can be obtained from a by rotation; one representative from each class is shown in the bottom left picture part.\nEquivalence relations are often used to disregard possible differences of objects, so \"up to R\" can be understood informally as \"ignoring the same subtleties as R ignores\".\nIn the factorization example, \"up to ordering\" means \"ignoring the particular ordering\".\nFurther examples include \"up to isomorphism\", \"up to permutations\", and \"up to rotations\", which are described in the Examples section.\nIn informal contexts, mathematicians often use the word modulo (or simply mod) for similar purposes, as in \"modulo isomorphism\".\nObjects that are distinct up to an equivalence relation defined by a group action, such as rotation, reflection, or permutation, can be counted using Burnside's lemma or its generalization, P\u00f3lya enumeration theorem.\nExamples.\nTetris.\nConsider the seven Tetris pieces (I, J, L, O, S, T, Z), known mathematically as the tetrominoes. If you consider all the possible rotations of these pieces \u2014 for example, if you consider the \"I\" oriented vertically to be distinct from the \"I\" oriented horizontally \u2014 then you find there are 19 distinct possible shapes to be displayed on the screen. (These 19 are the so-called \"fixed\" tetrominoes.) But if rotations are not considered distinct \u2014 so that we treat both \"I vertically\" and \"I horizontally\" indifferently as \"I\" \u2014 then there are only seven. We say that \"there are seven tetrominoes, up to rotation\". One could also say that \"there are five tetrominoes, up to rotation and reflection\", which accounts for the fact that L reflected gives J, and S reflected gives Z.\nEight queens.\nIn the eight queens puzzle, if the queens are considered to be distinct (e.g. if they are colored with eight different colors), then there are 3709440 distinct solutions. Normally, however, the queens are considered to be interchangeable, and one usually says \"there are 3,709,440 / 8! = 92 unique solutions up to permutation of the queens\", or that \"there are 92 solutions modulo the names of the queens\", signifying that two different arrangements of the queens are considered equivalent if the queens have been permuted, as long as the set of occupied squares remains the same.\nIf, in addition to treating the queens as identical, rotations and reflections of the board were allowed, we would have only 12 distinct solutions \"up to symmetry and the naming of the queens\". For more, see .\nPolygons.\nThe regular n-gon, for a fixed n, is unique up to similarity. In other words, the \"similarity\" equivalence relation over the regular n-gons (for a fixed n) has only one equivalence class; it is impossible to produce two regular n-gons which are not similar to each other.\nGroup theory.\nIn group theory, one may have a group G acting on a set X, in which case, one might say that two elements of X are equivalent \"up to the group action\"\u2014if they lie in the same orbit.\nAnother typical example is the statement that \"there are two different groups of order 4 up to isomorphism\", or \"modulo isomorphism, there are two groups of order 4\". This means that, if one considers isomorphic groups \"equivalent\", there are only two equivalence classes of groups of order 4, prototypically the cyclic group of order 4 and the Klein four-group.\nNonstandard analysis.\nA hyperreal x and its standard part st(\"x\") are equal up to an infinitesimal difference."}

As of 2025, with a population of 39,778, it is the 2nd-largest municipality in the metropolitan city.\nHistory.\nAncient history.\nIn the area corresponding to the current municipal area, the following ancient settlements were identified:\nIn 265 BC, the Battle of Longano, between the army of Hiero II of Syracuse and the Mamertines under the command of the leader Cione, took place in this area. The exact assignment of the place in the absence of identifiable cause remains earthquakes, floods, or diversion of water courses. There are several hypotheses that place the event along the courses of the rivers bordering the \"Mela\" or \"Patr\u00ec\", and other in the vicinity of the mythical city \"Longane\" (Rod\u00ec Milici) or \"Abacena\" (Tripi), however settlements related to the same conflict.\nOrigins and etymology.\nBarcellona Pozzo di Gotto lies in the plain that slopes to the north close to the lush hills and the chain of Peloritani mountains, overlooking the Gulf of Patti in the Tyrrhenian Sea on the part near the Aeolian Islands in a portion of coast between the Milazzo peninsula to the east and to the west promontory of Tindari.\nThe most credible hypothesis for the derivation of its name is that it was derived during the era of rule by the Kingdom of Aragon (1282\u20131516). It is likely the first rulers of the town came from the County of Barcelona.\nThe oldest part of the town, Pozzo di Gotto, owes its name to the digging of a well for irrigation in cultivated lands located between the rivers Idria and Longano, belonging to Nicholas Goto as described in Vulgar Latin in a document dated 1463: \" ... Nicolao de Gotho, ..., in quo Puzzo de Gotho ...\". In 1571 Pozzogottesi obtained from the Grand Court of the Archbishop of Messina permission to elect their chaplain stationed in San Vito no longer dependant on the Archpriest of Milazzo. The Spanish Viceroy removed Pozzo di Gotto from the under the jurisdiction of Milazzo on 22 May 1639, and ratified by royal during the reign of Philip IV of Spain, and the town assumes the title \"Libera et Realis Civitas Putei de Gotho\". The village in the west of the river Longano in turn under the jurisdiction of Castroreale and had already followed the example of the neighboring community, rebelling against the jurors castrensian doing in the Church to recognize its independence. Notarial deeds dating back to 1522 in Castroreale report the name of the district or hamlet of \"Barsalona\", a name likely to be attributed to the presence in the baptismal books of Pozzo di Gotto the name of \"Graziosa Barsalona\", on the other hand is supported the thesis that the name of the location has been given by Iberian sailors having recognizing the remarkable similarity of the two territories.\nThe autonomy of the village of Barcellona was accepted by the Sicilian Parliament, recognized by the King on 15 May 1815 and ratified in Vienna 28 February 1823, by King Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies. The administrative union decreed 5 January 1835, comes into force on 1 June 1836 at the behest of King Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies, deciding that the new municipality formed by the merger of the two ancient districts bore the full name of Barcellona Pozzo di Gotto. Are discarded by the King all the advanced options of names derived from the word \"Longano\", receiving the unanimous appreciation, on the other hand the initial goodwill will turn into hatred and resentment towards the monarch as a result of criminal actions undertaken throughout the province, especially in Milazzo and Messina, which earned him the nickname of \"King Bomb\". The city soon established covered a certain role with significant contributions to the definitive expulsion of the House of Bourbon from the province and the whole of Sicily and increasingly effective input in all the events included in the process of unification of constituting Kingdom of Italy.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAs of 2025, Barcellona Pozzo di Gotto has a population of 39,778, of whom 49.0% are male and 51.0% are female.

{"id": "44790", "revid": "49473971", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44790", "title": "Luminosity", "text": "Measurement of radiant electromagnetic power emitted by an object\nLuminosity is an absolute measure of radiated electromagnetic energy per unit time, and is synonymous with the radiant power emitted by a light-emitting object. In astronomy, luminosity is the total amount of electromagnetic energy emitted per unit of time by a star, galaxy, or other astronomical objects.\nIn SI units, luminosity is measured in joules per second, or watts. In astronomy, values for luminosity are often given in the terms of the luminosity of the Sun, \"L\"\u2299. Luminosity can also be given in terms of the astronomical magnitude system: the absolute bolometric magnitude (\"M\"bol) of an object is a logarithmic measure of its total energy emission rate, while absolute magnitude is a logarithmic measure of the luminosity within some specific wavelength range or filter band.\nIn contrast, the term \"brightness\" in astronomy is generally used to refer to an object's apparent brightness: that is, how bright an object appears to an observer. Apparent brightness depends on both the luminosity of the object and the distance between the object and observer, and also on any absorption of light along the path from object to observer. Apparent magnitude is a logarithmic measure of apparent brightness. The distance determined by luminosity measures can be somewhat ambiguous, and is thus sometimes called the luminosity distance.\nMeasurement.\nWhen not qualified, the term \"luminosity\" means bolometric luminosity, which is measured either in the SI units, watts, or in terms of solar luminosities (L\u2609). A bolometer is the instrument used to measure radiant energy over a wide band by absorption and measurement of heating. A star also radiates neutrinos, which carry off some energy (about 2% in the case of the Sun), contributing to the star's total luminosity. The IAU has defined a nominal solar luminosity of to promote publication of consistent and comparable values in units of the solar luminosity.\nWhile bolometers do exist, they cannot be used to measure even the apparent brightness of a star because they are insufficiently sensitive across the electromagnetic spectrum and because most wavelengths do not reach the surface of the Earth. In practice bolometric magnitudes are measured by taking measurements at certain wavelengths and constructing a model of the total spectrum that is most likely to match those measurements. In some cases, the process of estimation is extreme, with luminosities being calculated when less than 1% of the energy output is observed, for example with a hot Wolf-Rayet star observed only in the infrared. Bolometric luminosities can also be calculated using a bolometric correction to a luminosity in a particular passband.\nThe term luminosity is also used in relation to particular passbands such as a visual luminosity of K-band luminosity. These are not generally luminosities in the strict sense of an absolute measure of radiated power, but absolute magnitudes defined for a given filter in a photometric system. Several different photometric systems exist. Some such as the UBV or Johnson system are defined against photometric standard stars, while others such as the AB system are defined in terms of a spectral flux density.\nStellar luminosity.\nA star's luminosity can be determined from two stellar characteristics: size and effective temperature. The former is typically represented in terms of solar radii, \"R\"\u2299, while the latter is represented in kelvins, but in most cases neither can be measured directly. To determine a star's radius, two other metrics are needed: the star's angular diameter and its distance from Earth. Both can be measured with great accuracy in certain cases, with cool supergiants often having large angular diameters, and some cool evolved stars having masers in their atmospheres that can be used to measure the parallax using VLBI. However, for most stars the angular diameter or parallax, or both, are far below our ability to measure with any certainty. Since the effective temperature is merely a number that represents the temperature of a black body that would reproduce the luminosity, it obviously cannot be measured directly, but it can be estimated from the spectrum.\nAn alternative way to measure stellar luminosity is to measure the star's apparent brightness and distance. A third component needed to derive the luminosity is the degree of interstellar extinction that is present, a condition that usually arises because of gas and dust present in the interstellar medium (ISM), the Earth's atmosphere, and circumstellar matter. Consequently, one of astronomy's central challenges in determining a star's luminosity is to derive accurate measurements for each of these components, without which an accurate luminosity figure remains elusive. Extinction can only be measured directly if the actual and observed luminosities are both known, but it can be estimated from the observed colour of a star, using models of the expected level of reddening from the interstellar medium.\nIn the current system of stellar classification, stars are grouped according to temperature, with the massive, very young and energetic Class O stars boasting temperatures in excess of 30,000\u00a0K while the less massive, typically older Class M stars exhibit temperatures less than 3,500\u00a0K. Because luminosity is proportional to temperature to the fourth power, the large variation in stellar temperatures produces an even vaster variation in stellar luminosity. Because the luminosity depends on a high power of the stellar mass, high mass luminous stars have much shorter lifetimes. The most luminous stars are always young stars, no more than a few million years for the most extreme. In the Hertzsprung\u2013Russell diagram, the x-axis represents temperature or spectral type while the y-axis represents luminosity or magnitude. The vast majority of stars are found along the main sequence with blue Class O stars found at the top left of the chart while red Class M stars fall to the bottom right. Certain stars like Deneb and Betelgeuse are found above and to the right of the main sequence, more luminous or cooler than their equivalents on the main sequence. Increased luminosity at the same temperature, or alternatively cooler temperature at the same luminosity, indicates that these stars are larger than those on the main sequence and they are called giants or supergiants.\nBlue and white supergiants are high luminosity stars somewhat cooler than the most luminous main sequence stars. A star like Deneb, for example, has a luminosity around 200,000 \"L\"\u2299, a spectral type of A2, and an effective temperature around 8,500\u00a0K, meaning it has a radius around . For comparison, the red supergiant Betelgeuse has a luminosity around 100,000 \"L\"\u2299, a spectral type of M2, and a temperature around 3,500\u00a0K, meaning its radius is about . Red supergiants are the largest type of star, but the most luminous are much smaller and hotter, with temperatures up to 50,000\u00a0K and more and luminosities of several million \"L\"\u2299, meaning their radii are just a few tens of \"R\"\u2299. For example, R136a1 has a temperature over 46,000\u00a0K and a luminosity of more than 6,100,000 \"L\"\u2299 (mostly in the UV), it is only .\nRadio luminosity.\nThe luminosity of a radio source is measured in W Hz\u22121, to avoid having to specify a bandwidth over which it is measured. The observed strength, or flux density, of a radio source is measured in Jansky where 1 Jy \n 10\u221226 W m\u22122 Hz\u22121.\nFor example, consider a 10W transmitter at a distance of 1 million metres, radiating over a bandwidth of 1\u00a0MHz. By the time that power has reached the observer, the power is spread over the surface of a sphere with area 4\"\u03c0r\"2 or about 1.26\u00d71013 m2, so its flux density is 10 / 106 / (1.26\u00d71013) W m\u22122 Hz\u22121 = 8\u00d7107 Jy.\nMore generally, for sources at cosmological distances, a k-correction must be made for the spectral index \u03b1 of the source, and a relativistic correction must be made for the fact that the frequency scale in the emitted rest frame is different from that in the observer's rest frame. So the full expression for radio luminosity, assuming isotropic emission, is\nformula_1\nwhere \"L\"\u03bd is the luminosity in W Hz\u22121, \"S\"obs is the observed flux density in W m\u22122 Hz\u22121, \"DL\" is the luminosity distance in metres, \"z\" is the redshift, \"\u03b1\" is the spectral index (in the sense formula_2, and in radio astronomy, assuming thermal emission the spectral index is typically equal to 2.)\nFor example, consider a 1 Jy signal from a radio source at a redshift of 1, at a frequency of 1.4\u00a0GHz.\nhttp:// calculates a luminosity distance for a redshift of 1 to be 6701 Mpc = 2\u00d71026 m giving a radio luminosity of 10\u221226 \u00d7 4\u03c0(2\u00d71026)2 / (1 + 1)(1 + 2) = 6\u00d71026 W Hz\u22121.\nTo calculate the total radio power, this luminosity must be integrated over the bandwidth of the emission. A common assumption is to set the bandwidth to the observing frequency, which effectively assumes the power radiated has uniform intensity from zero frequency up to the observing frequency. In the case above, the total power is 4\u00d71027 \u00d7 1.4\u00d7109 = 5.7\u00d71036 W. This is sometimes expressed in terms of the total (i.e. integrated over all wavelengths) luminosity of the Sun which is 3.86\u00d71026 W, giving a radio power of 1.5\u00d71010 \"L\"\u2299.\nLuminosity formulae.\nThe Stefan\u2013Boltzmann equation applied to a black body gives the value for luminosity for a black body, an idealized object which is perfectly opaque and non-reflecting:\nformula_3\nwhere \"A\" is the surface area, \"T\" is the temperature (in kelvins) and \"\u03c3\" is the Stefan\u2013Boltzmann constant, with a value of .\nImagine a point source of light of luminosity formula_4 that radiates equally in all directions. A hollow sphere centered on the point would have its entire interior surface illuminated. As the radius increases, the surface area will also increase, and the constant luminosity has more surface area to illuminate, leading to a decrease in observed brightness.\nformula_5\nwhere\nThe surface area of a sphere with radius \"r\" is formula_8, so for stars and other point sources of light: \nformula_9\nwhere formula_10 is the distance from the observer to the light source.\nFor stars on the main sequence, luminosity is also related to mass approximately as below:\nformula_11\nRelationship to magnitude.\nLuminosity is an intrinsic measurable property of a star independent of distance. The concept of magnitude, on the other hand, incorporates distance. The apparent magnitude is a measure of the diminishing flux of light as a result of distance according to the inverse-square law. The Pogson logarithmic scale is used to measure both apparent and absolute magnitudes, the latter corresponding to the brightness of a star or other celestial body as seen if it would be located at an interstellar distance of . In addition to this brightness decrease from increased distance, there is an extra decrease of brightness due to extinction from intervening interstellar dust.\nBy measuring the width of certain absorption lines in the stellar spectrum, it is often possible to assign a certain luminosity class to a star without knowing its distance. Thus a fair measure of its absolute magnitude can be determined without knowing its distance nor the interstellar extinction.\nIn measuring star brightnesses, absolute magnitude, apparent magnitude, and distance are interrelated parameters\u2014if two are known, the third can be determined. Since the Sun's luminosity is the standard, comparing these parameters with the Sun's apparent magnitude and distance is the easiest way to remember how to convert between them, although officially, zero point values are defined by the IAU.\nThe magnitude of a star, a unitless measure, is a logarithmic scale of observed visible brightness. The apparent magnitude is the observed visible brightness from Earth which depends on the distance of the object. The absolute magnitude is the apparent magnitude at a distance of , therefore the bolometric absolute magnitude is a logarithmic measure of the bolometric luminosity.\nThe difference in bolometric magnitude between two objects is related to their luminosity ratio according to:\nformula_12\nwhere:\nThe zero point of the absolute magnitude scale is actually defined as a fixed luminosity of . Therefore, the absolute magnitude can be calculated from a luminosity in watts:\nformula_17\nwhere \"L\"0 is the zero point luminosity \nand the luminosity in watts can be calculated from an absolute magnitude (although absolute magnitudes are often not measured relative to an absolute flux):\nformula_18\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "44793", "revid": "49052814", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44793", "title": "Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act", "text": "Act of Congress in the United States\nThe Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) is an act of the United States Congress, passed in 1986 as part of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA). It requires hospital emergency departments that accept payments from Medicare to provide an appropriate \"medical screening examination\" (MSE) for anyone seeking treatment for a medical condition regardless of citizenship, legal status, or ability to pay. Participating hospitals may not transfer or discharge patients needing emergency treatment except with the informed consent or stabilization of the patient or when the patient's condition requires transfer to a hospital better equipped to administer the treatment.\nEMTALA applies to \"participating hospitals\". The statute defines participating hospitals as those that accept payment from the Department of Health and Human Services', Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) under the Medicare program. Because there are very few hospitals that do not accept Medicare, the law applies to nearly all hospitals. The combined payments of Medicare and Medicaid, $602 billion in 2004, or roughly 44% of all medical expenditures in the United States, make not participating in EMTALA impractical for nearly all hospitals. EMTALA's provisions apply to all patients, not just to Medicare patients.\nThe cost of emergency care required by EMTALA is not covered directly by the federal government, so it has been characterized as an unfunded mandate. In 2009, uncompensated care represents 55% of emergency room care, and 6% of total hospital costs.\nPrior legislation.\nThe Hill-Burton Act of 1946, which provided federal assistance for the construction of community hospitals, established nondiscrimination requirements for institutions that received such federal assistance\u2014including the requirement that a \"reasonable volume\" of free emergency care be provided for community members who could not pay\u2014for a period for 20 years after the hospital's construction. Amendments to the act in 1975 removed the 20-year expiration date and instead required hospitals receiving Hill-Burton funding to provide free care in perpetuity. However, the provisions of the act were vague and rarely enforced.\nMandated and non-mandated care.\nCongress passed EMTALA to eliminate the practice of \"patient dumping\"\u2014that is, refusal to treat people because of inability to pay or insufficient insurance or transferring or discharging emergency patients on the basis of high anticipated diagnosis and treatment costs. The law applies when an individual seeks treatment for a medical condition \"or a request is made on the individual's behalf for examination or treatment for that medical condition.\"\nThe U.S. government defines an emergency department as \"a specially equipped and staffed area of the hospital used a significant portion of the time for initial evaluation and treatment of outpatients for emergency medical conditions.\" That means, for example, that outpatient clinics not equipped to handle medical emergencies are not obligated under EMTALA and can simply refer patients to a nearby emergency department for care.\nAn emergency medical condition (EMC) is defined as \"a condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain) such that the absence of immediate medical attention could reasonably be expected to result in placing the individual's health [or the health of an unborn child] in serious jeopardy, serious impairment to bodily functions, or serious dysfunction of bodily organs.\" For example, a pregnant woman with an emergency condition and/or currently in labor must be treated until delivery is complete, until the woman and the fetus are stabilized, or until a qualified personnel identifies the labor as a \"false labor\" or Braxton Hicks contractions, unless a transfer under the statute is appropriate.\nPatients treated under EMTALA may not be able to pay or have insurance or other programs pay for the associated costs but are legally responsible for any costs incurred as a result of their care under civil law.\nNon-covered medical conditions.\nNot all medical conditions qualify for uncompensated mandated services imposed by EMTALA, which is contrary to the misperception that many individuals assume: that if they are ill, they will be treated regardless of their ability to pay.\nThe sole purpose of the EMTALA-mandated MSE is to require emergency departments to make a determination about whether an emergency medical condition does or does not exist, using their normal assessment and diagnostic protocols. Because the MSE is a mandated EMTALA service, health insurers are required to cover benefits for their subscribers. They are also required to cover EMTALA mandated services necessary to stabilize individuals determined to have an EMC.\nEMTALA intentionally omitted requirements that hospitals provide uncompensated stabilizing treatment for individuals with medical conditions determined not to be EMCs. Therefore, such individuals are not eligible for further uncompensated examination and treatment beyond the MSE.\nA significant portion of emergency department visits are considered not to be EMCs as defined by EMTALA. The medical profession refers to such cases as \"non-emergent\". Regardless, the term is not recognized by law as a condition defined by the EMTALA statute. A term more relevant for compliance with EMTALA is \"non-emergency medical condition\". If the \"non-emergent\" term is used in the context of EMTALA, it must be defined as a medical condition that fails to pass the criteria for determination of being a true EMC as defined by EMTALA statute.\nAdmitted patients who experience a medical emergency while at a hospital are normally not covered by EMTALA but are instead protected by varying state laws and quality assurance under the deemed status of the facility.\nHospital obligations.\nHospitals have three obligations under EMTALA:\nAmendments.\nSince the act's original passage, the Congress has passed several amendments to the act. Additionally, state and local laws in some places have imposed further requirements on hospitals. The amendments include the following:\nEffects.\nImproved health services for uninsured patients.\nThe most significant effect is that regardless of insurance status, participating hospitals are prohibited from denying an MSE of individuals seeking treatment for medical conditions. Currently, EMTALA requires only that hospitals stabilize the EMC. According to some analyses of the U.S. health care social safety net, EMTALA is an incomplete and strained program.\nCost pressures on hospitals.\nWhen medical bills go unpaid, health care providers must either shift the costs onto those who can pay or go uncompensated. In the first decade of EMTALA, such cost shifting amounted to a hidden tax levied by providers. For example, it has been estimated that cost shifting has amounted to $455 per individual, or $1,186 per family, in California annually.\nHowever, because of the recent influence of managed care and other cost control initiatives by insurance companies, hospitals are less able to shift costs, and they end up writing off more and more in uncompensated care. The amount of uncompensated care delivered by nonfederal community hospitals grew from $6.1 billion in 1983 to $40.7 billion in 2004, according to a 2004 report from the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, but it is unclear what percentage of the amount was emergency care and therefore attributable to EMTALA.\nFinancial pressures on hospitals in the 20 years since EMTALA's passage have caused hospitals to consolidate or close facilities, thereby contributing to emergency department overcrowding. According to the Institute of Medicine, from 1993 to 2003, emergency department visits in the United States grew by 26 percent, while in the same period, the number of emergency departments declined by 425. Ambulances frequently get diverted from overcrowded emergency departments to other hospitals that may be farther away. In 2003, ambulances got diverted more than half a million times\u2014not necessarily due to patients' inability to pay.\nEmergency abortions.\nAfter \"Roe v. Wade\" (1973) was overturned in June 2022, transforming the legal landscape for abortion in the United States, the HHS issued guidance on EMTALA protections for clinicians that apply regardless of state laws. According to the guidance, which does not change policy, EMTALA, as a federal law, supersedes state laws that ban abortion. So, doctors who perform emergency abortions to stabilize a patient are protected by EMTALA. Hospitals that fail to do so could face fines or be booted from Medicare. The guidance also says EMTALA does not prevent a doctor from being sued, though EMTALA may be used in defense of the doctor in state court actions.\nThe Biden administration filed a motion in federal court to block Idaho's enforcement of that state's abortion ban in cases in which EMTALA applied. The judge ruled against the state and ordered Idaho's law suspended in emergency cases. Idaho appealed the ruling, arguing that the federal government \u201ccannot use EMTALA to override in the emergency room state laws about abortion any more than it can use it to override state law on organ transplants or marijuana use.\u201d The Supreme Court agreed to hear Idaho's challenge to that interpretation of the law in \"Moyle v. United States\" (2024), which was argued that April.\nTexas sued the federal government, winning in federal court. A 5th Circuit judge preliminarily enjoined the Biden administration's EMTALA guidance in Texas.\nIn June 2024, the Supreme Court issued a 6\u20133 ruling in \"Moyle\" which reinstated the lower court ruling requiring EMTALA's emergency abortion provision to be enforced in Idaho. However, the issue remains unresolved, with the ruling only seen as delaying the Idaho state law banning emergency abortions rather than striking it down altogether. However, the Supreme Court ruling did allow for the case to return to a lower court which was previously favorable to upholding EMTALA's emergency abortion provision.\nIn 2025, as part of the second Trump administration's abortion policy, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services rescinded guidance requiring that hospitals provide emergency abortions under EMTALA.\nNotes and references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Already Franz Xaver Kugler proposed that \"tersitu\" can be interpreted as \"table\" here; in another context it seems to mean something like \"tool\", but in yet another the word refers to a blue enamel paste. P. Schnabel, in a series of papers (1923\u20131927), interpreted the phrase as an assignment of authorship. Based on this, he argued that Naburimannu developed the Babylonian System A of calculating Solar System ephemerides, and that Kidinnu later developed Babylonian System B. Otto E. Neugebauer has remained reserved to this conclusion and disputed Schnabel's further inferences about Naburimannu's life and work. The mathematician B.L. van der Waerden later (1963, 1968, 1974) concluded that System A was developed during the reign of Darius I (521\u2013485 BC). System A, which uses step functions, appears to be somewhat more primitive than System B, which uses zigzag linear functions, although System A is more consistent than System B. While it thus appears that System A preceded System B, both systems remained in use at least until the 1st century BC.\nThe earliest preserved System A clay tablets (BM 36651, 36719, 37032, 37053) calculate an ephemeris for the planet Mercury from 424 to 401 BC. The oldest preserved lunar tablets date from 306 BC in the Hellenistic period. If Naburimannu was the originator of System A, then we can on that basis place him in Babylonia sometime between the Persian and Macedonian conquests."}

After a long and distinguished career, culminating in the Maxi Trial in 1986\u20131987, on 23 May 1992, Falcone was assassinated by the Corleonesi Mafia in the Capaci bombing, on the A29 motorway near the town of Capaci.\nHis life parallels that of his close friend Paolo Borsellino. They both spent their early years in the same neighbourhood in Palermo. Though many of their childhood friends grew up in an environment in which the Mafia had a strong presence, both men fought against organised crime as prosecuting magistrates. They were both killed in 1992, a few weeks apart. In recognition of their tireless effort and sacrifice during the anti-mafia trials, they were both awarded the Gold Medal for Civil Valor and were acknowledged as martyrs of the Catholic Church. They were also named as heroes of the last 60 years in the 13 November 2006 issue of \"Time\".\nEarly life.\nFalcone was born in 1939 to a middle-class family in the Via Castrofilippo near the seaport district La Kalsa, a neighbourhood of central Palermo that suffered extensive destruction by aerial attacks during the Allied invasion of Sicily in 1943. His father, Arturo Falcone, the director of a provincial chemical laboratory, was married to Luisa Bentivegna. Giovanni had two older sisters, Anna and Maria. Falcone's parents emphasised the importance of hard work, bravery and patriotism; he later said they 'expected the maximum' from him. At school Falcone would get into fights with bigger children if he thought his friends were being picked on.\nThe Mafia was present in the area but quiescent; Tommaso Spadaro, a boy with whom he played ping-pong in the neighbourhood Catholic Action recreation centre, would later become a notorious Mafia smuggler and killer, but mafiosi were not a major presence in his childhood. As boys, Falcone and Borsellino, who were born in the same neighbourhood, played soccer together on the Piazza Magione. Both had classmates who ended up as mafiosi. Falcone grew up at a time when Sicilians did not acknowledge the existence of the Mafia as a coherent organised group; assertions to the contrary by other Italians were often seen as 'attacks from the north'.\nAfter a classical education, Falcone studied law at the University of Palermo following a brief period of study at Livorno's naval academy. Falcone and Borsellino met again at Palermo University. While Falcone drifted away from his parents' middle-class conservative Catholicism towards communism, Borsellino was religious and conservative; in his youth, he had been a member of the \"Fronte Universitario d'Azione Nazionale\" (FUAN), a right-wing university organisation affiliated with the neo-fascist MSI (Movimento Sociale Italiano). However, neither ever joined a political party, and although the ideologies of their political movements were diametrically opposed, they shared a history of opposing the Mafia. Their different political leanings did not thwart their friendship. Falcone wanted a naval career but his father thought him too independent-minded for the armed forces, and sent him to study law.\nAfter graduating in 1961, Falcone began to practice law before being appointed a judge in 1964. Falcone eventually gravitated toward penal law after serving as a district magistrate. He was assigned to the prosecutor's office in Trapani and Marsala, and then in 1978 to the bankruptcy court in Palermo.\nFirst trial against the Mafia.\nIn early 1980, Falcone joined the \u2018Office of Instruction\u2019 (Ufficio istruzione), the investigative branch of the Prosecution Office of Palermo. He started to work at a particularly tense moment. Judge Cesare Terranova, a former parliamentary deputy and Antimafia reformer who had been the main prosecutor of the Mafia in the 1960s, was to have headed this office, but he was killed on 25 September 1979. Only two months earlier, on 21 July 1979, Boris Giuliano had been assassinated; he headed the police investigation squad investigating heroin trafficking by the Mafia headed by and Salvatore Inzerillo. Taking Terranova's place was Rocco Chinnici, who was murdered by the Mafia in July 1983.\nOn 5 May 1980, Giuliano's successor in investigating the heroin network, Carabinieri captain Emanuele Basile, was killed. The next day, the prosecuting judge Gaetano Costa signed 55 arrest warrants against the heroin-trafficking network of the Spatola-Inzerillo-Gambino clan. From Sicily, heroin was moved to the Gambino crime family in New York, who were related to the Inzerillos. Chinnici appointed Falcone to investigate the case, one of the biggest Antimafia operations in more than a decade. Costa signed the indictments after virtually all of the other prosecutors in his office had declined to do so \u2013 a fact that leaked out of the office and eventually cost him his life: he was murdered on 6 August 1980, on the orders of Inzerillo. Falcone was given bodyguards the next day.\nIn this tense atmosphere, Falcone introduced an innovative investigative technique in the Spatola investigation, seizing bank records to follow \"the money trail\" created by heroin deals to build his case, applying the skills he had learned unravelling bankruptcies. He was probably among the first Sicilian magistrates to establish working relationships with colleagues from other countries, thus developing an early understanding of the global dimensions of heroin trafficking, while enhancing the meagre investigative resources of his office. A colleague was astonished to discover that Falcone, who had no computers at his disposal, was personally recording the details listed on printouts of transactions that he had requisitioned from every bank in Palermo province.\nHe learned that the chemists of the French Connection had moved clandestine labs for refining heroin from Marseille to Sicily. At the end of 1980, he visited the United States and started to work with the U.S. Justice Department, resulting in \"some of the biggest international law enforcement operations in history\", such as the Pizza Connection. The inquiries extended to Turkey, an important stopover on the route of morphine base; to Switzerland, where bank secrecy laws facilitated money laundering; and to Naples, where cigarette smuggling rings were being reconfigured as heroin operations. At the end of 1981, Falcone finalised the Spatola case for trial, which enabled the prosecution to win 74 convictions, based on Falcone's \"web of solid evidence, bank and travel records, seized heroin shipments, fingerprint and handwriting analyses, wiretapped conversations and firsthand testimony\" that proved that \"Sicily had replaced France as the principal gateway for refining and exporting heroin to the United States\".\nAntimafia pool.\nFalcone was plagued by a chronic lack of resources in his capacity as magistrate. A law to create a new offence of Mafia conspiracy and to confiscate Mafia assets was introduced by Pio La Torre, but it had been stalled in parliament for two years before La Torre was murdered on 30 April 1982. In May 1982, the Italian government sent Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa, a general of the Italian Carabinieri, to Sicily with orders to crush the Mafia. However, not long after arriving, on 3 September 1982, the General was gunned down in the city centre, his young wife by his side. Sicilians rose up in outrage. Outside the church, the politicians who attended were jeered and spat on, and blamed by Sicilians for tolerating the Mafia for so long. In response, the Italian government finally offered investigators the backing they needed, and Pio La Torre's law was passed 10 days later.\nFalcone's responsibilities as a magistrate put tremendous strain on his personal life. In May 1986, he married his fianc\u00e9e, Francesca Morvillo; Falcone had Mayor Leoluca Orlando himself conduct the private ceremony.\nHe became part of Palermo's informal Antimafia Pool, created by Judge Rocco Chinnici. This was a group of investigating magistrates who closely worked together sharing information and developing new investigative and prosecutorial strategies. Most important, they assumed collective responsibility for carrying Mafia prosecutions forward: all the members of the pool signed prosecutorial orders to avoid exposing any one of them to particular risk, such as the one that had cost judge Gaetano Costa his life. Along with Falcone, the group included Paolo Borsellino, Giuseppe Di Lello and Leonardo Guarnotta.\nMaxi Trial.\nThe Antimafia pool laid the groundwork for the Maxi Trial against the Sicilian Mafia at the preliminary investigative phase. Following Chinnici's murder in July 1983, Antonino Caponnetto headed the pool. Falcone's friend Antonio Cassara (who headed the police squad hunting fugitives) was murdered in 1985. Falcone led the prosecution for the trial, which began 10 February 1986, and ended on 16 December 1987. Of the 475 defendants\u2014both those present and those tried \"in absentia\"\u2014338 were convicted. A total of 2,665 years of prison sentences was shared out between the guilty, not including the life sentences handed to the 19 leading Mafia bosses and killers, including Michele Greco, Giuseppe Marchese and\u2014\"in absentia\"\u2014Salvatore Riina, Giuseppe Lucchese and Bernardo Provenzano.\nOne of the most important factors in the trial was the testimony of Tommaso Buscetta, the first-ever Sicilian Mafiosi boss to become an informant (pentito). His assertion that the Mafia was not a collection of separate gangs but a single organisation led some magistrates and detectives to question his credibility. After an interview, Falcone became convinced that Buscetta was genuine and treated him with respect. Buscetta's key revelation was that a governing council, known as the Commission or \"Cupula\" headed a collective structure, thereby establishing that the top tier of Mafia members were complicit in all the organisation's crimes. This premise became known as the Buscetta theorem.\nSetback.\nWhen Falcone's record of success and high profile led to resentment from some quarters, he was not given the job he coveted as chief prosecutor in Palermo. The new incumbent did not accept that the hierarchical Mafia structure revealed by the Maxi Trial actually existed, and he attempted to force Falcone to work on cases of wife beating and car theft. Falcone became so frustrated that he spoke of resigning. During 1988 Falcone collaborated with Rudolph Giuliani, at the time U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, in operations against the Gambino and Inzerillo families. Rumours impugning his integrity deeply troubled Falcone during this period.\nOn 20 June 1989, a sack filled with dynamite sticks was discovered near a beach house Falcone had rented in the town of Addaura by policeman Nino Agostino. Although Falcone had been threatened before, this failed attempt bothered him to the extreme because it had all the signs of an inside job. At the time, he was meeting Swiss prosecutors Carla Del Ponte and Claudio Lehman from Lugano who were helping to investigate the Mafia's financial holdings in Switzerland. Falcone believed that the assassination attempt not only involved the Mafia but some people in government as well. During the investigations into the money laundering networks of the Mafia, it became clear that former Palermo police chief Bruno Contrada, who had moved to the intelligence service SISDE, had warned a suspect about his impending arrest so that he could escape in time.\nFalcone received an effusive congratulatory phone call from Giulio Andreotti after the narrow escape. Falcone privately thought it odd that Andreotti, who he had never spoken to, would suddenly contact him, and he mused about the significance of the incident to a friend. Unknown to Falcone the efforts to kill him were suspended while the Maxi trial verdicts went through the appeals process that had often set convicted Mafia members free. Later investigations into the murders of two police officers, Antonino Agostino and Emanuele Piazza, who worked for the secret service, revealed that they had secretly defused the bombs that had been placed by a Mafia commando aided by other secret service men. Agostino and his wife were killed on 5 August 1989 outside their home, and Piazza on 15 March 1990.\nTransfer to Rome.\nExhausted and frustrated by the antagonism in Palermo, Falcone accepted a post in the Ministry of Justice in Rome offered to him by Claudio Martelli, the new minister of Justice in a new government of Giulio Andreotti in March 1991. The transfer was initially seen as a capitulation by Falcone, but he himself thought of it as a tactical move to better fight the Mafia. His first action was to prepare a decree to repair the disastrous sentence by Supreme Court judge Corrado Carnevale, known as the \u201csentence-killer\u201d, that allowed most of the remaining defendants of the Maxi Trial to walk free from prison. The Martelli decree led to the immediate re-arrest of the Mafia bosses.\nWhile in Rome he started to restructure the Italian prosecution system, creating district offices to fight the Mafia and a national office to fight organised crime. Next was his move to prevent Carnevale from reviewing the sentence of the Maxi Trial. In a blow to the Mafia, the Maxi Trial convictions were upheld by the Supreme Court in January 1992. To the surprise of many, Falcone's move to Rome was very successful. He achieved a genuine revolution in the judiciary. The Mafia began to realize that Falcone was even more dangerous in Rome than he had been in Palermo.\nDeath.\nThe Maxi trial sentences being upheld by the Supreme Court were a blow to the Mafia's prestige. The council of top bosses headed by Riina reacted by ordering the assassination of Salvatore Lima (on the grounds that he was an ally of Giulio Andreotti), and Falcone. Lima was shot dead on 12 March 1992.\nGiovanni Brusca was tasked with killing Falcone. Riina wanted the murder carried out in Sicily in a demonstration of Mafia power; he instructed that the attack should be on Highway A29, which Falcone had to use to get from the airport to his home on his weekly visits. Four hundred kilograms (881 lbs.) of explosives were placed in a culvert under the highway between Palermo International Airport and the city of Palermo, near the town of Capaci. Brusca's men carried out test drives, using flashbulbs to simulate detonating the blast on a speeding car, and a concrete structure was specially created and destroyed in an experimental explosion to see if the bomb would be powerful enough. Leoluca Bagarella assisted at the scene during preparations.\nBrusca detonated the device by remote control from a small outbuilding on a hill to the right of the highway on 23 May 1992. Giovanni Falcone, his wife Francesca Morvillo and police officers Rocco Dicillo, Antonio Montinaro and Vito Schifani were killed in the blast. The explosion was so powerful that it registered on local earthquake monitors. Riina reportedly threw a party, toasting Falcone's death with champagne, according to the pentito Salvatore Cancemi.\nThousands gathered at the Church of Saint Dominic for the funerals which were broadcast live on national TV. All regular television programs were suspended. Parliament declared a day of mourning. His colleague Paolo Borsellino was killed in another bombing 57 days later, along with five police officers: Agostino Catalano, Walter Cosina, Emanuela Loi, Vincenzo Li Muli, and Claudio Traina.\nIn the major crackdown against the Mafia following Falcone and Borsellino's deaths, Riina was arrested on 15 January 1993, and was serving a life sentence, until his death in 2017, for sanctioning the murders of both magistrates as well as many other crimes. Brusca, also known as \"lo scannacristiani\" (the people slaughterer), was convicted of Falcone's murder. He was one of Riina's associates and admitted to detonating the explosives. Dozens of mafiosi were sentenced to life imprisonment for their involvement in Falcone's murder.\nReports in May 2019 indicated that a Cosa Nostra insider revealed that John Gotti of the Gambino crime family had sent one of their explosives experts to Sicily to work with the Corleonesi Mafia clan to help plan the bombing that would kill Falcone.\nLegacy.\nPalermo International Airport has been named \"Falcone-Borsellino Airport\" in honour of the two judges and hosts a memorial of the pair by the local sculptor Tommaso Geraci. Monuments commemorating Falcone and the other victims of the Capaci bombing were placed around Italy, including in Peschiera del Garda. Falcone was posthumously awarded the Train Foundation's Civil Courage Prize, which recognises \"extraordinary heroes of conscience\". A monument to Falcone stands also at the FBI's National Academy in Virginia to honour his contributions to the \"Pizza Connection\" case.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The multitude of noble residences in Baroque and Rococo style made the newly founded town of Bagheria known as \"the city of villas\". \nDuring the 19th century the town welcomed numerous working and middle class families and expanded demographically. The autonomous municipality was established in 1820, when Bagheria had completed its evolution from a holiday resort to a small suburban town. In 1852 there were 9,832 inhabitants, 3,664 more than those recorded in 1831. Today the town has over 53,000 inhabitants. \nEtymology.\nAccording to some sources, the name \"Bagheria\" (by way of old Sicilian \"Baar\u00eca\") originates from the Phoenician term \"Bayharia\" meaning \"land that descends toward the sea.\" \nHistory.\nSince its founding, the town has gone by the names of \"Bayharia\", \"Baharia\", and \"Baar\u00eca\". In 1658 Giuseppe Branciforti, Prince of Butera and former Viceroy of Sicily, built a large villa and established the region as the preferred location for the vacation homes of Palermo's elites. Villas like the fortified Villa San Marco (designed by Andrea Cirrincione) with angled bastions and a drawbridge soon followed. The area experienced a boom in villa building roughly coinciding with the period of Savoyard (1713\u201321) and Habsburg (1721\u201330) rule and continuing for several decades thereafter. The two most striking baroque residences, Villa Valguarnera and Villa Palagonia were designed by the architect Tommaso Napoli in 1712 and 1715 respectively. Both were completed only decades later. Napoli had been influenced by his experiences in Rome and Vienna and this is reflected in his designs. Other architects and clients like Giuseppe Mariani and the Prince of Aragona also looked to prints of Roman exemplars when constructing the Villa Aragona (now Cut\u00f2) in 1714.\nBy 1763, tastes were changing. The Villa Villarosa, supervised by the young G. V. Marvuglia, was directly modeled on more neoclassical plans published by Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Neufforge in 1760. In 1769, one of the descendants of the original Prince of Butera redesigned his estate into a well-planned town, allowing him to collect rents from the inhabitants. Bagheria was a preferred stopping point for Europeans pursuing the Grand Tour in Sicily including Patrick Brydone, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, John Soane, Karl Friedrich Schinkel and many others.\nIn the 20th and 21st centuries, the Baroque and Neoclassical architecture of Bagheria was largely obscured by unregulated building.\nReligion.\nAlthough the official feast day of Saint Joseph, the town's patron saint, is March 19, it is celebrated in Bagheria the first Sunday of August; religious celebrations are held throughout the week leading up to Sunday, when more solemn ceremonies are initiated; the following Monday evening festivities conclude with a fireworks display.\nIn popular culture.\nVilla Palagonia appears in the 1962 film \"Mafioso\", directed by Alberto Lattuada. \nItalian director Giuseppe Tornatore portrayed his love for Bagheria in the multiple award-winning film \"Cinema Paradiso\" (\"Nuovo Cinema Paradiso\") in 1989, and again in the 2009 film \"Baar\u00eca\", featuring the history of the town from the 1930s to the 1980s through the life of a local family.\nBagheria is depicted in the 1990 film \"The Godfather Part III\" directed by Francis Ford Coppola.\nVilla Arezzo Spedalotto was used as a set for the 1991 film \"Johnny Stecchino\", directed by Roberto Benigni. \nThe town is the setting of Dacia Maraini's eponymous autobiographical work.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the largest municipality in the Metropolitan City after Messina and Barcellona Pozzo di Gotto. The town has a population of around 31,500 inhabitants.\nFounded by the ancient Greeks around 716 BC and part of Magna Graecia and recognised as a \"Roman civitas\" since 36 BC, the city was also at the centre of history during the First Punic War (260 BC), and in July 1860 with the arrival of the red shirts in the battle of Milazzo during the Expedition of the Thousand, an event of the unification of Italy.\nHistory.\nSeveral civilizations settled in Milazzo and left signs of their presence from the Neolithic age. In Homer's \"Odyssey\" Milazzo is presumably the place where Ulysses is shipwrecked and meets Polyphemus.\nHistorically, the town originated as the ancient Greek \"Mylae\" () in Magna Graecia, an outpost of Zancle, occupied before 648 BC, perhaps as early as 716 BC.\nIt was taken by the Athenians in 426 BC. The people of Rhegium planted the exiles from Naxos and Catana in 395 BC as a counterpoise to Dionysius the Elder's foundation of Tyndaris; but Dionysius soon took it. In the bay Gaius Duilius won the first Roman naval victory over the Carthaginians (260 BC).\nIn 36 BC the naval Battle of Mylae was fought offshore. The fleet of Octavian, commanded by Marcus Agrippa, engaged that of Sextus Pompey. While the battle was nearly a draw, Sextus could not replace his losses, and was thus weaker at the following Battle of Naulochus (36 BC), where he was utterly defeated. It was recognised as a \"Roman civitas\" in the same year. \nAfter the fall of the Western Roman Empire, under the Byzantines, the town became one of the first episcopal seats of Sicily. In the 9th century Milazzo was conquered by the Arabs, who built the first nucleus of the castle there.\nFrederick II of Hohenstaufen further fortified the town and created a personal hunting park. The castle was later mostly rebuilt in the age of Charles V of Spain.\nMilazzo was also the seat of a battle in 1718 between Spain and Austria, and of another fought by Giuseppe Garibaldi against the Kingdom of Two Sicilies during his Expedition of the Thousand (1860), an event of the unification of Italy. The expedition was successful and concluded with a plebiscite that brought Naples and Sicily into the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia, the last territorial conquest before the proclamation of the Kingdom of Italy on 17 March 1861.\nGeography.\nMilazzo borders with the municipalities of Barcellona Pozzo di Gotto, Mer\u00ec and San Filippo del Mela.\nMilazzo is the point of reference of a vast territory, from Villafranca Tirrena to Patti (over 200,000 inhabitants). It is also an important centre of the Strait of Messina Metropolitan Area (which also includes areas of Reggio Calabria), with the nearby town Barcellona Pozzo di Gotto. Located at the base of a peninsula that juts into the Tyrrhenian Sea with a small promontory, the town is from the city of Messina.\nThe origins of the promontory can be traced back to 1.5 million years ago, when between the Tertiary and Quaternary tectonic movements led to a rise of sedimentary and crystalline rocks between 20 and 70 meters above sea level. Sand and marine sediments were deposited on them, during an interglacial period (430,000 years ago) which represents the Tyrrhenian plain. An island was then formed not far from the mainland. Subsequently, large quantities of debris and alluvial deposits from the Peloritani mountains joined it to Sicily.\nThe city stands at the beginning of a peninsula about 8 km long (\"Capo Milazzo\") in the Tyrrhenian Sea, in a northerly direction. To the west of the Milazzo territory is the Riviera di Ponente, overlooking the Gulf of Patti (\"Mar di Ponente\"); to the east, the Gulf of Milazzo (\"Mar di Levante\"). The territory of the municipality, on the southern side, is characterized by a large alluvial plain (\"Piana di Milazzo\"). The municipal border on the mainland is demarcated to the east by the Floripotema river, which divides the municipality of Milazzo from that of San Filippo del Mela, and to the west by the Mela river (or Mer\u00ec), which separates the municipality of Milazzo from Barcellona Pozzo di Gotto and Mer\u00ec.\nClimate.\nMilazzo has a Mediterranean climate with evident subtropical characteristics, characterized by very limited temperature variations throughout the year. According to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, the city is part of the .\nThe annual rainfall in the area is approximately 850\u2013900 mm. The months with the highest precipitation are January, February, November and December. In recent decades, there has been a gradual climate change, manifested by the increase in stormy phenomena, sometimes extreme, which have therefore highlighted a slow tropicalization of the area.\nIn the area in question, the predominant and constant winds, both weak and medium and strong, are the Ponente (coming from the West) and, with less frequency, the Sirocco (coming from the South-East). This situation occurs in all months of the year except for the summer months, during which the frequency of strong winds decreases. Strong and very strong winds (7th-12th on the Beaufort scale) are concentrated in the autumn and winter periods even if they occur with lower frequencies than the weaker ones. As for the West, the Milazzo peninsula offers, on the port side, a good shelter, while for the Sirocco the bay (Mar di Levante) is uncovered. The opposite occurs for the opposite coast.\nNatural areas.\nThe area of Capo Milazzo is a marine protected area whose most famous attraction is the \"Piscina di Venere\", a natural body of water on the extreme tip of the cape. Capo Milazzo is the cape with which the Gulf of Milazzo ends to the west and the Gulf of Patti begins.\nAt the end of the cape, a marine reserve of the promontory was established in 2019, called the Capo Milazzo marine protected area. Inside the promontory stands an imposing fortified citadel built starting from the Norman age and expanded several times over the centuries.\nLocated in the final part of the promontory, is the Sanctuary of Sant'Antonio da Padova, a real rock refuge, where the saint found shelter after being shipwrecked on that coast in January 1221 and then transformed into a place of worship. Nearby stands a military lighthouse, built in the 16th century and activated by the Civil Engineering Department in 1853 and made operational again since 2013.\nSociety.\nForeign ethnicities and minorities.\nAs of December 31, 2023, foreigners residents in the municipality were , i.e. % of the population. The largest groups are shown below:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMuseums.\nSea Museum.\nThe MuMa - Milazzo Sea Museum is located in a deconsecrated church from 1527 inside the Bastion of Santa Maria located in the castle of Milazzo. In fact, the church of Santa Maria stood here in 1527, the first cathedral of Milazzo, later transformed into a military bastion and in 1825 into a penal colony, or a prison where prisoners were forced to do forced labor.\nThe MuMa was founded in 2019 by the biologist Carmelo Isgr\u00f2 who stripped the flesh of a 10-ton sperm whale that had beached along the coast of the Promontory of Capo Milazzo and that had died because of an illegal net \"la spadara\" that had gotten caught in its tail and because of the plastic it had ingested.\nThe biologist then reconstructed the skeleton by repositioning the plastic found and the illegal net respectively in the belly and tail of the skeleton of the Sperm Whale exposed as a warning for the new generations. Inside it, numerous scientific and artistic activities are held aimed at raising awareness of the protection of the marine environment: conferences, photographic exhibitions, musical concerts.\nArchaeological Antiquarium \"Domenico Ryolo\".\nThe building that houses the museum (a white construction with an elegant horizontally developed fa\u00e7ade) is a former Bourbon women's prison built in 1816 with the typical features of military buildings of the time. The collection displays finds discovered during research in the areas of the necropolis. Among the various objects, important evidence of ceramic production both imported from Corinth and produced in the Strait area in imitation of Chalcidian ceramics, all probably from the workshops of Zancle (Messina) and Mylai itself. We can also see clay boats and rowers from the second half of the 3rd century BC, rare pieces symbolizing, it seems, the journey of souls and, in addition, funerary objects dating back to a period between the end of the 5th and the 3rd century BC.\nTuna Fishing Museum.\nThe Tuna Fishing Museum hosts two sections:\nThe warehouses retain intact the charm of the notable stratifications of the walls that occurred over the different eras; their transformation, which occurred mostly in height, is today easily readable in several points of the sea front. They occupy approximately 1,000 square meters and have entrances both on the street front and on the sea side, through which, once, the boats used for tuna fishing were brought in and stored.\nTraditions.\nThe Patron Saint of Milazzo, Saint Stephen is solemnly celebrated on the first Sunday of September. The Co-Patron, Francis of Paola, is solemnly celebrated on the first Sunday of May, while two days later (usually on a Tuesday) the feast of the Berrettella is celebrated, that is, the headdress that the saint often used to wear during his stay in Milazzo, which lasted from 1464 to 1467. On a lesser scale, the feast of the Protector, Saint Papino martyr, is celebrated on 17 and 28 June with a Solemn Celebration in the church of the same name. There are many other religious feasts, such as Saint Joseph, John the Baptist, Anthony of Padua, Marina the Monk, Maria Goretti and Mark the Evangelist.\nEconomy.\nAgriculture and fishing.\nDuring its history, Milazzo, compared to the province to which it belongs, has always had good economic resources. At the beginning, a robust agriculture, floriculture and fishing were the foundations of an intense trade. These sectors are still alive today.\nIndustry.\nIn the 1960s and 70s of the 20th century, the exploitation of environmental resources, the establishment of factories and the development of communications gave a boost to the spread of industrial activities (in the Industrial-ASI area of Giammoro, belonging to the neighbouring municipality of Pace del Mela), of large industries such as the Milazzo Refinery controlled by Q8 and Agip Petroli, the Edipower Power Plant of the shareholder group A2A and Iren, the Edison Thermal Power Plant (now owned by the Milazzo Refinery), the Duferdofin Nucor Steelworks belonging to the Tirreno Steelworks, and many other medium and small industries of different kinds.\nCommerce and services.\nMilazzo has also been a protagonist in the tertiarization process: banks and insurance, advertising, publishing and media at a local level. The city has a good level of commercial activities, and has recently optimized the sector with the presence and expansion of shopping centers and large distribution areas of national and international brands.\nTourism.\nThere are also port activities, which are divided into commercial (ferrous materials, hydrocarbons) and tourism (ships and hydrofoils to and from the Aeolian Islands, Naples and Ustica). Tourism is very important, with the presence of many tourist-receptive activities (hotels, B&amp;Bs, restaurants); the sector is constantly growing, especially with the frequent arrival of cruise ships (projects are underway for the implementation of this initiative).\nTransportation.\nThe port of Milazzo is a departure point for ferries to the Aeolian Islands and Naples. The port of Milazzo was built in 1843, on the initiative of a minister of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, before the Italian unification.\nMilazzo is connected to the Autostrada A20, with its own Milazzo-Aeolian Islands junction. On the border with San Filippo del Mela, there is the state highway 113 Settentrionale Sicula. The city is served by a road axis that connects the city centre with the various hamlets of the municipal territory.\nThe Milazzo railway station was initially located a short distance from the city center, in Piazza Marconi. At the end of 1991, it was decommissioned and replaced by a new one, located in the hamlet of Parco Nuovo and approximately 3 km from the city center, due to the modification of the Palermo-Messina railway line between Patti and San Filippo del Mela-Santa Lucia del Mela.\nIt is connected to the port and the city center by two SAIS Autolinee bus lines: line n.5 Port - Station and line n.4 Port - Station - Hospital.\nSport.\nSociet\u00e0 Sportiva Milazzo, commonly known as SS Milazzo or Milazzo, is a football club based in Milazzo, who compete in Eccellenza Sicily, the fifth tier of the Italian football league system. The club was founded on 16 December 1830 by Giovanni Impallomeni, via a press release on \"Gazzetta di Messina e delle Calabrie\". The team's colours are red and blue.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The town is easily reachable through its well developed infrastructures: there are three highway exits along the A19, its station is the meeting point between all of the Sicilian railway lines and its seaport links the town with other important maritime Italian cities. It has a judicial district. It is culturally interesting for the close Greek ruins of Himera, its numerous churches, Roman ruins, prehistorical finds and the annual celebration of the Carnival, one of the oldest in Italy. In the heart of the old town, at its lower level, there are the thermal baths of the Grand Hotel delle Terme, where precious hot waters have flowed since Roman age. In the areas of Termini and the near Sciara and Caccamo is the Oriented Nature Reserve of Mount St. Calogero, located between the coast of Termini Imerese Gulf and the surrounding fertile flat territory. In the east zone of the town, there is a large industrial area, especially known for the former factory which was owned by FIAT and for the ENEL power plant \"Ettore Majorana\".\nHistory.\nAncient history.\nThe site of the town has been populated since prehistoric times, as many archaeological excavations have shown through the years. Its documented history begins in 409 BC after the second Battle of Himera when its more ancient neighbour, Himera (now completely within the \"comune\"'s borders), was completely destroyed by the Carthaginian army under Hannibal Mago. Those who survived the devastation moved to a site then called \"Thermae\" which is today known as Termini and became the successor to Himera. The new town of Thermae or Therma, called for the sake of distinction Thermae Himerenses, obviously derived its name from the hot springs for which it was celebrated, and the discovery of which was connected by legends with the wanderings of Hercules. It appears to have quickly become a considerable town, though it continued to be subject to Carthaginian rule.\nIn the First Punic War its name is repeatedly mentioned. In 260 BC, a body of Roman troops was encamped in the neighbourhood when they were attacked by Hamilcar and defeated with heavy loss.\nRoman age.\nBefore the close of the First Punic War (241 BC), Thermae was besieged and taken by the Romans but the city seems to have been treated with unusual favour by its conquerors. Cicero tells us that the Romans allowed the Thermitani to govern their city and territory with their own laws as a reward for their steady fidelity. As they were on hostile terms with Rome during the First Punic War, it can only be to the subsequent period that this \"fidelity\" applies.\nIn the time of Cicero (80-40 BC), Thermae appears to have been a flourishing place, carrying on a considerable amount of trade, though he speaks of it as \"oppidum non maximum\". He attested the magnificence of the ancient city and the taste of its citizens for the encouragement of art, calling it \"in primis Siciliae clarum et ornatum\" as statues were preserved by the Thermitani to whom they had been restored by Scipio after the conquest of Carthage.\nIt seems to have become a colony in the time of Augustus (27 BC \u2013 14 AD), whence we find mention in inscriptions of the \"Ordo et Populus splendidissimae Coloniae Augustae Himeraeorum Thermitanorum\". Thermae \"colonia\" is mentioned by Pliny and must refer to this town, though he seems to confuse it with Thermae Selinuntiae (modern Sciacca) on the south coast which was not a \"colony\".\nThere are few subsequent accounts of Thermae; but, as its name is found in Ptolemy and the Itineraries, and from the impressive aqueduct and some other remains it appears to have continued in existence throughout the period of the Roman Empire, and probably never ceased to be inhabited, as the modern town of Termini Imerese retains the ancient site as well as name.\nMedieval and industrial era.\nFollowing the fall of the Roman Empire, the city entered a period of decline. Termini continued to exist as a bishopric until the 12th century, though the list of bishops contains various gaps and uncertainties. Under Norman rule, the city was at first a royal city; it subsequently became one of 42 \"citt\u00e0 demaniali\", cities administered directly by the crown rather than local nobility. Above all, from the Middle Ages through the beginning of the 19th century, Termini served as a major centre for the collection and shipping of grain and other foodstuffs stored and subjected to duty in a special government warehouse complex (the \"caricatore regio\"). The presence of the \"caricatore\" improved the fortunes of the city, turning it into one of the major ports of Sicily and strengthening its commercial relationships with the maritime republics of Genoa, Pisa and Venice as well as the major Mediterranean ports (Marseille, Barcelona, etc.) and, during the 16th century, those of the Atlantic. \nTowards the end of the 18th century, Termini became the site of the Ereina Imerese branch of the Ereina di Palermo academy, followed soon thereafter by the establishment of the Accademia Euracea, later the Accademia Mediterranea Euracea. \nIn the 19th century, however, the closing of the \"caricatore\" precipitated a profound economic crisis that lasted until the end of the 20th century, when artisanal and proto-industrial activity began to replace the traditional agricultural base of the city's economy. A period of population decline, linked primarily to emigration to the Americas, was balanced at the beginning of the 20th century by immigration from Agrigento, Messina and Ragusa.\nModern era.\nBetween 1970 and 2011, Termini was home to a large Fiat automobile manufacturing facility, where small cars such as the 126, the original Panda, and the Punto have been manufactured. The plant was the sole assembly site for the second generation Lancia Ypsilon built between 2005 and 2011. In 2006 the plant celebrated its four millionth car produced. At the end of 2011, Fiat sold the plant to Chinese car manufacturer Chery. From January 2015, it was owned by Blutec, until its owner was arrested by the Guardia di Finanza in 2020. The plant was subsequently put up for sale again in 2023.\nThere is also a power station operated by Enel with a generation capacity of 454 MW.\nMain sights.\nAqueduct.\nThe Roman aqueduct bridge is the largest and best preserved of the island.\nThe source was located 5\u00a0km east of the city, at the foot of Monte San Calogero where the remains of the two settling tanks can still be seen in the locality of Brucato.\nThe aqueduct needed to cross the Barratina stream and the earliest the crossing was made at Fontana Superiore with a siphon about 600 m long, of which the well preserved hexagonal compression tower remains, 16 m high and resting on a square plinth of 6 m sides. On five of the sides were windows and from the east side the conduit started. On this tower was once a large inscription, now disappeared: \"aquae Cornealiae ductus p. XX\". The last letters (\"twenty feet\") perhaps corresponds to the sides of the building.\nLater it seems that the aqueduct passed further downstream: in Figurella a double-order bridge of arches is still visible (originally nine in the lower, fifteen in the upper: two arches for each order collapsed), 14 m high. The structure with facing blocks is the same as that of the amphitheatre and the curia and shows that it belongs to the same building project of the Augustan colony.\nSports.\nFounded in 1996, Libertas Termini was a professional women's basketball team, until it was dissolved in 2003. It was then succeeded by Basket Himera that same year but was also eventually liquidated by 2010.\nA.C.D Termitana 1952 is the local football playing in the local Sicilian leagues, dating back to 1931 although it has undergone multiple mergers, name changes and re-foundations since.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The judicial category of \"pentiti\" was originally created in 1970s to combat violence and terrorism during the period of left-wing and right-wing terrorism known as the Years of Lead. During the 1986\u201387 Maxi Trial and after the testimony of Tommaso Buscetta, the term was increasingly applied to former members of organized crime in Italy who had abandoned their organization and started helping investigators.\nRole and benefits.\nIn exchange for the information they deliver, \"pentiti\" receive shorter sentences for their crimes, in some cases even freedom. In the Italian judicial system, \"pentiti\" can obtain personal protection, a new name, and some money to start a new life in another place, possibly abroad.\nThis practice is common in other countries as well. In the United States, criminals testifying against their former associates can enter the Witness Protection Program, and be given new identities with supporting paperwork. The Italian Mafia bosses Buscetta and Francesco Marino Mannoia were allowed to live in the U.S. under new identities in the Witness Protection Program when Italy did not yet have such a program.\nCases.\nAmong the most famous Mafia \"pentiti\" is Tommaso Buscetta, the first important \"pentito\". He was helpful to judge Giovanni Falcone in describing the Sicilian Mafia Commission or \"Cupola\", the leadership of the Sicilian Mafia in the 1980s, and identifying the main operational channels that the Mafia used for its business.\nIn Italy, important successes were achieved with the cooperation of \"pentiti\" in the fight against terrorism (especially against the Red Brigades), by Carabinieri general Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa (who was later killed by the Mafia).\nIn the period until the 1990s, there were few, albeit significant, \"pentiti\" such as Tommaso Buscetta, Salvatore Contorno, Antonino Calderone, etc. However, this changed during the early 1990s. From 1992, over a thousand \"mafiosi\" have agreed to collaborate with Italian justice.\nIn some cases, \"pentiti\" have invented stories to obtain reductions in jail time. A famous case regarded the popular TV anchorman Enzo Tortora, who was falsely accused of cocaine trafficking and Camorra membership by a \"pentito\" named Giovanni Melluso. Tortora was detained for years before being cleared; he developed cancer and died soon after the case was finally solved, some say because of the emotional stress of his imprisonment.\nCultural acceptance.\nIn some southern Italian communities, the Mafia has a significant presence, and in these areas becoming a \"pentito\" is tantamount to a death sentence. Indeed, the Mafia family of Tot\u00f2 Riina based in the town of Corleone habitually extended the death sentence of the \"pentiti\" over to their relatives. For example, several of Tommaso Buscetta's close family members were killed in a long series of murders.\nCommentary on the term.\nIt is often pointed out that the correct term should be \"collaboratori di giustizia\", or \"collaborators with justice\". The word \"pentito\" implies a moral judgment that is considered inappropriate for the courts of justice to make.\nCriticism.\nIn Italy, \"pentiti\" have come under criticism because of the favours they receive and because they would invent stories to receive benefits; they would invent stories to persecute people they do not like; their employment is seen as a reward for criminals, instead of a punishment; and they would be unreliable since they come from a criminal organization. Criticism comes most often from politicians, especially when they or an associate of theirs is under investigation for connections to the Mafia. It is therefore interpreted by some as an attempt to discredit one's own accusers, instead of a genuine preoccupation of the common citizen's civil rights. Luciano Violante, a politician and former president of the Italian Antimafia Commission, countered that \"We do not find information about the Mafia among nuns.\"\nLaws have been passed that bar \"pentiti\" from obtaining substantial benefits unless their revelations are later deemed new material, and lead to concrete results. The State can collect revelations only for six months after the initial intention to collaborate, after which they cannot be used in court. This has reduced the appeal of becoming a \"pentito\" since a single mafia associate does not know whether his knowledge will be useful to the prosecutors at the time of defection. Defection from the mafia in Italy have subsequently sharply reduced from the height reached in the early nineties, and results in the fight against mafia have reduced accordingly.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

From 1975 to 1998, it was part of Nowy S\u0105cz Voivodeship; since 1999, it has been part of Lesser Poland Voivodeship. As of 2017[ [update]] its population was 27,266. Zakopane is a centre of Goral culture and is often referred to as \"the winter capital of Poland\". It is a popular tourist destination for many types of mountain activities such as skiing, trekking, mountaineering and various forms of climbing.\nZakopane lies near Poland's border with Slovakia, in a valley between the Tatra Mountains and Guba\u0142\u00f3wka Hill. It is connected by rail and road to the provincial capital, Krak\u00f3w. Zakopane lies above sea level and centres on the intersection of its Krup\u00f3wki and Ko\u015bciuszko Streets.\nHistory.\nThe earliest documents mentioning Zakopane date to the 17th century, describing a glade called \"Zakopisko\". In 1676, it was a village of 43 inhabitants. In 1818, Zakopane was a small town that was still being developed. There were only 340 homes that held 445 families. The population of Zakopane at that time was 1,805: 934 women and 871 men. The first church was built in 1847, by J\u00f3zef Stolarczyk.\nZakopane became a center for the region's mining and metallurgy industries; by the 19th century, it was the largest center for metallurgy in the region of Galicia. It expanded during the 19th century as the climate attracted more inhabitants. By 1889, it had developed from a small village into a climatic health resort. Rail services to Zakopane began on 1 October 1899. In the late 1800s, Zakopane constructed a road that went to the town of Nowy Targ and had railways that came from Chab\u00f3wka. Because of easier transportation, the population of Zakopane had increased to about 3,000 people by the end of the 1800s. In the 19th century, Krup\u00f3wki Street was just a narrow beaten path that was meant for people to get from the central part of town to the village of Ku\u017anice.\nThe ski jump on Wielka Krokiew was opened in 1925.\nThe cable car to Kasprowy Wierch was completed in 1936.\nThe funicular connected Zakopane and the top of Guba\u0142\u00f3wka in 1938.\nBecause of Zakopane's popular ski mountains, the town gained popularity which made the number of tourists increase to about 60,000 people by 1930.\nDuring the joint German-Soviet invasion of Poland, which started World War II in September 1939, the town was invaded by Germany, and the \"Einsatzgruppe I\" entered the town on 4 September 1939 to commit various crimes against Poles. In March 1940, representatives of the Soviet NKVD and the Nazi Gestapo met for one week in Zakopane's Villa Tadeusz, to coordinate the pacification of resistance in Poland. Throughout World War II, Zakopane served as an underground staging point between Poland and Hungary.\nFrom 1942 to 1943, 1,000 prisoners from the German Krak\u00f3w-P\u0142asz\u00f3w concentration camp were set to work in a stone quarry. In 1944, during the Warsaw Uprising, the Germans deported thousands of Varsovians from the Dulag 121 camp in Pruszk\u00f3w, where they were initially imprisoned, to Zakopane. Those Poles were mainly old people, ill people and women with children. In mid-October 1944, there were 3,800 registered Poles, who were expelled from Warsaw, and probably another 3,800 unregistered expellees. In January 1945, the Germans retreated from Zakopane and the German occupation ended.\nImmediately after the war, a children's Home for Holocaust Survivors was established in Zakopane.\nClimate.\nZakopane has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: \"Dfb\"), with the main factor behind its relative coldness compared to the rest of Poland is its altitude. In general, the temperature tends to fall with altitude, therefore Zakopane is almost colder than northern Krak\u00f3w, which is more than lower than Zakopane. With higher altitudes, the climate gets even colder, therefore, on the top of Kasprowy Wierch ( above sea level), the climate is tundra-like (K\u00f6ppen: \"ET\"). The tree line is located at about above sea level in the Tatra Mountains.\nWinters are typically frosty but are relatively sunny for Poland - in fact, Zakopane receives among the most sun in winter in the country. Snow is normally abundant, particularly in the higher altitudes, which makes Zakopane among the most popular ski resorts in Poland. Summers are cool to warm but rarely get hot.\nThe defining feature of the local climate is the location on the northern slope of the Tatra mountains. Zakopane receives significantly more precipitation than cities on the lowlands to the north of the Carpathians, and just like in the mountains in general, there might be sudden weather changes from sunny to rainy, and vice versa. Occasionally, a very warm foehn wind locally known as halny may dramatically increase the temperatures, sometimes beyond in winter.\nExtreme temperatures range from on 1 February 1956 up to on 8 August 2013; the record cold daily maximum is , set on 1 February 1956, while, conversely, the record warm daily minimum is on 29 August 1992.\nArchitecture.\nThe Zakopane Style of Architecture is an architectural mode inspired by the regional art of Poland's highland region known as Podhale. Drawing on the motifs and traditions in the buildings of the Carpathian Mountains, the style was pioneered by Stanis\u0142aw Witkiewicz and is now considered a core tradition of the Goral people.\nThe most prominent examples of the style are:\nOther important sights in Zakopane include:\nCulture.\nSince the end of the 19th century Zakopane was an important place for many artists, who frequently visited, worked or lived here, especially during the Young Poland period.\nToday the city hosts many museums and galleries:\nSports.\nThe Tatras are a popular destination among hikers, skiers, ski-tourers and climbers.\nMountaineering.\nThere is a network of well-marked hiking trails in the Tatras and according to the national park regulations the hikers must stick to them. Most of these trails are overcrowded, especially in the summer season.\nThe High Tatras offer excellent opportunities for climbing (up to X UIAA grade).\nIn summer, lightning and snow are both potential hazards for climbers, and the weather can change quickly. Thunderstorms are common in the afternoons. In winter the snow can be up to several meters deep.\nSkiing.\nIn the winter, thousands arrive in Zakopane to ski, especially around Christmas and in February. The most popular skiing areas are Kasprowy Wierch and Guba\u0142\u00f3wka. There are a number of cross country skiing trails in the forests surrounding the town.\nZakopane hosted the Nordic World Ski Championships in 1929, 1939, and 1962; the winter Universiades in 1956, 1993, and 2001; the biathlon World Championship; several ski jumping world cups; and several Nordic combined, Nordic and Alpine European Cups. It hosted the second Alpine World Ski Championships in 1939, the first outside the Alps and the last official world championships prior to World War II.\nZakopane made unsuccessful bids to host the 2006 Winter Olympics and the 2011 and 2013 Alpine World Ski Championships.\nIn February 1933 the Winter Maccabiah Games were held in Zakopane.\nFootball.\nIn Zakopane, there are two football clubs \u2013 one of them is KS Zakopane, which was established in 2007 as a result of the merger of ZKP Zakopane and Jutrzenka Zakopane. It currently competes in the B-class league, in the Podhale II group. Its matches are played at the facility located at Orkana Street 6.\nIn the 2015/2016 season, the Football Club Zakopane was reactivated. After a successful 2015/16 season, in which the ZKP players managed to secure a promotion-eligible spot in the Podhale C-class, they are now playing in the Podhale B-class league.\nTourism.\nZakopane is visited by over 2,500,000 tourists a year. In the winter, Zakopane's tourists are interested in winter sports activities such as skiing, snowboarding, ski jumping, snowmobiling, sleigh rides, snowshoe walks, and Ice skating. During the summer, Tourists come to do activities like hiking, climbing, bike and horse ride the Tatras mountain, there are many trails in the Tatras. Tourists ride quads and dirt bikes that you can rent. Swimming and boat rides on the Dunajec river are popular. Many come to experience Goral culture, which is rich in its unique styles of food, speech, architecture, music, and costume. Zakopane is especially popular during the winter holidays, which are celebrated in traditional style, with dances, decorated horse-pulled sleighs called kuligs and roast lamb.\nA popular tourist activity is taking a stroll along the town's most popular street: Krup\u00f3wki. It is lined with stores, restaurants, carnival rides, and performers.\nDuring the winter and summer seasons, Krup\u00f3wki Street is crowded with tourists visiting the shops and restaurants. In the summer, a local market along Krup\u00f3wki Street offers traditional Goral apparel, leather jackets, fur coats, shoes, and purses. Venders also sell foods like the famous \"oscypek\" smoked sheep cheese, fruit, vegetables, and meats. There are also many stands with Zakopane souvenirs.\nZakopane is popular for its nightlife. At night there are always people walking around town checking out the different bars and dance clubs. Most of these bars and dance clubs are located on Krupowki street.http://\nOther activities include also Zakopane's Thermal Baths - a modern aquapark with outside swimming pools with thermal water.\nA scene in Andrzej Wajda's film \"Man of Marble\" (\"Cz\u0142owiek z marmuru\") was filmed in Zakopane, introducing the town to a worldwide audience.\nThe mountain scenes from the Bollywood film \"Fanaa\" were filmed around Zakopane.\nInternational relations.\nZakopane participates in town twinning to foster international links.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "44806", "revid": "47160124", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44806", "title": "Syntactic category", "text": "Word classes, largely corresponding to traditional parts of speech\nA syntactic category is a syntactic unit that theories of syntax assume. Word classes, largely corresponding to traditional parts of speech (e.g. noun, verb, preposition, etc.), are syntactic categories. In phrase structure grammars, the \"phrasal categories\" (e.g. noun phrase, verb phrase, prepositional phrase, etc.) are also syntactic categories. Dependency grammars, however, do not acknowledge phrasal categories (at least not in the traditional sense).\nWord classes considered as syntactic categories may be called \"lexical categories\", as distinct from phrasal categories. The terminology is somewhat inconsistent between the theoretical models of different linguists. However, many grammars also draw a distinction between \"lexical categories\" (which tend to consist of content words, or phrases headed by them) and \"functional categories\" (which tend to consist of function words or abstract functional elements, or phrases headed by them). The term \"lexical category\" therefore has two distinct meanings. Moreover, syntactic categories should not be confused with grammatical categories (also known as grammatical features), which are properties such as tense, gender, etc.\nDefining criteria.\nAt least three criteria are used in defining syntactic categories:\n#The type of meaning it expresses\n#The type of affixes it takes\n#The structure in which it occurs\nFor instance, many nouns in English denote concrete entities, they are pluralized with the suffix \"-s\", and they occur as subjects and objects in clauses. Many verbs denote actions or states, they are conjugated with agreement suffixes (e.g. \"-s\" of the third person singular in English), and in English they tend to show up in medial positions of the clauses in which they appear.\nThe third criterion is also known as \"distribution\". The distribution of a given syntactic unit determines the syntactic category to which it belongs. The distributional behavior of syntactic units is identified by substitution. Like syntactic units can be substituted for each other.\nAdditionally, there are also informal criteria one can use in order to determine syntactic categories. For example, one informal means of determining if an item is lexical, as opposed to functional, is to see if it is left behind in \"telegraphic speech\" (that is, the way a telegram would be written; e.g., \"Pants fire. Bring water, need help.\")\nLexical categories vs. phrasal categories.\nThe traditional parts of speech are lexical categories, in one meaning of that term. Traditional grammars tend to acknowledge approximately eight to twelve lexical categories, e.g.\nLexical categories\nadjective (A), adposition (preposition, postposition, circumposition) (P), adverb (Adv), coordinate conjunction (C), determiner (D), interjection (I), noun (N), particle (Par), pronoun (Pr), subordinate conjunction (Sub), verb (V), etc.\nThe lexical categories that a given grammar assumes will likely vary from this list. Certainly numerous subcategories can be acknowledged. For instance, one can view pronouns as a subtype of noun, and verbs can be divided into finite verbs and non-finite verbs (e.g. gerund, infinitive, participle, etc.). The central lexical categories give rise to corresponding phrasal categories:\nPhrasal categories\nAdjective phrase (AP), adverb phrase (AdvP), adposition phrase (PP), noun phrase (NP), verb phrase (VP), etc.\nIn terms of phrase structure rules, phrasal categories can occur to the left of the arrow while lexical categories cannot, e.g. NP \u2192 D N. Traditionally, a phrasal category should consist of two or more words, although conventions vary in this area. X-bar theory, for instance, often sees individual words corresponding to phrasal categories. Phrasal categories are illustrated with the following trees:\nThe lexical and phrasal categories are identified according to the node labels, phrasal categories receiving the \"P\" designation.\nLexical categories only.\nDependency grammars do not acknowledge phrasal categories in the way that phrase structure grammars do. What this means is that the interaction between lexical and phrasal categories disappears, the result being that only the lexical categories are acknowledged. The tree representations are simpler because the number of nodes and categories is reduced, e.g.\nThe distinction between lexical and phrasal categories is absent here. The number of nodes is reduced by removing all nodes marked with \"P\". Note, however, that phrases can still be acknowledged insofar as any subtree that contains two or more words qualifies as a phrase.\nLexical categories vs. functional categories.\nMany grammars draw a distinction between \"lexical categories\" and \"functional categories\". This distinction is orthogonal to the distinction between lexical categories and phrasal categories. In this context, the term \"lexical category\" applies only to those parts of speech and their phrasal counterparts that form open classes and have full semantic content. The parts of speech that form closed classes and have mainly just functional content are called \"functional categories\":\nLexical categories\nAdjective (A) and adjective phrase (AP), adverb (Adv) and adverb phrase (AdvP), noun (N) and noun phrase (NP), verb and verb phrase (VP), preposition and prepositional phrase (PP)\nFunctional categories\nCoordinate conjunction (C), determiner (D), negation (Neg), particle (Par), preposition (P) and prepositional phrase (PP), subordinate conjunction (Sub), etc.\nThere is disagreement in certain areas, for instance concerning the status of prepositions. The distinction between lexical and functional categories plays a big role in Chomskyan grammars (Transformational Grammar, Government and Binding Theory, Minimalist Program), where the role of the functional categories is large. Many phrasal categories are assumed that do not correspond directly to a specific part of speech, e.g. inflection phrase (IP), tense phrase (TP), agreement phrase (AgrP), focus phrase (FP), etc. (see also Phrase \u2192 Functional categories). In order to acknowledge such functional categories, one has to assume that the constellation is a primitive of the theory and that it exists separately from the words that appear. As a consequence, many grammar frameworks do not acknowledge such functional categories, e.g. Head Driven Phrase Structure Grammar, Dependency Grammar, etc.\n\"Note: The abbreviations for these categories vary across systems; see .\"\nLabels in the Minimalist Program.\nEarly research suggested shifting away from the use of labelling, as they were considered to be non-optimal for the analysis of syntactic structure, and should therefore be eliminated. Collins (2002) argued that, although labels such as Noun, Pronoun, Adjective and the like were unavoidable and undoubtedly useful for categorizing syntactic items, providing labels for the projections of those items, was not useful and was, in fact, detrimental to structural analysis, since there were disagreements and discussions about how exactly to label these projections. The labeling of projections such as Noun Phrases (NP), Verb Phrases (VP), and others have since been a topic of discussion amongst syntacticians, who have since then been working on labelling algorithms to solve the very problem brought up by Collins. \nIn line with both Phrase Structure Rules and X-bar theory, syntactic labelling plays an important role within Chomsky's Minimalist Program (MP).

{"id": "44807", "revid": "50339887", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44807", "title": "Corleone", "text": "Corleone (; or ) is a town and \"comune\" of roughly 11,158 inhabitants in the Metropolitan City of Palermo, in Sicily, Southern Italy.\nThe town is located in the central part of the Sicilian region, in a mountainous inland area at 542 meters (1,778 ft) above the sea level, protected by a crown of carbonate rock promontories; Rocca di Maschi, Castello Soprano and Castello Sottano. The municipality has an area of 22,912 hectares (56,620 acres) with a population density of 49 inhabitants per square kilometer. \nThe area on which Corleone stands has an ancient history, with the first human settlements dating back to the first phase of the Neolithic, in the 6th millennium BC. \nThe town's altitude and its location in a valley surrounded by hills halfway between Palermo and Agrigento gave Corleone a defensive and strategic advantage over the centuries. In fact, its position allowed to control important communication routes between the coastal areas and the Sicilian hinterland, and the natural protections fortified its defense. \nThere are several historical theories regarding the origins of the town's foundation. One of the most accredited sources dates it back to the 9th century AD, during the Muslim rule of Sicily. However, archaeological excavations conducted in the late 1990s show that the urban layout dates back to earlier times. According to some sources, the town was founded by Ancient Greek colonists and was a \"polis\" called Schera. Recent finds suggest the original layout dates back to prehistoric times.\nCorleone was a central place in the history of Cosa Nostra, the Sicilian Mafia, which established itself in Sicily as a rural phenomenon in the late 19th century. The Mafia arose from the growing power of the \"gabellotti\", individuals who had obtained concessions on lands belonging to the Sicilian aristocracy thanks to the abolition of feudal privileges in 1812, which caused the Sicilian nobles to abandon the countryside and return to the cities. The \"gabellotti\" paid to administer the lands, then divided them into lots and subleased them to peasants and laborers, who were treated like serfs, and their claims were violently repressed with the help of bandits. The institutional weakness following the Unification of Italy in 1861 allowed this new organization, formed by the union of landed exploiters and the rural criminals, and which would ultimately become the Mafia, to gain ever greater control over the rural areas. \nThe Corleone Mafia Family originated in the early 20th century and was most likely founded by Angelo Gagliano, a Corleone native with a criminal record and known for his violent nature, who later became the first boss of Corleone. Like other mafia clans, the Corleone Family was originally made up of \"gabellotti\" and cattle thieves. \nThe trade unionist and later mayor of Corleone, Bernandino Verro, firmly opposed the advance of the Mafia and fought hard to ensure respect for farmers' rights, agricultural cooperation, and the fair redistribution of landed estates. In 1915, he was killed by an unidentified hitman, on the orders of the mafia boss Angelo Gagliano, who had already attempted to assassinate him in 1910. Verro was the first mayor killed by the Sicilian Mafia. \nAfter World War II, trade unionist Placido Rizzotto led a peasant movement in Corleone for the occupation of uncultivated lands, in order to counter the power of the Mafia and its land-owning management of the territory. This made him a target for the town's clans, particularly for clan leader Michele Navarra, who saw the trade unionist as a threat to his power and control. Rizzotto was kidnapped and assassinated on March 10, 1948. A local shepherd boy, Giuseppe Letizia, was also killed. He had accidentally witnessed the murder, becoming an inconvenient eyewitness for the mafia. \nIn the 1960s, the Corleone Family became increasingly powerful under the leadership of Luciano Leggio, who stood out for his ruthless ways. The Corleonesi Mafia clan, another local mafia group, led Cosa Nostra in the 1980s and was the most violent faction ever to take control of the organization. \nCorleone is also the birthplace of several fictional characters in Mario Puzo's 1969 novel \"The Godfather\", including the eponymous Don Vito (Andolini) Corleone. \nHistory.\nEtymology.\nThe etymology of the name is uncertain, undergoing various modifications from the Ancient Greek \"Kouroulloun\u00e8\" to the Siculo-Arabic \"Qurlayun\" of the Emirate of Sicily, from Latin \"Curilionum\" to the Norman \"Coraigli\u00f2n\", from the Aragonese \"Conillon\", \"Coniglione\" from which the Sicilian \"Cunigghiuni\" originated. The modern name originates from 1556.\nAnother belief is that the name derives from an Arab fighter named Kurliyun (cf. \"Coeur Leon\", \"Lionheart\"), who conquered it for the Aghlabids in 840.\nAntiquity.\nThe territory of Corleone has been inhabited since prehistoric times. Recent research has identified several settlements distributed around two main areas: Pietralunga and The Old One (\"La Vecchia\"). This name refers to a mountain that rises to about , and is about from today's town. The site of Pietralunga was occupied from the final Neolithic Period to the Bronze Age (the presence of a glass bell decorated in pointill\u00e9) while the site of The Old One has been inhabited since the Middle Ages (the presence of an imposing castle with towers has recently been identified). However, the biggest part of the settlement was built in the archaic and classical period. \"A few materials relating to the Hellenistic period found at the site have supported the identification of the ancient town situated on the Old One with the ancient town of Schera, cited by Cicero, Cluverio and Ptolemy, although the archaeological remains on which this theory is based are still too unstable. (D'Angelo - Spatafora).\nMiddle Ages.\nIn 840, Corleone was conquered by the North African Aghlabids during the Muslim conquest of Sicily. It was during the Muslim occupation that it gained economic, military and strategic importance. In 1080 the city was conquered by the Normans, and in 1095 it was annexed to the Diocese of Palermo. Even in the 1170s it was recorded that over 80% of the population of the area was Muslim and that many bore Arabo-Islamic names derived from Greek.\nThere was also a mosque, called Masgid al-Barid, within the town. Following the large-scale anti-Muslim attacks by Lombard settlers in eastern Sicily in 1161 led by future King of Sicily, Tancred, the town became a refuge for many fleeing Muslims. \nIn 1208, a Muslim uprising succeeded in retaking the town from Christian rule. In 1222, while speaking with the pope, Frederick II of Sicily cited the need to fight the Muslims of Corleone as a reason for his inability to send a large crusader army to Jerusalem. To this day the rock formation \"Castello Soprano\", has a Saracen lookout tower on top of it. While the town's other rock formation, \"Castello Sottano\", did not preserve its own Saracen fortification, it is still also known as \"Castello di Saraceni\".\nNearly a century later, in 1180, it was enfeoffed (deeded) to the new diocese of Monreale. In this period, Corleone was largely repopulated by Ghibellines from Alessandria (modern Piedmont), Brescia and elsewhere\u2014\"Lombards\" led by Oddone de Camerana. The migrations were encouraged by Emperor Frederick II of Sicily, to strengthen his position against the Guelphs. In 1249, however, he revoked the privilege and gave the city to the royal property, though the migration of the inhabitants from the Po Valley continued until the beginning of the Sicilian Vespers in 1282. Another Camerana, named Boniface, distinguished himself in the revolution of the Sicilian Vespers. He led the insurrection against the Angevins with three thousand people from Corleone, in alliance with the city of Palermo. In recognition, the Senate of Palermo called Corleone \"soror mea\" (my sister).\nDuring the reign of Frederick IV of Sicily, called The Simple, the city successfully rebelled against the crown but was recaptured in 1355. Corleone was besieged from Ventimiglia in 1358. During the reign of the four vicars, Corleone became the property of the powerful Chiaramonte family, but in 1391 was donated by Mary Queen of Sicily to Berardo Queralt, canon of Lerida, but he never took possession. Instead, it was occupied by Nicholas Peralta, vicar William's son, but King Martin the Younger returned it to the royal property, confirming its privileges in 1397 and giving it some tax relief.\nMedieval history.\nIn March 1434, King Alfonso the Magnanimous went to Corleone and conceded some tolls to the city with the aim of restoring the walls and meeting other needs, promising also the inalienability of the city to which he gave the title of \"Animosa Civitas\" (brave city). However, in 1440 Corleone was sold to Federico Ventimiglia for 19,000 florins. This concession was revoked in May 1447 by King Alfonso, to be resold in the same year to a certain John of Bologna. In 1452 the city was finally granted to attorney James Pilaya. In 1516, Corleone joined the revolutionary movements of Palermo against the Viceroy Moncada. The revolt of Corleone, led by Fabio La Porta, received popular support as its purpose was the request for tax relief. However, the revolt was violently repressed by the viceroy's troops led by the Vicar General Gerardo Bonanno. Towards the end of the same century, social conditions in the city worsened further because of the plague of 1575\u201377 and the famine of 1592. On June 3, 1625, Corleone was sold, with other cities, to some Genoese merchants from whom Corleone redeemed itself upon payment of 15,200 florins. The terms of sale were, however, very serious. In 1648, the city was sold to the jurist Joseph Sgarlata, who then accepted the redemption upon payment.\nRemarkable demographic growth was reported in the 15th and 16th centuries, following the arrival of several religious orders.\nContemporary history.\nCorleone contributed to the events of the Unification of Italy through Francesco Bentivegna who, after participating in the riots of 1848, captained an insurrection against the Bourbons in the surrounding cities until he was arrested and then shot in Mezzojuso on December 20, 1856. On May 27, 1860, the city was the scene of a fierce battle between followers of Giuseppe Garibaldi, led by Colonel Vincenzo Giordano Orsini, and the bulk of the Bourbon army led by General Von Meckel, which had been diverted from Palermo via a ploy hatched by the same Garibaldi. On that occasion, a team of volunteers (\"Picciotti\", Sicilian for \"boys\"), led by Ferdinando Firmaturi, joined the march of Garibaldi in Palermo. \nThe nineteenth century ended with the social action by Bernardino Verro, a leader of the social movement \"Fasci Siciliani\". After founding the Fascio of Corleone on April 3, 1893, he founded the new Farm Lease that was entered into between farmers and agricultural Sicilian \"gabelloti\" in Congress on July 30, 1893, held in Corleone\u2014so much so that the city began to assume the title of \"peasant capital\". Corleone contributed to World War I with 105 deaths and numerous injuries on the field. After World War II, a peasant movement occupied vacant lands, led by trade unionist Placido Rizzotto, who was killed by the Mafia.\nIn 1943, the Duke of Aosta created the title of Count of Corleone, awarded to Arturo Faini for his valour during the Italian occupation of Ethiopia.\nSince World War II, Corleone has become notorious for being home to several dangerous bandits and mobsters (including: Michele Navarra, Luciano Leggio, Bernardo Provenzano, Salvatore Riina and his brothers-in-law Calogero and Leoluca Bagarella) who became the protagonists of a violent and bloody mafia power struggle. The mayor of Palermo, Vito Ciancimino, was also born in Corleone and linked to the Corleone clan.\nGeography.\nLocated in the southwestern area of its province, the municipality of Corleone has an area of 229.46 square kilometers (88.60 sq mi) and is located in a basin in a mountainous inland area, approximately above sea level, south of the prominent Rocca Busambra. It borders the municipalities of Bisacquino, Campofelice di Fitalia, Campofiorito, Contessa Entellina, Chiusa Sclafani, Godrano, Mezzojuso, Monreale, Palazzo Adriano, Prizzi and Roccamena. Its only hamlet () is the village of Ficuzza, an enclave in the municipal territory of Monreale.\nMain sights.\nMother Church.\nWork on the \"Chiesa Madre\" (\"Mother Church\"), dedicated to the 4th-century French bishop Saint Martin of Tours, started in the late 14th century. Its appearance today has been influenced by numerous changes and renovations. The interior has a nave and aisles divided into various chapels containing artwork, including a wooden statue representing San Filippo d'Agira from the 17th century, a 16th-century statue representing San Biagio (Saint Blaise) and a fine marble panel depicting the \"Baptism of Christ\" (also from this period).\nAddolorata Church.\nThe \"Chiesa dell'Addolorata\" is from the 18th century, dedicated to the Basilian abbot and patron saint San Leoluca\nOther Churches.\nThe \"Chiesa di Santa Rosalia\", and the small \"Sant'Andrea\" (the latter two from the 17th century), all with important frescoes and paintings, are notable landmarks. The \"Santuario della Madonna del Rosario di Tagliavia\", a religious building from the 19th century, is now a destination for pilgrims on Ascension Day.\nMafia and anti-Mafia Museum of Corleone.\nThe CIDMA museum (\"Centro Internazionale di Documentazione sulla Mafia e del Movimento Antimafia\") was inaugurated on 12 December 2000, in the presence of the highest authorities of the Republic, including the President of the Republic Carlo Azeglio Ciampi and the deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations Pino Arlacchi, on behalf of Secretary-General Kofi Annan. The CIDMA intends to pursue \"Culture, Progress and Legality\" as its objectives.\nCIDMA has several rooms for visitors: Room of the Folders of the Maxi Trial (), the Room of the Messages, the Room of Pain and the final room dedicated to Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa, an Italian general who campaigned against terrorism and was assassinated by the Mafia. The first room contains Maxi-Trial documents which marked a milestone in the fight against Cosa Nostra.\nThe documents, given to Corleone by the Criminal Chamber of the Court of Palermo, are a testimony to the work of magistrates like Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino who paid with their lives for their commitment to the fight against the Mafia. Among the folders there are the confessions of the famous \"pentito\" (\"repentant\") Tommaso Buscetta to Judge Falcone.\nIn the Room of the Messages, visitors may see the photos of the well-known, Sicilian photographer Letizia Battaglia who had the courage to go on site to capture tragic photographs of Mafia murders. She was able to capture significant details that made her shots documents detailing the murder methods used by the Mafia in the 1970s\u20131980s. The different positions of the bodies allow visitors to reconstruct the Mafia's strategy.\nThe Room of Pain houses a permanent exhibition of Shobha, Letizia Battaglia's daughter, who followed in her mother's footsteps, taking photos of the dismay, helplessness, and despair felt by those who have lost someone at the hands of the Mafia. In the room there are also photos of Letizia Battaglia documenting Mafia crimes. This approach allows visitors to understand the cause-effect relationships that exist between the crimes and the consequences they produce in the lives of affected families and the entire community.\nThe room Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa is dedicated to General Dalla Chiesa. It contains photos of some of the main bosses of the Mafia placed side by side with those in the legal system who fought organized crime.\nLocal guides also offer tours through the CIDMA.\nGorges of the Dragon.\nAlong the road that connects Corleone with Ficuzza, following the old railway line connecting Palermo to San Carlo (a hamlet of Chiusa Sclafani) (now the bike path), is an old bridge where the Frattina River streams between the limestone rocks. The erosive action of water has produced karst topography over time forming chasms, reels and small waterfalls where the abundant water first disappears and then reappears in the boulders and lush vegetation. Of considerable size are the \"pots of the Giants\", i.e. cylindrical and deep holes where the water takes on a swirling pattern. Old mulberry trees, oranges, pomegranates, and figs are living testimony of the site where a mill once stood. In the section where the slope is gentler, clear water pools have formed allowing visitors to bathe surrounded by bracken, maidenhair ferns, willows and elms, in the company of tortoise, fish, and colorful dragonflies. The walls that enclose the slopes are clad in rock plants of great botanical interest such as wood spurge, cabbage mountain, the carnation, and capers. Among the crevices of the rock shelter are pigeons, jackdaws, and birds of prey such as kestrels and the peregrine falcon. Tours take visitors up to the top of the gorge where the Frattina River continues to flow, in a more gentle manner, down to the Belice.\nDue Rocche Waterfall.\nWithin the territory of Corleone, a short walk from the historic center of the city, is the \"Natural Park of the cascade of the two fortresses.\" After going through a series of narrow streets in the district of San Giuliano visitors come to the front of a small church dedicated to Our Lady of the Two Fortresses. To the left of this church winds a path that leads between the poplars, willows, and elms to the falls. Seated on the ancient square blocks in the shade of mulberry, walnut and ash trees, visitors have an unimpeded view of the waterfall. The flow of the water in the river has formed a large pool among rocks through its erosive action. The canyon contains eroded, yellow-green glauconitic rocks occupied by vegetation.\nCorleone in literature and film.\nThe name of the town was used as the adopted surname of the title character in Mario Puzo's book and Francis Ford Coppola's film \"The Godfather\". In the novel, Vito Andolini emigrates from the village of Corleone and adopts his birthplace's name as his own surname. In the cinematic release of \"The Godfather Part II\", young Vito, shy and unable to speak English, cannot respond when asked for his proper name, and is given the surname Corleone by an immigration official at Ellis Island. Throughout the film series, various members of the Corleone family visit the town. In the films, the towns of Savoca and Forza d'Agr\u00f2 were used as locations for those scenes set in Corleone. Michael Corleone is played by Al Pacino, whose real-life maternal grandparents were Corleonese.\nThe adaptation of the town's name into the name of a criminal gang leader in \"The Godfather\" is, however, predated by Graham Greene's 1938 novel \"Brighton Rock\", which was made into a popular film in 1947. The leading character crosses the rival gang leader \"Colleoni\" in the English seaside town of Brighton.\nThe town is mentioned in Victor Hugo's novel \"The Man Who Laughs\", as the eponymous character briefly serves as Marquis of Corleone.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It shows traces of all cultures that have existed on the island of Sicily over the last two millennia. Although its cuisine has much in common with Italian cuisine, Sicilian food also has Greek, Spanish, Jewish, Maghrebi, and Arab influences.\nThe Sicilian cook Mithaecus, born during 5th century BC, is credited with having brought knowledge of Sicilian gastronomy to Greece: his cookbook was the first in Greek, therefore he was the earliest cookbook author in any language whose name is known.\nOverview.\nSicily shows traces of all the cultures which established themselves on the island over the last two millennia. Although its cuisine undoubtedly has a predominantly Italian base, Sicilian food also has Spanish, Greek, and Arab influences.\nThe ancient Romans introduced lavish dishes based on goose. The Byzantines favoured sweet and sour flavours and the Arabs brought sugar, citrus, rice, spinach, and saffron. The Normans and Hohenstaufens had a fondness for meat dishes. The Spanish introduced items from the New World including chocolate, maize, turkey, and tomatoes. Sicilian cuisine not only reflects a mix of historical influences, but also embodies traditions that have been preserved through the use of local ingredients and age-old techniques, particularly in dishes such as arancini and cassata, which showcase the island's unique culinary heritage.\nMuch of the island's cuisine encourages the use of fresh vegetables such as aubergine, peppers, and tomatoes, as well as fish such as tuna, seabream, sea bass, swordfish, and cuttlefish. In Trapani, in the extreme western corner of the island, North African influences are clear in the use of various couscous based dishes, usually combined with fish. Mint is used extensively in cooking unlike the rest of Italy.\nTraditional specialties from Sicily include arancini (a form of deep-fried rice croquettes), , caponata, , and a host of desserts and sweets such as cannoli, granita, and cassata.\nTypical of Sicily is Marsala, a red, fortified wine similar to Port and largely exported.\nHistory.\nMuch of the island was initially settled by Greek colonists, who left a preference for fish, wheat, olives, grapes, broad beans, chickpeas, lentils, almonds, pistachios, and fresh vegetables.\nArab influences on Sicilian cuisine trace to the Arab domination of Sicily in the 10th and early 11th centuries, and include the use of sugar, citrus, rice, raisins, pine nuts and spices such as saffron, nutmeg, and cinnamon. Norman influences are also found, such as in the fondness for meat dishes. The Jewish community, who lived in the island, also left their mark on the Sicilian cuisine, they were responsible for introducing garlic fried in olive oil into the sauce. Later, the Spanish introduced numerous items from the New World, including cocoa, maize, peppers, zucchini, potatoes, and tomatoes, along with other produce. Much of the island's cuisine encourages the use of fresh vegetables such as eggplant, artichoke, and tomatoes, and fish such as tuna, sea bream, sea bass, cuttlefish, and swordfish. In Trapani in the extreme western corner of the island, North African influences are clear in the use of couscous.\nDishes.\nStarters.\nThe starters (called antipasti) are an important aspect of Sicilian cuisine. Common Sicilian starters include caponata and \"gat\u00f2 di patate\" (a kind of potato and cheese pie).\nSoups.\n\"Maccu\" is a Sicilian soup and foodstuff prepared with fava beans as a primary ingredient. It is a peasant food and staple that dates back to ancient history. \"Maccu di San Giuseppe\" (lit.\u2009'\"maccu\" of St. Joseph') is a traditional Sicilian dish that consists of various ingredients and \"maccu\". The dish may be prepared on Saint Joseph's Day in Sicily, to clear out pantries and allow room for the spring's new crops of vegetables.\nPasta.\nSicily is the oldest Italian and Western location on record where pasta worked into long and thin form was part of the local cuisine. This dates back to around the 12th century, as attested by the Tabula Rogeriana of Muhammad al-Idrisi, reporting some traditions about the Kingdom of Sicily.\n\"Spaghetti ai ricci di mare\" (spaghetti prepared with sea urchin), \"pasta\" \"con le sarde\" (with sardines) and \"pasta alla Norma\" (with eggplant and a specialty that originated in Catania) are the most popular pasta dishes that are typically Sicilian. Cannelloni is another common dish. Another popular dish in eastern Sicily is pasta with \"capuliato\".\nMain dish.\nAfter the pasta, the typical Sicilian menu includes a second or main dish (\"secondi\") based on meat or fish. Main dishes based on seafood are \"couscous\" \"al pesce\" and \"pesce spada alla ghiotta\" (swordfish).\nDesserts and sweets.\nTraditional sugar statues, called \"pupa di cena\", are still made, although now featuring modern celebrities or culture figures.\nSweets are another specialty. Examples include: \"frutta martorana\", \"pignolata of Messina\", \"buccellato\", cannoli, granita, \"cassata\" \"siciliana\" and the \"crocetta di Caltanissetta\", a sweet that disappeared and was rediscovered in 2014.\nCandy in Sicily was heavily influenced by the Arab candymakers in the 9th century, and Sicilian candy has preserved more of that influence than almost any other place in Europe. Marzipan fruits may have been invented at the Convent of Eloise at Martorana in the 14th century. In the 17th and 18th centuries, many Sicilian monasteries produced candies and pastries, some with fertility themes. The only surviving convent to follow this tradition is the Monastery of the Virgins of Palermo, which makes breast-shaped cakes in honor of Saint Agatha of Sicily.\nGranita is particularly famous and well known. It is a semi-frozen dessert of sugar, water, and flavourings originally from the island, and is commonly associated with Messina or Catania, even though there is no evident proof that it hails from any particular Sicilian city. Related to sorbet and Italian ice, in most of Sicily it has a coarser, more crystalline texture. Food writer Jeffrey Steingarten says that \"the desired texture seems to vary from city to city\" on the island; on the west coast and in Palermo, it is at its chunkiest, and in the east it is nearly as smooth as sorbet. This is largely the result of different freezing techniques: the smoother types are produced in a gelato machine, while the coarser varieties are frozen with only occasional agitation, then scraped or shaved to produce separated crystals.\nFruits.\nCitrus fruits are a popular ingredient in Sicilian cuisine. Many were first introduced by the Arabs from the 9th to 11th centuries, but some, such as the Washington navel from Brazil, have been brought to the island more recently. Examples of citrus fruits found in Sicily are:\nWines and drinks.\nThe drink most often served with the main meal in Sicily is wine. The soil and climate in Sicily are ideal for growing grapes, mainly due to Mount Etna, and a wine-making tradition on the island has existed since at least 4000 BC. Today, all Sicilian provinces produce wine and Sicilian wine produced by modern methods has established itself on the European wine market.\nSicilian red wines have an alcoholic content of 12.5 to 13.5% and are usually drunk in the evening with roast or grilled meat. Well-known red wines include the Cerasuolo di Vittoria and the Nero d'Avola, mainly those produced around Noto (Siracusa). The dry and white wines and ros\u00e9s usually have an alcoholic content from 11.5 to 12.5% and are mainly consumed with fish, poultry and pasta dishes. Sicily is also known for producing dessert wines, such as Marsala and the Malvasia delle Lipari.\nOther common Sicilian alcoholic drinks include limoncello, a lemon liqueur, and Amaro Averna, a herbal drink, which is often consumed after meals as a digestive.\nStreet food.\nSicilians eat large quantities of street food, including the renowned arancini (a form of deep-fried rice croquettes). Popular street foods include, \"pani c\u00e2 meusa\" and \"pane e panelle\" in the Palermo region, \"cartocciate\" and \"cipolline\" in the Catania region, and \"focaccia messinese\" and \"pidone\" \"messinese\" (or \"pitone\" or \"pidune\", in dialect) in the Messina area.\nArancini, also known as \"arancine\", are Italian rice balls that are stuffed, coated with breadcrumbs and deep-fried. They are a staple of Sicilian cuisine. The most common arancini fillings are \"al rag\u00f9\" or \"al sugo\", filled with rag\u00f9 (meat or mince, slow-cooked at low temperature with tomato sauce and spices), mozzarella or \"caciocavallo\" cheese, and often peas, and \"al burro\" or \"\u00f4 burru\", filled with prosciutto and mozzarella or b\u00e9chamel sauce. A number of regional variants exist which differ in their fillings and shape. \"Arancini al rag\u00f9\" produced in eastern Sicily, particularly in cities such as Catania and Messina, have a conical shape inspired by the volcano Etna.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

It is the capital of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Voivodeship, and is located south-west of Warsaw. As of 2024,[ [update]] \u0141\u00f3d\u017a has a population of 645,693, making it the country's fourth largest city.\n\u0141\u00f3d\u017a first appears in records in the 14th century. It was granted town rights in 1423 by the Polish King W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o and it remained a private town of the Kuyavian bishops and clergy until the late 18th century. In the Second Partition of Poland in 1793, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a was annexed to Prussia before becoming part of the Napoleonic Duchy of Warsaw; the city joined Congress Poland, a Russian client state, at the 1815 Congress of Vienna. The Second Industrial Revolution (from 1850) brought rapid growth in textile manufacturing and in population owing to the inflow of migrants, a sizable part of which were Jews and Germans. Ever since the industrialization of the area, the city had been multinational and struggled with social inequalities, as documented in the novel \"The Promised Land\" by Nobel Prize\u2013winning author W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont. The contrasts greatly reflected on the architecture of the city, where luxurious mansions coexisted with red-brick factories and dilapidated tenement houses.\nThe industrial development and demographic surge made \u0141\u00f3d\u017a one of the largest cities in Poland. During the interwar period, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a became an important center for the Polish artistic avant-garde. Founded in 1931, Muzeum Sztuki became the first museum in Europe dedicated to collecting and showcasing modern art. Under the German occupation during World War II, the city's population was persecuted and its large Jewish minority was forced into a walled zone known as the Litzmannstadt Ghetto, after the Nazi German renaming of the city, from where they were sent to German concentration and extermination camps. The city became Poland's temporary seat of power in 1945.\n\u0141\u00f3d\u017a experienced a sharp demographic and economic decline after 1989. It was only in the 2010s that the city began to experience revitalization of its neglected downtown area. \u0141\u00f3d\u017a is ranked by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network on the \"Sufficiency\" level of global influence. The city is internationally known for its National Film School, a cradle for the most renowned Polish actors and directors, including Andrzej Wajda and Roman Pola\u0144ski. In 2017, the city was inducted into the UNESCO Creative Cities Network and named UNESCO City of Film.\nName and toponymy.\nThere is no consensus on the origin of the city's name. The Polish word means 'boat', but popular theories link it with the medieval village of \u0141odzia and the now-canalised River \u0141\u00f3dka on which the modern city was founded. It may also be related to 'willow tree' or the Old Polish personal name W\u0142odzis\u0142aw.\nHistory.\nEarly beginnings (1332\u20131815).\n\u0141\u00f3d\u017a first appears in a 1332 written record issued by W\u0142adys\u0142aw the Hunchback, Duke of \u0141\u0119czyca, which transferred the village of \u0141odzia to the Bishopric of W\u0142oc\u0142awek. The document enumerated the privileges of its inhabitants, notably the right to graze land, establish pastures and engage in logging. In 1423, King of Poland W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o officially granted town rights to the village under Magdeburg Law. For centuries, it remained a small remote settlement situated among woodlands and marshes, which was privately held by the Kuyavian bishops. It was administratively located in the Brzeziny County in the \u0141\u0119czyca Voivodeship in the Greater Poland Province of the Kingdom of Poland. The economy was predominantly driven by agriculture and farming until the 19th century. The earliest two versions of the coat of arms appeared on seal emblems in 1535 and 1577, with the latter illustrating a boat-like vessel and a turned oar.\nWith the Second Partition of Poland in 1793, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a was annexed by Prussia. In 1798, the Kuyavian bishops' ownership over the region was formally revoked during the secularisation of church property. The town, governed by a burgomaster (), at the time had only 190 residents, 44 occupied dwellings, a church and a prison. In 1806, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a was incorporated into the Napoleonic Duchy of Warsaw. In the aftermath of the 1815 Congress of Vienna, the duchy was dissolved and the town became part of the Congress Kingdom of Poland, a client state of the Russian Empire.\nPartitions and development (1815\u20131918).\nIn 1820, the government of the Congress Kingdom designated \u0141\u00f3d\u017a and its rural surroundings for centrally planned industrial development. Rajmund Rembieli\u0144ski, head of the Administrative Council and prefect of Masovia, became the president of a commission that subdivided the works two major phases; the first (1821\u201323) comprised the creation of a new city centre with an octagonal square (contemporary ; Liberty Square) and arranged housing allotments on greenfield land situated south of the old marketplace; the second stage (1824\u201328) involved the establishment of cotton mill colonies and a linear street system along with an arterial north\u2013south thoroughfare, Piotrkowska. Many of the early dwellings were timber cottages built for housing weavers ().\nDuring this time, a sizeable number of German craftsmen settled in the city, encouraged by exemptions from tax obligations. Their settlement in Poland was encouraged by renowned philosopher and statesman Stanis\u0142aw Staszic, who acted as the director of the Department of Trade, Crafts and Industry.\nIn 1851, the Imperial authorities abolished a customs barrier which was imposed on Congress Poland following the failed November Uprising (1830\u20131831). The suppression of tariffs allowed the city to freely export its goods to Russia, where the demand for textiles was high. Poland's first steam-powered loom commenced operations at Ludwik Geyer's White Factory in 1839. During the first weeks of the January Uprising (1863\u20131864), a unit of 300 Polish insurgents entered the city without resistance and seized weapons, and later on, there were also clashes between Polish insurgents and Russian troops in the city. In 1864, the inhabitants of adjacent villages were permitted to settle in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a without restrictions. The development of railways in the region was also instrumental in expanding the textile industry; in 1865 the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a\u2013Koluszki line, a branch of the Warsaw\u2013Vienna railway, was opened, thus providing a train connection to larger markets. In 1867, the city was incorporated into the Piotrk\u00f3w Governorate, a local province.\nThe infrastructure and edifices of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a were built at the expense of industrialists and business magnates, chiefly Karl Wilhelm Scheibler and Izrael Pozna\u0144ski, who sponsored schools, hospitals, orphanages, and places of worship. From 1872 to 1892, Pozna\u0144ski established a major textile manufactory composed of twelve factories, power plants, worker tenements, a private fire station, and a large eclectic palace. By the end of the century, Scheibler's became one of Europe's largest industrial complexes, employing 5,000 workers within a single facility. The years 1870\u20131890 saw the most intense industrialisation, which was marked by social inequalities and dire working conditions. \u0141\u00f3d\u017a soon became a notable centre of the socialist movement and the so-called \u0141\u00f3d\u017a rebellion() in May 1892 was quelled by a military intervention.\nThe turn of the 20th century coincided with cultural and technological progress; in 1899, the first stationary cinema in Poland () was opened in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a. In the same year, J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski, the future Marshal of Poland, settled in the city and began printing the \"Robotnik\" (The Worker; p.\u00a01894\u20131939), an underground newspaper published by the Polish Socialist Party. During the June Days (1905), approximately 100,000 unemployed labourers went on a mass strike, barricaded the streets and clashed with troops. Officially, 151 demonstrators were killed and thousands were wounded. In 1912, the Archcathedral of St. Stanislaus Kostka was completed and its tower at is one of the tallest in Poland.\nDespite the impending crisis preceding World War I, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a grew exponentially and was one of the world's most densely populated industrial cities, with a population density of by 1914. In the aftermath of the Battle of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a (1914), the city came under Imperial German occupation on 6 December. With Polish independence restored in November 1918, the local population disarmed the German army. Subsequently, the textile industry of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a stalled and its population briefly decreased as ethnic Germans left the city.\nRestored Poland (1918\u20131939).\nDespite its large population and economic output, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a did not serve as the seat of its province until the 20th century. Following the establishment of the Second Polish Republic, it became the capital of the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Voivodeship in 1919. The early interwar period was characterised by considerable economic hardship and industrial stagnation. The Great Depression and the German\u2013Polish customs war closed western markets to Polish textiles while the Bolshevik Revolution and the Civil War in Russia put an end to the most profitable trade with the East.\nBecause of rapid and, consequently, chaotic development in the previous century, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a did not possess the adequate infrastructure and living standards for its inhabitants. Pollution was acute, sanitary conditions were poor and the authorities did not invest in a sewage treatment system until the 1920s. From 1918 to 1939, many cultural, educational and scientific institutions were created, including elementary schools, museums, art galleries and public libraries which prior to the First World War did not exist. \u0141\u00f3d\u017a also began developing an entertainment scene, with 34 movie theatres opened by 1939. On 13 September 1925, the city's first airport, Lublinek, commenced operations. In 1930, the first radio transmission from a newly founded broadcasting station took place.\nThe ideological orientation of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a was strongly left-wing and the city was a notable centre of socialist, communist and bundist activity in Polish politics during the interbellum.\nSecond World War (1939\u20131945).\nDuring the invasion of Poland in September 1939, the Polish forces of General Juliusz R\u00f3mmel's Army \u0141\u00f3d\u017a defended the city against the German assault by forming a line of resistance between Sieradz and Piotrk\u00f3w Trybunalski. The attack was conducted by the 8th Army of Johannes Blaskowitz, who encircled the city with the X Army Corps. After fierce resistance, a Polish delegation surrendered to the Germans on 8 September, and the first troops entered in the early hours of 9 September. The German paramilitary death squad entered the city on 12 September. Arthur Greiser incorporated \u0141\u00f3d\u017a into a new administrative subdivision of Nazi Germany called on 9 November 1939, and on 11 April 1940 the city was renamed to after German general and NSDAP member Karl Litzmann.\nThe city became subjected to immediate Germanisation, with Polish and Jewish establishments closed, and Polish-language press banned. Low-wage forced labour was imposed on the city's inhabitants aged 16 to 60; many were subsequently deported to Germany. As part of the , Polish intellectuals from the city and region were imprisoned at Radogoszcz and then either sent to concentration camps or murdered in the forests of \u0141agiewniki and the village of Lu\u0107mierz-Las. Polish children were forcibly taken from their parents, and from 1942 to 1945 the German \"Sicherheitspolizei\" operated a camp for kidnapped Polish children from various regions in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a.\nThe German authorities established the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Ghetto () in the city and populated it with more than 200,000 Jews from the region, who were systematically sent to German extermination camps. It was the second-largest ghetto in occupied Europe, and the last major ghetto to be liquidated, in August 1944. The Polish resistance movement () operated in the city and aided the Jewish people throughout its existence. However, only 877 Jews were still alive by 1945. Of the 223,000 Jews in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a before the invasion, 10,000 survived the Holocaust in other places. The Germans also created camps for non-Jews, including the Romani people deported from abroad, who were ultimately murdered at Che\u0142mno, as well as a penal forced labour camp, four transit camps for Poles expelled from the city and region, and a racial research camp.\nPost World War II (1945\u20131989).\nFollowing liberation by Soviet forces on 19 January 1945, and the end of the World War II, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a informally and temporarily took over the functions of Poland's capital, and most of the government and country administration resided in the city prior to the reconstruction of Warsaw.\n\u0141\u00f3d\u017a also experienced an influx of refugees from Kresy. Many migrated into the suburbs and occupied the empty properties. Under the Polish People's Republic, the city's industry and private companies were subject to nationalisation. On 24 May 1945, the University of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a was inaugurated. On 8 March 1948, the National Film School was opened, later becoming Poland's primary academy of drama and cinema.\nThe spatial and urban planning after World War II was conducted in accordance with the Athens Charter, where the population from the old core was relocated into new residential areas. However, as a result, the inner-city and historical areas fell in significance and degenerated into a slum. A number of extensive panel block housing estates were constructed, including Retkinia, Teofil\u00f3w, Widzew, Radogoszcz, and Chojny. These block housing estates were constructed between 1960 and 1990, covering an area of almost and accommodating a large part of the populace.\nIn mid-1981 \u0141\u00f3d\u017a became famous for its massive hunger demonstration of local mothers and their children.\nContemporary history (1990\u2013present).\nAfter 1989 the textile industry in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a collapsed and the city suffered from social and economic decline. The city's industrial heritage and examples of Polish Art Nouveau became an early tourist attraction. In the 2000s the city's main street, the Piotrkowska Street, was revitalized, providing space for shops and restaurants. By 2011 the city hosted around 60 festivals per year.\nThe local government's efforts to transform the former industrial city into a thriving urban environment and tourist destination formed the basis for the city's failed bid to organise the 2022 International EXPO exhibition on the subject of urban renewal.\nGeography.\n\u0141\u00f3d\u017a covers an area of approximately and is located in the centre of Poland. The city lies in the lowlands of the Central European Plain, not exceeding 300 metres in elevation. Topographically, the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a region is generally characterised by a flat landscape, with only several highlands which do not exceed 50 metres above the terrain level. The soil is predominantly sandy (62%) followed by clay (24%), silt (8%), and organogenic formations (6%) from regional wetlands. The forest cover (equivalent to 4.2% of the whole country) is considerably low compared to other cities, regions, and provinces of Poland.\nClimate.\n\u0141\u00f3d\u017a has a humid continental climate (\"Dfb\" in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification). The lowest temperature was recorded in January 1987.\nAdministration.\nGovernment.\nThe city's governance is executed by \"Urz\u0105d Miasta \u0141odzi\", a local council or town hall, currently based at Juliusz Heinzl Palace. The power is divided between the President of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a (\"Prezydent \u0141odzi\"), a title held by the mayor, and the \"Rada Miejska\" assembly comprising 37 elected deputies. The term in office for deputies is 5 years. \u0141\u00f3d\u017a also acts as a city with powiat rights, exercising the powers and duties of a local powiat county.\n\u0141\u00f3d\u017a is the capital of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Voivodeship, one of Poland's 16 provinces, and hosts the voivodeship sejmik \u2013 a regional assembly. The city is also the seat of the voivode, the province's governor who is the representative of the Polish Council of Ministers in the voivodeship, is the head of the combined government administration, acts as supervisory authority over local government units and as a higher-level authority within the meaning of the provisions on administrative proceedings.\nIn medieval times, the town was governed by the burgomaster, who began his term as early as 1470. The first individual who held the title of \n\"president\" was Karol Tangermann, a close aide of Rajmund Rembieli\u0144ski, when it was still a part of Congress Poland. The first president of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a under the independent Second Polish Republic was Leopold Skulski (1917\u20131919), who subsequently became the prime minister of Poland. The incumbent president since 2010 is Hanna Zdanowska from the Civic Coalition party.\nAdministrative division.\n\u0141\u00f3d\u017a was previously divided into 5 major boroughs (\"dzielnica\") \u2013 Ba\u0142uty, G\u00f3rna, Polesie, \u015ar\u00f3dmie\u015bcie, and Widzew. In January 1993, the system of boroughs was abolished and the city became a single entity with no real subdivisions. In April 2000, a system of 36 neighbourhoods or dependent units (\"osiedle\") was imposed by the City Council for administrative purposes only; these units have no local governing or regulatory authority.\nDemographics.\nAccording to Statistics Poland (GUS), \u0141\u00f3d\u017a was inhabited by 672,185 people and had a population density of 2,292\u00a0persons per square kilometre (5,940/sq mi), as of \u00a02020.[ [update]] Approximately 55.7 per cent of inhabitants are of working age (18\u201364 years), which is a considerable decrease from 64.1 per cent in 2010. An estimated 29.1 per cent is of post-working age compared to 21.8 per cent ten years earlier. In 2020, 54.39 per cent (365,500) of all residents were women. \u0141\u00f3d\u017a has one of the highest feminisation rates among Poland's major cities, a legacy of the city's industrial past, when the textile factories attracted large numbers of female employees.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAt its peak in 1988 the population was around 854,000; however, this has since declined due to low fertility rates, outward migration and a lower life expectancy than in other parts of Poland. \u0141\u00f3d\u017a was the country's second largest city until 2007, when it lost its position to Krak\u00f3w. A major contributing factor was the abrupt transition from socialist to market-based economy after 1989 and the resulting economic crisis, but the economic growth which followed has not reversed the trend. Depopulation and ageing are major impediments for the future development of the city, putting strain on social infrastructure and medical services. As a result of the continuing demographic crisis and rapid population loss, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a was overtaken by Wroc\u0142aw and dropped to become the country's fourth-largest city in 2022.\nHistorically, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a was multi-ethnic and its diverse population comprised migrants from other regions of Europe. In 1839, approximately 78 per cent (6,648) of the total population was German. In 1913, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a had a population of 506,100 people, of whom 251,700 (49.7%) were Poles, 171,900 (34%) were Jews, 75,000 (14.8%) were Germans, and 6,300 (1.3%) were Russians. According to the 1931 Polish census, the total population of 604,000 included 375,000 (59%) Poles, 192,000 (32%) Jews and 54,000 (9%) Germans. By 1939, the Jewish minority had grown to well over 200,000.\nReligion.\nThe majority of believers in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a adhere to Roman Catholicism, the largest religious denomination in Poland. The first Catholic bishopric was established in December 1920 and has been elevated to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a in 1992 by Pope John Paul II. The primary church for Catholic worship is the Basilica of St. Stanislaus Kostka, which is often reserved for special occasions or during religious holidays. Constructed in 1912 in the Gothic Revival style, it is the tallest building in the city and one of Poland's tallest churches since the completion of the tower in 1927. The Feast of Corpus Christi is widely celebrated and annual marches take place on Piotrkowska Street, in front of the cathedral. Despite this, church attendance in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a is one of the lowest in Poland; mass attendance was estimated at 26% in 2013 and fell to 17% by 2023. Statistics also show that the city and its environs have one of the highest concentration of atheists in Poland.\nHistorically, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a had a strong and influential Protestant population (11% in 1921, 9.2% in 1931) that had its origins with the migration of German-speaking weavers and textile workers throughout the 19th century. The Evangelical Church of the Augsburg Confession representing Lutherans is the largest of the Protestant denominations. The city falls under the Lutheran Diocese of Warsaw, though the congregation is headquartered at the Church of St. Peter and St. Paul in Pabianice. The only active Lutheran church in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a is the historic St. Matthew's Church, which seasonally serves as a concert hall. There is also a parish of the Polish Reformed Church (Calvinist), dating back to 1888, as well as Methodist and Evangelical temples. \u0141\u00f3d\u017a is considered to be one of the centres of Jehovah's Witnesses' activity in Poland.\nJudaism was once the city's second largest denomination (33.4% in 1931), with up to 250 synagogues and shtiebels in existence prior to 1939 and a strong cultural output. The Stara Synagogue, commonly known as Alte Szil, and Ezras Israel Synagogue were the primary places of worship for Orthodox Jews. The Great Synagogue, the largest of its kind, served the Reformed Jewish community. All were destroyed during the Second World War, except for the defunct 19th-century Synagoga Reicher\u00f3w. The Union of Jewish Religious Communities in Poland (ZGW\u017b) manages the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a municipality; the local base is situated at a newer synagogue on Pomorska Street where the Community maintains kosher facilities and a mikveh.\n\u0141\u00f3d\u017a is the seat of a Mariavite Church diocese, initially created in 1910. The Marivites are followers of Old Catholicism and a considerable minority; there are only three Mariavite dioceses across the country.\nEconomy and infrastructure.\nBefore 1990, the economy of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a was heavily reliant on the textile industry, which had developed in the city in the nineteenth century owing to the abundance of rivers used to power the industry's fulling mills, bleaching plants and other machinery. Because of the growth in this industry, the city has sometimes been called the \"Polish Manchester\" and the \"lingerie capital of Poland\". As a result, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a grew from a population of 13,000 in 1840 to over 500,000 in 1913. By the time right before World War I \u0141\u00f3d\u017a had become one of the most densely populated industrial cities in the world, with 13,280 inhabitants per km2, and also one of the most polluted. The textile industry declined dramatically in 1990 and 1991, and no major textile company survives in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a. However, countless small companies still provide a significant output of textiles, mostly for export. \u0141\u00f3d\u017a is no longer a significant industrial centre, but it has become a major hub for the business services sector in Poland owing to the availability of highly skilled workers and active cooperation between local universities and the business sector.\nThe city benefits from its central location in Poland. A number of firms have located their logistics centres in the vicinity. Two motorways, A1 spanning from the north to the south of Poland, and A2 going from the east to the west, intersect northeast of the city. As of 2012,[ [update]] the A2 is complete to Warsaw and the northern section of A1 is largely completed. With these connections, the advantages of the city's central location should increase even further. Work has also begun on upgrading the railway connection with Warsaw, which reduced the 2-hour travel time to make the journey 1.5 hours in 2009. As of 2018,[ [update]] travel time from \u0141\u00f3d\u017a to Warsaw is around 1.2 hours with the modern Pesa Dart trains.\nRecent years have seen many foreign companies opening and establishing their offices in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a. The Indian IT company Infosys has one of its centres in the city. In January 2009 Dell announced that it will shift production from its plant in Limerick, Ireland to its plant in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a. The city's investor friendly policies have attracted 980 foreign investors by January 2009. Foreign investment was one of the factors which decreased the unemployment rate in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a to 6.5 per cent in December 2008, from 20 per cent four years earlier.\nTransport.\n\u0141\u00f3d\u017a is situated near the geographical centre of Poland, only a short distance away from the motorway junction in Stryk\u00f3w where the two main north\u2013south (A1) and east\u2013west (A2) Polish transport corridors meet, which positions the city on two of the ten major trans-European routes: from Gda\u0144sk to \u017dilina and Brno and from Berlin to Moscow via Warsaw. It is also part of the New Silk Road, a regular cargo rail connection with the Chinese city of Chengdu operating since 2013. \u0141\u00f3d\u017a is served by the national motorway network, an international airport, and long-distance and regional railways. It is at the centre of a regional and commuter rail network operating from the city's various train stations. Bus and tram services are operated by a municipal public transport company. There are of bicycle routes throughout the city (as in January 2019).\nMajor roads include:\nAirport.\nThe city has an international airport: \u0141\u00f3d\u017a W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont Airport located from the city centre. Flights connect the city with destinations in Europe including Turkey. In 2014 the airport handled 253,772 passengers. It is the 8th largest airport in Poland.\nPublic transport.\nThe Municipal Transport Company \u2013 \u0141\u00f3d\u017a (Miejskie Przedsi\u0119biorstwo Komunikacyjne \u2013 \u0141\u00f3d\u017a), owned by the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a City Government, is responsible for operating 58 bus routes and 19 tram lines. The tram network is one of the longest in the country and was the first electrified cable tramway in Congress Poland, beginning its operation on 23 December 1898. The regional tramway network also connects \u0141\u00f3d\u017a with the adjacent cities of Pabianice (since 2023) and Konstantyn\u00f3w \u0141\u00f3dzki (since 2024), which are within the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Agglomeration. The rolling stock largely comprises older but modernised wagons by Konstal and newer Polish-manufactured types such as Pesa Swing and Moderus Gamma. Among the popular models for buses are Mercedes Conecto LF and Solaris Urbino 18.\nRail.\n\u0141\u00f3d\u017a has a number of long distance and local railway stations. There are two main stations in the city, but with no direct rail connection between them\u2014a legacy of 19th-century railway network planning. Originally constructed in 1866, the centrally located \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Fabryczna was a terminus station for a branch line of the Warsaw\u2013Vienna railway, whereas \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Kaliska was built more than thirty years later on the central section of the Warsaw-Kalisz railway. For this reason most intercity train traffic goes to this day through \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Kaliska station, despite its relative distance from the city centre, and \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Fabryczna serves mainly as a terminal station for trains to Warsaw. The situation will be remedied in 2026 after the construction of a tunnel connecting the two, which is likely to make \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Poland's main railway hub. The tunnel will additionally serve \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Commuter Railway, providing a rapid transit system for the city, dubbed the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Metro by the media and local authorities. Three new stations are being constructed on the underground line, one serving the needs of the Manufaktura complex, another one serving Koziny neighbourhood and the third one located in the area of Piotrkowska Street.\nIn December 2016, a few years after the demolition of the old building of station, a new underground station was opened. It is considered to be the largest and most modern of all train stations in Poland and is designed to handle increased traffic after the construction of the tunnel. It also serves as a multimodal transport hub, featuring an underground intercity bus station, and is integrated with a new transport interchange serving taxis and local trams and buses. The construction of the new \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Fabryczna station was part of a broader project of urban renewal known as Nowe Centrum \u0141odzi (New Centre of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a).\nThe third-largest train station in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a is \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Widzew. There are also many other stations and train stops in the city, many of which were upgraded as part of the \u0141\u00f3dzka Kolej Aglomeracyjna commuter rail project. The rail service, founded as part of a major regional rail upgrade and owned by \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Voivodeship, operates on routes to Kutno, Sieradz, Skierniewice, \u0141owicz, and on selected days to Warsaw, with plans for further expansion after the construction of the tunnel.\nEducation.\n\u0141\u00f3d\u017a is a thriving center of academic life. \u0141\u00f3d\u017a hosts three major state-owned universities, six higher education establishments operating for more than a half of the century, and a number of smaller schools of higher education. The tertiary institutions with the most students in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a include:\nIn the 2018 general ranking of state-owned tertiary education institutions in Poland, the University of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a came 20th (6th place among universities) and Lodz University of Technology 12th (6th place among technical universities). The Medical University of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a was ranked 5th among Polish medical universities. Leading courses taught in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a include administration (3rd place), law (4th) and biology (4th).\nThere is also a number of private-owned institutions of higher learning in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a. The largest of these are the University of Social Sciences () and the University of Humanities and Economics in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a (). In the 2018 ranking of private universities in Poland the former was ranked 9th, and the latter 23rd.\nNational Film School in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a.\nThe Leon Schiller National Higher School of Film, Television and Theatre in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a () is the most notable academy for future actors, directors, photographers, camera operators and TV staff in Poland. It was founded on 8 March 1948 and was initially planned to be moved to Warsaw as soon as the city was rebuilt following the Warsaw Uprising. However, in the end the school remained in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a and became one of the best-known institutions of higher education in the city.\nAt the end of the Second World War \u0141\u00f3d\u017a was the only large Polish city besides Krak\u00f3w which war had not destroyed. The creation of the National Film School gave \u0141\u00f3d\u017a a role of greater importance from a cultural viewpoint, which before the war had belonged exclusively to Warsaw and Krak\u00f3w. Early students of the School include the directors Andrzej Munk, Roman Polanski, Andrzej Wajda, Kazimierz Karabasz (one of the founders of the so-called Black Series of Polish Documentary) and Janusz Morgenstern, who at the end of the 1950s became famous as one of the founders of the Polish Film School of Cinematography.\nCulture.\nLandmarks and events.\nThe most notable and recognizable landmark of the city is Piotrkowska Street, which remains the high-street and main tourist attraction in the city, runs north to south for a little over . This makes it one of the longest commercial streets in the world. Most of the building fa\u00e7ades, many of which date back to the 19th century, have been renovated. It is the site of most restaurants, bars and cafes in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a's city centre. Important monuments of architecture along Piotrkowska Street are the Old Town Hall, the Descent Of The Holy Spirit Church, the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Catholic Cathedral and the St. Matthew's Lutheran Church. Other important churches in the city center include the Alexander Nevsky Orthodox Cathedral and the Karol Scheibler's Chapel, Lutheran part of Ogrodowa Street Cemetery.\nMany neglected tenement houses and factories throughout the entire city centre have been renovated in recent years as part of the ongoing revitalization project run by the local authorities. The best example of urban regeneration in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a is the Manufaktura complex, occupying a large area of a former cotton factory dating back to the nineteenth century. The site, which was the heart of Izrael Pozna\u0144ski's industrial empire, hosts a shopping mall, numerous restaurants, 4-star hotel, multiplex cinema, factory museum, bowling and fitness facilities and a science exhibition centre. Opened in 2006, it quickly became a centre of cultural entertainment and shopping, as well as a recognizable city landmark attracting both domestic and foreign tourists. Another example is the former factory of Karl Scheibler on Ksi\u0119\u017cy M\u0142yn, which was turned into a mixed-use complex of offices and housing.\n\u0141\u00f3d\u017a also provides plenty of green spaces for recreation. Woodland areas cover 9.61% of the city, with parks taking up an additional 2.37% of the area of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a (as of 2014).[ [update]] ('\u0141agiewnicki Forest') is recognized as the largest forested area within the administrative borders of any city in Europe. It has an area of 1,245 ha and is cut across by a number of hiking trails that traverse the hilly landscape on the western edge of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Hills Landscape Park. A \"natural complex which has remained nearly intact as oak-hornbeam and oak woodland,\" the forest is also rich in history, and its attractions include a Franciscan friary dating back to the early 18th century and two 17th-century wooden chapels.\nOut of a total of 44 parks in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a (as of 2014),[ [update]] 11 have historical status, the oldest of them dating back to the middle of the 19th century. The largest of these, J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski Park (), is located near the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Zoo and the city's botanical garden, and together with them it comprises an extensive green complex known as serving the recreational needs of the city. Another notable park located in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a is the J\u00f3zef Poniatowski Park.\nThe Jewish Cemetery at Bracka Street, one of the largest of its kind in Europe, was established in 1892. After the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany in 1939, this cemetery became a part of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a's \"eastern territory\" known as the enclosed \u0141\u00f3d\u017a ghetto (\"Ghetto Field\"). Between 1940 and 1944, approximately 43,000 burials took place within the grounds of this rounded-up cemetery. In 1956, a monument by Muszko in memory of the victims of the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Ghetto was erected at the cemetery. It features a smooth obelisk, a menorah, and a broken oak tree with leaves stemming from the tree (symbolizing death, especially death at a young age). As of 2014,[ [update]] the cemetery has an area of . It contains approximately 180,000 graves, approximately 65,000 labelled tombstones, ohels and mausoleums. Many of these monuments have significant architectural value; 100 of these have been declared historical monuments and have been in various stages of restoration. The mausoleum of Izrael and Eleanora Pozna\u0144ski is perhaps the largest Jewish tombstone in the world and the only one decorated with mosaics.\nMuseums in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a.\n\u0141\u00f3d\u017a has one of the best museums of modern art in Poland. has three branches, two of which (ms1 and ms2) display collections of 20th and 21st-century art. The newest addition to the museum, ms2 was opened in 2008 in the Manufaktura complex. The unique collection of the Museum is presented in an unconventional way. Instead of a chronological lecture on the development of art, works of art representing various periods and movements are arranged into a story touching themes and motifs important for the contemporary public. The third branch of , located in one of the city's many industrial palaces, also has more traditional art on display, presenting works by European and Polish masters such as Stanis\u0142aw Wyspia\u0144ski and Henryk Rodakowski.\nAmong the 14 registered museums to be found in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, there is the independent Book Art Museum, awarded the American Printing History Association's Institutional Award for 2015 for its outstanding contribution to the study, recording, preservation, and dissemination of printing history in Poland over the last 35 years. Other notable museums include the Central Museum of Textiles with its open-air display of wooden architecture, the Cinematography Museum, located in Scheibler Palace, and the Museum of Independence Traditions, occupying the building of a historical Tsarist prison from the late 19th century. A more unusual establishment, the museum offers tourists a chance to visit the municipal sewer designed in the early years of the 20th century by the British engineer William Heerlein Lindley.\n\u0141\u00f3d\u017a in literature and cinema.\nThree major novels depict the development of industrial \u0141\u00f3d\u017a: W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont's \"The Promised Land\" (1898), Joseph Roth's \"Hotel Savoy\" (1924) and Israel Joshua Singer's \"The Brothers Ashkenazi\" (1937). Roth's novel depicts the city on the eve of a workers' riot in 1919. Reymont's novel was made into a film by Andrzej Wajda in 1975. In the 1990 film \"Europa Europa\", Solomon Perel's family flees pre-World War II Berlin and settles in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a. Pawe\u0142 Pawlikowski's film \"Ida\" was partially shot in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a. Much of David Lynch's film Inland Empire was shot in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a. Chava Rosenfarb's Yiddish trilogy \"The Tree of Life\" (1972; English translation 1985) portrays life within the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Ghetto.\nCuisine and food.\nAmong the traditional dishes of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a and the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Voivodeship are \"zalewajka\" \u2013 a sour cereal and potato soup, often served with mushrooms, kielbasa sausage and bread \u2013 and cabbage soup (\"kapu\u015bniak\") served with potato dumplings and pork cracklings. These were once the staples of the working-class population employed in textile factories. Popular breads and baked goods include the \"angielka\" baguette roll and \"\u017culik\" bun with raisins. Aspic in various forms (\"galareta\", \"zimne n\u00f3\u017cki\" or \"drygle\") was once a well-established comfort and party food in the city. \u0141\u00f3d\u017a and the surrounding region is also known for having a strong preference for mushroom soup over barszcz (borscht) for the Polish Wigilia Christmas Eve supper.\nMajor food venues are primarily located at Piotrkowska Street, for example the OFF Piotrkowska, a mixed-use development complex situated in a heritage-listed red brick factory. Food trucks are a common sight around the city centre and several neighbourhoods.\nSport.\nThe city has experience as a host for international sporting events such as the 2009 EuroBasket, the 2011 EuroBasket Women, the 2014 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship and the 2019 FIFA U-20 World Cup, with the opening and final of the latter taking place at Widzew Stadium. \u0141\u00f3d\u017a will also host the sixth edition of the European Universities Games in 2022.\nUnder communism it was common for clubs to participate in many different sports for all ages and sexes. Many of these traditional clubs still survive. Originally they were owned directly by a public body, but have become independently operated by clubs or private companies. However, they get public support through the cheap rent of land and other subsidies from the city. Some of their sections have gone professional and separated from the clubs as private companies. For example, Budowlani S.A is a private company that owns the only professional rugby team in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, while Klub Sportowy Budowlani remains a community amateur club.\nIn Ekstraklasa of Polish beach soccer \u0141\u00f3d\u017a have three professional clubs: Grembach, KP and BSCC.\nHorticultural Expo 2029.\n\u0141\u00f3d\u017a bid for the Specialized Expo 2022/2023 but lost out to Buenos Aires, Argentina.\n\u0141\u00f3d\u017a was planned to host the Horticultural Expo in 2024. However, multiple Expo events were delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a Horticultural Expo in Doha, Qatar from 2021/22 to 23/24 among them. As a result, the Horticultural Expo in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a has been rescheduled to 2029 to maintain a required time interval between them.\nInternational relations.\n\u0141\u00f3d\u017a is home to fourteen foreign consulates, i.e. honorary consulates general of Hungary and Turkey, and honorary consulates of Albania, Armenia, Austria, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Moldova and Ukraine.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\n\u0141\u00f3d\u017a is twinned with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\n\u0141\u00f3d\u017a belongs also to the Eurocities network.\nAfter the Russian invasion of Ukraine, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a terminated the partnership with Russian cities Ivanovo and Kaliningrad, and with Minsk, the capital of Belarus on 2 March 2022.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nInline citations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the capital of the Warmian\u2013Masurian Voivodeship, and is a city with county rights. The population of the city was estimated at 169,793 residents in 2021.[ [update]]\nOlsztyn is the largest city in Warmia, and has been the capital of the voivodeship since 1999. In the same year, the University of Warmia and Masuria was founded from the fusion of three other local universities. The city is the seat of the Archbishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Warmia.\nThe most important sights of the city include the Old Town with the medieval Castle of Warmian Cathedral Chapter and St. James Co-cathedral, which dates back more than 600 years. The market square is part of the European Route of Brick Gothic and the co-cathedral is regarded as one of the greatest monuments of Gothic architecture in Poland. The city is also known for its association with Nicolaus Copernicus, who lived there and commanded the successful Polish defense of the city during a 1521 Teutonic invasion, with the castle containg an astronomical table made by Copernicus. Today, the castle houses a museum and is a venue for concerts, art exhibitions, film shows and other cultural events, which make Olsztyn a popular tourist destination.\nOlsztyn, for a number of years, has been ranked very highly in quality of life, income, employment and safety. It is one of the best places in Poland to live and work. It is also one of the happiest cities in the country.\nHistory.\nMiddle Ages.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistorical affiliations\n Teutonic Order 1353\u20131454\n Kingdom of Poland 1454\u20131455\n Teutonic Order 1455\u20131463\n Kingdom of Poland 1463\u20131569\n Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth 1569\u20131772\n Kingdom of Prussia 1772\u20131918\n German Empire 1871\u20131918\n Weimar Germany 1918\u20131933\n Nazi Germany 1933\u20131945\n People's Republic of Poland 1945\u20131989\n Republic of Poland 1990\u2013present\nIn 1334, a watchtower was established on the \u0141yna River. In 1346, the forest was cleared at the location for a new settlement, mentioned in a historical document from 1348. The following year, the Teutonic Knights began the construction of an \"Ordensburg\" (castle) as a stronghold against the Baltic Prussians. Allenstein was granted municipal rights by the cathedral chapter of the Bishopric of Warmia in October 1353. The German \"Allenstein\" referred to the river's Baltic Prussian name \"Alna\", which meant a hind. Local Poles, having arrived along with German settlers, called it \"Holstin\" and \"Olsztyn\", which are Polonizations of the German name. The castle was completed in 1397. The town was captured by the Kingdom of Poland during the Polish-Lithuanian-Teutonic War in 1410, and again in 1414 during the Hunger War, but it was returned to the monastic state of the Teutonic Knights after hostilities ended.\nThe city joined the Prussian Confederation in 1440, and rebelled against the Teutonic Knights in 1454 upon the outbreak of the Thirteen Years' War to join the Kingdom of Poland under King Casimir IV Jagiellon. In 1454, upon the request of the Confederation, King Casimir IV signed the act of incorporation of the region to Poland, and the townspeople took the castle and recognized the Polish king as the rightful ruler. Although the Teutonic Knights recaptured the city the following year, it was retaken by Polish troops in 1463. The Second Peace of Thorn in 1466 confirmed Allenstein as part of the Kingdom of Poland. Administratively it was located in the Prince-Bishopric of Warmia within the provinces of Royal Prussia and Greater Poland.\nEarly modern era.\nFrom 1516 to 1521, Nicolaus Copernicus lived in the town castle as an administrator and then in Mehlsack (Melzak, now Pieni\u0119\u017cno). Copernicus was in charge of the Polish defences in the Siege of Allenstein during the Polish-Teutonic War of 1519\u201321. He also started and managed the repopulation of the region, inviting a new wave of Polish settlers from Mazovia. The town along with Warmia then entered what is considered the region's golden age, when crafts and trade developed, thanks also to the city's location on the Warsaw-K\u00f6nigsberg trade route. During this period, the city was still visited several times by Copernicus, as well as leading figures of the Polish Renaissance, writers, royal secretaries and diplomats: Johannes Dantiscus, called the \"father of Polish diplomacy\", and Marcin Kromer, who was also a historian and music theorist. St. James' Pro-Cathedral, one of the most distinctive landmarks of the cityscape, was completed at that time.\nProsperity was halted in the 1620s, when the town suffered a fire and an epidemic. In 1626, during the Swedish invasion, clerics from Frauenburg (Frombork) took refuge in the town, which the Swedes did not reach. The city was sacked by Swedish troops later, in 1655 and 1708, during the next Polish-Swedish wars, and its population was nearly wiped out in 1710 by epidemics of the bubonic plague and cholera.\nThe town became part of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1772 after the First Partition of Poland and its economy initially collapsed. Poles became subject to extensive Germanisation policies. A Prussian census recorded a population of 1,770 people, predominantly farmers, and Allenstein was administered within the newly created Province of East Prussia.\nLate modern era.\nOn February 3, 1807, the Battle of Allenstein took place. The French Army clashed with the Imperial Russian army. On that day, Allenstein was visited by Napoleon Bonaparte. Napoleon gathered enormous forces in the city and planned to engage the Russians and Prussians in a decisive battle. The Russian army was stationed in Jonkowo, but retreated after the French attack. Thanks to the victory at Allenstein, Napoleon's army was able to move north and a few days later the general Battle of Eylau took place.\nThe growth of the city started again after it became a district seat in 1818, a significant influx of German settlers began and by 1825, the town was inhabited by 1,341 Germans and 1,266 Poles. In the early 1830s the city suffered from a cholera epidemic and a hunger crisis, however afterwards it flourished again, when despite Germanisation policies it was administered by Polish mayor Jakub Rarkowski from 1836 to 1865. Under Rarkowski the city was expanded and modernized, and the mayor also hid Polish insurgents in the city during the January Uprising. The first German-language newspaper, the \"Allensteiner Zeitung\", began publishing in 1841. Polish historian Wojciech K\u0119trzy\u0144ski was arrested in Jomendorf (the present-day district of Jaroty), and imprisoned in the city's High Gate in 1863 for smuggling weapons for the Polish January Uprising in the Russian Partition of Poland. The town hospital was founded in 1867.\nIn 1871, with the unification of Germany, Allenstein became part of the German Empire. Two years later, the city was connected by railway to Thorn (Toru\u0144). Despite Germanisation attempts the city remained an important Polish centre. Its first Polish language newspaper, the \"Gazeta Olszty\u0144ska\", was founded in 1886. Allenstein's infrastructure developed rapidly: gas was installed in 1890, telephones in 1892, public water supply in 1898, and electricity in 1907. The Provincial Mental Sanatorium Kortau was established in 1886 just south of Allenstein (today part of Olsztyn-Kortowo). In 1905, the city became the capital of Regierungsbezirk Allenstein, a government administrative region in East Prussia. From 1818 to 1910, the city was administered within the East Prussian Allenstein District, after which it became an independent city.\nWorld War I, interbellum and World War II.\nShortly after the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Russian troops captured Allenstein, but it was recovered by the Imperial German Army in the Battle of Tannenberg.\nAfter the defeat of Germany in World War I, the East Prussian plebiscite was held in 1920 to determine whether the populace of the region, including Allenstein, wished to remain in German East Prussia or become part of Poland, which had just regained independence. In order to advertise the plebiscite, special postage stamps were produced by overprinting German stamps and sold on 3 April of that year. One kind of overprint read , while the other read inside an oval whose border gave the full name of the plebiscite commission. Each overprint was applied to 14 denominations ranging from 5 Pfennigs to 3 Marks. The Polish community faced discrimination, Polish rallies were dispersed, the participants were threatened and beaten. In March, Polish activist Bogumi\u0142 Linka died in Allenstein, a few weeks after being attacked by the German militia in nearby Szczytno in Masuria. He was buried in Allenstein, however, his grave was soon devastated by local German nationalists. A monument to Linka was unveiled after Poland regained control of the city after World War II. The presence of a Royal Irish battalion ensured a relative peace in Allenstein. The plebiscite, held on 11 July, produced 16,742 votes for Germany and 342 votes for Poland.\nIn the interwar period, numerous Polish organisations operated in the city, including the Polish Scouting and Guiding Association, Union of Poles in Germany, a People's Bank (\"Bank Ludowy\"), local Poles organised a school, library, puppet theatre. The Polish Consulate also operated. After the January 1933 Nazi seizure of power in Germany, Poles and Jews in Allenstein were increasingly persecuted. In 1935, the German Wehrmacht made the city the seat of the Allenstein \"Milit\u00e4rischer Bereich\". It was then home of the 11th and 217th infantry divisions and 11th Artillery Regiment. At the same time, the football club SV Hindenburg Allenstein played in Allenstein from 1921 to 1945.\nBeginning in 1936, members of the Polish minority were increasingly persecuted, especially members of the Union of Poles in Germany. In early 1939, many local Polish activists were expelled. In an attempt to rig the results of an upcoming census and understate the number of Poles in the city and region, the Germans terrorized the Polish population and, in May 1939, the Gestapo confiscated 10,000 Polish information leaflets in the headquarters of the \"Gazeta Olszty\u0144ska\". In August 1939, Germany introduced martial law in the region, which allowed for even more blatant persecution of Poles. In August and September 1939, the authorities carried out mass arrests of local Poles, including the chairman of the local Polish bank and his assistant, the chief of the \"Rolnik\" Cooperative, and the principal of the local Polish school.\nNazi Germany co-formed the \"Einsatzgruppe V\" in the city, which then entered several Polish cities and towns, including Grudzi\u0105dz, M\u0142awa, Ciechan\u00f3w, \u0141om\u017ca and Siedlce, to commit various atrocities against Poles during the German invasion of Poland that began World War II in 1939. German troops invaded Poland also from Olsztyn (then called Allenstein). After the German invasion of Poland, local Poles were also subjected to mass executions and deportations to occupied Poland. Arrested Poles were held in a local prison and then forced to remove Polish signs and inscriptions in the city, while the German population gathered and insulted them. The \"Gazeta Olszty\u0144ska\" was abolished by the German authorities, the newspaper's headquarters was demolished and the editor-in-chief Seweryn Pieni\u0119\u017cny was arrested and executed in the Hohenbruch concentration camp along with co-publisher Wojciech Ga\u0142\u0119ziewski and the \"Rolnik\" Cooperative chief Leon W\u0142odarczyk, while Pieni\u0119\u017cny's wife was deported to the Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp. The last pre-war Polish consul in Allenstein, Bohdan Ja\u0142owiecki, along with the consulate staff, was imprisoned in the Hohenbruch and Soldau concentration camps, and then murdered. Polish teachers were deported to the Dachau concentration camp.\nDuring the war five forced labour camps were established in the city. On 12 October 1939, the Wehrmacht established an area headquarters for one of its military districts, Wehrkreis I (headquartered at K\u00f6nigsberg), that controlled the environs of Allenstein, including L\u00f6tzen (now Gi\u017cycko), and Ciechan\u00f3w in occupied Poland. As part of the \"Aktion T4\", Nazi Germany conducted medical experiments on the patients of the psychiatric hospital in the present-day district of Kortowo, in which at least 5,000 people were killed.\nOn 22 January 1945, near the end of the war, the city was plundered and burned by the conquering Soviet Red Army, and much of its German population fled. The remaining, mostly Polish population, was subjected to various crimes, including murder, rape and looting. The Soviets also murdered the remaining patients and staff of the psychiatric hospital, who were either burned alive or shot. Remains of three Roman Catholic nuns who served as nurses at Olsztyn's St. Mary's Hospital and were killed by Soviet soldiers in 1945 were excavated in October 2020.\nOn 23 May 1945, the Soviets established a Polish administration in the region which aroused British and American protest. The Polish rule was accepted under the preliminary provisions of the Potsdam Conference. In October 1945, the remaining German population was expelled in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement, and remaining Poles were joined by new Polish settlers, mostly those expelled from pre-war Polish regions of Vilnius, Grodno and Volhynia, annexed by the Soviet Union, as well as settlers from Warsaw, which had been destroyed by German forces during World War II. Reconstruction and removal of damage lasted until the 1950s.\nContemporary history.\nIn December 1945, a match factory was launched in Olsztyn, as the city's first post-war industrial plant of national importance. A tyre factory was founded in Olsztyn in 1967. Its subsequent names included OZOS, Stomil and Michelin. City limits were greatly expanded in 1966 and 1987.\nIn 1956, Olsztyn was the site of the largest Polish demonstration of support for the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. On the 500th anniversary of the birth of Nicolaus Copernicus, in 1973, a planetarium was opened in Olsztyn. In 1989 the former \"Gazeta Olszty\u0144ska\" headquarters was rebuilt and re-opened as a museum. In 1991 Pope John Paul II visited the city. In 1999 the University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn was established, which is now one of the largest universities in northeastern Poland.\nOlsztyn became the capital of the Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship in 1999. It was previously in the Olsztyn Voivodeship.\nOlsztyn Castle.\nThe Olsztyn Castle was built between 1346\u20131353 and by then it had one wing on the north-east side of the rectangular courtyard. Access to the castle leads from the drawbridge over the river \u0141yna, surrounded by a belt of defensive walls and a moat. The south-west wing of the castle was built in the 15th century, the tower situated in the west corner of the courtyard, from the middle of the 14th century, was rebuilt in the early 16th century and had a round shape on a square base and was 40 meters high. At the same time, the castle walls were raised to a height of 12 meters and a second belt of the lower walls was built. The castle walls were partly combined with city walls, which made the castle look as if it had been a powerful bastion defending access to the city.\nThe castle was owned by Warmia Chapter, which until 1454, together with the Prince-Bishopric of Warmia, was under the military protection of the Teutonic Knights and their Monastic State in Prussia.\nThe castle had played a huge role in the Polish-Teutonic wars by then. After the Battle of Grunwald in 1410, the Poles took it after a few days siege. In the Thirteen Years' War (1454\u201366) it was jumping from rule to rule. The Knights threatened the castle and the town in 1521, but the defense was very effective. They contained one failed assault. There is a connection between the history of the castle, the city of Olsztyn, and Nicolaus Copernicus. He prepared the defense of Olsztyn against the invasion of the Teutonic Knights in 1520.\nIn the sixteenth century, there were two prince-bishops of Warmia that stayed there: Johannes Dantiscus \u2013 the first Sarmatian poet, endowed with the imperial laurel wreath for \"Latin Songs\" (1538, 1541) and Marcin Kromer, who wrote with equal ease in Latin and Polish scientific and literary works (1580). Kromer consecrated the chapel of St. Anna, which was built in the south-west wing of the castle. In the course of time, both wings of the castle lost military importance, which for residential purposes has become very convenient. In 1779, Prince-Bishop Ignacy Krasicki stopped here as well.\nAfter the Prussian annexation of Warmia during the First Partition of Poland in 1772, the castle became the property of the state board of estates (\"Kriegs- und Dom\u00e4nenkammer\"\u00a0\u2013 War and Domain Chamber). In 1845, the bridge over the moat was replaced by a causeway better connecting the castle with the city. In 1901\u20131911 a general renovation of the castle was performed, however, several sections of the building were violated at the same time where they changed the original look of the castle e.g. putting on window frames in a cloister. The tower was topped off in 1921 and again in 1926.\nIn 1945, the whole castle became home to the Masurian Museum, which today is called the Museum of Warmia and Masuria. In addition, there are also popular events held within the frameworks of the Olsztyn Artistic Summer and so-called \"evenings of the castle\" and \"Sundays in the Museum\".\nJewish community.\nAlthough Jews were permitted to trade in the city itself and its fairs during the medieval times, they were restricted from trading freely in the villages surrounding the town. In 1718, Bishop Teodor Andrzej Potocki imposed a ban on Jewish trade in the city as well. The ban, even if continued by successive bishops, proved not to be particularly successful in the light of repeated complains by the local merchants about Jewish dealing in animal leather and similar products as the one recorded in 1742. Permanent Jewish settlement can be dated to 1780 when the Jews were finally permitted to settle in the city albeit outside the immediate city walls. In 1814, the Simonson brothers opened the first Jewish store. Yet the growth of the Jewish community worried city authorities, who tried to curb it with restrictions and punitive measures. In 1850, a new law imposed fines and imprisonment on anyone who harboured a \"wandering\" Jew in their home.\nThe roots of the Jewish congregation in the town can be traced to 1820. Shortly after that date, an official prayer room was established on Richterstra\u00dfe. In 1877, the congregation bought a plot of land on Liebst\u00e4dterstra\u00dfe and built a synagogue there. A Jewish cemetery was built on Seestra\u00dfe (present-day Grunwaldzka). At its peak, the town's Jewish population reached 448 people (1933).\nDuring the \"Kristallnacht\", the town synagogue was destroyed by Nazi Germans, only to be later used as a bomb shelter. Today, the site of the former synagogue is occupied by a local sports club.\nBy 1939, only 135 Jews were left in the city. The remainder fled the country. Those who still lived in the town by 1940 were deported to Nazi concentration camps. In June 1946, 16 Holocaust survivors settled in the city and in 1948, the congregation had 190 worshipers. Most of them emigrated to Israel throughout the next few decades. There is no trace of the Jewish cemetery.\nThe city was the birthplace of world-famous Jewish architect Erich Mendelsohn. In town, Mendelsohn planned the mourners' chapel (called the Mendelsohn house) next to the cemetery. The building is restored. In addition, it was the birthplace of German Socialist and SPD leader Hugo Haase. Frieda Strohmberg, an Impressionist, lived and worked in the city from 1910 to 1927. Documentation of the Jewish owned shops in town exists.\nGeography.\nOlsztyn is located in the north-east part of Poland in the region known as the \"Thousand Lakes\".\nGreenbelt.\nMore than half of the forests occupying 21.2% of the city area form a single complex of the Municipal Forest (1050 ha) used mainly for recreation and tourism purposes. Within the Municipal Forest area are situated two peat-land flora sanctuaries, and Redykajny. Municipal greenery (560 ha, 6.5% of the town area) developed in the form of numerous parks, green spots and three cemeteries over a century old. The greenery includes 910 monuments of nature and groups of protected trees in the form of beech, oak, maple and lime-lined avenues.\nLakes.\nThe city is situated in a lake region of forests and plains. There are 15 lakes inside the administrative bounds of the city (13 with areas greater than 1 ha). The overall area of lakes in Olsztyn is about 725 ha, which constitutes 8.25% of the total city area.\nClimate.\nOlsztyn has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: \"Cfb\") using the isotherm or a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: \"Dfb\") using the isotherm.\nAdministrative division.\nOlsztyn is divided into 23 districts:\nThere are many smaller districts: Jakubowo, Karolin, Kolonia Jaroty, Kortowo II, \u0141upstych, Nied\u017awied\u017a, Pi\u0119kna G\u00f3ra, Podlesie, Pozorty, Skarb\u00f3wka Poszman\u00f3wka, S\u0142oneczny Stok, Stare Kie\u017aliny, Stare Miasto, Stare Zalbki, Stary Dw\u00f3r, Track. These do not have council representative assemblies.\nCulture.\nArchitecture.\nThe historic central district of Olsztyn is the Old Town (\"Stare Miasto\"), which contains various historic buildings and structures, including:\nNotable structures outside of the Old Town include:\nMusic.\nThe city is home to the National Symphony Orchestra.\nEconomy.\nThe Michelin Polska tyre company (former Stomil Olsztyn) is the largest employer in the region of Warmia and Masuria. Other important industries are food processing and furniture manufacturing.\nTransportation.\nRoad.\nBus.\nA bus network with 36 bus lines exists, including 6 suburban lines and 2 night-time lines.\nTrolleybus.\nIn 1939, due to poor economic situation throughout the interwar period and the city's growing population, a trolleybus line began operation, partially replacing the original tram network. During the Second World War the cars were mainly driven by women.\nThe trolleybus network consisting of 4 lines was decommissioned on 31 July 1971.\nRail.\nOlsztyn has train connections to various major cities in Poland, including Warsaw, Krak\u00f3w, Gda\u0144sk, Szczecin, Pozna\u0144, Bydgoszcz, Bia\u0142ystok, Wroc\u0142aw, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Toru\u0144, and various towns in the region, including Elbl\u0105g, I\u0142awa, Dzia\u0142dowo and E\u0142k. Olsztyn G\u0142\u00f3wny is the main railway station in the city. Plans exist to demolish the building and replace it with new infrastructure, contrary to previous information about the current building being renovated.\nTram.\nHistorically, the city's first tram line was built in 1907 and gradually expanded over the years. It ceased operation in 1965.\nIn 2006, authorities considered the reintroduction of trams in the city to address transport problems and subsequently concluded feasibility studies on the matter in 2009. An long tram network was built between 2011 and 2015. The contract was signed in 2011 and construction commenced in 2012. It was a first new tram system built in Poland in 55 years; 15 low-floor Tramino trams were ordered from Solaris in September 2012.\nThere are five tram lines in operation.\nIn 2024, a long extension was completed the Turkish manufacturer Durmazlar had been selected to supply 24 trams for the network.\nAir.\nThe region and city is served by Olsztyn-Mazury Airport with scheduled international passenger flights. It is located in Szymany, off Szczytno and south of the city of Olsztyn. The airport operates flights to London, Dortmund, Krak\u00f3w and seasonal flights to Rzesz\u00f3w and Wroc\u0142aw.\nSports.\nThe Memorial of Hubert Jerzy Wagner, an international volleyball friendly tournament, was organized in Olsztyn from 2003 to 2008.

{"id": "44816", "revid": "7611264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44816", "title": "Pragmatics", "text": "Branch of linguistics and semiotics relating context to meaning\nIn linguistics and the philosophy of language, pragmatics is the study of how context contributes to meaning. The field of study evaluates how human language is utilized in social interactions, as well as the relationship between the interpreter and the interpreted. Linguists who specialize in pragmatics are called pragmaticians. The field has been represented since 1986 by the International Pragmatics Association (IPrA).\nPragmatics encompasses phenomena including implicature, speech acts, relevance and conversation, as well as nonverbal communication. Theories of pragmatics go hand-in-hand with theories of semantics, which studies aspects of meaning, and syntax, which examines sentence structures, principles, and relationships. Pragmatics, together with semantics and syntactics, is a part of semiotics. The ability to understand another speaker's intended meaning is called \"pragmatic competence\". In 1938, Charles Morris first distinguished pragmatics as an independent subfield within semiotics, alongside syntax and semantics. Pragmatics emerged as its own subfield in the 1950s after the pioneering work of J. L. Austin and Paul Grice.\nHistory.\nThe intellectual roots of pragmatics trace back to early 20th-century philosophy and semiotics. The term \"pragmatics\" was first introduced by the semiotician Charles Morris in 1938, when he proposed dividing the study of signs (semiology) into three parts: syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. In Morris's formulation, pragmatics would specifically study the relationship between signs and their interpreters (i.e. language users), bringing an external perspective that considers users' context and responses. This idea was influenced by the philosophical tradition of pragmatism (especially the work of C. S. Peirce and colleagues), which emphasized practical consequences and usage in meaning. Mid-century logical philosophers like Rudolf Carnap built on Morris's approach by suggesting that pragmatics should explicitly analyze the interaction between language, speakers, and the referents of words, thereby making the study of meaning more context-sensitive. Around the same time, Yehoshua Bar-Hillel (a student of Carnap) argued that certain \"indexical\" elements of language \u2013 words like \"I\", \"here\", and \"now\" whose reference shifts with context \u2013 must be a central focus of pragmatics. These early insights laid a foundation for viewing meaning as fundamentally tied to context and use, even before pragmatics was recognized as a distinct linguistic discipline.\nIn the mid-20th century, a broader \"pragmatic turn\" took place in the study of language, largely driven by philosophers of language examining how meaning depends on use. The later philosophy of Ludwig Wittgenstein (esp. \"Philosophical Investigations\", 1953) encapsulated this shift with the dictum that \"meaning is use,\" suggesting that words only gain meaning through their function in language games (concrete social interactions). Around the same period, ordinary language philosophers at Oxford began analyzing language not just as an abstract system but as actions performed in particular contexts. A landmark was the work of J. L. Austin, who in the 1950s developed Speech Act Theory. Austin's posthumously published lectures \"How to Do Things with Words\" (1962) demonstrated that utterances can \"perform\" actions (for example, saying \"I apologize\" is the act of apologizing) and distinguished different levels of speech acts (the locutionary, illocutionary, and perlocutionary acts). His colleague John Searle extended this framework in the late 1960s, elaborating a taxonomy of speech act types and the rules governing acts like asserting, questioning, commanding, etc., thereby firmly establishing speech acts as a core topic in pragmatics.\nThe 1967 book \"Pragmatics of Human Communication: A Study of Interactional Patterns, Pathologies, and Paradoxes\" by Paul Watzlawick, Janet Helmick Beavin, and Don D. Jackson, is an early book that featured the word \"pragmatics\" in its title, but it was used in its own interpretation of Morris's earlier conception of the word. The book is not about linguistics, but rather about psychology and family therapy. The book relates to Morris's idea of pragmatics because it considers, broadly speaking, how communication is affected by context; the focus of the book, however, is rather on how communication is affected by different participants interpreting whose behavior was caused by whose in different ways. For instance, one example in the book is that of a husband saying \"I withdraw because she nags\" and the wife saying \"I nag because he withdraws\"; a different example is the husband saying he does not act because the wife dominates, and the wife saying she takes over because the husband is passive. The book would later influence research on psychotherapy and interpersonal communication, as well as the four-sides model, but not linguistics.\nA key figure in linguistic pragmatics, H. Paul Grice, advanced the study of pragmatics in the late 1960s and 1970s by explaining how people \"mean\" more than they literally say. Grice's theory of conversational implicature (first presented in lectures in 1967, published 1975) proposed that speakers and hearers are guided by a cooperative principle and a set of rational conversational maxims (e.g. \"be truthful\", \"be relevant\", \"be brief\", \"be clear\"). By adhering to or deliberately flouting these maxims, speakers can imply additional meanings which listeners infer in context. For example, if Alice asks, \"Can you pass the salt?\" and Bob responds, \"There's a salt shaker on the table,\" Bob's literal statement is simply informative, but pragmatically it \"implies\" an answer (affirming that he \"can\" pass the salt) without directly saying so. The pioneering contributions of Austin (on speech acts) and Grice (on implicature and conversation) in the 1950s\u20131970s are often credited with establishing pragmatics as its own subfield within linguistics. Indeed, before this period, many aspects of meaning that depend on context had been regarded as outside the scope of linguistic theory, but Austin and Grice showed these could be studied systematically.\nIn the 1970s, pragmatics began to gain broader recognition among linguists as a necessary complement to syntax and semantics; in Boston in 1970, the International Symposium on the Pragmatics of Natural Language was held. As the generative grammar revolution led by Noam Chomsky focused on formal syntax and semantics, it became clear that certain phenomena\u2014such as deixis (context-bound reference words), presuppositions (unstated assumptions underlying utterances), and other context-dependent interpretations\u2014could not be adequately explained by grammar and truth-conditional semantics alone. Pragmatics emerged to address this \"leftover\" territory: those aspects of meaning and understanding that require speaker intentions, listener inferences, and real-world knowledge. During this time, two different scholarly traditions in pragmatics crystallized. The first was the Anglo-American tradition, rooted in analytic philosophy of language and exemplified by the work of Austin, Searle, Grice, and their followers. The second was a European continental approach (sometimes called the perspective or functional view of pragmatics), which treated pragmatics as a more holistic perspective on all language behavior, influenced by fields like sociology and anthropology. Despite differing emphases \u2013 the Anglo-American school often analyzing micro-level utterances and logical inference, and the Continental school viewing pragmatics as a general functional dimension of language \u2013 both contributed to the growth of the field in the 1970s and 1980s. By the early 1980s, the institutional and scholarly maturity of pragmatics was evident: a dedicated \"Journal of Pragmatics\" was founded in 1977, comprehensive textbooks and monographs on pragmatics (by authors such as Stephen Levinson and Geoffrey Leech) appeared in 1983, and an International Pragmatics Association (IPrA) was established in 1987 to coordinate research in the field. These milestones marked pragmatics' definitive emergence as an independent discipline within linguistics, concerned specifically with language use and contextual meaning.\nAreas of interest.\nIntroductory textbooks and handbooks generally converge on the idea that pragmatics investigates how language users encode and infer meanings in context, going beyond sentence-level meaning to recover speakers' intentions and manage social relations. Surveys of the field typically distinguish a number of overlapping core areas:\nThese areas are not mutually exclusive; specific phenomena such as deixis, politeness strategies, or scalar implicatures often involve several of them at once, and different theoretical traditions emphasize different subsets of pragmatic concerns.\nAmbiguity.\nAmbiguity refers to when it is difficult to infer meaning without knowing the context, the identity of the speaker or the speaker's intent. For example, the sentence \"You have a green light\" is ambiguous, as without knowing the context, one could reasonably interpret it as meaning:\nAnother example of an ambiguous sentence is, \"I went to the bank.\" This is an example of lexical ambiguity, as the word bank can either be in reference to a place where money is kept, or the edge of a river. To understand what the speaker is truly saying, it is a matter of context, which is why it is pragmatically ambiguous as well.\nSimilarly, the sentence \"Sherlock saw the man with binoculars\" could mean that Sherlock observed the man by using binoculars, or it could mean that Sherlock observed a man who was holding binoculars (\"syntactic ambiguity\"). The meaning of the sentence depends on an understanding of the context and the speaker's intent. As defined in linguistics, a sentence is an abstract entity: a string of words divorced from non-linguistic context, as opposed to an utterance, which is a concrete example of a speech act in a specific context. The more closely conscious subjects stick to common words, idioms, phrasings, and topics, the more easily others can surmise their meaning; the further they stray from common expressions and topics, the wider the variations in interpretations. That suggests that sentences do not have intrinsic meaning, that there is no meaning associated with a sentence or word, and that either can represent an idea only symbolically. \"The cat sat on the mat\" is a sentence in English. If someone were to say to someone else, \"The cat sat on the mat\", the act is itself an utterance. That implies that a sentence, term, expression or word cannot symbolically represent a single true meaning; such meaning is underspecified (which cat sat on which mat?) and potentially ambiguous. By contrast, the meaning of an utterance can be inferred through knowledge of both its linguistic and non-linguistic contexts (which may or may not be sufficient to resolve ambiguity). In mathematics, with Berry's paradox, there arises a similar systematic ambiguity with the word \"definable\".\nReferential uses of language.\nThe referential uses of language are how signs are used to refer to certain items. A sign is the link or relationship between a signified and the signifier as defined by de Saussure and Jean-Ren\u00e9 Huguenin. The signified is some entity or concept in the world. The signifier represents the signified. An example would be:\nSignified: the concept 'cat'\nSignifier: the word \"cat\"\nThe relationship between the two gives the sign meaning. The relationship can be explained further by considering what is meant by \"meaning\". In pragmatics, there are two different types of meaning to consider: semantic-referential meaning and indexical meaning. Semantic-referential meaning refers to the aspect of meaning, which describes events in the world that are independent of the circumstance they are uttered in. An example would be propositions such as:\n\"Santa Claus eats cookies.\"\nIn this case, the proposition is describing that Santa Claus eats cookies. The meaning of the proposition does not rely on whether or not Santa Claus is eating cookies at the time of its utterance. Santa Claus could be eating cookies at any time and the meaning of the proposition would remain the same. The meaning is simply describing something that is the case in the world. In contrast, the proposition, \"Santa Claus is eating a cookie right now\", describes events that are happening at the time the proposition is uttered.\nSemantic-referential meaning is also present in meta-semantical statements such as:\nTiger: carnivorous, a mammal\nIf someone were to say that a tiger is a carnivorous animal in one context and a mammal in another, the definition of tiger would still be the same. The meaning of the sign tiger is describing some animal in the world, which does not change in either circumstance.\nIndexical meaning, on the other hand, is dependent on the context of the utterance and has rules of use. By rules of use, it is meant that indexicals can tell when they are used, but not what they actually mean.\nExample: \"I\"\nWhom \"I\" refers to depends on the context and the person uttering it.\nAs mentioned, these meanings are brought about through the relationship between the signified and the signifier. One way to define the relationship is by placing signs in two categories: referential indexical signs, also called \"shifters\", and pure indexical signs.\nReferential indexical signs are signs where the meaning shifts depending on the context, hence the nickname \"shifters\". \"I\" would be considered a referential indexical sign. The referential aspect of its meaning would be 'first-person singular' while the indexical aspect would be the person who is speaking (refer above for definitions of semantic-referential and indexical meaning). Another example would be:\n\"This\"\nReferential: singular count\nIndexical: close by\nA pure indexical sign does not contribute to the meaning of the propositions at all. It is an example of a \"non-referential use of language.\"\nA second way to define the signified and signifier relationship is C.S. Peirce's Peircean Trichotomy. The components of the trichotomy are the following:\n1. Icon: the signified resembles the signifier (signified: a dog's barking noise, signifier: bow-wow)\n2. Index: the signified and signifier are linked by proximity or the signifier has meaning only because it is pointing to the signified\n3. Symbol: the signified and signifier are arbitrarily linked (signified: a cat, signifier: the word cat)\nThese relationships allow signs to be used to convey intended meaning. If two people were in a room and one of them wanted to refer to a characteristic of a chair in the room he would say \"this chair has four legs\" instead of \"a chair has four legs.\" The former relies on context (indexical and referential meaning) by referring to a chair specifically in the room at that moment while the latter is independent of the context (semantico-referential meaning), meaning the concept chair.\nReferential expressions in conversation.\nReferring to things and people is a common feature of conversation, and conversants do so collaboratively. Individuals engaging in discourse utilize pragmatics. In addition, individuals within the scope of discourse cannot help but avoid intuitive use of certain utterances or word choices in an effort to create communicative success. The study of referential language is heavily focused upon definite descriptions and referent accessibility. Theories have been presented for why direct referent descriptions occur in discourse. (In layman's terms: why reiteration of certain names, places, or individuals involved or as a topic of the conversation at hand are repeated more than one would think necessary.) Four factors are widely accepted for the use of referent language including (i) competition with a possible referent, (ii) salience of the referent in the context of discussion (iii) an effort for unity of the parties involved, and finally, (iv) a blatant presence of distance from the last referent.\nReferential expressions are a form of anaphora. They are also a means of connecting past and present thoughts together to create context for information at hand. Analyzing the context of a sentence and determining whether or not the use of referent expression is necessary is highly reliant upon the author/speaker's digression- and is correlated strongly with the use of pragmatic competency.\nNonreferential uses of language.\nSilverstein's \"pure\" Indexes.\nMichael Silverstein has argued that \"nonreferential\" or \"pure\" indices do not contribute to an utterance's referential meaning but instead \"signal some particular value of one or more contextual variables.\" Although nonreferential indexes are devoid of semantico-referential meaning, they do encode \"pragmatic\" meaning.\nThe sorts of contexts that such indexes can mark are varied. Examples include:\nIn all of these cases, the semantico-referential meaning of the utterances is unchanged from that of the other possible (but often impermissible) forms, but the pragmatic meaning is vastly different.\nThe performative.\nJ. L. Austin introduced the concept of the performative, contrasted in his writing with \"constative\" (i.e. descriptive) utterances. According to Austin's original formulation, a performative is a type of utterance characterized by two distinctive features:\nExamples:\nTo be performative, an utterance must conform to various conditions involving what Austin calls felicity. These deal with things like appropriate context and the speaker's authority. For instance, when a couple has been arguing and the husband says to his wife that he accepts her apology even though she has offered nothing approaching an apology, his assertion is infelicitous: because she has made neither expression of regret nor request for forgiveness, there exists none to accept, and thus no act of accepting can possibly happen.\nFormalization.\nThere has been a great amount of discussion on the boundary between semantics and pragmatics and there are many different formalizations of aspects of pragmatics linked to context dependence. Particularly interesting cases are the discussions on the semantics of indexicals and the problem of referential descriptions, a topic developed after the theories of Keith Donnellan. A proper logical theory of formal pragmatics has been developed by Carlo Dalla Pozza, according to which it is possible to connect classical semantics (treating propositional contents as true or false) and intuitionistic semantics (dealing with illocutionary forces). The presentation of a formal treatment of pragmatics appears to be a development of the Fregean idea of assertion sign as formal sign of the act of assertion.\nRational Speech Act and Probabilistic Pragmatics.\nOver the past decade, many probabilistic and Bayesian methods have become very popular in the modelling of pragmatics, of which the most successful framework has been the Rational Speech Act framework developed by Noah Goodman and Michael C. Frank, which has already seen much use in the analysis of metaphor, hyperbole and politeness. In the Rational Speech Act, listeners and speakers both reason about the other's reasoning concerning the literal meaning of the utterances, and as such, the resulting interpretation depends, but is not necessarily determined by the literal truth conditional meaning of an utterance, and so it uses recursive reasoning to pursue a broadly Gricean co-operative ideal.\nIn the most basic form of the Rational Speech Act, there are three levels of inference; Beginning from the highest level, the pragmatic listener formula_1 will reason about the pragmatic speaker formula_2, and will then infer the likely world state formula_3 taking into account that formula_2 has deliberately chosen to produce utterance formula_5, while formula_2 chooses to produce utterance formula_5 by reasoning about how the literal listener formula_8 will understand the literal meaning of formula_5 and so will attempt to maximise the chances that formula_8 will correctly infer the world state formula_3. As such, a simple schema of the Rational Speech Act reasoning hierarchy can be formulated for use in a reference game such that:\nformula_12\nRecent work in Artificial Intelligence adds to the RSA framework explicit models (theories of mind (ToMs), formula_13 below) the listener and the speaker have of each other. The models are recursively nested (up to level formula_14) partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs), called Interactive POMDPs (IPOMDPs). They formalize how agents keep track of (maintain their beliefs about) the state of the world, about each other, and about each other's beliefs. Including the agents' capability to communicate leads to Communicative IPOMDPs (CIPOMDPs).\nUsing the above notation, the belief update of a CIPOMDP listener, given utterance formula_5, can be simplified as:\nformula_16\nExplicitly defining recursively nested theories of mind allows one to represent how listeners interpret messages they receive by modeling how speakers rationally decide what to communicate. Conversely, speakers decide on what to communicate by modeling the listener's belief update due to communication, and its effects on the speaker's utility formula_17. Unlike in classical RSA, in CIPOMDPs formula_17 is computed using the Bellman equation. Note that there is no need to assume the speaker is sincere/cooperative: The listener can discount what is communicated if it is in the speaker's interest to be insincere.\nRelated fields.\nThere is considerable overlap between pragmatics and sociolinguistics, since both share an interest in linguistic meaning as determined by usage in a speech community. However, sociolinguists tend to be more interested in variations in language within such communities. Influences of philosophy and politics are also present in the field of pragmatics, as the dynamics of societies and oppression are expressed through language.\nPragmatics helps anthropologists relate elements of language to broader social phenomena; it thus pervades the field of linguistic anthropology. Because pragmatics describes generally the forces in play for a given utterance, it includes the study of power, gender, race, identity, and their interactions with individual speech acts. For example, the study of code-switching directly relates to pragmatics, since a switch in code effects a shift in pragmatic force.\nAccording to Charles W. Morris, pragmatics tries to understand the relationship between signs and their users, while semantics tends to focus on the actual objects or ideas to which a word refers, and syntax (or \"syntactics\") examines relationships among signs or symbols. Semantics is the literal meaning of an idea whereas pragmatics is the implied meaning of the given idea.\nSpeech Act Theory, pioneered by J. L. Austin and further developed by John Searle, centers around the idea of the performative, a type of utterance that performs the very action it describes. Speech Act Theory's examination of illocutionary acts has many of the same goals as pragmatics, as outlined above.\nComputational pragmatics, as defined by Victoria Fromkin, concerns how humans can communicate their intentions to computers with as little ambiguity as possible. That process, integral to the science of natural language processing (seen as a sub-discipline of artificial intelligence), involves providing a computer system with some database of knowledge related to a topic and a series of algorithms, which control how the system responds to incoming data, using contextual knowledge to more accurately approximate natural human language and information processing abilities. Reference resolution, how a computer determines when two objects are different or not, is one of the most important tasks of computational pragmatics.\nIn literary theory.\nPragmatics (more specifically, Speech Act Theory's notion of the performative) underpins Judith Butler's theory of gender performativity. In \"Gender Trouble\", they claim that gender and sex are not natural categories, but socially constructed roles produced by \"reiterative acting.\"\nIn \"Excitable Speech\" they extend their theory of performativity to hate speech and censorship, arguing that censorship necessarily strengthens any discourse it tries to suppress and therefore, since the state has sole power to define hate speech legally, it is the state that makes hate speech performative.\nJacques Derrida remarked that some work done under pragmatics aligned well with the program he outlined in his book \"Of Grammatology\".\n\u00c9mile Benveniste argued that the pronouns \"I\" and \"you\" are fundamentally distinct from other pronouns because of their role in creating the subject.\nGilles Deleuze and F\u00e9lix Guattari discuss linguistic pragmatics in the fourth chapter of \"A Thousand Plateaus\" (\"November 20, 1923\u2014Postulates of Linguistics\"). They draw three conclusions from Austin: (1) A performative utterance does not communicate information about an act second-hand, but it is the act; (2) Every aspect of language (\"semantics, syntactics, or even phonematics\") functionally interacts with pragmatics; (3) There is no distinction between language and speech. This last conclusion attempts to refute Saussure's division between \"langue\" and \"parole\" and Chomsky's distinction between deep structure and surface structure simultaneously.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was one of the fathers of cinematic neorealism, but later moved towards luxurious, sweeping epics dealing with themes of beauty, decadence, death, and European history, especially the decay of the nobility and the bourgeoisie. Critic Jonathan Jones wrote that \u201cno one did as much to shape Italian cinema as Luchino Visconti.\u201d\nBorn into a Milanese noble family with close ties to the artistic world, Visconti began his career in France as an assistant director to Jean Renoir. His 1943 directorial debut, , was condemned by the Fascist regime for its unvarnished depictions of working-class characters, but is today renowned as a pioneering work of Italian cinema, generally regarded as the first neorealist film. During World War II, he served in the anti-fascist resistance, and afterwards was active in left-wing politics.\nVisconti's best-known films include \"Senso\" (1954) and \"The Leopard\" (1963), which are historical melodramas adapted from Italian literary classics, the gritty drama \"Rocco and His Brothers\" (1960), and his \"German Trilogy\" \u2013 \"The Damned\" (1969), \"Death in Venice\" (1971) and \"Ludwig\" (1973). He was also an accomplished director of operas and stage plays, both in Italy and abroad, and held a close association with La Scala in his hometown of Milan.\nVisconti received several notable accolades, including both the (for \"The Leopard\") and the Golden Lion (for 1965's \"Sandra\"), the latter out of five total nominations. He won the David di Donatello for Best Director twice and the Nastro d'Argento for Best Director four times, and was both an Oscar and BAFTA Award nominee. Six of Visconti's films are on the list of 100 Italian films to be saved. Many of his works are regarded as highly-influential to future generations of filmmakers, including Francis Ford Coppola and Martin Scorsese.\nEarly life.\nLuchino Visconti was born into a prominent noble family in Milan, one of seven children of Giuseppe Visconti di Modrone, Duke of Grazzano Visconti and Count of Lonate Pozzolo, and his wife Carla (\"n\u00e9e\" Erba, heiress to Erba Pharmaceuticals). He was formally known as Count \"don\" Luchino Visconti di Modrone, and his family is a branch of the Visconti of Milan where they ruled from 1277 to 1447, initially as lords, then as dukes.\nHe grew up in the Milanese family seat, the \"Palazzo Visconti di Modrone\" in Via Cerva, as well as on the family estate, \"Grazzano Visconti Castle\" near Vigolzone. He was baptized and raised in the Roman Catholic church. After his parents separated in the early 1920s, his mother moved with her younger children, including him, to her own house in Milan, as well as to her summer residence, Villa Erba in Cernobbio on Lake Como. The father, as chamberlain of King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy, also owned a villa in Rome that Luchino later inherited and lived in for decades.\nIn his early years, he was exposed to art, music and theatre: The \"Palazzo Visconti di Modrone\" in Milan, where he grew up, had its own small private theatre and the children participated in its performances. The family also had their own box in the La Scala opera house. Luchino studied cello with the Italian cellist and composer Lorenzo de Paolis (1890\u20131965) and met the composer Giacomo Puccini, the conductor Arturo Toscanini and the writer Gabriele D'Annunzio. Visconti found literature by reading Proust's \"In Search of Lost Time\", later a lifelong film project that he never realized. Before he started his film career, he was passionate about training racehorses in his own stable. He was engaged to Princess Irma of Windisch-Graetz, but this raised concerns with her father, Prince Hugo, and Visconti broke the engagement off in 1935.\nWartime resistance activity.\nDuring World War II, Visconti joined the Italian Communist Party, which he considered to be the only effective opponent of Italian Fascism. While he had, in his early years, been impressed by such aesthetic aspects of the solemn parades of the National Fascist Party as marching in columns in boots and uniform, he had now come to hate the Mussolini regime. He accused the bourgeoisie of treason to tyranny, and following the Badoglio Proclamation, began working with the Italian resistance. He supported the communists' partisan fight at the risk of death; his villa in Rome became a meeting place for oppositional artists.\nAfter the king's flight in the autumn of 1943 and the intervention of the Germans, he went into hiding in the mountains, at Settefrati, under the nom de guerre \"Alfredo Guidi\". Visconti helped English and American prisoners of war hide after they had escaped, and also gave shelter to partisans in his house in Rome, with the help of actress Mar\u00eda Denis.\nAfter the German occupation of Rome in April 1944, Visconti was arrested and detained by the anti-partisan Pietro Koch and sentenced to execution by firing squad. He was only saved from death by Denis' last-minute intervention. After the war, Visconti testified against Koch, who was himself convicted and executed.\nCareer.\nFilms.\nHe began his film-making career as a set dresser on Jean Renoir's \"Partie de campagne\" (1936) through the intercession of their common friend Coco Chanel. After a short tour of the United States, where he visited Hollywood, he returned to Italy to be Renoir's assistant again, this time for \"Tosca\" (1941), a production that was interrupted and later completed by German director Karl Koch.\nTogether with fellow members of the Milanese film journal \"Cinema -\" Gianni Puccini, Antonio Pietrangeli and Giuseppe De Santis - Visconti wrote the screenplay for his first film as director: (\"Obsession\", 1943), one of the first examples of neorealist (involving real locations and regular people) movies and an unofficial adaptation of the novel \"The Postman Always Rings Twice\". The premiere of took place at a film festival hosted by Vittorio Mussolini (son of Benito), who was the national arbiter for cinema and other arts, and the editor of \"Cinema\". Though prior to the premiere their working relationship was positive, upon viewing the film Vittorio stormed out of the theatre exclaiming: \"This is not Italy!\", according to the account of \"Cinema\" group contributor Aldo Scagnetti. The film was subsequently suppressed by the fascist regime, to the extent that the first public showing of the film in Rome only occurred in May 1945.\nIn 1948, he wrote and directed \"La terra trema\" (\"The Earth Trembles\"), based on the novel \"I Malavoglia\" by Giovanni Verga. \nVisconti continued working throughout the 1950s, but he veered away from the neorealist path with his 1954 film, \"Senso\", shot in colour. Based on the novella by Camillo Boito, it is set in Austrian-occupied Venice in 1866. In this film, Visconti combines realism and romanticism as a way to break away from neorealism. However, as one biographer notes, \"Visconti without neorealism is like Lang without expressionism and Eisenstein without formalism\". He describes the film as the \"most Viscontian\" of all Visconti's films. Visconti returned to neorealism once more with \"Rocco e i suoi fratelli\" (\"Rocco and His Brothers\", 1960), the story of Southern Italians who migrate to Milan hoping to find financial stability. In 1961, he was a member of the jury at the 2nd Moscow International Film Festival.\nTurning away from neo-realism, Visconti created an unmistakable visual language in his films from the 1960s onwards. Thanks to his unique blend of aristocratic and upper-class origins, communist political convictions and brilliant social analysis, he created masterpieces of film history in The Leopard (1963), The Damned (1969), Death in Venice (1971) and Ludwig (1972). \nThroughout the 1960s, Visconti's films became more personal. \"Il Gattopardo\" (\"The Leopard\", 1963) is based on Lampedusa's novel of the same name about the decline of the Sicilian aristocracy at the time of the Risorgimento, where the change of times becomes visible in two of the main characters: Don Fabrizio Corbera, Prince of Salina (Burt Lancaster) appears patriarchal but humane, while Don Calogero Sedara (Paolo Stoppa), a shrewd entrepreneur and social climber from the village, appears submissive, but foxy and brutal at the same time, a mafia-like type of the future. The tension arises from the marriage of their relatives of the next generation, combined with the fall of the old Bourbon rule and the rise of a united Italy. This film was distributed in America and Britain by Twentieth-Century Fox, which deleted important scenes. Visconti repudiated the Twentieth-Century Fox version.\nIt was not until \"The Damned\" (1969) that Visconti received a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. The film, one of Visconti's better-known works, concerns a German industrialist's family which begins to disintegrate during the Nazi consolidation of power in the 1930s. The film opened to widespread critical acclaim, but also faced controversy from rating boards for its sexual content, including depictions of homosexuality, pedophilia, rape, and incest. In the United States, the film was given an X rating. The avant-garde filmmaker Rainer Werner Fassbinder praised it as his favourite movie. Its decadence and lavish beauty are characteristic of Visconti's aesthetic \u2212 very visible also in the movie \"Death in Venice\" (1971) that adapted the daring novella \"Death in Venice\" published in 1912 by Thomas Mann.\nVisconti's final film was \"The Innocent\" (1976), in which he returns to his recurring interest in infidelity and betrayal.\nTheatre.\nVisconti was also a celebrated theatre and opera director. During the years 1946 to 1960, he directed many performances of the Rina Morelli-Paolo Stoppa Company with actor Vittorio Gassman as well as many celebrated productions of operas.\nVisconti's love of opera is evident in the 1954 \"Senso\", where the beginning of the film shows scenes from the fourth act of \"Il trovatore\", which were filmed at the Teatro La Fenice in Venice. Beginning when he directed a production at Milan's Teatro alla Scala of \"La vestale\" in December 1954, his career included a famous revival of \"La traviata\" at La Scala in 1955 with Maria Callas and an equally famous \"Anna Bolena\" (also at La Scala) in 1957 with Callas. A significant 1958 Royal Opera House (London) production of Verdi's five-act Italian version of \"Don Carlos\" (with Jon Vickers) followed, along with a \"Macbeth\" in Spoleto in 1958 and a famous black-and-white \"Il trovatore\" with scenery and costumes by Filippo Sanjust at the Royal Opera House in 1964. In 1966 Visconti's luscious \"Falstaff\" for the Vienna State Opera conducted by Leonard Bernstein was critically acclaimed. On the other hand, his austere 1969 \"Simon Boccanegra\" with the singers clothed in geometrical costumes provoked controversy.\nFilmmaking style and themes.\nIn the aftermath of World War II he became one of the founding fathers of the Italian neorealistic film movement that focused on challenging economic and conditions, and how it affected the psyche of the underclass. Visconti came from nobility, was highly educated and was never in financial lack. His films reflected that tension. In fact, Visconti said he felt he came from a world long ago, that of the previous (19th) century.\nIn the film \"The Leopard\", he addressed the decline of an old social order and the rise of \u201cmodern times\u201d. He did not see his opulent flashbacks as an escape into imaginary, lost worlds, but rather as the deciphering of signs. He wanted to put his finger on the signs of profound historical changes which would only become visible later. He searched world literature for relevant works to show the discrepancies between generations and their world views, as a task of realism in art. When he was accused of decadence, he recalled Thomas Mann and his way of creating art.\nPersonal life.\nIn later years, Visconti made no secret of his homosexuality, though he remained a devout Catholic throughout his life. \"I am a Catholic,\" he commented in 1971. \"I was born a Catholic, I was baptized a Catholic. I cannot change what I am, I cannot easily become a Protestant. My ideas may be unorthodox, but I am still a Catholic.\" While his first 3-year-relationship from 1936, with the photographer \nHorst P. Horst, remained discreet because of the prejudices of the time, he later showed up openly in the company of his lovers, among them the director and producer Franco Zeffirelli and the actor Udo Kier. His last lover was the Austrian actor Helmut Berger, who played Martin in Visconti's film \"The Damned\". Berger also appeared in Visconti's \"Ludwig\" in 1973 and \"Conversation Piece\" in 1974, along with Burt Lancaster. Zeffirelli also worked as part of the crew in production design, as assistant director, and other roles in a number of Visconti's films, operas, and theatrical productions. According to Visconti's autobiography, he and Umberto II of Italy had a romantic relationship during their youth in the 1920s.\nVisconti was hostile to the Protests of 1968 and didn't even try to follow the movement and adopt the airs of youth, like Alberto Moravia or Pier Paolo Pasolini did (although the latter was certainly not sympathetic towards the protestors). In his view, the protesters sought change for the sake of destruction without building something new. Disgusted, he regarded the young people in their enthusiasm, outbursts of anger, parties and tumults, abstract speeches, juggling with Mao, Marx, and Che Guevara as a symbol of reaction. The emerging radical-left terrorism in Italy frightened him and made him fear the rise of a new fascism.\nVisconti has a grandnephew, Uberto Pasolini, who is also a filmmaker. (Uberto, however, has no known relation to the aforementioned director, Pier Paolo Pasolini.)\nHealth issues and death.\nVisconti smoked 120 cigarettes a day. He suffered a serious stroke in 1972, but continued to smoke heavily. He died in Rome of another stroke at the age of sixty-nine on 17 March 1976. \nThe church funeral service for Visconti took place on March 19, 1976, in Sant'Ignazio di Loyola in Campo Marzio in Rome. In addition to the Visconti family, the Italian President Giovanni Leone and the actors Burt Lancaster, Claudia Cardinale, Laura Antonelli, Vittorio Gassman and Helmut Berger were present.\nThere is a museum dedicated to the director's work in Ischia where he had his summer residence \"La Colombaia\".\nReferences.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources"}

These were the Oppius, Palatium, Velia, Fagutal, Cermalus, Caelius, and Cispius. These are sometimes confused with the traditional seven hills.\nHistory.\nTradition holds that Romulus and Remus founded the original city on the Palatine Hill on 21 April 753 BC, and that the seven hills were first occupied by small settlements that were not grouped. The seven hills' denizens began to interact, which began to bond the groups. The city of Rome, thus, came into being as these separate settlements acted as a group, draining the marshy valleys between them and turning them into markets (\"fora\" in Latin). Later, in the early 4th century BC, the Servian Walls were constructed to protect the seven hills.\nIn modern Rome, five of the seven hills\u2014the Aventine, Caelian, Esquiline, Quirinal, and Viminal Hills\u2014are now the sites of monuments, buildings, and parks. The Capitoline Hill is the location of Rome's city hall, and the Palatine Hill is part of the main archaeological area.\nA smaller area was covered by the seven peaks associated with the festival of the Septimontium: the Cispian Hill (\"Cispius Mons\"), Oppian Hill (\"Oppius Mons\"), and Fagutal Hill (\"Fagutalis Mons\"), three spurs of the Esquiline Hill, along with the Palatium and Cermalus, the peaks of the Palatine Hill, the Velian Hill, a ridge joining the Palatine and Oppian Hills, and the Caelian Hill.\nOther cities with seven hills.\nSheffield, Istanbul, Lisbon, Providence and the Massachusetts cities of Worcester, Somerville, and Newton are also said to have been built on seven hills, following the example of Rome.\nIn the New Testament.\nIn the Book of Revelation, the Whore of Babylon sits on \"seven mountains\", often understood by Christians as the seven hills of Rome and a reference to the pagan Roman Empire. Protestants later associated them with the Catholic Church (as the Pope is patriarch of Rome).\nIn modern literature.\nIn a 2019 interview, novelist Lindsey Davis revealed her plan to set a series of books on the seven hills of Rome, now accomplished with the publication of \"A Capitol Death\", seventh in the Flavia Albia series which began with \"The Ides of April\", set on the Aventine Hill.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

D\u0105browa G\u00f3rnicza is one of the cities of the Katowice urban area (2.7\u00a0million people), and within the greater Katowice-Ostrava metropolitan area (5.2\u00a0million people).

From 1977\u20131984, the town of S\u0142awk\u00f3w was a district of D\u0105browa G\u00f3rnicza.\nEtymology.\nThe place name \"D\u0105browa\", is derived from the Polish word \"d\u0105b\" (oak), and denotes an \"oak grove\", as the territory of the original village is believed to have been covered by oak forests during the early days of its existence. From the 19th century, the settlement grew to be an important coal-mining center, and its name was supplemented by the adjective \"G\u00f3rnicza\" (which refers to mining) in 1919, to distinguish it from such towns, as D\u0105browa Tarnowska and D\u0105browa Bia\u0142ostocka.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nIn the first half of the 18th century, \"D\u0105browa\" was a small agricultural settlement belonging to the B\u0119dzin parish of the Krak\u00f3w Voivodeship in the Lesser Poland Province in the Kingdom of Poland. It was first mentioned on 25 July 1726, when the parish priest of Holy Trinity Church at B\u0119dzin noted a woman named Anna Lisowa from D\u0105browa. At the 1787 census of the Archdiocese of Krak\u00f3w, the settlement numbered 184 inhabitants.\nThe districts of D\u0105browa, which for centuries had comprised separate villages, are much older. Trzebieszowice was first mentioned in the 12th century; B\u0142\u0119d\u00f3w was mentioned by Bishop of Krak\u00f3w Iwo Odrow\u0105\u017c in the year 1220; Strzemieszyce and Ujejsce were mentioned in the 14th century; Go\u0142on\u00f3g in the 15th century; and Z\u0105bkowice was described by Polish historian Jan D\u0142ugosz in the 15th century.\nIndustrial growth.\nAfter the Third Partition of Poland (1795), D\u0105browa was annexed by Prussia and incorporated into its newly formed province of New Silesia. The Prussians discovered rich deposits of coal here and the first coal mine was established by Friedrich Wilhelm von Reden in 1796. In 1799, first detailed map of this area was created, on which a settlement called \"Stara D\u0105browa\" is presented. It was located along a road from Krak\u00f3w to Upper Silesia. The coal mine established by von Reden attracted workers, and a settlement was soon established around it.\nIn 1807, D\u0105browa was regained by Poles and included within the short-lived Polish Duchy of Warsaw. After the duchy's dissolution in 1815, it became part of Russian-controlled Congress Poland. In 1846, the \"Cieszkowski Coal Mine\" was opened, named after J\u00f3zef Cieszkowski. The \"Zinc Plant Konstanty\" operated as early as 1823, and the \"Huta Bankowa\" steel works, which is still in operation, was built in D\u0105browa G\u00f3rnicza in 1834.\nThe first primary school was opened in 1820, and first Roman Catholic church of St. Alexander was built in the 1870s.\nDuring the January Uprising, in February 1863, D\u0105browa was captured by Polish insurgents after their victory in the Battle of Sosnowiec nearby.\nIn 1909, the gmina of D\u0105browa G\u00f3rnicza was established by Tsarist authorities. Even though its population reached 30,000, the Russians were reluctant to grant D\u0105browa town charter, so it remained a village until 18 August 1916, when Austrian authorities, which during World War I occupied southern part of Congress Poland, agreed to establish the town. After the war, in 1918, Poland regained independence and control of the city. 15 local Polish boy scouts were killed in fights for Polish independence in 1914\u20131920. In the Second Polish Republic, D\u0105browa belonged to Kielce Voivodeship. According to the 1921 census, the town's population was 89.7% Polish, 9.8% Jewish and 0.2% French.\nWorld War II.\nIn September 1939, in the beginning of World War II, the city was invaded by Germany, and shortly afterwards the German \"Einsatzgruppe I\" operated in the city and committed various crimes against the Polish population. Also in September 1939, Wehrmacht troops carried out a massacre of 14 Polish boy scouts from nearby villages in the present-day district of Tucznawa. Poles from D\u0105browa G\u00f3rnicza were among the victims of massacres committed by the Germans in other places, including Sosnowiec on September 4, 1939 and Celiny on June 4, 1940. Under German occupation the city was annexed directly to Germany, and included within the Upper Silesia Province. At least 14 Polish policemen from D\u0105browa were murdered by the Russians in the large Katyn massacre in April\u2013May 1940. Further executions of Poles were carried out by the Germans during the war. Over 40 local Polish boy and girl scouts were killed by the Germans in various places, including the Auschwitz concentration camp and during the Warsaw Uprising of 1944, and over 60 local miners were also murdered in Auschwitz.\nIn October 1941, the occupiers expelled over 100 Poles, who were then sent to forced labour either to Germany or to various factories in the region, while their houses were handed over to German colonists as part of the \"Lebensraum\" policy. The Germans also operated the E513 and E543 forced labour subcamps of the Stalag VIII-B/344 prisoner-of-war camp at the local coal mine. More than 4,000 local Jews were enclosed in a ghetto, and later murdered in death camps. German occupation ended in 1945.\nRecent history.\nTogether with all of Zag\u0142\u0119bie D\u0105browskie, the city was transferred to Katowice Voivodeship after World War II, in 1945.\nIn 1968, the local church of Saint Mary of the Angels was visited by the Primate of Poland Stefan Wyszy\u0144ski and cardinal Karol Wojty\u0142a (future Pope John Paul II).\nThe 1970s saw the construction of the Katowice Steelworks, which is nowadays the biggest steel producing plant in Poland, after privatization owned by ArcelorMittal. In the 1970s the town expanded territorially and economically. In 1975 and 1977 the neighboring localities of Strzemieszyce Ma\u0142e, Strzemieszyce Wielkie, Z\u0105bkowice and others became suburbanized. The population of D\u0105browa G\u00f3rnicza reached its peak in 1982 with 152,373 inhabitants. In 1984, the neighboring settlements of Marianki and Ratanice were included within the city limits of D\u0105browa G\u00f3rnicza as new districts. From 1975 to 1998, it was administratively located in the Katowice Voivodeship.\nIn the 1990s, all local coal mines were closed, because of lack of coal. The oldest part of the town Reden still exists. In 1993, the neighboring settlement of Trzebies\u0142awice was also included within the city limits as a new district.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nTransport.\nRoad transport.\nThe road network of D\u0105browa G\u00f3rnicza comprises 396.2\u00a0km of public roads, with municipal roads accounting for approximately 67% (267\u00a0km) of the total.

{"id": "44831", "revid": "1313566621", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44831", "title": "Mortadella", "text": "Large Italian pork sausage\nMortadella () is a large made of finely hashed or ground cured pork, which incorporates at least 15% small cubes of pork fat (principally the hard fat from the neck of the pig). It is traditionally flavoured with peppercorns, but modern versions can also contain pistachios or, less commonly, myrtle berries. The sausage is then cooked.\nThe best-known version of mortadella is PGI.\nEtymology.\nThe origin of the name is debated. One theory derives the name from the Latin word ('mortar'), traditionally used in pounding the meat to produce the sausage. This theory, proposed by Giancarlo Susini, professor of ancient history in the University of Bologna, relies on two funerary steles kept in the Archaeological Civic Museum of Bologna, believed to pertain to the same monument, one showing a herd of piglets and the other a mortar and pestle.\nAnother theory, introduced by Ovidio Montalbani in the 17th century, derives the name from a Roman sausage flavoured with myrtle berries that Romans called or (myrtle sausage). Myrtle was in fact a popular spice before pepper became available to European markets.\nVarieties.\nOutside Italy.\nSome imitations of mortadella from around the world include \"parizer\", \"polony\", and \"devon\".\nBrazil.\nA famous mortadella sandwich is sold at the Municipal Market of S\u00e3o Paulo in the city of S\u00e3o Paulo.\nMiddle East and North Africa.\nIn several countries, such as Morocco, Algeria, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Palestine, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait, halal or kosher mortadella is sold, which is made from chicken, beef or turkey. The Siniora brand, a Palestinian brand established in Jerusalem in 1920, is the first in the region, a mortadella with sliced olives, pistachios or peppercorn. Lebanese is a brand that is sold around the world.\nPoland.\nIn Poland, slices are sometimes dipped in batter, fried and served with potatoes and salads as a quicker (and cheaper) alternative to traditional pork cutlets.\nRomania.\nIn Romania, a similar cold cut is also known as . In Hungary, a similar product is called and a plain variety called , or . The term is also often used in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia, while is used in other territories of the Balkans. It mainly differs from mortadella and similar salami in that garlic is used instead of myrtle and it does not contain pieces of fat, pistachios or olives.\nRussia and former Soviet Union.\nIn Russia and other former Soviet states, a very similar product is called (, lit.\u2009'doctor's sausage'). However, this product is usually made from a mixture of beef and pork (sometimes beef and lamb or chicken for religious reasons) and does not include pieces of fat or myrtle; mortadella-style sausages with bits of fat are called and . Instead, it is flavoured with just cardamom, sometimes coriander and nutmeg, and also traditionally contains eggs and milk, which are usually absent in traditional mortadella. Unlike mortadella, contains lower amounts of fat and is high in proteins.\nThe name \"doctor's sausage\" was coined in the Soviet Union in the 1930s to refer to sausages and meat products recommended by doctors to help with undernourishment and stomach problems. During the Soviet era, it was commonly advertised as being nutritious (due to its low-fat content) and remains popular throughout former Soviet states to the present day.\nUnited States.\nMortadella was banned from import into the United States from 1967 to 2000 due to an outbreak of African swine fever in Italy. The ban in the United States was lifted due to a veterinary equivalency agreement that allowed countries to export products that had been shown to be disease-free as part of an overall agreement that would allow products deemed safe in the United States to be exported to the European Union. The plot of the 1971 comedy film \"Lady Liberty\", starring Sophia Loren, is based on the United States ban on mortadella.\nIn the 2020s, mortadella experienced a surge of interest, with numerous restaurants in New York and Los Angeles featuring mortadella dishes.\nVietnam.\n or Vietnamese mortadella is sometimes used as an accompaniment to the Vietnamese dish .\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
