The town's roots date back to 1194. In the 21st century, it is the capital of Upper Franconia and has a population of 72,148 (2015). It hosts the annual Bayreuth Festival, at which performances of operas by the 19th-century German composer Richard Wagner are presented.\nHistory.\nMiddle Ages and Early Modern Period.\nThe town is believed to have been founded by the counts of Andechs probably around the mid-12th century, but was first mentioned in 1194 as \"Baierrute\" in a document by Bishop Otto II of Bamberg. The syllable \"-rute\" may mean \"Rodung\" or \"clearing\", whilst \"Baier-\" indicates immigrants from the Bavarian region.\nAlready documented earlier, were villages later merged into Bayreuth: Seulbitz (in 1035 as the royal Salian estate of Silewize in a document by Emperor Conrad II) and St. Johannis (possibly 1149 as \"Altentrebgast\"). Even the district of Altstadt (formerly Altenstadt) west of the town centre must be older than the town of Bayreuth itself. Even older traces of human presence were found in the hamlets of Meyernberg: pieces of pottery and wooden crockery were dated to the 9th century based on their decoration.\nWhile Bayreuth was previously (1199) referred to as a \"villa\" (\"village\"), the term \"civitas\" (\"town\") appeared for the first time in a document published in 1231. One can therefore assume that Bayreuth was awarded its town charter between 1200 and 1230. The town was ruled until 1248 by the counts of Andechs-Merania. After they died out in 1260 the burgraves of Nuremberg from the House of Hohenzollern took over the inheritance.\nAs early as 1361 Emperor Charles IV conferred on Burgrave Frederick V the right to mint coins for the towns of Bayreuth and Kulmbach.\nIn 1398 Bayreuth was partitioned from Nuremberg, becoming the Principality of Bayreuth (). Until 1604, however, the princely residence and the centre of the territory was the castle of Plassenburg in Kulmbach and as such the territory was officially known as the Principality of Kulmbach. The town of Bayreuth developed slowly and was affected time and again by disasters.\nBayreuth was first published on a map in 1421.\nIn February 1430, the Hussites devastated Bayreuth and the town hall and churches were razed. Matth\u00e4us Merian described this event in 1642 as follows: \"In 1430 the Hussites from Bohemia attacked / Culmbach and Barreut / and committed great acts of cruelty / like wild animals / against the common people / and certain individuals. / The priests / monks and nuns they either burnt at the stake / or took them onto the ice of lakes and rivers / (in Franconia and Bavaria) and doused them with cold water / and killed them in a deplorable way / as Boreck reported in the Bohemian Chronicle, page 450\".\nBy 1528, less than ten years after the start of the Reformation, the lords of the Frankish margrave territories switched to the Lutheran faith.\nIn 1605 a great fire, caused by negligence, destroyed 137 of the town's 251 houses. In 1620 plague broke out and, in 1621, there was another big fire in the town. The town also suffered during the Thirty Years' War.\nA turning point in the town's history came in 1603 when Margrave Christian, the son of the elector, John George of Brandenburg, moved the aristocratic residence from the castle of Plassenburg above Kulmbach to Bayreuth. The first Hohenzollern palace was built in 1440\u20131457 under Margrave John the Alchemist. It was the forerunner of today's Old Palace (\"Altes Schloss\") and was expanded and renovated many times. The development of the new capital stagnated due to the Thirty Years' War, but afterwards many baroque buildings were added to the town. After Christian's death in 1655 his grandson, Christian Ernest, followed him, ruling from 1661 until 1712. He was an educated and well-travelled man, whose tutor had been the statesman Joachim Friedrich von Blumenthal. He founded the Christian-Ernestinum Grammar School and, in 1683, participated in the liberation of Vienna which had been besieged by the Turks. To commemorate this feat, he had the Margrave Fountain built as a monument on which he is depicted as the victor of the Turks; it now stands outside the New Palace (\"Neues Schloss\"). During this time, the outer ring of the town wall and the castle chapel (\"Schlosskirche\") were built.\n18th century.\nChristian Ernest's successor, the Crown Prince and later Margrave, George William, began in 1701 to establish the then independent town of St Georgen am See (today, the district of St Georgen) with its castle, the so-called \"Ordensschloss\", a town hall, a prison and a small barracks. In 1705 he founded the Order of Sincerity (Ordre de la Sinc\u00e9rit\u00e9), which was renamed in 1734 to the Order of the Red Eagle and had the monastery church built, which was completed in 1711. In 1716 a princely porcelain factory was established in St. Georgen.\nThe first 'castle' in the park of the Hermitage was built at this time by Margrave George William (1715\u20131719).\nIn 1721, the town council acquired the palace of Baroness Sponheim (today's Old Town Hall or \"Altes Rathaus\") as a replacement for the town hall built in 1440 in the middle of the market place and destroyed by fire.\nIn 1735, a nursing home, the so-called Gravenreuth Stift, was founded by a private foundation in St. Georgen. The cost of the building exceeded the funds of the foundation, but Margrave Frederick came to their aid.\nBayreuth experienced its Golden Age during the reign (1735\u20131763) of Margrave Frederick and Margravine Wilhelmina of Bayreuth, the favourite sister of Frederick the Great. During this time, under the direction of court architects, Joseph Saint-Pierre and Carl von Gontard, numerous courtly buildings and attractions were created: the Margravial Opera House with its richly furnished baroque theatre (1744\u20131748), the New 'Castle' and Sun Temple (1749\u20131753) at the Hermitage, the New Palace with its courtyard garden (1754 ff) to replace the Old Palace which had burned down through the carelessness of the margrave, and the magnificent row of buildings in today's \"Friedrichstra\u00dfe\". There was even a unique version of the rococo architectural style, the so-called Bayreuth Rococo which characterised the aforementioned buildings, especially their interior design.\nThe old, sombre gatehouses were demolished because they impeded transport and were an outmoded form of defence. The walls were built over in places. Margrave Frederick successfully kept his principality out of the wars being waged by his brother-in-law, Frederick the Great, at this time, and, as a result, brought a time of peace to the Frankish kingdom.\n1742 saw the founding of the Frederick Academy, which became a university in 1743, but was moved that same year to Erlangen after serious riots because of the adverse reaction of the population. The university has remained there to the present today. From 1756 to 1763 there was also an Academy of Arts and Sciences.\nRoman Catholics were given the right to set up a prayer room and Jewish families settled here again. In 1760 the synagogue was opened and in 1787 the Jewish cemetery was dedicated.\nCountess Wilhelmina died in 1758, and although Margrave Frederick married again, the marriage was short-lived and without issue. After his death in 1763, many artists and craftsmen migrated to Berlin and Potsdam, to work for King Frederick the Great, because Frederick's successor, Margrave Frederick Christian had little understanding of art. He also lacked the means due to the elaborate lifestyle of his predecessor, because the buildings and the salaries of the mainly foreign artists had swallowed up a lot of money. For example, the court \u2013 which under George Frederick Charles had comprised around 140 people \u2013 had grown to about 600 employees by the end of the reign of Margrave Frederick. By 1769 the principality was close to bankruptcy.\nIn 1769, Margrave Charles Alexander, from the Ansbach line of Frankish Hohenzollerns, followed the childless Frederick Christian, and Bayreuth was reduced to a secondary residence. Charles Alexander continued to live in Ansbach and rarely came to Bayreuth.\nIn 1775, the Brandenburg Pond (\"Brandenburger Weiher\") in St.Georgen was drained.\nFollowing the abdication of the last Margrave, Charles Alexander, from the principalities of Ansbach and Bayreuth on 2 December 1791 its territories became part of a Prussian province. The Prussian Minister Karl August von Hardenberg took over its administration at the beginning of 1792.\nThe town centre still possesses the typical structure of a Bavarian street market: the settlement is grouped around a road widening into a square; the Town Hall was located in the middle. The church stood apart from it and on a small hill stood the castle. Some sixty years later the town (at that time a tiny village) became subordinate to the Hohenzollern state, and when this state was divided, Bayreuth ended up in the County of Kulmbach.\n19th century.\nIn 1804, the author Jean Paul Richter moved from Coburg to Bayreuth, where he lived until his death in 1825.\nThe rule of the Hohenzollerns over the Principality of Kulmbach-Bayreuth ended in 1806 after the defeat of Prussia by Napoleonic France. During the French occupation from 1806 to 1810 Bayreuth was treated as a province of the French Empire and had to pay high war contributions. It was placed under the administration of Comte Camille de Tournon, who wrote a detailed inventory of the former Principality of Bayreuth. On 30 June 1810 the French army handed over the former principality to what was now the Kingdom of Bavaria, which it had bought from Napoleon for 15 million francs. Bayreuth became the capital of the Bavarian district of Mainkreis, which later transferred into Obermainkreis and was finally renamed as the province of Upper Franconia.\nAs Bavaria was opened up by the railways, the main line from Nuremberg to Hof went past Bayreuth, running via Lichtenfels, Kulmbach and Neuenmarkt-Wirsberg to Hof. Bayreuth was first given a railway connection in 1853, when the Bayreuth\u2013Neuenmarkt-Wirsberg railway was built at the town's expense. It was followed in 1863 by the line to Weiden, in 1877 by the railway to Schnabelwaid, in 1896 by the branch line to Warmensteinach, in 1904 by the branch to Hollfeld and in 1909 by the branch via Thurnau to Kulmbach, known as the \"Thurnauer Bockala\" (which means something like \"Thurnau Goat\").\nOn 17 April 1870 Richard Wagner visited Bayreuth, because he had read about the Margrave Opera House, whose great stage seemed fitting for his works. However, the orchestra pit could not accommodate the large number of musicians required, for example, for the Ring of the Nibelung and the ambience of the auditorium seemed inappropriate for his piece. So, he toyed with the idea of building his own festival hall (the \"Festspielhaus\") in Bayreuth. The town supported him in this project and made a piece of land available to him, an undeveloped area outside the town between the railway station and Hohe Warte, the \"Gr\u00fcner H\u00fcgel\" (\"Green Hill\"). At the same time Wagner acquired a property at \"Hofgarten\" to build his own house, \"Wahnfried\". On 22 May 1872 the cornerstone for the Festival Hall was laid and, on 13 August 1876, it was officially opened (see Bayreuth Festival). Planning and construction were in the hands of the Leipzig architect, Otto Br\u00fcckwald, who had already made a name for himself in the building of theatres in Leipzig and Altenburg.\nIn 1886, the composer Franz Liszt died in Bayreuth while visiting his daughter Cosima Liszt, Wagner's widow. Both Liszt and Wagner are buried in Bayreuth; however, Wagner did not die there. Rather, he died in Venice in 1883, but his family had his body brought to Bayreuth for burial.\n20th century.\nTo the end of the Weimar Republic (1900\u20131933).\nThe new century also brought several innovations of modern technology: in 1892, the first electric street lights; in 1908 a municipal electricity station, and, in the same year, the first cinema.\nIn 1914\u201315, one section of the northern arm of the Red Main was straightened and widened after areas along the river had been flooded during a period of high water in 1909.\nAfter the First World War had ended in 1918, the Workers' and Soldiers' Council took power briefly in Bayreuth. On 17 February 1919, there was a three-day coup, the so-called \"Speckputsch\", a brief interlude of excitement in the otherwise rather staid town.\nIn a series of \"v\u00f6lkisch\" and nationalist \"Deutscher Tag\" (German Days), the NSDAP organised the event in Bayreuth on 30 September 1923. More than 3,300 military and civilian people gathered (equivalent to 15% of the inhabitants), although Minister of Defence Otto Gessler had forbidden the participation of units. Among the guests were mayor Albert Preu as well as Siegfried and Winifred Wagner, who invited keynote speaker Adolf Hitler to Wahnfried house. There he met writer Houston Stewart Chamberlain, son-in-law of Richard Wagner and anti-semitic race theorist. Also on that day, Hans Schemm met Hitler for the first time.\nIn 1932, the provinces of Upper and Middle Franconia were merged and Ansbach was chosen as the seat of government. As a small compensation, Bayreuth was given the merged state insurance agency for Upper and Middle Franconia. Unlike the provincial merger, the merger of those institutions was never reversed.\nNazi era (1933\u20131945).\nA stronghold of right-wing parties since the 1920s, Bayreuth became a center of Nazi ideology. In 1933, it was made capital of the Nazi Gau Bavarian Eastern March (\"Bayerische Ostmark\", in 1942 \"Gau Bayreuth\"). Nazi leaders often visited the Wagner festival and tried to turn Bayreuth into a Nazi model town. It was one of several places in which town planning was administered directly from Berlin, due to Hitler's special interest in the town and in the festival. Hitler loved the music of Richard Wagner, and he became a close friend of Winifred Wagner after she took over the festival. Hitler frequently attended Wagner performances in the Bayreuth Festival Hall.\nBayreuth was to have received a so-called \"Gauforum\", a combined government building and marching square built to symbolise the centre of power in the town. Bayreuth's first Gauleiter was Hans Schemm, who was also the head (\"Reichswalter\") of the National Socialist Teachers League, NSLB, which was located in Bayreuth. In 1937 the town was connected to the new \"Reichsautobahn\".\nUnder Nazi dictatorship the synagogue of the Jewish Community in \"M\u00fcnzgasse\" was desecrated and looted on Kristallnacht but, due to its proximity to the Opera House it was not razed. Inside the building, which is once again used by a Jewish community as a synagogue, a plaque next to the Torah ark recalls the persecution and murder of Jews in the Shoah, which took the lives of at least 145 Jews in Bayreuth.\nDuring the Second World War, a subcamp of the Flossenb\u00fcrg concentration camp was based in the town, in which prisoners had to participate in physical experiments for the V-2. Wieland Wagner, the grandson of the composer, Richard Wagner, was the deputy civilian director there in late 1944 and early April 1945. Shortly before the war's end branches of the People's Court (\"Volksgerichtshof\") were to have been set up in Bayreuth.\nOn 5, 8 and 11 April 1945 about one third of the town, including many public buildings and industrial installations were destroyed by heavy air strikes, along with 4,500 houses. 741 people were also killed. On 14 April, the U.S. Army occupied the town.\nPost-war era (1945\u20132000).\nAfter the war Bayreuth tried to part with its ill-fated past. It became part of the American Zone. The American military government set up a DP camp to accommodate displaced persons (DP), many of whom were Ukrainian. The camp was supervised by the UNRRA.\nThe housing situation was very difficult at first: there were about 53,300 inhabitants in the town, many more than before the war began. This increase was primarily due to the high number of refugees and expellees. Even in 1948 more than 11,000 refugees were counted. In addition, because many homes had been destroyed due to the war, thousands of people were living in temporary shelters, even the festival restaurant next to the Festival Hall housed some 500 people.\nIn 1945, 1,400 men were conscripted by the town council for \"essential work\" (clean-up work on damaged buildings and the clearing of roads). A significant number of historic buildings were demolished post-war but cultural life was soon back on track: in 1947 Mozart festival weeks were held in the Opera House, from which the Franconian Festival Weeks developed. In 1949 the Festival Hall was used for the first time again and there was a gala concert with the Vienna Philharmonic led by Hans Knappertsbusch. In 1951, the first post-war Richard Wagner Festival took place under the leadership of Wieland and Wolfgang Wagner. Wieland Wagner's fresh and non-traditional stagings \"restored credibility to a theater that had been totally ruined by Nazi ideology.\"\nIn 1949, Bayreuth became the seat of the government of Upper Franconia again.\nIn 1971, the Bavarian State Parliament decided to establish the University of Bayreuth and, on 3 November 1975, it opened for lectures and research. There are now about 10,000 students in the town.\nIn May 1972, a serious accident occurred at the folk festival in the town, when an overcrowded carriage derailed and several people were thrown out. Four died and five were injured, some seriously. At that time, it was the worst disaster on a roller coaster since the Second World War.\nIn 1979, US Army serviceman Roy Chung disappeared from the area and allegedly defected to North Korea via East Germany.\nIn 1999, the world gliding championship took place at Bayreuth municipal airport.\n21st century.\nIn 2006, Bayreuth chose its first CSU member and mayor, the lawyer, Michael Hohl, and, in 2007, a Youth Parliament, consisting of 12 young people, aged 14\u201317 years, was elected for the first time. The end of October saw the opening of the long-planned bus station and its associated office building on the newly created \"Hohenzollernplatz\".\nRichard Wagner and Bayreuth.\nThe town is best known for its association with the composer Richard Wagner, who lived in Bayreuth from 1872 until his death in 1883. Wagner's villa, \"Wahnfried\", was constructed in Bayreuth under the sponsorship of King Ludwig II of Bavaria and was converted after World War II into a Wagner Museum. In the northern part of Bayreuth is the Festival Hall, an opera house specially constructed for and exclusively devoted to the performance of Wagner's operas. The premieres of the final two works of Wagner's \"Ring Cycle\" (\"Siegfried\" and \"G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung\"); the cycle as a whole; and of \"Parsifal\" took place here.\nEvery summer, Wagner's operas are performed at the Festspielhaus during the month-long Richard Wagner Festival, commonly known as the Bayreuth Festival. The Festival draws thousands each year and has persistently been sold out since its inauguration in 1876. Currently, waiting lists for tickets can stretch for 10 years or more.\nOwing to Wagner's relationship with the then unknown philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, the first Bayreuth festival is cited as a key turning point in Nietzsche's philosophical development. Though at first an enthusiastic champion of Wagner's music, Nietzsche ultimately became hostile, viewing the festival and its revellers as symptom of cultural decay and bourgeois decadence \u2013 an event which led him to turn his eye upon the moral values esteemed by society as a whole \u2013 \"Nietzsche clearly preferred to see Bayreuth fail than succeed by mirroring a society gone wrong.\"\nGeography.\nLocation.\nBayreuth lies on the Red Main river, the southern of the two headstreams of the river Main, between the Fichtelgebirge Mountains and Franconian Switzerland. The town is also part of the Nuremberg Metropolitan Region.\nTown divisions.\nThe borough of Bayreuth is divided into 39 districts:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nClimate.\nClimate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round. The K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is \"Dfb\" (Humid continental climate) using the 0\u00a0\u00b0C isotherm and \"\" (Marine West Coast Climate/Oceanic climate) using the \u22123\u00a0\u00b0C isotherm.\nPolitics.\nThe current Member of the German Bundestag for Bayreuth is Silke Launert from the Christian Social Union in Bavaria.\nTown council.\nThe results of the 2020 local elections in Bavaria were as follows (in brackets the change from the 2014 elections):\nSponsorship.\nIn 1955 Bayreuth took on sponsorship for displaced Sudeten Germans from the town of Franzensbad in Okres Cheb.\nCoat of arms.\nMargrave Albert Achilles, who was also Elector of Brandenburg, presented the town of Bayreuth in December 1457 with the coat of arms that it still bears today. Two fields show the black and white coat of arms of the Hohenzollerns. The black lion on gold with a red and white border was the municipal coat of arms of the burgraves of Nuremberg. Along the two diagonals are two \"Reuten\", small triangular shovels with a slightly bent shaft. They represent the ending \"-reuth\" in the town's name.\"\nCulture and places of interest.\nTheatre.\nThe Margravial Opera House was opened in 1748 and is one of the finest Baroque theatres in Europe. The UNESCO World Heritage Site is both a museum and the oldest working \"tableau\" in Bayreuth.\nThe Festival Hall dates to the 19th century and is now used solely for the Bayreuth Festival. Only works by Richard Wagner are performed.\nThe former \"Stadthalle\" (lit.: city hall) did not have its own ensemble but was regularly used by the \"Theater Hof\" as well as various travelling theatres. It has been under reconstruction since 2017 and is supposed to be re-opened under the new name \"Friedrichsforum\" in 2023.\nThe only two theatres with their own ensemble are the \"Studiob\u00fchne Bayreuth\" and amateur dramatic society, \"Brandenburg Kulturstadt\". The venues of the \"Studiob\u00fchne\" are the domicile of the theatre in the \"R\u00f6ntgenstra\u00dfe\", the artificial ruins of the Hermitage and the courtyard of piano manufacturer Steingraeber &amp; S\u00f6hne.\nPublic parks and cemeteries.\nIn the town centre is the Court Garden () of the New Palace. Near the Festival Hall is the Festival Park. On the southern edge of the town lie the Ecological-Botanical Garden of the University of Bayreuth. On the , east of the town centre, is the relatively small Miedel Garden.\nThe best known park in Bayreuth is that of the Eremitage (Hermitage) in the district of St. Johannis. With a total area of almost 50 hectares, it is the largest park in Bayreuth.\nBayreuth has been chosen to host the Bavarian Country Garden Show in 2016. For this reason another park called was built on the Main water meadows between the Volksfestplatz and the A9 motorway.\nThe oldest surviving cemetery is the Town Cemetery () with a large number of gravestones of famous people. On the southern edge of the town is the Southern Cemetery () and crematorium. The districts of St. Johannis and St. Georgen have their own cemeteries. On , in the east of the town, is a Jewish cemetery.\nSport.\nOver 60 clubs offer just under one hundred sports. The most successful club in the town presently is the Bayreuth Air Sports Community with its gliding team: in 2002 and 2015 the pilots won the Federal Gliding League, and they also won the IGC-World League in 2015. The street hockey team of the Hurricans Bayreuth have been German runners-up three times (1998/2004/2006) and champions five times (1996/1997/2001/2005/2007). The basketball team of Medi Bayreuth plays in the Basketball Bundesliga (division 1), the HaSpo Bayreuth handball team, the footballers of SpVgg Bayreuth and the volleyball players of BSV Bayreuth each play in their respective Bavarian League. The ice hockey team, EHC Bayreuth, plays in the DEL2, the second highest ice hockey league in Germany.\nBayreuth had its sporting heyday in the late 1980s and early 90s. The basketball team, Steiner Bayreuth, were twice German Cup winners (1987/1988 and 1988/1989) and in the 1988/1989 season they also won the German championship. The hockey team of Bayreuth's swimming club (SCC) was twice champions of Second Division South and also played for a year in the Hockey League. At the time that the table tennis team of Steiner Bayreuth was also first class (since 1983 2nd Division, in 1984/85, 1986/87 and 1987/88 1st Division, 1988 relegated and the team has played for many years in the 2nd Football Division. The table tennis players of the 1. Bayreuth FC played in the 1st Division from 1994 to 1997.\nIn 1999 the World Glider Championships took place in Bayreuth.\nEconomy and infrastructure.\nTransport.\nLong-distance roads.\nMotorways (\"Autobahnen\"):\nFederal roads (\"Bundesstra\u00dfen\"):\nRailways.\nFrom Bayreuth Central Station (\"Hauptbahnhof\") railway lines run north to Neuenmarkt-Wirsberg, and from there to Bamberg and over the Schiefe Ebene to Hof, east to Weidenberg, southeast to Weiden and south to Schnabelwaid with connections to Nuremberg on the Pegnitz Valley Railway. The lines around Bayreuth are all single-tracked and non-electrified.\nSince 23 May 1992 tilting Class 610 diesel multiple units have worked the Pegnitz Valley route. These were bought by the former Deutsche Bundesbahn specifically for the winding track.\nSince a 2006/2007 timetable change, Bayreuth has no longer been connected to the DB's long-distance network. However, the Franken-Sachsen-Express still provides a direct connection to Dresden (since December 2007, every two hours). This service is worked by Class 612 diesel multiple units. There are also Regional-Express links via Lichtenfels to Bamberg and W\u00fcrzburg, and via Lichtenfels and Kronach to Saalfeld.\nLocal public transport.\nThe town bus routes are operated by Bayreuth Transport and Public Baths (BVB) (). Sometimes private bus operators run services on behalf of the transport companies. The 15 routes (lines 301\u2013315) operate from Monday to Friday at 20 or 30-minute intervals; on Saturday and Sunday the interval is extended to 30 minutes. Late evening services (from about 20 to 12 pm during the week and to 1 am at weekends), on Sunday mornings a simplified network of six lines (lines 321\u2013326) runs buses at 30-minute intervals. Some lines then operate like an on-call taxi service. The network is star-shaped. Originally, the central station was at the market square in . Since 27 October 2007 the Central Bus Station (ZOH) has been at at the junction of on the . At this stop there are also bus stops for local buses to facilitate transfers.\nRegional rail is operated by the Omnibusverkehr Franken. From 1 January 2010 public transport from the town and district of Bayreuth was integrated into the Nuremberg Regional Transport Network ().\nCycling.\nIn most places there is a signed cycle path network. In the centre of Bayreuth itself, cycling is fairly straightforward due to the relatively flat topography, something which encourages the use bicycles as an everyday means of transport. Because of the proximity of the 600 kilometre long Main Cycleway, Bayreuth is also a destination for many tourist cycle routes. Because of the long service intervals of the Bayreuth town bus system and its long overnight pause, students use bicycles as their everyday mode of transport. Bicycles may be carried for a fee on DB Regio trains leaving Bayreuth and in the VGN's buses.\nAir transport.\nThe local airport supports Bayreuth's commercial aviation traffic, individual business travel, general aviation and air sports. There is no commercial service any more: In 2001, the service which used to operate three times a day from Frankfurt via Bayreuth to Hof, stopped service.\nThe airfield at Bindlacher Berg is also one of the most important bases for gliding in Germany. For example, the World Championships took place here in 1999. For the air sports community in Bayreuth, the airport is a departure point for glider flights taking part in the national Bundesliga competition league. The local gliding club also provides instruction in flying gliders and light aircraft. The nearest international airport is Nuremberg Airport, which is located south of Bayreuth.\nGarrison.\nFor centuries Bayreuth was also a garrison town for the Prussian Army, Royal Bavarian Army, , \"Wehrmacht\", US Army, German Army (\"Bundeswehr\") and the German Border Police (\"Bundesgrenzschutz\"). In the early 1990s, following the end of the Cold War the garrison tradition of the town came to an end when the \"Bundeswehr's\" Margrave Barracks (\"Markgrafenkaserne\") and the R\u00f6hrensee Barracks (\"R\u00f6hrenseekaserne\"), used by the US Army and the BGS (\"Grenzschutzabteilung S\u00fcd 3\"), were closed.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nBayreuth is twinned with:\nSince 1990, there is also a cultural partnership with the state of Burgenland, Austria, and a university partnership between the University of Bayreuth and the Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Examples include a 3-dimensional scale model of a building or the scale drawings of the elevations or plans of a building.\nIn such cases the scale is dimensionless and exact throughout the model or drawing.\nThe scale can be expressed in four ways: in words (a lexical scale), as a ratio, as a fraction and as a graphical (bar) scale. Thus on an architect's drawing one might read 'one centimeter to one meter', 1:100, 1/100, or . A bar scale would also normally appear on the drawing. Colon may also be substituted with a specific, slightly raised ratio symbol , ie. \"1&amp;ratio;100\".\nGeneral representation.\nGenerally, a representation may involve more than one scale at the same time. For example, a drawing showing a new road in elevation might use different horizontal and vertical scales. An elevation of a bridge might be annotated with arrows with a length proportional to a force loading, as in 1\u00a0cm to 1000\u00a0newtons: this is an example of a dimensional scale. A weather map at some scale may be annotated with wind arrows at a dimensional scale of 1\u00a0cm to 20\u00a0mph.\nIn maps.\nMap scales require careful discussion. A town plan may be constructed as an exact scale drawing, but for larger areas a map projection is necessary and no projection can represent the Earth's surface at a uniform scale. In general, the scale of a projection depends on position and direction. The variation of scale may be considerable in small scale maps which may cover the globe. In large scale maps of small areas, the variation of scale may be insignificant for most purposes, but it is always present. The scale of a map projection must be interpreted as a nominal scale. (The usage \"large\" and \"small\" in relation to map scales relates to their expressions as fractions. The fraction 1/10,000 used for a local map is much \"larger\" than the 1/100,000,000 used for a global map. There is no fixed dividing line between small and large scales.)\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A scale model is a representation or copy of an object that is larger or smaller than the actual size of the object being represented. Very often the scale model is smaller than the original and used as a guide to making the object in full size.\u2014\u200a\nMathematics.\nIn mathematics, the idea of geometric scaling can be generalized. The scale between two mathematical objects need not be a fixed ratio but may vary in some systematic way; this is part of mathematical projection, which generally defines a point by point relationship between two mathematical objects. (Generally, these may be mathematical sets and may not represent geometric objects.)\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It takes its name from the Milvian Bridge, an important route over the Tiber. Constantine won the battle and started on the path that led him to end the Tetrarchy and become the sole ruler of the Roman Empire. Maxentius drowned in the Tiber during the battle; his body was later taken from the river and decapitated, and his head was paraded through the streets of Rome on the day following the battle before being sent to Africa.\nAccording to Christian chroniclers Eusebius of Caesarea and Lactantius, the battle marked the beginning of Constantine's conversion to Christianity. Eusebius of Caesarea recounts that Constantine and his soldiers had a vision sent by the Christian God. This was interpreted as a promise of victory if the sign of the Chi Rho, the first two letters of Christ's name in Greek, was painted on the soldiers' shields. The Arch of Constantine, erected in celebration of the victory, certainly attributes Constantine's success to divine intervention; however, the monument does not display any overtly Christian symbolism.\nHistorical background.\nThe underlying causes of the battle were the rivalries inherent in Diocletian's Tetrarchy. After Diocletian stepped down on 1 May 305, his successors began to struggle for control of the Roman Empire almost immediately. Although Constantine was the son of the Western Emperor Constantius, the Tetrarchic ideology did not necessarily provide for hereditary succession. When Constantius died on 25 July 306, his father's troops proclaimed Constantine as Augustus in Eboracum (York). In Rome, the favorite was Maxentius, the son of Constantius' imperial colleague Maximian, who seized the title of emperor on 28 October 306. But whereas Constantine's claim was recognized by Galerius, ruler of the Eastern provinces and the senior emperor in the Empire, Maxentius was treated as a usurper. Galerius, however, recognized Constantine as holding only the lesser imperial rank of Caesar. Galerius ordered his co-Augustus, Severus, to put Maxentius down in early 307. Once Severus arrived in Italy, however, his army defected to Maxentius. Severus was captured, imprisoned, and executed. Galerius himself marched on Rome in the autumn, but failed to take the city. Constantine avoided conflict with both Maxentius and the Eastern emperors for most of this period.\nBy 312, however, Constantine and Maxentius were engaged in open hostility with one another, although they were brothers-in\u2011law through Constantine's marriage to Fausta, sister of Maxentius. In the spring of 312, Constantine gathered an army of around 40,000 soldiers (although the ancient historian Zosimus \"claimed, quite implausibly, that Constantine invaded Italy with 90,000 soldiers and 8,000 cavalry, and that Maxentius commanded an army of 170,000 soldiers and 18,000 cavalry, including 80,000 Italians and 40,000 Carthaginians\") and decided to oust Maxentius himself. He easily overran northern Italy, winning two major battles: the first near Turin, the second at Verona, where the praetorian prefect Ruricius Pompeianus, Maxentius' most senior general, was killed.\nVision of Constantine.\nIt is commonly understood that on the evening of 27 October with the armies preparing for battle, Constantine had a vision which led him to fight under the protection of the Christian God. Some details of that vision, however, differ between the sources reporting it.\nLactantius states that, on the night before the battle, Constantine was commanded in a dream to \"delineate the heavenly sign on the shields of his soldiers\" (\"On the Deaths of the Persecutors\" 44.5). He followed the commands of his dream and marked the shields with a sign \"denoting Christ\". Lactantius describes that sign as a \"staurogram\", or a Latin cross with its upper end rounded in a P-like fashion. There is no certain evidence that Constantine ever used that sign, as opposed to the better known Chi-Rho sign described by Eusebius.\nFrom Eusebius, two accounts of the battle survive. The first, shorter one in the \"Ecclesiastical History\" promotes the belief that the Christian God helped Constantine but does not mention any vision. In his later \"Life of Constantine\", Eusebius gives a detailed account of a vision and stresses that he had heard the story from the Emperor himself. According to this version, Constantine with his army was marching (Eusebius does not specify the actual location of the event, but it was clearly not in the camp at Rome), when he looked up to the sun and saw a cross of light above it, and with it the Greek words \" \u1f18\u03bd \u03a4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c4\u1ff3 \u039d\u03af\u03ba\u03b1\", \"En tout\u014di n\u00edka\", usually translated into Latin as \"in hoc signo vinces\". The literal meaning of the phrase in Greek is \"in this (sign), conquer\" while in Latin it's \"in this sign, you shall conquer\"; a more free translation would be \"Through this sign [you shall] conquer\". At first he was unsure of the meaning of the apparition, but in the following night he had a dream in which Christ explained to him that he should use the sign against his enemies. Eusebius then continues to describe the labarum, the military standard used by Constantine in his later wars against Licinius, showing the Chi-Rho sign.\nThe accounts of the two contemporary authors, though not entirely consistent, have been merged into a popular notion of Constantine seeing the Chi-Rho sign on the evening before the battle. Both authors agree that the sign was not widely understandable to denote Christ (although among the Christians, it was already being used in the catacombs along with other special symbols to mark and/or decorate Christian tombs). Its first imperial appearance is on a Constantinian silver coin from c. 317, which proves that Constantine did use the sign at that time, though not very prominently. He made more extensive use of the Chi-Rho and the Labarum later, during the conflict with Licinius.\nSome have considered the vision in a solar context (e.g. as a solar halo phenomenon called a sun dog), which may have preceded the Christian beliefs later expressed by Constantine. Coins of Constantine depicting him as the companion of a solar deity were minted as late as 313, the year following the battle. The solar deity Sol Invictus is often pictured with a nimbus or halo. Various emperors portrayed Sol Invictus on their official coinage, with a wide range of legends, only a few of which incorporated the epithet \"invictus\", such as the legend , claiming the Unconquered Sun as a companion to the emperor, used with particular frequency by Constantine. Constantine's official coinage continues to bear images of Sol until 325/6. A solidus of Constantine as well as a gold medallion from his reign depict the Emperor's bust in profile jugate with Sol Invictus, with the legend . The official cults of Sol Invictus and Sol Invictus Mithras were popular amongst the soldiers of the Roman Army. Statuettes of Sol Invictus, carried by the standard-bearers, appear in three places in reliefs on the Arch of Constantine. Constantine's triumphal arch was carefully positioned to align with the colossal statue of Sol by the Colosseum, so that Sol formed the dominant backdrop when seen from the direction of the main approach towards the arch.\nHowever, other historians have discounted Eusebius's later account of a vision entirely. John Julius Norwich argued that \"the vision of the Cross above the battlefield ... never occurred. Had it done so, it is unthinkable that there should not be a single reference to it in any of the contemporary histories until the \"Life of Constantine\"\", and that Eusebius's \"specific statement that 'the whole army ... witnessed the miracle'\" is implausible. On the other hand, Norwich did concede that shortly before the battle, Constantine must have undergone \"some profound spiritual experience\", and that Eusebius's story was likely not so much \"a deliberate falsehood\" as \"a possibly unconscious exaggeration\", with Constantine adding \"a gentle gloss\" to his recollections which the author then uncritically noted down or embellished.\nEvents of the battle.\nConstantine reached Rome at the end of October 312 approaching along the Via Flaminia. He camped at the location of Malborghetto near Prima Porta, where remains of a Constantinian monument, the Arch of Malborghetto, which was built in honour of the occasion, are still extant.\nIt was expected that Maxentius would remain within Rome and endure a siege; he had successfully employed this strategy twice before, during the invasions of Severus and Galerius. Indeed, Maxentius had organised the stockpiling of large amounts of food in the city in preparation for such an event. Surprisingly, he decided otherwise, choosing to meet Constantine in open battle. Ancient sources commenting on these events attribute this decision either to divine intervention (Lactantius and Eusebius, both of whom were Christians) or superstition (Zosimus, who was a pagan). They also note that the day of the battle was the same as the day of his accession (28 October), which was generally thought to be a good omen. Additionally, Maxentius is reported to have consulted the oracular Sibylline Books, which stated that \"on October 28 an enemy of the Romans would perish\". Maxentius interpreted this prophecy as being favourable to himself. Lactantius also reports that the populace supported Constantine with acclamations during circus games. Maxentius chose to make his stand in front of the Milvian Bridge, a stone bridge that carries the Via Flaminia road across the Tiber River into Rome (the bridge stands today at the same site, somewhat remodelled, named in Italian \"Ponte Milvio\" or sometimes \"Ponte Molle\", \"soft bridge\"). Holding it was essential if Maxentius was to keep his rival out of Rome, where the Senate would surely favour whoever held the city. As Maxentius had probably partially destroyed the bridge during his preparations for a siege, he had a wooden or pontoon bridge constructed to get his army across the river. The sources vary as to the nature of the bridge central to the events of the battle. Zosimus mentions it, vaguely, as being constructed in two parts connected by iron fastenings, while others indicate that it was a pontoon bridge; sources are also unclear as to whether the bridge was deliberately constructed as a collapsible trap for Constantine's forces or not.\nThe next day, the two armies clashed, and Constantine won a decisive victory. The dispositions of Maxentius may have been faulty as his troops seem to have been arrayed with the River Tiber too close to their rear, giving them little space to allow re-grouping in the event of their formations being forced to give ground. Already known as a skillful general, Constantine first launched his cavalry at the cavalry of Maxentius and broke them. Constantine's infantry then advanced; most of Maxentius's troops fought well but they began to be pushed back toward the Tiber. Maxentius then decided to order a retreat, intending to make another stand at Rome itself. However, there was only one escape route, via the bridge. Constantine's men inflicted heavy losses on the retreating army. Finally, the temporary bridge set up alongside the Milvian Bridge, over which many of the Maxentian troops were escaping, collapsed, and those stranded on the north bank of the Tiber were either taken prisoner or killed. Maxentius' Praetorian Guard, who had originally acclaimed him emperor, seem to have made a stubborn stand on the northern bank of the river; \"in despair of pardon they covered with their bodies the place which they had chosen for combat.\"\nMaxentius was among the dead, having drowned in the river while trying to swim across it in an attempt to escape or, alternatively, he is described as having been thrown by his horse into the river. Lactantius describes the death of Maxentius in the following manner: \"The bridge in his rear was broken down. At sight of that the battle grew hotter. The hand of the Lord prevailed, and the forces of Maxentius were routed. He fled towards the broken bridge; but the multitude pressing on him, he was driven headlong into the Tiber.\"\nAftermath.\nConstantine entered Rome on 29 October. He staged a grand arrival ceremony in the city (\"adventus)\", and was met with popular jubilation. Maxentius' body was fished out of the Tiber and decapitated. His head was paraded through the streets for all to see. After the ceremonies, Maxentius' head was sent to Carthage as proof of his downfall; Africa then offered no further resistance. The battle gave Constantine undisputed control of the western half of the Roman Empire. The descriptions of Constantine's entry into Rome omit mention of him ending his procession at the Temple of Capitoline Jupiter, where sacrifice was usually offered. Though often employed to show Constantine's Christian sensibilities, this silence cannot be taken as proof that Constantine was a Christian at this point. He chose to honour the Senatorial Curia with a visit, where he promised to restore its ancestral privileges and give it a secure role in his reformed government: there would be no revenge against Maxentius' supporters. Maxentius was condemned to \"damnatio memoriae\"; all his legislation was invalidated and Constantine usurped all of Maxentius' considerable building projects within Rome, including the Temple of Romulus and the Basilica of Maxentius. Maxentius' strongest supporters in the military were neutralized when the Praetorian Guard and Imperial Horse Guard (\"equites singulares\") were disbanded. Constantine is thought to have replaced the former imperial guards with a number of cavalry units termed the \"Scholae Palatinae\".\nSignificance.\nPaul K. Davis writes that, \"Constantine\u2019s victory gave him total control of the Western Roman Empire paving the way for Christianity to become the dominant religion for the Roman Empire and ultimately for Europe.\" The following year, 313, Constantine and Licinius issued the Edict of Milan, which made Christianity an officially recognised and tolerated religion in the Roman Empire.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nThe most important ancient sources for the battle are Lactantius, \"De mortibus persecutorum\" 44; Eusebius of Caesarea, \"Ecclesiastical History\" ix, 9 and \"Life of Constantine\" i, 28\u201331 (the vision) and i, 38 (the actual battle); Zosimus ii, 15\u201316; and the \"Panegyrici Latini\" of 313 (anonymous) and 321 (by Nazarius)."}

It is often an experiment that would be hard, impossible, or unethical to actually perform. It can also be an abstract hypothetical that is meant to test our intuitions about morality or other fundamental philosophical questions.\nHistory.\nThe ancient Greek , \"was the most ancient pattern of mathematical proof\", and existed before Euclidean mathematics, where the emphasis was on the conceptual, rather than on the experimental part of a thought experiment.\nJohann Witt-Hansen established that Hans Christian \u00d8rsted was the first to use the equivalent German term c.\u20091812. \u00d8rsted was also the first to use the equivalent term in 1820.\nBy 1883, Ernst Mach used in a different sense, to denote exclusively the imaginary conduct of a real experiment that would be subsequently performed as a real physical experiment by his students. Physical and mental experimentation could then be contrasted: Mach asked his students to provide him with explanations whenever the results from their subsequent, real, physical experiment differed from those of their prior, imaginary experiment.\nThe English term \"thought experiment\" was coined as a calque of , and it first appeared in the 1897 English translation of one of Mach's papers. Prior to its emergence, the activity of posing hypothetical questions that employed subjunctive reasoning had existed for a very long time for both scientists and philosophers. The irrealis moods are ways to categorize it or to speak about it. This helps explain the extremely wide and diverse range of the application of the term \"thought experiment\" once it had been introduced into English.\nGalileo's demonstration that falling objects must fall at the same rate regardless of their masses was a significant step forward in the history of modern science. This is widely thought to have been a straightforward physical demonstration, involving climbing up the Leaning Tower of Pisa and dropping two heavy weights off it, whereas in fact, it was a logical demonstration, using the thought experiment technique. The experiment is described by Galileo in his 1638 work Two New Sciences thus:\nSalviati: &lt;q&gt;If then we take two bodies whose natural speeds are different, it is clear that on uniting the two, the more rapid one will be partly retarded by the slower, and the slower will be somewhat hastened by the swifter. Do you not agree with me in this opinion?&lt;/q&gt;Simplicio: &lt;q&gt;You are unquestionably right.&lt;/q&gt;Salviati: &lt;q&gt;But if this is true, and if a large stone moves with a speed of, say, eight while a smaller moves with a speed of four, then when they are united, the system will move with a speed less than eight; but the two stones when tied together make a stone larger than that which before moved with a speed of eight. Hence the heavier body moves with less speed than the lighter; an effect which is contrary to your supposition. Thus you see how, from your assumption that the heavier body moves more rapidly than the lighter one, I infer that the heavier body moves more slowly.&lt;/q&gt;\nUses.\nThought experiments may be used to explore a hypothesis and the implementation of theories around it. They are also used in education, or for personal entertainment.\nExamples of thought experiments include Schr\u00f6dinger's cat, that was meant to attack the Copenhagen Interpretation of quantum mechanics by showing that its assumptions could lead to the seemingly absurd condition of a cat being simultaneously alive and dead, and Maxwell's demon, which attempts to demonstrate the ability of a hypothetical finite being to violate the 2nd law of thermodynamics.\nIt is a common element of science-fiction stories.\nThought experiments, which are well-structured, well-defined hypothetical questions that employ subjunctive reasoning (irrealis moods) \u2013 \"What might happen (or, what might have happened) if . . . \" \u2013 have been used to pose questions in philosophy at least since Greek antiquity, some pre-dating Socrates. In physics and other sciences many thought experiments date from the 19th and especially the 20th Century, but examples can be found at least as early as Galileo.\nIn thought experiments, we gain new information by rearranging or reorganizing empirical data in a new way and drawing new inferences from them, or by looking at these data from a different and unusual perspective. In Galileo's thought experiment, for example, the rearrangement of empirical experience consists of the original idea of combining bodies of different weights.\nThought experiments have been used in philosophy (especially ethics), physics, and other fields (such as cognitive psychology, history, political science, economics, social psychology, law, organizational studies, marketing, and epidemiology). In law, the synonym \"hypothetical\" is frequently used for such experiments.\nRegardless of their intended goal, all thought experiments display a patterned way of thinking that is designed to allow us to explain, predict, and control events in a better and more productive way.\nTheoretical consequences.\nIn terms of their theoretical consequences, thought experiments generally:\nPractical applications.\nThought experiments can produce some very important and different outlooks on previously unknown or unaccepted theories. However, they may make those theories themselves irrelevant, and could possibly create new problems that are just as difficult, or possibly more difficult to resolve.\nIn terms of their practical application, thought experiments are generally created to:\nFields.\nThought experiments have been used in a variety of fields, including philosophy, law, physics, and mathematics. In philosophy they have been used at least since classical antiquity, some pre-dating Socrates. In law, they were well known to Roman lawyers quoted in the Digest. In physics and other sciences, notable thought experiments date from the 19th and, especially, the 20th century; but examples can be found at least as early as Galileo.\nPhilosophy.\nIn philosophy, a thought experiment typically presents an imagined scenario with the intention of eliciting an intuitive or reasoned response about the way things are in the thought experiment. (Philosophers might also supplement their thought experiments with theoretical reasoning designed to support the desired intuitive response.) The scenario will typically be designed to target a particular philosophical notion, such as morality, or the nature of the mind or linguistic reference. The response to the imagined scenario is supposed to tell us about the nature of that notion in any scenario, real or imagined.\nFor example, a thought experiment might present a situation in which an agent intentionally kills an innocent for the benefit of others. Here, the relevant question is not whether the action is moral or not, but more broadly whether a moral theory is correct that says morality is determined solely by an action's consequences (See Consequentialism). John Searle imagines a man in a locked room who receives written sentences in Chinese, and returns written sentences in Chinese, according to a sophisticated instruction manual. Here, the relevant question is not whether or not the man understands Chinese, but more broadly, whether a functionalist theory of mind is correct.\nIt is generally hoped that there is universal agreement about the intuitions that a thought experiment elicits. (Hence, in assessing their own thought experiments, philosophers may appeal to \"what we should say,\" or some such locution.) A successful thought experiment will be one in which intuitions about it are widely shared. But often, philosophers differ in their intuitions about the scenario.\nOther philosophical uses of imagined scenarios arguably are thought experiments also. In one use of scenarios, philosophers might imagine persons in a particular situation (maybe ourselves), and ask what they would do.\nFor example, in the veil of ignorance, John Rawls asks us to imagine a group of persons in a situation where they know nothing about themselves, and are charged with devising a social or political organization. The use of the state of nature to imagine the origins of government, as by Thomas Hobbes and John Locke, may also be considered a thought experiment. S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard explored the possible ethical and religious implications of Abraham's binding of Isaac in \"Fear and Trembling\". Similarly, Friedrich Nietzsche, in \"On the Genealogy of Morals\", speculated about the historical development of Judeo-Christian morality, with the intent of questioning its legitimacy.\nAn early written thought experiment was Plato's allegory of the cave. Another historic thought experiment was Avicenna's \"Floating Man\" thought experiment in the 11th century. He asked his readers to imagine themselves suspended in the air isolated from all in order to demonstrate human self-awareness and self-consciousness, and the substantiality of the soul.\nScience.\nScientists tend to use thought experiments as imaginary, \"proxy\" experiments prior to a real, \"physical\" experiment (Ernst Mach always argued that these gedankenexperiments were \"a necessary precondition for physical experiment\"). In these cases, the result of the \"proxy\" experiment will often be so clear that there will be no need to conduct a physical experiment at all.\nScientists also use thought experiments when particular physical experiments are impossible to conduct (Carl Gustav Hempel labeled these sorts of experiment \"theoretical experiments-in-imagination\"), such as Einstein's thought experiment of chasing a light beam, leading to special relativity. This is a unique use of a scientific thought experiment, in that it was never carried out, but led to a successful theory, proven by other empirical means.\nProperties.\nFurther categorization of thought experiments can be attributed to specific properties.\nPossibility.\nIn many thought experiments, the scenario would be nomologically possible, or possible according to the laws of nature. John Searle's Chinese room is nomologically possible.\nSome thought experiments present scenarios that are not nomologically possible. In his Twin Earth thought experiment, Hilary Putnam asks us to imagine a scenario in which there is a substance with all of the observable properties of water (e.g., taste, color, boiling point), but is chemically different from water. It has been argued that this thought experiment is not nomologically possible, although it may be possible in some other sense, such as metaphysical possibility. It is debatable whether the nomological impossibility of a thought experiment renders intuitions about it moot.\nIn some cases, the hypothetical scenario might be considered metaphysically impossible, or impossible in any sense at all. David Chalmers says that we can imagine that there are zombies, or persons who are physically identical to us in every way but who lack consciousness. This is supposed to show that physicalism is false. However, some argue that zombies are inconceivable: we can no more imagine a zombie than we can imagine that 1+1=3. Others have claimed that the conceivability of a scenario may not entail its possibility.\nCausal reasoning.\nThe first characteristic pattern that thought experiments display is their orientation\nin time. They are either:\nThe second characteristic pattern is their movement in time in relation to \"the present\nmoment standpoint\" of the individual performing the experiment; namely, in terms of:\nRelation to real experiments.\nThe relation to real experiments can be quite complex, as can be seen again from an example going back to Albert Einstein. In 1935, with two coworkers, he published a paper on a newly created subject called later the EPR effect (EPR paradox). In this paper, starting from certain philosophical assumptions, on the basis of a rigorous analysis of a certain, complicated, but in the meantime assertedly realizable model, he came to the conclusion that \"quantum mechanics should be described as \"incomplete\"\". Niels Bohr asserted a refutation of Einstein's analysis immediately, and his view prevailed. After some decades, it was asserted that feasible experiments could prove the error of the EPR paper. These experiments tested the Bell inequalities published in 1964 in a purely theoretical paper. The above-mentioned EPR philosophical starting assumptions were considered to be falsified by the empirical fact (e.g. by the optical \"real experiments\" of Alain Aspect).\nThus \"thought experiments\" belong to a theoretical discipline, usually to theoretical physics, but often to theoretical philosophy. In any case, it must be distinguished from a real experiment, which belongs naturally to the experimental discipline and has \"the final decision on \"true\" or \"not true\"\", at least in physics.\nInteractivity.\nThought experiments can also be interactive where the author invites people into his thought process through providing alternative paths with alternative outcomes within the narrative, or through interaction with a programmed machine, like a computer program.\nThanks to the advent of the Internet, the digital space has lent itself as a new medium for a new kind of thought experiments. The philosophical work of Stefano Gualeni, for example, focuses on the use of virtual worlds to materialize thought experiments and to playfully negotiate philosophical ideas. His arguments were originally presented in his 2015 book \"Virtual Worlds as Philosophical Tools\".\nGualeni's argument is that the history of philosophy has, until recently, merely been the history of written thought, and digital media can complement and enrich the limited and almost exclusively linguistic approach to philosophical thought. He considers virtual worlds (like those interactively encountered in videogames) to be philosophically viable and advantageous. This is especially the case in thought experiments, when the recipients of a certain philosophical notion or perspective are expected to objectively test and evaluate different possible courses of action, or in cases where they are confronted with interrogatives concerning non-actual or non-human phenomenologies.\nExamples.\nHumanities.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPhysics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPhilosophy.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMathematics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nComputer science.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}

He is the sixth-longest serving Prime Minister in Japanese history.\nWidely seen as a maverick leader of the LDP upon his election to the position in 2001, Koizumi became known as a neoliberal economic reformer, focusing on reducing Japan's government debt and the privatisation of its postal service. In the 2005 election, Koizumi led the LDP to win one of the largest parliamentary majorities in modern Japanese history. Koizumi also attracted international attention through his deployment of the Japan Self-Defense Forces to Iraq, and through his visits to the Yasukuni Shrine that fueled diplomatic tensions with neighbouring China and South Korea. Koizumi resigned as prime minister in 2006.\nAlthough Koizumi maintained a low profile for several years after he left office, he returned to national attention in 2013 as an advocate for abandoning nuclear power in Japan, in the wake of the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, which contrasted with the pro-nuclear views espoused by the LDP governments both during and after Koizumi's term in office.\nEarly life.\nKoizumi is a third-generation politician of the Koizumi family. His father, Jun'ya Koizumi, was director general of the Japan Defense Agency and a member of the House of Representatives. His grandfather, Koizumi Matajir\u014d, called \"Tattoo Minister\" because of a large tattoo on his body, was Minister of Posts and Telecommunications under Prime Ministers Hamaguchi and Wakatsuki and an early advocate of postal privatization.\nBorn in Yokosuka, Kanagawa on 8 January 1942, Koizumi was educated at Yokosuka High School. He graduated with a Bachelor of Economics degree from Keio University. He attended University College London before returning to Japan in August 1969 upon the death of his father.\nHe stood for election to the lower house in December; however, he did not earn enough votes to win election as a Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) representative. In 1970, he was hired as a secretary to Takeo Fukuda, who was Minister of Finance at the time and was elected as prime minister in 1976.\nIn the general elections of December 1972, Koizumi was elected as a member of the Lower House for Kanagawa's 2nd district, a seat previously held by his father. He joined Fukuda's faction within the LDP. Since then, he has been re-elected ten times.\nMember of House of Representatives.\nKoizumi gained his first senior post in 1979 as Parliamentary Vice Minister of Finance, and his first ministerial post in 1988 as Minister of Health and Welfare under Prime Ministers Noboru Takeshita and S\u014dsuke Uno. He held cabinet posts again in 1992 (Minister of Posts and Telecommunications in the Miyazawa cabinet) and 1996\u20131998 (Minister of Health and Welfare in the Hashimoto cabinets).\nIn 1994, with the LDP in opposition, Koizumi became part of a new LDP faction, Shinseiki, made up of younger and more motivated parliamentarians led by Taku Yamasaki, Koichi Kato and Koizumi, a group popularly dubbed \"YKK\" after the zipper manufacturer YKK.\nAfter Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa resigned in 1994 and the LDP returned to power in a coalition government, Koizumi and Hosokawa teamed up with Shusei Tanaka of New Party Sakigake in a strategic dialogue across party lines regarding Japan becoming a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. Although this idea was not popular within the LDP and never came to fruition, Koizumi and Hosokawa maintained a close working relationship across party lines, with Hosokawa tacitly serving as Koizumi's personal envoy to China during times of strained Sino-Japanese relations.\nKoizumi competed for the presidency of the LDP in September 1995 and July 1998, but he gained little support losing decisively to Ryutaro Hashimoto and then Keiz\u014d Obuchi, both of whom had broader bases of support within the party. However, after Yamasaki and Kato were humiliated in a disastrous attempt to force a vote of no confidence against Prime Minister Yoshir\u014d Mori in 2000, Koizumi became the last remaining credible member of the YKK trio, which gave him leverage over the reform-minded wing of the party.\nOn 24 April 2001, Koizumi was elected president of the LDP. He was initially considered an outside candidate against Hashimoto, who was running for his second term as prime minister. However, in the first poll of prefectural party organizations, Koizumi won 87 to 11 percent; in the second vote of Diet members, Koizumi won 51 to 40 percent. He defeated Hashimoto by a final tally of 298 to 155 votes. He was made Prime Minister of Japan on 26 April, and his coalition secured 78 of 121 seats in the Upper House elections in July.\nPremiership (2001\u20132006).\nDomestic policy.\nWithin Japan, Koizumi pushed for new ways to revitalise the moribund economy, aiming to act against bad debts with commercial banks, privatize the postal savings system, and reorganize the factional structure of the LDP. He spoke of the need for a period of painful restructuring in order to improve the future. To design policy initiatives in 2001 he used the new Council on Economic and Fiscal Policy (Keizai Zaisei Seisaku Tanto Daijin) or CEFP. It issued an annual planning document, \"Basic Policies for Economic and Fiscal Management and Reform\". It planned a major reorganization of the central government, and shaped economic policy in cooperation with key cabinet members. To meet the challenge of economic stagnation CEFP took an integrated approach, a worldwide economic view, and, promoted greater transparency; its philosophy was neoliberal.\nIn the fall of 2002, Koizumi appointed Keio University economist and frequent television commentator Heiz\u014d Takenaka as Minister of State for Financial Services and head of the Financial Services Agency (FSA) to fix the country's banking crisis. Bad debts of banks were dramatically cut with the NPL ratio of major banks approaching half the level of 2001. The Japanese economy has been through a slow but steady recovery, and the stock market has dramatically rebounded. The GDP growth for 2004 was one of the highest among G7 nations, according to the International Monetary Fund and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Takenaka was appointed as a Postal Reform Minister in 2004 for the privatization of Japan Post, operator of the country's Postal Savings system.\nKoizumi moved the LDP away from its traditional rural agrarian base toward a more urban, neoliberal core, as Japan's population grew in major cities and declined in less populated areas, although under current purely geographical districting, rural votes in Japan are still many times more powerful than urban ones. In addition to the privatization of Japan Post (which many rural residents fear will reduce their access to basic services such as banking), Koizumi also slowed down the LDP's heavy subsidies for infrastructure and industrial development in rural areas. These tensions made Koizumi a controversial but popular figure within his own party and among the Japanese electorate. Considering both his neoliberal policies and his appeal to populist ideas, Koizumi's political ideology has been characterized \"as a populist version of neoliberalism (or as a variant of the populist right) rather than neoliberal populism.\"\nForeign policy.\nAlthough Koizumi's foreign policy was focused on closer relations with the United States and UN-centered diplomacy, which were adopted by all of his predecessors, he went further, supporting the US policies in the war on terrorism. He decided to deploy the Japan Self-Defense Forces to Iraq, which was the first Japanese military mission in an active foreign war zone since the end of World War II. Many Japanese commentators observed that favorable US-Japan relations were based on Koizumi's personal friendship with US President George W. Bush. White House officials described the first meeting between Koizumi and Bush at Camp David as \"incredibly warm\", with the two men playing catch with a baseball. Since leaving office, he has defended his decision to send Japanese troops to Iraq. Koizumi also took more assertive attitudes than his predecessors on the issues of North Korean abductions and nuclear development.\nSelf-Defense Forces policy.\nAlthough Koizumi did not initially campaign on the issue of defense reform, he approved the expansion of the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) and in October 2001 they were given greater scope to operate outside of the country. Some of these troops were dispatched to Iraq. Koizumi's government also introduced a bill to upgrade the Defense Agency to ministry status; finally, the Defense Agency became the Japanese Ministry of Defense on 9 January 2007.\nVisits to Yasukuni Shrine.\nKoizumi has often been noted for his controversial visits to the Yasukuni Shrine, starting on 13 August 2001. He visited the shrine six times as prime minister. Because the shrine honors Japan's war dead, which also include many convicted Japanese war criminals and 14 executed Class A war criminals, these visits drew strong condemnation and protests from both Japan's neighbours, mainly China and South Korea, and many Japanese citizens. China and South Korea's people hold bitter memories of Japanese invasion and occupation during the first half of the 20th century. China and South Korea refused to have their representatives meet Koizumi in Japan and their countries. There were no mutual visits between Chinese and Japanese leaders from October 2001, and between South Korean and Japanese leaders from June 2005. The standstill ended when the next prime minister Abe visited China and South Korea in October 2006.\nIn China, the visits contributed to widespread anti-Japanese riots, which were also accompanied by other more peaceful large anti-Japan demonstrations across East Asia. The president, ruling and opposition parties, and much of the media of South Korea openly condemned Koizumi's pilgrimages. Many Koreans applauded the president's speeches criticizing Japan, despite the South Korean President's low popularity. When asked about the reaction, Koizumi said the speeches were \"for the domestic (audience)\".\nAlthough Koizumi signed the shrine's visitor book as \"Junichiro Koizumi, the Prime Minister of Japan\", he claimed that his visits were as a private citizen and not an endorsement of any political stance. China and Korea considered this excuse insufficient. Several journals and news reports in Japan, such as one published by Kyodo News Agency on 15 August 2006, questioned Koizumi's statement of private purpose, as he unreservedly recorded his position on the shrine's guestbook as prime minister. He visited the shrine annually in fulfillment of a campaign pledge. Koizumi's last visit as prime minister was on 15 August 2006, fulfilling a campaign pledge to visit on the anniversary of Japan's surrender in World War II.\nEleven months after his resignation as prime minister, Koizumi revisited the shrine on 15 August 2007 to mark the 62nd anniversary of Japan's surrender in World War II. His 2007 visit attracted less attention from the media than his prior visits while he was in office.\nStatements on World War II.\nOn 15 August 2005, the sixtieth anniversary of the end of World War II, Koizumi publicly stated that \"I would like to express keen remorse and heartfelt apologies\" and vowed Japan would never again take \"the path to war\".\nPopularity.\nKoizumi was an extremely popular leader at certain points in his tenure. His outspoken nature and colourful past contributed to that, and his nicknames included \"Lionheart\" and \"Maverick\". During his time in office, the Japanese public referred to him as \"Jun-chan\" (the suffix \"chan\" in the Japanese language is used as a term of familiarity, typically between children, \"Jun\" is a contraction of Junichiro). In June 2001, he enjoyed an approval rating of 80 percent.\nIn January 2002, Koizumi fired his Foreign Minister Makiko Tanaka, replacing her with Yoriko Kawaguchi. Tanaka had enjoyed high public approval ratings. A few days before her dismissal, when she was filmed crying after a dispute with government officials, Koizumi generated controversy with his statement \"tears are women's ultimate weapons\". Following an economic slump and a series of LDP scandals that claimed the career of YKK member Koichi Kato, by April Koizumi's popularity rating had fallen 30 percentage points since his nomination as prime minister.\nKoizumi was re-elected in 2003 and his popularity surged as the economy recovered. His proposal to cut pension benefits as a move to fiscal reform turned out to be highly unpopular. Two visits to North Korea to solve the issue of abducted Japanese nationals only somewhat raised his popularity, as he could not secure several abductees' returns to Japan. In the House of Councilors elections in 2004, the LDP performed only marginally better than the opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), winning 32 more seats than the latter obtained.\nIn 2005, the House of Councilors rejected the contentious postal privatization bills. Koizumi previously made it clear that he would dissolve the lower house if the bill failed to pass. The Democratic Party, while expressing support for the privatization, made a tactical vote against the bill. Fifty-one LDP members also either voted against the bills or abstained.\nOn 8 August 2005, Koizumi, as promised, dissolved the House of Representatives and called for snap elections. He expelled rebel LDP members for not supporting the bill. The LDP's chances for success were initially uncertain; the secretary general of New Komeito (a junior coalition partner with Koizumi's Liberal Democratic Party) said that his party would entertain forming a coalition government with the Democratic Party of Japan if the DPJ took a majority in the House of Representatives.\nKoizumi's popularity rose almost twenty points after he dissolved the House and expelled rebel LDP members. Opinion polls ranked the government's approval ratings between 58 and 65 percent. The electorate saw the election in terms of a vote for or against reform of the postal service, which the Democratic Party and rebel LDP members were seen as being against.\nThe September 2005 elections were the LDP's largest victory since 1986, giving the party a large majority in the House of Representatives and nullifying opposing voices in the House of Councilors. In the following Diet session, the last to be held under Koizumi's government, the LDP passed 82 of its 91 proposed bills, including postal privatization. A number of Koizumi-supported candidates known as \"Koizumi Children\" joined the Diet in this election and supported successive LDP governments until the 2009 elections, when most were defeated.\nRetirement.\nKoizumi announced that he would step down from office in 2006, per LDP rules, and would not personally choose a successor as many LDP prime ministers have in the past. On 20 September 2006, Shinzo Abe was elected to succeed Koizumi as president of the LDP. Abe succeeded Koizumi as prime minister on 26 September 2006.\nKoizumi remained in the Diet through the administrations of Abe and Yasuo Fukuda, but announced his retirement from politics on 25 September 2008, shortly following the election of Taro Aso as prime minister. He retained his Diet seat until the next general election, when his son Shinjiro was elected into the same seat representing the Kanagawa 11th district in 2009. Koizumi supported Yuriko Koike in the LDP leadership election held earlier in September 2008, but Koike placed a distant third.\nSince leaving office as prime minister, Koizumi has not granted a single request for an interview or television appearance, although he has given speeches and had private interactions with journalists.\nAnti-nuclear advocacy.\nKoizumi returned to the national spotlight in October 2013, after seven years of largely avoiding attention, when he gave a speech to business executives in Nagoya in which he stated: \"We should aim to be nuclear-free... If the Liberal Democratic Party were to adopt a zero-nuclear policy, then we'd see a groundswell of support for getting rid of nuclear energy.\" He recalled Japan's reconstruction in the wake of World War II and called for the country to \"unite toward a dream of achieving a society based on renewable energy.\"\nKoizumi had been a proponent of nuclear power throughout his term as prime minister, and was one of the first pro-nuclear politicians to change his stance on the issue in the wake of the Fukushima disaster of 2011. His dramatic remarks were widely covered in the Japanese media, with some tabloids speculating that he may break away from the LDP to form a new party with his son Shinjiro. Economy Minister Akira Amari characterized Koizumi's stance as pure but simplistic, while other LDP administration officials downplayed the potential impact of Koizumi's views. Former prime minister Naoto Kan, however, expressed hope that Koizumi's status as then-Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's \"boss\" would help put pressure on the government to minimize or eliminate nuclear power in Japan.\nKoizumi defended his change of stance, stating in November that \"it is overly optimistic and much more irresponsible to think nuclear power plants can be maintained just with the completion of disposal facilities... We had failed to secure sites for final disposal even before an accident occurred,\" concluding that \"it's better to spend money on developing natural energy resources\u2014citizens are more likely to agree with that idea\u2014than using such large amounts of expenses and energy to advance such a feckless project [as nuclear power].\" He explained that in August, he had visited a nuclear waste disposal facility in Finland, where he learned that nuclear waste would have to be sealed up for 100,000 years. A poll by the \"Asahi Shimbun\" in November 2013 found that 54% of the public supported Koizumi's anti-nuclear statements. Koizumi told one reporter that he felt lied to by the Federation of Electric Power Companies of Japan, which characterized nuclear power as a safe alternative to fossil fuels, stating that \"we certainly had no idea how difficult it is to control nuclear energy.\"\nKoizumi reportedly approached Morihiro Hosokawa, who served as prime minister in an anti-LDP coalition cabinet in the 1990s, to run for Governor of Tokyo in the February 2014 gubernatorial election on the platform of opposing the Abe government's pro-nuclear policy.\nHosokawa ran in the election with Koizumi's support, but lost to the LDP-supported candidate Y\u014dichi Masuzoe. Koizumi and Hosokawa continued their collaboration in the wake of this defeat, organizing an anti-nuclear forum to be held in May 2014.\nKoizumi traveled to the United States in 2016 in support of a lawsuit by Operation Tomodachi participants who claimed illness from radiation exposure caused by the Fukushima disaster.\nPersonal life.\nKoizumi lives in Yokosuka, Kanagawa.\nFamily.\nKoizumi married 21-year-old university student Kayoko Miyamoto in 1978. The couple had been formally introduced to each other as potential spouses, a common practice known as \"omiai\". The wedding ceremony at the Tokyo Prince Hotel was attended by about 2,500 people, including Takeo Fukuda (then Prime Minister), and featured a wedding cake shaped like the National Diet Building. The marriage ended in divorce in 1982, as Kayoko was reportedly unhappy with her married life for several reasons. After this divorce, Koizumi never married again, saying that divorce consumed ten times more energy than marriage.\nKoizumi had custody of two of his three sons: K\u014dtar\u014d Koizumi and Shinjir\u014d Koizumi, who were reared by one of his sisters. Shinjiro is the representative for Kanagawa's 11th district, a position his father has also filled, while Kotaro is an actor. The youngest son, Yoshinaga Miyamoto, now a graduate of Keio University, was born following the divorce and did not meet Koizumi for many years. Yoshinaga is known to have attended one of Koizumi's rallies, but was turned away from trying to meet his father. He was also turned away from attending his paternal grandmother's funeral. Koizumi's ex-wife Kayoko Miyamoto also asked unsuccessfully several times to meet their two eldest sons. Yoshinaga met his father and brothers for the first time in 2010, at a meeting arranged by Shinjiro. Koizumi and his two elder sons also attended Yoshinaga's wedding in 2013.\nKoizumi is known to have a cousin in Brazil, and was overwhelmed to the point of tears when he visited Brazil in 2004 and was met by a group of Japanese immigrants.\nInterests.\nKoizumi is a fan of German composer Richard Wagner and has released a CD of his favorite pieces by contemporary Italian composer Ennio Morricone. He is also a fan of the heavy metal band X Japan, with the LDP having even used their song \"Forever Love\" in television commercials in 2001. It was also reported that he was influential in getting the museum honoring X Japan's deceased guitarist Hide made.\nKoizumi is also a noted fan of Elvis Presley, with whom he shares a birthday (8 January). In 2001, he released a collection of his favorite Presley songs on CD, with his comments about each song. His brother is Senior Advisor of the Tokyo Elvis Presley Fan Club. Koizumi and his brother helped finance a statue of Presley in Tokyo's Harajuku district. On 30 June 2006, Koizumi visited Presley's estate, Graceland, accompanied by U.S. President George W. Bush, and First Lady Laura Bush. After arriving in Memphis aboard Air Force One, they headed to Graceland. While there, Koizumi briefly sang a few bars of his favourite Presley tunes, whilst warmly impersonating Presley, and wearing Presley's trademark oversized golden sunglasses.\nKoizumi is also a fan of Finnish composer Jean Sibelius. On 8 September 2006, he and Finnish Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen visited the Sibelius' home, where Koizumi showed respect to the late composer with a moment of silence. He owns reproductions of the manuscripts of all seven symphonies by Sibelius.\nIn 2009, Koizumi made a voice acting appearance in an Ultra Series feature film, \"\", playing the voice of Ultraman King. Koizumi said he took on the role at the urging of his son Shinjiro. His political career is parodied in a seinen manga, \"Mudazumo Naki Kaikaku\", which re-interprets his life as a mahjong master.\nHe has been compared many times to American actor Richard Gere, because of their similar hair style. In 2005, he used the latter as a boost for his falling popularity, by staging an \"impromptu ballroom dance performance\".\nKoizumi cabinets.\nNotes:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A hyperlink points to a whole document or to a specific element within a document. Hypertext is text with hyperlinks. The text that is linked from is known as anchor text. A software system that is used for viewing and creating hypertext is a \"hypertext system\", and to create a hyperlink is \"to hyperlink\" (or simply \"to link\"). A user following hyperlinks is said to \"navigate\" or \"browse\" the hypertext.\nThe document containing a hyperlink is known as its source document. For example, in content from Wikipedia or Google Search, many words and terms in the text are hyperlinked to definitions of those terms. Hyperlinks are often used to implement reference mechanisms such as tables of contents, footnotes, bibliographies, indexes, and glossaries.\nIn some hypertext, hyperlinks can be bidirectional: they can be followed in two directions, so both ends act as anchors and as targets. More complex arrangements exist, such as many-to-many links.\nThe effect of following a hyperlink may vary with the hypertext system and may sometimes depend on the link itself; for instance, on the World Wide Web most hyperlinks cause the target document to replace the document being displayed, but some are marked to cause the target document to open in a new window (or, perhaps, in a new tab). Another possibility is transclusion, for which the link target is a document fragment that replaces the link anchor within the source document. Not only persons browsing the document may follow hyperlinks. These hyperlinks may also be followed automatically by programs. A program that traverses the hypertext, following each hyperlink and gathering all the retrieved documents is known as a Web \"spider\" or crawler.\nLinks.\nInline links.\nAn inline link displays remote content without the need for embedding the content. The remote content may be accessed with or without the user following the link.\nAn inline link may display a modified version of the content; for instance, instead of an image, a thumbnail, low resolution preview, cropped section, or magnified section may be shown. The full content is then usually available on demand, as is the case with print publishing software\u00a0\u2013 e.g., with an external link. This allows for smaller file sizes and quicker response to changes when the full linked content is not needed, as is the case when rearranging a page layout.\nAnchor links.\nAn anchor hyperlink (anchor link) is a link bound to a portion of a document, which is often called a fragment. The fragment is generally a portion of text or a heading, though not necessarily. For instance, it may also be a \"hot area\" in an image (image map in HTML), a designated, often irregular part of an image.\nFragments are marked with \"anchors\" (in any of various ways), which is why a link to a fragment is called an anchor link (that is, a link to an anchor). For example, in XML, the element codice_1 provides anchoring capability (as long as the DTD or schema defines it), and in wiki markup, codice_2 is a typical example of implementing it. In word processor apps, anchors can be inserted where desired and may be called \"bookmarks\". In URLs, the hash character (#) precedes the name of the anchor for the fragment.\nOne way to define a hot area in an image is by a list of coordinates that indicate its boundaries. For example, a political map of Africa may have each country hyperlinked to further information about that country. A separate invisible hot area interface allows for swapping skins or labels within the linked hot areas without repetitive embedding of links in the various skin elements.\nText hyperlink. Hyperlink is embedded into a word or a phrase and makes this text clickable.\nImage hyperlink. Hyperlink is embedded into an image and makes this image clickable.\nBookmark hyperlink. Hyperlink is embedded into a text or an image and takes visitors to another part of a web page.\nE-mail hyperlink. Hyperlink is embedded into e-mail address and allows visitors to send an e-mail message to this e-mail address.\nFat links.\nA fat link (also known as a \"one-to-many\" link, an \"extended link\" or a \"multi-tailed link\") is a hyperlink which leads to multiple endpoints; the link is a set-valued function.\nUses in various technologies.\nHTML.\nTim Berners-Lee saw the possibility of using hyperlinks to link any information to any other information over the Internet. Hyperlinks were therefore integral to the creation of the World Wide Web. Web pages are written in the hypertext mark-up language HTML.\nThis is what a hyperlink to the home page of the W3C organization could look like in HTML code:\n&lt;a href=\"https://www.w3.org/\"&gt;W3C organization website&lt;/a&gt;\nThis HTML code consists of several tags:\nWebgraph is a graph, formed from web pages as vertices and hyperlinks, as directed edges.\nXLink.\nThe W3C recommendation called XLink describes hyperlinks that offer a far greater degree of functionality than those offered in HTML. These extended links can be \"multidirectional\", remove linking from, within, and between XML documents. It can also describe \"simple links\", which are unidirectional and therefore offer no more functionality than hyperlinks in HTML.\nPermalinks.\nPermalinks are URLs that are intended to remain unchanged for many years into the future, yielding hyperlinks that are less susceptible to link rot. Permalinks are often rendered simply, that is, as friendly URLs, so as to be easy for people to type and remember. Permalinks are used in order to point and redirect readers to the same Web page, blog post or any online digital media.\nThe scientific literature is a place where link persistence is crucial to the public knowledge. A 2013 study in BMC Bioinformatics analyzed 15,000 links in abstracts from Thomson Reuters' Web of Science citation index, founding that the median lifespan of Web pages was 9.3 years, and just 62% were archived. The median lifespan of a Web page constitutes high-degree variable, but its order of magnitude usually is of some months.\nFile based hyperlinks.\nInternet shortcut (.url) file.\nAn \"Internet shortcut\" file, also known as the URL file format, has the file extension .url (possibly hidden by default in the graphical user interface), and is the file format in Windows systems used for hyperlinks to the Internet.\nInternet shortcuts are text files, but their internal structure is similar to that of an INI file. Opening them in the graphical file browser of Windows or macOS (but not Linux) will open the link in the default web browser. Internet shortcut files can be easily made by hand, as the minimum features needed to operate as a hyperlink are simply the codice_8 header and the codice_9 key-value pair. Other key-value pairs are irregularly supported across operating systems. An example of a valid Windows Internet Shortcut with some specialized key-value pairs is shown below:\n[InternetShortcut]\nURL=https://www.wikipedia.org/\nWorkingDirectory=C:\\WINDOWS\nShowCommand=7\nIconIndex=1\nIconFile=C:\\WINDOWS\\SYSTEM\\url.dll\nModified=20F06BA06D07BD014D\nHotKey=1601\nmacOS .webloc file.\nOn macOS systems, the specialized file format for file based hyperlinks is the .webloc file. It uses XML Property list syntax:\n&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?&gt;\n&lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\"&gt;\n&lt;plist version=\"1.0\"&gt;\n&lt;dict&gt;\n &lt;key&gt;URL&lt;/key&gt;\n &lt;string&gt;https://www.wikipedia.org/&lt;/string&gt;\n&lt;/dict&gt;\n&lt;/plist&gt;\nLinux Freedesktop.org .desktop file.\nA file based hyperlink under Unix/Linux with a desktop environment is stored in a .desktop file. It is only supported under Linux. It is a text file with a syntax highly similar to the Windows codice_10 file described above. An example of a valid Freedesktop.org .desktop file is shown below:\n[Desktop Entry]\nEncoding=UTF-8\nType=Link\nName=Wikipedia\nURL=https://www.wikipedia.org/\nlink.html file.\nA Windows, macOS, and Linux cross-platform file based hyperlink can be implemented with an unofficial link.html style file:\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\nExample of a link.html file: i.e. a file based hyperlink that works cross-platform on Windows, macOS, and Linux. \n&lt;head&gt;\n &lt;meta http-equiv=\"refresh\" content=\"0; url=https://www.wikipedia.org\" /&gt;\n &lt;title&gt;Redirecting to https://www.wikipedia.org ...&lt;/title&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n Loading &lt;a href=\"https://www.wikipedia.org\"&gt;https://www.wikipedia.org&lt;/a&gt; ...\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\nHow hyperlinks work in HTML.\nA link from one domain to another is said to be \"outbound\" from its source anchor and \"inbound\" to its target.\nThe most common destination anchor is a URL used in the World Wide Web. This can refer to a document, e.g. a webpage, or other resource, or to a position in a webpage. The latter is achieved by means of an HTML element with a \"name\" or \"id\" attribute at that position of the HTML document. The URL of the position is the URL of the webpage with a fragment identifier\u00a0\u2013 \"#\"id attribute\"\u00a0\u2013 appended.\nWhen linking to PDF documents from an HTML page the \"id attribute\"\" can be replaced with syntax that references a page number or another element of the PDF, for example, \"#\"page=386\"\".\nLink behavior in web browsers.\nA web browser usually displays a hyperlink in some distinguishing way, e.g. in a different color, font or style, or with certain symbols following to visualize link target or document types. This is also called \"link decoration\". The behavior and style of links can be specified using the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) language.\nIn a graphical user interface, the appearance of a mouse cursor may change into a hand motif to indicate a link. In most graphical web browsers, links are displayed in underlined blue text when they have not been visited, but underlined purple text when they have. When the user activates the link (e.g., by clicking on it with the mouse) the browser displays the link's target. If the target is not an HTML file, depending on the file type and on the browser and its plugins, another program may be activated to open the file.\nThe HTML code contains some or all of the five main characteristics of a link:\nIt uses the HTML element \"a\" with the attribute \"href\" (HREF is an abbreviation for \"Hypertext REFerence\") and optionally also the attributes \"title\", \"target\", and \"class\" or \"id\":\n&lt;samp&gt;codice_11&lt;/samp&gt;\nTo embed a link into a web page, blogpost, or comment, it may take this form:\ncodice_12\nIn a typical web browser, this would display as the underlined word \"Example\" in blue, which when clicked would take the user to the example.com website. This contributes to a clean, easy to read text or document.\nBy default, browsers will usually display hyperlinks as such:\nWhen the cursor hovers over a link, depending on the browser and graphical user interface, some informative text about the link can be shown, popping up, not in a regular window, but in a special hover box, which disappears when the cursor is moved away (sometimes it disappears anyway after a few seconds, and reappears when the cursor is moved away and back). Mozilla Firefox, IE, Opera, and many other web browsers all show the URL. In addition, the URL is commonly shown in the status bar.\nNormally, a link opens in the current frame or window, but sites that use frames and multiple windows for navigation can add a special \"target\" attribute to specify where the link loads. If no window exists with that name, a new window is created with the ID, which can be used to refer to the window later in the browsing session.\nCreation of new windows is probably the most common use of the \"target\" attribute. To prevent accidental reuse of a window, the special window names \"_blank\" and \"_new\" are usually available, and always cause a new window to be created. It is especially common to see this type of link when one large website links to an external page. The intention in that case is to ensure that the person browsing is aware that there is no endorsement of the site being linked to by the site that was linked from. However, the attribute is sometimes overused and can sometimes cause many windows to be created even while browsing a single site.\nAnother special page name is \"_top\", which causes any frames in the current window to be cleared away so that browsing can continue in the full window.\nHistory.\nThe term \"link\" was coined in 1965 (or possibly 1964) by Ted Nelson at the start of Project Xanadu. Nelson had been inspired by \"As We May Think\", a popular 1945 essay by Vannevar Bush. In the essay, Bush described a microfilm-based machine (the Memex) in which one could link any two pages of information into a \"trail\" of related information, and then scroll back and forth among pages in a trail as if they were on a single microfilm reel.\nIn a series of books and articles published from 1964 through 1980, Nelson transposed Bush's concept of automated cross-referencing into the computer context, made it applicable to specific text strings rather than whole pages, generalized it from a local desk-sized machine to a theoretical proprietary worldwide computer network, and advocated the creation of such a network. Though Nelson's Xanadu Corporation was eventually funded by Autodesk in the 1980s, it never created this proprietary public-access network. Meanwhile, working independently, a team led by Douglas Engelbart (with Jeff Rulifson as chief programmer) was the first to implement the hyperlink concept for scrolling within a single document (1966), and soon after for connecting between paragraphs within separate documents (1968), with NLS. Ben Shneiderman working with graduate student Dan Ostroff designed and implemented the highlighted link in the HyperTIES system in 1983. HyperTIES was used to produce the world's first electronic journal, the July 1988 Communications of the ACM, which was cited as the source for the link concept in Tim Berners-Lee's Spring 1989 manifesto for the Web. In 1988, Ben Shneiderman and Greg Kearsley used HyperTIES to publish \"Hypertext Hands-On!\", the world's first electronic book.\nReleased in 1987 for the Apple Macintosh, the database program HyperCard allowed for hyperlinking between various pages within a document, as well as to other documents and separate applications on the same computer. In 1990, Windows Help, which was introduced with Microsoft Windows 3.0, had widespread use of hyperlinks to link different pages in a single help file together; in addition, it had a visually different kind of hyperlink that caused a popup help message to appear when clicked, usually to give definitions of terms introduced on the help page. The first widely used open protocol that included hyperlinks from any Internet site to any other Internet site was the Gopher protocol from 1991. It was soon eclipsed by HTML after the 1993 release of the Mosaic browser (which could handle Gopher links as well as HTML links). HTML's advantage was the ability to mix graphics, text, and hyperlinks, unlike Gopher, which just had menu-structured text and hyperlinks.\nLegal issues.\nWhile hyperlinking among webpages is an intrinsic feature of the web, some websites object to being linked by other websites; some have claimed that linking to them is not allowed without permission.\nContentious in particular are deep links, which do not point to a site's home page or other entry point designated by the site owner, but to content elsewhere, allowing the user to bypass the site's own designated flow, and \"inline links\", which incorporate the content in question into the pages of the linking site, making it seem part of the linking site's own content unless an explicit attribution is added.\nIn certain jurisdictions, it is or has been held that hyperlinks are not merely references or citations, but are devices for copying web pages. In the Netherlands, Karin Spaink was initially convicted in this way of copyright infringement by linking, although this ruling was overturned in 2003. The courts that advocate this view see the mere publication of a hyperlink that connects to illegal material to be an illegal act in itself, regardless of whether referencing illegal material is illegal. In 2004, Josephine Ho was acquitted of 'hyperlinks that corrupt traditional values' in Taiwan.\nIn 2000, British Telecom sued Prodigy, claiming that Prodigy infringed its patent (https://) on web hyperlinks. After litigation, a court found for Prodigy, ruling that British Telecom's patent did not cover web hyperlinks.\nIn United States \"jurisprudence\", there is a distinction between the mere act of linking to someone else's website, and linking to content that is illegal (e.g., gambling illegal in the US) or infringing (e.g., illegal MP3 copies). Several courts have found that merely linking to someone else's website, even if by bypassing commercial advertising, is not copyright or trademark infringement, regardless of how much someone else might object. Linking to illegal or infringing content can be sufficiently problematic to give rise to legal liability. Compare for a summary of the current status of US copyright law as to hyperlinking, see the discussion regarding the \"Arriba Soft\" and \"Perfect 10\" cases.\nSomewhat controversially, Vuestar Technologies has tried to enforce patents applied for by its owner, Ronald Neville Langford, around the world relating to search techniques using hyperlinked images to other websites or web pages.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was a \"genr\u014d\", or senior statesman who helped dictate policy during the Meiji era, and is the second-longest serving Japanese prime minister after Shinzo Abe, serving for a combined total of 7 years and 330 days.\nBorn in the Choshu Domain to a samurai family, Katsura participated in the Boshin War that led to the Meiji Restoration in 1868. He spent several years studying military science in Germany, and became a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Yamagata Aritomo. He distinguished himself in the First Sino-Japanese War, then served as governor-general of Taiwan and later as minister of war from 1898 to 1901, when he was appointed prime minister. Katsura's relatively stable tenure saw Japan's victory in the Russo-Japanese War before he was forced to resign in 1906 amid public outrage at the government's failure to secure an indemnity from Russia. He returned as premier in 1908, and showed authoritarian tendencies in the crackdown on the High Treason Incident of 1910, which saw the mass arrest of leftists and which was followed by the establishment of the Special Higher Police in 1911. After Emperor Meiji's death in 1912, Katsura became prime minister again, which triggered the Taisho Political Crisis. He resigned three months later after a vote of no confidence.\nEarly life.\nKatsura was born on 4 January 1848 in Hagi, Nagato Province (present-day Yamaguchi Prefecture) as the eldest son of horse guard Katsura Yoichiemon into a samurai family of the Ch\u014dsh\u016b Domain. As a youth, Katsura joined the movement against the Tokugawa shogunate and participated in the Boshin War that led to the Meiji Restoration in 1868.\nArmy career.\nThe new Meiji government considered that Katsura displayed great talent, and in 1870 sent him to Germany to study military science. He served as military attach\u00e9 at the Japanese embassy in Germany from 1875 to 1878 and again from 1884 to 1885. On his return to Japan, he was promoted to major general. He served in several key positions within the Imperial Japanese Army, and in 1886 was appointed Vice-Minister of War.\nDuring the First Sino-Japanese War (1894\u20131895) Katsura commanded the IJA 3rd Division under his mentor, Field Marshal Yamagata Aritomo. During the war, his division made a memorable march in the depth of winter from the north-east shore of the Yellow Sea to Haicheng, finally occupying Niuchwang, and effecting a junction with the IJA 2nd Army which had moved up the Liaodong Peninsula.\nPolitical career.\nAfter the war, he was elevated with the title of \"shishaku\" (viscount) under the \"kazoku\" peerage system. He was appointed 2nd Governor-General of Taiwan from 2 June 1896, to October 1896.\nIn successive cabinets from 1898 to 1901, he served as Minister of War.\nKatsura Tar\u014d served as the 11th, 13th and 15th prime minister of Japan. His position as the longest-serving prime minister of Japan (total length) was surpassed by Shinz\u014d Abe on 20 November 2019.\nFirst premiership (1901\u20131906).\nKatsura became prime minister for the first time on 2 June 1901, and he retained the office for four and a half years to 7 January 1906, which was then a record in Japan. Japan emerged as a major imperialist power in East Asia. In terms of foreign affairs, it was marked by the Anglo-Japanese Alliance of 1902 and victory over the Russian Empire in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904\u20131905. During his first premiership, the Taft\u2013Katsura agreement, accepting Japanese hegemony over Korea, was reached with the United States. Katsura received the Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George from King Edward VII of the United Kingdom and was elevated to the rank of marquess by Emperor Meiji.\nIn terms of domestic policy, Katsura was a strictly conservative politician who attempted to distance himself from the Imperial Diet and party politics. His political views mirrored that of former prime minister Yamagata Aritomo in that he viewed that his sole responsibility was to the Emperor. He vied for control of the government with the \"Rikken Seiy\u016bkai\", the majority party of the lower house, headed by his archrival, Marquess Saionji Kinmochi.\nIn January 1906, Katsura resigned the premiership to Saionji Kinmochi over the unpopular Treaty of Portsmouth (1905), ending the war between Japan and Russia. However, his resignation was part of a \"back door deal,\" brokered by Hara Takashi to alternate power between Saionji and Hara.\nOn 1 April 1906, he was awarded the Grand Cordon of the Supreme Order of the Chrysanthemum.\nSecond premiership (1908\u20131911).\nKatsura returned as prime minister from 14 July 1908, to 30 August 1911. His second premiership was noteworthy for the Japan\u2013Korea Annexation Treaty of 1910 to colonize Korea. He also promulgated the Factory Act in 1911, the first act for the purpose of labor protection in Japan.\nKatsura was increasingly unpopular during his second premiership over public perception that he was using his office to further both his personal fortune and the interests of the military \"(gunbatsu)\" over the welfare of the people. He also faced growing public dissatisfaction over the persistence of the \"hanbatsu\" domainal based politics.\nAfter his resignation, he became a \"k\u014dshaku\" (\u516c\u7235 = prince), Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal of Japan and one of the \"genr\u014d.\"\nThird premiership (1912\u20131913).\nKatsura's brief reappointment as prime minister third time from 21 December 1912, to 20 February 1913, sparked widespread riots in what became known as the Taisho Political Crisis. His appointment was viewed as a plot by the \"genr\u014d\" to overthrow the Meiji Constitution. However, rather than compromising, Katsura created his own political party, the \"Rikken D\u014dshikai\" (Constitutional Association of Allies) in an effort to establish his own support base after his third premiership. \nHowever, faced with a no-confidence motion, the first successful one in Japanese history, and the loss of the support of his backers, he was forced to resign in February 1913. He was succeeded by Yamamoto Gonnohy\u014de.\nDeath.\nKatsura died of stomach cancer eight months later on 10 October 1913, aged 65. His funeral was held at the temple of Z\u014dj\u014d-ji in Shiba, Tokyo and his grave is at the Sh\u014din Jinja, in Setagaya.\nHonors.\n\"From the corresponding article in the Japanese Wikipedia\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "49551", "revid": "41326554", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49551", "title": "Rugby School", "text": "Private school in Warwickshire, England\nRugby School is a private boarding school for pupils aged 13\u201318, located in the town of Rugby, Warwickshire in England.\nFounded in 1567 as a free grammar school for local boys, it is one of the oldest independent schools in Britain. Up to 1667, the school remained in comparative obscurity. Its re-establishment by Thomas Arnold during his time as Headmaster, from 1828 to 1841, was seen as the forerunner of the Victorian public school. It was one of nine schools investigated by the Clarendon Commission of 1864 and later regulated as one of the seven schools included in the Public Schools Act 1868. Originally a boys' school, it became fully co-educational in 1992.\nThe school's alumni \u2013 or \"Old Rugbeians\" \u2013 include a UK prime minister, a French prime minister, several bishops, poets, scientists, writers and soldiers.\nRugby School is the birthplace of rugby football.\nHistory.\nFoundation and early growth.\nRugby School was founded in 1567 as a provision in the will of Lawrence Sheriff, who had made his fortune supplying groceries to Queen Elizabeth I of England. In the last few months of his life, Sheriff had drawn up a will which stipulated that his fortune should be used to found almshouses and a free grammar school \"to serve chiefly for the children of Rugby and Brownsover... and next for such as be of other places hereunto adjoyneing.\". Shortly before his death, Sheriff added a codicil to his will reducing the amount of money he left to the school, possibly due to a family financial problem, but instead leaving his eight acre Conduit Close estate in Middlesex: At the time this seemed like a poor exchange, as the estate consisted of undeveloped farmland on the edge of London, however, in time this endowment made Rugby School a wealthy institution due to the subsequent development of the area and rise in land values. The area of what is now the Rugby Estate includes much of what is now Great Ormond Street, Lamb's Conduit Street and Rugby Street in the London district of Bloomsbury.\nUp to 1667, the school remained in comparative obscurity. Sheriff's endowment was not fully realized for some time, due to a challenge over the provisions of the will from the Howkins family, to whom Sheriff was related through his sister, Bridget. Its history during that trying period is characterised mainly by a series of lawsuits between the Howkins family, who tried to defeat the intentions of the testator, and the masters and trustees, who tried to carry them out. A final decision was handed down in 1667, confirming the findings of a commission in favour of the trust, and henceforth the school maintained a steady growth. Under the headmastership of Henry Holyoake (from 1688 to 1731) the school became more than simply a local concern, and began to take on national importance. By the end of the 17th century, there were pupils from every part of England attending the school.\nThe school was originally based in a wooden schoolhouse on Church Street opposite St Andrew's Church, which incorporated Lawrence Sheriff's former house. By the 1740s this building was in poor condition, and the school looked to relocate to new premises. In 1750, the school moved to its current location to the south of the town centre, when it purchased a former Manor House at the south of High Street; this became the Master's house, a new schoolhouse was built alongside. The current school buildings date from the 19th and early 20th centuries.\nHenry Ingles, who was Headmaster between 1794 and 1806, was known for his strict discipline and gained the nickname \"The Black Tiger\". His time as Headmaster is most notable for the 'Great Rebellion' of 1797: It started when Ingles heard one of the boys shoot a cork gun, and the boy told him that Mr Rowell, a grocer, had supplied the gunpowder. Mr Rowell denied this, and as a result the boy Astley was flogged by Ingles, the boys retaliated by smashing Mr Rowell's windows and Ingles insisted that the boys pay for the damage. This provoked a full-scale riot, in which the boys blew off doors, smashed windows and burned furniture and books. As the other Masters were away, Ingles called on help from the townsfolk. A party of recruiting soldiers and some townsfolk advanced on the rioters, who retreated onto a moated island in the school grounds. The Riot Act was read out by a local justice of the peace, calling on the boys to surrender, and while this caused a distraction a group of soldiers waded across the moat from the rear and took the boys prisoner.\nVictorian period.\nRugby School's most famous headmaster was Thomas Arnold, from 1828 to 1841, whose emphasis on moral and religious principle, was widely admired and was seen as the blueprint for Victorian public schools. Arnold's period as headmaster is immortalised in Thomas Hughes's 1857 novel \"Tom Brown's School Days\". In the Victorian period, Rugby School saw several further Headmasters of some distinction, these included Frederick Temple (1858\u20131869) who would later become the Archbishop of Canterbury, John Percival (1887\u20131895) after whom the Percival Guildhouse is named, and Herbert Armitage James (1895\u20131910)\nIn 1845, a committee of Rugby schoolboys, William Delafield Arnold, W. W. Shirley and Frederick Hutchins, wrote the \"Laws of Football as Played At Rugby School\", the first published set of laws for any code of football.\nRugby was one of the nine prestigious schools investigated by the Clarendon Commission of 1861\u201364 (the schools under scrutiny being Eton, Charterhouse, Harrow, Shrewsbury, Westminster, and Winchester, and two day schools: St Paul's and Merchant Taylors). Rugby went on to be included in the Public Schools Act 1868, which ultimately related only to the seven boarding schools.\nFrom the early days of the school the pupils were divided into \"Foundationers\" i.e. boys who lived in Rugby and surrounding villages who received free schooling, as per Sheriff's original bequest, and \"Non-Foundationers\", boys from outside the Rugby area who paid fees and were boarders. Non-Foundationers were admitted from the early history of the school as they helped to pay the bills. Gradually, as the school's reputation grew, fee-paying Non-Foundationers became dominant and local boys benefited less and less from Sheriff's original intentions. By the latter half of the 19th century it was considered no longer desirable to have local boys attending a prestigious public school and so a new school \u2013 Lawrence Sheriff Grammar School \u2013 was founded in 1878 in order to continue Sheriff's original bequest for a free school for local boys.\nOn several occasions in the late 19th century Rugby School was visited by the French educator Pierre de Coubertin, who would later cite the school as one of the main inspirations for his most notable achievement, the founding of the modern Olympic Games in 1896.\nModern history.\nIn 1975 two girls were admitted to the sixth form and the first girls' house opened three years later, followed by three more. In 1992 the school became fully co-educational when the first 13-year-old girls arrived, and in 1995 Rugby had its first-ever Head Girl, Louise Woolcock, who appeared on the front page of \"The Times\". In September 2003 the last girls' house was added. Today, total enrolment of day pupils, from forms 4 to 12, numbers around 800. The BBCs https:// give a good view into life in the school.\nBranches overseas.\nIn 2017, Rugby School opened their first ever overseas franchise in Chonburi Province, Thailand, called Rugby School Thailand. In 2023, the school opened another branch in the city of Kashiwa, Chiba Prefecture, Japan, Rugby School Japan.\nRugby football.\nThe game of Rugby football owes its name to the school.\nThe legend of William Webb Ellis and the origin of the game is commemorated by a plaque on the school grounds. The story is that Webb Ellis was the first to pick up a football and run with it, and thus invent a new sport. However, the sole source of the story is Matthew Bloxam, a former pupil but not a contemporary of Webb Ellis. In October 1876, four years after the death of Webb Ellis, in a letter to the school newspaper \"The Meteor\" he quotes an unknown friend relating the story to him. He elaborated on the story four years later in another letter to \"The Meteor\", but shed no further light on its source. Richard Lindon, a boot and shoemaker who had premises across the street from the school's main entrance in Lawrence Sheriff Street, is credited with the invention of the \"oval\" rugby ball, the rubber inflatable bladder and the brass hand pump.\nThere were no standard rules for football in Webb Ellis's time at Rugby (1816\u20131825) and most varieties involved carrying the ball. The games played at Rugby were organised by the pupils and not the masters, the rules being a matter of custom and not written down. They were frequently changed and modified with each new intake of students.\nRugby fives.\nRugby fives is a handball game, similar to squash, played in an enclosed court. It has similarities with Winchester fives (a form of Wessex fives) and Eton fives.\nIt is most commonly believed to be derived from Wessex fives, a game played by Thomas Arnold, Headmaster of Rugby, who had played Wessex fives when a boy at Lord Weymouth's Grammar, now Warminster School. The open court of Wessex fives, built in 1787, is still in existence at Warminster School although it has fallen out of regular use.\nRugby fives is played between two players (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles), the aim being to hit the ball above a 'bar' across the front wall in such a way that the opposition cannot return it before a second bounce. The ball is slightly larger than a golf ball, leather-coated and hard. Players wear leather padded gloves on both hands, with which they hit the ball.\nRugby fives continues to have a good following with tournaments being run nationwide, presided over by the Rugby Fives Association.\nCricket.\nThe school has produced a number of cricketers who have gone onto play Test and first-class cricket. The school has played host to two major matches, the first of which was a Twenty20 match between Warwickshire and Glamorgan in the 2013 Friends Life t20. The second match was a List-A one-day match between Warwickshire and Sussex in the 2015 Royal London One-Day Cup, though it was due to host a match in the 2014 competition, however this was abandoned. In the 2015 match, William Porterfield scored a century, with a score of exactly 100. Warwickshire will return to Rugby School in 2024 to play three matches in the One-Day Cup.\nHouses.\nRugby School has both day and boarding-pupils, the latter in the majority. Originally it was for boys only, but girls have been admitted to the sixth form since 1975. It went fully co-educational in 1992. The school community is divided into houses.\nAcademic life.\nPupils beginning Rugby in the F Block (first year) study various subjects. In a pupil's second year (E block), they do nine subjects which are for their GCSEs, this is the same for the D Block (GCSE year). The school then provides standard A-levels in 29 subjects. Students at this stage have the choice of taking three or four subjects and are also offered the opportunity to take an extended project. The School also offers taking the IB Diploma Programme. Oxbridge acceptance percentage in 2007 was\u00a010.4%. In 2023, 68% of students that took A-levels at Rugby School scored A*/A while 83% of GCSE students scored 9/7.\nScholarships.\nThe Governing Body provides financial benefits with school fees to families unable to afford them. Parents of pupils who are given a Scholarship are capable of obtaining a 10% fee deduction, although more than one scholarship can be awarded to one student.\nNotable alumni.\nThere have been a number of notable , including the purported father of the sport of Rugby William Webb Ellis, the inventor of Australian rules football, Tom Wills, the war poets Rupert Brooke and John Gillespie Magee, Jr., Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, author and mathematician Lewis Carroll, poet and cultural critic Matthew Arnold, the author and social critic Salman Rushdie (who said of his time there: \"Almost the only thing I am proud of about going to Rugby school was that Lewis Carroll went there too.\") and the Irish writer and republican Francis Stuart. The Indian concert pianist, music composer and singer Adnan Sami also studied at Rugby School. Matthew Arnold's father Thomas Arnold, was a headmaster of the school. Philip Henry Bahr (later Sir Philip Henry Manson-Bahr), a zoologist and medical doctor, World War I veteran, was President of both Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene and Medical Society of London, and vice-president of the British Ornithologists' Union. Richard Barrett Talbot Kelly joined the army in 1915, straight after leaving the school, earned a Military Cross during the First World War, and later returned to the school as Director of Art. The diplomat Sir Frank Kenyon Roberts was a pupil at Rugby in the 1920s.\nRugbeian Society.\nThe Rugbeian Society is for former pupils at the school. An Old Rugbeian is sometimes referred to as an OR.\nThe purposes of the society are to encourage and help Rugbeians in interacting with each other and to strengthen the ties between ORs and the school.\nIn 2010, the Rugbeians reached the semi-finals of the Public Schools' Old Boys' Sevens tournament, hosted by the Old Silhillians to celebrate the 450th anniversary of fellow Warwickshire public school, Solihull School.\nBuildings and architecture.\nThe buildings of Rugby School date from the 18th and 19th century with some early 20th-century additions. The oldest buildings are the Old Quad Buildings and the School House the oldest parts of which date from 1748, but were mostly built between 1809 and 1813, designed by Henry Hakewill, these are grade II* listed.\nMost of the current landmark buildings date from the Victorian era and were designed by William Butterfield: The most notable of these is the chapel, dating from 1872, which is topped by an octagonal tower tall, and is grade I listed. Butterfield's New Quad buildings are Grade II* listed and date from 1867 to 1885. The Grade II* War Memorial chapel, designed by Sir Charles Nicholson, dates to 1922. Nicholson was educated at the school from the late-1870s.\nThe \"Temple Speech Room\" on Barby Road was named after former Rugby headmaster, Frederick Temple, It was opened on 3 July 1909 by King Edward VII. Designed by Thomas Graham Jackson, it is grade II listed. The Macready Theatre is based in a prominent Victorian building on Lawrence Sheriff Street which was built as classrooms in 1885, in 1975 it was converted into a theatre, in 2018, it was opened to the general public.\nHead Masters.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThomas Arnold.\nRugby's most famous headmaster was Thomas Arnold, appointed in 1828; he executed many reforms to the school curriculum and administration. Arnold's and the school's reputations were immortalised through Thomas Hughes' book \"Tom Brown's School Days.\"\nDavid Newsome writes about the new educational methods employed by Arnold in his book, 'Godliness and Good Learning' (Cassell 1961). He calls the morality practised at Arnold's school muscular Christianity. Arnold had three principles: religious and moral principle, gentlemanly conduct and academic performance. George Mosse, former professor of history at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, lectured on Arnold's time at Rugby. According to Mosse, Thomas Arnold created an institution which fused religious and moral principles, gentlemanly conduct, and learning based on self-discipline. These morals were socially enforced through the \"Gospel of work\". The object of education was to produce \"the Christian gentleman\", a man with good outward appearance, playful but earnest, industrious, manly, honest, virginal pure, innocent, and responsible.\nJohn Percival.\nIn 1888 the appointment of Marie Bethell Beauclerc by Percival was the first appointment of a female teacher in an English boys' public school and the first time shorthand had been taught in any such school. The shorthand course was popular with one hundred boys in the classes.\nControversy.\nIn September 2005, the school was one of fifty independent schools operating independent school fee-fixing, in breach of the Competition Act, 1998. All of the schools involved were ordered to abandon this practice, pay a nominal penalty of \u00a310,000 each and to make ex-gratia payments totalling three million pounds into a trust designed to benefit pupils who attended the schools during the period in respect of which fee information had been shared.\nThe head of the Independent Schools Council declared that independent schools had always been exempt from anti-cartel rules applied to business, were following a long-established procedure in sharing the information with each other and that they were unaware of the change to the law (on which they had not been consulted). She wrote to John Vickers, the OFT director-general, stating \"They are not a group of businessmen meeting behind closed doors to fix the price of their products to the disadvantage of the consumer. They are schools that have quite openly continued to follow a long-established practice because they were unaware that the law had changed.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Together with Mikkeli, they are the two largest towns in the South Savo region and both are centres of the region's hospital districts. Savonlinna enclaves the municipality of Enonkoski.\nSavonlinna is internationally known for its medieval St. Olaf's Castle and the annual Savonlinna Opera Festival.\nHistory.\nThe city was founded in 1639, based on Olavinlinna castle (\"St. Olaf's Castle\"). The castle was founded by Erik Axelsson Tott in 1475 in an effort to protect Savo and to control the unstable border between the Kingdom of Sweden and its Russian adversary. During the Russo-Swedish War (1741\u20131743), the castle was captured by Field-Marshal Peter Lacy. It was held by Russia between 1743 and 1812, when it was granted back to Finland as a part of \"Old Finland\".\nIn 1973 the municipality of S\u00e4\u00e4minki was consolidated with Savonlinna. In the beginning of year 2009 the municipality of Savonranta and a land strip from Enonkoski between Savonlinna and Savonranta were consolidated with Savonlinna. In the beginning of the year 2013, the municipalities of Kerim\u00e4ki and Punkaharju were consolidated with Savonlinna.\nAttractions.\nThe most notable attraction in Savonlinna is the Olavinlinna castle, a 15th-century castle built on an island. Near the castle is also the Savonlinna regional museum. Some other attractions include the forest museum Lusto in the village of Punkaharju, and the Kerim\u00e4ki Church in the neighboring village of Kerim\u00e4ki, which is the largest wooden church in the world.\nSavonlinna hosts the famous annual Savonlinna Opera Festival, which was held first time in 1912. The operas are performed on a stage built inside the Olavinlinna castle. The city has also hosted the Mobile Phone Throwing World Championships since 2000.\nSports.\nThe ice hockey team of Savonlinna, SaPKo or Savonlinnan Pallokerho, is playing in the second tier Mestis.\nThe top-tier volleyball team Saimaa Volley plays some of its home matches in Savonlinna. The football team Savonlinnan Ty\u00f6v\u00e4en Palloseura (STPS), is playing in Kolmonen, the fourth tier.\nTransport.\nSavonlinna is located east of Mikkeli, west of Joensuu and south of Kuopio. It is also from the capital city of Helsinki by road, and some four hours away by train. Flights from Savonlinna Airport to Helsinki take 40\u201360 minutes.\nEducation.\nSouth-Eastern Finland University of Applied Sciences has a campus in Savonlinna, teaching healthcare as well as process technologies. Research and development facilities include laboratories for wood processing and electronics. University of Eastern Finland had a campus in Savonlinna, primarily for teacher education. The campus was shut down in 2018.\nThere are two high schools in Savonlinna. One of these high schools is specialized in art subjects, which when it started its operation in 1967 was the first specialized high school in Finland as well as in all of the Nordic countries.\nInternational relations.\nTwin towns \u2014 Sister cities.\nSavonlinna is twinned with:\nIn addition, there is non-governmental cooperation with the following cities:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

Batholiths are almost always made mostly of felsic or intermediate rock types, such as granite, quartz monzonite, or diorite (see also \"granite dome\").\nFormation.\nAlthough they may appear uniform, batholiths are in fact structures with complex histories and compositions. They are composed of multiple masses, or \"plutons\", bodies of igneous rock of irregular dimensions (typically at least several kilometers) that can be distinguished from adjacent igneous rock by some combination of criteria including age, composition, texture, or mappable structures. Individual plutons are solidified from magma that traveled toward the surface from a zone of partial melting near the base of the Earth's crust.\nTraditionally, these plutons have been considered to form by ascent of relatively buoyant magma in large masses called \"plutonic diapirs\". Because the diapirs are liquified and very hot, they tend to rise through the surrounding native country rock, pushing it aside and partially melting it. Most diapirs do not reach the surface to form volcanoes, but instead they slow down, cool, and usually solidify 5 to 30 kilometers underground as plutons (hence the use of the word \"pluton\"; in reference to the Roman god of the underworld Pluto). An alternate view is that plutons are formed by aggregation of smaller volumes of magma that ascend as dikes.\nA batholith is formed when many plutons converge to form a huge expanse of granitic rock. Some batholiths are mammoth, paralleling past and present subduction zones and other heat sources for hundreds of kilometers in continental crust. One such batholith is the Sierra Nevada Batholith, which is a continuous granitic formation that makes up much of the Sierra Nevada in California. An even larger batholith, the Coast Plutonic Complex, is found predominantly in the Coast Mountains of western Canada; it extends for 1,800 kilometers and reaches into southeastern Alaska.\nSurface expression and erosion.\nA batholith is an exposed area of (mostly) continuous plutonic rock that covers an area larger than 100 square kilometers (40 square miles). Areas smaller than 100 square kilometers are called \"stocks\". However, the majority of batholiths visible at the surface (via outcroppings) have areas far greater than 100 square kilometers. These areas are exposed to the surface through the process of erosion accelerated by continental uplift acting over many tens of millions to hundreds of millions of years. This process has removed several tens of square kilometers of overlying rock in many areas, exposing the once deeply buried batholiths.\nBatholiths exposed at the surface are subjected to huge pressure differences between their former location deep in the earth and their new location at or near the surface. As a result, their crystal structure expands slightly over time. This manifests itself by a form of mass wasting called exfoliation. This form of weathering causes convex and relatively thin sheets of rock to slough off the exposed surfaces of batholiths (a process accelerated by frost wedging). The result is fairly clean and rounded rock faces. A well-known result of this process is Half Dome in Yosemite Valley.\nExamples.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Scholars usually consider a \"castle\" to be the private fortified residence of a lord or noble. This is distinct from a mansion, palace, and villa, whose main purpose was exclusively for \"pleasance\" and are not primarily fortresses but may be fortified. Use of the term has varied over time and, sometimes, has also been applied to structures such as hill forts and 19th- and 20th-century homes built to resemble castles. Over the Middle Ages, when genuine castles were built, they took on a great many forms with many different features, although some, such as curtain walls, arrowslits, and portcullises, were commonplace.\nEuropean-style castles originated in the 9th\u00a0and 10th\u00a0centuries after the fall of the Carolingian Empire, which resulted in its territory being divided among individual lords and princes. These nobles built castles to control the area immediately surrounding them and they were both offensive and defensive structures: they provided a base from which raids could be launched as well as offering protection from enemies. Although their military origins are often emphasised in castle studies, the structures also served as centres of administration and symbols of power. Urban castles were used to control the local populace and important travel routes, and rural castles were often situated near features that were integral to life in the community, such as mills, fertile land, or a water source.\nMany northern European castles were originally built from earth and timber but had their defences replaced later by stone. Early castles often exploited natural defences, lacking features such as towers and arrowslits and relying on a central keep. In the late 12th\u00a0and early 13th\u00a0centuries, a scientific approach to castle defence emerged. This led to the proliferation of towers, with an emphasis on flanking fire. Many new castles were polygonal or relied on concentric defence\u00a0\u2013 several stages of defence within each other that could all function at the same time to maximise the castle's firepower. These changes in defence have been attributed to a mixture of castle technology from the Crusades, such as concentric fortification, and inspiration from earlier defences, such as Roman forts. Not all the elements of castle architecture were military in nature, so that devices such as moats evolved from their original purpose of defence into symbols of power. Some grand castles had long winding approaches intended to impress and dominate their landscape.\nAlthough gunpowder was introduced to Europe in the 14th\u00a0century, it did not significantly affect castle building until the 15th\u00a0century, when artillery became powerful enough to break through stone walls. While castles continued to be built well into the 16th\u00a0century, new techniques to deal with improved cannon fire made them uncomfortable and undesirable places to live. As a result, true castles went into a decline and were replaced by artillery star forts with no role in civil administration, and ch\u00e2teau or country houses that were indefensible. From the 18th\u00a0century onwards, there was a renewed interest in castles with the construction of mock castles, part of a Romantic revival of Gothic architecture, but they had no military purpose.\nDefinition.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"castle\" is derived from the Latin word \"castellum\", which is a diminutive of the word \"castrum\", meaning \"fortified place\". The Old English \"castel\", Occitan \"castel\" or \"chastel\", French \"ch\u00e2teau\", Spanish \"castillo\", Portuguese \"castelo\", Italian \"castello\", and a number of words in other languages also derive from \"castellum\". The word \"castle\" was introduced into English shortly before the Norman Conquest of 1066 to denote this type of building, which was then new to England.\nDefining characteristics.\nIn its simplest terms, the definition of a castle accepted amongst academics is \"a private fortified residence\". This contrasts with earlier fortifications, such as Anglo-Saxon burhs and walled cities such as Constantinople and Antioch in the Middle East; castles were not communal defences but were built and owned by the local feudal lords, either for themselves or for their monarch. Feudalism was the link between a lord and his vassal where, in return for military service and the expectation of loyalty, the lord would grant the vassal land. In the late 20th\u00a0century, there was a trend to refine the definition of a castle by including the criterion of feudal ownership, thus tying castles to the medieval period; however, this does not necessarily reflect the terminology used in the medieval period. During the First Crusade (1096\u20131099), the Frankish armies encountered walled settlements and forts that they indiscriminately referred to as castles, but which would not be considered as such under the modern definition.\nCastles served a range of purposes, the most important of which were military, administrative, and domestic. As well as defensive structures, castles were also offensive tools which could be used as a base of operations in enemy territory. Castles were established by Norman invaders of England for both defensive purposes and to pacify the country's inhabitants. As William the Conqueror advanced through England, he fortified key positions to secure the land he had taken. Between 1066 and 1087, he established 36\u00a0castles such as Warwick Castle, which he used to guard against rebellion in the English Midlands.\nTowards the end of the Middle Ages, castles tended to lose their military significance due to the advent of powerful cannons and permanent artillery fortifications; as a result, castles became more important as residences and statements of power. A castle could act as a stronghold and prison but was also a place where a knight or lord could entertain his peers. Over time the aesthetics of the design became more important, as the castle's appearance and size began to reflect the prestige and power of its occupant. Comfortable homes were often fashioned within their fortified walls. Although castles still provided protection from low levels of violence in later periods, eventually they were succeeded by country houses as high-status residences.\nTerminology.\n\"Castle\" is sometimes used as a catch-all term for all kinds of fortifications, and as a result has been misapplied in the technical sense. An example of this is Maiden Castle which, despite the name, is an Iron Age hill fort which had a very different origin and purpose.\nAlthough \"castle\" has not become a generic term for a manor house (like \"ch\u00e2teau\" in French and \"Schloss\" in German), many manor houses contain \"castle\" in their name while having few if any of the architectural characteristics, usually as their owners liked to maintain a link to the past and felt the term \"castle\" was a masculine expression of their power. In scholarship the castle, as defined above, is generally accepted as a coherent concept, originating in Europe and later spreading to parts of the Middle East, where they were introduced by European Crusaders. This coherent group shared a common origin, dealt with a particular mode of warfare, and exchanged influences.\nIn different areas of the world, analogous structures shared features of fortification and other defining characteristics associated with the concept of a castle, though they originated in different periods and circumstances and experienced differing evolutions and influences. For example, \"shiro\" in Japan, described as castles by historian Stephen Turnbull, underwent \"a completely different developmental history, were built in a completely different way and were designed to withstand attacks of a completely different nature\". While European castles built from the late 12th and early 13th\u00a0century onwards were generally stone, \"shiro\" were predominantly timber buildings into the 16th\u00a0century.\nBy the 16th century, when Japanese and European cultures met, fortification in Europe had moved beyond castles and relied on innovations such as the Italian \"trace italienne\" and star forts.\nCommon features.\nMotte.\nA motte was an earthen mound with a flat top. It was often artificial, although sometimes it incorporated a pre-existing feature of the landscape. The excavation of earth to make the mound left a ditch around the motte, called a moat (which could be either wet or dry). Although the motte is commonly associated with the bailey to form a motte-and-bailey castle, this was not always the case and there are instances where a motte existed on its own.\n\"Motte\" refers to the mound alone, but it was often surmounted by a fortified structure, such as a keep, and the flat top would be surrounded by a palisade. It was common for the motte to be reached over a flying bridge (a bridge over the ditch from the counterscarp of the ditch to the edge of the top of the mound), as shown in the Bayeux Tapestry's depiction of Ch\u00e2teau de Dinan. Sometimes a motte covered an older castle or hall, whose rooms became underground storage areas and prisons beneath a new keep.\nBailey and enceinte.\nA bailey, also called a ward, was a fortified enclosure. It was a common feature of castles, and most had at least one. The keep on top of the motte was the domicile of the lord in charge of the castle and a bastion of last defence, while the bailey was the home of the rest of the lord's household and gave them protection. The barracks for the garrison, stables, workshops, and storage facilities were often found in the bailey. Water was supplied by a well or cistern. Over time the focus of high status accommodation shifted from the keep to the bailey; this resulted in the creation of another bailey that separated the high status buildings\u00a0\u2013 such as the lord's chambers and the chapel\u00a0\u2013 from the everyday structures such as the workshops and barracks.\nFrom the late 12th\u00a0century there was a trend for knights to move out of the small houses they had previously occupied within the bailey to live in fortified houses in the countryside. Although often associated with the motte-and-bailey type of castle, baileys could also be found as independent defensive structures. These simple fortifications were called ringworks. The enceinte was the castle's main defensive enclosure, and the terms \"bailey\" and \"enceinte\" are linked. A castle could have several baileys but only one enceinte. Castles with no keep, which relied on their outer defences for protection, are sometimes called enceinte castles; these were the earliest form of castles, before the keep was introduced in the 10th\u00a0century.\nKeep.\nA keep was a great tower or other building that served as the main living quarters of the castle and usually the most strongly defended point of a castle before the introduction of concentric defence. \"Keep\" was not a term used in the medieval period\u00a0\u2013 the term was applied from the 16th\u00a0century onwards\u00a0\u2013 instead \"donjon\" was used to refer to great towers, or \"turris\" in Latin. In motte-and-bailey castles, the keep was on top of the motte. \"Dungeon\" is a corrupted form of \"donjon\" and means a dark, unwelcoming prison. Although often the strongest part of a castle and a last place of refuge if the outer defences fell, the keep was not left empty in case of attack but was used as a residence by the lord who owned the castle, or his guests or representatives.\nAt first, this was usual only in England, when after the Norman Conquest of 1066 the \"conquerors lived for a long time in a constant state of alert\"; elsewhere the lord's wife presided over a separate residence (\"domus\", \"aula\" or \"mansio\" in Latin) close to the keep, and the donjon was a barracks and headquarters. Gradually, the two functions merged into the same building, and the highest residential storeys had large windows; as a result for many structures, it is difficult to find an appropriate term. The massive internal spaces seen in many surviving donjons can be misleading; they would have been divided into several rooms by light partitions, as in a modern office building. Even in some large castles the great hall was separated only by a partition from the lord's chamber, his bedroom and to some extent his office.\nCurtain wall.\nCurtain walls were defensive walls enclosing a bailey. They had to be high enough to make scaling the walls with ladders difficult and thick enough to withstand bombardment from siege engines which, from the 15th\u00a0century onwards, included gunpowder artillery. A typical wall could be thick and tall, although sizes varied greatly between castles. To protect them from undermining, curtain walls were sometimes given a stone skirt around their bases. Walkways along the tops of the curtain walls allowed defenders to rain projectiles on enemies below, and battlements gave them further protection. Curtain walls were studded with towers to allow enfilading fire along the wall. Arrowslits in the walls did not become common in Europe until the 13th\u00a0century, for fear that they might compromise the wall's strength.\nGatehouse.\nThe entrance was often the weakest part in a circuit of defences. To overcome this, the gatehouse was developed, allowing those inside the castle to control the flow of traffic. In earth and timber castles, the gateway was usually the first feature to be rebuilt in stone. The front of the gateway was a blind spot and to overcome this, projecting towers were added on each side of the gate in a style similar to that developed by the Romans. The gatehouse contained a series of defences to make a direct assault more difficult than battering down a simple gate. Typically, there were one or more portcullises\u00a0\u2013 a wooden grille reinforced with metal to block a passage\u00a0\u2013 and arrowslits to allow defenders to harry the enemy. The passage through the gatehouse was lengthened to increase the amount of time an assailant had to spend under fire in a confined space and unable to retaliate.\nIt is a popular myth that murder holes\u00a0\u2013 openings in the ceiling of the gateway passage\u00a0\u2013 were used to pour boiling oil or molten lead on attackers; the price of oil and lead and the distance of the gatehouse from fires meant that this was impractical. This method was, however, a common practice in Middle Eastern and Mediterranean castles and fortifications, where such resources were abundant. They were most likely used to drop objects on attackers, or to allow water to be poured on fires to extinguish them. Provision was made in the upper storey of the gatehouse for accommodation so the gate was never left undefended, although this arrangement later evolved to become more comfortable at the expense of defence.\nDuring the 13th and 14th centuries the barbican was developed. This consisted of a rampart, ditch, and possibly a tower, in front of the gatehouse which could be used to further protect the entrance. The purpose of a barbican was not just to provide another line of defence but also to dictate the only approach to the gate.\nMoat.\nA moat is a ditch surrounding a castle \u2013 or dividing one part of a castle from another \u2013 and could be either dry or filled with water. It often had a defensive purpose, preventing siege towers from reaching walls, along with making mining harder, but could also be ornamental. Water moats were found in low-lying areas and were usually crossed by a drawbridge, although these were often replaced by stone bridges. The site of the 13th-century Caerphilly Castle in Wales covers over and the water defences, created by flooding the valley to the south of the castle, are some of the largest in Western Europe.\nBattlements.\nBattlements were most often found surmounting curtain walls and the tops of gatehouses, and comprised several elements: crenellations, hoardings, machicolations, and loopholes. Crenellation is the collective name for alternating crenels and merlons: gaps and solid blocks on top of a wall. Hoardings were wooden constructs that projected beyond the wall, allowing defenders to shoot at, or drop objects on, attackers at the base of the wall without having to lean perilously over the crenellations, thereby exposing themselves to retaliatory fire. Machicolations were stone projections on top of a wall with openings that allowed objects to be dropped on an enemy at the base of the wall in a similar fashion to hoardings.\nArrowslits.\nArrowslits, also commonly called loopholes, were narrow vertical openings in defensive walls which allowed arrows or crossbow bolts to be fired on attackers. The narrow slits were intended to protect the defender by providing a very small target, but the size of the opening could also impede the defender if it was too small. A smaller horizontal opening could be added to give an archer a better view for aiming. Sometimes a sally port was included; this could allow the garrison to leave the castle and engage besieging forces. It was usual for the latrines to empty down the external walls of a castle and into the surrounding ditch.\nPostern.\nA postern is a secondary door or gate in a concealed location, usually in a fortification such as a city wall.\nGreat hall.\nThe great hall was a large, decorated room where a lord received his guests. The hall represented the prestige, authority, and richness of the lord. Events such as feasts, banquets, social or ceremonial gatherings, meetings of the military council, and judicial trials were held in the great hall. Sometimes the great hall existed as a separate building, in that case, it was called a hall-house.\nHistory.\nAntecedents.\nHistorian Charles Coulson states that the accumulation of wealth and resources, such as food, led to the need for defensive structures. The earliest fortifications originated in the Fertile Crescent, the Indus Valley, Europe, Egypt, and China where settlements were protected by large walls. In Northern Europe, hill forts were first developed in the Bronze Age, which then proliferated across Europe in the Iron Age. Hillforts in Britain typically used earthworks rather than stone as a building material.\nMany earthworks survive today, along with evidence of palisades to accompany the ditches. In central and western Europe, oppida emerged in the 2nd\u00a0century\u00a0BC; these were densely inhabited fortified settlements, such as the oppidum of Manching. Some oppida walls were built on a massive scale, utilising stone, wood, iron and earth in their construction. The Romans encountered fortified settlements such as hill forts and oppida when expanding their territory into northern Europe. Their defences were often effective, and were only overcome by the extensive use of siege engines and other siege warfare techniques, such as at the Battle of Alesia. The Romans' own fortifications (\"castra\") varied from simple temporary earthworks thrown up by armies on the move, to elaborate permanent stone constructions, notably the milecastles of Hadrian's Wall. Roman forts were generally rectangular with rounded corners \u2013 a \"playing-card shape\".\nIn the medieval period, castles were influenced by earlier forms of elite architecture, contributing to regional variations. Importantly, while castles had military aspects, they contained a recognisable household structure within their walls, reflecting the multi-functional use of these buildings.\nOrigins (9th and 10th centuries).\nThe subject of the emergence of castles in Europe is a complex matter which has led to considerable debate. Discussions have typically attributed the rise of the castle to a reaction to attacks by Magyars, Muslims, and Vikings and a need for private defence. The breakdown of the Carolingian Empire led to the privatisation of government, and local lords assumed responsibility for the economy and justice. However, while castles proliferated in the 9th and 10th centuries the link between periods of insecurity and building fortifications is not always straightforward. Some high concentrations of castles occur in secure places, while some border regions had relatively few castles.\nIt is likely that the castle evolved from the practice of fortifying a lordly home. The greatest threat to a lord's home or hall was fire as it was usually a wooden structure. To protect against this, and keep other threats at bay, there were several courses of action available: create encircling earthworks to keep an enemy at a distance; build the hall in stone; or raise it up on an artificial mound, known as a motte, to present an obstacle to attackers. While the concept of ditches, ramparts, and stone walls as defensive measures is ancient, raising a motte is a medieval innovation.\nA bank and ditch enclosure was a simple form of defence, and when found without an associated motte is called a ringwork; when the site was in use for a prolonged period, it was sometimes replaced by a more complex structure or enhanced by the addition of a stone curtain wall. Building the hall in stone did not necessarily make it immune to fire as it still had windows and a wooden door. This led to the elevation of windows to the second storey\u00a0\u2013 to make it harder to throw objects in\u00a0\u2013 and to move the entrance from ground level to the second storey. These features are seen in many surviving castle keeps, which were the more sophisticated version of halls. Castles were not just defensive sites but also enhanced a lord's control over his lands. They allowed the garrison to control the surrounding area, and formed a centre of administration, providing the lord with a place to hold court.\nBuilding a castle sometimes required the permission of the king or other high authority. In 864 the King of West Francia, Charles the Bald, prohibited the construction of \"castella\" without his permission and ordered them all to be destroyed. This is perhaps the earliest reference to castles, though military historian R. Allen Brown points out that the word \"castella\" may have applied to any fortification at the time.\nIn some countries the monarch had little control over lords, or required the construction of new castles to aid in securing the land so was unconcerned about granting permission\u00a0\u2013 as was the case in England in the aftermath of the Norman Conquest and the Holy Land during the Crusades. Switzerland is an extreme case of there being no state control over who built castles, and as a result there were 4,000 in the country. There are very few castles dated with certainty from the mid-9th\u00a0century. Converted into a donjon around 950, Ch\u00e2teau de Dou\u00e9-la-Fontaine in France is the oldest standing castle in Europe.\n11th century.\nFrom 1000 onwards, references to castles in texts such as charters increased greatly. Historians have interpreted this as evidence of a sudden increase in the number of castles in Europe around this time; this has been supported by archaeological investigation which has dated the construction of castle sites through the examination of ceramics. The increase in Italy began in the 950s, with numbers of castles increasing by a factor of three to five every 50\u00a0years, whereas in other parts of Europe such as France and Spain the growth was slower. In 950, Provence was home to 12\u00a0castles; by 1000, this figure had risen to 30, and by 1030 it was over 100. Although the increase was slower in Spain, the 1020s saw a particular growth in the number of castles in the region, particularly in contested border areas between Christian and Muslim lands.\nDespite the common period in which castles rose to prominence in Europe, their form and design varied from region to region. In the early 11th\u00a0century, the motte and keep\u00a0\u2013 an artificial mound with a palisade and tower on top\u00a0\u2013 was the most common form of castle in Europe, everywhere except Scandinavia. While Britain, France, and Italy shared a tradition of timber construction that was continued in castle architecture, Spain more commonly used stone or mud-brick as the main building material.\nThe Muslim invasion of the Iberian Peninsula in the 8th\u00a0century introduced a style of building developed in North Africa reliant on \"tapial\", pebbles in cement, where timber was in short supply. Although stone construction would later become common elsewhere, from the 11th\u00a0century onwards it was the primary building material for Christian castles in Spain, while at the same time timber was still the dominant building material in north-west Europe.\nHistorians have interpreted the widespread presence of castles across Europe in the 11th\u00a0and 12th\u00a0centuries as evidence that warfare was common, and usually between local lords. Castles were introduced into England shortly before the Norman Conquest in 1066. Before the 12th\u00a0century castles were as uncommon in Denmark as they had been in England before the Norman Conquest. The introduction of castles to Denmark was a reaction to attacks from Wendish pirates, and they were usually intended as coastal defences. The motte and bailey remained the dominant form of castle in England, Wales, and Ireland well into the 12th\u00a0century. At the same time, castle architecture in mainland Europe became more sophisticated.\nThe donjon was at the centre of this change in castle architecture in the 12th\u00a0century. Central towers proliferated, and typically had a square plan, with walls thick. Their decoration emulated Romanesque architecture, and sometimes incorporated double windows similar to those found in church bell towers. Donjons, which were the residence of the lord of the castle, evolved to become more spacious. The design emphasis of donjons changed to reflect a shift from functional to decorative requirements, imposing a symbol of lordly power upon the landscape. This sometimes led to compromising defence for the sake of display.\n\"See also \"maison forte\", French article \"\nInnovation and scientific design (12th century).\nUntil the 12th\u00a0century, stone-built and earth and timber castles were contemporary, but by the late 12th\u00a0century the number of castles being built went into decline. This has been partly attributed to the higher cost of stone-built fortifications, and the obsolescence of timber and earthwork sites, which meant it was preferable to build in more durable stone. Although superseded by their stone successors, timber and earthwork castles were by no means useless. This is evidenced by the continual maintenance of timber castles over long periods, sometimes several centuries; Owain Glynd\u0175r's 11th-century timber castle at Sycharth was still in use by the start of the 15th\u00a0century, its structure having been maintained for four centuries.\nAt the same time there was a change in castle architecture. Until the late 12th\u00a0century castles generally had few towers; a gateway with few defensive features such as arrowslits or a portcullis; a great keep or donjon, usually square and without arrowslits; and the shape would have been dictated by the lay of the land (the result was often irregular or curvilinear structures). The design of castles was not uniform, but these were features that could be found in a typical castle in the mid-12th\u00a0century. By the end of the 12th\u00a0century or the early 13th\u00a0century, a newly constructed castle could be expected to be polygonal in shape, with towers at the corners to provide enfilading fire for the walls. The towers would have protruded from the walls and featured arrowslits on each level to allow archers to target anyone nearing or at the curtain wall.\nThese later castles did not always have a keep, but this may have been because the more complex design of the castle as a whole drove up costs and the keep was sacrificed to save money. The larger towers provided space for habitation to make up for the loss of the donjon. Where keeps did exist, they were no longer square but polygonal or cylindrical. Gateways were more strongly defended, with the entrance to the castle usually between two half-round towers which were connected by a passage above the gateway\u00a0\u2013 although there was great variety in the styles of gateway and entrances\u00a0\u2013 and one or more portcullis.\nA peculiar feature of Muslim castles in the Iberian Peninsula was the use of detached towers, called Albarrana towers, around the perimeter as can be seen at the Alcazaba of Badajoz. Probably developed in the 12th\u00a0century, the towers provided flanking fire. They were connected to the castle by removable wooden bridges, so if the towers were captured the rest of the castle was not accessible.\nWhen seeking to explain this change in the complexity and style of castles, antiquarians found their answer in the Crusades. It seemed that the Crusaders had learned much about fortification from their conflicts with the Saracens and exposure to Byzantine architecture. There were legends such as that of Lalys\u00a0\u2013 an architect from Palestine who reputedly went to Wales after the Crusades and greatly enhanced the castles in the south of the country\u00a0\u2013 and it was assumed that great architects such as James of Saint George originated in the East. In the mid-20th\u00a0century this view was cast into doubt. Legends were discredited, and in the case of James of Saint George it was proven that he came from Saint-Georges-d'Esp\u00e9ranche, in France. If the innovations in fortification had derived from the East, it would have been expected for their influence to be seen from 1100 onwards, immediately after the Christians were victorious in the First Crusade (1096\u20131099), rather than nearly 100\u00a0years later. Remains of Roman structures in Western Europe were still standing in many places, some of which had flanking round-towers and entrances between two flanking towers.\nThe castle builders of Western Europe were aware of and influenced by Roman design; late Roman coastal forts on the English \"Saxon Shore\" were reused and in Spain the wall around the city of \u00c1vila imitated Roman architecture when it was built in 1091. Historian Smail in \"Crusading warfare\" argued that the case for the influence of Eastern fortification on the West has been overstated, and that Crusaders of the 12th\u00a0century in fact learned very little about scientific design from Byzantine and Saracen defences. A well-sited castle that made use of natural defences and had strong ditches and walls had no need for a scientific design. An example of this approach is Kerak. Although there were no scientific elements to its design, it was almost impregnable, and in 1187 Saladin chose to lay siege to the castle and starve out its garrison rather than risk an assault.\nDuring the late 11th and 12th centuries in what is now south-central Turkey the Hospitallers, Teutonic Knights and Templars established themselves in the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia, where they discovered an extensive network of sophisticated fortifications which had a profound impact on the architecture of Crusader castles. Most of the Armenian military sites in Cilicia are characterized by: multiple bailey walls laid with irregular plans to follow the sinuosities of the outcrops; rounded and especially horseshoe-shaped towers; finely-cut often rusticated ashlar facing stones with intricate poured cores; concealed postern gates and complex bent entrances with slot machicolations; embrasured loopholes for archers; barrel, pointed or groined vaults over undercrofts, gates and chapels; and cisterns with elaborate scarped drains. Civilian settlement are often found in the immediate proximity of these fortifications. After the First Crusade, Crusaders who did not return to their homes in Europe helped found the Crusader states of the Principality of Antioch, the County of Edessa, the Kingdom of Jerusalem, and the County of Tripoli. The castles they founded to secure their acquisitions were designed mostly by Syrian master-masons. Their design was very similar to that of a Roman fort or Byzantine \"tetrapyrgia\" which were square in plan and had square towers at each corner that did not project much beyond the curtain wall. The keep of these Crusader castles would have had a square plan and generally be undecorated.\nWhile castles were used to hold a site and control movement of armies, in the Holy Land some key strategic positions were left unfortified. Castle architecture in the East became more complex around the late 12th and early 13th\u00a0centuries after the stalemate of the Third Crusade (1189\u20131192). Both Christians and Muslims created fortifications, and the character of each was different. Saphadin, the 13th-century ruler of the Saracens, created structures with large rectangular towers that influenced Muslim architecture and were copied again and again, however they had little influence on Crusader castles.\n13th to 15th centuries.\nIn the early 13th\u00a0century, Crusader castles were mostly built by Military Orders including the Knights Hospitaller, Knights Templar, and Teutonic Knights. The orders were responsible for the foundation of sites such as Krak des Chevaliers, Margat, and Belvoir. Design varied not just between orders, but between individual castles, though it was common for those founded in this period to have concentric defences.\nThe concept, which originated in castles such as Krak des Chevaliers, was to remove the reliance on a central strongpoint and to emphasise the defence of the curtain walls. There would be multiple rings of defensive walls, one inside the other, with the inner ring rising above the outer so that its field of fire was not completely obscured. If assailants made it past the first line of defence they would be caught in the killing ground between the inner and outer walls and have to assault the second wall.\nConcentric castles were widely copied across Europe, for instance when Edward I of England\u00a0\u2013 who had himself been on Crusade\u00a0\u2013 built castles in Wales in the late 13th\u00a0century, four of the eight he founded had a concentric design. Not all the features of the Crusader castles from the 13th\u00a0century were emulated in Europe. For instance, it was common in Crusader castles to have the main gate in the side of a tower and for there to be two turns in the passageway, lengthening the time it took for someone to reach the outer enclosure. It is rare for this bent entrance to be found in Europe.\nOne of the effects of the Livonian Crusade in the Baltic was the introduction of stone and brick fortifications. Although there were hundreds of wooden castles in Prussia and Livonia, the use of bricks and mortar was unknown in the region before the Crusaders. Until the 13th century and start of the 14th centuries, their design was heterogeneous, however this period saw the emergence of a standard plan in the region: a square plan, with four wings around a central courtyard. It was common for castles in the East to have arrowslits in the curtain wall at multiple levels; contemporary builders in Europe were wary of this as they believed it weakened the wall. Arrowslits did not compromise the wall's strength, but it was not until Edward I's programme of castle building that they were widely adopted in Europe.\nThe Crusades also led to the introduction of machicolations into Western architecture. Until the 13th\u00a0century, the tops of towers had been surrounded by wooden galleries, allowing defenders to drop objects on assailants below. Although machicolations performed the same purpose as the wooden galleries, they were probably an Eastern invention rather than an evolution of the wooden form. Machicolations were used in the East long before the arrival of the Crusaders, and perhaps as early as the first half of the 8th\u00a0century in Syria.\nThe greatest period of castle building in Spain was in the 11th to 13th\u00a0centuries, and they were most commonly found in the disputed borders between Christian and Muslim lands. Conflict and interaction between the two groups led to an exchange of architectural ideas, and Spanish Christians adopted the use of detached towers. The Spanish Reconquista, driving the Muslims out of the Iberian Peninsula, was complete in 1492.\nAlthough France has been described as \"the heartland of medieval architecture\", the English were at the forefront of castle architecture in the 12th\u00a0century. French historian Fran\u00e7ois Gebelin wrote: \"The great revival in military architecture was led, as one would naturally expect, by the powerful kings and princes of the time; by the sons of William the Conqueror and their descendants, the Plantagenets, when they became dukes of Normandy. These were the men who built all the most typical twelfth-century fortified castles remaining today\". Despite this, by the beginning of the 15th\u00a0century, the rate of castle construction in England and Wales went into decline. The new castles were generally of a lighter build than earlier structures and presented few innovations, although strong sites were still created such as that of Raglan in Wales. At the same time, French castle architecture came to the fore and led the way in the field of medieval fortifications. Across Europe\u00a0\u2013 particularly the Baltic, Germany, and Scotland\u00a0\u2013 castles were built well into the 16th\u00a0century.\nAdvent of gunpowder.\nArtillery powered by gunpowder was introduced to Europe in the 1320s and spread quickly. Handguns, which were initially unpredictable and inaccurate weapons, were not recorded until the 1380s. Castles were adapted to allow small artillery pieces\u00a0\u2013 averaging between \u00a0\u2013 to fire from towers. These guns were too heavy for a man to carry and fire, but if he supported the butt end and rested the muzzle on the edge of the gun port he could fire the weapon. The gun ports developed in this period show a unique feature, that of a horizontal timber across the opening. A hook on the end of the gun could be latched over the timber so the gunner did not have to take the full recoil of the weapon. This adaptation is found across Europe, and although the timber rarely survives, there is an intact example at Castle Doornenburg in the Netherlands. Gunports were keyhole shaped, with a circular hole at the bottom for the weapon and a narrow slit on top to allow the gunner to aim.\nThis form is very common in castles adapted for guns, found in Egypt, Italy, Scotland, and Spain, and elsewhere in between. Other types of port, though less common, were horizontal slits\u00a0\u2013 allowing only lateral movement\u00a0\u2013 and large square openings, which allowed greater movement. The use of guns for defence gave rise to artillery castles, such as that of Ch\u00e2teau de Ham in France. Defences against guns were not developed until a later stage. Ham is an example of the trend for new castles to dispense with earlier features such as machicolations, tall towers, and crenellations.\nBigger guns were developed, and in the 15th\u00a0century became an alternative to siege engines such as the trebuchet. The benefits of large guns over trebuchets\u00a0\u2013 the most effective siege engine of the Middle Ages before the advent of gunpowder\u00a0\u2013 were those of a greater range and power. In an effort to make them more effective, guns were made ever bigger, although this hampered their ability to reach remote castles. By the 1450s guns were the preferred siege weapon, and their effectiveness was demonstrated by Mehmed II at the Fall of Constantinople.\nThe response towards more effective cannons was to build thicker walls and to prefer round towers, as the curving sides were more likely to deflect a shot than a flat surface. While this sufficed for new castles, pre-existing structures had to find a way to cope with being battered by cannon. An earthen bank could be piled behind a castle's curtain wall to absorb some of the shock of impact.\nOften, castles constructed before the age of gunpowder were incapable of using guns as their wall-walks were too narrow. A solution to this was to pull down the top of a tower and to fill the lower part with the rubble to provide a surface for the guns to fire from. Lowering the defences in this way had the effect of making them easier to scale with ladders. A more popular alternative defence, which avoided damaging the castle, was to establish bulwarks beyond the castle's defences. These could be built from earth or stone and were used to mount weapons.\nBastions and star forts (16th century).\nAround 1500, the innovation of the angled bastion was developed in Italy. With developments such as these, Italy pioneered permanent artillery fortifications, which took over from the defensive role of castles. From this evolved star forts, also known as \"trace italienne\". The elite responsible for castle construction had to choose between the new type that could withstand cannon fire and the earlier, more elaborate style. The first was ugly and uncomfortable and the latter was less secure, although it did offer greater aesthetic appeal and value as a status symbol. The second choice proved to be more popular as it became apparent that there was little point in trying to make the site genuinely defensible in the face of cannon. For a variety of reasons, not least of which is that many castles have no recorded history, there is no firm number of castles built in the medieval period. However, it has been estimated that between 75,000 and 100,000 were built in western Europe; of these around 1,700 were in England and Wales and around 14,000 in German-speaking areas.\nSome true castles were built in the Americas by the Spanish and French colonies. The first stage of Spanish fort construction has been termed the \"castle period\", which lasted from 1492 until the end of the 16th\u00a0century. Starting with Fortaleza Ozama, \"these castles were essentially European medieval castles transposed to America\". Among other defensive structures (including forts and citadels), castles were also built in New France towards the end of the 17th\u00a0century. In Montreal the artillery was not as developed as on the battle-fields of Europe, some of the region's outlying forts were built like the fortified manor houses of France. Fort Longueuil, built from 1695 to 1698 by a baronial family, has been described as \"the most medieval-looking fort built in Canada\". The manor house and stables were within a fortified bailey, with a tall round turret in each corner. The \"most substantial castle-like fort\" near Montr\u00e9al was Fort Senneville, built in 1692 with square towers connected by thick stone walls, as well as a fortified windmill. Stone forts such as these served as defensive residences, as well as imposing structures to prevent Iroquois incursions.\nAlthough castle construction faded towards the end of the 16th\u00a0century, castles did not necessarily all fall out of use. Some retained a role in local administration and became law courts, while others are still handed down in aristocratic families as hereditary seats. A particularly famous example of this is Windsor Castle in England which was founded in the 11th\u00a0century and is home to the monarch of the United Kingdom. In other cases they still had a role in defence. Tower houses, which are closely related to castles and include pele towers, were defended towers that were permanent residences built in the 14th to 17th centuries. Especially common in Ireland and Scotland, they could be up to five storeys high and succeeded common enclosure castles and were built by a greater social range of people. While unlikely to provide as much protection as a more complex castle, they offered security against raiders and other small threats.\nLater use and revival castles.\nAccording to archaeologists Oliver Creighton and Robert Higham, \"the great country houses of the seventeenth to twentieth centuries were, in a social sense, the castles of their day\". Though there was a trend for the elite to move from castles into country houses in the 17th\u00a0century, castles were not completely useless. In later conflicts, such as the English Civil War (1641\u20131651), many castles were refortified, although subsequently slighted to prevent them from being used again. Some country residences, which were not meant to be fortified, were given a castle appearance to scare away potential invaders such as adding turrets and using small windows. An example of this is the 16th century Bubaqra Castle in Bubaqra, Malta, which was modified in the 18th century.\nRevival or mock castles became popular as a manifestation of a Romantic interest in the Middle Ages and chivalry, and as part of the broader Gothic Revival in architecture. Examples of these castles include Chapultepec in Mexico, Neuschwanstein in Germany, and Edwin Lutyens' Castle Drogo (1911\u20131930)\u00a0\u2013 the last flicker of this movement in the British Isles. While churches and cathedrals in a Gothic style could faithfully imitate medieval examples, new country houses built in a \"castle style\" differed internally from their medieval predecessors. This was because to be faithful to medieval design would have left the houses cold and dark by contemporary standards.\nArtificial ruins, built to resemble remnants of historic edifices, were also a hallmark of the period. They were usually built as centre pieces in aristocratic planned landscapes. Follies were similar, although they differed from artificial ruins in that they were not part of a planned landscape, but rather seemed to have no reason for being built. Both drew on elements of castle architecture such as castellation and towers, but served no military purpose and were solely for display. A toy castle is used as a common children attraction in playing fields and fun parks, such as the castle of the Playmobil FunPark in \u0126al Far, Malta.\nConstruction.\nOnce the site of a castle had been selected\u00a0\u2013 whether a strategic position or one intended to dominate the landscape as a mark of power\u00a0\u2013 the building material had to be selected. An earth and timber castle was cheaper and easier to erect than one built from stone. The costs involved in construction are not well-recorded, and most surviving records relate to royal castles. A castle with earthen ramparts, a motte, timber defences and buildings could have been constructed by an unskilled workforce. The source of man-power was probably from the local lordship, and the tenants would already have the necessary skills of felling trees, digging, and working timber necessary for an earth and timber castle. Possibly coerced into working for their lord, the construction of an earth and timber castle would not have been a drain on a client's funds. In terms of time, it has been estimated that an average sized motte \u2013 high and wide at the summit\u00a0\u2013 would have taken 50\u00a0people about 40\u00a0working days. An exceptionally expensive motte and bailey was that of Clones in Ireland, built in 1211 for UK\u00a320. The high cost, relative to other castles of its type, was because labourers had to be imported.\nThe cost of building a castle varied according to factors such as their complexity and transport costs for material. It is certain that stone castles cost a great deal more than those built from earth and timber. Even a very small tower, such as Peveril Castle, would have cost around UK\u00a3200. In the middle were castles such as Orford, which was built in the late 12th\u00a0century for UK\u00a31,400, and at the upper end were those such as Dover, which cost about UK\u00a37,000 between 1181 and 1191. Spending on the scale of the vast castles such as Ch\u00e2teau Gaillard (an estimated UK\u00a315,000 to UK\u00a320,000 between 1196 and 1198) was easily supported by The Crown, but for lords of smaller areas, castle building was a very serious and costly undertaking. It was usual for a stone castle to take the best part of a decade to finish. The cost of a large castle built over this time (anywhere from UK\u00a31,000 to UK\u00a310,000) would take the income from several manors, severely impacting a lord's finances. Costs in the late 13th\u00a0century were of a similar order, with castles such as Beaumaris and Rhuddlan costing UK\u00a314,500 and UK\u00a39,000 respectively. Edward I's campaign of castle-building in Wales cost UK\u00a380,000 between 1277 and 1304, and UK\u00a395,000 between 1277 and 1329. Renowned designer Master James of Saint George, responsible for the construction of Beaumaris, explained the cost:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In case you should wonder where so much money could go in a week, we would have you know that we have needed \u2013 and shall continue to need 400\u00a0masons, both cutters and layers, together with 2,000\u00a0less-skilled workmen, 100\u00a0carts, 60\u00a0wagons, and 30\u00a0boats bringing stone and sea coal; 200\u00a0quarrymen; 30\u00a0smiths; and carpenters for putting in the joists and floor boards and other necessary jobs. All this takes no account of the garrison ... nor of purchases of material. Of which there will have to be a great quantity ... The men's pay has been and still is very much in arrears, and we are having the greatest difficulty in keeping them because they have simply nothing to live on.\u2014\u200a\nNot only were stone castles expensive to build in the first place, but their maintenance was a constant drain. They contained a lot of timber, which was often unseasoned and as a result needed careful upkeep. For example, it is documented that in the late 12th\u00a0century repairs at castles such as Exeter and Gloucester cost between UK\u00a320 and UK\u00a350 annually.\nMedieval machines and inventions, such as the treadwheel crane, became indispensable during construction, and techniques of building wooden scaffolding were improved upon from Antiquity. When building in stone a prominent concern of medieval builders was to have quarries close at hand. There are examples of some castles where stone was quarried on site, such as Chinon, Ch\u00e2teau de Coucy and Ch\u00e2teau Gaillard. When it was built in 992 in France the stone tower at Ch\u00e2teau de Langeais was high, wide, and long with walls averaging . The walls contain of stone and have a total surface (both inside and out) of . The tower is estimated to have taken 83,000\u00a0average working days to complete, most of which was unskilled labour.\nMany countries had both timber and stone castles, however Denmark had few quarries and as a result most of its castles are earth and timber affairs, or later on built from brick. Brick-built structures were not necessarily weaker than their stone-built counterparts. Brick castles are less common in England than stone or earth and timber constructions, and often it was chosen for its aesthetic appeal or because it was fashionable, encouraged by the brick architecture of the Low Countries. For example, when Tattershall Castle in England was built between 1430 and 1450, there was plenty of stone available nearby, but the owner, Lord Cromwell, chose to use brick. About 700,000\u00a0bricks were used to build the castle, which has been described as \"the finest piece of medieval brick-work in England\". Most Spanish castles were built from stone, whereas castles in Eastern Europe were usually of timber construction.\n\"On the Construction of the Castle of Safed\", written in the early 1260s, describes the construction of a new castle at Safed. It is \"one of the fullest\" medieval accounts of a castle's construction.\nSocial centre.\nDue to the lord's presence in a castle, it was a centre of administration from where he controlled his lands. He relied on the support of those below him, as without the support of his more powerful tenants a lord could expect his power to be undermined. Successful lords regularly held court with those immediately below them on the social scale, but absentees could expect to find their influence weakened. Larger lordships could be vast, and it would be impractical for a lord to visit all his properties regularly, so deputies were appointed. This especially applied to royalty, who sometimes owned land in different countries.\nTo allow the lord to concentrate on his duties regarding administration, he had a household of servants to take care of chores such as providing food. The household was run by a chamberlain, while a treasurer took care of the estate's written records. Royal households took essentially the same form as baronial households, although on a much larger scale and the positions were more prestigious. An important role of the household servants was the preparation of food; the castle kitchens would have been a busy place when the castle was occupied, called on to provide large meals. Without the presence of a lord's household, usually because he was staying elsewhere, a castle would have been a quiet place with few residents, focused on maintaining the castle.\nAs social centres castles were important places for display. Builders took the opportunity to draw on symbolism, through the use of motifs, to evoke a sense of chivalry that was aspired to in the Middle Ages amongst the elite. Later structures of the Romantic revival would draw on elements of castle architecture such as battlements for the same purpose. Castles have been compared with cathedrals as objects of architectural pride, and some castles incorporated gardens as ornamental features. The right to crenellate, when granted by a monarch \u2013 though it was not always necessary\u00a0\u2013 was important not just as it allowed a lord to defend his property but because crenellations and other accoutrements associated with castles were prestigious through their use by the elite. Licences to crenellate were also proof of a relationship with or favour from the monarch, who was the one responsible for granting permission.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"The castle, as a large and imposing architectural structure in the landscape, would have evoked emotions and attachments and created a legacy for those who built it, worked in it, and lived in and around it, as well as those who simply passed it on a daily basis.\"\nCourtly love was the eroticisation of love between the nobility. Emphasis was placed on restraint between lovers. Though sometimes expressed through chivalric events such as tournaments, where knights would fight wearing a token from their lady, it could also be private and conducted in secret. The legend of Tristan and Iseult is one example of stories of courtly love told in the Middle Ages. It was an ideal of love between two people not married to each other, although the man might be married to someone else. It was not uncommon or ignoble for a lord to be adulterous \u2013 Henry I of England had over 20\u00a0bastards for instance \u2013 but for a lady to be promiscuous was seen as dishonourable.\nThe purpose of marriage between the medieval elites was to secure land. Girls were married in their teens, but boys did not marry until they came of age. There is a popular conception that women played a peripheral role in the medieval castle household, and that it was dominated by the lord himself. This derives from the image of the castle as a martial institution, but most castles in England, France, Ireland, and Scotland were never involved in conflicts or sieges, so the domestic life is a neglected facet. The lady was given a dower of her husband's estates \u2013 usually about a third\u00a0\u2013 which was hers for life, and her husband would inherit on her death. It was her duty to administer them directly, as the lord administered his own land. Despite generally being excluded from military service, a woman could be in charge of a castle, either on behalf of her husband or if she was widowed. Because of their influence within the medieval household, women influenced construction and design, sometimes through direct patronage; historian Charles Coulson emphasises the role of women in applying \"a refined aristocratic taste\" to castles due to their long term residence.\nLocations and landscapes.\nThe positioning of castles was influenced by the available terrain. Whereas hill castles such as Marksburg were common in Germany, where 66\u00a0per cent of all known medieval were highland area while 34\u00a0per cent were on low-lying land, they formed a minority of sites in England. Because of the range of functions they had to fulfil, castles were built in a variety of locations. Multiple factors were considered when choosing a site, balancing between the need for a defendable position with other considerations such as proximity to resources. For instance many castles are located near Roman roads, which remained important transport routes in the Middle Ages, or could lead to the alteration or creation of new road systems in the area. Where available it was common to exploit pre-existing defences such as building with a Roman fort or the ramparts of an Iron Age hillfort. A prominent site that overlooked the surrounding area and offered some natural defences may also have been chosen because its visibility made it a symbol of power. Urban castles were particularly important in controlling centres of population and production, especially with an invading force, for instance in the aftermath of the Norman Conquest of England in the 11th\u00a0century the majority of royal castles were built in or near towns.\nAs castles were not simply military buildings but centres of administration and symbols of power, they had a significant impact on the surrounding landscape. Placed by a frequently used road or river, the toll castle ensured that a lord would get his due toll money from merchants. Rural castles were often associated with mills and field systems due to their role in managing the lord's estate, which gave them greater influence over resources. Others were adjacent to or in royal forests or deer parks and were important in their upkeep. Fish ponds were a luxury of the lordly elite, and many were found next to castles. Not only were they practical in that they ensured a water supply and fresh fish, but they were a status symbol as they were expensive to build and maintain.\nAlthough sometimes the construction of a castle led to the destruction of a village, such as at Eaton Socon in England, it was more common for the villages nearby to have grown as a result of the presence of a castle. Sometimes planned towns or villages were created around a castle. The benefits of castle building on settlements was not confined to Europe. When the 13th-century Safad Castle was founded in Galilee in the Holy Land, the 260\u00a0villages benefitted from the inhabitants' newfound ability to move freely. When built, a castle could result in the restructuring of the local landscape, with roads moved for the convenience of the lord. Settlements could also grow naturally around a castle, rather than being planned, due to the benefits of proximity to an economic centre in a rural landscape and the safety given by the defences. Not all such settlements survived, as once the castle lost its importance\u00a0\u2013 perhaps succeeded by a manor house as the centre of administration\u00a0\u2013 the benefits of living next to a castle vanished and the settlement depopulated.\nDuring and shortly after the Norman Conquest of England, castles were inserted into important pre-existing towns to control and subdue the populace. They were usually located near any existing town defences, such as Roman walls, although this sometimes resulted in the demolition of structures occupying the desired site. In Lincoln, 166\u00a0houses were destroyed to clear space for the castle, and in York agricultural land was flooded to create a moat for the castle. As the military importance of urban castles waned from their early origins, they became more important as centres of administration, and their financial and judicial roles. When the Normans invaded Ireland, Scotland, and Wales in the 11th\u00a0and 12th\u00a0centuries, settlement in those countries was predominantly non-urban, and the foundation of towns was often linked with the creation of a castle.\nThe location of castles in relation to high status features, such as fish ponds, was a statement of power and control of resources. Also often found near a castle, sometimes within its defences, was the parish church. This signified a close relationship between feudal lords and the Church, one of the most important institutions of medieval society. Even elements of castle architecture that have usually been interpreted as military could be used for display. The water features of Kenilworth Castle in England\u00a0\u2013 comprising a moat and several satellite ponds\u00a0\u2013 forced anyone approaching a water castle entrance to take a very indirect route, walking around the defences before the final approach towards the gateway. Another example is that of the 14th-century Bodiam Castle, also in England; although it appears to be a state of the art, advanced castle it is in a site of little strategic importance, and the moat was shallow and more likely intended to make the site appear impressive than as a defence against mining. The approach was long and took the viewer around the castle, ensuring they got a good look before entering. Moreover, the gunports were impractical and unlikely to have been effective.\nWarfare.\nAs a static structure, castles could often be avoided. Their immediate area of influence was about and their weapons had a short range even early in the age of artillery. However, leaving an enemy behind would allow them to interfere with communications and make raids. Garrisons were expensive and as a result often small unless the castle was important. Cost also meant that in peacetime garrisons were smaller, and small castles were manned by perhaps a couple of watchmen and gate-guards. Even in war, garrisons were not necessarily large as too many people in a defending force would strain supplies and impair the castle's ability to withstand a long siege. In 1403, a force of 37\u00a0archers successfully defended Caernarfon Castle against two assaults by Owain Glynd\u0175r's allies during a long siege, demonstrating that a small force could be effective.\nEarly on, manning a castle was a feudal duty of vassals to their magnates, and magnates to their kings, however this was later replaced with paid forces. A garrison was usually commanded by a constable whose peacetime role would have been looking after the castle in the owner's absence. Under him would have been knights who by benefit of their military training would have acted as a type of officer class. Below them were archers and bowmen, whose role was to prevent the enemy reaching the walls as can be seen by the positioning of arrowslits.\nIf it was necessary to seize control of a castle an army could either launch an assault or lay siege. It was more efficient to starve the garrison out than to assault it, particularly for the most heavily defended sites. Without relief from an external source, the defenders would eventually submit. Sieges could last weeks, months, and in rare cases years if the supplies of food and water were plentiful. A long siege could slow down the army, allowing help to come or for the enemy to prepare a larger force for later. Such an approach was not confined to castles, but was also applied to the fortified towns of the day. On occasion, siege castles would be built to defend the besiegers from a sudden sally and would have been abandoned after the siege ended one way or another.\nIf forced to assault a castle, there were many options available to the attackers. For wooden structures, such as early motte-and-baileys, fire was a real threat and attempts would be made to set them alight as can be seen in the Bayeux Tapestry. Projectile weapons had been used since antiquity and the mangonel and petraria\u00a0\u2013 from Eastern and Roman origins respectively\u00a0\u2013 were the main two that were used into the Middle Ages. The trebuchet, which probably evolved from the petraria in the 13th\u00a0century, was the most effective siege weapon before the development of cannons. These weapons were vulnerable to fire from the castle as they had a short range and were large machines. Conversely, weapons such as trebuchets could be fired from within the castle due to the high trajectory of its projectile, and would be protected from direct fire by the curtain walls.\nBallistas or springalds were siege engines that worked on the same principles as crossbows. With their origins in Ancient Greece, tension was used to project a bolt or javelin. Missiles fired from these engines had a lower trajectory than trebuchets or mangonels and were more accurate. They were more commonly used against the garrison rather than the buildings of a castle. Eventually cannons developed to the point where they were more powerful and had a greater range than the trebuchet, and became the main weapon in siege warfare.\nWalls could be undermined by a sap. A mine leading to the wall would be dug and once the target had been reached, the wooden supports preventing the tunnel from collapsing would be burned. It would cave in and bring down the structure above. Building a castle on a rock outcrop or surrounding it with a wide, deep moat helped prevent this. A counter-mine could be dug towards the besiegers' tunnel; assuming the two converged, this would result in underground hand-to-hand combat. Mining was so effective that during the siege of Margat in 1285 when the garrison were informed a sap was being dug they surrendered. Battering rams were also used, usually in the form of a tree trunk given an iron cap. They were used to force open the castle gates, although they were sometimes used against walls with less effect.\nAs an alternative to the time-consuming task of creating a breach, an escalade could be attempted to capture the walls with fighting along the walkways behind the battlements. In this instance, attackers would be vulnerable to arrow fire. A safer option for those assaulting a castle was to use a siege tower, sometimes called a belfry. Once ditches around a castle were partially filled in, these wooden, movable towers could be pushed against the curtain wall. As well as offering some protection for those inside, a siege tower could overlook the interior of a castle, giving bowmen an advantageous position from which to unleash missiles.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Together with the Tumen River to its east, and a small portion of Paektu Mountain, the Yalu forms the border between China and North Korea. Its valley has been the scene of several military conflicts in the past centuries. \nIt borders North Korea to the south and China to the north.\nName.\nThe Chinese name \"Yalu\" (\"duck-green\") was first attested during the Tang dynasty. According to the \"Tongdian\" (8th century), the river was named after its color, which resembled that of a mallard's head. The Korean name \"Amnok\" follows the Sino-Korean reading of the same name. In ancient times, the river was known as \"Peishui\" (\"Paesu\", \u6d7f\u6c34) or \"Mazishui\" (\"Majasu\", \u99ac\u8a3e\u6c34).\nHistorically, it was also known by the Korean name of \"Arinarye\" (\uc544\ub9ac\ub098\ub840\uac15, \u963f\u5229\u90a3\u79ae\u6c5f). \"Ari\", a word from Old Korean used to refer to the 'spirituality (\uc2e0\ub839\uc131; \u795e\u9748\u6027) of the sun'. The second component might be related to the Old Korean word for 'river, stream', nari (\ub098\ub9ac, \u5ddd\u7406).\nTwo other theories exist for the name Yalu: one theory is that the name derived from \"Yalu ula\" (&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:MongolUnicode/fonts.css\" /&gt;\u1836\u1820\u182f\u1860&lt;br&gt;\u1860\u182f\u1820) in the Manchu language. The Manchu word \"yalu\" (&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:MongolUnicode/fonts.css\" /&gt;\u1836\u1820\u182f\u1860) means \"the boundary between two countries\". In Mandarin Chinese, phonetically approximates the original Manchu word, but literally means \"duck green\", which was said to have been once the color of the river. The other theory is that the river was named after the combination of its two upper branches, which were called \"\" ( or\" Ap\") and \" ( or \"Rok\"/\"Nok\"\"), respectively.\nRevised Romanization of Korean spelled it (; \"Amnok River\") and Revised Romanization of Hangeul spelled it (; \"Aprok River\").\nGeography.\nFrom above sea level on Paektu Mountain on the China\u2013North Korea border, the river flows south to Hyesan before sweeping north-west to Linjiang and then returning to a more southerly route for a further to empty into Korea Bay between Dandong (China) and Sinuiju (North Korea). The bordering Chinese provinces are Jilin and Liaoning, while the bordering North Korean provinces are North Pyongan, Chagang and Ryanggang.\nThe river is long and receives water from over of land. The Yalu's most significant tributaries are the Changjin (; ), the Hochon (; ), the Togro (; ) rivers from Korea and the Ai (or Aihe) () and the Hun () from China. The river is not easily navigable for most of its length. Most of the river freezes during winter and can be crossed on foot.\nThe depth of the Yalu River varies from some of the more shallow parts on the eastern side in Hyesan () to the deeper parts of the river near the Yellow Sea (). The estuary is the site of the Amrok River estuary Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International.\nAbout 205 islands are on the Yalu. A 1962 border treaty between North Korea and China split the islands according to which ethnic group was living on each island. North Korea possesses 127 and China 78. Due to the division criteria, some islands such as Hwanggumpyong Island belong to North Korea, but abut the Chinese side of the river.\nHistory.\nImperial era.\nThe river basin is the site where the ancient Korean kingdom of Goguryeo rose to power. Many former fortresses are located along the river and the former capital of that kingdom was situated at what is now the medium-sized city of Ji'an along the Yalu, a site rich in Goguryeo-era relics.\nWihwa Island on the river is historically famous as the place where, in 1388, General Yi Songgye (later Taejo of Joseon) decided to turn back his army southward to Kaesong in the first of a series of revolts that eventually led to the establishment of the Joseon dynasty.\nAccording to one scholar, the Korean-Chinese border along the Yalu River is the longest unchanged international border in history, lasting for at least 1,000 years.\nThe river has been the site of several battles because of its strategic location between Korea and China, including:\nThe southern side of the river was heavily industrialized during the period of Japanese rule (1910\u20131945), and by 1945 almost 20% of Japan's total industrial output originated in Korea.\nKorean War.\nDuring the Korean War, the movement of United Nations troops approaching the river, despite repeated warnings by China not to, precipitated massive Chinese intervention from around Dandong. In the course of the conflict every bridge across the river except one was destroyed. The one remaining bridge was the Sino-Korean Friendship Bridge connecting Sinuiju, North Korea to Dandong, China. During the war the valley surrounding the western end of the river also became the focal point of a series of dogfights for air supremacy over North Korea, earning the nickname \"MiG Alley\" in reference to the MiG-15 fighters flown by the combined North Korean, Chinese, and Soviet forces. As UN forces during the Korean War advanced toward the Yalu, China under Chairman Mao Zedong entered the war on the side of North Korea under Kim Il-sung.\nTo promote the morale, in 1950 Ma Fuyao (\u9ebb\u6276\u6447) and Zheng L\u00fccheng (\u90d1\u5f8b\u6210) composed the Chinese military anthem \"The Chinese People's Volunteers Army Song\" (\u4e2d\u56fd\u4eba\u6c11\u5fd7\u613f\u519b\u6218\u6b4c), which mentioned the Yalu River, and later the song became one of the most popular and representative musical expressions of the Chinese intervention in Korea. It sings:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u96c4\u8d73\u8d73, \u6c14\u6602\u6602, \u8de8\u8fc7\u9e2d\u7eff\u6c5f. &lt;br&gt;\n\u4fdd\u548c\u5e73, \u536b\u7956\u56fd, \u5c31\u662f\u4fdd\u5bb6\u4e61. &lt;br&gt;\nMarching bold with heads held high, we crossed the Yalu wide.&lt;br&gt;\nTo guard the peace and homeland dear is home we must defend with pride.\nAfter the war.\nThe river has frequently been crossed by North Koreans fleeing to China since the early 1990s, although the Tumen River remains the most-used way for such refugees.\nEconomy.\nThe river is important for hydroelectric power, and one of the largest hydroelectric dams in Asia is in Sup'ung Dam, high and over long, located upstream from Sinuiju, North Korea. The dam has created an artificial lake over a portion of the river, called Supung Lake. In addition, the river is used for transportation, particularly of lumber from its forested banks. The river provides fish for the local population. Downstream of Sup'ung is the Taipingwan Dam. Upstream of Sup'ung is the Unbong Dam. Both dams produce hydroelectric power, as well.\nIn the river delta upstream from Dandong and adjacent to Hushan are several North Korean villages. Economic conditions in these villages have been described as poor, without access to electricity.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "49562", "revid": "41046791", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49562", "title": "Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu", "text": "Leader of Romania from 1965 to 1989\nNicolae Ceau\u0219escu (26 January [O.S. 13 January] 1918 \u2013 25 December 1989) was a Romanian communist politician who led the Socialist Republic of Romania. He served as General Secretary of the Romanian Communist Party from 1965 to 1989 and as the first president of Romania from 1974 to 1989.\nBorn in Scornice\u0219ti, Ceau\u0219escu joined the banned Romanian Communist Party in his teens and was repeatedly imprisoned under the pre-war and wartime regimes for his communist activism. After World War\u00a0II, he rose through the party ranks under Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, the country\u2019s Stalinist leader, whom he succeeded as general secretary.\nUpon taking power, Ceau\u0219escu eased press censorship and condemned the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in his speech of 21 August 1968, which resulted in a surge in popularity. However, this period of liberalisation was brief, as his regime soon became totalitarian and was widely considered to be one of the most repressive in the Eastern Bloc. His secret police, the Securitate, was responsible for mass surveillance as well as severe repression and human rights abuses within the country, and controlled the media and press. Ceau\u0219escu's attempts to implement policies that would lead to a significant growth of the population led to a growing number of illegal abortions and increased the number of orphans in state institutions. Economic mismanagement due to failed oil ventures during the 1970s led to very significant foreign debts for Romania. In 1982, Ceau\u0219escu directed the government to export much of the country's agricultural and industrial production in an effort to repay these debts. His cult of personality experienced unprecedented elevation, followed by the deterioration of foreign relations, even with the Soviet Union.\nBy the end of 1989, mounting discontent over the state of the nation and Ceau\u0219escu\u2019s totalitarian rule erupted into the Romanian Revolution. Ceau\u0219escu perceived the demonstrations in Timi\u0219oara as a threat and ordered military forces to open fire on 17 December, causing many deaths and injuries. The demonstrations reached the capital Bucharest, forcing Ceau\u0219escu and his wife Elena to flee in a helicopter, but were soon captured after the armed forces turned on them. After being tried and convicted of economic sabotage and genocide, both were sentenced to death, and they were immediately executed by firing squad on 25 December, bringing an end to four decades of communist rule in Romania. The 21st century public polls have shown Romanians to be holding mostly positive view about his rule. A 2018 poll found 64% of people to have a good opinion of him.\nEarly life.\nCeau\u0219escu was born in the small village of Scornice\u0219ti, Olt County, being the third of nine children of a poor peasant family (see Ceau\u0219escu family). Based on his birth certificate, he was born on 23 January\u00a0[O.S. 10 January]\u00a01918, rather than the official 26 January\u00a0[O.S. 13 January]\u00a01918\u2014his birth was registered with a three-day delay, which later led to confusion. According to the information recorded in his autobiography, Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu was born on 26 January 1918. His father Andru\u021b\u0103 (1886\u20131969) owned of agricultural land and a few sheep, and Nicolae supplemented his large family's income through tailoring. He studied at the village school until the age of 11, when he left for Bucharest. The Olt County Service of National Archives holds excerpts from the catalogs of Scornice\u0219ti Primary School, which certifies that Nicolae A. Ceau\u0219escu passed the first grade with an average of 8.26 and the second grade with an average of 8.18, ranking third, in a class in which 25 students were enrolled. Journalist C\u0103t\u0103lin Gruia claimed in 2007 that he ran away from his supposedly extremely religious, abusive and strict father. He initially lived with his sister, Niculina Rusescu.\nHe became an apprentice shoemaker, working in the workshop of Alexandru S\u0103ndulescu, a shoemaker who was an active member in the then-illegal Communist Party. Ceau\u0219escu was soon involved in the Communist Party activities (becoming a member in early 1932), but as a teenager he was given only small tasks. He was first arrested in 1933, at the age of 15, for street fighting during a strike and again, in 1934, first for collecting signatures on a petition protesting against the trial of railway workers and twice more for other similar activities. By the mid-1930s, he had been in missions in Bucharest, Craiova, C\u00e2mpulung and R\u00e2mnicu V\u00e2lcea, being arrested several times.\nThe profile file from the secret police, Siguran\u021ba Statului, named him \"a dangerous Communist agitator\" and \"distributor of Communist and antifascist propaganda materials\". For these charges, he was convicted on 6 June 1936 by the Bra\u0219ov Tribunal to two years in prison, an additional six months for contempt of court, and one year of forced residence in Scornice\u0219ti. He spent most of his sentence in Doftana Prison. While out of jail in 1939, he met Lenu\u021ba (Elena) Petrescu, whom he married in 1947 and who would play an increasing role in his political life over the years.\nSoon after being freed, he was arrested again and sentenced for \"conspiracy against social order\", spending the time during the war in prisons and internment camps: Jilava (1940), Caransebe\u0219 (1942), V\u0103c\u0103re\u0219ti (1943), and T\u00e2rgu Jiu (1943).\nIn 1943, he was transferred to T\u00e2rgu Jiu internment camp, where he shared a cell with Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, becoming his prot\u00e9g\u00e9.\nEnticed with substantial bribes, the camp authorities gave the Communist prisoners much freedom in running their cell block, provided they did not attempt to break out of prison. At T\u00e2rgu Jiu, Gheorghiu-Dej ran \"self-criticism sessions\" where various Party members had to confess before the other Party members to misunderstanding the teachings of Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Vladimir Lenin, and Joseph Stalin as interpreted by Gheorghiu-Dej; journalist Edward Behr claimed that Ceau\u0219escu's role in these \"self-criticism sessions\" was that of the enforcer, the young man allegedly beating those Party members who refused to go with or were insufficiently enthusiastic about the \"self-criticism\" sessions. These \"self-criticism sessions\" not only helped to cement Gheorghiu-Dej's control over the Party, but also endeared his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Ceau\u0219escu to him. It was Ceau\u0219escu's time at T\u00e2rgu Jiu that marked the beginning of his rise to power. After World War II, when Romania was beginning to fall under Soviet influence, Ceau\u0219escu served as secretary of the Union of Communist Youth (1944\u20131945).\nAfter the Communists seized power in Romania in 1947, and under the patronage of Gheorghiu-Dej, Ceau\u0219escu was elected a member of the Great National Assembly, the new legislative body of communist Romania.\nIn May 1948, Ceau\u0219escu was appointed Secretary of the Ministry of Agriculture, and in March 1949 he was promoted to the position of Deputy Minister. From the Ministry of Agriculture and with no military experience, he was made Deputy Minister in charge of the armed forces, holding the rank of Major General. Later, promoted to the rank of lieutenant general, he became First Deputy to the defence ministry and head of the Army's Higher Political Directorate.\nIn 1952, Gheorghiu-Dej brought him onto the Central Committee months after the party's \"Muscovite faction\" led by Ana Pauker had been purged. In the late 1940s-early 1950s, the Party had been divided into the \"home communists\" headed by Gheorghiu-Dej who remained inside Romania prior to 1944 and the \"Muscovites\" who had gone into exile in the Soviet Union. With the partial exception of Poland, where the Polish October crisis of 1956 brought to power the previously imprisoned \"home communist\" W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka, Romania was the only Eastern European nation where the \"home communists\" triumphed over the \"Muscovites\". In the rest of the Soviet bloc, there were a series of purges in this period that led to the \"home communists\" being executed or imprisoned. Like his patron Gheorghiu-Dej, Ceau\u0219escu was a \"home communist\" who benefited from the fall of the \"Muscovites\" in 1952. In 1954, Ceau\u0219escu became a full member of the Politburo, effectively granting him one of the highest positions of power in the country.\nRole in the collectivisation process.\nA high-ranking official in the agricultural and defence ministries, Ceau\u0219escu had an important role in the forced collectivisation; according to Romanian Workers' Party's own data, between 1949 and 1952 there were over 80,000 arrests of peasants, with 30,000 receiving prison sentences. One example of these arrests is the uprising of Vadu Ro\u0219ca (Vrancea county), which opposed the state programme of expropriation of private holdings, where military units opened fire on the rebelling peasants, killing 9 and wounding 48. Ceau\u0219escu personally led the investigation which resulted in 18 peasants being imprisoned for \"rebellion\" and \"conspiring against social order\".\nLeadership of Romania.\nWhen Gheorghiu-Dej died on 19 March 1965, Ceau\u0219escu was not the obvious successor, despite his closeness to the longtime leader. But widespread infighting by older and more connected officials led the Politburo to choose Ceau\u0219escu as a compromise candidate. He was elected general secretary on 22 March 1965, three days after Gheorghiu-Dej's death.\nOne of Ceau\u0219escu\u2019s first major acts after becoming general secretary in March 1965 was to restore the party\u2019s historical name, changing it from the Romanian Workers\u2019 Party back to the Communist Party of Romania at the party\u2019s ninth congress later that year. Later that year, a new constitution\u2014adopted by the Great National Assembly in August 1965\u2014renamed the country the Socialist Republic of Romania, replacing the former designation of \"Romanian People\u2019s Republic\". In December 1967, Ceau\u0219escu consolidated his power when he became President of the State Council, thereby assuming the role of head of state. His regime maintained strict political control, and thousands of dissenters were imprisoned or, in some cases, confined in psychiatric institutions.\nInitially, Ceau\u0219escu became a popular figure, both in Romania and in the West, because of his independent foreign policy, which challenged the authority of the Soviet Union. In the 1960s, he eased press censorship and ended Romania's active participation in the Warsaw Pact, but Romania formally remained a member. He refused to take part in the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia by Warsaw Pact forces and even actively and openly condemned it in his 21 August 1968 speech. He travelled to Prague a week before the invasion to offer moral support to his Czechoslovak counterpart, Alexander Dub\u010dek. Although the Soviet Union largely tolerated Ceau\u0219escu's recalcitrance, his seeming independence from Moscow earned Romania maverick status within the Eastern Bloc.\nAll of Ceau\u0219escu's economic, foreign, and demographic policies were meant to achieve his ultimate goal: turning Romania into one of the world's great powers.\nDuring the following years, Ceau\u0219escu pursued an open policy towards the United States and Western Europe. Romania was the first Warsaw Pact country to recognise West Germany, the first to join the International Monetary Fund, and the first to receive a US president, Richard Nixon. In 1971, Romania became a member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Romania and Yugoslavia were also the only Eastern European countries that entered into trade agreements with the European Economic Community before the fall of the Eastern Bloc.\nA series of official visits to Western countries (including the US, France, the United Kingdom, Spain and Australia) helped Ceau\u0219escu to present himself as a reforming Communist, pursuing an independent foreign policy within the Soviet Bloc. He also became eager to be seen as an enlightened international statesman, able to mediate in international conflicts, and to gain international respect for Romania. Ceau\u0219escu negotiated in international affairs, such as the opening of US relations with China in 1969 and the visit of Egyptian president Anwar Sadat to Israel in 1977. In addition, Romania was the only country in the world to maintain normal diplomatic relations with both Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation. In 1980, Romania participated in the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow with its other Soviet bloc allies, but in 1984 was one of the few Communist countries to participate in the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles (going on to win 53 medals, trailing only the US and West Germany in the overall count) while most of the Eastern Bloc's nations boycotted this event.\nCeau\u0219escu refused to implement measures of economic liberalism. The evolution of his regime followed the path begun by Gheorghiu-Dej. He continued with the programme of intensive industrialisation aimed at the economic self-sufficiency of the country which since 1959 had already doubled industrial production and had reduced the peasant population from 78% at the end of the 1940s to 61% in 1966 and 49% by 1971. However, for Romania, like other Eastern People's Republics, industrialisation did not mean a total social break with the countryside. The peasants returned periodically to the villages or resided in them, commuting daily to the city in a practice called naveta. This allowed Romanians to act as peasants and workers at the same time.\nUniversities were also founded in smaller Romanian towns, which served to train qualified professionals such as engineers, economists, planners or jurists necessary for the development projects of the country. Romanian healthcare also achieved improvements and recognition by the World Health Organization (WHO), whose director general Marcolino Candau in May 1969 visited Romania and declared that the visits of WHO staff to various Romanian hospital establishments had left an extraordinarily good impression.\nThe social and economic transformations resulted in improved living conditions for Romanians. Economic growth allowed for higher salaries which, combined with the benefits offered by the state (free medical care, pensions, free universal education at all levels, etc.) were a leap compared to the pre-WWII situation of the Romanian population. Certain extra retributions were allowed for the peasants, who started to produce more.\nDecree 770.\nIn October 1966, in an attempt to reverse the Romania's low birth and fertility rates, Ceau\u0219escu issued Decree 770 to restrict abortion and contraception. The government targeted rising divorce rates and made divorce more difficult \u2013 marriages could only be dissolved in exceptional cases. By the late 1960s, the population began to swell. In turn, a new problem was created, child abandonment, which swelled the orphanage population (see 1980s\u20131990s Romanian orphans phenomenon). Many of the children in these orphanages suffered mental and physical deficiencies (see Cighid).\nMeasures to encourage reproduction included financial motivations for families who bore children, guaranteed maternity leave, and childcare support for mothers who returned to work, work protection for women, and extensive access to medical control in all stages of pregnancy, as well as after it. Medical control was seen as one of the most productive effects of the law, since all women who became pregnant were under the care of a qualified medical practitioner, even in rural areas. In some cases, if a woman was unable to visit a medical office, a doctor would visit her home. Mothers of at least five children were entitled to receive significant benefits, while mothers of at least ten children were declared \"heroine mothers\" by the Romanian state.\nSpeech of 21 August 1968.\nCeau\u0219escu's speech of 21 August 1968 represented the apogee of Ceau\u0219escu's rule. It marked the highest point in Ceau\u0219escu's popularity, when he openly condemned the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia.\nJuly Theses.\nCeau\u0219escu visited China, North Korea, Mongolia and North Vietnam in 1971. He took great interest in the idea of total national transformation as embodied in the programmes of North Korea's \"Juche\" and China's Cultural Revolution. He was also inspired by the personality cults of North Korea's Kim Il Sung and China's Mao Zedong. Journalist Edward Behr claimed that Ceau\u0219escu admired both Mao and Kim as leaders who not only totally dominated their nations but had also used totalitarian methods coupled with significant ultra-nationalism mixed in with communism in order to transform both China and North Korea into major world powers. Furthermore, that Kim and even more so Mao had broken free of Soviet control were additional sources of admiration for Ceau\u0219escu. According to British journalist Edward Behr, Elena Ceau\u0219escu allegedly bonded with Mao's wife, Jiang Qing. Behr wrote that the possibility that what Ceau\u0219escu had seen in both China and North Korea were \"vast Potemkin villages for the hoodwinking of gullible foreign guests\" was something that never seemed to have crossed his mind. Shortly after returning home, he began to emulate North Korea's system. North Korean books on \"Juche\" were translated into Romanian and widely distributed inside the country.\nOn 6 July 1971, he delivered a speech before the executive committee of the Romanian Communist Party. This quasi-Maoist speech, which came to be known as the July Theses, contained seventeen proposals. Among these were: continuous growth in the \"leading role\" of the Party; improvement of Party education and of mass political action; youth participation on large construction projects as part of their \"patriotic work\"; an intensification of political-ideological education in schools and universities, as well as in children's, youth and student associations; and an expansion of political propaganda, orienting radio and television shows to this end, as well as publishing houses, theatres and cinemas, opera, ballet, artists' unions, promoting a \"militant, revolutionary\" character in artistic productions. Gheorghiu-Dej's process of removing Stalinist policies and Stalin's cult of personality between 1956 and 1965 was condemned and an index of banned books and authors was re-established.\nThe Theses heralded the beginning of a \"mini cultural revolution\" in Romania, launching a Neo-Stalinist offensive against cultural autonomy, reaffirming an ideological basis for literature that, in theory, the Party had hardly abandoned. Although presented in terms of \"Socialist Humanism\", the Theses in fact marked a return to the strict guidelines of Socialist Realism and attacks on non-compliant intellectuals. Strict ideological conformity in the humanities and social sciences was demanded.\nIn a 1972 speech, Ceau\u0219escu stated he wanted \"a certain blending of party and state activities\u00a0... in the long run we shall witness an ever closer blending of the activities of the party, state and other social bodies\". In practice, a number of joint party-state organisations were founded such as the Council for Socialist Education and Culture, which had no precise counterpart in any of the other communist states of Eastern Europe, and the Romanian Communist Party was embedded into the daily life of the nation in a way that it never had been before. In 1974, the party programme of the Romanian Communist Party announced that structural changes in society were insufficient to create a full socialist consciousness in the people, and that a full socialist consciousness could only come about if the entire population was made aware of socialist values that guided society. The Communist Party was to be the agency that would so \"enlighten\" the population, and in the words of the British historian Richard Crampton, \"the party would merge state and society, the individual and the collective, and would promote 'the ever more organic participation of party members in the entire social life'\".\nPresident of the Socialist Republic of Romania.\nCeau\u0219escu had been head of state since 1967, though nominally only as first among equals, deriving his real power from his status as party leader. However, in 1974 Ceau\u0219escu introduced a full-fledged executive presidency as the nation's top decision-maker. He was first elected to this post in 1974 and would be reelected every five years until 1989.\nAs President, he was empowered to carry out those functions of the State Council that did not require plenums. He also appointed and dismissed the president of the Supreme Court and the prosecutor general whenever the legislature was not in session. In practice, from 1974 onwards Ceau\u0219escu frequently ruled by decree. Over time, he usurped many powers and functions that nominally were vested in the State Council as a whole.\nEffectively, Ceau\u0219escu now held all governing power in the nation; virtually all party and state institutions were subordinated to his will. The principles of democratic centralism, combined with the legislature's infrequent sessions (it sat in full session only twice a year) meant that for all intents and purposes, his decisions had the force of law.\nOil embargo, strike and foreign relations.\nStarting with the 1973\u20131974 Arab oil embargo against the West, a period of prolonged high oil prices set in that characterised the rest of the 1970s. Romania as a major oil equipment producer greatly benefited from the high oil prices of the 1970s, which led Ceau\u0219escu to embark on an ambitious plan to invest heavily in oil-refining plants. Ceau\u0219escu's plan was to make Romania into Europe's number one oil refiner not only of its own oil, but also of oil from Middle Eastern states such as Iraq and Iran, and then to sell all of the refined oil at a profit on the Rotterdam spot market. As Romania lacked the money to build the necessary oil refining plants and Ceau\u0219escu chose to spend the windfall from the high oil prices on aid to the Third World in an attempt to buy Romania international influence, Ceau\u0219escu borrowed heavily from Western banks on the assumption that when the loans came due, the profits from the sales of the refined oil would be more than enough to pay off the loans. Meanwhile, Romania also imported Soviet oil, but the Soviets refused to grant Romania the preferential oil pricing that Warsaw Pact states received. The 1977 earthquake which destroyed much of Bucharest led to delays in the oil plan. By the time the oil refining plants were finished in the early 1980s, a slump in oil prices had set in, leading to major financial problems for Romania.\nIn August 1977 over 30,000 miners went on strike in the Jiu River valley complaining of low pay and poor working conditions. The Jiu valley miners' strike was the most significant expression of opposition to Ceau\u0219escu's rule prior to the late 1980s. The striking miners were inspired by similar strikes along Poland's Baltic coast in December 1970, and just as in Poland in 1970, the striking Romanian miners demanded face-to-face negotiations with their nation's leader. When Ceau\u0219escu appeared before the miners on the third day of the strike, he was greeted (in the words of the British historian Richard Crampton) \"once again , with cries of 'Down with the Red Bourgeoisie!'\". Ceau\u0219escu ultimately negotiated a compromise solution to the strike. In the years after the strike, a number of its leaders died of accidents and \"premature disease\". Rumors emerged that had doctors give the strike leaders 5-minute chest X-rays to ensure the development of cancer.\nHe continued to follow an independent policy in foreign relations\u2014for example, in 1984, Romania was one of few communist states (notably including the People's Republic of China and Yugoslavia) to take part in the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, despite a Soviet-led boycott. The Socialist Republic of Romania was also the first of the Eastern Bloc nations to have official relations with the Western bloc and the European Community: an agreement including Romania in the Community's Generalised System of Preferences was signed in 1974 and an Agreement on Industrial Products was signed in 1980. On 4 April 1975, Ceau\u0219escu visited Japan and met with Emperor Hirohito. In June 1978, Ceau\u0219escu made a state visit to the UK where a \u00a3200m licensing agreement was signed between the Romanian government and British Aerospace for the production of more than eighty BAC One-Eleven aircraft. The deal was said at the time to be the biggest between two countries involving civil aircraft. This was the first state visit by a Communist head of state to the UK, and Ceau\u0219escu was given an honorary knighthood by the Queen, which was revoked on the day before his death in 1989. Similarly, in 1983, US vice president George H. W. Bush and in 1985 US Secretary of State George Shultz also praised the Romanian dictator.\nPacepa defection.\nIn 1978, Ion Mihai Pacepa, a senior member of the Romanian political police (Securitate, State Security), defected to the US. A two-star general, he was the highest-ranking defector from the Eastern Bloc during the Cold War. His defection was a powerful blow against the administration, forcing Ceau\u0219escu to overhaul Romania's state security architecture. Pacepa's 1986 book, \"Red Horizons: Chronicles of a Communist Spy Chief\" (), claimed to expose details of Ceau\u0219escu's government activities, such as massive spying on American industry and elaborate efforts to rally Western political support.\nSystematisation: demolition and reconstruction.\nSystematisation () was the programme of urban planning carried out under Ceau\u0219escu's regime. After a visit to North Korea in 1971, Ceau\u0219escu was impressed by the \"Juche\" ideology of that country, and began a major campaign shortly afterwards.\nBeginning in 1974, the programme consisted largely of the demolition and reconstruction of existing hamlets, villages, towns and cities, in whole or in part, with the stated goal of turning Romania into a \"multilaterally developed socialist society\". The policy largely consisted in the mass construction of high-density blocks of flats ().\nDuring the 1980s, Ceau\u0219escu became obsessed with building himself a palace of unprecedented proportions, along with an equally grandiose neighborhood, Centrul Civic, to accompany it. The mass demolitions that occurred in the 1980s under which an overall area of eight square kilometres of the historic centre of Bucharest were leveled, including monasteries, churches, synagogues, a hospital and a noted Art Deco sports stadium, in order to make way for the imposing Centrul Civic and the House of the Republic, now officially renamed the Palace of Parliament, were the most extreme manifestation of this policy.\nIn 1988, a massive rural resettlement effort began.\nForeign debt.\nCeau\u0219escu's political independence from the Soviet Union and his protest against the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 drew the interest of Western powers, whose governments briefly believed that he was an anti-Soviet maverick and hoped to create a schism in the Warsaw Pact by funding him. Ceau\u0219escu did not realise that the funding was not always favourable, borrowing heavily (more than $13\u00a0billion) from the West to finance economic development, with these loans ultimately devastating the country's finances. He also secured a deal for cheap oil from Iran, but the deal fell through after the Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was overthrown in 1979 during the Iranian Revolution.\nIn an attempt to correct this, Ceau\u0219escu decided to repay Romania's foreign debts. He organised the 1986 military referendum and managed to change the constitution, adding a clause that barred Romania from taking foreign loans in the future. According to official results, the referendum yielded a nearly unanimous \"yes\" vote.\nRomania's record\u2014having all of its debts to commercial banks paid off in full\u2014has not been matched by any other heavily indebted country in the world. The policy to repay\u2014and, in multiple cases, prepay\u2014Romania's external debt became the dominant policy in the late 1980s. The result was economic stagnation throughout the 1980s and, towards the end of the decade, an economic crisis. The country's industrial capacity was eroded as equipment grew obsolete and energy intensity increased, and the standard of living deteriorated significantly. Draconian restrictions were imposed on household energy use to ensure adequate supplies for industry. Convertible currency exports were promoted at all costs and imports severely reduced. In 1988, real GDP contracted by 0.5%, mostly due to a decline in industrial output caused by significantly increased material costs. Despite the 1988 decline, the net foreign balance reached its decade-long peak (9.5% of GDP). In 1989, GDP slumped by a further 5.8% due to growing shortages and the increasingly obsolete capital stock. By March 1989, virtually all external debt had been repaid, including all medium- and long-term external debt. The remaining amount, totalling less than 1 million, consisted of short-term credits (mainly short-term export credits granted by Romania). A 1989 decree legally prohibited Romanian entities from contracting external debt. The CIA World Factbook edition of 1990 listed Romania's external debt as \"none\" as of mid-1989.\n1984 failed coup d'\u00e9tat attempt.\nA tentative coup d'\u00e9tat planned in October 1984 failed when the military unit assigned to carry out the plan was sent to harvest maize instead.\n1987 Bra\u0219ov rebellion.\nRomanian workers began to mobilise against the economic policies of Ceau\u0219escu. Spontaneous labour conflicts, limited in scale, took place in major industrial strongholds such as Cluj-Napoca (November 1986) and the Nicolina platform in Ia\u0219i (February 1987), culminating in a massive strike in Bra\u0219ov. The draconian measures taken by Ceau\u0219escu involved reducing energy and food consumption, as well as lowering workers' incomes, leading to what political scientist Vladimir Tism\u0103neanu called \"generalised dissatisfaction\".\nOver 20,000 workers and a number of townspeople marched against economic policies in Socialist Romania and Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu's policies of rationing of basic foodstuffs, rationing electricity and central heating.\nThe first protests began practically on 14 November 1987, at the 440 \"Molds\" Section of the Red Flag truck company. Initially, the protests were for basic needs: \"We want food and heating!\", \"We want our money!\", \"We want food for the children!\", \"We want light and heat!\" and \"We want bread without a card!\" Next to the County Hospital, they sang the anthem of the revolution of 1848, . Upon arriving in the city centre, thousands of workers from the Tractorul Bra\u0219ov and Hidromecanica factories, pupils, students, and others joined the demonstration. From this moment on, the protest became political. Participants later claimed to have chanted slogans such as \"Down with Ceau\u0219escu!\", \"Down with communism!\", \"Down with the dictatorship!\" or \"Down with the tyrant!\". During the march, members of the Securitate disguised as workers infiltrated the demonstrators, or remained on the sidelines as spectators, photographing or even filming.\nBy dusk, Securitate forces and the military surrounded the city centre and disbanded the revolt by force. Some 300 protesters were arrested, and, in order to hide the political nature of the Bra\u0219ov uprising, tried for disturbing the peace and \"outrage against morals\".\nThose under investigation were beaten and tortured, 61 receiving sentences ranging from 6 months to 3 years in prison, including sentences to be carried out working at various state enterprises across in the country. Although many previous party meetings had called for the death penalty to set an example, the regime was eager to downplay the uprising as \"isolated cases of hooliganism\". Protesters were sentenced to deportation, with compulsory residence arranged in other cities, despite such measures having been repealed as far back as the late 1950s. The entire trial lasted only an hour and a half.\nA few days after the workers' revolt, C\u0103t\u0103lin Bia, a student at the Faculty of Forestry, sat in front of the canteen with a placard that read: \"The arrested workers must not die\". He was joined by colleagues Lucian Silaghi and Horia \u0218erban. The three were arrested immediately. Subsequently, graffiti in solidarity with the workers' revolt appeared on the campus, and some students distributed manifestos. Security teams conducted a total of seven arrests. Those arrested were investigated, expelled from the faculty, returned to their home localities and placed under strict supervision, along with their families.\nRomani minority rights.\nUnder the Ceau\u0219escu regime, Romani people in Romania were largely neglected as an ethnic group. They were not listed among the \"co-inhabiting nationalities\", preventing them from gaining any collective government representation.\nHowever, during the late 1970s and early 1980s the regime conducted a sedentarisation campaign for nomadic and semi-nomadic Romani, providing them with dwellings and guaranteeing them jobs. Although this led to some displacement of Romanis from counties with a large nomadic population, historians consider it a social measure rather that an ethnically-motivated policy. The systematisation policy provided urban Romanies with better living conditions, as many were moved from insalubrious neighbourhoods at the edges of towns into newly built blocks of flats, however it had negative effects on the cohesion of Romani communities.\nDedicated policies for the Romani community began to be implemented in 1977. A government report from 1983 lists some of these policies: the authorities made land available to them and assisted them in the procurement of building materials for houses; many were given jobs; those lacking official identification were registered at the civil status office; measures were taken to legalise marriages, to send children to school, to enlist men for military services and to supervise their hygiene. The report however notes that a significant part of the Romani population resisted these policies, thus the social integration of the community within the Romanian society was still lagging behind.\nRevolution.\nIn November 1989, the XIVth Congress of the Romanian Communist Party (PCR) saw Ceau\u0219escu, then aged 71, re-elected for another five years as leader of the PCR. During the Congress, Ceau\u0219escu made a speech denouncing the anti-Communist revolutions happening throughout the rest of Eastern Europe. The following month, Ceau\u0219escu's government itself collapsed after a series of violent events in Timi\u0219oara and Bucharest.\nCzechoslovak President Gust\u00e1v Hus\u00e1k's resignation on 10 December 1989 amounted to the fall of the Communist regime in Czechoslovakia, leaving Ceau\u0219escu's Romania as the only remaining hard-line Communist regime in the Warsaw Pact.\nTimi\u0219oara.\nDemonstrations in the city of Timi\u0219oara were triggered by the government-sponsored attempt to evict L\u00e1szl\u00f3 T\u0151k\u00e9s, an ethnic Hungarian pastor, accused by the government of inciting ethnic hatred. Members of his ethnic Hungarian congregation surrounded his apartment in a show of support.\nRomanian students spontaneously joined the demonstration, which soon lost nearly all connection to its initial cause and became a more general anti-government demonstration. Regular military forces, police, and the Securitate fired on demonstrators on 17 December 1989, killing and injuring men, women, and children.\nOn 18 December 1989, Ceau\u0219escu departed for a state visit to Iran, leaving the duty of crushing the Timi\u0219oara revolt to his subordinates and his wife. Upon his return to Romania on the evening of 20 December, the situation became even more tense, and he gave a televised speech from the TV studio inside the Central Committee Building (CC Building), in which he spoke about the events at Timi\u0219oara in terms of an \"interference of foreign forces in Romania's internal affairs\" and an \"external aggression on Romania's sovereignty\".\nThe country, which had little to no information of the events transpiring in Timi\u0219oara from the national media, learned about the revolt from anti-communist radio stations that broadcast news in the Eastern Bloc throughout the Cold War (such as Voice of America and Radio Free Europe) and by word of mouth. On the next day, 21 December, Ceau\u0219escu staged a mass meeting in Bucharest. Official media presented it as a \"spontaneous movement of support for Ceau\u0219escu\", emulating the 1968 meeting in which he had spoken against the invasion of Czechoslovakia by Warsaw Pact forces.\nOverthrow.\nSpeech on 21 December 1989.\nThe mass meeting of 21 December, held in what is now Revolution Square, began like many of Ceau\u0219escu's speeches over the years. He spoke of the achievements of the \"Socialist revolution\" and Romania's \"multi-laterally developed Socialist society\". He also blamed the Timi\u0219oara riots on \"fascist agitators who want to destroy socialism\".\nBut Ceau\u0219escu had misjudged the crowd's mood. Roughly eight minutes into his speech, several people began jeering and booing, and others began chanting \"Timi\u0219oara!\" He tried to silence them by raising his right hand and calling for the crowd's attention before order was temporarily restored, then proceeded to announce social benefit reforms that included raising the national minimum wage by 200 lei per month to a total of 2,200 per month by 1 January. Images of Ceau\u0219escu's facial expression as the crowd began to boo and heckle him were among the most widely broadcast of the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe.\nFailing to control the crowd, the Ceau\u0219escus took cover inside the building that housed the Central Committee of the Romanian Communist Party. The rest of the day saw an open revolt of Bucharest's population, which had assembled in University Square and confronted the police and army at barricades. But the rioters were no match for the military apparatus concentrated in Bucharest, which cleared the streets by midnight and arrested hundreds of people in the process.\nFlight on 22 December.\nBy the morning of 22\u00a0December\u00a01989, protests had spread to most major cities across Romania. The death of Defence Minister Vasile Milea, announced by state media as a suicide, caused confusion and anger within the armed forces and the public. Ceau\u0219escu convened an emergency meeting of the Political Executive Committee and assumed direct command of the army, but many soldiers and officers defected to the revolution. Later that day he attempted to address the crowd assembled outside the Central Committee building in Bucharest, but was shouted down as demonstrators stormed the headquarters. Ceau\u0219escu, his wife Elena, and several aides escaped by helicopter from the roof shortly before protesters overran the building. The Romanian Communist Party collapsed soon afterward and has never been re-established.\nEarly reports in the Western press claimed that tens of thousands of people had been killed by Securitate forces during the uprising, with some newspapers citing figures of up to 64,000 fatalities across Romania. The Hungarian military attach\u00e9 in Bucharest expressed doubt over these figures, noting that such numbers would have been logistically impossible. In the weeks following Ceau\u0219escu\u2019s overthrow, hospitals across the country reported a death toll of fewer than 1,000, a figure broadly supported by later academic research. Of these, only 306 are documented to have died while Ceau\u0219escu was still in power.\nDeath.\nCeau\u0219escu and his wife Elena fled the capital with Emil Bobu and Manea M\u0103nescu and flew by helicopter to Ceau\u0219escu's Snagov residence, from which they fled again, this time to T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te. They abandoned the helicopter near T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te, having been ordered to land by the army, which by that time had restricted flying in Romania's airspace. The Ceau\u0219escus were held by the police while the policemen listened to the radio. They were eventually handed over to the army.\nOn Christmas Day, 25 December 1989, the Ceau\u0219escus were tried before a court convened in a small room on orders of the National Salvation Front, Romania's provisional government. They faced charges including illegal gathering of wealth and genocide. Ceau\u0219escu repeatedly denied the court's authority to try him, and asserted he was still legally the President of Romania. At the end of the trial, the Ceau\u0219escus were found guilty and sentenced to death. A soldier standing guard in the proceedings was ordered to take the Ceau\u0219escus outside one by one and shoot them, but the Ceau\u0219escus demanded to die together. The soldiers agreed to this and began to tie their hands behind their backs, which the Ceau\u0219escus protested against, but were powerless to prevent.\nThe Ceau\u0219escus were executed by a group of soldiers: Captain Ionel Boeru, Sergeant-Major Georghin Octavian and Dorin-Marian C\u00eerlan, and five other non-commissioned officers who were recruited from twenty volunteers. Before his sentence was carried out, Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu sang \"The Internationale\" whilst being led towards the wall. The firing squad began shooting as soon as the two were in their positions up against the wall.\nLater that day, the execution was also shown on Romanian television. The hasty show trial and the images of the executed Ceau\u0219escus were videotaped and the footage released in numerous Western countries two days after the execution.\nThe manner in which the trial was conducted has been criticised. However, Ion Iliescu, Romania's provisional president, said in 2009 that the trial was \"quite shameful, but necessary\" in order to end the state of near-anarchy that had gripped the country in the three days since the Ceau\u0219escus fled Bucharest. Similarly, Victor St\u0103nculescu, who had been defence minister before going over to the revolution, said, in 2009, that the alternative would have been seeing the Ceau\u0219escus lynched on the streets of Bucharest.\nThe Ceau\u0219escus were the last people to be executed in Romania before the abolition of capital punishment on 7 January 1990.\nNicolae and Elena Ceau\u0219escu were originally buried in simple graves at Ghencea Cemetery, in Bucharest, on opposite sides of a path; their graves were often decorated with flowers and symbols of communist rule. In April 2007, their son Valentin Ceau\u0219escu lost an appeal for an investigation into whether the graves were genuine. Upon his death in 1996, the younger son, Nicu, was buried nearby in the same cemetery. According to the \"Jurnalul Na\u021bional\", requests were made by the Ceau\u0219escus' daughter, Zoia, and by supporters of their political views, to move their remains to mausoleums or to purpose-built churches. These demands were denied by the government.\nExhumation and reburial.\nOn 21 July 2010, forensic scientists exhumed the bodies to perform DNA tests to prove conclusively that they were indeed the remains of the Ceau\u0219escus. The body believed to be Elena's had decayed too much to allow for a positive identification, but Nicolae was easily identifiable, wearing the bullet-riddled black winter coat he had been wearing during the execution. DNA tests were able to conclusively prove his identity. His family organised a funeral service for the couple, and they were reburied together at Ghencea under a tombstone.\nPolicies.\nA \"Romanian Encyclopedic Dictionary\" entry in 1978 underlines the concept as \"a new, superior, stage in the Socialist development of Romania ... begun by the 1971\u20131975 Five-Year Plan, prolonged over several [succeeding and projected] Five-Year Plans\".\nCeau\u0219ism's main trait was a form of Romanian nationalism, one which arguably propelled Ceau\u0219escu to power in 1965, and probably led the Party leadership under Ion Gheorghe Maurer to select him over the more orthodox Gheorghe Apostol. Although he had previously been a careful supporter of the official lines, Ceau\u0219escu came to embody Romanian society's wish for independence after what many considered years of Soviet directives and purges, during and after the SovRom fiasco. He carried this nationalist option inside the Party, manipulating it against the nominated successor, Apostol. This nationalist policy had more timid precedents: for example, Gheorghiu-Dej had overseen the withdrawal of the Red Army in 1958.\nThis nationalist policy had also engineered the publishing of several works that subverted the Soviet image, no longer glossing over traditional points of tension with the Soviet Union.\nCeau\u0219escu was prepared to take a more decisive step in questioning Soviet policies. In the early years of his rule, he generally relaxed political pressures inside Romanian society, which led to the late 1960s and early 1970s being the most liberal decade in Socialist Romania. Gaining the public's confidence, Ceau\u0219escu took a clear stand against the 1968 crushing of the Prague Spring by Leonid Brezhnev. After a visit from Charles de Gaulle earlier in the same year, during which the French President gave recognition to the incipient maverick, Ceau\u0219escu's public speech in August deeply impressed the population, not only through its themes, but also because, uniquely, it was unscripted. He immediately attracted Western sympathies and backing, which lasted well beyond the 'liberal' phase of his rule; at the same time, the period brought forward the threat of armed Soviet invasion: significantly, many young men inside Romania joined the \"Patriotic Guards\" created on the spur of the moment, in order to meet the perceived threat. President Richard Nixon was invited to Bucharest in 1969, which was the first visit of a US president to a communist country after the start of the Cold War.\nCeau\u0219escu rejected Alexander Dub\u010dek\u2019s reformist programme of \"Socialism with a human face\", considering it incompatible with Romania\u2019s own communist model. Although he condemned the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, Ceau\u0219escu maintained an enduring partnership with Josip Broz Tito\u2019s Yugoslavia, adapting the Titoist doctrine of \u201cindependent socialist development\u201d to Romania\u2019s circumstances. The 1965 constitution renamed the country the Socialist Republic of Romania to emphasize its claim of building socialism free from Moscow\u2019s direction, echoing Yugoslavia\u2019s earlier rebranding in 1963.\nFollowing his 1971 visits to China and North Korea, Ceau\u0219escu issued the \"July Theses\", inspired in part by Maoist and \"Juche\" concepts and signalling a return to strict ideological control. At the Eleventh Party Congress in 1974, cultural policy was formally subordinated to nationalist objectives. The regime promoted Protochronism and Dacianism, encouraging historians to portray the ancient Dacians as precursors of the socialist state, and renamed several cities to reflect Dacian or Roman heritage, such as Cluj-Napoca and Drobeta-Turnu Severin.\nAlthough Ceau\u0219escu pursued an ostensibly independent \u201cnational communist\u201d course, his concentration of power and the pervasive personality cult surrounding him led outside observers to describe his regime as among the most Stalinist in Eastern Europe. Among his most visible admirers was Iosif Constantin Dr\u0103gan, a Romanian-Italian businessman who propagated Dacianist and protochronist ideas that paralleled the regime\u2019s nationalist discourse.\nNicolae Ceau\u0219escu had a major influence on modern-day Romanian populist rhetoric. In the 1970s, a certain rehabilitation of pro-Nazi dictator Ion Antonescu was permitted to take place: while not explicitly condoned by authorities, the pro-regime novelist Marin Preda painted a \"nuanced\" and sympathetic picture of Antonescu in his 1975 work \"Delirul\". The conflict with Hungary over the treatment of the Magyar minority in Romania had several unusual aspects: not only was it a vitriolic argument between two officially Socialist states, it also marked the moment when Hungary, a state behind the Iron Curtain, appealed to the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe for sanctions to be taken against Romania. This meant that the later 1980s were marked by a pronounced anti-Hungarian discourse, which owed more to nationalist tradition than to Marxism, and the ultimate isolation of Romania on the world stage.\nThe strong opposition to Ceau\u0219escu on all forms of \"perestroika\" and \"glasnost\" placed him at odds with Mikhail Gorbachev. He was very displeased when other Warsaw Pact countries decided to try their own versions of Gorbachev's reforms. In particular, he was incensed when Poland's leaders opted for a power-sharing arrangement with the Solidarity trade union. He even went as far as to call for a Warsaw Pact invasion of Poland\u2014a significant reversal, considering how violently he had opposed the invasion of Czechoslovakia 20 years earlier. For his part, Gorbachev made no secret of his distaste for Ceau\u0219escu, whom he called \"the Romanian f\u00fchrer\". At a meeting between the two, Gorbachev upbraided Ceau\u0219escu for his inflexible attitude. \"You are running a dictatorship here\", the Soviet leader warned.\nIn November 1989, at the XIVth and last congress of the PCR, Ceau\u0219escu condemned the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact and suggested that the Soviet Union was repeating its mistake of appeasement towards an aggressive power by growing closer to the United States. This provided an indication of Ceau\u0219escu's fear at the time of both superpowers interfering in Romanian domestic affairs. He also called for the reversal of the Pact's consequences, which would amount to the return of Bessarabia (most of which was then a Soviet republic and since 1991 has been independent Moldova) and northern Bukovina; both of these had been occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940 and again at the end of World War II.\nNon-aligned policy feats.\nCeau\u0219escu was among the most ardent supporters of dimming lingering tensions between different Balkan states, and went as far as to establish friendly relations with the vituperatively anti-communist Regime of the Colonels in Greece to pursue his objectives of cooperation between Balkan countries.\nCeau\u0219escu's Romania was the only Eastern Bloc country that retained diplomatic relations with Israel and did not sever diplomatic relations after Israel's strike on Egypt at the start of the Six-Day War in 1967, to the consternation of the Soviet Union. Ceau\u0219escu made efforts to act as a mediator between the PLO and Israel.\nSimilarly, Romania was the only Eastern Bloc country to attend the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, which had been boycotted by the Soviet Union and its allies in response to the US-led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow.\nCeau\u0219escu's Romania was the only Warsaw Pact country that did not sever diplomatic relations with Chile after Augusto Pinochet seized power in the 1973 coup d'\u00e9tat.\nNicolae Ceau\u0219escu was a close ally and personal friend of dictator Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo). Relations were in fact not just state-to-state, but party-to-party between their respective political machineries, the MPR and the PCR. Many believe that Ceau\u0219escu's death played a role in influencing Mobutu to \"democratise\" Zaire in 1990.\nCeau\u0219escu reduced the size of the Romanian People's Army by 5%, for which he called the 1986 mock referendum in which 100% voted in favour. In line with his policy of keeping a fa\u00e7ade of \"popular democracy\", he also ordered large rallies for peace to be held.\nMoldavian Soviet Socialist Republic.\nIn August 1976, Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu was the first high-level Romanian visitor to Moldavian SSR since World War II. In December 1976, at one of his meetings in Bucharest, Ivan Bodiul said that \"the good relationship was initiated by Ceau\u0219escu's visit to Soviet Moldova\".\nPersonality cult and totalitarianism.\nCeau\u0219escu created a pervasive personality cult, giving himself titles such as \"Conduc\u0103tor\" (\"Leader\") and \"Geniul din Carpa\u021bi\" (\"The Genius of the Carpathians\"), with inspiration from Proletarian Culture (Proletkult). After his election as President of Romania, he even had a \"presidential sceptre\" created for himself, thus appropriating a royal insignia. This excess prompted painter Salvador Dal\u00ed to send a congratulatory telegram to the Romanian president, in which he sarcastically congratulated Ceau\u0219escu on his \"introducing the presidential sceptre\". The Communist Party daily \"Sc\u00eenteia\" published the message, unaware that it was a work of satire.\nThe most important day of the year during Ceau\u0219escu's rule was his official birthday, 26 January\u2014a day which saw Romanian media saturated with praise for him. According to historian Victor Sebestyen, it was one of the few days of the year when the average Romanian put on a happy face, since appearing miserable on this day was too risky to contemplate.\nTo lessen the chance of further treason after Pacepa's defection, Ceau\u0219escu also invested his wife Elena and other members of his family with important positions in the government. This led Romanians to joke that Ceau\u0219escu was creating \"socialism in one family\", a pun on \"socialism in one country\".\nCeau\u0219escu was greatly concerned about his public image. For years, nearly all official photographs of him showed him in his late 40s. Romanian state television was under strict orders to portray him in the best possible light. Additionally, great care was taken by producers to ensure that Ceau\u0219escu\u2019s height\u20141.68 metres (5\u00a0ft 6 in)\u2014was never conspicuously highlighted on screen. Consequences for breaking these rules were severe; one producer showed footage of Ceau\u0219escu blinking and stuttering, and was banned for three months.\nAs part of a propaganda ploy arranged by the Ceau\u0219escus through the consular cultural attach\u00e9s of Romanian embassies, they managed to receive orders and titles from numerous states and institutions. France granted Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu the Legion of Honour. In 1978 he became a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB) in the UK, a title of which he was stripped in 1989. Elena Ceau\u0219escu was arranged to be \"elected\" to membership of a science academy in the US.\nTo execute a massive redevelopment project, the Ceau\u0219escu government conducted extensive demolition of churches and many other historic structures in Romania. According to Alexandru Budistenu, former chief architect of Bucharest:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"The sight of a church bothered Ceau\u0219escu. It didn't matter if they demolished or moved it, as long as it was no longer in sight\"\u2014\u200a\nNevertheless, a project by Romanian engineer Eugeniu Iordachescu was able to move many historic structures to less prominent sites, thus saving them.\nIKEA.\nIn the 1980s under Ceau\u0219escu, the Securitate received six-figure payments from Swedish furniture company IKEA. According to declassified files at the , IKEA agreed to overcharge for products made in Romania and some of the overpayment funds were deposited into an account controlled by the Securitate.\nLegacy.\nCeau\u0219escu had a mixed reputation among international leaders of his time. In his memoir \"The Artful Albanian\", Albanian communist leader Enver Hoxha remarked \"As if Ceau\u0219escu and company are to bring down imperialism! If the world waits for the Ceau\u0219escus to do such a thing, imperialism will live for tens of thousands of years...\" According to Pacepa, Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi had an opposite interpretation, allegedly saying, \"My brother! You are my brother for the rest of my life!\". Ceau\u0219escu even received praise from anti-communists with the Iran's shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi acclaiming Ceau\u0219escu leadership: \"I would like to salute [Ceau\u0219escu's] intransigent patriotism and ferocious will for independence. A veritable amity links me to him\".\nHe directed the construction of the Palace of the Parliament in Bucharest, which broke ground in June 1984. It was previously called The House of the People and The People's House. The building of the Palace of the Parliament was the most extreme expression of the Systematisation programme imposed by Ceau\u0219escu upon Romania, being an urban planning programme used to convert villages into miniature cities. The main architect of the building was Anca Petrescu (1949\u20132013), who began her work on the building when she was 28 years old. The building was completed in 1997, after Ceau\u0219escu's death in 1989. The Romanian Senate, which was originally housed in the former building of the Central Committee of the Romanian Communist Party, has been headquartered in the Parliamentary Palace since 2004.\nThe Parliamentary Palace building has 1,100 rooms and is the largest civilian government building in the world as measured by volume in one continuous structure. (There are larger private sector buildings, mainly for the construction of aircraft, that have more continuous volume in one building, such as the Boeing Everett Factory.) Much of the building remains empty, being larger than the Parliament needs, though Parliament shares it with three museums and an international conference centre. It is also the heaviest building in the world, being constructed of 700,000 tonnes of steel and bronze, a million square feet of marble, and large amounts of crystal and wood.\nThe Ceau\u0219escus had three children: Valentin (born 1948), a nuclear physicist; Zoia (1949\u20132006), a mathematician; and Nicu Ceau\u0219escu (1951\u20131996), a physicist. After the death of his parents, Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu ordered the construction of an Orthodox church, the walls of which are decorated with portraits of his parents.\nPraising the crimes of totalitarian governments and denigrating their victims is forbidden by law in Romania; this includes the Ceau\u0219escu era. Dinel Staicu was fined 25,000 lei (approx. 9,000 US dollars) for praising Ceau\u0219escu and displaying his pictures on his private television channel (\"3TV Oltenia\"). \nOpinion polls held in 2010 indicated that 41% of Romanians would have voted for Ceau\u0219escu if given the opportunity and 63% felt their lives were better before 1989. In 2014, the percentage of those who would vote for Ceau\u0219escu reached 46%. On 27 December 2018, a poll found 64% of people had a good opinion of him. In 2025, an INSCOP research survey found 66.2% of Romanians having a favourable opinion of him.\nAfter Ceau\u0219escu's overthrow, politicians such as Corneliu Vadim Tudor have coupled the image of his regime with the Ion Antonescu regime into their versions of a national Pantheon.\nCultural depictions.\nCeau\u0219escu is played by Constantin Cojocaru in the 2011 Swiss docudrama \"Die letzten Tage der Ceau\u0219escus\".\nThe final song on the 2012 album \"Bish Bosch\" by Scott Walker titled \u201cThe Day The \u2018Conducator\u2019 Died (An Xmas Song)\u201d is in reference to Ceau\u0219escu (and his death on Christmas Day.)\nA comedy musical enjoyed a world premiere at Seven Arts in Leeds on Sunday 21 May 2017. It was written by Tom Bailey and Greg Jameson, with songs by Allan Stelmach, and depicted Nicolae and Elena Ceau\u0219escu and their son Valentin in a piece of meta musical theatre that was also a comment upon celebrity culture and the role social media and political correctness play in creating social pariahs.\nHonours and awards.\nCeau\u0219escu was made a knight of the Danish Order of the Elephant, but this appointment was revoked on 23 December 1989 by the then queen of Denmark, Margrethe II.\nCeau\u0219escu was likewise stripped of his honorary Knight Grand Cross of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath (GCB) status by Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom on the day before his execution. Queen Elizabeth II also returned the insignia of the Order of the Star of the Socialist Republic of Romania that Ceau\u0219escu had bestowed upon her in 1978.\nOn his 70th birthday in 1988, Ceau\u0219escu was decorated with the Karl-Marx-Order by then Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) chief Erich Honecker; through this he was honoured for his rejection of Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms.\nRomanian orders, decorations and medals.\nAll titles and decorations were revoked by the provisional government on 26 December 1989.\nForeign state orders, decorations and medals.\nSeveral foreign decorations were revoked at the time of the collapse of Ceau\u0219escu's rule.\n Collar of the Order of the Liberator General San Mart\u00edn (1974)\n Great Star of Honour for Services to the Republic of Austria (1969)\n Order of the Southern Cross (1975)\n Order of Stara Planina (1983)\n Order of Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed (1973)\n Twentieth Anniversary Commemorative Medal of the Assault on the Moncada Barracks (1976)\n Grand Collar of the Order of the White Lion (1987; subsequently expelled 1989)\n Knight of the Order of the Elephant (1980; subsequently expelled 1989)\n Legion of Honour\n Order of Karl Marx (German Democratic Republic, 1988) \u2013 for his defence of Marxism by rejecting Gorbachev's reforms\n Special class of the Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany, 1971)\n Athens Gold Medal (1976)\n Commemorative Medal of the 2500th Anniversary of the founding of the Persian Empire (Empire of Iran, 1971).\n Knight Grand Cross decorated with Grand Cordon of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic (1973)\n Honorary Recipient of the Order of the Crown of the Realm (1984)\n Grand Cross of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olaf (expelled 1989)\n Grand Cross with Diamonds of the Order of the Sun of Peru (1973)\n Grand Collar of the Ancient Order of Sikatuna (1975)\n Collar of the Order of Saint James of the Sword (1975)\n Jubilee Medal \"Thirty Years of Victory in the Great Patriotic War 1941\u20131945\" (1975)\n Order of Lenin, twice (Soviet Union, 1973 and 25 January 1988)\n Order of the October Revolution (1983)\n Knight of the Royal Order of the Seraphim (1980)\n Knight Grand Cross of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath (1978; expelled 1989)\nAcademic titles.\nHonorary degrees from the University of Bucharest (1973), Lebanese University (1974), University of Buenos Aires (1974), Autonomous University of Yucat\u00e1n (1975), University of Nice Sophia Antipolis (1975), University of the Philippines (1975), University of Liberia (1988) \nIn popular culture.\nTwo documentaries have been made about Ceau\u0219escu in the 21st century. The first film was written and directed by Ben Lewis for the BBC, titled \"The King of Communism: The Pomp &amp; Pageantry of Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu\" (2002).\nThe second, \"Autobiografia lui Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu\" (2011), was created by Romanian writer/director Andrei Ujica, and an English language version of the film was released simultaneously, titled \"The Autobiography of Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu\".\nThe \"Left Behind\" novels by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins feature a fictional Romanian politician, Nicolae Carpathia, who rises from Romania\u2019s presidency to become a dictatorial world ruler. Reviewers and scholars have noted that the series\u2019s Antichrist, the Romanian politician Nicolae Carpathia, invites comparison with former Romanian leader Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu, given his nationality, authoritarian rule, and personality cult.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "49565", "revid": "50614602", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49565", "title": "President pro tempore of the United States Senate", "text": "Second-highest-ranking official of the US Senate\nThe president pro tempore of the United States Senate (often shortened to president pro tem) is the second-highest-ranking official of the United States Senate, after the vice president. According to Article One, Section Three of the United States Constitution, the vice president of the United States is the president of the Senate (despite not being a senator), and the Senate must choose a president \"pro tempore\" to act in the vice president's absence.\nThe president pro tempore is elected by the Senate as a whole, usually by a resolution which is adopted by unanimous consent without a formal vote. The Constitution does not specify who can serve in this position, but the Senate has always elected one of its current members. Unlike the vice president, the president pro tempore cannot cast a tie-breaking vote when the Senate is evenly divided. The president pro tempore has enjoyed many privileges and some limited powers.\nDuring the vice president's absence, the president pro tempore is empowered to preside over Senate sessions. Except when necessary or to highlight important votes, the vice president and the president pro tempore rarely preside; instead, the duty of presiding officer is rotated among junior U.S. senators of the majority party to give them experience in parliamentary procedure.\nSince 1945, the most senior U.S. senator in the majority party has generally (though not always) been chosen to be president pro tempore and holds the office continuously until the election of another. Since the enactment of the current Presidential Succession Act in 1947, the president pro tempore is third in the presidential line of succession, after the vice president and the speaker of the House of Representatives. The current president pro tempore of the U.S. Senate is Chuck Grassley.\nPower and responsibilities.\nAlthough the position is in some ways analogous to the speaker of the United States House of Representatives, the powers of the president pro tempore are far more limited. In the Senate, most power rests with the majority leader and other individual senators, but as the chamber's presiding officer, the president pro tempore is authorized to perform certain duties in the absence of the vice president, including ruling on points of order. Additionally, under the 25th Amendment to the Constitution, the president pro tempore and the speaker are the two authorities to whom declarations must be transmitted that the president is unable to perform the duties of the office, or is able to resume doing so. The president pro tempore is third in the line of presidential succession, following the vice president and the speaker, and consequently is one of the few members of Congress entitled to a full-time security detail.\nAdditional duties include appointment of various congressional officers, certain commissions, advisory boards, and committees. The president pro tempore is the designated legal recipient of various reports to the Senate, including War Powers Act reports under which they, jointly with the speaker, may require the president to call Congress back into session. The officeholder is an \"ex officio\" member of various boards and commissions. With the secretary and sergeant at arms, the president pro tempore maintains order in Senate portions of the Capitol and Senate buildings.\nHistory.\nPosition established.\nThe office of president pro tempore was established by the Constitution of the United States in 1789. Between 1792 and 1886, the president pro tempore was second in the line of presidential succession, following the vice president and preceding the speaker. Through 1891, the president pro tempore was appointed on an intermittent basis only, when the vice president was not present to preside over the Senate, or at the adjournment of a session of Congress. \nThe first president pro tempore, John Langdon, was elected on April 6, 1789, serving four separate terms between 1789 and 1793. \"More than twelve senators held the office during the Senate's first decade\", presiding over sessions, signing legislation, and performing routine administrative tasks.\nWhenever the office of the vice presidency was vacant, as it was on ten occasions between 1812 and 1889, the office garnered heightened importance, for although he did not assume the vice presidency, the president pro tempore stood next in line for the presidency. Before the ratification of the Twenty-fifth Amendment in 1967, a vacancy in the vice presidency could be filled only by a regular election; several individuals who served during these vacancies were referred to informally as \"acting vice president\".\nOn three occasions during the 19th century, the Senate was without both a president and a president pro tempore:\nWhen President Andrew Johnson, who had no vice president, was impeached and tried in 1868, Senate President pro tempore Benjamin Franklin Wade was next in line to the presidency. Wade's radicalism is thought by many historians to be a major reason why the Senate, which did not want to see Wade in the White House, acquitted Johnson. \nVice President Henry Wilson died on November 22, 1875. Senator Thomas W. Ferry, being President pro tempore of the Senate, was next in the line of presidential succession, and remained so until March 4, 1877. As acting president of the senate, he presided over the 1876 impeachment trial of U.S. Secretary of War William Belknap and the meetings of the Electoral Commission created by Congress to resolve the disputed 1876 presidential election. Still president pro tempore at that time, he would have temporally become the acting president had the Electoral College vote not been certified by March 4, 1877; Congress certified Rutherford B. Hayes as the winner of the Electoral College vote on March 2.\nThe president pro tempore and the speaker of the House were removed from the presidential line of succession in 1886. Both were restored to it in 1947, though this time with the president pro tempore following the speaker.\nWilliam P. Frye served as president pro tempore from 1896 to 1911 (the 54th through the 62nd Congresses), a tenure longer than anyone else. He resigned from the position due to ill health shortly before his death. Electing his successor proved difficult, as Senate Republicans, then in the majority, were split between progressive and conservative factions, each promoting its own candidate. Likewise, the Democrats proposed their own candidate. As a result of this three-way split, no individual received a majority vote. It took four months for a compromise solution to emerge: Democrat Augustus Bacon served for a single day, August 14, 1911, during the vice president's absence. Thereafter, Bacon and four Republicans\u2014Charles Curtis, Jacob Gallinger, Henry Cabot Lodge, and Frank Brandegee\u2014alternated as president pro tempore for the remainder of that Congress's session.\nModern era.\nIn January 1945, the Senate elected Kenneth McKellar, who at the time was the senator with the longest continuous service, as its president pro tempore. Since then, it has become customary for the majority party's most senior member to hold this position. Patty Murray was elected president pro tempore in January 2023, the first woman to hold the position. At the time of her election, she was the second-most senior member of the majority party.\nHistorically, presidents pro tempore would preside over any joint session of the United States Congress alongside the speaker of the house when there was a vacancy in the vice presidency. With the ratification of the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1967, vacancies in the vice presidency became much less common. However, a need for the president pro tempore to preside came in September 2001, following the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Due to heightened security concerns during President George W. Bush's September 20 address to Congress, Vice President Dick Cheney stayed at another location as a designated survivor, and President Pro Tempore Robert Byrd presided in his absence.\nPresident pro tempore Patrick Leahy presided over the second impeachment of Donald Trump in 2021. The Chief Justice of the United States had presided over all previous presidential impeachment trials, as prescribed by the Constitution, but in this case Trump was no longer a sitting president when the trial began.\nRelated officials.\nActing president pro tempore.\nWhile the president pro tempore does have other official duties, the holders of the office have, like the vice president, over time ceased presiding over the Senate on a daily basis, owing to the mundane and ceremonial nature of the position. Furthermore, as the president pro tempore is usually the most senior senator of the majority party, they most likely also chair a major Senate committee and have other significant demands on their time. Therefore, the president pro tempore has less time now than in the past to preside daily over the Senate. Instead, junior senators from the majority party are designated acting president pro tempore to preside over the Senate. This allows junior senators to learn proper parliamentary procedure. The acting president pro tempore is usually reappointed daily by the president pro tempore.\nPermanent acting president pro tempore.\nIn June 1963, because of the illness of president pro tempore Carl Hayden, Lee Metcalf was designated permanent acting president pro tempore. No term was imposed on this designation, so Metcalf retained it until he died in office in 1978.\nDeputy president pro tempore.\nThe ceremonial post of deputy president pro tempore was created for Hubert Humphrey, a former vice president, in 1977 following his losing bid to become the Senate majority leader. The Senate resolution creating the position stated that any former president or former vice president serving in the Senate would be entitled to this position. However, since Humphrey, none has served. George J. Mitchell was elected deputy president pro tempore in 1987, because of the illness of president pro tempore John C. Stennis, similar to Metcalf's earlier designation as permanent acting president pro tempore. The office has remained vacant since 1989 and no senator other than Humphrey and Mitchell has held it since its creation.\nPresident pro tempore emeritus/emerita.\nSince 2001, the honorary title of president pro tempore emeritus has been given to a senator of the minority party who has previously served as president pro tempore. It has been held by Strom Thurmond (R-South Carolina) (2001\u20132003), Robert Byrd (D-West Virginia) (2003\u20132007), Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) (2007\u20132009), Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont) (2015\u20132021), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) (2021\u20132025), and Patty Murray (D-Washington) (2025\u2013present). From 2009 to 2015, no senator met the requirements for it.\nThe position was created for Thurmond when the Democratic Party regained a majority in the Senate in June 2001. With the change in party control, Democrat Robert Byrd of West Virginia replaced Thurmond as president pro tempore, reclaiming a position he had previously held from 1989 to 1995 and briefly in January 2001. Thurmond's retirement from the Senate on January 3, 2003, coincided with a change from Democratic to Republican control, making Stevens president pro tempore and Byrd the second president pro tempore emeritus. In 2007, Byrd returned as president pro tempore, and Stevens became the third president pro tempore emeritus, when the Democrats gained control of the Senate. Although a president pro tempore emeritus has no official duties, they are entitled to an increase in staff, and advise party leaders on the functions of the Senate.\nThe office's accompanying budget increase was removed toward the end of the 113th Congress, shortly before Patrick Leahy was to become the first holder of the office in six years.\nSalary.\nThe salary of the president pro tempore for 2024 was $193,400, equal to that of the majority leaders and minority leaders of both houses of Congress. If there is a vacancy in the office of vice president, then the salary would be the same as that of the vice president. The salary alongside the salary of the members of Congress has not been adjusted since 2009.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

For example, with Bayes' theorem, the probability that a patient has a disease given that they tested positive for that disease can be found using the probability that the test yields a positive result when the disease is present. The theorem was developed in the 18th century by Bayes and independently by Pierre-Simon Laplace.\nOne of Bayes' theorem's many applications is Bayesian inference, an approach to statistical inference, where it is used to invert the probability of observations given a model configuration (i.e., the likelihood function) to obtain the probability of the model configuration given the observations (i.e., the posterior probability).\nHistory.\nBayes' theorem is named after Thomas Bayes, a minister, statistician, and philosopher. Bayes used conditional probability to provide an algorithm (his Proposition 9) that uses evidence to calculate limits on an unknown parameter. His work was published in 1763 as \"An Essay Towards Solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances\". Bayes studied how to compute a distribution for the probability parameter of a binomial distribution (in modern terminology). After Bayes's death, his family gave his papers to a friend, the minister, philosopher, and mathematician Richard Price.\nPrice significantly edited the unpublished manuscript for two years before sending it to a friend who read it aloud at the Royal Society on 23 December 1763. Price edited Bayes's major work \"An Essay Towards Solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances\" (1763), which appeared in \"Philosophical Transactions\", and contains Bayes' theorem. Price wrote an introduction to the paper that provides some of the philosophical basis of Bayesian statistics and chose one of the two solutions Bayes offered. In 1765, Price was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in recognition of his work on Bayes's legacy. On 27 April, a letter sent to his friend Benjamin Franklin was read out at the Royal Society, and later published, in which Price applies this work to population and computing 'life-annuities'.\nIndependently of Bayes, Pierre-Simon Laplace used conditional probability to formulate the relation of an updated posterior probability from a prior probability, given evidence. He reproduced and extended Bayes's results in 1774, apparently unaware of Bayes's work, and summarized his results in \"Th\u00e9orie analytique des probabilit\u00e9s\" (1812). The Bayesian interpretation of probability was developed mainly by Laplace.\nAbout 200 years later, Sir Harold Jeffreys put Bayes's algorithm and Laplace's formulation on an axiomatic basis, writing in a 1973 book that Bayes' theorem \"is to the theory of probability what the Pythagorean theorem is to geometry\".\nStephen Stigler used a Bayesian argument to conclude that Bayes' theorem was discovered by Nicholas Saunderson, a blind English mathematician, some time before Bayes, but that is disputed. \nMartyn Hooper and Sharon McGrayne have argued that Richard Price's contribution was substantial:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;By modern standards, we should refer to the Bayes\u2013Price rule. Price discovered Bayes's work, recognized its importance, corrected it, contributed to the article, and found a use for it. The modern convention of employing Bayes's name alone is unfair but so entrenched that anything else makes little sense.\nF. Thomas Bruss reviewed Bayes's \"An essay towards solving a problem in the doctrine of chances\" as communicated by Price. He agrees with Stigler's analysis in many points, but not as far as the question of priority is concerned. Bruss underlines the intuitive part of Bayes's formula and adds independent arguments of Bayes's probable motivation for his work. He concludes that, unless the contrary is really proven, we are entitled to be faithful to the name \"Bayes' Theorem\" or \"Bayes' formula\".\nStatement of theorem.\nBayes' theorem is stated mathematically as the following equation:\nformula_1\nwhere formula_2 and formula_3 are events and formula_4.\nProof.\nFor events.\nBayes' theorem may be derived from the definition of conditional probability:\nformula_19\nwhere formula_20 is the probability of both A and B being true. Similarly,\nformula_21\nSolving for formula_20 and substituting into the above expression for formula_5 yields Bayes' theorem:\nformula_24\nFor continuous random variables.\nFor two continuous random variables \"X\" and \"Y\", Bayes' theorem may be analogously derived from the definition of conditional density:\nformula_25\nformula_26\nTherefore,\nformula_27\nThis holds for values formula_28 and formula_29 within the support of \"X\" and \"Y\", ensuring formula_30 and formula_31.\nGeneral case.\nLet formula_32 be the conditional distribution of formula_33 given formula_34 and let formula_35 be the distribution of formula_36. The joint distribution is then formula_37. The conditional distribution formula_38 of formula_36 given formula_40 is then determined by\nformula_41\nExistence and uniqueness of the needed conditional expectation is a consequence of the Radon\u2013Nikodym theorem. This was formulated by Kolmogorov in 1933. Kolmogorov underlines the importance of conditional probability, writing, \"I wish to call attention to ... the theory of conditional probabilities and conditional expectations\". Bayes' theorem determines the posterior distribution from the prior distribution. Uniqueness requires continuity assumptions. Bayes' theorem can be generalized to include improper prior distributions such as the uniform distribution on the real line. Modern Markov chain Monte Carlo methods have boosted the importance of Bayes' theorem, including in cases with improper priors.\nExamples.\nDrug testing.\nSuppose, a particular test for whether someone has been using cannabis is 90% sensitive, meaning the true positive rate (TPR) = 0.90. Therefore, it leads to 90% true positive results (correct identification of drug use) for cannabis users.\nThe test is also 80% specific, meaning true negative rate (TNR) = 0.80. Therefore, the test correctly identifies 80% of non-use for non-users, but also generates 20% false positives, or false positive rate (FPR) = 0.20, for non-users.\nAssuming 0.05 prevalence, meaning 5% of people use cannabis, what is the probability that a random person who tests positive is really a cannabis user?\nThe Positive predictive value (PPV) of a test is the proportion of persons who are actually positive out of all those testing positive, and can be calculated from a sample as:\nPPV = True positive / Tested positive\nIf sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence are known, PPV can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. Let formula_42 mean \"the probability that someone is a cannabis user given that they test positive\", which is what PPV means. We can write:\nformula_43\nThe denominator formula_44 is a direct application of the Law of Total Probability. In this case, it says that the probability that someone tests positive is the probability that a user tests positive times the probability of being a user, plus the probability that a non-user tests positive, times the probability of being a non-user. This is true because the classifications user and non-user form a partition of a set, namely the set of people who take the drug test. This combined with the definition of conditional probability results in the above statement.\nIn other words, if someone tests positive, the probability that they are a cannabis user is only 19%\u2014because in this group, only 5% of people are users, and most positives are false positives coming from the remaining 95%.\nIf 1,000 people were tested:\nThe 1,000 people thus have 235 positive tests, of which only 45 are genuine, about 19%.\nSensitivity or specificity.\nThe importance of specificity can be seen by showing that even if sensitivity is raised to 100% and specificity remains at 80%, the probability that someone who tests positive is a cannabis user rises only from 19% to 21%, but if the sensitivity is held at 90% and the specificity is increased to 95%, the probability rises to 49%.\nCancer rate.\nIf all patients with pancreatic cancer have a certain symptom, it does not follow that anyone who has that symptom has a 100% chance of getting pancreatic cancer. Assuming the incidence rate of pancreatic cancer is 1/100000, while 10/99999 healthy individuals have the same symptoms worldwide, the probability of having pancreatic cancer given the symptoms is 9.1%, and the other 90.9% could be \"false positives\" (that is, falsely said to have cancer; \"positive\" is a confusing term when, as here, the test gives bad news).\nBased on incidence rate, the following table presents the corresponding numbers per 100,000 people.\nWhich can then be used to calculate the probability of having cancer when you have the symptoms: \nformula_45\nDefective item rate.\nA factory produces items using three machines\u2014A, B, and C\u2014which account for 20%, 30%, and 50% of its output, respectively. Of the items produced by machine A, 5% are defective, while 3% of B's items and 1% of C's are defective. If a randomly selected item is defective, what is the probability it was produced by machine C?\nOnce again, the answer can be reached without using the formula by applying the conditions to a hypothetical number of cases. For example, if the factory produces 1,000 items, 200 will be produced by A, 300 by B, and 500 by C. Machine A will produce 5% \u00d7 200 = 10 defective items, B 3% \u00d7 300 = 9, and C 1% \u00d7 500 = 5, for a total of 24. Thus 24/1000 (2.4%) of the total output will be defective and the likelihood that a randomly selected defective item was produced by machine C is 5/24 (~20.83%).\nThis problem can also be solved using Bayes' theorem: Let \"Xi\" denote the event that a randomly chosen item was made by the \"i\" th machine (for \"i\"\u00a0= A,B,C). Let \"Y\" denote the event that a randomly chosen item is defective. Then, we are given the following information:\nformula_46\nIf the item was made by the first machine, then the probability that it is defective is 0.05; that is, \"P\"(\"Y\"\u2009|\u2009\"X\"A) = 0.05. Overall, we have\nformula_47\nTo answer the original question, we first find \"P\"(Y). That can be done in the following way:\nformula_48\nHence, 2.4% of the total output is defective.\nWe are given that \"Y\" has occurred and we want to calculate the conditional probability of \"X\"C. By Bayes' theorem,\nformula_49\nGiven that the item is defective, the probability that it was made by machine C is 5/24. C produces half of the total output but a much smaller fraction of the defective items. Hence the knowledge that the item selected was defective enables us to replace the prior probability \"P\"(\"X\"C)\u00a0= 1/2 by the smaller posterior probability \"P\"(XC\u2009|\u2009\"Y\")\u00a0= 5/24.\nInterpretations.\nThe interpretation of Bayes' rule depends on the interpretation of probability ascribed to the terms. The two predominant classes of interpretation are described below.\nBayesian interpretations.\nIn Bayesian (or epistemological) interpretations, probability measures a \"degree of belief\". Bayes' theorem links the degree of belief in a proposition before and after accounting for evidence. For example, suppose it is believed with 50% certainty that a coin is twice as likely to land heads than tails. If the coin is flipped a number of times and the outcomes observed, that degree of belief will probably rise or fall, but might remain the same, depending on the results. For proposition \"A\" and evidence \"B\",\nFor more on the application of Bayes' theorem under Bayesian interpretations of probability, see Bayesian inference.\nFrequentist interpretations.\nIn the frequentist interpretations, probability measures a \"proportion of outcomes\". For example, suppose an experiment is performed many times. \"P\"(\"A\") is the proportion of outcomes with property \"A\" (the prior) and \"P\"(\"B\") is the proportion with property \"B\". \"P\"(\"B\"\u2009|\u2009\"A\") is the proportion of outcomes with property \"B\" \"out of\" outcomes with property \"A\", and \"P\"(\"A\"\u2009|\u2009\"B\") is the proportion of those with \"A\" \"out of\" those with \"B\" (the posterior).\nThe role of Bayes' theorem can be shown with tree diagrams. The two diagrams partition the same outcomes by \"A\" and \"B\" in opposite orders, to obtain the inverse probabilities. Bayes' theorem links the different partitionings.\nExample.\nAn entomologist spots what might, due to the pattern on its back, be a rare subspecies of beetle. A full 98% of the members of the rare subspecies have the pattern, so \"P\"(Pattern\u00a0|\u00a0Rare) = 98%. Only 5% of members of the common subspecies have the pattern. The rare subspecies is 0.1% of the total population. How likely is the beetle having the pattern to be rare: what is \"P\"(Rare\u00a0|\u00a0Pattern)?\nFrom the extended form of Bayes' theorem (since any beetle is either rare or common),\n formula_50\nForms.\nEvents.\nSimple form.\nFor events \"A\" and \"B\", provided that \"P\"(\"B\")\u00a0\u2260\u00a00,\nformula_51\nIn many applications, for instance in Bayesian inference, the event \"B\" is fixed in the discussion and we wish to consider the effect of its having been observed on our belief in various possible events \"A\". In such situations the denominator of the last expression, the probability of the given evidence \"B\", is fixed; what we want to vary is \"A\". Bayes' theorem shows that the posterior probabilities are proportional to the numerator, so the last equation becomes:\nformula_52\nIn words, the posterior is proportional to the prior times the likelihood. This version of Bayes' theorem is known as Bayes' rule.\nIf events \"A\"1, \"A\"2, ..., are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, i.e., one of them is certain to occur but no two can occur together, we can determine the proportionality constant by using the fact that their probabilities must add up to one. For instance, for a given event \"A\", the event \"A\" itself and its complement \u00ac\"A\" are exclusive and exhaustive. Denoting the constant of proportionality by \"c\", we have:\nformula_53\nAdding these two formulas we deduce that:\nformula_54\nor\nformula_55\nAlternative form.\nAnother form of Bayes' theorem for two competing statements or hypotheses is:\nformula_56\nFor an epistemological interpretation:\nFor proposition \"A\" and evidence or background \"B\",\nExtended form.\nOften, for some partition {\"Aj\"} of the sample space, the event space is given in terms of \"P\"(\"Aj\") and \"P\"(\"B\"\u00a0|\u00a0\"Aj\"). It is then useful to compute \"P\"(\"B\") using the law of total probability:\nformula_63\nOr (using the multiplication rule for conditional probability),\nformula_64\nformula_65\nIn the special case where \"A\" is a binary variable:\nformula_66\nRandom variables.\nConsider a sample space \u03a9 generated by two random variables \"X\" and \"Y\" with known probability distributions. In principle, Bayes' theorem applies to the events \"A\"\u00a0=\u00a0{\"X\"\u00a0=\u00a0\"x\"} and \"B\"\u00a0=\u00a0{\"Y\"\u00a0=\u00a0\"y\"}.\nformula_67\nTerms become 0 at points where either variable has finite probability density. To remain useful, Bayes' theorem can be formulated in terms of the relevant densities (see Derivation).\nSimple form.\nIf \"X\" is continuous and \"Y\" is discrete,\nformula_68\nwhere each formula_69 is a density function.\nIf \"X\" is discrete and \"Y\" is continuous,\nformula_70\nIf both \"X\" and \"Y\" are continuous,\nformula_71\nExtended form.\nA continuous event space is often conceptualized in terms of the numerator terms. It is then useful to eliminate the denominator using the law of total probability. For \"fY\"(\"y\"), this becomes an integral:\nformula_72\nBayes' rule in odds form.\nBayes' theorem in odds form is:\nformula_73\nwhere\nformula_74\nis called the Bayes factor or likelihood ratio. The odds between two events is simply the ratio of the probabilities of the two events. Thus:\nformula_75\nformula_76\nThus the rule says that the posterior odds are the prior odds times the Bayes factor; in other words, the posterior is proportional to the prior times the likelihood.\nIn the special case that formula_77 and formula_78, one writes formula_79, and uses a similar abbreviation for the Bayes factor and for the conditional odds. The odds on formula_2 is by definition the odds for and against formula_2. Bayes' rule can then be written in the abbreviated form\nformula_82\nor, in words, the posterior odds on formula_2 equals the prior odds on formula_2 times the likelihood ratio for formula_2 given information formula_3. In short, posterior odds equals prior odds times likelihood ratio.\nFor example, if a medical test has a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 91%, then the positive Bayes factor is formula_87. Now, if the prevalence of this disease is 9.09%, and if we take that as the prior probability, then the prior odds is about 1:10. So after receiving a positive test result, the posterior odds of having the disease becomes 1:1, which means that the posterior probability of having the disease is 50%. If a second test is performed in serial testing, and that also turns out to be positive, then the posterior odds of having the disease becomes 10:1, which means a posterior probability of about 90.91%. The negative Bayes factor can be calculated to be 91%/(100%-90%)=9.1, so if the second test turns out to be negative, then the posterior odds of having the disease is 1:9.1, which means a posterior probability of about 9.9%.\nThe example above can also be understood with more solid numbers: assume the patient taking the test is from a group of 1,000 people, 91 of whom have the disease (prevalence of 9.1%). If all 1,000 take the test, 82 of those with the disease will get a true positive result (sensitivity of 90.1%), 9 of those with the disease will get a false negative result (false negative rate of 9.9%), 827 of those without the disease will get a true negative result (specificity of 91.0%), and 82 of those without the disease will get a false positive result (false positive rate of 9.0%). Before taking any test, the patient's odds for having the disease is 91:909. After receiving a positive result, the patient's odds for having the disease is\nformula_88\nwhich is consistent with the fact that there are 82 true positives and 82 false positives in the group of 1,000.\nGeneralizations.\nBayes' theorem for 3 events.\nA version of Bayes' theorem for 3 events results from the addition of a third event formula_89, with formula_90 on which all probabilities are conditioned:\nformula_91\nThis can be deduced as follows. Using the chain rule\nformula_92\nAnd, on the other hand\nformula_93\nThe desired result is obtained by identifying both expressions and solving for formula_94.\nApplications.\nRecreational mathematics.\nBayes' rule and computing conditional probabilities provide a method to solve a number of popular puzzles, such as the Three Prisoners problem, the Monty Hall problem, the Two Child problem, and the Two Envelopes problem.\nGenetics.\nIn genetics, Bayes' rule can be used to estimate the probability that someone has a specific genotype. Many people seek to assess their chances of being affected by a genetic disease or their likelihood of being a carrier for a recessive gene of interest. A Bayesian analysis can be done based on family history or genetic testing to predict whether someone will develop a disease or pass one on to their children. Genetic testing and prediction is common among couples who plan to have children but are concerned that they may both be carriers for a disease, especially in communities with low genetic variance.\nAbove is an example of a Bayesian analysis table for a female's risk for a disease based on the knowledge that the disease is present in her siblings but not in her parents or any of her four children. Based solely on the status of the subject's siblings and parents, she is equally likely to be a carrier as to be a non-carrier (this likelihood is denoted by the prior hypothesis). The probability that the subject's four sons would all be unaffected is 1/16 (&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20442\u22c5&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20442\u22c5&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20442\u22c5&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20442) if she is a carrier and about 1 if she is a non-carrier (this is the conditional probability). The joint probability reconciles these two predictions by multiplying them together. The last line (the posterior probability) is calculated by dividing the joint probability for each hypothesis by the sum of both joint probabilities.\nParental genetic testing can detect around 90% of known disease alleles in parents that can lead to carrier or affected status in their children. Cystic fibrosis is a heritable disease caused by an autosomal recessive mutation on the CFTR gene, located on chromosome 7.\nHere is a Bayesian analysis of a female patient with a family history of cystic fibrosis (CF) who has tested negative for CF, demonstrating how the method was used to determine her risk of having a child born with CF: because the patient is unaffected, she is either homozygous for the wild-type allele, or heterozygous. To establish prior probabilities, a Punnett square is used, based on the knowledge that neither parent was affected by the disease but both could have been carriers:\nGiven that the patient is unaffected, there are only three possibilities. Within these three, there are two scenarios in which the patient carries the mutant allele. Thus the prior probabilities are &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2\u20443 and &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20443.\nNext, the patient undergoes genetic testing and tests negative for cystic fibrosis. This test has a 90% detection rate, so the conditional probabilities of a negative test are 1/10 and 1. Finally, the joint and posterior probabilities are calculated as before.\nAfter carrying out the same analysis on the patient's male partner (with a negative test result), the chance that their child is affected is the product of the parents' respective posterior probabilities for being carriers times the chance that two carriers will produce an affected offspring (&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20444).\nBayesian analysis can be done using phenotypic information associated with a genetic condition. When combined with genetic testing, this analysis becomes much more complicated. Cystic fibrosis, for example, can be identified in a fetus with an ultrasound looking for an echogenic bowel, one that appears brighter than normal on a scan. This is not a foolproof test, as an echogenic bowel can be present in a perfectly healthy fetus. Parental genetic testing is very influential in this case, where a phenotypic facet can be overly influential in probability calculation. In the case of a fetus with an echogenic bowel, with a mother who has been tested and is known to be a CF carrier, the posterior probability that the fetus has the disease is very high (0.64). But once the father has tested negative for CF, the posterior probability drops significantly (to 0.16).\nRisk factor calculation is a powerful tool in genetic counseling and reproductive planning but cannot be treated as the only important factor. As above, incomplete testing can yield falsely high probability of carrier status, and testing can be financially inaccessible or unfeasible when a parent is not present.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Fundamentally, Bayesian inference uses a prior distribution to estimate posterior probabilities. Bayesian inference is an important technique in statistics, and especially in mathematical statistics. Bayesian updating is particularly important in the dynamic analysis of a sequence of data. Bayesian inference has found application in a wide range of activities, including science, engineering, philosophy, medicine, sport, and law. In the philosophy of decision theory, Bayesian inference is closely related to subjective probability, often called \"Bayesian probability\".\nIntroduction to Bayes' rule.\nFormal explanation.\nBayesian inference derives the posterior probability as a consequence of two antecedents: a prior probability and a \"likelihood function\" derived from a statistical model for the observed data. Bayesian inference computes the posterior probability according to Bayes' theorem:\nformula_1\nwhere\nFor different values of H, only the factors formula_2 and formula_4, both in the numerator, affect the value of formula_3\u00a0\u2013 the posterior probability of a hypothesis is proportional to its prior probability (its inherent likeliness) and the newly acquired likelihood (its compatibility with the new observed evidence).\nIn cases where formula_11 (\"not H\"), the logical negation of H, is a valid likelihood, Bayes' rule can be rewritten as follows:\nformula_12\nbecause\nformula_13\nand\nformula_14\nThis focuses attention on the term\nformula_15\nIf that term is approximately 1, then the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence, formula_16, is about formula_17, about 50% likely - equally likely or not likely. If that term is very small, close to zero, then the probability of the hypothesis, given the evidence, formula_16 is close to 1 or the conditional hypothesis is quite likely. If that term is very large, much larger than 1, then the hypothesis, given the evidence, is quite unlikely. If the hypothesis (without consideration of evidence) is unlikely, then formula_2 is small (but not necessarily astronomically small) and formula_20 is much larger than 1 and this term can be approximated as formula_21 and relevant probabilities can be compared directly to each other.\nOne quick and easy way to remember the equation would be to use rule of multiplication:\nformula_22\nAlternatives to Bayesian updating.\nBayesian updating is widely used and computationally convenient. However, it is not the only updating rule that might be considered rational.\nIan Hacking noted that traditional \"Dutch book\" arguments did not specify Bayesian updating: they left open the possibility that non-Bayesian updating rules could avoid Dutch books. Hacking wrote: \"And neither the Dutch book argument nor any other in the personalist arsenal of proofs of the probability axioms entails the dynamic assumption. Not one entails Bayesianism. So the personalist requires the dynamic assumption to be Bayesian. It is true that in consistency a personalist could abandon the Bayesian model of learning from experience. Salt could lose its savour.\"\nIndeed, there are non-Bayesian updating rules that also avoid Dutch books (as discussed in the literature on \"probability kinematics\") following the publication of Richard C.\u00a0Jeffrey's rule, which applies Bayes' rule to the case where the evidence itself is assigned a probability. The additional hypotheses needed to uniquely require Bayesian updating have been deemed to be substantial, complicated, and unsatisfactory.\nInference over exclusive and exhaustive possibilities.\nIf evidence is simultaneously used to update belief over a set of exclusive and exhaustive propositions, Bayesian inference may be thought of as acting on this belief distribution as a whole.\nGeneral formulation.\nSuppose a process is generating independent and identically distributed events formula_23, but the probability distribution is unknown. Let the event space formula_24 represent the current state of belief for this process. Each model is represented by event formula_25. The conditional probabilities formula_26 are specified to define the models. formula_27 is the degree of belief in formula_25. Before the first inference step, formula_29 is a set of \"initial prior probabilities\". These must sum to 1, but are otherwise arbitrary.\nSuppose that the process is observed to generate formula_30. For each formula_31, the prior formula_32 is updated to the posterior formula_33. From Bayes' theorem:\nformula_34\nUpon observation of further evidence, this procedure may be repeated.\nMultiple observations.\nFor a sequence of independent and identically distributed observations formula_35, it can be shown by induction that repeated application of the above is equivalent to\nformula_36\nwhere\nformula_37\nParametric formulation: motivating the formal description.\nBy parameterizing the space of models, the belief in all models may be updated in a single step. The distribution of belief over the model space may then be thought of as a distribution of belief over the parameter space. The distributions in this section are expressed as continuous, represented by probability densities, as this is the usual situation. The technique is, however, equally applicable to discrete distributions.\nLet the vector formula_38 span the parameter space. Let the initial prior distribution over formula_38 be formula_40, where formula_41 is a set of parameters to the prior itself, or \"hyperparameters\". Let formula_35 be a sequence of independent and identically distributed event observations, where all formula_43 are distributed as formula_44 for some formula_38. Bayes' theorem is applied to find the posterior distribution over formula_38:\nformula_47\nwhere\nformula_48\nFormal description of Bayesian inference.\nBayesian inference.\nformula_76Existence and uniqueness of the needed conditional expectation is a consequence of the Radon\u2013Nikodym theorem. This was formulated by Kolmogorov in his famous book from 1933. Kolmogorov underlines the importance of conditional probability by writing \"I wish to call attention to ... and especially the theory of conditional probabilities and conditional expectations ...\" in the Preface. The Bayes theorem determines the posterior distribution from the prior distribution. Uniqueness requires continuity assumptions. Bayes' theorem can be generalized to include improper prior distributions such as the uniform distribution on the real line. Modern Markov chain Monte Carlo methods have boosted the importance of Bayes' theorem including cases with improper priors.\nBayesian prediction.\nBayesian theory calls for the use of the posterior predictive distribution to do predictive inference, i.e., to predict the distribution of a new, unobserved data point. That is, instead of a fixed point as a prediction, a distribution over possible points is returned. Only this way is the entire posterior distribution of the parameter(s) used. By comparison, prediction in frequentist statistics often involves finding an optimum point estimate of the parameter(s)\u2014e.g., by maximum likelihood or maximum a posteriori estimation (MAP)\u2014and then plugging this estimate into the formula for the distribution of a data point. This has the disadvantage that it does not account for any uncertainty in the value of the parameter, and hence will underestimate the variance of the predictive distribution.\nIn some instances, frequentist statistics can work around this problem. For example, confidence intervals and prediction intervals in frequentist statistics when constructed from a normal distribution with unknown mean and variance are constructed using a Student's t-distribution. This correctly estimates the variance, due to the facts that (1)\u00a0the average of normally distributed random variables is also normally distributed, and (2) the predictive distribution of a normally distributed data point with unknown mean and variance, using conjugate or uninformative priors, has a Student's t-distribution. In Bayesian statistics, however, the posterior predictive distribution can always be determined exactly\u2014or at least to an arbitrary level of precision when numerical methods are used.\nBoth types of predictive distributions have the form of a compound probability distribution (as does the marginal likelihood). In fact, if the prior distribution is a conjugate prior, such that the prior and posterior distributions come from the same family, it can be seen that both prior and posterior predictive distributions also come from the same family of compound distributions. The only difference is that the posterior predictive distribution uses the updated values of the hyperparameters (applying the Bayesian update rules given in the conjugate prior article), while the prior predictive distribution uses the values of the hyperparameters that appear in the prior distribution.\nMathematical properties.\nInterpretation of factor.\nformula_79. That is, if the model were true, the evidence would be more likely than is predicted by the current state of belief. The reverse applies for a decrease in belief. If the belief does not change, formula_80. That is, the evidence is independent of the model. If the model were true, the evidence would be exactly as likely as predicted by the current state of belief.\nCromwell's rule.\nIf formula_81 then formula_82. If formula_83 and formula_84, then formula_85. This can be interpreted to mean that hard convictions are insensitive to counter-evidence.\nThe former follows directly from Bayes' theorem. The latter can be derived by applying the first rule to the event \"not formula_86\" in place of \"formula_86\", yielding \"if formula_88, then formula_89\", from which the result immediately follows.\nAsymptotic behaviour of posterior.\nConsider the behaviour of a belief distribution as it is updated a large number of times with independent and identically distributed trials. For sufficiently nice prior probabilities, the Bernstein-von Mises theorem gives that in the limit of infinite trials, the posterior converges to a Gaussian distribution independent of the initial prior under some conditions firstly outlined and rigorously proven by Joseph L. Doob in 1948, namely if the random variable in consideration has a finite probability space. The more general results were obtained later by the statistician David A. Freedman who published in two seminal research papers in 1963 and 1965 when and under what circumstances the asymptotic behaviour of posterior is guaranteed. His 1963 paper treats, like Doob (1949), the finite case and comes to a satisfactory conclusion. However, if the random variable has an infinite but countable probability space (i.e., corresponding to a die with infinite many faces) the 1965 paper demonstrates that for a dense subset of priors the Bernstein-von Mises theorem is not applicable. In this case there is almost surely no asymptotic convergence. Later in the 1980s and 1990s Freedman and Persi Diaconis continued to work on the case of infinite countable probability spaces. To summarise, there may be insufficient trials to suppress the effects of the initial choice, and especially for large (but finite) systems the convergence might be very slow.\nConjugate priors.\nIn parameterized form, the prior distribution is often assumed to come from a family of distributions called conjugate priors. The usefulness of a conjugate prior is that the corresponding posterior distribution will be in the same family, and the calculation may be expressed in closed form.\nEstimates of parameters and predictions.\nIt is often desired to use a posterior distribution to estimate a parameter or variable. Several methods of Bayesian estimation select measurements of central tendency from the posterior distribution.\nFor one-dimensional problems, a unique median exists for practical continuous problems. The posterior median is attractive as a robust estimator.\nIf there exists a finite mean for the posterior distribution, then the posterior mean is a method of estimation.\nformula_90\nTaking a value with the greatest probability defines maximum \"a\u00a0posteriori\" (MAP) estimates:\nformula_91\nThere are examples where no maximum is attained, in which case the set of MAP estimates is empty.\nThere are other methods of estimation that minimize the posterior \"risk\" (expected-posterior loss) with respect to a loss function, and these are of interest to statistical decision theory using the sampling distribution (\"frequentist statistics\").\nThe posterior predictive distribution of a new observation formula_57 (that is independent of previous observations) is determined by\nformula_93\nExamples.\nProbability of a hypothesis.\nSuppose there are two full bowls of cookies. Bowl #1 has 10 chocolate chip and 30 plain cookies, while bowl #2 has 20 of each. Our friend Fred picks a bowl at random, and then picks a cookie at random. We may assume there is no reason to believe Fred treats one bowl differently from another, likewise for the cookies. The cookie turns out to be a plain one. How probable is it that Fred picked it out of bowl #1?\nIntuitively, it seems clear that the answer should be more than a half, since there are more plain cookies in bowl #1. The precise answer is given by Bayes' theorem. Let formula_94 correspond to bowl #1, and formula_95 to bowl #2.\nIt is given that the bowls are identical from Fred's point of view, thus formula_96, and the two must add up to 1, so both are equal to 0.5.\nThe event formula_97 is the observation of a plain cookie. From the contents of the bowls, we know that formula_98 and formula_99 Bayes' formula then yields\nformula_100\nBefore we observed the cookie, the probability we assigned for Fred having chosen bowl #1 was the prior probability, formula_101, which was 0.5. After observing the cookie, we must revise the probability to formula_102, which is 0.6.\nMaking a prediction.\nAn archaeologist is working at a site thought to be from the medieval period, between the 11th century to the 16th century. However, it is uncertain exactly when in this period the site was inhabited. Fragments of pottery are found, some of which are glazed and some of which are decorated. It is expected that if the site were inhabited during the early medieval period, then 1% of the pottery would be glazed and 50% of its area decorated, whereas if it had been inhabited in the late medieval period then 81% would be glazed and 5% of its area decorated. How confident can the archaeologist be in the date of inhabitation as fragments are unearthed?\nThe degree of belief in the continuous variable formula_103 (century) is to be calculated, with the discrete set of events formula_104 as evidence. Assuming linear variation of glaze and decoration with time, and that these variables are independent,\nformula_105\nformula_106\nformula_107\nformula_108\nAssume a uniform prior of formula_109, and that trials are independent and identically distributed. When a new fragment of type formula_110 is discovered, Bayes' theorem is applied to update the degree of belief for each formula_111:\nformula_112\nA computer simulation of the changing belief as 50 fragments are unearthed is shown on the graph. In the simulation, the site was inhabited around 1420, or formula_113. By calculating the area under the relevant portion of the graph for 50 trials, the archaeologist can say that there is practically no chance the site was inhabited in the 11th and 12th centuries, about 1% chance that it was inhabited during the 13th century, 63% chance during the 14th century and 36% during the 15th century. The Bernstein-von Mises theorem asserts here the asymptotic convergence to the \"true\" distribution because the probability space corresponding to the discrete set of events formula_104 is finite (see above section on asymptotic behaviour of the posterior).\nIn frequentist statistics and decision theory.\nA decision-theoretic justification of the use of Bayesian inference was given by Abraham Wald, who proved that every unique Bayesian procedure is admissible. Conversely, every admissible statistical procedure is either a Bayesian procedure or a limit of Bayesian procedures.\nWald characterized admissible procedures as Bayesian procedures (and limits of Bayesian procedures), making the Bayesian formalism a central technique in such areas of frequentist inference as parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, and computing confidence intervals. For example:\nModel selection.\nBayesian methodology also plays a role in model selection where the aim is to select one model from a set of competing models that represents most closely the underlying process that generated the observed data. In Bayesian model comparison, the model with the highest posterior probability given the data is selected. The posterior probability of a model depends on the evidence, or marginal likelihood, which reflects the probability that the data is generated by the model, and on the prior belief of the model. When two competing models are a priori considered to be equiprobable, the ratio of their posterior probabilities corresponds to the Bayes factor. Since Bayesian model comparison is aimed on selecting the model with the highest posterior probability, this methodology is also referred to as the maximum a posteriori (MAP) selection rule or the MAP probability rule.\nProbabilistic programming.\nWhile conceptually simple, Bayesian methods can be mathematically and numerically challenging. Probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) implement functions to easily build Bayesian models together with efficient automatic inference methods. This helps separate the model building from the inference, allowing practitioners to focus on their specific problems and leaving PPLs to handle the computational details for them.\nApplications.\nStatistical data analysis.\nSee the separate Wikipedia entry on Bayesian statistics, specifically the statistical modeling section in that page.\nComputer applications.\nBayesian inference has applications in artificial intelligence and expert systems. Bayesian inference techniques have been a fundamental part of computerized pattern recognition techniques since the late 1950s. There is also an ever-growing connection between Bayesian methods and simulation-based Monte Carlo techniques since complex models cannot be processed in closed form by a Bayesian analysis, while a graphical model structure \"may\" allow for efficient simulation algorithms like the Gibbs sampling and other Metropolis\u2013Hastings algorithm schemes. Recently Bayesian inference has gained popularity among the phylogenetics community for these reasons; a number of applications allow many demographic and evolutionary parameters to be estimated simultaneously.\nAs applied to statistical classification, Bayesian inference has been used to develop algorithms for identifying e-mail spam. Applications which make use of Bayesian inference for spam filtering include CRM114, DSPAM, Bogofilter, SpamAssassin, SpamBayes, Mozilla, XEAMS, and others. Spam classification is treated in more detail in the article on the na\u00efve Bayes classifier.\nSolomonoff's Inductive inference is the theory of prediction based on observations; for example, predicting the next symbol based upon a given series of symbols. The only assumption is that the environment follows some unknown but computable probability distribution. It is a formal inductive framework that combines two well-studied principles of inductive inference: Bayesian statistics and Occam's Razor. Solomonoff's universal prior probability of any prefix \"p\" of a computable sequence \"x\" is the sum of the probabilities of all programs (for a universal computer) that compute something starting with \"p\". Given some \"p\" and any computable but unknown probability distribution from which \"x\" is sampled, the universal prior and Bayes' theorem can be used to predict the yet unseen parts of \"x\" in optimal fashion.\nBioinformatics and healthcare applications.\nBayesian inference has been applied in different bioinformatics applications, including differential gene expression analysis. Bayesian inference is also used in a general cancer risk model, called CIRI (Continuous Individualized Risk Index), where serial measurements are incorporated to update a Bayesian model which is primarily built from prior knowledge.\nCosmology and astrophysical applications.\nThe Bayesian approach has been central to recent progress in cosmology and astrophysical applications, and extends to a wide range of astrophysical problems, including the characterisation of exoplanet (such as the fitting of atmosphere for k2-18b), parameter constraints with cosmological data, and calibration in astrophysical experiments.\nIn cosmology, it is often employed with computational techniques such as Markov chain Monte Carlo(MCMC) and Nested sampling algorithm to analyse complex datasets and navigate high-dimensional parameter space. A notable application is to the Planck 2018 CMB data for parameter inference.\nThe six base cosmological parameters in Lambda-CDM model are not predicted by a theory, but rather fitted from Cosmic microwave background (CMB) data to a chosen model of cosmology (the Lambda-CDM model). The bayesian code for cosmology `cobaya` sets up cosmological runs and interfaces cosmological likelihoods, Boltzmann code, which computes the predicted CMB anisotropies for any given set of cosmological parameters, with MCMC or nested sampler.\nThis computational framework is not limited to the standard model, it is also essential for testing alternative or extended theories of cosmology, such as theories with early dark energy, or modified gravity theories introducing additional parameters beyond Lambda-CDM. Bayesian model comparison can then be employed to calculate the evidence for competing models, providing a statistical basis to assess whether the data support them over the standard Lambda-CDM.\nIn the courtroom.\nBayesian inference can be used by jurors to coherently accumulate the evidence for and against a defendant, and to see whether, in totality, it meets their personal threshold for \"beyond a reasonable doubt\". Bayes' theorem is applied successively to all evidence presented, with the posterior from one stage becoming the prior for the next. The benefit of a Bayesian approach is that it gives the juror an unbiased, rational mechanism for combining evidence. It may be appropriate to explain Bayes' theorem to jurors in odds form, as betting odds are more widely understood than probabilities. Alternatively, a logarithmic approach, replacing multiplication with addition, might be easier for a jury to handle.\nIf the existence of the crime is not in doubt, only the identity of the culprit, it has been suggested that the prior should be uniform over the qualifying population. For example, if 1,000 people could have committed the crime, the prior probability of guilt would be 1/1000.\nThe use of Bayes' theorem by jurors is controversial. In the United Kingdom, a defence expert witness explained Bayes' theorem to the jury in \"R v Adams\". The jury convicted, but the case went to appeal on the basis that no means of accumulating evidence had been provided for jurors who did not wish to use Bayes' theorem. The Court of Appeal upheld the conviction, but it also gave the opinion that \"To introduce Bayes' Theorem, or any similar method, into a criminal trial plunges the jury into inappropriate and unnecessary realms of theory and complexity, deflecting them from their proper task.\"\nGardner-Medwin argues that the criterion on which a verdict in a criminal trial should be based is \"not\" the probability of guilt, but rather the \"probability of the evidence, given that the defendant is innocent\" (akin to a frequentist p-value). He argues that if the posterior probability of guilt is to be computed by Bayes' theorem, the prior probability of guilt must be known. This will depend on the incidence of the crime, which is an unusual piece of evidence to consider in a criminal trial. Consider the following three propositions:\n \"A\" \u2013 the known facts and testimony could have arisen if the defendant is guilty.\n \"B\" \u2013 the known facts and testimony could have arisen if the defendant is innocent.\n \"C\" \u2013 the defendant is guilty.\nGardner-Medwin argues that the jury should believe both \"A\" and not-\"B\" in order to convict. \"A\" and not-\"B\" implies the truth of \"C\", but the reverse is not true. It is possible that \"B\" and \"C\" are both true, but in this case he argues that a jury should acquit, even though they know that they will be letting some guilty people go free. See also Lindley's paradox.\nBayesian epistemology.\nBayesian epistemology is a movement that advocates for Bayesian inference as a means of justifying the rules of inductive logic.\nKarl Popper and David Miller have rejected the idea of Bayesian rationalism, i.e. using Bayes rule to make epistemological inferences: It is prone to the same vicious circle as any other justificationist epistemology, because it presupposes what it attempts to justify. According to this view, a rational interpretation of Bayesian inference would see it merely as a probabilistic version of falsification, rejecting the belief, commonly held by Bayesians, that high likelihood achieved by a series of Bayesian updates would prove the hypothesis beyond any reasonable doubt, or even with likelihood greater than 0.\nBayes and Bayesian inference.\nThe problem considered by Bayes in Proposition\u00a09 of his essay, \"An Essay Towards Solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances\", is the posterior distribution for the parameter \"a\" (the success rate) of the binomial distribution.\nHistory.\nThe term \"Bayesian\" refers to Thomas Bayes (1701\u20131761), who proved that probabilistic limits could be placed on an unknown event. However, it was Pierre-Simon Laplace (1749\u20131827) who introduced (as Principle VI) what is now called Bayes' theorem and used it to address problems in celestial mechanics, medical statistics, reliability, and jurisprudence. Early Bayesian inference, which used uniform priors following Laplace's principle of insufficient reason, was called \"inverse probability\" (because it infers backwards from observations to parameters, or from effects to causes). After the 1920s, \"inverse probability\" was largely supplanted by a collection of methods that came to be called frequentist statistics.\nIn the 20th century, the ideas of Laplace were further developed in two different directions, giving rise to \"objective\" and \"subjective\" currents in Bayesian practice. In the objective or \"non-informative\" current, the statistical analysis depends on only the model assumed, the data analyzed, and the method assigning the prior, which differs from one objective Bayesian practitioner to another. In the subjective or \"informative\" current, the specification of the prior depends on the belief (that is, propositions on which the analysis is prepared to act), which can summarize information from experts, previous studies, etc.\nIn the 1980s, there was a dramatic growth in research and applications of Bayesian methods, mostly attributed to the discovery of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, which removed many of the computational problems, and an increasing interest in nonstandard, complex applications. Despite growth of Bayesian research, most undergraduate teaching is still based on frequentist statistics. Nonetheless, Bayesian methods are widely accepted and used, such as for example in the field of machine learning.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\nElementary.\nThe following books are listed in ascending order of probabilistic sophistication:"}

A hooligan is a person that engages in illicit reckless behaviors and is a public nuisance.\nEtymology.\nThere are several theories regarding the origin of the word \"hooliganism,\" which is a derivative of the word hooligan. \"The Compact Oxford English Dictionary\" states that the word may have originated from the surname of a rowdy Irish family in a music hall song of the 1890s. Clarence Rook, in his 1899 book \"Hooligan Nights\", wrote that the word came from Patrick Hoolihan (or Hooligan), an Irish bouncer and thief who lived in London. In 2015, the BBC Scotland TV programme \"The Secret Life of Midges\" noted that the English commander-in-chief during the Jacobite rising of 1745, General Wade, misheard the local Scots Gaelic word for midge\u2014\"meanbh-chuileag\"\u2014and coined the word \"hooligan\" to describe his fury and frustration at the way the tiny biting creatures made the lives of him and his soldiers a misery; this derivation may be apocryphal.\nEarly usage.\nThe word first appeared in print in London police court reports in 1894 referring to the name of a gang of youths in the Lambeth area of London\u2014the \"Hooligan Boys\", and later\u2014the \"O'Hooligan Boys\".\nIn August 1898 the murder of Henry Mappin in Lambeth committed by a member of the gang drew further attention to the word which was immediately popularised by the press. The London newspaper \"The Daily Graphic\" wrote in an article on 22 August 1898, \"The avalanche of brutality which, under the name of 'Hooliganism'\u00a0... has cast such a dire slur on the social records of South London.\"\nThe inquest was carried out by Mr Braxton Hicks who \"remarked that the activity of the gang he referred to was not confined to Lambeth, but extended to numerous other districts. It was composed of young fellows who scorned to do a stroke of work, and obtained a living by blackmailing. It was a common practice for three or four of these men to walk into a shop and offer the shopman the alternative of giving them a dollar for drink or having his shop wrecked. In connection with the Oakley-street tragedy intimidation had reached an unexampled case. Witnesses had been warned that it would be as much as their life was worth to give evidence against John Darcy. On Wednesday plain-clothes men escorted the witnesses from the court singly. He himself had been warned\u00a0\u2014 not by anonymous letter but through a mysterious personal medium\u00a0\u2014 that if seen in a certain neighbourhood he would be done for. A magistrate had also told him that he had been the recipient of a like indignity.\"\nArthur Conan Doyle wrote in his 1904 short story \"The Adventure of the Six Napoleons\", \"It seemed to be one of those senseless acts of Hooliganism which occur from time to time, and it was reported to the constable on the beat as such.\" H. G. Wells wrote in his 1909 semi-autobiographical novel \"Tono-Bungay\", \"Three energetic young men of the hooligan type, in neck-wraps and caps, were packing wooden cases with papered-up bottles, amidst much straw and confusion.\"\nAccording to \"Life\" magazine (30 July 1951), the comic strip artist and political cartoonist Frederick Burr Opper introduced a character called Happy Hooligan in 1900; \"hapless Happy appeared regularly in U.S. newspapers for more than 30 years\", a \"naive, skinny, baboon-faced tramp who invariably wore a tomato can for a hat.\" \"Life\" brought this up by way of criticizing the Soviet U.N. delegate Yakov A. Malik for misusing the word. Malik had indignantly referred to anti-Soviet demonstrators in New York as \"hooligans\". Happy Hooligan, \"Life\" reminded its readers, \"became a national hero, not by making trouble, which Mr. Malik understands is the function of a hooligan, but by getting himself help.\"\nModern usage.\nLater, as the meaning of the word shifted slightly, none of the possible alternatives had precisely the same undertones of a person, usually young, who belongs to an informal group and commits acts of vandalism or criminal damage, starts fights, and who causes disturbances but is not a thief. Hooliganism is now related to sport.\nViolence in sports.\nThe words \"hooliganism\" and \"hooligan\" began to be associated with violence in sports, in particular from the 1970s in the UK with football hooliganism. The phenomenon, however, long preceded the modern term; for example, one of the earliest known instances of crowd violence at a sporting event took place in ancient Constantinople. Two chariot racing factions, the Blues and the Greens, were involved in the Nika riots which lasted around a week in 532 CE; nearly half the city was burned or destroyed, in addition to tens of thousands of deaths.\nSports crowd violence continues to be a worldwide concerning phenomenon exacting at times a large number of injuries, damage to property and casualties. Individual, contextual, social and environmental factors interact and influence one another through a dynamic process occurring at different levels. Macro-sociological accounts suggest that structural strains, experiences of deprivation or a low socio-economic background can at times be instrumental to the acceptance and reproduction of norms that tolerate great levels of violence and territoriality, which is a common feature of football hooliganism. Furthermore, social cleavages within societies facilitate the development of strong in-groups bonds and intense feelings of antagonism towards outsiders which in turn can facilitate group identification and affect the likelihood of fan violence.\nIn British sports.\nBeginning in at least the 1960s, the United Kingdom gained a reputation worldwide for football hooliganism; the phenomenon was often dubbed the \"British\" or \"English Disease\". However, since the 1980s and well into the 1990s the UK government has led a widescale crackdown on football related violence. While football hooliganism has been a growing concern in some continental European countries in recent years, British football fans now tend to have a better reputation abroad. Although reports of British football hooliganism still surface, the instances now tend to occur at pre-arranged locations rather than at the matches themselves.\nIn American sports.\nFootball (soccer) and other sports hooliganism overall is rare in the United States in part because of stricter legal penalties for vandalism and physical violence, club markets having their own territory of fans, venues banning weapons, stricter security during games, and a stronger taboo on politics, class, race, and religion into the American sporting culture. Although isolated drunken fights at games do occur, they rarely escalate to major brawling comparable to Europe and Latin America.\nIn the Soviet Union and Russia.\nIn the Soviet Union the word \"khuligan\" ( \u2013 transliteration of the English word) was used to refer to those perpetrating public misconduct. Hooliganism (, \"khuliganstvo\") was listed as a criminal offense, similar to disorderly conduct in some other jurisdictions, and used as a catch-all charge for prosecuting unapproved behavior.\nSince the fall of the Soviet Union, hooliganism is defined generally in the Criminal Code of Russia as a medium gravity crime.\nOlympic medalist Vasiliy Khmelevskiy was convicted of hooliganism for setting a costumed person on fire during a celebration in Minsk in 1979 and sentenced to five years of imprisonment. Mathias Rust was convicted of hooliganism, among other things, for his 1987 Cessna landing on Bolshoy Moskvoretsky Bridge next to Red Square.\nMore recently, the same charge has been leveled against members of the feminist punk group Pussy Riot for which three members each received a two-year sentence on 17 August 2012. Hooliganism charges were also levelled against the Greenpeace protesters in October 2013. In March 2022, Marina Ovsyannikova, a Russian journalist who held up a banner protesting the Russian invasion of Ukraine during a national news broadcast, was convicted of flouting Russian anti-protest laws and fined \u20bd30,000 for her actions. The Kremlin called her actions an act of hooliganism.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was also a leading proponent of the Flower Power movement.\nAs a member of the Chicago Seven, Hoffman was charged with and tried for activities during the 1968 Democratic National Convention, for conspiring to use interstate commerce with intent to incite a riot and crossing state lines with the intent to incite a riot under the anti-riot provisions of . Five of the Chicago Seven defendants, including Hoffman, were convicted of crossing state lines with intent to incite a riot; all of the convictions were vacated after an appeal and the U.S. Department of Justice declined to pursue another trial. Hoffman, along with all of the defendants and their attorneys were also convicted and sentenced for contempt of court by the judge; these convictions were also vacated after an appeal.\nHoffman continued his activism into the 1970s and remains an icon of the anti-Vietnam war movement and the counterculture era. He died by suicide with a phenobarbital overdose in 1989 at age 52.\nEarly life and education.\nAbbot Howard Hoffman was born November 30, 1936, in Worcester, Massachusetts, to Florence (n\u00e9e Schanberg) and John Hoffman. Hoffman was raised in a middle-class Jewish household and had two younger siblings. Hoffman's mother, Florence Schanberg, was born in Clinton, Massachusetts, to Orthodox Jewish immigrants from Austria. His father, John Hoffman, was born in Russia shortly after the failed 1905 revolution but rarely discussed his origins due to the anti-communist climate of the time. Hoffman only began to uncover his paternal family history while writing his autobiography in the 1970s.\nAccording to family accounts, the Hoffmans originally bore the surname Shapoznikoff and were lower-middle-class Jewish shopkeepers in Russia. Seeking to escape czarist repression, a relative named Jacob Shapoznikoff allegedly obtained or assumed the identity of a German named Hoffman to emigrate to the United States. He traveled via Siberia and Japan to California, eventually settling in New York, where he facilitated the immigration of other family members. Hoffman's paternal grandparents, Morris and Anna Shapoznikoff, immigrated to the U.S. around 1910. \nDuring his school days, he became known as a troublemaker who started fights, played pranks, vandalized school property, and referred to teachers by their first names. In his second year, Hoffman was expelled from Classical High School, a now-closed public high school in Worcester. As an atheist, Hoffman wrote a paper declaring that, \"God could not possibly exist, for if he did, there wouldn't be any suffering in the world.\" The irate teacher ripped up the paper and called him \"a Communist punk.\" Hoffman jumped on the teacher and started fighting him until he was restrained and removed from the school. On June 3, 1954, 17-year-old Hoffman was arrested for the first time, for driving without a license. After his expulsion, he attended Worcester Academy, graduating in 1955. Hoffman engaged in many behaviors typical of rebellious teenagers in the 1950s, such as riding motorcycles, wearing leather jackets, and sporting a ducktail haircut.\nUpon graduating, he enrolled at nearby Brandeis University, where he studied under professors such as noted psychologist Abraham Maslow, often considered the father of humanistic psychology. He was also a student of Marxist theorist Herbert Marcuse, who Hoffman said had a profound effect on his political outlook. Hoffman would later cite Marcuse's influence during his activism and his theories on revolution. He was on the Brandeis tennis team, which was coached by journalist Bud Collins. Hoffman graduated with a B.A. in psychology in 1959. That fall, he enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley, where he completed coursework toward a master's degree in psychology. Soon after, he married his girlfriend Sheila Karklin in May 1960.\nCountercultural activism.\nEarly activity.\nBefore his days as a leading member of the Yippie movement, Hoffman was involved with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), and organized Liberty House, which sold items to support the civil rights movement in the southern United States. During the Vietnam War, Hoffman was an anti-war activist, using deliberately comical and theatrical tactics.\nIn late 1966, Hoffman met with a radical community-action group called the Diggers and studied their ideology. He later returned to New York and published a book with this knowledge. Doing so was considered a violation by the Diggers. Diggers co-founder Peter Coyote explained:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Abbie, who was a friend of mine, was always a media junky. We explained everything to those guys, and they violated everything we taught them. Abbie went back, and the first thing he did was publish a book, with his picture on it, that blew the hustle of every poor person on the Lower East Side by describing every free scam then current in New York, which were then sucked dry by disaffected kids from Scarsdale.\nOne of Hoffman's well-known stunts was on August 24, 1967, when he led members of the movement to the gallery of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The protesters threw fistfuls of real and fake dollar bills down to the traders below, some of whom booed, while others began to scramble frantically to grab the money as fast as they could. Accounts of the amount of money that Hoffman and the group tossed was said to be as little as $30 to $300. Hoffman claimed to be pointing out that, metaphorically, that's what NYSE traders \"were already doing.\" \"We didn't call the press,\" wrote Hoffman, \"At that time we really had no notion of anything called a media event.\" Yet the press was quick to react and by evening the event was reported around the world. After that incident, the stock exchange spent $20,000 (approximately ) to enclose the gallery with bulletproof glass.\nIn October 1967, David Dellinger of the National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam asked Jerry Rubin to help mobilize and direct a march on the Pentagon. The protesters gathered at the Lincoln Memorial as Dellinger and Dr. Benjamin Spock gave speeches to the mass of people. From there, the group marched towards the Pentagon. As the protesters neared the Pentagon, they were met by soldiers of the 82nd Airborne Division who formed a human barricade blocking the Pentagon steps. Not to be dissuaded, Hoffman vowed to levitate the Pentagon claiming he would attempt to use psychic energy to levitate the Pentagon until it would turn orange and begin to vibrate, at which time the war in Vietnam would end. Allen Ginsberg led Tibetan chants to assist Hoffman.\nChicago Seven conspiracy trial.\nHoffman was a member of a group of defendants that became known as the Chicago Seven (originally known as the Chicago Eight), which included fellow Yippie Jerry Rubin, David Dellinger, Rennie Davis, John Froines, Lee Weiner, Tom Hayden, and Bobby Seale (before his trial was severed from the others), who were charged by the United States federal government with conspiracy, crossing state lines with intent to incite a riot, and other charges related to anti-Vietnam War and countercultural protests in Chicago, Illinois during the 1968 Democratic National Convention.\nPresided over by Judge Julius Hoffman (no relation to Hoffman, about which he joked throughout the trial), Abbie Hoffman's courtroom antics frequently grabbed the headlines; one day, defendants Hoffman and Rubin appeared in court dressed in judicial robes, while on another day, Hoffman was sworn in as a witness with his hand giving the finger. Judge Hoffman became the favorite courtroom target of the Chicago Seven defendants, who frequently would insult the judge to his face. Abbie Hoffman told Judge Hoffman \"you are a \"shande fur de goyim\" [disgrace in front of the gentiles]. You would have served Hitler better.\" He later added that \"your idea of justice is the only obscenity in the room.\" Both Davis and Rubin told the judge, \"This court is bullshit.\" When Hoffman was asked in what state he resided, he replied the \"state of mind of my brothers and sisters.\"\nOther celebrities were called as \"cultural witnesses\" including Allen Ginsberg, Phil Ochs, Arlo Guthrie, Judy Collins, Norman Mailer and others. Hoffman closed the trial with a speech in which he quoted Abraham Lincoln, making the claim that the president himself, were he alive today, would also have been arrested in Chicago's Lincoln Park.\nOn February 18, 1970, Hoffman and four of the other defendants (Rubin, Dellinger, Davis, and Hayden) were found guilty of intent to incite a riot while crossing state lines. All seven defendants were found not guilty of conspiracy. At sentencing, Hoffman suggested the judge try LSD and offered to set him up with \"a dealer he knew in Florida.\" (The judge was known to be headed to Florida for a post-trial vacation.) Each of the five was sentenced to five years in prison and given a $5,000 fine ().\nHowever, all convictions were subsequently overturned by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.\nContinuing protests.\nAt Woodstock in 1969, Hoffman interrupted the Who's performance to attempt to speak against the jailing of John Sinclair of the White Panther Party. He grabbed a microphone and yelled, \"I think this is a pile of shit while John Sinclair rots in prison\u00a0...\" Pete Townshend was adjusting his amplifier between songs and turned to look at Hoffman over his left shoulder. Townshend shouted \"Fuck off! Fuck off my fucking stage!\" and reportedly ran at Hoffman with his guitar and hit Hoffman in the back, although Townshend later denied attacking Hoffman. Townshend later said that while he actually agreed with Hoffman on Sinclair's imprisonment, he would have knocked him offstage regardless of the content of his message, given that Hoffman had violated the \"sanctity of the stage,\" i.e., the right of the band to perform uninterrupted by distractions not relevant to the show. The incident took place during a camera change and was not captured on film. The audio of this incident, however, can be heard on The Who's box set \"Thirty Years of Maximum R&amp;B\" (Disc 2, Track 20, \"Abbie Hoffman Incident\").\nIn \"Woodstock Nation\", Hoffman mentions the incident and says he was on a bad LSD trip at the time. Joe Shea, then a reporter for the \"Times Herald-Record\", a local newspaper that covered the event on-site, said he saw the incident. He recalled that Hoffman was actually hit in the back of the head by Townshend's guitar and toppled directly into the pit in front of the stage. He does not recall any \"shove\" from Townshend, and discounts both men's accounts.\nIn 1971, Hoffman published \"Steal This Book\", which advised readers on how to live for free. (Many readers followed his advice and stole the book, leading many bookstores to refuse to carry it.) The book contained a section called \"Free Communication,\" in which Hoffman encourages his readership to take to the stage at rock concerts to use the pre-assembled audience and PA system to get their message out. However, he mentions that \"interrupting the concert is frowned upon since it is only spitting in the faces of people you are trying to reach.\"\nHoffman was also the author of several other books, including \"Vote!\" co-written with Rubin and Ed Sanders.\nLater life.\nArrest and flight.\nHoffman was arrested on August 28, 1973, for intent to sell and distribute cocaine. He always maintained that undercover police agents entrapped him into a drug deal and planted suitcases of cocaine in his office. In the spring of 1974, Hoffman skipped bail, underwent cosmetic surgery to alter his appearance, and hid from authorities for several years.\nSome believed that Hoffman made himself a target. In 1998, Peter Coyote stated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The FBI couldn't infiltrate us. We did everything anonymously, and we did everything for nothing because we wanted our actions to be authentic. It's the mistake that Abbie Hoffman made. He came out, he studied with us, we taught him everything, and then he went back and wrote a book called \"Free,\" and he put his name on it! He set himself up to be a leader of the counterculture, and he was undone by that. Big mistake.\nHoffman lived under the name Barry Freed in Fineview, New York, near Thousand Island Park, a private resort on the St. Lawrence River. He helped coordinate an environmental campaign to preserve the St. Lawrence River. Hoffman also was the travel columnist for \"Crawdaddy!\" magazine. On September 4, 1980, he surrendered to authorities, and he appeared the same day on a pre-taped edition of ABC's \"20/20\" in an interview with Barbara Walters. Hoffman received a one-year sentence but was released after four months.\nReturn to activism.\nIn November 1986, Hoffman was arrested along with 14 others, including Amy Carter, the daughter of former President Jimmy Carter, for trespassing at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. The charges stemmed from a protest against the Central Intelligence Agency's recruitment on the UMass campus. Since the university's policy limited campus recruitment to law-abiding organizations, the defense argued that the CIA engaged in illegal activities. The federal district court judge permitted expert witnesses, including former Attorney General Ramsey Clark and a former CIA agent who testified that the CIA carried on an illegal Contra war against the Sandinista government in Nicaragua in violation of the Boland Amendment.\nIn three days of testimony, more than a dozen defense witnesses, including Daniel Ellsberg, and former Contra leader \u00c9dgar Chamorro, described the CIA's role in more than two decades of covert, illegal, and often violent activities. In his closing argument, Hoffman, acting as his own attorney, placed his actions within the best tradition of American civil disobedience. He quoted from Thomas Paine, \"the most outspoken and farsighted of the leaders of the American Revolution: 'Every age and generation must be as free to act for itself, in all cases, as the ages and generations which preceded it. Man has no property in man, neither has any generation a property in the generations which are to follow.'\"\nHoffman concluded: \"Thomas Paine was talking about this Spring day in this courtroom. A verdict of not guilty will say, 'When our country is right, keep it right; but when it is wrong, right those wrongs.'\" On April 15, 1987, the jury found Hoffman and the other defendants not guilty.\nAfter his acquittal, Hoffman acted in a cameo appearance in Oliver Stone's later-released anti-Vietnam War film, \"Born on the Fourth of July\" (1989). He essentially played himself in the movie, waving a flag on the ramparts of an administration building during a campus protest that was being teargassed and crushed by state troopers.\nDespite his return to activism, Hoffman also grew frustrated with the growing unwillingness of the younger generation to engage in protests.\nIn 1987 Hoffman summed up his views:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nLater that same year, Hoffman and Jonathan Silvers wrote \"Steal This Urine Test\" (published October 5, 1987), which exposed the internal contradictions of the war on drugs and suggested ways to circumvent its most intrusive measures. Although Hoffman's satiric humor was on display throughout the book, \"Publishers Weekly\" wrote that \"the extensive, in-depth research and a barrage of facts and figures... make this the definitive guide to the current drug-testing environment.\"\nStone's \"Born on the Fourth of July\" was released on December 20, 1989, just eight months after Hoffman's suicide on April 12, 1989. At the time of his death, Hoffman was at the height of a renewed public visibility, one of the few 1960s radicals who still commanded the attention of the media. He regularly lectured about the CIA's covert activities, including assassinations disguised as suicides. His \"Playboy\" article (October 1988) outlining the connections that constitute the \"October Surprise\", brought that alleged conspiracy to the attention of a wide-ranging American readership for the first time.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1960, Hoffman married Sheila Karklin (1938-2021), and had two children. Hoffman and Karklin divorced in 1966. In 1967, he married Anita Kushner (1942-1998) in Manhattan's Central Park. They had one son. He and Kushner were effectively separated when Hoffman became a fugitive in 1973, although they were not formally divorced until 1980. While underground, Hoffman's companion was Johanna Lawrenson.\nHis personal life drew a great deal of scrutiny from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), whose file on him was 13,262 pages long.\nDeath.\nHoffman was found dead in his apartment in Solebury Township, Pennsylvania, on April 12, 1989, age 52. The cause of death was suicide by overdose from 150 phenobarbital tablets and liquor. Two hundred pages of handwritten notes were nearby, many detailing his moods. He had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 1980. He had recently changed treatment medications and was reportedly depressed when his 83-year-old mother was diagnosed with cancer (she died in 1996 at age 90). Some who were close to him claimed that he was also unhappy about reaching middle age, combined with the fact that the liberal upheaval and rebelliousness of the 1960s and 1970s had been followed by a conservative backlash in the 1980s. In 1984, he had expressed dismay that the current generation of young people were not as interested in protesting and social activism as the youth had been during the 1960s.\nHis death was officially ruled a suicide. Hoffman's fellow Chicago Seven defendant David Dellinger disputed this; he said, \"I don't believe for one moment the suicide thing\" and said that Hoffman had \"numerous plans for the future.\" However, the coroner stood by the ruling, saying, \"There is no way to take that amount of phenobarbital without intent. It was intentional and self-inflicted.\"\nHis memorial service was held a week later in Worcester, Massachusetts, at Temple Emanuel, the synagogue that he attended as a child, with 1,000 friends and family members in attendance.\nMedia.\nAppearances in documentary films.\nHoffman is featured in interviews and archival news footage in the following documentaries:\n* of speeches during the Chicago DNC protests broadcast by Bob Fass\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It took place at Lewes in Sussex, on 14 May 1264. It marked the high point of the career of Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester, and made him the \"uncrowned King of England\". Henry III's forces left the safety of Lewes Castle and St. Pancras Priory to engage the barons in battle and were initially successful, with Henry's son Prince Edward routing part of the baronial army with a cavalry charge. However, Edward pursued his quarry off the battlefield and left Henry's men exposed. Henry was forced to launch an infantry attack up Offham Hill where he was defeated by the barons' men defending the summit. The royalists fled back to the castle and priory and the King was forced to sign the Mise of Lewes, ceding many of his powers to de Montfort.\nBackground.\nHenry III was an unpopular monarch due to his autocratic style, displays of favouritism and refusal to negotiate with the barons. The barons eventually imposed a constitutional reform known as the Provisions of Oxford upon Henry, including provision for a thrice-yearly meeting led by Simon de Montfort to discuss matters of government. Henry sought to escape the restrictions of the provisions and applied to Louis IX of France to arbitrate in the dispute. Louis agreed with Henry and annulled the provisions. Montfort was angered by this and rebelled against the King along with other barons in the Second Barons' War.\nThe war was not initially openly fought, each side toured the country to raise support for their army. A series of massacres of Jews in Worcester, London, Canterbury and other cities was conducted by Montfort's allies.\nBy May, the King's force had reached Lewes where they intended to halt to allow reinforcements to reach them. The King encamped at St. Pancras Priory with a force of infantry, while his son, Prince Edward (later King Edward I), commanded the cavalry at Lewes Castle to the north. De Montfort approached the King with the intention of negotiating a truce or, failing that, to draw him into open battle. The King rejected the negotiations, and de Montfort moved his men from Fletching to Offham Hill, a mile to the north-west of Lewes, in a night march that surprised the royalist forces.\nDeployment.\nThe royalist army approached twice the size of de Montfort's. Henry commanded the centre, with Prince Edward, William de Valence, 1st Earl of Pembroke, and John de Warenne, 6th Earl of Surrey, on the right; and Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall, and his son, Henry of Almain, on the left. The barons held the higher ground overlooking Lewes and had ordered their men to wear white crosses as a distinguishing emblem. De Montfort split his forces into four parts, giving his son, Henry de Montfort command of one quarter; Gilbert de Clare with John FitzJohn and William of Montchensy another; a third portion consisting of Londoners was placed under Nicholas de Segrave whilst de Montfort himself led the fourth quarter with Thomas of Pelveston.\nBattle.\nThe baronial forces commenced the battle with a surprise dawn attack on foragers sent out from the royalist forces. The King then made his move. Edward led a cavalry charge against Segrave's Londoners, placed on the left of the baronial line, that caused them to break and flee to the village of Offham. Edward pursued them for some , leaving the King unsupported. Henry was forced to launch an attack with his centre and right divisions straight up Offham Hill into the baronial line, which awaited them at the defensive. Cornwall's division faltered almost immediately, but Henry's men fought on until compelled to retreat by the arrival of de Montfort's men who had been held back as the baronial reserve.\nThe King's men were forced down the hill and into Lewes where they engaged in a fighting retreat to the castle and priory. Edward returned with his weary cavalrymen and launched a counterattack. However, upon locating his father, Edward was persuaded that, with the town ablaze and many of the King's supporters having fled, it was time to accept de Montfort's renewed offer of negotiations. The Earl of Cornwall was captured by the barons when he was unable to reach the safety of the priory and, being discovered in a windmill, was taunted with cries of \"Come down, come down, thou wicked miller.\"\nAftermath.\nThe King was forced to sign the so-called Mise of Lewes. Though the document has not survived, it is clear that Henry was forced to accept the Provisions of Oxford, while Prince Edward remained a hostage of the barons. This put de Montfort in a position of ultimate power, which would last until Prince Edward's escape, and de Montfort's subsequent defeat and death at the Battle of Evesham in August 1265. Following the battle, debts to Jews were cancelled, and the records destroyed; this had been a key war aim.\nIn 1994, an archaeological survey of the cemetery of St Nicholas Hospital, in Lewes revealed the remains of bodies that were thought to be combatants from the Battle of Lewes. In 2014, it was stated that some of the skeletons might be much older, with a skeleton known as \"skeleton 180\" being contemporary with the Norman invasion.\nLocation.\nThere remains some uncertainty over the location of the battle, with Offham Hill's eastern and lower slopes covered by modern housing. Recently, a new consensus on the location of the main engagement places it on the current location of HM Prison Lewes. Contemporary sources suggest the initial engagement took place along the approximate lines of what is now Nevill Road. The top and southern slopes remain accessible by footpaths across agricultural land, and the ruins of the priory and castle are also open to visitors.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "49584", "revid": "48523215", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49584", "title": "Stanley Baldwin", "text": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (1923\u20131929; 1935\u20131937)\nStanley Baldwin, 1st Earl Baldwin of Bewdley (3 August 1867\u00a0\u2013 14 December 1947), was a British statesman and Conservative politician who was prominent in the political leadership of the United Kingdom between the world wars. He was prime minister on three occasions, from May 1923 to January 1924, from November 1924 to June 1929 and from June 1935 to May 1937.\nBorn to a prosperous family in Bewdley, Worcestershire, Baldwin was educated at Hawtreys, Harrow School and Trinity College, Cambridge. He joined the family iron- and steel-making business and entered the House of Commons in 1908 as the member for Bewdley, succeeding his father Alfred. He was Financial Secretary to the Treasury (1917\u20131921) and President of the Board of Trade (1921\u20131922) in the coalition ministry of David Lloyd George and then rose rapidly. In 1922, Baldwin was one of the prime movers in the withdrawal of Conservative support from Lloyd George; he subsequently became Chancellor of the Exchequer in Bonar Law's Conservative ministry. Upon Law's resignation for health reasons in May 1923, Baldwin became prime minister and leader of the Conservative Party. He called an election in December 1923 on the issue of tariffs and lost the Conservatives' parliamentary majority, after which Ramsay MacDonald formed a minority Labour government.\nAfter winning the 1924 general election, Baldwin formed his second government, which saw important tenures of office by Austen Chamberlain (Foreign Secretary), Winston Churchill (at the Exchequer) and Neville Chamberlain (Health). The latter two ministers strengthened Conservative appeal by reforms in areas formerly associated with the Liberal Party. They included industrial conciliation, unemployment insurance, a more extensive old-age pension system, slum clearance, more private housing and expansion of maternal care and childcare. However, continuing sluggish economic growth and declines in mining and heavy industry weakened Baldwin's base of support. His government also saw the General Strike in 1926 and introduced the Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act 1927 to curb the powers of trade unions.\nBaldwin narrowly lost the 1929 general election and his continued leadership of the party was subject to extensive criticism by press barons Lord Rothermere and Lord Beaverbrook. In 1931, with the onset of the Great Depression, Labour Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald formed a National Government, most of whose ministers were Conservatives, which won an enormous majority at the 1931 general election. As Lord President of the Council and one of four Conservatives among the small ten-member Cabinet, Baldwin took over many of the Prime Minister's duties when MacDonald's health deteriorated. This government saw an Act delivering increased self-government for India, a measure opposed by Churchill and by many rank-and-file Conservatives. The Statute of Westminster 1931 gave Dominion status to Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, while taking the first step towards the Commonwealth of Nations. As party leader, Baldwin made many striking innovations, such as clever use of radio and film, that made him highly visible to the public and strengthened Conservative appeal.\nIn 1935, Baldwin replaced MacDonald as prime minister and won the 1935 general election with another large majority. During this time, he oversaw the beginning of British rearmament and the abdication of King Edward VIII. Baldwin's third government saw a number of crises in foreign affairs, including the public uproar over the Hoare\u2013Laval Pact, the remilitarisation of the Rhineland, and the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. Baldwin stepped down on 28 May 1937 and was succeeded by Neville Chamberlain.\nHistorical retrospection and analysis of Baldwin's political career have been complex. During his tenure, Baldwin was regarded as a popular and successful prime minister, but for the final decade of his life and for many years afterwards he was vilified for having presided over high unemployment in the 1930s and as one of those who appeased Adolf Hitler and \u2013 supposedly \u2013 failed to rearm sufficiently to prepare for the Second World War. Baldwin has been widely praised for forcing and expediting the abdication of Edward VIII. Today, modern scholars generally rank him in the upper half of British prime ministers.\nEarly life: family, education and marriage.\nStanley Baldwin was born on 3 August 1867 at Lower Park House (Lower Park, Bewdley) in Worcestershire, England. He was the first and only son of Alfred and Louisa (MacDonald) Baldwin. Through his mother was a first cousin of, and had a lifelong friendship with, the writer and poet Rudyard Kipling. A summer spent with Kipling and his sister with the freedom of farm and forest at Loughton, Essex, in 1877 was seminal to the development of both boys.\nThe family was prosperous, and owned the eponymous iron- and steel-making business that in later years became part of Richard Thomas and Baldwins. His ancestors were involved in the iron industry since the days of the Industrial Revolution. On his father's side Baldwin was purely English, while on his mother's side he was of Scottish and Welsh descent.\nBaldwin's schools were St Michael's School, at the time located in Slough, Buckinghamshire (now Berkshire), followed by Harrow School. He later wrote that \"all the king's horses and all the king's men would have failed to have drawn me into the company of school masters, and in relation to them I once had every qualification as a passive resister.\" Baldwin then went on to the University of Cambridge, where he studied history at Trinity College. His time at university was blighted by the presence, as Master of Trinity, of Henry Montagu Butler, his former headmaster who had punished him at Harrow for writing a piece of schoolboy smut. He was asked to resign from the Magpie &amp; Stump (the Trinity College debating society) for never speaking, and, after receiving a third-class degree in history, he went into the family business of iron manufacturing. His father sent him to Mason College for one session of technical training in metallurgy as preparation. As a young man he served briefly as a second lieutenant in the Artillery Volunteers at Malvern, and in 1897 became a JP for the county of Worcestershire.\nBaldwin married Lucy Ridsdale on 12 September 1892. Following the birth of a still-born son in January 1894, the couple had six surviving children:\nBaldwin's youngest daughter, Lady Betty, was severely injured by shrapnel in March 1941 as a result of a bombing raid which destroyed the Caf\u00e9 de Paris nightclub she was attending. She required facial reconstruction surgery from the pioneering surgeon Archibald MacIndoe.\nBaldwin proved to be an adept businessman, and acquired a reputation as a modernising industrialist. He inherited \u00a3200,000, , and a directorship of the Great Western Railway on the death of his father in 1908.\nEarly political career.\nMember of Parliament.\nIn the 1906 general election he contested Kidderminster but lost amidst the Conservative landslide defeat after the party split on the issue of free trade. In a by-election in 1908 he was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Bewdley, in which role he succeeded his father, who had died earlier that year. During the First World War he became Parliamentary Private Secretary to the party leader Bonar Law. In 1917 he was appointed to the junior ministerial post of Financial Secretary to the Treasury, where he sought to encourage voluntary donations by the rich to repay the United Kingdom's war debt, writing letters to \"The Times\" under the pseudonym 'FST', many of which were published. He relinquished to the Treasury one fifth of his own fortune (its total estimated at own account as \u00a3580,000) held in the form of War Loan stock worth \u00a3120,000.\nTreasury and President of the Board of Trade.\nAlthough he entered politics at a relatively late age, his rise to the top leadership was very rapid. In the Treasury he served jointly with Hardman Lever, who had been appointed in 1916, but after 1919 Baldwin carried out the duties largely alone. He was appointed to the Privy Council in the 1920 Birthday Honours. In 1921 he was promoted to the Cabinet as President of the Board of Trade.\nChancellor of the Exchequer.\nIn late 1922 dissatisfaction was steadily growing within the Conservative Party over its coalition with the Liberal David Lloyd George. At a meeting of Conservative MPs at the Carlton Club in October, Baldwin announced that he would no longer support the coalition, and famously condemned Lloyd George for being a \"dynamic force\" that was bringing destruction across politics. The meeting chose to leave the coalition, against the wishes of most of the party leadership. As a direct result Bonar Law was forced to search for new ministers for a Cabinet which he would lead, and so promoted Baldwin to the position of Chancellor of the Exchequer. In the 15 November 1922 general election the Conservatives were returned with a majority in their own right.\nPrime Minister (1923\u20131924).\nAppointment.\nIn May 1923 Bonar Law was diagnosed with terminal cancer and retired immediately; he died five months later. With many of the party's senior leading figures standing aloof and outside of the government, there were only two candidates to succeed him: Lord Curzon, the foreign secretary, and Baldwin. The choice formally fell to King George V acting on the advice of senior ministers and officials.\nIt is not entirely clear what factors proved most crucial, but some Conservative politicians felt that Curzon was unsuitable for the role of prime minister because he was a member of the House of Lords. Curzon was strong and experienced in international affairs, but his lack of experience in domestic affairs, his personal character quirks and his huge inherited wealth and many directorships at a time when the Conservative Party was seeking to shed its patrician image were all deemed impediments. Much weight at the time was given to the intervention of Arthur Balfour.\nThe King turned to Baldwin to become prime minister. Initially Baldwin was also Chancellor of the Exchequer whilst he sought to recruit the former Liberal Chancellor Reginald McKenna to join the government. When this failed he appointed Neville Chamberlain to that position.\n1923 general election.\nThe Conservatives now had a clear majority in the House of Commons and could govern for five years before holding a general election, but Baldwin felt bound by Bonar Law's pledge at the previous election that there would be no introduction of tariffs without a further election. Thus Baldwin turned towards a degree of protectionism which would remain a key party message during his lifetime. With the country facing growing unemployment in the wake of free trade imports driving down prices and profits, Baldwin decided to call an early general election in December 1923 to seek a mandate to introduce protectionist tariffs which, he hoped, would drive down unemployment and spur an economic recovery. He expected to unite his party but he divided it, for protectionism proved a divisive issue. The election was inconclusive: the Conservatives had 258 MPs, Labour 191 and the reunited Liberals 159. Whilst the Conservatives retained a plurality in the House of Commons, they had been clearly defeated on the central issue: tariffs. Baldwin remained prime minister until the opening of the new Parliament in January 1924, when his administration was defeated in a vote on its legislative programme set out in the King's Speech. He offered his resignation to George V immediately.\nLeader of the Opposition (1924).\nBaldwin successfully held on to the party leadership amid some colleagues' calls for his resignation. For the next ten months, an unstable minority Labour government under Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald held office. On 13 March 1924, the Labour government was defeated for the first time in the Commons, although the Conservatives decided to vote with Labour later that day against the Liberals.\nDuring a debate on the naval estimates the Conservatives opposed Labour but supported them on 18 March in a vote on cutting expenditure on the Singapore Naval Base. Baldwin also cooperated with MacDonald over Irish policy to stop it becoming a party-political issue.\nThe Labour government was negotiating with the Soviet government over intended commercial treaties \u2013 'the Russian Treaties' \u2013 to provide most favoured nation privileges and diplomatic status for the UK trade delegation; and a treaty that would settle the claims of pre-revolutionary British bondholders and holders of confiscated property, after which the British government would guarantee a loan to the Soviet Union. Baldwin decided to vote against the government over the Russian Treaties, which brought the government down on 8 October.\n1924 re-election.\nThe general election held in October 1924 brought a landslide majority of 223 for the Conservative party, primarily at the expense of an unpopular Liberal Party. Baldwin campaigned on the \"impracticability\" of socialism, the Campbell Case, the Zinoviev letter (which Baldwin thought was genuine, and the Conservatives leaked to the \"Daily Mail\" at a most damaging time to the Labour campaign; the letter is now widely believed to have been a forgery) and the Russian Treaties. In a speech during the campaign Baldwin said:\nIt makes my blood boil to read of the way which Mr. Zinoviev is speaking of the Prime Minister today. Though one time there went up a cry, \"Hands off Russia\", I think it's time somebody said to Russia, \"Hands off England\".\nPrime Minister (1924\u20131929).\nCabinet.\nBaldwin's new Cabinet now included many former political associates of Lloyd George: former Coalition Conservatives: Austen Chamberlain (as foreign secretary), Lord Birkenhead (secretary for India) and Arthur Balfour (lord president after 1925), and the former Liberal Winston Churchill as chancellor of the exchequer. Baldwin created the Organisation for the Maintenance of Supplies, a volunteer body of those opposed to the strike which was intended to complete essential work.\nIn 1927, he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society.\nDomestic affairs.\nTrade unions strike.\nA defining feature of Baldwin's Second term was the 1926 General Strike, Baldwin handled the strike by using powers awarded to him in the Emergency Powers Act 1920. He deployed the military and volunteers to keep essential services running. The strike ended when it was found to not be protected by the Trade Disputes Act 1906, leading to the strike being called off on 12 May lasting just 9 days. Baldwin's government was widely credited for such an effective response to the strike.\nAt Baldwin's instigation Lord Weir headed a committee to \"review the national problem of electrical energy\". It published its report on 14 May 1925 and in it Weir recommended the setting up of a Central Electricity Board, a state monopoly half-financed by the Government and half by local undertakings. Baldwin accepted Weir's recommendations and they became law by the end of 1926.\nThe Board was a success. By 1939 electrical output was up fourfold and generating costs had fallen. Consumers of electricity rose from three-quarters of a million in 1920 to nine million in 1938, with annual growth of 700,000 to 800,000 a year (the fastest rate of growth in the world).\nSocial reforms.\nOne of his legislative reforms was a paradigm shift in his party. This was the Widows', Orphans' and Old Age Contributory Pensions Act 1925 (15 &amp; 16 Geo. 5. c. 70), which provided a pension of 10 shillings a week for widows with extra for children, and 10 shillings a week for insured workers and their wives at 65. This transformed Toryism, away from its historic reliance on community (particularly religious) charities, and towards acceptance of a humanitarian welfare state which would guarantee a minimum living standard for those unable to work or who took out national insurance. \nIn addition, the Local Government Act 1929 (19 &amp; 20 Geo. 5. c. 17) abolished the workhouse test and replaced the Poor Law with public bodies known as public assistance committees for the relief of the poor and destitute. \nFinally, the Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928 lowered the minimum voting age for women from 30 to 21, on a par with men.\nLeader of the Opposition (1929\u20131931).\nIn 1929 Labour returned to office as the largest party in the House of Commons (although without an overall majority) despite obtaining fewer votes than the Conservatives. In opposition, Baldwin was almost ousted as party leader by the press barons Lords Rothermere and Beaverbrook, whom he accused of enjoying \"power without responsibility, the prerogative of the harlot throughout the ages\".\nRamsden argues that Baldwin made dramatic permanent improvements to the organisation and effectiveness of the Conservative Party. He enlarged the headquarters with professionals, professionalised the party agents, raised ample funds, and was an innovative user of the new mass media of radio and film.\nLord President of the Council (1931\u20131935).\nBy 1931, as the economy headed towards crisis, both in Britain and around the world, with the onset of the Great Depression, Baldwin and the Conservatives entered into a coalition with Labour Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald. This decision led to MacDonald's expulsion from his own party, and Baldwin, as Lord President of the Council, became \"de facto\" prime minister, deputising for MacDonald (whose health was steadily deteriorating) until he once again officially became prime minister in 1935.\nOne central and vitally important agreement was the Statute of Westminster 1931, which conferred full self-government upon the Dominions Canada, South Africa, Australia, the Irish Free State and New Zealand, while preparing the first steps towards the eventual Commonwealth of Nations, and away from the designation British Empire. In 1930, the first British Empire Games sports competition (now the Commonwealth Games) was held successfully among Empire nations in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.\nHis government then secured with great difficulty the passage of the landmark Government of India Act 1935, in the teeth of opposition from Winston Churchill, spokesman for the die-hard imperialists who filled the Conservative ranks.\nDisarmament.\nBaldwin did not advocate total disarmament, but believed that, as Lord Grey of Falloden had stated in 1925, \"great armaments lead inevitably to war\". However, he came to believe that, as he put it on 10 November 1932: \"the time has now come to an end when Great Britain can proceed with unilateral disarmament\". On 10 November 1932 he said:\nI think it is well also for the man in the street to realise that there is no power on earth that can protect him from being bombed. Whatever people may tell him, the bomber will always get through, The only defence is in offence, which means that you have to kill more women and children more quickly than the enemy if you want to save yourselves...If the conscience of the young men should ever come to feel, with regard to this one instrument [bombing] that it is evil and should go, the thing will be done; but if they do not feel like that \u2013 well, as I say, the future is in their hands. But when the next war comes, and European civilisation is wiped out, as it will be, and by no force more than that force, then do not let them lay blame on the old men. Let them remember that they, principally, or they alone, are responsible for the terrors that have fallen upon the earth.\nThis speech was often used against Baldwin as allegedly demonstrating the futility of rearmament or disarmament, depending on the critic.\nWith the second part of the Disarmament Conference starting in January 1933, Baldwin attempted to see through his hope of air disarmament. However, he became alarmed at Britain's lack of defence against air raids and German rearmament, saying it \"would be a terrible thing, in fact, the beginning of the end\". In April 1933 the Cabinet agreed to follow through with the construction of the Singapore military base.\nOn 15 September 1933, the German delegate at the Disarmament Conference refused to return to the Conference, and Germany left altogether in October. Baldwin, in a speech on 6 October to the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, pleaded for a Disarmament Convention, and then said:\nwhen I speak of a Disarmament Convention I do not mean disarmament on the part of this country and not on the part of any other. I mean the limitation of armaments as a real limitation...and if we find ourselves on some lower rating and that some other country has higher figures, that country has to come down and we have to go up until we meet.\nGermany left the League of Nations on 14 October. The Cabinet decided on 23 October that Britain should still attempt to cooperate with other states, including Germany, in international disarmament. However between mid-September 1933 and the beginning of 1934 Baldwin's mind changed from hoping for disarmament to favouring rearmament, including parity in aircraft. In late 1933 and early 1934 he rejected an invitation from Hitler to meet him, believing that visits to foreign capitals were the job of Foreign Secretaries. On 8 March 1934, Baldwin defended the creation of four new squadrons for the Royal Air Force against Labour criticisms, and said of international disarmament:\nIf all our efforts for an agreement fail, and if it is not possible to obtain this equality in such matters as I have indicated, then any Government of this country\u2014a National Government more than any, and \"this\" Government\u2014will see to it that in air strength and air power this country shall no longer be in a position inferior to any country within striking distance of our shores.\nOn 29 March 1934 Germany published its defence estimates, which showed a total increase of one-third and an increase of 250% in its air force.\nA series of by-elections in late 1933 and early 1934 with massive swings against government candidates\u2014most famous was Fulham East with a 26.5% swing\u2014 convinced Baldwin that the British public was profoundly pacifist. Baldwin also rejected the \"belligerent\" views of those like Churchill and Robert Vansittart because he believed that the Nazis were rational men who would appreciate the logic of mutual and equal deterrence. He also believed war to be \"the most fearful terror and prostitution of man's knowledge that ever was known\".\nPrime Minister (1935\u20131937).\nNational Government and appointment.\nWith MacDonald's health in decline, he and Baldwin changed places in June 1935: Baldwin was now prime minister, MacDonald Lord President of the council. In October that year, Baldwin called a general election. Neville Chamberlain advised Baldwin to make rearmament the leading issue in the election campaign against Labour and said that if a rearmament programme was not announced until after the election, his government would be seen as having deceived the people. However, Baldwin did not make rearmament the central issue in the election. He said that he would support the League of Nations, modernise Britain's defences and remedy deficiencies, but he also said: \"I give you my word that there will be no great armaments\". The main issues in the election were housing, unemployment and the special areas of economic depression. The election gave 430 seats to National Government supporters (386 of these Conservative) and 154 seats to Labour.\nRearmament.\nBaldwin's younger son A. Windham Baldwin, writing in 1955, argued that his father, Stanley, had planned a rearmament programme as early as 1934 but had to do so quietly to avoid antagonising the public, whose pacifism was revealed by the Peace Ballot of 1934\u201335 and endorsed by both the Labour and the Liberal oppositions. His thorough presentation of the case for rearmament in 1935, his son argued, defeated pacifism and secured a victory that allowed rearmament to move ahead.\nOn 31 July 1934, the Cabinet approved a report that called for expansion of the Royal Air Force to the 1923 standard by creating 40 new squadrons over the next five years. On 26 November 1934, six days after receiving the news that the German air force (Luftwaffe) would be as large as the RAF within one year, the Cabinet decided to speed up air rearmament from four years to two. On 28 November 1934, Churchill moved an amendment to the vote of thanks for the King's Speech: \"the strength of our national defences, and especially our air defences, is no longer adequate\". His motion was known eight days before it was moved, and a special Cabinet meeting decided how to deal with the motion, which dominated two other Cabinet meetings. Churchill said Nazi Germany was rearming and requested that the money spent on air armaments be doubled or tripled to deter an attack and that the \"Luftwaffe\" was nearing equality with the RAF. Baldwin responded by denying that the Luftwaffe was approaching equality and said it was \"not 50 per cent\" of the RAF. He added that by the end of 1935 the RAF would still have \"a margin of nearly 50 per cent\" in Europe. After Baldwin said that the government would ensure the RAF had parity with the future German air force, Churchill withdrew his amendment. In April 1935, the Air Secretary reported that although Britain's strength in the air would be ahead of Germany's for at least three years, air rearmament needed to be increased; so the Cabinet agreed to the creation of an extra 39 squadrons for home defence by 1937. However, on 8 May 1935, the Cabinet heard that it was estimated that the RAF was inferior to the Luftwaffe by 370 aircraft and that to reach parity, the RAF must have 3,800 aircraft by April 1937, an extra 1,400 above the existing air programme. It was learnt that Nazi Germany was easily able to outbuild that revised programme as well. On 21 May 1935, the Cabinet agreed to expanding the home defence force of the RAF to 1,512 aircraft (840 bombers and 420 fighters). (see also )\nOn 22 May 1935 Baldwin confessed in the House of Commons, \"I was wrong in my estimate of the future. There I was completely wrong.\"\nOn 25 February 1936, the Cabinet approved a report calling for expansion of the Royal Navy and the re-equipment of the British Army (though not its expansion), along with the creation of \"shadow factories\" built by public money and managed by industrial companies. The factories came into operation in 1937. In February 1937, the Chiefs of Staff reported that by May 1937, the Luftwaffe would have 800 bombers, compared to the RAF's 48.\nIn the debate in the Commons on 12 November 1936, Churchill attacked the government on rearmament as being \"decided only to be undecided, resolved to be irresolute, adamant for drift, solid for fluidity, all-powerful to be impotent. So we go on, preparing more months and years \u2013 precious, perhaps vital, to the greatness of Britain \u2013 for the locusts to eat\". Baldwin replied:\nI put before the whole House my own views with an appalling frankness. From 1933, I and my friends were all very worried about what was happening in Europe. You will remember at that time the Disarmament Conference was sitting in Geneva. You will remember at that time there was probably a stronger pacifist feeling running through the country than at any time since the War. I am speaking of 1933 and 1934. You will remember the election at Fulham in the autumn of 1933... That was the feeling of the country in 1933. My position as a leader of a great party was not altogether a comfortable one. I asked myself what chance was there... within the next year or two of that feeling being so changed that the country would give a mandate for rearmament? Supposing I had gone to the country and said that Germany was rearming and we must rearm, does anybody think that this pacific democracy would have rallied to that cry at that moment! I cannot think of anything that would have made the loss of the election from my point of view more certain... We got from the country \u2013 with a large majority \u2013 a mandate for doing a thing that no one, twelve months before, would have believed possible.\nChurchill wrote to a friend: \"I have never heard such a squalid confession from a public man as Baldwin offered us yesterday\". In 1935 Baldwin wrote to J. C. C. Davidson in a letter now lost that said of Churchill: \"If there is going to be a war \u2013 and no one can say that there is not \u2013 we must keep him fresh to be our war Prime Minister\". Thomas Dugdale also claimed Baldwin said to him: \"If we do have a war, Winston must be Prime Minister. If he is in [the Cabinet] now we shan't be able to engage in that war as a united nation\". The General Secretary of the Trades Union Congress, Walter Citrine, recalled a conversation he had had with Baldwin on 5 April 1943: \"Baldwin thought his [Churchill's] political recovery was marvellous. He, personally, had always thought that if war came Winston would be the right man for the job\".\nThe Labour Party strongly opposed the rearmament programme. Clement Attlee said on 21 December 1933: \"For our part, we are unalterably opposed to anything in the nature of rearmament\". On 8 March 1934, Attlee said, after Baldwin defended the Air Estimates, \"we on our side are out for total disarmament\". On 30 July 1934, Labour moved a motion of censure against the government because of its planned expansion of the RAF. Attlee spoke for it: \"We deny the need for increased air arms...and we reject altogether the claim of parity\". Stafford Cripps also said on that occasion that it was fallacy that Britain could achieve security through increasing air armaments. On 22 May 1935, the day after Hitler had made a Reichstag speech claiming that German rearmament offered no threat to peace, Attlee asserted that Hitler's speech gave \"a chance to call a halt in the armaments race\". Attlee also denounced the Defence White Paper of 1937: \"I do not believe the Government are going to get any safety through these armaments\".\nAbdication of Edward VIII.\nThe accession of King Edward VIII, and the ensuing abdication crisis, brought Baldwin's last major test in office. The new monarch was \"an ardent exponent of the cause of Anglo-German understanding\" and had \"strong views on his right to intervene in affairs of state,\" but the \"Government's main fears... were of indiscretion.\" The King proposed to marry Wallis Simpson, an American woman who was twice divorced. The high-minded Baldwin felt that he could tolerate her as \"a respectable whore\" as long as she stayed behind the throne but not as \"Queen Wally\".\nMrs. Simpson was also distrusted by the government for her known pro-German sympathies and was believed to be in \"close contact with German monarchist circles\".\nDuring October and November 1936, Baldwin joined the royal family in trying to dissuade the King from that marriage, arguing that the idea of having a twice-divorced woman as the Queen would be rejected by the government, by the country and by the Empire and that \"the voice of the people must be heard.\" As the public standing of the King would be gravely compromised, the Prime Minister gave him time to reconsider the notion of this marriage. According to the historian Philip Williamson, \"The offence lay in the implications of [the King's] attachment to Mrs. Simpson for the broader public morality and the constitutional integrity which were now perceived\u2014especially by Baldwin\u2014as underpinning the nation's unity and strength.\"\nNews of the affair was broken in the newspapers on 2 December. There was some support for the wishes of the King, especially in and around London. The romantic royalists Churchill, Mosley, and the press barons, Lord Beaverbrook of the \"Daily Express\" and Lord Rothermere of the \"Daily Mail\", all declared that the king had a right to marry whichever woman he wished. The crisis assumed a political dimension when Beaverbrook and Churchill tried to rally support for the marriage in Parliament. However, the King's party could muster only 40 Members of Parliament in support, and the majority opinion sided with Baldwin and his Conservative government. The Labour leader, Clement Attlee, told Baldwin \"that while Labour people had no objection to an American becoming Queen, [he] was certain they would not approve of Mrs. Simpson for that position\", especially in the provinces and in the Commonwealth countries. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Cosmo Lang, held that the King, as the head of the Church of England, should not marry a divorc\u00e9e. \"The Times\" argued that the monarchy's prestige would be destroyed if \"private inclination were to come into open conflict with public duty and be allowed to prevail\".\nWhile some recent critics have complained that \"Baldwin refused the reasonable request for time to reflect, preferring to keep the pressure on the King \u2013 once again suggesting that his own agenda was to force the crisis to a head\" and that he \"never mentioned that the alternative [to the marriage] was abdication\", the House of Commons immediately and overwhelmingly came out against the marriage. The Labour and Liberal parties, the Trades Union Congress, and the dominions of Australia and Canada, all joined the British cabinet in rejecting the King's compromise, initially supported and perhaps conceived by Churchill, for a morganatic marriage that had originally been made on 16 November. The crisis threatened the unity of the British Empire, since the King's personal relationship with the Dominions was their \"only remaining constitutional link\".\nBaldwin still hoped that the King would choose the throne over Mrs. Simpson. For the King to act against the wishes of the cabinet would have precipitated a constitutional crisis. Baldwin would have had to resign, and no other party leader would have served as the prime minister under the King, with the Labour Party having already indicated that it would not form a ministry to uphold impropriety. Baldwin told the Cabinet, one Labour MP had asked, \"Are we going to have a fascist monarchy?\" When the Cabinet refused the morganatic marriage, Edward decided to abdicate.\nThe King's final plea, on 4 December, to broadcast an appeal to the nation was rejected by the Prime Minister as too divisive. Nevertheless, at his final audience with King Edward on 7 December, Baldwin offered to strive all night with the King's conscience, but he found Edward to be determined to go. Baldwin announced the King's abdication in the Commons on 10 December. Harold Nicolson, an MP who witnessed Baldwin's speech, wrote in his diary:\nThere is no moment when he overstates emotion or indulges in oratory. There is intense silence broken only by the reporters in the gallery scuttling away to telephone the speech... When it was over... [we] file out broken in body and soul, conscious that we have heard the best speech that we shall ever hear in our lives. There was no question of applause. It was the silence of Gettysburg...No man has ever dominated the House as he dominated it tonight, and he knows it.\nAfter the speech, the House adjourned and Nicolson bumped into Baldwin as he was leaving, who asked him what he thought of the speech. Nicolson said it was superb to which Baldwin replied: \"Yes\u00a0... it was a success. I know it. It was almost wholly unprepared. I had a success, my dear Nicolson, at the moment I most needed it. Now is the time to go\".\nThe King abdicated on 11 December and was succeeded by his brother, George VI. Edward VIII was assigned the title of the Duke of Windsor by his brother and then married Mrs. Simpson in France in June 1937 after her divorce from Ernest Simpson had become final.\nBaldwin had defused a political crisis by turning it into a constitutional question. His discreet resolution met with general approval and restored his popularity. He was praised on all sides for his tact and patience and was not in the least put out by the protestors' cries of \"God save the King\u2014from Baldwin!\" \"Flog Baldwin! Flog him!! We\u2014want\u2014Edward.\"\nJohn Charmley argued in his history of the Conservative Party that Baldwin was pushing for more democracy and less of an old aristocratic upper-class tone. Monarchy was to be a national foundation by which the head of the Church, the State, and the Empire would draw upon 1000 years of tradition and could unify the nation. George V was an ideal fit: \"an ordinary little man with the philistine tastes of most of his subjects, he could be presented as the archetypical English paterfamilias getting on with his duties without fuss.\" Charmley finds that George V and Baldwin, \"made a formidable conservative team, with their ordinary, honest, English decency proving the first (and most effective) bulwark against revolution\". Edward VIII, flaunting his upper-class playboy style, suffered from an unstable neurotic character and needed a strong stabilising partner, a role that Mrs. Simpson was unable to provide. Baldwin's final achievement was to smooth the way for Edward to abdicate in favour of his younger brother, who became George VI. Both father and son demonstrated the value of a democratic king during the severe physical and psychological hardships of the world wars, and the tradition was carried on by Elizabeth II.\nRetirement.\nLeaving office and peerage.\nFollowing the coronation of George VI, Baldwin announced on 27 May 1937 that he would resign the premiership the next day. His last act as prime minister was to raise the salaries of MPs from \u00a3400 a year to \u00a3600 and to give the leader of the Opposition a salary. That was the first rise in MPs' wages since their introduction in 1911, and it particularly benefited Labour MPs. Harold Nicolson wrote in his diary that it \"was done with Baldwin's usual consummate taste. No man has ever left in such a blaze of affection\". Baldwin was appointed a Knight Companion of the Garter (KG) on 28 May and ennobled as Earl Baldwin of Bewdley and Viscount Corvedale, \"of Corvedale in the County of Salop\" on 8 June. In a BBC radio broadcast transmitted on 8 December 1938, Baldwin made a nationwide appeal for funds to help Jewish and other refugees fleeing persecution in Nazi Germany. For this, Baldwin was dubbed a \"guttersnipe\" by a Berlin newspaper. The \"Lord Baldwin Fund for Refugees\", helping the kindertransport and other relief schemes, raised over \u00a3500,000, equivalent to \u00a336,000,000 in 2022.\nAttitude to appeasement.\nBaldwin supported the Munich Agreement and said to Chamberlain on 26 September 1938: \"If you can secure peace, you may be cursed by a lot of hotheads but my word you will be blessed in Europe and by future generations\". Baldwin made a rare speech in the House of Lords on 4 October and said that he could not have gone to Munich but praised Chamberlain's courage. He also said the responsibility of a prime minister was not to commit a country to war until he was sure that it was ready to fight. If there was a 95% chance of war in the future, he would still choose peace. He also said he would put industry on a war footing the next day, as the opposition to such a move had disappeared. Churchill said in a speech: \"He says he would mobilise tomorrow. I think it would have been much better if Earl Baldwin had said that two and a half years ago when everyone demanded a Ministry of Supply\".\nTwo weeks after Munich, Baldwin said prophetically in a conversation with Lord Hinchingbrooke: \"Can't we turn Hitler East? Napoleon broke himself against the Russians. Hitler might do the same\".\nBaldwin's years in retirement were quiet. After Chamberlain's death in 1940, Baldwin's perceived part in prewar appeasement made him an unpopular figure during and after World War II. With a succession of British military failures in 1940, Baldwin started to receive critical letters: \"insidious to begin with, then increasingly violent and abusive; then the newspapers; finally the polemicists who, with time and wit at their disposal, could debate at leisure how to wound the deepest\". He did not have a secretary and so was not shielded from the often-unpleasant letters that were sent to him. After a bitterly critical letter was sent to him by a member of the public, Baldwin wrote: \"I can understand his bitterness. He wants a scapegoat and the men provided him with one\". His biographers Middlemas and Barnes claim that \"the men\" almost certainly meant the authors of \"Guilty Men\".\nLetter to Lord Halifax.\nAfter Lord Halifax made a speech on the strength of prayer as the instrument that could be invoked by the humblest to use in their country's service, Baldwin wrote to him on 23 July 1940:\nWith millions of others I had prayed hard at the time of Dunkirk and never did prayer seem to be more speedily answered to the full. And we prayed for France and the next day she surrendered. I thought much, and when I went to bed I lay for a long time vividly awake. And I went over in my mind what had happened, concentrating on the thoughts that you had dwelt on, that prayer to be effective must be in accordance with God's will, and that by far the hardest thing to say from the heart and indeed the last lesson we learn (if we ever do) is to say and mean it, 'Thy will be done.' And I thought what mites we all are and how we can never see God's plan, a plan on such a scale that it \"must\" be incomprehensible. And suddenly for what must have been a couple of minutes I seemed to see with extraordinary and vivid clarity and to hear someone speaking to me. The words at the time were clear, but the recollection of them had passed when I seemed to come to, as it were, but the sense remained, and the sense was this. 'You cannot see the plan'; then 'Have you not thought there is a purpose in stripping you one by one of all the human props on which you depend, that you are being left alone in the world? You have now one upon whom to lean and I have chosen you as my instrument to work with my will. Why then are you afraid?' And to prove ourselves worthy of that tremendous task is our job.\nIron gates criticism.\nIn September 1941, Baldwin's old enemy, Lord Beaverbrook, asked all local authorities to survey their area's iron and steel railings and gates that could be used for the war effort. Owners of such materials could appeal for an exemption on grounds of artistic or historic merit, which would be decided by a panel set up by local authorities. Baldwin applied for exemption for the iron gates of his country home on artistic grounds and his local council sent an architect to assess them. In December, the architect advised for them to be exempt, but in February 1942, the Ministry of Supply overruled that and said all his gates must go except the ones at the main entrance. A newspaper campaign hounded him for not donating the gates to war production. The \"Daily Mirror\" columnist \"Cassandra\" denounced Baldwin:\nHere was the country in deadly peril with half the Empire swinging in the wind like a busted barn door hanging on one hinge. Here was Old England half smothered in a shroud crying for steel to cut her way out, and right in the heart of beautiful Worcestershire was a one-time Prime Minister, refusing to give up the gates of his estate to make guns for our defence \u2013 and his. Here was an old stupid politician who had tricked the nation into complacency about rearmament for fear of losing an election... Here is the very shrine of stupidity... This National Park of Failure...\nThere were fears that if the gates were not taken by the proper authorities, \"others without authority might\". Thus, months before any other collections were made, Baldwin's gates were removed except for those at the main entrance. Two of Beaverbrook's friends after the war claimed that it was Beaverbrook's decision despite Churchill saying, \"Lay off Baldwin's gates\". At Question Time in the House of Commons, Conservative MP Captain Alan Graham said: \"Is the honourable Member aware that it is very necessary to leave Lord Baldwin his gates in order to protect him from the just indignation of the mob?\"\nComments on politics.\nDuring the war, Churchill consulted him only once, in February 1943, on the advisability of his speaking out strongly against the continued neutrality of \u00c9amon de Valera's Ireland. Baldwin saw the draft of Churchill's speech and advised against it, which Churchill followed. A few months after this visit to Churchill, Baldwin told Harold Nicolson, \"I went into Downing Street... a happy man. Of course it was partly because an old buffer like me enjoys feeling that he is still not quite out of things. But it was also pure patriotic joy that my country at such a time should have found such a leader. The furnace of the war has smeltered out all base metals from him\". To D. H. Barber, Baldwin wrote of Churchill: \"You can take it from me he is a really big man, the War has brought out the best that was in him. His head isn't turned the least little bit by the great position he occupies in the eyes of the world. I pray he is spared to see us through\".\nIn private, Baldwin defended his conduct in the 1930s:\nthe critics have no historical sense. I have no Cabinet papers by me and do not want to trust my memory. But recall the Fulham election, the peace ballot, Singapore, sanctions, Malta. The English will only learn by example. When I first heard of Hitler, when Ribbentrop came to see me, I thought they were all crazy. I think I brought Ramsay and Simon to meet Ribbentrop. Remember that Ramsay's health was breaking up in the last two years. He had lost his nerve in the House in the last year. I had to take all the important speeches. The moment he went, I prepared for a general election and got a bigger majority for rearmament. No power on earth could have got rearmament without a general election except by a big split. Simon was inefficient. I had to lead the House, keep the machine together with those Labour fellows.\nIn December 1944, strongly advised by friends, Baldwin decided to respond to criticisms of him through a biographer. He asked G. M. Young, who accepted, and asked Churchill to grant permission to Young to see Cabinet papers. Baldwin wrote:\nI am the last person to complain of fair criticism, but when one book after another appears and I am compared, for example, to Laval, my gorge rises; but I am crippled and cannot go and examine the files of the Cabinet Office. Could G. M. Young go on my behalf?\nLast years and death.\nIn June 1945, Baldwin's wife, Lucy, died. Baldwin himself now suffered from arthritis and needed a cane to walk. When he made his final public appearance in London in October 1947 at the unveiling of a statue of George V, a crowd of people recognised and cheered him, but he had become deaf and so asked: \"Are they booing me?\" Having been made Chancellor of the University of Cambridge in 1930, he continued in that capacity until his death in his sleep at Astley Hall, near Stourport-on-Severn, Worcestershire, on 14 December 1947. He was cremated in Birmingham, and his ashes were buried in Worcester Cathedral. No cause of death was revealed.\nA memorial service was held at Wilden Church, near Stourport, Worcestershire.\nBaldwin was a member of the Oddfellows and Foresters Friendly Society.\nLegacy.\nUpon his retirement in 1937, he had received a great deal of praise, but the onset of World War II would change his public image for the worse. Baldwin, Chamberlain and MacDonald were held responsible for Great Britain's military unpreparedness on the eve of war in 1939. Peter Howard, writing in the \"Sunday Express\" (3 September 1939), accused Baldwin of deceiving the country of the dangers that faced it in order not to rearm and so win the 1935 general election. During the ill-fated Battle of France in May 1940, Lloyd George in conversation with Churchill and General Ironside railed against Baldwin and said that \"he ought to be hanged\".\nIn July 1940, a bestseller \"Guilty Men\" appeared, which blamed Baldwin for failing to rearm enough. In May 1941, Hamilton Fyfe wrote an article (\"Leadership and Democracy\") for \"Nineteenth Century and After\", which also laid those charges against Baldwin. In 1941, A. L. Rowse criticised Baldwin for lulling the people into a false sense of security and as a practitioner in \"the art of taking the people in\":\nwhat can this man think in the still watches of the night, when he contemplates the ordeal his country is going through as the result of the years, the locust years, in which he held power?\nChurchill firmly believed that Baldwin's conciliatory stance toward Hitler gave the impression that in the case of an attack by the German dictator, Britain would not fight. Churchill was known for his magnanimity toward political rivals such as Chamberlain but had none to spare for Baldwin. \"I wish Stanley Baldwin no ill,\" Churchill said in declining to send him 80th birthday greetings in 1947, \"but it would have been much better had he never lived.\" Churchill also believed that Baldwin, rather than Chamberlain, would be most blamed by subsequent generations for the policies that led to \"the most unnecessary war in history\". An index entry in the first volume of Churchill's \"History of the Second World War\" (\"The Gathering Storm\") records Baldwin \"admitting to putting party before country\" for his alleged admission that he would not have won the 1935 election if he had pursued a more aggressive policy of rearmament. Churchill selectively quoted a speech in the Commons by Baldwin that gave the false impression that Baldwin was speaking of the general election, instead of the Fulham by-election in 1933, and omitted Baldwin's actual comments about the 1935 election: \"We got from the country, a mandate for doing a thing [a substantial rearmament programme] that no one, twelve months before, would have believed possible\". In his speech on Baldwin's death, Churchill paid him a double-edged yet respectful tribute: \"He was the most formidable politician I ever encountered in public life\".\nIn 1948, Reginald Bassett published an essay disputing the claim that Baldwin \"confessed\" to putting party before country and claimed that Baldwin was referring to 1933 and 1934 when a general election on rearmament would have been lost.\nIn 1952, G. M. Young published an authorised biography of Baldwin that asserted that Baldwin united the nation and helped moderate the policies of the Labour Party. However, Young accepted the chief criticisms of Baldwin that he failed to rearm early enough and that he put party before country. Young contends that Baldwin should have retired in 1935. Churchill and Beaverbrook deemed several passages in the biography to be defamatory of their own actions and threatened to sue if they were not removed or altered. A settlement was reached to remove the offending sentences, and the publisher Rupert Hart-Davis had the \"hideously expensive\" job of removing and replacing seven leaves from 7,580 copies.\nIn response to Young's biography, D. C. Somervell published \"Stanley Baldwin: An examination of some features of Mr. G. M. Young's biography\" in 1953 with a foreword by Ernest Brown. This attempted to defend Baldwin against the charges made by Young. Both Young and Somervell were criticised by C. L. Mowat in 1955, who claimed that they both failed to rehabilitate Baldwin's reputation.\nIn 1956, Baldwin's son A. W. Baldwin published a biography entitled \"My Father: The True Story\". It has been written that his son \"evidently could not decide whether he was answering the charge of inanition and deceit which grew out of the war, or the radical 'dissenters' of the early 1930s who thought the Conservatives were warmongers and denounced them for rearming at all\".\nIn an article written to commemorate the centenary of Baldwin's birth, in \"The Spectator\" (\"Don't Let's Be Beastly to Baldwin\", 14 July 1967), Rab Butler defended Baldwin's moderate policies and claimed that it helped heal social divisions. In 1969 the first major biography of Baldwin appeared, of over 1,000 pages, written by Keith Middlemas and John Barnes, both Conservatives who wished to defend Baldwin.\nIn 1998, historian Andrew Thorpe wrote that apart from the questions of war and peace, Baldwin had a mixed reputation. He was moved by social deprivation but not to the point of legislation and systematically avoided intervention in the economy and social system. He had a ruthless style that included insincerity. His advisors were second rank figures like Davidson and Bridgeman. Thorpe wrote, \"Essentially, Baldwin was a much more neurotic and insecure character than his public persona would have suggested\", as shown by his nervous breakdown in 1936 that kept him out of action for three months. On the other hand, Thorpe says that Baldwin was a good co-ordinator of his coalition who did not block colleagues who proposed various small reforms.\nThorpe argued that Baldwin's handling of the 1926 general strike was \"firm and uncompromising\" but disliked the harsh Trade Disputes Act that followed because it was too far to the right of Baldwin's preferred moderation. Thorpe praised Baldwin's handling of the Abdication Crisis in 1936, which allowed Baldwin to leave office in a blaze of glory. Thorpe said that Baldwin often lacked drive and was too easily depressed, too pessimistic and too neglectful of foreign affairs. On the other hand, he achieved his primary goals of preserving capitalism, maintaining the parliamentary system and strengthening the Conservative Party as a leading opponent of socialism.\nIn 1999, Philip Williamson published a collection of essays on Baldwin that attempted to explain his beliefs and defended his policies as prime minister. Baldwin's defenders argued that with pacifist appeasement the dominant political view in Britain, France and the United States, he felt he could not start a programme of rearmament without a national consensus on the matter. Williamson argued that Baldwin had helped create \"a moral basis for rearmament in the mid 1930s\" that contributed greatly to \"the national spirit of defiance after Munich\".\nWilliamson admitted that there was a clear postwar consensus that repudiated and denigrated all interwar governments: Baldwin was targeted with the accusation that he had failed to rearm Britain in the 1930s, despite Hitler's threat. Williamson said that the negative reputation was chiefly the product of partisan politics, the bandwagon of praise for Churchill, selective recollections, and the need for scapegoats to blame for Britain's very close call in 1940. Only during the 1960s would political distance and then the opening of government records lead to more balanced historical assessments, but the myth had become so central to larger myths about the 1930s and 1940s that it persists as conventional wisdom about the period.\nBy 2004, Ball could report, \"The pendulum has swung almost completely towards a positive view.\" Ball noted, \"Baldwin is now seen as having done more than most and perhaps as much as was possible in the context, but the fact remains that it was not enough to deter the aggressors or ensure their defeat.

Lee, who called him his \"Old War Horse\". He served under Lee as a corps commander for most of the battles fought by the Army of Northern Virginia in the Eastern Theater, and briefly with Braxton Bragg in the Army of Tennessee in the Western Theater.\nAfter graduating from the United States Military Academy at West Point, Longstreet served in the United States Army during the Mexican\u2013American War. He was wounded at the Battle of Chapultepec, and during recovery married his first wife, Louise Garland. Throughout the 1850s, he served on frontier duty in the American Southwest. In June 1861, Longstreet resigned his U.S. Army commission and joined the Confederate Army. He commanded Confederate troops during an early victory at Blackburn's Ford in July and played a minor role at the First Battle of Bull Run.\nLongstreet made significant contributions to most major Confederate victories, primarily in the Eastern Theater as one of Robert E. Lee's chief subordinates in the Army of Northern Virginia. He performed poorly at Seven Pines by accidentally marching his men down the wrong road, causing them to arrive late, but played an important role in the Confederate success of the Seven Days Battles in the summer of 1862, where he helped supervise repeated attacks that drove the Union army away from the Confederate capital of Richmond. Longstreet led a devastating counterattack that routed the Union army at Second Bull Run in August. His men held their ground in defensive roles at Antietam and Fredericksburg. He did not participate in the Confederate victory at Chancellorsville, as he and most of his soldiers had been detached on the comparatively minor Siege of Suffolk. Longstreet's most controversial service was at the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863, where he openly disagreed with Lee on the tactics to be employed and reluctantly supervised several unsuccessful attacks on Union forces. Afterward, Longstreet was, at his own request, sent to the Western Theater to fight under Braxton Bragg, where his troops launched a ferocious assault on the Union lines at Chickamauga that carried the day. Afterward, his performance in semi-autonomous command during the Knoxville campaign resulted in a Confederate defeat. Longstreet's tenure in the Western Theater was marred by his central role in numerous conflicts amongst Confederate generals. Unhappy serving under Bragg, Longstreet and his men were sent back to Lee. He ably commanded troops during the Battle of the Wilderness in 1864, where he was seriously wounded by friendly fire. He later returned to the field, serving under Lee in the Siege of Petersburg and the Appomattox campaign.\nLongstreet enjoyed a successful post-war career working for the U.S. government as a diplomat, civil servant, and administrator. His support for the Republican Party and his cooperation with his pre-war friend President Ulysses S. Grant, as well as critical comments he wrote about Lee's wartime performance, made him anathema to many of his former Confederate colleagues. His reputation in the South further suffered when he led African-American militia against the anti-Reconstruction White League at the Battle of Liberty Place in 1874. Authors of the Lost Cause movement focused on Longstreet's actions at Gettysburg as a principal reason for why the South lost the Civil War. As an elderly man, he married Helen Dortch Longstreet, who worked to restore her husband's image after his death. Since the late 20th century, Longstreet's reputation has undergone a slow reassessment. Many Civil War historians now consider him among the war's most gifted tactical commanders.\nEarly life.\nChildhood.\nJames Longstreet was born on January 8, 1821, in Edgefield District, South Carolina, now part of North Augusta, Edgefield County. He was the fifth child and third son of James Longstreet, of Dutch descent, and Mary Ann Dent of English descent, originally from New Jersey and Maryland respectively, who owned a cotton plantation close to where the village of Gainesville would be founded in northeastern Georgia. James's ancestor Dirck Stoffels Langestraet immigrated to the Dutch colony of New Netherland in 1657, but the name was Anglicized over the generations. The family was moderately prosperous and held dozens of slaves. James's father was impressed by his son's \"rocklike\" character, giving him the nickname Peter, and he was known as Pete or Old Pete for the rest of his life. Longstreet's father decided on a military career for his son but felt that the available local education would not be adequate preparation. At age nine, James was sent to live with his aunt Frances Eliza and uncle Augustus Baldwin Longstreet in Augusta, Georgia. James spent eight years on his uncle's plantation, Westover, just outside the city while he attended the Academy of Richmond County. His father died from a cholera epidemic while visiting Augusta in 1833. Although James's mother and the rest of the family moved to Somerville, Alabama, following his father's death, James remained with his uncle.\nAs a boy, Longstreet enjoyed swimming, hunting, fishing, and riding horses. He became adept at shooting firearms. Northern Georgia was very rural frontier territory, and Southern aristocratic traditions had not yet taken hold. As a result, Longstreet's manners were sometimes rather rough in spite of his plantation background. He dressed unceremoniously and at times used coarse language, although not in the presence of women. In later life, Longstreet described his aunt and uncle as caring and loving. He made no known political statements before the war and appears to have been largely uninterested in politics. But Augustus, as a lawyer, judge, newspaper editor, and Methodist minister, was a fierce states' rights partisan who supported South Carolina during the Nullification crisis (1828\u20131833), ideas to which Longstreet probably would have been exposed. Augustus was also known for drinking whiskey and playing cards at a time when many Americans considered them immoral, habits he passed on to Longstreet.\nWest Point and early military service.\nIn 1837, Augustus attempted to obtain an appointment for his nephew to the United States Military Academy, but the vacancy for his congressional district had already been filled. Longstreet was appointed the following year by a relative, Reuben Chapman, who represented the First District of Alabama, where Mary Longstreet lived. Longstreet was a poor student. By his own admission in his memoirs, he \"had more interest in the school of the soldier, horsemanship, exercise, and the outside game of foot-ball than in the academic courses\".\nLongstreet ranked in the bottom third of every subject during his four years at the academy. In January of his third year, Longstreet initially failed his mechanics exam, but took a second test two days later and passed. Longstreet's engineering instructor in his fourth year was Dennis Hart Mahan, who stressed swift maneuvering, protection of interior lines, and positioning troops in strategic points rather than attempting to destroy the enemy's army outright. Although Longstreet earned modest grades in the course, he used similar tactics during the Civil War. Longstreet was also a disciplinary problem at West Point. He earned a large number of demerits, especially in his final two years. His offenses included visiting after taps, absence at roll call, an untidy room, long hair, causing a disturbance during study time, and disobeying orders. Biographer Jeffry D. Wert says, \"Longstreet was neither a model student nor a gentleman.\"\nLongstreet was popular with his classmates, however, and befriended a number of men who would become prominent during the Civil War, including George Henry Thomas, William Rosecrans (his roommate), John Pope, Daniel Harvey Hill, Lafayette McLaws, George Pickett, and Ulysses S. Grant. Longstreet ranked 54th out of 56 cadets when he graduated in 1842. He was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant in the United States Army.\nAfter a brief furlough, Longstreet was stationed for two years at the 4th U.S. Infantry at Jefferson Barracks, Missouri, under the command of Lieutenant colonel John Garland. In 1843, he was joined by his friend, Lieutenant Ulysses Grant. In 1844, Longstreet met Garland's daughter and his future first wife Maria Louisa Garland, called Louise by her family. At about the same time as Longstreet began courting Louise, Grant courted Longstreet's fourth cousin, Julia Dent, and that couple eventually married. Longstreet attended the Grant wedding on August 22, 1848, in St. Louis, but his role at the ceremony remains unclear. Grant biographers Jean Edward Smith and Ron Chernow state that Longstreet served as best man. John Y. Simon, editor of Julia Grant's memoirs, concluded that Longstreet \"may have been a groomsman\", and Longstreet biographer Donald Brigman Sanger called the role of best man \"uncertain\" while noting that neither Grant nor Longstreet mentioned such a role in their memoirs.\nLater in 1844, the regiment, along with the Third Infantry, was transferred to Camp Salubrity near Natchitoches, Louisiana, as part of the Army of Observation under Major General Zachary Taylor. On March 8, 1845, Longstreet was promoted to second lieutenant and transferred to the Eighth Infantry, stationed at Fort Marion in St. Augustine, Florida. He served for the month of August on court-martial duty in Pensacola. The regiment was then transferred to Corpus Christi, Texas, where he was reunited with the officers of the Third and Fourth Regiments, including Grant. The men passed the winter by staging plays.\nMexican\u2013American War.\nLongstreet served with distinction in the Mexican\u2013American War with the 8th U.S. Infantry. He fought under Zachary Taylor as a lieutenant in May 1846 in the battles of Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma. He recounted both of these battles in his memoirs but wrote nothing about his personal role in them. On June 10, Longstreet was given command of Company A of the Eighth Infantry of William J. Worth's Second Division. He fought again with Taylor's army at the Battle of Monterrey in September 1846, during which about 200 Mexican lancers drove back a group of American troops. Longstreet, commanding companies A and B, led a counterattack, killing or wounding almost half of the lancers.\nOn February 23, 1847, he was promoted to the rank of first lieutenant. General-in-Chief Winfield Scott ordered Worth's division out of Taylor's army and under his direct command to participate in an assault on the Mexican capital of Mexico City. Worth's division was sent first to Lobos Island, then sailed 180 miles (289.7\u00a0km) south to Veracruz. Worth led Scott's army in its amphibious approach on the city, arriving there on March 9. Scott besieged the city and subjected it to regular bombardments. It surrendered on March 29. The American army then marched north towards the capital. In August, Longstreet served in the Battle of Churubusco, a pivotal battle as the U.S. Army moved closer to capturing Mexico City. The Eighth Infantry was the only force in Worth's division to reach the Mexican earthworks. Longstreet carried the regimental banner under heavy Mexican fire. The troops found themselves stuck in a ditch and could only scale the Mexican defenses by standing on each other. In the fierce hand-to-hand combat that ensued, the Americans prevailed. Longstreet received a brevet promotion to captain for his actions.\nHe received a brevet promotion to major for Molino del Rey. In the Battle of Chapultepec on September 12, he was wounded in the thigh while charging up the hill with his regimental colors; falling, he handed the flag to his friend Lt. Pickett, who was able to reach the summit. The capture of the Chapultepec fortress led to the fall of Mexico City. Longstreet recovered in the home of the Escand\u00f3n family, which treated wounded American soldiers. His wound was slow to heal and he did not leave until December. After a brief visit with his family, Longstreet went to Missouri to see Louise.\nSubsequent activities.\nAfter the war and his recovery, Longstreet and Louise Garland were officially married on March 8, 1848. The marriage produced 10 children. Little is known of their courtship or marriage. Longstreet rarely mentions her in his memoirs, and never reveals any personal details. There are no surviving letters between the two. Most anecdotes about their relationship come through the writings of Longstreet's second wife, Helen Dortch Longstreet. Novelist Ben Ames Williams, a descendant of Longstreet, included Longstreet as a minor character in two novels. Williams questioned Longstreet's surviving children and grandchildren, and depicted him as a devoted family man with an exceptionally happy marriage.\nLongstreet next served several months of recruiting duty in Poughkeepsie, New York. After travelling to St. Louis for the Grant wedding, Longstreet and his wife moved to Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania. On January 1, 1850, he was appointed Chief Commissary for the Department of Texas, responsible for the acquisition and distribution of food to the department's soldiers and animals. The job was complex and consisted mainly of paperwork, although it provided experience in administrative military work. 1850 census records show that Longstreet owned two slaves, a 35-year old woman and a 13-year old girl. In June, Longstreet, hoping for promotion and an income above his $40-per-month salary to support his growing family, requested a transfer to the cavalry but was rejected. He resigned as commissary in March 1851 and returned to the Eighth Infantry. Longstreet served on frontier duty in Texas at Fort Martin Scott near Fredericksburg. The primary purpose of the military in Texas was to protect frontier communities against Indians, and Longstreet frequently participated in scouting missions against the Comanche. His family remained in San Antonio, and he saw them regularly. In 1854, he was transferred to Fort Bliss in El Paso, and Louise and the children moved in with him. In 1855, Longstreet was involved in fighting against the Mescalero. He assumed command of the garrison at Fort Bliss on two occasions between the spring of 1856 and the spring of 1858. The small size of the garrison allowed for easy socialization with the local people, and the fort's location allowed for visits with Louise's parents in Santa Fe. Longstreet performed scouting missions.\nOn March 29, 1858, Longstreet wrote to the adjutant general's office in Washington, D.C. requesting that he be assigned to recruiting duty in the East, which would allow him to better educate his children. He was granted a six-month leave, but the request for assignment in the East was denied, and he was instead directed to serve as major and paymaster for the 8th Infantry in Leavenworth, Kansas. He left his son Garland in a school at Yonkers, New York, before journeying to Kansas. On the way, Longstreet came across his old friend Grant in St. Louis, Missouri. After about a year in Leavenworth, he was transferred to Colonel Garland's department in Albuquerque, New Mexico, to serve as paymaster, where he was joined by Louise and their children.\nKnowledge of Longstreet's prewar life is extremely limited. His experience resembles that of many Civil War generals insofar as he went to West Point, served with distinction in the War with Mexico, and continued his career in the peacetime army of the 1850s. But beyond that, there are few details. He left no diary, and his lengthy memoirs focus almost entirely on recounting and defending his Civil War military record. They reveal little of his personal side while providing only a very cursory view of his pre-war activities. An 1889 fire destroyed his personal papers, making it so that the number of \"[e]xisting antebellum private letters written by Longstreet [could] be counted on one hand\".\nAmerican Civil War.\nJoining the Confederacy and initial hostilities.\nAt the beginning of the American Civil War, Longstreet was paymaster for the United States Army and stationed in Albuquerque. After news of the Battle of Fort Sumter, he joined his fellow Southerners in leaving the post. In his memoirs, Longstreet calls it a \"sad day\", and records that a number of Northern officers attempted to persuade him not to go. He writes that he asked one of them \"what course he would pursue if his State should pass ordinances of secession and call him to its defence. He confessed that he would obey the call.\"\nLongstreet was not enthusiastic about secession from the Union, but he had long been infused with the concept of states' rights and felt he could not go against his homeland. Although he was born in South Carolina and brought up in Georgia, he offered his services to Alabama, which had appointed him to West Point and where his mother still lived. He was the senior West Point graduate from that state, which meant that he could potentially be placed in command of that state's soldiers. After settling his accounts, he submitted his resignation letter from the United States Army on May 9, 1861, intending to join the Confederacy. He had already accepted a commission as a lieutenant colonel in the Confederate States Army on May 1. His resignation from the United States Army was accepted on June 1.\nLongstreet arrived in Richmond, Virginia, with his new commission. He met with Confederate President Jefferson Davis at the executive mansion on June 22, 1861, where he was informed that he had been appointed a brigadier general with the date of rank on June 17, a commission he accepted on June 25. He was ordered to report to Brigadier General P. G. T. Beauregard at Manassas, where he was given command of a brigade of three Virginia regiments\u2014the 1st, 11th, and 17th Virginia Infantry\u2014in the Confederate Army of the Potomac.\nLongstreet assembled his staff and trained his brigade incessantly. On July 16, Union Brigadier General Irvin McDowell began marching his army toward Manassas Junction. Longstreet's brigade first saw action at Blackburn's Ford on July 18, when it collided with McDowell's advance division under Brigadier General Daniel Tyler, clashing heavily with the brigade of Israel B. Richardson. An infantry charge pushed Longstreet's men back, and in his own words, Longstreet \"rode with sabre in hand for the leading files, determined to give them all that was in the sword and my horse's heels, or stop the break\". Colonel Jubal Early's brigade arrived to reinforce Longstreet. One of Early's regiments, the 7th Virginia, fired a volley while Longstreet was still in front of its position, forcing him to dive off of his horse. Under the renewed Confederate strength, the Union left wavered. Tyler withdrew, as he had orders not to bring on a general engagement.\nThe battle preceded the First Battle of Bull Run (First Manassas). When the main attack came at the opposite end of the line on July 21, Longstreet's brigade endured artillery fire for nine hours but played a minor role in the fighting. Between 5 and 6 in the evening, Longstreet received an order from Brigadier General Joseph E. Johnston instructing him to take part in the pursuit of the Federal troops, who had been defeated and were fleeing the battlefield. He obeyed, but when he met Brigadier General Milledge Bonham's brigade, Bonham, who outranked Longstreet, ordered him to retreat. The same order soon arrived from Johnston. Longstreet was infuriated that his commanders would not allow a vigorous pursuit of the defeated Union Army. His Chief of Staff, Moxley Sorrel, recorded that he was \"in a fine rage. He dashed his hat furiously to the ground, stamped, and bitter words escaped him.\" He quoted Longstreet as saying afterward, \"Retreat! Hell, the Federal army has broken to pieces.\"\nOn October 7, Longstreet was promoted to major general and assumed command of a division in the newly reorganized and renamed Confederate Army of Northern Virginia under Johnston (formed from the previous Army of the Potomac and the Army of the Shenandoah) \u2013 with four infantry brigades commanded by Generals D.H. Hill, David R. Jones, Bonham, and Louis Wigfall, as well as Hampton's Legion commanded by Wade Hampton III.\nFamily tragedy.\nOn January 10, 1862, Longstreet traveled under orders from Johnston to Richmond, where he discussed with Davis the creation of a conscription program. He spent much of the intervening time with Louise and their children, and was back at army headquarters in Centreville by January 20. A day or two later, he received a telegram informing him that all four of his children were extremely sick in an outbreak of scarlet fever. Longstreet immediately returned to the city.\nLongstreet arrived in Richmond before the death of his one-year-old daughter Mary Anne on January 25. Four-year-old James died the following day. Eleven-year-old Augustus Baldwin (\"Gus\") died on February 1. His 13-year-old son Garland remained ill but appeared to be out of mortal danger. George Pickett and his future wife LaSalle Corbell were in the Longstreets' company throughout the affair. They arranged the funeral and burials, which for unknown reasons neither Longstreet nor his wife attended. Longstreet returned to the army on February 5. He rushed back to Richmond later in the month when Garland took a turn for the worse, but came back after he recovered. The losses were devastating for Longstreet and he became withdrawn, both personally and socially. In 1861, his headquarters were noted for parties, drinking, and poker games. After he returned, the headquarters social life became for a time more somber. He rarely drank, and his religious devotion increased.\nPeninsula.\nThat spring, Union Major General George B. McClellan, commander of the Army of the Potomac, launched the Peninsula campaign intending to capture the Confederate capital of Richmond. In his memoirs, Longstreet wrote that while in temporary command of the Confederate army, he proposed to Thomas J. \"Stonewall\" Jackson that he march to Jackson in the Shenandoah Valley and combine forces. No evidence has emerged for this claim.\nFollowing the delay of the Union offensive against Richmond at the Siege of Yorktown, Johnston oversaw a tactical withdrawal to the outskirts of Richmond, where defenses had already been prepared. Longstreet's division formed the rearguard, which was heavily engaged at the Battle of Williamsburg on May 5. There, Union troops beginning with Joseph Hooker's division of the Union III Corps, which was commanded by Samuel P. Heintzelman, came out of a forest into open ground to attack Longstreet's men. To protect the army's supply wagons, Longstreet counterattacked with the brigades of Cadmus M. Wilcox, A. P. Hill, Pickett, Raleigh E. Colston, and two other regiments. The assault drove the Union soldiers back. Finding the ground he occupied untenable, Longstreet requested reinforcements from D.H. Hill's division a little further up the road and received Early's brigade, to which was later added the entire division. Early then launched a fruitless and bloody attack well after the wagons had already been safely evacuated. Overall, the battle was a success, protecting the passage of Confederate supply wagons and delaying the advance of McClellan's army toward Richmond. The affair gave the Confederates possession of four cannon. McClellan inaccurately characterized the battle as a Union victory in a dispatch to Washington.\nOn May 31, during the Battle of Seven Pines, Longstreet received his orders verbally from Johnston but apparently misremembered them. He marched his men in the wrong direction down the wrong road, causing congestion and confusion with other Confederate units, diluting the effect of the Confederate counterattack against McClellan. He then got into an argument with Major General Benjamin Huger over who had seniority, causing a significant delay. When D.H. Hill subsequently asked Longstreet for reinforcements, he complied, but failed to properly coordinate his brigades. Only one of Longstreet's brigades and none of Huger's reached the field. Late in the day, Major General Edwin Vose Sumner crossed the rain-swollen Chickahominy River with two divisions. General Johnston was wounded during the battle. Although Johnston preferred Longstreet as his replacement, command of the Army of Northern Virginia shifted to G. W. Smith, the senior major general, for a single day. On June 1, Richardson's division of Sumner's corps engaged Longstreet's men, routing Lewis Armistead's brigade, but the brigades of Pickett, William Mahone, and Roger Atkinson Pryor positioned in the woods managed to hold it back. After six hours of fighting, the battle ended in a draw. Johnston praised Longstreet's performance in the battle. Biographer William Garrett Piston calls it \"the lowest point in Longstreet's military career\". Longstreet's report unfairly blamed Huger for the mishaps. On June 1, the President's military advisor Robert E. Lee assumed command of the Army of Northern Virginia. In his memoirs, Longstreet suggested that he initially doubted Lee's capacity for command. He wrote that his arrival \"was far from reconciling the troops to the loss of our beloved chief, Joseph E. Johnston\". He wrote that Lee did not have much of a reputation at the time that he took command and that there were therefore \"misgivings\" about Lee's \"power and skill for field service\".\nIn late June, Lee organized a plan to drive McClellan's army away from the capital, which culminated in the Seven Days Battles. At daybreak on June 27 at Gaines's Mill, the Confederate Army attacked the V Corps of the Union Army under Brigadier General Fitz John Porter, which was positioned north of the Chickahominy River on McClellan's right flank. Federal troops held their lines for most of the day against attacks from the divisions of A.P. Hill and D.H. Hill, and Jackson did not arrive until the afternoon. At about 5 P.M., Longstreet received orders from Lee to join the battle. Longstreet's fresh brigades under Pickett and Richard H. Anderson, accompanied by the brigades of Brigadier General John Bell Hood and Colonel Evander M. Law from William H.C. Whiting's division, charged the Union lines, forcing them to retreat across the Chickahominy. Longstreet was engaged again on June 30 with about 20,000 men at Glendale. He departed from his usual strategy of placing troops several lines deep and instead spread them out, which in the opinion of some military historians cost him the battle. His efforts were further damaged by the slowness of other Confederate commanders, and McClellan was able to withdraw his army to the high plateau of Malvern Hill. Jackson, engaged at White Oak Swamp, ignored reports of ways in which to cross the swamp, and refused to answer an inquiry from Longstreet's staff officer John Fairfax. Huger's advance was slow enough to allow Federal troops to be transported away from guarding him and towards Longstreet, and Theophilus Holmes also performed poorly. Nearly 50,000 Confederate troops stood within a few miles of the field at Glendale and rendered little to no assistance. In a reconnaissance on the evening of June 30, Longstreet reported to Lee that conditions were favorable enough to justify assault. At the Battle of Malvern Hill the next day, Longstreet surrendered A.P. Hill's entire division to John B. Magruder, and marched his remaining troops toward the Union positions on the Confederate extreme right. His men were exposed to fire on their flanks from McClellan's troops and were forced to withdraw without success.\nThroughout the Seven Days Battles, Longstreet had operational command of nearly half of Lee's army\u201415 brigades\u2014as it drove McClellan back down the Peninsula. Longstreet performed aggressively and quite well in his new, larger command, particularly at Gaines's Mill and Glendale. Lee's army suffered from poor maps, organizational flaws, and weak performances by Longstreet's peers, including, uncharacteristically, Stonewall Jackson, and was unable to destroy the Union army. Moxley Sorrel wrote of Longstreet's confidence and calmness in battle: \"He was like a rock in steadiness when sometimes in battle the world seemed flying to pieces.\" General Lee said shortly after Seven Days, \"Longstreet was the staff in my right hand.\" He had been established as Lee's principal lieutenant. Lee reorganized the Army of Northern Virginia after Seven Days, increasing Longstreet's command from six brigades to 28. Longstreet took command of the Right Wing (later known as the First Corps) and Jackson was given command of the Left Wing. Over time, Lee and Longstreet became good friends and set up headquarters very near each other. Despite sharing with Jackson a belief in temperance as well as a deep religious conviction, Lee never developed as strong a friendship with him. Piston speculates that the more relaxed atmosphere of Longstreet's headquarters, which included gambling and drinking, allowed Lee to relax and take his mind off the war, and reminded him of his happier younger days.\nAfter the campaign, an editorial appeared in the \"Richmond Examiner\" inaccurately claiming that the Battle of Glendale \"was fought exclusively by General A.P. Hill and the forces under his command\". Longstreet drafted a letter refuting the article, which was published in the \"Richmond Whig.\" Hill took offense and requested that his division be transferred out of Longstreet's command. Longstreet agreed, but Lee took no action. Then, Hill refused to accede to Longstreet's repeated requests for information and was eventually arrested on Longstreet's orders. He challenged Longstreet to a duel. Longstreet accepted, but Lee intervened and transferred Hill's division into Jackson's command.\nSecond Bull Run.\nThe military reputations of Lee's corps commanders are often characterized as Stonewall Jackson representing the audacious, offensive component of Lee's army, with Longstreet more typically advocating and executing strong defensive strategies and tactics. Wert describes Jackson as the hammer and Longstreet as the anvil of the army. In the first part of the Northern Virginia campaign of August 1862, this stereotype held true, but in the climactic battle, it did not. In June, the Federal Government created the 50,000-strong Army of Virginia, and put Major General John Pope in command. Pope moved south in an attempt to attack Lee and threaten Richmond through an overland march. Lee left Longstreet near Richmond to guard the city and dispatched Jackson to hinder Pope's advance. Jackson won a major victory at the Battle of Cedar Mountain. After learning that McClellan, as ordered, had dispatched troops north to assist Pope, Lee ordered Longstreet north as well, leaving only three divisions under G.W. Smith to protect Richmond against McClellan's reduced force. Longstreet's men began their march on August 17, aided by Stuart's cavalry. On August 23, Longstreet engaged Pope's position in a minor artillery duel at the First Battle of Rappahannock Station. The Confederate Washington Artillery was heavily damaged and a Union shell landed feet away from Longstreet and Wilcox but failed to explode. Meanwhile, Stuart's cavalry rode around the Army of Virginia and captured hundreds of soldiers and horses as well as some of Pope's personal belongings.\nJackson executed a sweeping flanking maneuver that captured Pope's main supply depot. He placed his corps in the rear of Pope's army, but he then took up a defensive position and effectively invited Pope to assault him. On August 28 and 29, the start of the Second Battle of Bull Run (Second Manassas), Pope pounded Jackson as Longstreet and the remainder of the army marched from the west, through Thoroughfare Gap, to reach the battlefield. On the afternoon of the 28th, Longstreet engaged a 5,000-man federal division under James B. Ricketts at the Battle of Thoroughfare Gap. Ricketts had been ordered to delay Longstreet's march towards the main Confederate army, but he took up his position too late, allowing George T. Anderson's brigade to occupy the high ground. Lee and Longstreet watched the battle together and decided to flank the Union position. Hood's division and a brigade under Henry L. Benning advanced towards the gap from the north and the south, respectively, while Wilcox's division followed in a six-mile march northward. Ricketts realized his position was untenable and withdrew that evening, allowing Longstreet to join up with the rest of Lee's army. Postwar criticism of Longstreet claimed that he marched his men too slowly, leaving Jackson to bear the brunt of the fighting for two days, but they covered roughly in a little over 24 hours and Lee did not attempt to get his army concentrated any faster.\nWhen Longstreet's men arrived on the field around midday on August 29, Lee planned a flanking attack on the Union Army, which was concentrating its attention on Jackson. Longstreet demurred to three suggestions from Lee urging him to attack, recommending instead a reconnaissance in force to survey the ground in front of him. This confirmed the presence of Porter's V Corps in front of his lines. By 6:30 P.M., Hood's division moved forward against Porter and drove back the soldiers it encountered, but had to be withdrawn at night when it advanced too far ahead of the main lines. Despite the smashing victory that followed, Longstreet was eventually criticized for allegedly being slow, reluctant to attack, and disobedient to General Lee. Lee's biographer, Douglas Southall Freeman, wrote: \"The seeds of much of the disaster at Gettysburg were sown in that instant\u2014when Lee yielded to Longstreet and Longstreet discovered that he would.\" Wert disputes this conclusion, pointing out that in a post-war letter to Longstreet, Porter told him that had he attacked him that day, Longstreet's \"loss would have been enormous\".\nDespite this criticism, the following day was, according to Wert, one of Longstreet's finest performances of the war. After his attacks on the 29th, Pope came to believe with little evidence that Jackson was in retreat. He ordered a reluctant Porter to pursue, and his corps collided with Jackson's men and suffered heavy casualties. The attack exposed the Union left flank, and Longstreet took advantage of this by launching a massive assault on the Union flank with over 25,000 men. For over four hours they \"pounded like a giant hammer\" with Longstreet actively directing artillery fire and sending brigades into the fray. Longstreet and Lee were together during the assault and both of them came under Union artillery fire. Although the Union troops put up a furious defense, Pope's army was forced to retreat in a manner similar to the embarrassing Union defeat at First Bull Run, fought on roughly the same battleground. Longstreet gave the credit for the victory to Lee, describing the campaign as \"clever and brilliant\". It established a strategic model he believed to be ideal\u2014the use of defensive tactics within a strategic offensive. On September 1, Jackson's corps moved to cut off the Union retreat at the Battle of Chantilly. Longstreet's men remained on the field to fool Pope into thinking that Lee's entire army was still on his front.\nAntietam.\nAfter the Confederate success at Second Manassas, Lee, holding the strategic initiative, decided to take the war to Maryland to relieve Virginia and hopefully induce foreign nations to come to the Confederates' aid. Longstreet supported the plan. \"The situation called for action\", he later said, \"and there was but one opening \u2013 across the Potomac.\" His men crossed into Maryland on September 6 and arrived in Frederick the following day, beginning the Maryland campaign. At the Battle of Antietam (Sharpsburg) on September 17, rather than commit his forces all at once, McClellan made a series of partial attacks on Confederate troops at different places throughout the day while holding many of his troops, including the entire V Corps, in reserve. At dawn, Hood's division on the Confederate left was driven back by an assault from Hooker's and Joseph K. Mansfield's corps until reinforced by men from Jackson's command. More troops from both sides soon poured into the fighting, which raged for three hours. At the center of the field, D.H. Hill's division defended a 600-yard (548.6 meters) position dominated by a sunken wagon path. The position was naturally strong, made more so by the piling of planks from a wooden fence at the top of the ditch, and Hill's men firmly repulsed two successive charges from the Union divisions of William H. French and Richardson. Hill suffered significant casualties, and Longstreet sent R.H. Anderson's division, which consisted of 3,500 men, to reinforce him. Anderson was wounded and replaced by Pryor. At Pryor's request, Longstreet sent artillery support in response to Union cannon being fired at Confederates in the road from across Antietam Creek. He also ordered a flanking movement by about 900 soldiers in several regiments led by Colonel John Rogers Cooke. Union troops arrested Cooke's advance. An intense fight followed, and Cooke withdrew after his ammunition was expended. A mistaken order allowed Union troops to breach the Confederate position at the sunken road, but Confederate lines were stabilized.\nAt this point in the afternoon, fighting largely ceased except for on the Confederate right. The Union left-wing under Major General Ambrose Burnside attempted to cross the Antietam Creek at what would become known as Burnside's Bridge, while Jones' division led by Brigadier General Robert Toombs's brigade defended the heights on the western side of the creek. For hours, the Union troops tried to cross the river and failed five times. Finally at 4 P.M., a flanking maneuver forced Toombs to withdraw. After the further engagement, the remainder of Jones' division was forced to give way, and Burnside's men occupied the crest overlooking the river before pressing their advantage. Their progress was arrested by the arrival of A.P. Hill's division under Jackson from Harpers Ferry. Fighting ensued in the town of Sharpsburg until Burnside withdrew his men at dusk. The Confederates pursued their enemy but stopped once the retreating troops came under the protection of a battery on the opposite side of the river, ending the Battle of Antietam after 18 hours of fighting. At the end of that bloodiest day of the Civil War, Lee greeted his subordinate by saying, \"Ah! Here is Longstreet; here's my old \"war-horse!\"\" Lee held his ground at Antietam until the evening of September 18, when he withdrew his army from the battlefield and took it back across the Potomac and into Virginia. On October 9, a few weeks after Antietam, Longstreet was promoted to lieutenant general. Lee arranged for Longstreet's promotion to be dated one day earlier than Jackson's, making the Old War-Horse the senior lieutenant general in the Army of Northern Virginia. In an army reorganization in November, Longstreet's command was designated the First Corps, and Jackson's the Second Corps. The First Corps consisted of five divisions, approximately 41,000 men. The divisions were commanded by Lafayette McLaws, R.H. Anderson, Hood, Pickett, and Robert Ransom Jr.\nFredericksburg.\nAfter a lengthy interlude with little military activity, beginning on October 26, McClellan marched his army across the Potomac River. On November 7, Lincoln replaced McClellan with Burnside. On November 15, Burnside began moving his army south towards Fredericksburg, Virginia, midway between the opposing capitals. On November 18, Longstreet began marching his men out of army headquarters in Culpeper towards Fredericksburg, where the Confederate army would make its stand against Burnside. Since Lee moved Longstreet to Fredericksburg early, it allowed Longstreet to build strong defenses. Longstreet ordered trenches, abatis, and fieldworks to be constructed south of the town along a stone wall at the foot of Marye's Heights. After a lengthy delay, caused by waiting for the arrival of supplies to build pontoon bridges, Burnside attempted to cross the Rappahannock on December 11. Soldiers attempting to lay pontoon bridges encountered fierce resistance from Confederate troops inside Fredericksburg, led by William Barksdale's brigade of McLaws' division. Burnside subsequently ordered an artillery bombardment of the town, and by the following day had moved his army across and occupied Fredericksburg. December 12 saw only a small amount of desultory fighting.\nLongstreet had his men firmly entrenched. On December 13, under Burnside's orders, troops from the Union Right Grand Division under Sumner and the Center Grand Division under Hooker undertook to carry the position held by Longstreet's troops, who, contrary to some of their expectations, found themselves at the center of the battle. The first Union assault on Longstreet's men at Marye's Heights was a disastrous failure, causing approximately 1,000 casualties within 30 minutes. When Lee expressed apprehension that the Federal troops might overrun Longstreet's men, Longstreet replied that as long as he had sufficient ammunition he would \"kill them all\" before any of them reached his line. He advised him to look towards Jackson's more tenuous position to the right. Longstreet was proven correct, as from their strong position his troops easily repulsed several assaults. In some places behind the stone wall, Confederate ranks were four to five troops deep. Soldiers in the rear loaded rifles and passed them up to the front, so that the fire was virtually continuous. Confederate troops were well protected, although they did suffer one notable casualty when Brigadier General Thomas Reade Rootes Cobb, who commanded a brigade in McLaws' division that was positioned at the front of the stone wall, was killed. One Union general compared the scene before Marye's Heights to \"a great slaughter pen\" and said that his men \"might as well have tried to take Hell\". McLaws estimated that only one Union soldier lay dead within 30 yards of the wall, the rest having fallen much farther back. Jackson, meanwhile, managed with much greater difficulty to repel a strong Union assault spearheaded by the division of George Meade. Sensing that the rest of his troops would be adequate to defend his position on the Confederate left on the heights, Longstreet had ordered Hood to reinforce Jackson, and Pickett to cooperate with him, but Hood hesitated in sending his division forward, and by the time he did, the fighting on Jackson's front had mostly ended. Longstreet expressed regret after the war for \"not bringing the delinquent [Hood] to trial\".\nBurnside intended to attack again the next day, but several of his officers, particularly Sumner, advised against it. He entrenched his men instead and withdrew on December 15. In Longstreet's report, he praised his men and officers while asking them to contribute money for the residents of Fredericksburg. Lee's report strongly commended Jackson and Longstreet. Burnside's army had suffered 12,653 casualties at Fredericksburg. About 70% of them were in front of Marye's Heights. Lee suffered only about 5,300 losses, about 1,900 of which came from Longstreet. Lt. Col. Edward Porter Alexander of the artillery described Fredericksburg as \"the easiest battle we ever fought.\"\nSuffolk.\nIn October 1862, Longstreet had suggested to Joe Johnston that he be sent to fight in the war's Western Theater. Shortly after Fredericksburg, Longstreet vaguely suggested to Lee that \"one corps could hold the line of the Rappahannock while the other was operating elsewhere\". In February 1863, he made a more specific request, suggesting to Wigfall that his corps be detached from the Army of Northern Virginia and sent to reinforce the Army of Tennessee, where General Braxton Bragg was being challenged in Middle Tennessee by the Army of the Cumberland under Union Major General William S. Rosecrans, Longstreet's roommate at West Point. By this time, Longstreet could be identified as part of a \"western concentration bloc\" which believed that reinforcing Confederate armies operating in the Western Theater to protect the states in that part of the Confederacy from invasion was more important than offensive campaigns in the Eastern Theater. This group also included Johnston and Louis Wigfall, now a Confederate senator, both of whom Longstreet was very close with. These people were generally cautious and believed that the Confederacy, with its limited resources, should engage in a defensive rather than an offensive war. Lee did detach two divisions from the First Corps but ordered them to Richmond, not Tennessee. The Confederate Army was suffering from an acute food shortage. Southern Virginia was said to have large quantities of cattle and substantial stores of bacon and corn. Meanwhile, seaborne movements of the Union IX Corps were thought to be aimed at launching an invasion of the Confederate coast anywhere from South Carolina to Southern Virginia. In response, Lee ordered Pickett's division to the capital in mid-February. Hood's division followed, and then Longstreet himself was told to take command of the detached divisions and the Departments of North Carolina and Southern Virginia. The divisions of McLaws and Anderson remained with Lee.\nIn March, Longstreet's men primarily conducted foraging expeditions in Virginia and North Carolina. Longstreet sent Brigadier General Richard B. Garnett's brigade to D.H. Hill to participate in Hill's attempt to capture New Bern, a town on the North Carolina coast which had fallen to the Union in March 1862. The campaign was unsuccessful but netted a considerable amount of supplies. In April, Longstreet besieged Union forces in the city of Suffolk, Virginia. Fighting was light and nothing came of the siege. At the end of April, Longstreet was ordered by Secretary of War James Seddon to join Lee's army as it faced attack from the Army of the Potomac, now commanded by Hooker, at the Battle of Chancellorsville. He moved his divisions north but could not reach the battle in time. Longstreet's foraging operations yielded enough food to feed Lee's entire army for two months. However, no further military objective was reached, and the operation caused Longstreet and 15,000 men of the First Corps to be absent from Chancellorsville. A 1936 Longstreet biography argued that he delayed returning to Lee due to his desire for independent command. However, Wert disputes this conclusion, and Sorrel says that it was \"humanly impossible\" for the men to move any faster.\nGettysburg.\nCampaign plans.\nFollowing Chancellorsville and the death of Stonewall Jackson, Longstreet and Lee met in mid-May to discuss the army's summer campaign. Longstreet once more pushed for the detachment of all or part of his corps to be sent to Tennessee. The justification for this course of action was becoming more urgent as Union Major General Ulysses S. Grant was advancing on the critical Confederate stronghold on the Mississippi River, Vicksburg. Longstreet argued that a reinforced army under Bragg could defeat Rosecrans and drive toward the Ohio River, which would compel Grant to break his hold on Vicksburg. He advanced these views during a meeting with Seddon, who approved of the idea but doubted that Lee would, and opined that Davis would be unlikely to go against Lee's wishes. Longstreet had criticized Bragg's generalship and may have been hoping to replace him, although he also might have wished to see Joseph Johnston take command, and indicated that he would be content to serve under him as a corps commander. Lee prevented this by telling Davis that parting with large numbers of troops would force him to move his army closer to Richmond, and instead advanced a plan to invade Pennsylvania. A campaign in the North would relieve agricultural and military pressure that the war was placing on Virginia and North Carolina, and, by threatening a federal city, disrupt Union offensives elsewhere and erode support for the war among Northern civilians. In his memoirs, Longstreet described his reaction to Lee's proposal:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;His plan or wishes announced, it became useless and improper to offer suggestions leading to a different course. All that I could ask was that the policy of the campaign should be one of defensive tactics; that we should work so as to force the enemy to attack us, in such good position as we might find in our own country, so well adapted to that purpose\u2014which might assure us of a grand triumph. To this, he readily assented as an important and material adjunct to his general plan.\nThere is conflicting evidence for the veracity of Longstreet's account. It was written years after the campaign and is affected by hindsight, both of the results of the battle and of heavy postbellum criticism. In letters of the time, Longstreet made no reference to such a bargain. In April 1868, Lee said that he \"had never made any such promise, and had never thought of doing any such thing\". Yet in his post-battle report, Lee wrote, \"It had not been intended to fight a general battle at such a distance from our base, unless attacked by the enemy.\"\nThe Army of Northern Virginia was reorganized after Jackson's death. Two division commanders, Richard S. Ewell and A.P. Hill, were promoted to lieutenant general and assumed command of the Second and the newly created Third Corps respectively. Longstreet's First Corps gave up R.H. Anderson's division during the reorganization, leaving Longstreet with the divisions of Hood, McLaws, and Pickett.\nAfter determining that an advance north was inevitable, Longstreet dispatched the scout Henry Thomas Harrison, whom he had met during the Suffolk Campaign, to gather information. He paid Harrison in gold and told him that he \"did not care to see him till he could bring information of importance\". Ewell's corps led the army north, followed by Longstreet's and Hill's. The First Corps crossed the Potomac River from June 25 to 26. Harrison reported to Longstreet on the evening of June 28 and was instrumental in warning the Confederates that the Army of the Potomac was advancing north to meet them more quickly than they had anticipated, and was already gathered around Frederick, Maryland. Lee was initially skeptical, but the report prompted him to order the immediate concentration of his army north of Frederick near Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Harrison also brought news that Hooker had been replaced as commander of the Army of the Potomac by Meade.\nJuly 1\u20132.\nLongstreet's actions at the Battle of Gettysburg would become the centerpiece of lasting controversy. Longstreet arrived on the battlefield at about 4:30p.m on the first day, July 1, 1863, hours ahead of his troops. Lee had not intended to fight before his army was fully concentrated, but chance and decisions by A.P. Hill, whose troops were the first to be engaged, brought on the confrontation. The battle on the first day was a strong Confederate victory. Two Union corps had been driven by Ewell and Hill from their positions north of Gettysburg back through the town into defensive positions on the heights to the south. Meeting with Lee, Longstreet was concerned about the strength of the Union defensive position on elevated ground and advocated a strategic movement around their left flank, to \"secure good ground between him and his capital\", which would presumably compel Meade to attack defensive positions erected by the Confederates. Instead, Lee exclaimed, \"If the enemy is there tomorrow, I will attack him.\" Longstreet replied, \"If he is there tomorrow it is because he wants you to attack.\" Lee, energized by the success of his army that day, again refused. Longstreet suggested an immediate assault on the federal positions, but Lee insisted on waiting for Hood and McLaws, who were marching towards Gettysburg on the Chambersburg Pike. Longstreet sent a courier down the Cashtown Road to hurry them along. They eventually bivouacked about four miles (6.4\u00a0km) behind the lines. Pickett was performing rearguard duty in Cashtown and would not be ready to move until morning. A major blunder occurred when Ewell failed to seize the heights on Cemetery Hill after being ordered to do so \"if practicable\" by Lee.\nLee's plan for July 2 called for Longstreet to attack the Union's left flank, to be followed by Hill's attack on Cemetery Ridge near the center, while Ewell demonstrated on the Union right. Longstreet again argued for a flanking maneuver around the Union left, but Lee rejected his plan. Longstreet was not ready to attack as early as Lee envisioned. He received permission from Lee to wait for Law's brigade of Hood's division to reach the field before advancing. Law marched his men quickly, covering in eleven hours, but did not arrive until noon. Three of Longstreet's brigades were still in march column some distance from their designated positions. Longstreet's soldiers were forced to take a long detour while approaching the enemy position, misled by inadequate reconnaissance that failed to identify a completely concealed route.\nPostbellum criticism of Longstreet claims that he was ordered by Lee to attack in the early morning and that his delays were a significant contributor to the loss of the battle. Early and William N. Pendleton testified that Lee had ordered Longstreet to attack at sunrise and that Longstreet disobeyed. This claim was factually untrue and denied by Lee's staff officers Walter H. Taylor and Charles Marshall. Lee agreed to the delays for arriving troops and did not issue his formal order for the attack until 11 A.M. Longstreet did not aggressively pursue Lee's orders to launch an attack. Sorrel writes that Longstreet, unenthusiastic about the attack, displayed lethargy in bringing his troops forward. While Lee expected an attack around noon, Longstreet was not ready until 4 P.M. Meade used the time to bring more of his troops forward. Campaign historian Edwin Coddington presents the approach to the federal positions as \"a comedy of errors such as one might expect of inexperienced commanders and raw militia, but not of Lee's 'War Horse' and his veteran troops\".\nHood opposed an attack on the Union left, arguing that the Union position was too strong, and proposed that his troops be moved to the right near Big Round Top and hit the Union in the rear. Longstreet insisted that Lee had rejected this plan and ordered him to make the assault against the front of the enemy lines. Once the assault began at around 4\u00a0pm, Longstreet pressed McLaws and Hood strongly against heavy Union resistance. Longstreet personally led the attack on horseback. Union Major General Daniel Sickles, commanding the III Corps, had, contrary to Meade's orders, marched his men to the Peach Orchard, an exposed position well in front of the main Union lines. R.H. Anderson's division of Hill's corps, alongside McLaws' division and part of the division of Hood, launched a ferocious assault against Sickles with heavy artillery support which, after extremely intense fighting, pushed his corps back to the main Union lines. The Confederates were eventually repulsed after encountering fierce resistance from Union reinforcements. General Hood was wounded and replaced in command of his division by Law. Brigade commanders Barksdale and Paul Jones Semmes, both under McLaws, were mortally wounded. Law's brigade attempted to carry Little Round Top, a hill on the far left of the Union lines. The hill had originally been without troops before Union Brigadier General Gouverneur K. Warren, Chief of Engineers, taking advantage of the Confederate delay, sent soldiers from the V Corps to fortify it. Confederate troops took the part of the hill known as Devil's Den, but were unable to drive off Union forces at the top of the hill. The attacks had failed, and Longstreet's corps suffered more than 4,000 casualties. Contributing to Longstreet's failure was that his attacks did not occur simultaneously with those of A.P. Hill and Ewell. Large portions of Hill's and Ewell's corps, including soldiers who had seen significant action the day before, were unengaged, and Meade was able to shift Thomas H. Ruger's division from Ewell's front to oppose Longstreet.\nJuly 3.\nOn the night of July 2, Longstreet did not follow his usual custom of meeting Lee at his headquarters to discuss the day's battle, claiming that he was too fatigued. Instead, he spent part of the night planning for a movement around Big Round Top that would allow him to attack the enemy's flank and rear. Longstreet, despite his use of scouting parties, was apparently unaware that a considerable body of troops from the Union VI Corps under John Sedgwick was in position to block this move. Shortly after issuing orders for the attack, around sunrise, Longstreet was joined at his headquarters by Lee, who was dismayed at this turn of events. The commanding general had intended for Longstreet to attack the Union left early in the morning in a manner similar to the attack of July 2, using Pickett's newly arrived division, in concert with a resumed attack by Ewell on Culp's Hill. What Lee found was that no one had ordered Pickett's division forward from its bivouac in the rear and that Longstreet had been planning an independent operation without consulting with him. Lee wrote in his after-battle report that Longstreet's \"dispositions were not completed as early as was expected\".\nSince his plans for an early morning coordinated attack were now infeasible, Lee instead ordered Longstreet to coordinate a massive assault on the center of the Union line at Cemetery Ridge with his corps. The Union position was held by the II Corps under Winfield Scott Hancock. Longstreet strongly felt that this assault had little chance of success, and shared his concerns with Lee. The Confederates would have to march over close to one mile (1.6\u00a0km) of open ground and negotiate sturdy fences under fire. Longstreet urged Lee not to use his entire corps in the attack, arguing that the divisions of Law and McLaws were tired from the previous day and that shifting them away from their positions would dangerously expose the Confederate right flank. Lee conceded and instead decided to use men from A.P. Hill's corps to accompany Pickett. The force would include about 14,000 or 15,000 men. Longstreet again told Lee that he believed the attack would fail.\nLee did not change his mind, and Longstreet relented. The final plan called for an artillery barrage by 170 cannon under Alexander. Then, the three brigades under Pickett and the four brigades in the division of Henry Heth, temporarily commanded by Brigadier General J. Johnston Pettigrew, positioned to Pickett's left, would lead the attack. Two brigades from William Dorsey Pender's division, temporarily commanded by Brigadier General Isaac R. Trimble, would fill in as support behind Pettigrew. Two brigades from R.H. Anderson's division were to support Pickett's right flank. Despite his vocal disapproval of the plan and although most of the units came from A.P. Hill's corps, Lee designated Longstreet to lead the attack. Longstreet dutifully saw to the positioning of Pickett's men. General Pickett placed the brigades of Garnett and Brigadier General James L. Kemper in front with Armistead behind them in support. However, Longstreet neglected to adequately check on Pettigrew's division. Pettigrew had never commanded a division before, and the division which he had just been appointed to lead had suffered one-third casualties in the fighting on July 1. His men were positioned behind Pickett's lines, leaving Pickett vulnerable, and the troops on his far left were dangerously exposed. Longstreet and Hill still had a tense relationship, which may have played a role in Longstreet not carefully overseeing Hill's troops. Hill was with Lee and Longstreet throughout much of the morning, but wrote after the battle that he had ordered his men to report to Longstreet, implying that he felt he was not responsible for arranging them.\nDuring preparations for the attack, Longstreet began to agonize over the assault. He attempted to pass the responsibility for launching Pickett's division to Alexander. The artillery bombardment began at about 1 P.M. Union batteries responded, and the two sides fired back and forth for about one hour and forty minutes. When the time came to actually order Pickett forward, Longstreet could only nod in assent, unable to verbalize the order, thus beginning the assault known as Pickett's Charge. Beginning at about 3 P.M., Confederate troops marched towards the Union positions. As Longstreet had anticipated, the attack was a complete disaster. The assaulting units suffered massive casualties. Pettigrew and Trimble were wounded. Pickett's first two brigades were severely mauled. Kemper was wounded and Garnett was killed. Armistead's brigade briefly breached the stone wall that marked Hancock's lines, where Armistead fell mortally wounded, but the brigade was repulsed. To his men, Lee said, \"It is all my fault.\" According to two of Longstreet's staff officers, Lee subsequently expressed regret for not taking Longstreet's advice. On July 4, the Confederate army began its retreat from Gettysburg. Hampered by rain, the bulk of the army finally made it across the Potomac River on the night of July 13\u201314.\nChickamauga.\nIn mid-August 1863, Longstreet resumed his attempts to be transferred to the Western Theater. He wrote a private letter to Seddon, requesting that he be transferred to serve under his old friend Joseph Johnston. He followed this up in conversations with his congressional ally Wigfall, who had long considered Longstreet a suitable replacement for Braxton Bragg. Bragg had a poor combat record and was very unpopular with his men and officers. Lee and President Davis agreed to the request on September 5. McLaws, Hood, a brigade from Pickett's division, and Alexander's 26-gun artillery battalion, traveled over 16 railroads on a route through the Carolinas to reach Bragg in northern Georgia. On September 8, with reinforcements on the way, Bragg gave up the fortified city and critical rail juncture of Chattanooga, Tennessee, to Rosecrans without a fight and retreated into Georgia. The troop transfer took over three weeks. Lead elements of the corps arrived on September 17.\nOn September 19 at the Battle of Chickamauga, Bragg began an unsuccessful attempt to interpose his army between Rosecrans and Chattanooga before the arrival of most of Longstreet's corps. Throughout the day, Confederate troops launched largely ineffectual assaults on Union positions that were highly costly for both sides. One of Longstreet's own divisions under Hood successfully resisted a strong Union counterattack from Jefferson C. Davis's division of the XX Corps that afternoon. When Longstreet himself arrived on the field in the late evening, he failed to find Bragg's headquarters. He and his staff spent considerable time riding looking for them. They accidentally came across a federal picket line and were nearly captured.\nWhen the two finally met at Bragg's headquarters late at night, Bragg placed Longstreet in command of the left wing of his army; Lieutenant General Leonidas Polk commanded the right. Longstreet's command consisted of Simon Bolivar Buckner's corps, under which were the divisions of Alexander P. Stewart and William Preston, Bushrod Johnson's division, Thomas C. Hindman's division, and Hood's division. McLaws' division fell under Longstreet's command but did not completely arrive from Virginia until September 21, after the Battle of Chickamauga had ended. Joseph B. Kershaw was placed in command of his two brigades which were on the field. Bragg made a plan for an attack at 8a.m. on September 20. Longstreet lined up most of his men into two lines, but he placed Hood's division behind Johnson in a column, intended as shock troops. The attack was supposed to begin early in the morning shortly after an assault by Polk's wing. However, confusion and mishandled orders caused Polk's attack to be delayed, and Longstreet's advance did not begin until just after 11 after hearing gunfire from his left. A mistaken order from General Rosecrans caused a gap to appear in the Union line by transferring Thomas J. Wood's division from the right to reinforce the XIV Corps under George Henry Thomas in the center.\nLongstreet took advantage of the confusion. The organization of the attack was well suited to the terrain and would have penetrated the Union line regardless. Johnson's division poured through the gap, driving the Union forces back. After Longstreet ordered Hindman's division forward, the Union right collapsed. Rosecrans fled as units began to retreat in panic. Thomas managed to rally the retreating units and solidify a defensive position on Snodgrass Hill. He held that position against repeated afternoon attacks by Longstreet, who was not adequately supported by the Confederate right wing. Sorrel told Stewart to move his division forward to attack the Union rearguard. Stewart initially declined, demanding confirmation from Longstreet. Longstreet was incensed at his refusal and ordered him to go forward. Stewart did so and captured about 400 prisoners, but Thomas had already managed to extricate the units under his control to Chattanooga. Bragg's failure to coordinate the right wing and cavalry to further envelop Thomas prevented a total rout of the Union Army. Bragg also refused to pursue the retreating Federals aggressively, resulting in the futile Siege of Chattanooga. He had dismissed a proposal from Longstreet that he do so, citing a lack of transportation and calling the plan a \"visionary scheme\". Nevertheless, Chickamauga was the greatest Confederate victory in the Western Theater and Longstreet received significant credit.\nTennessee.\nNot long after the Confederates entered Tennessee following their victory at Chickamauga, Longstreet clashed with Bragg and became a leader of the group of senior commanders who conspired to have him removed. Bragg's subordinates had long been dissatisfied with his abrasive personality and poor battlefield record; the arrival of Longstreet (the senior lieutenant general in the Army) and his officers, and the fact that they quickly took their side against Bragg, added credibility to the earlier claims. Longstreet wrote to Seddon, \"I am convinced that nothing but the hand of God can save us or help us as long as we have our present commander.\" The situation became so grave that Davis was forced to intercede in person. What followed was a scene in which Bragg sat red-faced as a procession of his subordinates condemned him. Longstreet stated that Bragg \"was incompetent to manage an army or put men into a fight\" and that he \"knew nothing of the business\". On October 12, Davis declared his support for Bragg. He left him and his dissatisfied subordinates in their positions.\nBragg relieved or reassigned the generals who had testified against him and retaliated against Longstreet by reducing his command to only those units that he brought with him from Virginia. Bragg resigned himself to the siege in Chattanooga. At about this time, Longstreet learned of the birth of a son, who was named Robert Lee. Grant arrived in Chattanooga on October 23 and took overall command of the new Union Military Division of the Mississippi. He replaced Rosecrans with Thomas.\nWhile Longstreet's relationship with Bragg was extremely poor, his connections with his subordinates also deteriorated. He had a strong antebellum friendship with McLaws, but it began to show signs of souring after McLaws criticized Longstreet's conduct at Gettysburg and was accused by Longstreet of displaying lethargy after Chickamauga. Hood's old division was under the temporary command of Brigadier General Micah Jenkins. The brigadier general who had been in the division the longest was Evander Law, who had temporarily commanded the division more than once in the past. However, Jenkins outranked Law. Jenkins and Law disliked each other, and both desired permanent command of the division. Longstreet favored Jenkins, his longtime prot\u00e9g\u00e9, while most of the men favored Law. Longstreet had asked Davis to name a permanent commander, but he refused.\nOn October 27, Union troops managed to open up a \"cracker line\" to access food by defeating Law's brigade under Jenkins at the Battle of Brown's Ferry. In the nighttime Battle of Wauhatchie from October 28\u201329, Jenkins failed to regain the lost position, for which he blamed Law and Brigadier General Jerome B. Robertson. Longstreet took no immediate action against Law but complained about Robertson. A court of inquiry was set up, but its proceedings were suspended and Robertson returned to command.\nAfter the Confederate failures, Longstreet devised a strategy to prevent reinforcement and lifting of the siege by Grant. He knew this Union reaction was underway, and that the nearest railhead was Bridgeport, Alabama, where portions of two Union corps would soon arrive. After sending his artillery commander, Porter Alexander, to reconnoiter the Union-occupied town, he devised a plan to shift most of the Army of Tennessee away from the siege, setting up logistical support in Rome, Georgia, to go after Bridgeport to take the railhead, possibly catching Hooker, who was leading a detachment of arriving Union troops from the Eastern Theater, in a disadvantageous position. The plan was well received and approved by President Davis, but it was disapproved by Bragg, who objected to the significant logistical challenges it posed. Longstreet accepted Bragg's arguments and agreed to a plan in which he and his men were dispatched to East Tennessee to deal with an advance by the Union Army of the Ohio, commanded by Burnside. Longstreet was selected both due to enmity on Bragg's part and because the War Department intended for Longstreet's men to return to Lee's army and this movement was in that direction. Thus began the Knoxville campaign.\nLongstreet was criticized for the slow pace of his advance toward Knoxville in November, and some of his soldiers began using the nickname \"Peter the Slow\" to describe him. At the Battle of Campbell's Station on November 16, the Federals evaded Longstreet's troops. This was due both to the poor performance of Law, who exposed his brigade to the enemy and thus ruined what was supposed to be a surprise attack, and Burnside's skillful retreat. The Confederates also dealt with muddy roads and a shortage of good supplies.\nBurnside settled into entrenchments around the city, which Longstreet besieged. Longstreet learned that Bragg had been defeated at Chattanooga on November 25 and that Major General William Tecumseh Sherman's men were marching to relieve Burnside. He decided to risk a frontal attack on Union entrenchments before they arrived. On November 29, he sent his troops forward at the Battle of Fort Sanders. Union soldiers repulsed the attack, and Longstreet was forced to retreat. When Grant defeated Bragg, Longstreet was ordered to join forces with the Army of Tennessee in northern Georgia. He demurred and began to move back to Virginia, soon pursued by Sherman. Longstreet engaged Federal troops at Bean's Station on December 14, after which the campaign effectively ended. The greatest effect of the campaign was to deprive Bragg of troops he sorely needed in Chattanooga. Longstreet's second independent command (after Suffolk) was a failure and his self-confidence was damaged. He reacted to the failure of the campaign by blaming others. He relieved Lafayette McLaws from command and requested the court-martial of Robertson and Law. He also submitted a letter of resignation to Adjutant General Samuel Cooper on December 30, 1863, but his request to be relieved was denied. Bragg was relieved from command and replaced by Joseph Johnston on December 27.\nLongstreet established winter quarters in Russellville and Morristown. He attempted to keep communications open with Lee's army in Virginia, but Federal cavalry Brigadier General William W. Averell's raids destroyed the railroads, isolating him and forcing him to rely only on Eastern Tennessee for supplies. Longstreet's corps suffered through a severe winter in Eastern Tennessee with inadequate shelter and provisions. More than half of the men were without shoes. Writing to Georgia's Quartermaster General Ira Roe Foster on January 24, 1864, Longstreet noted: \"There are five Georgia Brigades in this Army ... all alike in excessive need of shoes, clothing of all kinds, and blankets. All that you can send will be thankfully received.\"\nIn February 1864, the lines of communication were repaired. Once the weather warmed, Longstreet's men marched north to the Army of Northern Virginia at Gordonsville.\nWilderness to Appomattox.\nIn March, Longstreet rejoined the Army of Northern Virginia. Presented by Lee with a plan for a joint offensive by Johnston and Longstreet into Kentucky, Longstreet made the scheme bolder by adding 20,000 men under General Beauregard, who was headquartered in South Carolina. However, the plan met with disapproval from President Davis and his newly appointed military advisor, Braxton Bragg, and Longstreet remained in Virginia.\nLongstreet discovered that his old friend Grant had been appointed General-in-Chief of the Union Army, with headquarters in the field alongside the Army of the Potomac. Longstreet told his fellow officers that \"he will fight us every day and every hour until the end of the war.\" Longstreet helped save the Confederate Army from defeat in his first battle back with Lee's army, the Battle of the Wilderness in May 1864. After Grant moved south of the Rapidan River in an attempt to take Richmond, Lee intended to delay battle to give Longstreet's 14,000 men time to arrive. Grant disrupted these plans by attacking him on May 5, and the fighting was inconclusive. The following morning at 5\u00a0am, Hancock led two divisions in a ferocious attack on A.P. Hill's corps, driving the men back two miles (3.2\u00a0km). As this was happening, Longstreet's men arrived. They took advantage of an old roadbed built for an out-of-use railroad to creep through a densely wooded area unnoticed before launching a powerful flanking attack.\nLongstreet's men moved forward along the Orange Plank Road against the II Corps and in two hours nearly drove it from the field. He developed tactics to deal with difficult terrain, ordering the advance of six brigades by heavy skirmish lines, which allowed his men to deliver a continuous fire into the enemy while proving to be elusive targets themselves. Historian Edward Steere attributed much of the success of the Army to \"the display of tactical genius by Longstreet which more than redressed his disparity in numerical strength\". After the war, Hancock said to Longstreet of this flanking maneuver: \"You rolled me up like a wet blanket.\"\nDuring the assault, Longstreet was wounded by friendly fire only away from where Stonewall Jackson was accidentally wounded almost exactly a year earlier during the Chancellorsville campaign. A bullet passed through his shoulder, severing nerves, and tearing a gash in his throat. Jenkins, who was riding with Longstreet, was also shot and died from his wounds. The momentum of the attack subsided. As he was taken from the field, Longstreet urged Lee to press the attack. Instead, Lee delayed further movement until units could be realigned, giving the Union defenders adequate time to reorganize. The subsequent attack was a failure. According to Alexander: \"I have always believed that, but for Longstreet's fall, the panic which was fairly underway in Hancock's [II] Corps would have been extended &amp; have resulted in Grant's being forced to retreat back across the Rapidan.\"\nLongstreet was succeeded in command of his corps by R.H. Anderson. He missed the rest of the 1864 spring and summer campaign. Without him, the Confederate army fought Grant at Spotsylvania Court House and was besieged by Union forces at Petersburg. On May 1, he was confirmed as an Episcopalian. He was treated in Lynchburg, Virginia, and recuperated in Augusta, Georgia, with relatives. While in Augusta, he participated in the funeral service for Polk at Saint Paul's Church, casting earth onto the coffin. He rejoined Lee in October 1864, with his right arm paralyzed and in a sling, initially unable to ride a horse. He had taught himself to write with his left hand; by periodically pulling on his arm, as advised by doctors, he regained the use of his right hand in later years. At this time, Longstreet's staff underwent major changes, most significantly the transfer of Sorrel, Longstreet's Chief of Staff, to brigade command. He was replaced by Major Osmun Latrobe. For the remainder of the Siege of Petersburg, Longstreet commanded the defenses in front of the capital of Richmond, including all forces north of the James River and Pickett's Division at Bermuda Hundred. He retreated with Lee in the Appomattox campaign, commanding both the First and Third Corps, following the death of A.P. Hill on April 2.\nAs Lee's army attempted to escape to Farmville, Longstreet was engaged at Sailor's Creek on April 6. The Confederates were unable to reach the town, but with the assistance of troops under Anderson and Ewell, managed to prevent federal troops from blocking the army's last path of escape. The overall battle ended in disaster, with nearly 7,000 of the 10,000 Confederate troops engaged killed, wounded, or captured. By April 7, Lee's army had been reduced from nearly 40,000 men on March 31 to 25,000. A group of Confederate officers including William Pendleton, the Chief of Artillery, concluded that the time had come to ask Lee to open negotiations for the army's surrender. Pendleton approached Longstreet and asked him to intercede with Lee, but he refused, saying, \"If General Lee doesn't know when to surrender until I tell him, he will never know.\" Pendleton approached Lee, who was in communication with Grant on the subject of surrender. Lee refused to surrender the army. Lee held his last conference of war on the night of April 8. It was decided that at daybreak, Longstreet would hold the Union troops back while John B. Gordon would lead an escape towards Lynchburg, and then cover his retreat. At the Battle of Appomattox Court House that morning, Longstreet was heavily engaged with the Union II Corps under Andrew A. Humphreys. Gordon's troops were surrounded, and he requested reinforcements which Longstreet could not furnish. Lee was left with no alternative but to meet Grant to discuss surrender.\nLee worried that his refusal to meet with Grant to discuss surrender terms at the latter's first request would cause him to demand harsher terms. Longstreet advised him of his belief that Grant would treat them fairly. As Lee rode toward Appomattox Court House on April 9, Longstreet said that if Grant gave too strong demands, he ought to \"break off the interview and tell General Grant to do his worst\". After Lee's surrender, Longstreet arrived in the McLean House, where Grant happily greeted him. He offered Longstreet a cigar and invited him to play cards. \"Why do men fight who were born to be brothers?...His whole greeting and conduct towards us was as though nothing had ever happened to mar our pleasant relations\", Longstreet told a reporter.\nReconstruction era.\nOn June 7, 1865, Lee, Longstreet, and other former Confederate officers were indicted by a grand jury in Norfolk, Virginia for the high crime of treason against the United States, a capital offense. Grant objected and went to the White House, telling President Andrew Johnson that the men were on parole and protected by the surrender terms at Appomattox. When Grant threatened to resign, Johnson backed down, and on June 20, Attorney General James Speed ordered the United States Attorney in Norfolk to drop treason proceedings.\nLongstreet and his family settled in New Orleans, popular among former Confederate generals. He entered into a cotton-brokerage partnership and became president of the Southern and Western Life and Accident Insurance Company. He sought the presidency of the Mobile and Ohio Railroad but was unsuccessful, and also failed in an attempt to get investors for a proposed railroad from New Orleans to Monterrey, Mexico. With Grant's support, he applied for a pardon from Johnson. Johnson refused, telling Longstreet: \"There are three persons of the South who can never receive amnesty: Mr. Davis, General Lee, and yourself. You have given the Union cause too much trouble.\"\nLongstreet called for Southern acceptance of Reconstruction and acquiescence to federal laws, including those abolishing slavery and granting citizenship to blacks. He encouraged Southern whites to join the heavily Northern Republican Party, arguing that if they did not, the Southern wing of the party would be exclusively dominated by blacks, whereas white men joining the party would allow the black vote to be controlled. In June 1868, the Radical Republican-controlled United States Congress enacted a law that granted pardons and restored political rights to numerous former Confederate officers, including Longstreet. Longstreet joined the Republicans, or, as Southerners sometimes called them, \"Black Republicans\". He endorsed Grant for president in the 1868 election, attended his inauguration in Washington, D.C., and six days later was appointed by Grant as surveyor of customs in New Orleans. The post carried an annual salary of $6,000, and Longstreet was confirmed by the Senate by a vote of 25\u201310. For these acts, he lost favor with many white Southerners, who regarded him as a traitor for supporting the people they viewed as oppressive occupiers. His old friend D.H. Hill wrote to a newspaper: \"Our scalawag is the local leper of the community.\" In contrast to Northerners who moved South and were sometimes referred to as \"Carpetbaggers\", Hill wrote, Longstreet \"is a native, which is so much the worse\". Longstreet did not retreat in face of the criticism. He actively supported Henry C. Warmoth, the Republican Governor of Louisiana and a former Union officer. In May 1870, Warmoth named him adjutant general of the Louisiana State Militia. About one month later, he was named president of the newly organized New Orleans and Northeastern Railroad. On January 8, 1872, Longstreet was commissioned a major general in the state militia and assigned to the command of all militia and police forces in New Orleans. Shortly after, he resigned his posts as a collector of customs and as railroad president, followed in April by his position as adjutant general in the militia.\nAuthors espousing the Lost Cause, a movement that glorified the Southern cause and denounced Reconstruction, attacked Longstreet's war career for years after his death. Modern authors trace that criticism to Longstreet's acceptance of the defeat and accommodations both with the Republican party and freed blacks. The attacks formally began on January 19, 1872, the anniversary of Lee's birth and less than two years after Lee died. Jubal Early, in a speech at Washington College, exonerated Lee for the defeat at Gettysburg. He accused Longstreet of attacking late on the second day and held him accountable for the debacle on the third. The following year, William Pendleton claimed in the same venue that Longstreet disobeyed an explicit order to attack at sunrise on July 2. The so-called sunrise order was a fabrication.\nIn April 1873, Longstreet dispatched a police force under Colonel Theodore W. DeKlyne to Colfax, Louisiana, to help the local government and its majority-black supporters defend themselves against an insurrection by white supremacists. DeKlyne did not arrive until April 14, one day after the Colfax massacre. His men's task consisted mainly of burying blacks who had been killed and attempting to arrest the culprits. During protests of election irregularities in 1874, referred to as the Battle of Liberty Place, an armed force of 8,400 members of the anti-Reconstructionist White League advanced on the State House in New Orleans, which was the capitol of Louisiana at the time, after Republican William Pitt Kellogg was declared the winner of a close and heavily disputed gubernatorial election. Longstreet commanded a force of 3,600 Metropolitan Police, city policemen, and African-American militia troops, armed with two Gatling guns and a battery of artillery. He rode to meet the protesters but was pulled from his horse, shot by a spent ball, and taken prisoner. The White League charged, causing many of Longstreet's men to flee or surrender. Total casualties amounted to 38 killed and 79 wounded. Federal troops sent by President Grant were required to restore order. Longstreet's use of armed black troops during the disturbances increased the denunciations by anti-Reconstructionists.\nIn 1875, Longstreet began to challenge the criticisms of his war record, demanding evidence from Pendleton and Lee's staff officers. By then, these charges, alongside anger at him for his use of black troops in Louisiana, had destroyed his reputation. Longstreet published a series of articles defending his war record. At the same time, he became popular with Northerners, who thought highly of his support for Reconstruction and praise for Grant. Throughout the 1880s and 1890s, Longstreet often gave speeches in the North, many of them in the presence of Union veterans, and was received favorably. A large ceremony took place in Atlanta in 1886 to mark the 25th anniversary of the attack on Fort Sumter. Longstreet was not invited, but he went anyway. He was embraced by Jefferson Davis, and a crowd cheered.\nIn 1875 the Longstreet family left New Orleans with concerns over health and safety, returning to Gainesville, Georgia. By this time Louise had given birth to ten children, five of whom lived to adulthood. Longstreet continued to serve on the city school board and as an administrator of the University of Louisiana, later Tulane University. In March 1877, on one of his frequent trips to New Orleans on business, Longstreet converted to Catholicism and remained a devout believer until his death. Fr. Abram J. Ryan, author of \"The Conquered Banner\", encouraged Longstreet to convert, assuring him he would be welcomed with open arms if he came into the Church.\nLater life.\nLongstreet applied for various jobs through the Rutherford B. Hayes administration of 1877\u20131881 and was briefly considered for Secretary of the Navy. He served briefly as deputy collector of internal revenue and as postmaster of Gainesville. Longstreet's chief ambition was to be U.S. Marshal of Georgia. President Hayes appointed Longstreet as his Minister Resident to the Ottoman Empire, a position he held from December 14, 1880, to April 29, 1881. Longstreet suffered from the high cost of living in Constantinople. It prevented him from bringing his family, and the entertainment that he was expected to provide left him financially worse off than when he arrived. His only known accomplishments were ordering a disaster relief expedition and convincing Sultan Abdul Hamid II to reverse his position forbidding American archeologists from undertaking research in Ottoman territories. He was granted a 60-day leave to tour Europe before being recalled in accordance with his own desires after the marshal position became available.\nLongstreet served as a U.S. Marshal of Georgia from 1881 to 1884, when he resigned amid allegations of corruption. His resignation, followed by the return of a Democratic administration under Grover Cleveland in 1885, largely ended his political career, and he went into semi-retirement on a farm near Gainesville, where he raised turkeys and planted orchards and vineyards on terraced ground that his neighbors referred to jokingly as \"Gettysburg\". Longstreet remained active in Georgia Republican politics. He supported James G. Blaine over incumbent Chester A. Arthur for the Republican presidential nomination in 1884 and was a Georgia elector for Republican nominee Benjamin Harrison in 1888, while continuing to offer public commentary on the war and ongoing political events. A devastating fire on April 9, 1889, destroyed his house and many of his possessions, including his personal papers and memorabilia. That December, Louise Longstreet died.\nLongstreet rebutted criticism of his war record from other Confederates in his memoirs, \"From Manassas to Appomattox\", a labor of five years published in 1896. Piston describes the prose as \"entertaining, if occasionally labored\". In the book, Longstreet praises several Civil War officers but frequently disparages others, particularly his postwar detractors Jubal Early and Fitzhugh Lee. He expresses personal affection for Lee but is at times critical of his strategy. Piston argues that the quality of the book is diminished by bitterness and lack of objectivity. It did little to alter the views of Longstreet's opponents.\nLongstreet campaigned throughout Georgia for William McKinley in the 1896 presidential election. He served from 1897 to 1904, under presidents McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt, as U.S. Commissioner of Railroads, succeeding Wade Hampton III. In 1897, at the age of 76, in a ceremony at the governor's mansion in Atlanta, Longstreet married 34-year-old librarian Helen Dortch. Although Longstreet's children reacted poorly to the marriage, Helen became a devoted wife and an avid supporter of his legacy after his death. She outlived him by 58 years, dying in 1962. In 1898, Longstreet, then 77, volunteered to lead U.S. troops in Cuba during the Spanish\u2013American War. Longstreet's final years were marked by poor health and partial deafness. In 1902 he suffered from severe rheumatism and was unable to stand for more than a few minutes at a time. His weight diminished from 200 to 135 pounds by January 1903. Cancer developed in his right eye, and in December he had X-ray therapy in Chicago to treat it. He contracted pneumonia and died in Gainesville on January 2, 1904. Bishop Benjamin Joseph Keiley, who had served under Longstreet, said his funeral Mass. Longstreet is buried in Alta Vista Cemetery in Gainesville. He outlived most of his detractors and was one of only a few general officers from the Civil War to live into the 20th century.\nLegacy.\nHistorical reputation.\nLongstreet was subject to vigorous attacks over his war record beginning in the 1870s and continuing after his death. His widow published \"Lee and Longstreet at High Tide\" in his defense and stated that \"the South was seditiously taught to believe that the Federal Victory was wholly the fortuitous outcome of the culpable disobedience of General Longstreet\".\nIn the first half of the 20th century, Freeman kept criticism of Longstreet foremost in Civil War scholarship in his biography of Lee. Speaking of Gettysburg on July 2, 1863, he writes: \"The battle was being decided at that very hour in the mind of Longstreet, who at his camp, a few miles away, was eating his heart away in sullen resentment that Lee had rejected his long cherished plan of a strategic offensive and a tactical defensive.\" He called Longstreet's performance so sluggish that \"it has often been asked why Lee did not arrest him for insubordination or order him before a court-martial\". Freeman moderated his views in his later \"Lee's Lieutenants: a Study in Command\", where he states that Longstreet's \"attitude was wrong but his instinct was correct. He should have obeyed orders, but the order should not have been given.\" Clifford Dowdey, a Virginia newspaperman and novelist, was noted for his severe criticism of Longstreet in the 1950s and 1960s.\nIn 1974, Michael Shaara's novel \"The Killer Angels\" about the Battle of Gettysburg was published, based in part on Longstreet's memoirs. In 1993 the book was adapted into a film, \"Gettysburg\". Longstreet is depicted very favorably in both, significantly improving his standing in popular imagination. Historians Thomas L. Connelly and Barbara L. Bellows' book \"God and General Longstreet\" (1982) also upgraded Longstreet \"through an attack on Lee, the Lost Cause, and the Virginia revisionists\". In 1993, Wert published a new Longstreet biography, stating that his subject was \"the finest corps commander in the Army of Northern Virginia; in fact, he was arguably the best corps commander in the conflict on either side.\" Military historian Richard L. DiNardo wrote: \"Even Longstreet's most virulent critics have conceded that he put together the best staff employed by any commander, and that his \"de facto\" chief of staff, Lieutenant Colonel G. Moxley Sorrel, was the best staff officer in the Confederacy.\" Noting Longstreet's delegation of control of battlefield movements to his staff, DiNardo argues that this allowed him to communicate more effectively during battles. Praise for Longstreet's political conduct is tempered by the fact that he urged white acceptance of Reconstruction at least in part so that whites, and not blacks, would have the preeminent role in rebuilding the South. Nevertheless, he has been commended for his willingness to work with the North, support for black voting rights, and bravery in leading a partially black militia to suppress a white supremacist insurrection.\nMemorials.\nLongstreet is remembered in his hometown of Gainesville, Georgia, through the Longstreet Bridge, a portion of U.S. Route 129 that crosses the Chattahoochee River (later dammed to form Lake Sidney Lanier), and the Longstreet Chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy. In 1998, one of the last monuments erected at Gettysburg National Military Park was dedicated to Longstreet: an equestrian statue by sculptor Gary Casteel. The monument was funded through a grassroots campaign, and is one of the few Confederate monuments in the park \"not paid for by taxpayers in the states of the former Confederacy.\"\nThese two monuments are the only two memorials to Longstreet, whereas there were once more statues of Nathan Bedford Forrest in Tennessee than there were of U.S. President Andrew Jackson. At least one historian attributes this to Longstreet's defense of the \"rights of the freedmen and women\" whereas Forrest was considered the \"avenging angel\" of American white supremacy and the Lost Cause myth.\nLongstreet's Billet, the house in Russellville, Tennessee, that was occupied by Longstreet in the winter of 1863\u201364, is now The Longstreet Museum.\nIn popular culture.\nLongstreet is a minor character in two novels by Ben Ames Williams, one of his descendants: \"House Divided\" (1947) and \"The Unconquered\" (1953). He appears as a cadet in \"Santa Fe Trail\" (1940), played by actor Frank Wilcox.\nLongstreet plays a prominent role in Michael Shaara's Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning novel \"The Killer Angels\" and in the film adaptation \"Gettysburg\", portrayed by Tom Berenger. He is also featured in Shaara's son Jeff Shaara's novel \"Gods and Generals\", a prequel to his father's novel focused on the Eastern Theater before Gettysburg. In the film \"Gods and Generals\" (2003), he is portrayed by Bruce Boxleitner in a minor role.\nIn Harry Turtledove's alternate history series \"Southern Victory\", Longstreet served as the fourth President of the Confederate States of America.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The message inside may also include a Chinese phrase with translation or a list of lucky numbers used by some as lottery numbers. Fortune cookies are often served as a dessert in Chinese restaurants in the United States, Canada, Australia, and other countries, but they are not Chinese in origin. The exact origin of fortune cookies is unclear, though various immigrant groups in California claim to have popularized them in the early 20th century. They most likely originated from cookies made by Japanese immigrants to the United States in the late 19th or early 20th century. The Japanese version did not have the Chinese lucky numbers and were eaten with tea.\nEtymology.\nThere is no single accepted Chinese name for the cookies, with a large variety of translations being used to describe them in the Chinese, all of which being more-or-less literal translations of the English \"fortune cookie\". Examples include: \u5e78\u8fd0\u7c64\u997c \"x\u00ecngy\u00f9n qi\u0101n b\u01d0ng\" \"good luck lot cookie\", \u7c64\u8bed\u997c \"qi\u0101n y\u01d4 b\u01d0ng\" \"fortune words cookie\", \u5e78\u8fd0\u997c \"x\u00ecngy\u00f9n b\u01d0ng\" \"good luck cookie\", \u5e78\u8fd0\u7c64\u8bed\u997c \"x\u00ecngy\u00f9n qi\u0101n y\u01d4 b\u01d0ng\" \"lucky fortune words cookie\", \u5e78\u8fd0\u751c\u997c \"x\u00ecngy\u00f9n ti\u00e1n b\u01d0ng\" \"good luck sweet cookie\", \u5e78\u798f\u997c\u5e72 \"x\u00ecngf\u00fa b\u01d0ngg\u0101n\" \"good luck biscuit\", or \u5360\u535c\u997c \"zh\u0101nb\u01d4 b\u01d0ng\" \"divining cookie\".\nHistory.\nAs far back as the 19th century, a cookie very similar in appearance to the modern fortune cookie was made in Kyoto, Japan, and there is a Japanese temple tradition of random fortunes, called omikuji. The Japanese version of the cookie differs in several ways: they are a little bit larger; are made of darker dough; and their batter contains sesame and miso. They contain a fortune; however, the small slip of paper was wedged into the bend of the cookie rather than placed inside the hollow portion. This kind of cookie is called and is still sold in some regions of Japan, especially in Kanazawa, Ishikawa. It is also sold in the neighborhood of Fushimi Inari-taisha shrine in Kyoto.\nMakoto Hagiwara of Golden Gate Park's Japanese Tea Garden in San Francisco is reported to have been the first person in the U.S. to have served the modern version of the cookie when he did so at the tea garden in the early 1900s. The fortune cookies were made by a San Francisco bakery, Benkyodo.\nDavid Jung, founder of the Hong Kong Noodle Company in Los Angeles, made a competing claim that he invented the cookie in 1918. San Francisco's Court of Historical Review attempted to settle the dispute in 1983. During the proceedings, a fortune cookie was introduced as a piece of evidence with a message reading, \"S.F. Judge who rules for L.A. Not Very Smart Cookie\". A federal judge of the Court of Historical Review, from San Francisco themselves, determined that the cookie originated with Hagiwara and the court ruled in favor of San Francisco. Subsequently, the city of Los Angeles condemned the decision.\nSeiichi Kito, the founder of Fugetsu-do of Little Tokyo in Los Angeles, also claims to have invented the cookie. Kito claims to have gotten the idea of putting a message in a cookie from Omikuji (fortune slip) which are sold at temples and shrines in Japan. According to his story, he sold his cookies to Chinese restaurants where they were greeted with much enthusiasm in both the Los Angeles and San Francisco areas, before spreading.\nUp to around World War II, fortune cookies were known as \"fortune tea cakes\"\u2014likely reflecting their origins in Japanese tea cakes.\nFortune cookies moved from being a confection dominated by Japanese-Americans to one dominated by Chinese-Americans sometime around World War II. One theory for why this occurred is because of the Japanese American internment during World War II, which forcibly put over 100,000 Japanese-Americans in internment camps, including those who had produced fortune cookies. This gave an opportunity for Chinese manufacturers.\nFortune cookies before the early 20th century were all made by hand. They are made from a simple batter of sugar, flour, water, and eggs. When heated, the dough stays flexible, allowing it to be shaped. As it cools, the sugar crystallizes, creating a crisp, glossy cookie. Traditionally, bakers would bake 3-inch circles of dough, insert a fortune while still warm, and use chopsticks to fold the cookie into its iconic shape before it hardened. The fortune cookie industry changed dramatically after the fortune cookie machine was invented by Edward Louie in the late 1960s. The machine allowed for mass production of fortune cookies which subsequently allowed the cookies to drop in price to become the novelty and courtesy dessert many Americans are familiar with after their meals at most Chinese restaurants today.\nManufacturers.\nThere are approximately 3 billion fortune cookies made each year globally, the majority of them consumed in the US. The largest manufacturer of the cookies is Wonton Food, Inc., headquartered in Brooklyn, New York. They make over 4.5 million fortune cookies per day. Other large manufacturers are Baily International in the Midwest and Peking Noodle in Los Angeles. There are other smaller, local manufacturers including Tsue Chong Co. in Seattle, Keefer Court Food in Minneapolis, Sunrise Fortune Cookie in Philadelphia, and Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Factory in San Francisco. Many smaller companies will also sell custom fortunes.\nManufacturing processes vary, but they generally follow the same procedure. The ingredients (typically made with a base of flour, sugar, vanilla, and sesame seed oil) are mixed in a large tank and squirted onto fast moving trays. These function like a conveyor belt and are heated to cook the dough. Cookies are compressed with round hot plates to shape and cook them. The cookies bake for approximately one minute and are reshaped. They can be mechanically shaped or folded by hand. When automated, a machine folds the cookie into the correct orientation with the fortune inside. Cooled and hardened cookies are sealed in plastic wrappers, which are inspected before being shipped. Today, most cookies are produced in the United States.\nMarketing.\nThe message inside may include a list of lucky numbers used by some as lottery numbers; since relatively few distinct messages are printed, in the recorded case where winning numbers happened to be printed, the lottery had an unexpectedly high number of winners sharing a prize. Authorities briefly investigated Wonton Food in 2005, after 110 Powerball lottery players won about $19 million after using the \"lucky numbers\" on the back of fortunes.\nFortune cookies are sometimes used for special marketing promotions. For example, the film \"Kung Fu Panda 3\" was promoted by putting quotations from the protagonist of the film on fortune cookie slips.\nIn 1989, fortune cookies were reportedly imported into Hong Kong and sold as \"genuine American fortune cookies\". Wonton Food attempted to expand its fortune cookie business into China in 1992, but gave up after fortune cookies were considered \"too American\".\nNutrition.\nCookies from different manufacturers have different ingredients and nutritional content. One cookie typically contains around of food energy and 5\u20137 g of total carbohydrates. A cookie may have sugar varying from 0\u20133 g, between 2\u20138\u00a0mg of sodium, and may have significant (compared to their size) amounts of iron or protein. The small size means they have little overall nutritional value.\nAround the world.\nFortune cookies, while largely an American item, have been served in Chinese restaurants in Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, India, Italy, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United Arab Emirates, among others. \nThere are also multi-cultural versions of the fortune cookie. For instance, the Mexican version of the fortune cookie, called the \"Lucky Taco\", is a red taco-shaped cookie with a fortune inside. The same company that makes the Lucky Taco also makes a \"Lucky Cannoli\", inspired by Italian cannolis.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The name \"candiru\" is also used to refer to other catfish species, including the entire genus \"Vandellia\".\nThis species is known for an alleged tendency to invade and parasitize the human urethra and other bodily openings; however, despite ethnological reports dating back to the late 19th century, the first documented case of the removal of a candiru from a human urethra did not occur until 1997, and even that incident has remained a matter of controversy. Scientifically, this fish only parasitizes larger fish which it shares its habitat with; it consumes their host's blood from their gill openings, thus the candiru is a hematophagic species.\nDiscovery.\n\"Vandellia cirrhosa\" was discovered in the early 1800s by Alexandre Rodrigues Ferreira, a Native Brazilian scholar studying under the Italian naturalist Professor Domingos Vandelli, of which the fish would be named after. The Spanish name \"ca\u00f1ero\" is a derivative of \"carnero\", meaning flesh-eater.\nTaxonomy.\nCandiru belong to the family Trichomycteridae, which is monophyletic and contains 207 species. The taxonomic placement of this fish has long been debated, with the first proposed phylogenetic relationships of Trichomycteridae being proposed by Jonathan N. Baskin in 1973. Most proposed phylogenies have relied on morphological data, often placing \"Vandellinae\" and \"Stegophilinae\" as sister taxa among the subfamilies. A study conducted by Luis Fern\u00e1ndez and Scott A. Schaefer, published in 2009, used DNA sequence data to create the first comprehensive treatment of phylogenetic relationships of trichomycterid catfish. Relationships among \"Vandelliinae\" were strongly supported, and \"Vandellia\" was found to be the sister group of \"Plectrochilus\". The results of Fern\u00e1ndez and Schaefer were fully congruent with previous statements based on morphological data. Nonetheless, the taxonomy of the Vandellia genus is still incomplete and hindered by the fact that several species within the genus have often been attributed the same name.\nDescription.\n\"Vandellia cirrhosa\" is a small, freshwater catfish. Members of the genus \"Vandellia\" can reach up to in standard length, but some others can grow to around . The fish has an elongated body with an anterior dorsal fin and pelvic fin, and an anal fin slightly larger than the dorsal fin. The caudal fin is fairly small with a truncated shape. Each has a rather small head and a belly that can appear distended, especially after a large blood meal. The body is translucent, making it quite difficult to spot in the turbid waters of its home. Blood is often visible through the translucent body after feeding. The fish has small eyes with yellow irises. There are short sensory barbels around the head, together with short, backward pointing spines on the gill covers. These spines have been described as popping out in an umbrella-like fashion, which could be used to help lodge the fish into its host.\nAll members of the subfamily Vandelliinae share the traits of blood parasitism, with parasitism in general being a shared ancestral trait of all members of Trichomycteridae. They have individual claw-like teeth for this purpose. Their bodies are very small and elongated to easily slip into the gills of host fish.\nHabitat and distribution.\nCandiru inhabits the Amazon and Orinoco basins of lowland Amazonia.\nThis fish lives in shallow water with muddy, sandy, or rocky bottoms. It can be found in riffles. Its distribution is patchy and it does not seem to move very far from its spawning sites.\nOne location that \"Vandellia cirrhosa\" is specifically known to inhabit is the Purus River of Brazil. This location is hard to study due to its geographic isolation, something that is common among the habitats of candiru.\nDiet.\nCandiru is hematophagous and parasitizes the gills of larger Amazonian fish, especially catfish of the family Pimelodidae (Siluriformes) and members of the family Characidae. However, it has been known to parasitize many species in the same location, suggesting that its feeding habit is based more on availability than species preference. Vandellinae is one of only two groups of jawed vertebrates that exclusively feed on blood.\nThe feeding mechanism of the candiru was not understood until fairly recently, but many theories had been proposed before. Some suggested that it uses its sharp teeth to latch onto an artery or vein and stays attached to the host until it has ingested enough blood. It then lets go of the host and continues swimming. Others suggested that it extracts blood from its hosts by latching onto the gill filaments, which bleed freely into the alimentary tract of the candiru. In one experiment involving \"Vandellia cirrhosa\", no evidence of gill damage was found on the fish hosts. Thus, the experimenter suggested a hypothetical blood-pumping mechanism in which the candiru is able to quickly ingest large amounts of blood without permanently damaging the host.\nModern experiments have shown that the candiru feeds by approaching a host fish and swimming alongside it until close to the gill cover. It then attempts to penetrate the gill chamber by forcing itself underneath. The candiru has also been seen entering the host through its mouth, though this behavior seems to be rare. While latched onto the host fish's gill chamber with sharp teeth, the candiru goes limp and quickly swells up with blood. The gut of this species is a straight tube with loosely-spaced fibers lining the walls of the connective tissue, most likely facilitating the swelling of the belly that is associated with the candiru. The lack of any protrusible jaw supports the theory that this species does not suck blood, but rather bites into a blood vessel and ingests the fluid that flows freely into the mouth. Because the candiru relies on the blood pressure of the host to ingest blood from the ventral or dorsal arteries, host fish must be selected by size.\nThe time taken to get its fill of blood depends on the size of the candiru and whether it has attached to a large or small blood vessel. Because of the small size of \"Vandellia cirrhosa\", it generally seems to take no more than two minutes to ingest the required amount of blood from the host fish. This short duration is theoretically beneficial to the candiru because it is only vulnerable to predators for a short period of time.\nIn most cases, the host fish do not seem to be badly wounded by this process. There is generally no observable damage to the gill filaments. However, relatively deep crescent or elliptical-shaped wounds with coagulated blood inside can be found beneath the gill cover.\nWhen starving, the candiru may resort to entering unusual orifices such as the nostril of a host fish. This behavior may relate to reported cases of these fish penetrating human orifices such as the urethra.\nRelation to humans.\nAlleged attacks.\nAlthough lurid anecdotes of attacks on humans abound, only one somewhat questionable case has evidence behind it, and some alleged traits of the fish have been discredited as myth or superstition. It is likely that, while the fish's spines can cause physical trauma, \nConservation status.\nThe remote habitat of the candiru, as well as the indigenous cultural customs surrounding its location, makes it difficult to study. The number of \"Vandellia cirrhosa\" in the wild is unknown, but there are no conservation efforts in place to protect these fish.\nOne of its main habitats, the Purus River, is currently the main source of fish for human consumption in the most populous city of the Central Amazon, Manaus. This creates a huge pressure on fish stocks, which may be indirectly affecting the candiru by depleting its population of potential host fish.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

After the war ended, Forrest was elected to lead the Reconstruction-era Ku Klux Klan as its first and only Grand Wizard, though not a founding member, serving almost two years from the 1867 inception of his title, until his order to dissolve the organization in January 1869.\nBefore the Civil War, Forrest amassed substantial wealth as a horse and cattle trader, real estate broker, slave jail operator, interstate slave trader, and cotton plantation owner. In June 1861, shortly after the Civil War began with the splitting of the United States into the Union and the Confederacy, Forrest enlisted in the Confederate Army. Forrest became one of the few soldiers during the war to enlist as a private and be promoted to general without previous military training. An expert cavalry leader, Forrest was given command of a cavalry corps and established new doctrines for mobile forces, earning him the nickname \"The Wizard of the Saddle\". He used his cavalry troops as mounted infantry and often deployed artillery as the lead in battle, thus helping to \"revolutionize cavalry tactics\".\nIn April 1864, in what has been called \"one of the bleakest, saddest events of American military history\", troops under Forrest's command at the Battle of Fort Pillow massacred hundreds of surrendered Union Army troops, free blacks and Tennessean Southern Unionists. The slaughter, which is perhaps the most infamous application of the Confederate no-quarter policy for black combatants, was blamed on Forrest in many newspapers in the North, and the stories of the killings may have strengthened the Union's resolve to win the war. Forrest's level of responsibility for the massacre is still widely debated by historians.\nForrest joined the Ku Klux Klan in 1867, two years after the organization's founding, and was elected its first Grand Wizard. The group was a secretive network of dens across the post-war South, where politically active black people and their allies were threatened, assaulted and murdered. The Klan, with Forrest at the lead, suppressed the voting rights of blacks through violence and intimidation during the elections of 1868. In 1869, Forrest expressed disillusionment with the terrorist group's lack of discipline, and issued a letter ordering the dissolution of the Ku Klux Klan as well as the destruction of its costumes; he then withdrew from the organization. Forrest later denied being a Klan member, and in the 1870s twice made statements in support of racial harmony and black dignity. During the last years of his life, he served on the board of a railroad and farmed President's Island using convict labor. Forrest died of illness in 1877, at the age of 56.\nEarly life and career.\nNathan Bedford Forrest was born July 13, 1821 to Miriam (Beck) and William Forrest, a poor settler family living in a secluded frontier cabin near the hamlet of Chapel Hill, Tennessee (then part of Bedford County, but now in Marshall County).\nHis father was of English descent, and while most of Nathan's biographers state that his mother was of Scotch-Irish descent, the Memphis Genealogical Society asserts that she, too, was of English descent.\nHe and his twin sister, Fanny, were the two eldest of 12 children. Their great-grandfather, Shadrach Forrest, moved between 1730 and 1740 from Virginia to North Carolina, where both his son (Bedford's grandfather) and grandson (Bedford's father) were born; they moved to Tennessee in 1806 and he died in Bedford, Tennessee the year before Nathan Bedford was born. Forrest's family lived in a log house (now preserved as the Nathan Bedford Forrest Boyhood Home) from 1830 to 1833. John Allan Wyeth, who served in an Alabama regiment under Forrest, described it as a one-room building with a loft and no windows.\nWilliam Forrest continued blacksmithing in Tennessee until 1834, when the family moved to Salem, Mississippi. When his father died in 1837, Nathan became the primary caretaker of the family at age 16. Forrest ventured into a business partnership with his uncle Jonathan Forrest in Hernando, Mississippi in 1841. His uncle was subsequently killed at the business in 1845 by the Matlock brothers during an argument. In retaliation, Bedford shot and killed two of them with his two-shot pistol and wounded two others with a borrowed knife thrown to him. One brother later served under Forrest's command, for a time, during the Civil War. Forrest's early business ventures included a livery stable, a stagecoach line, and a brickyard. He became well known as a Memphis speculator and Mississippi gambler.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Image flip/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn 1858, Forrest was elected a Memphis city alderman as a Southern Democrat and served two consecutive terms. He purchased two large cotton plantations in Coahoma County, Mississippi and bought a one-half property interest in an Arkansas plantation in 1859; by October 1860, he owned at least 3,345 acres in Mississippi. He acquired several cotton plantations in the Delta region of West Tennessee. By the time the American Civil War started in 1861, he had become one of the wealthiest men in the Southern United States, having amassed a \"personal fortune that he claimed was worth $1.5 million\".\nForrest stood in height, weighed about , rarely drank and abstained from tobacco use. He was known as a tireless rider in the saddle and a skilled swordsman. Forrest was noted as having a \"striking and commanding presence\" by U.S. Army Captain Lewis Hosea, an aide to Gen. James H. Wilson. He was often described as generally mild-mannered, but according to Hosea and other contemporaries who knew him, his demeanor changed drastically when provoked or angered. Although he was not formally educated, according to Spaulding, Forrest was able to read and write clear and grammatical English, although he was a poor speller. He was initiated into Freemasonry, but did not progress beyond the Entered Apprentice degree.\nMarriage and family.\nForrest had twelve brothers and sisters; two of his eight brothers and three of his four sisters died of typhoid fever at an early age, all at about the same time. He also contracted the disease, but survived; his father recovered but died from residual effects of the disease five years later when Bedford was 16. His mother, Miriam, then married James Horatio Luxton, of Marshall, Texas, in 1843 and gave birth to four more children. All of Forrest's younger brothers\u2014in order, John N. Forrest, William H. Forrest, Aaron H. Forrest, Jesse A. Forrest, and Jeffrey E. Forrest\u2014worked as slave traders with Bedford before the war. All but John, who was a disabled veteran of the Mexican\u2013American War, served as Confederate military officers in Tennessee and Mississippi during the American Civil War. Forrest's son William M. Forrest served as his aide-de-camp, and his half-brother Mat Luxton was a sergeant and scout in his cavalry.\nIn 1845, Forrest married Mary Ann Montgomery (1826\u20131893), the niece of a Presbyterian minister who was her legal guardian. They had two children, William Montgomery Bedford Forrest (1846\u20131908), who enlisted at the age of 15 and served alongside his father in the war, and a daughter, Fanny (1849\u20131854), who died in childhood. There are also reports dating to 1864 that Forrest had two children, Thomas and Narcissa, with an enslaved woman named Catharine.\nForrest's grandson, Nathan Bedford Forrest II (1872\u20131931), became commander-in-chief of the Sons of Confederate Veterans and a Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan in Georgia and secretary of the national organization. His granddaughter, Mary Forrest Bradley, served as president of the Tennessee Division of the United Daughters of the Confederacy. A great-grandson, Nathan Bedford Forrest III (1905\u20131943), graduated from West Point and rose to the rank of brigadier general in the U.S. Army Air Corps; he was killed during a bombing raid over Nazi Germany in 1943, becoming the first American general to die in combat in the European theater during World War II.\nSlave trading.\nNathan Bedford Forrest\u2014disparaged by Parson Brownlow in 1864 as a \"sin-hardened negro trader, and livery stable man of Memphis\"\u2014was a notable slave trader of the United States from 1851 to 1860. Forrest was considered one of the \"big four\" \"phenomenally large\" traders of Memphis, which was the \"first-class market\" for slave trading in Tennessee. He is believed to have sold thousands of slaves during his career and had profits of hundreds of thousands of dollars in 1850s currency. Primarily based in Memphis, he was able to open a second storefront in Vicksburg in 1858. During the American Civil War, Forrest cited his business experience in a written request for an independent command: \"I have resided on the Mississippi for over twenty years, was for many years engaged in buying and selling negroes, and know the country perfectly well between Memphis and Vicksburg, and also am well acquainted with all the prominent planters in that region, as well as above Memphis.\"\nAfter initially working as an independent slave trader, he was first in partnership with Seaborne S. Jones, second in partnership with Byrd Hill (a more experienced manager of negro marts), third in partnership with Josiah Maples, then again a sole proprietor, and finally reunited with Jones.\nBeginning in the Forrest &amp; Maples era, his business was headquartered at 87 Adams Street in Memphis, where several other slave traders had their slave pens and auction yards, thus making the area an efficient business cluster. After the war, a woman named Nellie Harbold placed a family reunification ad hoping to find her children, Lydia, Miley A., and Samuel Tirley, all of whom had been sold to separate buyers out of \"the yard of Forrest the Trader\" in Memphis in 1854. Forrest was traditionally said to have been trained by the principals of Bolton, Dickens &amp; Co., a multimillion-dollar operation that traded in a dozen Southern cities, but recent research suggests this may be apocryphal. After the completion of the Memphis and Charleston Railroad in 1857, Forrest began moving slaves by rail from South Carolina, including a carpenter named Richard and a man named Bent, both of whom promptly ran away from their new owners in Tennessee. In 1859, media coverage of Forrest's business spotlighted a particular servant for sale, an enslaved girl said to be the daughter of Frederick Douglass and being advertised as a \"likely girl\". Historian Tim Huebner asserts this was likely Anna Marie Bailey, a niece of Douglass.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Among the servants offered for sale by a Mr. Forrest of Memphis, Tenn., is a girl who is known to be the daughter of the notorious Fred Douglass, the \"free-nigger\" Abolitionist.\u2014She is said to be of the class known among the dealers as a \"likely girl,\" and is a native of North Carolina.\u2014She remembers her \"parient\" very vividly, having seen him during his last visit to the Old North State. The \"Memphis Avalanche\" suggests that as Fred is ample able to make the outlay he should either purchase his own flesh and blood from servitude, or cease his shrieks over an institution which possesses such untold horrors.\u2014\u200a\nIn 1859, a federal investigation found that Forrest also sold 37 individuals illegally imported to the United States from Africa on the slave ship \"Wanderer\". Forrest, who advocated for the reopening of the transatlantic slave trade, later told an interviewer that he had been an initial investor in the \"Wanderer\" shipment. In January 1860, the \"New York Times\" reported that the Forrest, Jones &amp; Co. negro mart building in Memphis had both collapsed and then caught fire; two people died. The firm's bills of sale for people, \"amounting in the aggregate to US$\" were salvaged. Forrest had recently moved from 87 Adams to 89 Adams, which allowed him to increase his holding capacity from a maximum of 300 slaves to a maximum of 500. Forrest subsequently sold his interest in the business after the building catastrophe and reinvested the profit into plantations. A marker was erected at the former site of Forrest's slave mart in downtown Memphis, on land currently owned by Calvary Episcopal Church, and was dedicated on April 4, 2018.\nAmerican Civil War.\nEarly cavalry command.\nAfter the Civil War broke out, Forrest returned to Tennessee from his Mississippi ventures and enlisted in the Confederate States Army (CSA) on June 14, 1861. He reported for training at Fort Wright near Randolph, Tennessee, joining Captain Josiah White's cavalry Company E, nicknamed \"the Tennessee Mounted Rifles\" of the 7th Tennessee Cavalry Regiment, as a private along with his youngest brother, Jesse A. Forrest, and 15-year-old son, William Montgomery Forrest. Upon seeing how badly equipped the CSA was, Forrest offered to buy horses and equipment with his own money for a regiment of Tennessee volunteer soldiers.\nHis superior officers and Governor of Tennessee Isham G. Harris were surprised that someone of Forrest's wealth and prominence had enlisted as a soldier, especially since significant planters were exempted from service. They commissioned him as a lieutenant colonel and authorized him to recruit and train a battalion of Confederate mounted rangers. In October 1861, Forrest was given command of a regiment, the 3rd Tennessee Cavalry. Though Forrest had no prior formal military training or experience, he had exhibited leadership and soon proved he could successfully employ military tactics.\nForrest gained a reputation for his willingness to maintain discipline through the use of physical force. When the information with which a scout returned proved to be erroneous, Forrest struck the man's head against a tree. After a lieutenant refused to join his troops in a river where they were building a bridge, Forrest pushed him into the water. A soldier who refused to paddle across the Tennessee River was hit with an oar by his general. Two others who fled from a rout were beaten with a branch, and Forrest shot the one who had borne the colors. Along with brutal treatment of his prisoners, this led many soldiers and junior officers to refuse to serve under him.\nPublic debate surrounded Tennessee's decision to join the Confederacy, and both the Confederate and United States armies recruited soldiers from the state. Over 100,000 men from Tennessee served with the Confederacy, and over 31,000 served with the U.S. Army. Forrest posted advertisements to join his regiment, with the slogan, \"Let's have some fun and kill some Yankees!\". Forrest's command included his Escort Company (his \"Special Forces\"), for which he selected the best soldiers available. This unit, which varied in size from 40 to 90 men, constituted the elite of his cavalry.\nSacramento and Fort Donelson.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Image flip/styles.css\" /&gt;\nForrest won praise for his performance under fire during an early victory in the Battle of Sacramento in Kentucky, the first in which he commanded troops in the field, where he routed a U.S. Army force by personally leading a cavalry charge that Brigadier General Charles Clark later commended. Forrest distinguished himself further at the Battle of Fort Donelson in February 1862. After his cavalry captured a U.S. artillery battery, he broke out of a siege headed by Major General Ulysses S. Grant, rallying nearly 4,000 troops and leading them to escape across the Cumberland River.\nA few days after the Confederate surrender of Fort Donelson, with the fall of Nashville to U.S. forces imminent, Forrest took command of the city. All available carts and wagons were pressed into service to haul 600 boxes of army clothing, 250,000 pounds of bacon, and 40 wagon-loads of ammunition to the railroad depots, to be sent off to Chattanooga and Decatur. Forrest arranged for heavy ordnance machinery, including a new cannon rifling machine and 14 cannons, as well as parts from the Nashville Armory, to be sent to Atlanta for use by the Confederate Army.\nShiloh and Murfreesboro.\nA month later, Forrest was back in action at the Battle of Shiloh, fought April 6\u20137, 1862. After the U.S. victory, Forrest commanded a Confederate rear guard. In the battle of Fallen Timbers, he drove through the U.S. skirmish line. Not realizing that the rest of his men had halted their charge when they reached the full U.S. brigade, Forrest charged the brigade alone and soon found himself surrounded. He emptied his Colt Army revolvers into the swirling mass of U.S. Army soldiers and pulled out his saber, hacking, and slashing. A U.S. infantryman on the ground beside Forrest fired a musket ball at him with a point-blank shot, nearly knocking him out of the saddle. The ball went through Forrest's pelvis and lodged near his spine. A surgeon removed the musket ball a week later without anesthesia, which was unavailable.\nBy early summer, Forrest commanded a new brigade of inexperienced cavalry regiments. He led them into Middle Tennessee in July under orders to launch a cavalry raid. On July 13, 1862, he led them into the First Battle of Murfreesboro, as a result of which all of the U.S. units surrendered to Forrest. The Confederates destroyed much of the U.S. Army's supplies and railroad tracks in the area.\nWest Tennessee raids.\nPromoted on July 21, 1862, to brigadier general, Forrest was given command of a Confederate cavalry brigade. At this time, Forrest's cavalry operations were directed under Major General Earl Van Dorn, who commanded Confederate forces in the region. Forrest served as Van Dorn's cavalry leader during a series of raids designed to disrupt Union advances, including operations leading up to the successful Holly Springs Raid, a surprise attack orchestrated by Van Dorn that destroyed Union supply lines and forced Grant to temporarily halt his Vicksburg campaign \u2014 an outcome that preserved the South's access to major ports and kept Confederate hopes alive at a critical moment in the war. In March 1863, Forrest and Van Dorn worked together again to deliver another decisive Confederate victory at the Battle of Thompson's Station, capturing over 1,200 Union troops and halting Federal momentum in central Tennessee. These experiences significantly influenced Forrest's evolving approach to mobile warfare. In December 1862, Forrest's veteran troopers were reassigned by General Braxton Bragg to another officer despite his protest. Forrest had to recruit a new brigade of about 2,000 inexperienced men, most of whom lacked weapons. Again, Bragg ordered a series of raids to disrupt the communications of the U.S. Army forces under Grant, which were threatening the city of Vicksburg, Mississippi. Forrest protested that sending such untrained men behind enemy lines was suicidal, but Bragg insisted, and Forrest obeyed his orders. In the ensuing raids, he was pursued by thousands of U.S. soldiers trying to locate his fast-moving forces. Avoiding attack by never staying in one place long, Forrest eventually led his troops during the spring and summer of 1864 on raids into west Tennessee, as far north as the banks of the Ohio River in southwest Kentucky and into north Mississippi.\nForrest returned to his base in Mississippi with more men than he had started with. By then, all were fully armed with captured U.S. Army weapons. As a result, Grant was forced to revise and delay his Vicksburg campaign strategy. Newspaper correspondent Sylvanus Cadwallader, who traveled with Grant for three years during his campaigns, wrote that Forrest \"was the only Confederate cavalryman of whom Grant stood in much dread\".\nDover, Brentwood, and Chattanooga.\nThe U.S. Army gained military control of Tennessee in 1862 and occupied it for the duration of the war, having taken control of strategic cities and railroads. Forrest continued to lead his men in small-scale operations, including the Battle of Dover and the Battle of Brentwood until April 1863. The Confederate army dispatched him with a small force into the backcountry of northern Alabama and western Georgia to defend against an attack of 3,000 U.S. Army cavalrymen commanded by Colonel Abel Streight. Streight had orders to cut the Confederate railroad south of Chattanooga, Tennessee, to seal off Bragg's supply line and force him to retreat into Georgia. Forrest chased Streight's men for 16 days, harassing them all the way. Streight's goal changed from dismantling the railroad to escaping the pursuit. On May 3, Forrest caught up with Streight's unit east of Cedar Bluff, Alabama. Forrest had fewer men than the U.S. side but feigned having a larger force by repeatedly parading some around a hilltop until Streight was convinced to surrender his 1,500 or so exhausted troops (historians Kevin Dougherty and Keith S. Hebert say he had about 1,700 men).\nDay's Gap, Chickamauga, and Paducah.\nNot all of Forrest's exploits of individual combat involved enemy troops. Lieutenant Andrew Wills Gould, an artillery officer in Forrest's command, was being transferred, presumably because cannons under his command were spiked (disabled) by the enemy during the Battle of Day's Gap. On June 13, 1863, Gould confronted Forrest about his transfer, which escalated into a violent exchange. Gould shot Forrest in the left side, and Forrest mortally stabbed Gould. Forrest was thought to have been fatally wounded by Gould, but he recovered and was ready to fight in the Chickamauga Campaign.\nForrest served with the main army at the Battle of Chickamauga on September 18\u201320, 1863, in which he pursued the retreating U.S. Army and took hundreds of prisoners. Like several others under Bragg's command, he urged an immediate follow-up attack to recapture Chattanooga, which had fallen a few weeks before. Bragg failed to do so, upon which Forrest was quoted as saying, \"What does he fight battles for?\"\nForrest (along with other subordinates of Bragg) was not blameless for the disorganization that had led Bragg to decide against pursuit after the Chickamauga victory. He and Wheeler had regularly failed throughout the entire Chattanooga campaign to gather intelligence on the disposition of Union forces, in Forrest's case because he often involved himself in the thick of battles where he could not gather this information. Forrest also failed tactically on the first day of battle, moving his troops north up the creek in response to a perceived threat instead of screening the Confederate advance as he had been ordered to. As a result, the time it took the infantry to fight for the crossings at Alexander's and Reed's bridges allowed General William Rosecrans to shore up his Union defenses in the area. That night, Forrest again declined to screen the army's right flank; if he had he would have found a wide gap in the Union lines, a misstep that has been called \"the most significant intelligence oversight of the entire battle\" as it left Bragg utterly uninformed about Union dispositions even as he planned a counterattack. The next morning a poorly planned attack Forrest initiated in that area led to heavy casualties and delayed the counterattack.\nIn an attempt to build a foothold to retake Chattanooga, Bragg ordered Forrest and Wheeler north after the battle in order that they might disrupt Rosecrans's fragile supply line from Nashville. But Forrest diverted to Knoxville, allowing Rosecrans to consolidate his hold on the city, leading Bragg to describe Forrest as \"nothing more than a good raider\" as he signed orders to transfer Forrest out of his command, to western Tennessee, a month or so later. This supposedly led to a meeting where Forrest confronted and threatened Bragg's life, calling him a coward and saying \"you might as well not give me any orders, for I will not obey them\", one of several instances in his career where Forrest was openly insubordinate to his superior officers. It is now considered to be apocryphal, although it was repeated in biographies published with Forrest's approval, suggesting it reflected his assessment of Bragg.\nOn December 4, 1863, Forrest was promoted to the rank of major general. On March 25, 1864, Forrest's cavalry raided the town of Paducah, Kentucky, in the Battle of Paducah, during which Forrest demanded the surrender of U.S. Colonel Stephen G. Hicks: \"if I have to storm your works, you may expect no quarter.\" Hicks refused to comply with the ultimatum, and according to his subsequent report, Forrest's troops took a position and set up a battery of guns while a flag of truce was still up. As soon as they received the U.S. reply, they moved forward at the command of a junior officer, and the U.S. forces opened fire. The Confederates tried to storm the fort but were repulsed; they rallied and made two more attempts, both of which failed.\nFort Pillow massacre.\nFort Pillow, located upriver from Memphis (near Henning, Tennessee), was initially constructed by Confederate forces under General Gideon Johnson Pillow on the bluffs of the Mississippi River, and taken over by U.S. forces in 1862 after the Confederates had abandoned the fort. The fort was defended by 557 U.S. Army troops, 295 white and 262 black, under U.S. Army Maj. L.F. Booth.\nOn April 12, 1864, Forrest's men, under Brigadier General James R. Chalmers, attacked and recaptured Fort Pillow. Booth and his adjutant were killed in the battle, leaving Fort Pillow under the command of Major William Bradford. Forrest had reached the fort at 10 a.m. after a hard ride from Mississippi, during which two horses were shot out from under him. By 3:30\u00a0p.m., Forrest had concluded that the U.S. troops could not hold the fort; thus, he ordered a flag of truce raised and demanded that the fort be surrendered. As he often did to avoid the high casualties that came with having to storm fortifications, Forrest warned Bradford that he could not be held responsible for what his men might do in the heat of such a battle. Bradford refused to surrender, believing his troops could escape to the U.S. Navy gunboat, USS \"New Era\", on the Mississippi River. Forrest's men immediately took over the fort, while U.S. Army soldiers retreated to the lower bluffs of the river, but the gunboat did not come to their rescue.\nWhat happened next became known as the Fort Pillow Massacre. As the U.S. Army troops surrendered, Forrest's men opened fire, slaughtering black and white U.S. Army soldiers. According to historians John Cimprich and Bruce Tap, although their numbers were roughly equal, two-thirds of the black U.S. Army soldiers were killed, while only a third of the whites were killed. The atrocities at Fort Pillow continued throughout the night. Conflicting accounts of what occurred were given later.\nForrest's Confederate forces were accused of subjecting captured U.S. Army soldiers to extreme brutality, with allegations of back-shooting soldiers who fled into the river, shooting wounded soldiers, burning men alive, nailing men to barrels and igniting them, crucifixion, and hacking men to death with sabers. Forrest's men were alleged to have set fire to a U.S. barracks with wounded U.S. Army soldiers inside. In defense of their actions, Forrest's men insisted that the U.S. soldiers, although fleeing, kept their weapons and frequently turned to shoot, forcing the Confederates to keep firing in self-defense. The rebels said the U.S. flag was still flying over the fort, which indicated that the force had not formally surrendered. A contemporary newspaper account from Jackson, Tennessee, stated that \"General Forrest begged them to surrender\", but \"not the first sign of surrender was ever given\". Similar accounts were reported in many Confederate newspapers at the time. These statements were contradicted by U.S. Army survivors and by the letter of Achilles Clark, a Confederate soldier with the 20th Tennessee Cavalry who graphically recounted a massacre. Clark wrote to his sisters immediately after the battle:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFollowing the cessation of hostilities, Forrest transferred the 14 most seriously wounded United States Colored Troops (USCT) to the U.S. steamer \"Silver Cloud\". The 226 U.S. Army troops taken prisoner at Fort Pillow were marched under guard to Holly Springs, Mississippi, and then convoyed to Demopolis, Alabama. On April 21, Capt. John Goodwin, of Forrest's cavalry command, forwarded a dispatch listing the prisoners captured. The list included the names of 7 officers and 219 white enlisted soldiers. According to Richard L. Fuchs, \"records concerning the fate of the black prisoners are either nonexistent or unreliable\". President Abraham Lincoln asked his cabinet for opinions as to how the United States should respond to the massacre.\nAt the time of the massacre, General Grant was no longer in Tennessee but had transferred to the east to command all U.S. troops. Grant wrote in his memoirs that Forrest, in his report of the battle, had \"left out the part which shocks humanity to read\".\nBecause of the events at Fort Pillow, the U.S. public and press viewed Forrest as a war criminal. A Knoxville correspondent for the \"New York Tribune\" wrote that Forrest and his brothers were \"slave drivers and woman whippers\", while Forrest himself was described as \"mean, vindictive, cruel, and unscrupulous\". The Confederate press steadfastly defended Forrest's reputation.\nAccording to a historian studying in the Cumberland River valley during the Civil War, \"Fully aware of the significance of the large-scale recruitment of black troops, the Confederates did what they could to disrupt it...Forrest himself, operating in west Tennessee, chose to interpret his stunning victory over a racially mixed garrison at Fort Pillow in April as, in part, a warning about using black troops. He described the battle graphically, recounted exaggerated Union casualty figures, and noted, 'It is hoped that these facts will demonstrate to the Northern people that negro soldiers cannot cope with the Southerners.'\"\nS.C. Gwynne writes, \"Forrest's responsibility for the massacre has been actively debated for a century and a half. ... No direct evidence suggests that he ordered the shooting of surrendering or unarmed men, but to fully exonerate him from responsibility is also impossible\".\nBrices Cross Roads and Tupelo.\nForrest's most decisive victory came on June 10, 1864, when his 3,500-man force clashed with 8,500 men commanded by U.S. Army Brig. Gen. Samuel D. Sturgis at the Battle of Brices Crossroads in northeastern Mississippi. Here, the mobility of the troops under his command and his superior tactics led to victory, allowing him to continue harassing U.S. forces in southwestern Tennessee and northern Mississippi throughout the war. Forrest set up a position for an attack to repulse a pursuing force commanded by Sturgis, who had been sent to impede Forrest from destroying U.S. Army supply lines and fortifications. When Sturgis's Federal army came upon the crossroads, they collided with Forrest's cavalry. Sturgis ordered his infantry to advance to the front line to counteract the cavalry. The infantry, tired, weary, and suffering under the heat, were quickly broken and sent into mass retreat. Forrest sent a full charge after the retreating army and captured 16 artillery pieces, 176 wagons, and 1,500 stands of small arms. In all, the maneuver cost Forrest 96 men killed and 396 wounded. The day was worse for U.S. troops, who suffered 223 killed, 394 wounded, and 1,623 missing. The losses were a deep blow to the black regiment under Sturgis's command. In the hasty retreat, they stripped off commemorative badges that read \"Remember Fort Pillow\" to avoid goading the Confederate force pursuing them.\nOne month later, while serving under General Stephen D. Lee, Forrest experienced tactical defeat at the Battle of Tupelo in 1864. Concerned about U.S. Army supply lines, Maj. Gen. Sherman sent a force under the command of Maj. Gen. Andrew J. Smith to deal with Forrest. U.S. Army forces drove the Confederates from the field, and Forrest was wounded in the foot, but his forces were not wholly destroyed. He continued to oppose U.S. Army efforts in the West for the remainder of the war.\nTennessee Raids.\nForrest led other raids that summer and fall, including a famous one into U.S. Army-held downtown Memphis in August 1864 (the Second Battle of Memphis) and another on a major U.S. Army supply depot at Johnsonville, Tennessee. On November 4, 1864, during the Battle of Johnsonville, the Confederates shelled the city, sinking three gunboats and nearly thirty other ships and destroying many tons of supplies. During Hood's Tennessee Campaign, he fought alongside General John Bell Hood, the newest commander of the Confederate Army of Tennessee, in the Second Battle of Franklin on November 30. Facing a disastrous defeat, Forrest argued bitterly with Hood (his superior officer) demanding permission to cross the Harpeth River and cut off the escape route of U.S. Army Maj. Gen. John M. Schofield's army. He eventually made the attempt, but it was too late.\nMurfreesboro, Nashville, and Selma.\nAfter his bloody defeat at Franklin, Hood continued to Nashville. Hood ordered Forrest to conduct an independent raid against the Murfreesboro garrison. After success in achieving the objectives specified by Hood, Forrest engaged U.S. forces near Murfreesboro on December 5, 1864. In what would be known as the Third Battle of Murfreesboro, a portion of Forrest's command broke and ran. When Hood's battle-hardened Army of Tennessee, consisting of 40,000 men deployed in three infantry corps plus 10,000 to 15,000 cavalry, was all but destroyed on December 15\u201316, at the Battle of Nashville, Forrest distinguished himself by commanding the Confederate rear guard in a series of actions that allowed what was left of the army to escape. For this, he would later be promoted to the rank of lieutenant general on March 2, 1865. A portion of his command, now dismounted, was surprised and captured in their camp at Verona, Mississippi on December 25, 1864, during a raid of the Mobile and Ohio Railroad by a brigade of Brig. Gen. Benjamin Grierson's cavalry division.\nIn the spring of 1865, Forrest led an unsuccessful defense of the state of Alabama against Wilson's Raid. His opponent, U.S. Army Brig. Gen. James H. Wilson, defeated Forrest at the Battle of Selma on April 2, 1865. A week later, General Robert E. Lee surrendered to Grant in Virginia. When he received news of Lee's surrender, Forrest surrendered as well. On May 9, 1865, at Gainesville, Forrest read his farewell address to the men under his command, urging them to \"submit to the powers to be, and to aid in restoring peace and establishing law and order throughout the land.\"\nPostwar years and later life.\nBusiness ventures.\nAs a former slave owner and slave trader, Forrest experienced the abolition of slavery at the war's end as a major financial setback. During the war, he became interested in the area around Crowley's Ridge and took up civilian life in 1865 in Memphis, Tennessee. In 1866, Forrest and C.C. McCreanor contracted to finish the Memphis &amp; Little Rock Railroad, including a right-of-way that passed over the ridge. The ridgetop commissary he built as a provisioning store for the 1,000 Irish laborers hired to lay the rails became the nucleus of a town, which most residents called \"Forrest's Town\" and which was incorporated as Forrest City, Arkansas in 1870.\nThe historian Court Carney writes that Forrest was not universally popular in the white Memphis community: he alienated many of the city's business people in his commercial dealings and was criticized for questionable business practices that caused him to default on debts.\nHe later found employment at the Selma-based Marion &amp; Memphis Railroad and eventually became the company president. He was not as successful in railroad promotion as in war, and, under his direction, the company went bankrupt. Nearly ruined as the result of this failure, Forrest spent his final days running an eight-hundred-acre farm on land he leased on President's Island in the Mississippi River, where he and his wife lived in a log cabin. There, with the labor of over a hundred prison convicts, he grew corn, potatoes, vegetables, and cotton profitably, but his health steadily declined. In May 1877, Forrest's use of convict labor was described as indistinguishable from slavery, in its use of bloodhounds, shotgun-wielding guards, and corporal punishment. Critics also argued it was unjust and exploitative: \"The convict farmer has a financial interest in the conviction of as many persons as he may need...and the obsequious and corrupt myrmidons and magistrates of the law can readily supply the demand at a short notice in a country where the unprotected negro is left to steal or starve.\"\nOffers his services to Sherman.\nDuring the \"Virginius\" Affair of 1873, some of Forrest's old Confederate friends were filibusters aboard the vessel; consequently, he wrote a letter to the then General-in-Chief of the United States Army William T. Sherman and offered his services in case a war were to break out between the United States and Spain. Sherman, who had recognized how formidable an opponent Forrest was in battle during the Civil War, replied after the crisis settled down. He thanked Forrest for the offer and stated that had war broken out, he would have considered it an honor to have served side by side with him.\nKu Klux Klan leadership.\nForrest was an early member of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK), which was formed by six veterans of the Confederate Army in Pulaski, Tennessee, during the spring of 1866 and soon expanded throughout the state and beyond. Forrest became involved sometime in late 1866 or early 1867. A common report was that Forrest arrived in Nashville while the Klan was meeting at the Maxwell House Hotel in April 1867, probably at the encouragement of former fellow CSA general, turned state Klan leader, George Gordon. The organization had grown to the point that an experienced commander was needed, and Forrest was well-suited to assume the role. In Room 10 of the Maxwell, Forrest was sworn in as a member by John W. Morton. Brian Steel Wills quotes two KKK members who identified Forrest as a Klan leader. James R. Crowe stated, \"After the order grew to large numbers we found it necessary to have someone of large experience to command. We chose General Forrest\". Another member wrote, \"N. B. Forrest of Confederate fame was at our head, and was known as the Grand Wizard. I heard him make a speech in one of our Dens\". The title \"Grand Wizard\" was chosen because Forrest had been known as \"The Wizard of the Saddle\" during the war. According to Jack Hurst's 1993 biography, \"Two years after Appomattox, Forrest was reincarnated as grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan. As the Klan's first national leader, he became the Lost Cause of the Confederacy's avenging angel, galvanizing a loose collection of boyish secret social clubs into a reactionary instrument of terror still feared today.\" Forrest was the Klan's first and only Grand Wizard, and he was active in recruitment for the Klan from 1867 to 1868.\nFollowing the war, the United States Congress began passing the Reconstruction Acts to specify conditions for the readmission of former Confederate States to the United States, including ratification of the Fourteenth (1868), and Fifteenth (1870) Amendments to the United States Constitution. The Fourteenth addressed citizenship rights and equal protection of the laws for formerly enslaved people, while the Fifteenth specifically secured the voting rights of black men. According to Wills, in the August 1867 state elections the Klan was relatively restrained in its actions. White Americans who made up the KKK hoped to persuade black voters that returning to their pre-war state of bondage was in their best interest. Forrest assisted in maintaining order. After these efforts failed, Klan violence and intimidation escalated and became widespread. Author Andrew Ward, however, writes, \"In the spring of 1867, Forrest and his dragoons launched a campaign of midnight parades; 'ghost' masquerades; and 'whipping' and even 'killing Negro voters and white Republicans, to scare blacks off voting and running for office'\". In 1868, \"Klan organizers circulated printed rituals. Forrest and his business partners were then promoting an insurance venture, and their travels facilitated the movement .\"\nIn an 1868 interview by a Cincinnati newspaper, Forrest claimed that the Ku Klux Klan had 40,000 members in Tennessee and 550,000 total members throughout the Southern United States. He said he sympathized with them, but denied any formal connection, although he claimed he could muster thousands of men himself. He described the Klan as \"a protective political military organization\u00a0... The members are sworn to recognize the government of the United States ... Its objects originally were protection against Loyal Leagues and the Grand Army of the Republic\u00a0...\". After only a year as Grand Wizard, in January 1869, faced with an ungovernable membership employing methods that seemed increasingly counterproductive, Forrest dissolved the Klan, ordered their costumes destroyed, and withdrew from participation. His declaration had little effect, and few Klansmen destroyed their robes and hoods.\nIn 1871, the \"U.S. Congressional Committee Report\" stated that \"The natural tendency of all such organizations is to violence and crime, hence it was that Gen. Forrest and other men of influence by the exercise of their moral power, induced them to disband\".\nDemocratic convention 1868.\nThe Klan's activity infiltrated the Democratic Party's campaign for the presidential election of 1868. Prominent ex-Confederates, including Forrest, the Grand Wizard of the Klan, and South Carolina's Wade Hampton, attended as delegates at the 1868 Democratic Convention, held at Tammany Hall headquarters at 141 East 14th Street in New York City. Forrest rode to the convention on a train that was stopped just outside of a small town along the way, when he was confronted by a well-known fighter shouting \"d[amne]d butcher\" and wanting to \"thrash\" him. When Forrest rose and approached the bully, his larger challenger's \"purpose evaporated.\" Former governor of New York Horatio Seymour was nominated as the Democratic presidential candidate, while Forrest's friend, Francis Preston Blair Jr., was nominated as the Democratic vice presidential candidate, Seymour's running mate. The Seymour\u2013Blair Democratic ticket's campaign slogan was: \"Our Ticket, Our Motto, This Is a White Man's Country; Let White Men Rule\". The Democratic Party platform denounced the Reconstruction Acts as unconstitutional, void, and revolutionary. The party advocated the termination of the Freedman's Bureau and any government policy designed to aid blacks in the Southern United States. These developments worked to the advantage of the Republicans, who focused on the Democratic Party's alleged disloyalty during and after the Civil War.\nElection of 1868 and Grant.\nDuring the presidential election of 1868, the Ku Klux Klan, under the leadership of Forrest, and other terrorist groups, used brutal violence and intimidation against blacks and Republican voters. Forrest played a prominent role in the spread of the Klan in the Southern United States, meeting with racist whites in Atlanta several times between February and March 1868. Forrest probably organized a statewide Klan network in Georgia during these visits. On March 31, the Klan struck, killing prominent Republican organizer George Ashburn in Columbus.\nThe Republicans had nominated one of Forrest's battle adversaries, U.S. war hero Ulysses S. Grant, for the presidency at their convention held in October. Klansmen took their orders from their former Confederate officers. In Louisiana, 1,000 blacks were killed to suppress Republican voting. In Georgia, blacks and Republicans also faced a lot of violence. The Klan's violence was primarily designed to intimidate voters, targeting black and white supporters of the Republican Party. The Klan's violent tactics backfired, as Grant, whose slogan was \"Let us have peace\", won the election and Republicans gained a majority in Congress. Grant defeated Horatio Seymour, the Democratic presidential candidate, by a comfortable electoral margin, 214 to 80. The popular vote was much closer: Grant received 3,013,365 (52.7%) votes, while Seymour received 2,708,744 (47.3%) votes. Grant lost Georgia and Louisiana, where the violence and intimidation against blacks were most prominent.\nKlan prosecution and Congressional testimony (1871).\nMany in the United States, including President Grant, backed the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment, which gave voting rights to American men regardless of \"race, color, or previous condition of servitude\". Congress and Grant passed the Enforcement Acts from 1870 to 1871 to protect the \"registration, voting, officeholding, or jury service\" of African Americans. Under these laws enforced by Grant and the newly formed Department of Justice, there were over 5,000 indictments and 1,000 convictions of Klan members across the Southern United States.\nForrest testified before the Congressional investigation of Klan activities on June 27, 1871. He denied membership, but his role in the KKK was beyond the scope of the investigating committee, which wrote: \"Our design is not to connect General Forrest with this order (the reader may form his own conclusion upon this question)\". The committee also noted, \"The natural tendency of all such organizations is to violence and crime; hence it was that General Forrest and other men of influence in the state, by the exercise of their moral power, induced them to disband\". George Cantor, a biographer of Confederate generals, wrote, \"Forrest ducked and weaved, denying all knowledge, but admitted he knew some of the people involved. He sidestepped some questions and pleaded failure of memory on others. Afterwards, he admitted to 'gentlemanly lies'. He wanted nothing more to do with the Klan, but felt honor bound to protect former associates.\"\nRace and politics (1870s).\nAfter the lynch mob murder of four black people who had been arrested for defending themselves in a brawl at a barbecue, Forrest wrote to Tennessee governor John C. Brown in August 1874 volunteering to personally lead a posse to punish the \"white marauders\" responsible. Brown politely declined the offer.\nIn January 1875, Forrest came to Nashville to work against the re-election of Andrew Johnson for Senate; four of the six other candidates being considered by the Tennessee Assembly were fellow former high officers in the Confederate Army, namely generals John C. Brown, William B. Bate, W. A. Quarles, and Colonel John H. Savage. According to historian Fay W. Brabson, when Forrest arrived Johnson cunningly told him, \"When the gods arrive, the half-gods depart; if the people really wanted to bestow honor where honor was due, they should support Forrest for the Senate instead of any one-horse general.\" Forrest was duly flattered and left town for Memphis that night, leaving the \"lesser military contenders\" to fight amongst themselves amidst a losing battle with Johnson.\nIn his last public appearance, Forrest gave a speech on July 5, 1875 before the Independent Order of Pole-Bearers Association, a post-war organization of black Southerners advocating to both improve black people's economic condition and gain equal rights for all citizens. He made what \"The New York Times\" described as a \"friendly speech\" during which, when offered a bouquet by the daughter of a Pole Bearers' officer, he accepted them, thanked the young black woman and kissed her on the cheek. Forrest spoke in encouragement of black advancement and endeavored to be a proponent for espousing peace and harmony between black and white Americans.\nIn response to the Pole-Bearers speech, the Cavalry Survivors Association of Augusta, the first Confederate organization formed after the war, held a meeting on July 30, 1875 in which Captain Francis Edgeworth Eve, a former enlisted cavalry soldier who had been elected to his rank in the Georgia Hussars, gave a speech expressing strong disapproval of Forrest's remarks promoting inter-ethnic harmony, ridiculing his faculties and judgment and berating the woman who gave Forrest flowers as \"a mulatto wench\". The association voted unanimously to amend its constitution to expressly forbid publicly advocating for or hinting at any association of white women and girls as being in the same classes as \"females of the negro race\". The \"Macon Weekly Telegraph\" newspaper also condemned Forrest for his speech, describing the event as \"the recent disgusting exhibition of himself at the negro jamboree\" and quoting part of a \"Charlotte Observer\" article, which read \"We have infinitely more respect for Longstreet, who fraternizes with negro men on public occasions, with the pay for the treason to his race in his pocket, than with Forrest and [General] Pillow, who equalize with the negro women, with only 'futures' in payment\".\nDeath.\nForrest reportedly died from acute complications of diabetes at the Memphis home of his brother Jesse on October 29, 1877. His eulogy was delivered by his recent spiritual mentor, former Confederate chaplain George Tucker Stainback, who declared in his eulogy: \"Lieutenant-General Nathan Bedford Forrest, though dead, yet speaketh. His acts have photographed themselves upon the hearts of thousands, and will speak there forever.\"\nForrest's funeral procession was over two miles long. The crowd of mourners was estimated to include 20,000 people. According to Forrest biographer Jack Hurst, writers present at the public viewing of Forrest's body and the funeral procession noted many black citizens among them.\nForrest was buried on October 30, 1877 at Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis with military honors and rites as a member of the Oddfellows. In 1904, the remains of Forrest and his wife Mary were disinterred from Elmwood and moved to a Memphis city park that was originally named Forrest Park in his honor but has since been renamed Health Sciences Park.\nOn July 7, 2015, the Memphis City Council unanimously voted to remove the statue of Forrest from Health Sciences Park, and to return the remains of Forrest and his wife to Elmwood Cemetery. However, on October 13, 2017, the Tennessee Historical Commission invoked the Tennessee Heritage Protection Act of 2013 and U.S. Public Law 85-425: Sec. 410 to overrule the city. Consequently, Memphis sold the park land to Memphis Greenspace, a non-profit entity not subject to the Tennessee Heritage Protection Act, which immediately removed the monument as explained below.\nHistorical reputation and legacy.\nSpecific monuments.\nMany memorials have been erected to Forrest, especially in Tennessee and adjacent southern states. Forrest was elevated in Memphis\u2014where he lived and died\u2014to the status of folk hero. Historian Court Carney suggested that \"embarrassed by their city's early capitulation during the Civil War, white Memphians desperately needed a hero and therefore crafted a distorted depiction of Forrest's role in the war.\" Moreover, a \"strong Forrest cult exists among fans of the Lost Cause.\" Forrest's legacy as \"one of the most controversial\u2014and popular\u2014icons of the war\" still draws heated public debate. As of 2007[ [update]], Tennessee had 32 dedicated historical markers linked to Nathan Bedford Forrest, more than were dedicated to all three former Presidents associated with the state combined: Andrew Jackson, James K. Polk, and Andrew Johnson. A Tennessee-based organization, the Sons of Confederate Veterans, posthumously awarded Forrest their Confederate Medal of Honor, created in 1977.\nPublic schools.\nHigh schools named for Forrest were built in Chapel Hill, Tennessee, and Jacksonville, Florida. The school in Jacksonville was named for Forrest in 1959 at the urging of the Daughters of the Confederacy because they were upset about the 1954 \"Brown v. Board of Education\" decision. In 2008, the Duval County School Board voted 5\u20132 against a push to change the name of Nathan Bedford Forrest High School in Jacksonville. In 2013, the board voted 7\u20130 to begin the process to rename the school. The school was all white until Duval County schools were ordered to be desegregated in 1971, but now more than half the student body is black. After several public forums and discussions, Westside High School was unanimously approved in January 2014 as the school's new name. The Forrest Hill Academy high school in Atlanta, Georgia, which had been named for Forrest, was renamed the Hank Aaron New Beginnings Academy in April 2021 after the Atlanta Braves baseball star who had died less than three months prior.\nMiddle Tennessee State University.\nIn 1978, Middle Tennessee State University abandoned imagery it had formerly used (in 1951, the school's yearbook, \"The Midlander\", featured the first appearance of Forrest's likeness as MTSU's official mascot) and MTSU president M. G. Scarlett removed the General's image from the university's official seal. The Blue Raiders' athletic mascot was changed to an ambiguous swash-buckler character called the \"Blue Raider\" to avoid association with Forrest or the Confederacy. The school unveiled its latest mascot, a winged horse named \"Lightning\" inspired by the mythological Pegasus, during halftime of a basketball game against rival Tennessee State University on January 17, 1998. The ROTC building at MTSU had been named Forrest Hall to honor him in 1958, but the frieze depicting him on horseback that had adorned the side of the building was removed amid protests in 2006. A significant push to change its name failed on February 16, 2018, when the governor-controlled Tennessee Historical Commission denied Middle Tennessee State University's petition to rename Forrest Hall.\nMississippi license plate plan.\nA 2011 proposal by the Sons of Confederate Veterans to honor Forrest with a Mississippi license plate revived tensions and raised objections from Mississippi NAACP chapter president Derrick Johnson, who compared Forrest to Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein. The Mississippi NAACP petitioned Governor Haley Barbour to denounce the plates and prevent their distribution. Barbour refused to denounce the honor. Instead, he noted that the state legislature would not likely approve the plate anyway.\nForrest monument in Old Live Oak Cemetery, Selma, Alabama.\nIn 2000, a monument to Forrest was unveiled in Selma, Alabama. The monument to Forrest in the Confederate Circle section of Old Live Oak Cemetery in Selma, Alabama, reads \"Defender of Selma, Wizard of the Saddle, Untutored Genius, The first with the most. This monument stands as testament of our perpetual devotion and respect for Lieutenant General Nathan Bedford Forrest. CSA 1821\u20131877, one of the South's finest heroes. In honor of Gen. Forrest's unwavering defense of Selma, the great state of Alabama, and the Confederacy, this memorial is dedicated. DEO VINDICE\". The bust of Forrest was stolen from the cemetery monument in March 2012 and replaced in May 2015.\nForrest Park, now Health Sciences Park, in Memphis.\nA memorial to him, the first Civil War memorial in Memphis, was erected in 1905 in a new Nathan Bedford Forrest Park. In 2005, Shelby County Commissioner Walter Bailey started an effort to move the statue over Forrest's grave and rename Forrest Park. Former Memphis Mayor Willie Herenton, who is black, blocked the move. In 2013, Forrest Park in Memphis was renamed the Health Sciences Park amid substantial controversy. In light of the 2015 church shooting in Charleston, South Carolina, some Tennessee lawmakers advocated removing a bust of Forrest located in the state's Capitol building. Subsequently, then-Mayor A C Wharton urged that the statue of Forrest be removed from the Health Sciences Park and suggested that the remains of Forrest and his wife be relocated to their original burial site in nearby Elmwood Cemetery. In a nearly unanimous vote on July 7, the Memphis City Council passed a resolution in favor of removing the statue and securing the couple's remains for transfer. The Tennessee Historical Commission denied removal on October 21, 2016, under the authority granted it by the Tennessee Heritage Protection Act of 2013, which prevents cities and counties from relocating, removing, renaming, or otherwise disturbing without permission war memorials on public property. The city council then voted on December 20, 2017, to sell Health Sciences Park to Memphis Greenspace, a new non-profit corporation not subject to the Heritage Protection Act, which removed the statue and another of Jefferson Davis that same evening. The Sons of Confederate Veterans threatened a lawsuit against the city. On April 18, 2018, the Tennessee House of Representatives punished Memphis by cutting $250,000 (~$ in 2024) in appropriations for the city's bicentennial celebration. On June 3, 2021, the remains of Forrest and his wife were exhumed from their burial place in the park, where they had been for over a century, to be reburied in Columbia, Tennessee. The exhumation and reburial were the results of a campaign that began after the Unite the Right Rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017. The effort was spearheaded by Shelby County Commissioner Tami Sawyer, an educator and Memphis native who founded a group called Take 'Em Down 901 to advocate for the removal of Confederate iconography. After the Forrests' remains were removed from Memphis, they were reportedly buried in Munford, Tennessee until their reburial in Columbia in September 2021 by the Sons of Confederate Veterans.\nNathan Bedford Forrest Day: The Tennessee legislature established July 13 as \"Nathan Bedford Forrest Day\". As of 2019, Nathan Bedford Forrest Day was still observed in Tennessee, though some Democrats in the state had attempted to change the law, which required Tennessee's governor to sign a proclamation honoring the holiday. However, since that time, Governor Bill Lee's administration introduced a bill\u2014passed by the Tennessee legislature on June 10, 2020\u2014which released the governor from the former requirement that he proclaim that observance each year and a spokesperson for Governor Lee confirmed that he would not be signing a Forrest Day proclamation in July 2020. In June 2020, after black members of the Tennessee House of Representatives unsuccessfully asked it to eliminate a state celebration of Forrest, Representative Cameron Sexton opined: \"I don't think anybody here is truly racist. I think people may make insensitive comments.\"\nNathan Bedford Forrest bust.\nA bust sculpted by Jane Baxendale is on display at the Tennessee State Capitol building in Nashville. Brett Joseph Forrest, a direct descendant of Nathan, spoke in support of the bust's removal. In 2021 Sexton voted against the removal of the bust of Forrest from the Tennessee State Capitol and into the Tennessee State Museum, but only one other legislator agreed with him, and the bust was removed. Sexton said that he believed \"Trying to judge past generations' actions based on today's values and the evolution of societies is not an exercise I am willing to do because I think it is counterproductive.\"\nMilitary doctrines.\nForrest is considered one of the Civil War's most brilliant tacticians by the historian Spencer C. Tucker. Forrest fought by simple rules; he maintained that \"war means fighting and fighting means killing\" and the way to win was \"to get there first with the most men\". U.S. Army General William Tecumseh Sherman called him \"that devil Forrest\" in wartime communications with Ulysses S. Grant and considered him \"the most remarkable man our civil war produced on either side\".\nForrest became well known for his early use of maneuver tactics as applied to a mobile horse cavalry deployment. He grasped the doctrines of mobile warfare that would eventually become prevalent in the 20th century. Paramount in his strategy was fast movement, even if it meant pushing his horses at a killing pace, to constantly harass the enemy during raids by disrupting their supply trains and communications with the destruction of railroad tracks and the cutting of telegraph lines, as he wheeled around his opponent's flank. The Civil War scholar Bruce Catton writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Forrest ... used his horsemen as a modern general would use motorized infantry. He liked horses because he liked fast movement, and his mounted men could get from here to there much faster than any infantry could; but when they reached the field they usually tied their horses to trees and fought on foot, and they were as good as the very best infantry.\nForrest is often erroneously quoted as saying his strategy was \"to git thar fustest with the mostest\". Now often recast as \"Getting there firstest with the mostest\", this misquote first appeared in a \"New York Tribune\" article written to provide colorful comments in reaction to European interest in Civil War generals. The aphorism was addressed and corrected as \"Ma'am, I got there first with the most men\" by a \"New York Times\" story in 1918. Though it was a novel and succinct condensation of the military principles of mass and maneuver, Bruce Catton writes of the spurious quote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Do not, under any circumstances whatever, quote Forrest as saying \"fustest\" and \"mostest\". He did not say it that way, and nobody who knows anything about him imagines that he did.\nCriticism.\nMilitary historian Christopher Rein takes a dim view of Forrest. While agreeing that Forrest was a skilled cavalryman, perhaps the best on the Confederate side, and tactically shrewd, Rein points out that the latter quality was most evident only in smaller engagements such as the First Battle of Murfreesboro, Brice's Crossroads and Parker's Cross Roads, victories that were strategically peripheral to the Confederate cause and often came through bluffery or at the expense of inferior enemy troops. Forrest's celebrated personal bravery, willingness to lead from the front and get \"in the mix\" may have earned him considerable admiration in his day from both sides in the war, Rein notes. But those virtues, he continues, are useful to armies when they are demonstrated by junior officers and enlisted men, not generals who must consider the larger picture, as Forrest failed to do when he led troops to Ebenezer Church rather than prepare a more robust defense at Selma, a loss that effectively ended the war as the Union destroyed the Confederacy's last manufacturing center.\nAs part of larger formations, writes Rein, Forrest's tendency to take the initiative and fight without consulting his superiors hurt the Confederacy more than once. His failures at Chickamauga left Bragg with a more ephemeral victory than he might have otherwise gained, at Tupelo he escaped but at the cost of his ability to mount serious raids on Sherman's supply lines, and Johnsonville, despite its overwhelming success, hurt the Confederacy as it led Hood to delay his advance into Tennessee, allowing Thomas to consolidate his defenses for the Battle of Nashville, where Union victory ended the Army of Tennessee as a force to reckon with, and with it the Confederacy's Western Theater campaign.\nIn the anthology \"The Worst Military Leaders in History\", Rein further contends that the glorification of Forrest and his tactical brilliance by his many defenders, many like him minimally educated U.S. military cadets from the South who have seen him as also exemplifying the Southern virtues celebrated by the Lost Cause of the Confederacy myth, has had longterm negative effects on U.S. military performance:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;... [G]reat leadership is only one aspect of command. Forrest was certainly a skilled \"tactician\", but great commanders must have \"strategic\" vision, or some semblance of how their victories translate into successful \"operations\" (known as \"operational art\") and, ultimately, into strategic victory. Otherwise, the commander runs the risk of falling into the same traps set for American commanders in Vietnam or Iraq: winning an unbroken string of tactical victories but never translating those successes into the strategic conditions necessary for a decisive victory.\nFort Pillow.\nModern historians generally believe that Forrest's attack on Fort Pillow was a massacre, noting high casualty rates and the rebels targeting black soldiers. Forrest's claim that the Fort Pillow massacre was an invention of U.S. reporters is contradicted by letters written by Confederate soldiers to their own families, which described extreme brutality on the part of Confederate troops. It was the Confederacy's publicly stated position that former slaves firing on whites would be killed on the spot, along with Southern whites that fought for the Union, whom the Confederacy considered traitors. According to this analysis, Forrest's troops were carrying out Confederate policy. The historical record does not support his repeated denials that he knew a massacre was taking place or that he even knew a massacre had occurred at all.\nConsequently, his role at Fort Pillow was a stigmatizing one for him the rest of his life, both professionally and personally, and contributed to his business problems after the war.\nHistorians have differed in their interpretations of the events at Fort Pillow. Richard L. Fuchs, author of \"An Unerring Fire\", concluded:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAndrew Ward downplays the controversy:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nJohn Cimprich states:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe site is now a Tennessee State Historic Park.\nGrant himself described Forrest as \"a brave and intrepid cavalry general\" while noting that Forrest sent a dispatch on the Fort Pillow Massacre \"in which he left out the part which shocks humanity to read\".\nIn popular culture.\nIn the 1990 PBS documentary \"The Civil War\" by Ken Burns, historian Shelby Foote states in Episode 7 that the Civil War produced two \"authentic geniuses\": Abraham Lincoln and Nathan Bedford Forrest. When he expressed his opinion to one of Forrest's granddaughters, she replied after a pause, \"You know, we never thought much of Mr. Lincoln in my family\". Foote also made Forrest a major character in his novel \"Shiloh\", which used numerous first-person stories to illustrate a detailed timeline and account of the battle.\nTom Hanks's title character in the film \"Forrest Gump\" remarks in one scene that his mother named him after Nathan Bedford Forrest and \"we was related to him in some way\". The following scene satirically depicts Hanks as Forrest in a Ku Klux Klan outfit, donning a hood and being superimposed into scenes of the Klan from \"The Birth of a Nation\".\nIn 2025, Forrest was portrayed by David Meadows in the historical romance drama film The Legend of Van Dorn, which dramatizes the final chapter of Confederate General Earl Van Dorn's life.\nIn Paul Thomas Anderson's 2025 film, \"One Battle After Another\", antagonist Steven J. Lockjaw is shown receiving the \"Bedford Forrest Medal of Honor\" in recognition for his role in hunting down and killing of members of the revolutionary group \"The French 75.\" \nReferences.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBooks"}

Pigments are completely or nearly insoluble and chemically unreactive in water or another medium; in contrast, dyes are colored substances which are soluble or go into solution at some stage in their use. Dyes are often organic compounds whereas pigments are often inorganic. Pigments of prehistoric and historic value include ochre, charcoal, and lapis lazuli. Biological pigments are compounds produced by living organisms that provide coloration.\nEconomic impact.\nIn 2006, around 7.4\u00a0million tons of inorganic, organic, and special pigments were marketed worldwide. According to an April 2018 report by \"Bloomberg Businessweek\", the estimated value of the pigment industry globally is $30 billion. The value of titanium dioxide \u2013 used to enhance the white brightness of many products \u2013 was placed at $13.2 billion per year, while the color Ferrari red is valued at $300 million each year.\nPhysical principles.\nLike all materials, the color of pigments arises because they absorb only certain wavelengths of visible light. The bonding properties of the material determine the wavelength and efficiency of light absorption. Light of other wavelengths are reflected or scattered. The reflected light spectrum defines the color that we observe.\nThe appearance of pigments is sensitive to the source light. Sunlight has a high color temperature and a fairly uniform spectrum. Sunlight is considered a standard for white light. Artificial light sources are less uniform.\nColor spaces used to represent colors numerically must specify their light source. Lab color measurements, unless otherwise noted, assume that the measurement was recorded under a D65 light source, or \"Daylight 6500 K\", which is roughly the color temperature of sunlight.\nOther properties of a color, such as its saturation or lightness, may be determined by the other substances that accompany pigments. Binders and fillers can affect the color.\nHistory.\nMinerals have been used as colorants since prehistoric times. Early humans used paint for aesthetic purposes such as body decoration. Pigments and paint grinding equipment believed to be between 350,000 and 400,000 years old have been reported in a cave at Twin Rivers, near Lusaka, Zambia. Ochre, iron oxide, was the first color of paint. A favored blue pigment was derived from lapis lazuli. Pigments based on minerals and clays often bear the name of the city or region where they were originally mined. Raw sienna and burnt sienna came from Siena, Italy, while raw umber and burnt umber came from Umbria. These pigments were among the easiest to synthesize, and chemists created modern colors based on the originals. These were more consistent than colors mined from the original ore bodies, but the place names remained. Also found in many Paleolithic and Neolithic cave paintings are Red Ochre, anhydrous Fe2O3, and the hydrated Yellow Ochre (Fe2O3.H2O). Charcoal\u2014or carbon black\u2014has also been used as a black pigment since prehistoric times.\nThe first known synthetic pigment was Egyptian blue, which is first attested on an alabaster bowl in Egypt dated to Naqada III (\"circa\" 3250 BC). Egyptian blue (blue frit), calcium copper silicate CaCuSi4O10, made by heating a mixture of quartz sand, lime, a flux and a copper source, such as malachite. Already invented in the Predynastic Period of Egypt, its use became widespread by the 4th Dynasty. It was the blue pigment par excellence of Roman antiquity; its art technological traces vanished in the course of the Middle Ages until its rediscovery in the context of the Egyptian campaign and the excavations in Pompeii and Herculaneum. Later premodern synthetic pigments include white lead (basic lead carbonate, (PbCO3)2Pb(OH)2), vermilion, verdigris, and lead-tin yellow. Vermilion, a mercury sulfide, was originally made by grinding a powder of natural cinnabar. From the 17th century on, it was also synthesized from the elements. It was favored by old masters such as Titian. Indian yellow was once produced by collecting the urine of cattle that had been fed only mango leaves. Dutch and Flemish painters of the 17th and 18th centuries favored it for its luminescent qualities, and often used it to represent sunlight. Since mango leaves are nutritionally inadequate for cattle, the practice of harvesting Indian yellow was eventually declared to be inhumane. Modern hues of Indian yellow are made from synthetic pigments. Vermillion has been partially replaced in by cadmium reds.\nBecause of the cost of lapis lazuli, substitutes were often used. Prussian blue, the oldest modern synthetic pigment, was discovered by accident in 1704. By the early 19th century, synthetic and metallic blue pigments included French ultramarine, a synthetic form of lapis lazuli. Ultramarine was manufactured by treating aluminium silicate with sulfur. Various forms of cobalt blue and Cerulean blue were also introduced. In the early 20th century, Phthalo Blue, a synthetic metallo-organic pigment was prepared. At the same time, Royal Blue, another name once given to tints produced from lapis lazuli, has evolved to signify a much lighter and brighter color, and is usually mixed from Phthalo Blue and titanium dioxide, or from inexpensive synthetic blue dyes.\nThe discovery in 1856 of mauveine, the first aniline dyes, was a forerunner for the development of hundreds of synthetic dyes and pigments like azo and diazo compounds. These dyes ushered in the flourishing of organic chemistry, including systematic designs of colorants. The development of organic chemistry diminished the dependence on inorganic pigments.\nManufacturing and industrial standards.\nBefore the development of synthetic pigments, and the refinement of techniques for extracting mineral pigments, batches of color were often inconsistent. With the development of a modern color industry, manufacturers and professionals have cooperated to create international standards for identifying, producing, measuring, and testing colors.\nFirst published in 1905, the Munsell color system became the foundation for a series of color models, providing objective methods for the measurement of color. The Munsell system describes a color in three dimensions, hue, value (lightness), and chroma (color purity), where chroma is the difference from gray at a given hue and value.\nBy the middle 20th century, standardized methods for pigment chemistry were available, part of an international movement to create such standards in industry. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) develops technical standards for the manufacture of pigments and dyes. ISO standards define various industrial and chemical properties, and how to test for them. The principal ISO standards that relate to all pigments are as follows:\nOther ISO standards pertain to particular classes or categories of pigments, based on their chemical composition, such as ultramarine pigments, titanium dioxide, iron oxide pigments, and so forth.\nMany manufacturers of paints, inks, textiles, plastics, and colors have voluntarily adopted the Colour Index International (CII) as a standard for identifying the pigments that they use in manufacturing particular colors. First published in 1925\u2014and now published jointly on the web by the Society of Dyers and Colourists (United Kingdom) and the American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists (US)\u2014this index is recognized internationally as the authoritative reference on colorants. It encompasses more than 27,000 products under more than 13,000 generic color index names.\nIn the CII schema, each pigment has a generic index number that identifies it chemically, regardless of proprietary and historic names. For example, Phthalocyanine Blue BN has been known by a variety of generic and proprietary names since its discovery in the 1930s. In much of Europe, phthalocyanine blue is better known as Helio Blue, or by a proprietary name such as Winsor Blue. An American paint manufacturer, Grumbacher, registered an alternate spelling (Thanos Blue) as a trademark. Colour Index International resolves all these conflicting historic, generic, and proprietary names so that manufacturers and consumers can identify the pigment (or dye) used in a particular color product. In the CII, all phthalocyanine blue pigments are designated by a generic color index number as either PB15 or PB16, short for pigment blue 15 and pigment blue 16; these two numbers reflect slight variations in molecular structure, which produce a slightly more greenish or reddish blue.\nFigures of merit.\nThe following are some of the attributes of pigments that determine their suitability for particular manufacturing processes and applications:\nSwatches.\nSwatches are used to communicate colors accurately. The types of swatches are dictated by the media, i.e., printing, computers, plastics, and textiles. Generally, the medium that offers the broadest gamut of color shades is widely used across diverse media.\nPrinted swatches.\nReference standards are provided by printed swatches of color shades. PANTONE, RAL, Munsell, etc. are widely used standards of color communication across diverse media like printing, plastics, and textiles.\nPlastic swatches.\nCompanies manufacturing color masterbatches and pigments for plastics offer plastic swatches in injection molded color chips. These color chips are supplied to the designer or customer to choose and select the color for their specific plastic products.\nPlastic swatches are available in various special effects like pearl, metallic, fluorescent, sparkle, mosaic etc. However, these effects are difficult to replicate on other media like print and computer display. Plastic swatches have been created by 3D modelling to including various special effects.\nComputer swatches.\nThe appearance of pigments in natural light is difficult to replicate on a computer display. Approximations are required. The Munsell Color System provides an objective measure of color in three dimensions: hue, value (or lightness), and chroma. Computer displays in general fail to show the true chroma of many pigments, but the hue and lightness can be reproduced with relative accuracy. However, when the gamma of a computer display deviates from the reference value, the hue is also systematically biased.\nThe following approximations assume a display device at gamma 2.2, using the sRGB color space. The further a display device deviates from these standards, the less accurate these swatches will be. Swatches are based on the average measurements of several lots of single-pigment watercolor paints, converted from Lab color space to sRGB color space for viewing on a computer display. The appearance of a pigment may depend on the brand and even the batch. Furthermore, pigments have inherently complex reflectance spectra that will render their color appearance greatly different depending on the spectrum of the source illumination, a property called metamerism. Averaged measurements of pigment samples will only yield approximations of their true appearance under a specific source of illumination. Computer display systems use a technique called chromatic adaptation transforms to emulate the correlated color temperature of illumination sources, and cannot perfectly reproduce the intricate spectral combinations originally seen. In many cases, the perceived color of a pigment falls outside of the gamut of computer displays and a method called gamut mapping is used to approximate the true appearance. Gamut mapping trades off any one of lightness, hue, or saturation accuracy to render the color on screen, depending on the priority chosen in the conversion's ICC rendering intent.\nBiological pigments.\nIn biology, a pigment is any colored material of plant or animal cells. Many biological structures, such as skin, eyes, fur, and hair contain pigments (such as melanin).\nAnimal skin coloration often comes about through specialized cells called chromatophores, which animals such as the octopus and chameleon can control to vary the animal's color. Many conditions affect the levels or nature of pigments in plant, animal, some protista, or fungus cells. For instance, the disorder called albinism affects the level of melanin production in animals.\nPigmentation in organisms serves many biological purposes, including camouflage, mimicry, aposematism (warning), sexual selection and other forms of signalling, photosynthesis (in plants), and basic physical purposes such as protection from sunburn.\nPigment color differs from structural color in that pigment color is the same for all viewing angles, whereas structural color is the result of selective reflection or iridescence, usually because of multilayer structures. For example, butterfly wings typically contain structural color, although many butterflies have cells that contain pigment as well.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the largest ancient amphitheatre ever built, and is the largest standing amphitheatre in the world. Construction began under the Emperor Vespasian (r.\u200969\u00a0\u2013\u00a079\u00a0AD) in 72 and was completed in AD 80 under his successor and heir, Titus (r.\u200979\u00a0\u2013\u00a081). Further modifications were made during the reign of Domitian (r.\u200981\u00a0\u2013\u00a096). The three emperors who were patrons of the work are known as the Flavian dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named the Flavian Amphitheatre (; ) by later classicists and archaeologists for its association with their family name (Flavius).\nThe Colosseum is built of travertine limestone, tuff (volcanic rock), and brick-faced Roman concrete. It could hold an estimated 50,000 to 80,000 spectators at various points in its history, having an average audience of some 65,000; it was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles including animal hunts, executions, re-enactments of famous battles, dramas based on Roman mythology, and briefly mock sea battles. The building ceased to be used for entertainment in the early medieval era. It was later reused for such purposes as housing, workshops, quarters for a religious order, a fortress, a quarry, and a Christian shrine.\nAlthough substantially ruined by earthquakes and stone robbers taking \"spolia\", the Colosseum is still a renowned symbol of Imperial Rome and was listed as one of the New 7 Wonders of the World. It is one of Rome's most popular tourist attractions and each Good Friday the Pope leads a torchlit Catholic \"Way of the Cross\" procession that starts in the area around the Colosseum. The Colosseum is depicted on the Italian version of the 5 euro cent coin.\nName.\nOriginally, the building's Latin name was simply . Though the modern name Flavian Amphitheatre () is often used, there is no evidence it was used in classical antiquity. This name refers to the patronage of the Flavian dynasty, during whose reigns the building was constructed, but the structure is better known as the Colosseum. In antiquity, Romans may have referred to the Colosseum by the unofficial name \"Amphitheatrum Caesareum\" (with \"Caesareum\" an adjective pertaining to the title \"Caesar\"), but this name may have been strictly poetic as it was not exclusive to the Colosseum; Vespasian and Titus, builders of the Colosseum, also constructed a Flavian Amphitheatre in Puteoli (modern Pozzuoli).\nThe name \"Colosseum\" is believed to be derived from a colossal statue of Nero on the model of the Colossus of Rhodes. The giant bronze sculpture of Nero as a solar deity was moved to its position beside the amphitheatre by the emperor Hadrian (r.\u2009117\u00a0\u2013\u00a0138). The word \"colosseum\" is a neuter Latin noun formed from the adjective \"colosseus\", meaning \"gigantic\" or \"colossean\". By the year 1000 the Latin name \"Colosseum\" had been coined to refer to the amphitheatre from the nearby \"Colossus Solis\".\nIn the 8th century, an epigram attributed to the Venerable Bede celebrated the symbolic significance of the statue in a prophecy that is variously quoted: \"Quamdiu stat Colis\u00e6us, stat et Roma; quando cadet colis\u00e6us, cadet et Roma; quando cadet Roma, cadet et mundus\" (\"as long as the Colossus stands, so shall Rome; when the Colossus falls, Rome shall fall; when Rome falls, so falls the world\"). This is often mistranslated to refer to the Colosseum rather than the Colossus (as in, for instance, Byron's poem \"Childe Harold's Pilgrimage\"). However, at the time that the Pseudo-Bede wrote, the masculine noun \"coliseus\" was applied to the statue rather than to the amphitheatre.\nThe spelling was sometimes altered in and \"coliseum\" are attested from the 12th and 14th centuries respectively. In the 12th century, the structure was recorded as the . In the High Middle Ages, the Flavian amphitheatre is attested as the late 13th-century , and in by the early 16th century, by which time the word could be applied to any amphitheatre. From derived the , in use by the middle of the 15th century and employed by John Capgrave in his \"Solace of Pilgrims\", in which he remarked: . An English translation by John Bourchier, 2nd Baron Berners, of Antonio de Guevara's biography of Marcus Aurelius (r.\u2009161\u00a0\u2013\u00a0180) in about 1533 referred to ... Similarly, the , or , are attested as referring first to the amphitheatre in Rome, and then to any amphitheatre (as in 1367). By 1460, an equivalent existed in ; by 1495 had appeared the , and by 1548 the .\nThe earliest citation for the name Colosseum in Early Modern English is the 1600 translation, by Philemon Holland, of the \"Urbis Romae topographia\" of Bartolomeo Marliani, which he used in the preparation of his translation of Livy's Augustan era \"Ab Urbe Condita Libri\". The text states: \"This Amphitheatre was commonly called Colosseum, of Neroes Colossus, which was set up in the porch of Neroes house.\" Similarly, John Evelyn, translating the used by the architectural theorist Roland Fr\u00e9art de Chambray, wrote \"And 'tis indeed a kind of miracle to see that the Colosseum \u2026 and innumerable other Structures which seemed to have been built for Eternity, should be at present so ruinous and dilapidated\".\nHistory.\nConstruction, inauguration, and Roman renovations.\nThe site chosen was a flat area on the floor of a low valley between the Caelian, Esquiline and Palatine Hills, through which a canalised stream ran as well as an artificial lake/marsh. By the 2nd century BC the area was densely inhabited. It was devastated by the Great Fire of Rome in 64 AD, following which Nero seized much of the area to add to his personal domain. He built the grandiose Domus Aurea on the site, in front of which he created an artificial lake surrounded by pavilions, gardens and porticoes. The existing Aqua Claudia aqueduct was extended to supply water to the area and the gigantic bronze Colossus of Nero was set up nearby at the entrance to the Domus Aurea. \nAlthough the Colossus was preserved, much of the Domus Aurea was torn down. The lake was filled in and the land reused as the location for the new Flavian Amphitheatre. Gladiatorial schools and other support buildings were constructed nearby within the former grounds of the Domus Aurea. Vespasian's decision to build the Colosseum on the site of Nero's lake can be seen as a populist gesture of returning to the people an area of the city which Nero had appropriated for his own use. In contrast to many other amphitheatres, which were on the outskirts of a city, the Colosseum was constructed in the city centre, in effect, placing it both symbolically and geographically at the heart of Rome.\nConstruction was funded by the opulent spoils taken from the Jewish Temple after the First Jewish\u2013Roman War in 70 AD led to the Siege of Jerusalem. According to a reconstructed inscription found on the site, \"the emperor Vespasian ordered this new amphitheatre to be erected from his general's share of the booty.\" It is often assumed, as it is with many other Roman projects at the time, that slaves and prisoners of war were brought back to Rome and contributed to the massive workforce needed for the construction of the amphitheater. Along with this free source of unskilled labor, teams of professional Roman builders, engineers, artists, painters and decorators undertook the more specialized tasks necessary for building the Colosseum. The Colosseum was constructed with several different materials: wood, limestone, tuff, tiles, cement, and mortar.\nConstruction of the Colosseum began under the rule of Vespasian in around 70\u201372 AD (73\u201375 AD according to some sources). The Colosseum had been completed up to the third story by the time of Vespasian's death in 79. The top level was finished by his son, Titus, in 80, and the inaugural games were held in 80 or 81 AD. Dio Cassius recounts that over 9,000 wild animals were killed during the inaugural games of the amphitheatre. Commemorative coinage was issued celebrating the inauguration. The building was remodelled further under Vespasian's younger son, the newly designated Emperor Domitian, who constructed the \"hypogeum\", a series of tunnels used to house animals and slaves. He also added a gallery to the top of the Colosseum to increase its seating capacity.\nIn 217, the Colosseum was badly damaged by a major fire (caused by lightning, according to Dio Cassius), which destroyed the wooden upper levels of the amphitheatre's interior. It was not fully repaired until about 240 and underwent further repairs in 250 or 252 and again in 320. Honorius banned the practice of gladiator fights in 399 and again in 404. Gladiatorial fights are last mentioned around 435. An inscription records the restoration of various parts of the Colosseum under Theodosius II and Valentinian III (reigned 425\u2013455), possibly to repair damage caused by a major earthquake in 443; more work followed in 484 and 508. The arena continued to be used for contests well into the 6th century. Animal hunts continued until at least 523, when Anicius Maximus celebrated his consulship with some \"venationes\", criticised by King Theodoric the Great for their high cost.\nMedieval.\nThe Colosseum underwent several radical changes of use. By the late 6th century a small chapel had been built into the structure of the amphitheater, though this apparently did not confer any particular religious significance on the building as a whole. The arena was converted into a cemetery. The numerous vaulted spaces in the arcades under the seating were converted into housing and workshops, and are recorded as still being rented out as late as the 12th century. Around 1200 the Frangipani family took over the Colosseum and fortified it, apparently using it as a castle. In the early to mid 14th century, the Pope's relocation to Avignon caused a population decline in Rome that left the region insecure. The colosseum was largely abandoned by the public and became a popular den for bandits.\nSevere damage was inflicted on the Colosseum by the great earthquake in 1349, causing the outer south side, lying on a less stable alluvial terrain, to collapse. Much of the tumbled stone was reused to build palaces, churches, hospitals and other buildings elsewhere in Rome. In 1377, after the Pope's return to Rome, the Colosseum was restored by a religious order called Arciconfraternita del SS. Salvatore ad Sancta Sanctorum, who then inhabited a northern portion of it until as late as the early 19th century. The interior of the amphitheater was extensively stripped of stone, which was reused elsewhere, or (in the case of the marble fa\u00e7ade) was burned to make quicklime. The iron clamps which held the stonework together were pried or hacked out of the walls, leaving numerous pockmarks which still scar the building today.\nModern.\nDuring the 16th and 17th century, Church officials sought a productive role for the Colosseum. Pope Sixtus V (1585\u20131590) planned to turn the building into a wool factory to provide employment for Rome's prostitutes, though this proposal fell through with his premature death. In 1671, Cardinal Paluzzo Altieri authorized its use for bullfights; a public outcry caused the idea to be hastily abandoned.\nIn 1749, Pope Benedict XIV endorsed the view that the Colosseum was a sacred site where early Christians had been martyred. He forbade the use of the Colosseum as a quarry and consecrated the building to the Passion of Christ and installed Stations of the Cross, declaring it sanctified by the blood of the Christian martyrs who perished there (\"see Significance in Christianity\").\nHowever, there is no historical evidence to support Benedict's claim, nor is there even any evidence that anyone before the 16th century suggested this might be the case; the \"Catholic Encyclopedia\" concludes that there are no historical grounds for the supposition, other than the reasonably plausible conjecture that some of the many martyrs may well have been Christian.\nLater popes initiated various stabilization and restoration projects, removing the extensive vegetation which had overgrown the structure and threatened to damage it further. The fa\u00e7ade was reinforced with triangular brick wedges in 1807 and 1827, and the interior was repaired in 1831, 1846 and in the 1930s. The arena substructure was partly excavated in 1810\u20131814 and 1874 and was fully exposed under Benito Mussolini in the 1930s.\nThe Colosseum is today one of Rome's most popular tourist attractions, receiving millions of visitors annually. The effects of pollution and general deterioration over time prompted a major restoration programme carried out between 1993 and 2000, at a cost of 40\u00a0billion\u00a0lire ($19.3\u00a0million or \u20ac20.6\u00a0million at 2000 prices).\nIn recent years, the Colosseum has become a symbol of the international campaign against capital punishment, which was abolished in Italy in 1948. Several anti\u2013death penalty demonstrations took place in front of the Colosseum in 2000. Since that time, as a gesture against the death penalty, the local authorities of Rome change the color of the Colosseum's night time illumination from white to gold whenever a person condemned to the death penalty anywhere in the world gets their sentence commuted or is released, or if a jurisdiction abolishes the death penalty. Most recently, the Colosseum was illuminated in gold in November 2012 following the abolishment of capital punishment in the American state of Connecticut in April 2012.\nBecause of the ruined state of the interior, it is impractical to use the Colosseum to host large events; only a few hundred spectators can be accommodated in temporary seating. However, much larger concerts have been held just outside, using the Colosseum as a backdrop. Performers who have played at the Colosseum in recent years have included Ray Charles (May 2002), Paul McCartney (May 2003), Elton John (September 2005), and Billy Joel (July 2006).\nPhysical description.\nExterior.\nUnlike Roman theatres that were built into hillsides, the Colosseum is an entirely free-standing structure. It derives its basic exterior and interior architecture from that of two theatres back to back. It is elliptical in plan and is 189 meters (615\u00a0ft / 640 Roman feet) long, and 156 meters (510\u00a0ft / 528 Roman feet) wide, with a base area of . The height of the outer wall is 48 meters (157\u00a0ft / 165 Roman feet). The perimeter originally measured 545 meters (1,788\u00a0ft / 1,835 Roman feet). The central arena is an ellipse long and wide, surrounded by a wall high, above which rose tiers of seating.\nThe outer wall is estimated to have required over of travertine stone which were set without mortar; they were held together by 300 tons of iron clamps. However, it has suffered extensive damage over the centuries, with large segments having collapsed following earthquakes. The north side of the perimeter wall is still standing; the distinctive triangular brick wedges at each end are modern additions, having been constructed in the early 19th century to shore up the wall. The remainder of the present-day exterior of the Colosseum is in fact the original interior wall.\nThe surviving part of the outer wall's monumental fa\u00e7ade comprises three superposed storeys surmounted by a podium on which stands a tall attic, both of which are pierced by windows interspersed at regular intervals. The arcades are framed by half-columns of the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian orders, while the attic is decorated with Corinthian pilasters. Each of the arches in the second- and third-floor arcades framed statues, probably honoring divinities and other figures from Classical mythology.\nTwo hundred and forty mast corbels were positioned around the top of the attic. They originally supported a retractable awning, known as the \"velarium\", that kept the sun and rain off spectators. This consisted of a canvas-covered, net-like structure made of ropes, with a hole in the center. It covered two-thirds of the arena, and sloped down towards the center to catch the wind and provide a breeze for the audience. Sailors, specially enlisted from the Roman naval headquarters at Misenum and housed in the nearby \"Castra Misenatium\", were used to work the \"velarium\".\nThe Colosseum's huge crowd capacity made it essential that the venue could be filled or evacuated quickly. Its architects adopted solutions very similar to those used in modern stadia to deal with the same problem. The amphitheatre was ringed by eighty entrances at ground level, 76 of which were used by ordinary spectators. Each entrance and exit was numbered, as was each staircase. The northern main entrance was reserved for the Roman Emperor and his aides, whilst the other three axial entrances were most likely used by the elite. All four axial entrances were richly decorated with painted stucco reliefs, of which fragments survive. Many of the original outer entrances have disappeared with the collapse of the perimeter wall, but entrances XXIII (23) to LIIII (54) survive.\nSpectators were given tickets in the form of numbered pottery shards, which directed them to the appropriate section and row. They accessed their seats via \"vomitoria\" (singular \"vomitorium\"), passageways that opened into a tier of seats from below or behind. These quickly dispersed people into their seats and, upon conclusion of the event or in an emergency evacuation, could permit their exit within only a few minutes. The name \"vomitoria\" derived from the Latin word for a rapid discharge, from which English derives the word vomit.\nInterior seating.\nAccording to the Codex-Calendar of 354, the Colosseum could accommodate 87,000 people, although modern estimates put the figure at around 50,000. They were seated in a tiered arrangement that reflected the rigidly stratified nature of Roman society. Special boxes were provided at the north and south ends respectively for the Emperor and the Vestal Virgins, providing the best views of the arena. Flanking them at the same level was a broad platform or \"podium\" for the senatorial class, who were allowed to bring their own chairs. The names of some 5th century senators can still be seen carved into the stonework, presumably reserving areas for their use.\nThe tier above the senators, known as the \"maenianum primum\", was occupied by the non-senatorial noble class or knights (\"equites\"). The next level up, the \"maenianum secundum\", was originally reserved for ordinary Roman citizens (\"plebeians\") and was divided into two sections. The lower part (the \"immum\") was for wealthy citizens, while the upper part (the \"summum\") was for poor citizens. Specific sectors were provided for other social groups: for instance, boys with their tutors, soldiers on leave, foreign dignitaries, scribes, heralds, priests and so on. Stone (and later marble) seating was provided for the citizens and nobles, who presumably would have brought their own cushions with them. Inscriptions identified the areas reserved for specific groups.\nAnother level, the \"maenianum secundum in legneis\", was added at the very top of the building during the reign of Domitian. This comprised a gallery for the common poor, slaves and women. It would have been either standing room only, or would have had very steep wooden benches. Some groups were banned altogether from the Colosseum, notably gravediggers, actors and former gladiators.\nEach tier was divided into sections (\"maeniana\") by curved passages and low walls (\"praecinctiones\" or \"baltei\"), and were subdivided into \"cunei\", or wedges, by the steps and aisles from the vomitoria. Each row (\"gradus\") of seats was numbered, permitting each individual seat to be exactly designated by its gradus, cuneus, and number.\nArena and hypogeum.\nThe arena itself was 83\u00a0meters by 48\u00a0meters (272\u00a0ft by 157\u00a0ft / 280 by 163\u00a0Roman feet). It comprised a wooden floor covered by sand (the Latin word for sand is \"harena\" or \"arena\"), covering an elaborate underground structure called the \"hypogeum\" (literally meaning \"underground\"). The hypogeum was not part of the original construction but was ordered to be built by Emperor Domitian. Little now remains of the original arena floor, but the \"hypogeum\" is still clearly visible. It consisted of a two-level subterranean network of tunnels and cages beneath the arena where gladiators and animals were held before contests began. Eighty vertical shafts provided instant access to the arena for caged animals and scenery pieces concealed underneath; larger hinged platforms, called \"hegmata\", provided access for elephants and the like. It was restructured on numerous occasions; at least twelve different phases of construction can be seen.\nThe \"hypogeum\" was connected by tunnels to a number of points outside the Colosseum. Animals and performers were brought through the tunnel from nearby stables, with the gladiators' barracks at the Ludus Magnus to the east also being connected by tunnels. Separate tunnels were provided for the Emperor and the Vestal Virgins to permit them to enter and exit the Colosseum without needing to pass through the crowds.\nSubstantial quantities of machinery also existed in the \"hypogeum\". Elevators and pulleys raised and lowered scenery and props, as well as lifting caged animals to the surface for release. There is evidence for the existence of major hydraulic mechanisms and according to ancient accounts, it was possible to flood the arena rapidly, presumably via a connection to a nearby aqueduct. However, the construction of the hypogeum at Domitian's behest put an end to the practise of flooding, and thus also to naval battles, early in the Colosseum's existence. There is however wide debate over the practicality and logistics of this phenomenon which leads to speculation over its actuality. This is mostly because there is no physical evidence of naumachiae at the Colosseum remains.\nSupporting buildings.\nThe Colosseum and its activities supported a substantial industry in the area. In addition to the amphitheatre itself, many other buildings nearby were linked to the games. Immediately to the east is the remains of the \"Ludus Magnus\", a training school for gladiators. This was connected to the Colosseum by an underground passage, to allow easy access for the gladiators. The \"Ludus Magnus\" had its own miniature training arena, which was itself a popular attraction for Roman spectators. Other training schools were in the same area, including the \"Ludus Matutinus\" (Morning School), where fighters of animals were trained, plus the Dacian and Gallic Schools.\nAlso nearby were the \"Armamentarium\", comprising an armory to store weapons; the \"Summum Choragium\", where machinery was stored; the \"Sanitarium\", which had facilities to treat wounded gladiators; and the \"Spoliarium\", where bodies of dead gladiators were stripped of their armor and disposed of.\nAround the perimeter of the Colosseum, at a distance of from the perimeter, was a series of tall stone posts, with five remaining on the eastern side. Various explanations have been advanced for their presence; they may have been a religious boundary, or an outer boundary for ticket checks, or an anchor for the \"velarium\" or awning.\nThe Commodus Passage, named after Commodus, was used by Roman emperors to enter the Colosseum discreetly. A failed assassination attempt against Commodus occurred in the passage. It was rediscovered in the 1810s. Restoration work which restored decorative stuccoes and added a walkway was conducted on the passage from October 2024 to September 2025. The passage will be opened to the public on 27 October 2025. Another restoration project is planned to begin in 2026.\nUse.\nThe Colosseum was used to host gladiatorial shows as well as a variety of other events. The shows, called , were always given by private individuals rather than the state. They had a strong religious element but were also demonstrations of power and family prestige and were immensely popular. Another major attraction was the animal hunt, or \"venatio\". This utilized a great variety of wild beasts, mainly imported from Africa and the Middle East, and included creatures such as rhinoceros, hippopotamuses, elephants, giraffes, aurochs, wisents, Barbary lions, panthers, leopards, bears, Caspian tigers, crocodiles and ostriches. Battles and hunts were often staged amid elaborate sets with movable trees and buildings. These events could be huge in scale; Trajan is said to have celebrated his victories in Dacia in 107 with contests involving 11,000 animals and 10,000 gladiators over the course of 123 days. During lunch intervals, executions \"ad bestias\" would be staged. Those condemned to death would be sent into the arena, naked and unarmed, to face the beasts of death which would literally tear them to pieces. Acrobats and magicians would also perform, usually during the intervals.\nDuring the early days of the Colosseum, ancient writers recorded that the building was used for \"naumachiae\" (more properly known as \"navalia proelia\") or simulated sea battles. Accounts of the inaugural games held by Titus in AD 80 describe it being filled with water for a display of specially trained swimming horses and bulls. There is also an account of a re-enactment of a famous sea battle between the Corcyrean (Corfiot) Greeks and the Corinthians. This has been the subject of some debate among historians; although providing the water would not have been a problem, it is unclear how the arena could have been waterproofed, nor would there have been enough space in the arena for the warships to move around. It has been suggested that the reports either have the location wrong or that the Colosseum originally featured a wide floodable channel down its central axis (which would later have been replaced by the hypogeum).\n\"Sylvae\" or recreations of natural scenes were also held in the arena. Painters, technicians and architects would construct a simulation of a forest with real trees and bushes planted in the arena's floor, and animals would then be introduced. Such scenes might be used simply to display a natural environment for the urban population, or could otherwise be used as the backdrop for hunts or dramas depicting episodes from mythology. They were also occasionally used for executions in which the hero of the story \u2014 played by a condemned person \u2014 was killed in one of various gruesome but mythologically authentic ways, such as being mauled by beasts or burned to death.\nModern use.\nBeneath the Colosseum, a network of subterranean passageways that were once used for transporting wild animals and gladiators to the arena, opened to the public in summer 2010.\nThe Colosseum is also the site of Roman Catholic ceremonies in the 20th and 21st centuries. For instance, Pope Benedict XVI led the Stations of the Cross called the Scriptural Way of the Cross (which calls for more meditation) at the Colosseum on Good Fridays.\nRestoration.\nIn 2011, Diego Della Valle, head of the shoe firm Tod's, entered into an agreement with local officials to sponsor a \u20ac25\u00a0million restoration of the Colosseum. Work was planned to begin at the end of 2011, taking up to two and a half years. Due to the controversial nature of using a public\u2013private partnership to fund the restoration, work was delayed and began in 2013. The restoration is the first full cleaning and repair in the Colosseum's history. The first stage is to clean and restore the Colosseum's arcaded fa\u00e7ade and replace the metal enclosures that block the ground-level arches. After three years, the work was completed on 1\u00a0July 2016, when the Italian minister of culture, Dario Franceschini, also announced that the funds have been committed to replace the floors by the end of 2018. These will provide a stage that Franceschini says will be used for \"cultural events of the highest level.\" The project also includes creating a services center and restoring the galleries and underground spaces inside the Colosseum. Since 1\u00a0November 2017, the top two levels have been opened for guided visits. The fourth level held the marketplace, and the top fifth tier is where the poorest citizens, the plebeians, gathered and watched the show, bringing picnics for the day-long event.\nSignificance in Christianity.\nThe Colosseum is generally regarded by Christians as a site of the martyrdom of large numbers of believers during the persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire, as evidenced by Church history and tradition. On the other hand, other scholars believe that the majority of martyrdoms may have occurred at other venues within the city of Rome, rather than at the Colosseum, citing a lack of still-intact physical evidence or historical records. These scholars assert that \"some Christians were executed as common criminals in the Colosseum\u2014their crime being refusal to reverence the Roman gods\", but most Christian martyrs of the early Church were executed for their faith at the Circus Maximus. According to Irenaeus (died about 202), Ignatius of Antioch was fed to the lions in Rome around 107 A.D. and although Irenaeus says nothing about this happening at the Colosseum, tradition ascribes it to that place.\nIn the Middle Ages, the Colosseum was not regarded as a monument, and was used as what some modern sources label a \"quarry,\" which is to say that stones from the Colosseum were taken for the building of other sacred sites. This fact is used to support the idea that, at a time when sites associated with martyrs were highly venerated the Colosseum was not being treated as a sacred site. It was not included in the itineraries compiled for the use of pilgrims nor in works such as the 12th century \"Mirabilia Urbis Romae\" (\"Marvels of the City of Rome\"), which claims the Circus Flaminius \u2013 but not the Colosseum \u2013 as the site of martyrdoms. Part of the structure was inhabited by a Christian religious order, but it is not known whether this was for any particular religious reason.\nPope Pius V (1566\u20131572) is said to have recommended that pilgrims gather sand from the arena of the Colosseum to serve as a relic, on the grounds that it was impregnated with the blood of martyrs, although some of his contemporaries did not share his conviction. A century later Fioravante Martinelli listed the Colosseum at the head of a list of places sacred to the martyrs in his 1653 book \"Roma ex ethnica sacra\". Martinelli's book evidently had an effect on public opinion; in response to Cardinal Altieri's proposal some years later to turn the Colosseum into a bullring, Carlo Tomassi published a pamphlet in protest against what he regarded as an act of desecration. The ensuing controversy persuaded Pope Clement X to close the Colosseum's external arcades and declare it a sanctuary.\nAt the insistence of St. Leonard of Port Maurice, Pope Benedict XIV (1740\u20131758) forbade the quarrying of the Colosseum and erected Stations of the Cross around the arena, which remained until February 1874. Benedict Joseph Labre spent the later years of his life within the walls of the Colosseum, living on alms, before he died in 1783. Several 19th century popes funded repair and restoration work on the Colosseum, and it still retains its Christian connection today. A Christian cross stands in the Colosseum, with a plaque, stating:\nThe amphitheater, one consecrated to triumphs, entertainments, and the impious worship of pagan gods, is now dedicated to the sufferings of the martyrs purified from impious superstitions.\nOther Christian crosses stand in several points around the arena and every Good Friday the Pope leads a Via Crucis procession to the amphitheater.\nFlora.\nThe Colosseum has a wide and well-documented history of flora ever since Domenico Panaroli made the first catalogue of its plants in 1643. Since then, 684 species have been identified there. The peak was in 1855 (420 species). Attempts were made in 1871 to eradicate the vegetation, because of concerns over the damage that was being caused to the masonry, but much of it has returned. Two hundred forty-two species have been counted today and of the species first identified by Panaroli, 200 remain.\nThe variation of plants can be explained by the change of climate in Rome through the centuries, as well as by bird migration, flower blooming, and the growth of Rome that caused the Colosseum to become embedded within the modern city centre rather than on the outskirts of the ancient city. Deliberate import of animal species is another contributing cause, as seeds were unwittingly carried either on the fur or in the feces of animals brought there from all corners of the empire.\nIn popular culture.\nThe Colosseum has appeared in numerous films, artworks and games. It is featured in films such as \"Roman Holiday\", \"Gladiator\", \"The Way of the Dragon\", \"Jumper\", and \"\".\nSeveral architectural works have also been modelled on or inspired by, the Colosseum. These include:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "49604", "revid": "28481209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49604", "title": "Hearing loss", "text": "Partial or total inability to hear\nMedical condition&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Infobox/styles-images.css\" /&gt;\nHearing loss is a partial or total inability to hear. Hearing loss may be present at birth or acquired at any time afterwards. Hearing loss may occur in one or both ears. In children, hearing problems can affect the ability to acquire spoken language. In adults, it can create difficulties with social interaction and at work. Hearing loss can be temporary or permanent. Hearing loss related to age usually affects both ears and is due to cochlear hair cell loss. In some people, particularly older people, hearing loss can result in loneliness.\nHearing loss may be caused by a number of factors, including: genetics, ageing, exposure to noise, some infections, birth complications, trauma to the ear or brain, and certain medications or toxins. A common condition that results in hearing loss is chronic ear infections. Certain infections during pregnancy, such as cytomegalovirus, syphilis and rubella, may also cause hearing loss in the child. Hearing loss is diagnosed when hearing testing finds that a person is unable to hear 25 decibels in at least one ear. Testing for poor hearing is recommended for all newborns. Hearing loss can be categorized as minimal/slight (15 to 25 dB), mild (25 to 40 dB), moderate (41 to 55\u00a0dB), moderate-severe (56 to 70\u00a0dB), severe (71 to 90\u00a0dB), or profound (greater than 90\u00a0dB). There are three main types of hearing loss: conductive hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss, and mixed hearing loss.\nAbout half of hearing loss globally is preventable through public health measures. Such practices include immunization, proper care around pregnancy, avoiding loud noise, and avoiding certain medications. The World Health Organization recommends that young people limit exposure to loud sounds and the use of personal audio players to an hour a day to limit noise exposure. Early identification and support are particularly important in children. For many, hearing aids, sign language, cochlear implants and subtitles are useful. Lip reading is another useful skill some develop. Access to hearing aids, however, is limited in many areas of the world.\nAccess and affordability.\nAccess to hearing aids and hearing care varies widely by country, with affordability often cited as a major barrier to treatment. In New Zealand, public funding schemes provide partial or full subsidies for hearing aids depending on eligibility criteria, such as age, severity of hearing loss, and financial need.\nTo further improve access, some providers in New Zealand, such as Resonate Health, have introduced subscription-based hearing aid models. These typically bundle device costs, servicing, and follow-up care into a monthly fee, reducing the upfront cost of treatment.\nAs of 2013, hearing loss affects about 1.1 billion people to some degree. It causes disability in about 466 million people (5% of the global population), and moderate to severe disability in 124 million people. Of those with moderate to severe disability 108 million live in low and middle-income countries. Of those with hearing loss, it began during childhood for 65 million. Those who use sign language and are members of Deaf culture may see themselves as having a difference rather than a disability. Many members of Deaf culture reject cochlear implants and some within this community view them with concern as they have the potential to eliminate their culture.\nDefinition.\nUse of the terms \"hearing impaired\", \"deaf-mute\", or \"deaf and dumb\" to describe deaf and hard-of-hearing people is discouraged by many in the deaf community as well as advocacy organizations, as they are offensive to many deaf and hard-of-hearing people.\nHearing standards.\nHuman hearing extends in frequency from 20 to 20,000\u00a0Hz, and in intensity from 0\u00a0dB to 120\u00a0dB HL or more. 0\u00a0dB does not represent the absence of sound, but rather the softest sound an average unimpaired human ear can hear; some people can hear down to \u22125 or even \u221210\u00a0dB. Sound is generally uncomfortably loud above 90\u00a0dB and 115\u00a0dB represents the threshold of pain. The ear does not hear all frequencies equally well: hearing sensitivity peaks around 3,000\u00a0Hz. There are many qualities of human hearing besides frequency range and intensity that cannot easily be measured quantitatively. However, for many practical purposes, normal hearing is defined by a frequency versus intensity graph, or audiogram, charting sensitivity thresholds of hearing at defined frequencies. Due to the cumulative impact of age and exposure to noise and other acoustic insults, 'typical' hearing may not be normal.\nSigns and symptoms.\nThe presentation is as follows:\nHearing loss is sensory, but may have accompanying symptoms:\nThere may also be accompanying secondary symptoms:\nComplications.\nHearing loss is associated with Alzheimer's disease and dementia. The risk increases with the degree of hearing loss. A systematic review and meta analysis assessed the link between hearing loss and dementia subtypes. Hearing loss was linked to an increased risk of mild to severe cognitive problems, including mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. Hearing loss was not linked to an increased risk of vascular dementia. There are several hypotheses, including cognitive resources being redistributed to hearing and social isolation from hearing loss, having a negative effect. According to preliminary data, hearing aid usage can slow down the decline in cognitive functions.\nHearing loss is responsible for causing thalamocortical dysrhythmia in the brain, which is a cause for several neurological disorders, including tinnitus and visual snow syndrome.\nCognitive decline.\nHearing loss is an increasing concern, especially in aging populations. The prevalence of hearing loss increases about two-fold for each decade increase in age after age 40. While the secular trend might decrease individual level risk of developing hearing loss, the prevalence of hearing loss is expected to rise due to the aging population in the US. Another concern about the aging process is cognitive decline, which may progress to mild cognitive impairment and eventually dementia. The association between hearing loss and cognitive decline has been studied in various research settings. Despite the variability in study design and protocols, the majority of these studies have found a consistent association between age-related hearing loss and cognitive decline, cognitive impairment, and dementia. The association between age-related hearing loss and Alzheimer's disease was found to be nonsignificant. This finding supports the hypothesis that hearing loss is associated with dementia independent of Alzheimer's pathology. There are several hypotheses about the underlying causal mechanism for age-related hearing loss and cognitive decline. One hypothesis is that this association can be explained by common etiology or shared neurobiological pathology with decline in other physiological system. Another possible cognitive mechanism emphasize on individual's cognitive load. As people develop hearing loss with aging, the cognitive load demanded by auditory perception increases, which may lead to changes in brain structure and eventually to dementia. One other hypothesis suggests that the association between hearing loss and cognitive decline is mediated through various psychosocial factors, such as decrease in social contact and increase in social isolation. Findings on the association between hearing loss and dementia have significant public health implications, since about 9% of dementia cases are associated with hearing loss.\nFalls.\nThose with hearing loss are at a higher risk of falling. There is also a potential dose\u2013response relationship between hearing loss and falls\u2014greater severity of hearing loss is associated with increased difficulties in postural control and increased prevalence of falls. The underlying causal link between the association of hearing loss and falls is yet to be elucidated. Several hypotheses indicate that there may be a common process between the decline in auditory system and the increase in incident falls, driven by physiological, cognitive, and behavioral factors. This evidence suggests that treating hearing loss has the potential to increase health-related quality of life in older adults.Falls have important health implications, especially for an aging population, where they can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Elderly people are particularly vulnerable to the consequences of injuries caused by falls, since older individuals typically have greater bone fragility and poorer protective reflexes. Fall-related injury can also lead to burdens on the financial and health care systems. In literature, age-related hearing loss is found to be significantly associated with incident falls. \nDepression.\nHearing loss can contribute to a decrease in health-related quality of life, an increase in social isolation, and a decline in social engagement, which are all risk factors for developing depression symptoms. Depression is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In older adults, the suicide rate is higher than it is for younger adults, and more suicide cases are attributable to depression. Some chronic diseases are found to be significantly associated with risk of developing depression, such as coronary heart disease, pulmonary disease, vision loss and hearing loss. \nSpoken language ability.\nPrelingual deafness is profound hearing loss that is sustained before the acquisition of language, which can occur due to a congenital condition or through hearing loss before birth or in early infancy. Prelingual deafness impairs an individual's ability to acquire a \"spoken\" language in children, but deaf children can acquire spoken language through support from cochlear implants (sometimes combined with hearing aids). Non-signing (hearing) parents of deaf babies (90\u201395% of cases) usually go with oral approach without the support of sign language, as these families lack previous experience with sign language and cannot competently provide it to their children without learning it themselves. This may in some cases (late implantation or not sufficient benefit from cochlear implants) bring the risk of language deprivation for the deaf baby because the deaf baby would not have a sign language if the child is unable to acquire spoken language successfully. The 5\u201310% of cases of deaf babies born into signing families have the potential to develop age-appropriate language due to early exposure to a \"sign language\" by sign-competent parents. Thus, they have the potential to meet language milestones in sign language instead of spoken language.\nPost-lingual deafness is hearing loss that is sustained after the acquisition of language, which can occur due to disease, trauma, or as a side-effect of a medicine. Typically, hearing loss is gradual and often detected by family and friends of affected individuals long before the patients themselves will acknowledge the disability. Post-lingual deafness is far more common than pre-lingual deafness. Those who lose their hearing later in life, such as in late adolescence or adulthood, face their own challenges, living with the adaptations that allow them to live independently.\nCauses.\nHearing loss has multiple causes, including ageing, genetics, perinatal problems, and acquired causes such as noise and disease. For some kinds of hearing loss, the cause may be classified as of unknown cause.\nThere is a progressive loss of ability to hear high frequencies with aging, known as presbycusis. For men, this can start as early as 25, and for women at 30. Although genetically variable, it is a normal concomitant of ageing. It is distinct from hearing losses caused by noise exposure, toxins or disease agents. Common conditions that can increase the risk of hearing loss in elderly people are high blood pressure, diabetes (hearing loss in diabetes), or the use of certain medications harmful to the ear. While everyone loses hearing with age, the amount and type of hearing loss is variable.\nNoise-induced hearing loss (NIHL), also known as acoustic trauma, typically manifests as elevated hearing thresholds (i.e., less sensitivity or muting). Noise exposure is the cause of approximately half of all cases of hearing loss, causing some degree of problems in 5% of the population globally. The majority of hearing loss is not due to age, but due to noise exposure. Various governmental, industry and standards organizations set noise standards. Many people are unaware of the presence of environmental sound at damaging levels or of the level at which sound becomes harmful. Common sources of damaging noise levels include car stereos, children's toys, motor vehicles, crowds, lawn and maintenance equipment, power tools, gun use, musical instruments, and even hair dryers. Noise damage is cumulative; all sources of damage must be considered to assess risk. In the US, 12.5% of children aged 6\u201319 years have permanent hearing damage from excessive noise exposure. The World Health Organization estimates that half of those between 12 and 35 are at risk from using personal audio devices that are too loud. Hearing loss in adolescents may be caused by loud noise from toys, music by headphones, and concerts or events.\nHearing loss can be inherited. Around 75\u201380% of all these cases are inherited by recessive genes, 20\u201325% are inherited by dominant genes, 1\u20132% are inherited by X-linked patterns, and fewer than 1% are inherited by mitochondrial inheritance. Syndromic deafness occurs when there are other signs or medical problems aside from deafness in an individual, such as Usher syndrome, Stickler syndrome, Waardenburg syndrome, Alport's syndrome, and neurofibromatosis type 2. Nonsyndromic deafness occurs when there are no other signs or medical problems associated with the deafness in an individual.\nFetal alcohol spectrum disorders are reported to cause hearing loss in up to 64% of infants born to alcoholic mothers, from the ototoxic effect on the developing fetus, plus malnutrition during pregnancy from the excess alcohol intake. Premature birth can be associated with sensorineural hearing loss because of an increased risk of hypoxia, hyperbilirubinaemia, ototoxic medication, and infection, as well as noise exposure in the neonatal units. Hearing loss in premature babies is often discovered far later than similar hearing loss would be in a full-term baby because, normally, babies are given a hearing test within 48 hours of birth. Doctors must wait until the premature baby is medically stable before testing hearing, which can be months after birth. The risk of hearing loss is greatest for those weighing less than 1500\u00a0g at birth.\nDisorders responsible for hearing loss include auditory neuropathy, Down syndrome, Charcot\u2013Marie\u2013Tooth disease variant 1E, autoimmune disease, multiple sclerosis, meningitis, cholesteatoma, otosclerosis, perilymph fistula, M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, recurring ear infections, strokes, superior semicircular canal dehiscence, Pierre Robin, Treacher-Collins, Usher Syndrome, Pendred Syndrome, and Turner syndrome, syphilis, vestibular schwannoma, and viral infections such as measles, mumps, congenital rubella (also called German measles) syndrome, several varieties of herpes viruses, HIV/AIDS, and West Nile virus.\nSome medications may reversibly or irreversibly affect hearing. These medications are considered ototoxic. This includes loop diuretics such as furosemide and bumetanide, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), both over-the-counter (aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen) as well as prescription (celecoxib, diclofenac, etc.), paracetamol, quinine, and macrolide antibiotics. Others may cause permanent hearing loss. The most important group is the aminoglycosides (main member gentamicin) and platinum based chemotherapeutics such as cisplatin and carboplatin.\nIn addition to medications, hearing loss can also result from specific chemicals in the environment: metals, such as lead; solvents, such as toluene (found in crude oil, gasoline and automobile exhaust, for example); and asphyxiants. Combined with noise, these ototoxic chemicals have an additive effect on a person's hearing loss. Hearing loss due to chemicals starts in the high-frequency range and is irreversible. It damages the cochlea with lesions and degrades central portions of the auditory system. For some ototoxic chemical exposures, particularly styrene, the risk of hearing loss can be higher than being exposed to noise alone. The effects are greatest when the combined exposure includes impulse noise. A 2018 informational bulletin by the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) introduces the issue, provides examples of ototoxic chemicals, lists the industries and occupations at risk and provides prevention information.\nThere can be damage either to the ear, whether the external or middle ear, to the cochlea, or to the brain centers that process the aural information conveyed by the ears. Damage to the middle ear may include fracture and discontinuity of the ossicular chain. Damage to the inner ear (cochlea) may be caused by temporal bone fracture. People who sustain a head injury are especially vulnerable to hearing loss or tinnitus, either temporary or permanent.\nPathophysiology.\nSound waves reach the outer ear and are conducted down the ear canal to the eardrum, causing it to vibrate. The vibrations are transferred by the 3 tiny ear bones of the middle ear to the fluid in the inner ear. The fluid moves hair cells (stereocilia), and their movement generates nerve impulses which are then taken to the brain by the cochlear nerve. The auditory nerve takes the impulses to the brainstem, which sends the impulses to the midbrain. Finally, the signal goes to the auditory cortex of the temporal lobe to be interpreted as sound.\nHearing loss is most commonly caused by long-term exposure to loud noises, from recreation or from work, that damage the hair cells, which do not grow back on their own.\nOlder people may lose their hearing from prolonged exposure to noise, changes in the inner ear, the middle ear, or along the nerves from the ear to the brain.\nDiagnosis.\nIdentification of a hearing loss is usually conducted by a general practitioner medical doctor, otolaryngologist, certified and licensed audiologist, school or industrial audiometrist, or other audiometric technician. Diagnosis of the cause of a hearing loss is carried out by a specialist physician (audiovestibular physician) or otorhinolaryngologist.\nHearing loss is generally measured by playing generated or recorded sounds and determining whether the person can hear them. Hearing sensitivity varies according to the frequency of sounds. To take this into account, hearing sensitivity can be measured for a range of frequencies and plotted on an audiogram. Another method for quantifying hearing loss is a hearing test using a mobile application or hearing aid application, which includes a hearing test. Hearing diagnosis using mobile application is similar to the audiometry procedure. Audiograms, obtained using mobile applications, can be used to adjust hearing aid applications. Another method for quantifying hearing loss is a speech-in-noise test. which gives an indication of how well one can understand speech in a noisy environment. Otoacoustic emissions test is an objective hearing test that may be administered to toddlers and children too young to cooperate in a conventional hearing test. Auditory brainstem response testing is an electrophysiological test used to test for hearing deficits caused by pathology within the ear, the cochlear nerve, and also within the brainstem.\nA case history (usually a written form, with a questionnaire) can provide valuable information about the context of the hearing loss, and indicate what kind of diagnostic procedures to employ. Examinations include otoscopy, tympanometry, and differential testing with the Weber, Rinne, Bing and Schwabach tests. In case of infection or inflammation, blood or other bodily fluids may be submitted for laboratory analysis. MRI and CT scans can be useful to identify the pathology of many causes of hearing loss.\nHearing loss is categorized by severity, type, and configuration. Furthermore, a hearing loss may exist in only one ear (unilateral) or in both ears (bilateral). Hearing loss can be temporary or permanent, sudden or progressive. The \"severity\" of a hearing loss is ranked according to ranges of nominal thresholds in which a sound must be so it can be detected by an individual. It is measured in decibels of hearing loss, or dB HL. There are three main \"types\" of hearing loss: conductive hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss, and mixed hearing loss. An additional problem which is increasingly recognised is auditory processing disorder, which is not a hearing loss as such but a difficulty perceiving sound. The shape of an audiogram shows the relative \"configuration\" of the hearing loss, such as a Carhart notch for otosclerosis, 'noise' notch for noise-induced damage, high frequency rolloff for presbycusis, or a flat audiogram for conductive hearing loss. In conjunction with speech audiometry, it may indicate central auditory processing disorder, or the presence of a schwannoma or other tumor.\nPeople with unilateral hearing loss or single-sided deafness (SSD) have difficulty in hearing conversation on their impaired side, localizing sound, and understanding speech in the presence of background noise. One reason for the hearing problems these patients often experience is due to the head shadow effect.\nIdiopathic sudden hearing loss is a condition where a person as an immediate decrease in the sensitivity of their sensorineural hearing that does not have a known cause. This type of loss is usually only on one side (unilateral), and the severity of the loss varies. A common threshold of a \"loss of at least 30 dB in three connected frequencies within 72 hours\" is sometimes used; however, there is no universal definition or international consensus for diagnosing idiopathic sudden hearing loss.\nPrevention.\nIt is estimated that half of the cases of hearing loss are preventable. About 60% of hearing loss in children under the age of 15 can be avoided. There are several effective preventative strategies, including: immunization against rubella to prevent congenital rubella syndrome, immunization against \"H. influenza\" and \"S. pneumoniae\" to reduce cases of meningitis, and avoiding or protecting against excessive noise exposure. The World Health Organization also recommends immunization against measles, mumps, and meningitis, efforts to prevent premature birth, and avoidance of certain medication as prevention. World Hearing Day is a yearly event to promote actions to prevent hearing damage.\nAvoiding exposure to loud noise can help prevent noise-induced hearing loss. 18% of adults exposed to loud noise at work for five years or more report hearing loss in both ears as compared to 5.5% of adults who were not exposed to loud noise at work. Different programs exist for specific populations such as school-age children, adolescents and workers. But the HPD (without individual selection, training and fit testing) does not significantly reduce the risk of hearing loss. The use of antioxidants is being studied for the prevention of noise-induced hearing loss, particularly for scenarios in which noise exposure cannot be reduced, such as during military operations.\nWorkplace noise regulation.\nNoise is widely recognized as an occupational hazard. In the United States, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) work together to provide standards and enforcement on workplace noise levels. The hierarchy of hazard controls demonstrates the different levels of controls to reduce or eliminate exposure to noise and prevent hearing loss, including engineering controls and personal protective equipment (PPE). Other programs and initiative have been created to prevent hearing loss in the workplace. For example, the Safe-in-Sound Award was created to recognize organizations that can demonstrate results of successful noise control and other interventions. Additionally, the Buy Quiet program was created to encourage employers to purchase quieter machinery and tools. By purchasing less noisy power tools like those found on the NIOSH Power Tools Database and limiting exposure to ototoxic chemicals, great strides can be made in preventing hearing loss.\nCompanies can also provide personal hearing protector devices tailored to both the worker and the type of employment. Some hearing protectors universally block out all noise, and some allow for certain noises to be heard. Workers are more likely to wear hearing protector devices when they are properly fitted.\nOften, interventions to prevent noise-induced hearing loss have many components. A 2017 Cochrane review found that stricter legislation might reduce noise levels. Providing workers with information on their sound exposure levels was not shown to decrease noise exposure. Ear protection, when used correctly, can reduce noise to safer levels. Often, providing them is not sufficient to prevent hearing loss. Engineering noise out and other solutions, such as proper maintenance of equipment, can lead to noise reduction, but further field studies on resulting noise exposures following such interventions are needed. Other possible solutions include improved enforcement of existing legislation and better implementation of well-designed prevention programmes, which have not yet been proven conclusively to be effective. The Cochrane Review concluded that further research could modify what is now regarding the effectiveness of the evaluated interventions.\nThe Institute for Occupational Safety and Health of the German Social Accident Insurance has created a hearing impairment calculator based on the ISO 1999 model for studying threshold shift in relatively homogeneous groups of people, such as workers with the same type of job. The ISO 1999 model estimates how much hearing impairment in a group can be ascribed to age and noise exposure. The result is calculated via an algebraic equation that uses the A-weighted sound exposure level, how many years the people were exposed to this noise, how old the people are, and their sex. The model's estimations are only useful for those without hearing loss due to non-job-related exposure and can be used for prevention activities.\nScreening.\nThe United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends neonatal hearing screening for all newborns, as the first three years of life are believed to be the most important for language development. Universal neonatal hearing screenings have now been widely implemented across the U.S., with rates of newborn screening increasing from less than 3% in the early 1990s to 98% in 2009. Newborns whose screening reveals a high index of suspicion of hearing loss are referred for additional diagnostic testing to provide early intervention and access to language.\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics advises that children should have their hearing tested several times throughout their schooling:\nWhile the American College of Physicians indicated that there is not enough evidence to determine the utility of screening in adults over 50 years old who do not have any symptoms, the American Language, Speech Pathology and Hearing Association recommends that adults should be screened at least every decade through age 50 and at three-year intervals thereafter, to minimize the detrimental effects of the untreated condition on quality of life. For the same reason, the US Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion included as one of Healthy People 2020 objectives: to increase the proportion of persons who have had a hearing examination.\nManagement.\nManagement depends on the specific cause, if known, as well as the extent, type, and configuration of the hearing loss. Sudden hearing loss due to an underlying nerve problem may be treated with corticosteroids.\nMost hearing loss that results from age and noise is progressive and irreversible, and there are currently no approved or recommended treatments. A few specific kinds of hearing loss are amenable to surgical treatment. In other cases, treatment is addressed to underlying pathologies, but any hearing loss incurred may be permanent. Some management options include hearing aids, cochlear implants, middle ear implants, assistive technology, and closed captioning; in movie theaters, a Hearing Impaired (HI) audio track may be available via headphones to better hear dialog.\nThis choice depends on the severity and type of hearing loss and personal preference. Hearing aid applications are one of the options for hearing loss management. For people with bilateral hearing loss, it is not clear if bilateral hearing aids (hearing aids in both ears) are better than a unilateral hearing aid (hearing aid in one ear).\nIdiopathic sudden hearing loss.\nFor people with idiopathic sudden hearing loss, various treatment approaches have been suggested that are usually based on the suspected cause of the sudden hearing loss. Treatment approaches may include corticosteroid medications, rheological drugs, vasodilators, anesthetics, and other medications chosen based on the suspected underlying pathology that caused the sudden hearing loss. The evidence supporting most treatment options for idiopathic sudden hearing loss is very weak, and the adverse effects of these different medications are a consideration when deciding on a treatment approach.\nEpidemiology.\nGlobally, hearing loss affects about 10% of the population to some degree. It caused moderate to severe disability in 124.2\u00a0million people as of 2004 (107.9\u00a0million of whom are in low and middle-income countries). Of these 65\u00a0million acquired the condition during childhood. At birth ~3 per 1000 in developed countries and more than 6 per 1000 in developing countries have hearing problems.\nHearing loss increases with age. In those between 20 and 35, the rate of hearing loss is 3% while in those 44 to 55, it is 11% and in those 65 to 85, it is 43%.\nA 2017 report by the World Health Organization estimated the costs of unaddressed hearing loss and the cost-effectiveness of interventions, for the healthcare sector, the education sector, and as broad societal costs. Globally, the annual cost of unaddressed hearing loss was estimated to be in the range of $750\u2013790 billion international dollars.\nThe International Organization for Standardization (ISO) developed the ISO 1999 standards for the estimation of hearing thresholds and noise-induced hearing impairment. They used data from two noise and hearing study databases, one presented by Burns and Robinson (\"Hearing and Noise in Industry,\" Her Majesty's Stationery Office, London, 1970) and by Passchier-Vermeer (1968). As race are some of the factors that can affect the expected distribution of pure-tone hearing thresholds several other national or regional datasets exist, from Sweden, Norway, South Korea, the United States and Spain.\nIn the United States, hearing is one of the health outcomes measured by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a survey research program conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics. It examines health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States. Data from the United States in 2011\u20132012 found that rates of hearing loss have declined among adults aged 20 to 69 years, when compared with the results from an earlier time period (1999\u20132004). It also found that adult hearing loss is associated with increasing age, sex, ethnicity, educational level, and noise exposure. Nearly one in four adults had audiometric results suggesting noise-induced hearing loss. Almost one in four adults who reported excellent or good hearing had a similar pattern (5.5% on both sides and 18% on one side). Among people who reported exposure to loud noise at work, almost one-third had such changes.\nSocial and cultural aspects.\nPeople with extreme hearing loss may communicate through sign languages. Sign languages convey meaning through manual communication and body language instead of acoustically conveyed sound patterns. This involves the simultaneous combination of hand shapes, orientation, and movement of the hands, arms, or body, and facial expressions to express a speaker's thoughts. \"Sign languages are based on the idea that vision is the most useful tool a deaf person has to communicate and receive information\".\nDeaf culture refers to a tight-knit cultural group of people whose primary language is signed, and who practice social and cultural norms which are distinct from those of the surrounding hearing community. This community does not automatically include all those who are clinically or legally deaf, nor does it exclude every hearing person. According to Baker and Padden, it includes any person or persons who \"identifies him/herself as a member of the Deaf community, and other members accept that person as a part of the community,\" an example being children of deaf adults with normal hearing ability. It includes the set of social beliefs, behaviors, art, literary traditions, history, values, and shared institutions of communities that are influenced by deafness and which use sign languages as the main means of communication. Members of the Deaf community tend to view deafness as a difference in human experience rather than a disability or disease. When used as a cultural label especially within the culture, the word \"deaf\" is often written with a capital \"D\" and referred to as \"big\u00a0D Deaf\" in speech and sign. When used as a label for the audiological condition, it is written with a lower case \"d\".\nMultiple educational institutions for both deaf and Deaf people usually use sign language as the main language of instruction. Famous institutions include Gallaudet University and the National Technical Institute for the Deaf in the US, and the National University Corporation of Tsukuba University of Technology in Japan.\nResearch.\nStem cell transplant and gene therapy.\nA 2005 study achieved successful regrowth of cochlear cells in guinea pigs. However, the regrowth of cochlear hair cells does not imply the restoration of hearing sensitivity, as the sensory cells may or may not make connections with neurons that carry the signals from hair cells to the brain. A 2008 study has shown that gene therapy targeting Atoh1 can cause hair cell growth and attract neuronal processes in embryonic mice. Some hope that a similar treatment will one day ameliorate hearing loss in humans.\nRecent research reported in 2012 achieved growth of cochlear nerve cells resulting in hearing improvements in gerbils by using stem cells. Also reported in 2013 was regrowth of hair cells in deaf adult mice using a drug intervention resulting in hearing improvement. The Hearing Health Foundation in the US has embarked on a project called the Hearing Restoration Project. Also Action on Hearing Loss in the UK is also aiming to restore hearing.\nResearchers reported in 2015 that genetically deaf mice which were treated with TMC1 gene therapy recovered some of their hearing. In 2017, additional studies were performed to treat Usher syndrome and here, a recombinant adeno-associated virus seemed to outperform the older vectors.\nAudition.\nBesides research studies seeking to improve hearing, such as those listed above, studies on the deaf have also been conducted to understand audition. Pijil and Schwarz (2005) conducted their study on the deaf who lost their hearing later in life and, hence, used cochlear implants to hear. They discovered further evidence for rate coding of pitch, a system that codes for information about frequencies by the rate at which neurons fire in the auditory system, especially for lower frequencies, as they are coded by the frequencies that neurons fire from the basilar membrane synchronously. Their results showed that the subjects could identify different pitches that were proportional to the frequency stimulated by a single electrode. The lower frequencies were detected when the basilar membrane was stimulated, providing even further evidence for rate coding.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "49607", "revid": "11096", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49607", "title": "Jargon", "text": "Specialist terminology often understood only by a certain group\nJargon, or technical language, is the specialized terminology associated with a particular field or area of activity. Jargon is normally employed in a particular communicative context and may not be well understood outside that context. The context is usually a particular occupation (that is, a certain trade, profession, vernacular or academic field), but any ingroup can have jargon. The key characteristic that distinguishes jargon from the rest of a language is its specialized vocabulary, which includes terms and definitions of words that are unique to the context, and terms used in a narrower and more exact sense than when used in colloquial language. This can lead outgroups to misunderstand communication attempts. Jargon is sometimes understood as a form of technical slang and then distinguished from the official terminology used in a particular field of activity.\nThe terms \"jargon\", \"slang,\" and \"argot\" are not consistently differentiated in the literature; different authors interpret these concepts in varying ways. According to one definition, jargon differs from slang in being secretive in nature; according to another understanding, it is specifically associated with professional and technical circles. Some sources, however, treat these terms as synonymous. The use of jargon became more popular around the sixteenth century attracting persons from different career paths. This led to there being printed copies available on the various forms of jargon.\nSpecifics.\nJargon, also referred to as \"technical language\", is \"the technical terminology or characteristic idiom of a special activity or group\". Most jargon is \"technical terminology\" (\"technical terms\"), involving \"terms of art\" or \"industry terms\", with particular meaning within a specific industry. The primary driving forces in the creation of technical jargon are precision, efficiency of communication, and professionalism. Terms and phrases that are considered jargon have meaningful definitions, and through frequency of use, can become catchwords.\nWhile jargon allows greater efficiency in communication among those familiar with it, jargon also raises the threshold of comprehensibility for outsiders. This is usually accepted as an unavoidable trade-off but it may also be used as a means of social exclusion (reinforcing ingroup\u2013outgroup barriers) or social aspiration (when introduced as a way of demonstrating expertise). Some academics promote the use of jargon-free language, or plain language, as an audience may be alienated or confused by the technical terminology, and thus lose track of a speaker or writer's broader and more important arguments.\nSome words with both a technical and a non-technical meaning are referred to as semi-technical vocabulary: for example, Chinh Ngan Nguyen Le and Julia Miller refer to \"colon\" as an anatomical term and also a punctuation mark; and Derek Matravers refers to \"person\" and its plural form \"persons\" as technical language used in philosophy, where their meaning is more specific than \"person\" and \"people\" in their everyday use.\nEtymology.\nThe French word is believed to have been derived from the Latin word , meaning \"to chatter\", which was used to describe speech that the listener did not understand. The word may also come from Old French meaning \"chatter of birds\". Middle English also has the verb meaning \"to chatter\", or \"twittering\", deriving from Old French.\nThe first known use of the word in English is found within \"The Canterbury Tales\", written by Geoffrey Chaucer between 1387 and 1400. Chaucer related \"jargon\" to the vocalizations of birds.\nIn colonial history, jargon was seen as a device of communication to bridge the gap between two speakers who did not speak the same tongue. Jargon was synonymous with pidgin in naming specific language usages. Jargon then began to have a negative connotation with lacking coherent grammar, or gibberish as it was seen as a \"broken\" language of many different languages with no full community to call their own. In the 1980s, linguists began restricting this usage of jargon to keep the word to more commonly define a technical or specialized language use.\nFields using the term.\nIn linguistics, it is used to mean \"specialist language\", with the term also seen as closely related to slang, argot and cant. Various kinds of language peculiar to ingroups can be named across a semantic field. Slang can be either culture-wide or known only within a certain group or subculture. Argot is slang or jargon purposely used to obscure meaning to outsiders. Conversely, a lingua franca is used for the opposite effect, helping communicators to overcome unintelligibility, as are pidgins and creole languages. For example, the Chinook Jargon was a pidgin. Although technical jargon's primary purpose is to aid technical communication, not to exclude outsiders by serving as an argot, it can have both effects at once and can provide a technical ingroup with shibboleths. For example, medieval guilds could use this as one means of informal protectionism. On the other hand, jargon that once was obscure outside a small ingroup can become generally known over time. For example, the terms \"bit, byte,\" and \"hexadecimal\" (which are terms from computing jargon) are now recognized by many people outside computer science.\nReferenced.\nThe philosopher \u00c9tienne Bonnot de Condillac observed in 1782 that \"every science requires a special language because every science has its own ideas\". As a rationalist member of the Enlightenment, he continued: \"It seems that one ought to begin by composing this language, but people begin by speaking and writing, and the language remains to be composed.\"\nIndustry term.\nAn industry word is a specialized kind of technical terminology used in a certain industry. Industry words and phrases are often used in a specific area, and those in that field know and use the terminology.\nPrecise technical terms and their definitions are formally recognized, documented, and taught by educators in the field. Other terms are more colloquial, coined and used by practitioners in the field, and are similar to slang. The boundaries between formal and slang jargon, as in general English, are quite fluid. This is especially true in the rapidly developing world of computers and networking. For instance, the term \"firewall\" (in the sense of a device used to filter network traffic) was at first technical slang. As these devices became more widespread and the term became widely understood, the word was adopted as formal terminology.\nTechnical terminology evolves due to the need for experts in a field to communicate with precision and brevity but often has the effect of excluding those who are unfamiliar with the particular specialized language of the group. This can cause difficulties, for example, when a patient is unable to follow the discussions of medical practitioners, and thus cannot understand his own condition and treatment. Differences in jargon also cause difficulties where professionals in related fields use different terms for the same phenomena.\nCorporate jargon.\nThe use of jargon in the business world is a common occurrence. The use of jargon in business correspondence reached a high popularity between the late 1800s into the 1950s. In this context, jargon is most frequently used in modes of communication such as emails, reports, and other forms of documentation. Common phrases used in corporate jargon include:\nMedical jargon.\nMedicine professionals make extensive use of scientific terminology. Most patients encounter medical jargon when referring to their diagnosis or when receiving or reading their medication. Some commonly used terms in medical jargon are:\nAt first glance, many people do not understand what these terms mean and may panic when they see these scientific names being used in reference to their health. The argument as to whether medical jargon is a positive or negative attribute of a patient's experience has evidence to support both sides. On one hand, as mentioned before, these phrases can be overwhelming for some patients who may not understand the terminology. However, with the accessibility of the internet, it has been suggested that these terms can be used and easily researched for clarity.\nLegal jargon.\nJargon is commonly found in the field of law. These terms are often used in legal contexts such as legal documents, court proceedings, contracts, and more. Some common terms in this profession include:\nEducation jargon.\nThere is specialized terminology within the field of education. Educators and administrators use these terms to communicate ideas specific to the education system. Common terms and acronyms considered to be jargon that are used within this profession include:\nIn practice.\nJargon may serve the purpose of a \"gatekeeper\" in conversation, signaling who is allowed into certain forms of conversation. Jargon may serve this function by dictating to which direction or depth a conversation about or within the context of a certain field or profession will go. For example, a conversation between two professionals in which one person has little previous interaction or knowledge of the other person could go one of at least two possible ways. One of the professionals (who the other professional does not know) does not use, or does not correctly use the jargon of their respective field, and is little regarded or remembered beyond small talk or fairly insignificant in this conversation. Or, if the person does use particular jargon (showing their knowledge in the field to be legitimate, educated, or of particular significance) the other professional then opens the conversation up in an in-depth or professional manner. The use of jargon can create a divide in communication, or strengthen it. Outside of conversation, jargon can become confusing in writing. When used in text, readers can become confused if there are terms used that require outside knowledge on the subject.\nPositivity.\nEthos is used to create an appeal to authority. It is one of three pillars of persuasion created by Aristotle to create a logical argument. Ethos uses credibility to back up arguments. It can indicate to the audience that a speaker is an insider with using specialized terms in the field to make an argument based on authority and credibility.\nJargon can be used to convey meaningful information and discourse in a convenient way within communities. A subject expert may wish to avoid jargon when explaining something to a layperson. Jargon may help communicate contextual information optimally. For example, a football coach talking to their team or a doctor working with nurses.\nAccessibility and criticism.\nWith the rise of the self-advocacy within the Disability Rights Movement, \"jargonized\" language has started to face repeated rejection for being language that is widely inaccessible. However, jargon is largely present in everyday language such as in newspapers, financial statements, and instruction manuals. To combat this, several advocacy organizations are working on influencing public agents to offer accessible information in different formats. One accessible format that offers an alternative to jargonized language is \"easy read\", which consists of a combination of plain language and images.\nThe criticism against jargon can be found in certain fields where professionals communicate with individuals with no industry background. In a study done by analyzing 58 patients and 10 radiation therapists, professionals diagnosed and explained the treatment of a disease to a patient with the use of jargon. It was found that using jargon left patients confused about what the treatments and risks were, suggesting that jargon in the medical field is not the best in communicating the terminology and concepts.\nQuantification.\nJargon has been quantified using a piecewise mathematical function called jargonness, which maps the frequencies of appearance of a word in scientific and contemporary English corpora to a parameter\u2014called jargonness itself\u2014quantifying the word's association with scientific jargon. It is expressed as:formula_1\nIn the above equation, formula_2 stands for the frequency of a word's appearance in a general English-language corpus and formula_3 stands for its frequency in a scientific corpus.\nExamples of corpora used in the determination of these frequencies include the Professional English Research Consortium Corpus (scientific) and the British National Corpus (common).\nJargon glossaries.\nMany examples of jargon exist because of its use among specialists and subcultures alike. In the professional world, those who are in the business of filmmaking may use words like \"vorkapich\" to refer to a montage when talking to colleagues. In rhetoric, rhetoricians use words like \"arete\" to refer to a person of power's character when speaking with one another.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It lies along the western coast of France from Point Penmarc'h to the Spanish border, and along the northern coast of Spain, extending westward to Cape Ortegal.\nThe average depth is and the greatest depth is .\nEtymology.\nThe Bay of Biscay is known in Spain as the Gulf of Biscay (; ). In France, it is called the Gulf of Gascony ( ; ; ; ). In Latin, the bay was known as (Cantabrian Gulf); the name Cantabrian Sea is still used locally for the southern area of the Bay of Biscay that washes over the northern coast of Spain (Cantabria). The English name comes from Biscay on the northern Spanish coast, probably standing for the western Basque districts (\"Biscay\" up to the early 19th century).\nGeography.\nParts of the continental shelf extend far into the bay, resulting in fairly shallow waters in many areas and thus the rough seas for which the region is known. Heavy storms occur in the bay, especially during the winter months. The Bay of Biscay is home to some of the Atlantic Ocean's fiercest weather; abnormally high waves occur there. Up until recent years it was a regular occurrence for merchant vessels to founder in Biscay storms.\nExtent.\nThe International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the Bay of Biscay as \"a line joining Cap Ortegal () to Penmarch Point ()\".\nThe southernmost portion is the Cantabrian Sea.\nRivers.\nThe main rivers that empty into the Bay of Biscay are Odet, Aven, La\u00efta, Scorff, Blavet, Vilaine, Loire, Lay, S\u00e8vre Niortaise, Charente, Seudre, Garonne, Dordogne, Eyre, Adour, Nivelle, Untxin, Bidasoa, Oiartzun, Urumea, Oria, Urola, Deba, Artibai, Lea, Oka, Nervi\u00f3n, Ag\u00fcera, As\u00f3n, Miera, Pas, Saja, Nansa, Deva, Sella, Nal\u00f3n, Navia, Esva, Eo, Landro and Sor.\nClimate.\nIn late spring and early summer, a large fog triangle fills the southwestern half of the bay, extending a few kilometres inland.\nAs winter begins, weather becomes severe. Depressions frequently enter from the west, and either move north to the British Isles or enter the Ebro Valley, dry out, and are finally reborn in the form of powerful thunderstorms as they reach the Mediterranean Sea. These depressions cause severe weather at sea and bring light but constant rain to its shores (known as \"orballo\", \"sirimiri\", \"morrina\", \"orbayu\", \"orpin\" or \"calabobos\"). Powerful windstorms may form if the pressure falls rapidly (galerna), traveling along the Gulf Stream at great speed, resembling a hurricane, and finally reaching the bay with their maximum power, such as Cyclone Klaus.\nThe Gulf Stream enters the bay following the continental shelf's border anti-clockwise (the Rennell Current), keeping temperatures moderate all year long.\nMain cities.\nThe main cities on the shores (or close to) of the Bay of Biscay are Lorient, Vannes, Saint-Nazaire, Bordeaux, Bayonne, Biarritz, Nantes, La Rochelle, Donostia-San Sebasti\u00e1n, Bilbao, Santander, Gij\u00f3n and Avil\u00e9s.\nHistory.\nThe southern end of the gulf is also called \"\"Mar Cant\u00e1brico\" in Spanish\" (Cantabrian Sea), from the Estaca de Bares, as far as the mouth of Adour river, but this name is not generally used in English. It was named by Romans in the 1st century BC as \"Sinus Cantabrorum\" (Bay of the Cantabri) and also, \"Mare Gallaecum\" (the Sea of the Galicians). On some medieval maps, the Bay of Biscay is marked as \"El Mar del los Vascos\" (the Basque Sea).\nThe Bay of Biscay has been the site of many famous naval engagements over the centuries. In 1592 the Spanish defeated an English fleet during the Battle of the Bay of Biscay. The Biscay campaign of June 1795 consisted of a series of manoeuvres and two battles fought between the British Channel Fleet and the French Atlantic Fleet off the southern coast of Brittany during the second year of the French Revolutionary Wars. The sank here after striking a naval mine on 22 June 1918. In 1920 the sank after losing power and drifting into a reef in a storm with the loss of 575 lives. On 28 December 1943, the Battle of the Bay of Biscay was fought between and , and a group of German destroyers as part of Operation Stonewall during World War II. The area became known as the \"Valley of Death\" by U-boat crews following a series of repeated losses from RAF attacks on U-boats from 1943 until the end of the war. The sank on 25 August 1944 in position , when she struck a mine. All hands were lost.\nOn 12 April 1970, sank in the Bay of Biscay due to a fire that crippled the submarine's nuclear reactors. An attempt to save the sub failed, resulting in the death of forty sailors and the loss of four nuclear torpedoes. Due to the great depth (), no salvage operation was attempted.\nWildlife.\nPlaiaundi Ecology Park.\nThe Plaiaundi Ecology Park is a 24-hectare coastal wetland lying where the Bidasoa River meets the sea in the Bay of Biscay.The nature of Plaiaundi consists of a wide variety of flora (visitors view them mainly in the spring) and fauna (visitors with binoculars arrive all during the year, because of the birds' migratory habits). This nature park contains a variety of birds, reptiles, mammals and insects.\nMarine mammals.\nThe car ferries from Gij\u00f3n to Nantes/Saint-Nazaire, Portsmouth to Bilbao and from Plymouth, Portsmouth and Poole to Santander provide one of the most convenient ways to see cetaceans in European waters. Often specialist groups take the ferries to collect more information. Volunteers and employees of ORCA regularly observe and monitor cetacean activity from the bridge of the ships on Brittany Ferries' Portsmouth to Santander route. Many species of whales and dolphins can be seen in this area. Most importantly, it is one of the few places in the world where the beaked whales, such as the Cuvier's beaked whale, have been observed relatively frequently. Biscay Dolphin Research monitored cetacean activity from the P&amp;O Ferries cruise ferry \"Pride of Bilbao\", on voyages from Portsmouth to Bilbao.\nNorth Atlantic right whales, one of the most endangered species of whales, once came to the bay for feeding and probably for calving as well, but whaling activities by Basque people almost wiped them out sometime prior to the 1850s. The eastern population of this species are considered to be almost extinct, and there has been no record of right whales in the Bay of Biscay except for a pair in 1977 (possibly a mother and calf) at , and another pair in June 1980. Other records in the late 20th century include one off Galicia at in September 1977 reported by a whaling company and another one seen off the Iberian Peninsula.\nThe best areas to see the larger cetaceans are in the deep waters beyond the continental shelf, particularly over the Santander Canyon and Torrelavega Canyon in the south of the Bay.\nThe alga \"Colpomenia peregrina\" was introduced and first noticed in 1906 by oyster fishermen in the Bay of Biscay.\n\"Grammatostomias flagellibarba\" (scaleless dragonfish) are native to these waters.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "49610", "revid": "50288411", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49610", "title": "English grammar", "text": "Grammar of the English language\nEnglish grammar is the set of structural rules of the English language. This includes the structure of words, phrases, clauses, sentences, and whole texts.\nOverview.\nThis article describes a generalized, present-day Standard English \u2013 forms of speech and writing used in public discourse, including broadcasting, education, entertainment, government, and news, over a range of registers, from formal then to informal. Divergences from the grammar described here occur in some historical, social, cultural, and regional varieties of English, although these are minor compared to the differences in pronunciation and vocabulary.\nModern English has largely abandoned the inflectional case system of Indo-European in favor of analytic constructions. The personal pronouns retain morphological case more strongly than any other word class (a remnant of the more extensive Germanic case system of Old English). For other pronouns, and all nouns, adjectives, and articles, grammatical function is indicated only by word order, by prepositions, and by the \"Saxon genitive or English possessive\" (\"-'s\").\nWord classes and phrases.\nNouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs are open classes \u2013 word classes that readily accept new members, such as the noun \"celebutante\" (a celebrity who frequents the fashion circles). The rest are closed classes; for example, it is rare for a new pronoun to enter the language. Determiners, traditionally classified along with adjectives, have not always been regarded as a separate part of speech. Interjections are another word class, but these are not described here as they do not form part of the clause and sentence structure of the language.\nLinguists generally accept nine English word classes: nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, pronouns, prepositions, conjunctions, determiners, and exclamations. English words are not generally marked for word class. It is not usually possible to tell from the form of a word which class it belongs to, but some inflectional endings and derivational suffixes are distinct to each class. On the other hand, most words belong to more than one word class. For example, \"run\" can serve as either a verb or a noun (these are regarded as two different lexemes). Lexemes may be inflected to express different grammatical categories. The lexeme \"run\" has the forms \"runs\", \"ran\", \"runny\", \"runner\", and \"running\". Words in one class can sometimes be derived from those in another. This has the potential to give rise to new words. For example, the noun \"aerobics\" has given rise to the adjective \"aerobicized\".\nWords combine to form phrases. A phrase typically serves the same function as a word from some particular word class. For example, \"my very good friend Peter\" is a phrase that can be used in a sentence as if it were a noun, and is therefore called a noun phrase. Similarly, adjectival phrases and adverbial phrases function as if they were adjectives or adverbs, but with other types of phrases, the terminology has different implications. For example, a verb phrase consists of a verb together with any objects and other dependents; a prepositional phrase consists of a preposition and its complement (and is therefore usually a type of adverbial phrase); and a determiner phrase is a type of noun phrase containing a determiner.\nNouns.\nMany common suffixes form nouns from other nouns or from other types of words, such as \"-age\" (\"shrinkage\"), \"-hood\" (\"sisterhood\"), and so on, though many nouns are base forms containing no such suffix (\"cat\", \"grass\", \"France\"). Nouns are also created by converting verbs and adjectives, as with the words \"talk\" and \"reading\" (\"a boring talk\", \"the assigned reading\").\nNouns are sometimes classified semantically (by their meanings) as proper and common nouns (\"Cyrus\", \"China\" vs \"frog\", \"milk\") or as concrete and abstract nouns (\"book\", \"laptop\" vs \"embarrassment\", \"prejudice\"). A grammatical distinction is often made between count (countable) nouns such as \"clock\" and \"city\", and non-count (uncountable) nouns such as \"milk\" and \"decor\". Some nouns can function both as countable and as uncountable such as \"wine\" in \"This is a good wine\".\nCountable nouns generally have singular and plural forms. In most cases the plural is formed from the singular by adding \"-[e]s\" (as in \"dogs\", \"bushes\"), although there are also irregular forms (\"woman/women\", \"foot/feet\"), including cases where the two forms are identical (\"sheep\", \"series\"). For more details see English plural. Certain nouns can be used with plural verbs even though they are singular in form, as in \"The government were...\" (where \"the government\" is considered to refer to the people constituting the government). This is a form of synesis, and is more common in British than American English. See .\nEnglish nouns are not marked for case as they are in some languages, but they have possessive forms, through the addition of \"-'s\" (as in \"John's\", \"children's\") or just an apostrophe (with no change in pronunciation) in the case of \"-[e]s\" plurals (\"the dogs' owners\") and sometimes other words ending with \"-s\" (\"Jesus' love\"). More generally the ending can be applied to noun phrases (as in \"the man you saw yesterday's sister\"); see below. The possessive form can be used either as a determiner (\"Manyanda's cat\") or as a noun phrase (\"Manyanda's is the one next to Jane's\").\nThe classification of the possessive as an affix or a clitic is the subject of debate. It differs from the noun inflection of languages such as German, in that the genitive ending may attach to the last word of the phrase. To account for this, the possessive can be analysed, for instance as a clitic construction (an \"enclitic postposition\") or as an inflection of the last word of a phrase (\"edge inflection\").\nPhrases.\nNoun phrases are phrases that function grammatically as nouns within sentences, for example as the subject or object of a verb. Most noun phrases have a noun as their head.\nAn English noun phrase typically takes the following form (not all elements need be present):\nIn this structure:\nAn example of a noun phrase that includes all of the above-mentioned elements is \"that rather attractive young college student to whom you were talking\". Here \"that\" is the determiner, \"rather attractive\" and \"young\" are adjectival pre-modifiers, \"college\" is a noun adjunct, \"student\" is the noun serving as the head of the phrase, and \"to whom you were talking\" is a post-modifier (a relative clause in this case). Notice the order of the pre-modifiers; the determiner \"that\" must come first and the noun adjunct \"college\" must come after the adjectival modifiers.\nCoordinators such as \"and\", \"or\", and \"but\" can be used at various levels in noun phrases, as in \"John, Paul, and Mary\"; \"the matching green coat and hat\"; \"a dangerous but exciting ride\"; \"a person sitting down or standing up\". See below for more explanation.\nNoun phrases can also be placed in \"apposition\" (where two consecutive phrases refer to the same thing), as in \"that president, Abraham Lincoln, ...\" (where \"that president\" and \"Abraham Lincoln\" are in apposition). In some contexts, the same can be expressed by a prepositional phrase, as in \"the twin curses of famine and pestilence\" (meaning \"the twin curses\" that are \"famine and pestilence\").\nParticular forms of noun phrases include:\nGender.\nA system of grammatical gender, whereby every noun was treated as either masculine, feminine, or neuter, existed in Old English, but fell out of use during the Middle English period. Modern English retains features relating to natural gender, most prominently the use of pronouns (such as \"he\" and \"she\") to refer specifically to persons or animals of one or other genders and certain others (such as \"it\") for sexless objects \u2013 although feminine pronouns are sometimes used when referring to ships (and more uncommonly some airplanes and analogous machinery) and nation-states.\nSome aspects of gender usage in English have been influenced by the movement towards a preference for gender-neutral language. Animals are triple-gender nouns, being able to take masculine, feminine and neuter pronouns. While the vast majority of nouns in English do not carry gender, there remain some gendered nouns (e.g. \"ewe\", \"sow\", \"rooster\") and derivational affixes (e.g. \"widower, waitress\") that denote gender.\nMany nouns that mention people's roles and jobs can refer to either a masculine or a feminine subject, for instance \"cousin\", \"teenager\", \"teacher\", \"doctor\", \"student\", \"friend\", and \"colleague\".\nOften the gender distinction for these neutral nouns is established by inserting the word \"male\" or \"female\".\nRarely, nouns illustrating things with no gender are referred to with a gendered pronoun to convey familiarity. It is also standard to use the gender-neutral pronoun (\"it\").\nDeterminers.\nEnglish determiners constitute a relatively small class of words. They include the articles \"the\" and \"a[n]\"; certain demonstrative and interrogative words such as \"this\", \"that\", and \"which\"; possessives such as \"my\" and \"whose\" (the role of determiner can also be played by noun possessive forms such as \"John's\" and \"the girl's\"); various quantifying words like, \"some\", \"many\", \"various\"; and numerals (\"one\", \"two\", etc.). There are also many phrases (such as \"a couple of\") that can play the role of determiners.\nDeterminers are used in the formation of noun phrases (see above). Many words that serve as determiners can also be used as pronouns (\"this\", \"that\", \"many\", etc.).\nSome sources, e.g. Cambridge Dictionary, Longman Dictionary, Collins Dictionary, and Collins COBUILD English grammar distinguish between predeterminers and determiners. Following this distinction, determiners can't be used directly next to each other (not: \"the my\" or \"my the\"). However, it is possible to put a predeterminer before a determiner (e.g. \"all the\").\nIn many contexts, it is required for a noun phrase to be completed with an article or some other determiner. It is not grammatical to say just \"cat sat on table\"; one must say \"my cat sat on the table\". The most common situations in which a complete noun phrase can be formed without a determiner are when it refers generally to a whole class or concept (as in \"dogs are dangerous\" and \"beauty is subjective\") and when it is a name (\"Jane\", \"Spain\", etc.). This is discussed in more detail at English articles and Zero article in English.\nPronouns.\nPronouns are a relatively small, closed class of words that function in the place of nouns or noun phrases. They include personal pronouns, demonstrative pronouns, relative pronouns, interrogative pronouns, and some others, mainly indefinite pronouns. The full set of English pronouns is presented in the following table. Nonstandard, informal and archaic forms are in \"italics\".\n\u2020 Interrogative only.\nPersonal.\nThe personal pronouns of modern standard English are presented in the table above. They are \"I, you, she, he, it, we\", and \"they\". The personal pronouns are so-called not because they apply to persons (which other pronouns also do), but because they participate in the system of grammatical person (1st, 2nd, 3rd).\nThe second-person forms such as \"you\" are used with both singular and plural reference. In the Southern United States, y'all (you all) is used as a plural form, and various other phrases such as \"you guys\" are used in other places. An archaic set of second-person pronouns used for singular reference is \"thou, thee, thyself, thy, thine\", which are still used in religious services and can be seen in older works, such as Shakespeare's\u2014in such texts, the \"you\" set of pronouns are used for plural reference, or with singular reference as a formal V-form. \"You\" can also be used as an indefinite pronoun, referring to a person in general (see generic \"you\"), compared to the more formal alternative, \"one\" (reflexive \"oneself\", possessive \"one's\").\nThe third-person singular forms are differentiated according to the gender of the referent. For example, \"she\" is used to refer to a woman, sometimes a female animal, and sometimes an object to which feminine characteristics are attributed, such as a ship or a country. A man, and sometimes a male animal, is referred to using \"he\". In other cases, \"it\" can be used. (See Gender in English.) The word \"it\" can also be used as a dummy subject, concerning abstract ideas like time, weather, etc., or a dummy object of a verb or preposition.\nThe third-person form \"they\" is used with both plural and singular referents. Historically, singular \"they\" was restricted to quantificational constructions such as \"Each employee should clean their desk\" and referential cases where the referent's gender was unknown. However, it is increasingly used when the referent's gender is irrelevant or when the referent is neither male nor female.\nThe possessive determiners such as \"my\" are used as determiners together with nouns, as in \"my old man\", \"some of his friends\". The second possessive forms like \"mine\" are used when they do not qualify a noun: as pronouns, as in \"mine is bigger than yours\", and as predicates, as in \"this one is mine\". Note also the construction \"a friend of mine\" (meaning \"someone who is my friend\"). See English possessive for more details.\nDemonstrative.\nThe demonstrative pronouns of English are \"this\" (plural \"these\"), and \"that\" (plural \"those\"), as in \"these are good, I like that\". All four words can also be used as determiners (followed by a noun), as in \"those cars\". They can also form the alternative pronominal expressions \"this/that one\", \"these/those ones\".\nInterrogative.\nThe interrogative pronouns are \"who\", \"what\", and \"which\" (all of them can take the suffix \"-ever\" for emphasis). The pronoun \"who\" refers to a person or people; it has an oblique form \"whom\" (though in informal contexts this is usually replaced by \"who\"), and a possessive form (pronoun or determiner) \"whose\". The pronoun \"what\" refers to things or abstracts. The word \"which\" is used to ask about alternatives from what is seen as a closed set: \"which (of the books) do you like best?\" (It can also be an interrogative determiner: \"which book?\"; this can form the alternative pronominal expressions \"which one\" and \"which ones\".) \"Which\", \"who\", and \"what\" can be either singular or plural, although \"who\" and \"what\" often take a singular verb regardless of any supposed number. For more information see \"who\".\nIn Old and Middle English, the roles of the three words were different from their roles today. \"The interrogative pronoun \"hw\u0101\" 'who, what' had only singular forms and also only distinguished between non-neuter and neuter, the neuter nominative form being \"hw\u00e6t\"\". Note that neuter and non-neuter refers to the grammatical gender system of the time, rather than the so-called natural gender system of today. A small holdover of this is the ability of relative (but not interrogative) \"whose\" to refer to non-persons (e.g., \"the car whose door won't open\").\nAll the interrogative pronouns can also be used as relative pronouns, though \"what\" is quite limited in its use; see below for more details.\nRelative.\nThe main relative pronouns in English are \"who\" (with its derived forms \"whom\" and \"whose\"), \"which\", and \"that\".\nThe relative pronoun \"which\" refers to things rather than persons, as in \"the shirt, which used to be red, is faded\". For persons, \"who\" is used (\"the man who saw me was tall\"). The oblique case form of \"who\" is \"whom\", as in \"the man whom I saw was tall\", although in informal registers \"who\" is commonly used in place of \"whom\".\nThe possessive form of \"who\" is \"whose\" (for example, \"the man whose car is missing\"); however the use of \"whose\" is not restricted to persons (one can say \"an idea whose time has come\").\nThe word \"that\" as a relative pronoun is normally found only in restrictive relative clauses (unlike \"which\" and \"who\", which can be used in both restrictive and unrestrictive clauses). It can refer to either persons or things, and cannot follow a preposition. For example, one can say \"the song that\" [or \"which\"] \"I listened to yesterday\", but \"the song to which\" [not \"to that\"] \"I listened yesterday\". The relative pronoun \"that\" is usually pronounced with a reduced vowel (schwa), and hence differently from the demonstrative \"that\" (see Weak and strong forms in English). If \"that\" is not the subject of the relative clause, it can be omitted (\"the song I listened to yesterday\").\nThe word \"what\" can be used to form a free relative clause \u2013 one that has no antecedent and that serves as a complete noun phrase in itself, as in \"I like what he likes\". The words \"whatever\" and \"whichever\" can be used similarly, in the role of either pronouns (\"whatever he likes\") or determiners (\"whatever book he likes\"). When referring to persons, \"who(ever)\" (and \"whom(ever)\") can be used in a similar way.\n\"There\".\nThe word \"there\" is used as a pronoun in some sentences, playing the role of a dummy subject, normally of an intransitive verb. The \"logical subject\" of the verb then appears as a complement after the verb.\nThis use of \"there\" occurs most commonly with forms of the verb \"be\" in existential clauses, to refer to the presence or existence of something. For example: \"There is a heaven\"; \"There are two cups on the table\"; \"There have been a lot of problems lately\". It can also be used with other verbs: \"There exist two major variants\"; \"There occurred a very strange incident\".\nThe dummy subject takes the number (singular or plural) of the logical subject (complement), hence it takes a plural verb if the complement is plural. In informal English, however, the contraction \"there's\" is often used for both singular and plural.\nThe dummy subject can undergo inversion, \"Is there a test today?\" and \"Never has there been a man such as this\". It can also appear without a corresponding logical subject, in short sentences and question tags: \"There wasn't a discussion, was there? There was\".\nThe word \"there\" in such sentences has sometimes been analyzed as an adverb, or as a dummy predicate, rather than as a pronoun. However, its identification as a pronoun is most consistent with its behavior in inverted sentences and question tags as described above.\nBecause the word \"there\" can also be a deictic adverb (meaning \"at/to that place\"), a sentence like \"There is a river\" could have either of two meanings: \"a river exists\" (with \"there\" as a pronoun), and \"a river is in that place\" (with \"there\" as an adverb). In speech, the adverbial \"there\" would be given stress, while the pronoun would not \u2013 in fact, the pronoun is often pronounced as a weak form, .\nReciprocal.\nThe English reciprocal pronouns are \"each other\" and \"one another\". No consistent distinction in meaning or use can be found between them. Like the reflexive pronouns, their use is limited to contexts where an antecedent precedes it. In the case of the reciprocals, they need to appear in the same clause as the antecedent.\nOther.\nOther pronouns in English are often identical in form to determiners (especially quantifiers), such as \"many\", \"a little\", etc. Sometimes, the pronoun form is different, as with \"none\" (corresponding to the determiner \"no\"), \"nothing\", \"everyone\", \"somebody\", etc. Many examples are listed as indefinite pronouns. Another indefinite (or impersonal) pronoun is \"one\" (with its reflexive form \"oneself\" and possessive \"one's\"), which is a more formal alternative to generic \"you\".\nVerbs.\nThe basic form of an English verb is not generally marked by any ending, although there are certain suffixes that are frequently used to form verbs, such as \"-ate\" (\"formulate\"), \"-fy\" (\"electrify\"), and \"-ise/ize\" (\"realise/realize\"). Many verbs also contain prefixes, such as \"un-\" (\"unmask\"), \"out-\" (\"outlast\"), \"over-\" (\"overtake\"), and \"under-\" (\"undervalue\"). Verbs can also be formed from nouns and adjectives by zero derivation, as with the verbs \"snare\", \"nose\", \"dry\", and \"calm\".\nMost verbs have three or four inflected forms in addition to the base form: a third-person singular present tense form in \"-(e)s\" (\"writes\", \"botches\"), a present participle and gerund form in \"-ing\" (\"writing\"), a past tense (\"wrote\"), and \u2013 though often identical to the past tense form \u2013 a past participle (\"written\"). Regular verbs have identical past tense and past participle forms in \"-ed\", but there are 100 or so irregular English verbs with different forms (see list). The verbs \"have\", \"do\" and \"say\" also have irregular third-person present tense forms (\"has\", \"does\" , \"says\" ). The verb \"be\" has the largest number of irregular forms (\"am, is, are\" in the present tense, \"was, were\" in the past tense, \"been\" for the past participle).\nMost of what are often referred to as verb tenses (or sometimes aspects) in English are formed using auxiliary verbs. Apart from what are called the simple present (\"write\", \"writes\") and simple past (\"wrote\"), there are also continuous (progressive) forms (\"am/is/are/was/were writing\"), perfect forms (\"have/has/had written\", and the perfect continuous \"have/has/had been writing\"), future forms (\"will write\", \"will be writing\", \"will have written\", \"will have been writing\"), and conditionals (also called \"future in the past\"), so forms equivalent to future ones but with \"would\" instead of \"will\". The auxiliaries \"shall\" and \"should\" sometimes replace \"will\" and \"would\" in the first person. For the uses of these various verb forms, see English verbs and English clause syntax.\nThe basic form of the verb (\"be, write, play\") is used as the infinitive, although there is also a \"to-infinitive\" (\"to be\", \"to write\", \"to play\") used in many syntactical constructions. There are also infinitives corresponding to other aspects: \"(to) have written\", \"(to) be writing\", \"(to) have been writing\". The second-person imperative is identical to the (basic) infinitive; other imperative forms may be made with \"let\" (\"let us go\", or \"let's go\"; \"let them eat cake\").\nA form identical to the infinitive can be used as a present subjunctive in certain contexts: \"It is important that he follow them\" or \"... that he be committed to the cause\". There is also a past subjunctive (distinct from the simple past only in the possible use of \"were\" instead of \"was\"), used in some conditional sentences and similar: \"if I were\" (or \"was\") \"rich...\"; \"were he to arrive now...\"; \"I wish she were\" (or \"was\") \"here\". For details see English subjunctive.\nThe passive voice is formed using the verb \"be\" (in the appropriate tense or form) with the past participle of the verb in question: \"cars are driven, he was killed, I am being tickled, it is nice to be pampered\", etc. The performer of the action may be introduced in a prepositional phrase with \"by\" (as in \"they were killed by the invaders\").\nThe English modal verbs consist of the core modals \"can\", \"could\", \"may\", \"might\", \"must\", \"shall\", \"should\", \"will\", \"would\", as well as \"ought (to\"), \"had better\", and in some uses \"dare\" and \"need\". These do not inflect for person or number, do not occur alone, and do not have infinitive or participle forms (except synonyms, as with \"be/being/been able (to\") for the modals \"can/could\"). The modals are used with the basic infinitive form of a verb (\"I can swim, he may be killed\", \"we dare not move\", \"need they go?\"), except for \"ought\", which takes \"to\" (\"you ought to go\"). Modals can indicate the condition, probability, possibility, necessity, obligation and ability exposed by the speaker's or writer's attitude or expression.\nThe copula \"be\", along with the modal verbs and the other auxiliaries, form a distinct class, sometimes called \"special verbs\" or simply \"auxiliaries\". These have different syntax from ordinary lexical verbs, especially in that they make their interrogative forms by plain inversion with the subject, and their negative forms by adding \"not\" after the verb (\"could I...? I could not...\"). Apart from those already mentioned, this class may also include \"used to\" (although the forms \"did he use to?\" and \"he didn't use to\" are also found), and sometimes \"have\" even when not an auxiliary (forms like \"have you a sister?\" and \"he hadn't a clue\" are possible, though becoming less common). It also includes the auxiliary \"do\" (\"does\", \"did\"); this is used with the basic infinitive of other verbs (those not belonging to the \"special verbs\" class) to make their question and negation forms, as well as emphatic forms (\"do I like you?\"; \"he doesn't speak English\"; \"we did close the fridge\"). For more details of this, see \"do\"-support.\nSome forms of the copula and auxiliaries often appear as contractions, as in \"I'm\" for \"I am\", \"you'd\" for \"you would\" or \"you had\", and \"John's\" for \"John is\". Their negated forms with following \"not\" are also often contracted (see below). For detail see English auxiliaries and contractions.\nPhrases.\nA verb together with its dependents, excluding its subject, may be identified as a verb phrase (although this concept is not acknowledged in all theories of grammar). A verb phrase headed by a finite verb may also be called a predicate. The dependents may be objects, complements, and modifiers (adverbs or adverbial phrases). In English, objects and complements nearly always come after the verb; a direct object precedes other complements such as prepositional phrases, but if there is an indirect object as well, expressed without a preposition, then that precedes the direct object: \"give me the book\", but \"give the book to me\". Adverbial modifiers generally follow objects, although other positions are possible (see under below). Certain verb\u2013modifier combinations, particularly when they have independent meaning (such as \"take on\" and \"get up\"), are known as \"phrasal verbs\".\nFor details of possible patterns, see English clause syntax. See the Non-finite clauses section of that article for verb phrases headed by non-finite verb forms, such as infinitives and participles.\nAdjectives.\nEnglish adjectives, as with other word classes, cannot in general be identified as such by their form, although many of them are formed from nouns or other words by the addition of a suffix, such as \"-al\" (\"habitual\"), \"-ful\" (\"blissful\"), \"-ic\" (\"atomic\"), \"-ish\" (\"impish\", \"youngish\"), \"-ous\" (\"hazardous\"), etc.; or from other adjectives using a prefix: \"disloyal\", \"irredeemable\", \"unforeseen\", \"overtired\".\nAdjectives may be used attributively, as part of a noun phrase (nearly always preceding the noun they modify; for exceptions see postpositive adjective), as in \"the big house\", or predicatively, as in \"the house is big\". Certain adjectives are restricted to one or other use; for example, \"drunken\" is attributive (\"a drunken sailor\"), while \"drunk\" is usually predicative (\"the sailor was drunk\").\nComparison.\nMany adjectives have comparative and superlative forms in \"-er\" and \"-est\", such as \"faster\" and \"fastest\" (from the positive form \"fast\"). Spelling rules which maintain pronunciation apply to suffixing adjectives just as they do for similar treatment of regular past tense formation; these cover consonant doubling (as in \"bigger\" and \"biggest\", from \"big\") and the change of \"y\" to \"i\" after consonants (as in \"happier\" and \"happiest\", from \"happy\").\nThe adjectives \"good\" and \"bad\" have the irregular forms \"better, best\" and \"worse, worst\"; also \"far\" becomes \"farther, farthest\" or \"further, furthest\". The adjective \"old\" (for which the regular \"older\" and \"oldest\" are usual) also has the irregular forms \"elder\" and \"eldest\", these generally being restricted to use in comparing siblings and in certain independent uses. For the comparison of adverbs, see Adverbs below.\nMany adjectives, however, particularly those that are longer and less common, do not have inflected comparative and superlative forms. Instead, they can be qualified with \"more\" and \"most\", as in \"beautiful, more beautiful, most beautiful\" (this construction is also sometimes used even for adjectives for which inflected forms do exist).\nCertain adjectives are classed as ungradable. These represent properties that cannot be compared on a scale; they simply apply or do not, as with \"pregnant\", \"dead\", \"unique\". Consequently, comparative and superlative forms of such adjectives are not normally used, except in a figurative, humorous or imprecise context. Similarly, such adjectives are not normally qualified with modifiers of degree such as \"very\" and \"fairly\", although with some of them it is idiomatic to use adverbs such as \"completely\". Another type of adjective sometimes considered ungradable is those that represent an extreme degree of some property, such as \"delicious\" and \"terrified\".\nPhrases.\nAn adjective phrase is a group of words that plays the role of an adjective in a sentence. It usually has a single adjective as its head, to which modifiers and complements may be added.\nAdjectives can be modified by a preceding adverb or adverb phrase, as in \"very warm\", \"truly imposing\", \"more than a little excited\". Some can also be preceded by a noun or quantitative phrase, as in \"fat-free\", \"two-meter-long\".\nComplements following the adjective may include:\nAn adjective phrase may include both modifiers before the adjective and a complement after it, as in \"very difficult to put away\".\nAdjective phrases containing complements after the adjective cannot normally be used as attributive adjectives \"before\" a noun. Sometimes they are used attributively after the noun, as in \"a woman proud of being a midwife\" (where they may be converted into relative clauses: \"a woman who is proud of being a midwife\"), but it is wrong to say *\"a proud of being a midwife woman\". Exceptions include very brief and often established phrases such as \"easy-to-use\". (Certain complements can be moved to after the noun, leaving the adjective before the noun, as in \"a better man than you\", \"a hard nut to crack\".)\nCertain attributive adjective phrases are formed from other parts of speech, without any adjective as their head, as in \"a two-bedroom house\", \"a no-jeans policy\".\nAdverbs.\nAdverbs perform a wide range of functions. They typically modify verbs (or verb phrases), adjectives (or adjectival phrases), or other adverbs (or adverbial phrases). However, adverbs also sometimes qualify noun phrases (only the boss\"; quite a lovely place\"), pronouns and determiners (almost all\"), prepositional phrases (halfway through the movie\"), or whole sentences, to provide contextual comment or indicate an attitude (\"Frankly, I don't believe you\"). They can also indicate a relationship between clauses or sentences (\"He died, and consequently I inherited the estate\").\nMany English adverbs are formed from adjectives by adding the ending \"-ly\", as in \"hopefully\", \"widely\", \"theoretically\" (for details of spelling and etymology, see \"-ly\"). Certain words can be used as both adjectives and adverbs, such as \"fast\", \"straight\", and \"hard\"; these are flat adverbs. In earlier usage more flat adverbs were accepted in formal usage; many of these survive in idioms and colloquially. (\"That's just plain ugly\".) Some adjectives can also be used as flat adverbs when they actually describe the subject. (\"The streaker ran naked, not \"The streaker ran nakedly.) The adverb corresponding to the adjective \"good\" is \"well\" (note that \"bad\" forms the regular \"badly\", although \"ill\" is occasionally used in some phrases).\nThere are also many adverbs that are not derived from adjectives, including adverbs of time, of frequency, of place, of degree and with other meanings. Some suffixes that are commonly used to form adverbs from nouns are \"-ward[s]\" (as in \"homeward[s]\") and \"-wise\" (as in \"lengthwise\").\nAdverbs are also formed by adding -\"ly\" to the participles. For example, \"according,\" a present participle adjective, becomes \"accordingly,\" an adverb, by adding -\"ly\" after it. The past participle adjective \"repeated\" becomes \"repeatedly\" by adding -\"ly\" after it.\nMost adverbs form comparatives and superlatives by modification with \"more\" and \"most\": \"often\", \"more often\", \"most often\"; \"smoothly\", \"more smoothly\", \"most smoothly\" (see also comparison of adjectives, above). However, a few adverbs retain irregular inflection for comparative and superlative forms: \"much\", \"more\", \"most\"; \"a little\", \"less\", \"least\"; \"well\", \"better\", \"best\"; \"badly\", \"worse\", \"worst\"; \"far\", \"further\" (\"farther\"), \"furthest\" (\"farthest\"); or follow the regular adjectival inflection: \"fast\", \"faster\", \"fastest\"; \"soon\", \"sooner\", \"soonest\"; etc.\nAdverbs indicating the manner of an action are generally placed after the verb and its objects (\"We considered the proposal carefully), although other positions are often possible (\"We carefully considered the proposal\"). Many adverbs of frequency, degree, certainty, etc. (such as \"often\", \"always\", \"almost\", \"probably\", and various others such as \"just\") tend to be placed before the verb (\"they usually have chips\"), although if there is an auxiliary or other \"special verb\" (see above), then the normal position for such adverbs is after that special verb (or after the first of them, if there is more than one): \"I have just finished the crossword\"; \"She can usually manage a pint\"; \"We are never late\"; \"You might possibly have been unconscious\". Adverbs that provide a connection with previous information (such as \"next\", \"then\", \"however\"), and those that provide the context (such as time or place) for a sentence, are typically placed at the start of the sentence: Yesterday we went on a shopping expedition\". If the verb has an object, the adverb comes after the object (\"He finished the test quickly). When there is more than one type of adverb, they usually appear in the order: manner, place, time (\"His arm was hurt severely at home yesterday).\nA special type of adverb is the adverbial particle used to form phrasal verbs (such as \"up\" in \"pick up\", \"on\" in \"get on\", etc.) If such a verb also has an object, then the particle may precede or follow the object, although it will normally follow the object if the object is a pronoun (\"pick the pen up\" or \"pick up the pen\", but \"pick it up\").\nPhrases.\nAn adverb phrase is a phrase that acts as an adverb within a sentence. An adverb phrase may have an adverb as its head, together with any modifiers (other adverbs or adverb phrases) and complements, analogously to the adjective phrases described above. For example: \"very sleepily\"; \"all too suddenly\"; \"oddly enough\"; \"perhaps shockingly for us\".\nAnother very common type of adverb phrase is the prepositional phrase, which consists of a preposition and its object: \"in the pool\"; \"after two years\"; \"for the sake of harmony\".\nPrepositions.\nPrepositions form a closed word class, although there are also certain phrases that serve as prepositions, such as \"in front of\". A single preposition may have a variety of meanings, often including temporal, spatial and abstract. Many words that are prepositions can also serve as adverbs. Examples of common English prepositions (including phrasal instances) are: \"of\", \"in\", \"on\", \"over\", \"under\", \"to\", \"from\", \"with\", \"in front of\", \"behind\", \"opposite\", \"by\", \"before\", \"after\", \"during\", \"through\", \"in spite of\" or \"despite\", \"between\", \"among\", etc.\nA preposition is usually used with a noun phrase as its complement. A preposition together with its complement is called a prepositional phrase. Examples are \"in England\", \"under the table\", \"after six pleasant weeks\", \"between the land and the sea\". A prepositional phrase can be used as a complement or post-modifier of a noun in a noun phrase, as in \"the man in the car\", \"the start of the fight\"; as a complement of a verb or adjective, as in \"deal with the problem\", \"proud of oneself\"; or generally as an adverb phrase (see above).\nEnglish allows the use of \"stranded\" prepositions. This can occur in interrogative and relative clauses, where the interrogative or relative pronoun that is the preposition's complement is moved to the start (fronted), leaving the preposition in place. This kind of structure is avoided in some kinds of formal English. For example:\nNotice that in the second example the relative pronoun \"that\" could be omitted.\nStranded prepositions can also arise in passive voice constructions and other uses of passive past participial phrases, where the complement in a prepositional phrase can become zero in the same way that a verb's direct object would: \"it was looked at\"; \"I will be operated on\"; \"get your teeth seen to\". The same can happen in certain uses of infinitive phrases: \"he is nice to talk to\"; \"this is the page to make copies of\".\nConjunctions.\nConjunctions express a variety of logical relations between items, phrases, clauses and sentences. They help link ideas, show relationships, and form more complex sentences. \nThe principal coordinating conjunctions in English are: \"and\", \"or\", \"but\", \"nor\", \"so\", \"yet\", and \"for\". These can be used in many grammatical contexts to link two or more items of equal grammatical status, for example:\nAnother example of clauses or sentences linked is: \"I like reading books, and I also enjoy watching movies\".\nThere are also correlative conjunctions, where as well as the basic conjunction, an additional element appears before the first of the items being linked. The common correlatives in English are:\nAn example of a correlative conjunction can be seen in: \" Not only did I finish my homework, but I also helped my sibling\".\nSubordinators make relations between clauses, making the clause in which they appear into a subordinate clause. Some common subordinators in English are:\nSubordinating conjunction generally comes at the very start of its clause, although many of them can be preceded by qualifying adverbs, as in \"probably because...\", \"especially if...\". The conjunction \"that\" can be omitted after certain verbs, as in \"she told us (that) she was ready\". (For the use of \"that\" in relative clauses, see above.)\nAn example of a subordinating conjunction being used is: \"I went to the store because I needed milk\".\nCase.\nAlthough English has largely lost its case system, personal pronouns still have three morphological cases that are simplified forms of the nominative, objective and genitive cases:\nMost English personal pronouns have five forms: the nominative and oblique case forms, the possessive case, which has both a \"determiner\" form (such as \"my\", \"our\") and a distinct \"independent\" form (such as \"mine\", \"ours\") (with two exceptions: the third person singular masculine and the third person singular neuter \"it\", which use the same form for both determiner and independent [\"his car\", \"it is his\"]), and a distinct \"reflexive\" or \"intensive\" form (such as \"myself\", \"ourselves\"). The interrogative personal pronoun \"who\" exhibits the greatest diversity of forms within the modern English pronoun system, having definite nominative, oblique, and genitive forms (\"who\", \"whom\", \"whose\") and equivalently coordinating indefinite forms (\"whoever\", \"whomever\", and \"whosever\").\nForms such as \"I\", \"he\", and \"we\" are used for the subject (\"I kicked the ball\"), whereas forms such as \"me\", \"him\" and \"us\" are used for the object (\"John kicked me\").\nDeclension.\nNouns have distinct singular and plural forms; that is, they \"decline\" to reflect their grammatical number; consider the difference between \"book\" and \"books\". In addition, a few English pronouns have distinct nominative (also called subjective) and oblique (or objective) forms; that is, they decline to reflect their relationship to a verb or preposition, or case. Consider the difference between \"he\" (subjective) and \"him\" (objective), as in \"He saw it\" and \"It saw him\"; similarly, consider \"who\", which is subjective, and the objective \"whom\". Further, these pronouns and a few others have distinct possessive forms, such as \"his\" and \"whose\". By contrast, nouns have no distinct nominative and objective forms, the two being merged into a single \"plain case\". For example, \"chair\" does not change form between \"the chair is here\" (subject) and \"I saw the chair\" (direct object). Possession is shown by the clitic \"-'s\" attached to a possessive noun phrase, rather than by declension of the noun itself.\nNegation.\nAs noted above under , a finite indicative verb (or its clause) is negated by placing the word \"not\" after an auxiliary, modal or other \"special\" verb such as \"do\", \"can\" or \"be\". For example, the clause \"I go\" is negated with the appearance of the auxiliary \"do\", as \"I do not go\" (see \"do\"-support). When the affirmative already uses auxiliary verbs (\"I am going\"), no other auxiliary \"verbs\" are added to negate the clause (\"I am not going\"). (Until the period of early Modern English, negation was effected without additional auxiliary verbs: \"I go not\".)\nMost combinations of auxiliary verbs etc. with \"not\" have contracted forms: \"don't\", \"can't\", \"isn't\", etc. (Also the uncontracted negated form of \"can\" is written as a single word \"cannot\".) On the inversion of subject and verb (such as in questions; see below), the subject may be placed after a contracted negated form: \"Should he not pay?\" or \"Shouldn't he pay?\"\nOther elements, such as noun phrases, adjectives, adverbs, infinitive and participial phrases, etc., can be negated by placing the word \"not\" before them: \"not the right answer\", \"not interesting\", \"not to enter\", \"not noticing the train\", etc.\nWhen other negating words such as \"never\", \"nobody\", etc. appear in a sentence, the negating \"not\" is omitted (unlike its equivalents in many languages): \"I saw nothing\" or \"I didn't see anything\", but not (except in non-standard speech) *\"I didn't see nothing\" (see Double negative). Such negating words generally have corresponding negative polarity items (\"ever\" for \"never\", \"anybody\" for \"nobody\", etc.) which can appear in a negative context but are not negative themselves (and can thus be used after a negation without giving rise to double negatives).\nClause and sentence structure.\nA typical sentence contains one independent clause and possibly one or more dependent clauses, although it is also possible to link together sentences of this form into longer sentences, using coordinating conjunctions (see above). A clause typically contains a subject (a noun phrase) and a predicate (a verb phrase in the terminology used above; that is, a verb together with its objects and complements). A dependent clause also normally contains a subordinating conjunction (or in the case of relative clauses, a relative pronoun, or phrase containing one).\nWord order.\nEnglish word order has moved from the Germanic verb-second (V2) word order to being almost exclusively subject\u2013verb\u2013object (SVO). The combination of SVO order and use of auxiliary verbs often creates clusters of two or more verbs at the center of the sentence, such as \"he had hoped to try to open it\". In most sentences, English marks grammatical relations only through word order. The subject constituent precedes the verb and the object constituent follows it. The Object\u2013subject\u2013verb (OSV) may on occasion be seen in English, usually in the future tense or used as a contrast with the conjunction \"but\", such as in the following examples: \"Rome I shall see!\", \"I hate oranges, but apples I'll eat!\".\nQuestions.\nLike many other Western European languages, English historically allowed questions to be formed by inverting the positions of the verb and subject. Modern English permits this only in the case of a small class of verbs (\"special verbs\"), consisting of auxiliaries as well as forms of the copula \"be\" (see subject\u2013auxiliary inversion). To form a question from a sentence which does not have such an auxiliary or copula present, the auxiliary verb \"do\" (\"does\", \"did\") needs to be inserted, along with inversion of the word order, to form a question (see \"do\"-support). For example:\nThe above concerns yes\u2013no questions, but inversion also takes place in the same way after other questions, formed with interrogative words such as \"where\", \"what\", \"how\", etc. An exception applies when the interrogative word is the subject or part of the subject, in which case there is no inversion. For example:\nInversion does not apply in indirect questions: \"I wonder where he is\" (not *\"... where is he\"). Indirect yes\u2013no questions can be expressed using \"if\" or \"whether\" as the interrogative word: \"Ask them whether/if they saw him\".\nNegative questions are formed similarly; however, if the verb undergoing inversion has a contraction with \"not\", then it is possible to invert the subject with this contraction as a whole. For example:\nSee also .\nDependent clauses.\nThe syntax of a dependent clause is generally the same as that of an independent clause, except that the dependent clause usually begins with a subordinating conjunction or relative pronoun (or phrase containing such). In some situations (as already described) the conjunction or relative pronoun \"that\" can be omitted. Another type of dependent clause with no subordinating conjunction is the conditional clause formed by inversion (see below).\nOther uses of inversion.\nThe clause structure with an inverted subject and verb, used to form questions as described above, is also used in certain types of declarative sentences. This occurs mainly when the sentence begins with adverbial or other phrases that are essentially negative or contain words such as \"only\", \"hardly\", etc.: \"Never have I known someone so stupid; Only in France can such food be tasted\".\nIn elliptical sentences (see below), inversion takes place after \"so\" (meaning \"also\") as well as after the negative \"neither\": \"so do I, neither does she\".\nInversion can also be used to form conditional clauses, beginning with \"should\", \"were\" (subjunctive), or \"had\", in the following ways:\nOther similar forms sometimes appear but are less common. There is also a construction with subjunctive \"be\", as in \"be he alive or dead\" (meaning \"no matter whether he is alive or dead\").\nUse of inversion to express a third-person imperative is now mostly confined to the expression \"long live X\", meaning \"let X live long\".\nImperatives.\nIn an imperative sentence (one giving an order), there is usually no subject in the independent clause: \"Go away until I call you\". It is possible, however, to include \"you\" as the subject for emphasis: \"You stay away from me\".\nElliptical constructions.\nMany types of elliptical construction are possible in English, resulting in sentences that omit certain redundant elements. Various examples are given in the article on Ellipsis.\nSome notable elliptical forms found in English include:\nHistory of English grammars.\nThe first published English grammar was a \"Pamphlet for Grammar\" of 1586, written by William Bullokar with the stated goal of demonstrating that English was just as rule-based as Latin. Bullokar's grammar was faithfully modeled on William Lily's Latin grammar, \"Rudimenta Grammatices\" (1534), used in English schools at that time, having been \"prescribed\" for them in 1542 by Henry VIII. Bullokar wrote his grammar in English and used a \"reformed spelling system\" of his own invention; but much English grammar, for much of the century after Bullokar's effort, was written in Latin, especially by authors who were aiming to be scholarly. John Wallis's \"Grammatica Linguae Anglicanae\" (1685) was the last English grammar written in Latin.\nEven as late as the early 19th century, Lindley Murray, the author of one of the most widely used grammars of the day, was having to cite \"grammatical authorities\" to bolster the claim that grammatical cases in English are different from those in Ancient Greek or Latin.\nEnglish parts of speech are based on Latin and Greek parts of speech. Some English grammar rules were adopted from Latin, for example John Dryden is thought to have created the rule no sentences can end in a preposition because Latin cannot end sentences in prepositions. The rule of no split infinitives was adopted from Latin because Latin has no split infinitives.\nNotes and references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "49611", "revid": "19769249", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49611", "title": "Menopause", "text": "Time when menstrual periods stop permanently\nMedical condition&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Infobox/styles-images.css\" /&gt;\nMenopause is the time when menstrual periods permanently stop, marking the end of the reproductive stage for the female human. It typically occurs between the ages of 45 and 55, although the exact timing can vary. Menopause is usually a natural change related to a decrease in circulating blood estrogen levels. It can occur earlier in those who smoke tobacco. Other causes include surgery that removes both ovaries, some types of chemotherapy, or anything that leads to a decrease in hormone levels. At the physiological level, menopause happens because of a decrease in the ovaries' production of the hormones estrogen and progesterone. While typically not needed, measuring hormone levels in the blood or urine can confirm a diagnosis. Menopause is the opposite of menarche, the time when periods start.\nIn the years before menopause, a woman's periods typically become irregular, which means that periods may be longer or shorter in duration, or be lighter or heavier in the amount of flow. During this time, women often experience hot flashes; these typically last from 30 seconds to ten minutes and may be associated with shivering, night sweats, and reddening of the skin. Hot flashes can recur for four to five years. Other symptoms may include vaginal dryness, trouble sleeping, and mood changes. The severity of symptoms varies between women. Menopause is also known to cause thinning and drying of the skin as 30% of the skins collagen is lost during the first five years of menopause. Menopause before the age of 45 years is considered to be \"early menopause\", and ovarian failure or surgical removal of the ovaries before the age of 40 years is termed \"premature ovarian insufficiency\".\nIn addition to symptoms (hot flushes/flashes, night sweats, mood changes, arthralgia and vaginal dryness), the physical consequences of menopause include bone loss, increased central abdominal fat, and adverse changes in a woman's cholesterol profile and vascular function. These changes predispose postmenopausal women to increased risks of osteoporosis and bone fracture, and of cardio-metabolic disease (diabetes and cardiovascular disease).\nMedical professionals often define menopause as having occurred when a woman has not had any menstrual bleeding for a year. It may also be defined by a decrease in hormone production by the ovaries. In those who have had surgery to remove their uterus but still have functioning ovaries, menopause is not considered to have yet occurred. Following the removal of the uterus, symptoms of menopause typically occur earlier. Iatrogenic menopause occurs when both ovaries are surgically removed (oophorectomy) along with the uterus for medical reasons.\nMedical treatment of menopause is primarily to ameliorate symptoms and prevent bone loss. Mild symptoms may be improved with treatment. With respect to hot flashes, avoiding nicotine, caffeine, and alcohol is often recommended; sleeping naked in a cool room and using a fan may help. The most effective treatment for menopausal symptoms is menopausal hormone therapy (MHT). Non-hormonal therapies for hot flashes include cognitive-behavioral therapy, clinical hypnosis, gabapentin, fezolinetant or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. These will not improve symptoms such as joint pain or vaginal dryness, which affect over 55% of women. Exercise may help with sleeping problems. Many of the concerns about the use of MHT raised by older studies are no longer considered barriers to MHT in healthy women. High-quality evidence for the effectiveness of alternative medicine has not been found.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSigns and symptoms.\nDuring early menopause transition, the menstrual cycles remain regular but the interval between cycles begins to lengthen. Hormone levels begin to fluctuate. Ovulation may not occur with each cycle.\nThe term \"menopause\" refers to a point in time that follows one year after the last menstruation. During the menopausal transition and after menopause, women can experience a range of symptoms. However, for women who enter the menopause transition without having regular menstrual cycles (due to prior surgery, other medical conditions or ongoing hormonal contraception) the menopause cannot be identified by bleeding patterns and is defined as the permanent loss of ovarian function.\nVagina, uterus and bladder (urogenital tract).\nDuring the transition to menopause, menstrual patterns can show shorter cycling (by 2\u20137 days); longer cycles remain possible. There may be irregular bleeding (lighter, heavier, spotting). Dysfunctional uterine bleeding is often experienced by women approaching menopause due to the hormonal changes that accompany the menopause transition. Spotting or bleeding may simply be related to vaginal atrophy, a benign sore (polyp or lesion), or may be a functional endometrial response. The European Menopause and Andropause Society has released guidelines for assessment of the endometrium, which is usually the main source of spotting or bleeding.\nIn post-menopausal women, however, any unscheduled vaginal bleeding is of concern and requires an appropriate investigation to rule out the possibility of malignant diseases.\nUrogenital symptoms may appear during menopause and continue through postmenopause and include painful intercourse, vaginal dryness and atrophic vaginitis (thinning of the membranes of the vulva, the vagina, the cervix and the outer urinary tract). There may also be considerable shrinking and loss in elasticity of all of the outer and inner genital areas. Urinary urgency may also occur and urinary incontinence in some women.\nOther physical effects.\nThe most common physical symptoms of menopause are heavy night sweats, and hot flashes (also known as vasomotor symptoms). Sleeping problems and insomnia are also common. Other physical symptoms may be reported that are not specific to menopause but may be exacerbated by it, such as lack of energy, joint soreness, stiffness, back pain, breast enlargement, breast pain, heart palpitations, headache, dizziness, dry, itchy skin, thinning of the skin, tingling skin, rosacea, weight gain.\nMood and memory effects.\nPsychological symptoms are often reported but they are not specific to menopause and can be caused by other factors. They include anxiety, poor memory, inability to concentrate, depressive mood, irritability, mood swings, and less interest in sexual activity.\nMenopause-related cognitive impairment can be confused with the mild cognitive impairment that precedes dementia. There is evidence of small decreases in verbal memory, on average, which may be caused by the effects of declining estrogen levels on the brain, or perhaps by reduced blood flow to the brain during hot flashes. However, these tend to resolve for most women during the postmenopause. Subjective reports of memory and concentration problems are associated with several factors, such as lack of sleep, and stress.\nLong-term effects.\nCardiovascular health.\nExposure to endogenous estrogen during reproductive years provides women with protection against cardiovascular disease, which is lost around 10 years after the onset of menopause. The menopausal transition is associated with an increase in fat mass (predominantly in visceral fat), an increase in insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia, and endothelial dysfunction. Women with vasomotor symptoms during menopause seem to have an especially unfavorable cardiometabolic profile, as well as women with premature onset of menopause (before 45 years of age). These risks can be reduced by managing risk factors, such as tobacco smoking, hypertension, increased blood lipids and body weight.\nBone health.\nThe annual rates of bone mineral density loss are highest starting one year before the final menstrual period and continuing through the two years after it. Thus, post menopausal women are at increased risk of osteopenia, osteoporosis and fractures.\nCauses.\nMenopause is a normal event in a woman's life and a natural part of aging. Menopause can also be induced early. Induced menopause occurs as a result of medical treatment such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, oophorectomy, or complications of tubal ligation, hysterectomy, unilateral or bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy or leuprorelin usage.\nAge.\nMenopause typically occurs at some point between 47 and 54 years of age. According to various data, more than 95% of women have their last period between the ages of 44\u201356 (median 49\u201350). 2% of women under the age of 40, 5% between the ages of 40\u201345 and the same number between the ages of 55\u201358 have their last bleeding. The average age of the last period in the United States is 51 years, in Russia is 50 years, in Greece is 49 years, in Turkey is 47 years, in Egypt is 47 years and in India is 46 years. Beyond the influence of genetics, these differences are also due to early-life environmental conditions and associated with epigenetic effects. The menopausal transition or perimenopause leading up to menopause usually lasts 3\u20134 years (sometimes as long as 5\u201314 years).\nUndiagnosed and untreated coeliac disease is a risk factor for early menopause. Coeliac disease can present with several non-gastrointestinal symptoms, in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms, and most cases escape timely recognition and go undiagnosed, leading to a risk of long-term complications. A strict gluten-free diet reduces the risk. Women with early diagnosis and treatment of coeliac disease present a normal duration of fertile life span.\nWomen who have undergone hysterectomy with ovary conservation go through menopause on average 1.5 years earlier than the expected age.\nPremature ovarian insufficiency.\nIn rare cases, a woman's ovaries stop working at a very early age, ranging anywhere from the age of puberty to age 40. This is known as premature ovarian failure or premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) and affects 1 to 2% of women by age 40. It is diagnosed or confirmed by high blood levels of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) on at least three occasions at least four weeks apart.\nPremature ovarian insufficiency may be related to an auto immune disorder and therefore might co-occur with other autoimmune disorders such as thyroid disease, [adrenal insufficiency], and diabetes mellitus. Other causes include chemotherapy, being a carrier of the fragile X syndrome gene, and radiotherapy. However, in about 50\u201380% of cases of premature ovarian insufficiency, the cause is unknown, i.e., it is generally idiopathic.\nEarly menopause can be related to cigarette smoking, higher body mass index, racial and ethnic factors, illnesses, and the removal of the uterus.\nSurgical menopause.\nMenopause can be surgically induced by bilateral oophorectomy (removal of ovaries), which is often, but not always, done in conjunction with removal of the fallopian tubes (salpingo-oophorectomy) and uterus (hysterectomy). Cessation of menses as a result of removal of the ovaries is called \"surgical menopause\". Surgical treatments, such as the removal of ovaries, might cause periods to stop altogether. The sudden and complete drop in hormone levels may produce extreme withdrawal symptoms such as hot flashes, etc. The symptoms of early menopause may be more severe.\nRemoval of the uterus \"without\" removal of the ovaries does \"not\" directly cause menopause, although pelvic surgery of this type can often precipitate a somewhat earlier menopause, perhaps because of a compromised blood supply to the ovaries. The time between surgery and possible early menopause is due to the fact that ovaries are still producing hormones.\nMechanism.\nThe menopausal transition, and postmenopause itself, is a natural change, not usually a disease state or a disorder. The main cause of this transition is the natural depletion and aging of the finite amount of oocytes (ovarian reserve). This process is sometimes accelerated by other conditions and is known to occur earlier after a wide range of gynecologic procedures such as hysterectomy (with and without ovariectomy), endometrial ablation and uterine artery embolisation. The depletion of the ovarian reserve causes an increase in circulating follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels because there are fewer oocytes and follicles responding to these hormones and producing estrogen.\nThe transition has a variable degree of effects.\nThe stages of the menopause transition have been classified according to a woman's reported bleeding pattern, supported by changes in the pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels.\nIn younger women, during a normal menstrual cycle the ovaries produce estradiol, testosterone and progesterone in a cyclical pattern under the control of FSH and luteinizing hormone (LH), which are both produced by the pituitary gland. During perimenopause (approaching menopause), estradiol levels and patterns of production remain relatively unchanged or may increase compared to young women, but the cycles become frequently shorter or irregular. The often observed increase in estrogen is presumed to be in response to elevated FSH levels that, in turn, is hypothesized to be caused by decreased feedback by inhibin. Similarly, decreased inhibin feedback after hysterectomy is hypothesized to contribute to increased ovarian stimulation and earlier menopause.\nThe menopausal transition is characterized by marked, and often dramatic, variations in FSH and estradiol levels. Because of this, measurements of these hormones are \"not\" considered to be reliable guides to a woman's exact menopausal status.\nMenopause occurs because of the sharp decrease of estradiol and progesterone production by the ovaries. After menopause, estrogen continues to be produced mostly by aromatase in fat tissues and is produced in small amounts in many other tissues such as ovaries, bone, blood vessels, and the brain where it acts locally. The substantial fall in circulating estradiol levels at menopause impacts many tissues, from brain to skin.\nIn contrast to the sudden fall in estradiol during menopause, the levels of total and free testosterone, as well as dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) and androstenedione appear to decline more or less steadily with age. An effect of natural menopause on circulating androgen levels has not been observed. Thus specific tissue effects of natural menopause cannot be attributed to loss of androgenic hormone production.\nHot flashes and other vasomotor and body symptoms accompanying the menopausal transition are associated with estrogen insufficiency and changes that occur in the brain, primarily the hypothalamus and involve complex interplay between the neurotransmitters kisspeptin, neurokinin B, and dynorphin, which are found in KNDy neurons in the infundibular nucleus.\nOvarian aging.\nDecreased inhibin feedback after hysterectomy is hypothesized to contribute to increased ovarian stimulation and earlier menopause. Hastened ovarian aging has been observed after endometrial ablation. While it is difficult to prove that these surgeries are causative, it has been hypothesized that the endometrium may be producing endocrine factors contributing to the endocrine feedback and regulation of the ovarian stimulation. Elimination of these factors contributes to faster depletion of the ovarian reserve. Reduced blood supply to the ovaries that may occur as a consequence of hysterectomy and uterine artery embolisation has been hypothesized to contribute to this effect.\nImpaired DNA repair mechanisms may contribute to earlier depletion of the ovarian reserve during aging. As women age, double-strand breaks accumulate in the DNA of their primordial follicles. Primordial follicles are immature primary oocytes surrounded by a single layer of granulosa cells. An enzyme system is present in oocytes that ordinarily accurately repairs DNA double-strand breaks. This repair system is called \"homologous recombinational repair\", and it is especially effective during meiosis. Meiosis is the general process by which germ cells are formed in all sexual eukaryotes; it appears to be an adaptation for efficiently removing damages in germ line DNA.\nHuman primary oocytes are present at an intermediate stage of meiosis, termed prophase I (see Oogenesis). Expression of four key DNA repair genes that are necessary for homologous recombinational repair during meiosis (BRCA1, MRE11, Rad51, and ATM) decline with age in oocytes. This age-related decline in ability to repair DNA double-strand damages can account for the accumulation of these damages, that then likely contributes to the depletion of the ovarian reserve.\nDiagnosis.\nWays of assessing the impact on women of some of these menopause effects, include the Greene climacteric scale questionnaire, the Cervantes scale and the Menopause rating scale.\nPerimenopause.\nThe term \"perimenopause\", which literally means \"around the menopause\", refers to the menopause transition years before the date of the final episode of flow. According to the North American Menopause Society, this transition can last for four to eight years. The Centre for Menstrual Cycle and Ovulation Research describes it as a six- to ten-year phase ending 12 months after the last menstrual period.\nDuring perimenopause, estrogen levels average about 20\u201330% higher than during premenopause, often with wide fluctuations. These fluctuations cause many of the physical changes during perimenopause as well as menopause, especially during the last 1\u20132 years of perimenopause (before menopause). Some of these changes are hot flashes, night sweats, difficulty sleeping, mood swings, vaginal dryness or atrophy, incontinence, osteoporosis, and heart disease. Perimenopause is also associated with a higher likelihood of depression (affecting from 45 percent to 68 percent of perimenopausal women), which is twice as likely to affect those with a history of depression.\nDuring this period, fertility diminishes but is not considered to reach zero until the official date of menopause. The official date is determined retroactively, once 12 months have passed after the last appearance of menstrual blood.\nThe menopause transition typically begins between 40 and 50 years of age (average 47.5). The duration of perimenopause may be for up to eight years. Women will often, but not always, start these transitions (perimenopause and menopause) about the same time as their mother did.\nSome research appears to show that melatonin supplementation in perimenopausal women can improve thyroid function and gonadotropin levels, as well as restoring fertility and menstruation and preventing depression associated with menopause.\nPostmenopause.\nThe term \"postmenopausal\" describes women who have not experienced any menstrual flow for a minimum of 12 months, assuming that they have a uterus and are not pregnant or lactating. The reason for this delay in declaring postmenopause is that periods are usually erratic during menopause. Therefore, a reasonably long stretch of time is necessary to be sure that the cycling has ceased. At this point a woman is considered infertile; however, the possibility of becoming pregnant has usually been very low (but not quite zero) for a number of years before this point is reached.\nIn women with or without a uterus, menopause or postmenopause can also be identified by a blood test showing a very high follicle-stimulating hormone level, greater than 25 IU/L in a random blood draw; it rises as ovaries become inactive. FSH continues to rise, as its counterpart estradiol continues to drop for about 2 years after the last menstrual period, after which the levels of each of these hormones stabilize. The stabilization period after the begin of early postmenopause has been estimated to last 3 to 6 years, so early postmenopause lasts altogether about 5 to 8 years, during which hormone withdrawal effects such as hot flashes disappear. Finally, late postmenopause has been defined as the remainder of a woman's lifespan, when reproductive hormones do not change any more.\nA period-like flow during postmenopause, even spotting, may be a sign of endometrial cancer.\nManagement.\nPerimenopause is a natural stage of life. It is not a disease or a disorder. Therefore, it does not automatically require any kind of medical treatment. However, in those cases where the physical, mental, and emotional effects of perimenopause are strong enough that they significantly disrupt the life of the woman experiencing them, palliative medical therapy may sometimes be appropriate.\nMenopausal hormone therapy.\nIn the context of the menopause, menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is the use of estrogen in women without a uterus and estrogen plus progestogen in women who have an intact uterus.\nMHT may be reasonable for the treatment of menopausal symptoms, such as hot flashes. It is the most effective treatment option, especially when delivered as a skin patch. Its use, however, appears to increase the risk of strokes and blood clots. When used for menopausal symptoms the global recommendation is MHT should be prescribed for as long as there are defined treatment effects and goals for the individual woman.\nMHT is also effective for preventing bone loss and osteoporotic fracture, but it is generally recommended only for women at significant risk for whom other therapies are unsuitable.\nMHT may be unsuitable for some women, including those at increased risk of cardiovascular disease, increased risk of thromboembolic disease (such as those with obesity or a history of venous thrombosis) or increased risk of some types of cancer. There is some concern that this treatment increases the risk of breast cancer. Women at increased risk of cardiometabolic disease and VTE may be able to use transdermal estradiol which does not appear to increase risks in low to moderate doses.\nAdding testosterone to hormone therapy has a positive effect on sexual function in postmenopausal women, although it may be accompanied by hair growth or acne if used in excess. Transdermal testosterone therapy in appropriate dosing is generally safe.\nSelective estrogen receptor modulators.\nSERMs are a category of drugs, either synthetically produced or derived from a botanical source, that act selectively as agonists or antagonists on the estrogen receptors throughout the body. The most commonly prescribed SERMs are raloxifene and tamoxifen. Raloxifene exhibits oestrogen agonist activity on bone and lipids, and antagonist activity on breast and the endometrium. Tamoxifen is in widespread use for treatment of hormone sensitive breast cancer. Raloxifene prevents vertebral fractures in postmenopausal, osteoporotic women and reduces the risk of invasive breast cancer.\nOther medications.\nSome of the SSRIs and SNRIs appear to provide some relief from vasomotor symptoms. The most effective SSRIs and SNRIs are paroxetine, escitalopram, citalopram, venlafaxine, and desvenlafaxine. They may, however, be associated with appetite and sleeping problems, constipation and nausea.\nGabapentin or fezolinetant can also improve the frequency and severity of vasomotor symptoms. Side effects of using gabapentin include drowsiness and headaches.\nTherapy.\nCognitive behavioural therapy and clinical hypnosis can decrease the amount women are affected by hot flashes. Mindfulness is not yet proven to be effective in easing vasomotor symptoms.\nLifestyle and exercise.\nExercise has been thought to reduce postmenopausal symptoms through the increase of endorphin levels, which decrease as estrogen production decreases. However, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that exercise helps with the symptoms of menopause. Similarly, yoga has not been shown to be useful as a treatment for vasomotor symptoms.\nHowever a high BMI is a risk factor for vasomotor symptoms in particular. Weight loss may help with symptom management.\nThere is no strong evidence that cooling techniques such as using specific clothing or environment control tools (for example fans) help with symptoms. Paced breathing and relaxation are not effective in easing symptoms.\nResearch suggests that, as hormones and gut microbiome are intertwined in some ways, hormone fluctuations during menopause can alter the gut environment and microbial activity. This can contribute to menopausal symptoms, including weight gain and mood swings. Diet can support a healthy gut microbiome, and avoiding things like alcohol and added sugar, which can disrupt this environment, could mitigate symptoms.\nDietary supplements.\nThere is no evidence of consistent benefit of taking any dietary supplements or herbal products for menopausal symptoms. These widely marketed but ineffective supplements include soy isoflavones, pollen extracts, black cohosh, omega-3 among many others.\nAlternative medicine.\nThere is no evidence of consistent benefit of alternative therapies for menopausal symptoms despite their popularity.\nAs of 2023, there is no evidence to support the efficacy of acupuncture as a management for menopausal symptoms. The Cochrane review found not enough evidence in 2016 to show a difference between Chinese herbal medicine and placebo for the vasomotor symptoms.\nSociety and culture.\nAttitudes and experiences.\nThe menopause transition is a process, involving hormonal, menstrual, and typically vasomotor changes. However, the experience of the menopause as a whole is very much influenced by psychological and social factors, such as past experience, lifestyle, social and cultural meanings of menopause, and a woman's social and material circumstances. Menopause has been described as a biopsychosocial experience, with social and cultural factors playing a prominent role in the way menopause is experienced and perceived.\nThe paradigm within which a woman considers menopause influences the way she views it: women who understand menopause as a medical condition rate it significantly more negatively than those who view it as a life transition or a symbol of aging. There is some evidence that negative attitudes and expectations, held before the menopause, predict symptom experience during the menopause, and beliefs and attitudes toward menopause tend to be more positive in postmenopausal than in premenopausal women. Women with more negative attitudes towards the menopause report more symptoms during this transition.\nThough there has been a shift towards more public conversations around menopause, it is often still seen as a private process and is predominantly understood through the medical paradigm. Despite these growing conversations, the embodied experience of menopause is often reduced to biological symptoms rather than understood as a complex social and cultural process. Hot flashes are one of the most common symptoms of menopause. They are also associated with psychological symptoms such as anxiety and embarrassment.\nHeat and emotionality are frequently linked, which can socially associate hot flashes with a breakdown of emotional and physical regulation. This can be partially understood as hot flashes breaking down barriers between private, internal bodily processes and the external world, physically manifesting menopause. Observers of menopause have sometimes interpreted it as a complete loss of the ability to regulate emotions, an interpretation frequently at odds with how it is actually experienced by the individual.\nVictorian medical understandings \u2014 which positioned women's health as primarily controlled by the reproductive system \u2014 could have influenced ideas around hot flashes as revealing the dominance of reproductive control over the individual. Feminist critiques of medical treatment of menopause, however, have framed it as part of a broader social and political system \"that attempts to control the effects of the aging of the female body, which loses its social significance with the loss of reproductive capacity\". This tension between medicalisation and feminist perspectives highlights how menopause has been framed less as a natural life stage and more as a site of social regulation and control.\nMenopause is a stage of life experienced in different ways. It can be characterized by personal challenges, changes in personal roles within the family and society. Women's approaches to changes during menopause are influenced by their personal, family and sociocultural background. Women from different regions and countries also have different attitudes. Postmenopausal women had more positive attitudes toward menopause compared with peri- or premenopausal women. Other influencing factors of attitudes toward menopause include age, menopausal symptoms, psychological and socioeconomical status, and profession and ethnicity.\nEthnicity and geography play roles in the experience of menopause. American women of different ethnicities report significantly different types of menopausal effects. One major study found Caucasian women most likely to report what are sometimes described as psychosomatic symptoms, while African-American women were more likely to report vasomotor symptoms.\nThere may be variations in experiences of women from different ethnic backgrounds regarding menopause and care. Immigrant women reported more vasomotor symptoms and other physical symptoms and poorer mental health than non-immigrant women and were mostly dissatisfied with the care they had received. Self-management strategies for menopausal symptoms were also influenced by culture.\nTwo multinational studies of Asian women, found that hot flushes were not the most commonly reported symptoms, instead body and joint aches, memory problems, sleeplessness, irritability and migraines were. In another study comparing experiences of menopause amongst White Australian women and women in Laos, Australian women reported higher rates of depression, as well as fears of aging, weight gain and cancer \u2013 fears not reported by Laotian women, who positioned menopause as a positive event. Japanese women experience menopause effects, or \"k\u014dnenki\" (\u66f4\u5e74\u671f), in a different way from American women. Japanese women report lower rates of hot flashes and night sweats; this can be attributed to a variety of factors, both biological and social. Historically, \"k\u014dnenki\" was associated with wealthy middle-class housewives in Japan, i.e., it was a \"luxury disease\" that women from traditional, inter-generational rural households did not report. Menopause in Japan was viewed as a symptom of the inevitable process of aging, rather than a \"revolutionary transition\", or a \"deficiency disease\" in need of management. As of 2005, in Japanese culture, reporting of vasomotor symptoms has been on the increase, with research finding that of 140 Japanese participants, hot flashes were prevalent in 22.1%. This was almost double that of 20 years prior. Whilst the exact cause for this is unknown, possible contributing factors include dietary changes, increased medicalisation of middle-aged women and increased media attention on the subject. However, reporting of vasomotor symptoms is still \"significantly\" lower than in North America.\nAdditionally, while most women in the United States apparently have a negative view of menopause as a time of deterioration or decline, some studies seem to indicate that women from some Asian cultures have an understanding of menopause that focuses on a sense of liberation and celebrates the freedom from the risk of pregnancy. Diverging from these conclusions, one study appeared to show that many American women \"experience this time as one of liberation and self-actualization\".\nRecent biosocial and anthropological scholarship cautions against interpreting ethnic or national differences in menopausal timing and symptom burden as innate racial biology. A 2024 U.S. scoping review synthesizing fifteen studies reported that African American women, on average, reach natural menopause earlier than White women and report vasomotor symptoms more frequently. The review links these patterns to cumulative psychosocial stressors\u2014including racial discrimination, lower income, and heavy caregiving demands\u2014rather than to genetic difference. It also reports associations between intimate partner violence and childhood abuse with greater symptom severity, as well as higher hormone therapy use among women veterans, patterns interpreted as markers of heightened chronic stress exposure. These findings highlight how experiences of inequality and trauma can become biologically embedded, shaping health outcomes across the life course. Anthropological syntheses likewise emphasize \"local biologies,\" showing that symptom profiles vary across societies as labor rhythms, diet, clinical discourse, and life-course endocrinology interact. For example, Japanese women commonly report chilliness rather than hot flushes, and symptom labeling and expectations differ accordingly. This underscores that menopause is not only a physiological transition but also a socially mediated experience that reflects broader cultural environments. Together, these sources suggest that apparent disparities are best understood as embodied effects of unequal social conditions and culturally specific meanings. Explanations focused only on attitudes or estrogen may overlook wider social determinants and limit clinical care.\nIn some women, menopause may bring about a sense of loss related to the end of fertility. In addition, this change often aligns with other stressors, such as the responsibility of looking after elderly parents or dealing with the emotional challenges of \"empty nest syndrome\" when children move out of the family home. This situation can be accentuated in cultures where being older is negatively perceived.\nLGBTQIA+ experiences.\nThe experience of menopause for non-binary and transgender people can be especially difficult in relation to gender, as menopause is heavily defined as a feminine experience. Menopause is typically defined as the discontinuation of menstrual periods, the conclusion of fertility, and the finalisation of ovarian function \u2014 all of which are deeply connected to traditional understandings of gender and femininity. One study, published in the International Journal of Transgender Health, reported that non-binary individuals experienced menopause as having an impact on their gender identity, either positively or negatively, and that many also struggled to find supportive resources and spaces to share their experiences.\nSome participants further highlighted broader societal prejudices that undermined their sense of security \u2014 especially as menopause is still largely framed through traditional ideas of gender, hormones, and the female body. They also emphasised that many medical professionals lacked adequate understanding of menopause in relation to non-binary and transgender people. This lack of awareness often created barriers to accessing essential health services that recognised and met their needs. A 2021 UK GP Patient Survey found that while trans and non\u2011binary adults reported similar access to primary care as the general population, they were significantly less likely to feel involved in decisions about their treatment (85.0% versus 93.7%) and less likely to feel their needs were met overall (88.1% versus 95.2%).\nMenopause across cultures.\nMenopause is both viewed and experienced differently in cultures around the globe. From a Western perspective, focus on menopause tends to be more scientific, with an emphasis on the management of symptoms.\nIn post-war (modern) Japan, there has been a sharp increase in the medicalisation of menopause. Anthropologist Margaret Lock explores the cultural construction of the 'menopausal syndrome' present in Japanese rhetoric. Whilst symptoms of 'headaches, shoulder stiffness, and dizziness' are viewed as usual menopause symptoms, 'changes in endocrine function and in the autonomic nervous system' are classified as menopausal. The menopausal syndrome is perpetrated as being more common in housewives. This is because as they age, \"their traditional role [as a housewife] is in jeopardy\", creating larger susceptibility to stress. Menopausal syndrome is highly stigmatised and associated with being selfish, pleasure driven, and deficient in willpower. However, there is a significant difference between the rhetoric and statistical results. Lock reports that housewives do not experience higher menopausal symptoms. In her sample, 53% of women reported going through menopause, yet only 12% reported visiting the gynaecologist in the past two years, and only 2% had taken prescribed estrogen replacement therapy. A curation of the societal role of women, increasing medicalisation, economic concern, and the 'usefulness' of middle-aged women has led to this increasing debate over menopause in Japan. However, while both symptoms and rhetoric grow, so does the 'political consciousness' of Japanese middle-aged women.\nThroughout Mayan history, the cultural perception of menopause is primarily understood as a biological transitioning, rather than bearing any medical or societal significance. An article written by Yewoubdar Beyen delves into the experiences of menopause by Mayan women in Yucatan. Discoveries made by this study promote the cultural construction of menopause as \"unmarked\" by stigma, rituals or significance. The emphasis of menopause in Western societies differentiated from the Mayan perception, where it is beheld as a natural part of development, holding no substantiating symbolic importance. Beyen found that 68.2% of Mayan women reported no distressing health changes, which may suggest that the absence of medicalisation leads to a reduction of symptom reporting. Similar results were evident in Donna Stewart's investigation on Highland Guatemalan Mayan women who welcomed their symptoms and perceived them positively. Some Mayan women express a sense of liberation after menopause; free from menstruation and childbearing. Cross-cultural research affirms this, discovering that feelings around menopause varies through cultural interpretation. The absence of negative cultural connotations enables Mayan women for a more normalised transition to an older stage of life. Collectively, these discoveries challenge the Western model of menopause by exploring how neutral cultural beliefs shape experiences of menopause.\nA study conducted at Monash University saw 74% of post-menopausal Australian women under the age of 55 suffer from vasomotor symptoms, with 28% reporting them as \"severely bothersome\". It is statistics like this which have promoted the use of Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT), also known as Menopausal Hormone Therapy (MHT) in Australia. These ongoing studies have proven that for symptomatic women, non-hormonal remedies are significantly \"less effective than MHT\". This in turn has opened the floor for conversations surrounding menopause and its various symptoms, leading to further education for health professionals and women alike, through public health campaigns promoting evidence-based education.\nAlong with menopausal education in Australia, the importance of biocultural research in this area is being explored. An examination conducted by a team of female anthropologists at BMC Women's Health denotes that there is extensive research for Australian women as a collective while only two reports relating to the Indigenous population. Through this the anthropological team highlight the importance of understanding \"culture, social disadvantage\" and suggest that this would aid the population and improve \"management and support for Indigenous Australian women\".https://\nImpact on work.\nMidlife is typically a life stage when men and women may be dealing with demanding life events and responsibilities, such as work, health problems, and caring roles. For example, in 2018 in the UK women aged 45\u201354 report more work-related stress than men or women of any other age group. Hot flashes are often reported to be particularly distressing at work and lead to embarrassment and worry about potential stigmatisation. A June 2023 study by the Mayo Clinic estimated an annual loss of $1.8 billion in the United States due to workdays missed as a result of menopause symptoms. This was one of the largest studies to date examining the impact of menopause symptoms on work outcomes. The research concluded there was a strong need to improve medical treatment for menopausal women and make the workplace environment more supportive to avoid such productivity losses.\nEtymology.\nMenopause literally means the \"end of monthly cycles\" (the end of monthly periods or menstruation), from the Greek word \"pausis\" (\"pause\") and \"m\u0113n\" (\"month\"). This is a medical coinage; the Greek word for menses is actually different. In Ancient Greek, the menses were described in the plural, (\"the monthlies\"), and its modern descendant has been clipped to \"ta emm\u0113na\". The Modern Greek medical term is \"emmenopausis\" in Katharevousa or \"emmenopausi\" in Demotic Greek. The Ancient Greeks did not produce medical concepts about any symptoms associated with end of menstruation and did not use a specific word to refer to this time of a woman's life. The word menopause was invented by French doctors at the beginning of the nineteenth century. Greek etymology was reconstructed at this time and it was the Parisian student doctor Charles-Pierre-Louis de Gardanne who invented a variation of the word in 1812, which was edited to its final French form in 1821.\nSome of them noted that peasant women had no complaints about the end of menses, while urban middle-class women had many troubling symptoms. Doctors at this time considered the symptoms to be the result of urban lifestyles of sedentary behaviour, alcohol consumption, too much time indoors, and over-eating, with a lack of fresh fruit and vegetables.\nThe word \"menopause\" was coined specifically for female humans, where the end of fertility is traditionally indicated by the permanent stopping of monthly menstruations. However, menopause exists in some other animals, many of which do not have monthly menstruation; in this case, the term means a natural end to fertility that occurs before the end of the natural lifespan.\nIn popular culture, law and politics.\nIn the 21st century, celebrities have spoken out about their experiences of the menopause, which has led to it becoming less of a taboo as it has boosted awareness of the debilitating symptoms. Subsequently, TV shows have been running features on the menopause to help women experiencing symptoms. In the UK Lorraine Kelly has been an advocate for getting women to speak about their experiences including sharing her own. This has led to an increase in women seeking treatment such as HRT. Davina McCall also led an awareness campaign based on a documentary on Channel 4.\nIn the UK, Carolyn Harris sponsored the Menopause (Support and Services) Bill in June 2021. It was to exempt hormone replacement therapy from National Health Service prescription charges and to make provisions about menopause support and services, including public education and communication in supporting perimenopausal and post-menopausal women, and to raise awareness of menopause and its effects. The bill was withdrawn on 29 October 2021.\nIn the US, David McKinley, Republican from West Virginia introduced the Menopause Research Act in September 2022 for $100 million in 2023 and 2024, but it stalled.\nOther animals.\nThe majority of mammal species reach menopause when they cease the production of ovarian follicles, which contain eggs (oocytes), between one-third and two-thirds of their maximum possible lifespan. However, few live long enough in the wild to reach this point. Humans are joined by a limited number of other species in which females live substantially longer than their ability to reproduce. Examples of others include cetaceans: beluga whales, narwhals, orcas, false killer whales and short-finned pilot whales.\nMenopause has been reported in a variety of other vertebrate species, but these examples tend to be from captive individuals, and thus are not necessarily representative of what happens in natural populations in the wild. Menopause in captivity has been observed in several species of nonhuman primates, including rhesus macaques and chimpanzees. Some research suggests that wild chimpanzees do not experience menopause, as their fertility declines are associated with declines in overall health. Menopause has been reported in elephants in captivity and guppies. Dogs do not experience menopause; the canine estrus cycle simply becomes irregular and infrequent. Although older female dogs are not considered good candidates for breeding, offspring have been produced by older animals, see Canine reproduction. Similar observations have been made in cats.\nLife histories show a varying degree of senescence; rapid senescing organisms (e.g., Pacific salmon and annual plants) do not have a post-reproductive life-stage. Gradual senescence is exhibited by all placental mammalian life histories.\nEvolution.\nThere are various theories on the origin and process of the evolution of the menopause. These attempt to suggest evolutionary benefits to the human species stemming from the cessation of women's reproductive capability before the end of their natural lifespan. It is conjectured that in highly social groups natural selection favors females that stop reproducing and devote that post-reproductive life span to continuing to care for existing offspring, both their own and those of others to whom they are related, especially their granddaughters and grandsons.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Her conversion to Catholicism and refusal to marry led her to relinquish her throne and move to Rome.\nChristina is remembered as one of the most erudite women of the 17th century, wanting Stockholm to become the \"Athens of the North\" and was given the special right to establish a university at will by the Peace of Westphalia. She is also remembered for her unconventional lifestyle and occasional adoption of masculine attire, which have been depicted frequently in media; gender and cultural identity are pivotal themes in many of her biographies.\nAt the age of five, Christina succeeded her father Gustavus Adolphus upon his death at the Battle of L\u00fctzen, though she only began ruling the Swedish Empire when she reached the age of eighteen. During the Torstenson War in 1644, she initiated the issuance of copper in lumps to be used as currency. Her lavish spending habits pushed the state towards bankruptcy, sparking public unrest. Christina argued for peace to end the Thirty Years' War and received indemnity. Following scandals over her converting to Catholicism, and not marrying, she relinquished the throne to her cousin Charles X Gustav and settled in Rome.\nPope Alexander VII described Christina as \"a queen without a realm, a Christian without faith, and a woman without shame.\" She played a leading part in the theatrical and musical communities and protected many Baroque artists, composers, and musicians. Christina, who was the guest of five consecutive popes and a symbol of the Counter-Reformation, is one of the few women buried in the Vatican Grottoes.\nEarly life.\nChristina was born in the royal castle Tre Kronor. Her parents were the Swedish king Gustavus Adolphus and his German wife, Maria Eleonora. They had a stillborn female in 1621, then the first Princess Christina, who was born in 1623 and died the following year, and a stillborn male in May 1625. Excited expectations surrounded Maria Eleonora's fourth pregnancy in 1626. When the baby was born, it was first thought to be a boy. It was \"hairy\" and screamed \"with a strong, hoarse voice.\" She later wrote in her autobiography that \"Deep embarrassment spread among the women when they discovered their mistake.\" The king, though, was very happy, saying, \"She'll be clever, she has made fools of us all!\" Gustavus Adolphus was closely attached to his daughter, whereas her mother remained aloof in her disappointment at the child being a girl. In the year after Christina's birth, Maria Eleonora was described as being in a state of hysteria owing to her husband's absences. She showed little affection for her daughter and was not allowed any influence in Christina's upbringing. The king was worried that her instability might pass on to their daughter.\nThe Crown of Sweden was hereditary in the House of Vasa, but following the reign of Christina's grandfather Charles IX (r. 1604\u201311), it excluded Vasa princes descended from a deposed brother (Eric XIV of Sweden) and a deposed nephew (Sigismund III of Poland). Gustavus Adolphus's legitimate younger brother Charles Philip had died years earlier. The one legitimate female left, his half-sister Catherine, came to be excluded in 1615 when she married John Casimir, Count Palatine of Kleeburg, a non-Lutheran. Christina became the undisputed heir presumptive. From Christina's birth, King Gustav Adolphus recognized her eligibility even as a female heir, and although she was called \"queen,\" the official title the Riksdag gave at her coronation in February 1633 was \"king\".\nRegency.\nIn June 1630, when Christina was three years old, Gustavus Adolphus left for Germany to defend Protestantism and became involved in the Thirty Years' War. He secured his daughter's right to inherit the throne, in case he never returned, and gave orders to Axel Gustafsson Ban\u00e9r, his marshal, that Christina should receive an education of the type normally only afforded to boys.\nWhen Gustavus Adolphus did not come home as expected after the summer campaign of 1630, Maria wrote to John Casimir, her brother-in-law that she could not stand it; she wanted to die. She begged him to try to persuade the king to come home. It was decided that Maria would travel to Germany the following spring. She arrived on 10 July 1631, to Wolgast in Pomerania. On 11 January 1632, she met with her spouse near Hanau. The couple were spotted for the last time on 28 October 1632 at Erfurt. The very next day, Gustavus Adolphus broke camp and left. On 3 November, Maria wrote to Axel Oxenstierna: \"without H.R.M.'s presence, I am worth nothing, not even my life.\"\nMaria, her mother and a member of the House of Hohenzollern, was said to be the most beautiful queen in Europe, but she was also considered hysterical, unstable and overly emotional. It has been suggested that she inherited madness, from both the paternal and maternal lines. However, this image of the hysterical, depressive and profligate queen dowager, which has become part of historiography, first in the 1980s by the archivist \u00c5ke Kromnov, among others, and more recently in the monograph \"Drottningen som sa nej\" by Moa Matthis, published in 2010.\nAfter the king died on the battlefield on 6\u00a0November 1632, Maria Eleonora returned to Sweden with the embalmed body of her husband. The 7-year-old Queen Christina came in solemn procession to Nyk\u00f6ping to receive her mother. Maria Eleonora declared that the burial should not take place during her lifetime - she often spoke of shortening her life - or at least should be postponed as long as possible. She also demanded that the coffin be kept open and went to see it regularly, patting it and taking no notice of the putrefaction. They tried to persuade Maria not to visit the corpse so often. Axel Oxenstierna managed to have the corpse interred in Riddarholmen Church on 22\u00a0June 1634, but had to post guards after she tried to dig it up.\nMaria Eleanora had been indifferent to her daughter, but after Gustavus Adolphus's death, Christina became the center of her mother's attention. Gustavus Adolphus had decided that in the event of his death, his daughter should be cared for by his half-sister, Catherine of Sweden and half-brother Carl Gyllenhielm as regent. This solution did not suit Maria Eleonora, who had her sister-in-law banned from the castle. In 1634, the Instrument of Government, a new constitution, was introduced by Oxenstierna. The constitution stipulated that the \"King\" must have a Privy Council, which Oxenstierna himself headed.\nMaria Eleonora was considered very difficult, and in 1636 she lost her parental rights to her daughter. The Riksr\u00e5d justified its decision by asserting that she neglected Christina and her upbringing and that she had a bad influence on her daughter. Chancellor Oxenstierna saw no other solution than to exile the widow to Gripsholm castle, while the governing regency council would decide when she was allowed to see her daughter. For the subsequent years, Christina thrived in the company of her aunt Catherine and her family.\nIn 1638, after the death of her aunt and foster mother, the Royal Regency Council under Axel Oxenstierna saw the need to appoint a new foster mother to the underage monarch, which resulted in a reorganization of the queen's household. To prevent the young queen from being dependent upon a single individual and favorite mother figure, the Royal Council decided to split the office of head lady-in-waiting (responsible for the queen's female courtiers) and the office royal governess (or foster-mother) in four, with two women appointed to share each office. Accordingly, Ebba Leijonhufvud and Christina Natt och Dag were appointed to share the position of royal governess and foster mother with the title \"Upptuktelse-F\u00f6rest\u00e5nderska\" ('Castigation Mistress'), while Beata Oxenstierna and Ebba Ryning were appointed to share the position of head lady-in-waiting, all four with the formal rank and title of \"Hovm\u00e4starinna\".\nThe Royal Council's method of giving Queen Christina several foster mothers to avoid her forming an attachment to a single person appears to have been effective, as Christina did not mention her foster mothers directly in her memoirs and did not seem to have formed an attachment to any of them; in fact, with only a few exceptions, including Ebba Sparre, Lady Jane Ruthven and Louise van der Nooth, Christina did not show any interest in any of her female courtiers. She generally mentions them in her memoirs only to compare herself favorably toward them by referring to herself as more masculine than they.\nChristina was educated as a royal male would have been. The theologian Johannes Matthiae Gothus became her tutor; he gave her lessons in religion, philosophy, Greek and Latin. Chancellor Oxenstierna taught her politics and discussed Tacitus with her. Oxenstierna proudly wrote of the 14-year-old girl that \"she is not at all like a female\" and had \"a bright intelligence.\" Christina seemed happy to study ten hours a day. Besides Swedish and German, she learned at least six more languages: Dutch, Danish, French, Italian, Arabic and Hebrew.\nReign.\nIn 1644, at the age of 18, Christina was declared an adult, although the coronation was postponed because of the Torstenson War. She was visited by a group of Dutch diplomats, including Johan de Witt, to find a solution for the Sound Dues. In the Treaty of Br\u00f6msebro, signed at a creek in Blekinge, Denmark added the isles of Gotland and \u00d6sel to Christina's domain while Norway lost the districts of J\u00e4mtland and H\u00e4rjedalen to her. Under Christina's rule, Sweden, virtually controlling the Baltic Sea, had unrestricted access to the North Sea and was no longer encircled by Denmark\u2013Norway.\nChancellor Oxenstierna soon discovered that her political views differed from his own. In 1645, he sent his son, Johan Oxenstierna, to the Peace Congress in the Westphalian city of Osnabr\u00fcck, to argue against peace with the Holy Roman Empire. Christina, however, wanted peace at any cost and sent her own delegate, Johan Adler Salvius.\nThe Peace of Westphalia was signed in October 1648, effectively ending the European wars of religion. Sweden received an indemnity of five million thalers, used primarily to pay its troops. Sweden further received Western Pomerania (henceforth Swedish Pomerania), Wismar, the Archbishopric of Bremen, and the Bishopric of Verden as hereditary fiefs, thus gaining a seat and vote in the Diet of the Holy Roman Empire and in the respective diets (\"Kreistage\") of three Imperial Circles: the Upper Saxon Circle, Lower Saxon Circle, and Lower Rhenish-Westphalian Circle; the city of Bremen was disputed.\nShortly before the conclusion of the peace settlement, she admitted Salvius into the council, against Oxenstierna's wishes. Salvius was no aristocrat, but Christina wanted the opposition to the aristocracy present. In 1649, with the help of her uncle, John Casimir, Christina tried to reduce the influence of Oxenstierna when she declared her cousin Charles Gustav as her heir presumptive. The following year, Christina resisted demands from the other estates (clergy, burghers, and peasants) in the Riksdag of the Estates for the reduction of the number of noble landholdings that were tax-exempt. She never implemented such a policy. In 1649, Louis de Geer founded the Swedish Africa Company and in 1650, Christina hired Hendrik Carloff to improve trade on the Gold Coast. Her reign also saw the founding of the colony of New Sweden in 1638; it lasted until 1655.\nPatronage of the arts.\nChristina has been described as the \"Minerva of the North\" due to her strong support of arts and academics. In 1645, Christina invited Hugo Grotius, the author of \"Mare Liberum\", to become her librarian, but he died on his way in Rostock. That same year she founded \"Ordinari Post Tijdender\" (\"Regular Mail Times\"), the oldest currently published newspaper in the world. In 1647, Johann Freinsheim was appointed as her librarian. During the Thirty Years' War, Swedish troops looted books from conquered territories and dispatched them to Sweden to win favour with Christina. After the Battle of Prague (1648), when her armies looted Prague Castle, many of the treasures collected by Rudolph II were brought back to Stockholm. Thus, Christina acquired a number of valuable illustrated works and rare manuscripts for her library. The inventory drawn up at the time mentions 100 \"an allerhand Kunstb\u00fcchern\" (\"a hundred art books of different kinds\"), among them two world-famous manuscripts: the and the .\nIn 1649, 760 paintings, 170 marble and 100 bronze statues, 33,000 coins and medallions, 600 pieces of crystal, 300 scientific instruments, manuscripts, and books (including the by Rabanus Maurus) were transported to Stockholm. The art, from Prague Castle, had belonged to Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor and had been captured by Hans Christoff von K\u00f6nigsmarck during the Battle of Prague and the negotiations of the Peace of Westphalia. By 1649\u20131650, \"her desire to collect men of learning round her, as well as books and rare manuscripts, became almost a mania\", Goldsmith wrote. To catalog her new collection she asked Isaac Vossius to come to Sweden and Heinsius to purchase more books on the market.\nHer ambitions naturally demanded a wide-ranging correspondence. Not infrequently, she sat and wrote far into the night while the servants came and went with new wax candles. The \"Semiramis from the North\" corresponded with Pierre Gassendi, her favorite author. Blaise Pascal offered her a copy of his pascaline. She had a firm grasp of classical history and philosophy. Christina studied Neostoicism, the Church Fathers, and Islam; she systematically looked for a copy of the \"Treatise of the Three Impostors\", a work bestowing doubt on all organized religion. In 1651, the kabbalist Menasseh ben Israel offered to become her agent or librarian for Hebrew books and manuscripts; they discussed his messianic ideas as he had recently spelled them out in his latest book, \"Hope of Israel\". Other illustrious scholars who came to visit were Claude Saumaise, Johannes Schefferus, Olaus Rudbeck, Johann Heinrich Boeckler, Gabriel Naud\u00e9, Christian Ravis, Nicolaas Heinsius and Samuel Bochart, together with Pierre Daniel Huet and Marcus Meibomius, who wrote a book about Greek dance.\nChristina was interested in theatre, especially the plays of Pierre Corneille; she was herself an amateur actress. From 1638 Oxenstierna employed a French ballet troupe under Antoine de Beaulieu, who also had to teach Christina to move around more elegantly. In 1647, the Italian architect Antonio Brunati was ordered to build a theatrical setting in one of the larger rooms of the palace. In 1648, she commissioned 35 paintings from Jacob Jordaens for a ceiling in Uppsala Castle. The court poet Georg Stiernhielm wrote several plays in the Swedish language, such as \"Den f\u00e5ngne Cupido eller Laviancu de Diane\", performed with Christina taking the main part of the goddess Diana. She invited foreign companies to play at Bollhuset. An Italian opera troupe visited in 1652 with Vincenzo Albrici and Angelo Michele Bartolotti, a guitarist. A Dutch theater troupe with Ariana Nozeman, Elisabeth de Baer and Susanna van Lee visited her in 1653. Among the French artists she employed was Anne Chabanceau de La Barre, who was made court singer.\nDescartes.\nIn 1646, Christina's good friend, the French ambassador Pierre Chanut, met and corresponded with the philosopher Ren\u00e9 Descartes, asking him for a copy of his \"Meditations\". Upon showing the queen some of the letters, Christina became interested in beginning a correspondence with Descartes. She invited him to Sweden, but Descartes was reluctant until she asked him to organize a scientific academy. Christina sent a ship to pick up the philosopher and 2,000 books. Descartes arrived on 4\u00a0October 1649. He resided with Chanut and finished his \"Passions of the Soul\". It is highly unlikely Descartes wrote a \"Ballet de la Naissance de la Paix,\" performed on her birthday. On the day after, 19\u00a0December 1649, he probably started his private lessons for the queen. With Christina's strict schedule, he was invited to the cold and draughty castle at 5:00 am daily to discuss philosophy and religion. Soon, it became clear they did not like each other; she disapproved of his mechanical view, and he did not appreciate her interest in Ancient Greek. On 15 January Descartes wrote he had seen Christina only four or five times. On 1\u00a0February 1650, Descartes caught a cold. He died ten days later, early in the morning of 11 February 1650, and according to Chanut, the cause of his death was pneumonia.\nMarriage issue.\nBy the age of nine, Christina was already impressed by the Catholic religion and the merits of celibacy. She read a biography of the virgin queen Elizabeth I of England with interest. But Christina understood that she was expected to provide an heir to the Swedish throne. Her first cousin Charles was infatuated with her, and they became secretly engaged before he left in 1642 to serve in the Swedish army in Germany for three years. Christina revealed in her autobiography that she felt \"an insurmountable distaste for marriage\" and \"for all the things that females talked about and did.\" She once stated, \"It takes more courage to marry than to go to war.\" As she was chiefly occupied with her studies, she slept three to four hours a night, forgot to comb her hair, donned her clothes in a hurry and wore men's shoes for the sake of convenience. (In fact, her permanent bed-head became her trademark look in paintings.) When Christina left Sweden, she continued to write passionate letters to her intimate friend Ebba Sparre, in which she told her that she would always love her. However, such emotional letters were relatively common at that time, and Christina would use the same style when writing to women she had never met but whose writings she admired. \nCoronation.\nChristina's coronation took place on 22 October 1650. Christina went to the castle of Jacobsdal, where she boarded a coronation carriage draped in black velvet embroidered in gold and pulled by three white horses. The procession to Storkyrkan was so long that when the first carriages arrived, the last ones had not yet left Jacobsdal (a distance of roughly 10.5\u00a0km or 6.5 miles). All four estates were invited to dine at the castle. Fountains at the marketplace splashed out wine for three days, a whole roast ox was served, and illuminations sparkled, followed by a themed parade (\"The Illustrious Splendors of Felicity\") on 24 October.\nReligion and health.\nHer tutor, Johannes Matthiae, influenced by John Dury and Comenius, who since 1638 had been working on a new Swedish school system, represented a gentler attitude than most Lutherans. In 1644, he suggested a new church order, but it was voted down as this was interpreted as Crypto-Calvinism. Queen Christina defended him against the advice of Chancellor Oxenstierna, but three years later, the proposal had to be withdrawn. In 1647, the clergy wanted to introduce the Book of Concord ()\u00a0\u2013 a book defining correct Lutheranism versus heresy, making some aspects of free theological thinking impossible. Matthiae was strongly opposed to this and was again backed by Christina. The Book of Concord was not introduced.\nIn 1651, after reigning for almost twenty years, working at least ten hours a day, Christina had a nervous breakdown or burnout. For an hour, she seemed to be dead. She suffered from high blood pressure and complained about bad eyesight and her crooked back. She had already seen many court physicians. In February 1652, the French doctor Pierre Bourdelot arrived in Stockholm. Unlike most doctors of that time, he held no faith in blood-letting; instead, he ordered sufficient sleep, warm baths, and healthy meals, in contrast to Christina's hitherto ascetic way of life. She was only twenty-five; and advising that she should take more pleasure in life, Bourdelot asked her to stop studying and working so hard and to remove the books from her apartments.\nFor years, Christina knew by heart all the poems from the Ars Amatoria and was keen on the works by Martial and Petronius. The physician showed her the 16 erotic sonnets of Pietro Aretino, which he kept secretly in his luggage. By subtle means, Bourdelot undermined her principles. Having been Stoic, she now became an Epicurean. Her mother and de la Gardie were very much against the activities of Bourdelot and tried to convince her to change her attitude towards him; Bourdelot returned to France in 1653 \"laden in riches and curses\".\nThe Queen had long conversations about Copernicus, Tycho Brahe, Francis Bacon, and Kepler with Antonio Macedo, secretary and interpreter for Portugal's ambassador. Macedo was a Jesuit, and in August 1651, smuggled on his person a letter from Christina to his general in Rome. In reply, Paolo Casati and Francesco Malines, trained in both natural sciences and theology, came to Sweden in the spring of 1652. She had more conversations with them, being interested in Catholic views on sin, the immortality of the soul, rationality, and free will. The two scholars revealed her plans to Cardinal Fabio Chigi. Around May 1652 Christina, raised in the Lutheran Church of Sweden, decided to become Catholic. She sent Matthias Palbitzki to Madrid and King Philip IV of Spain sent the diplomat Antonio Pimentel de Prado to Stockholm in August.\nAbdication.\nOn 26 February 1649, Christina announced that she had decided not to marry and instead wanted her first cousin Charles Gustav to be heir to the throne. While the nobility objected to this, the three other estates\u00a0\u2013 clergy, burghers, and peasants\u00a0\u2013 accepted it. She agreed to stay on the condition the councils never again asked her to marry. In 1651, Christina lost much of her popularity after the beheading of Arnold Johan Messenius, together with his 17-year-old son, who had accused her of serious misbehavior and of being a \"Jezebel\". According to them \"Christina was bringing everything to ruin, and that she cared for nothing but sport and pleasure.\"\nIn 1653, she founded the Amaranten order. Antonio Pimentel was appointed as its first knight; all members had to promise not to marry (again). In the same year, she ordered Vossius (and Heinsius) to make a list of about 6,000 books and manuscripts to be packed and shipped to Antwerp. In February 1654, she plainly told the Council of her plans to abdicate. Oxenstierna told her she would regret her decision within a few months. Her steadfastness 10 days prior to the abdication ceremony was commended by Bulstrode Whitelocke, commenting, \"An act of strange constancy and fixedness of resolution\". In May, the Riksdag discussed her proposals. She had asked for 200,000 \"rikstalers\" a year but received dominions instead. Financially she was secured through a pension and revenue from the town of Norrk\u00f6ping, the isles of Gotland, \u00d6land, \u00d6sel, and Poel, Wolgast and Neukloster in Mecklenburg, and estates in Pomerania. \nHer plan to convert was not the only reason for her abdication, as there was increasing discontent with her arbitrary and wasteful ways. Within ten years, she and Oxenstierna had created 17 counts, 46 barons, and 428 lesser nobles. To provide these new peers with adequate appanages, they had sold or mortgaged crown property representing an annual income of 1,200,000 rikstalers. During the ten years of her reign, the number of noble families increased from 300 to about 600, rewarding people such as Lennart Torstenson, Louis De Geer and Johan Palmstruch for their efforts. These donations took place with such haste that they were not always registered, and on some occasions, the same piece of land was given away twice.\nChristina abdicated her throne on 6 June 1654 in favor of Charles Gustav. During the abdication ceremony at Uppsala Castle, Christina wore her regalia, which were ceremonially removed from her, one by one. Per Brahe, who was supposed to remove the crown, did not move, so she had to take the crown off herself. Dressed in a simple white taffeta dress, she gave her farewell speech with a faltering voice, thanked everyone, and left the throne to Charles X Gustav, who was dressed in black. Per Brahe felt that she \"stood there as pretty as an angel.\" Charles Gustav was crowned later on that day. Christina left the country within a few days.\nDeparture and exile.\nIn the summer of 1654, Christina left Sweden in men's clothing with the help of Bernardino de Rebolledo and rode as Count Dohna through Denmark. Relations between the two countries were still so tense that a former Swedish queen could not have traveled safely in Denmark. Christina had already packed and shipped abroad valuable books, paintings, statues, and tapestries from her Stockholm castle, leaving its treasures severely depleted.\nChristina visited Frederick III, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp and, while there, thought that her successor should have a bride. She sent letters recommending two of the Duke's daughters to Charles. Based on this recommendation, he married Hedwig Eleonora. On 10 July Christina arrived in Hamburg and stayed with Jacob Curiel at Krameramtsstuben.\nChristina visited Johann Friedrich Gronovius, and Anna Maria van Schurman in the Dutch Republic.\nIn August, she arrived in the Southern Netherlands and settled down in Antwerp. For four months Christina was lodged in the mansion of a Jewish merchant. She was visited by Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria; the Prince de Cond\u00e9, the ambassador Pierre Chanut, as well as the former governor of Norway, Hannibal Sehested. In the afternoons, she went for a ride, and each evening, parties were held; there was always a play to watch or music to listen to. Christina quickly ran out of money and had to sell some of her tapestries, silverware, and jewelry. When her financial situation did not improve, the archduke invited her to his Brussels palace on Coudenberg. On 24 December 1654, she converted to the Catholic faith in the archduke's chapel in the presence of the Dominican Juan Gu\u00eames, Raimondo Montecuccoli and Pimentel. Baptized as Kristina Augusta, she adopted the name Christina Alexandra. She did not declare her conversion in public, in case the Swedish council might refuse to pay her alimony. In addition, Sweden was preparing for war against Pomerania, which meant that her income from there was considerably reduced. The pope and Philip IV of Spain could not support her openly either, as she was not publicly a Catholic yet. Christina succeeded in arranging a major loan, leaving books and statues to settle her debts.\nIn September, she left for Italy with her entourage of 255 persons and 247 horses. The pope's messenger, the librarian Lucas Holstenius, himself a convert, waited for her in Innsbruck. On 3 November 1655, Christina announced her conversion to Catholicism in the Hofkirche and wrote to Pope Alexander VII and her cousin Charles X about it. To celebrate her official conversion, , an opera by Antonio Cesti, was performed. Ferdinand Charles, Archduke of Austria, already in financial trouble, is said to have been almost ruined by her visit. Her departure was on 8 November.\nSetting off to Rome.\nThe southbound journey through Italy was planned in detail by the Vatican and included brilliant triumphs in Ferrara, Bologna, Faenza and Rimini. In Pesaro, Christina became acquainted with the handsome brothers Santinelli, who so impressed her with their poetry and adeptness of dancing that she took them into service, as well as a certain Gian Rinaldo Monaldeschi. The official entry into Rome took place on 20 December, in a sedan chair designed by Bernini through Porta Flaminia, which today is known as Porta del Popolo. Christina met Bernini on the next day, she invited him to her apartment the same evening and they became lifelong friends. \"Two days afterwards she was conducted to the Vatican Basilica, where the pope gave her confirmation. It was then that she received from the pope her second name of Alexandra, the feminine form of his own.\" She was granted her own wing inside the Vatican, decorated by Bernini.\nChristina's visit to Rome was the triumph of Pope Alexander VII and the occasion for splendid Baroque festivities. For several months, she was the only preoccupation of the Pope and his court. The nobles vied for her attention and treated her to a never-ending round of fireworks, jousts, mock duels, acrobatics, and operas. On 31 January \"Vita Humana\" an opera by Marco Marazzoli was performed. At the Palazzo Barberini, where she was welcomed on 28 February by a few hundred privileged spectators, she watched an amazing carousel in the courtyard.\nPalazzo Farnese.\nChristina finally settled down in the Palazzo Farnese, which belonged to the Duke of Parma. Every Wednesday she held the palace open to visitors from the higher classes who kept themselves busy with poetry and intellectual discussions. Christina opened an academy in the palace on 24 January 1656, called Academy of Arcadia, where the participants enjoyed music, theater, and literature. The poet Reyer Anslo was presented to her. Belonging to the Arcadia-circle was also Francesco Negri, a Franciscan from Ravenna who is regarded as the first tourist to visit North Cape, Norway. Another Franciscan was the Swede Lars Skytte, who, under the name pater Laurentius, served as Christina's confessor for eight years.\nTwenty-nine-year-old Christina gave occasion to much gossip when socializing freely with men her own age. One of them was Cardinal Decio Azzolino, who had been a secretary to the ambassador in Spain, and responsible for the Vatican's correspondence with European courts. He was also the leader of the \"Squadrone Volante\", the free-thinking \"Flying Squad\" movement within the Catholic Church. Christina and Azzolino were so close that the pope asked him to shorten his visits to her palace, but they remained lifelong friends. In a letter on 26 January 1676 to Azzolino, Christina writes (in French) that she would never offend God or give Azzolino reason to take offense, but this \"does not prevent me from loving you until death, and since piety relieves you from being my lover, then I relieve you from being my servant, for I shall live and die as your slave.\" As he had promised to remain celibate, his replies were more reserved. In the meantime Christina learned that the Swedes had confiscated all her revenue as the princess had become a Catholic.\nVisits to France and Italy.\nKing Philip IV of Spain ruled the Duchy of Milan and the Kingdom of Naples. The French politician Mazarin, an Italian himself, had attempted to liberate Naples from Spanish rule, against which the locals had fought before the Neapolitan Republic was created. A second expedition in 1654 had failed and the Duke of Guise gave up. Christina's goal was to become a mediator between France and Spain in their contest to control Naples. Her plan detailed that she would lead French troops to take Naples and rule until bequeathing the crown to France after her death. Christina sent home all her Spanish servants, including her confidant Pimentel and her confessor Gu\u00eames. On 20 July 1656 Christina set sail from Civitavecchia for Marseille where she arrived nine days later. In early August, she traveled to Paris, accompanied by the Duke of Guise. Mazarin gave her no official sponsorship but gave instructions that she be celebrated and entertained in every town on her way north.\nOn 8 September she arrived in Paris and was shown around; ladies were shocked by her masculine appearance and demeanor and the unguarded freedom of her conversation. When visiting the ballet with la Grande Mademoiselle, she, as the latter recalls, \"surprised me very much \u2013 applauding the parts which pleased her, taking God to witness, throwing herself back in her chair, crossing her legs, resting them on the arms of her chair, and assuming other postures, such as I had never seen taken but by Travelin and Jodelet, two famous buffoons... She was in all respects a most extraordinary creature\".\nChristina was treated with respect by the young Louis XIV and his mother, Anne of Austria, in Compi\u00e8gne. On 22 September 1656, the arrangement between her and Louis XIV was ready. He would recommend Christina as queen to the Kingdom of Naples and serve as guarantor against Spanish aggression. As Queen of Naples, she would be financially independent of the Swedish king, and also capable of negotiating peace between France and Spain.\nOn her way back Christina visited French courtesan and author Ninon de l'Enclos in the convent at Lagny-sur-Marne. In early October, she left France and arrived in Turin. During the winter Christina lived in the apostolic palace in Pesaro, probably to flee the plague which infested several regions including Naples. During the Naples Plague (1656) almost half of the population died within two years. In July 1657, she returned to France, either being impatient or not so anxious to become queen of Naples. \nThe death of Monaldeschi.\nOn 15 October 1657 apartments were assigned to her at the Palace of Fontainebleau, where she committed an action that stained her memory: the execution of marchese Gian Rinaldo Monaldeschi, her master of the horse and formerly leader of the French party in Rome. For two months she had suspected Monaldeschi of disloyalty; she secretly seized his correspondence, which revealed that he had betrayed her interests. Christina gave three packages of letters to Le Bel, a priest, to keep them for her in custody. Three days later, at one o'clock on Saturday afternoon, she summoned Monaldeschi into the \"Galerie des Cerfs\", discussing the matter and letters with him. He insisted that betrayal should be punished with death. She was convinced that he had pronounced his own death sentence. After an hour or so Le Bel was to receive his confession. Both Le Bel and Monaldeschi entreated for mercy, but he was stabbed by her domestics \u2013 notably Ludovico Santinelli \u2013 in his stomach and in his neck. Wearing his coat of mail, which protected him, he was chased around in an adjacent room before they finally succeeded in dealing him a fatal wound in his throat. \"In the end, he died, confessing his infamy and admitting [Santinelli's] innocence, protesting that he had invented the whole fantastic story in order to ruin [him].\"\nFather Le Bel was told to have him buried inside the church, and Christina, seemingly unfazed, paid an abbey to say a number of Masses for his soul. She \"was sorry that she had been forced to undertake this execution, but claimed that justice had been carried out for his crime and betrayal.\nMazarin, who had sent her old friend Chanut, advised Christina to place the blame due to a brawl among courtiers, but she insisted that she alone was responsible for the act. She wrote to Louis XIV who two weeks later paid her a friendly visit without mentioning it. In Rome, people felt differently; Monaldeschi had been an Italian nobleman, murdered by a foreign barbarian with Santinelli as one of her executioners. The letters proving his guilt are gone; Christina left them with Le Bel and only he confirmed that they existed. Christina never revealed what was in the letters, but according to Le Bel, it is supposed to have dealt with her \"amours\", either with Monaldeschi or another person. She herself wrote her version of the story for circulation in Europe.\nThe killing of Monaldeschi in a French palace was legal, since Christina had judicial rights over the members of her court, as her vindicator Gottfried Leibniz claimed. As her contemporaries saw it, Christina as queen had to emphasize right and wrong, and her sense of duty was strong. She continued to regard herself as queen regnant all her life.\nShe would gladly have visited England, but she received no encouragement from Cromwell and stayed in Fontainebleau as nobody else offered her a place. Anne of Austria, the mother of Louis XIV, was impatient to be rid of her cruel guest; Christina had no choice but to depart. She returned to Rome and dismissed Santinelli in 1659, claiming to be her ambassador in Vienna without her approval.\nBack to Rome.\nOn 15 May 1658, Christina arrived in Rome for the second time, but this time it was definitely no triumph. With the execution of Monaldeschi, her popularity was lost. Pope Alexander VII remained in his summer residence and wanted no further visits from her. He described her as 'a woman born of a barbarian, barbarously brought up and living with barbarous thoughts ... with a ferocious and almost intolerable pride'. She began examining her past life and started with her autobiography. Christina stayed at the Palazzo Rospigliosi, which belonged to Mazarin, the French cardinal, situated close to the Quirinal Palace; so the pope was enormously relieved when in July 1659, she moved to Trastevere to live in Palazzo Riario, below the Janiculum, designed by Bramante. It was Cardinal Azzolino, her \"bookkeeper\" who signed the contract, as well as provided her with new servants to replace Francesco Santinelli, who had been Monaldeschi's executioner.\nThe Riario Palace became her home for the rest of her life. She decorated the walls with tapestries by Giovanni Francesco Grimaldi and paintings, mainly from the Venetian School and Renaissance; and almost no paintings from northern European painters, except Holbein, Van Dyck and Rubens. Her collections included very little religious subject matter and an abundance of mythological imagery, and it seems that Christina was also much interested in classical history, prompting misbegotten academic speculation about the genuineness of her conversion. No Roman collection of art could match hers. She owned Correggio's \"Dana\u00eb\" and two versions of Titian's \"Venus and Adonis\", tapestries, sculpture, medaillons, drawings by Raphael, Michelangelo, Caravaggio, Titian, Veronese and Goltzius and portraits of her friends Azzolino, Bernini, Ebba Sparre, Descartes, ambassador Chanut and doctor Bourdelot.\nRevisiting Sweden.\nIn April 1660 Christina was informed that Charles X Gustav had died in February. His son, Charles XI, was only five years old. That summer, she went to Sweden, pointing out that she had left the throne to her first cousin and his descendant, so if Charles XI died, she would take over the throne again. But as she was a Catholic that was impossible, and the clergy refused to let the priests in her entourage celebrate any Masses. Christina left Stockholm and went to Norrk\u00f6ping. Eventually she submitted to a second renunciation of the throne, spending a year in Hamburg to get her finances in order on her way back to Rome. Already in 1654, she had left her income to the banker in return for him sending her a monthly allowance and covering her debts in Antwerp. She visited the Teixeira family at Jungfernstieg and entertained them in her own lodgings.\nIn the summer of 1662, she arrived in Rome for the third time, followed by some fairly happy years. A variety of complaints and allegations made her resolve in 1666 once more to return to Sweden. She proceeded no farther than Norrk\u00f6ping, where she received a decree she was only allowed to settle in Swedish Pomerania. Christina immediately decided to go back to Hamburg. There she was informed that Alexander VII, her patron and tormentor, had died in May 1667. The new pope Clement IX, a victory for the Squadrone Volante, had been a regular guest at her palace. In her delight at his election, she threw a brilliant party at her lodgings in Hamburg, with illuminations and wine in the fountain outside. The party enraged Hamburg's Lutheran populace, and the party ended in a shooting, an attempt to seize the Queen, and her escape in disguise through a back door. Again she met with the freethinker and eye doctor Giuseppe Francesco Borri.\nOn 16 September 1668, John II Casimir abdicated the Polish\u2013Lithuanian throne and left to France. The Polish monarchy was elective and Christina, as a member of the House of Vasa, put herself forward as a candidate for the throne. She recommended herself being Catholic, an old maid and intended to remain one. She had Pope Clement IX's support; but her failure seemed to please her since this meant that she could return to her beloved Azzolino. She left the city on 20 October 1668.\nLater life.\nChristina's fourth and last entry in Rome took place on 22 November 1668. Clement IX often visited her; they had a shared interest in plays. Christina organized meetings of the Accademia in the Great Hall which had \u2018a platform for singers and players\u2019. When the pope suffered a stroke, she was among the few he wanted to see at his deathbed. In 1671, Christina established Rome's first public theatre in a former jail, Tor di Nona.\nThe new pope, Clement X, worried about the influence of theatre on public morals. When Innocent XI became pope, things turned even worse; within a few years he turned Christina's theatre into a storeroom for grain, although he had been a frequent guest in her royal box with the other cardinals. He forbade women to perform with song or acting, and the wearing of decollet\u00e9 dresses. Christina considered this sheer nonsense, and let women perform in her palace. In 1675, she invited Ant\u00f3nio Vieira to become her confessor. Itinerant doctor Nicolaas Heinsius the Younger, the legitimized son of a former literatus at Christina's court in Stockholm, arrived in Rome in 1679, converted and was appointed the Queen's personal physician until about 1687, providing autobiographical material for his picaresque novel,\"The Delightful Adventures and Wonderful Life of Mirandor\" (1695). Christina wrote an unfinished autobiography, of which there are several drafts extant, essays on her heroes Alexander the Great, Cyrus the Great and Julius C\u00e6sar, on art and music (\u201cPens\u00e9es, L\u2019Ouvrage du Loisir\u201d and \u201cLes Sentiments H\u00e9ro\u00efques\u201d) and acted as patron to musicians and poets as Vincenzo da Filicaja. Carlo Ambrogio Lonati and Giacomo Carissimi were Kapellmeister; Lelio Colista luteplayer; Loreto Vittori and Marco Marazzoli singers and Sebastiano Baldini librettist. She had Alessandro Stradella and Bernardo Pasquini to compose for her; Arcangelo Corelli dedicated his first work, \"Sonata da chiesa opus 1\", to her. On 2 February 1687 Corelli or Alessandro Scarlatti directed a tremendous orchestra performing a Pasquini cantata in praise for James II, England's first Catholic monarch since Mary I to welcome Roger Palmer, 1st Earl of Castlemaine as the new ambassador to the Vatican, accompanied by the painter John Michael Wright, who knew Rome and spoke Italian.\nIn 1656, Christina appointed Carissimi as her \"maestro di cappella del concerto di camera\". Lars Berglund has hypothesized that Christina's early involvement with Italian music when still in Sweden, and in particular church music from Rome, \"was likely closely linked to Christina\u2019s self-fashioning strategies and related to the precarious negotiations she was about to embark on as a result of her extraordinary decisions to abdicate, leave the country, convert to Catholicism, and settle in Papal Rome.\"\nChristina's politics and rebellious spirit persisted long after her abdication of power. When Louis XIV revoked the Edict of Nantes, abolishing the rights of French Protestants (Huguenots), Christina wrote an indignant letter, dated 2 February 1686, directed at the French ambassador Cesar d'Estrees. Louis did not appreciate her views, but Christina was not to be silenced. In Rome, she made Pope Clement X prohibit the custom of chasing Jews through the streets during the carnival. On 15 August 1686, she issued a declaration that Roman Jews were under her protection, signed \"la Regina\" \u2013 the queen.\nChristina remained very tolerant towards the beliefs of others all her life. She on her part felt more attracted to the views of the Spanish priest Miguel Molinos, whom she employed as a private theologian. He had been investigated by the Holy Inquisition for proclaiming that sin belonged to the lower sensual part of man and was not subject to man's free will. Christina sent him food and hundreds of letters when he was locked up in Castel Sant'Angelo.\nDeath and burial.\nIn February 1689, the 62-year-old Christina fell seriously ill after a visit to the temples in Campania, and received the last rites. She suffered from diabetes mellitus. Christina seemed to recover, but in the middle of April she developed an acute streptococcus bacterial infection known as erysipelas, then contracted pneumonia and a high fever. On her deathbed, she sent the pope a message asking if he could forgive her insults. She died on 19 April 1689 in Palazzo Corsini at six in the morning.\nChristina had asked for a simple burial in the Pantheon, Rome, but the pope insisted on her being displayed on a \"lit de parade\" for four days in the Riario Palace. She was embalmed, covered with white brocade, a silver mask, a gilt crown, and a scepter. \"The Queen wore a thin mantle, decorated with hundreds of crowns and fur bordered with ermine, under this a splendid garment in two pieces, thin gloves and drawers of knitted silk and a pair of elegant textile bootees\". In similar fashion to the popes, her body was placed in three coffins \u2013 one of cypress, one of lead and finally one made of oak. The funeral procession on 2 May led from Santa Maria in Vallicella to St. Peter's Basilica, where she was buried within the Vatican Grottoes \u2013 one of only three women ever given this honor (the other two being Matilda of Tuscany and Maria Clementina Sobieska). Her intestines were placed in a high urn.\nIn 1702, Clement XI commissioned a monument for the queen, in whose conversion he vainly foresaw a return of her country to the Faith and to whose contribution towards the culture of the city he looked back with gratitude. This monument was placed in the body of the basilica and directed by the artist Carlo Fontana.\nChristina had named Azzolino her sole heir to make sure her debts were settled, but he was too ill and worn out even to join her funeral, and died in June the same year. His nephew, Pompeo Azzolino, was his sole heir, and he rapidly sold off Christina's art collections.\nArt collector.\nUntil 1649, when Christina was twenty-three, the Swedish royal art collection was unimpressive, with good tapestries but for paintings, little more than \"about a hundred works by minor German, Flemish, and Swedish painters\". But in May 1649, the fabulous loot from the occupation of Prague Castle the previous year arrived, with the pick of the collection amassed by the obsessive collector Rudolph II, Holy Roman Emperor (1552\u20131612), one of the most important in Europe. Rudolf's bulk purchases had included the famous collection of Emperor Charles V's leading minister Cardinal Granvelle (1517\u20131586), which he had forced Granvelle's nephew and heir to sell to him. Granvelle had been the \"greatest private collector of his time, the friend and patron of Titian and Leoni and many other artists\".\nChristina was entranced by her new possessions, and remained a keen collector for the rest of her life, and as a female art collector is only exceeded by Catherine the Great of Russia in the Early Modern period. Rudolf had collected old and contemporary works from both Italy and northern Europe, but it was the Italian paintings that excited Christina, and by her death, her collection contained relatively few northern works other than portraits.\nMost of the Prague booty remained in Sweden after Christina's departure for exile: she only took about 70 to 80 paintings with her, including about 25 portraits of her friends and family, and some 50 paintings, mostly Italian, from the Prague loot, as well as statues, jewels, 72 tapestries, and various other works of art. She was concerned that the royal collections would be claimed by her successor, and prudently sent them ahead to Antwerp in a ship in August 1653, almost a year before she abdicated, an early sign of her intentions.\nChristina greatly expanded her collection during her exile in Rome, for example adding the five small Raphael predella panels from the Colonna Altarpiece, including the \"Agony in the Garden\" now reunited with the main panel in New York, which were bought from a convent near Rome. She was apparently given Titian's \"Death of Actaeon\" by the greatest collector of the age, Archduke Leopold William of Austria, Viceroy in Brussels \u2013 she received many such gifts from Catholic royalty after her conversion, and gave some generous gifts herself, notably Albrecht D\u00fcrer's panels of \"Adam\" and \"Eve\" to Philip IV of Spain (now Prado), likewise seven marble statues of the Muses she acquired from Hadrian's villa in 1670. She also gave away two paintings by Pieter Bruegel the Elder, \"Dull Gret\" and \"The Cripples\" (now Louvre). In such ways, the balance of her collection shifted to Italian art.\nThe Riario Palace finally provided a suitable setting for her collection, and the \"Sala dei Quadri\" (\"Paintings Room\") had her finest works, with thirteen Titians and eleven Veroneses, five Raphaels and several Correggios. Titian's \"Venus Anadyomene\" was among them. \"Venus mourns Adonis\" by Veronese was from Prague, and is now back in Sweden (Nationalmuseum).\nChristina liked to commission portraits of herself, friends, and also notable people she had not met, from 1647 sending David Beck, her Dutch court painter, to several countries to paint notabilities. She encouraged artists to study her collection, including the drawings, and exhibited some of her paintings, but apart from portraits she commissioned or bought few works by living painters, except for drawings. Sculptors did rather better, and Bernini was a friend, while others were commissioned to restore the large collection of classical sculpture which she had begun to assemble while still in Sweden.\nOn her death she left her collection to Cardinal Decio Azzolino, who himself died within a year, leaving the collection to his nephew, who sold it to Don Livio Odescalchi, commander of the Papal army, at which point it contained 275 paintings, 140 of them Italian. The year after Odescalchi's death in 1713, his heirs began protracted negotiations with the great French connoisseur and collector Pierre Crozat, acting as intermediary for Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, from 1715 the Regent of France. The sale was finally concluded and the 123 paintings included in the sale were delivered in 1721, forming the core of the Orleans Collection, the paintings from which were mostly sold in London after the French Revolution, with many of them being on display in the National Gallery. The French experts complained that Christina had cut down several paintings to fit her ceilings, and had over-restored some of the best works, especially the Correggios, implicating Carlo Maratti.\nAt first, removing her collections from Sweden was seen as a great loss to the country; but in 1697, Stockholm castle burned down with the loss of almost everything inside, so they would have been destroyed if they had remained there. Today very few major works from her collection still remain in the country. The sculpture collection was sold to the King of Spain and mostly remains in Spanish museums and palaces. Her large and important library was bought by Alexander VIII for the Vatican Library, while most of the paintings ended up in France, as the core of the Orleans Collection \u2013 many remain together in the National Gallery of Scotland. 1700 drawings from her collection (among them works by Michelangelo (25) and Raphael) were acquired in 1790 by Willem Anne Lestevenon for the Teylers Museum in Haarlem, the Netherlands.\nAppearance.\nHistorical accounts of Christina include regular reference to her physical features, mannerisms and style of dress. Christina was known to have a bent back, a deformed chest, and irregular shoulders. Some historians have speculated that references to her physical attributes may be over-represented in related historiography, thus giving the impression that this was of greater interest to her contemporaries than was actually the case. However, given how influential Christina became in her own era (especially for those in Rome), it is likely her style and mannerisms were at least of general interest to those around her, and this is reflected in many accounts. As a result of conflicting and unreliable accounts (some no better than gossip), the way in which Christina is described, even today, is a matter of debate.\nAccording to Christina's autobiography, the midwives at her birth first believed her to be a boy because she was \"completely hairy and had a coarse and strong voice\". Such ambiguity did not end with her birth; Christina made cryptic statements about her \"constitution\" and body throughout her life. Christina also believed a wet nurse had carelessly dropped her to the floor when she was a baby. A shoulder bone broke, leaving one shoulder higher than the other for the rest of her life. A number of her contemporaries made reference to the differing height of her shoulders.\nAs a child, Christina's mannerisms could probably best be described as those of a tomboy. Her father insisted she should receive \"the education of a prince\", and some have interpreted this as acceptance, on the part of the king, that she had masculine features or that there was some form of gender ambiguity in her upbringing. She was educated as a prince and was taught (and enjoyed) fencing, horse riding and bear hunting. She was said to have preferred these masculine hobbies to more feminine ones.\nAs an adult, it was said that Christina \"walked like a man, sat and rode like a man, and could eat and swear like the roughest soldiers\". Christina's contemporary John Bargrave described her comportment in a similar fashion but said witnesses ascribed her style more to childishness or madness than masculinity. When she arrived in Rome in 1655, she had shaven her head and wore a big, dark wig. By 1665, according to Edward Browne, she regularly wore a velvet justacorps, cravat, and peruke (man's wig).\nWhile Christina may not have been alone in her own time for choosing masculine dress (Leonora Christina Ulfeldt, for example, was known for dressing the same way), she also had physical features some described as masculine. According to Henry II, Duke of Guise, \"she wears men's shoes and her voice and nearly all her actions are masculine\". When she arrived in Lyon, she again wore a toque and had styled her hair like that of a young man. It was noted that she also wore large amounts of powder and face cream. In one account she \"was sunburnt, and she looked like a sort of Egyptian street girl, very strange, and more alarming than attractive\".\nLiving in Rome, she formed a close relationship with Cardinal Azzolino, which was controversial but symbolic of her attraction to relationships that were not typical for a woman of her era and station. She abandoned her manly clothes and took to wearing \"d\u00e9collet\u00e9\" dresses so risqu\u00e9 that they drew a rebuke from the Pope. \nAs an older woman, Christina's style changed a little. Fran\u00e7ois Maximilian Misson (visiting Rome in the spring of April 1688) wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;She is over sixty years of age, very small of stature, exceedingly fat, and corpulent. Her complexion and voice and face are those of a man. She has a big nose, large blue eyes, blonde eyebrows, and a double chin from which sprout several tufts of beard. Her upper lip protrudes a little. Her hair is a light chestnut colour, and only a palms breadth in length; she wears it powdered and standing on end, uncombed. She is very smiling and obliging. You will hardly believe her clothes: a man's jacket, in black satin, reaching to her knees, and buttoned all the way down; a very short black skirt, and men's shoes; a very large bow of black ribbons instead of a cravat; and a belt drawn tightly under her stomach, revealing its rotundity all too well.\nGender ambiguity and sexuality.\nThe question of Christina's sexuality has been debated, even as a number of modern biographers generally consider her to have been a lesbian, and her relationships with women were noted during her lifetime; Christina seems to have written passionate letters to Ebba Sparre, and Guilliet suggested a relationship between Christina and Gabrielle de Rochechouart de Mortemart, Rachel, a niece of Diego Teixeira, and the singer Angelina Giorgino. When she was introduced to Marquise Elisabeth de Castellane, she is quoted as saying, if she was a man, she would \"fall at your feet, submissive and languishing with love.\" Some historians assert she maintained heterosexual, non-sexual, lesbian, or bisexual relationships during the course of her life depending on which source is consulted. According to Veronica Buckley, Christina was a \"dabbler\" who was \"painted a lesbian, a prostitute, a hermaphrodite, and an atheist\" by her contemporaries, though \"in that tumultuous age, it is hard to determine which was the most damning label\". Christina wrote near the end of her life that she was \"neither Male nor Hermaphrodite, as some People in the World have pass'd me for\".\nBargrave recounted that Christina's relationship with Azzolino was both \"familiar\" (intimate) and \"amorous\" and that Azzolino had been sent (by the Pope) to Romania as punishment for maintaining it. Buckley, on the other hand, believed there was \"in Christina a curious squeamishness with regard to sex\" and that \"a sexual relationship between herself and Azzolino, or any other man, seems unlikely\". Based on historical accounts of Christina's physicality, some scholars believe that she may have been an intersex individual.\nIn 1965, these conflicting accounts led to an investigation of Christina's remains. Physical anthropologist and anatomist Carl-Herman Hjortsj\u00f6, who undertook the investigation, explained: \"Our imperfect knowledge concerning the effect of intersex on the skeletal formation ... makes it impossible to decide which positive skeletal findings should be demanded upon which to base the diagnosis [of an intersex condition].\" Nevertheless, Hjortsj\u00f6 speculated that Christina had reasonably typical female genitalia because it is recorded by her physicians Bourdelot and Macchiati that she menstruated. Hjortsj\u00f6's osteological analysis of Christina's skeleton led him to state that they were of a \"typically female\" structure.\nSome of the symptoms could be due to polycystic ovary syndrome, a complex multi-endocrine disorder including hirsutism (male pattern/type hair growth) due to increased androgen hormone levels, and abdominal obesity due to the hormone insulin receptor defects. Buckley suggested that her low comprehension of the need for most social norms, little desire to act, dress, or do other social norms, and her preference to wear, act, and do only that which she deemed logically practical, point to her having a pervasive developmental disorder, such as autism.\nLegacy.\nDepictions.\nThe complex character of Christina has inspired numerous plays, books, and operatic works, including:\nGeography and Toponymy.\nIn 1636\u20131637, Peter Minuit and Samuel Blommaert negotiated with the government to found New Sweden, the first Swedish colony in the New World where, in 1638, Minuit erected Fort Christina in what is now Wilmington, Delaware. The Christina River in Delaware was also named after her.\nIn the state of Pennsylvania, the Queen Village neighborhood in Center City, Philadelphia is named for her.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was released in Japan on March 21, 2001, and in Europe and Australia on June 22 as a launch title. It was not released in North America until February 2016 via the Wii U's Virtual Console service. \"Kuru Kuru Kururin\" is the first title in the \"Kururin\" series and was followed by two Japan-only sequels, \"Kururin Paradise\" and \"Kururin Squash!\". The game was released on the Nintendo Classics service in February 2023.\nGameplay.\nThe player controls a slowly spinning stick, and must maneuver it through a series of mazes without touching the walls. Infamously difficult, the single player offers several goals per course, while the 4 player (single cart) multiplayer pits players in a race for fastest clear times.\nThe game starts with simple training levels, in which players are told how to play and how to get around the first corners. After that, there are three levels in each stage, which get progressively harder and longer. The obstacles and the look of the levels (ice, cave, machine, etc.) vary between stages. Taking damage incurs a time penalty, and losing all lives results in failing the level, requiring the player to restart the level from the beginning. Beginners can play the levels on Easy mode, where the stick is only half of its usual size.\nThere is a mode called Challenge mode, which is a collection of smaller levels, usually involving only one or two corners or objects to dodge.\nPlot.\nThe story begins when Kururin's brothers and sisters go missing, and it is up to him to find them. Kururin is initially unsure that he is up to the task because he has never left his home world before. Being the adventurous and helpful fellow he is, Kururin agrees to rescue his lost family. Teacher Hare trains Kururin in the art of controlling the Helirin, a stick-shaped helicopter that has a slow-spinning propeller. Piloting the Helirin through the different worlds will be a difficult task, but using Teacher Hare's valuable lessons, Kururin bravely sets out on his adventure to rescue his lost family.\nDevelopment.\n\"Kuru Kuru Kururin\" was developed by the Japanese company Eighting and first announced at the Nintendo Space World 2000.\nReception.\n\"Kuru Kuru Kururin\" received mostly positive reviews from critics. It was praised for its simple yet addictive gameplay. Eurogamer rated the game a score of 9 out of 10 points. The reviewer lauded the game's learning curve and stated that there would be no other puzzle game on the Game Boy Advance at the time that can \"rival \"Kuru Kuru Kururin\" for its sheer addictiveness and fun-value\". Nintendo World Report, then known as Planet GameCube, gave \"Kuru Kuru Kururin\" the same score as Eurogamer and declared that it is \"simple enough that anyone can pick this game up and play\". The reviewer praised the game's multiplayer mode, which he described as \"an absolute blast\", as well as its lasting appeal, but also commented that the \"cutesy\" characters and music would be a turn-off for \"a lot of people\". Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot rated \"Kuru Kuru Kururin\" 7.1 out of 10 and described its graphics as \"simple but effective\". He stated that the game is \"excellent at filling up small periods of free time with its short, level-based nature\". \"Computer and Video Games\" was less impressed by the game, rating it 5 out of 10. The reviewer declared the game to be \"extremely frustrating\" and said that it lacks \"the perfect simplicity\" of other puzzle games such as \"Mr. Driller\" and \"Tetris\". Nonetheless, he also commented that the novel gameplay of \"Kuru Kuru Kururin\" \"will find many fans\" and that the multiplayer mode is \"unexpectedly brilliant\".\nLegacy.\nThe first sequel, \"Kururin Paradise\", was released in 2002 for the Game Boy Advance. It was released in Japan only, even though \"Kururin Paradise\" was previously showcased at E3 2002, the first time a \"Kururin\" game had been announced for the American market. Another sequel was also released only in Japan for the GameCube in 2004, entitled \"Kururin Squash!\", which became the only title of the series to use 3D computer graphics, as well as to appear on a home console.\nSeveral references to the \"Kururin\" series are made in the \"Super Smash Bros.\" series. The Helirin makes a cameo appearance as a trophy in \"Melee\", but is incorrectly referred to as \"Heririn\" in the American version. The Helirin later appears in \"Brawl\" as an Assist Trophy. Unlike most Assist Trophies, it doesn't attack, but it becomes part of the stage, and can be used as a platform or a wall. Several other things in the \"Kururin\" series appear as Trophies and Stickers in the game.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She is best known for \"The Dark Is Rising\", a contemporary fantasy series set in England and Wales, which incorporates British mythology such as the Arthurian legends and Welsh folk heroes. For that work, in 2012 she won the lifetime Margaret A. Edwards Award from the American Library Association, recognizing her contribution to writing for teens. In the 1970s two of the five novels were named the year's best English-language book with an \"authentic Welsh background\" by the Welsh Books Council. In 2024, the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers Association named her the 40th Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master in recognition of her significant contributions to the literature of science fiction and fantasy.\nEarly life and education.\nCooper was born in 1935 in Burnham, Buckinghamshire, to Ethel May (\"n\u00e9e\" Field) and her husband John Richard Cooper. Her father had worked in the reading room of the Natural History Museum until going off to fight in the Second World War, from which he returned with a wounded leg. He then pursued a career in the offices of the Great Western Railway. Her mother was a teacher of ten-year-olds and eventually became deputy head of a large school. Susan's younger brother Roderick also grew up to become a writer.\nCooper lived in Buckinghamshire until she was 21, when her parents moved to her grandmother's village of Aberdyfi in Wales. She attended Slough High School and then earned a degree in English at Somerville College at the University of Oxford, where she was the first woman to edit the undergraduate newspaper \"Cherwell\".\nCareer and personal life.\nAfter graduating, she worked as a reporter for \"The Sunday Times\" (London) under Ian Fleming and wrote in her spare time. During that period she began work on the series \"The Dark Is Rising\" and finished her debut novel, the science fiction \"Mandrake\", published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton in 1964.\nCooper emigrated to the United States in 1963 to marry Nicholas J. Grant, a professor of metallurgy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and a widower with three teenage children. They had two children. Cooper then became a full-time writer, focusing on \"The Dark Is Rising\" and on \"Dawn of Fear\" (1970), a novel based on her experiences of the Second World War. Eventually she wrote fiction for both children and adults, a series of picture books, film screenplays, and works for the stage.\nAround the time of writing \"Seaward\" (1983), both of her parents died, and her marriage to Grant was dissolved.\nIn July 1996, she married the Canadian-American actor and her sometime co-author Hume Cronyn, the widower of Jessica Tandy. (Cronyn and Tandy had starred in the Broadway production of \"Foxfire\", written by Cooper and Cronyn and staged in 1982.)\nAfter Cronyn's death in 2003, she moved back to Massachusetts, building a house facing the North River in Marshfield, and also living in Cambridge. The history of the Marshfield area was the basis for her 2013 book \"Ghost Hawk\", in which the spirit of a Wampanoag, whose people were decimated by European disease, witnesses the transformation of Massachusetts by the Plymouth Colony. She is a member of First Parish Unitarian Universalist Church of Scituate.\nHollywood adapted \"The Dark Is Rising\" (1973) as a film in 2007, \"The Seeker\".\nBefore she saw the film, Cooper stated that she had requested some changes to it, but had received no response.\nFrom 2006 to 2012, Cooper was on the Board of the National Children's Book and Literacy Alliance (NCBLA), a US nonprofit organization that advocates for literacy, literature, and libraries.\nIn April 2017, Cooper gave the fifth annual Tolkien Lecture at Pembroke College, Oxford, speaking on the role of fantasy literature in contemporary society.\nIn 2019 she published \"The Shortest Day\", based on her performance poem of the same title written for the Cambridge Christmas \"Revels\" in the 1970s.\nAwards.\nFor her lifetime contribution as a children's writer, Cooper was U.S. nominee in 2002 for the biennial, international Hans Christian Andersen Award, the highest international recognition available to creators of children's books.\nThe American Library Association's Margaret A. Edwards Award recognises one writer and a particular body of work for \"significant and lasting contribution to young adult literature\". Cooper won the award in 2012 citing the five Dark Is Rising novels, published 1965 to 1977. The citation observed, \"In one of the most influential epic high fantasies in literature, Cooper evokes Celtic and Arthurian mythology and masterly world-building in a high-stakes battle between good and evil, embodied in the coming of age journey of Will Stanton.\"\nIn 2013 Cooper was recognized with a World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement. She was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 2020. In 2024, the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers Association named her the 40th Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master in recognition of her significant contributions to the literature of science fiction and fantasy.\nShe has also been recognised for single books:\nWorks.\nDrama.\nCooper wrote four screenplays produced for television, one supernatural tale for children and three more adaptations of books about Appalachia (as \"Foxfire\").\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n "}

Schmitz's \"Agent of Vega\". She then read Andre Norton's \"Beast Master\" and \"Lord of Thunder\" and continued to read all of Norton's works. Lackey had difficulties obtaining enough interesting books from the public library to sate her passion for reading. She wrote for herself but without real direction or purpose until she attended Purdue University. Lackey graduated from Purdue in 1972.\nWhile at Purdue, she took a one-on-one class of English Literature Independent Studies with a professor who was a fellow science fiction fan. He helped her analyze books she enjoyed and then use that knowledge. Lackey then encountered fan fiction, which further encouraged her writing. She began publishing work in science fiction fanzines and then discovered filk and had some filk lyrics published by Off Centaur Publications.\nProfessional sales.\nLackey submitted a story to \"Sword and Sorceress\", then sold the rewritten story to \"Fantasy Book Magazine\". Her first sale was to \"Friends of Darkover\".\nShe met C. J. Cherryh through filk. Cherryh helped Lackey through 17 rewrites of 'Arrows'. During this time, Marion Zimmer Bradley included Lackey's short stories in an anthology, \"Friends of Darkover\". Lackey claims to have been writing so much during this time that she had no social life at all. She divorced Tony Lackey, and eventually married Larry Dixon.\nStance on fanfiction.\nDespite getting her own start as a fanfiction author, she and her agent forbade fan fiction based on her own books for many years, whether distributed offline or online. Lackey stated on her website that this was due to the 1992 Marion Zimmer Bradley fan fiction affair, when a fan accused Bradley of copying the fan's work and demanded writing credit and remuneration. After several years, Lackey's policy permitted offline fanfic, but only if the author got a release form from Mercedes Lackey that said the author acknowledged that they were using characters that belong to Mercedes Lackey and that the author's work essentially became Mercedes Lackey's property to prevent \"infringing on my right to make a living from my own imagination\". As of 2009 this policy changed, permitting fan fiction to be licensed as derivative fiction under the Creative Commons umbrella.\nPersonal life.\nShe married Anthony Lackey in 1972, and they divorced in 1990. In 1990, she met Larry Dixon at Circle Ouroboros convention in Meridian, MS. They married in 1992. The couple live outside of Tulsa, Oklahoma.\nOther interests.\nLackey and Dixon have in the past worked in raptor rehabilitation. She refers to her various parrots as her \"feathered children\". The afterwords to some of her books refer to rehabilitation and falconry, and this interest has influenced and informed her writing. She also enjoys beadwork, costuming, and needlework. She claims, however, to be a \"wretched housekeeper, and by and large an indifferent cook\" Besides this, she does radar-reading during tornado season. She helps support the Alex Foundation.\nHistorically, Lackey was active in the filking community. She was a major contributor to an early album of space filk, \"Minus Ten and Counting\". She has won five Pegasus Awards, mostly for her songwriting. She was also active in the Society for Creative Anachronism and belongs to the Great Dark Horde.\nShe participates in The Stellar Guild series published by Phoenix Pick. The series pairs bestselling authors like Lackey with lesser known authors in science fiction and fantasy to help provide additional visibility to them.\nRelated writers.\nMercedes Lackey was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9e of Marion Zimmer Bradley and got her start writing short stories in Bradley's story collections. Other mentors include writers C. J. Cherryh and Andre Norton, along with her editor, Elizabeth (Betsy) Wollheim of DAW Books.\nHer earlier Velgarth novels are all solo projects, but later volumes in the Valdemar saga are illustrated by her husband, Larry Dixon, and in many of her latest works he is also credited as co-author. Many of her other novels are collaborations. She has worked with fantasy authors Andre Norton (such as the Halfblood Chronicles), Marion Zimmer Bradley (such as \"Rediscovery\" and \"Tigers Burning Bright\"), Anne McCaffrey (such as \"The Ship Who Searched\"), and Piers Anthony (\"If I Pay Thee Not in Gold\"). She has most recently written \"The Obsidian Trilogy\" with historian James Mallory, a historical fantasy series about an \"alternative\" Elizabeth I with romance writer Roberta Gellis, and the \"Heirs of Alexandria series\" with Dave Freer and Eric Flint.\nAdaptations.\nTelevision and film.\nOn August 3, 2021, Deadline reported that Radar Pictures had acquired the television rights to the Valdemar novels and that Ted Field would be Executive Producer on the series. The first season is being developed as an adaptation of the Last Herald-Mage trilogy. Kit Williamson and Brittany Cavallaro have been announced as writers and producers for the show.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "49625", "revid": "34986788", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49625", "title": "The New York Sun", "text": "American online newspaper\nThe New York Sun is an American conservative news website and former newspaper based in Manhattan, New York. From 2009 to 2021, it operated as an online-only publisher of political and economic opinion pieces, as well as occasional arts content. Coming under new management in November 2021, it began full-time online publication in 2022.\nFrom 2002 to 2008, \"The Sun\" was a printed daily newspaper distributed in New York City. It debuted on April 16, 2002, claiming descent from, and adopting the name, motto, and nameplate of, the earlier New York paper \"The Sun\" (1833\u20131950). It became the first general-interest broadsheet newspaper to be started in New York City in several decades.\nOn November 2, 2021, \"The New York Sun\" was acquired by Dovid Efune, former CEO and editor-in-chief of the \"Algemeiner Journal\". Efune confirmed Seth Lipsky in the position of editor-in-chief. Following Efune's acquisition, \"The New York Sun\" resumed full-time online reporting in 2022, focusing on a digital-first strategy.\nHistory.\n2001\u20132008.\nThe Sun was named with a desire for conscious association with the previous newspaper \"The Sun\" which was published from 1833 to 1950. The relaunched \"Sun\" was founded by a group of investors including publishing magnate Conrad Black. The goal was to provide an alternative to \"The New York Times\", featuring front-page news about local and state events, in contrast to the emphasis on national and international news by the \"Times\". The Sun began business operations, prior to first publication, in October 2001.\nThe newspaper's president and editor-in-chief was Seth Lipsky, former editor of \"The Jewish Daily Forward\". Managing editor Ira Stoll also served as company vice-president. Stoll had been a longtime critic of \"The New York Times\" in his media watchdog blog smartertimes.com.\nPublished from the Cary Building in Lower Manhattan, it ceased print publication on September 30, 2008. When asked why, Lipsky said, \"we needed additional funds. . . . [T]he 2008 financial collapse was sweeping the world, and the Internet was emerging as a challenge to traditional newspapering.\"\nThe paper's motto, which it shared with its predecessor and namesake, was \"It Shines For All\".\n2009\u20132021.\nIts website resumed activity on April 28, 2009.\nDespite the closure of the newspaper, \"The New York Sun\" website renewed activity on April 28, 2009, prompting some observers to consider the possible implications. Michael Calderone of \"Politico\" quoted Lipsky as saying not to read too much into the initial items since \"...a business plan for the site is still in formation,\" and \"... these are just some very, very early bulbs of spring (or late winter).\" It only contained a small subset of the original content of the paper, mostly editorials at irregular intervals, op-ed commentaries and frequent contributions from economist and noted television commentator Lawrence Kudlow. In addition, commentaries on the arts have been published.\nOnline relaunch, 2021.\nOn November 2, 2021, \"The New York Sun\" was acquired by Dovid Efune, former CEO and editor-in-chief of the \"Algemeiner Journal\". Efune confirmed Seth Lipsky in the position of editor-in-chief. Following Efune's acquisition, \"The New York Sun\" resumed full-time online reporting in 2022, focusing on a digital-first strategy. In October 2025, the \"Sun\" relaunched its print edition, to be published weekly on Fridays. \nEditorial perspective and reception, 2001\u20132008.\nIn 2002, Editor-in-chief Lipsky said that the paper's prominent op-ed page would champion \"limited government, individual liberty, constitutional fundamentals, equality under the law, economic growth ... standards in literature and culture, education\". Another goal, said Lipsky in 2009, was \"to seize the local beat from which \"The New York Times\" was retreating as it sought to become a national newspaper\". In 2004, Stoll characterized \"The Sun\"'s political orientation as \"right-of-center\",\n nominating Dick Cheney for the presidency (2007), and lowering, rather than raising, the debt ceiling in response to the debt ceiling crisis (2013).\n\"The Sun\"'s columnists included prominent conservative and neoconservative pundits, including William F. Buckley, Jr., Michael Barone, Daniel Pipes, and Mark Steyn.\n\"The Sun\" supported President George W. Bush and his decision to launch the Iraq War in 2003. The paper also urged strong action against the perceived threat of the Islamic Republic of Iran and also was known for its forceful coverage of Jewish-related issues, and advocacy for Israel's right of self-defense, as evidenced in articles by pro-Israel reporter Aaron Klein.\nConservative Catholic commentator and anti-abortionist Richard John Neuhaus, writing in 2006 in \"First Things\", described the \"Sun\" as a paper that had \"made itself nearly indispensable for New Yorkers\".\nAccording to Scott Sherman, writing in \"The Nation\" in April 2007, \"The Sun\" was \"a broadsheet that injects conservative ideology into the country's most influential philanthropic, intellectual and media hub; a paper whose day-to-day coverage of New York City emphasizes lower taxes, school vouchers and free-market solutions to urban problems; a paper whose elegant culture pages hold their own against the Times in quality and sophistication; a paper that breaks news and crusades on a single issue; a paper that functions as a journalistic SWAT team against individuals and institutions seen as hostile to Israel and Jews; and a paper that unapologetically displays the scalps of its victims.\"\nIn the same article, Mark Malloch Brown, Kofi Annan's chief of staff at the United Nations, described \"The Sun\" as \"a pimple on the backside of American journalism.\" According to Sherman, Brown \"accepts that the paper's obsession with the UN translates into influence ... he admitted \"The Sun\" \"does punch way above its circulation number, on occasion\". He goes on to say, \"Clearly amongst its minuscule circulation were a significant number of diplomats. And so it did at times act as some kind of rebel house paper inside the UN. It fed the gossip mills and what was said in the cafeterias.\" Brown's insult was in the context of \"The Sun\"'s reporting of the UN's central role in the Saddam Hussein Oil-for-Food scandal.\nIn May 2007, \"Adweek\" columnist Tom Messner called \"The Sun\" \"the best paper in New York\", noting that \"\"The New York Sun\" is a conservative paper, but it gets the respect of the left. \"The Nation\"'s April 30 issue contains an article on the \"Sun\"'s rise by Scott Sherman that is as balanced an article as I have ever read in the magazine (not a gibe; you don't read \"The Nation\" for balance).\"\nAlex Jones of the Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics, and Public Policy said in 2008, \"It was a newspaper especially savored by people who don't like \"The New York Times\", and there are plenty of those in New York.\" The paper also scored more scoops than would be expected for its size and Stephen B. Shepard, dean of the CUNY Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York said in 2008 that its effective coverage of local news earned it a place in the New York media world. Accordingly, it was known as a good place for young, ambitious, scrappy reporters to start out.\nFeatures, 2001\u20132008.\n\"The Sun\" received critical praise for its sports section, writers for which included Steven Goldman, Thomas Hauser, Sean Lahman, Tim Marchman, and John Hollinger. Its crossword puzzle, edited by Peter Gordon, was called one of the two best in the United States. It also published the first regular wine column in a New York newspaper, \"Along the Wine Trail\", written by G. Selmer Fougner.\nIn its first edition, the paper carried the solution to the last crossword puzzle of the earlier \"Sun\" published in 1950.\nFinancial problems, circulation, and end of print run, 2001\u20132008.\n\"The Sun\" was started anew in 2002 in the face of a long-term decline of newspapers in the United States, loss of advertising revenue to the Internet and the rise of new media. From the beginning, it struggled for existence. \"The Sun\" was the first new daily newspaper launched in New York since 1976, when News World Communications, a company controlled by the Unification Church, launched \"The News World\" (that was later renamed the \"New York City Tribune\" and folded in 1991).\nAt the time of its creation, one media financial analyst said the \"Sun's\" chances of survival were \"pretty grim\", while another media commentator characterized it as \"the unlikeliest of propositions\".\nIt was underfunded from the start, with ten investors putting up a total of approximately $15 million\u2014not enough for long-term running. Beyond Conrad Black, who pulled out in 2003, these included hedge fund managers Michael Steinhardt and Bruce Kovner, private equity fund manager Thomas J. Tisch, and financier and think tank figure Roger Hertog.\n\"The Sun\"'s physical plant, in the Cary Building at Church Street and Chambers Street in Lower Manhattan, was antiquated, with malfunctioning telephones and computers, a trouble-prone elevator and fire alarm system, and dubious bathroom plumbing. Nevertheless, Lipsky had hopes of breaking even within the first year of operation.\nThe Audit Bureau of Circulations confirmed that in its first six months of publication \"The Sun\" had an average circulation of just under 18,000. By 2005 the paper reported an estimated circulation of 45,000. In December 2005, \"The Sun\" withdrew from the Audit Bureau of Circulations to join the https://, whose other New York clients are the free papers \"The Village Voice\" and \"AM New York Metro\", and began an aggressive campaign of free distribution in select neighborhoods.\nWhile \"The Sun\" claimed \"150,000 of New York City's Most Influential Readers Every Day\", \"The Sun\"'s own audit indicated that it was selling approximately 14,000 copies a day\u2014while giving away between 66,000 and 85,000 a day. (The New York \"Daily News\" sold about 700,000 copies a day during that period.) It offered free subscriptions for a full year to residents in advertiser-desired zip codes; this and other uses of controlled circulation made it more attractive to advertisers, but further diminished its chances of ever becoming profitable.\nSimilarly, \"The Sun\"'s online edition was accessible for free since August 2006. \"The Sun\" acquired the web address www.LatestPolitics.com in 2007.\nIn a letter to readers published on the front page of the September 4, 2008, edition, Lipsky announced that the paper had suffered substantial losses and would \"cease publication at the end of September unless we succeed in our efforts to find additional financial backing.\" In particular, the paper's existing backers would not put forward more money unless new backers with capital were found. The 2008 financial crisis halted funding opportunities, and \"The Sun\" ceased publication on September 30, 2008. It had approximately 110 employees at that time, and also made use of many freelance writers. Mayor of New York Michael Bloomberg commented that \"The Sun shone brightly, though too briefly,\" and that its writers were \"smart, thoughtful, provocative\".\nControversies.\nAllegations were published in the paper's January 9, 2008 issue, written by contributing editor Daniel Johnson about then-candidate Barack Obama and Kenya's candidate (and subsequent Prime Minister) Raila Odinga, based on what was later described as \"a patently fallacious story ... or at the very least to shirk their responsibility to the truth.\"\n\"The Sun\" was listed as a three-time victim of plagiarism when \"The News-Sentinel\" announced March 1, 2008, that \"20 of 38 guest columns ... contributed ... since 2000\" by Bush White House staffer Timothy Goeglein were subsequently discovered to have been plagiarized; three were attributed to original articles in \"The Sun\". Goeglein resigned.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Infocom's sixth game, it was released for Amstrad CPC, Apple II, Atari 8-bit computers, Commodore 64, Plus/4, IBM PC compatibles (as a self-booting disk), TRS-80, and TI-99/4A. It was later available for Mac, Amiga, and Atari ST.\nPlot.\nThe player's character has been embedded within a facility that controls vital systems, such as moving public transportation belts and weather control, for an Earth-settled planet called Contra. During the player's five-hundred-year tenure, the player would normally be kept in stasis while his sleeping mind serves as the Central Mentality for the largely self-maintaining systems. As the game opens, however, he is awakened by severe error messages; something is going wrong. The facility has suffered catastrophic damage from an earthquake, and the Filtering Computers are shutting down or becoming dangerously unstable. The inhabitants of the city assume that the Central Mentality has gone insane and is purposely harming the city, as a previous CM had done. The player's task is to repair the damage and restore the systems to normal states before a crew arrives at the facility to \"disconnect\" his mind, killing him, to be replaced with a clone.\nGameplay.\nRather than being free to move about and interact with the game world directly, the player's character spends the entire game in a state of suspended animation (hence the title) and can only interact by controlling the actions of a number of robot surrogates. Each robot has its own unique strengths and weaknesses, and describes the same rooms and objects in completely different terms based upon those specializations. The robots are:\nSo, for example, Auda will describe a room primarily in terms of the sounds being generated there, Poet will describe it in terms of diagnostics of the equipment there (and phrase it in amusingly metaphorical language), and Iris will provide a visual description. All six of the robots can be given orders in conjunction, and some of the challenges the player faces require that several of the robots work together to solve them.\nThere is a seventh robot, an all-purpose multifunction repair robot named Fred, who spends the entirety of the game broken and cannot be repaired.\n\"Suspended\" has six ways to die.\nRelease.\nThe cover of the original release was a three-dimensional moulded plastic mask, with cut-outs that revealed eyes printed on the game's manual. Reissues of the game had a more conventional cover. Each package included the following physical items:\nReception.\nThe game sold 99,956 copies.\n\"Suspended\" was well received by critics. \"Softline\" praised the feelies as \"continued breakthroughs in packaging and merchandising\", and noted the game's replayability. The magazine concluded that \"\"Suspended\" represents another milestone in the continuing evolution of the interactive computer novel.\" \"Computer Gaming World\" considered each robot to have a unique personality, and praised the use of the library computer as an in-game hint system. The game's parser and time-saving techniques (such as a \"follow\" command) were similarly praised. Brian Moriarty of \"ANALOG Computing\" also praised the robots' characterization, stating that \"a few hours with these electronic personalities will make them your friends\" and comparing the experience to that of \"a fine novel\". He concluded that \"Suspended\" and other Infocom products \"are among the finest examples of a new and entertaining means of self-expression which can now be regarded as 'literature' without apology.\" \"Ahoy!\" wrote that Berlyn \"has lavished a good deal of complexity and eccentricity into his game. I recommend it.\" \"Compute!'s Gazette\" called \"Suspended\" \"an exciting, imaginative adventure game that's likely to keep you glued to your keyboard for hours.\" Although it also noted how the \"response time can be somewhat slow\" and \"some commands require as long as two or more minutes for a response.\" But the \"Compute!\" review concluded: \"If the small inconvenience of a sometimes slow response does not bother you, then I can highly recommend Suspended.\" \"Hi-Res\" wrote that \"Suspended\" \"is an excellent game\" and \"a worthy successor to the \"Zork\" series.\"\nThe game received a Certificate of Merit in the category of \"1984 Best Science Fiction/Fantasy Computer Game\" at the 5th annual Arkie Awards.\nBill Wallace reviewed \"Suspended\" in \"Space Gamer\" No. 68. Wallace commented that \"If you do like text adventures - difficult ones - then this game is a must.\"\nIn 1996, \"Computer Gaming World\" declared \"Suspended\" the 58th-best computer game ever released.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "49627", "revid": "50908271", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49627", "title": "Universal Disk Format", "text": "Vendor-neutral file system, used in practice for DVDs and other optical discs\nUniversal Disk Format (UDF) is an open, vendor-neutral file system for computer data storage for a broad range of media. In practice, it has been most widely used for DVDs and newer optical disc formats, supplanting ISO 9660. Due to its design, it is very well suited to incremental updates on both write-once and re-writable optical media. UDF was developed and maintained by the Optical Storage Technology Association (OSTA).\nIn engineering terms, Universal Disk Format is a profile of the specifications known as ISO/IEC 13346 and ECMA-167.\nUsage.\nNormally, authoring software will master a UDF file system in a batch process and write it to optical media in a single pass. But when packet writing to rewritable media, such as CD-RW, UDF allows files to be created, deleted and changed on-disc just as a general-purpose filesystem would on removable media like floppy disks and flash drives. This is also possible on write-once media, such as CD-R, but in that case the space occupied by the deleted files cannot be reclaimed (and instead becomes inaccessible).\nMulti-session mastering is also possible in UDF, though some implementations may be unable to read disks with multiple sessions.\nHistory.\nThe Optical Storage Technology Association standardized the UDF file system to form a common file system for all optical media: both for read-only media and for re-writable optical media. When first standardized, the UDF file system aimed to replace ISO 9660, allowing support for both read-only and writable media. After the release of the first version of UDF, the DVD Consortium adopted it as the official file system for DVD-Video and DVD-Audio.\nUDF shares the basic volume descriptor format with ISO 9660. A \"UDF Bridge\" format is defined since 1.50 so that a disc can also contain a ISO 9660 file system making references to files on the UDF part.\nRevisions.\nMultiple revisions of UDF have been released:\nUDF Revisions are internally encoded as binary-coded decimals; Revision 2.60, for example, is represented as 0x0260. In addition to declaring its own revision, compatibility for each volume is defined by the minimum read and minimum write revisions, each signalling the requirements for these operations to be possible for every structure on this image. A \"maximum write\" revision additionally records the highest UDF support level of all the implementations that has written to this image. For example, a UDF 2.01 volume that does not use Stream Files (introduced in UDF 2.00) but uses VAT (UDF 1.50) created by a UDF 2.60-capable implementation may have the revision declared as 0x0201, the minimum read revision set to 0x0150, the minimum write to 0x0150, and the maximum write to 0x0260.\nUses.\nWhile UDF was primarily developed for optical discs, it is also able to operate on other media such as hard disk drives and flash storage.\nUDF was for well over a decade the only open-specification and cross-platform-supported file system without a file size limitation of 4 GiB (roughly 4.3 GB), until the open-sourcing of exFAT in 2019. \"Cross-platform\" here means supported by all three majorly used operating systems, Windows and Mac OS and Linux.\nOn Windows, formatting flash storage devices as UDF can not be accomplished through the graphical formatting widget, only through the command prompt.\nSpecifications.\nThe UDF standard defines three file system variations, called \"builds\". These are:\nPlain build.\nIntroduced in the first version of the standard, this format can be used on any type of disk that allows random read/write access, such as hard disks, DVD+RW and DVD-RAM media. Metadata (up to v2.50) and file data is addressed more or less directly. In writing to such a disk in this format, any physical block on the disk may be chosen for allocation of new or updated files.\nSince this is the \"basic\" format, practically any operating system or file system driver claiming support for UDF should be able to read this format.\nVAT build.\nWrite-once media such as DVD-R and CD-R have limitations when being written to, in that each physical block can only be written to once, and the writing must happen incrementally. Thus the \"plain\" build of UDF can only be written to CD-Rs by pre-mastering the data and then writing all data in one piece to the media, similar to the way an ISO 9660 file system gets written to CD media.\nTo enable a CD-R to be used virtually like a hard disk, whereby the user can add and modify files on a CD-R at will (so-called \"drive letter access\" on Windows), OSTA added the \"VAT\" build to the UDF standard in its revision 1.5. The VAT is an additional structure on the disc that allows packet writing; that is, remapping physical blocks when files or other data on the disc are modified or deleted. For write-once media, the entire disc is virtualized, making the write-once nature transparent for the user; the disc can be treated the same way one would treat a rewritable disc.\nThe write-once nature of CD-R or DVD-R media means that when a file is deleted on the disc, the file's data still remains on the disc. It does not appear in the directory any more, but it still occupies the original space where it was stored. Eventually, after using this scheme for some time, the disc will be full, as free space cannot be recovered by deleting files. Special tools can be used to access the previous state of the disc (the state before the delete occurred), making recovery possible.\nNot all drives fully implement version 1.5 or higher of the UDF, and some may therefore be unable to handle VAT builds.\nSpared (RW) build.\nRewriteable media such as DVD-RW and CD-RW have fewer limitations than DVD-R and CD-R media. Sectors can be rewritten at random (though in packets at a time). These media can be erased entirely at any time, making the disc blank again, ready for writing a new UDF or other file system (e.g., ISO 9660 or CD Audio) to it. However, sectors of \"-RW\" media may \"wear out\" after a while, meaning that their data becomes unreliable, through having been rewritten too often (typically after a few hundred rewrites, with CD-RW).\nThe plain and VAT builds of the UDF format can be used on rewriteable media, with some limitations. If the plain build is used on a -RW media, file-system level modification of the data must not be allowed, as this would quickly wear out often-used sectors on the disc (such as those for directory and block allocation data), which would then go unnoticed and lead to data loss. To allow modification of files on the disc, rewriteable discs can be used like -R media using the \"VAT\" build. This ensures that all blocks get written only once (successively), ensuring that there are no blocks that get rewritten more often than others. This way, a RW disc can be erased and reused many times before it should become unreliable. However, it will eventually become unreliable with no easy way of detecting it. When using the \"VAT\" build, CD-RW/DVD-RW media effectively appears as CD-R or DVD+/\u2212R media to the computer. However, the media may be erased again at any time.\nThe \"spared\" build was added in revision 1.5 to address the particularities of rewriteable media. This build adds an extra \"Sparing Table\" in order to manage the defects that will eventually occur on parts of the disc that have been rewritten too many times. This table keeps track of worn-out sectors and remaps them to working ones. UDF defect management does not apply to systems that already implement another form of defect management, such as Mount Rainier (MRW) for optical discs, or a disk controller for a hard drive.\nThe tools and drives that do not fully support revision 1.5 of UDF will ignore the sparing table, which would lead them to read the outdated worn-out sectors, leading to retrieval of corrupted data.\nAn overhead that is spread over the entire disc reserves a portion of the data storage space, limiting the usable capacity of a CD-RW with e.g. 650 MB of original capacity to around 500 MB.\nCharacter set.\nThe UDF specifications allow only one Character Set \"OSTA CS0\", which can store any Unicode Code point excluding U+FEFF and U+FFFE. Additional character sets defined in ECMA-167 are not used.7.2\nSince Errata DCN-5157, the range of code points was expanded to all code points from Unicode 4.0 (or any newer or older version), which includes Plane 1\u201316 characters such as Emoji. DCN-5157 also recommends normalizing the strings to Normalization Form C.\nThe OSTA CS0 character set stores a 16-bit Unicode string \"compressed\" into 8-bit or 16-bit units, preceded by a single-byte \"compID\" tag to indicate the compression type. The 8-bit storage is functionally equivalent to ISO-8859-1, and the 16-bit storage is UTF-16 in big endian. 8-bit-per-character file names save space because they only require half the space per character, so they should be used if the file name contains no special characters that can not be represented with 8 bits only.\nThe reference algorithm neither checks for forbidden code points nor interprets surrogate pairs, so like NTFS the string may be malformed.2.1.2, 6.4 (No specific form of storage is specified by DCN-5157, but UTF-16BE is the only well-known method for storing all of Unicode while being mostly backward compatible with UCS-2.)\nTools.\nVarious tools have been developed to work with UDF file systems. For Linux, the codice_1 package contains several tools that can be used directly as a command-line interface, but can also be called by other applications. \nThe codice_2 tool creates a new UDF file system on a partition or a disk image file. The tool is symbolically linked from codice_3 for consistency with other codice_4 tools.\ncodice_5 shows details of an UDF file system such as the volume label, version, counts of files and directories, and the status of the write protection flags. The volume label can be changed using the codice_6 tool. \nThe write protection flag can \"seal\" a file system once its authoring is finished and no more changes to it are intended. For toggling the write protection setting which makes a file system read-only when activated, a tool called codice_7 was under development, but has not yet been included in the codice_1 package as of April 2025, following that its maintainer Pali Roh\u00e1r has reportedly lost access to his GitHub account.\ncodice_9 allows the user to modify an UDF file system interactively. For example, files can be copied and removed, and directories can be created and removed.\ncodice_10 implements packet writing through device files named codice_11 and counting up. These device files are separate from the usual device files of optical drives named codice_12 (where \"sr\" means \"SCSI ROM\") and counting up.\nCompatibility.\nMany DVD players do not support any UDF revision other than version 1.02. Discs created with a newer revision may still work in these players if the ISO 9660 bridge format is used. Even if an operating system claims to be able to read UDF 1.50, it still may only support the \"plain\" build and not necessarily either the \"VAT\" or \"Spared\" UDF builds.\nMac OS X 10.4.5 claims to support Revision 1.50 (see \"man mount_udf\"), yet it can only mount disks of the \"plain\" build properly and provides no virtualization support at all. It cannot mount UDF disks with VAT, as seen with the Sony Mavica issue. Releases before 10.4.11 mount disks with Sparing Table but does not read its files correctly. Version 10.4.11 fixes this problem.\nSimilarly, Windows XP Service Pack 2 (SP2) cannot read DVD-RW discs that use the UDF 2.00 sparing tables as a defect management system. This problem occurs if the UDF defect management system creates a sparing table that spans more than one sector on the DVD-RW disc. Windows XP SP2 can recognize that a DVD is using UDF, but Windows Explorer displays the contents of a DVD as an empty folder. A hotfix is available for this and is included in Service Pack 3.\nDue to the default UDF versions and options, a UDF partition formatted by Windows cannot be written under macOS. On the other hand, a partition formatted by macOS cannot be directly written by Windows, due to the requirement of a MBR partition table. In addition, Linux only supports writing to UDF 2.01. A script for Linux and macOS called handles these incompatibilities by using UDF 2.01 and adding a fake MBR; for Windows the best solution is using the command-line tool .\nTools for repairing UDF file systems and for modifying their properties have been made for some operating systems. On Windows, the chkdsk tool is able to repair UDF file systems (if not too damaged, like any file system). A similar tool for Linux, codice_13, was under development by Vojtech Vladyka as an extension of fsck, and it was planned to be added to the \"udftools\" package. However, it was abandoned by its developer in 2018. \nA tool for toggling the write protection flag, codice_7, was under development by Johannes Truschnigg in 2023 but could not be merged into the main \"udftools\" package because its maintainer Pali Roh\u00e1r has reportedly lost access to his GitHub account.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "49636", "revid": "1320234354", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49636", "title": "List of castles in England", "text": "This list of castles in England is not a list of every building and site that has \"castle\" as part of its name, nor does it list only buildings that conform to a strict definition of a castle as a medieval fortified residence. It is not a list of every castle ever built in England, many of which have vanished without trace, but is primarily a list of buildings and remains that have survived. In almost every case the buildings that survive are either ruined, or have been altered over the centuries. For several reasons, whether a given site is that of a medieval castle has not been taken to be a sufficient criterion for determining whether or not that site should be included in the list.\nCastles that have vanished or whose remains are barely visible are not listed, except for some important or well-known buildings and sites. Fortifications from before the medieval period are not listed, nor are architectural follies. In other respects it is difficult to identify clear and consistent boundaries between two sets of buildings, comprising those that indisputably belong in a list of castles and those that do not. The criteria adopted for inclusion in the list include such factors as: how much survives from the medieval period; how strongly fortified the building was; how castle-like the surviving building is; whether the building has been given the title of \"castle\"; how certain it is that a medieval castle stood on the site, or that the surviving remains are those of a medieval castle; how well-known or interesting the building is; and whether including or excluding a building helps make the list, in some measure, more consistent.\nIn order to establish a list that is as far as possible comprehensive as well as consistent, it is necessary to establish its boundaries. Before the list itself, a discussion of its scope includes lengthy lists of buildings excluded from the main lists for various reasons. The \"Castellarium Anglicanum\", an authoritative index of castles in England and Wales published in 1983, lists over 1,500 castle sites in England. Many of these castles have vanished or left almost no trace. The present list includes more than 800 medieval castles of which there are visible remains, with over 300 having substantial surviving stone or brick remains.\n&lt;templatestyles src = \"Nonumtoc/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Horizontal TOC/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Hlist/styles.css\"/&gt;\nHistory.\nA castle is a type of fortified structure, developed in Europe during the Middle Ages. The first castles appeared in France in the 10th century, and in England during the 11th century. A few castles are known to have been built in England before the Normans invaded in 1066; a great many were built in the years following, the principal mechanism by means of which the Normans were able to consolidate their control over the country. Whilst a few important castles, such as the White Tower in the Tower of London, were built of stone, most early castles were motte-and-bailey castles of earthwork and timber, which could be constructed quickly. Some were later rebuilt in stone, but there are a great many castle sites in England where all that is visible today are traces of earthworks.\nCastles continued to be built in England for several hundred years, reaching a peak of military sophistication in the late 13th century. The two principal elements in their construction were the great tower or keep, such as the White Tower, and the fortified enclosure, such as is provided by the outer wall of the Tower of London. During the 14th century, largely as a result of the decline of feudalism, the construction of strong castles began to decline, in favour of more lightly fortified structures often described as fortified manor houses. In the far north of England, where conditions remained unsettled, fortified buildings continued to be built as late as the 16th century, not only by the rich and powerful but by any with adequate means, as defence not against great armies, but against the notorious Border Reivers. Many took the form of the pele tower, a smaller, more modest version of the castle keep, and many of these still survive, often incorporated in later buildings.\nCastles differed from earlier fortifications in that they were generally private fortified residences. Typically, a castle was the residence of a feudal lord, providing the owner with a secure base from which to control his lands, and also a symbol of wealth and power. Earlier fortified structures, such as the Saxon burh or the Iron Age hillfort, provided public or communal defences, as did medieval town or city walls. The many Roman forts of which ruins survive in Britain differed in being wholly military in nature; they were camps or strongholds of the Roman army. The Romans also built town or city walls in England, which can still be seen, for instance at Silchester.\nBy the 16th century the role of fortifications had changed once more with the development of artillery capable of breaching even thick stone walls. In the reign of Henry VIII, fears of invasion led to the building of a series of new fortresses along the south coast of England, known as the Device Forts or Henrician Castles. These were designed to use and to defend against artillery, and since they were not private residences, but national fortifications, they do not possess what architectural historians have come to see as the defining characteristics of a castle. Nonetheless, they are visibly castle-like, being compact, with battlemented walls, squat turrets and sometimes a keep; and they were the last generation of fortresses in England to be known as castles, long before architectural historians began to argue that they should not be. One of them, Pendennis Castle, was one of the last Royalist strongholds to fall to the Parliamentarians during the English Civil War\u2014starvation forcing surrender after a siege of five months.\nAs the role of the castle as a fortress declined in the later medieval period, its role as a residence increasingly became the more important. Castles such as Herstmonceux were built with fortifications seemingly designed more for show than for strength, implying a further evolution in the role and concept of the castle, becoming less a means of enforcing power but instead a symbol of its possession, a castle becoming a grand residence proclaiming the status of its owner. Once fortifications had become altogether redundant, it became increasingly rare in England for new buildings to be described as castles, in contrast to France, where country houses continued to be known as ch\u00e2teaux.\nOnce no longer needed as fortresses, castles \u2013 if they were not abandoned \u2013 were, over the centuries, adapted and modernised to make them more suitable for continued use as residences: large windows were inserted in defensive walls, as at Lumley; outer walls were demolished or lowered to open up views from within, as at Raby; new residential ranges were built to improve and extend accommodation, as at Windsor. Some castles were restored after falling into ruin, like Bamburgh; others, like Belvoir, were demolished and rebuilt, retaining little or none of the original structure. In the 18th and 19th centuries especially, many castles underwent \"improvements\" by architects such as Anthony Salvin, and in this period a fashion developed for entirely new houses to be built in the style of castles, and to be known as castles. Amongst these was Peckforton Castle, built by Salvin: a building so authentic in its recreation of a medieval castle that it has been described as possibly the last serious fortified home built in Britain.\nScope and exclusions.\nNo list of castles in England is ever likely to be complete, because there will never be complete agreement in every case as to whether the remains of a building are those of a castle, whether a given place is the site of a castle, or whether a surviving building should be considered to be a castle.\nPerhaps because the castle has become the most familiar type of fortification, many sites of fortifications earlier than the 10th century have become known as castles. Most of these are Iron Age hill forts. Amongst the best known are Abbotsbury Castle, Barbury Castle, Bratton Castle, Cadbury Castle, Castle Dore, Ch\u00fbn Castle, Liddington Castle, Maen Castle, Maiden Castle and Uffington Castle, whilst many more appear in the List of hillforts in England. Others, such as Melandra Castle, Reculver Castle, Richborough Castle and Whitley Castle, are Roman forts, whilst Daw's Castle is a Saxon burh. None of these is included in the present list unless it is also the site of a medieval castle, as is the case with, for instance, Portchester Castle, where an imposing castle was built within the surviving walls of the Roman fort.\nNor are all medieval fortified sites included in the present list. The remains of town and city walls are excluded\u2014most of these appear in the List of town walls in England and Wales. Also excluded are churches with defensive towers, such as Ancroft, Burgh by Sands, Edlingham, Garway, Great Salkeld and Newton Arlosh, as well as other fortified ecclesiastical sites such as Alnwick Abbey, Battle Abbey, Thornton Abbey, Wetheral Priory, Whalley Abbey and St Mary's Abbey, York. Some of the pele towers of Northern England are included, but the more modest fortified buildings known as bastles are not, though the distinction between them is not always altogether clear. Amongst fortified manor houses, those given the title of castle are included, whilst many others were more lightly fortified and are excluded. Amongst these are Baddesley Clinton, Cowdray House, Farnhill Hall, Hipswell Hall, Ightham Mote, Little Wenham Hall, Markenfield Hall and Walburn Hall.\nThe list includes pele towers that became known as castles, or preserve a castle-like aspect. Many others, or their remains, survive much altered\u2014incorporated in later country houses or farmhouses, and are excluded. Amongst these are: Aske Hall, Biddlestone RC Chapel, Bolling Hall, Bolton Old Hall, Boltongate Rectory, Causey Park House, Clennell Hall, Cliburn Hall, Corbridge Low Hall, Cowmire Hall, Craster Arms (Beadnell), Croglin Old Pele, Denton Hall, Dovenby Hall, Dunstan Hall, East Shaftoe Hall, Godmond Hall, Great Salkeld Rectory, Hardrigg Hall, Hepscott Hall, Hetton Hall, Hollin Hall, Hutton Hall (Penrith), Irton Hall, Johnby Hall, Killington Hall, Kirkoswald College, Levens Hall, Little Harle Tower, Nether Hall, Netherby Hall, Ormside Hall, Pockerley Pele, Preston Patrick Hall, Randalholme Hall, Rock Hall, Rudchester Hall, Sella Park, Selside Hall, Skelsmergh Hall, Smardale Hall, Thistlewood Farmhouse, Warnell Hall, Weetwood Hall and Witton Tower.\nIn the post-medieval period, the distinction between true castles and later mock castles is blurred by the extent to which medieval castles were adapted and rebuilt. At Greystoke a new castle was built incorporating a medieval pele tower; at Thurland a new castle was built from the ruins of the old; at Belvoir the old castle was demolished and a new one built. The building of mock castles might be seen as the logical conclusion of a process already apparent in castles such as Herstmonceux or Tattershall, where the castle-like aspect of the building was becoming more for show than for strength.\nAmongst post-medieval buildings in England that are known as castles, a few, such as Peckforton Castle, closely resemble medieval castles. Many others, such as Clearwell Castle, have some castle-like features, and some, like Mereworth Castle, bear no resemblance whatsoever to a castle. The list excludes buildings that neither look like castles, nor incorporate the remains of castles. Amongst these are Bolebroke Castle, Bovey Castle, Bruce Castle, Castle Ashby, Castle Howard, Clifton Castle, Highclere Castle, Mereworth Castle, New Wardour Castle, Sherborne Castle, Wentworth Castle, and Wisbech Castle. Many other buildings with some castle-like features are also excluded. Amongst these are Acton Castle, Allerton Castle, Augill Castle, Avon Castle, Bell's Castle, Bolesworth Castle, Bude Castle, Castle Eden Castle, Castle Goring, Cave Castle, Cholmondeley Castle, Clearwell Castle, Cliffe Castle, Coates Castle, Creech Castle, Droskyn Castle, Edmond Castle, Enmore Castle, Ewell Castle, Farleigh Castle, Farley Castle, Fillingham Castle, Hatherop Castle, Headingley Castle, Highcliffe Castle, Hilfield Castle, Kenwith Castle, Kirby Knowle Castle, Knepp Castle, Luscombe Castle, Midford Castle, Mulgrave Castle, Otterburn Tower, Pentillie Castle, Reeve Castle, Ryde Castle, St. Clare Castle, Sibdon Castle, Sneaton Castle, Stanhope Castle, Studley Castle, Swinton Castle, The Citadel (Weston-under-Redcastle), Tregenna Castle, Vanbrugh Castle, Wadhurst Castle, Wattisham Castle, Whitehaven Castle, Whitstable Castle, Willersley Castle, and Willsbridge Castle. Amongst those that have been demolished is Steephill Castle.\nArtificial ruins and follies, often built as memorials or landscape features, are also excluded. Amongst these are Appley Tower, Black Castle, Bladon Castle, Blaise Castle, Bollitree Castle, Boston Castle, Braylsham Castle, Broadway Tower, Carr Hall Castle, Castlebourne, Clent Castle, Clopton Tower, Dinton Castle, Doyden Castle, Dunstall Castle, Durlston Castle, Fort Putnam, Hadlow Castle, Castle in Hagley Park Lawrence Castle, Long's Park Castle, Mow Cop Castle, Mowbray Castle, Pirton Castle, Radford Castle, Radway Tower, Ragged Castle (Badminton), Rivington Castle, Rodborough Fort, Ross Castle, Rothley Castle, Roundhay Castle, Sebergham Castle, Severndroog Castle, Shaldon Castle, Sham Castle (Bath), Sledmere Castle, Speedwell Castle, Stainborough Castle, Starlight Castle, Stowe Castle, Strattenborough Castle, Sundorne Castle, Toll House (Clevedon) and Wyke Castle. Finally, the 16th-century Henrician Castles, whose design was closely inspired by medieval castles, are included, but later military fortifications\u2014with just a few exceptions\u2014are not.\nHowever carefully the criteria for including a building or site on this list are set out, borderline cases are inevitable. Many buildings known to incorporate northern pele towers in their fabric, but are no longer castle-like\u2014such as the Red Lion Tower in Haltwhistle\u2014have been excluded. On the other hand, Corby Castle, in which a pele tower survives wholly encased in a later building, is included because it is known as a castle, and by implication continued to fulfil the role of one, at least in part. Kimbolton Castle is included as the site of a medieval castle, and because the present mansion has a castellated aspect in deference to the medieval castle it replaced.\nBedfordshire.\nCastles of

{"id": "49639", "revid": "50978518", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49639", "title": "It\u014d Hirobumi", "text": "Prime Minister of Japan (1885\u20131888; 1892\u20131896; 1898; 1900\u20131901)\nPrince It\u014d Hirobumi ( ; born ; 16 October 1841 \u2013 26 October 1909) was a Japanese statesman who served as the first prime minister of Japan from 1885 to 1888. It\u014d would again hold office as prime minister from 1892 to 1896, January\u2014June 1898, and 1900 to 1901. He was also a leading member of the \"genr\u014d\", a group of senior courtiers that dictated policy for the Empire of Japan during the Meiji era. A pragmatic statesman, It\u014d became a central figure in the drafting of the Meiji Constitution as well as the establishment of the National Diet and modern cabinet system.\nBorn into a poor farming family in the Ch\u014dsh\u016b Domain, It\u014d Hirobumi and his father were adopted into a low-ranking samurai family. After the opening of Japan in 1854, he joined the nationalist \"sonn\u014d j\u014di\" movement before being sent to England in 1863 to study at University College London. Following the Meiji Restoration of 1868, It\u014d was appointed a junior councilor for foreign affairs in the newly formed Empire of Japan. Later in 1870, he traveled to the United States to study Western currency, and subsequently helped establish Japan's modern banking and taxation systems. It\u014d then set off on another overseas trip with the Iwakura Mission to the U.S. and Europe. Upon his return to Japan in 1873, he became a full councilor and public works minister.\nBy the early 1880s, It\u014d emerged as the \"de facto\" leader of the Meiji oligarchy. In 1881, he was officially entrusted with overseeing the drafting of the Meiji Constitution. After traveling to Europe to study its nations' political systems, It\u014d settled on adopting a constitution emulating that of Prussia by reserving considerable power with the emperor while limiting political parties' involvement in government. In 1885, he replaced the \"Daij\u014d-kan\" with a cabinet composed of ministry heads, and became the first prime minister. After the constitution was drafted in 1888, he established a supra-cabinet Privy Council led by himself to deliberate on it before the Meiji Constitution was officially proclaimed in 1889. Even out of office as prime minister, It\u014d exercised immense influence over Japan's governance as an imperial adviser, or \"genkun\", and as President of the Privy Council. In 1900, he founded the Rikken Seiy\u016bkai political party, recognizing the growing importance of party politics.\nOn the world stage, It\u014d pursued an ambitious foreign policy. He strengthened diplomatic ties with Western powers including Germany, the United States, and especially the United Kingdom. In Asia, he oversaw the First Sino-Japanese War and negotiated the surrender of China's ruling Qing dynasty on terms favorable to Japan, including the annexation of Taiwan and the release of Korea from the Chinese tributary system. While expanding his nation's claims, It\u014d sought to avoid conflict with Russia through the policy of \"Man-Kan k\u014dkan\" \u2013 the proposed surrender of Manchuria to Russia's sphere of influence in exchange for the recognition of Japanese hegemony in Korea. However, his attempts at diplomacy failed, thereby resulting in the Russo-Japanese War. After Japanese forces defeated the Russians, the ensuing Japan\u2013Korea Treaty of 1905 made It\u014d the first Resident-General of Korea. Despite initially supporting a protectorate rather than outright annexation of Korea, pressure from the increasingly powerful Imperial Army and the failure of his gradualist policies ultimately led him to consent to annexation. He resigned as Resident-General in June 1909 only to be assassinated four months later by Korean-independence activist and nationalist An Jung-geun in Harbin, Manchuria.\nEarly life and education.\nOrigins and adoption.\nIt\u014d Hirobumi was born Hayashi Risuke on 16 October 1841 (Tenp\u014d 12, 2nd day of the 9th month) in Tsukari village, Su\u014d Province (present-day Hikari, Yamaguchi Prefecture), within the Ch\u014dsh\u016b Domain. He was the son of Hayashi J\u016bz\u014d, a farmer of humble origins. His father served a low-ranking samurai named It\u014d Naoemon in the castle town of Hagi. When Hirobumi was very young, his father was adopted into the It\u014d family along with his household, granting them samurai status, albeit at the lowest rank of \"ch\u016bgen\" (foot soldier). After the adoption, Risuke's name was changed to It\u014d Risuke, then It\u014d Shunsuke in 1858, and finally to Hirobumi around 1869. The name \"Hirobumi\" (\u535a\u6587), meaning \"extensive learning\", was reportedly suggested by Takasugi Shinsaku and derived from \"The Analects of Confucius\".\nYoshida Sh\u014din and early activism.\nIn 1856, It\u014d was sent for guard duty in Sagami Province. There, in 1857, Kuruhara Ry\u014dz\u014d, a brother-in-law of Kido Takayoshi, recognized It\u014d's potential and encouraged his intellectual pursuits. Later that year, It\u014d returned to Ch\u014dsh\u016b and, with Kuruhara's introduction, enrolled in the Sh\u014dka Sonjuku, a private academy run by the influential scholar and activist Yoshida Sh\u014din. The academy was a crucible for many future leaders of the Meiji Restoration, including Takasugi Shinsaku and Yamagata Aritomo.\nYoshida Sh\u014din's execution in the Ansei Purge of 1859 profoundly impacted It\u014d, who, along with Kido Takayoshi and others, retrieved Yoshida's body for burial. Following this, It\u014d became deeply involved in the radical \"sonn\u014d j\u014di\" (Revere the Emperor, Expel the Barbarians) movement. In 1862, he participated in an unsuccessful plot to assassinate Nagai Uta, a Ch\u014dsh\u016b official. Later that year, he took part in the burning of the British legation in Edo. Subsequently, along with Yamao Y\u014dz\u014d, he assassinated the Japanese classics scholar Hanawa Jir\u014d Tadatomi, acting on a false report.\nDespite his early immersion in Sh\u014din's ideology, It\u014d later distanced himself from its radicalism, viewing the anti-Western sentiment of the era as \"entirely emotional\" and lacking \"thoughtful political calculations\". He came to admire figures like Nagai Uta for their pragmatic \"political strategy\", signaling his own developing preference for statesmanship grounded in realism.\nStudy in Britain and return.\nDriven by a strong desire for Western knowledge, It\u014d was selected as one of the Ch\u014dsh\u016b Five to secretly travel to Britain in 1863 for study, an act that violated the Tokugawa shogunate's ban on overseas travel. The Ch\u014dsh\u016b Domain's leadership, including Sufu Masanosuke, saw this as crucial for acquiring \"human tools\" and understanding Western civilization to prepare Japan for future international engagement. The five students departed Japan on 27 June 1863, arriving in London on 4 November. They commenced their studies at University College London, lodging with Professor Alexander Williamson and immersing themselves in English language and Western customs.\nIt\u014d's initial period of study in Britain was cut short. After about six months, he and Inoue Kaoru decided to return to Japan upon learning from \"The Times\" about the bombardment of Shimonoseki by Western powers and the conflict between the Satsuma Domain and a British naval squadron. Their aim was to persuade the Ch\u014dsh\u016b leaders of the impracticality of expelling foreigners.\nThis first overseas experience, though brief, proved to be a pivotal moment in It\u014d's life. He returned to Japan in July 1864, during a period of national crisis. His firsthand knowledge of the West and his newly acquired English skills made him an invaluable asset. Following Ch\u014dsh\u016b's defeat by the allied Western naval forces at Shimonoseki, It\u014d played a crucial role as a negotiator in the peace talks. This experience launched his career as a skilled negotiator, a talent Yoshida Sh\u014din had earlier recognized. His time in Britain broadened his perspective beyond narrow domainal loyalties and the anti-foreign movement, fostering an independent spirit and a commitment to \"extensive learning\" (the meaning of \"Hirobumi\"). It\u014d developed a functional command of English, later delivering speeches in the language during the Iwakura Mission and maintaining a habit of reading English publications. He frequently gave interviews to Western media without an interpreter and conducted correspondence in English throughout his career.\nEarly Meiji statesman.\nRise in the Meiji government.\nAfter the Meiji Restoration in 1868, It\u014d's understanding of Western affairs became a significant asset, propelling his career in the new imperial government. In February 1868, he was assigned to a role in foreign affairs. Later that year, he was appointed the first governor of Hy\u014dgo Prefecture, which included the recently opened port of Kobe. This position placed him at the forefront of Japan's diplomatic and international trade activities.\nIn February 1869, It\u014d submitted a significant policy paper, \"Principles for National Policy\" (\"Kokuze k\u014dmoku\"), also known as the \"Hy\u014dgo Proposal\". This comprehensive six-point plan advocated for:\nThe proposal strongly emphasized the necessity \"to let people throughout Japan learn the science behind the scientific achievements of the world, thereby spreading knowledge of the natural sciences\". He urged the government to cultivate a \"civilized and enlightened\" populace and proposed the establishment of universities in Tokyo and Kyoto.\nIt\u014d was profoundly influenced by the example of the United States, viewing its founding as a model for creating a unified nation-state where national prosperity was driven by the \"united hearts and minds of the people\". He advocated for transcending narrow domainal loyalties to forge a cohesive Japanese national identity.\nFinancial and monetary reforms.\nIn 1870, while serving as deputy vice-minister of finance, It\u014d traveled to the United States to study its financial and monetary institutions. This investigative tour, which lasted from December 1870 to June 1871, directly influenced the establishment of Japan's New Currency Regulation (\"Shinka J\u014drei\") in 1871. This landmark legislation placed Japan on the gold standard, aligning its monetary system with those of Western nations. It\u014d was a fervent champion of this reform, dispatching a memorandum from the U.S. that argued for its adoption based on the successful experience of \"civilized Western countries\". While the move to the gold standard was considered radical by some contemporaries, the reform also incorporated elements of continuity with Japan's pre-existing monetary framework.\nIt\u014d also played a pivotal role in the development of a modern banking system in Japan. He advocated for the creation of a bank of issue, and in December 1872, the National Bank Regulation (\"Kokuritsu Gink\u014d J\u014drei\") was promulgated, drawing inspiration from America's National Bank Act. His proposal envisioned a system where national banks would be authorized to issue banknotes backed by government bonds. This was part of a strategy to gradually replace inconvertible paper currency with banknotes convertible into specie. This methodical, step-by-step approach to monetary reform was an early example of the cautious gradualism that characterized his broader reform philosophy.\nIwakura Mission and shift to gradualism.\nFrom late 1871 to 1873, It\u014d served as one of four deputy ambassadors in the Iwakura Mission, a comprehensive eighteen-month diplomatic and investigative tour of the United States and Europe. As a central member of the embassy, his ability to deliver speeches in English made him an important asset. The primary objectives of the mission were to initiate preliminary negotiations for the revision of the unequal treaties imposed on Japan by Western powers and to observe and study various aspects of Western civilization, including political systems, industry, and education. It\u014d had been a key proponent of such an undertaking, having earlier suggested sending government officials abroad to study treaty revision and related international practices.\nDuring the mission's initial leg in the United States, It\u014d's English proficiency and confident demeanor were notable, although his assertive style occasionally caused friction with some colleagues, such as Sasaki Takayuki. In January 1872, at a welcoming event in San Francisco, he delivered a widely reported and spirited address, subsequently known as the \"rising sun speech\" (\"hinomaru enzetsu\"). In this speech, he proudly described Japan's rapid advancements in adopting Western institutions and proclaimed the nation's strong aspiration to achieve a high level of civilization and take its place among the advanced nations of the world.\nA significant diplomatic misstep occurred in Washington D.C. when It\u014d and fellow deputy ambassador \u014ckubo Toshimichi advocated for immediate treaty renegotiation with the United States, deviating from the mission's original plan to engage with Western powers collectively at a later stage. They even returned to Japan briefly to secure the necessary full Letters of Credence for this purpose. However, upon their return to Washington, they discovered that the other mission members, having become aware of the complexities and potential disadvantages of unilateral most-favored-nation clauses, had decided to adhere to the original strategy. This \"Letters of Credence Incident\" resulted in considerable embarrassment for It\u014d and significantly strained his relationship with Kido Takayoshi, another influential member of the mission.\nDespite this setback, the Iwakura Mission proved to be a profoundly transformative experience for It\u014d, significantly shaping his political philosophy. His direct observations of political conditions in Europe, including periods of instability in France and the intricacies of Otto von Bismarck's Germany, led him to a deeper appreciation for well-established institutions and a more measured, gradual approach to national reform. This experience solidified It\u014d's transition from a proponent of more radical reforms to an advocate for gradual, systematic institution-building, adapted to Japan's specific conditions.\nFather of the Meiji Constitution.\nBuilding the foundations (1873\u20131881).\nUpon his return to Japan from the Iwakura Mission in September 1873, It\u014d was immediately thrust into the intense political debate surrounding the \"Seikanron\" (debate over conquering Korea). He aligned himself with senior leaders like Iwakura Tomomi, Kido Takayoshi, and \u014ckubo Toshimichi, who opposed a military expedition to Korea, advocating instead for a focus on domestic development and gradual reform. Following the \"Political Crisis of 1873\" (\"Meiji rokunen seihen\"), which saw the resignation of key proponents of the expedition, including Saig\u014d Takamori, It\u014d was appointed as a councilor (\"sangi\") and concurrently as minister of public works, solidifying his position as a key figure in the government.\nIn November 1873, It\u014d, along with Terashima Munenori, was tasked with \"investigating constitutional government\" (\"seitai torishirabe\"), marking the formal beginning of Japan's journey towards a written constitution. He was significantly influenced by the ideas of Kido and \u014ckubo, both of whom submitted memorials to the throne advocating for the eventual establishment of a constitutional system that would include popular participation, to be achieved through a gradual process. It\u014d began to formulate concrete plans, proposing the convention of prefectural governors to form a lower assembly and the expansion of an existing imperial advisory body, the \"Jak\u014d-no-ma\", into an upper assembly. These initiatives culminated in the Osaka Conference of 1875, a meeting of key Meiji leaders that resulted in an imperial edict promising the gradual establishment of constitutional government. This edict led to the creation of the Assembly of Prefectural Governors and the \"Genr\u014din\" (Chamber of Elders), institutions It\u014d saw as precursors to a future parliament.\nIn an 1880 opinion paper on the future constitution, submitted to Emperor Meiji, It\u014d reiterated his cautious approach. He advised against hastily establishing a full-fledged parliament, proposing instead a further strengthening of the \"Genr\u014din\" and the introduction of a system of public auditors, selected from the general populace, to oversee fiscal matters and promote transparency. This proposal underscored his commitment to gradualism and his belief that the emperor should publicly demonstrate this principle of measured reform. His stance contrasted sharply with the Confucian moralism of court advisers like Motoda Eifu, who advocated for a state doctrine based on traditional ethics. It\u014d, in his 1879 paper \"On Education\" (\"Ky\u014diku-gi\"), argued against the state controlling a \"national doctrine\" (\"kokky\u014d\"). His primary concern was the destabilizing effect of widespread political debate among an unprepared populace; he therefore advocated for practical, secular education to curb this tendency, rather than for a state-sponsored moral code.\nPolitical Crisis of 1881 and European tour.\nThe political landscape underwent a significant upheaval with the \"Political Crisis of 1881\". Councilor \u014ckuma Shigenobu, one of the more \"enlightened of the younger statesmen\" along with It\u014d and Inoue Kaoru, controversially submitted a proposal directly to the throne advocating for the immediate adoption of a British-style parliamentary cabinet system and the rapid establishment of a national assembly, with elections to be held as early as the following year. This move, perceived as a challenge to the established oligarchic leadership and their gradualist approach, combined with public outcry over the \"Hokkaido Colonization Office Scandal\", significantly weakened \u014ckuma's position within the government. Antagonized by \u014ckuma's unilateral action, It\u014d exploited the ensuing political crisis, offering his own resignation to force the issue. He secured agreement from senior statesmen on a gradualist approach based on a Prussian-influenced model, thereby resolving the internal bureaucratic struggle over the type and timing of the constitution. Upon successfully pushing for \u014ckuma's resignation, It\u014d emerged as first among equals within the Meiji oligarchy. \nIn March 1882, It\u014d embarked on an extensive year-and-a-half-long study tour of Europe, with the primary mission of researching various European constitutions and systems of government in preparation for drafting Japan's own. His objective was not merely to study constitutional texts but to understand how to effectively operate a constitutional state. The fundamental elements of the future constitution had already been decided upon before he left; the trip was intended to gather theoretical arguments and prestige to counter both liberal and conservative opposition at home. In Berlin, he attended lectures by the legal scholar Professor Rudolf von Gneist, but found Gneist's emphasis on historical jurisprudence and his skepticism about transplanting constitutional models less directly applicable to Japan's immediate needs. It\u014d encountered strong anti-parliamentarian sentiments in Germany, with both Gneist and even Kaiser Wilhelm I expressing reservations about the establishment of a powerful parliament, particularly in a nation without a long tradition of such institutions.\nA more formative part of his European tour was his time in Vienna, beginning in August 1882, where he studied with the political economist Professor Lorenz von Stein. Stein's \"Staatswissenschaft\" (science of the state) had a profound impact on It\u014d. Stein's theories emphasized the critical role of effective state administration (\"Verwaltung\") as a necessary complement to constitutional government (\"Verfassung\"), arguing for a system that could reconcile parliamentary mechanisms with the broader public interest and efficient governance of the state. This approach resonated deeply with It\u014d's pragmatic desire for practical guidelines for establishing and managing a constitutional state. Stein's ideas provided It\u014d with a sophisticated conceptual framework that moved beyond the abstract natural law theories then popular among some popular rights advocates in Japan, offering instead a model of a state grounded in administrative capacity and historical context. Furthermore, Stein stressed the importance of a robust system of education to support a constitutional state and cultivate an informed citizenry, reinforcing It\u014d's own belief in the importance of education for national development. It\u014d returned to Japan in August 1883, equipped with new insights and renewed confidence for the task of constitution-making.\nDrafting and promulgation, first premiership (1885\u20131888).\nUpon his return from Europe, It\u014d assumed leadership of the newly established Bureau for Investigation of Constitutional Systems (\"Seido Torishirabe Kyoku\") within the Imperial Household Agency in 1884. This body was specifically created to draft the constitution. He worked closely with a team of legal scholars and officials, including Inoue Kowashi (often considered the principal drafter of the text), It\u014d Miyoji, and Kaneko Kentar\u014d. The German legal scholar Hermann Roesler also served as an important adviser, with his personal draft being extremely close to the final product. While Inoue Kowashi was a strong proponent of the German model, It\u014d's extensive research across Europe, including his period of study in London, contributed to a broader and more nuanced understanding of constitutional principles.\nSeveral key institutional reforms led by It\u014d paved the way for the new constitutional order:\nThe Meiji Constitution was officially promulgated on 11 February 1889. During the ceremony, It\u014d, as President of the Privy Council, handed the text of the Constitution to Emperor Meiji, who then handed it to Prime Minister Kuroda Kiyotaka. In speeches delivered shortly after, both It\u014d and Kuroda affirmed the principle of \"transcendental\" cabinets that stood above political parties, a final expression of the anti-party sentiment of the 1880s.\nIt\u014d emphasized that the constitution was granted by the Emperor, a framework rooted in Japan's unique national polity (\"kokutai\"). In a speech at \u014ctsu, he explained that \"as the supreme right is one and indivisible, the legislative power remains in the hands of the Sovereign and is not bestowed on the people.\" In his \"Commentaries on the Constitution\" (1889), he further argued against the theory of laws as contracts between the governing and the governed, asserting that \"the legislative power is ultimately under the control of the Emperor, while the duty of the Diet is to give advice and consent.\" In a famous 1888 speech, he had described the imperial house as the \"axis of the nation\", a spiritual and historical anchor for the state equivalent to the role of Christianity in the West. His \"Commentaries\" blended references to Japan's mythical past with discussions of modern European statecraft. However, he consistently stressed that the constitution also guaranteed popular participation through the Diet and acknowledged the inevitable role of political parties. During the Privy Council debates on the constitution, It\u014d held his ground against more conservative figures like Mori Arinori, who argued for a purely advisory Diet, insisting that \"if we want to establish a constitutional government, we have to give the right of decision to the Diet.\"\nContinued political career.\nWorldview and approach to governance.\nWhile he initially championed a \"transcendental\" cabinet that stood above partisan politics, It\u014d's experiences led him to acknowledge the inevitable rise and importance of political parties. Condemning what he termed \"extremely democratic ideas,\" he believed them unsuitable for a compact nation like Japan that required \"solidity of organization and the efficiency of its administrative activity.\" In an 1885 letter to Inoue Kaoru, he expressed his view that the arguments of party leader Itagaki Taisuke contained principles \"completely incompatible with our nation\" and were morally hazardous to the Imperial Household. A hallmark of It\u014d's political career was his pragmatism and his ability to adapt his views to changing circumstances, a trait that earned him the nickname \"Round It\u014d\" (\"M\u0101rui It\u014d\") from commentators like Tokutomi Soh\u014d. He enjoyed a close personal relationship with Emperor Meiji, who often consulted him on practical matters of parliamentary politics, valuing his advice on how to manage the newly established Diet.\nIt\u014d's pragmatism was particularly evident in his evolving interpretation of \"kokutai\" (national polity). In an 1884 exchange with the conservative court official Sasaki Takayuki, It\u014d argued that \"kokutai\" was not immutable but was synonymous with the \"national organization,\" including its land, people, and institutions, and would naturally change with the times. He viewed Sasaki's belief in an unchanging imperial line as the sole definition of \"kokutai\" as erroneous. However, by 1908, in a speech marking the twentieth anniversary of the Constitution's promulgation, It\u014d reversed his position, declaring that \"constitutional government could never change the \"kokutai\"\" and invoking the familiar rhetoric of an unbroken imperial line since Emperor Jimmu. This shift demonstrated his political acumen, adopting the now commonly accepted ideological line for the sake of national unity and political expediency.\nSecond and third premierships (1892\u20131896, 1898).\nIt\u014d remained a powerful figure even out of the Prime Minister's office, primarily through his leadership of the Privy Council. His influence was shaped by the deepening split within the oligarchy between his own \"civil\" faction and the \"military\" faction led by Yamagata Aritomo. The first session of the National Diet was held in November 1890. In August 1892, It\u014d formed his second cabinet, serving as prime minister until August 1896. His ideas had by then begun to diverge from those of his fellow oligarchs; while most still adhered to a strict policy of transcendental cabinets, It\u014d had reluctantly come to accept the necessity of establishing a government party. He had recommended this in a memorial to the Emperor as early as January 1892, but Yamagata and the other elder statesmen vetoed the idea, viewing it as a step towards British-style party cabinets.\nThis period was marked by the outbreak of the First Sino-Japanese War (1894\u20131895). Following Japan's victory, It\u014d was involved in the negotiations for the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895. His handling of the Diet during this premiership was characterized by pragmatic compromise. In the 1893 budget crisis, he defused an attack on the government by having the Emperor issue a rescript that called for fiscal responsibility from both the government (by contributing from imperial household funds for naval expansion and requiring officials to contribute a tenth of their salaries) and the Diet, a move that allowed both sides to save face. He twice dissolved the Diet (the fifth and sixth sessions) largely to demonstrate to foreign powers that his government was in firm control of anti-foreign elements, thereby smoothing the path for the crucial revision of the unequal treaties.\nIt\u014d formed his third cabinet in January 1898, aiming to secure the support of both the opposition Jiy\u016bt\u014d (Liberal) and Shimpot\u014d (Progressive) parties, but failed to gain either. During this brief premiership, he expressed his intention to found a political party. However, facing difficulties in managing the government, opposition from figures like Yamagata to his party plans, and a failure to secure support from key industrialists, It\u014d dissolved the House of Representatives in June 1898. Later that month, with the merger of the Jiy\u016bt\u014d and Shimp\u014dt\u014d parties into the Kenseit\u014d, It\u014d resigned as prime minister. In a masterful political maneuver that outflanked Yamagata, he recommended that \u014ckuma Shigenobu and Itagaki Taisuke form Japan's first party cabinet, thereby setting a precedent for party-based government that he would later capitalize on himself.\nRelations with China.\nIt\u014d Hirobumi's engagement with China was a significant, though complex, aspect of his later career, influencing his views on regional stability, economic development, and Japan's role in East Asia. His two-month visit to Korea and China in August\u2013November 1898, undertaken shortly after the dissolution of his third cabinet, proved particularly formative.\nDuring this trip, It\u014d was warmly received by Chinese reformers, including Kang Youwei, who saw Meiji Japan as a model for China's own modernization. He arrived in Beijing at the height of the Hundred Days' Reform movement, led by the Guangxu Emperor. However, It\u014d found himself on the fringes of the 1898 coup engineered by Empress Dowager Cixi, which abruptly ended the reforms and led to the persecution of its leaders. While It\u014d was critical of the reformers' precipitous approach and maintained a cautious distance from their movement, he was deeply concerned by the ensuing political instability and the purge of reformist intellectuals. He intervened to help some reformers, like Liang Qichao, escape to Japan and advocated for the protection of others.\nIt\u014d's encounters with prominent Chinese officials like Zhang Zhidong, viceroy of Huguang, were particularly significant. Despite the political turmoil, It\u014d and Zhang found common ground in their advocacy for gradual reform and their appreciation for Western science and technology, albeit within a framework that respected national context. It\u014d was particularly interested in Zhang's efforts to develop industry in the Hubei region, including the Hanyang Steel Mill. Their meeting facilitated an agreement for Japan's Yahata Steel Works to obtain iron ore from China's Daye mine, a development that marked the beginning of significant Japan-China economic cooperation in this sector, though it later became a point of contention in imperialistic narratives.\nWhile pessimistic about China's immediate political future due to its internal divisions and the perceived rigidity of its institutions, It\u014d was highly optimistic about its economic potential. He believed that Japan, as a more advanced nation in the region, had a role to play in fostering economic ties and promoting \"civilization\" \u2013 by which he meant modern science, industry, and rational governance \u2013 in China. His vision for Japan involved steering clear of direct political interference in China while actively engaging with its economy, seeing mutual benefit in regional development. He consistently argued against territorial expansion for its own sake, emphasizing that economic prosperity and the exchange of knowledge were more important. However, he also spoke of Japan's \"moral obligation\" as a \"pioneer of modernization\" to guide China and Korea, a stance that, while framed in terms of shared progress, carried paternalistic undertones. His experiences in China in 1898 reinforced his belief in a gradual, education-focused approach to modernization and informed his strategy for Japan's engagement with the continent, emphasizing economic cooperation and the cultivation of a \"nation of commerce\".\nStumping for the Constitution.\nFollowing the promulgation of the Meiji Constitution in 1889, It\u014d embarked on extensive speaking tours across Japan in 1899, the tenth anniversary of the event. His aim was to explain the ideals of constitutionalism and popular government. He used a sophisticated media strategy, ensuring that reporters from newspapers like the \"T\u014dky\u014d Nichinichi Shinbun\" accompanied him, and his speeches were widely disseminated and even compiled into a book. In these speeches, he emphasized that the constitution guaranteed the people's right to participate in government.\nTreaty revision and foreign relations.\nA major national goal during It\u014d's career was the revision of the unequal treaties imposed on Japan by Western powers in the mid-19th century. The new treaties, which abolished extraterritoriality and partially restored tariff autonomy, came into effect in July\u2013August 1899. It\u014d saw this as a momentous occasion, marking Japan's full entry into the international community and the \"mixed residence\" (\"naichi zakkyo\") of Japanese and foreigners. He countered fears of economic invasion by arguing that opening the country would facilitate Japan's economic growth through competition and the absorption of Western knowledge and experience. His primary concern was that Japan should face the world \"with the magnanimity of a great nation\" and maintain its \"civilized\" status.\nHis views on patriotism (\"aikokushin\") were pragmatic, emphasizing economic development and national wealth creation over ideological fervor or jingoism. \"Without wealth the culture of the people cannot advance\", he stated, advocating for patriotism that served practical ends.\nFounding of the Rikken Seiy\u016bkai.\nDespite his earlier advocacy for a \"transcendental\" cabinet, It\u014d's thinking on the role of political parties evolved. He became increasingly dissatisfied with the existing state of party politics in Japan, which he viewed as fractious and often detrimental to national harmony and effective governance. His decision to form a new political party stemmed from a desire to reform party politics from within and to create an organization that could support his vision of constitutional government.\nIn September 1900, It\u014d founded the Rikken Seiy\u016bkai (Friends of Constitutional Government), becoming its first president. This marked the birth of Japan's first political party capable of taking the reins of government, and it became a dominant force in Japanese politics for decades, eventually evolving into the modern Liberal Democratic Party.\nMotivations and ideals.\nIt\u014d envisioned the Seiy\u016bkai not merely as a vehicle for gaining political power but as a new kind of political organization \u2013 a \"society\" (\"kai\") rather than a traditional \"party\" (\"t\u014d\"), a term he felt carried connotations of self-serving factions (\"h\u014dt\u014d\"). He aimed to create an organization that could transcend narrow partisan interests and act for the public benefit. The decision was a pragmatic response to the political realities of the 1890s, where \"transcendental\" cabinets had repeatedly failed to secure stable majorities in the Diet, hindering governance and national progress. It\u014d believed that a responsible party should supply competent personnel to the cabinet and contribute to harmonious governance, rather than simply seeking to control the executive branch.\nFormation, fourth premiership (1900\u20131901).\nThe formation of the Seiy\u016bkai was not without difficulties. It\u014d's attempts to rally support from the business and financial communities met with limited success. Prominent figures like Shibusawa Eiichi, while sympathetic to It\u014d's policies, were hesitant to directly join the party, partly due to a traditional disdain among entrepreneurs for direct political involvement and partly due to interference from established political and business interests, such as those connected to Iwasaki Yanosuke, who was aligned with \u014ckuma's Progressive Party. Ultimately, the Seiy\u016bkai was formed largely on the existing organizational base of the Kenseit\u014d (the former Liberal Party faction), led by figures like Hoshi T\u014dru. It\u014d attempted to disguise this fact, insisting that the Kenseit\u014d formally dissolve before its members joined his new organization.\nIt\u014d's draft rules for the Seiy\u016bkai emphasized several key principles:\nIn a speech at the party's founding, It\u014d stated his constitutional philosophy, affirming that \"the appointment and dismissal of Cabinet Ministers appertain, under the Constitution, to the prerogatives of the Sovereign,\" but that party members were not to \"interfere in any manner with the discharge of their political duties.\" These rules reflected It\u014d's ideal of a party that maintained a distinction between itself and the cabinet, promoted national unity, and was led with clear authority and discipline. He advocated for a \"salon-like\" or club-style organization for the party's local branches to encourage broad participation and the free exchange of ideas, while simultaneously insisting on strong central leadership.\nSoon after its founding, It\u014d formed his fourth cabinet in October 1900, with most ministerial posts filled by Seiy\u016bkai members. However, this cabinet was short-lived, plagued by internal disunity, difficulties in managing party members' demands for posts, and conflict with the House of Peers, where ex-bureaucratic followers of Yamagata were particularly hostile to the inclusion of party politician Hoshi in the cabinet. After Hoshi was forced to resign, It\u014d's cabinet faced an internal conflict over financial policy, and he resigned as prime minister in June 1901, having failed to secure the approval of the other elder statesmen for a new, reorganized cabinet. He continued as president of the Seiy\u016bkai but faced ongoing challenges in instilling his ideals of party discipline and national-level focus. Disappointment over issues like the government's signing of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance (which he had opposed in favor of a Russo-Japanese entente) and internal party conflicts led to his resignation as Seiy\u016bkai president in July 1903, at which point he was reappointed President of the Privy Council. He was succeeded as party leader by Saionji Kinmochi.\nConstitutional Reforms of 1907.\nEven after stepping down from active party leadership, It\u014d continued to be deeply involved in shaping Japan's constitutional framework. From 1903, as reappointed president of the Imperial Household Research Committee (which he had first headed in 1899), he embarked on a major project of constitutional reforms, culminating in significant legislative changes in 1907. These reforms aimed to consolidate the national structure, clarify the emperor's role, and strengthen the cabinet's authority in governance.\nThe committee's primary task, under It\u014d's guidance and with the detailed work of legal scholar Ariga Nagao, was to restructure the imperial household system and integrate it more fully as an organ of the state, rather than a separate entity. This involved revising the Imperial Household Law and establishing a unified system of national laws that clearly positioned the imperial household within the state's constitutional framework. The K\u014dshikirei Order (Order concerning Forms of Imperial Rescripts, Statutes, and Other State Documents) of 1907 was a key outcome, establishing procedures for issuing imperial edicts and revising fundamental laws, including the Meiji Constitution and the Imperial Household Law itself.\nA crucial aspect of these reforms was the effort to bolster the power of the prime minister and the cabinet, particularly in relation to the military. The revised Cabinet Organization Order, implemented alongside the K\u014dshikirei Order, restored the requirement for the Prime Minister to countersign all laws and imperial ordinances, an attempt to curb the military's practice of \"iaku j\u014ds\u014d\" (direct appeal to the emperor on military matters, bypassing the cabinet). It\u014d envisioned a system of responsible government led by a strong cabinet, with the emperor acting as a constitutional monarch whose prerogatives were exercised in accordance with law and through designated state organs.However, these efforts to subordinate the military to cabinet control met with strong resistance from army leaders, particularly Yamagata Aritomo. The ensuing compromise resulted in the promulgation of Military Ordinance No. 1 (\"On Military Ordinances\") in September 1907, which, while intended by some in government (like Home Minister Hara Takashi) to codify and thus limit \"iaku j\u014ds\u014d\", effectively institutionalized the military's right of direct appeal for \"supreme command-related matters\". This outcome, though a partial setback for It\u014d's goal of full cabinet supremacy, was seen by him as a step towards clarifying the military's constitutional position, with the ongoing intent to bring military administration under greater legal and cabinet oversight, particularly during his subsequent role in Korea. The 1907 reforms, therefore, represented a complex and somewhat ambiguous development in Meiji constitutionalism, aiming to create a more integrated and powerful state but also inadvertently solidifying a degree of military independence.\nResident-General of Korea.\nIt\u014d Hirobumi's final major role was as the first Resident-General of Korea, a position he assumed in March 1906 following the establishment of Japan's protectorate over Korea via the Japan\u2013Korea Treaty of 1905 in November 1905. This period of his career is among the most controversial, directly preceding Japan's full annexation of Korea in 1910.\nDual role and objectives.\nDuring his tenure as Resident-General, It\u014d simultaneously continued his work on constitutional reforms in Japan as president of the Imperial Household Research Committee. He approached the governance of Korea with the goal of modernizing the country through gradual reforms in its political, economic, and social structures. In a 1906 statement to the Korean cabinet, he argued that Japan did not wish to \"swallow up Korea\", viewing the creation of an independent and reliable ally under Japanese guidance as a more cost-effective policy than direct colonial rule. He initially expressed a more optimistic view of Koreans' potential for self-government than other Japanese leaders, arguing that their backwardness was a product of a corrupt elite rather than any inherent racial characteristic. His strategy was reform through \"self-rule\", which required finding reliable Korean collaborators.\nPolicies and challenges.\nA central part of It\u014d's agenda was educational reform. He advocated for the introduction of Western-style practical science and the establishment of a modern education system, aiming to move Korea away from its traditional Confucian-centric learning, which he viewed as anachronistic and detrimental to progress. He sought to depoliticize the Korean imperial court and integrate it into a rationalized state structure, similar to his efforts with the Japanese imperial system.\nHowever, It\u014d's policies faced immense challenges. His relationship with Emperor Gojong quickly deteriorated into mutual animosity, as It\u014d constantly reminded the emperor of his precarious hold on power while Gojong continued to resist Japanese authority through secret appeals to other foreign powers. The Hague Secret Emissary Affair in 1907, where Gojong attempted to appeal to international powers against the protectorate, was the \"final straw\" for It\u014d. On 3 July, he confronted the emperor and then urged the Korean cabinet, led by Yi Wan-yong, to secure the emperor's abdication, which occurred on 19 July. This led to the signing of the Japan\u2013Korea Treaty of 1907, which significantly expanded the Resident-General's powers and effectively brought Korean domestic administration under Japanese control, including the installation of Japanese vice-ministers and the abolition of the Korean army.\nIt\u014d also worked to assert civilian control over the Japanese military garrison in Korea, a continuation of his efforts in Japan to subordinate the military to the cabinet. The ordinance establishing the Residency-General, which It\u014d himself drafted, granted him the authority to command the Japanese troops in Korea, a rare power for a civilian official. He used this authority to limit military expansion and check arbitrary actions by the army. His efforts were undermined by the growing anti-Japanese resistance. The righteous army movement escalated into a widespread guerrilla insurgency following the disbandment of the Korean army in 1907. It\u014d initially underestimated the strength of the popular antipathy but by early 1908 had become pessimistic. He backed the Japanese military's often brutal suppression tactics, which included indiscriminate retaliation against the civilian population, admitting that the measures had been \"too severe\".\nShift towards annexation and resignation.\nThe spread of the \"righteous army\" movement provided ample proof that It\u014d's gradualist reform program had failed to win over the Korean populace. Concluding that the policy of \"nurturing self-rule\" was a dead end, he resigned as Resident-General in June 1909. He had never ruled out annexation as an option, telling Foreign Minister Hayashi Tadasu in 1907 that it would be \"good policy\" to secure Russia's assent in advance. In April 1909, he gave his approval to the annexation plan proposed by Prime Minister Katsura Tar\u014d and Foreign Minister Komura Jutar\u014d. This shift is attributed by Takii to Japan's decision to secure Korea in exchange for ceasing its pursuit of interests in Manchuria, a compromise reached amidst international pressures, particularly concerning the Gando Convention with China. For It\u014d, preventing deeper military entanglement in Manchuria became a paramount concern. His final acquiescence, driven by the failure of his policies in Korea and the recognition that it was easier to make enemies than friends there, cleared the way for the advocates of annexation to accelerate their plans.\nEven as he agreed to annexation, his dictated memo outlined a post-annexation structure for Korea that included a two-house parliament with elected Korean representatives and a responsible cabinet composed of Koreans, supervised by a Japanese viceroy. This suggests that even in the context of annexation, It\u014d envisioned a degree of Korean autonomy and popular participation, though whether this was a realistic or achievable plan remains debatable.\nAssassination.\nOn 26 October 1909, It\u014d Hirobumi was assassinated at the Harbin railway station in Manchuria. He was there to meet with Vladimir Kokovtsov, a Russian representative, to discuss regional issues, including Manchuria. As It\u014d stepped off the train to review the Russian guards, he was shot six times by An Jung-geun, a Korean nationalist and independence activist; three of the shots were fatal. An, who was arrested by Russian guards, cited fifteen crimes It\u014d had committed, including the murder of Empress Myeongseong, forcing the abdication of Emperor Gojong, and plundering Korea. An stated he had assassinated It\u014d as a \"lieutenant general of the righteous army\" because It\u014d, by disturbing the peace of East Asia, had estranged Japan and Korea. He hoped that relations between the two countries would become closer, as a model for the world. He also maintained that he had intentionally deceived Emperor Meiji, who desired peace in East Asia and Korean independence.\nIt\u014d's death sent shockwaves through Japan and the international community. Upon hearing the news, Emperor Meiji expressed genuine grief. His assassination removed a powerful, albeit controversial, voice from Japanese politics and is considered by some historians to have accelerated Japan's path towards the full annexation of Korea, which occurred in August 1910.\nLegacy.\nIt\u014d Hirobumi remains a highly significant and complex figure in modern Japanese history. He is widely recognized as a principal architect of the Meiji state, the \"father of the Meiji Constitution\", and a driving force behind Japan's rapid modernization in the late 19th century. His achievements include the establishment of key institutions such as the cabinet system, the Imperial University, the Diet, and the Privy Council, all of which laid the groundwork for modern Japanese governance. Affable and garrulous, in contrast to the stern and private Yamagata Aritomo, he was an able and many-sided statesman. He was a quintessential \"Meiji bureaucrat as politician\", contrasting with Yamagata, who was more of an \"ideologue\". A French editorial at the time of his death noted that while It\u014d was an intelligent and active statesman, his \"principal work... was to be the head of state, the living symbol of the national life\".\nHis founding of the Rikken Seiy\u016bkai was a pivotal step in the development of party politics in Japan. His decision in 1898 to facilitate the creation of Japan's first party cabinet, and his subsequent formation of the Rikken Seiy\u016bkai in 1900, mark his recognition of the practical necessity of combining bureaucratic expertise with party-based political support, a hybrid model that would shape Japanese politics for decades to come.\nHowever, his legacy is also deeply controversial, particularly due to his role as Resident-General of Korea and his part in the process that led to Korea's annexation. While some interpretations, such as that of Takii Kazuhiro, emphasize his commitment to gradualism, civilization-building, and constitutionalism, even in his approach to Korea, he is widely viewed in Korea as a symbol of Japanese imperialism. The ideology of Japanese imperialism in Korea during his time developed a distinctive cultural cast; the shared history and ethnicity with Koreans permitted the Japanese to imagine a degree of commonality not available to Western colonialists. It\u014d and others used rhetoric like the \"family metaphor\" to justify Japanese political and social subordination of Korea as a \"natural\" hierarchy between an \"older\" and \"younger\" brother.\nTakii Kazuhiro's scholarship presents It\u014d not as an unprincipled opportunist, but as a \"statesman of knowledge\" (\"chi no seijika\") who consistently pursued a vision of a strong, civilized, and constitutional Japanese state. This interpretation highlights It\u014d's lifelong emphasis on education, the acquisition of practical knowledge, and the gradual development of popular participation in government as essential components of nation-building. His efforts to integrate the imperial institution into a modern constitutional framework and to balance executive power with parliamentary mechanisms were central to his political project.\nThe complexities of his legacy are reflected in the contrasting ways he is remembered: in Japan, often as a great modernizer, and in Korea, as a key figure in its colonization. His assassination by An Jung-geun is a stark reminder of the deep enmities engendered by Japan's imperial expansion. Reconciling these different facets of It\u014d Hirobumi's life and impact remains an ongoing task for historians.\nHistoric sites.\nThe house where It\u014d lived from age 14 in Hagi after his father was adopted by It\u014d Naoemon still exists, and is preserved as a museum. It is a one-story house with a thatched roof and a gabled roof, with a total floor area of 29 \"tsubo\" and is located 150 meters south of the Sh\u014dkasonjuku Academy. The adjacent villa is a portion of a house built by It\u014d in 1907 in Oimura, Shimoebara-gun, Tokyo (currently Shinagawa, Tokyo). It was a large Western-style mansion, of which three structures, a part of the entrance, a large hall, and a detached room, were transported Hagi. The large hall has a mirrored ceiling and its wooden paneling uses 1000-year old cedar trees from Yoshino. The buildings were collectively designated a National Historic Site in 1932.\nIn 1932, the Japanese unveiled the Hakubun-ji Buddhist Temple () in Seoul, dedicated to It\u014d as the \"Prince It\u014d Memorial Temple (\u4f0a\u85e4\u516c\u7235\u7948\u5ff5\u5bfa\u9662)\". Situated in then Susumu Tadashidan Park on the north slope of Namsan, which after liberation became Jangchungdan Park \uc7a5\ucda9\ub2e8 \uacf5\uc6d0. From October 1945, the main hall served as student home, ca. 1960 replaced by a guest house of the Park Chung-Hee administration, then reconstructed and again a student guest house. In 1979 it was incorporated into the grounds of the Shilla Hotel then opened. Several other parts of the temple are still at the site.\nPersonal life.\nIt\u014d Hirobumi married It\u014d Umeko, who was the daughter of Kida Ky\u016bbei of J\u014dnokoshi, Shimonoseki, in 1866. He had previously been married to Irie Sumiko from 1863, but they divorced in 1866. He had a son-in-law, Suematsu Kench\u014d, and an adopted son, Y\u016bkichi (1870\u20131931). An emotional man, It\u014d was known to break down in tears when faced with difficult situations.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Along with Pedro Armend\u00e1riz and Dolores del R\u00edo, she was one of the most successful figures of Latin American cinema in the 1940s and 1950s. Considered one of the most beautiful actresses of the Golden Age of Mexican cinema, her strong personality and taste for finesse garnered her the title of diva early in her career. She was known as \"La Do\u00f1a\", a name derived from her character in \"Do\u00f1a B\u00e1rbara\" (1943), and \"Mar\u00eda Bonita\", thanks to the anthem composed exclusively for her as a wedding gift by her second husband, Agust\u00edn Lara. Her acting career consists of 47 films made in Mexico, Spain, France, Italy, and Argentina.\nEarly life.\nMar\u00eda de los \u00c1ngeles F\u00e9lix G\u00fcere\u00f1a was born in \u00c1lamos, Sonora, Mexico, on 8 April 1914. Her birth was registered on May 4, which was later misreported as her date of birth.\nShe was the daughter of Bernardo F\u00e9lix Flores, a military officer and politician who was of distant Yaqui descent, and Josefina G\u00fcere\u00f1a Rosas, who grew up in the U.S. state of California; both were of Mexican ancestry. She had fifteen siblings: Josefina, Mar\u00eda de la Paz, Pablo, Bernardo, Miguel, Mar\u00eda de las Mercedes, Fernando, Victoria Eugenia, Ricardo, Benjam\u00edn and Ana Mar\u00eda del Sacramento.\nShe spent her childhood in \u00c1lamos. During her childhood, she had a close relationship with her brother Pablo. Her mother separated the two siblings, thinking they might be involved in an incestuous relationship. For that reason, Pablo was sent to the Colegio Militar, in Mexico City.\nLater, the F\u00e9lix family moved to Guadalajara. When Mar\u00eda was 17, her beauty soon began to attract attention. She was crowned Beauty Queen at the University of Guadalajara. It was at this time that she met Enrique \u00c1lvarez Alatorre, a salesman for the cosmetics firm Max Factor. After a brief romance, the couple married in 1931. In 1935, F\u00e9lix gave birth to her only child, Enrique, nicknamed \"Quique\". Her marriage with \u00c1lvarez was unsuccessful and the couple divorced in 1937. After her divorce, F\u00e9lix returned to Guadalajara with her family, where she was the subject of gossip and rumors due to her status as a divorc\u00e9e. Because of this situation, F\u00e9lix decided to move to Mexico City with her son.\nIn Mexico City, she worked as a receptionist in a plastic surgeon's office, and lived in a guest house. One day, the father of her son visited the child, and deliberately refused to give the boy back to his mother. \u00c1lvarez took the child to Guadalajara. F\u00e9lix's son was recovered with the help of Agust\u00edn Lara, her second husband. They planned an elaborate recovery that tricked the grandmother and took the child.\nCareer.\nFirst years.\nOne afternoon after work when walking down the street in Mexico City, director and filmmaker Fernando Palacios approached her asking if she wanted to make films. Her response was:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"When I want to, it will be through the big door.\"\nPalacios finally persuaded her to break into films. Becoming her \"Pygmalion\", he began to train her and present her in film circles. She made her first appearance in the \"White and Black Ballroom\" of the Mexico City Country Club where some of the great Mexican film stars of the era (Esther Fern\u00e1ndez, Lupe V\u00e9lez, Andrea Palma) gathered. Eventually she was taken to Hollywood, to the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, where she met Cecil B. DeMille, who offered to launch her film career in Hollywood, but F\u00e9lix was not interested. She preferred to begin her career in her own country. Finally, thanks to Palacios, she was offered the female lead role in a film by Grovas Productions: \"El Pe\u00f1\u00f3n de las \u00c1nimas\", directed by Miguel Zacar\u00edas.\nIn the film \"El Pe\u00f1\u00f3n de las \u00c1nimas\", F\u00e9lix starred opposite the popular Mexican actor and singer Jorge Negrete. Mar\u00eda F\u00e9lix and Jorge Negrete got off to a bad relationship during the filming because he had asked that his girlfriend, the actress Gloria Mar\u00edn, be given the lead role. For this reason, the shooting of the film was difficult and led to a direct confrontation between F\u00e9lix and Negrete. That confrontation helped to cement the reputation of F\u00e9lix as a tough and arrogant woman.\nIn her second film, \"Mar\u00eda Eugenia\", F\u00e9lix would be projected in a role out of her temperamental film personality. However, the film is remembered as the only film where F\u00e9lix appeared in swimwear. The same happened with the film \"La china poblana\" (1943), where F\u00e9lix claimed to have paid a debt of gratitude to her discoverer Fernando Palacios, who directed the film. Nobody has heard from this film (the second color film of the Mexican cinema), so it is considered lost. She called both films \"her beginner sins\".\nF\u00e9lix was known as \"La Do\u00f1a\" for her role in the film \"Do\u00f1a B\u00e1rbara\" (1943), based on the novel by the Venezuelan writer R\u00f3mulo Gallegos. For the film, another actress (Isabela Corona) was already hired, but when Gallegos first saw F\u00e9lix, he was charmed by her and said: \"Here is my Do\u00f1a B\u00e1rbara!\" The film was filmed in Venezuela with Mexican and Venezuelan actors. \"Do\u00f1a B\u00e1rbara\" was to be the start of her major collaborations with the Mexican film director Fernando de Fuentes. F\u00e9lix and de Fuentes filmed together another two films: \"La Mujer sin Alma\" (1944) and \"La Devoradora\" (1946). As Mar\u00eda F\u00e9lix herself said, \"With these films, I became the number one enemy of the Mexican family morals.\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Somehow, I seduced the public, even those who criticize the conduct of my characters in the films. My legend began to take shape without moving a finger. The public imagination did everything for me.\"\nWithout her stereotyped role of a \"femme fatale\", Mar\u00eda F\u00e9lix filmed two sophisticated films: \"El monje blanco\" (1945), directed by Julio Bracho, and \"Vertigo\" (1946), directed by Antonio Momplet. Both characters required a great dramatic intensity.\nUnder the direction of Emilio Fern\u00e1ndez, Mar\u00eda F\u00e9lix made three successful films: \"Enamorada\" (1946), \"R\u00edo Escondido\" (1947), and \"Maclovia\" (1948). The relationship between F\u00e9lix and Fern\u00e1ndez was cordial and smooth, despite the strong and famous temperament of the film director. In \"Enamorada\", Mar\u00eda F\u00e9lix found her perfect film partner, the actor Pedro Armend\u00e1riz. The films of Mar\u00eda F\u00e9lix with Fern\u00e1ndez and his team (writer Mauricio Magdaleno, photographer Gabriel Figueroa, and Armend\u00e1riz) had strong presence in several international film festivals. In turn, they gave Mar\u00eda F\u00e9lix her first Ariel Award for \"Enamorada\" and \"R\u00edo Escondido\".\nBetween the films with Fern\u00e1ndez, Mar\u00eda F\u00e9lix also worked with Roberto Gavald\u00f3n, another director who showcased some of her best performances. Their first collaboration was in \"La diosa arrodillada\" (1947) with Arturo de C\u00f3rdova. Thanks to these films, Mar\u00eda F\u00e9lix's fame crossed the Atlantic.\nIn 1948 she was contracted by the Spanish film producer Ces\u00e1reo Gonz\u00e1lez. In this manner Mar\u00eda F\u00e9lix began her film adventure in Europe. She made only one more film in Mexico (\"Do\u00f1a Diabla\", 1949) until her return in 1952.\nEurope.\nF\u00e9lix debuted in the European cinema in Spain, with the film \"Mare Nostrum\" (1948), directed by Rafael Gil. With Gil as director, she made another two films in 1950: \"Una mujer cualquiera\" and \"La noche del s\u00e1bado\". In 1951, she filmed the French-Spanish production \"La Couronne Noire\" directed by Luis Saslavsky based on a story by Jean Cocteau. She debuted in Italy with the film \"Incantesimo Tragico\" (1951). In the same year, she filmed \"Messalina\" (1951), directed by Carmine Gallone. During the shooting of the film, F\u00e9lix suffered an emotional shock: her father died of a heart attack in Navojoa.\nIn 1952, F\u00e9lix traveled to Argentina, where she filmed \"La pasi\u00f3n desnuda\" of the Argentine filmmaker Luis C\u00e9sar Amadori. In the same year, F\u00e9lix returned to Mexico. She concluded her working relationship with Ces\u00e1reo Gonz\u00e1lez with the film \"Camelia\" filmed in her native country. Her stay in Mexico was mainly based on her marriage to the actor and singer Jorge Negrete, her former film rival, with whom she filmed \"El rapto\", directed by Emilio Fern\u00e1ndez, Negrete's last film.\nAfter Negrete's death on 5 December 1953, F\u00e9lix returned to Europe. In France she made the films \"La Belle Otero\" (1954), and \"Les H\u00e9ros sont Fatigu\u00e9s\" (1955), alongside Yves Montand. However, the most important film of F\u00e9lix in this period was \"French Cancan\" (1954) directed by Jean Renoir with French actor Jean Gabin. Her last film shot entirely in Europe was the Spanish film \"Faustina\".\nLast films.\nF\u00e9lix returned to Mexico in 1955. This period of her career was characterized by performing in period pieces inspired by the Mexican Revolution. This cycle begins with \"La Escondida\" (1955). In this film, as well as in stories like \"Canasta de cuentos mexicanos\" (1955) and \"Caf\u00e9 Col\u00f3n\" (1958), she worked again with Pedro Armend\u00e1riz. In 1956 she starred in \"Tizoc\" with the actor and singer Pedro Infante. However, the film was not liked by the actress, despite her international success. Eventually she filmed \"Beyond All Limits\" (1957) with Jack Palance, and the melodramas \"Ash Wednesday\" and \"The Empty Star\" (both 1958). In 1959 she played the title role in \"The Soldiers of Pancho Villa\" with top billing lead Dolores del R\u00edo. In 1959 she performed in the Spanish-Mexican co-production \"Sonatas\" directed by Juan Antonio Bardem and the French-Mexican co-production \"La Fi\u00e8vre Monte \u00e0 El Pao\", directed by Luis Bu\u00f1uel.\nIn the 1960s F\u00e9lix's presence in the cinema was limited to only a few films. The most prominent were \"Juana Gallo\" (1960), \"La Bandida\" (1962), \"Amor y sexo\" (\"Sapho '63\", 1963)), and \"La Valentina\" (1966). In 1970 she filmed \"La Generala\", which would be her last film. The Mexican historical telenovela \"La Constituci\u00f3n\" (1971) would be her last professional acting job. F\u00e9lix attempted to return to the cinema twice. First, in 1982, with the film \"To\u00f1a Machetes\", and again in 1986 with the film \"Ins\u00f3lito resplandor\". Neither project crystallized, and F\u00e9lix never reappeared in film.\nRoles declined in Hollywood.\nAlmost from the beginning of her career, F\u00e9lix received job offers in Hollywood, but F\u00e9lix herself said: \"They only give me huehuenche (Indian) roles\". While she was in France, Hollywood offered her the female role of \"Duel in the Sun\", but she passed and the part went to Jennifer Jones. Another proposal was \"The Barefoot Contessa\" with Humphrey Bogart, but she refused it, instead making \"La Belle Otero\" in France. Ava Gardner ended up with the part. Later, the director Robert Aldrich sent her the script of \"The Legend of Lylah Clare\", but she did not reach an agreement with the director and Kim Novak got the role.\nPersonal life.\nF\u00e9lix was married four times. Her first marriage (1931\u20131938) was with the cosmetics sales agent Enrique \u00c1lvarez Alatorre. \nHe fathered her only child, actor Enrique \u00c1lvarez F\u00e9lix (1934\u20131996). According to journalist Sergio Alm\u00e1zon, once she found her son wearing a white dress and necklace. Infuriated, she beat him unconscious. \u00c1lvarez retaliated by taking their son to Guadalajara. Years later F\u00e9lix was able to get her son back with the help of her second husband, Agust\u00edn Lara. F\u00e9lix's relationship with her son was distant in his early years because she sent him to schools abroad \"to discipline\" him. Years later, Enrique returned to Mexico and started a career as an actor in film and television. Regarding her son, F\u00e9lix said: \"Enrique is a very gifted man, with admirable common sense. He's my best friend. I have so much fun with him. He's not a 'mama's boy' as many believe. Self-employed, fight like being independent. He has his own career, his audience, his poster and assumes his responsibilities without relying on me.\" The unexpected death of Enrique from a heart attack in 1996 affected F\u00e9lix greatly.\nThere are conflicting rumors that, in between her marriages to Enrique \u00c1lvarez and Agust\u00edn Lara, F\u00e9lix had a brief marriage to Ra\u00fal Prado, member of the Tr\u00edo Calaveras, but no concrete evidence has emerged that the marriage ever took place. Most of the rumors agree in claiming that Prado and F\u00e9lix allegedly got married in 1943 after meeting on the set of \"The Rock of Souls\" and separated two months after the wedding. Mexican writer Enrique Serna interviewed the last survivor of the trio, Miguel Bermego, who told him he was a witness to the wedding. Prado's niece Mar\u00eda Escalera also corroborated the marriage, saying that the marriage ended when Agust\u00edn Lara sent F\u00e9lix a white piano as a gift, and \"Ra\u00fal threw her out \u2014 with the piano. They later divorced. So, it appears, Mar\u00eda F\u00e9lix was my \"t\u00eda pol\u00edtica\" [aunt-in-law].\" In his book about F\u00e9lix \"Mar\u00eda F\u00e9lix: 47 pasos por el cine\", Paco Ignacio Taibo I wrote about the marriage as factual, saying, \"While shooting this film, Mar\u00eda would meet Ra\u00fal Prado, a member of the Los Calaveras trio. After a quick courtship they got married and shortly after they divorced. This is one of the most carefully protected chapters of the star's life. Mar\u00eda's friends keep claiming that it was crazy.\" Prado's obituary in the Spanish newspaper \"El Pa\u00eds\" in April 1989 reported the marriage as factual, as did some obituaries of F\u00e9lix's, such as the one in Argentine newspaper \"La Naci\u00f3n\", the latter which only cited \"a biography\" as a source. It was cited by \"TVyNovelas\" as one of the \"myths\" surrounding F\u00e9lix. It is known that F\u00e9lix vehemently denied ever having married Prado. Serna, who also interviewed F\u00e9lix, said \"On our first meeting I asked her about her marriage to Ra\u00fal Prado (which she denied until the end), the member of the Calaveras trio who sang in Jorge Negrete's films, and she told me that if I was going to go on with those lies, we were not going to be able to work on the book.\" Serna added, \"At one point she told me: 'Write what you want about me, because they believe anything about me. Say that I slept with an octopus.'\"\nHer second marriage (1945\u20131947) was to the composer Agust\u00edn Lara. F\u00e9lix was a fan of Lara since her adolescence. They were formally introduced by a mutual friend, the actor Tito Novaro. The couple began a highly publicized relationship, which culminated in marriage in 1945. Lara immortalized F\u00e9lix in a number of songs, such as \"Humo en los ojos\" (\"Smoke in the eyes\"), \"Cuando vuelvas\" (\"When you come back\"), \"Dos pu\u00f1ales\" (\"Two daggers\"), \"\"Madrid\" and especially the famous theme \"Mar\u00eda Bonita\", composed in Acapulco during their honeymoon. \"Mar\u00eda Bonita\"\" would become one of Lara's most popular songs. However, the relationship ended in 1947 due to Lara's jealousy. F\u00e9lix said that Lara even tried to kill her in a fit of violent jealousy.\nAfter her second divorce, F\u00e9lix had romances with some well-known men, such as Mexican aviation entrepreneur Jorge Pasquel, Spanish bullfighter Luis Miguel Domingu\u00edn, and Argentine actor Carlos Thompson. F\u00e9lix met Thompson in Argentina in 1952 during the filming of Luis C\u00e9sar Amadori's \"La pasi\u00f3n desnuda\", and the relationship was reportedly serious to the point that they became engaged to be married, and F\u00e9lix even called for her son Enrique \u00c1lvarez F\u00e9lix to meet his potential stepfather. However, during filming, F\u00e9lix received a call from director Emilio Fern\u00e1ndez to offer her the leading role in \"The Rapture\", which F\u00e9lix accepted, telling Thompson that after filming of \"La pasi\u00f3n desnuda\" ended she would return to Mexico to promote the film and announce their future marriage. However, once in Mexico, F\u00e9lix canceled the wedding days before it would take place, stating that she concluded that the only thing that united her to Thompson was a mere physical attraction and not true love.\nDuring her stay in France, F\u00e9lix was introduced by the painter Leonor Fini to French writer Jean Cau, assistant of the writer Jean Paul Sartre. F\u00e9lix had a brief romance with Cau. From the end of 1950 to the spring of 1954, F\u00e9lix also had a passionate same-sex affair with Suzanne Baul\u00e9, better-known as Frede, who at the time ran the cabaret \"Le Carroll's\" on Rue de Ponthieu in Paris, and the two women lived together at the Hotel George-V. The relationship was captured in a painting made by Fini of a plant with two flowers; one had the face of F\u00e9lix and the other Frede's. Frede followed F\u00e9lix on her filming trips to Buenos Aires and S\u00e3o Paulo upon learning of F\u00e9lix's relationship with Carlos Thompson. F\u00e9lix and Frede's relationship was interrupted by F\u00e9lix's marriage to Jorge Negrete, but upon Negrete's death in 1953, F\u00e9lix returned to Paris to briefly rekindle her relationship with Frede. However, they would violently break-up for good in 1954, leading to a trial in which F\u00e9lix wanted to take back jewellery she had given to Frede and accused her of theft. F\u00e9lix lost her lawsuit, and Frede was acquitted and kept the jewellery. F\u00e9lix retained ownership of the painting Fini made of the two women, and after the break-up persuaded Fini to modify it to erase Frede's face, changing it to hers, resulting in the painting's two flowers both having Felix's face.\nIn 1953, when F\u00e9lix returned to Mexico after her stay in Europe and Argentina, she was reunited with an \"old enemy\": the actor and singer Jorge Negrete. Unlike their difficult first meeting ten years ago on the set of \"El pe\u00f1\u00f3n de las \u00e1nimas\", F\u00e9lix found Negrete, in her own words: \"surrendered to my feet\". After a brief romance, the couple married in 1953, transmitted by radio to all Latin America, held at the House of Catipoato in Tlalpan. Negrete was already ill when the marriage took place, and died eleven months later at a hospital in Los Angeles, United States, while F\u00e9lix was in Europe shooting \"La Belle Otero\". F\u00e9lix's appearance at his funeral, dressed in trousers, caused a huge scandal, which led her to take refuge in Europe.\nHer fourth marriage (1956\u20131974), was with the Romanian-born French banker Alexander Berger. F\u00e9lix met Berger in the 1940s, when they were both married. Years later they met again. F\u00e9lix was married to Berger for 18 years. She tried becoming a mother again, but an accident during a filming in 1957 caused F\u00e9lix to lose the child. It was at this time that she built her famous home, \"La Casa de las Tortugas\" (The House of Turtles), designed by Pepe Mendoza and resembling an Italian villa, in Cuernavaca. Berger died in 1974 of lung cancer months after the death of F\u00e9lix's mother, which plunged her into a deep depression. To overcome this depression, she developed a new passion: horses. Some of her horses won major international equestrian awards. F\u00e9lix kept horses for 11 years.\nHer last romantic relationship was the Russian-French painter Antoine Tzapoff, who was 31 years her junior. About him, F\u00e9lix said: \"I don't know if he's the man who has most loved me, but he's who has loved me better.\"\nThe press speculated about a strong rivalry between F\u00e9lix and Dolores del R\u00edo, the other leading female figure of Mexican cinema and a successful Hollywood star. Regarding this \"rivalry\", F\u00e9lix said: \"With Dolores I had no rivalry. On the contrary, we were friends and always treated each other with great respect, each with our own personality. We were completely different. She was refined, interesting, gentle on the deal, and I'm energetic, arrogant and bossy.\"\nInfluence.\nArt.\nDuring her life, F\u00e9lix was a model for many renowned painters. In her adolescence she was painted in Guadalajara by Jos\u00e9 Clemente Orozco, but F\u00e9lix said, \"He painted me like a skull with make-up.\" F\u00e9lix met the artist Diego Rivera during the filming of \"R\u00edo Escondido\" (1947). F\u00e9lix developed a friendship with him and his wife, Frida Kahlo. In 1949, Rivera painted a portrait of her, which F\u00e9lix classified as \"very bad\". In later years, Rivera asked to borrow the painting to be displayed as part of a retrospective on Rivera's work, but F\u00e9lix refused. F\u00e9lix did not like the painting and she sold it to Juan Gabriel for 15 million pesos. F\u00e9lix would say, \u201cI've never liked Rivera's painting, I told him. I wanted him to paint me as a Tehuana, but he said it was very vulgar, so he painted me as he wanted ... naked, because he was very much in love with me. Later, Diego wanted that portrait for an exhibition in the Palacio de Bellas Artes, but since I did not lend it to him, he stopped talking to me for more than a year. One day there was a bricklayer fixing my house, and I sent him to paint [my nude portrait] with white to cover a bit of everything and that's how it ended up. I sold it, very badly sold by the way.\"\nOther renowned artists who recorded F\u00e9lix in their canvases were the Surrealists Leonor Fini, Leonora Carrington, Remedios Varo and Bridget Tichenor among others. In the 1980s, the Russian-French artist Antoine Tzapoff (F\u00e9lix's last partner) captured her in numerous portraits.\nLiterature, Music, and Theater.\nF\u00e9lix also had dealings with numerous Mexican and foreign writers and playwrights some of whom have dedicated several novels. Among them they are Renato Leduc, Xavier Villaurrutia, Salvador Novo, Pita Amor, Jean Cocteau and Octavio Paz. Luis Spota was inspired by her life for his novel \"The Empty Star\", and F\u00e9lix even starred in the film version in 1958. Carlos Fuentes did the same in the novel \"Zona sagrada\". Her relationship with Fuentes was terminated when the author made the play \"Orchids in the Moonlight\", in which he parodies the figures of F\u00e9lix and Dolores del R\u00edo. F\u00e9lix, angry, called him \"mujerujo\" (\"womanish\").\nSongs were composed for F\u00e9lix, including \"Mar\u00eda de Todas las Mar\u00edas\" by Juan Gabriel and \"Je l'aime \u00e0 mourir\" by Francis Cabrel.\nFashion.\nIn fashion, F\u00e9lix was dressed by designers like Christian Dior, Givenchy, Yves Saint Laurent, Chanel, and Balenciaga. The House of Herm\u00e8s (Couture Department) designed extravagant creations just for her. She was a noted collector of fine antiques, favoring pieces like her famous collection of Second French Empire furniture. She was also a jewelry connoisseur and had an extensive jewelry collection, including the 41.37 carat (8.274 g), D-flawless \"Ashoka\" diamond. In 1968, she commissioned a serpent diamond necklace from Cartier. The result was a completely articulated serpent made out of platinum and white gold and encrusted with 178.21 carats (35.642 g) of diamonds. In 1975, she again asked Cartier to create a necklace for her, this time in the shape of two crocodiles. The two crocodile bodies were made of 524.9 grams of gold, one covered with 1,023 yellow diamonds, while the other was adorned with 1,060 circular cut emeralds. Later she sold most of her jewelry back to Cartier. She also left a Rolls-Royce in Paris.\nSince F\u00e9lix's death, these jewelry pieces have been displayed as part of \"The Art of Cartier Collection\" in several museums around the world. To pay tribute to the actress, in 2006 Cartier debuted its \"La Do\u00f1a de Cartier collection\". \"The La Do\u00f1a de Cartier watch\" with reptilian links was created to impress by its wild look. The case of the \"La Do\u00f1a de Cartier\" features a trapezoid shape with an asymmetrical profile reminiscent of a crocodile's head. The wristband of the watch resembles the contours of a crocodile in large, bold and gold scales. The \"La Do\u00f1a de Cartier Collection\" also includes jewelry, accessories, and handbags.\nMexican milliner to the stars Gladys Tamez dedicated a hat collection \"El F\u00e9nix\" inspired by and intended to honor F\u00e9lix.\nIn 2023, Museo Jumex in Mexico City displayed iconic jewelry pieces worn by Maria F\u00e9lix in the exhibition \u201cCartier Design: A Living Legacy\u201d that featured more than 160 pieces and was designed by renowned Mexican architect Frida Escobedo and curated by the Mexican art critic Ana Elena Mallet.\nDeath and legacy.\nMar\u00eda F\u00e9lix died in her sleep on 8 April 2002, her 88th birthday in Mexico City. She was buried in her family's mausoleum alongside her son Enrique and parents at the Pante\u00f3n Franc\u00e9s located in Mexico City. \nIn 2014, https://, holder of the Reserva de Derechos in Mexico, acquired F\u00e9lix's IP rights.

However, in 1974, he introduced the one-piece skin suit into speed skating. In spite of the fact that he improved his times dramatically, he was initially laughed at. However, when other skaters also showed improvement, the top skaters quickly switched to the suits as well. Krienb\u00fchl also introduced minor improvements for skates.\nKrienb\u00fchl's best performance was the eighth position on the 10,000\u00a0m at the 1976 Winter Olympics. He stopped speed skating internationally at age 48 the next season, though he continued to skate competitively until 1986. During his career, he won at least 14 Swiss Allround Championships.
