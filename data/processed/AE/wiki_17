Regarded as a pop culture icon, he is one of the best-selling recording artists of all time. Michael was known as a creative force in songwriting, vocal performance, and visual presentation. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2023.\nBorn in East Finchley, Middlesex, Michael rose to fame after forming the pop duo Wham! with Andrew Ridgeley in 1981. He took part in Band Aid's UK number-one single \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" in 1984 and performed at the following year's Live Aid concert. His debut studio album, \"Faith\" (1987), won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year and became one of the best-selling albums of all time, having sold over 25 million copies worldwide. Michael then went on to release a series of multimillion-selling albums, including \"Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1\" (1990), \"Older\" (1996), \"\" (1998), \"Songs from the Last Century\" (1999), \"Patience\" (2004), and \"Twenty Five\" (2006). \nMichael came out as gay in 1998, and was an active LGBTQ rights campaigner and HIV/AIDS charity fundraiser. His personal life, drug use, and legal troubles made headlines following an arrest for public lewdness in 1998 and multiple drug-related offences. The 2005 documentary \"\" covered his career and personal life. His 25 Live tour spanned three tours from 2006 to 2008. \nIn 2011, Michael fell into a coma after developing pneumonia, but recovered. He performed his final concert at London's Earls Court in 2012. Michael died of heart disease on Christmas Day in 2016, at his home in Goring-on-Thames, Oxfordshire.\nMichael had 10 number-one songs on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and 13 number-one songs on the UK singles chart. His most successful singles include \"Careless Whisper\", \"A Different Corner\", \"I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me)\", \"Faith\", \"Father Figure\", \"One More Try\", \"Monkey\", \"Praying for Time\", \"Freedom! '90\", \"Jesus to a Child\", \"Fastlove\", \"Outside\", \"Amazing\", and \"An Easier Affair\". His awards include two Grammy Awards, three Brit Awards, twelve \"Billboard\" Music Awards, and four MTV Video Music Awards. He was listed among \"Rolling Stone\"'s 200 Greatest Singers of All Time and \"Billboard\"'s Greatest Hot 100 Artists of All Time. The Radio Academy named him the most played artist on British radio during the period 1984\u20132004.\nEarly life, family and education.\nGeorgios Kyriacos Panayiotou () was born in East Finchley, the only son and the youngest child of three. His father, Kyriacos \"Jack\" Panayiotou, was a Greek Cypriot restaurateur who emigrated from Patriki, Cyprus, to England in the 1950s. His mother, Lesley Angold (born Harrison, 1937\u20131997), was an English dancer. In June 2008, Michael told the \"Los Angeles Times\" that his maternal grandmother was Jewish, but she had married a non-Jewish man and raised their children with no knowledge of their Jewish background due to her fear during World War II.\nMichael spent most of his childhood in Kingsbury, London, in the home his parents bought soon after his birth; he attended Roe Green Junior School and Kingsbury High School. Michael had two sisters: Yioda (born 1958) and Melanie (1960\u20132019). On BBC's \"Desert Island Discs\", Michael said that his interest in music followed an injury to his head around the age of eight.\nEarly music.\nWhile Michael was in his early teens, the family moved to Radlett.&lt;ref name=\"forunitedkingdomlovers/george-michael\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"Negus/suburban-Wham\"&gt; https:// &lt;/ref&gt; There, Michael began attending Bushey Meads School in Bushey,&lt;ref name=\"bbc/43783251\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; where he, as \"Yog\" befriended his future Wham! partner Andrew Ridgeley. The two had the same ambition of being musicians. Michael busked on the London Underground, performing songs such as \"'39\" by Queen. His involvement in the music business began with his working as a DJ, playing at the Bel Air Restaurant in Northwood, London,&lt;ref name=\"watfordobserver/5729852\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"Gavin/George-Michael\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"Ridgeley/Wham-Memoir\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; clubs, and local schools around Bushey, Stanmore, and Watford. This was followed by the formation of a short-lived ska band called the Executive, with Ridgeley, Ridgeley's brother Paul, Andrew Leaver, Jamie Gould, and David Mortimer (later known as David Austin).\nWham!\nMichael formed the duo Wham! with Ridgeley in 1981. On the cusp of fame, he decided to legally change his name to the more accessible George Michael. The band's first album \"Fantastic\" reached No. 1 in the UK in 1983 and produced a series of top 10 singles including \"Young Guns\", \"Wham Rap! (Enjoy What You Do)\", and \"Club Tropicana\". Their second album, \"Make It Big\", reached No. 1 on the charts in the US. Singles from that album included \"Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go\" (No. 1 in the UK and US), \"Freedom\", \"Everything She Wants\", and \"Careless Whisper\" which reached No. 1 in nearly 25 countries, including the UK and US, and was Michael's first solo effort as a single. In December 1984, the single \"Last Christmas\" was released. In 1985, Michael received the first of his three Ivor Novello Awards for Songwriter of the Year from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors.\nMichael performed on the original 1984 Band Aid recording of \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\"\u2014he appears third on the song after Paul Young and Boy George sing their lines. The song became the UK Christmas number one and Michael also donated the profits from \"Last Christmas\" and \"Everything She Wants\" to charity. Michael sang \"Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me\" with Elton John at Live Aid at Wembley Stadium in London on 13 July 1985. He also contributed background vocals to David Cassidy's 1985 hit \"The Last Kiss\", as well as Elton John's 1985 successes \"Nikita\" and \"Wrap Her Up\". Michael cited Cassidy as a major career influence and interviewed Cassidy for David Litchfield's \"Ritz Newspaper\".\nWham!'s tour of China in April 1985, the first visit to China by a Western popular music act, generated worldwide media coverage, much of it centred on Michael. The headline in the \"Chicago Tribune\" read: \"East meets Wham!, and another great wall comes down\". Before Wham!'s appearance in China, many kinds of music in the country were forbidden. The band's manager, Simon Napier-Bell, had spent 18 months trying to convince Chinese officials to let the duo play. The audience included members of the Chinese government. Chinese television presenter Kan Lijun, who was the on-stage host, spoke of Wham!'s historic performance: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;No-one had ever seen anything like that before. All the young people were amazed and everybody was tapping their feet. Of course the police weren't happy and they were scared there would be riots. Wham! performed their hits with scantily clad dancers and strobing disco lights. According to Napier-Bell, Michael tried to get the crowd to clap along to \"Club Tropicana\", but \"they hadn't a clue \u2013 they thought he wanted applause and politely gave it\", before adding that some Chinese did eventually \"get the hang of clapping on the beat.\" A UK embassy official in China stated \"there was some lively dancing but this was almost entirely confined to younger western members of the audience.\" The tour was documented by film director Lindsay Anderson and producer Martin Lewis in their film \"\".\nWith the success of Michael's solo singles, \"Careless Whisper\" (1984) and \"A Different Corner\" (1986), rumours of an impending break up of Wham! intensified. The duo officially separated in 1986, after releasing a farewell single, \"The Edge of Heaven\" and a farewell compilation, \"The Final\" (their third album \"Music from the Edge of Heaven\" was released in North America and Japan), plus a sell-out concert at Wembley Stadium that included the world premiere of the China film. The Wham! partnership ended officially with the commercially successful single \"The Edge of Heaven\", which reached No. 1 on the UK chart in June 1986.\nSolo career.\n1987\u20131989.\nDuring early 1987, at the beginning of his solo career, Michael released \"I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me)\", a duet with Aretha Franklin. \"I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me)\" was a one-off project that helped Michael achieve an ambition by singing with one of his favourite artists. It scored number one on both the UK Singles Chart and the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 upon its release. For Michael, it became his third consecutive solo number one in the UK from three releases, after 1984's \"Careless Whisper\" (though the single was actually from the Wham! album \"Make It Big\") and 1986's \"A Different Corner\". The single was also the first Michael had recorded as a solo artist which he had not written himself. The co-writer, Simon Climie, was unknown at the time; he later had success as a performer with the band Climie Fisher in 1988. Michael and Franklin won a Grammy Award in 1988 for Best R&amp;B Performance \u2013 Duo or Group with Vocal for the song.\nIn late 1987, Michael released his debut solo album, \"Faith\". The first single released from the album was \"I Want Your Sex\", in mid-1987. The song was banned by many radio stations in the UK and US, due to its sexually suggestive lyrics. MTV broadcast the video, featuring celebrity make-up artist Kathy Jeung in a basque and suspenders, only during the late night hours. Michael argued that the act was beautiful if the sex was monogamous, and he recorded a brief prologue for the video in which he said: \"This song is not about casual sex.\" One of the racier scenes involved Michael writing the words \"explore monogamy\" on his partner's back in lipstick. Some radio stations played a toned-down version of the song, \"I Want Your Love\", with the word \"love\" replacing \"sex\".&lt;ref name=\"sex/love\"&gt;https:// Total 80s Remix, 22 February 1999. Retrieved 21 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;\nWhen \"I Want Your Sex\" reached the US charts, \"American Top 40\" host Casey Kasem refused to say the song's title, referring to it only as \"the new single by George Michael.\" In the US, the song was also sometimes listed as \"I Want Your Sex (from \"Beverly Hills Cop II\")\", since the song was featured on the soundtrack of the movie. Despite censorship and radio play problems, \"I Want Your Sex\" reached No. 2 on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and No. 3 in the UK. The second single, \"Faith\", was released in October 1987, a few weeks before the album. \"Faith\" became one of his most popular songs. The song was No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 for four consecutive weeks, becoming the best-selling single of 1988 in the US. It also reached No. 1 in Australia, and No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart. The video provided some definitive images of the 1980s music industry in the process\u2014Michael in shades, leather jacket, cowboy boots, and Levi's jeans, playing a guitar near a classic-design jukebox.\nOn 30 October, \"Faith\" was released in the UK and in several markets worldwide. \"Faith\" topped the UK Albums Chart, and in the US, the album had 51 non-consecutive weeks in the top 10 of \"Billboard\" 200, including 12 weeks at No. 1. \"Faith\" had many successes, with four singles (\"Faith\", \"Father Figure\", \"One More Try\", and \"Monkey\") reaching No. 1 in the US. \"Faith\" was certified Diamond by the RIAA for sales of 10\u00a0million copies in the US. To date, global sales of \"Faith\" are more than 25\u00a0million units. The album was highly acclaimed by music critics, with AllMusic journalist Steve Huey describing it as a \"superbly crafted mainstream pop/rock masterpiece\" and \"one of the finest pop albums of the '80s\". In a review by \"Rolling Stone\" magazine, journalist Mark Coleman commended most of the songs on the album, which he said \"displays Michael's intuitive understanding of pop music and his increasingly intelligent use of his power to communicate to an ever-growing audience.\"\nIn 1988, Michael embarked on a world tour. In Los Angeles, Michael was joined on stage by Aretha Franklin for \"I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me)\". It was the second highest grossing event of 1988, earning $17.7\u00a0million. At the 1988 Brit Awards held at the Royal Albert Hall on 8 February, Michael received the first of his two awards for Best British Male Solo Artist. \"Faith\" won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year at the 31st Grammy Awards, held on 22 February 1989. At the 1989 MTV Video Music Awards on 6 September in Los Angeles, Michael received the Video Vanguard Award. According to Michael in his film, \"A Different Story\", success did not make him happy and he started to think there was something wrong in being an idol for millions of teenage girls. The whole \"Faith\" process (promotion, videos, tour, awards) left him exhausted, lonely and frustrated, and far from his friends and family. In 1990, he told his record company Sony that, for his second album, he did not want to do promotions like the one for \"Faith\".\n1990s.\n\"Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1\" was released in September 1990. The title is an indication of his desire to be taken more seriously as a songwriter. The album was released in Europe on 3 September 1990, and one week later in the US. It reached No. 1 in the UK Albums Chart and peaked at No. 2 on the US \"Billboard\" 200. It spent a total of 88 weeks on the UK Albums Chart and was certified four-times Platinum by the BPI. The album produced five UK singles, all of which were released within an eight-month period: \"Praying for Time\", \"Waiting for That Day\", \"Freedom! '90\", \"Heal the Pain\", and \"Cowboys and Angels\" (the latter being his only single not to chart in the UK top 40). Michael refused to do any promotion for the album. At the 1991 Brit Awards, \"Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1\" won the award for Best British Album.\nThe album's first single, \"Praying for Time\", with lyrics concerning social ills and injustice, was released in August 1990. James Hunter of \"Rolling Stone\" magazine described the song as \"a distraught look at the world's astounding woundedness. Michael offers the healing passage of time as the only balm for physical and emotional hunger, poverty, hypocrisy, and hatred.\" The song was an instant success, reaching No. 1 on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and No. 6 in the UK. A video was released shortly thereafter, consisting of the lyrics on a dark background. Michael did not appear in this video or any subsequent videos for the album. The second single from \"Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1\", \"Waiting for That Day\", was an acoustic-heavy single, released as an immediate follow-up to \"Praying for Time\".\n\"Freedom! '90\" was the second of only two singles from \"Listen Without Prejudice\" to be supported by a music video (the other being the Michael-less \"Praying for Time\"). The song alludes to his struggles with his artistic identity, and prophesied his efforts shortly thereafter to end his recording contract with Sony Music. As if to prove the song's sentiment, Michael refused to appear in the video (directed by David Fincher), and instead recruited supermodels Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, Christy Turlington, Tatjana Patitz, and Cindy Crawford to appear in and lip sync in his stead. It also featured lyrics critical of his sex symbol status. It reached No. 8 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 in the US, and No. 28 on the UK Singles Chart. \"Mother's Pride\" gained significant radio play in the US during the first Persian Gulf War during 1991, often with radio stations mixing in callers' tributes to soldiers with the music.\nIn 1991, Michael embarked on the Cover to Cover tour in Japan, England, the US, and Brazil, where he performed at Rock in Rio. The tour was not a proper promotion for \"Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1\". Rather, it featured Michael singing his favourite cover songs. Among his favourites was \"Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me\", a 1974 song by Elton John; Michael and John had performed the song together at the Live Aid concert in 1985, and again for Michael's concert at London's Wembley Arena on 25 March 1991, where the duet was recorded. \"Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me\" was released as a single at the end of 1991 and reached No. 1 in both the UK and US. In 1991, Michael released an autobiography through Penguin Books titled \"Bare\", co-written with Tony Parsons.\nAn expected follow-up album, \"Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 2\", was scrapped due to Michael's lawsuit with Sony. Instead, Michael donated three songs to the charity project \"Red Hot + Dance\", for the Red Hot Organization which raised money for AIDS awareness; a fourth track, \"Crazyman Dance\", was the B-side of 1992's \"Too Funky\". Michael donated the royalties from \"Too Funky\" to the same cause. \"Too Funky\" reached No. 4 on the UK Singles Chart and No. 10 on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"George Michael was the best. There's a certain note in his voice when he did 'Somebody to Love' that was pure Freddie.\"\n\u2014Queen guitarist Brian May on Michael's performance at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert.\nMichael performed with Queen at The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert on 20 April 1992 at Wembley Stadium. The concert was a tribute to the life of the late Queen frontman, Freddie Mercury, with the proceeds going to AIDS research. Michael performed \"'39\", \"These Are the Days of Our Lives\" with Lisa Stansfield and \"Somebody to Love\". Michael's performance of \"Somebody to Love\" was hailed as \"one of the best performances of the tribute concert\". Michael later reflected, \"It was probably the proudest moment for me of my career, because it was me living out a childhood fantasy, I suppose, to sing one of Freddie's songs in front of 80,000 people.\"\nThe \"Five Live\" EP featured five live recordings (six in several countries) performed by Michael, Queen, and Lisa Stansfield. \"Somebody to Love\" and \"These Are the Days of Our Lives\" were recorded at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert. \"Killer\", \"Papa Was a Rollin' Stone\", and \"Calling You\" were recorded during his Cover to Cover tour in 1991.\nAll proceeds from the sale of the EP benefited the Mercury Phoenix Trust. Sales of the EP were strong through Europe, where it debuted at No. 1 in the UK and several European countries. Chart success in the US was less spectacular, where it reached No. 40 on the \"Billboard\" 200 (\"Somebody to Love\" reached No. 30 on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100). The performance would later feature on Queen's compilation album \"Greatest Hits III\".\nDuring November 1994, after a long period of seclusion, Michael appeared at the first MTV Europe Music Awards show, where he gave a performance of a new song, \"Jesus to a Child\". The song was a melancholy tribute to his lover, Anselmo Feleppa, who had died in March 1993. The song entered the UK Singles Chart at No. 1 and No. 7 on \"Billboard\" upon release in 1996. It was Michael's longest UK Top 40 single, at almost seven minutes long. The exact identity of the song's subject\u2014and the nature of Michael's relationship with Feleppa\u2014was shrouded in innuendo and speculation, as Michael had not confirmed he was homosexual and did not do so until 1998. The video for \"Jesus to a Child\" was a picture of images recalling loss, pain and suffering. Michael consistently dedicated the song to Feleppa before performing it live.\nMichael released \"Fastlove\", an energetic tune about wanting gratification and fulfilment without commitment, in 1996. The single version was nearly five minutes long. \"Fastlove\" was supported by a futuristic virtual reality-related video. The single reached No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart, spending three weeks at the top spot. In the US, \"Fastlove\" peaked at No. 8. Following \"Fastlove\", Michael released \"Older\", his third studio album. In the UK, the album was particularly notable for producing a record six top three hit singles in a two-year span.\nIn 1996, Michael was voted Best British Male at the MTV Europe Music Awards and the Brit Awards; and at the British Academy's Ivor Novello Awards, he was awarded the title of Songwriter of the Year for the third time. Michael performed a concert at Three Mills Studios, London, for \"MTV Unplugged\". It was his first long performance in years, and in the audience was Michael's mother, who died of cancer the following year.\n\"\" (1998) was Michael's first solo greatest hits collection. The collection of 28 songs (29 songs are included on the European and Australian release) are separated into two-halves, with each containing a particular theme and mood. The first CD, titled \"For the Heart\", predominantly contains ballads; the second CD, \"For the Feet\", consists mainly of dance tunes. It was released through Sony Music Entertainment as a condition of severing contractual ties with the label. \"Ladies &amp; Gentlemen\" was a success, peaking at No. 1 on the UK Albums Chart for eight weeks. It spent over 200 weeks in the UK chart, and is the 45th best-selling album ever in the UK. It is certified seven-times platinum in the UK and multi-platinum in the US, and is Michael's most commercially successful album in his homeland, having sold more than 2.8\u00a0million copies. As of 2013, the album had reached worldwide sales of approximately 15\u00a0million copies. The first single of the album, \"Outside\", was a humorous song making a reference to his arrest for soliciting a policeman in a public toilet. \"As\", his duet with Mary J. Blige, was released as the second single in many territories around the world. Both singles reached the top 5 in the UK Singles Chart.\nReleased in 1999, \"Songs from the Last Century\" is a studio album of cover tracks. The album achieved the lowest peak of his solo efforts, peaking at No. 157 on the American \"Billboard\" 200 albums chart and at No. 2 in the UK Albums Chart.\n2000s.\nIn 2000, Michael worked on the hit single \"If I Told You That\" with Whitney Houston. Michael co-produced on the single along with Rodney Jerkins. Michael's first single from his fifth studio album, \"Freeek!\", reached the Top 10 in the UK. His next single was \"Shoot the Dog\" which was released in July 2002 during the lead-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The video for the song showed Tony Blair as George Bush's poodle. The single's cover featured the \"Daily Mirror's\" \"Howdy Poodle\" front page from earlier in the year. Responding to criticism, Michael said, \"I am British, I live here, I pay my taxes, and I'm very, very worried that we are now the second most dangerous country in the world thanks to our special relationship with America.\" It reached No. 1 in Denmark and made the top 5 in most European charts. It peaked at No. 12 on the UK Singles Chart.\nIn February 2003, Michael recorded another song in protest against the looming Iraq war, Don McLean's \"The Grave\". The original was written by McLean in 1971 and was a protest against the Vietnam War. Michael performed the song on numerous TV shows including \"Top of the Pops\" and \"So Graham Norton\". His performance of the song on \"Top of the Pops\" on 7 March 2003 was his first studio appearance on the programme since 1986. He ran into conflict with the show's producers for an anti-war, anti-Blair T-shirt worn by some members of his band. McLean stated that he was \"proud of George Michael for standing up for life and sanity\".\nWhen Michael's fifth studio album, \"Patience\", was released in 2004, it was critically acclaimed and went to No. 1 on the UK Albums Chart. The album became one of the fastest-selling albums in the UK, selling over 200,000 copies in the first week alone. It reached the Top 5 on most European charts and peaked at No. 12 in the US, selling over 500,000 copies to earn a Gold certification from the RIAA. \"Amazing\", the third single from the album, became a No. 1 hit in Europe. When Michael appeared on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" on 26 May 2004, to promote the album, he performed \"Amazing\", along with his classic songs \"Father Figure\" and \"Faith\". On the show, Michael spoke of his arrest, the public revelation of his homosexuality, and his resumption of public performances. He allowed Oprah's crew inside his home outside London. The fourth single taken off the album was \"Flawless\". It was a dance hit in Europe as well as North America, reaching No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" Hot Dance Club Play and becoming Michael's last No. 1 single on the US Dance chart. \"Twenty Five\" is Michael's second greatest hits album, celebrating the 25th anniversary of his music career. Released in November 2006 by Sony BMG, it debuted at no. 1 in the UK.\nDuring the 2005 Live 8 concert at Hyde Park, London, Michael joined Paul McCartney on stage, harmonising on The Beatles classic \"Drive My Car\". In 2006, Michael embarked on his first tour in 15 years, 25 Live. The tour began in Barcelona, Spain, on 23 September and finished in December at Wembley Arena in England. On 9 June 2007, Michael became the first artist to perform live at the newly renovated Wembley Stadium in London. On 25 March 2008, a third part of the 25 Live Tour was announced for North America, with 21 dates in the US and Canada.\nMichael made his American acting debut by playing a guardian angel to Jonny Lee Miller's character on \"Eli Stone\", a US TV series. Each episode of the show's first season was named after a song of his. Michael also appeared on the 2008 finale show of \"American Idol\" on 21 May, singing \"Praying for Time\". When asked what he thought Simon Cowell would say of his performance, he replied \"I think he'll probably tell me I shouldn't have done a George Michael song. He's told plenty of people that in the past, so I think that'd be quite funny.\" On 25 December 2008, Michael released a new Christmas-themed track, \"December Song (I Dreamed of Christmas)\", on his website for free.\n2010s.\nIn early 2010, Michael performed his first concerts in Australia since 1988. On 20 February 2010, Michael performed his first show in Perth at the Burswood Dome to an audience of 15,000. On 2 March 2011, Michael announced the release of his cover version of New Order's 1987 hit \"True Faith\" in aid of the UK charity telethon Comic Relief. Michael appeared on Comic Relief itself, featuring in the first Carpool Karaoke sketch of James Corden, with the pair singing songs while Corden drove around London. On 15 April 2011, Michael released a cover of Stevie Wonder's 1972 song, \"You and I\", as an MP3 gift to Prince William and Catherine Middleton on the occasion of their wedding on 29 April 2011. Although the MP3 was released for free download, Michael appealed to those who downloaded the track to make a contribution to \"The Prince William &amp; Miss Catherine Middleton Charitable Gift Fund\".\nThe Symphonica Tour began at the Prague State Opera House on 22 August 2011. In October 2011, Michael was announced as one of the final nominees for the Songwriter's Hall of Fame. In November, he had to cancel the remainder of the tour as he became ill with pneumonia in Vienna, Austria, ultimately slipping into a coma.\nIn February 2012, two months after leaving hospital, Michael made a surprise appearance at the 2012 Brit Awards at the O2 Arena in London, where he received a standing ovation, and presented Adele the award for Best British Album. In March, Michael announced that he was healthy and that the Symphonica Tour would resume in autumn. The final concert of the tour\u2014which was also the final concert of Michael's life\u2013was performed at London's Earls Court on 17 October 2012.\n\"Symphonica\" was released on 17 March 2014, and became Michael's seventh solo No. 1 album in the UK, and ninth overall including his Wham! chart-toppers.

On 2 November 2016, Michael's management team announced that a second documentary on his life, entitled \"Freedom\", was set to be released in March 2017. A month after, English songwriter Naughty Boy confirmed plans to collaborate with Michael, for a new song and album. Naughty Boy claimed that the song is \"amazing but [...] bittersweet\". On 7 September 2017 (months after Michael's death), the single \"Fantasy\", featuring Nile Rodgers, was released.\nHaving charted at number two upon its release in 1984 (behind Band Aid's \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" which Michael also performed in), \"Last Christmas\" finally reached number-one in the UK Singles Chart on New Year's Day 2021 (chart week ending date 7 January 2021), more than 36 years after its initial release. Andrew Ridgeley said the chart placing was \"a testament to its timeless appeal and charm\", adding: \"It is a fitting tribute to George's song-writing genius... he would have been immensely proud and utterly thrilled.\" The period of 36 years taken to reach number one was a UK chart record, which would be surpassed by Kate Bush with \"Running Up That Hill\" in June 2022 which took 37 years. \"Last Christmas\" would become the UK Christmas number one for the first time in 2023, and it hit number one again at Christmas in 2024, making it the first song to top the Christmas chart in consecutive years, and become only the third song to top the festive chart more than once after Queen's \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" and \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\".\nPosthumous releases.\nOn 7 September 2017, Michael's estate released the single \"Fantasy\". Written and produced by Michael, it was recorded while he was working on \"Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1\". However, the track was not included on the album.

On 18 October 2017, a music video was released on Vevo.\nIn 2019, the Emma Thompson-written film \"Last Christmas\" was released. The title of the film is taken from the Wham! classic. An official soundtrack album was released by Legacy Recordings on CD, two-disc vinyl, and digital formats on 8 November 2019. The album contains 14 Wham! and solo George Michael songs, as well as a previously unreleased song originally completed in 2015 titled \"This Is How (We Want You to Get High)\". The soundtrack album debuted at number one on the UK Official Soundtrack Albums Chart and at number 11 on the UK Albums Chart on 15 November 2019. It also entered the Australian Albums Chart at number seven, the Irish Albums Chart, where it debuted at number 32, climbing to number 26 the following week, and at number 55 on the US \"Billboard\" 200.\nOn 22 June 2022, the documentary film \"Freedom Uncut\" was released. Michael had been working on the film shortly before his death, alongside David Austin, and provides the narration throughout. \"NME\", \"The Guardian\" and \"Empire\" all praised the film and rated it 4/5 stars. On 30 September 2022, a remastered and expanded version of \"Older\" was released comprising the original \"Older\" album, the \"Upper\" disc and three bonus CDs, containing remixes and live recordings of \"Older\"-era tracks. The album charted at number 2 on the UK Official Albums Chart Top 100 on 7 October 2022.\nPersonal life.\nSexuality and relationships.\nMichael stated that his early fantasies were about women, which \"led me to believe I was on the path to heterosexuality\", but at puberty he started to fantasise about men, which he later said \"had something to do with my environment\". At the age of 19, Michael told Andrew Ridgeley that he was bisexual. Michael also told one of his two sisters, but he was advised not to tell his parents about his sexuality. In 1998, not long after he was outed for his sexuality, Michael said on \"Parkinson\" that he became confident he was gay when he fell in love with a man. This stance was reiterated in a 1999 interview with \"The Advocate\", where Michael told the editor-in-chief, Judy Wieder, that it was \"falling in love with a man that ended his conflict over bisexuality\".\n\"I never had a moral problem with being gay\", Michael told her. \"I thought I had fallen in love with a woman a couple of times. Then I fell in love with a man, and realised that none of those things had been love.\"\nIn 2004, Michael said, \"I used to sleep with women quite a lot in the Wham! days but never felt it could develop into a relationship because I knew that, emotionally, I was a gay man. I didn't want to commit to them, but I was attracted to them. Then I became ashamed that I might be using them. I decided I had to stop, which I did when I began to worry about AIDS, which was becoming prevalent in Britain. Although I had always had safe sex, I didn't want to sleep with a woman without telling her I was bisexual. I felt that would be irresponsible. Basically, I didn't want to have that uncomfortable conversation that might ruin the moment, so I stopped sleeping with them.\" In the same interview, he added: \"If I wasn't with Kenny [his boyfriend at the time], I would have sex with women, no question\". He said he believed that the formation of his sexuality was \"a nurture thing, via the absence of my father who was always busy working. It meant I was exceptionally close to my mother\", though he stated that \"there are definitely those who have a predisposition to being gay in which the environment is irrelevant.\" In 2007, Michael said he had hidden his sexuality because of worries over what effect it might have on his mother. Two years later, he added: \"My depression at the end of Wham! was because I was beginning to realise I was gay, not bisexual.\"\nDuring the late 1980s, Michael had a relationship with make-up artist Kathy Jeung, who was regarded for a time as his artistic \"muse\" and who appeared in the \"I Want Your Sex\" video. Michael later said that she had been his \"only bona fide\" girlfriend, and that she knew of his bisexuality. In 2016, Jeung reacted to Michael's death by calling him a \"true friend\" with whom she had spent \"some of the best time of [her] life\".\nIn 1991, Michael established a relationship with Anselmo Feleppa, a Brazilian dress designer whom he had met at the Rock in Rio concert in January that year. Six months into their relationship, Feleppa discovered that he was HIV-positive. Michael later said: \"It was terrifying news. I thought I could have the disease too. I couldn't go through it with my family because I didn't know how to share it with them \u2013 they didn't even know I was gay.\" In 1993, Feleppa died of an AIDS-related brain haemorrhage. Michael's single, \"Jesus to a Child\", is a tribute to Feleppa (Michael consistently dedicated it to him before performing it live), as is his album \"Older\" (1996). In 2008, speaking about the loss of Feleppa, Michael said: \"It was a terribly depressing time. It took about three years to grieve, then after that I lost my mother. I felt almost like I was cursed.\"\nIn 1996, Michael entered into a long-term relationship with Kenny Goss, a former flight attendant, cheerleading coach, and sportswear executive from Dallas, Texas. They had a home in Dallas, a 16th-century house in Goring-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, and an \u00a38\u00a0million mansion in Highgate, North London. In late November 2005, it was reported that Michael and Goss planned to register their relationship as a civil partnership in the UK, but because of negative publicity and his upcoming tour, they postponed their plans. On 22 August 2011, the opening night of his Symphonica Tour, Michael announced that he and Goss had split two years earlier.\nMichael's homosexuality became publicly known following his April 1998 arrest for public lewdness. In 2007, Michael said \"that hiding his sexuality made him feel 'fraudulent', and his eventual outing, when he was arrested [...] in 1998, was a subconsciously deliberate act.\" In 2012, Michael entered a relationship with Fadi Fawaz, a Lebanese-Australian celebrity hairstylist and freelance photographer based in London. It was Fawaz who found Michael's body on Christmas morning 2016.\nLegal problems.\nOn 7 April 1998, Michael was arrested for \"engaging in a lewd act\" in a public restroom of the Will Rogers Memorial Park in Beverly Hills, California. Michael was arrested by undercover policeman Marcelo Rodr\u00edguez in a sting operation. In an MTV interview, Michael stated: \"I got followed into the restroom and then this cop\u2014I didn't know it was a cop, obviously\u2014he started playing this game, which I think is called, 'I'll show you mine, you show me yours, and then when you show me yours, I'm going to nick you!'\"\nAfter pleading \"no contest\" to the charge, Michael was fined US$810 and sentenced to 80 hours of community service. Soon afterwards, Michael made a video for his single \"Outside\", which satirised the public toilet incident and featured men dressed as policemen kissing. Rodr\u00edguez claimed that this video \"mocked\" him, and that Michael had slandered him in interviews. In 1999, he brought a US$10\u00a0million court case in California against Michael. The court dismissed the case, but an appellate court reinstated it on 3 December 2002. The court then ruled that Rodr\u00edguez, as a public official, could not legally recover damages for emotional distress.\nOn 23 July 2006, Michael was accused of engaging in anonymous public sex at London's Hampstead Heath. Michael said that his cruising was not a problem in his relationship with his partner Kenny Goss.\nIn February 2006, Michael was arrested for possession of Class C drugs, an incident that he described as \"my own stupid fault, as usual\". He was cautioned by the police and released. In 2007, he pleaded guilty to drug-impaired driving after obstructing the road at traffic lights in Cricklewood in northwest London, and was subsequently banned from driving for two years and sentenced to community service. On 19 September 2008, Michael was arrested in a public convenience in the Hampstead Heath area for possession of Class A and C drugs. He was taken to the police station and cautioned for controlled substance possession.\nIn the early hours of 4 July 2010, Michael was returning from the gay pride parade, when he was spotted on CCTV crashing his car into the front of a Snappy Snaps store in Hampstead, north London, and was arrested on suspicion of being unfit to drive. On 12 August, London's Metropolitan Police said he was \"charged with possession of cannabis and with driving while unfit through drink or drugs\". It was reported that Michael had also been taking the prescription tricyclic antidepressant medication amitriptyline. On 24 August, he pleaded guilty at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court in London after admitting driving under the influence of drugs. On 14 September, at the same court, Michael was sentenced to eight weeks in prison, a fine, and a five-year ban from driving. Michael was released from Highpoint Prison in Suffolk on 11 October, after serving four weeks. In the dent in the shop wall Michael had crashed into, someone wrote the graffito \"Wham!\".\nHealth.\nMichael struggled with substance abuse for many years. He was arrested for drug-related offences in 2006, 2008 and 2010. In September 2007, on BBC Radio 4's \"Desert Island Discs\", Michael said that his cannabis use was a problem; he wished he could smoke less of it and was constantly trying to do so. On 5 December 2009, in an interview with \"The Guardian\", Michael explained he had cut back on cannabis and was smoking only \"seven or eight\" spliffs per day instead of the 25 per day he had formerly smoked. Michael also abused sleeping pills.\nOn 26 October 2011, Michael cancelled a performance at the Royal Albert Hall in London due to a viral infection. On 21 November, Vienna General Hospital admitted Michael after he complained of chest pains while at a hotel two hours before his performance at a venue there for his Symphonica Tour. Michael appeared to be \"in good spirits\" and responded well to treatment following his admission, but on 25 November hospital officials said that his condition had \"worsened overnight\". This development led to cancellations and postponements of Michael's remaining 2011 performances, which had been scheduled mainly for the United Kingdom. Michael was confirmed to have suffered from pneumonia and, until 1 December, was in an intensive care unit; at one point, he was comatose. On 21 December, the hospital discharged him. Michael told the press that he had undergone a tracheotomy, that the staff at the hospital had saved his life, and that he would perform a free concert for them. After waking from the coma, Michael had a temporary West Country English accent, and there was concern he had developed foreign accent syndrome.\nOn 16 May 2013, Michael sustained a head injury in a car accident on the M1 motorway, near St Albans in Hertfordshire and was airlifted to hospital. On 29 May, Michael's publicist confirmed that he had left the hospital and that his injuries were superficial. In 2014, Michael stated that he had refrained from using cannabis for one and one half years. In June 2015, he checked into a drug rehabilitation facility in Switzerland.\nPolitics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;To call us Thatcherite was so simplistic, basically saying that if you've got a deep enough tan and made a bit of money then you've got to be a Thatcherite.\u2014\u200a\nMichael's father was a communist. At the age of fifteen, Michael joined the Young Communist League, under his Greek name. During the time of Margaret Thatcher as the Conservative Prime Minister of the United Kingdom throughout the 1980s, Michael voted Labour. In September 1984, Wham! performed at a benefit concert at London's Royal Festival Hall for the striking UK miners.\nIn 2000, Michael joined Melissa Etheridge, Garth Brooks, Queen Latifah, Pet Shop Boys, and k.d. lang, to perform in Washington, D.C. as part of Equality Rocks, a concert to benefit the Human Rights Campaign, an American LGBTQ rights group. His 2002 single \"Shoot the Dog\" was critical of the friendly relationship between the UK and US governments, in particular the relationship between Tony Blair and George W. Bush, with their involvement in the war on terror. Michael voiced his concern about the lack of public consultation in the UK regarding the war on terror: \"On an issue as enormous as the possible bombing of Iraq, how can you represent us when you haven't asked us what we think?\"\nIn 2006, Michael performed a free concert for NHS nurses in London to thank the nurses who had cared for his late mother. He told the audience: \"Thank you for everything you do \u2014 some people appreciate it. Now if we can only get the government to do the same thing.\"\nIn 2007, Michael sent the \u00a31,450,000 piano that John Lennon used to write \"Imagine\" around the United States on a \"peace tour\", displaying at places where notable acts of violence had taken place, such as Dallas' Dealey Plaza, where US President John F. Kennedy had been shot. He devoted his 2007 concert in Sofia, from his 25 Live tour to the Bulgarian nurses prosecuted in the HIV trial in Libya. On 17 June 2008, Michael said he was thrilled by California's legalisation of same-sex marriage, calling the move \"way overdue\".\nPhilanthropy.\nIn November 1984, Michael joined other British and Irish pop stars of the era to form Band Aid, singing on the charity song \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" for famine relief in Ethiopia. This single became the UK Christmas number one in December 1984, holding Michael's own song, \"Last Christmas\" by Wham!, at No. 2. \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" sold 3.75\u00a0million copies in the UK and became the biggest-selling single in UK chart history, a title it held until 1997 when it was overtaken by Elton John's \"Candle in the Wind 1997\", released in tribute to Princess Diana following her death (Michael attended Diana's funeral with Elton John). Michael donated the royalties from \"Last Christmas\" to Band Aid and subsequently sang with Elton John at Live Aid (the Band Aid charity concert) in 1985.\nIn 1986, Michael took part in the Prince's Trust charity concert held at Wembley Arena, performing \"Everytime You Go Away\" alongside Paul Young. In 1988, Michael participated in the Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute at Wembley Stadium in London together with many other singers (such as Annie Lennox and Sting), performing \"Sexual Healing\".\nMichael was a staunch supporter of the UK's National Health Service (NHS). In 2006, to thank the nurses who had cared for his mother before her death from cancer in 1997, he held a special free concert exclusively for NHS nurses at the Roundhouse in North London. He would also often set aside tickets for NHS staff at his other concerts.\nAn LGBTQ rights campaigner and HIV/AIDS charity fundraiser, the proceeds from the 1991 single \"Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me\" were divided among 10 different charities for children, AIDS and education. He was also a patron of the Elton John AIDS Foundation. Michael wore a red ribbon at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert at Wembley Stadium in April 1992. He was instrumental in bringing the compilation CD \"Red Hot + Dance\" to fruition, contributing three original songs, with the album featuring Seal and Madonna among others.\nIn 2003, he paired up with Ronan Keating on the UK edition of the game show \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\" and won \u00a332,000, after having their original \u00a364,000 winnings halved by answering the \u00a3125,000 question incorrectly. The same year, Michael joined other celebrities to support a campaign to help raise \u00a320\u00a0million for terminally ill children run by the Rainbow Trust Children's Charity of which he was a patron. He said: \"Loss is such an incredibly difficult thing. I bow down to people who actually have to deal with the loss of a child.\"\nFrom 2005 until his death, Michael was a patron of the Swan Lifeline charity. At the time he had moved to his home in Highgate, the river at the end of his garden was occupied by swans. A neighbour, who was involved with the charity, asked him if he would be interested, and he immediately agreed.\nFollowing Michael's death, various charities revealed that Michael had privately supported them for many years. It was revealed that he had donated all the royalties from his 1996 number one single, \"Jesus to a Child\", to Childline. The charity's founder, Esther Rantzen, said that Michael had given them \"millions\" over the years and was determined that no one outside the charity should know \"how much he gave to the nation's most vulnerable children\". Other charities he supported included the Terrence Higgins Trust and Macmillan Cancer Support. It also emerged that he had volunteered anonymously at a homeless shelter, and had asked the other volunteers to keep his work there a secret.\nMichael also donated to individuals: he reportedly called the production team of the quiz show \"Deal or No Deal\" after a contestant had revealed that she needed \u00a315,000 to fund IVF treatment and anonymously paid for the treatment. Michael once tipped a student nurse working as a barmaid \u00a35,000 because she was in debt. On 3 January 2017, another woman came forward and (with the permission of Michael's family) revealed he had anonymously paid for her IVF treatment after seeing her talk about her problems conceiving on an episode of \"This Morning\" in 2010. The woman gave birth to a girl in 2012.\nAfter his death, it was also revealed that Michael had been anonymously paying for an annual Christmas tree erected where he lived in Highgate, as well as funding the Christmas lights, for the previous decade. He was also the largest funder of Highgate's annual Fair in the Square for those ten years, donating anonymously as \"a local resident\".\nAssets.\nBetween 2006 and 2008, according to reports, Michael earned \u00a348.5\u00a0million from the 25 Live tour alone. In July 2014, he was reported to have been a celebrity investor in a tax avoidance scheme called Liberty. According to the \"Sunday Times\" Rich List 2015 of the wealthiest British musicians, Michael was worth \u00a3105\u00a0million.\nDeath.\nIn the early hours of Christmas Day 2016, Michael died in bed at his home in Goring-on-Thames, at the age of 53. He was found by his partner, Fadi Fawaz. In March 2017, a senior coroner in Oxfordshire attributed Michael's death to natural causes due to dilated cardiomyopathy with myocarditis and fatty liver disease.\nOwing to the delay in determining the cause of death, Michael's funeral was held on 29 March 2017. In a private ceremony, he was buried at Highgate Cemetery in north London, on one side of his mother's grave. His sister Melanie, who died after him three years to the day, is buried on the other side.\nAftermath.\nIn the summer of 2017, a temporary informal memorial garden was created outside Michael's former home in The Grove, Highgate. The site, in a private square that Michael had owned, was tended by fans for approximately eighteen months until it was cleared.\nIn March 2019, Michael's art collection was auctioned in England for \u00a311.3\u00a0million. The proceeds were donated to various philanthropic organisations Michael gave to while he was alive.\nMichael's will left most of his \u00a397\u00a0million estate to his sisters, his father and friends. It did not include bequests to either Fawaz or to his former partner, Kenny Goss. In 2021, following legal proceedings, the trustees of Michael's estate entered into a financial settlement with Goss.\nTributes.\nElton John was among those who paid tribute to Michael, emotionally addressing the audience on the Las Vegas Strip on 28 December, \"What a singer, what a songwriter. But more than anything as a human being he was one of the kindest, sweetest, most generous people I've ever met.\"\nAt the 59th Annual Grammy Awards on 12 February 2017, Adele performed a slow version of \"Fastlove\" in tribute to Michael. On 22 February, Coldplay lead singer Chris Martin performed \"A Different Corner\" at the 2017 Brit Awards. In June, Michael's close friend, former Spice Girls member Geri Halliwell, released a charity single, \"Angels in Chains\", a tribute to him, to raise money for Childline.\nIn 2020, Michael was commemorated with a mural in his native borough of Brent. The artwork, which formed part of the Brent Biennial, was commissioned to pay tribute to his contribution to the fields of music and entertainment. Artist Dawn Mellor said it celebrates Michael as a pioneering cultural and LGBTQ figure. In February 2024, the Royal Mint unveiled a collectable coin featuring Michael wearing his trademark sunglasses.\nAwards and achievements.\nMichael won numerous music awards throughout his 30-year career, including five Brit Awards\u2014winning Best British Male Artist twice, four MTV Video Music Awards, six Ivor Novello Awards, four American Music Awards (including two in the traditionally-black Soul/R&amp;B category), and two Grammy Awards from eight nominations. In 2015, he was ranked 45th in \"Billboard\"'s list of the \"Greatest Hot 100 Artists of All Time\". The Radio Academy stated that Michael was the most frequently played artist on British radio during the period 1984\u20132004. In 2019, Michael was named as the greatest artist of all time by Smooth Radio.\nIn 2023, Michael was nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. On 3 May 2023, Michael was selected as an inductee to the 2023 class alongside Kate Bush, Willie Nelson, The Spinners, Missy Elliott and Rage Against the Machine. In November 2023, Michael was inducted into the Hall, with Andrew Ridgeley as his induction presenter.\nDiscography and record sales.\nAt the time of his death, Michael was estimated to have sold between 100 million and 125\u00a0million records worldwide. As a solo artist, he is estimated to have sold over 100 million records, making him one of the best-selling music artists. He is estimated to have sold up to 30 million records with Wham!. His debut solo album \"Faith\" sold more than 25 million copies.\nSolo discography\nWham! discography\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Buildings come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and functions, and have been adapted throughout history for numerous factors, from building materials available, to weather conditions, land prices, ground conditions, specific uses, prestige, and aesthetic reasons. To better understand the concept, see \"Nonbuilding structure\" for contrast. \nBuildings serve several societal needs \u2013 occupancy, primarily as shelter from weather, security, living space, privacy, to store belongings, and to comfortably live and work. A building as a shelter represents a physical separation of the (a place of comfort and safety) from the \"outside\" (a place that may be harsh and harmful at times).\nBuildings have been objects or canvasses of much artistic expression. In recent years, interest in sustainable planning and building practices has become an intentional part of the design process of many new buildings and other structures, usually green buildings.\nDefinition.\nA building is 'a structure that has a roof and walls and stands more or less permanently in one place'; \"there was a three-storey building on the corner\"; \"it was an imposing edifice\". In the broadest interpretation a fence or wall is a building. However, the word \"structure\" is used more broadly than \"building\", to include natural and human-made formations and ones that do not have walls; \"structure\" is more often used for a fence. Sturgis' Dictionary included that \"[building] differs from architecture in excluding all idea of artistic treatment; and it differs from construction in the idea of excluding scientific or highly skillful treatment.\"\n\"Structural height\" in technical usage is the height to the highest architectural detail on the building from street level. Spires and masts may or may not be included in this height, depending on how they are classified. Spires and masts used as antennas are not generally included. The distinction between a low-rise and high-rise building is a matter of debate, but generally three stories or less is considered low-rise.\nHistory.\nThere is clear evidence of homebuilding from around 18,000 BC. Buildings became common during the Neolithic period.\nTypes.\nResidential.\nSingle-family residential buildings are most often called \"houses\" or \"homes\". Multi-family residential buildings containing more than one dwelling unit are called \"duplexes\" or \"apartment buildings\". \"Condominiums\" are apartments that occupants own rather than rent. Houses may be built in pairs (semi-detached) or in terraces, where all but two of the houses have others on either side. Apartments may be built around courtyards or as rectangular blocks surrounded by plots of ground. Houses built as single dwellings may later be divided into apartments or bedsitters, or converted to other uses (e.g., offices or shops). Hotels, especially of the extended-stay variety (apartels), can be classed as residential.\nBuilding types may range from huts to multimillion-dollar high-rise apartment blocks able to house thousands of people. Increasing settlement density in buildings (and smaller distances between buildings) is usually a response to high ground prices resulting from the desire of many people to live close to their places of employment or similar attractors.\nTerms for residential buildings reflect such characteristics as \"function\" (e.g., holiday cottage (vacation home) or timeshare if occupied seasonally); \"size\" (cottage or great house); \"value\" (shack or mansion); \"manner of construction\" (log home or mobile home); \"architectural style\" (castle or Victorian); and \"proximity to geographical features\" (earth shelter, stilt house, houseboat, or floating home). For residents in need of special care or those society considers dangerous enough to deprive of liberty, there are institutions (nursing homes, orphanages, psychiatric hospitals, and prisons) and group housing (barracks and dormitories).\nHistorically, many people lived in communal buildings called longhouses, smaller dwellings called pit-houses, and houses combined with barns, sometimes called housebarns.\nCommon building materials include brick, concrete, stone, and combinations thereof. Buildings are defined to be substantial, permanent structures. Such forms as yurts and motorhomes are therefore considered \"dwellings\" but not \"buildings\".\nCommercial.\nA commercial building is one in which at least one business is based and people do not live. Examples include stores, restaurant, and hotels.\nIndustrial.\nIndustrial buildings are those in which heavy industry is done, such as manufacturing. These edifices include warehouses and factories.\nAgricultural.\nAgricultural buildings are the outbuildings, such as barns located on farms.\nMixed use.\nSome buildings incorporate several or multiple different uses, most commonly commercial and residential.\nComplex.\nSometimes a group of interrelated (and possibly inter-connected) builds are referred to as a complex \u2013 for example, a housing complex, educational complex, hospital complex, etc.\nCreation.\nThe practice of designing, constructing, and operating buildings is generally a collective effort of different groups of professionals and trades. Depending on the size, complexity, and purpose of a particular building project, the project team may include:\nRegardless of their size or intended use, all buildings in the US must comply with zoning ordinances, building codes, and other regulations such as fire codes, life safety codes, and related standards.\nVehicles\u2014such as trailers, caravans, ships, and passenger aircraft\u2014are treated as \"buildings\" for life safety purposes.\nBuilding services.\nPhysical plant.\nAny building requires a certain general amount of internal infrastructure to function, which includes such elements like heating / cooling, power and telecommunications, water and wastewater etc. Especially in commercial buildings (such as offices or factories), these can be extremely intricate systems taking up large amounts of space (sometimes located in separate areas or double floors / false ceilings) and constitute a big part of the regular maintenance required.\nConveying systems.\nSystems for transport of people within buildings:\nSystems for transport of people between interconnected buildings:\nBuilding damage.\nBuildings may be damaged during construction or during maintenance. They may be damaged by accidents involving storms, explosions, subsidence caused by mining, water withdrawal or poor foundations and landslides. Buildings may suffer fire damage and flooding. They may become dilapidated through lack of proper maintenance, or alteration work improperly carried out.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Designed by McDonnell Douglas and Northrop, the F/A-18 was derived from the YF-17 that lost against the YF-16 in the United States Air Force's lightweight fighter program. The United States Navy selected the YF-17 for the Navy Air Combat Fighter program, further developed the design and renamed it F/A-18; the United States Marine Corps would also adopt the aircraft. The Hornet is also used by the air forces of several other nations, and formerly by the U.S. Navy's Flight Demonstration Squadron, the Blue Angels.\nThe F/A-18 was designed to be a highly versatile aircraft due to its avionics, cockpit displays, and excellent aerodynamic characteristics for high angles-of-attack maneuvers, with the ability to carry a wide variety of weapons. The aircraft can perform fighter escort, fleet air defense, suppression of enemy air defenses, air interdiction, close air support, and aerial reconnaissance. Its versatility and reliability have proven it to be a valuable carrier asset.\nThe Hornet entered operational service with the U.S. Navy in 1983, gradually replacing the A-7 Corsair II and the remaining F-4 Phantom IIs. The aircraft first saw combat action during the 1986 United States bombing of Libya and subsequently participated in the 1991 Gulf War, operations over Bosnia and Kosovo in the 1990s, and in the 2003 Iraq War as well as follow-on operations in the Middle East. The F/A-18 Hornet served as the baseline for the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, its larger, evolutionary redesign, which supplanted both the older Hornet and the F-14 Tomcat in the U.S. Navy. The remaining legacy Navy Hornets were retired in 2019 with the fielding of the F-35C Lightning II.\nDevelopment.\nOrigins.\nThe United States Navy started the Naval Fighter-Attack, Experimental (VFAX) program to procure a multirole aircraft to replace the Douglas A-4 Skyhawk, the A-7 Corsair II, and the remaining McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom IIs, and to complement the Grumman F-14 Tomcat. Vice Admiral Kent Lee, then head of Naval Air Systems Command, was the lead advocate for the VFAX against strong opposition from many Navy officers, including Vice Admiral William D. Houser, deputy chief of naval operations for air warfare \u2013 the highest-ranking naval aviator.\nIn August 1973, Congress mandated that the Navy pursue a lower-cost alternative to the F-14. Grumman proposed a stripped F-14 designated the F-14X, while McDonnell Douglas proposed a naval variant of the F-15, but both were nearly as expensive as the F-14. That summer, Secretary of Defense James R. Schlesinger ordered the Navy to evaluate the competitors in the Air Force's Lightweight Fighter (LWF) program, the General Dynamics YF-16 and Northrop YF-17. The Air Force competition specified a day fighter with no strike capability. In May 1974, the House Armed Services Committee redirected $34\u00a0million from the VFAX to a new program, the Navy Air Combat Fighter (NACF), intended to make maximum use of the technology developed for the LWF program.\nRedesigning the YF-17.\nThough the YF-16 won the LWF competition, the Navy was skeptical that an aircraft with one engine and narrow landing gear could be easily or economically adapted to carrier service, and refused to adopt an F-16 naval derivative \u2013 the Vought Model 1600 \u2013 proposed by Vought/General Dynamics. On 2 May 1975, the Navy announced its selection of the YF-17. Since the LWF did not share the design requirements of the VFAX, the Navy asked McDonnell Douglas and Northrop to develop a new aircraft from the design and principles of the YF-17. On 1 March 1977, Secretary of the Navy W. Graham Claytor announced, that the F-18 would be named \"Hornet\", after the characteristics of the Hornet insect. It also shares the namesake with ships that had borne the name since the Revolutionary War.\nNorthrop had partnered with McDonnell Douglas as a secondary contractor on NACF to capitalize on the latter's experience in building carrier aircraft, including the widely used F-4 Phantom II. On the F-18, the two companies agreed to evenly split component manufacturing, with McDonnell Douglas conducting the final assembly. McDonnell Douglas would build the wings, stabilators, and forward fuselage. While Northrop would build the center and aft fuselage and vertical stabilizers. McDonnell Douglas was the prime contractor for the naval versions, and Northrop would be the prime contractor for the F-18L land-based version which Northrop hoped to sell on the export market.\nThe F-18, initially known as McDonnell Douglas Model 267, was drastically modified from the YF-17. For carrier operations, the airframe, undercarriage, and tailhook were strengthened, folding wings and catapult attachments were added, and the landing gear was widened. Another wheel was added to the front landing gear as well. To meet Navy range and reserves requirements, McDonnell increased fuel capacity by , by enlarging the dorsal spine and adding a 96-gallon fuel tank to each wing. A \"snag\" was added to the wing's leading edge and stabilators to prevent an aeroelastic flutter discovered in the F-15 stabilator. The wings and stabilators were enlarged, the aft fuselage widened by , and the engines canted outward at the front. These changes added to the gross weight, bringing it to . The YF-17's control system was replaced with a fully digital fly-by-wire system with quadruple redundancy, the first to be installed in a production fighter. The airframe was designed for a service life of 6,000 flight hours.\nOriginally, plans were to acquire a total of 780 aircraft of three variants: the single-seat F-18A fighter and A-18A attack aircraft, differing only in avionics, and the dual-seat TF-18A, which retained full mission capability of the F-18 with a reduced fuel load. Following improvements in avionics and multifunction displays, and a redesign of external stores stations, the A-18A and F-18A were able to be combined into one aircraft. Starting in 1980, the aircraft began to be referred to as the F/A-18A, and the designation was officially announced on 1 April 1984. The TF-18A was redesignated F/A-18B.\nNorthrop's F-18L.\nNorthrop developed the F-18L as a potential export aircraft. Since it was not strengthened for carrier service, it was expected to be lighter and better performing, and a strong competitor to the F-16 Fighting Falcon then being offered to American allies. The F-18L's normal gross weight was lighter than the F/A-18A by , via lighter landing gear, lack of wing folding mechanism, reduced part thickness in areas, and lower fuel-carrying capacity. Though the aircraft retained a lightened tailhook, the most obvious external difference was the removal of \"snags\" on the leading edge of the wings and stabilators. It still retained 71% commonality with the F/A-18 by parts weight, and 90% of the high-value systems, including the avionics, radar, and electronic countermeasure suite, though alternatives were offered. Unlike the F/A-18, the F-18L carried no fuel in its wings and lacked weapons stations on the intakes. It had three underwing pylons on each side, instead.\nThe F/A-18L version followed to coincide with the U.S. Navy's F/A-18A as a land-based export alternative. This was essentially an F/A-18A lightened by about ; weight was reduced by removing the folding wing and associated actuators, implementing a simpler landing gear (single wheel nose gear and cantilever oleo main gear), and changing to a land-based tail hook. The revised F/A-18L included wing fuel tanks and fuselage stations of the F/A-18A. Its weapons capacity would increase from , largely due to the addition of a third underwing pylon and strengthened wingtips (11 stations in total vs 9 stations of the F/A-18A). Compared to the F-18L, the outboard weapons pylons are closer to the wingtip missile rails. Because of the strengthened nonfolding wing, the wingtip missile rails were designed to carry either the AIM-7 Sparrow (7F/7M/7P variants, same as the F/A-18A) or Skyflash medium-range air-to-air missiles, in addition to the AIM-9 Sidewinder as found on the F/A-18A. The F/A-18L was strengthened for a 9 g design load factor compared to the F/A-18A's 7.5 g factor.\nThe partnership between McDonnell Douglas and Northrop soured over competition for foreign sales for the two models. Northrop felt that McDonnell Douglas would put the F/A-18 in direct competition with the F-18L. In October 1979, Northrop filed a series of lawsuits charging that McDonnell was using Northrop technology developed for the F-18L for foreign sales of the F/A-18 in violation of their agreement, and asked for a moratorium on foreign sales of the Hornet. McDonnell Douglas countersued, alleging Northrop illegally used F/A-18 technology in its F-20 Tigershark. A settlement was announced 8 April 1985 for all of the lawsuits. McDonnell Douglas paid Northrop $50\u00a0million for \"rights to sell the F/A-18 wherever it could\". Additionally, the companies agreed on McDonnell Douglas as the prime contractor with Northrop as the principal subcontractor. As principal subcontractor, Northrop produced the rear section for the F/A-18 (initially the A/B, then the C/D and eventually also the E/F Super Hornet), while McDonnell Douglas produced the rest with final assembly performed by McDonnell Douglas. At the time of the settlement, Northrop had ceased work on the F-18L. Most export orders for the F-18L were captured by the F-16 or the F/A-18. The F-20 Tigershark did not enter production, and although the program was not officially terminated until 17 November 1986, it was dead by mid-1985.\nInto production.\nDuring flight testing, the snag on the leading edge of the stabilators was filled in, and the gap between the leading-edge extensions (LEX) and the fuselage was mostly filled in. The gaps, called the boundary layer air discharge slots, controlled the vortices generated by the LEX and presented clean air to the vertical stabilizers at high angles of attack, but they also generated a great deal of parasitic drag, worsening the problem of the F/A-18's inadequate range. McDonnell filled in 80% of the gap, leaving a small slot to bleed air from the engine intake. This may have contributed to early problems with fatigue cracks appearing on the vertical stabilizers due to extreme structural loads, resulting in a short grounding in 1984 until the stabilizers were strengthened. Starting in May 1988, a small vertical fence was added to the top of each LEX to broaden the vortices and direct them away from the vertical stabilizers. This also provided a minor increase in controllability as a side effect. F/A-18s of early versions had a problem with insufficient rate of roll, exacerbated by the insufficient wing stiffness, especially with heavy underwing ordnance loads. The first production F/A-18A flew on 12 April 1980. After a production run of 380 F/A-18As (including the nine assigned to flight systems development), manufacture shifted to the F/A-18C in September 1987.\nImprovements and design changes.\nIn the 1990s, the U.S. Navy faced the need to replace its aging A-6 Intruders and A-7 Corsair IIs with no replacement in development. To answer this deficiency, the Navy commissioned development of the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. Despite its designation, it is not just an upgrade of the F/A-18 Hornet, but rather, a new, larger airframe using the design concepts of the Hornet. Hornets and Super Hornets will serve complementary roles in the U.S. Navy carrier fleet until the Hornet A-D models are completely replaced by the F-35C Lightning II. Although the airframe was originally designed for service life of 6,000 flight hours, the Marines have chosen to extend the use of certain F/A-18s up to 10,000 flight hours, due to delays in the F-35B variant.\nEnd of production.\nProduction of the C- and D- models ended in 2000, with the plant transitioning to the F/A-18E/F Super Hornets. The last F/A-18C was assembled in Finland and delivered to the Finnish Air Force in August 2000. The last F/A-18D was delivered to the U.S. Marine Corps in August 2000. Production of the F/A-18E/F is scheduled to end in 2027.\nDesign.\nThe F/A-18 is a twin engine, midwing, multimission tactical aircraft. It is highly maneuverable, due to its good thrust-to-weight ratio, digital fly-by-wire control system, and leading-edge extensions, which allow the Hornet to remain controllable at high angles of attack. The trapezoidal wing has a 20-degree sweepback on the leading edge and a straight trailing edge. The wing has full-span, leading-edge flaps and the trailing edge has single-slotted flaps and ailerons over the entire span.\nCanted vertical stabilizers are another distinguishing design element, one among several other such elements that enable the Hornet's excellent high angle of attack ability, including oversized horizontal stabilators, oversized trailing-edge flaps that operate as flaperons, large full-length leading-edge slats, and flight control computer programming that multiplies the movement of each control surface at low speeds and moves the vertical rudders inboard instead of simply left and right. The Hornet's normally high angle of attack performance envelope was put to rigorous testing and enhanced in the NASA F-18 High Alpha Research Vehicle (HARV). NASA used the F-18 HARV to demonstrate flight handling characteristics at high angle-of-attack (alpha) of 65\u201370 degrees using thrust vectoring vanes. F/A-18 stabilators were also used as canards on NASA's F-15S/MTD.\nThe Hornet was among the first aircraft to heavily use multifunction displays, which at the switch of a button allow a pilot to perform either fighter or attack roles or both. This \"force multiplier\" ability gives the operational commander more flexibility to employ tactical aircraft in a fast-changing battle scenario. It was the first Navy aircraft to incorporate a digital multiplexing avionics bus, enabling easy upgrades.\nThe Hornet was designed to reduce maintenance, and as a result, has required far less downtime than its heavier counterparts, the F-14 Tomcat and the A-6 Intruder. Its mean time between failures is three times greater than any other Navy strike aircraft, and requires half the maintenance time. Its General Electric F404 engines were also innovative in that they were designed with operability, reliability, and maintainability first. The engine, while unexceptional in rated performance, demonstrates exceptional robustness under various conditions and is resistant to stall and flameout. The F404 engine connects to the airframe at only 10 points and can be replaced without special equipment: a four-person team can remove the engine within 20 minutes. The aircraft has a top speed of Mach 1.8 at 40,000\u00a0ft.\nThe engine air inlets of the Hornet, like those of the F-16, are of a simpler \"fixed\" pitot-type design, while those of the F-4, F-14, and F-15 have variable geometry or variable intake ramp air inlets. The fixed-geometry design is simpler, lighter, and less maintenance-intensive than variable geometry inlets, at the expense of pressure recovery performance at higher Mach numbers. This was considered a worthwhile tradeoff as the aircraft was designed to primarily operate at subsonic and transonic speeds.\nA 1989 USMC study found that single-seat fighters were well suited to air-to-air combat missions, while dual-seat fighters were favored for complex strike missions against heavy air and ground defenses in adverse weather\u2014the question being not so much as to whether a second pair of eyes would be useful, but as to having the second crewman sit in the same fighter or in a second fighter. Single-seat fighters that lacked wingmen were shown to be especially vulnerable.\nOperational history.\nUnited States.\nEntry into service.\nMcDonnell Douglas rolled out the first F/A-18A on 13 September 1978, in blue-on-white colors marked with \"Navy\" on the left and \"Marines\" on the right. Its first flight was on 18 November. In a break with tradition, the Navy pioneered the \"principal site concept\" with the F/A-18, where almost all testing was done at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, instead of near the site of manufacture, and using Navy and Marine Corps test pilots instead of civilians early in development. In March 1979, Lt. Cdr. John Padgett became the first Navy pilot to fly the F/A-18.\nFollowing trials and operational testing by VX-4 and VX-5, Hornets began to fill the Fleet Replacement Squadrons VFA-125, VFA-106, and VMFAT-101, where pilots are introduced to the F/A-18. The Hornet entered operational service with Marine Corps squadron VMFA-314 at MCAS El Toro on 7 January 1983, and with Navy squadrons VFA-113 and VFA-25 on 1 July 1984, replacing F-4s and A-7Es, respectively.\nNavy strike-fighter squadrons VFA-25 and VFA-113 (assigned to CVW-14) deployed aboard from February to August 1985, marking the first deployment for the F/A-18.\nThe initial fleet reports were complimentary, indicating that the Hornet was extraordinarily reliable, a major change from its predecessor, the F-4J. In January 1985, the VFA-131 \"Wildcats\" and the VFA-132 \"Privateers\" moved from Naval Air Station Lemoore, California to Naval Air Station Cecil Field, Florida to become the Atlantic Fleet's first F/A-18 squadrons. VFA-151, VFA-161, VFA-192 and VFA-195 transitioned to the F/A-18A in 1986. With the exception of VFA-161, the rest would move to NAF Atsugi, Japan to join CVW-5 and the USS \"Midway\". Other squadrons that switched to F/A-18 included VFA-146 \"Blue Diamonds\", and VFA-147 \"Argonauts\".\nThe U.S. Navy's Blue Angels Flight Demonstration Squadron switched to the F/A-18 Hornet in 1986, replacing the A-4 Skyhawk. The Blue Angels performed in F/A-18A, B, C, and D models at air shows and other special events across the US and worldwide before transitioning to the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet in late 2020. Blue Angels pilots must have 1,250 hours and an aircraft-carrier certification. The two-seat B and D models were typically used to give rides to VIPs, but also filled in for other aircraft, if such a need arose.\nNASA operates several F/A-18 aircraft for research purposes and also as chase aircraft; these F/A-18s are based at the Armstrong Flight Research Center (formerly the Dryden Flight Research Center) in California. NASA received three two-seat F/A-18B aircraft in 2018. On 21 September 2012, two NASA F/A-18s escorted a NASA Boeing 747 Shuttle Carrier Aircraft carrying the Space Shuttle \"Endeavour\" over portions of California to Los Angeles International Airport before being delivered to the California Science Center museum in Los Angeles.\nCombat operations.\nThe F/A-18 first saw combat action in April 1986, when VFA-131, VFA-132, VMFA-314, and VMFA-323 Hornets from flew suppression of enemy air defense (SEAD) missions against Libyan air defenses during Operation Prairie Fire and an attack on Benghazi as part of Operation El Dorado Canyon.\nDuring the Gulf War of 1991, the Navy deployed 106 F/A-18A/C Hornets and Marine Corps deployed 84 F/A-18A/C/D Hornets. F/A-18 pilots were credited with two kills during the Gulf War, both MiG-21s. On 17 January, the first day of the war, U.S. Navy pilots Lieutenant Commander Mark I. Fox and, Lieutenant Nick Mongilio were in a flight of four Hornets when they were sent from in the Red Sea to bomb airfield H-3 in southwestern Iraq. While en route, they were warned by an E-2C of approaching \"Bandits\" or Iraqi MiG-21 aircraft. The Hornets shot down the two MiGs with AIM-7 and AIM-9 missiles in a brief dogfight. Only 40 seconds were needed from when the bandits appeared on the E-2's radar until both aircraft were downed. The F/A-18s, each carrying four bombs, then resumed their bombing run before returning to \"Saratoga\".\nThe Hornet's survivability was demonstrated when a Hornet took hits in both engines and flew back to base. It was repaired and flying within a few days. F/A-18s flew 4,551 sorties with 10 Hornets damaged including three losses, one confirmed lost to enemy fire. All three losses were U.S. Navy F/A-18s, with two of their pilots lost. On 17 January 1991, Lieutenant Commander Scott Speicher of VFA-81 was shot down and killed in the crash of his aircraft. An unclassified summary of a 2001 CIA report suggests that Speicher's aircraft was shot down by a missile fired from an Iraqi Air Force aircraft, most likely a MiG-25.\nOn 24 January 1991, F/A-18A bureau number 163121, from , piloted by Lt H.E. Overs, was lost due to an engine failure or loss of control over the Persian Gulf. The pilot ejected and was recovered by .&lt;ref name=\"The Air Forces Book of the F/A-18 Hornet, 2003\"&gt;\"The Air Forces Book of the F/A-18 Hornet\", p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 February 1991, F/A-18A bureau number 163096, piloted by Lieutenant Robert Dwyer was lost over the North Persian Gulf after a successful mission to Iraq; he was officially listed as killed in action, body not recovered.\nAs the A-6 Intruder was retired in the 1990s, its role was filled by the F/A-18. The F/A-18 demonstrated its versatility and reliability during Operation Desert Storm, shooting down enemy fighters and subsequently bombing enemy targets with the same aircraft on the same mission. It broke records for tactical aircraft in availability, reliability, and maintainability.\nBoth U.S. Navy F/A-18A/C models and Marine F/A-18A/C/D models were used continuously in Operation Southern Watch and over Bosnia and Kosovo in the 1990s. U.S. Navy Hornets flew during Operation Enduring Freedom in 2001 from carriers operating in the North Arabian Sea. Both the F/A-18A/C and newer F/A-18E/F variants were used during Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003, operating from aircraft carriers as well from an air base in Kuwait. Later in the conflict USMC A+, C, and primarily D models operated from bases within Iraq.\nAn F/A-18C was accidentally downed in a friendly fire incident by a Patriot missile when a pilot tried to evade two missiles fired at his plane and crashed. Two others collided over Iraq in May 2005.\nThe last operational deployment of the F/A-18C Hornet in U.S. Navy service was aboard the and ended on 12 March 2018. The aircraft briefly went back to sea for routine carrier qualifications in October, but it was retired from active Navy service on 1 February 2019. The type continued to be used by reserve units, primarily for adversary training. The actual final Navy F/A-18C operational flight occurred on 2 October 2019.\nAs of 2024, The United States Marine Corps operated a fleet of 179 F/A-18C and D Hornets, with plans to keep them operational with upgraded radars and electronics until 2030, when they are scheduled to be fully replaced by the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II.\nNon-U.S. service.\nThe F/A-18 has been purchased and is in operation with several foreign air services. Export Hornets are typically similar to U.S. models of a similar manufacture date. Since none of the customers operate aircraft carriers, all export models have been sold without the automatic carrier landing system, and the Royal Australian Air Force further removed the catapult attachment on the nose gear. Except for Canada, all export customers purchased their Hornets through the U.S. Navy, via the U.S. Foreign Military Sales program, where the Navy acts as the purchasing manager, but incurs no financial gain or loss. Canada is the largest Hornet operator outside of the U.S.\nAustralia.\nThe Royal Australian Air Force purchased 57 F/A-18A fighters and 18 F/A-18B two-seat trainers to replace its Dassault Mirage IIIOs. Numerous options were considered for the replacement, notably the F-15A Eagle, the F-16 Fighting Falcon, and the then new F/A-18 Hornet. The F-15 was discounted because the version offered had no ground-attack capability. The F-16 was considered unsuitable largely due to having only one engine. Australia selected the F/A-18 in October 1981. Original differences between the Australian and U.S. Navy's standard F/A-18 were the removed nose-wheel tie bar for catapult launch (later re-fitted with a dummy version to remove nose wheel shimmy), addition of a high frequency radio, an Australian fatigue data analysis system, an improved video and voice recorder, and the use of instrument landing system/VHF omnidirectional range instead of the carrier landing system.\nThe first two aircraft were produced in the US, with the remainder assembled in Australia at Government Aircraft Factories. F/A-18 deliveries to the RAAF began on 29 October 1984, and continued until May 1990. In 2001, Australia deployed four aircraft to Diego Garcia, in an air-defense role, during coalition operations against the Taliban in Afghanistan. In 2003, 75 Squadron deployed 14 F/A-18s to Qatar as part of Operation Falconer and these aircraft saw action during the invasion of Iraq. Australia had 71 Hornets in service in 2006, after four were lost to crashes.\nThe fleet was upgraded beginning in the late 1990s to extend their service lives to 2015. They were expected to be retired then and replaced by the F-35 Lightning II. Several of the Australian Hornets subsequently had refits applied to extend their service lives out further to a new planned retirement date of 2020. Australia has also purchased 24 F/A-18F Super Hornets, with deliveries beginning in 2010.\nIn March 2015, six F/A-18As from No. 75 Squadron were deployed to the Middle East as part of Operation Okra, replacing a detachment of Super Hornets.\nAustralia has sold 25 F/A-18A/Bs to Canada with first two delivered to RCAF in February 2019. By 2021, 12 (A)F/A-18A and 6 (A)F/A-18B (and an additional 7 disassembled (A)F/A-18 for spare parts) were sold to the RCAF.\nAt Wings Over Illawarra 2021, the Hornet performed its last public flying display before retirement. Australia formally retired the Hornet at RAAF Base Williamtown on 29 November 2021. On 30 November 2021, No. 75 Squadron RAAF flew 7 of the last Hornets from RAAF Base Tindal to RAAF Base Williamtown. On 3 December 2021, the last Hornet left RAAF Base Tindal for decommissioning. Due to inclement weather, the Hornet diverted to RAAF Base Townsville and concluded the final RAAF Hornet flight to RAAF Base Williamtown on 4 December 2021.\nCanada.\nCanada was the first export customer for the Hornet, replacing the Canadair CF-104 Starfighter (air reconnaissance and strike), the McDonnell CF-101 Voodoo (air interception) and the Canadair CF-116 Freedom Fighter (ground attack). The Canadian Forces Air Command ordered 98 A models (Canadian designation CF-188A/CF-18A) and 40 B models (designation CF-188B/CF-18B). The original CF-18 as delivered was nearly identical to the F/A-18A and B models. Many features that made the F/A-18 suitable for naval carrier operations were retained by the Canadian Forces, such as the robust landing gear, the arrestor hook, and wing folding mechanisms.\nIn 1991, Canada committed 26 CF-18s to the Gulf War, based in Qatar. These aircraft primarily provided Combat Air Patrol duties, although, late in the air war, began to perform air strikes on Iraqi ground targets. On 30 January 1991, two CF-18s on CAP detected and attacked an Iraqi TNC-45 patrol boat. The vessel was repeatedly strafed and damaged by 20mm cannon fire, but an attempt to sink the ship with an air-to-air missile failed. The ship was subsequently sunk by American aircraft, but the Canadian CF-18s received partial credit for its destruction.\nIn June 1999, 18 CF-18s were deployed to Aviano AB, Italy, where they participated in both the air-to-ground and air-to-air roles in the former Yugoslavia.\n62 CF-18A and 18 CF-18B aircraft took part in the Incremental Modernization Project which was completed in two phases. The program was launched in 2001 and the last updated aircraft was delivered in March 2010. The aims were to improve air-to-air and air-to-ground combat abilities, upgrade sensors and the defensive suite, and replace the datalinks and communications systems on board the CF-18 from the F/A-18A and F/A-18B standard to the current F/A-18C and F/A-18D standard.\nIn July 2010 the Canadian government announced plans to replace the remaining CF-18 fleet with 65 F-35 Lightning IIs, with deliveries scheduled to start in 2016. In November 2016, Canada announced plans to buy 18 Super Hornets as an interim solution while reviewing its F-35 order. The plan for Super Hornets was later, in October 2017, put on hold due to a trade conflict with the U.S. over the Bombardier C-Series. Instead, Canada was seeking to purchase surplus Hornets from Australia or Kuwait. Canada has since acquired 25 ex-Australian F/A-18A/Bs, the first two of which were delivered in February 2019. 18 of these airframes will be introduced into active service with the remaining 7 to be used for spare parts and testing.\nFinland.\nThe Finnish Air Force ordered 64 F-18C/Ds (57 C models, seven D models) in 1992. The F-18Ds were built at St. Louis, while the F-18Cs were locally assembled in Finland. Delivery of the aircraft started in November 1995 and ended in August 2000. The Hornet replaced the MiG-21bis and Saab 35 Draken in Finnish service. The Finnish Hornets were initially to be used only for air defense, hence the F-18 designation. The F-18C includes the ASPJ (Airborne Self-Protection Jammer) jamming pod ALQ-165. The U.S. Navy later included the ALQ-165 on their F/A-18E/F Super Hornet procurement.\nOne Hornet was destroyed in a mid-air collision in 2001. A damaged F-18C, nicknamed \"Frankenhornet\", was rebuilt into a F-18D using the forward section of a Canadian CF-18B that was purchased. The modified fighter crashed during a test flight in January 2010, due to a faulty tailplane servo cylinder. A third Hornet crashed in Rovaniemi during flight show training in May 2025.\nThe Finnish Air Force's Hornet fleet went through a two-stage Mid-Life Upgrade (MLU) program. From 2006 to 2010, the MLU 1 stage was aimed at improving the aircraft's air-to-air capabilities. It included the integration of the new AIM-9X Sidewinder missile together with the JHMCS helmet-mounted sight, new radios, a new IFF interrogator, and a new moving map display. Then, from 2012 to 2016, the MLU 2 stage was mainly focused at enabling the aircraft to use standoff air-to-ground weapons, including the JDAM, JSOW and JASSM. The Hornets also received the Litening targeting pod. New chaff/flare dispensers were installed. The cockpit was modernized, and Link 16 was added. The upgrade also includes the procurement and integration of a new version of the AIM-120 AMRAAM air-to-air missile. In total, 62 aircraft (the whole Finnish Hornet fleet as of 2016) were modernized to MLU 2 standards. Since this upgrade gave the plane a ground-attack capability, the Finnish Air Force also started to refer to the plane as \"F/A-18\" rather than just \"F-18\".\nWith a service life of 30 years, the Hornets are to remain in active service until 2025\u20132030. In October 2014, the Finnish national broadcaster Yle announced that consideration was being given to the replacement of the Hornet. In 2015, Finland started the HX Fighter Program that aims to acquire new multirole fighters to replace the current Hornet fleet. On 10 December 2021, the Finnish government announced the selection of Lockheed Martin's fifth-generation F-35A Lightning II for its HX Fighter Program. The first Hornet, HN-401, was retired on 26 April 2024.\nKuwait.\nThe Kuwait Air Force (\"Al Quwwat Aj Jawwaiya Al Kuwaitiya\") ordered 32 F/A-18C and eight F/A-18D Hornets in 1988. Delivery started in October 1991 until August 1993. The F/A-18C/Ds replaced A-4KU Skyhawk. Kuwait Air Force Hornets have flown missions over Iraq during Operation Southern Watch in the 1990s. They have also participated in military exercises with the air forces of other Gulf nations. Kuwait had 39 F/A-18C/D Hornets in service in 2008. Kuwait also participated in the Yemeni Civil War (2015\u2013present). In February 2017, the Commander of the Kuwait Air Force revealed that the F/A-18s based at King Khalid Air Base had performed approximately 3,000 sorties over Yemen.\nMalaysia.\nThe Royal Malaysian Air Force (\"Tentera Udara Diraja Malaysia\") has eight F/A-18Ds. Delivery of the aircraft occurred from March to August 1997.\nThree Hornets together with five UK-made BAE Hawk 208 were deployed in a bombing airstrike on the \"Royal Security Forces of the Sultanate of Sulu and North Borneo\" terrorists on 5 March 2013, just before the joint forces of the Malaysian Army and Royal Malaysia Police commandos launched an all-out assault during Operation Daulat. The Hornets were tasked with close air support to the no-fly zone in Lahad Datu, Sabah.\nSpain.\nThe Spanish Air and Space Force (\"Ej\u00e9rcito del Aire y del Espacio\") ordered 60 EF-18A model and 12 EF-18B model Hornets (the \"E\" standing for \"Espa\u00f1a\", Spain), named respectively as C.15 and CE.15 by Spain (the \u201cC\u201d standing for \u201cCaza\u201d, Fighter). The Spanish version was delivered from 22 November 1985 to July 1990. These fighters were upgraded to F-18A+/B+ standard, close to F/A-18C/D (plus version includes later mission and armament computers, databuses, data-storage set, new wiring, pylon modifications and software, new abilities as AN/AAS-38B NITE Hawk targeting FLIR pods).\nIn 1995 Spain obtained 24 ex-USN F/A-18A Hornets, with six more on option. These were delivered from December 1995 until December 1998. Before delivery, they were modified to EF-18A+ standard. This was the first sale of USN surplus Hornets.\nSpanish Hornets operate as an all-weather interceptor 60% of the time and as an all-weather day/night attack aircraft for the remainder. In case of war, each of the frontline squadrons would take a primary role: 121 is tasked with tactical air support and maritime operations; 151 and 122 are assigned to all-weather interception and air combat roles; and 152 is assigned the Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) mission. Air refueling is provided by KC-130Hs and Boeing 707TTs. Pilot conversion to EF-18 is centralized in 153 Squadron (Ala 15). Squadron 462's role is air defense of the Canary Islands, being responsible for fighter and attack missions from Gando AB.\nSpanish Air Force EF-18 Hornets have flown Ground Attack, SEAD, combat air patrol (CAP) combat missions in Bosnia and Kosovo, under NATO command, in Aviano detachment (Italy). They shared the base with Canadian and USMC F/A-18s. Six Spanish Hornets had been lost in accidents by 2003. On 25 May 1995, while taking part of Operation Deny Flight, Spanish EF-18s armed with laser-guided bombs and supported by US F-16s destroyed an ammunition depot at Pale, a Bosnian Serb stronghold in the outskirts of Sarajevo.\nOver Yugoslavia, eight EF-18s, based at Aviano AB, participated in bombing raids in Operation Allied Force in 1999, being among the first planes to strike Yugoslav targets. Over Bosnia, they also performed missions for air-to-air combat air patrol, close air support air-to-ground, photo reconnaissance, forward air controller-airborne, and tactical air controller-airborne. Over Libya, four Spanish Hornets participated in enforcing a no-fly zone.\nSwitzerland.\nThe Swiss Air Force purchased 26 C models and eight D models, they were delivered from January 1996 to December 1999. Three D models and one C model had been lost in crashes as of 2016.&lt;ref name=\"www.lw.admin.ch/\"&gt;http:// \"lw.admin.ch,\" 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 October 2015, an F/A-18D crashed in France during training with two Swiss Air Force Northrop F-5s in the Swiss/French training area EURAC25; the pilot ejected safely.\nDuring late 2007, Switzerland requested to be included in the F/A-18C/D Upgrade 25 Program, to extend the useful life of its F/A-18C/Ds. The program includes significant upgrades to the avionics and mission computer, 12 ATFLIR surveillance and targeting pods, and 44 sets of Raytheon AN/ALR-67(V)3 Advanced Special Receiver ECM equipment. In October 2008, the Swiss Hornet fleet reached the 50,000 flight hour milestone.\nThe Swiss Air Force has also taken delivery of two F/A-18C full-scale mock-ups for use as ground crew interactive training simulators. Locally built by Hugo Wolf AG, they are externally accurate copies and have been registered as Boeing F/A-18C (Hugo Wolf) aircraft with tail numbers X-5098 and X-5099. These include a complex equipment fit, including many original cockpit components and instruments, allowing the simulation of fires, fuel leaks, nosewheel collapse and other emergency scenarios. X-5098 is permanently stationed at Payerne Air Base while X-5099, the first one built, is moved between air bases according to training demands.\nPotential operators.\nIn June 2023, the \"Financial Review\" reported that Australia, the United States and Ukraine were negotiating the supply of 41 Australian F/A-18 Hornet fighter jets to the Ukrainian Air Force. A further update was issued in December 2023, that the U.S. have continued talks with the Australian government and have begun exploring the option of providing aging jets and parts from the Finnish Air Force.\nDuring December 2023 Ukraine asked the US, according to documents viewed by Reuters, for F/A-18 Hornets. The Ukrainian ambassador to Australia is expected to again request surplus Hornets. A report found that 14 of the 41 airframes were airworthy and another two years flying could be \"squeezed\" from them.\nAs of July 2024, Malaysia intends to acquire Kuwaiti legacy F/A-18s as the Kuwaiti Air Force replaces their Hornets with newer Super Hornets and Eurofighter Typhoons. The United States has granted clearance for Kuwaiti F/A-18s to be exported to Malaysia in June 2025. The Royal Malaysian Air Force is set to receive around 30 F/A-18s, consisted of the F/A-18C and F/A-18D variants. A team of eight Royal Malaysian Air Force personnel was send to the Ahmad al-Jaber Air Base in November 2025 to evaluate the Kuwaiti aircraft.\nFailed Bids.\nSeveral Nations considered operating the hornet at various points in time. The F/A-18C and F/A-18D were considered by the French Navy (\"Marine Nationale\") during the 1980s for deployment on their aircraft carriers \"Clemenceau\" and \"Foch\" and again in the 1990s for the later nuclear-powered \"Charles de Gaulle\", in the event that the Dassault Rafale M was not brought into service when originally planned.\nAustria, Chile, Czech Republic, Hungary, Philippines, Poland, and Singapore evaluated the Hornet but did not purchase it. \nThe Imperial Iranian Air Force, as part of its large modernization plans in the 1970s, originally considered the YF-17 but - after the F-16 was chosen by the original NATO partners - chose to buy 160 F-16s. However, after the Navy's request for a naval YF-17, the Shah expressed interest once more in the program and in the end about 200 to 250 F-18Ls were considered with delivery planned for the early to mid 1980s. An additional $8 million was used for research and development into the F/A-18 program. \nSouth Korea originally set out with an ambitious plan to build 120 new fighter jets through its Korean Fighter Program. Although the F/A-18 Hornet was first selected, complications with the deal led to a change in direction. Instead, the country opted for the F-16C/D Block 52D, known locally as the KF-16C/D, with 72 of the jets to be built domestically in South Korea. \nThailand ordered four C and four D model Hornets in 1995\u20131996 for $392 million, with plans for ten additional Hornets. Thailand already paid $74.5 million deposit before the Asian financial crisis in late 1990s hit the country, which resulted in the order being canceled in April 1998. The eight Hornets were completed as F/A-18Ds for the U.S. Marine Corps.\nThe F/A-18A and F-18L land-based version competed for a fighter contract from Greece in the 1980s. The Greek government chose F-16 and Mirage 2000 instead.\nVariants.\nF/A-18A/B Hornet.\nThe \"F/A-18A,\" single-seat variant, can employ the AGM-84 Harpoon, AGM-65E Maverick, AGM-88 HARM and the AGM-62 Walleye I/II. The F/A-18A was also equipped with the AN/AAS-38 Nite Hawk targeting pod and the AN/ASQ-173 laser spot tracker for targeting. During the Gulf War, there were limited numbers of the Nite Hawk for USN and USMC Hornets. The \"F/A-18B\" has space for the two-seat cockpit, provided by a relocation of avionics equipment and a 6% reduction in internal fuel. Two-seat Hornets are otherwise fully combat-capable. The B-model is used primarily for training.\nIn 1992, the original Hughes AN/APG-65 radar was replaced with the Hughes (now Raytheon) AN/APG-73, a faster and more capable radar. A-model Hornets that have been upgraded to the AN/APG-73 and are capable of carrying the AIM-120 AMRAAM are designated F/A-18A+. Later in the 2010s they received life-extending upgrades from the USMC and then became F/A-18A++.\nF/A-18C/D Hornet.\nThe F/A-18C and D models are the result of a block upgrade in 1987 incorporating upgraded radar, avionics, and the capacity to carry new missiles such as the AIM-120 AMRAAM air-to-air missile and later on the AGM-84E SLAM as well as the IR version of the AGM-65 (AGM-65F). Other upgrades include the Martin-Baker NACES (Navy Aircrew Common ejection seat), and a self-protection jammer. A synthetic aperture ground mapping radar enables the pilot to locate targets in poor visibility conditions. C and D models delivered since 1989 also have improved night attack abilities, consisting of the Hughes AN/AAR-50 thermal navigation pod, AN/AAS-38A NITE Hawk FLIR (forward looking infrared array) targeting pod, night vision goggles, and two full-color (formerly monochrome) multi-function display (MFDs) and a color moving map.\nThe \"F/A-18C\" is the single-seat variant and the \"F/A-18D\" is the two-seat variant. The D-model can be configured for training or as an all-weather strike craft. The \"missionized\" D model's rear seat is configured for a Marine Corps naval flight officer who functions as a Weapons and Sensors Officer to assist in operating the weapons systems. The F/A-18D is primarily operated by the U.S. Marine Corps in the night attack and Forward Air Controller (Airborne) (FAC(A)) roles.\nSixty D-model Hornets are configured as the night attack \"F/A-18D (RC)\" with the ability for reconnaissance. These could be outfitted with the ATARS electro-optical sensor package that includes a sensor pod and equipment mounted in the place of the M61 cannon.\nBeginning in 1992, the F404-GE-402 enhanced performance engine, providing approximately 10% more maximum static thrust became the standard Hornet engine. Since 1993, the AAS-38A NITE Hawk added a designator/ranger laser, allowing it to self-mark targets. The later AAS-38B added the ability to strike targets designated by lasers from other aircraft.\nThe U.S. Navy retired its F/A-18C/D in February 2019. However, the USMC still retains theirs, and is in the process of upgrading their radar to APG-79(V)4 Active Electronically Scanned Array radar system. This variant for the USMC with the MLU is called F/A-18C+. These are F/A-18Cs of the Blocks 25 and 30 that are being modernized to the most modern Block 35 and for a longer service life.\nF/A-18E/F Super Hornet.\nThe single-seat \"F/A-18E\" and two-seat \"F/A-18F\", both officially named \"Super Hornet\", carry over the name and design concept of the original F/A-18 but have been extensively redesigned by McDonnell Douglas. The Super Hornet, which began production in 1995, has a new, 25% larger airframe, larger rectangular air intakes, more powerful GE F414 engines based on F/A-18's F404, and an upgraded avionics suite. Like the Marine Corps' F/A-18D, the Navy's F/A-18F carries a naval flight officer as a second crew member in a weapon systems officer role. The Super Hornet is unofficially known as \"Rhino\" in operational use. This name was chosen to distinguish the newer variants from the legacy F-18A/B/C/D Hornet and avoid confusion during carrier deck operations. The Super Hornet is also operated by Australia and Kuwait.\nEA-18G Growler.\nThe EA-18G Growler is an electronic warfare version of the two-seat F/A-18F, which entered production in 2007. The Growler has replaced the Navy's EA-6B Prowler and carries a Naval Flight Officer as a second crewman in an Electronic Warfare Officer (EWO) role. Growlers are used by the United States and Australia.\nExport variants.\n\"These designations are not part of 1962 United States Tri-Service aircraft designation system.\"\n\"F/A-18A\" was the original company designation, designations of \"AF-18A\" &amp; \"ATF-18A\" have also been applied. Assembled in Australia (excluding the first two (A)F/A-18Bs) by Aero-Space Technologies of Australia (ASTA) from 1985 through to 1990, from kits produced by McDonnell Douglas with increasing local content in the later aircraft. Originally the most notable differences between an Australian (A)F/A-18A/B and a US F/A-18A/B were the lack of a catapult attachment, replacing the carrier tailhook with a lighter land arresting hook, and the automatic carrier landing system with an Instrument Landing System. Australian Hornets have been involved in several major upgrade programs. This program called HUG (Hornet Upgrade) has had a few evolutions over the years. The first was to give Australian Hornets F/A-18C model avionics. The second and current upgrade program (HUG 2.2) updates the fleet's avionics even further. By 2021 12 (A)F/A-18A and 6 (A)F/A-18B (and an additional 7 broken down (A)F/A-18 for spare parts) were sold to the Royal Canadian Air Force.\nSpecifications (F/A-18C/D).\n\"Data from\" U.S. Navy fact file, F/A-18A/B/C/D NATOPS, Frawley Directory, Great BookGeneral characteristics* Crew: 1 (C - Pilot)/2 (D - pilot and weapon systems officer)* Aspect ratio: 4* Airfoil: root:NACA 65A005 mod.; tip:NACA 65A003.5 mod.* Fuel capacity: internally\nPerformance* Maximum speed: Mach 1.8\nArmament\nAvionics\n * AN/AAS-38 Nite Hawk targeting pods (U.S. Navy only), replaced by AN/ASQ-228 ATFLIR \"or\"\nSee also.\nRelated development\nAircraft of comparable role, configuration, and era\nRelated lists\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "45999", "revid": "7323", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45999", "title": "Gecko (software)", "text": "Open-source HTML layout engine\nGecko is a browser engine developed by Mozilla. It is used in the Firefox browser, the Thunderbird email client, and in a discontinued state on AOL's Netscape 6, Netscape 7, Netscape Browser and Netscape Navigator 9; this is alongside many other projects.\nGecko is designed to support open Internet standards, and is used by different applications to display web pages and, in some cases, an application's user interface itself (by rendering XUL). Gecko offers a rich programming API that makes it suitable for a wide variety of roles in Internet-enabled applications, such as web browsers, content presentation, and client/server.\nGecko is written in C++ and JavaScript, and, since 2016, additionally in Rust. It is free and open-source software subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public License version 2. Mozilla officially supports its use on Android, Linux, macOS, and Windows.\nHistory.\nDevelopment of the layout engine now known as Gecko began at Netscape in 1997, following the company's purchase of DigitalStyle. The existing Netscape rendering engine, originally written for Netscape Navigator 1.0 and upgraded through the years, was slow, did not comply well with W3C standards, had limited support for dynamic HTML and lacked features such as incremental reflow (when the layout engine rearranges elements on the screen as new data is downloaded and added to the page). The new layout engine was developed in parallel with the old, with the intention being to integrate it into Netscape Communicator when it was mature and stable. At least one more major revision of Netscape was expected to be released with the old layout engine before the switch.\nAfter the launch of the Mozilla project in early 1998, the new layout engine code was released under an open-source license. Originally unveiled as \"Raptor\", the name had to be changed to \"NGLayout\" (next generation layout) due to trademark problems. Netscape later rebranded NGLayout as \"Gecko\". While Mozilla Organization (the forerunner of the Mozilla Foundation) initially continued to use the NGLayout name (Gecko was a Netscape trademark), eventually the Gecko branding won out.\nIn October 1998, Netscape announced that its next browser would use Gecko (which was still called NGLayout at the time) rather than the old layout engine, requiring large parts of the application to be rewritten. While this decision was popular with web standards advocates, it was largely unpopular with Netscape developers, who were unhappy with the six months given for the rewrite. It also meant that most of the work done for Netscape Communicator 5.0 (including development on the Mariner improvements to the old layout engine) had to be abandoned. Netscape 6, the first Netscape release to incorporate Gecko, was released in November 2000 (the name Netscape 5 was never used).\nAs Gecko development continued, other applications and embedders began to make use of it. America Online, by this time Netscape's parent company, eventually adopted it for use in CompuServe 7.0 and AOL for Mac OS X (these products had previously embedded Internet Explorer). However, with the exception of a few betas, Gecko was never used in the main Microsoft Windows AOL client.\nOn July 15, 2003, AOL laid off the remaining Gecko developers and the Mozilla Foundation (formed on the same day) became the main steward of Gecko development. Today, Gecko is developed by employees of the Mozilla Corporation, employees of companies that contribute to the Mozilla project, and volunteers.\nIn the Netscape era, a combination of poor technical and management decisions resulted in Gecko software bloat. Thus in 2001 Apple chose to fork KHTML, not Gecko, to create the WebKit engine for its Safari browser. However, by 2008 Mozilla had addressed some of the bloat problems, resulting in significant performance improvements for Gecko.\nQuantum.\nIn October 2016, Mozilla announced Quantum, an ongoing project encompassing several software development efforts to \"build the next-generation web engine for Firefox users\". It included numerous improvements to Gecko, taken from the experimental Servo project. Firefox 57, also known as \"Firefox Quantum\", first shipped in November 2017 and was the initial version with major components from the Quantum/Servo projects enabled. These include increased performance in the CSS and GPU rendering components. Additional components will be merged from Servo to Gecko incrementally in future versions.\nGeckoView.\nIn September 2018, Mozilla announced GeckoView, the foundation of Mozilla's next generation of mobile products based on a software library that makes Gecko reusable for Android, encompassing newer software development efforts to \"decouple the engine itself from its user interface, and made it easy to embed in other applications\". Firefox Focus 7.0, shipped in the same month, is the initial version introduced GeckoView, with increased performance in median page loading. Firefox Reality was also built with GeckoView. In June 2019, Mozilla announced Firefox Preview as an ongoing project that focuses on building an Android web browser with GeckoView. Firefox for Android 79, also known as \"Firefox Daylight\", first shipping in August 2020, is the first stable release of that with major components powered by GeckoView engine.\nStandards support.\nSome of the standards Gecko supports include:\nLegacy IE non-standard support.\nIn order to support web pages designed for legacy versions of Netscape and Internet Explorer, Gecko supports DOCTYPE switching. Documents with a modern DOCTYPE are rendered in standards compliance mode, which follows the W3C standards strictly. Documents that have no DOCTYPE or an older DOCTYPE are rendered in quirks mode, which emulates some of the non-standard oddities of Netscape Communicator 4.x; however, some of the 4.x features (such as layers) are not supported.\nGecko also has limited support for some non-standard Internet Explorer features, such as the marquee element and the codice_1 property (though pages explicitly testing for codice_1 will be told it is not supported).\nUsage.\nGecko is primarily used in web browsers, the earliest being Netscape 6 and Mozilla Suite (later renamed SeaMonkey). It is also used in other Mozilla web browser derivatives such as Firefox and Firefox for mobile and the implementation of the Internet Explorer-clone that is part of Wine. Mozilla also uses it in their Thunderbird email-client.\nOther web browsers using Gecko include LibreWolf, Zen Browser, GNU IceCat, Midori, Waterfox, K-Meleon, Lunascape, Portable Firefox, Conkeror, Classilla, Floorp, TenFourFox and Sailfish Browser.\nGecko is also used by Sugar for the OLPC XO-1 computer, and is used as a complete implementation of the XUL (XML User Interface Language). Gecko currently defines the XUL specification. Gecko is also used by the KaiOS mobile operating system, which is based on the discontinued Firefox OS.\nPast users.\nProducts that formerly used Gecko include Pale Moon (now using Goanna), Epiphany (now known as GNOME Web and using WebKitGTK), and GNOME DevHelp (now using WebKitGTK).\nDiscontinued products that used Gecko include Swiftfox, Flock, Galeon, Camino, Minimo, Beonex Communicator, Kazehakase, Songbird, Sunbird (calendar), MicroB, Nightingale, Instantbird, and Picasa for Linux.\nProprietary dependency.\nOn Windows and other platforms, Gecko depends on proprietary compilers.\nVersioning.\nAfter Gecko 2.0, the version number was bumped to 5.0 to match Firefox 5, and from then on has been kept in sync with the major version number for both Firefox and Thunderbird, to reflect the fact that it is no longer a separate component.\nQuantum.\nQuantum is a Mozilla project encompassing several software development efforts to \"build the next-generation web engine for Firefox users\". It includes numerous improvements to Gecko, largely incorporated from the experimental Servo project. Quantum also includes refinements to the user interface and interactions.\nFirefox 57, released in November 2017, is the initial version with a Servo component enabled. Mozilla dubs this and several planned future releases \"Firefox Quantum\".\nBackground.\nIn 2012, Mozilla began the experimental Servo project, which is an engine designed from scratch with the goals of improving concurrency and parallelism while also reducing memory safety vulnerabilities. Servo is written in the Rust programming language, also created by Mozilla, which is designed to generate compiled code with better memory safety, concurrency, and parallelism than compiled C++ code.\nAs of April 2016, Servo needed at least several years of development to become a full-featured browser engine, hence the decision to start the Quantum project to bring stable portions of Servo into Firefox. Mozilla laid off all Servo developers in August 2020.\nComponents.\nThe Quantum project is composed of several sub-projects.\nAzure.\nThe Mozilla Azure project is a stateless low-level graphics abstraction API used in Firefox.&lt;br&gt;\nThe project has several objectives including:\nAzure will provide 2D hardware acceleration on top of 3D graphics backends. Firefox began using Azure instead of Cairo in 2012. It is written in C++ and used by Servo. The Azure name is an ode to the early Netscape founder James H. Clark and his earlier work at Silicon Graphics where workstations were often named after colors.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was a prominent figure of the Moldavian Revolution of 1848. Following his double election, he initiated a series of liberal and progressive reforms that contributed to the modernization of Romanian society and of state structures.\nAs ruler of the Romanian Principalities, he supported a political and diplomatic activity for the recognition of the union of Moldavia and Wallachia by the suzerain Ottoman Empire and achieved constitutional and administrative unity between Moldavia and Wallachia in 1862, when the Romanian Principalities officially adopted the name Romanian United Principalities with a single capital at Bucharest, a single national assembly and a single government.\nCuza's reform policies alienated a large coalition of conservatives and radical liberals, for the most part landowners and business owners. On 22 February 1866, he was forced to abdicate and leave the country. Today, he is often considered one of the founders of the modern Romanian state and a national hero of Romania.\nEarly life.\nBorn in B\u00e2rlad, Cuza belonged to the traditional boyar class in Moldavia, the son of Ispravnic Ioan Cuza (who was also a landowner in F\u0103lciu County) and his wife, Sultana (or Soltana), a member of the of Phanariote and Genovese origins. Alexander received an urbane European education in Ia\u0219i, Pavia, Bologna, and Athens; after a brief period of military service, he was also educated in Paris from 1837 to 1840. He became an officer in the Moldavian Army and rose to the rank of colonel. Alexandru married Princess Elena Rosetti in 1844.\nDuring the Revolutions of 1848, Moldavia and Wallachia fell into revolt. The Moldavian unrest was quickly suppressed, but in Wallachia the revolutionaries took power and governed during the summer. Young Cuza played a prominent enough part to establish his liberal credentials. He was shipped to Vienna as a prisoner, where he made his escape with British support.\nReturning during the reign of Prince Grigore Alexandru Ghica, he became Moldavia's minister of war in 1858; he also represented Gala\u021bi in the ad hoc Divan at Ia\u0219i. Cuza was acting freely under the guarantees of the European Powers in the eve of the Crimean War for recognition of a Prince of Moldavia. Cuza was a prominent speaker in the debates and strongly advocated the union of Moldavia and Wallachia. In default of a foreign prince, he was nominated as a candidate in both principalities by the pro-unionist Partida Na\u021bional\u0103 (profiting of an ambiguity in the text of the Treaty of Paris). Cuza was finally elected as Prince of Moldavia on 17 January 1859 (5 January Julian) and, after \"street pressure\" changed the vote in Bucharest, also Prince of Wallachia, on 5 February 1859 (24 January Julian), effectively uniting both principalities. He received the firman from the Sultan on 2 December 1861 during a visit to Istanbul.\nHe was a recipient of the Order of Medjidie, Order of Osmanieh, Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus, and Order of the Redeemer.\nAlthough he and his wife Elena Rosetti had no children, she raised as her own children his two sons by his mistress Elena Maria Catargiu-Obrenovi\u0107: Alexandru Al. Ioan Cuza (1864\u20131889), and Dimitrie Cuza (1865\u20131888 \"suicide\").\nReign.\nDiplomatic efforts.\nThus Cuza achieved a de facto union of the two principalities. The Powers backtracked, with Napoleon III of France remaining supportive, while the Austrian ministry withheld approval of such a union at the Congress of Paris (18 October 1858); partly as a consequence, Cuza's authority was not recognized by his nominal suzerain, Abd\u00fclaziz, the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, until 23 December 1861. Even then, the union was only accepted for the duration of Cuza's rule.\nThe union was formally declared three years later, on 5 February 1862, (24 January Julian), the new country bearing the name of Romania, with Bucharest as its capital city.\nCuza invested his diplomatic actions in gaining further concessions from the Powers: the sultan's assent to a single unified parliament and cabinet for Cuza's lifetime, in recognition of the complexity of the task. Thus, he was regarded as the political embodiment of a unified Romania.\nReforms.\nAssisted by his councilor Mihail Kog\u0103lniceanu, an intellectual leader of the 1848 revolution, Cuza initiated a series of reforms that contributed to the modernization of Romanian society and of state structures.\nHis first measure addressed a need for increasing the land resources and revenues available to the state, by nationalizing monastic estates in 1863. Probably more than a quarter of Romania's farmland was controlled by untaxed Eastern Orthodox \"Dedicated monasteries\", which supported Greek and other foreign monks in shrines such as Mount Athos and Jerusalem, presenting a substantial drain on state revenues. Cuza got his parliament's backing to expropriate these lands.\nDuring the secularization of the Antiochian Metochion in Bucharest, Cuza exiled its proistamenos the Metropolitan Ioannikios of Palmyra and arrested its hegumen Seraphim, later Metropolitan of Irenopolis in Isauria. He offered compensation to the Greek Orthodox Church, but Sophronius III, the Patriarch of Constantinople, refused to negotiate; after several years, the Romanian government withdrew its offer and no compensation was ever paid. State revenues thereby increased without adding any domestic tax burden.\nThe land reform, liberating peasants from the last corv\u00e9es, freeing their movements and redistributing some land (1864), was less successful. In attempting to create a solid support base among the peasants, Cuza soon found himself in conflict with the group of Conservatives. A liberal bill granting peasants title to the land they worked was defeated. Then the Conservatives responded with a bill that ended all peasant dues and responsibilities, but gave landlords title to all the land. Cuza vetoed it, then held a plebiscite to alter the Paris Convention (the virtual constitution), in the manner of Napoleon III.\nHis plan to establish universal manhood suffrage, together with the power of the Domnitor to rule by decree, passed by a vote of 682,621 to 1,307. This was an imperfect solution, still catering to the wealthy, and would be added onto with a constitution revision in 1866 after his abdication. He consequently governed the country under the provisions of \"Statutul dezvolt\u0103tor al Conven\u021biei de la Paris\" (\"Statute expanding the Paris Convention\"), an organic law adopted on 15 July 1864. With his new plenary powers, Cuza then promulgated the Agrarian Law of 1863. Peasants received title to the land they worked, while landlords retained ownership of one third. Where there was not enough land available to create workable farms under this formula, state lands (from the confiscated monasteries) would be used to give the landowners compensation.\nDespite the attempts by Lasc\u0103r Catargiu's cabinet to force a transition in which some corv\u00e9es were to be maintained, Cuza's reform marked the disappearance of the boyar class as a privileged group, and led to a channeling of energies into capitalism and industrialization; at the same time, however, land distributed was still below necessities, and the problem became stringent over the following decades \u2013 as peasants reduced to destitution sold off their land or found that it was insufficient for the needs of their growing families.\nCuza's reforms also included the adoption of the Criminal Code and the Civil Code based on the Napoleonic Code (1864), a Law on Education, establishing tuition-free, compulsory public education for primary schools (1864; the system, nonetheless, suffered from drastic shortages in allocated funds; illiteracy was eradicated about 100 years later, during the communist regime). He founded the University of Ia\u0219i (1860) and the University of Bucharest (1864), and helped develop a modern, European-style Romanian Army, under a working relationship with France. He is the founder of the Romanian Naval Forces.\nDownfall and exile.\nCuza failed in his effort to create an alliance of prosperous peasants and a strong liberal prince, ruling as a benevolent authoritarian in the style of Napoleon III. Having to rely on a decreasing group of hand-picked bureaucrats, Cuza began facing a mounting opposition after his land reform bill, with liberal landowners voicing concerns over his ability to represent their interests. Along with financial distress, there was an awkward scandal that revolved around his mistress, Maria Catargiu-Obrenovi\u0107, and popular discontent culminated in a coup d'\u00e9tat.\nCuza was forced to abdicate by the so-called \"monstrous coalition\" of Conservatives and Liberals. At four o'clock on the morning of 11 February 1866, a group of military conspirators broke into the palace, and compelled the prince to sign his abdication. On the following day they conducted him safely across the border.\nHis successor, Prince Karl of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, was proclaimed Domnitor as Carol I of Romania on 20 April 1866. The election of a foreign prince with ties to an important princely house, legitimizing Romanian independence (which Carol came to do after the Russo-Turkish War of 1877\u20131878), had been one of the liberal aims in the revolution of 1848.\nDespite the participation of Ion Br\u0103tianu and other future leaders of the Liberal Party in the overthrow of Cuza, he remained a hero to the radical and republican wing, who, as Francophiles, had an additional reason to oppose a Prussian monarch. There were anti-Carol riots in Bucharest during the Franco-Prussian War (\"see History of Bucharest\") and a coup attempt known as the Republic of Ploie\u0219ti in August 1870. The conflict was eventually resolved by a compromise between Br\u0103tianu and Carol, with the appointment of a prolonged and influential Liberal cabinet.\nCuza spent the remainder of his life in exile, chiefly in Paris, Vienna, and Wiesbaden, accompanied by his wife and his two sons. He died in Heidelberg on 15 May 1873. His remains were buried in his residence in Ruginoasa, but were moved to the Trei Ierarhi Cathedral in Ia\u0219i after World War II.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "46002", "revid": "16849003", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46002", "title": "Pax Americana", "text": "Historical concept\nPax Americana (Latin for 'American Peace', modeled after \"Pax Romana\" and \"Pax Britannica\"), often identified with the \"Long Peace\", is a term applied to the concept of relative peace in the Western Hemisphere and later in the world after the end of World War II in 1945, when the United States of America became the world's foremost economic, cultural, and military power exercising primary responsibilities for world order. Though in large measure based on consent and cooperation, the defining feature of the Pax Americana is unipolarity, world organization around a single center of power.\nIn this sense, \"Pax Americana\" has come to describe the military and economic position of the United States relative to other nations. In the aftermath of World War II the American federal government enacted the Marshall Plan, the transferring of US$13.3 billion (the equivalent of $173 billion in 2023) in economic recovery programs to Western European countries; the Marshall Plan has been described as \"the launching of the Pax Americana\".\nEarly period.\nThe first articulation of a \"Pax Americana\" occurred after the end of the American Civil War (in which the United States both quashed its greatest disunity and demonstrated the ability to field millions of well-equipped soldiers utilizing modern tactics) with reference to the peaceful nature of the North American geographical region, and was abeyant at the commencement of the First World War. Its emergence was concurrent with the development of the idea of American exceptionalism. This view holds that the U.S. occupies a special niche among developed nations in terms of its national credo, historical evolution, political and religious institutions, and unique origins. The concept originates from Alexis de Tocqueville, who asserted that the then-50-year-old United States held a special place among nations because it was a country of immigrants and the first modern democracy. From the establishment of the United States after the American Revolution until the Spanish\u2013American War, the foreign policy of the United States had a regional, instead of global, focus. The Pax Americana, which the Union enforced upon the states of central North America, was a factor in the United States' national prosperity. The larger states were surrounded by smaller states, but these had no anxieties: no standing armies to require taxes and hinder labor; no wars or rumors of wars that would interrupt trade; there is not only peace, but security, for the Pax Americana of the Union covered all the states within the federal constitutional republic. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the first time the phrase appeared in print was in the August 1894 issue of \"Forum\": \"The true cause for exultation is the universal outburst of patriotism in support of the prompt and courageous action of President Cleveland in maintaining the supremacy of law throughout the length and breadth of the land, in establishing the \"pax Americana\".\"\nWith the rise of the New Imperialism in the Western hemisphere at the end of the 19th century, debates arose between imperialist and isolationist factions in the U.S. Here, \"Pax Americana\" was used to connote the peace across the United States and, more widely, as a Pan-American peace under the aegis of the Monroe Doctrine. Those who favored traditional policies of avoiding foreign entanglements included labor leader Samuel Gompers and steel tycoon Andrew Carnegie. American politicians such as Henry Cabot Lodge, William McKinley, and Theodore Roosevelt advocated an aggressive foreign policy, but the administration of President Grover Cleveland was unwilling to pursue such actions. On January 16, 1893, U.S. diplomatic and military personnel conspired with a small group of individuals to overthrow the constitutional government of the Kingdom of Hawaii and establish a Provisional Government and then a republic. On February 15, they presented a treaty for annexation of the Hawaiian Islands to the U.S. Senate, but opposition to annexation stalled its passage. The United States finally opted to annex Hawaii by way of the Newlands Resolution in July 1898.\nAfter its victory in the Spanish\u2013American War of 1898 and the subsequent acquisition of Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Philippines, and Guam, the United States had gained a colonial empire. By ejecting Spain from the Americas, the United States shifted its position to an uncontested regional power, and extended its influence into Southeast Asia and Oceania. Although U.S. capital investments within the Philippines and Puerto Rico were relatively small, these colonies were strategic outposts for expanding trade with Latin America and Asia, particularly China. In the Caribbean area, the United States established a sphere of influence in line with the Monroe Doctrine, not explicitly defined as such, but recognized in effect by other governments and accepted by at least some of the republics in that area. The events around the start of the 20th century demonstrated that the United States undertook an obligation, usual in such cases, of imposing a \"Pax Americana\". As in similar instances elsewhere, this Pax Americana was not quite clearly marked in its geographical limit, nor was it guided by any theoretical consistency, but rather by the merits of the case and the test of immediate expediency in each instance. Thus, whereas the United States enforced a peace in much of the lands southward from the Nation and undertook measures to maintain internal tranquility in such areas, the United States on the other hand withdrew from interposition in Mexico.\nEuropean powers largely regarded these matters as the concern of the United States. Indeed, the nascent Pax Americana was, in essence, abetted by the policy of the United Kingdom, and the preponderance of global sea power which the British Empire enjoyed by virtue of the strength of the Royal Navy. Preserving the freedom of the seas and ensuring naval dominance had been the policy of the British since victory in the Napoleonic Wars. As it was not in the interests of the United Kingdom to permit any European power to interfere in Americas, the Monroe Doctrine was indirectly aided by the Royal Navy. British commercial interests in South America, which comprised a valuable component of the informal empire that accompanied Britain's overseas possessions, and the economic importance of the United States as a trading partner, ensured that intervention by Britain's rival European powers could not engage with the Americas.\nThe United States lost its Pacific and regionally bounded nature towards the end of the 19th century. The government adopted protectionism after the Spanish\u2013American War and built up the navy, the \"Great White Fleet\", to expand the reach of U.S. power. When Theodore Roosevelt became president in 1901, he accelerated a foreign policy shift away from isolationism towards foreign intervention which had begun under his predecessor, William McKinley. The Philippine\u2013American War (1899\u20131913) arose from the ongoing Philippine Revolution against imperialism. Interventionism found its formal articulation in the 1904 Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine, proclaiming the right of the United States to intervene in the affairs of weak states in the Americas in order to stabilize them, a moment that underlined the emergent U.S. regional hegemony. By 1900, the United States possessed the world's largest industrial capacity and national income, having surpassed both the United Kingdom and Germany.\nInterwar period.\nThe United States had been criticized for not taking up the hegemonic mantle following the disintegration of \"Pax Britannica\" before the First World War and during the interwar period due to the absence of established political structures, such as the World Bank or United Nations which would be created after World War II, and various internal policies, such as protectionism. Though, the United States participated in the Great War, according to Woodrow Wilson:\n&lt;poem&gt;[...] to vindicate the principles of peace and justice in the life of the world as against selfish and autocratic power and to set up amongst the really free and self-governed peoples of the world such a concert of purpose and of action as will henceforth insure the observance of those principles.\n[...] for democracy, for the right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their own government, for the rights and liberties of small nations, for a universal dominion of right by such a concert of free peoples as shall bring peace and safety to all nations and make the world itself at last free.&lt;/poem&gt;\nThe United States' entry into the Great War marked the abandonment of the traditional American policy of isolation and independence of world politics. Not at the close of the Civil War, not as the result of the Spanish War, but in the Interwar period did the United States become a part of the international system. With this global reorganization from the Great War, there were those in the American populace that advocated an activist role in international politics and international affairs by the United States. Activities that were initiated did not fall into political-military traps and, instead, focused on economic-ideological approaches that would increase the American Empire and general worldwide stability. Following the prior path, a precursor to the United Nations and a league to enforce peace, the League of Nations, was proposed by Woodrow Wilson. This was rejected by the American government in favor of more economic-ideological approaches and the United States did not join the League. Additionally, there were even proposals of extending the Monroe Doctrine to Great Britain put forth to prevent a second conflagration on the European theater. Ultimately, the United States' proposals and actions did not stop the factors of European nationalism spawned by the previous war, the repercussions of Germany's defeat, and the failures of the Treaty of Versailles from plunging the globe into a Second World War.\nBetween World War I and World War II, America also sought to continue to preserve \"Pax America\" as a corollary to the Monroe Doctrine. Some sought the peaceful and orderly evolution of existing conditions in the western hemisphere and nothing by immediate changes. Before 1917, the position of the United States government and the feelings of the nation in respect to the \"Great War\" initially had properly been one of neutrality. Its interests remained untouched, and nothing occurred of a nature to affect those interests.\nPax Americana was not just an idea reserved for the United States government. Business leaders from across the major corporations in the US all sought to steer America into a time of Pax Americana. For them by creating better trading conditions through peace and stability, they could expand their own businesses and maintain US superiority in the global stage. As the United States government had close ties to the largest businesses in America, it was easier for these businesses to sway political acts in their favour. These businesses also helped create the conditions for Pax Americana using foreign investments, loans and trade to secure influence without military commitment.\nThe average American's sympathies, on the other hand, if the feelings of the vast majority of the nation had been correctly interpreted, was with the Allied (Entente) Powers. The population of the United States was revolted at the ruthlessness of the Prussian doctrine of war, and German designs to shift the burden of aggression encountered skeptical derision. The American populace saw themselves safeguarding liberal peace in the Western World. To this end, the American writer Roland Hugins stated that the United States is the only strong nation that has not entered on a career of imperial conquest and does not aspire to be the Romans of tomorrow or the \"masters of the world\". There is in America little of militarism, the Americans are not enamored of glamour or glory. Their desire to be left alone to work out their own destiny has been manifest from the birth of the republic.\nIt was observed during this time that the initial defeat of Germany opened a moral recasting of the world. The battles between Germans and Allies were seen as far less battles between different nations than they represent the contrast between Liberalism and reaction, between the aspirations of democracy and the Wilhelminism gospel of iron.\nAccording to Swen Holdar, the founder of geopolitics Rudolf Kjellen (1864\u20131922) predicted the era of US global supremacy using the term \"Pax Americana\" shortly after World War I. Writing in 1945, Ludwig Dehio remembered that the Germans used the term \"Pax Anglosaxonica\" in a sense of Pax Americana since 1918:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPostwar period.\nThe modern \"Pax Americana\" era is cited by supporters and critics of U.S. foreign policy since the beginning of World War II. In 1941, before the entrance of the United States into the War, US Ambassador to Canada, James H. R. Cromwell, published a book, titled \"Pax Americana\". As the title implies, the book envisages the postwar world order with the interventionist US policy. Another wartime book confirms that the postwar era \"might well be known as Pax Americana.\" Both the world and the United States need American peace and the United States must insist upon it and accept nothing less. Explicit criticisms of the idea of Pax Americana appear in the United States synchronously.\nFrom 1945 to 1991, Pax Americana was a partial international order, as it applied only to the Western world, being preferable for some authors to speak about a \"Pax Americana et Sovietica\". Many commentators and critics focus on American policies from 1992 to the present, and as such, it carries different connotations depending on the context. For example, it appears three times in the 90-page document, \"Rebuilding America's Defenses,\" by the Project for the New American Century, but is also used by critics to characterize American dominance and hyperpower status as imperialist in function and basis. From about the mid-1940s until 1991, U.S. foreign policy was dominated by the Cold War, and characterized by its significant international military presence and greater diplomatic involvement. Seeking an alternative to the isolationist policies pursued after World War I, the United States defined a new policy called containment to oppose the spread of Soviet communism.\nThe modern \"Pax Americana\" may be seen as similar to the period of peace in Rome, \"Pax Romana\". In both situations, the period of peace was 'relative peace'. During both \"Pax Romana\" and \"Pax Americana\" wars continued to occur, but it was still a prosperous time for both Western and Roman civilizations. It is important to note that during these periods, and most other times of relative tranquility, the peace that is referred to does not mean complete peace. Rather, it simply means the civilization prospered in their military, agriculture, trade, and manufacturing.\n\"Pax Britannica\" heritage.\nFrom the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 until the First World War in 1914, the United Kingdom played the role of offshore-balancer in Europe, where the balance of power was the main aim. It was also in this time that the British Empire became the largest empire of all time. The global superiority of British military and commerce was guaranteed by dominance of a Europe lacking in strong nation-states, and the presence of the Royal Navy on all of the world's oceans and seas. In 1905, the Royal Navy was superior to any two navies combined in the world. It provided services such as suppression of piracy and slavery.\nIn this era of peace, though, there were several wars between the major powers: the Crimean War, the Franco-Austrian War, the Austro-Prussian War, the Franco-Prussian War, and the Russo-Japanese War, as well as numerous other wars. William Wohlforth has argued that this period of tranquility, sometimes termed \"La Belle \u00c9poque\", was actually a series of hegemonic states imposing a peaceful order. In Wohlforth's view, \"Pax Britannica\" transitioned to \"Pax Russica\" and then to \"Pax Germanica\", before ultimately, between 1853 and 1871, ceasing to be a \"Pax\" of any kind.\nDuring the \"Pax Britannica\", America developed close ties with Britain, evolving into what has become known as a \"special relationship\" between the two. The many commonalities shared with the two nations (such as language and history) drew them together as allies. Under the managed transition of the British Empire to the Commonwealth of Nations, members of the British government, such as Harold Macmillan, liked to think of Britain's relationship with America as similar to that of a progenitor Greece to America's Rome. Throughout the years, both have been active in North American, Middle Eastern, and Asian countries. \nIn 1942, Advisory Committee on Postwar Foreign Policy envisaged that the United States may have to supplant the British Empire. Therefore, the United States \"must cultivate a mental view toward world settlement after this war which will enable us to impose our own terms, amounting perhaps to a Pax Americana\". The transition from the British Empire to the Pax Americana is commonly dated to 1947 when the British rule ended in India, Pakistan, Palestine and the eastern Mediterranean, and the Truman Doctrine announced.\nLate 20th century.\nAfter the Second World War, no armed conflict emerged among major Western nations themselves, and no nuclear weapons were used in open conflict. The United Nations was also soon developed after World War II to help keep peaceful relations between nations and establishing the veto power for the permanent members of the UN Security Council, which included the United States.\nIn the second half of the 20th century, the USSR and US superpowers were engaged in the Cold War, which can be seen as a struggle between hegemonies for global dominance. After 1945, the United States enjoyed an advantageous position with respect to the rest of the industrialized world. In the Post\u2013World War II economic expansion, the US was responsible for half of global industrial output, held 80 percent of the world's gold reserves, and was the world's sole nuclear power. The catastrophic destruction of life, infrastructure, and capital during the Second World War had exhausted the imperialism of the Old World, victor and vanquished alike. The largest economy in the world at the time, the United States recognized that it had come out of the war with its domestic infrastructure virtually unscathed and its military forces at unprecedented strength. Military officials recognized the fact that Pax Americana had been reliant on the effective United States air power, just as the instrument of Pax Britannica a century earlier was its sea power. In addition, a \"unipolar moment\" was seen to have occurred following the collapse of the Soviet Union.\nThe term \"Pax Americana\" was explicitly used by John F. Kennedy in the 1960s, who advocated against the idea, arguing that the Soviet bloc was composed of human beings with the same individual goals as Americans and that such a peace based on \"American weapons of war\" was undesirable:\nI have, therefore, chosen this time and place to discuss a topic on which ignorance too often abounds and the truth too rarely perceived. And that is the most important topic on earth: peace. What kind of peace do I mean and what kind of a peace do we seek? Not a \"Pax Americana\" enforced on the world by American weapons of war. Not the peace of the grave or the security of the slave. I am talking about genuine peace, the kind of peace that makes life on earth worth living, and the kind that enables men and nations to grow, and to hope, and build a better life for their children \u2013 not merely peace for Americans but peace for all men and women, not merely peace in our time but peace in all time.\nNo other US Presidents claimed Pax Americana. As Kennedy, Richard Nixon and George Bush the senior referred to Pax Americana but exclusively to deny its existence in fact and intent. For this reason, the concept was called \"undiplomatic\".\nBeginning around the Vietnam War, the 'Pax Americana' term had started to be used by the critics of American Imperialism. Here in the late 20th-century conflict between the Soviet Union and the United States, the charge of \"Neocolonialism\" was often aimed at Western involvement in the affairs of the Third World and other developing nations. NATO became regarded as a symbol of \"Pax Americana\" in West Europe:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The visible political symbol of the Pax Americana was NATO itself ... The Supreme Allied Commander, always an American, was an appropriate title for the American proconsul whose reputation and influence outweighed those of European premiers, presidents, and chancellors.\nIn one of the first criticisms of \"Pax Americana\" in 1943 Nathaniel Peffer wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHe did not know if it would happen: \"It is conceivable that\u00a0... America might drift into empire, imperceptibly, stage by stage, in a kind of power-politics gravitation.\" He also noted that America was heading precisely in that direction: \"That there are certain stirrings in this direction is apparent, though how deep they go is unclear.\"\nThe depth soon became clarified. Two later critics of \"Pax Americana\", Michio Kaku and David Axelrod, interpreted the outcome of Pax Americana: \"Gunboat diplomacy would be replaced by Atomic diplomacy. \"Pax Britannica\" would give way to \"Pax Americana\".\" After the war, with the German and British militaries in tatters, only one force stood on the way to Pax Americana: the Soviet Army. Four years after this criticism was written, the Red Army withdrew, paving the way for the unipolar moment. Joshua Muravchik commemorated the event by titling his 1991 article, \"At Last, Pax Americana\". He detailed:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Last but not least, the Gulf War marks the dawning of the Pax Americana. True, that term was used immediately after World War II. But it was a misnomer then because the Soviet empire \u2013 a real competitor with American power \u2013 was born at the same moment. The result was not a \"pax\" of any kind, but a cold war and a bipolar world\u00a0... During the past two years, however, Soviet power has imploded and a bipolar world has become unipolar.\nThe following year, in 1992, a US strategic draft for the post-Cold War period was leaked to the press. The person responsible for the confusion, former Assistant Secretary of State, Paul Wolfowitz, confessed seven years later: \"In 1992 a draft memo prepared by my office at the Pentagon\u00a0... leaked to the press and sparked a major controversy.\" The draft's strategy aimed \"to prevent any hostile power from dominating\" a Eurasian region \"whose resources would, under consolidated control, be sufficient to generate global power\". He added: \"Senator Joseph Biden ridiculed the proposed strategy as 'literally a \"Pax Americana\"\u00a0... It won't work\u00a0...' Just seven years later, many of these same critics seem quite comfortable with the idea of a \"Pax Americana\".\" The post-Cold War period, concluded William Wohlforth, much less ambiguously deserves to be called \"Pax Americana\". \"Calling the current period the true Pax Americana may offend some, but it reflects reality\".\nContemporary power.\nSince 1991, the \"Pax Americana\" was based on the military preponderance beyond challenge by any combination of rival powers and projection of power throughout the world's \"commons\" \u2013 neutral sea, air and space. This projection is coordinated by the Unified Command Plan which divides the world on regional branches controlled by a single command. The \"right to command\", translated into Latin, gives \"imperium\", \"commands\" (plural) \"imperia\". The US Combatant Commanders have often been associated with the Roman proconsuls and a complete book was devoted to the comparison.\nIntegrated with it are global network of military alliances (the Rio Pact, NATO, ANZUS and bilateral alliances with Japan and several other states) coordinated by Washington in a hub-and-spokes system and worldwide network of several hundreds of military bases and installations. Neither the Rio Treaty, nor NATO, for Robert J. Art, \"was a regional collective security organization; rather both were regional imperia run and operated by the United States\". Former Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski drew an expressive summary of the military foundation of \"Pax Americana\" shortly after the \"unipolar moment\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In contrast [to the earlier empires], the scope and pervasiveness of American global power today are unique. Not only does the United States control all the world's oceans, its military legions are firmly perched on the western and eastern extremities of Eurasia\u00a0... American vassals and tributaries, some yearning to be embraced by even more formal ties to Washington, dot the entire Eurasian continent\u00a0... American global supremacy is\u00a0... buttered by an elaborate system of alliances and coalitions that literally span the globe. \nBesides the military foundation, there are significant non-military international institutions backed by American financing and diplomacy (like the United Nations and WTO). The United States invested heavily in programs such as the Marshall Plan and in the reconstruction of Japan, economically cementing defense ties that owed increasingly to the establishment of the Iron Curtain/Eastern Bloc and the widening of the Cold War.\nBeing in the best position to take advantage of free trade, culturally indisposed to traditional empires, and alarmed by the rise of communism in China and the detonation of the first Soviet atom bomb, the historically non-interventionist US also took a keen interest in developing multilateral institutions which would maintain a favorable world order among them. The International Monetary Fund and International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (World Bank), part of the Bretton Woods system of international financial management was developed and, until the early 1970s, the existence of a fixed exchange rate to the US dollar. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) was developed and consists of a protocol for normalization and reduction of trade tariffs.\nWith the fall of the Iron Curtain, the demise of the notion of a \"Pax Sovietica\", and the end of the Cold War, the US maintained significant contingents of armed forces in Europe and East Asia. The institutions behind the Pax Americana and the rise of the United States unipolar power have persisted into the early 21st century. The ability of the United States to act as \"the world's policeman\" has been constrained by its own citizens' historic aversion to foreign wars. Though there have been calls for the continuation of military leadership, as stated in \"Rebuilding America's Defenses\":\nThe American peace has proven itself peaceful, stable, and durable. It has, over the past decade, provided the geopolitical framework for widespread economic growth and the spread of American principles of liberty and democracy. Yet no moment in international politics can be frozen in time; even a global \"Pax Americana\" will not preserve itself. [... What is required is] a military that is strong and ready to meet both present and future challenges; a foreign policy that boldly and purposefully promotes American principles abroad; and national leadership that accepts the United States' global responsibilities.\nThis is reflected in the research of American exceptionalism, which shows that \"there is some indication for [being a leader of an 'American peace'] among the [US] public, but very little evidence of unilateral attitudes\". Resentments have arisen at a country's dependence on American military protection, due to disagreements with United States foreign policy or the presence of American military forces.\nIn the \"post-communism\" world of the 21st-century, the French Socialist politician and former Foreign Minister Hubert V\u00e9drine describes the US as a hegemonic hyperpower, while the US political scientists John Mearsheimer counter that the US is not a \"true\" hegemony, because it does not have the resources to impose a proper, formal, global rule; despite its political and military strength, the US is economically equal to Europe, thus, cannot rule the international stage. Several other countries are either emerging or re-emerging as powers, such as China, Russia, India, and the European Union.\nIn 1998, American political author, Charles A. Kupchan, described the world order \"After Pax Americana\" and the next year \"The Life after Pax Americana\". In 2003, he announced \"The End of the American Era\". In 2012, he projected: \"America's military strength will remain as central to global stability in the years ahead as it has been in the past.\"\nThe Russian analyst Leonid Grinin argues that at present and in the nearest future \"Pax Americana\" will remain an effective tool of supporting the world order since the US concentrates too many leadership functions which no other country is able to take to the full extent. Thus, he warns that the destruction of \"Pax Americana\" will bring critical transformations of the World-system with unclear consequences.\nAmerican political analyst Ian Bremmer argued that with the election of Donald Trump and the subsequent rise in populism in the west, as well as US withdrawal from international agreements such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, NAFTA, and the Paris Climate Accords, that the \"Pax Americana\" is over.\nAmerican writer and academic Michael Lind stated that the \"Pax Americana\" withstood both the Cold War and the post-Cold War era, and \"today's Second Cold War has strengthened rather than weakened America's informal empire,\" at least for now.\nComparison with Pax Romana.\nIn 1914, an Italian Historian, Guglielmo Ferrero, published \"Ancient Rome and Modern America: A Comparative Study of Morals and Manners\". The title is misleading because the work does not pertain specifically to the United States. Instead, it compares Rome and what Ferrero labels the \"New World\" and broadens the discussion to modern civilization in general. However, Ferrero's pioneering comparison echoed in the 1961 article by Mason Hammond, titled \"Ancient Rome and modern America reconsidered.\" Highly critical of the use of the past for the present, he still associated: \"The modern world, like the Mediterranean world of the First century BC, faces a choice between self-annihilation... or of unification and peace... Rome of the second century BC and the United States of today face without adequate preparation the responsibilities of world dominance and the dilemma of how to reconcile recognition of the sovereignty of other states with national security.\"\nHammond considered five moments in Roman history which offer tempting similarities to the American present and suggested the differences which \"render such parallels deceptive\". Two of his differences refer to the parallel between Rome in 150 BC and the United States in 1960. First, representative federalism today offers for international rivalries an alternative solution to Pax Americana. \"Rome moved toward imperialistic control; the United States can still hope for a cooperative federal solution through the United Nations.\" Unwilling to trust the lessons of history, Hammond bet on the utopian idea of world federalism. Second, the world is bipolar and it would be \"foolish to equate Antiochus the Great of Syria in the 190s BC or Parthia in the 150s as rivals to Rome with Russia as a rival to the United States\" because Russia is more formidable. What Hammond called \"representative federalism\" remains where it was in his days, but thirty years after he published his parallels, Pax Americana leaped relatively to Pax Sovietica. The parallel proved to be \"deceptive\" indeed but in the opposite sense.\nWriting in 1945, Ludwig Dehio remembered that the Germans used the term \"Pax Anglosaxonica\" in a sense of Pax Americana since 1918 and discussed the possibility of a Pax Anglosaxonica as a world-wide counterpart to the Pax Romana. The United States, Dehio associates on the same page, withdrew to isolation on that occasion. \"Rome, too, had taken a long time to understand the significance of her world role.\"\nWith the outbreak of World War II, British Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain, resolved that England would win the Second World War too as Rome had won the Second Punic War. Hitler disagreed: history has not yet determined who shall play Rome and who shall play Carthage in this case. The War fast took a clear turn towards what the contemporary Germans feared as the fatal \"Pax Anglosaxonica\". In 1943, Hitler tried to encourage his team: \"They will never become Rome. America will never be the Rome of the future.\" The same year, however, Hitler's compatriot and the founder of the Paneuropean Union, Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi, whom Hitler called \"cosmopolitan bastard\", projected a new \"Pax Romana\" based on the preponderant US air power:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;During the third century BC the Mediterranean world was divided on five great powers \u2013 Roma and Carthage, Macedonia, Syria, and Egypt. The balance of power led to a series of wars until Rome emerged the queen of the Mediterranean and established an incomparable era of two centuries of peace and progress, the 'Pax Romana'\u00a0... It may be that America's air power could again assure our world, now much smaller than the Mediterranean at that period, two hundred years of peace\u00a0... This is the only realistic hope for a lasting peace.\nSoon many scholars found that what Coudenhove-Kalergi called the \"only realistic hope for peace\" is coming true. In 1953, British Classicist Gilbert Murray encouraged that across the Atlantic is waiting a \"greater Rome\" which can establish world peace or at least maintain Europe in an \"ocean of barbarism\" as Rome maintained Hellas. In the mid-1960s, some scholars concluded that the United States had outstripped the Soviet Union beyond the bipolar model and instead looked to the model of Rome. One of those scholars, George Liska, argued that historical superstates in general and the Roman Empire in particular rather than the recent colonial empires have relevance for the contemporary US foreign policy. \nPrefacing his \"Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire\" in 1976, Pentagon employee Edward Luttwak stressed that the United States pursues similar to Rome goals, faces a similar kind of resistance, and hence must apply a similar strategy. In the late 1990s, Pentagon initiated new research on \"military advantage in history\" and how to keep it. Of four empires they selected, Rome was emphasized as the most relevant model for the contemporary United States. The \"whole bunch\" of copies went out to the government. A decade later, former NSC employee, Carnes Lord, compared US combatant commanders, Roman proconsuls, British colonial officials, Persian satraps and Spanish viceroys. He found the American version most similar to the Roman proconsular model.\nWhile Pentagon and NSC employees turned into Roman Historians, Roman Historian Arthur M. Eckstein proceeded in the reverse direction. He noted that the theoretical framework of hierarchy, unipolarity, and empire as political scientists have defined these terms is a procedure rarely pursued among scholars of Mediterranean antiquity and decided to fill the gap. Eckstein presented his subject in terms of the 20th-century International Relations. The five-year (196\u2013192 BC) diplomatic confrontation between Rome and Antiochus III was a classic contest between the two superpowers in a \"bipolar system\". The confrontation turned into war and in 189 BC Rome defeated Antiochus. This victory resulted in an unprecedented for the Mediterranean world unipolar moment with Rome established as a \"unipolar hegemon\". There remained only one political and military focus, only one preponderant power. \"Rome was now the sole remaining superpower.\" A unified \"unipolar system\" stretched from Spain to Syria.\nAnti-imperialist empire is not a modern invention. Initially, Rome had appeared in the East as an anti-imperialist power \u2013 the champion of the weaker states against the aggression of the great powers of Philip V of Macedon and Antiochus III. Eckstein's student, Paul Burton, adds that Achaean League statesman Lycortas, father of Polybius, interpreted the Roman foreign policy in words that might sound familiar to the critics of US foreign policy: The message the Romans are sending by criticizing the Achaeans is that \"freedom, in the Roman mind, is also empire\" (Livius 39.36.5 \u2013 37.17).\nBut Eckstein cared to provide the contemporary world with an emergency exit from Pax Americana. The Roman achievement of unipolarity was only one step along the spectrum of interstate relations that leads towards empire. And unipolarity, even when once achieved, can nevertheless be reversed. Historically this has frequently occurred and in the late 2000s the United States is discovering that unipolarity is unstable.\nJoseph Nye titled his 2002 article \"The New Rome Meets the New Barbarians\". His book of the same year he opens: \"Not since Rome has one nation loomed so large above the others.\" And his 1991 book he titled \"Bound to Lead\". \"Leadership\", translated into Greek, renders \"hegemony\"; an alternative translation is \"archia\" \u2013 Greek common word for \"empire\". Decline, he writes, is not necessarily imminent. \"Rome remained dominant for more than three centuries after the peak of its power\u00a0...\nThe Pax Americana motif and its Roman parallel reached their peak in the context of the 2003 Iraq War. Comparing the United States to the Roman Empire has become somewhat of a clich\u00e9. Jonathan Freedland observed:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Of course, enemies of the United States have shaken their fist at its \"imperialism\" for decades\u00a0... What is more surprising, and much newer, is that the notion of an American empire has suddenly become a live debate inside the United States Accelerated by the post-9/11 debate on America's role in the world, the idea of the United States as a 21st-century Rome is gaining a foothold in the country's consciousness.\n\"The New York Review of Books\" illustrated a 2002 piece on US might with a drawing of George Bush togged up as a Roman centurion, complete with shield and spears. Bush's visits to Germany in 2002 and 2006 resulted in further Bush-as-Roman-emperor invective appearing in the German press. In 2006, freelance writer, political satirist, and correspondent for the left-leaning \"Die Tageszeitung\", Arno Frank, compared the spectacle of the visit by \"Imperator\" Bush to \"elaborate inspection tours of Roman emperors in important but not completely pacified provinces \u2013 such as Germania\". In September 2002, Boston's WBUR-FM radio station titled a special on US imperial power with the tag \"Pax Americana\". The phrase \"American Empire\" appeared in one thousand news stories over a single six-month period in 2003. A 2009 Google search yielded policy analyst Vaclav Smil 22 million hits for \"America as a new Rome\", and 23 million for \"American Empire.\" Intrigued, Smil titled his 2010 book by what he intended to explain: \"Why America Is Not a New Rome\". The volume of the Rome-US comparisons made a bewildering impression on reviewers: \"As the trickle turns into a flood, it is impossible to keep up with the many articles, books, internet sites, and documentaries that pose the comparison. Even after 2009... the number of works about Rome and the USA shows no sign of abating.\"\nTwo Classicists, Paul J. Burton and Eric Adler, decided that the volume of comparisons between America and Rome requires research of its own. Adler's comparison of comparisons revealed that most interventionists dissociate America from Rome while most critics of US interventions emphasize similarities between the two. The same he finds true for the Edwardian and Victorian debates regarding the British Empire. Isolationists use the polemical value of the \"New Rome\" to \"shock\" the reader while interventionists offer the same reader a therapy by distinguishing Rome from America. Adler also observed that many notable authors are more interested in expressing their opinion about recent US foreign policy rather than offering a nuanced interpretation of Roman history checked against primary sources. Instead, from secondary sources they select elements fitting their line and disregard whether these elements are from the republican Rome, or imperial Rome, or even the Byzantine Empire.\nLike Smil, Classicist and military Historian Victor Davis Hanson dissociates the United States from Rome. The U.S. does not pursue world domination, but maintains worldwide influence by a system of mutually beneficial exchanges. He dismisses the notion of an American Empire altogether, with a mocking comparison to historical empires: \"We do not send out proconsuls to reside over client states, which in turn impose taxes on coerced subjects to pay for the legions. Instead, American bases are predicated on contractual obligations\u00a0\u2014 costly to us and profitable to their hosts. We do not see any profits in Korea, but instead accept the risk of losing almost 40,000 of our youth to ensure that Kias can flood our shores and that shaggy students can protest outside our embassy in Seoul.\"\nThe existence of \"proconsuls\", however, has been recognized by many since the early Cold War. In 1957, French Historian Amaury de Riencourt associated the American \"proconsul\" with \"the Roman of our time.\" Expert on recent American history, Arthur M. Schlesinger, detected several contemporary imperial features, including \"proconsuls\". Washington does not directly run many parts of the world. Rather, its \"informal empire\" was one \"richly equipped with imperial paraphernalia: troops, ships, planes, bases, proconsuls, local collaborators, all spread wide around the luckless planet\". \"The Supreme Allied Commander, always an American, was an appropriate title for the American proconsul whose reputation and influence outweighed those of European premiers, presidents, and chancellors.\" U.S. \"combatant commanders\u00a0... have served as its proconsuls. Their standing in their regions has usually dwarfed that of ambassadors and assistant secretaries of state.\"\nAndrew J. Bacevich in his 2002 book about American Empire titled a chapter \"Rise of the proconsuls,\" where he identifies a new class of uniformed proconsuls presiding over vast \"quasi-imperial\" domains who emerged in the 1990s. In September 2000, \"Washington Post\" reporter Dana Priest published a series of articles whose central premise was Combatant Commanders' inordinate amount of political influence within the countries in their areas of responsibility. They \"had evolved into the modern-day equivalent of the Roman Empire's proconsuls\u2014well-funded, semi-autonomous, unconventional centers of U.S. foreign policy.\" A book, titled \"America's Viceroys\", responds to Priest, claiming that US Combatant Commanders pose no threat of marching on Washington while Roman proconsuls \"always presented\" such threat. Many Roman historians however reduce the period of the threat from \"always\" to the last century of the Republic (133-31 BC). One of most honorable Roman proconsuls who won for Rome supremacy over the Mediterranean, Scipio Africanus, was unsuccessful in the 184 BC campaign for the censorship and retired from politics. Founded c. 509 BC, the Republic still firmly controlled its proconsuls. Stephen Wrage precludes future complications with Combatant Commanders, while some Roman historians are more cautious, supposing that the United States might be in the Roman sequence \"somewhere between the great wars of conquest [202-146 BC] and the rise of the Caesars.\"\nCarnes Lord observes that since the 2000s, the notion that the Combatant Commanders are in effect the \"proconsuls\" of a new American Empire has become a standard trope in the literature on American foreign policy. Harvard professor Niall Ferguson calls the regional combatant commanders, among whom the whole globe is divided, the \"pro-consuls\" of this \"imperium\". G\u00fcnter Bischof calls them \"the all powerful proconsuls of the new American empire. Like the proconsuls of Rome they were supposed to bring order and law to the unruly and anarchical world.\" The Romans often preferred to exercise power through friendly client regimes, rather than direct rule: \"Until Jay Garner and L. Paul Bremer became U.S. proconsuls in Baghdad, that was the American method, too\".\nCarnes Lord devoted a book to comparison between the Roman proconsuls, British colonial officials and US Combatant Commanders. The latter for him also associate with the Persian satraps and Spanish viceroys. He found the American version most similar to the Roman proconsular model. As they contributed importantly to the policy on the marches of empire, all of them qualify as proconsuls in proper sense of the term. With all due qualification, he confessed, his study is about imperial governance in the imperial periphery.\nAnother distinction of Victor Davis Hanson\u2014that US bases, contrary to the legions, are costly to America and profitable for their hosts\u2014expresses the American view. The hosts express a diametrically opposite view. Japan pays for 25,000 Japanese working on US bases. 20% of those workers provide entertainment: a list drawn up by the Japanese Ministry of Defense included 76 bartenders, 48 vending machine personnel, 47 golf course maintenance personnel, 25 club managers, 20 commercial artists, 9 leisure-boat operators, 6 theater directors, 5 cake decorators, 4 bowling alley clerks, 3 tour guides and 1 animal caretaker. Shu Watanabe of the Democratic Party of Japan asks: \"Why does Japan need to pay the costs for US service members' entertainment on their holidays?\" One research on host nations support concludes that the general trend of the South Korean and Japanese alliance burden sharing is towards increase. Increasing the \"economic burdens of the allies\" is one of the major priorities of President Donald Trump.\nClassicist Eric Adler notes that Hanson earlier had written about the decline of the classical studies in the United States and insufficient attention devoted to the classical experience. \"When writing about American foreign policy for a lay audience, however, Hanson himself chose to castigate Roman imperialism in order to portray the modern United States as different from\u2014and superior to\u2014the Roman state.\" As a supporter of a hawkish unilateral American foreign policy, Hanson's \"distinctly negative view of Roman imperialism is particularly noteworthy, since it demonstrates the importance a contemporary supporter of a hawkish American foreign policy places on criticizing Rome.\"\nScholars list many additional parallels with the early \"Pax Romana\" (especially between 189 BC when the supremacy over the Mediterranean was won and the first annexation in 168 BC). By contrast to other empires, the early \"Pax Romana\" did not impose regular taxation on other states. The first good evidence of such a taxation comes from Judea as late as 64 BC. Client states made irregular military or economic contributions in case of the hegemonic campaigns, as is the case under the \"Pax Americana\".\nFormally, client states remained independent and very seldom were called \"clients\". The latter term became widely used only in the late medieval period. Usually, other states were called \"friends and allies\" \u2013 a popular expression under the \"Pax Americana\". Arnold J. Toynbee stressed the similarity of the US alliances with the Roman client system and Ronald Steel cited Toynbee's parallel at length in his book, titled \"Pax Americana\". Nominally independent allies were offered Roman or US protection which, according to Peter Bender, meant their control and limit on other states' sovereignty. Bender, in his 2003 article \"America: The New Roman Empire\", summarized: \"When politicians or professors are in need of a historical comparison in order to illustrate the United States' incredible might, they almost always think of the Roman Empire.\" The article abounds with analogies. The Romans similarly were isolationists until they expanded outside of Italy. The factor for the overseas engagement is the same in both cases: the seas or oceans ceased to offer protection, or so it seemed:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Rome and America both expanded in order to achieve security. Like concentric circles, each circle in need of security demanded the occupation of the next larger circle. The Romans made their way around the Mediterranean, driven from one challenger to their security to the next. The struggles\u00a0... brought the Americans to Europe and East Asia; the Americans soon wound up all over the globe, driven from one attempt at containment to the next. The boundaries between security and power politics gradually blurred. The Romans and Americans both eventually found themselves in a geographical and political position that they had not originally desired, but which they then gladly accepted and firmly maintained.\nBoth Rome and the United States claimed the unlimited right to render their enemies permanently harmless.\" Postwar treatments of Carthage, Macedon, Germany and Japan are similar. \"When they later extended their power to overseas territories, they shied away from assuming direct control wherever possible.\" In the Hellenistic world, Rome withdrew its legions after three wars and instead settled for a role of all-powerful patron and arbitrator. \"World powers without rivals are a class unto themselves. They\u00a0... are quick to call loyal followers friends, or amicus populi Romani. They no longer know any foes, just rebels, terrorists, and rogue states. They no longer fight, merely punish. They no longer wage wars but merely create peace. They are honestly outraged when vassals fail to act as vassals.\" Zbigniew Brzezinski comments on the latter analogy: \"One is tempted to add, they do not invade other countries, they only liberate.\"\nSome scholars deemed Mithridates' massacre of Roman citizens in 88 BC Rome's \"9/11 moment\" and described the ways in which the vicissitudes of contemporary Pax Americana are reminiscent of Rome's reaction to Mithridates' revolt. Robert Fisk used the association to claim that Pax Romana was more cruel than Pax Americana: Following the massacre, the Romans \"crucified their enemies to extinction. Human rights knew no dimensions in ancient Rome.\" Alternatively, Max Ostrovsky defines such conclusions as pre-determined and unrelated to what really happened. No mass crucification occurred. Having defeated Mithridates in 84 BC, Lucius Cornelius Sulla concluded with him peace and recognized him as friend and ally of Rome. No modern ruler would survive having massacred 80,000 American citizens, neither in power nor physically. On the occasion, the tolerance of Pax Romana appears exaggerated by both ancient and modern standards. Cicero (\"De Imperio Cn. Pompei\") wondered how Mithridates was left upon throne and allowed to initiate two more anti-Roman wars. Only after the Third Mithridatic War in 64 BC Pompey finally put an end to his kingship and annexed the rogue Kingdom.\nBesides the books of Vaclav Smil and Peter Bender, a book completely devoted to the comparison between Rome and the United States is \"The Empires of Trust\" by Roman Historian Thomas F. Madden. Madden outlines numerous parallels, many in agreement with Bender, such as beginning of both Empires as frontier societies and following isolationist policy, their later pattern of defensive imperialism, and allying other states rather than conquering them. Besides causes and patterns, he devotes much attention to the analogous results of Pax Romana and Pax Americana. The elimination of external threat leads to decline in internal social harmony.\nThe Roman synchronous establishment of the empire and the fall of the republic is causally linked by almost all writers on the subject, ancient and modern, and the thesis is often applied to the United States. US increasing imperialism and expansionism, modern experts warn, would exert a similar impact. The warning was traditionally repeated by anti-imperialists and isolationists from Mark Twain to Robert A. Taft to Patrick Buchanan and grew louder with the increased intervention during the war on terror from such authors as Chalmers Johnson, Robert Merry, and Michael Vlahos. The distinction of Madden's research is the focus on Pax. The new and bitter civil strife that erupted in Rome and led to the fall of the Republic was a by-product of Pax which paradoxically bears fierce internal divisions. The Romans remained a closely knit group so long as they continued to have powerful outside enemies \u2013 so long as the collective focus of their lives was the defense and preservation of their society.\nThe powerful outside enemies were eliminated by 146 BC. And in 133 BC, violence broke on the Capitoline Hill in Rome. For the first time, the people did not defer to the Senate. And perhaps not anymore. Law was dispensed with and blood began to flow. Romans were killing Romans.\nBoth classics and modern historians stressed the absent external threat as the factor of civil wars in the 1st century BC followed by the fall of the Republic. But Madden seems to be the first scholar to apply the thesis to the United States: \"Do the same dangers await America?\" Writing before the 2021 Capitol attack, he reflects:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCapitol Hill was the city's highest and most revered of the seven hills that made up Rome. Of course, Washington has a Capitol Hill too, named after the Roman one, and which has seen its own share of political fights. But not like this... No blood has yet flowed on America's Capitol Hill, but the Pax Americana is still young.\nIn 146 BC, thirteen years before the first outbreak of civil violence, Rome had eliminated two more external threats (from Carthage and Greece). The United States lost its last grave (Soviet) external threat in 1991. Supposing that we might be in the Roman sequence, where 146 BC corresponds to AD 1991, Madden asks whether the United States has reached the level of Pax that Rome had achieved by 146 BC. His estimation is either yes or very close, but either way external threats will remain too small to wield the pre-1991 national unity.\nThus, America is likely to repeat the Roman sequence and, though writing before 2020, he finds that indeed since 1991 the Americans, like the Romans since 146 BC, have been losing their internal harmony. Without external threats, he says, it is not surprising that we can detect the same turn inward in the United States as well. The dynamics that had bound Americans so closely together gave way to those that bound them together into smaller groups, such as red states and blue states.\nPolitical rivalries under the Pax Romana became fierce \u2013 so fierce that they undermined the fabric of the Republic. The Roman experience suggests that a republic cannot survive such a turmoil. But it was neither the Empire that was at stake, nor the Pax Romana that it brought. Those would remain secure for centuries. It was, instead, the republican form of government that fell. Hence, in worst case, Pax Americana would continue under imperial government.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

CIL instructions are executed by a CIL-compatible runtime environment such as the Common Language Runtime. Languages which target the CLI compile to CIL. CIL is object-oriented, stack-based bytecode. Runtimes typically just-in-time compile CIL instructions into native code.\nCIL was originally known as Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL) during the beta releases of the .NET languages. Due to standardization of C# and the CLI, the bytecode is now officially known as CIL. Windows Defender virus definitions continue to refer to binaries compiled with it as MSIL.\nGeneral information.\nDuring compilation of CLI programming languages, the source code is translated into CIL code rather than into platform- or processor-specific object code. CIL is a CPU- and platform-independent instruction set that can be executed in any environment supporting the Common Language Infrastructure, such as the .NET runtime on Windows, or the cross-platform Mono runtime. In theory, this eliminates the need to distribute different executable files for different platforms and CPU types. CIL code is verified for safety during runtime, providing better security and reliability than natively compiled executable files.\nThe execution process looks like this:\nInstructions.\nCIL bytecode has instructions for the following groups of tasks:\nComputational model.\nThe Common Intermediate Language is object-oriented and stack-based, which means that instruction parameters and results are kept on a single stack instead of in several registers or other memory locations, as in most programming languages.\nCode that adds two numbers in x86 assembly language, where eax and edx specify two different general-purpose registers:\nadd eax, edx\nCode in an intermediate language (IL), where 0 is eax and 1 is edx:\nldloc.0 // push local variable 0 onto stack\nldloc.1 // push local variable 1 onto stack\nadd // pop and add the top two stack items then push the result onto the stack\nstloc.0 // pop and store the top stack item to local variable 0\nIn the latter example, the values of the two registers, eax and edx, are first pushed on the stack. When the add-instruction is called the operands are \"popped\", or retrieved, and the result is \"pushed\", or stored, on the stack. The resulting value is then popped from the stack and stored in eax.\nObject-oriented concepts.\nCIL is designed to be object-oriented. One may create objects, call methods, and use other types of members, such as fields.\nEvery method needs (with some exceptions) to reside in a class. So does this static method:\n.class public Foo {\n .method public static int32 Add(int32, int32) cil managed {\n .maxstack 2\n ldarg.0 // load the first argument;\n ldarg.1 // load the second argument;\n add // add them;\n ret // return the result;\nThe method Add does not require any instance of Foo to be declared because it is declared as static, and it may then be used like this in C#:\nint r = Foo.Add(2, 3); // 5\nIn CIL it would look like this:\nldc.i4.2\nldc.i4.3\ncall int32 Foo::Add(int32, int32)\nstloc.0\nInstance classes.\nAn instance class contains at least one constructor and some instance members. The following class has a set of methods representing actions of a Car-object.\n.class public Car {\n .method public specialname rtspecialname instance void .ctor(int32, int32) cil managed {\n /* Constructor */\nCreating objects.\nIn C# class instances are created like this:\nCar myCar = new Car(1, 4); \nCar yourCar = new Car(1, 3); \nAnd those statements are roughly the same as these instructions in CIL:\nldc.i4.1\nldc.i4.4\nnewobj instance void Car::.ctor(int32, int32)\nstloc.0 // myCar = new Car(1, 4);\nldc.i4.1\nldc.i4.3\nnewobj instance void Car::.ctor(int32, int32)\nstloc.1 // yourCar = new Car(1, 3);\nInvoking instance methods.\nInstance methods are invoked in C# as the one that follows:\nmyCar.Move(3);\nAs invoked in CIL:\nldloc.0 // Load the object \"myCar\" on the stack\nldc.i4.3\ncall instance void Car::Move(int32)\nMetadata.\nThe Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) records information about compiled classes as metadata. Like the type library in the Component Object Model, this enables applications to support and discover the interfaces, classes, types, methods, and fields in the assembly. The process of reading such metadata is called \"reflection\".\nMetadata can be data in the form of \"attributes\". Attributes can be customized by extending the codice_1 class. This is a powerful feature. It allows the creator of the class the ability to adorn it with extra information that consumers of the class can use in various meaningful ways, depending on the application domain.\nExample.\nBelow is a basic \"Hello, World!\" program written in CIL assembler. It will display the string \"Hello, world!\".\n.method static void Main()\n .entrypoint\n .maxstack 1\n ldstr \"Hello, world!\"\n call void [mscorlib]System.Console::WriteLine(string)\n ret\nThe following code is more complex in number of opcodes.\n\"This code can also be compared with the corresponding code in the article about Java bytecode.\"\nstatic void Main(string[] args)\n for (int i = 2; i &lt; 1000; i++)\n for (int j = 2; j &lt; i; j++)\n if (i % j == 0)\n goto outer;\n Console.WriteLine(i);\n outer:;\nIn CIL assembler syntax it looks like this:\n.method private hidebysig static void Main(string[] args) cil managed\n .entrypoint\n .maxstack 2\n .locals init (int32 V_0,\n int32 V_1)\n ldc.i4.2\n stloc.0\n br.s IL_001f\n IL_0004: ldc.i4.2\n stloc.1\n br.s IL_0011\n IL_0008: ldloc.0\n ldloc.1\n rem\n brfalse.s IL_001b\n ldloc.1\n ldc.i4.1\n add\n stloc.1\n IL_0011: ldloc.1\n ldloc.0\n blt.s IL_0008\n ldloc.0\n call void [mscorlib]System.Console::WriteLine(int32)\n IL_001b: ldloc.0\n ldc.i4.1\n add\n stloc.0\n IL_001f: ldloc.0\n ldc.i4 0x3e8\n blt.s IL_0004\n ret\nThis is just a representation of how CIL looks near the virtual machine (VM) level. When compiled the methods are stored in tables and the instructions are stored as bytes inside the assembly, which is a Portable Executable (PE).\nGeneration.\nA CIL assembly and instructions are generated by either a compiler or a utility called the \"IL Assembler\" (ILAsm) that is shipped with the execution environment.\nAssembled CIL can also be disassembled into code again using the \"IL Disassembler\" (ILDASM). There are other tools such as .NET Reflector that can decompile CIL into a high-level language (e.\u00a0g. C# or Visual Basic). This makes CIL a very easy target for reverse engineering. This trait is shared with Java bytecode. However, there are tools that can obfuscate the code, and do it so that the code cannot be easily readable but still be runnable.\nExecution.\nJust-in-time compilation.\nJust-in-time compilation (JIT) involves turning the byte-code into code immediately executable by the CPU. The conversion is performed gradually during the program's execution. JIT compilation provides environment-specific optimization, runtime type safety, and assembly verification. To accomplish this, the JIT compiler examines the assembly metadata for any illegal accesses and handles violations appropriately.\nAhead-of-time compilation.\nCLI-compatible execution environments also come with the option to do an Ahead-of-time compilation (AOT) of an assembly to make it execute faster by removing the JIT process at runtime.\nIn the .NET Framework there is a special tool called the Native Image Generator (NGEN) that performs the AOT. A different approach for AOT is CoreRT that allows the compilation of .Net Core code to a single executable with no dependency on a runtime. In Mono there is also an option to do an AOT.\nPointer instructions - C++/CLI.\nA notable difference from Java's bytecode is that CIL comes with , , , and many call instructions which are enough for data/function pointers manipulation needed to compile C/C++ code into CIL.\nclass A {\nvoid test_pointer_operations(int param) {\n int k = 0;\n int * ptr = &amp;k;\n *ptr = 1;\n ptr = &amp;param;\n *ptr = 2;\n A a;\n A * ptra = &amp;a;\n ptra-&gt;meth();\nThe corresponding code in CIL can be rendered as this:\n.method assembly static void modopt([mscorlib]System.Runtime.CompilerServices.CallConvCdecl) \n test_pointer_operations(int32 param) cil managed\n .vtentry 1 : 1\n // Code size 44 (0x2c)\n .maxstack 2\n .locals ([0] int32* ptr,\n [1] valuetype A* V_1,\n [2] valuetype A* a,\n [3] int32 k)\n// k = 0;\n IL_0000: ldc.i4.0 \n IL_0001: stloc.3\n// ptr = &amp;k;\n IL_0002: ldloca.s k // load local's address instruction\n IL_0004: stloc.0\n// *ptr = 1;\n IL_0005: ldloc.0\n IL_0006: ldc.i4.1\n IL_0007: stind.i4 // indirection instruction\n// ptr = &amp;param\n IL_0008: ldarga.s param // load parameter's address instruction\n IL_000a: stloc.0\n// *ptr = 2\n IL_000b: ldloc.0\n IL_000c: ldc.i4.2\n IL_000d: stind.i4\n// a = new A;\n IL_000e: ldloca.s a\n IL_0010: call valuetype A* modopt([mscorlib]System.Runtime.CompilerServices.CallConvThiscall) 'A.{ctor}'(valuetype A* modopt([mscorlib]System.Runtime.CompilerServices.IsConst) modopt([mscorlib]System.Runtime.CompilerServices.IsConst))\n IL_0015: pop\n// ptra = &amp;a;\n IL_0016: ldloca.s a\n IL_0018: stloc.1\n// ptra-&gt;meth();\n IL_0019: ldloc.1\n IL_001a: dup\n IL_001b: ldind.i4 // reading the VMT for virtual call\n IL_001c: ldind.i4\n IL_001d: calli unmanaged stdcall void modopt([mscorlib]System.Runtime.CompilerServices.CallConvStdcall)(native int)\n IL_0022: ret\n} // end of method 'Global Functions'::test_pointer_operations\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "46006", "revid": "33583126", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46006", "title": "Freedom of religion", "text": "Human right to practice, or not, a religion without conflict from governing powers\nFreedom of religion or religious liberty, also known as freedom of religion or belief (FoRB), is a principle that supports the freedom of an individual or community, in public or private, to manifest religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship, and observance. It also includes the right not to profess any religion or belief or not to practice a religion, often called freedom from religion.\nFreedom of religion is considered by many people and most nations to be a fundamental human right. Freedom of religion is protected in all the most important international human rights conventions, such as the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the American Convention on Human Rights, the European Convention on Human Rights, and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. In a country with a state religion, freedom of religion is generally considered to mean that the government permits religious practices of other communities besides the state religion, and does not persecute believers in other faiths or those who have no faith. The concept of religious liberty includes, and some say requires, secular liberalism, and excludes authoritarian versions of secularism.\nFreedom of religion includes, at a minimum, \"freedom of belief\" (the right to believe whatever a person, group, or religion wishes, including all forms of irreligion, such as atheism, humanism, existentialism, or other forms of \"non-belief\"), but some feel freedom of religion must include \"freedom of practice\" (the right to practice a religion or belief openly and outwardly in a public manner, including the right not to practice any religion). A third term, \"freedom of worship\", may be considered synonymous with both \"freedom of belief\" and \"freedom of practice\" or may be considered to fall between the two terms.\nCrucial in the consideration of religious liberty is the question of whether religious practices and religiously motivated actions that would otherwise violate secular law should be permitted due to the safeguarding freedom of religion. This issue is addressed in numerous court cases, including the United States Supreme Court cases \"Reynolds v. United States\" and \"Wisconsin v. Yoder\", and in the European law cases of \"S.A.S. v. France\", as well as numerous other jurisdictions.\nSymbols of religious freedom are seen in significant locations around the world, such as the Statue of Liberty in New York, representing hope for religious refugees; the Bevis Marks Synagogue in London, which dates from 1701 and is the oldest continuously active synagogue in Europe; and the Golden Temple in Amritsar, India, a symbol of religious inclusivity and freedom of worship. Other key sites include the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Gardens in Haifa, Israel, which emphasize the unity of humanity and freedom of belief, and Lutherstadt Wittenberg in Germany, where Martin Luther's actions sparked the Reformation, symbolizing a fight for religious reform and liberty.\nHistory.\nIn a historic setting freedom to worship has often been limited in practice through punitive taxation, repressive social legislation, and political disenfranchisement. An example commonly cited by scholars is the status of dhimmis under Islamic sharia law. Stemming from the Pact of Umar and literally meaning \"protected individuals\", it is often argued that non-Muslims possessing the dhimmi status in medieval Islamic societies enjoyed greater freedoms than non-Christians in most medieval European societies, while duly noting that the protection was limited because of regulation by and obligations to government such as taxation (compare jizya and zakat) and military service differed between religions. In modern concepts of religious freedom, the law is usually blind to religious affiliation.\nIn Antiquity, a syncretic point of view often allowed communities of traders to operate under their own customs. When street mobs of separate quarters clashed in a Hellenistic or Roman city, the issue was generally perceived to be an infringement of community rights.\nCyrus the Great established the Achaemenid Empire ca. 550 BC, and initiated a general policy of permitting religious freedom throughout the empire, documenting this on the Cyrus Cylinder.\nFreedom of religious worship was established in the Buddhist Maurya Empire of ancient India by Ashoka the Great in the 3rd century BC, which was encapsulated in the Edicts of Ashoka.\nGreek\u2013Jewish clashes at Cyrene in 73 AD and 117 AD and in Alexandria in 115 AD provide examples of cosmopolitan cities as scenes of tumult.\nGenghis Khan was one of the first rulers who in 13th century enacted a law explicitly guaranteeing religious freedom to everyone and every religion.\nAncient Roman policy.\nThe Romans tolerated most religions, including Judaism, and encouraged local subjects to continue worshipping their own gods. They did not, however, tolerate Christianity because of the Christian refusal to offer honours to the official cult of the emperor until it was legalised by the Roman emperor Galerius in 311. Holmes and Bickers note that as long as Christianity was treated as a part of Judaism, which was generally tolerated because of its antiquity and its practice of making offers on \"behalf\" of the emperor, it enjoyed the same freedom, but the Christian claim to religious exclusivity meant its followers found themselves subject to hostility.\nThe early Christian apologist Tertullian was the first-known writer to employ the term \"freedom of religion\" (\"libertas religionis\"), which appears in the 24th chapter of his Apologeticum. He expanded on the case for the tolerance of all religious views in his epistle to proconsul Scapula, in which he states\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[I]t is a human right [(\"humanis ius\")], a privilege of nature [(\"naturalis potestas\")], that every man should worship according to his own convictions: one man's religion neither harms nor helps another man. It is assuredly no part of religion to compel religion\u2014to which free-will and not force should lead us\nThe Edict of Milan guaranteed freedom of religion in the Roman Empire until the Edict of Thessalonica in 380, which outlawed all religions except Christianity.\nIndia.\nReligious tolerance in India: A legacy of the past and a promise for the future\nAncient Jews fleeing from persecution in their homeland 2,500 years ago settled in modern-day India and never faced anti-Semitism. Freedom of religion edicts have been found written during Ashoka the Great's reign in the 3rd century BC. Freedom to practise, preach and propagate any religion is a constitutional right in Republic of India. Most major religious festivals of the main communities are included in the list of national holidays.\nMany scholars and intellectuals believe that India's predominant religion, Hinduism, has long been a most tolerant religion. Rajni Kothari, founder of the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies has written, \"[India] is a country built on the foundations of a civilisation that is fundamentally non-religious.\"\nThe Dalai Lama, the Tibetan leader in exile, said that religious tolerance of 'Aryabhoomi,' a reference to India found in the Mahabharata, has been in existence in this country from thousands of years. \"Not only Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, Sikhism which are the native religions but also Christianity and Islam have flourished here. Religious tolerance is inherent in Indian tradition,\" the Dalai Lama said.\nFreedom of religion in the Indian subcontinent is exemplified by the reign of King Piyadasi (304\u2013232 BC) (Ashoka). One of King Ashoka's main concerns was to reform governmental institutes and exercise moral principles in his attempt to create a just and humane society. Later he promoted the principles of Buddhism, and the creation of a just, understanding and fair society was held as an important principle for many ancient rulers of this time in the East.\nThe importance of freedom of worship in India was encapsulated in an inscription of Ashoka:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;King Piyadasi (Ashok) dear to the Gods, honours all sects, the ascetics (hermits) or those who dwell at home, he honours them with charity and in other ways. But the King, dear to the Gods, attributes less importance to this charity and these honours than to the vow of seeing the reign of virtues, which constitutes the essential part of them. For all these virtues there is a common source, modesty of speech. That is to say, one must not exalt one's creed discrediting all others, nor must one degrade these others without legitimate reasons. One must, on the contrary, render to other creeds the honour befitting them.\nOn the main Asian continent, the Mongols were tolerant of religions. People could worship as they wished freely and openly.\nAfter the arrival of Europeans, Christians in their zeal to convert local as per belief in conversion as service of God, have also been seen to fall into frivolous methods since their arrival, though by and large there are hardly any reports of law and order disturbance from mobs with Christian beliefs, except perhaps in the north eastern region of India.\nFreedom of religion in contemporary India is a fundamental right guaranteed under Article 25 of the nation's constitution. Accordingly, every citizen of India has a right to profess, practice and propagate their religions peacefully.\nIn September 2010, the Indian state of Kerala's State Election Commissioner announced that \"Religious heads cannot issue calls to vote for members of a particular community or to defeat the nonbelievers\". The Catholic Church comprising Latin, Syro-Malabar and Syro-Malankara rites used to give clear directions to the faithful on exercising their franchise during elections through pastoral letters issued by bishops or council of bishops. The pastoral letter issued by Kerala Catholic Bishops' Council (KCBC) on the eve of the poll urged the faithful to shun atheists.\nEurope.\nReligious intolerance.\nMost Roman Catholic kingdoms kept a tight rein on religious expression throughout the Middle Ages. Jews were alternately tolerated and persecuted, the most notable examples of the latter being the expulsion of all Jews from Spain in 1492. Some of those who remained and converted were tried as heretics in the Inquisition for allegedly practicing Judaism in secret. Despite the persecution of Jews, they were the most tolerated non-Catholic faith in Europe.\nHowever, the latter was in part a reaction to the growing movement that became the Reformation. As early as 1380, John Wycliffe in England denied transubstantiation and began his translation of the Bible into English. He was condemned in a papal bull in 1410, and all his books were burned.\nIn 1414, Jan Hus, a Bohemian preacher of reformation, was given a safe conduct by the Holy Roman Emperor to attend the Council of Constance. Not entirely trusting in his safety, he made his will before he left. His forebodings proved accurate, and he was burned at the stake on 6 July 1415. The council also decreed that Wycliffe's remains be disinterred and cast out. This decree was not carried out until 1429.\nAfter the fall of the city of Granada, Spain, in 1492, the Muslim population was promised religious freedom by the Treaty of Granada, but that promise was short-lived. In 1501, Granada's Muslims were given an ultimatum to either convert to Christianity or to emigrate. The majority converted, but only superficially, continuing to dress and speak as they had before and to secretly practice Islam. The Moriscos (converts to Christianity) were ultimately expelled from Spain between 1609 (Castile) and 1614 (rest of Spain), by Philip III.\nMartin Luther published his famous 95 Theses in Wittenberg on 31 October 1517. His major aim was theological, summed up in the three basic dogmas of Protestantism:\nIn consequence, Luther hoped to stop the sale of indulgences and to reform the Church from within. In 1521, he was given the chance to recant at the Diet of Worms before Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. After he refused to recant, he was declared heretic. Partly for his own protection, he was sequestered on the Wartburg in the possessions of Frederick III, Elector of Saxony, where he translated the New Testament into German. He was excommunicated by papal bull in 1521.\nHowever, the movement continued to gain ground in his absence and spread to Switzerland. Huldrych Zwingli preached reform in Z\u00fcrich from 1520 to 1523. He opposed the sale of indulgences, celibacy, pilgrimages, pictures, statues, relics, altars, and organs. This culminated in outright war between the Swiss cantons that accepted Protestantism and the Catholics. In 1531, the Catholics were victorious, and Zwingli was killed in battle. The Catholic cantons made peace with Zurich and Berne.\nThe defiance of papal authority proved contagious, and in 1533, when Henry VIII of England was excommunicated for his divorce and remarriage to Anne Boleyn, he promptly established a state church with bishops appointed by the crown. This was not without internal opposition, and Thomas More, who had been his Lord Chancellor, was executed in 1535 for opposition to Henry.\nIn 1535, the Swiss canton of Geneva became Protestant. In 1536, the Bernese imposed the reformation on the canton of Vaud by conquest. They sacked the cathedral in Lausanne and destroyed all its art and statuary. John Calvin, who had been active in Geneva was expelled in 1538 in a power struggle, but he was invited back in 1540.\nThe same kind of seesaw back and forth between Protestantism and Catholicism was evident in England when Mary I of England returned that country briefly to the Catholic fold in 1553 and persecuted Protestants. However, her half-sister, Elizabeth I of England was to restore the Church of England in 1558, this time permanently, and began to persecute Catholics again. The King James Bible commissioned by King James I of England and published in 1611 proved a landmark for Protestant worship, with official Catholic forms of worship being banned.\nIn France, although peace was made between Protestants and Catholics at the Peace of Saint-Germain-en-Laye in 1570, persecution continued, most notably in the Massacre of Saint Bartholomew's Day on 24 August 1572, in which thousands of Protestants throughout France were killed. A few years before, at the \"Michelade\" of N\u00eemes in 1567, Protestants had massacred the local Catholic clergy.\nEarly steps and attempts in the way of tolerance.\nThe Norman Kingdom of Sicily under Roger II was characterized by its multi-ethnic nature and religious tolerance. Normans, Jews, Muslim Arabs, Byzantine Greeks, Lombards, and native Sicilians lived in harmony. Rather than exterminate the Muslims of Sicily, Roger II's grandson Emperor Frederick II of Hohenstaufen (1215\u20131250) allowed them to settle on the mainland and build mosques. Not least, he enlisted them in his\u00a0\u2013 Christian\u00a0\u2013 army and even into his personal bodyguards.\nKingdom of Bohemia (present-day Czech Republic) enjoyed religious freedom between 1436 and 1620 as a result of the Bohemian Reformation, and became one of the most liberal countries of the Christian world during that period of time. The so-called Basel Compacts of 1436 declared the freedom of religion and peace between Catholics and Utraquists. In 1609 Emperor Rudolf II granted Bohemia greater religious liberty with his Letter of Majesty. The privileged position of the Catholic Church in the Czech kingdom was firmly established after the Battle of White Mountain in 1620. Gradually freedom of religion in Bohemian lands came to an end and Protestants fled or were expelled from the country. A devout Catholic, Emperor Ferdinand II forcibly converted Austrian and Bohemian Protestants.\nIn the meantime, in Germany Philip Melanchthon drafted the Augsburg Confession as a common confession for the Lutherans and the free territories. It was presented to Charles V in 1530.\nIn the Holy Roman Empire, Charles V agreed to tolerate Lutheranism in 1555 at the Peace of Augsburg. Each state was to take the religion of its prince, but within those states, there was not necessarily religious tolerance. Citizens of other faiths could relocate to a more hospitable environment.\nIn France, from the 1550s, many attempts to reconcile Catholics and Protestants and to establish tolerance failed because the State was too weak to enforce them. It took the victory of prince Henry IV of France, who had converted into Protestantism, and his accession to the throne, to impose religious tolerance formalized in the Edict of Nantes in 1598. It would remain in force for over 80 years until its revocation in 1685 by Louis XIV of France. Intolerance remained the norm until Louis XVI, who signed the Edict of Versailles (1787), then the constitutional text of 24 December 1789, granting civilian rights to Protestants. The French Revolution then abolished state religion and the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen (1789) guarantees freedom of religion, as long as religious activities do not infringe on public order in ways detrimental to society.\nEarly laws and legal guarantees for religious freedom.\nPrincipality of Transylvania.\nIn 1558, the Hungarian Diet's Edict of Torda declared free practice of both Catholicism and Lutheranism. Calvinism, however, was prohibited. Calvinism was included among the accepted religions in 1564. Ten years after the first law, in 1568, the same Diet, under the chairmanship of King of Hungary, and Prince of Transylvania John Sigismund Z\u00e1polya (John II), following the teaching of Ferenc D\u00e1vid, the founder of the Unitarian Church of Transylvania, extended the freedom to all religions, declaring that \"It is not allowed to anybody to intimidate anybody with captivity or expelling for his religion\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Act of Religious Tolerance and Freedom of Conscience:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\"His majesty, our Lord, in what manner he\u00a0\u2013 together with his realm\u00a0\u2013 legislated in the matter of religion at the previous Diets, in the same matter now, in this Diet, reaffirms that in every place the preachers shall preach and explain the Gospel each according to his understanding of it, and if the congregation like it, well. If not, no one shall compel them for their souls would not be satisfied, but they shall be permitted to keep a preacher whose teaching they approve. Therefore none of the superintendents or others shall abuse the preachers, no one shall be reviled for his religion by anyone, according to the previous statutes, and it is not permitted that anyone should threaten anyone else by imprisonment or by removal from his post for his teaching. For faith is the gift of God and this comes from hearing, which hearings is by the word of God\".\nAfter hearing learned debate on the matter, King Sigismund ruled that society did not have the power to stifle religious expression. The lack of state religion was unique for centuries in Europe, and the Edict of Torda is considered as the first legal guarantee of religious freedom in Christian Europe.\nFour religions (Catholicism, Lutheranism, Calvinism, Unitarianism) were named as accepted religions (religo recepta), having their representatives in the Transylvanian Diet, while the other religions, like the Orthodoxs, Sabbatarians and Anabaptists were tolerated churches (religio tolerata), which meant that they had no power in the law making and no veto rights in the Diet, but they were not persecuted in any way. Thanks to the Edict of Torda, from the last decades of the 16th century Transylvania was the only place in Europe, where so many religions could live together in harmony and without persecution.\nThis religious freedom ended however for some of the religions of Transylvania in 1638. After this year the Sabbatarians began to be persecuted and forced to convert to one of the accepted Christian religions of Transylvania.\nHabsburg rule in Transylvania.\nThe Unitarians (despite being one of the \"accepted religions\") started to be put under an ever-growing pressure, which culminated after the Habsburg conquest of Transylvania (1691), Also after the Habsburg occupation, the new Austrian masters forced in the middle of the 18th century the Hutterite Anabaptists (who found a safe haven in 1621 in Transylvania, after the persecution to which they were subjected in the Austrian provinces and Moravia) to convert to Catholicism or to migrate in another country, which finally the Anabaptists did, leaving Transylvania and Hungary for Wallachia, then from there to Russia, and finally in the United States.\nNetherlands.\nIn the Union of Utrecht (20 January 1579), personal freedom of religion was declared in the struggle between the Northern Netherlands and Spain. The Union of Utrecht was an important step in the establishment of the Dutch Republic (from 1581 to 1795). Under Calvinist leadership, the Netherlands became the most tolerant country in Europe. It granted asylum to persecuted religious minorities, such as the Huguenots, the Dissenters, and the Jews who had been expelled from Spain and Portugal. The establishment of a Jewish community in the Netherlands and New Amsterdam (present-day New York) during the Dutch Republic is an example of religious freedom. When New Amsterdam surrendered to the English in 1664, freedom of religion was guaranteed in the Articles of Capitulation. It benefitted also the Jews who had landed on Manhattan Island in 1654, fleeing Portuguese persecution in Brazil. During the 18th century, other Jewish communities were established in Newport, Rhode Island, Philadelphia, Charleston, Savannah, and Richmond.\nIntolerance of dissident forms of Protestantism also continued, as evidenced by the exodus of the Pilgrims, who sought refuge, first in the Netherlands, and ultimately in America, founding Plymouth Colony in Massachusetts in 1620. William Penn, the founder of Philadelphia, was involved in a case which had a profound effect on future American laws and those of England. In a classic case of jury nullification, the jury refused to convict William Penn of preaching a Quaker sermon, which was illegal. Even though the jury was imprisoned for their acquittal, they stood by their decision and helped establish the freedom of religion.\nPoland.\nThe General Charter of Jewish Liberties known as the Statute of Kalisz was issued by the Duke of Greater Poland Boleslaus the Pious on 8 September 1264 in Kalisz. The statute served as the basis for the legal position of Jews in Poland and led to the creation of the Yiddish-speaking autonomous Jewish nation until 1795. The statute granted exclusive jurisdiction of Jewish courts over Jewish matters and established a separate tribunal for matters involving Christians and Jews. Additionally, it guaranteed personal liberties and safety for Jews including freedom of religion, travel, and trade. The statute was ratified by subsequent Polish Kings: Casimir III of Poland in 1334, Casimir IV of Poland in 1453 and Sigismund I of Poland in 1539. Poland freed Jews from direct royal authority, opening up enormous administrative and economic opportunities to them.\nPolish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth.\nThe right to worship freely was a basic right given to all inhabitants of the future Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth throughout the 15th and early 16th century, however, complete freedom of religion was officially recognized in 1573 during the Warsaw Confederation. Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth kept religious freedom laws during an era when religious persecution was an everyday occurrence in the rest of Europe.\nUnited States.\nMost of the New England Colonies in British Colonial America were generally not tolerant of dissident forms of worship. For example, Roger Williams found it necessary to found a new colony in Rhode Island to escape persecution in the theocratically dominated colony of Massachusetts. The Puritans of the Massachusetts Bay Colony were the most active of the New England persecutors of Quakers, and the persecuting spirit was shared by Plymouth Colony and the colonies along the Connecticut River. Enforcing religious and intellectual homogeneity on the whole community, the civil and religious restrictions practiced by the Puritans of Massachusetts were more rigorous than those imposed on the Puritans in England, with various banishments applied to enforce conformity including the branding iron, the whipping post, the bilboes and the hangman's noose. In 1660, one of the most notable victims was an English Quaker Mary Dyer, who was hanged in Boston, Massachusetts for repeatedly defying a Puritan law banning Quakers from the colony. As one of the four executed Quakers known as the Boston martyrs, the hanging of Dyer on the Boston gallows marked the beginning of the end of the Puritan theocracy and New England independence from English rule, and in 1661 King Charles II explicitly forbade Massachusetts from executing anyone for professing Quakerism. Anti-Catholic sentiment appeared in New England with the first Pilgrim and Puritan settlers. In 1647, Massachusetts passed a law prohibiting any Jesuit Roman Catholic priests from entering territory under Puritan jurisdiction. Any suspected person who could not clear himself was to be banished from the colony; a second offense carried a death penalty. The Pilgrims of New England held radical Protestant disapproval of Christmas. Christmas observance was outlawed in Boston in 1659. The ban by the Puritans was revoked in 1681 by an English appointed governor, however, it was not until the mid-19th century that celebrating Christmas became common in the Boston region.\nFreedom of religion was first applied as a principle of government in the founding of the colony of Maryland, founded by the Catholic Lord Baltimore, in 1634. Fifteen years later (1649), the Maryland Toleration Act, drafted by Lord Baltimore, provided: \"No person or persons...shall from henceforth be any way troubled, molested or discountenanced for or in respect of his or her religion nor in the free exercise thereof.\" The Act allowed freedom of worship for all Trinitarian Christians in Maryland, but sentenced to death anyone who denied the divinity of Jesus. The Maryland Toleration Act was repealed during the Cromwellian Era with the assistance of Protestant assemblymen and a new law barring Catholics from openly practicing their religion was passed. In 1657, the Catholic Lord Baltimore regained control after making a deal with the colony's Protestants, and in 1658 the Act was again passed by the colonial assembly. This time, it would last more than thirty years, until 1692 when, after Maryland's Protestant Revolution of 1689, freedom of religion was again rescinded. In addition, in 1704, an Act was passed \"to prevent the growth of Popery in this Province\", preventing Catholics from holding political office.\nRhode Island (1636), Connecticut (1636), New Jersey, and Pennsylvania (1682)\u00a0\u2013 founded by Protestants Roger Williams, Thomas Hooker, and William Penn, respectively\u00a0\u2013 combined the democratic form of government which had been developed by the Puritans and the Separatist Congregationalists in Massachusetts with religious freedom. These colonies became sanctuaries for persecuted religious minorities. Catholics and, later on, Jews also had full citizenship and free exercise of their religions. Williams, Hooker, Penn, and their friends were firmly convinced that freedom of conscience was the will of God. Williams gave the most profound argument: As faith is the free work of the Holy Spirit, it cannot be forced on a person. Therefore, strict separation of church and state has to be kept. Pennsylvania was the only colony that retained unlimited religious freedom until the foundation of the United States in 1776. It was the inseparable connection between democracy, religious freedom, and other forms of freedom which became the political and legal basis of the new nation. In particular, Baptists and Presbyterians demanded the disestablishment of state churches\u00a0\u2013 Anglican and Congregationalist\u00a0\u2013 and the protection of religious freedom.\nReiterating Maryland's and the other colonies' earlier colonial legislation, the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, written in 1779 by Thomas Jefferson, proclaimed:\n[N]o man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship, place, or ministry whatsoever, nor shall be enforced, restrained, molested, or burthened in his body or goods, nor shall otherwise suffer, on account of his religious opinions or belief; but that all men shall be free to profess, and by argument to maintain, their opinions in matters of religion, and that the same shall in no wise diminish, enlarge, or affect their civil capacities.\nThose sentiments also found expression in the First Amendment of the national constitution, part of the United States' Bill of Rights: \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof...\". The acknowledgement of religious freedom as the first right protected in the Bill of Rights points toward the American founders' understanding of the importance of religion to human, social, and political flourishing. The First Amendment makes clear that it sought to protect \"the free exercise\" of religion, or what might be called \"free exercise equality.\"\nThe United States formally considers religious freedom in its foreign relations. The International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 established the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom which investigates the records of over 200 other nations with respect to religious freedom, and makes recommendations to submit nations with egregious records to ongoing scrutiny and possible economic sanctions. Many human rights organizations have urged the United States to be still more vigorous in imposing sanctions on countries that do not permit or tolerate religious freedom.\nCanada.\nFreedom of religion in Canada is a constitutionally protected right, allowing believers the freedom to assemble and worship without limitation or interference. Canadian law goes further, requiring that private citizens and companies provide reasonable accommodation to those, for example, with strong religious beliefs. The Canadian Human Rights Act allows an exception to reasonable accommodation with respect to religious dress, such as a Sikh turban, when there is a \"bona fide\" occupational requirement, such as a workplace requiring a hard hat. In 2017 the Santo Daime Church C\u00e9u do Montr\u00e9al received religious exemption to use Ayahuasca as a sacrament in their rituals.\nChildren's rights.\nThe law in Germany includes the concept of \"religious maturity\" (\"Religi\u00f6se M\u00fcndigkeit\") with a minimum age for minors to follow their own religious beliefs even if their parents don't share those or don't approve. Children 14 and older have the unrestricted right to enter or exit any religious community. Children 12 and older cannot be compelled to change to a different belief. Children 10 and older have to be heard before their parents change their religious upbringing to a different belief. There are similar laws in Austria and in Switzerland.\nInternational.\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights declares that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance.\nOn 25 November 1981, the United Nations General Assembly passed the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief. This declaration recognizes freedom of religion as a fundamental human right in accordance with several other instruments of international law.\nHowever, the most substantial binding legal instruments that guarantee the right to freedom of religion that was passed by the international community is the Convention on the Rights of the Child which states in its Article 14: \"States Parties shall respect the right of the child to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.\u00a0\u2013 States Parties shall respect the rights and duties of the parents and, when applicable, legal guardians, to provide direction to the child in the exercise of his or her right in a manner consistent with the evolving capacities of the child.\u00a0\u2013 Freedom to manifest one's religion or beliefs may be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary to protect public safety, order, health or morals, or the fundamental rights and freedoms of others.\"\nThere exists a United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief.\nRight to change religion.\nPart of religious freedom is the right of an individual to change or abandon his or her own religion. Religious conversion is criminalized as apostasy in some countries.\nIn 2008, Christian Solidarity Worldwide, a Christian human rights non-governmental organisation which specializes in religious freedom, launched an in-depth report on the human rights abuses faced by individuals who leave Islam for another religion. The report is the product of a year long research project in six countries. It calls on Muslim nations, the international community, the UN and the international media to resolutely address the serious violations of human rights suffered by apostates.\nRight to proselytize.\nPart of the freedom of religion is the right to proselytize, seeking to convince others to convert to a religion. Some debates have centered around restricting certain kinds of missionary activity by religions. Proselytism by foreign citizens has been restricted as a foreign intervention in line with Article 18 of International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Many Islamic states, and others such as China, severely restrict missionary activities of other religions. Greece, among European countries, has generally looked unfavorably on missionary activities of denominations others than the majority church and proselytizing is constitutionally prohibited. \nA critique of the freedom to propagate religion has come from non-Abrahamic traditions such as the African and Indian. African scholar Makau Mutua criticizes religious evangelism on the ground of cultural annihilation by what he calls \"proselytizing universalist faiths\" (Chapter 28: Proselytism and Cultural Integrity, p.\u00a0652):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSome Indian scholars have similarly argued that the right to propagate religion is not culturally or religiously neutral. In Sri Lanka, there have been debates regarding a bill on religious freedom that seeks to protect indigenous religious traditions from certain kinds of missionary activities. Debates have also occurred in various states of India regarding similar laws, particularly those that restrict conversions using force, fraud or allurement.\nFreedom from religion.\nA core element of freedom of religion is the freedom not to practice religion. This is often called \"Freedom from religion\". Various charities work to promote this right including the ACLU, and American United. The Satanic Temple is famous and infamous for their official unbaptism rituals. There is also a group named after the concept, the Freedom From Religion Foundation. A similar concept is irreligious organizations.\nContemporary debates.\nTheistic, non-theistic and atheistic beliefs.\nIn 1993, the UN's human rights committee declared that article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights \"protects theistic, non-theistic and atheistic beliefs, as well as the right not to profess any religion or belief.\" The committee further stated that \"the freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief necessarily entails the freedom to choose a religion or belief, including the right to replace one's current religion or belief with another or to adopt atheistic views.\" Signatories to the convention are barred from \"the use of threat of physical force or penal sanctions to compel believers or non-believers\" to recant their beliefs or convert. Despite this, minority religions still are persecuted in many parts of the world.\nNon-religious people.\nIn 2012, the organizations American Humanist Association, Center for Inquiry, Humanists International, Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science and Secular Coalition for America worked together on a joint report: the \"2012 Report on Discrimination Against Atheists, Humanists and the Non-Religious\". In December, on Human Rights Day, Humanists International launched a new edition for an international audience: \"Freedom of Thought 2012: A Global Report on Discrimination against Humanists, Atheists and the Non-Religious\". It is now called \"The Freedom of Thought Report\" and examines every country in the world for its record on upholding the rights and equality for non-religious people.\nSecular liberalism.\nThe French philosopher Voltaire noted in his book on English society, \"Letters on the English\" (1733), that freedom of religion in a diverse society was deeply important to maintaining peace in that country. It was also important to understand why England at that time was more prosperous in comparison to the country's less religiously tolerant European neighbours. Take a view of the Royal Exchange in London, a place more venerable than many courts of justice, where the representatives of all nations meet for the benefit of mankind. There the Jew, the Mahometan [Muslim], and the Christian transact together, as though they all professed the same religion, and give the name of infidel to none but bankrupts. There the Presbyterian confides in the Anabaptist, and the Churchman depends on the Quaker's word. If one religion only were allowed in England, the Government would very possibly become arbitrary; if there were but two, the people would cut one another\u2019s throats; but as there are such a multitude, they all live happy and in peace.Adam Smith, in his book \"The Wealth of Nations\" (using an argument first put forward by his friend and contemporary David Hume), states that in the long run it is in the best interests of society as a whole and the civil magistrate (government) in particular to allow people to freely choose their own religion, as it helps prevent civil unrest and reduces intolerance. So long as there are enough religions and/or religious sects operating freely in a society then they are all compelled to moderate their more controversial and violent teachings, so as to be more appealing to more people and so have an easier time attracting new converts. It is this free competition amongst religious sects for converts that ensures stability and tranquillity in the long run.\nSmith also points out that laws that prevent religious freedom and seek to preserve the power and belief in a particular religion will, in the long run, only serve to weaken and corrupt that religion, as its leaders and preachers become complacent, disconnected and unpractised in their ability to seek and win over new converts:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSecular law.\nReligious practice may also conflict with secular law, creating debates on religious freedom. For instance, even though polygamy is permitted in Islam, it is prohibited in secular law in many countries. This raises the question of whether prohibiting the practice infringes on the beliefs of certain Muslims. The US and India, both constitutionally secular nations, have taken two views of this. In India, polygamy is permitted, but only for Muslims, under Muslim Personal Law. In the US, polygamy is prohibited for all. This was a major source of conflict between the US government and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints until the Church amended its position on practicing polygamy.\nSimilar issues have also arisen in the context of the religious use of psychedelic substances by Native American tribes in the United States, such as by the Native American Church. Other examples of religious groups using entheogens are the \"Uni\u00e3o do Vegetal\" and Santo Daime.\nIn 1955, Chief Justice of California Roger J. Traynor neatly summarized the American position on how freedom of religion cannot imply freedom from law: \"Although freedom of conscience and the freedom to believe are absolute, the freedom to act is not.\" But with respect to the religious use of animals within secular law and those acts, the US Supreme Court decision in the case of the \"Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye v. City of Hialeah\" in 1993 upheld the right of Santeria adherents to practice ritual animal sacrifice, with Justice Anthony Kennedy stating in the decision: \"religious beliefs need not be acceptable, logical, consistent or comprehensible to others in order to merit First Amendment protection\" (quoted by Justice Kennedy from the opinion by Justice Burger in \"Thomas v. Review Board of the Indiana Employment Security Division\" 450 U.S. https:// (1981)).\nIn 1962, the case of \"Engel v. Vitale\" went to court over the violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment resulting from a mandatory nondenominational prayer in New York public schools. The Supreme Court ruled in opposition to the state.\nIn 1963, the Supreme Court ruled on the case of \"Abington School District v. Schempp\". Edward Schempp sued the school district in Abington over the Pennsylvania law which required students to hear and sometimes read portions of the bible for their daily education. The court ruled in favor of Schempp and the Pennsylvania law was overturned.\nIn 1968, the Supreme Court ruled on the case of \"Epperson v. Arkansas\". Susan Epperson, a high school teacher in Arkansas sued over a violation of religious freedom. The state had a law banning the teaching of evolution and the school Epperson worked for had provided curriculum which contained evolutionary theory. Epperson had to choose between violating the law or losing her job. The Supreme Court ruled to overturn the Arkansas law because it was unconstitutional.\nAs a legal form of discrimination.\nLeaders of the Christian right in the United States, United Kingdom, and other nations frame their opposition to LGBT rights and reproductive freedom as a defence of religious liberty.\nThe Catholic Church does not believe it unjustly discriminates against anyone, but justly discriminates against sin, by obeying God.\nIn court cases, religious adherents have argued that they need exemptions from laws requiring equal treatment of LGBT people to avoid being complicit in \"the sinful behaviour\" of LGBT people. Moreover, other Christians argue that LGBT rights must be entirely removed from law to preserve the religious liberty of conservative Christians. As pointed out at the United Nations Human Rights Council in the 2023 formal report of the United Nations Independent Expert on protection against violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity on the basis of the explanation in a 2020 article by human rights expert Dag \u00d8istein Endsj\u00f8, adherents of denominations and belief systems who embrace LGBT-equality \"can claim that anti-LGBT manifestations of religion (such as criminalization and discrimination) not only impinge upon the right of LGBT people to be free from violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI), but also violate the denominations' own rights of freedom of religion\".\nIn 2015, Kim Davis, a Kentucky county clerk, refused to abide by the Supreme Court decision in \"Obergefell v. Hodges\" legalising same-sex marriage in the United States. When she refused to issue marriage licences, she became embroiled in the \"Miller v. Davis\" lawsuit. Her actions caused attorney and author Roberta Kaplan to claim that \"Kim Davis is the clearest example of someone who wants to use a religious liberty argument to discriminate.\" Davis was briefly jailed and Kentucky court ordered her to pay the same-sex couple $100,000 in damages.\nJudaism.\nJudaism includes multiple streams, such as Orthodox, Reform Judaism, Conservative Judaism, Reconstructionist Judaism, Jewish Renewal and Humanistic Judaism. However, Judaism also exists in many forms as a civilization, possessing characteristics known as peoplehood, rather than strictly as a religion. In the Torah, Jews are forbidden to practice idolatry and are commanded to root out pagan and idolatrous practices within their midst, including killing idolaters who sacrifice children to their gods or engage in immoral activities. However, these laws are not adhered to anymore as Jews have usually lived among multi-religious communities.\nAfter the conquest of the Kingdoms of Israel and Judea by the Roman Empire, a Jewish state did not exist until 1948 with the establishment of the State of Israel. For over 1500 years Jewish people lived under pagan, Christian, Muslim, etc. rule. As such Jewish people in some of these states faced persecution. From the pogroms in Europe during the Middle Ages to the establishment of segregated Jewish ghettos during World War II. In the Middle East, Jews were categorised as dhimmi, and non-Muslims were permitted to live within a Muslim state. Even though given rights within a Muslim state, a dhimmi is still not equal to a Muslim within Muslim society.\nThe State of Israel was established as a Jewish and democratic state after World War II. While the Israeli Declaration of Independence stresses religious freedom as a fundamental principle, in practice, most of Israel's governments have depended on ultra-Orthodox parties and have instituted legal barriers that applied to all Jews, regardless of whether they practised Orthodox Judaism. However, as a nation-state, Israel is very open towards other religions and religious practices, including a public Muslim call to prayer chants and Christian prayer bells ringing in Jerusalem. Israel has been evaluated in research by the Pew organization as having \"high\" government restrictions on religion. The government recognizes only Orthodox Judaism in certain matters of personal status, and marriages can only be performed by religious authorities. The government provides the greatest funding to Orthodox Judaism, even though adherents represent a minority of citizens. Jewish women, including Anat Hoffman, have been arrested at the Western Wall for praying and singing while wearing religious garments the Orthodox feel should be reserved for men. Women of the Wall have organized to promote religious freedom at the Wall. In November 2014, a group of 60 non-Orthodox rabbinical students were told they would not be allowed to pray in the Knesset synagogue because it is reserved for Orthodox. Rabbi Joel Levy, director of the Conservative Yeshiva in Jerusalem, said that he had submitted the request on behalf of the students and saw their shock when the request was denied. He noted: \"Paradoxically, this decision served as an appropriate end to our conversation about religion and state in Israel.\" MK Dov Lipman expressed the concern that many Knesset workers are unfamiliar with non-Orthodox and American practices and would view \"an egalitarian service in the synagogue as an affront.\" The non-Orthodox forms of Jewish practice function independently in Israel, except for these issues of praying at the Western Wall.\nA January 2022 report by IMPACT-se, an Israeli non-profit, detailed the amount of religious tolerance impressed on students through the education system in the United Arab Emirates. The \"Jews as a Religious Community\" section of the report starts with the UAE curriculum being cited as a tolerant one and one instilling a \"generally positive attitude toward other non-Muslims\". However, besides the positive examples aimed at maintaining peace between the two nations, the report also highlights the negative portrayal of Jews in the UAE, citing a hadith passage that preaches believers to not be like the Jews, as they may be unclean or dirty. An Islamic educational text further described punishing the Bani Qurayza Jews for purportedly abusing their commitment to supporting Muhammad. The textbooks also seem to have missed mentioning Israel in their maps or educating the children about the Jewish state's history, i.e. the event of Holocaust despite normalizing ties with the Jewish state.\nChristianity.\nSome Orthodox Christians, especially those living in democratic countries, support religious freedom for all, as evidenced by the position of the Ecumenical Patriarchate. Many Protestant Christian churches, including some Baptists, Churches of Christ, Seventh-day Adventist Church and main line churches have a commitment to religious freedoms. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints also affirms religious freedom.\nHowever others, such as African scholar Makau Mutua, have argued that Christian insistence on the propagation of their faith to native cultures as an element of religious freedom has resulted in a corresponding denial of religious freedom to native traditions and led to their destruction. As he states in the book produced by the Oslo Coalition on Freedom of Religion or Belief, \"Imperial religions have necessarily violated individual conscience and the communal expressions of Africans and their communities by subverting African religions.\"\nIn their book \"Breaking India\", Hindutva ideologue Rajiv Malhotra and Aravindan Neelakandan discussed the \"US Protestant Church\" funding activities in India, with the book arguing that the funds collected were being used not so much for the purposes indicated to sponsors, but for indoctrination and conversion activities. They suggest that India is the prime target of a huge enterprise\u00a0\u2013 a \"network\" of organizations, individuals, and churches\u00a0\u2013 that, they argue, seem intensely devoted to the task of creating a separatist identity, history, and even religion for the vulnerable sections of India. They suggest that this nexus of players includes not only church groups, government bodies, and related organizations, but also private think tanks and academics.\nJoel Spring has written about the Christianization of the Roman Empire:\nChristianity added new impetus to the expansion of empire. Increasing the arrogance of the imperial project, Christians insisted that the Gospels and the Church were the only valid sources of religious beliefs. Imperialists could claim that they were both civilizing the world and spreading the true religion. By the 5th century, Christianity was thought of as co-extensive with the \"Imperium romanum\". This meant that to be human, as opposed to being a natural slave, was to be \"civilized\" and Christian. Historian Anthony Pagden argues, \"just as the \"civitas\"; had now become coterminous with Christianity, so to be human\u00a0\u2013 to be, that is, one who was 'civil', and who was able to interpret correctly the law of nature\u00a0\u2013 one had now also to be Christian.\" After the fifteenth century, most Western colonialists rationalized the spread of empire with the belief that they were saving a barbaric and pagan world by spreading Christian civilization.\nCatholicism.\nPrior to Vatican Council II, the Catholic Church persecuted other religions. European Catholics, especially during the Inquisition and Crusades in the middle ages, killed Jews, Muslims, pagans, and Christians of different denominations and destroyed non-Christian and non-Catholic Christian religious art, books, and places of worship. In the colonial era of the United States, American Catholics forced Native Americans to convert to Catholicism and destroyed their religious art and places of worship. In 1864, Pope Pius IX had written a document called the \"Syllabus of Errors,\" which - made up of phrases and paraphrases from earlier papal documents, along with index references to them, and presented as a list of \"condemned propositions\" - condemned belief in universal religious freedom, claiming that non-Catholics do not have the right to practice their own religions and types of worship. In 1892, the church agreed with Thomas Aquinas on his policy of religious tolerance. In 2000, Pope John Paul II apologized on behalf of the church for its past sins, making special mention of religious persecution.\nAccording to the Vatican II document on religious freedom, \"Dignitatis Humanae\", \"the human person has a right to religious freedom\", which is described as \"immunity from coercion in civil society\". This principle of religious freedom \"leaves untouched traditional Catholic doctrine on the moral duty of men and societies toward the true religion.\" In addition, this right \"is to be recognized in the constitutional law whereby society is governed and thus it is to become a civil right.\" According to \"Dignitatis Humanae\" and the Catechism of the Catholic Church, every religion has the right to exist and to be publicly and privately practiced (including the right to be spread and to make converts), no religion must be denied the right to worship according to its own beliefs and practices, every person and group has the right to be religious or nonreligious and to change from one to the other, no person or group must be forced to be good but their right to conscience must be respected, every person and group has the right to its own culture and art, no religion must be used for sin nor any sin committed in the name of God or religion, and every religion and adherent must be treated as humanely as every other group and person in the world (especially when one religion is predominate or given special civil recognition). The catechism explains that, as the one true religion founded by the one true God, the Catholic Church has the right and duty to protect every individual's individual right to religious liberty. While the church believes idolatry is a sin, the church does not believe idolatry should be made illegal, since the criminalization of all or even most sins is the sin of coercion. Regarding the church's past sins, the catechism condemns Jewish deicide and makes reference to ecclesiastical torture and capital punishment.\nIslam.\nConversion to Islam is simple and according to Al-Baqara 256 \"there is no compulsion in religion\".[Quran https://] Certain Muslim-majority countries are known for their restrictions on religious freedom, highly favoring Muslim citizens over non-Muslim citizens. Other countries having the same restrictive laws tend to be more liberal when imposing them. Even other Muslim-majority countries are secular and thus do not regulate religious belief.\nIn Iran, the constitution recognizes four religions whose status is formally protected: Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.\nThe constitution, however, also set the groundwork for the institutionalized persecution of Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds, who have been subjected to arrests, beatings, executions, confiscation and destruction of property, and the denial of civil rights and liberties, and the denial of access to higher education. There is no freedom of conscience in Iran, as converting from Islam to any other religion is forbidden.\nIn Egypt, a 16 December 2006 judgment of the Supreme Constitutional Court of Egypt created a clear demarcation between recognized religions\u00a0\u2013 Islam, Christianity and Judaism\u00a0\u2013 and all other religious beliefs; no other religious affiliation is officially admissible. The ruling leaves members of other religious communities, including Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds, without the ability to obtain the necessary government documents to have rights in their country, essentially denying them of all rights of citizenship. They cannot obtain ID cards, birth certificates, death certificates, marriage or divorce certificates, and passports; they also cannot be employed, educated, treated in public hospitals or vote, among other things. See Egyptian identification card controversy.\nApostasy in Islam.\nIn Islam, apostasy is called \"ridda\" (\"turning back\") and is considered to be a profound insult to God. A person born of Muslim parents that rejects Islam is called a \"\"murtadd fitri\" (natural apostate), and a person that converted to Islam and later rejects the religion is called a \"murtadd milli\"\" (apostate from the community).\nA female apostate must be either executed, according to Shafi'i, Maliki, and Hanbali schools of Sunni Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh), or imprisoned until she reverts to Islam as advocated by the Sunni Hanafi school and by Shi'a scholars.\nIdeally, the one performing the execution of an apostate must be an imam. At the same time, all schools of Islamic jurisprudence agree that any Muslim can kill an apostate without punishment.\nHowever, while almost all scholars agree about the punishment, many disagree on the allowable time to retract the apostasy. S. A. Rahman, a former Chief Justice of Pakistan, argues that there is no indication of the death penalty for apostasy in the Qur'an.\nJaved Ahmad Ghamidi a prominent Islamic scholar who studied under Syed Abul Ala Maududi &amp; Amin Ahsan Islahi, says killing of apostates was only for a special period after the Itmam e Hujjat.\nPromotion.\n27 October is International Religious Freedom Day, in commemoration of the execution of the Boston martyrs, a group of Quakers executed by the Puritans on Boston Common for their religious beliefs under the legislature of the Massachusetts Bay Colony between 1659 and 1661. On October 27, 1553, Michael Servetus was burned alive for heresy in Geneva. On October 27, 1998, President Bill Clinton signed the International Religious Freedom Act.\nThe International Religious Freedom or Belief Alliance (IRFBA) is a network of countries promoting freedom of religion or belief (FoRB) worldwide.\nThere exists an International Panel of Parliamentarians for Freedom of Religion or Belief.\nMeasurement.\nReligious freedom is measured in the non-profit organization Freedom House's annual report, \"Freedom in the World\".\nIn its 2011 annual report, the \"United States Commission on International Religious Freedom\" designated fourteen nations as \"countries of particular concern\". The commission chairman commented that these are nations whose conduct marks them as the world's worst religious freedom violators and human rights abusers. The fourteen nations designated were Burma, China, Egypt, Eritrea, Iran, Iraq, Nigeria, North Korea, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam. Other nations on the commission's watchlist include Afghanistan, Belarus, Cuba, India, Indonesia, Laos, Russia, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkey, and Venezuela.\nThere are concerns about the restrictions on public religious dress in some European countries (including the Hijab, Kippah, and Christian cross). Article 18 of the UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights limits restrictions on freedom to manifest one's religion or beliefs to those necessary to protect public safety, order, health, or morals or the fundamental rights and freedoms of others. Freedom of religion as a legal concept is related to, but not identical with, religious toleration, separation of church and state, or secular state (\"la\u00efcit\u00e9\").\nContemporary restrictions.\nThe Pew Research Center has performed studies on international religious freedom between 2009 and 2022, compiling global data from 16 governmental and non-governmental organizations\u00a0\u2013 including the United Nations, the United States State Department, and Human Rights Watch\u00a0\u2013 and representing over 99.5 percent of the world's population. In 2009, nearly 70 percent of the world's population lived in countries classified as having heavy restrictions on freedom of religion. This concerns restrictions on religion originating from government prohibitions on free speech and religious expression as well as social hostilities undertaken by private individuals, organisations and social groups. Social hostilities were classified by the level of communal violence and religion-related terrorism.\nWhile most countries provided for the protection of religious freedom in their constitutions or laws, only a quarter of those countries were found to fully respect these legal rights in practice. In 75 countries, governments limit the efforts of religious groups to proselytise, and in 178 countries, religious groups must register with the government. In 2013, Pew classified 30% of countries as having restrictions that tend to target religious minorities, and 61% of countries have social hostilities that tend to target religious minorities.\nThe countries in North and South America reportedly had some of the lowest levels of \"government\" and \"social\" restrictions on religion, while The Middle East and North Africa were the regions with the highest. Saudi Arabia and Iran were the countries that top the list of countries with the \"overall\" highest levels of restriction on religion. Topping the Pew 2022 government restrictions index were Saudi Arabia, Iran, Afghanistan, Russia, Uzbekistan, China, Egypt, Burma, Maldives, and Malaysia.\nOf the world's 25 most populous countries, Egypt, India, Pakistan, Iran and Nigeria had the \"overall\" highest levels of restriction, while Japan, South Africa, the United States, the United Kingdom and the Democratic Republic of the Congo had some of the lowest levels, as measured by Pew in 2022.\nVietnam and China were classified as having high \"government\" restrictions on religion but were in the moderate or low range when it came to \"social\" hostilities. Nigeria, Bangladesh and India were high in \"social\" hostilities but moderate in terms of \"government\" actions.\nRestrictions on religion across the world increased between mid-2009 and mid-2010, according to a 2012 study by the Pew Research Center. Restrictions in each of the five major regions of the world increased\u00a0\u2013 including in the Americas and sub-Saharan Africa, the two regions where overall restrictions previously had been declining. In 2010, Egypt, Nigeria, the Palestinian territories, Russia, and Yemen were added to the \"very high\" category of social hostilities. The five highest social hostility scores were for Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, Iraq, and Bangladesh. In 2015, Pew published that social hostilities declined in 2013, but the harassment of Jews increased.\nIn the Palestinian territories, Palestinians face tight restrictions on practicing the freedom of religion due to the ongoing Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict. In a report published by the Geneva-based Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor, eyewitnesses reported systematic practices aiming at preventing young men and women from performing their prayers at Masjid Al-Aqsa. These practices include military orders issued by the Israeli Defense Army commander against specific Palestinians who have an effective role in Jerusalem, interrogating young men, and creating a secret blacklist of people who are prevented from entering the Al-Aqsa Mosque.\nThe lack of religious freedom in China has led to Uyghur Muslims fleeing the country to take refuge in other parts of the world. Uyghurs abroad encounter digital surveillance and intimidation, where their families in China are sometimes being used as leverage. The diplomatic relations of Beijing have resulted in the abuse and detention of Uyghur Muslims even in abroad. Along with Egypt and Saudi Arabia, the government of UAE was reportedly one of the three Arab nations to have detained and deported Uyghur Muslims living in asylum in Dubai, back to China. The decision received a lot of criticism due to China's poor human rights records and no extradition agreement shared between the two countries. Thailand and Turkey also have detained and deported Uyghurs reportedly under the pressure of the Chinese government.\nAccording to a 2021 report of the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, UN human rights experts received credible information that the Chinese government continues to engage in forced organ harvesting against religious minorities such as Uyghurs and Falun Gong practitioners and the organs most likely harvested include \u201chearts, kidneys, livers, corneas and, less commonly, parts of livers.\u201d\nRaif Badawi, the Saudi blogger who was detained for 10 years and received 1,000 lashes in public in 2014, was released on 11 March 2022. The information of Raif's release was shared by his Quebec-based wife, Ensaf Haidar after she received a call from him. The Saudi blogger was fined, jailed, and flogged for criticizing his country's clerics through his writings. However, besides the said punishment, a 10-year passport ban was also imposed on Raif, restricting him from traveling outside Saudi Arabia. Reporters Without Borders claimed that they would work in order to get the travel ban removed to help Raif join his family in Canada.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

An initially independent and later autonomous state, it existed from the 14th century to 1859, when it united with Wallachia () as the basis of the modern Romanian state; at various times, Moldavia included the regions of Bessarabia (with the Budjak), all of Bukovina and Hertsa. It also included the region of Pokuttya for a period of time.\nThe western half of Moldavia is now part of Romania, the eastern side belongs to the Republic of Moldova, and the northern and southeastern parts are territories of Ukraine.\nName and etymology.\nThe original and short-lived reference to the region was \"Bogdania\", after Bogdan I, the founding figure of the principality.\nThe names \"Moldavia\" and \"Moldova\" are derived from the name of the Moldova River; however, the etymology is not known and there are several variants:\nOn a series of coins of Peter I and Stephen I minted by Saxon masters and with German legends, the reverses feature the name of Moldavia in the form / (recte: ).\nIn several early references, \"Moldavia\" is rendered under the composite form \"Moldo-Wallachia\" (in the same way Wallachia may appear as \"Hungro-Wallachia\"). Ottoman Turkish references to Moldavia included (, meaning 'Bogdan's Wallachia') and (and occasionally , , \"Black Bogdania\"). See also names in other languages.\nThe names of the region in other languages include , , , (), , .\nHistory.\nEarly Middle Ages.\nThe inhabitants of Moldavia were Christians. Archaeological works revealed the remains of a Christian necropolis at Mih\u0103l\u0103\u0219eni, Boto\u0219ani county, from the 5th century. The place of worship, and the tombs had Christian characteristics. The place of worship had a rectangular form with sides of eight and seven meters. Similar necropolises and places of worship were found at Nicolina, in Ia\u0219i\nThe Bolohoveni are mentioned by the \"Hypatian Chronicle\" in the 13th century. The chronicle shows that this land is bordered on the principalities of Halych, Volhynia and Kiev. Archaeological research also identified the location of 13th-century fortified settlements in this region. Alexandru V. Boldur identified Voscodavie, Voscodavti, Voloscovti, Volcovti, Volosovca and their other towns and villages between the middle course of the rivers Nistru/Dniester and Nipru/Dnieper. The Bolohoveni disappeared from chronicles after their defeat in 1257 by Daniel of Galicia's troops. Their ethnic identity is uncertain; although Romanian scholars, basing on their ethnonym identify them as Romanians (who were called Vlachs in the Middle Ages), archeological evidence and the \"Hypatian Chronicle\" (which is the only primary source that documents their history) suggest that they were a Slavic people.\nIn the early 13th century, the \"Brodniks\", a possible Slavic\u2013Vlach vassal state of Halych, were present, alongside the Vlachs, in much of the region's territory (towards 1216, the Brodniks are mentioned as in service of Suzdal).\nSomewhere in the 11th century, a Viking named Rodfos was killed by Vlachs presumably in the area of what would become Moldavia. In 1164, the future Byzantine emperor Andronikos I Komnenos, was taken prisoner by Vlach shepherds in the same region.\nHigh Middle Ages.\nThe Franciscan Friar William of Rubruck, who visited the court of the Great Khan in the 1250s, listed \"the Blac\", or Vlachs, among the peoples who paid tribute to the Mongols, but the Vlachs' territory is uncertain. Friar William described \"Blakia\" as \"Assan's territory\" south of the Lower Danube, showing that he identified it with the northern regions of the Second Bulgarian Empire.\nLater in the 14th century, King Charles I of Hungary attempted to expand his realm and the influence of the Catholic Church eastwards after the fall of Cuman rule, and ordered a campaign under the command of Phynta de Mende (1324). In 1342 and 1345, the Hungarians were victorious in a battle against Tatar-Mongols; the conflict was resolved by the death of Jani Beg, in 1357. The Polish chronicler Jan D\u0142ugosz mentioned Moldavians (under the name \"Wallachians\") as having joined a military expedition in 1342, under King W\u0142adys\u0142aw I, against the Margraviate of Brandenburg.\nIn 1353, Drago\u0219, mentioned as a Vlach \"Knyaz\" in Maramure\u0219, was sent by Louis I to establish a line of defense against the Golden Horde forces of Mongols on the Siret River. This expedition resulted in a polity vassal to Hungary, in the Baia (\"T\u00e2rgul Moldovei\" or \"Moldvab\u00e1nya\") region.\nBogdan of Cuhea, another Vlach voivode from Maramure\u0219 who had fallen out with the Hungarian king, crossed the Carpathians in 1359, took control of Moldavia, and succeeded in wrenching Moldavia from Hungarian control. His realm extended north to the Cheremosh River, while the southern part of Moldavia was still occupied by the Tatar Mongols.\nAfter first residing in Baia, Bogdan moved Moldavia's seat to Siret (it was to remain there until Petru II Mu\u0219at moved it to Suceava; it was finally moved to Ia\u0219i under Alexandru L\u0103pu\u0219neanu - in 1565). The area around Suceava, roughly correspondent to future Bukovina, would later constitute one of the two administrative divisions of the new realm, under the name \"\u021aara de Sus\" (the \"Upper Land\"), whereas the rest, on both sides of the Prut river, formed \"\u021aara de Jos\" (the \"Lower Land\").\nDisfavored by the brief union of Angevin Poland and Hungary (the latter was still the country's overlord), Bogdan's successor La\u021bcu accepted conversion to Latin Catholicism around 1370. Despite the founding of the Latin diocese of Siret, this move did not have any lasting consequences. Despite remaining officially Eastern Orthodox and culturally connected with the Byzantine Empire after 1382, princes of the House of Bogdan-Mu\u0219at entered a conflict with the Constantinople Patriarchate about control of appointments to the newly founded Moldavian Metropolitan seat; Patriarch Antony IV even cast an anathema over Moldavia after Roman I expelled Constantinople's candidate, sending him back to Byzantium. The crisis was finally settled in favor of the Moldavian princes under Alexander I. Nevertheless, religious policy remained complex: while conversions to faiths other than Orthodox were discouraged (and forbidden for princes), Moldavia included sizable Latin Catholic communities (Germans and Magyars), as well as Armenians of the non-Chalcedonian Armenian Apostolic Church; after 1460, the country welcomed Hussite refugees (founders of Ciuburciu and, probably, Hu\u0219i).\nThe principality of Moldavia covered the entire geographic region of Moldavia. In various periods, various other territories were politically connected with the Moldavian principality. This is the case of the province of Pokuttya, the fiefdoms of Cetatea de Balt\u0103 and Ciceu (both in Transylvania) or, at a later date, the territories between the Dniester and the Bug rivers.\nPetru II profited from the end of the Hungarian-Polish union and moved the country closer to the Jagiellonian realm, becoming a vassal of W\u0142adys\u0142aw II on September 26, 1387. This gesture was to have unexpected consequences: Petru supplied the Polish ruler with funds needed in the war against the Teutonic Knights, and was granted control over Pokuttya until the debt was repaid; as this is not recorded to have been carried out, the region became disputed by the two states, until it was lost by Moldavia in the Battle of Obertyn (1531). Prince Petru also expanded his rule southwards to the Danube Delta. His brother Roman I conquered the Hungarian-ruled Cetatea Alb\u0103 in 1392, giving Moldavia an outlet to the Black Sea, before being toppled from the throne for supporting Fyodor Koriatovych in his conflict with Vytautas the Great of Lithuania. Under Stephen I.\nAlthough Alexander I was brought to the throne in 1400 by the Hungarians (with assistance from Mircea I of Wallachia), he shifted his allegiances towards Poland (notably engaging Moldavian forces on the Polish side in the Battle of Grunwald and the Siege of Marienburg), and placed his own choice of rulers in Wallachia. His reign was one of the most successful in Moldavia's history, but also saw the first confrontation with the Ottoman Turks at Cetatea Alb\u0103 in 1420, and later even a conflict with the Poles. A deep crisis was to follow Alexandru's long reign, with his successors battling each other in a succession of wars that divided the country until the murder of Bogdan II and the ascension of Petru III Aron in 1451. Nevertheless, Moldavia was subject to further Hungarian interventions after that moment, as Matthias Corvinus deposed Aron and backed Alex\u0103ndrel to the throne in Suceava. Petru Aron's rule also signified the beginning of Moldavia's Ottoman Empire allegiance, as the ruler agreed to pay tribute to Sultan Mehmed II.\nLate Middle Ages.\nUnder Stephen the Great, who took the throne and subsequently came to an agreement with Casimir IV of Poland in 1457, the state reached its most glorious period. Stephen blocked Hungarian interventions in the Battle of Baia, invaded Wallachia in 1471, and dealt with Ottoman reprisals in a major victory (the 1475 Battle of Vaslui); after feeling threatened by Polish ambitions, he also attacked Galicia and resisted a Polish invasion in the Battle of the Cosmin Forest (1497). However, he had to surrender Chilia (now Kiliia) and Cetatea Alb\u0103 (now Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi), the two main fortresses in the Budjak, to the Ottomans in 1484, and in 1498 he had to accept Ottoman suzerainty, when he was forced to agree to continue paying tribute to Sultan Bayezid II. Following the taking of Hotin (Khotyn) and Pokuttya, Stephen's rule also brought a brief extension of Moldavian rule into Transylvania: Cetatea de Balt\u0103 and Ciceu became his fiefs in 1489.\nEarly Modern Era and Renaissance.\nUnder Bogdan III the One-Eyed, Ottoman overlordship was confirmed in the shape that would rapidly evolve into control over Moldavia's affairs. Peter IV Rare\u0219, who reigned in the 1530s and 1540s, clashed with the Habsburg monarchy over his ambitions in Transylvania (losing possessions in the region to George Martinuzzi), was defeated in Pokuttya by Poland, and failed in his attempt to extricate Moldavia from Ottoman rule \u2013 the country lost Bender to the Ottomans, who included it in their Silistra Eyalet.\nA period of profound crisis followed. Moldavia stopped issuing its own coinage c.\u20091520, under Prince \u0218tef\u0103ni\u021b\u0103, when it was confronted with rapid depletion of funds and rising demands from the Porte. Such problems became endemic when the country, brought into the Great Turkish War, suffered the impact of the stagnation of the Ottoman Empire; at one point, during the 1650s and 1660s, princes began relying on counterfeit coinage (usually copies of Swedish riksdalers, as was that issued by Eustratie Dabija). The economic decline was accompanied by a failure to maintain state structures: the feudal-based Moldavian military forces were no longer convoked, and the few troops maintained by the rulers remained professional mercenaries such as the \"seimeni\".\nHowever, Moldavia and the similarly affected Wallachia remained both important sources of income for the Ottoman Empire and relatively prosperous agricultural economies (especially as suppliers of grain and cattle \u2013 the latter was especially relevant in Moldavia, which remained an under-populated country of pastures). In time, much of the resources were tied to the Ottoman economy, either through monopolies on trade that were only lifted in 1829, after the Treaty of Adrianople (which did not affect all domains directly), or through the raise in direct taxes - the one demanded by the Ottomans from the princes, as well as the ones demanded by the princes from the country's population. Taxes were directly proportional with Ottoman requests, but also with the growing importance of Ottoman appointment and sanctioning of princes in front of election by the boyars and the boyar Council \u2013 \"Sfatul boieresc\" (drawing in a competition among pretenders, which also implied the intervention of creditors as suppliers of bribes). The fiscal system soon included taxes such as the \"v\u0103c\u0103rit\" (a tax on head of cattle), first introduced by Iancu Sasul in the 1580s.\nThe economic opportunities offered brought about a significant influx of Greek and Levantine financiers and officials, who entered a stiff competition with the high boyars over appointments to the Court. As the manor system suffered the blows of economic crises, and in the absence of salarisation (which implied that persons in office could decide their own income), obtaining princely appointment became the major focus of a boyar's career. Such changes also implied the decline of free peasantry and the rise of serfdom, as well as the rapid fall in the importance of low boyars (a traditional institution, the latter soon became marginal, and, in more successful instances, added to the population of towns); however, they also implied a rapid transition towards a monetary economy, based on exchanges in foreign currency. Serfdom was doubled by the much less numerous slave population (\"robi\"), composed of migrant Roma and captured Nogais.\nThe conflict between princes and boyars was to become exceptionally violent \u2013 the latter group, who frequently appealed to the Ottoman court in order to have princes comply with its demands, was persecuted by rulers such as Alexandru L\u0103pu\u0219neanu and John III. Ioan Vod\u0103's revolt against the Ottomans ended in his execution (1574). The country descended into political chaos, with frequent Ottoman and Tatar incursions and pillages. The claims of Mu\u0219atins to the crown and the traditional system of succession were ended by scores of illegitimate reigns; one of the usurpers, Ioan Iacob Heraclid, was a Protestant Greek who encouraged the Renaissance and attempted to introduce Lutheranism to Moldavia.\nIn 1595, the rise of the Movile\u0219ti boyars to the throne with Ieremia Movil\u0103 coincided with the start of frequent anti-Ottoman and anti-Habsburg military expeditions of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth into Moldavian territory (see \"Moldavian Magnate Wars\"), and rivalries between pretenders to the Moldavian throne encouraged by the three competing powers.\nThe Wallachian prince Michael the Brave, after previously taking over Transylvania, also deposed Prince Ieremia Movil\u0103, in 1600, and managed to become the first Prince to rule over Moldavia, Wallachia, and Transylvania; the episode ended in Polish conquests of lands down to Bucharest, soon ended by the outbreak of the Polish\u2013Swedish War and the reestablishment of Ottoman rule. Polish incursions were dealt a blow by the Ottomans.\nDuring the 1620 Battle of Cecora, the voivode of the Principality of Moldavia, was assassinated by the Septilici noble family in which also saw an end to the reign of Gaspar Graziani.\nA period of relative peace followed during the more prosperous and prestigious rule of Vasile Lupu. He took the throne as a boyar appointee in 1637 and began battling his rival Gheorghe \u0218tefan, as well as the Wallachian prince Matei Basarab. However, his invasion of Wallachia, with the backing of Cossack Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky, ended in disaster at the Battle of Finta in 1653. A few years later, Moldavia was occupied for two short intervals by the anti-Ottoman Wallachian prince Constantin \u0218erban, who clashed with the first ruler of the Ghica family, George Ghica. In the early 1680s, Moldavian troops under George Ducas intervened in right-bank Ukraine and assisted Mehmed IV in the Battle of Vienna, only to suffer the effects of the Great Turkish War.\nPhanariots (1711\u20131822).\nDuring the late 17th century, Moldavia became the target of the Russian Empire's southwards expansion, inaugurated by Peter the Great with the Russo-Turkish War of 1710-1711. Prince Dimitrie Cantemir sided with Peter in open rebellion against the Ottomans, but he was defeated at St\u0103nile\u0219ti. Sultan Ahmed III officially discarded recognition of local choices for princes, imposing instead a system relying solely on Ottoman approval: the Phanariote epoch, inaugurated by the reign of Nicholas Mavrocordatos.\nPhanariote rule was marked by political corruption, intrigue, and high taxation, as well as by sporadic incursions of Habsburg and Russian armies deep into Moldavian territory. Nonetheless, they also attempted legislative and administrative modernization inspired by The Enlightenment (such as the decision by Constantine Mavrocordatos to salarize public offices, to the outrage of boyars, and the abolition of serfdom in 1749, as well as Scarlat Callimachi's \"Code\"), and signified a decrease in Ottoman demands after the threat of Russian annexation became real and the prospects of a better life led to waves of peasant emigration to neighboring lands. The effects of Ottoman control were also made less notable after the 1774 Treaty of K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Kaynarca allowed Russia to intervene in favour of Ottoman subjects of the Eastern Orthodox faith - leading to campaigns of petitioning by the Moldavian boyars against princely policies.\nIn 1712, Hotin was taken over by the Ottomans and became part of a defensive system that Moldavian princes were required to maintain, as well as an area for Islamic colonization (the Laz community).\nFragmentation.\nIn 1775, Moldavia lost to the Habsburg Empire its northwestern part, which became known as Bukovina. For Moldavia, it meant both an important territorial loss and a major blow to the cattle trade, as the region stood on the trade route to Central Europe.\nThe Treaty of Jassy in 1792 forced the Ottoman Empire to cede Yedisan to the Russian Empire, which made Russian presence much more notable, given that the Empire acquired a common border with Moldavia. The first effect of this was the cession of the eastern half of Moldavia (renamed as Bessarabia) to the Russian Empire in 1812.\nOrganic Statute, 1848 revolution.\nPhanariote rule was officially ended after the 1821 occupation of the country by Alexander Ypsilantis's Filiki Eteria during the Greek War of Independence; the subsequent Ottoman retaliation led to the rule of Ioan Sturdza. He was considered the first of a new system, since the Ottomans and Russia had agreed in 1826 to allow for the election by locals of rulers over the two Danubian Principalities, and convened on their mandating for seven-year terms. In practice, a new foundation to reigns in Moldavia was created by the Russo-Turkish War (1828\u20131829), beginning a period of Russian domination over the two countries which ended only in 1856. Begun as a military occupation under the command of Pavel Kiselyov, Russian domination gave Wallachia and Moldavia, which were not removed from nominal Ottoman control, the modernizing \"Organic Statute\" (the first document resembling a constitution, as well as the first to regard both principalities). After 1829, the country also became an important destination for immigration of Ashkenazi Jews from the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria and areas of Russia (\"see History of the Jews in Romania and Sudi\u021bi\").\nThe first Moldavian rule established under the Statute, that of Mihail Sturdza, was nonetheless ambivalent: eager to reduce abuse of office, Sturdza introduced reforms (the abolition of slavery, secularization, economic rebuilding), but he was widely seen as enforcing his own power over that of the newly instituted consultative Assembly. A supporter of the union of his country with Wallachia and of Romanian Romantic nationalism, he obtained the establishment of a customs union between the two countries (1847) and showed support for radical projects favored by low boyars; nevertheless, he clamped down with noted violence the Moldavian revolutionary attempt in the last days of March 1848. Grigore Alexandru Ghica allowed the exiled revolutionaries to return to Moldavia c. 1853, which led to the creation of the National Party (), a trans-boundary group of radical union supporters which campaigned for a single state under a foreign dynasty.\nSouthern Bessarabia.\nIn 1856, under the terms of the Treaty of Paris, the Russian Empire returned to Moldavia a significant territory in southern Bessarabia (including a part of Budjak), organised later as the Bolgrad, Cahul, and Ismail counties.\nUnion with Wallachia.\nRussian domination ended abruptly after the Crimean War, when the Treaty of Paris also passed the two Romanian principalities under the tutelage of Great European Powers (together with Russia and the Ottoman overlord, power-sharing included the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, the Austrian Empire, the French Empire, the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia, and Prussia). Due to Austrian and Ottoman opposition and British reserves, the union program as demanded by radical campaigners was debated intensely.\nIn September 1857, given that \"Caimacam\" Nicolae Vogoride had perpetrated fraud in elections in Moldavia, the Powers allowed the two states to convene ad hoc divans, which were to decide a new constitutional framework; the result showed overwhelming support for the union, as the creation of a liberal and neutral state. After further meetings among leaders of tutor states, an agreement was reached (the \"Paris Convention\"), whereby a limited union was to be enforced \u2013 separate governments and thrones, with only two bodies in common (a Court of Cassation and a Central Commission residing in Foc\u0219ani); it also stipulated that an end to all privilege was to be passed into law, and awarded back to Moldavia the areas around Bolhrad, Cahul, and Izmail.\nHowever, the Convention failed to note whether the two thrones could not be occupied by the same person, allowing \"Partida Na\u021bional\u0103\" to introduce the candidacy of Alexandru Ioan Cuza in both countries. On January 17 (January 5, 1859, Old Style), in Ia\u0219i, he was elected prince of Moldavia by the respective electoral body. After street pressure over the much more conservative body in Bucharest, Cuza was elected in Wallachia as well (February 5/January 24), this being considered as the day of the unification of Moldavia and Wallachia by means of a personal union.\nIn 1862, after diplomatic missions that helped remove opposition to the action, the United Principalities (the basis of modern Romania) was formally created, and instituted Cuza as \"Domnitor\" \u2013 thus officially ending the existence of the Principality of Moldavia. All other pending legal matters were clarified after the replacement of Cuza with Carol of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen in April 1866, and the creation of an independent Kingdom of Romania in 1881.\nSociety.\nSlavery.\nSlavery () was part of the social order from before the founding of the Principality of Moldavia, until it was abolished in stages during the 1840s and 1850s. Most of the slaves were of Roma (Gypsy) ethnicity. There were also slaves of Tatar ethnicity, probably prisoners captured from the wars with the Nogai and Crimean Tatars. The institution of slavery was first attested in a 1470 Moldavian document, through which Prince Stephen the Great frees Oan\u0103, a Tatar slave who had fled to Jagiellon Poland.\nThe exact origins of slavery are not known, as it was a common practice in medieval Europe. As in the Byzantine Empire, the Roma were held as slaves of the state, of the boyars or of the monasteries. Historian Nicolae Iorga associated the Roma people's arrival with the 1241 Mongol invasion of Europe and considered their slavery as a vestige of that era; he believed that the Romanians took the Roma as slaves from the Mongols and preserved their status to control their labor. Other historians consider that the Roma were enslaved while captured during the battles with the Tatars. The practice of enslaving prisoners may also have been taken from the Mongols. The ethnic identity of the \"Tatar slaves\" is unknown, they could have been captured Tatars of the Golden Horde, Cumans, or the slaves of Tatars and Cumans. While it is possible that some Romani people were slaves or auxiliary troops of the Mongols or Tatars, most of them came from south of the Danube, demonstrating that slavery was a widespread practice. The Tatar slaves, smaller in numbers, were eventually merged into the Roma population.\nTraditionally, Roma slaves were divided into three categories. The smallest was owned by the \"hospodars\", and went by the Romanian-language name of \"\u021bigani domne\u0219ti\" (\"Gypsies belonging to the lord\"). The two other categories comprised \"\u021bigani m\u0103n\u0103stire\u0219ti\" (\"Gypsies belonging to the monasteries\"), who were the property of Romanian Orthodox and Greek Orthodox monasteries, and \"\u021bigani boiere\u0219ti\" (\"Gypsies belonging to the boyars\"), who were enslaved by the category of landowners.\nThe abolition of slavery was carried out following a campaign by young revolutionaries who embraced the liberal ideas of the Enlightenment. In 1844, Moldavian Prince Mihail Sturdza proposed a law on the freeing of slaves owned by the church and state. By the 1850s, the movement gained support from almost the whole of Romanian society. In December 1855, following a proposal by Prince Grigore Alexandru Ghica, a bill drafted by Mihail Kog\u0103lniceanu and Petre Mavrogheni was adopted by the Divan; the law emancipated all slaves to the status of taxpayers (citizens).\nSupport for the abolitionists was reflected in Romanian literature of the mid-19th century. The issue of the Roma slavery became a theme in the literary works of various liberal and Romantic intellectuals, many of whom were active in the abolitionist camp. The Romanian abolitionist movement was also influenced by the much larger movement against Black slavery in the United States through press reports and through a translation of Harriet Beecher Stowe's \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\". Translated by Theodor Codrescu and first published in Ia\u0219i in 1853, under the name \"Coliba lui Mo\u0219u Toma sau Via\u021ba negrilor \u00een sudul Statelor Unite din America\" (which translates back as \"Uncle Toma's Cabin or the Life of Blacks in the Southern United States of America\"), it was the first American novel to be published in Romanian. The foreword included a study on slavery by Mihail Kog\u0103lniceanu.\nMilitary forces.\nUnder the reign of Stephen the Great, all farmers and villagers had to bear arms. Stephen justified this by saying that \"every man has a duty to defend his fatherland\"; according to Polish chronicler Jan D\u0142ugosz, if someone was found without carrying a weapon, he was sentenced to death. Stephen reformed the army by promoting men from the landed free peasantry \"r\u0103ze\u0219i\" (i.e. something akin to freeholding yeomen) to infantry (\"voinici\") and light cavalry (\"h\u00e2nsari\"), reducing his dependence on the boyars, and introduced guns. The Small Host (\"Oastea Mic\u0103\") consisted of around 10,000 to 12,000 men. The Large Host (\"Oastea Mare\"), which could reach up to 40,000, was recruited from all the free peasantry older than 14 and strong enough to carry a sword or use a bow. This seldom happened, for such a lev\u00e9e en masse was devastating for both economy and population growth. In the Battle of Vaslui, Stephen had to summon the Large Host and also recruited mercenary troops.\nIn the Middle Ages and early Renaissance, the Moldavians relied on light cavalry (\"c\u0103l\u0103ra\u0219i\") which used hit-and-run tactics similar to those of the Tatars; this gave them great mobility and also flexibility, in case they found it more suitable to dismount their horses and fight in hand-to-hand combat, as it happened in 1422, when 400 horse archers were sent to aid Jagiellon Poland, Moldavia's overlord against the Teutonic Knights. When making eye-contact with the enemy, the horse archers would withdraw to a nearby forest and camouflage themselves with leaves and branches; according to Jan D\u0142ugosz, when the enemy entered the wood, they were \"showered with arrows\" and defeated. The heavy cavalry consisted of the nobility, namely, the boyars, and their guards, the \"viteji\" (lit. \"brave ones\", small nobility) and the \"curteni\" (court cavalry). These were all nominally part of the Small Host. In times of war, boyars were compelled by the feudal system of allegiance to supply the prince with troops in accordance with the extent of their manorial domain.\nOther troops consisted of professional foot soldiers (\"lefegii\") which fulfilled the heavy infantry role, and the \"pl\u0103ie\u0219i\", free peasants whose role was that of border guards: they guarded the mountain passes and were prepared to ambush the enemy and to fight delaying actions.\nIn the absence of the prince, command was assigned to the \"Mare Sp\u0103tar\" (Grand Sword-Bearer, a military office) or to the \"Mare Vornic\" (approx. Governor of the Country; a civilian office second only to the \"Voievod\", which was filled by the prince himself). Supplying the troops was by tradition-later-made-into-law the duty of the inhabitants of those lands on which the soldiers were present at a given time.\nThe Moldavians' (as well as Wallachians') favourite military doctrine in (defensive) wars was a scorched earth policy combined with harassment of the advancing enemy using hit-and-run tactics and disruption of communication and supply lines, followed by a large scale ambush: a weakened enemy would be lured in a place where it would find itself in a position hard or impossible to defend. A general attack would follow, often with devastating results. The shattered remains of what was once the enemy army would be pursued closely and harassed all the way to the border and sometimes beyond. A typical example of successful employments of this scenario is the Battle of Vaslui.\nTowards the end of the 15th century, especially after the success of guns and cannons, mercenaries became a dominant force in the country's military. With the economic demands created by the stagnation of the Ottoman Empire, the force diminished and included only mercenaries such as the \"seimeni\".\nThe 1829 Treaty of Adrianople allowed Moldavia to again maintain its own troops, no longer acting as an auxiliary under strict Ottoman supervision, and assigned red over blue pennants (\"see Flag and coat of arms of Moldavia\"). Their renewed existence under Mihail Sturdza was a major symbol and rally point for the nationalist cause, aiding in bringing about the 1848 Moldavian revolution.\nFleet.\nAn early mention of a Moldavian naval fleet is found in connection with the rule of Aron Tiranul, who used it to help Wallachian ruler Michael the Brave establish his control over the Chilia branch of the Danube and Dobruja.\nThe Treaty of Adrianople provided for a Moldavian self-defense naval force, to be composed of caicque vessels. Schooners armed with cannons were first built in the 1840s. Along with patrolling the Danube, these made their way on its tributaries, the Siret and the Prut River.\nGeography.\nGeographically, Moldavia is limited by the Carpathian Mountains to the West, the Cheremosh River to the North, the Dniester River to the East and the Danube and Black Sea to the South. The Prut River flows approximately through its middle from north to south.\nOf late 15th century Moldavia, with an area of , the biggest part and the core of the former principality is located in Romania (45.6%), followed by the Republic of Moldova (31.7%), and Ukraine (22.7%). This represents 88.2% of the Republic of Moldova's surface, 18% of Romania's surface, and 3.5% of Ukraine's surface.\nThe region is mostly hilly, with a range of mountains in the west, and plain areas in the southeast. Moldavia's highest altitude is Ineu peak (2,279\u00a0m), which is also the westernmost point of the region.\nThe parts of Moldavia populated by Cs\u00e1ng\u00f3 Hungarians are sometimes referred to as Cs\u00e1ng\u00f3 Land.\nPopulation.\nHistorical population.\nContemporary historians estimate the population (historically referred to as Moldavians) of the Moldavian Principality in the 15th century, at between 250,000 and 600,000 people, but an extensive census was first conducted in 1769\u20131774.\nIn 1848, the northwestern part, annexed in 1775 by the Habsburg Empire, Bukovina, had a population of 377,571; in 1856, the eastern half of Moldavia, Bessarabia, annexed in 1812 by the Russian Empire, had a population of 990,274, while the population of Moldavia proper (the western half), in 1859, was 1,463,927.\nThe contemporary population peaked in 1992, at 10.07 million inhabitants in all three historical divisions (Western Moldavia, Bessarabia and Bukovina). As of 2011, the population was 8.63 million people, of which 3.67 million were in Western Moldavia, 3.86 million in Bessarabia and 1.08 million in Bukovina.\nCities.\nThe largest cities (as per last censuses) and metropolitan areas in the Moldavia region are:\nEducation.\nIn 1562, the so-called Schola Latina (a Latin Academic College) was founded in Cotnari, near Ia\u0219i, a school which marked the beginnings of the organized humanistic education institutions in Moldavia.\nThe first institute of higher learning that functioned on the territory of Romania was Academia Vasilian\u0103 (1640), founded by Prince Vasile Lupu as a \"Higher School for Latin and Slavonic Languages\", followed by the Princely Academy, in 1707. The first high education structure in Romanian was established in the autumn of 1813, when Gheorghe Asachi laid the foundations of a class of engineers, its activities taking place within the Greek Princely Academy.\nAfter 1813, other moments marked the development of higher education in Romanian, regarding both humanities and the technical science. Academia Mih\u0103ilean\u0103, founded in 1835 by Prince Mihail Sturdza, is considered the first Romanian superior institute. In 1860, three faculties part of the Academia Mih\u0103ilean\u0103 formed the nucleus for the newly established University of Ia\u0219i, the first Romanian modern university.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "46014", "revid": "27823944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46014", "title": "Gary Numan", "text": "English musician (born 1958)\nGary Anthony James Webb (born 8 March 1958), known professionally as Gary Numan, is an English singer, songwriter and musician. He entered the music industry as frontman of the new wave band Tubeway Army. The band's second and final album, 1979's \"Replicas\", reached No. 1 on the UK Albums Chart, and spawned a UK No. 1 single with \"Are 'Friends' Electric?\". Following the band's split, he released his debut solo album \"The Pleasure Principle\" later in 1979, which also reached No. 1 in the UK and produced another UK No. 1 single with \"Cars\". Although his commercial popularity peaked in the late 1970s and early 1980s, he has maintained a strong cult following since then. He has sold over 10 million records.\nNuman is regarded as a pioneer of electronic music. He developed a signature sound consisting of heavy synthesizer hooks fed through guitar effects pedals, and is also known for his distinctive voice and androgynous \"android\" persona. He received an Ivor Novello Award, the Inspiration Award, from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors in 2017. In June 2025 Numan made his debut at the Glastonbury Festival.\nEarly life.\nGary Anthony James Webb was born on 8 March 1958 in Hammersmith, West London. His father was a British Airways bus driver based at Heathrow Airport. He was seven when his family adopted his cousin (father's nephew) John, who would become a musician and play in Numan's backing band. He was educated at Town Farm Junior School in Stanwell, Surrey; Ashford County Grammar School; and Slough Grammar School, followed by Brooklands Technical College in Weybridge, Surrey. He joined the Air Training Corps as a teenager and briefly held various jobs including Heathrow Airport bus driver, forklift truck driver, air conditioning ventilator fitter, and accounts clerk.\nWhen Numan was 15, his father bought him a Gibson Les Paul guitar, which became his most treasured possession. He briefly played in various bands and looked through advertisements in \"Melody Maker\" for bands to join. He claims to have unsuccessfully auditioned as guitarist for the then-unknown band the Jam before joining Mean Street and the Lasers, where he met Paul Gardiner. The latter band would soon become Tubeway Army, with his uncle Jess Lidyard on drums and Gardiner on bass. The band signed a recording contract with Beggars Banquet Records. His initial pseudonym was Valerian, probably in reference to the hero in French science fiction comic series \"Val\u00e9rian and Laureline\". He later picked the surname Numan from an advertisement in the yellow pages for a plumber whose surname was Neumann.\nMusic career.\n1977\u20131981: Tubeway Army and the \"Machine Trilogy\".\nNuman came to prominence in the 1970s as lead vocalist, guitarist, songwriter, and record producer for Tubeway Army. After adopting a punk rock-style they signed a recording contract with Beggars Banquet Records and released their debut single \"That's Too Bad\" in February 1978, an attempt at making commercial punk music. It was followed by the recording of an album's worth of demo tapes in March 1978 (later released in 1984 as \"The Plan\"), and a second single, \"Bombers\", which like the first single did not chart. The two singles were released again as a gatefold doublepack in 1979, and in 1983 a re-release of \"That's Too Bad\" reached No. 97 on the UK singles chart.\nTubeway Army's eponymous, new wave-oriented debut studio album, released in November 1978, sold out its limited run and introduced Numan's fascination with dystopian science fiction and synthesizers. During the recording of the album Numan found a Moog synthesizer left behind in the studio and the transition towards an electronic sound began. Though the band's third single, the dark-themed and slow-paced \"Down in the Park\" (1979), did not appear on the charts, it became one of Numan's most enduring and oft-covered songs. It was featured with other contemporary hits on the soundtrack for the American drama film \"Times Square\" (1980), and a live version of the song appeared in the British concert film \"Urgh! A Music War\" (1982). Following exposure in a television advertisement for Lee Cooper jeans with the jingle \"Don't Be a Dummy\", Tubeway Army released the single \"Are 'Friends' Electric?\" in May 1979. After a modest start at the lower reaches of the UK singles chart at No.\u00a071, it steadily climbed to No.\u00a01 at the end of June and remained on that position for four consecutive weeks. In July its parent studio album \"Replicas\" also reached No.\u00a01 on the albums chart.\nAt this point Numan was recording his next studio album with a new backing band, having recruited keyboardist Chris Payne and drummer Cedric Sharpley. At the peak of success, Numan opted to premiere four songs in a John Peel session in June 1979 rather than promoting the current album and the Tubeway Army group name was dropped.\nIn September \"Cars\" reached No.\u00a01 in the UK. The single found success in North American charts where \"Cars\" spent 2 weeks at No.\u00a01 on the Canadian \"RPM\" charts, and reached No.\u00a09 in the US in 1980. \"Cars\" and the 1979 studio album \"The Pleasure Principle\" were both released under Numan's own stage name. The album reached No. 1 in the UK, and a sell-out tour (The Touring Principle) followed; the concert video it spawned is often cited as the first full-length commercial music video release. \"The Pleasure Principle\" was a rock album with no guitars; instead, Numan used synthesizers connected to effects units to achieve a distorted, phased, metallic tone. A second single from the album, \"Complex\", made it to No.\u00a06 on the UK singles chart.\nIn 1980, Numan topped the UK Albums Chart for a third time with \"Telekon\", and the singles \"We Are Glass\" and \"\", released prior to the album, reaching No.\u00a05 and No.\u00a06 on the UK charts. \"This Wreckage\", the only single taken from the original album release, entered the UK top 20 in December that year. \"Telekon\", the final studio album that Numan retrospectively termed the \"Machine\" section of his career, reintroduced guitars to Numan's music and featured a wider range of synthesizers. The same year he embarked on his second major tour (\"The Teletour\") with a more elaborate stage show than The Touring Principle the previous year. In April 1981, Numan decided to retire from touring following his upcoming series of concerts at Wembley Arena, where he was supported by the Canadian experimental musician Nash the Slash and Shock, a rock/mime/burlesque troupe whose members included Barbie Wilde, Tik and Tok, and Carole Caplin. \"Living Ornaments '79 and '80\", a live two album boxed set from the 1979 and 1980 tours, was released at this time, reaching No.\u00a02 in the UK charts. Both albums, also individually released as \"Living Ornaments '79\" and \"Living Ornaments '80\" also charted. The decision to retire would be short-lived.\n1981\u20131983: New musical directions.\nDeparting from the pure electropop that he had been associated with, Numan began experimenting with jazz, funk, and ethereal, rhythmic pop. His first studio album after his farewell concerts was \"Dance\" (1981). The album charted at No.\u00a03 on the UK charts, with an eight-week chart run and produced one hit single (\"She's Got Claws\"), which reached No.\u00a06. The album featured several distinguished guest players; Mick Karn (bass guitar; saxophone) and Rob Dean (guitar) of Japan, Roger Mason (keyboards) of Models, and Roger Taylor (drums) of Queen.\nWith his former backing band, Chris Payne (keyboards; viola), Russell Bell (guitar), and Ced Sharpley (drums) now reformed as the synth-pop band Dramatis, Numan contributed lead vocals to the minor hit \"Love Needs No Disguise\" from the studio album \"For Future Reference\" (1981) and lent lead vocals to the first single released by his long-term bassist Paul Gardiner, \"Stormtrooper in Drag\", which also made the charts. However, Numan's success began to wane as he was outsold by the Human League, Duran Duran, Depeche Mode, and his prior support act, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD). With each new studio album, Numan would take on a particular persona, but none seemed to catch audiences' attention like he had been able to in 1979.\nNuman's fourth solo studio album \"I, Assassin\" (1982) produced the top 10 hit \"We Take Mystery (To Bed)\", as well as the top 20 singles \"Music for Chameleons\" and \"White Boys and Heroes\", the album peaking at No.\u00a08 with a six-week chart run. The heavily percussive funk style made several tracks from the album, such as the 12\" version of \"Music for Chameleons\" and a special remix of \"White Boys and Heroes\", unexpected successes in the American club scene and in October 1982 he embarked on a US tour.\n\"Warriors\" (1983) further developed Numan's jazz-influenced style and featured contributions from avant-garde musician Bill Nelson of Be-Bop Deluxe (who fell out with Numan during recording and chose to be uncredited as the album's co-producer), and saxophonist Dick Morrissey (who also performed on \"The Fury\", \"Strange Charm\" and \"Outland\"). The album peaked at No.\u00a012, produced two hit singles including the top 20 title-track and, like \"I, Assassin\", spent six weeks in the charts. \"Warriors\" was the last album Numan recorded for Beggars Banquet Records, and was supported by a 40-date UK tour (again with support from robotic mime and music duo Tik and Tok).\n1984\u20131993: Record label foundation, collaborations, and career downturn.\nNuman subsequently issued a series of albums and singles on his own record label, Numa Records. The first studio album released, 1984's \"Berserker\", was Numan's first foray into music computers and samplers (in this case, the PPG Wave). The album was accompanied by a new, blue-and-white colour scheme and visual (including Numan himself, with blue hair), as well as a tour, a live album, video, extended play (EP), and the title track as a single. The track charted within the UK top 40. Despite this, the album divided critics and fans, and ultimately performed poorly, stalling at No. 32 on the UK chart. Numan cites many reasons for this, including distribution issues.\nA collaboration with Bill Sharpe (of Shakatak) as Sharpe &amp; Numan, in 1985, was more successful; in March of that year, the single \"Change Your Mind\" reached No.\u00a017 on the UK singles chart. A few months later, the live album \"White Noise\" (recorded during the Berserker Tour) and a live EP with tracks taken from it (titled \"The Live EP\") reached No.\u00a029 and 27 on the charts, respectively.\nNuman's next studio album, \"The Fury\" (1985), charted slightly higher than \"Berserker\", breaking the top 30. Again, the album heralded a change of image, this time featuring Numan in a white suit and red bow tie. However, for the first time in his career, none of the three initial singles released from the album (\"Your Fascination\", \"Call Out the Dogs\" and \"Miracles\") managed to reach the top 40, barely entering the top 50 on the UK charts.\nThe following year, Numan scored two top-30 UK singles, with \"This Is Love\" in April 1986, and \"I Can't Stop\" in June that year; the subsequent studio album, \"Strange Charm\", was released later that year, but only spent two weeks on the albums chart, where it peaked at No.\u00a059. In November of that year, a version of the song \"I Still Remember\", from the previous studio album, was released as a charity single, but stalled at No.\u00a074 on the singles chart.\nFurther collaborations with Bill Sharpe spawned two more Sharpe &amp; Numan hits with \"New Thing from London Town\", peaking at No.\u00a052 in 1986, and \"No More Lies\" at No.\u00a035 in 1988. In 1987, Numan performed lead vocals for three singles by Radio Heart, a project of brothers Hugh and David Nicholson (formerly of Marmalade and Blue), which charted with varying success (\"Radio Heart\", No. 35, \"London Times\", No. 48; \"All Across the Nation\", No. 81 in the UK). A studio album was also released, credited to \"Radio Heart featuring Gary Numan\", with Numan only appearing on three tracks; the record failed to chart. Also in 1987, Numan's old label, Beggars Banquet, released the double disc compilation album \"Exhibition\", which reached No. 43 on the UK Albums Chart, and a remix of \"Cars\". The remix, titled \"Cars (E Reg Model)\", charted at No. 16, marking Numan's final Top 20 hit (until the same song was re-released in 1996).\nNuma Records, which had been launched during a flurry of idealistic excitement, folded after the release of Numan's eighth solo studio album \"Strange Charm\" (1986). Numan would reopen the record label in 1992, yet it was again shuttered in 1996. In addition to Numa Records' commercial failure, Numan's own amassed fortune (since the late 1970s), which he estimated to be around \u00a34.5\u00a0million, was drained. He then signed a recording contract with I.R.S. Records for the release of his final studio album of the 1980s, \"Metal Rhythm\" (1988), which also sold relatively poorly. For its American release, the record label edited the album's title to \"New Anger\" after the lead single's title, and also changed the album cover's colour from black to blue and remixed several of its tracks, against Numan's wishes.\nIn 1989, Sharpe &amp; Numan's sole studio album \"Automatic\" was released through Polydor Records, though this too failed to garner much commercial success, briefly entering the charts for just one week at No. 59, eleven spots lower than \"Metal Rhythm\", which had been released nine months prior. \"I'm on Automatic\" was the only single to be released from \"Automatic\"; it reached No. 44 on the UK singles chart. Its disappointing sales led to plans for a second Sharpe + Numan studio album being abandoned.\nIn 1991, Numan ventured into film-scoring by co-composing the music for the American science fiction horror film \"The Unborn\" with Michael R. Smith (the score was later released as the 1995 album \"Human\"). After \"Outland\" (1991), another critical and commercial disappointment and his second and last studio album with I.R.S., Numan reactivated Numa Records, under which he would release his next two studio albums. His first Numa Records release, \"Machine + Soul\" (1992), is considered by many, including Numan himself, to be a career low point, released primarily to pay off debt. After the poor reception of the album, Numan considered leaving the music industry entirely. In 1993, he released a single \"Cars ('93 Sprint)\", a techno remix of \"Cars\". That same year, he supported OMD (who had opened for him in 1979) on their concert tour.\n1994\u20132001: New musical direction and critical acclaim.\nBy 1994, Numan decided to stop attempting to crack the pop market and concentrate instead on exploring more personal themes, including his vocal atheism further (these themes had occasionally been explored on previous studio albums). His future wife Gemma encouraged him to strip away the influences of the more recent years. Numan thus sought a grittier, more industrial tone for his songwriting on his twelfth solo studio album \"Sacrifice,\" on which, for the first time, he played almost all the instruments himself. Nine Inch Nails (NIN), who were influenced by Numan's music, and other bands with industrial tendencies were contemporaneously becoming famous, and \"Sacrifice\" received critical acclaim. According to Numan, the influence was mutual. He cites 1994's \"Closer\" as his favourite Nine Inch Nails song, and has said that 1989's \"Head Like a Hole\" has \"the best chorus ever\". Depeche Mode's eighth studio album \"Songs of Faith and Devotion\" (1993) that came out during the recording of \"Sacrifice\" became a massive influence on Numan that both musically and lyrically inspired his new, darker direction.\n\"Sacrifice\" was the final studio album that Numan made before shutting down Numa Records permanently. His next two studio albums, \"Exile\" (1997) and \"Pure\" (2000), were well received and significantly helped to restore his critical reputation, as did the double-CD tribute album dedicated to Numan, \"Random\" (1997). \"Random\" was released shortly before \"Exile\" and featured artists, such as Blur's Damon Albarn, EMF, Jesus Jones, the Orb, Moloko and Pop Will Eat Itself, who had been influenced by Numan. Numan toured the US in support of \"Exile\", his first stateside concerts since the early 1980s.\n2002\u20132008: Further works and return to chart success.\nIn 2002, Numan enjoyed chart success once again with the single \"Rip\", reaching No.\u00a029 on the UK singles chart, and again in 2003 with the Gary Numan vs Rico single \"Crazier\", which reached No.\u00a013 in the UK charts. Rico also worked on the 2003 remix album \"Hybrid\" which featured reworkings of older songs in a more contemporary industrial style as well as new material. Other artists and producers who contributed on these remixes included Curve, Flood, Andy Gray, Alan Moulder, New Disease, and Sulpher. 2003 saw Numan performing the lead vocals on \"Pray for You\", the single from Plump DJs' second studio album \"Eargasm\", which reached No. 89 on the UK Top 100 Chart. In 2005, Numan took control of his own business affairs again with the launch of his recording label, Mortal Records.\nOn 13 March 2006, Numan's fifteenth solo studio album, \"Jagged\", was released. An album launch gig took place at The Forum in Kentish Town, London on 18 March followed by UK, European and US tours in support of the release. Numan also launched a \"Jagged\" website to showcase the album, and made plans to have his 1981 farewell concert (previously released as \"Micromusic\" on VHS) issued on DVD by November 2006 as well as releasing the DVD version of the \"Jagged\" album launch gig. Numan undertook a brief \"Telekon\" 'Classic Album' tour in the UK in December 2006, performing at Rock City, the Kentish Town Forum and Club Academy.\nNuman contributed lead vocals to four tracks on the April 2007 release of the debut solo studio album by Ade Fenton, \"Artificial Perfect\", on his new industrial and electronic label, Submission, including \"The Leather Sea\", \"Slide Away\", \"Recall\", and the first single to be taken from the album, \"Healing\". The second single to be released in the UK was \"The Leather Sea\" on 30 July 2007, which charted.\nHe sold out a 15-date UK and Ireland tour in spring 2008, during which he performed his 1979 number-one studio album \"Replicas\" in its entirety, and all the Replicas-era music including B-sides. The successful tour reflected the resurging popularity of electropop in the UK and coincided with his 50th birthday and 30th anniversary of the original release of \"Replicas\".\nIn November 2007, Numan confirmed via his website that work on a new studio album, with the working title of \"Splinter\", would be under way throughout 2008, after finishing an alternate version of \"Jagged\" (called \"Jagged Edge\") and the CD of unreleased songs from his previous three studio albums (released in 2011 as \"Dead Son Rising\"). Numan released his subsequent album, \"Splinter (Songs from a Broken Mind)\", in 2013.\n2009\u20132019.\nNuman was set to perform a small number of American live dates in April 2010, including a Coachella festival appearance in Indio, California, but had to cancel because air travel in Europe was halted by the Icelandic volcanic ash cloud. As a result, the tour was not only postponed but expanded, and his Pleasure Principle 30th Anniversary Tour's American and Mexican dates began on 17 October 2010, at Firestone Live in Orlando, Florida.\nNuman toured Australia in May 2011 performing his studio album \"The Pleasure Principle\" in its entirety to celebrate its thirtieth anniversary. Joining him on tour was Australian electronic band Severed Heads, coming out of retirement especially for the shows.\nNuman lent his vocals to the track \"My Machines\" on the American experimental rock band Battles's second studio album \"Gloss Drop\" (2011). He was chosen by Battles to perform at the ATP Nightmare Before Christmas festival that they co-curated in December 2011 in Minehead, England. Numan's sixteenth solo studio album \"Dead Son Rising\" was released on 16 September 2011, which had a full UK tour split in two-halves, 15\u201321 September and 7\u201311 December. Both parts were supported by Welsh solo artist Jayce Lewis; in an interview during the tour Numan said Lewis was \"one of the most popular\" support acts he had toured with. Numan later published some of his tour diary online.\nNuman provided narration for Cuban-American musician Aurelio Voltaire's fifth short film in his \"ChimeraScope\" series, \"Odokuro\" in 2011, which won 12 awards and was shown as a selection at numerous film festivals between 2011 and 2013.\nIn 2012, Numan collaborated with Officers on the track Petals to raise awareness for the suicide prevention charity CALM (Campaign Against Living Miserably). Two music videos were made to support the release. Officers also joined Numan on his Machine Music (in May and June 2012) and The Dead Moon Falling (late 2012) tours.\nNuman's seventeenth solo studio album \"Splinter (Songs from a Broken Mind)\", was released on 14 October 2013. It reached the UK Top 20, his first album to do so for 30 years. It was promoted by an extensive US, Canada, UK and Ireland tour which continued in 2014 to include Israel, New Zealand, Australia and Europe. A further US leg took place in late 2014.\nIn June 2014, Numan collaborated with Jayce Lewis on the track \"Redesign\" which originally featured on Lewis's Protafield studio album \"Nemesis\" The same album was re-released as a \"Special Edition\" under Lewis's solo name in 2018. Numan provided lead vocals for the song \"Long Way Down\", composed by Masafumi Takada with lyrics written by Rich Dickerson, for the survival horror video game \"The Evil Within\", which was released on 14 October 2014. Numan performed a sold-out, one-off live show in London in November 2014 at the Hammersmith Apollo supported by the English post-punk band Gang of Four.\nNuman collaborated with the industrial pop band VOWWS for \"Losing Myself in You\" on their debut studio album \"The Great Sun\".\nOn 6 May 2016, Numan was one of several collaborators on Jean-Michel Jarre's eighteenth studio album \"\", with the track \"Here for You\", co-written by Jarre and Numan.\nOn 10 May 2016, Numan was named the recipient of the 2016 Moog Innovation Award by Moog Music. On 18 May 2017, Numan received an Ivor Novello Inspiration Award from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors.\nIn 2017, Numan released the single \"My Name Is Ruin\" and went on a European tour September. Numan's eighteenth solo studio album \"Savage (Songs from a Broken World)\" was released on 15 September and charted at number two in the UK. He was the winner of the 2017 T3 tech legends award.\nOn 24 September 2018, Numan's tour bus hit and killed an elderly man in Cleveland, Ohio, US. The driver was not immediately charged. Numan was scheduled to appear at the Cleveland House of Blues that evening but cancelled the show for being \"inappropriate\" in light of the day's tragedy.\n2020\u2013present.\nNuman's nineteenth solo studio album \"Intruder\" was released on 21 May 2021. The title track was released earlier, on 11 January 2021. Numan discussed its genesis with writer Guy Mankowski, who has a chapter on Numan's legacy in his book \"Albion's Secret History: Snapshots of England's Pop Rebels and Outsiders\", as part of an interview series on influential English artists for Zer0 Books.\nFollowing his US Intruder tour in late 2021 and early 2022, Numan began a 17-venue UK tour between late April and late May 2022.\nNuman performed at the Cruel World Festival in Pasadena, California on 20 May 2023. After a nearby lightning storm led to an early evacuation, truncating Iggy Pop's set and cancelling Siouxsie Sioux's headlining set entirely, a second show was quickly announced for the following day, with Siouxsie, Pop and Numan returning.\nIn October 2023, Numan performed a series of eight acoustic gigs, playing songs from his repertoire in a new way in smaller, intimate settings. Locations included Wylam Brewery, Newcastle upon Tyne, Manchester Cathedral, and Church of St John-at-Hackney in London.\nIn February 2024, Numan announced a UK tour to celebrate the 45th anniversary of his 1979 studio albums \"Replicas\" and \"The Pleasure Principle\". Including shows in Norwich, Sheffield, Glasgow, Newcastle upon Tyne, Manchester, London, Bristol, Cardiff, Bournemouth, Birmingham and Nottingham between 19 May and 1 June.\nIn March 2025, he was featured on lead vocals on a track called \"Polished Chrome (The Friend Pt. 1)\" on a new studio album released by the German techno DJ Chris Liebing.\nOn 28 June 2025 Numan made his debut at the Glastonbury Festival, playing the Park Stage.\nArtistry and image.\nIn the late 1970s, Numan began developing his style. According to Numan, this was an unintentional result of acne; before an appearance on \"Top of the Pops (TOTP)\", \"I had spots everywhere, so they slapped about half an inch of white make-up on me before I'd even walked in the door. And my eyes were like pissholes in the snow, so they put black on there. My so-called image fell into place an hour before going on the show.\" His previously \"wooden\" stage presence was, in his words, a result of \"incredible self-consciousness\" and \"incompetence \u2013 I didn't know to move on stage\". He became enamoured by the idea of \"being cold about everything, not letting emotions get to you, or presenting a front of not feeling\", though his stage presence later became more intense and extroverted.\nInitially, Numan used his invention of the mysterious fantasy character \"Mach-man\", a machine in human skin dressed all in black, which developed from short stories he wrote at school, as his stage persona. But this image was replaced in 1981 by a totally different \"gangster\"-look inspired by a television programme on 1930s eccentric millionaire Howard Hughes.\nLater in the 1980s, Numan adopted a new visual image for each new studio album, such as the \"Mad Max\"-influenced image for \"Warriors\" (1983), the white-skinned, white-clad \"Iceman\" with blue hair and make-up for the \"Berserker\" (1984) album and tour, the white suit and red bow-tie image for \"The Fury\" (1985), and a \"Blade Runner\" (1982)-influenced image for \"Strange Charm\" (1986).\nA prolific songwriter, Numan has as of 2021 written about 400 songs. His starting point is usually a piano to work out melodies and chord structures. Most of the songs on his early albums were written on a piano his parents had bought him: later in his career he has used a piano preset on the computer as a starting point. However, his biggest hit \"Cars\" was unconventionally written on a bass guitar.\nNuman's recognisable vocals have become one of his trademarks, along with his androgynous \"android\" stage persona.\nMusical influences.\nIn a 2012 interview, Numan spoke about the music that has had an influence on him over the years. As a teenager he was fan of T. Rex, David Bowie and Queen. His band Tubeway Army started in the punk rock-vein in 1977, but Numan later said that the punk rock style was adopted with the sole intention to obtain a recording contract. Ultravox's third studio album \"Systems of Romance\" (1978) was the main influence behind Tubeway Army's transition into an electronic sound. Numan cited the album, and particularly the song \"Slow Motion\", as the blueprint for what he wanted to achieve. Moving away from the commercially successful synth-pop on the 1979 studio albums \"Replicas\" and \"The Pleasure Principle\" to a more introspective and partly ambient sound, David Bowie's collaborations with Brian Eno, the new wave band Japan and Lou Reed's third solo studio album \"Berlin\" (1973) has been cited as some of the influences that informed Numan's third solo studio album \"Dance\" (1981). At this point, jazz and funk influences became prominent in Numan's music, as on the single \"She's Got Claws\" and his fourth solo studio album \"I, Assassin\" (1982). His fifth solo studio album \"Warriors\" (1983) started as a collaboration with Bill Nelson, guitarist in Be-Bop Deluxe, which was another of Numan's favourite bands in the 1970s. Adopting a heavier, more aggressive sound, the production of his sixth solo studio album \"Berserker\" (1984) took influence from Trevor Horn's production of Frankie Goes to Hollywood. Wanting to broaden his musical output, Numan's mid- to late 1980's releases featured a jazz-funk style, blending an industrial edge with funk and synth-pop sensibilities. Following the release of two commercially and critically unsuccessful pop and funk influenced studio albums in the early 1990s, Numan found new pivotal influences in Nine Inch Nails (NIN) and Depeche Mode's eighth studio album \"Songs of Faith and Devotion\" (1993) that inspired him to move into a darker sound that became the trademark of his later career.\nLegacy.\nWithin the UK's burgeoning synth-pop scene, Numan was the first artist to achieve mainstream notoriety. His music and live performances met with censure from critics; he also faced condemnation from the Musicians' Union (MU), who said he was putting \"proper\" musicians out of work. Andy McCluskey of OMD observed \"\"nasty\", vitriolic journalism\" directed at Numan, who was dismissed as \"pretentious\" and \"pseudo-intellectual\". He nevertheless generated an army of fans calling themselves \"Numanoids\", providing him with a fanbase which maintained their support through the latter half of the 1980s, when his fortunes began to fall. He maintains a cult following and has sold over 10 million records.\nNuman is considered a pioneer of electronic music; \"Nightshift\" identified Numan, and fellow late 1970s debutants OMD and the Human League, as \"the holy trinity of synth-pop\". He has been credited as a key influence by fellow English musician Kim Wilde as she was working on her 1981 debut single \"Kids in America\" with her brother Ricky. Curt Smith and Roland Orzabal of Tears for Fears, another new wave act of the 1980s, cited Numan's style as one that inspired them while recording their debut studio album \"The Hurting\" (1983). Since the 1990s Numan has been cited as a major influence by a variety of bands and artists from hip-hop to industrial rock and Britpop, including Afrika Bambaataa, Fear Factory, Nine Inch Nails, Marilyn Manson, Stephin Merritt of the Magnetic Fields and Damon Albarn of Blur. Prince was quoted saying: \"There are still people trying to work out what a genius Gary Numan is.\"\nThe American industrial metal band Fear Factory produced a cover version of \"Cars\" (featuring a prominent guest appearance by Numan himself) for the digipak version of their third studio album, \"Obsolete\" (1999). Numan had become acknowledged and respected by his peers, with such musicians as Dave Grohl (of the Foo Fighters and Nirvana), with whom he covered \"Down in the Park\" on the compilation album \"\" (1996), Trent Reznor (of Nine Inch Nails, whose 2018 leg of the Cold and Black and Infinite tour concluded with a guest performance by Numan, who Reznor described as \"vitally important and a huge inspiration\"), and Marilyn Manson (who released his own cover version of \"Down in the Park\" as the B-side of his band's 1995 single \"Lunchbox\") proclaiming his work an influence.\nThe English electronic music duo Basement Jaxx had a hit in 2002 with \"Where's Your Head At\", which relied on a sample of Numan's \"M.E.\"\u2014from \"The Pleasure Principle\"\u2014for its hook. Nine Inch Nails covered the song \"Metal\" on \"The Fragile\" (1999) remix album \"Things Falling Apart\" (2000), as did Afrika Bambaataa (with Numan himself) on the studio album \"Dark Matter Moving at the Speed of Light\". \"Cars\" remains Numan's most enduring song; it was a hit again in 1987 (remixed by Zeus B. Held) and 1996, in the latter case thanks to an appearance in an advert for Carling beer. In 2000, the American DJ Armand van Helden sampled the track in his single \"Koochy\". In 2002, the English girl group the Sugababes scored a No.\u00a01 with \"Freak Like Me\", a mashup of Adina Howard's \"Freak Like Me\" and \"Are 'Friends' Electric?\" by Numan's Tubeway Army.\nPersonal life.\nFrom early in his career Numan was very close to his family. His father Tony was his manager for many years, his musician brother John became a member of his backing band and his mother Beryl was also frequently involved doing various things behind the scenes, such as running Numan's fan club and managing the reception at his Rock City studio.\nIn 1997, Numan married Gemma O'Neill, a member of his fan club from Sidcup, south-east London. They have three daughters. One daughter, at the age of 11, contributed vocals to Numan's 2017 song \"My Name Is Ruin\" and appeared in its music video. Numan and his family lived in Essex, then Heathfield and Waldron in East Sussex, and in October 2012 moved to Santa Monica, California, US.\nAt age 15, after a series of outbursts in which he would \"smash things up, scream and shout, get in people's faces and break stuff\", Numan was prescribed antidepressants and anxiolytics. In the 1990s, his wife suggested he had Asperger syndrome; after reading about the syndrome and taking a series of online tests, he agreed. It was discussed when he was younger, though he was not confident in the diagnostic criteria of the time. Conversely, he said in an April 2018 interview with \"The Guardian\" that he had been diagnosed with Asperger syndrome at the age of 14. In a 2001 interview, he said, \"Polite conversation has never been one of my strong points. Just recently I actually found out that I'd got a mild form of Asperger's syndrome which basically means I have trouble interacting with people. For years, I couldn't understand why people thought I was arrogant, but now it all makes more sense.\"\nNuman published his autobiography, \"Praying to the Aliens\", in 1997 (updated in 1998), in collaboration with Steve Malins, who also wrote the liner notes for most of the CD reissues of Numan's albums in the late 1990s, as well as executive producing the \"Hybrid\" album in 2003. An updated autobiography, \"(R)evolution: The Autobiography\", was published on 22 October 2020 and brings his career up to date from the earlier \"Praying to the Aliens\".\nNuman is an atheist.\nHe was an outspoken supporter of the Conservative Party and Margaret Thatcher after her election as Prime Minister. He later expressed regret for giving his public support, calling it \"a noose around my neck\". He has previously said that he considers himself neither left- nor right-wing and that he did not support Tony Blair or David Cameron. He also said, \"I'm not socialist, I know that. I don't believe in sharing my money.\" Numan is not overly politically engaged and distances himself from political commentary.\nAviation career.\nNuman joined the Air Training Corps as a teenager, when he wanted to be either a pilot or a pop star. In 1978, he started learning to fly at Blackbushe Airport, but the success of his music career in 1979 meant that obtaining his pilot's licence was delayed until 17 December 1980. The following day; 18 December 1980, Numan bought his first aeroplane for \u00a312,000; a Cessna 182 Skylane. On 1 July 1981, Numan founded Numanair, a small charter flight company operating from Blackbushe, and acquired a Cessna 210 Centurion (registered G-OILS) and a Piper PA-31 Navajo (registered G-NMAN). He also indulged his passion for motor racing in 1981 by sponsoring Mike Mackonochie who drove a Van Diemen RF81 in Numanair livery in the Formula Ford 1600 class.\nIn November and December 1981, Numan successfully flew around the world in his Piper PA-31 Navajo with co-pilot Bob Thompson on their second attempt. The first attempt, in the Cessna 210 Centurion, had ended in India with Numan and Thompson being arrested on suspicion of smuggling and spying. This aircraft was written off on 29 January 1982 when it ran out of fuel near Southampton and made a forced landing while Numan was a passenger.\nIn 1984, Numan bought a Harvard T-6 trainer aircraft registered G-AZSC and had the aircraft painted to resemble a Japanese \"Zero\" fighter. He also gained a display pilot's licence and flew the machine on the UK air display circuit. He and friend Norman Lees, who also owned a Harvard, formed the Radial Pair, performing synchronised aerobatics from the 1992 air display season. Later they teamed up with other Harvard owners to fly up to five aircraft as the Harvard Formation Team with Numan choreographing their aerobatic routines.\nNuman held licences for piston and turbine helicopters and had a fixed wing multi engined rating. He was an aerobatic flying instructor and was appointed by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) as an air display pilot evaluator. Then in 2005, after several of his friends and colleagues were killed in unrelated flying accidents, he gave up flying. In an interview in 2009 he said \"I loved going to air shows, you'd bond really tightly with your team mates \u2013 it's an extreme thing to be doing, and you trust your life to them. And then it ended. I'd turn up and not know anyone. It got depressing. I'd sit down in the pilot's tent and there'd be all these people I'd not recognise. You'd look forward to someone turning up to have a chat with them, and they'd be dead.\"\nNumanair continued operating but after 31 years, with Numan and his family emigrating to the US, it was dissolved on 18 June 2013.\nDiscography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "46015", "revid": "1310521034", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46015", "title": "Psion Organiser", "text": "Palmtop pocket computer from Psion\nThe Psion Organiser is a range of pocket computers developed by the British company Psion in the 1980s. Both the Organiser I (launched in 1984) and Organiser II (launched in 1986) feature a characteristic hard plastic sliding cover protecting a 6\u00d76 keypad instead of a computer keyboard, with letters arranged alphabetically.\nThe Organiser II competed with the Filofax and can be considered the first usable electronic organizer or personal digital assistant (PDA) in that it combined an electronic diary and searchable address database in a small, portable device.\nProduction of consumer hand-held devices by Psion has now ceased; the company, after corporate changes, now concentrates on hardware and software for industrial and commercial data-collection applications.\nOn an episode of \"The Gadget Show\", first aired 30 March 2009, the Psion was pitted against the BlackBerry for a place on the show's Hall of Fame. Whilst the Psion was highly praised as a device that pioneered portable computing, host Jon Bentley ultimately gave the accolade to the BlackBerry.\nAs of autumn 2024 several software features and hardware devices are still being developed and are available including a JavaScript Emulator, Parallel Interface, USB Commslink, 32 kilobyte (KB) and 256 KB RAMpaks, and 512 KB FlashPak.\nOrganiser I.\nLaunched in 1984, the Psion Organiser was the \"world's first practical pocket computer\". Based on an 8-bit Hitachi 6301-family processor, running at 0.9\u00a0MHz, with 4\u00a0KB of read-only memory (ROM) and 2\u00a0KB of static RAM and has a one-row monochrome liquid crystal display (LCD) screen. The size with the case closed is 142 \u00d7 78 \u00d7 29.3\u00a0mm, and the mass is 225\u00a0grams.\nA \"Byte\" reviewer described the Organiser's software as a \"clever design ... for fast and foolproof use\". He approved of the consistent user interface across applications and reported that without documentation he was able to learn how to do everything except program in 15 minutes. The machine provided a simple flat-file database, calculator and clock, and had no operating system (OS). The Organiser I supported removable storage write once read many (write-once) devices, which used \"erasable programmable read-only memory\" EPROM storage. The device can host two of these, named Datapaks (stylized as DATAPAK, or simply PAK), to which it can write data, but which must be removed from the device and erased by exposure to ultraviolet light before they can be re-used. As Psion had patented the use of EPROMS as a storage device, it was impossible for other device makers to copy this unusual approach to mobile storage.\nSoftware supplied on Datapak included a crude programming language named POPL, in which end-users could write their own programs. Software Datapaks titled Science, Maths and Finance contained the POPL programming language editor, interpreter and runtime system and extended the built-in calculator by adding named functions. These Datapaks also contained different sets of application software written in the POPL language.\nA far more sophisticated programming tool was later made available with the implementation of the Forth language, but was available to registered professional developers rather than end users. The Psion Forth Development System for the Organiser I was a powerful set of IBM PC-based cross-development tools for producing Forth application software, including a Forth compiler. The Forth system on the Organiser I had a compiler to intermediate code, interpreter and runtime, and had several unusual design features one being that it could interpret \u2013 that is, read and execute \u2013 Forth intermediate code directly in place on a Datapak, rather than needing to copy it into precious RAM first, despite the Datapaks not being execute-in-place memory-mapped.\nSoftware developed by Psion as part of the Organiser I project, and application software after its launch, was written in 6301 assembly language, in POPL, and in other custom-designed languages. Assembly language development at Psion was carried out using cross-development tools, including a cross assembler and linker, all of which ran on a Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) VAX.\nApplication developers writing in 6301 assembly struggled with the small amount of RAM (2\u00a0KB) and the lack of an operating system. Another difficulty for developers was with the performance limits of the earliest Datapaks, which used a serial-access internal architecture, instead of random access. Retrieving, for example, byte 2000 from a Datapak meant issuing successive hardware commands to either step from the current read position one address place at time until position 2000 was reached or, in the worst case, resetting the read position to zero and then issuing a step-forward command 2000 times.\nThe Hitachi 6301 processor is an enhanced development based on the Motorola 6801 implemented in \"complementary metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor\" (CMOS), with several extra instructions, various hardware system on a chip (SoC) facilities on-chip, power management and support for a sleep state. The particular variant chosen also had 4\u00a0KB of masked ROM on-chip, so an external ROM was unneeded on the board.\nHaving fully static RAM and a processor which clock could be frozen without losing state meant very long battery life, measured in weeks or even months. Minimal power use was aided by the processor being frozen whenever there was no work to do, plus a deeper sleep mode, which turned off the display.\nThe machine lacked a full independently battery-backed, date-time real-time hardware clock, instead it had a simple hardware counter. While the machine was sleeping, the counter counted 1,024 seconds and then woke the machine very briefly, so that software could add 1,024 seconds to a record of the time held in RAM. This meant that when sleeping the machine woke very fleetingly every 17 minutes 4 seconds.\nThe original 1984 price was \u00a399\u00a0GBP or $199\u00a0CAD and included one Datapak and one software Datapak, the \"Utility\" pack. This latter adds scientific and trigonometric functions to the otherwise basic calculator routines.\nOrganiser II.\nIn 1986, the successful Organiser II introduced many hardware improvements, a better keyboard and display, a much larger ROM and either 8 KB (CM Model), 16 or 32 KB (XP Model), 32 or 64 KB (later LZ Model) of battery-backed RAM, and featured a capable newly designed single-tasking operating system. The first Organiser II models featured a two-line display. The new model supported several different types of improved Datapaks, containing either EPROM or battery-backed RAM storage, each storing between 8\u00a0KB and 128\u00a0KB of data. Later \"electrically erasable programmable read-only memory\" (EEPROM) flashpaks, and random-access memory (RAM) RAMpaks, were added to the range, able to store up to 256\u00a0KB on each extension slot.\nThe machine had far more application functionality, including many built-in application programs, an easy-to-use database, a diary, and an alarm clock, and featured end-user programmability in the form of the successful then-named Organiser Programming Language (OPL), a BASIC-like language, which was compiled to intermediate code, in contrast to the interpreters, which were commonly available for other consumer computers of the time. More advanced users could edit the system machine-code routines, either by direct machine code or by calls from OPL, could manipulate the built-in address database, and create their own.\nThe Organiser II was widely used for commercial applications in companies such as Marks &amp; Spencer, where it was used on the shop floor, with their branding instead of Psion's and with only limited keys visible to the end user. It was also used in the world's first large-scale application of mobile technology in government, where over 3,000 were used for benefit calculations by the Employment Services department of the UK government. It proved popular with surveyors who interfaced it with electronic theodolites, which proved to be the precursor to the now popular total station.\nThe Organiser II also had an external device slot, into which various plug-in modules could be fitted, including a device that provided an RS-232 port (named \"CommsLink\"), thus enabling it to communicate with other devices or computers. This \"top slot\" also supported various other hardware additions, such as telephone dialers, a speech synthesiser, barcode reader, and a dedicated thermal printer. This latter was used by several banks as a counter-top exchange-rate calculator for some years. As it was easy to get hardware specifications, many bespoke devices were developed by small companies such as analog-to-digital converters (A/D) and even an interface to the full range of Mitutoyo measuring equipment, allowing it to be used in quality control for various car manufacturers. Later models in the Organiser II range offered other hardware improvements, with 4-line displays, and also models were introduced with 32, 64 and 96\u00a0KB RAM.\nPost production enthusiasts and developments.\nIn the autumn of 1996, when Psion PLC had moved their focus away from the Organiser II onto the newer clamshell series devices (below) and had almost ceased support for the Organiser II, Dave Woolnough created the \"Psion Organiser II Homepage\" to fill the gap, stating \"Considering that more than 500,000 series II Organisers were produced, there must be many people still using this wonderful machine\". The original Org2.com In the summer of 1997, Jaap Scherphuis joined the site as software specialist and soon became fully responsible for maintaining the web pages on a day-to-day basis. Dave wrote about Scherphuis \"A Remarkable Psion Programmer\". The Psion 2 archive had a large proportion of programmes written by Scherphuis, many written in machine code. In the spring of 2002 Boris Cornet took over as site maintainer/editor. Later that year he replaced the chat (bulletin board) with the now defunct Psion Organiser II Forum. When he died in 2012, the administrative duties for the forum were taken over by a power user MIKESAN who ran it until the spring of 2020 when he developed a terminal illness and the site became inaccessible. In January 2021 Olivier Gossuin, a Belgian enthusiast, launched a new Organiser II User Forum which in turn became inaccessible in 2022. In January 2023 a Canadian enthusiast Yves Martin provided space on his business server for a replacement forum with a long time enthusiast Martin Reid helping with the administration.\nAnother legacy that Boris Cornet left Organiser II users is \"Psi2Win\", the Windows PC comms link server. This Windows-friendly server was developed using Jaaps' reverse engineered comms link protocol. Boris always considered his Comms Server \"Psi2Win\" to be in permanent state of 'beta testing' but with his sad passing it is no longer being developed. With this in mind the author of ORG-link has further developed and released ORG-Link_V2 an Organiser II Comms Link Server that works in all Windows versions 32 and 64 bit. In the winter of 2013, Jaap created his web site with the aim \"to be an archive of Psion Organiser II information and software that might otherwise be abandoned and lost\". Hardware developments have continued with Organiser II Forum enthusiasts creating periferals such as microUSB CommsLink, 256 KB RAMPak, 512 KB FlashPak, and microUSB Power Supply. These, with other Organiser II hardware and software, are still available from the West Yorkshire Psion Store. Massimo Cellin created the Psion Facebook group in the autumn of 2015, servicing all the Psion products including the Organiser II. Members of the Facebook group include the former editor of IPSO FACTO, the 1980s and 1990s newsletters of the International Psion Pocket Computers User Group, copies of which are still available from Scherphuis' archive.\nTable of models.\nIn addition to the above, many other industrial, one-off and special edition models were released, including a special edition with transparent housing. Some of these models have radically different keyboard layouts.\nSubsequent hand-held devices.\nThe name \"Organiser\" was not used for later Psion handhelds, such as the \"SIxteen-Bit Organiser\" (SIBO) family Psion MC400 laptop, the Psion Series 3 and the 32-bit Psion Series 5 machines, which were of a clamshell design with a QWERTY keyboard. As to hardware architecture and operating system, these had no links to the earlier \"Organiser\" range, other than the end-user programming language, which shared a great deal of structure with OPL.\nThe SIBO family, and the improved version of the OPL language (with window and focus controls), was replaced in 1997 by a new ARM architecture-based operating system EPOC32 written in C++; the latter was later sold as the Symbian operating system, which until 2010 was the most widely used OS in smartphones, being in 2011 displaced by Google's Android OS. This change was more significant than appeared at the time. The consumer-grade high-level programming language still shares features with OPL, but the developer toolkits were from then on focused on programmers familiar with C and only the Symbian operating system remains.\nThe first similar device made in the USA did not appear until 1985 and was manufactured by Validec.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The company was headquartered in London, England, with major operations in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, and other company offices in Europe, the United States, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East. It was a public company listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE:\u00a0https://) and was once a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.\nPsion's operational business was formed in September 2000 from a merger of Psion and Canadian-based Teklogix Inc., and was a global provider of solutions for mobile computing and wireless data collection. The Group's products and services included rugged mobile hardware, secure software and wireless networks, professional services, and support programs. Psion worked with its clients in the area of burgeoning technologies, including imaging, voice recognition, and radio-frequency identification (RFID). They had operations worldwide in 14 countries, and customers in more than 80 countries.\nFormed in 1980, Psion first achieved success as a consumer hardware company that developed the Psion Organiser and a wide range of more sophisticated clamshell personal digital assistants (PDAs). Psion either closed or disposed of all its prior operations and then focused on rugged mobile computing systems. It withdrew from the consumer device market in 2001. Motorola Solutions announced in June 2012 that it had agreed to acquire Psion for $200 million.\nHistory.\nBeginnings (1980\u20131984).\nPsion was established in 1980 as a software house with a close relationship with Sinclair Research. The company developed games and other software for the ZX81 and ZX Spectrum home computers, released under the Sinclair/Psion brand. Psion's games for the ZX Spectrum included \"Chequered Flag\" and \"Flight Simulation\".\nEarly software releases for the ZX Spectrum included titles such as VU-Calc, VU-File and VU-3D, along with dozens of other titles.\nThe company name is an acronym standing for \"Potter Scientific Instruments\", after the company's founder, David Potter. The acronym PSI was already in use elsewhere in the world so \"ON\" was added to make the name unique. Potter remained managing director until 1999 and was chairman of the company until late 2009.\nIn early 1983, Sinclair approached Psion regarding the development of a suite of office applications for the forthcoming Sinclair QL personal computer. Psion were already working on a project in this area, and when the QL was launched in 1984 it was bundled with \"Quill\", \"Archive\", \"Abacus\" and \"Easel\"; respectively a word processor, database, spreadsheet, and business graphics application. These were later ported to DOS and made available for the IBM PC and ACT's Sirius and Apricot computers, collectively called \"PC-Four\", or \"Xchange\" in an enhanced version. \"Xchange\" was also available for ICL's One Per Desk computer, which was based on the QL.\nPsion Organiser (1984).\nIn 1984, Psion first entered the hardware market with the Psion Organiser, an early handheld computer, in appearance resembling a pocket calculator with an alphanumeric computer keyboard. In 1986, the vastly improved Psion Organiser II was released, and was assembled by Speedboard Assembly Services. Its success led the company into a decade long period of \"Psion\" Computer and operating system development. It included the simple-to-use Open Programming Language (OPL) for database programming, which sparked a large independent software market. \nEPOC (1987).\nIn 1987, Psion began developing its \"SIxteen Bit Organiser\" (SIBO) family of devices and its own new multitasking operating system named EPOC, to run its third generation product, Laptops (MC), industrial handhelds (HC and Workabout) and PDA (Series 3) products.\nIt is often rumoured that EPOC stands for \"Electronic Piece Of Cheese\" however Colly Myers, who was Symbian's CEO from founding until 2002, said in an interview that it stood for 'epoch' and nothing more. This development effort produced the clamshell QWERTY-based Psion Series 3 palmtops (1993\u201398), which sold in the hundreds of thousands, and the Psion MC-series laptops, which sold poorly compared to the DOS-based laptops of the era.\nA second effort, dubbed Project Protea, produced the Psion Series 5 for sale in 1997, a completely new product from the 32-bit hardware upwards through the OS, UI, and applications. It is still remembered for its high quality keyboard which, despite its size, allowed for touch-typing. However, the new feel of the product, and the removal of certain familiar quirks, alienated loyal Series 3 users, who tended to stick with their PDAs rather than upgrade.\nIn 1999, Psion released the Psion Series 7, which was much like a larger version of the Series 5, but with a double-size VGA-resolution screen that featured 256 colours (the Series 5 had a half-VGA screen with 16 grey shades). It was followed by the very similar Psion netBook.\nPsion was being challenged by the arrival of cheaper PDAs such as the Palm Pilot, and PocketPCs running Microsoft's Windows CE, and in 2003, Psion released a Netbook Pro running Windows CE .NET 4.2 instead of EPOC.\nSymbian and telephony (1998).\nThe 32-bit EPOC developed by Project Protea resulted in the eventual formation of Symbian Ltd. in June 1998 in conjunction with Nokia, Ericsson and Motorola. The OS was renamed the Symbian Operating System and was envisioned as the base for a new range of smartphones. Psion transferred 130 key staff to the new company and retained a 31% shareholding in the spun-out business. By 2007, the Symbian operating system powered around 125 million mobile phones, including many Nokia models and the Sony Ericsson P900 series.\nPsion had previously sought to expand into mobile telephony itself, having engaged in talks to acquire Amstrad \u2013 mainly for its Dancall subsidiary \u2013 in 1996. Although Amstrad's owner and founder, Alan Sugar, had reportedly been seeking to sell the entire business, no agreement could apparently be made on a price or on \"a plan for the disposal of the other parts of the Amstrad Group\". This setback left Psion promising \"to introduce GSM-based products during 1997\". Meanwhile, Psion did license EPOC to Digital Equipment Corporation so that the system could be ported to Digital's StrongARM processor.\nThe development of new and updated products by Psion slowed after the Symbian spin-off. Other products failed or had limited success; these included Psion Siemens' GSM device, a Series 5 based set-top box, the Wavefinder DAB radio, and an attempt to add Dragon's speech recognition software to a PDA. Ericsson cancelled a Series 5MX derived smartphone project in 2001.\nPsion had sold its sole manufacturing plant in 1999 and started to withdraw from its PDA markets in late 2001, shedding 250 of 1,200 staff and writing-off \u00a340 million. The PDA, which was once a niche market, had become a global horizontal marketplace where it was difficult for Psion to compete. The final blow for Psion's Organiser and PDA business came in January 2001 when Motorola pulled out of a joint project with Psion, Samsung, and Parthus, to create \"Odin\", an ARM-based PDA-phone.\nIn 2000, Psion acquired Teklogix of Canada for \u00a3240 million, and merged its business-to-business division, Psion Enterprise, with the newly acquired company. Teklogix was rebranded Psion Teklogix, and this division formed the core of Psion Plc's business.\nIn 2002, Psion launched the Psion Software division. This business developed push email solutions for Symbian smartphones, Microsoft Exchange and Lotus Notes. This business was sold to Visto of the United States in 2003.\nIn 2004, Psion disposed of the company's remaining Symbian shareholding to Nokia, as they no longer regarded it as a core part of their strategy.\nLast years (2010\u20132012).\nIn its last years, Psion made tailored and customized modular variants of its products through its online community, Ingenuity Working. Launched in March 2010, Ingenuity Working had more than 35,000 visitors per month within its first six months.\nIn January 2011, they launched a new logo, simultaneously removing Teklogix from their operating company name.\nMotorola Solutions announced in June 2012 that it had agreed to acquire Psion for $200 million.\n\"Netbook\" trademark litigation.\nPsion registered the trademark \"Netbook\" in various territories, including the European Union and http://, which was applied for on 18 December 1996 and registered by USPTO on 21 November 2000. They used this trademark for the Psion netBook product, discontinued in November 2003, and from October 2003, the NETBOOK PRO, later also discontinued.\nIntel started using the term \"netbook\" in March 2008 as a generic term to describe \"small laptops that are designed for wireless communication and access to the Internet\", believing they were \"not offering a branded line of computers here\" and \"see no naming conflict\".\nIn response to the growing use of the term, on 23 December 2008 Psion Teklogix sent cease and desist letters to various parties including enthusiast website(s) demanding they no longer use the term \"netbook\".\nIn early 2009, Intel sued Psion Teklogix (US &amp; Canada) and Psion (UK) in the Federal Court, seeking a cancellation of the trademark and an order enjoining Psion from asserting any trademark rights in the term \"netbook\", a declarative judgement regarding their use of the term, attorneys' fees, costs and disbursements and \"such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper\". The suit was settled out of court, and on 2 June 2009 Psion announced that the company was withdrawing all of its trademark registrations for the term \"Netbook\" and that Psion agreed to \"waive all its rights against third parties in respect of past, current or future use\" of the term.\nSimilar marks were rejected by the USPTO citing a \"likelihood of confusion\" under section 2(d), including 'G NETBOOK' (http:// rejected 31 October 2008), Micro-Star International's (MSI) 'WIND NETBOOK' (http://) and Coby Electronics' 'COBY NETBOOK' (http:// rejected 13 January 2009)\nIntegration with Linux.\nPsion had a lengthy, but distant, interest in Linux as an operating system on its electronic devices. In 1998, it supported the Linux7K project that had been initiated by Ed Bailey at Red Hat, which was to port Linux to its Series 5 personal computer. The project was named after the Cirrus Logic PS-7110 chip of the Series 5. Although this project was one of the earliest attempts to port Linux to a handheld computer, it did not come to fruition for Psion. The project soon transitioned to an informal open-source software project at Calcaria.net that kept the name Linux7K. After the project transitioned again to sourceforge.net, the project's name was changed to a more general name \"PsiLinux\", and later to \"OpenPsion\". The project has developed Linux kernels and file systems for the Revo, Series 5 and 5MX, and Series 7 and netBook.\nIn 2003\u20134, Psion Teklogix and its founder David Potter expressed interest in Linux as the operating system for its devices as it divested from Symbian. However, the only result of that interest was Linux as the operating system on a limited number of custom NetBook Pros designed for a hospital setting.\nThe Embeddable Linux Kernel Subset project has produced a small subset of Linux that runs on Psion Series 3 PDAs.\nPDAs.\nAll these PDAs except the Psion netpad have a small keyboard, which excepting the Organiser, HC and Workabout was of the standard QWERTY layout, or a regional variation thereof.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "46021", "revid": "10059", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46021", "title": "Rambouillet Agreement", "text": "Proposed peace agreement for Kosovo\nThe Rambouillet Agreement, formally the Interim Agreement for Peace and Self-Government in Kosovo, was a proposed peace agreement between the delegation of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Republic of Serbia on the one hand and the delegation of political representatives of the ethnic Albanian majority population of Kosovo on the other. It was drafted by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and named for the Ch\u00e2teau de Rambouillet, where it was initially proposed in early 1999. Among other things, the accords called for substantial autonomy for Kosovo; the deployment of up to 30,000 NATO peacekeeping troops in Kosovo; an unhindered right of passage for NATO troops on Yugoslav territory; and immunity for NATO and its agents to Yugoslav law. The Kosovo Albanian side signed the agreement on 18 March 1999, however the refusal of the Yugoslav and Serbian side to sign the accords led to the 1999 bombing of Yugoslavia.\nProvisions.\nThe provisions of the agreement included:\nProposed autonomy for Kosovo.\nThe Rambouillet Agreement included provisions for creating a system of democratic self-governance for Kosovo within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. It would have established executive, legislative and judicial branches of government, a system of local government and law enforcement institutions.\nCompetencies.\nThe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia would have competency over territorial integrity, maintaining a common market, monetary policy, defense, foreign policy, customs services, federal taxation, and federal elections. The federal government would maintain border crossings at Kosovo's external borders with Albania and North Macedonia and would exercise authority in connection with the enforcement of federal immigration laws.\nThe Republic of Serbia would have competence in relation to republic level elections in Kosovo. \nKosovo would be entitled to at least 10 seats in the federal parliament and at least 20 seats in the Serbian parliament.\nThe Kosovo would have competency over all matters not reserved to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Republic of Serbia. \nThe institutions of Kosovo would be able to make laws in areas they have competency and would be able to levy taxes, and institute programs for economic, scientific, technological, regional and social development.\nKosovo would be able to conduct foreign relations within its areas of competency including the right to maintain relations with foreign states, establish missions abroad, and join international organisations.\nInstitutions.\nThe Rambouillet Agreement proposed the establishment of executive, legislative and judicial organs in Kosovo. \nKosovo was to have an 120 member assembly of which 80 would be directly elected. Of the remaining 40 members, 10 would be elected by communities representing between 0.5 and 5% and 30 would be shared equally between the Albanian and Serb communities. The assembly would be led by a president, two vice-presidents.\nKosovo would have had a president elected by the assembly for a three year term renewable once. Executive power would be exercised by a government led by a prime minister, proposed by the president and confirmed by the assembly.\nKosovo was to have a constitutional court, a supreme court, district courts, and communal courts. The constitutional court and supreme court would each have 9 judges. An office of the prosecutor, led by a chief prosecutor, would be responsible for prosecuting individuals who violate the criminal laws of Kosovo. With the exception of immigration and customs related crimes, any person arrested within Kosovo would subject to the jurisdiction of the Kosovo courts. The rights and freedoms set forth in the European Convention on Human Rights would apply directly in Kosovo. An ombudsman institution would be established to protect human and community rights in Kosovo.\nKosovo's existing communes would continue to exist and would elect their own municipal assemblies and executive councils.\nCommunal police units would be established throughout Kosovo with responsibility police patrols, crime prevention, criminal investigations, arrest and detention of criminal suspects, crowd control, and traffic control. Communal police officers may be equipped with a sidearm, handcuffs, a baton, and, a radio and would be required to wear a badge, picture identification, and name tag. Each unit would be led by a communal commander, appointed by the local communal assembly. A criminal justice administration would be established to coordinate law enforcement operations across Kosovo.\nThe Rambouillet Agreement authorised the deployment of a 30,000 strong NATO-led Multi-National Military Implementation Force in Kosovo.\nNegotiating parties.\nThe negotiations were chaired by British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook and French Foreign Minister Hubert V\u00e9drine. At times, US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer also took part in the talks.\nThree parties were involved in the negotiations:\nNegotiations.\nRambouillet.\nOn 23 February 1999, the co-chairmen Robin Cook and Hubert V\u00e9drine of the negotiation process put out a statement saying that the negotiations \"have led to a consensus\" on substantial autonomy for Kosovo, including on mechanisms for free and fair elections to democratic institutions, for the governance of Kosovo, for the protection of human rights and the rights of members of national communities; and for the establishment of a fair judicial system\". They went on to say that \"a political framework is now in place\" leaving the further work of finalizing \"the implementation Chapters of the Agreement, including the modalities of the invited international civilian and military presence in Kosovo\".\nHowever, this assessment was at best overly optimistic, and at worst absolutely ignored the divergence of interests between the two major parties. The Albanians were unwilling to accept a solution that would retain Kosovo as part of Serbia, while the Serbs did not want to see the pre-1990 status quo restored, and they were implacably opposed to any international role in the governance of the province, including the offer of a face-saving measure wherein blue-helmeted UN peacekeeping troops would be used instead of NATO troops. To add to the problem, the NATO Contact Group countries were desperate to avoid having to make good on their threat of force\u2014Greece and Italy were opposed to the idea. Consequently, when the talks failed to achieve an agreement by the original deadline of 19 February, they were extended by another month.\nParis.\nTalks resumed on 15 March 1999 at the Kleber Center in Paris. On 18 March 1999, the Kosovo Albanian, American and British delegation signed the Rambouillet Agreement while the Serbian and Russian delegations refused. The agreement called for self-governance of Kosovo as an autonomous region within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia; a NATO-led force of 30,000 troops to maintain order in Kosovo; an unhindered right of passage for NATO troops on Yugoslav territory, including Kosovo; and immunity for NATO and its agents to Yugoslav law. In addition, NATO forces would have the right to use local roads, ports, railways, and airports without payment of duties, dues, tolls or charges, as well as the right to use the electromagnetic spectrum without payment. NATO would also have the right to requisition public facilities for its use free of cost. NATO forces would have the right to hire local personnel who upon employment with NATO would be exempt from local laws in respect to acts performed in their official capacity, national service obligations, local labor laws, and taxes on their salaries. Local infrastructure would be subjected to improvements or modifications to by NATO forces when deemed necessary to facilitate the mission. \nAccording to Tim Judah, the Serbian side used Annex B only later on as a reason for the failure of talks; at the time, the Serbs rejected any discussion of the involvement of foreign troops, let alone the extensive rights that would have been afforded them by Annex B.\nSigning.\nThe agreement was signed by Ibrahim Rugova, Hashim Tha\u00e7i, Rexhep Qosja and Veton Surroi on behalf of \"Kosovo\" in the presence of Christopher Hill and Wolfgang Petritsch on 18 March 1999. The delegation of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Republic of Serbia refused to sign the agreement.\nAftermath.\nEvents proceeded rapidly after the failure at Rambouillet. The international monitors from the OSCE were withdrawn on 22 March for fear of the monitors' safety ahead of the anticipated bombing by NATO. On 23 March, the Serbian assembly issued a resolution that condemned the withdrawal of the OSCE monitors, and accepted the principle of \"self rule\" for Kosovo and non-military part of the agreement. The NATO bombing campaign against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia commenced on 24 March 1999.\nNATO leaders had expected that a brief bombing campaign would lead to Serb forces withdrawing from Kosovo, hence ending the humanitarian crisis; but Milo\u0161evi\u0107 may have gambled that his government and armed forces could withstand a few days of bombing without serious harm.\nReactions.\nIn commentary released to the press, former United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger declared that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Rambouillet text, which called on Serbia to admit NATO troops throughout Yugoslavia, was a provocation, an excuse to start bombing. Rambouillet is not a document that an angelic Serb could have accepted. It was a terrible diplomatic document that should never have been presented in that form.\u2014\u200a The historian Christopher Clark supports this view, asserting that the terms of the 1914 Austro-Hungarian ultimatum to Serbia appear lenient compared to the NATO demands.\nA former hand on the State Department's Yugoslavia desk, George Kenney, reported in May 1999 that a senior State Department official had briefed journalists off the record that \"[we] deliberately set the bar higher than the Serbs could accept\".\nFor the Serbs, signing the Rambouillet agreement would actually have been signing away all Serbian sovereignty over Kosovo. It was not even a \"take it or leave it\" proposition, as Secretary of State Albright emphasized back in February 1999; rather, it was \"sign it or get bombed.\" There were, in fact, no negotiations at all, and no sovereign, independent state would have signed the Rambouillet agreement.\nHistorian Noel Malcolm wrote that as the Kosovo Albanian delegation signed the agreement on the 18th, the Yugoslav delegation boycotted the ceremony and declared its opposition to the plan and that military maneuvers were being planned, so that by March 20 there were more than 26,000 Serbian troops inside the province and another 15,000 stationed just beyond its eastern border.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "46023", "revid": "8719036", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46023", "title": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives", "text": "Presiding officer of the United States House of Representatives\nThe speaker of the United States House of Representatives, commonly known as the speaker of the House or House speaker, is the presiding officer of the United States House of Representatives, the lower chamber of the United States Congress. The office was established in 1789 by , of the U.S. Constitution. By custom and House rules, the speaker is the political and parliamentary leader of the House and is simultaneously its presiding officer, \"de facto\" leader of the body's majority party, and the institution's administrative head. Speakers also perform various other administrative and procedural functions. Given these many roles and responsibilities, the speaker usually does not personally preside over debates\u2014that duty is instead delegated to members of the House from the majority party\u2014nor regularly participate in floor debates.\nThe Constitution does not explicitly require the speaker to be an incumbent member of the House of Representatives, although every speaker thus far has been. If an incumbent member, the speaker also represents their district and retains the right to vote. The speaker is second in the United States presidential line of succession, after the vice president and ahead of the president pro tempore of the Senate.\nThe 56th and current speaker of the House is Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana.\nSelection.\nThe House elects its speaker at the beginning of a new Congress, biennially, after a general election, or when a speaker dies, resigns, or is removed from the position during a congressional term. At the start of a new Congress, those voting to elect the speaker are representatives-elect, as a speaker must be selected before members are sworn in to office; the House of Representatives cannot organize or take other legislative actions until a speaker is elected.\nSince 1839, the House has elected speakers by roll call vote. In practice, each party's caucus or conference selects a candidate for the speakership from among its senior leaders prior to the roll call. To be elected speaker, a candidate must receive a majority of votes from the members present and voting. If no candidate wins a majority, the roll call is repeated until a speaker is elected. Representatives are free to vote for someone other than the candidate nominated by their party but generally do not, as the outcome of the election effectively demonstrates which party has the majority and consequently will organize the House.\nRepresentatives who choose to vote for someone other than their party's nominee usually vote for someone else in their party or vote \"present\", in which case their vote does not count in tallying the vote positively or negatively. Anyone who votes for the other party's candidate could face serious consequences, as was the case when Democrat James Traficant voted for Republican Dennis Hastert in 2001 (107th Congress). In response, the Democrats stripped him of his seniority, and he lost all of his committee posts.\nUpon election, the new speaker is sworn in by the dean of the United States House of Representatives, the chamber's longest-serving member. Additionally, it is customary for the outgoing speaker, or the minority leader, to hand the speaker's gavel to the new speaker, as a mark of the peaceful transition of power.\nEligibility of non-members.\nWhile every speaker of the House has been a sitting House member, , concerning the choosing of a speaker, does not explicitly state House membership as a requirement. As noted by the Congressional Research Service, non-members have, on multiple occasions since 1997, received votes in speaker elections. In 1787, while the proposed Constitution was being considered, Pennsylvania Congress of the Confederation delegate Tench Coxe publicly wrote the following:\nThe house of representatives is not, as the Senate, to have a president chosen for them from without their body, but are to elect their speaker from their own number . . . .\nNoting that the Vesting Clause of states that \"All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives\", political scientist Diana Schaub has argued, \"Legislative powers cannot be lodged in the hands of a non-legislative person. To do so would violate the fundamental purpose of Article [I] of the Constitution.\" Both Schaub and the CRS note that the Standing Rules and Orders of the House created by the 1st United States Congress provided that the Speaker would vote \"In all cases of ballot by the [H]ouse\", while former House Intelligence Committee general counsel Michael Ellis and attorney Greg Dubinsky have argued that the speaker must be a House member because the Speaker performs various legislative functions that other House officers (such as the Sergeant at Arms and the Clerk) do not perform.\nSchaub and the CRS also note that the text of the Presidential Succession Act of 1947 assumes that the speaker is a House member in requiring the speaker's resignation upon succession to the presidency due to the Ineligibility Clause of . The Ineligibility Clause provides that \"No ... Representative shall, during the Time for which he was elected, be appointed to any civil Office under the Authority of the United States... and no Person holding any Office under the United States, shall be a Member of [the] House during his Continuance in Office.\" Along with political scientist Matthew J. Franck, Schaub, Ellis, and Dubinsky argue that permitting a Senator or an executive or judicial officer of the federal government to serve as a non-member Speaker would cause a significant breach of the constitutional separation of powers.\nSchaub, Ellis, and Dubinsky also argue that permitting a non-member to serve as Speaker would effectively exempt Speakers from the eligibility requirements of the and from being bound by an oath of office under the Oath or Affirmation Clause of Article VI as opposed to House members. The House Qualifications Clause requires that \"No person shall be a Representative who shall not have attained to the Age of twenty-five Years, and been seven Years a Citizen of the United States\". The Oath or Affirmation Clause provides that \"The ... Representatives before mentioned... and all executive and judicial Officers ... of the United States... shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution\". Pursuant to Article VI, the 1st United States Congress passed the Oath Administration Act (that remains in effect) which provides that \"...the oath or affirmation [required by the sixth article of the Constitution of the United States]... shall be administered ... to the Speaker\".\nLike the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in \"NLRB v. Noel Canning\" (2014), Ellis and Dubinsky cite an 1819 letter written by James Madison to Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals Judge Spencer Roane where Madison stated that \"difficulties and differences of opinion [arising] in expounding terms [and] phrases ... used [in the Constitution]... might require a regular course of practice to liquidate [and] settle the meaning of some of them.\" In holding in \"NLRB v. Noel Canning\" that the Recess Appointments Clause of Article II, Section II does not authorize the President to make appointments while the Senate is in \"pro forma\" sessions, the Supreme Court cited \"Marbury v. Madison\" (1803) and \"McCulloch v. Maryland\" (1819) in concluding that \"The longstanding 'practice of the government' ... can inform [the] determination of 'what the law is'\".\nSpeaker pro tempore.\nUnder the Rules of the House, the speaker may designate a member to serve as speaker pro tempore, acting as the body's presiding officer in the speaker's absence. In most instances, the speaker pro tempore designation lasts for no more than three legislative days, although in the case of illness of the speaker, the speaker pro tempore may serve for ten legislative days if the appointment is approved by the House.\nSeparately, a speaker pro tempore is designated in the event the office of the speaker is declared vacant. Under the current Rules of the House, at the start of their term, the speaker is required to create a secret ordered list of members to temporarily serve as speaker of the House if the speakership became vacant and to provide the clerk of the United States House of Representatives this list \"as soon as practicable after\" the election \"and whenever appropriate thereafter.\" The names are only revealed in the event of a vacancy (e.g., by the speaker's death, resignation, incapacitation, or removal from office). This \"succession list\" procedure was created in 2003, following the September 11 attacks, to promote continuity of government. Rule\u00a0I, clause\u00a08, of the House Rules states the member whose name appears first on the list \"shall act as Speaker pro tempore until the election of a Speaker or a Speaker pro tempore.\" The speaker pro tempore is not in the line of succession for the presidency.\nFollowing the removal of Kevin McCarthy as speaker in October 2023 on a motion to vacate (the first time in history that a speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives was successfully removed by the House), Patrick McHenry was revealed to be the first name on McCarthy's list and became acting speaker. The intent of the rule was for the speaker pro tempore to serve for a short period, until the House elected a new speaker, but the House rules set no specific limit on the length of time that a member may be speaker pro tempore.\nThe designation of a speaker pro tempore for purposes of succession, and for purposes of serving as the body's presiding officer in the speaker's absence, is separate from the speaker's designation of multiple members as speakers pro tempore for the purpose of allowing them to sign enrolled bills and joint resolutions. The House Rules state: \"With the approval of the House, the Speaker may appoint a Member to act as Speaker pro tempore only to sign enrolled bills and joint resolutions for a specified period of time.\" The list of the members with this duty (usually political allies of the speaker, or members from districts close to Washington and thus better able to hold \"pro forma\" sessions) is made public.\nHistory.\nThe first speaker of the House, Frederick Muhlenberg of Pennsylvania, was elected to office on April 1, 1789, the day the House organized itself at the start of the 1st Congress. He served two non-consecutive terms in the speaker's chair, 1789\u20131791 (1st Congress) and 1793\u20131795 (3rd Congress).\nAs the Constitution does not state the duties of the speaker, the speaker's role has largely been shaped by rules and customs that evolved over time. Scholars are divided as to whether early speakers played largely ceremonial and impartial roles or whether they were more active partisan actors.\n19th century.\nFrom early in its existence, the speaker's primary function had been to keep order and enforce rules. The speakership was transformed into a position with power over the legislative process under Henry Clay (1811\u20131814, 1815\u20131820, and 1823\u20131825). In contrast to many of his predecessors, Clay participated in several debates and used his influence to procure the passage of measures he supported\u2014for instance, the declaration of the War of 1812, and various laws relating to Clay's \"American System\" economic plan. Furthermore, when no candidate received an Electoral College majority in the 1824 presidential election, causing the president to be elected by the House, Speaker Clay threw his support to John Quincy Adams instead of Andrew Jackson, thereby ensuring Adams' victory. Following Clay's retirement in 1825, the power of the speakership once again began to decline, despite speakership elections becoming increasingly bitter. As the Civil War approached, several sectional factions nominated their own candidates, often making it difficult for any candidate to attain a majority. In 1855 and again in 1859, for example, the contest for speaker lasted for two months before the House achieved a result. Speakers tended to have very short tenures during this period. For example, from 1839 to 1863 there were eleven speakers, only one of whom served for more than one term. James K. Polk is the only speaker of the House who was later elected president of the United States.\nToward the end of the 19th century, the office of speaker began to develop into a very powerful one. At the time, one of the most important sources of the speaker's power was his position as Chairman of the Committee on Rules, which, after the reorganization of the committee system in 1880, became one of the most powerful standing committees of the House. Furthermore, several speakers became leading figures in their political parties; examples include Democrats Samuel J. Randall, John Griffin Carlisle, and Charles F. Crisp, and Republicans James G. Blaine, Thomas Brackett Reed, and Joseph Gurney Cannon.\nThe power of the speaker was greatly augmented during the tenure of the Republican Thomas Brackett Reed (1889\u20131891, 1895\u20131899). \"Czar Reed\", as he was called by his opponents, sought to end the obstruction of bills by the minority, in particular by countering the tactic known as the \"disappearing quorum\". By refusing to vote on a motion, the minority could ensure that a quorum would not be achieved and that the result would be invalid. Reed, however, declared that members who were in the chamber but refused to vote would still count for the purposes of determining a quorum. Through these and other rulings, Reed ensured that the Democrats could not block the Republican agenda.\n20th century.\nThe speakership reached its apogee during the term of Republican Joseph Gurney Cannon (1903\u20131911). Cannon exercised extraordinary control over the legislative process. He determined the agenda of the House, appointed the members of all committees, chose committee chairmen, headed the Rules Committee, and determined which committee heard each bill. He vigorously used his powers to ensure that Republican proposals were passed by the House. In 1910, however, Democrats and several dissatisfied Republicans joined to strip Cannon of many of his powers, including the ability to name committee members and his chairmanship of the Rules Committee. Fifteen years later, Speaker Nicholas Longworth restored much, but not all, of the lost influence of the position.\nOne of the most influential speakers in history was Democrat Sam Rayburn. Rayburn had the most cumulative time as speaker in history, holding office from 1940 to 1947, 1949 to 1953, and 1955 to 1961. He helped shape many bills, working quietly in the background with House committees. He also helped ensure the passage of several domestic measures and foreign assistance programs advocated by Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry Truman.\nRayburn's successor, Democrat John W. McCormack (served 1962\u20131971), was a somewhat less influential speaker, particularly because of dissent from younger members of the Democratic Party. During the mid-1970s, the power of the speakership once again grew under Democrat Carl Albert. The Committee on Rules ceased to be a semi-independent panel, as it had been since 1910. Instead, it once again became an arm of the party leadership. Moreover, in 1975, the speaker was granted the authority to appoint a majority of the members of the Rules Committee. Meanwhile, the power of committee chairmen was curtailed, further increasing the relative influence of the speaker.\nAlbert's successor, Democrat Tip O'Neill, was a prominent speaker because of his public opposition to the policies of President Ronald Reagan. O'Neill is the longest continuously serving speaker, from 1977 through 1987. He challenged Reagan on domestic programs and on defense expenditures. Republicans made O'Neill the target of their election campaigns in 1980 and 1982 but Democrats managed to retain their majorities in both years.\nThe roles of the parties reversed in 1994 when, after spending forty years in the minority, the Republicans regained control of the House with the \"Contract with America\", an idea spearheaded by Minority Whip Newt Gingrich.\nSpeaker Gingrich would regularly clash with Democratic President Bill Clinton, leading to the United States federal government shutdown of 1995 and 1996, in which Clinton was largely seen to have prevailed. Gingrich's hold on the leadership was weakened significantly by that and several other controversies, and he faced a caucus revolt in 1997.\nAfter the Republicans lost House seats in 1998 (although retaining a majority) he did not stand for a third term as speaker. His successor, Dennis Hastert, had been chosen as a compromise candidate since the other Republicans in the leadership were more controversial.\nHastert, who had been serving in the House since 1986, became the longest serving Republican speaker (1999-2007). Hastert led the campaign to elect Tom DeLay, with whom he developed a close and effective partnership, as House Majority Whip.\n21st century.\nThe Republicans came out of the 2000 elections with a further reduced majority but made small gains in 2002 and 2004. The periods of 2001\u20132002 and 2003\u20132007 were the first times since 1953\u20131955 that there was single-party Republican leadership in Washington, interrupted from 2001 to 2003 as Senator Jim Jeffords of Vermont left the Republican Party to become independent and caucused with Senate Democrats to give them a 51\u201349 majority.\nIn the 2006 midterm elections, the Democratic Party regained control of the House of Representatives. Nancy Pelosi was elected Speaker of the House, becoming the first woman to hold the position.\nJohn Boehner was elected speaker when the 112th Congress convened on January 5, 2011, and was re-elected twice, at the start of the 113th and 114th Congresses. On both of those occasions his remaining in office was threatened by the defection of several members from his own party who chose not to vote for him. Boehner's tenure as speaker, which ended when he resigned from Congress in October 2015, was marked by multiple battles with the conservatives in his own party related to \"Obamacare\", appropriations, among other political issues. This intra-party discord continued under Boehner's successor, Paul Ryan.\nWhen Boehner succeeded Pelosi as speaker in 2011, Pelosi remained the leader of the Democratic Party in the House of Representatives and served as House minority leader for eight years before she led her party to victory in the 2018 elections. Following the 2018 midterm elections which saw the election of a Democratic Party majority in the House, Nancy Pelosi was again elected speaker when the 116th Congress convened on January 3, 2019. In addition to being the first woman to hold the office, Pelosi became the first speaker to return to power since Sam Rayburn in the 1950s. Following the 2022 midterm elections which saw the election of a narrow Republican Party majority in the House, Pelosi did not seek a Democratic leadership post in the next Congress. The Democratic Caucus named her \"Speaker Emerita\".\nKevin McCarthy then became the new Speaker of the House on January 7, 2023, after the longest multi-ballot speaker election since 1859. McCarthy was eventually removed as speaker on October 3, 2023, after a further split in the Republican caucus, with five House Freedom Caucus members voting against McCarthy, which when combined with votes of Democrats, resulted in the ouster of McCarthy. This was the first time in the history of the House of Representatives in which the Speaker of the House was successfully removed. Following a multi-day four-ballot election, Mike Johnson was elected speaker on October 25, 2023.\nElections.\nHistorically, there have been several controversial elections to the speakership, such as the contest of 1839. In that case, even though the 26th United States Congress convened on December 2, the House could not begin the speakership election until December 14 because of an election dispute in New Jersey known as the \"Broad Seal War\". Two rival delegations, one Whig and the other Democrat, had been certified as elected by different branches of the New Jersey government. The problem was compounded by the fact that the result of the dispute would determine whether the Whigs or the Democrats held the majority. Neither party agreed to permit a speakership election with the opposite party's delegation participating. Finally, it was agreed to exclude both delegations from the election and a speaker was finally chosen on December 17.\nAnother, more prolonged fight occurred in 1855 in the 34th United States Congress. The old Whig Party had collapsed but no single party had emerged to replace it. Candidates opposing the Democrats had run under a bewildering variety of labels, including Whig, Republican, American (Know Nothing), and simply \"Opposition\". By the time Congress actually met in December 1855, most of the northerners were concentrated together as Republicans, while most of the southerners and a few northerners used the American or Know Nothing label. Opponents of the Democrats held a majority in House, with the party makeup of the 234 representatives being 83 Democrats, 108 Republicans, and 43 Know Nothings (primarily southern oppositionists). The Democratic minority nominated William Alexander Richardson of Illinois as speaker, but because of sectional distrust, the various oppositionists were unable to agree on a single candidate for speaker. The Republicans supported Nathaniel Prentice Banks of Massachusetts, who had been elected as a Know Nothing but was now largely identified with the Republicans. The southern Know Nothings supported first Humphrey Marshall of Kentucky, and then Henry M. Fuller of Pennsylvania. The voting went on for almost two months with no candidate able to secure a majority, until it was finally agreed to elect the speaker by plurality vote, and Banks was elected.\nThe House found itself in a similar dilemma when the 36th Congress met in December 1859. Although the Republicans held a plurality, the Republican candidate, John Sherman, was unacceptable to southern oppositionists due to his anti-slavery views, and once again the House was unable to elect a speaker. After Democrats allied with southern oppositionists to nearly elect the North Carolina oppositionist William N. H. Smith, Sherman finally withdrew in favor of compromise candidate William Pennington of New Jersey, a former Whig of unclear partisan loyalties, who was finally elected speaker on February 1, 1860.\nIn December 1923, at the start of the 68th Congress, Republican Frederick H. Gillett needed nine ballots to win reelection. Progressive Republicans had refused to support Gillett in the first eight ballots. Only after winning concessions from Republican conference leaders (a seat on the House Rules Committee and a pledge that requested House rules changes would be considered) did they agree to support him.\nIn 1997, several Republican congressional leaders tried to force Speaker Newt Gingrich to resign. However, Gingrich refused since that would have required a new election for speaker, which could have led to Democrats along with dissenting Republicans voting for Democrat Dick Gephardt (then minority leader) as speaker. After the 1998 midterm elections where the Republicans lost seats, Gingrich did not stand for re-election. The next two figures in the House Republican leadership hierarchy, Majority Leader Richard Armey and Majority Whip Tom DeLay chose not to run for the office. The chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, Bob Livingston, declared his bid for the speakership, which was unopposed, making him speaker-designate. It was then revealed, by Livingston himself, who had been publicly critical of President Bill Clinton's alleged perjury during his sexual harassment trial, that he had engaged in an extramarital affair. He opted to resign from the House, despite being urged to stay on by House Democratic leader Gephardt. Subsequently, the chief deputy whip Dennis Hastert was selected as speaker. The Republicans retained their majorities in the 2000, 2002, and 2004 elections.\nThe Democrats won a majority of seats in the 2006 midterm elections. On November 16, 2006, Nancy Pelosi, who was then minority leader, was selected as speaker-designate by House Democrats. When the 110th Congress convened on January 4, 2007, she was elected as the 52nd speaker by a vote of 233\u2013202, becoming the first woman elected speaker of the House. Pelosi was reelected speaker in the 111th Congress, and again in the 116th and 117th Congresses.\nThe January 2023 speakership election occurred two months after the 2022 House elections in which the Republicans won a slim four-seat majority. Kevin McCarthy was nominated for speaker by the House Republican Conference but due to a division among the Republicans, no one received a majority of the votes on the first ballot, necessitating an additional round of balloting for the first time since 1923. McCarthy ultimately prevailed when the remaining six anti-McCarthy holdouts voted \"present\" on the 15th ballot, ending the longest multiple-ballot speaker election since before the Civil War. He was removed from office less than ten months later, the first time in American History the House voted to remove its incumbent speaker. This led to multiple rounds of voting across multiple weeks to replace him, ultimately leading to the election of Representative Mike Johnson. This came after two weeks of negotiations between Republicans, including three failed votes for Speaker.\nMulti-ballot elections.\nIn total, there have been 16 elections requiring multiple ballots to elect a speaker, with 13 before the American Civil War, one in 1923, and two in 2023.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Table alignment/tables.css\" /&gt;\nPartisan role.\nThe Constitution does not spell out the political role of the speaker. As the office has developed historically, however, it has taken on a clearly partisan cast, very different from the speakership of most Westminster-style legislatures, such as the speaker of the United Kingdom's House of Commons, which is meant to be scrupulously non-partisan. The speaker in the United States, by tradition, is the head of the majority party in the House of Representatives, outranking the majority leader. However, despite having the right to vote, the speaker usually does not participate in debate and only votes on the most significant bills.\nThe speaker is responsible for ensuring that the House passes legislation supported by the majority party. In pursuing this goal, the speaker may use their influence over the Rules committee, which is in charge of the business of the House. The speaker chairs the majority party's House steering committee, which selects the majority members of each House standing committee, including the Rules committee (although it's worth to note their appointment to the said committees must be ratified by a resolution of the full House). While the speaker is the functioning head of the House majority party, the same is not true of the president pro tempore of the Senate, whose office is primarily ceremonial and honorary.\nWhen the speaker and the president belong to the same party, the speaker tends to play the role in a more ceremonial light, as seen when Dennis Hastert played a very restrained role during the presidency of fellow Republican George W. Bush. Nevertheless, when the speaker and the president belong to the same party, there are also times that the speaker plays a much larger role, and the speaker is tasked, e.g., with pushing through the agenda of the majority party, often at the expense of the minority opposition. This can be seen, most of all, in the speakership of Democratic-Republican Henry Clay, who personally ensured the presidential victory of fellow Democratic-Republican John Quincy Adams. Democrat Sam Rayburn was a key player in the passing of New Deal legislation under the presidency of fellow Democrat Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Republican Joseph Gurney Cannon (under Theodore Roosevelt) was particularly infamous for his marginalization of the minority Democrats and centralizing of authority to the speakership. In more recent times, Speaker Nancy Pelosi played a role in continuing the push for health care reform during the presidency of fellow Democrat Barack Obama and in pushing for increases in infrastructure and climate spending during the presidency of Democrat Joe Biden.\nOn the other hand, when the speaker and the president belong to opposite parties, the public role and influence of the speaker tend to increase. As the highest-ranking member of the opposition party (and \"de facto\" leader of the opposition), the speaker is normally the chief public opponent of the president's agenda. In this scenario, the speaker is known for undercutting the president's agenda by blocking measures by the minority party or rejecting bills by the Senate. One famous instance came in the form of Thomas Brackett Reed (under Grover Cleveland), a speaker notorious for his successful attempt to force the Democrats to vote on measures where the Republicans had clear majorities, which ensured that Cleveland's Democrats were in no position to challenge the Republicans in the House. Joseph Cannon was particularly unique in that he led the conservative \"Old Guard\" wing of the Republican Party, while his president\u2014Theodore Roosevelt\u2014was of the more progressive clique, and more than just marginalizing the Democrats, Cannon used his power to punish the dissidents in his party and obstruct the progressive wing of the Republican Party.\nMore modern examples include Tip O'Neill, who was a vocal opponent of President Ronald Reagan's economic and defense policies; Newt Gingrich, who fought a bitter battle with President Bill Clinton for control of domestic policy; Nancy Pelosi, who argued with President George W. Bush over the Iraq War; John Boehner, who clashed with President Barack Obama over budget issues and health care; and once again, Nancy Pelosi, who refused to support President Donald Trump over funding for a border wall.\nPresiding officer.\nAs presiding officer of the House of Representatives, the speaker holds a variety of powers over the House and is ceremonially the highest-ranking legislative official in the U.S. government. The speaker may delegate their powers to a member of the House to act as speaker pro tempore and to preside over the House in the speaker's absence; when this has occurred the delegation has always been to a member of the same party. During important debates, the speaker pro tempore is ordinarily a senior member of the majority party who may be chosen for his or her skill in presiding. At other times, more junior members may be assigned to preside to give them experience with the rules and procedures of the House. The speaker may also designate, with approval of the House, a speaker pro tempore for special purposes, such as designating a representative whose district is near Washington, D.C. to sign enrolled bills during long recesses.\nUnder the rules of the House, the speaker, \"as soon as practicable after the election of the speaker and whenever appropriate thereafter\", must deliver to the clerk of the House a list of members who are designated to act as speaker in the case of a vacancy or physical inability of the speaker to perform their duties.\nOn the floor of the House, the presiding officer is always addressed as \"Mister Speaker\" or \"Madam Speaker\", even if that person is serving as speaker pro tempore. When the House resolves itself into a Committee of the Whole, the speaker designates a member to preside over the committee, who is addressed as \"Mister Chairman\" or \"Madam Chairwoman\". To speak, members must seek the presiding officer's recognition. The presiding officer also rules on all points of order but such rulings may be appealed to the whole House. The speaker is responsible for maintaining decorum in the House and may order the Sergeant-at-Arms to enforce House rules.\nThe speaker is in charge of deciding which committee a bill will be assigned to, of determining whether to allow a member to make a motion to suspend the rules and of appointing members to select committees and conference committees.\nAs a member of the House, the speaker is entitled to participate in debate and to vote. Ordinarily, the speaker votes only when the speaker's vote would be decisive or on matters of great importance, such as constitutional amendments or major legislation. Under the early rules of the House, the speaker was generally barred from voting, but today the speaker has the same right as other members to vote but only occasionally exercises it. The speaker may vote on any matter that comes before the House, and they are required to vote where their vote would be decisive or where the House is engaged in voting by ballot.\nOther functions.\nIn addition to being the political and parliamentary leader of the House of Representatives and representing their congressional district, the speaker also performs various other administrative and procedural functions, such as:\nAdditionally, the speaker is second in the presidential line of succession under the Presidential Succession Act of 1947, immediately after the vice president and before the president pro tempore of the Senate (who is followed by members of the president's Cabinet). Thus, if both the presidency and vice-presidency were vacant simultaneously, then the speaker would become acting president, after resigning from the House and as speaker.\nRatification of the Twenty-fifth Amendment in 1967, with its mechanism for filling an intra-term vice-presidential vacancy, has made calling on the speaker, president pro tempore, or a cabinet member to serve as acting president unlikely to happen, except in the aftermath of a catastrophic event. However, only a few years after it went into effect, in 1973, at the height of Watergate, Vice President Spiro Agnew resigned. With Agnew's unexpected departure and the state of Richard Nixon's presidency, Speaker Carl Albert was suddenly first in line to become acting president. The vacancy continued until Gerald Ford was sworn in as vice president. Albert was also next in line from the time Ford assumed the presidency following Nixon's resignation from office in 1974, until Ford's choice to succeed him as vice president, Nelson Rockefeller, was confirmed by Congress.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Nearly half of Robinson's papers were in applied mathematics rather than in pure mathematics.\nBiography.\nHe was born to a Jewish family with strong Zionist beliefs, in Waldenburg, Germany, which is now Wa\u0142brzych, in Poland. In 1933, he immigrated to British Mandate of Palestine, where he earned a first degree from the Hebrew University. Robinson was in France when the Nazis invaded during World War II, and escaped by train and on foot, being alternately questioned by French soldiers suspicious of his German passport and asked by them to share his map, which was more detailed than theirs. While in London, he joined the Free French Air Force and contributed to the war effort by teaching himself aerodynamics and becoming an expert on the airfoils used in the wings of fighter planes.\nAfter the war, Robinson worked in London, Toronto, and Jerusalem, but ended up at the University of California, Los Angeles in 1962.\nWork in model theory.\nHe became known for his approach of using the methods of mathematical logic to attack problems in analysis and abstract algebra. He \"introduced many of the fundamental notions of model theory\". Using these methods, he found a way of using formal logic to show that there are self-consistent nonstandard models of the real number system that include infinite and infinitesimal numbers. Others, such as Wilhelmus Luxemburg, showed that the same results could be achieved using ultrafilters, which made Robinson's work more accessible to mathematicians who lacked training in formal logic. Robinson's book \"Non-standard Analysis\" was published in 1966. Robinson was strongly interested in the history and philosophy of mathematics, and often remarked that he wanted to get inside the head of Leibniz, the first mathematician to attempt to articulate clearly the concept of infinitesimal numbers.\nWhile at UCLA his colleagues remember him as working hard to accommodate PhD students of all levels of ability by finding them projects of the appropriate difficulty. He was courted by Yale, and after some initial reluctance, he moved there in 1967. In the Spring of 1973 he was a member of the Institute for Advanced Study. He died of pancreatic cancer in 1974.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "46025", "revid": "51012711", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46025", "title": "Omnipotence paradox", "text": "Family of paradoxes around the definition of omnipotence\nThe omnipotence paradox is a family of paradoxes that arise with some understandings of the term \"omnipotent\". The paradox arises, for example, if one assumes that an omnipotent being has no limits and is capable of realizing any outcome, even a logically contradictory one such as creating a square circle. Atheological arguments based on the omnipotence paradox are sometimes described as evidence for countering theism. Other possible resolutions to the paradox hinge on the definition of omnipotence applied and the nature of God regarding this application and whether omnipotence is directed toward God himself or outward toward his external surroundings.\nThe omnipotence paradox has medieval origins, dating at least to the 10th century, when Saadia Gaon responded to the question of whether God's omnipotence extended to logical absurdities. It was later addressed by Averroes and Thomas Aquinas. Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite (before 532) has a predecessor version of the paradox, asking whether it is possible for God to \"deny himself\".\nThe best-known version of the omnipotence paradox is the paradox of the stone: \"Could God create a stone so heavy that even he could not lift it?\" This is a paradoxical question because if God could create something he could not lift, then he would not be omnipotent. Similarly, if God was able to lift the stone then that would mean he was unable to create something he could not lift, leading to the same result. Alternative statements of the paradox include \"If given the axioms of Euclidean geometry, can an omnipotent being create a triangle whose angles do not add up to 180 degrees?\" and \"Can God create a prison so secure that he cannot escape from it?\".\nOverview.\nA common modern version of the omnipotence paradox is expressed in the question: \"Can [an omnipotent being] create a stone so heavy that it cannot lift it?\" This question generates a dilemma. The being can either create a stone it cannot lift, or it cannot create a stone it cannot lift. If the being can create a stone that it cannot lift, then it is not omnipotent because there is a weight threshold beyond its own power to lift. If the being cannot create a stone it cannot lift, then there is something it cannot create, and is therefore not omnipotent. In either case, the being is not omnipotent. This modern version is referred to as the \"Paradox of the Stone\".\nA related issue is whether the concept of \"logically possible\" is different for a world in which omnipotence exists than a world in which omnipotence does not exist.\nThe dilemma of omnipotence is similar to another classic paradox\u2014the irresistible force paradox: \"What would happen if an irresistible force were to meet an immovable object?\" One response to this paradox is to disallow its formulation, by saying that if a force is irresistible, then by definition there is no immovable object; or conversely, if an immovable object exists, then by definition no force can be irresistible. Another response to this that the only way out of this paradox is if the irresistible force and immovable object never meet. However this does not hold up under scrutiny, because an object cannot in principle be immovable if a force exists that can in principle move it, regardless of whether the force and the object actually meet.\nTypes of omnipotence.\nAugustine of Hippo in his City of God writes \"God is called omnipotent on account of His doing what He wills\" and thus proposes the definition that \"Y is omnipotent\" means \"If Y wishes to do X then Y can and does do X\". \nThe notion of omnipotence can also be applied to an entity in different ways. An essentially omnipotent being is an entity that is necessarily omnipotent. In contrast, an accidentally omnipotent being is an entity that can be omnipotent for a temporary period of time, and then becomes non-omnipotent. The omnipotence paradox can be applied to each type of being differently.\nIn addition, some philosophers have considered the assumption that a being is either omnipotent or non-omnipotent to be a false dilemma, as it neglects the possibility of varying degrees of omnipotence. Some modern approaches to the problem have involved semantic debates over whether language\u2014and therefore philosophy\u2014can meaningfully address the concept of omnipotence itself.\nProposed answers.\nOmnipotence does not mean breaking the laws of logic.\nA common response from philosophers is that the paradox assumes a wrong definition of omnipotence. Omnipotence, they say, does not mean that God can do anything \"at all\" but, instead, that he can do anything that is \"logically\" possible; he cannot, for instance, make a square circle. Likewise, God cannot make a being greater than himself, because he is, by definition, the greatest possible being. God is limited in his actions by his nature. The Christian Bible, in passages such as Hebrews 6:18, says it is \"impossible for God to lie\".\nA good example of a modern defender of this line of reasoning is George I. Mavrodes. Essentially, Mavrodes argues that it is not a limitation on a being's omnipotence to say that it cannot make a round square. Such a \"task\" is termed by him a \"pseudo-task\" as it is self-contradictory and inherently nonsensical. Harry Frankfurt\u2014following from Ren\u00e9 Descartes\u2014has responded to this solution with a proposal of his own: that God can create a stone impossible to lift and also lift said stone.\nFor why should God not be able to perform the task in question? To be sure, it is a task\u2014the task of lifting a stone which He cannot lift\u2014whose description is self-contradictory. But if God is supposedly capable of performing one task whose description is self-contradictory\u2014that of creating the problematic stone in the first place\u2014why should He not be supposedly capable of performing another\u2014that of lifting the stone? After all, is there any greater trick in performing two logically impossible tasks than there is in performing one?\nIf a being is \"accidentally\" omnipotent, it can resolve the paradox by creating a stone it cannot lift, thereby becoming non-omnipotent. Unlike essentially omnipotent entities, it is possible for an accidentally omnipotent being to be non-omnipotent. This raises the question, however, of whether the being was ever truly omnipotent, or just capable of great power. On the other hand, the ability to voluntarily give up great power is often thought of as central to the Christian doctrine of incarnation.\nIf a being is \"essentially\" omnipotent, it can also resolve the paradox. The omnipotent being is essentially omnipotent; therefore, it is impossible to be non-omnipotent. Further, the omnipotent being can do what is logically impossible\u2014just like the accidentally omnipotent\u2014and have no limitations except the inability to become non-omnipotent. The omnipotent being cannot create a stone it cannot lift.\nThe omnipotent being cannot create such a stone because its power is equal to itself, thus removing the omnipotence, for there can only be one omnipotent being, but it nevertheless retains its omnipotence. This solution works even with definition 2, as long as we also know the being is essentially omnipotent rather than accidentally so. However, non-omnipotent beings can compromise their own powers, which presents the paradox that non-omnipotent beings can do something (to themselves) which an essentially omnipotent being cannot do (to itself). This was essentially the position Augustine of Hippo took in his \"The City of God\":\nFor He is called omnipotent on account of His doing what He wills, not on account of His suffering what He wills not; for if that should befall Him, He would by no means be omnipotent. Wherefore, He cannot do some things for the very reason that He is omnipotent.\nThus, Augustine argued that God could not do anything or create any situation that would, in effect, make God not God.\nIn a 1955 article in the philosophy journal \"Mind\", J. L. Mackie tried to resolve the paradox by distinguishing between first-order omnipotence (unlimited power to act) and second-order omnipotence (unlimited power to determine what powers to act things shall have). An omnipotent being with both first and second-order omnipotence at a particular time might restrict its own power to act and, henceforth, cease to be all-powerful in either sense. There has been considerable philosophical dispute since Mackie about the best way to formulate the paradox of omnipotence in formal logic. More recently, Budaev trivialized the paradox of the stone by converting it to an arithmetic form: \"Can a person make such a big number that he/she cannot imagine a number greater than that?\", apparently resulting in a solution similar to that by Savage: \"One can imagine any number and always make an even bigger number\".\nAlthough the most common translation of the noun \"Logos\" is \"Word\" other translations have been used. Gordon Clark (1902\u20131985), a Calvinist theologian and expert on pre-Socratic philosophy, famously translated Logos as \"Logic\": \"In the beginning was the Logic, and the Logic was with God and the Logic was God\". He meant to imply by this translation that the laws of logic were derived from God and formed part of Creation, and were therefore not a secular principle imposed on the Christian world view.God obeys the laws of logic because God is eternally logical in the same way that God does not perform evil actions because God is eternally good. So, God, by nature logical and unable to violate the laws of logic, cannot make a boulder so heavy he cannot lift it because that would violate the law of non contradiction by creating an immovable object and an unstoppable force.This raises the question, similar to the Euthyphro Dilemma, of where this law of logic, which God is bound to obey, comes from. According to the theologians Norman Geisler and William Lane Craig, this law is not a law above God that he assents to but, rather, logic is an eternal part of God's nature, like his omniscience or omnibenevolence.\nParadox is meaningless: the question is sophistry.\nAnother common response is that since God is supposedly omnipotent, the phrase \"could not lift\" does not make sense, and the paradox is meaningless. This may mean that the complexity involved in rightly understanding omnipotence\u2014contra all the logical details involved in misunderstanding it\u2014is a function of the fact that omnipotence, like infinity, is perceived at all by contrasting reference to those complex and variable things, \"which it is not\". An alternative meaning, however, is that a non-corporeal God cannot lift anything, but can raise it (a linguistic pedantry)\u2014or to use the beliefs of Hindus (that there is one God, who can be manifest as several different beings), that whilst it is possible for God to do all things, it is not possible for all his incarnations to do them. As such, God could create a stone so heavy that, in one incarnation, he could not lift it, yet could do something that an incarnation that \"could\" lift the stone could not.\nThe lifting a rock paradox (\"Can God lift a stone larger than he can carry?\") uses human characteristics to cover up the main skeletal structure of the question. With these assumptions made, two arguments can stem from them:\nThe act of killing oneself is not applicable to an omnipotent being, since, despite that such an act does involve some power, it also involves a \"lack\" of power: the human person who can kill himself is already not indestructible, and, in fact, every agent constituting his environment is more powerful in some ways than himself. In other words, all non-omnipotent agents are concretely \"synthetic\": constructed as contingencies of other, smaller, agents, meaning that they, unlike an omnipotent agent, logically can exist not only in multiple instantiation (by being constructed out of the more basic agents they are made of), but are each bound to a different location in space contra transcendent omnipresence.\nGeorge I. Mavrodes responded to this paradox by arguing that the question is self-contradictory. He wrote:\"On the assumption that God is omnipotent, the phrase \"a stone too heavy for God to lift\" becomes self-contradictory. For it becomes \"a stone which cannot be lifted by Him whose power is sufficient for lifting anything.\"...\n...it is the very omnipotence of God which makes the existence of such a stone absolutely impossible, while it is the fact that I am finite in power that makes it possible for me to make a boat too heavy for me to lift.\"\nAdditionally, he also points out how the question is sophistry. If the objector insists that it is a coherent question, one replies by affirming that God can create such a stone. It may seem that this reply will force one into the original dilemma. But it does not. For now, the objector can draw no damaging conclusion from this answer. And the reason is that he has just now contended that such a stone is compatible with the omnipotence of God. Therefore, from the possibility of God's creating such a stone, it cannot be concluded that God is not omnipotent. The objector cannot have it both ways. The conclusion that the objector wishes to draw from an affirmative answer to the original question is that the required proof that the descriptive phrase appears there is self-contradictory.\nC. S. Lewis argues that when talking about omnipotence, referencing \"a rock so heavy that God cannot lift it\" is nonsense just as much as referencing \"a square circle\"; that it is not logically coherent in terms of power to think that omnipotence includes the power to do the logically impossible. So asking \"Can God create a rock so heavy that even he cannot lift it?\" is just as much nonsense as asking \"Can God draw a square circle?\" The logical contradiction here is God's simultaneous ability and disability in lifting the rock: the statement \"God can lift this rock\" must have a truth value of either true or false; it cannot possess both. This is justified by observing that for the omnipotent agent to create such a stone, it must already be more powerful than itself: such a stone is too heavy for the omnipotent agent to lift, but the omnipotent agent already can create such a stone; If an omnipotent agent already is more powerful than itself, then it already is just that powerful. This means that its power to create a stone too heavy to lift is identical to its power to lift that very stone. While this does not quite make complete sense, Lewis wished to stress its implicit point: that even within the attempt to prove that the concept of omnipotence is immediately incoherent, one admits that it is immediately coherent, and that the only difference is that this attempt is forced to admit this despite that the attempt is constituted by a perfectly irrational route to its own unwilling end, with a perfectly irrational set of 'things' included in that end.\nIn other words, the 'limit' on what omnipotence 'can' do is not a \"limit\" on its actual agency, but an \"epistemological boundary\" without which omnipotence could not be \"identified\" (paradoxically or otherwise) in the first place. This process is merely a fancier form of the classic Liar Paradox: If I say, \"I am a liar\", then how can it be true if I am telling the truth therewith, and, if I am telling the truth therewith, then how can I be a liar? So, to think that omnipotence is an \"epistemological\" paradox is like failing to recognize that, when taking the statement, 'I am a liar' self-referentially, the statement is reduced to an actual failure to lie. In other words, if one maintains the supposedly 'initial' position that the necessary conception of omnipotence includes the 'power' to compromise both itself and all other identity, and if one concludes from this position that omnipotence is epistemologically incoherent, then one implicitly is asserting that one's own 'initial' position is incoherent. Therefore, the question (and thus the perceived paradox) is meaningless. Nonsense does not suddenly acquire sense and meaning by adding the words \"God can\" before it. Lewis additionally said that, \"Unless something is self-evident, nothing can be proved\". This implies for the debate on omnipotence that, \"as in matter, so in the human understanding of truth: it takes no true insight to destroy a perfectly integrated structure, and the effort to destroy has greater effect than an equal effort to build; so, a man is thought a fool who assumes its integrity, and thought an abomination who argues for it. It is easier to teach a fish to swim in outer space than to convince a room full of ignorant fools why it cannot be done.\"\nParadox assumes the rock has already been created\nIn 1999, Matthew Whittle asserts that it should not be outside the scope of powers for an omnipotent being to make itself non-omnipotent, so indeed making a rock too heavy to lift is possible for God. The follow-up question, \"Then can he lift it?\" assumes that the rock has already been created, so the correct answer would be \"Assuming he makes the rock, no\". And if asked, \"Is God thus not all powerful?\", the correct answer would be, \"God is indeed all powerful until such time as the rock is created\". The \"Paradox\" then is not really a paradox.\nLanguage and omnipotence.\nThe philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein is frequently interpreted as arguing that language is not up to the task of describing the kind of power an omnipotent being would have. In his \"Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus\", he stays generally within the realm of logical positivism until claim 6.4\u2014but at 6.41 and following, he argues that ethics and several other issues are \"transcendental\" subjects that we cannot examine with language. Wittgenstein also mentions the will, life after death, and God\u2014arguing that, \"When the answer cannot be put into words, neither can the question be put into words\".\nWittgenstein's work expresses the omnipotence paradox as a problem in semantics\u2014the study of how we give symbols meaning. (The retort \"That's only semantics,\" is a way of saying that a statement only concerns the definitions of words, instead of anything important in the physical world.) According to the \"Tractatus,\" then, even attempting to formulate the omnipotence paradox is futile, since language cannot refer to the entities the paradox considers. The final proposition of the \"Tractatus\" gives Wittgenstein's dictum for these circumstances: \"What we cannot speak of, we must pass over in silence\".\nWittgenstein's approach to these problems is influential among other 20th century religious thinkers such as Dewi Zephaniah Phillips. In his later years, however, Wittgenstein wrote works often interpreted as conflicting with his positions in the \"Tractatus\", and indeed the later Wittgenstein is mainly seen as the leading critic of the early Wittgenstein.\nOther versions of the paradox.\nThe 6th-century Christian theologian Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite claims that a version of the omnipotence paradox constituted the dispute between Paul the Apostle and Elymas the Magician mentioned in Acts 13:8, but it is phrased in terms of a debate as to whether God can \"deny himself\" a'la 2 Tim 2:13. In the 11th century, Anselm of Canterbury argues that there are many things that God cannot do, but that nonetheless he counts as omnipotent.\nThomas Aquinas advanced a version of the omnipotence paradox by asking whether God could create a triangle with internal angles that did not add up to 180 degrees. As Thomas put it in \"Summa contra Gentiles\":\nSince the principles of certain sciences, such as logic, geometry and arithmetic are taken only from the formal principles of things, on which the essence of the thing depends, it follows that God could not make things contrary to these principles. For example, that a genus was not predicable of the species, or that lines drawn from the centre to the circumference were not equal, or that a triangle did not have three angles equal to two right angles.\nThis can be done on a sphere, and not on a flat surface. The later invention of non-Euclidean geometry does not resolve this question; for one might as well ask, \"If given the axioms of Riemannian geometry, can an omnipotent being create a triangle whose angles \"do not\" add up to \"more\" than 180 degrees?\" In either case, the real question is whether an omnipotent being would have the ability to evade consequences that follow logically from a system of axioms that the being created.\nA version of the paradox can also be seen in non-theological contexts. A similar problem occurs when accessing legislative or parliamentary sovereignty, which holds a specific legal institution to be omnipotent in legal power, and in particular such an institution's ability to regulate itself.\nIn a sense, the classic statement of the omnipotence paradox\u2014a rock so heavy that its omnipotent creator cannot lift it\u2014is grounded in Aristotelian science. After all, if we consider the stone's position relative to the sun the planet orbits around, one could hold that the stone is \"constantly\" lifted\u2014strained though that interpretation would be in the present context. Modern physics indicates that the choice of phrasing about lifting stones should relate to acceleration; however, this does not in itself of course invalidate the fundamental concept of the generalized omnipotence paradox. However, one could easily modify the classic statement as follows: \"An omnipotent being creates a universe that follows the laws of Aristotelian physics. Within this universe, can the omnipotent being create a stone so heavy that the being cannot lift it?\"\nEthan Allen's \"Reason\" addresses the topics of original sin, theodicy and several others in classic Age of Enlightenment fashion. In Chapter 3, section IV, he notes that \"omnipotence itself\" could not exempt animal life from mortality, since change and death are defining attributes of such life. He argues, \"the one cannot be without the other, any more than there could be a compact number of mountains without valleys, or that I could exist and not exist at the same time, or that God should effect any other contradiction in nature\". Labeled by his friends a Deist, Allen accepted the notion of a divine being, though throughout \"Reason\" he argues that even a divine being must be circumscribed by logic.\nIn \"Principles of Philosophy,\" Descartes tried refuting the existence of atoms with a variation of this argument, claiming God could not create things so indivisible that he could not divide them.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is situated north of the Lower Danube and south of the Southern Carpathians. Wallachia was traditionally divided into two sections, Muntenia (Greater Wallachia) and Oltenia (Lesser Wallachia). Dobruja could sometimes be considered a third section due to its proximity and brief rule over it. Wallachia as a whole is sometimes referred to as Muntenia through identification with the larger of the two traditional sections.\nWallachia began to form as a principality around the 13th century, following the gradual unification of several smaller Romanian political entities. By 1330, the state had consolidated following Basarab I's victory in the Battle of Posada against the Kingdom of Hungary, ushering in a period of relative independence. In 1417, Wallachia was forced to accept the suzerainty of the Ottoman Empire for the first time; this suzerainty lasted until the mid-19th century. However in general Wallachia was able to preserve autonomy within the Empire as well as experience interruptions to Ottoman rule brought about by local rulers such as Vlad the Impaler and Michael the Brave and later external powers such as the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Russian Empire.\nIn 1859, Wallachia united with Moldavia to form the United Principalities, which adopted the name \"Romania\" in 1866 and officially became the Kingdom of Romania in 1881. Later, following the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the resolution of the elected representatives of Romanians in 1918, Bukovina, Transylvania and parts of Banat, Cri\u0219ana, and Maramure\u0219 were allocated to the Kingdom of Romania, thereby forming the modern Romanian state.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"Wallachia\" is an exonym, generally not used by Romanians themselves, who used the denomination \"\u021aara Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103\" \u2013 Romanian Country or Romanian Land, although it does appear in some Romanian texts as \"Valahia\" or \"Vlahia\". It derives from the term \"walhaz\" used by Germanic peoples and Early Slavs to refer to Romans and other speakers of foreign languages. It was used to designate Gaulic-speakers(see Wales and Cornwall) and Romance-speakers(see Wallonia and Meg\u00e1l\u0113 Vlach\u00eda); and subsequently, due to the survival of the Romance-speaking communities in the eastern parts as pastoralists, shepherds in general(association made by the Hellenes, Magyars, and Serbo-Croats).\nIn Slavonic texts of the Early Middle Ages, the name \"\" ( or \"Hungaro-Wallachian Land\") was also used as a designation for the region. The term, translated in Romanian as \"Ungrovalahia\", remained in use up to the modern era in a religious context, referring to the Romanian Orthodox Metropolitan seat of Hungaro-Wallachia, in contrast to Thessalian or Great Vlachia in Greece or Small Wallachia (Mala Vla\u0161ka) in Serbia. The Romanian-language designations of the state were Muntenia (The Land of Mountains), \u021aara Rum\u00e2neasc\u0103 (the Romanian Land), Valahia, and, rarely, Rom\u00e2nia. The spelling variant \"\u021aara Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103\" was adopted in official documents by the mid-19th century; however, the version with \"u\" remained common in local dialects until much later.\nFor long periods after the 14th century, Wallachia was referred to as ' () by Bulgarian sources, ' () by Serbian sources, ' () by Ukrainian sources, and ' or ' by German-speaking (most notably Transylvanian Saxon) sources. The traditional Hungarian name for Wallachia is ', literally \"Snowy lowlands\", the older form of which is ', meaning \"Land beyond the snowy mountains\" (\"snowy mountains\" refers to the Southern Carpathians (the Transylvanian Alps)); its translation into Latin, ' was used in the official royal documents of the Kingdom of Hungary. In Ottoman Turkish, the term ', or simply ' , appears. In old Albanian, the name was \"Gog\u00ebnia\", which was used to denote non-Albanian speakers.\nArabic chronicles from the 13th century had used the name of Wallachia instead of Bulgaria. They gave the coordinates of Wallachia and specified that Wallachia was named ' and the dwellers ' or \"\".\nThe area of Oltenia in Wallachia was also known in Turkish as \"Kara-Eflak\" (\"Black Wallachia\") and \"K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck-Eflak\" (\"Little Wallachia\"), while the former has also been used for Moldavia.\nHistory.\nAncient times.\nIn the Second Dacian War (AD 105) western Oltenia became part of the Roman province of Dacia, with parts of later Wallachia included in the Moesia Inferior province. The Roman \"limes\" was initially built along the Olt River in 119 before being moved slightly to the east in the second century, during which time it stretched from the Danube up to Ruc\u0103r in the Carpathians. The Roman line fell back to the Olt in 245 and, in 271, the Romans pulled out of the region.\nThe area was subject to Romanization also during the Migration Period, when most of present-day Romania was also invaded by Goths and Sarmatians known as the Chernyakhov culture, followed by waves of other nomads. In 328, the Romans built a bridge between Sucidava and Oescus (near Gigen) which indicates that there was a significant trade with the peoples north of the Danube. A short period of Roman rule in the area is attested under Emperor Constantine the Great, after he attacked the Goths (who had settled north of the Danube) in 332. The period of Goth rule ended when the Huns arrived in the Pannonian Basin and, under Attila, attacked and destroyed some 170 settlements on both sides of the Danube.\nEarly Middle Ages.\nByzantine influence is evident during the fifth to sixth century, such as the site at Ipote\u0219ti\u2013C\u00e2nde\u0219ti culture, but from the second half of the sixth century and in the seventh century, Slavs crossed the territory of Wallachia and settled in it, on their way to Byzantium, occupying the southern bank of the Danube. In 593, the Byzantine commander-in-chief Priscus defeated Slavs, Avars and Gepids on future Wallachian territory, and, in 602, Slavs suffered a crucial defeat in the area; Flavius Mauricius Tiberius, who ordered his army to be deployed north of the Danube, encountered his troops' strong opposition.\nFrom its establishment in 681 to approximately the Hungarians' conquest of Transylvania in the middle of the tenth century, the First Bulgarian Empire controlled the territory of Wallachia. With the decline and subsequent Byzantine conquest of Bulgaria (from the second half of the tenth century up to 1018), Wallachia came under the control of the Pechenegs, Turkic peoples who extended their rule west through the tenth and 11th century, until they were defeated around 1091, when the Cumans of southern Ruthenia took control of the lands of Wallachia.\nBeginning with the tenth century, Byzantine, Bulgarian, Hungarian, and later Western sources mention the existence of small polities, possibly peopled by, among others, Vlachs led by \"knyazes\" and \"voivodes\".\nWhen the Latin empire was established in 1204, the territories in the northern borders of this Venetian creation were named \"Wallachia &amp; Bulgaria\" or \"Second Bulgarian Empire\". An alternative name used in connection with the pre-mid 13th century period is the \"Empire of Vlachs and Bulgarians\". Variant names include the \"Vlach\u2013Bulgarian Empire\" and the \"Bulgarian\u2013Wallachian Empire\".\nIn 1241, during the Mongol invasion of Europe, Cuman domination was ended\u2014a direct Mongol rule over Wallachia was not attested. Part of Wallachia was probably briefly disputed by the Kingdom of Hungary and Bulgarians in the following period, but it appears that the severe weakening of Hungarian authority during the Mongol attacks contributed to the establishment of the new and stronger polities attested in Wallachia for the following decades.\nEstablishment of state.\nThroughout the 13th century, numerous records of Vlach political entities on both sides of the Carpathians had begun to emerge. One of the first written pieces of evidence in correlation to local Vlach voivodes concerns the ruler Litovoi, who was first mentioned in the Diploma of the Joannites in 1247. Litvoi ruled over the \u021aara Litua, corresponding to modern day northern Oltenia. By 1272, Litvoi had gained control over more land on each side of the Carpathians, specifically further along the northern Wallachian Plain and Ha\u021beg Country in Transylvania. Litvoi refused to pay tribute to King Ladislaus IV of Hungary, and in 1277 war broke out with the Hungarians, where he died in battle before 1280. His successor was his brother B\u0103rbat, who ruled until 1288. The continuing weakening of the Hungarian state by further Mongol invasions in the late 13th and early 14th century, as well as the fall of the \u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty, further paved the way for the gradual unification of Wallachian polities and the assertion of independence from Hungarian rule.\nWallachia's creation is held by local traditions and folk tale to have been the work of Radu Negru, a legendary figure who according to tradition, crossed the Carpathians from Transylvania to the Wallachian Plain in 1290 alongside a large following of fellow Vlachs in order to establish the nation. Radu Negru is typically connected with Basarab I of Wallachia, who was first mentioned in a Hungarian charter in 1324, as a voivode who held lands south of the Carpathians and paid tribute to Hungary. Throughout the rest of the 1320s, Basarab expanded his influence, seizing control of the Banate of Severin and launching raids into Transylvania. By 1330, Basarab had established his rule over both sides of the river Olt as well as come into ownership of fiefs in Transylvania, establishing his residence in C\u00e2mpulung as the first ruler of the House of Basarab. Basarab refused to grant Hungary the lands of F\u0103g\u0103ra\u0219, Alma\u0219 and Severin and pay tribute to Charles I of Hungary, who invaded Wallachia but was decisively defeated at the Battle of Posada, which led to the consolidation of the Wallachian state. According to historian \u0218tefan \u0218tef\u0103nescu, Basarab extended his lands to the east, to briefly comprise lands as far as Chillia Nou\u01ce in the Bugeac - reportedly providing the origin of \"Bessarabia.\"\nThere is evidence that the Second Bulgarian Empire ruled at least nominally the Wallachian lands up to the Ruc\u0103r\u2013Bran corridor as late as the late 14th century. In a charter by Radu I, the Wallachian voivode requests that tsar Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria order his customs officers at Ruc\u0103r and the D\u00e2mbovi\u0163a River bridge to collect tax following the law. The presence of Bulgarian customs officers at the Carpathians indicates a Bulgarian suzerainty over those lands, though Radu's imperative tone hints at a strong and increasing Wallachian autonomy. The medieval structure of Wallachia was modelled after the Bulgarian one, including the adoption of Old Church Slavonic feudal terminology such as - inherited land. Under Radu I and his successor Dan I, the realms in Transylvania and Severin continued to be disputed with Hungary. Basarab was succeeded by Nicholas Alexander, followed by Vladislav I. Vladislav attacked Transylvania after Louis I occupied lands south of the Danube, conceded to recognize him as overlord in 1368, but rebelled again in the same year; his rule also witnessed the first confrontation between Wallachia and the Ottoman Empire (a battle in which Vladislav was allied with Ivan Shishman).\n1400\u20131600.\nMircea the Elder to Radu the Great.\nAs the entire Balkans became an integral part of the growing Ottoman Empire (a process that concluded with the fall of Constantinople to Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror in 1453), Wallachia became engaged in frequent confrontations in the final years of the reign of Mircea I (r. 1386\u20131418). Mircea initially defeated the Ottomans in several battles, including the Battle of Rovine in 1394, driving them away from Dobruja and briefly extending his rule to the Danube Delta, Dobruja and Silistra (c. 1400\u20131404). He swung between alliances with Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor, and Jagiellon Poland (taking part in the Battle of Nicopolis), and accepted a peace treaty with the Ottomans in 1417, after Mehmed I took control of Turnu M\u0103gurele and Giurgiu. The two ports remained part of the Ottoman state, with brief interruptions, until 1829. In 1418\u20131420, Michael I defeated the Ottomans in Severin, only to be killed in battle by the counter-offensive; in 1422, the danger was averted for a short while when Dan II inflicted a defeat on Murad II with the help of Pippo Spano.\nThe peace signed in 1428 inaugurated a period of internal crisis, as Dan had to defend himself against Radu II, who led the first in a series of boyar coalitions against established princes. Victorious in 1431 (the year when the boyar-backed Alexander I Aldea took the throne), boyars were dealt successive blows by Vlad II Dracul (1436\u20131442; 1443\u20131447), who nevertheless attempted to compromise between the Ottoman Sultan and the Holy Roman Empire.\nThe following decade was marked by the conflict between the rival houses of D\u0103ne\u0219ti and Dr\u0103cule\u0219ti. Faced with both internal and external conflict, Vlad II Dracul reluctantly agreed to pay the tribute demanded of him by the Ottoman Empire, despite his affiliation with the Order of the Dragon, a group of independent noblemen whose creed had been to repel the Ottoman invasion. As part of the tribute, the sons of Vlad II Dracul (Radu cel Frumos and Vlad III Dracula) were taken into Ottoman custody. Recognizing the Christian resistance to their invasion, leaders of the Ottoman Empire released Vlad III to rule in 1448 after his father's assassination in 1447.\nKnown as Vlad III the Impaler or Vlad III Dracula, he immediately put to death the boyars who had conspired against his father, and was characterized as both a national hero and a cruel tyrant. He was cheered for restoring order to a destabilized principality, yet showed no mercy toward thieves, murderers or anyone who plotted against his rule. Vlad demonstrated his intolerance for criminals by utilizing impalement as a form of execution. Vlad fiercely resisted Ottoman rule, having both repelled the Ottomans and been pushed back several times.\nThe Transylvanian Saxons were also furious with him for strengthening the borders of Wallachia, which interfered with their control of trade routes. In retaliation, the Saxons distributed grotesque poems of cruelty and other propaganda, demonizing Vlad III Dracula as a drinker of blood. These tales strongly influenced an eruption of vampiric fiction throughout the West and, in particular, Germany. They also inspired the main character in the 1897 Gothic novel \"Dracula\" by Bram Stoker.\nIn 1462, Vlad III was defeated by Mehmed the Conqueror during his offensive at the Night Attack at T\u00e2rgovi\u015fte before being forced to retreat to T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te and accepting to pay an increased tribute. Meanwhile, Vlad III faced parallel conflicts with his brother, Radu cel Frumos, (r. 1437/1439\u20131475), and Basarab Laiot\u0103 cel B\u0103tr\u00e2n. This led to the conquest of Wallachia by Radu, who would face his own struggles with the resurgent Vlad III and Basarab Laiot\u0103 cel B\u0103tr\u00e2n during his 11-year reign. Subsequently, Radu IV the Great (Radu cel Mare, who ruled 1495\u20131508) reached several compromises with the boyars, ensuring a period of internal stability that contrasted his clash with Bogdan III the One-Eyed of Moldavia.\nMihnea cel R\u0103u to Petru Cercel.\nThe late 15th century saw the ascension of the powerful Craiove\u0219ti family, virtually independent rulers of the Oltenian banat, who sought Ottoman support in their rivalry with Mihnea cel R\u0103u (1508\u20131510) and replaced him with Vl\u0103du\u021b. After the latter proved to be hostile to the bans, the House of Basarab formally ended with the rise of Neagoe Basarab, a Craiove\u015fti. Neagoe's peaceful rule (1512\u20131521) was noted for its cultural aspects (the building of the Curtea de Arge\u015f Cathedral and Renaissance influences). It was also a period of increased influence for the Saxon merchants in Bra\u0219ov and Sibiu, and of Wallachia's alliance with Louis II of Hungary. Under Teodosie, the country was again under a four-month-long Ottoman occupation, a military administration that seemed to be an attempt to create a Wallachian \"Pashaluk\". This danger rallied all boyars in support of Radu de la Afuma\u0163i (four rules between 1522 and 1529), who lost the battle after an agreement between the Craiove\u0219ti and Sultan S\u00fcleyman the Magnificent; Prince Radu eventually confirmed S\u00fcleyman's position as suzerain and agreed to pay an even higher tribute.\nOttoman suzerainty remained virtually unchallenged throughout the following 90 years. Radu Paisie, who was deposed by S\u00fcleyman in 1545, ceded the port of Br\u0103ila to the Ottoman administration in the same year. His successor Mircea Ciobanul (1545\u20131554; 1558\u20131559), a prince without any claim to noble heritage, was imposed on the throne and consequently agreed to a decrease in autonomy (increasing taxes and carrying out an armed intervention in Transylvania \u2013 supporting the pro-Turkish John Z\u00e1polya). Conflicts between boyar families became stringent after the rule of P\u0103tra\u0219cu the Good, and boyar ascendancy over rulers was obvious under Petru the Younger (1559\u20131568; a reign dominated by Doamna Chiajna and marked by huge increases in taxes), Mihnea Turcitul, and Petru Cercel.\nThe Ottoman Empire increasingly relied on Wallachia and Moldavia for the supply and maintenance of its military forces; the local army, however, soon disappeared due to the increased costs and the much more obvious efficiency of mercenary troops.\n17th century.\nInitially profiting from Ottoman support, Michael the Brave ascended to the throne in 1593, and attacked the troops of Murad III north and south of the Danube in an alliance with Transylvania's Sigismund B\u00e1thory and Moldavia's Aron Vod\u0103 (see Battle of C\u0103lug\u0103reni). He soon placed himself under the suzerainty of Rudolf II, the Holy Roman Emperor, and, in 1599\u20131600, intervened in Transylvania against Poland's king Sigismund III Vasa, placing the region under his authority; his brief rule also extended to Moldavia later in the following year. For a brief period, Michael the Brave ruled (in a personal, but not formal, union) most of the territories where Romanians lived, rebuilding the base of the ancient Kingdom of Dacia. The rule of Michael the Brave, with its break with Ottoman rule, tense relations with other European powers and the leadership of the three states, was considered in later periods as the precursor of a modern Romania, a thesis which was argued with noted intensity by Nicolae B\u0103lcescu. Following Michael's downfall, Wallachia was occupied by the Polish\u2013Moldavian army of Simion Movil\u0103 (see Moldavian Magnate Wars), who held the region until 1602, and was subject to Nogai attacks in the same year.\nThe last stage in the Growth of the Ottoman Empire brought increased pressures on Wallachia: political control was accompanied by Ottoman economical hegemony, the discarding of the capital in T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te in favour of Bucharest (closer to the Ottoman border, and a rapidly growing trade center), the establishment of serfdom under Michael the Brave as a measure to increase manorial revenues, and the decrease in the importance of low-ranking boyars (threatened with extinction, they took part in the \"seimeni\" rebellion of 1655). Furthermore, the growing importance of appointment to high office in front of land ownership brought about an influx of Greek and Levantine families, a process already resented by locals during the rules of Radu Mihnea in the early 17th century. Matei Basarab, a boyar appointee, brought a long period of relative peace (1632\u20131654), with the noted exception of the 1653 Battle of Finta, fought between Wallachians and the troops of Moldavian prince Vasile Lupu\u2014ending in disaster for the latter, who was replaced with Prince Matei's favourite, Gheorghe \u0218tefan, on the throne in Ia\u0219i. A close alliance between Gheorghe \u0218tefan and Matei's successor Constantin \u0218erban was maintained by Transylvania's George II R\u00e1k\u00f3czi, but their designs for independence from Ottoman rule were crushed by the troops of Mehmed IV in 1658\u20131659. The reigns of Gheorghe Ghica and Grigore I Ghica, the sultan's favourites, signified attempts to prevent such incidents; however, they were also the onset of a violent clash between the B\u0103leanu and Cantacuzino boyar families, which was to mark Wallachia's history until the 1680s. The Cantacuzinos, threatened by the alliance between the B\u0103leanus and the Ghicas, backed their own choice of princes (Antonie Vod\u0103 din Pope\u0219ti and George Ducas) before promoting themselves\u2014with the ascension of \u0218erban Cantacuzino (1678\u20131688).\nRusso-Turkish Wars and the Phanariotes.\nWallachia became a target for Habsburg incursions during the last stages of the Great Turkish War around 1690, when the ruler Constantin Br\u00e2ncoveanu secretly and unsuccessfully negotiated an anti-Ottoman coalition. Br\u00e2ncoveanu's reign (1688\u20131714), noted for its late Renaissance cultural achievements (see Br\u00e2ncovenesc style), also coincided with the rise of Imperial Russia under Tsar Peter the Great\u2014he was approached by the latter during the Russo-Turkish War of 1710\u20131713, and lost his throne and life sometime after sultan Ahmed III caught news of the negotiations. Despite his denunciation of Br\u00e2ncoveanu's policies, \u0218tefan Cantacuzino attached himself to Habsburg projects and opened the country to the armies of Prince Eugene of Savoy; he was himself deposed and executed in 1716.\nImmediately following the deposition of Prince \u0218tefan, the Ottomans renounced the purely nominal elective system (which had by then already witnessed the decrease in importance of the Boyar Divan over the sultan's decision), and princes of the two Danubian Principalities were appointed from the Phanariotes of Constantinople. Inaugurated by Nicholas Mavrocordatos in Moldavia after Dimitrie Cantemir, Phanariote rule was brought to Wallachia in 1715 by the very same ruler. The tense relations between boyars and princes brought a decrease in the number of taxed people (as a privilege gained by the former), a subsequent increase in total taxes, and the enlarged powers of a boyar circle in the Divan.\nIn parallel, Wallachia became the battleground in a succession of wars between the Ottomans on one side and Russia or the Habsburg monarchy on the other. Mavrocordatos himself was deposed by a boyar rebellion, and arrested by Habsburg troops during the Austro-Turkish War of 1716\u20131718, as the Ottomans had to concede Oltenia to Charles VI of Austria (the Treaty of Passarowitz). The region, organized as the Banat of Craiova and subject to an enlightened absolutist rule that soon disenchanted local boyars, was returned to Wallachia in 1739 (the Treaty of Belgrade, upon the close of the Austro-Russian\u2013Turkish War). Prince Constantine Mavrocordatos, who oversaw the new change in borders, was also responsible for the effective abolition of serfdom in 1746 (which put a stop to the exodus of peasants into Transylvania); during this period, the ban of Oltenia moved his residence from Craiova to Bucharest, signalling, alongside Mavrocordatos' order to merge his personal treasury with that of the country, a move towards centralism.\nIn 1768, during the Fifth Russo-Turkish War, Wallachia was placed under its first Russian occupation (helped along by the rebellion of P\u00e2rvu Cantacuzino). The Treaty of K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Kaynarca (1774) allowed Russia to intervene in favour of Eastern Orthodox Ottoman subjects, curtailing Ottoman pressures\u2014including the decrease in sums owed as tribute\u2014and, in time, relatively increasing internal stability while opening Wallachia to more Russian interventions.\nHabsburg troops, under Prince Josias of Coburg, again entered the country during the Russo-Turkish-Austrian War, deposing Nicholas Mavrogenes in 1789. A period of crisis followed the Ottoman recovery: Oltenia was devastated by the expeditions of Osman Pazvanto\u011flu, a powerful rebellious pasha whose raids even caused Prince Constantine Hangerli to lose his life on suspicion of treason (1799), and Alexander Mourousis to renounce his throne (1801). In 1806, the Russo-Turkish War of 1806\u20131812 was partly instigated by the Porte's deposition of Constantine Ypsilantis in Bucharest\u2014in tune with the Napoleonic Wars, it was instigated by the French Empire, and also showed the impact of the Treaty of K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Kaynarca (with its permissive attitude towards Russian political influence in the Danubian Principalities); the war brought the invasion of Mikhail Andreyevich Miloradovich. After the Peace of Bucharest, the rule of Jean Georges Caradja, although remembered for a major plague epidemic, was notable for its cultural and industrial ventures. During the period, Wallachia increased its strategic importance for most European states interested in supervising Russian expansion; consulates were opened in Bucharest, having an indirect but major impact on Wallachian economy through the protection they extended to \"Sudi\u021bi\" traders (who soon competed successfully against local guilds).\nFrom Wallachia to Romania.\nEarly 19th century.\nThe death of prince Alexander Soutzos in 1821, coinciding with the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence, established a boyar regency which attempted to block the arrival of Scarlat Callimachi to his throne in Bucharest. The parallel uprising in Oltenia, carried out by the Pandur leader Tudor Vladimirescu, although aimed at overthrowing the ascendancy of Greeks, compromised with the Greek revolutionaries in the Filiki Eteria and allied itself with the regents, while seeking Russian support (see also: Rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire).\nOn 21 March 1821 Vladimirescu entered Bucharest. For the following weeks, relations between him and his allies worsened, especially after he sought an agreement with the Ottomans; Eteria's leader Alexander Ypsilantis, who had established himself in Moldavia and, after May, in northern Wallachia, viewed the alliance as broken\u2014he had Vladimirescu executed, and faced the Ottoman intervention without Pandur or Russian backing, suffering major defeats in Bucharest and Dr\u0103g\u0103\u0219ani (before retreating to Austrian custody in Transylvania). These violent events, which had seen the majority of Phanariotes siding with Ypsilantis, made Sultan Mahmud II place the Principalities under its occupation (evicted by a request of several European powers), and sanction the end of Phanariote rules: in Wallachia, the first prince to be considered a local one after 1715 was Grigore IV Ghica. Although the new system was confirmed for the rest of Wallachia's existence as a state, Ghica's rule was abruptly ended by the devastating Russo-Turkish War of 1828\u20131829.\nThe 1829 Treaty of Adrianople placed Wallachia and Moldavia under Russian military rule, without overturning Ottoman suzerainty, awarding them the first common institutions and semblance of a constitution (see Regulamentul Organic). Wallachia was returned ownership of Br\u0103ila, Giurgiu (both of which soon developed into major trading cities on the Danube), and Turnu M\u0103gurele. The treaty also allowed Moldavia and Wallachia to freely trade with countries other than the Ottoman Empire, which signalled substantial economic and urban growth, as well as improving the peasant situation. Many of the provisions had been specified by the 1826 Akkerman Convention between Russia and the Ottomans, but it had never been fully implemented in the three-year interval. The duty of overseeing of the Principalities was left to Russian general Pavel Kiselyov; this period was marked by a series of major changes, including the reestablishment of a Wallachian Army (1831), a tax reform (which nonetheless confirmed tax exemptions for the privileged), as well as major urban works in Bucharest and other cities. In 1834, Wallachia's throne was occupied by Alexandru II Ghica\u2014a move in contradiction with the Adrianople treaty, as he had not been elected by the new Legislative Assembly; he was removed by the suzerains in 1842 and replaced with an elected prince, Gheorghe Bibescu.\n1840s\u20131850s.\nOpposition to Ghica's arbitrary and highly conservative rule, together with the rise of liberal and radical currents, was first felt with the protests voiced by Ion C\u00e2mpineanu (quickly repressed); subsequently, it became increasingly conspiratorial, and centered on those secret societies created by young officers such as Nicolae B\u0103lcescu and Mitic\u0103 Filipescu.\n\"Fr\u0103\u021bia\", a clandestine movement created in 1843, began planning a revolution to overthrow Bibescu and repeal \"Regulamentul Organic\" in 1848 (inspired by the European rebellions of the same year). Their pan-Wallachian \"coup d'\u00e9tat\" was initially successful only near Turnu M\u0103gurele, where crowds cheered the \"Islaz Proclamation\" (9 June); among others, the document called for political freedoms, independence, land reform, and the creation of a national guard. On 11\u201312 June the movement was successful in deposing Bibescu and establishing a Provisional Government, which made \"Dreptate, Fr\u0103\u021bie\" (\"Justice, Brotherhood\") the national motto. Although sympathetic to the anti-Russian goals of the revolution, the Ottomans were pressured by Russia into repressing it: Ottoman troops entered Bucharest on 13 September. Russian and Turkish troops, present until 1851, brought Barbu Dimitrie \u0218tirbei to the throne, during which interval most participants in the revolution were sent into exile.\nBriefly under renewed Russian occupation during the Crimean War, Wallachia and Moldavia were given a new status with a neutral Austrian administration (1854\u20131856) and the Treaty of Paris: a tutelage shared by Ottomans and a Congress of Great Powers (Britain, France, the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia, the Austrian Empire, Prussia, and, albeit never again fully, Russia), with a \"kaymakam\"-led internal administration. The emerging movement for a union of the Danubian Principalities (a demand first voiced in 1848, and a cause cemented by the return of revolutionary exiles) was advocated by the French and their Sardinian allies, supported by Russia and Prussia, but was rejected or suspicioned by all other overseers.\nAfter an intense campaign, a formal union was ultimately granted: nevertheless, elections for the \"Ad hoc Divans\" of 1859 profited from a legal ambiguity (the text of the final agreement specified two thrones, but did not prevent any single person from simultaneously taking part in and winning elections in both Bucharest and Ia\u0219i). Alexander John Cuza, who ran for the unionist \"Partida Na\u021bional\u0103\", won the elections in Moldavia on 5 January; Wallachia, which was expected by the unionists to carry the same vote, returned a majority of anti-unionists to its \"divan\".\nThose elected changed their allegiance after a mass protest of Bucharest crowds, and Cuza was voted prince of Wallachia on 5 February (24 January Old Style), consequently confirmed as \"Domnitor\" of the United Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia (\"of Romania\" from 1862) and effectively uniting both principalities. Internationally recognized only for the duration of his reign, the union was irreversible after the ascension of Carol I in 1866 (coinciding with the Austro-Prussian War, it came at a time when Austria, the main opponent of the decision, was not in a position to intervene).\nSociety.\nSlavery.\nSlavery () was part of the social order from before the founding of the Principality of Wallachia, until it was abolished in stages during the 1840s and 1850s. Most of the slaves were of Roma (Gypsy) ethnicity. The very first document attesting the presence of Roma people in Wallachia dates back to 1385, and refers to the group as \"a\u021bigani\" (from the Greek\" athinganoi\", the origin of the Romanian term \"\u021bigani\", which is synonymous with \"Gypsy\"). Although the Romanian terms \"robie\" and \"sclavie\" appear to be synonyms, in terms of legal status, there are significant differences: \"sclavie\" was the term corresponding to the legal institution during the Roman era, where slaves were considered goods instead of human beings and the owners had \"ius vitae necisque\" over them (right to end the life of the slave); while \"robie\" is the feudal institution where the slaves were legally considered human beings and they had reduced legal capacity.\nThe exact origins of slavery in Wallachia are not known. Slavery was a common practice in Eastern Europe at the time, and there is some debate over whether the Romani people came to Wallachia as free people or as slaves. In the Byzantine Empire, they were slaves of the state and it seems the situation was the same in Bulgaria and Serbia until their social organization was destroyed by the Ottoman conquest, which would suggest that they came as slaves who had a change of 'ownership'. Historian Nicolae Iorga associated the Roma people's arrival with the 1241 Mongol invasion of Europe and considered their slavery as a vestige of that era, the Romanians taking the Roma from the Mongols as slaves and preserving their status. Other historians consider that they were enslaved while captured during the battles with the Tatars. The practice of enslaving prisoners may also have been taken from the Mongols. While it is possible that some Romani people were slaves or auxiliary troops of the Mongols or Tatars, the bulk of them came from south of the Danube at the end of the 14th century, some time after the foundation of Wallachia. The arrival of the Roma made slavery a widespread practice.\nTraditionally, Roma slaves were divided into three categories. The smallest was owned by the \"hospodars\", and went by the Romanian-language name of \"\u021bigani domne\u0219ti\" (\"Gypsies belonging to the lord\"). The two other categories comprised \"\u021bigani m\u0103n\u0103stire\u0219ti\" (\"Gypsies belonging to the monasteries\"), who were the property of Romanian Orthodox and Greek Orthodox monasteries, and \"\u021bigani boiere\u0219ti\" (\"Gypsies belonging to the boyars\"), who were enslaved by the category of landowners.\nThe abolition of slavery was carried out following a campaign by young revolutionaries who embraced the liberal ideas of the Enlightenment. The earliest law which freed a category of slaves was in March 1843, which transferred the control of the state slaves owned by the prison authority to the local authorities, leading to their sedentarizing and becoming peasants. During the Wallachian Revolution of 1848, the agenda of the Provisional Government included the emancipation (\"dezrobire\") of the Roma as one of the main social demands. By the 1850s the movement gained support from almost the whole of Romanian society, and the law from February 1856 emancipated all slaves to the status of taxpayers (citizens).\nGeography.\nWith an area of approximately , Wallachia is situated north of the Danube (and of present-day Bulgaria), east of Serbia and south of the Southern Carpathians, and is traditionally divided between Muntenia in the east (as the political center, Muntenia is often understood as being synonymous with Wallachia), and Oltenia (a former banat) in the west. The division line between the two is the Olt River.\nWallachia's traditional border with Moldavia coincided with the Milcov River for most of its length. To the east, over the Danube north-south bend, Wallachia neighbours Dobruja (Northern Dobruja). Over the Carpathians, Wallachia shared a border with Transylvania; Wallachian princes have for long held possession of areas north of the line (Amla\u0219, Ciceu, F\u0103g\u0103ra\u0219, and Ha\u021beg), which are generally not considered part of Wallachia proper.\nThe capital city changed over time, from C\u00e2mpulung to Curtea de Arge\u0219, then to T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te and, after the late 17th century, to Bucharest.\nPopulation.\nHistorical population.\nContemporary historians estimate the population of Wallachia in the 15th century at 500,000 people. In 1859, the population of Wallachia was 2,400,921 (1,586,596 in Muntenia and 814,325 in Oltenia).\nCurrent population.\nAccording to the latest 2011 census data, the region has a total population of 8,256,532 inhabitants, distributed among the ethnic groups as follows (as per 2001 census): Romanians (97%), Roma (2.5%), others (0.5%).\nCities.\nThe largest cities (as per the 2011 census) in the Wallachia region are:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

He made major contributions to the foundations of mathematics, proof theory, especially on natural deduction and sequent calculus. He died of starvation in a Czech prison camp in Prague in 1945.\nLife and career.\nGentzen was a student of Paul Bernays at the University of G\u00f6ttingen. Bernays was fired as \"non-Aryan\" in April 1933 and therefore Hermann Weyl formally acted as his supervisor. Gentzen joined the Sturmabteilung in November 1933, although he was by no means compelled to do so. Nevertheless, he kept in contact with Bernays until the beginning of the Second World War. In 1935, he corresponded with Abraham Fraenkel in Jerusalem and was implicated by the Nazi teachers' union as one who \"keeps contacts to the Chosen People.\" In 1935 and 1936, Hermann Weyl, head of the G\u00f6ttingen mathematics department in 1933 until his resignation under Nazi pressure, made strong efforts to bring him to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton.\nBetween November 1935 and 1939 he was an assistant of David Hilbert in G\u00f6ttingen. Gentzen joined the Nazi Party in 1937. In April 1939, Gentzen swore the oath of loyalty to Adolf Hitler as part of his academic appointment. From 1943 he was a teacher at the German Charles-Ferdinand University of Prague. Under a contract from the SS, Gentzen worked for the V-2 project.\nGentzen was arrested during the citizens uprising against the occupying German forces on 5 May 1945. He, along with the rest of the staff of the German University in Prague, were detained in a Soviet prison camp, where he died of starvation on 4 August 1945. He is probably buried in an unmarked grave at the \u010e\u00e1blice Cemetery in Prague.\nWork.\nGentzen's main work was on the foundations of mathematics, in proof theory, specifically natural deduction and the sequent calculus. His cut-elimination theorem is the cornerstone of proof-theoretic semantics, and some philosophical remarks in his \"Investigations into Logical Deduction\", together with Ludwig Wittgenstein's later work, constitute the starting point for inferential role semantics.\nOne of Gentzen's papers had a second publication in the ideological \"Deutsche Mathematik\" that was founded by Ludwig Bieberbach who promoted \"Aryan\" mathematics.\nGentzen proved the consistency of the Peano axioms in a paper published in 1936. In his \"Habilitationsschrift\", finished in 1939, he determined the proof-theoretical strength of Peano arithmetic. This was done by a direct proof of the unprovability of the principle of transfinite induction, used in his 1936 proof of consistency, within Peano arithmetic. The principle can, however, be expressed in arithmetic, so that a direct proof of G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem followed. G\u00f6del used a coding procedure to construct an unprovable formula of arithmetic. Gentzen's proof was published in 1943 and marked the beginning of ordinal proof theory.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is often associated with insight, discernment, and ethics in decision-making. Throughout history, wisdom has been regarded as a key virtue in philosophy, religion, and psychology, representing the ability to understand and respond to reality in a balanced and thoughtful manner. Unlike intelligence, which primarily concerns problem-solving and reasoning, wisdom involves a deeper comprehension of human nature, moral principles, and the long-term consequences of actions.\nPhilosophically, wisdom has been explored by thinkers from Ancient Greece to modern times. Socrates famously equated wisdom with recognizing one's own ignorance, while Aristotle saw it as practical reasoning (\"phronesis\") and deep contemplation (\"sophia\"). Eastern traditions, such as Confucianism and Buddhism, emphasize wisdom as a form of enlightened understanding that leads to ethical living and inner peace. Across cultures, wisdom is often linked to virtues like humility, patience, and compassion, suggesting that it is not just about knowing what is right but also acting upon it.\nPsychologists study wisdom as a cognitive and emotional trait, often linking it to maturity, emotional regulation, and the ability to consider multiple perspectives. Research suggests that wisdom is associated with qualities such as open-mindedness, empathy, and the ability to manage uncertainty. Some psychological models, such as the Berlin Wisdom Paradigm and Robert Sternberg's Balance Theory, attempt to define and measure wisdom through various cognitive and social factors. Neuroscience studies also explore how brain structures related to emotional processing and long-term thinking contribute to wise decision-making.\nWisdom continues to be a subject of interest in modern society, influencing fields as diverse as leadership, education, and personal development. While technology provides greater access to information, it does not necessarily lead to wisdom, which requires careful reflection and ethical consideration. As artificial intelligence and data-driven decision-making play a growing role in shaping human life, discussions on wisdom remain relevant, emphasizing the importance of judgment, ethical responsibility, and long-term planning.\nEtymology and overview.\nEtymology.\nThe English word wisdom originates from the Old English w\u012bsd\u014dm, which is derived from w\u012bs (\"wise\") and d\u014dm (\"judgment, decision, law\"). The Proto-Germanic root wis- (\"to see, to know\") connects wisdom to perception and insight. Related terms appear in Old High German (w\u012bssag, \"prophetic\"), Old Norse (v\u00edsd\u00f3mr), and Gothic (weisdumbs).\nIn Ancient Greek, wisdom is expressed as \u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03b1 (\"sophia\"), often referring to both practical skill and philosophical insight. The term was central to Greek philosophy, particularly in Plato's and Aristotle's discussions on virtue. The Latin equivalent, \"sapientia\", derives from \"sapere\" (\"to taste, to discern\"), emphasizing wisdom as discerning between right and wrong.\nSimilar concepts exist in non-Indo-European languages:\nHistorical overview.\nWisdom has been a central concept in philosophy, religion, and literature across ancient civilizations.\nThe earliest wisdom literature comes from Sumerian and Egyptian texts. In Sumerian tradition, wisdom (\"me\") was considered a divine principle given by the gods, recorded in proverbs and myths. Egyptian wisdom texts, such as the Maxims of Ptahhotep (c. 2400 BCE), emphasized moral conduct and social harmony.\nWisdom became a major theme in Greek philosophy. Socrates equated wisdom with knowing one's own ignorance, while Plato argued that wisdom was the highest form of knowledge. Aristotle distinguished between practical wisdom (\"phronesis\") and theoretical wisdom (\"sophia\"), defining wisdom as the ability to deliberate well about the good life.\nIn Roman philosophy, wisdom (\"sapientia\") was regarded as the virtue of the Stoic sage. Cicero and Seneca viewed wisdom as self-discipline and rational living, essential for achieving inner tranquility (\"ataraxia\").\nWisdom also developed as a spiritual concept in various traditions:\nPhilosophical perspectives.\nPhilosophers have explored wisdom as a fundamental concept for millennia, debating its nature, acquisition, and role in ethical and intellectual life. Some traditions emphasize wisdom as practical decision-making, while others frame it as deep contemplation or spiritual insight. Broadly, wisdom has been categorized into theoretical wisdom (\"sophia\"), practical wisdom (\"phronesis\"), and moral wisdom, with varying interpretations across different philosophical traditions.\nWestern philosophy.\nAncient Greek philosophy.\nWisdom (\"sophia\", \u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03b1) played a central role in Ancient Greek philosophy and was often distinguished from mere knowledge (\"episteme\", \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03bc\u03b7).\nSocrates.\nAccording to Plato and Xenophon, the Pythia of the Delphic Oracle answered the question \"who is the wisest man in Greece?\" by stating Socrates was the wisest. According to Plato's \"Apology\", Socrates (469\u2013399 BCE) decided to investigate the people who might be considered wiser than him, concluding they lacked true knowledge. He argued that true wisdom involves questioning and refining beliefs rather than assuming certainty:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Verse translation/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Screen reader-only/styles.css\" /&gt;Translation:\nThis became immortalized in the phrase \"I know that I know nothing\", an aphorism suggesting that it is wise to recognize one's own ignorance and to value epistemic humility.\nPlato and Aristotle.\nTo Socrates and his student Plato (c. 427\u2013347 BCE), philosophy was literally the love of wisdom (). This permeates Plato's dialogues; in \"The Republic\" the leaders of his proposed utopia are philosopher kings who, through education and contemplation, attain a deep understanding of justice and the Forms, and possess the courage to act accordingly.\nAristotle (384\u2013322 BCE), in \"Metaphysics\", defined wisdom as understanding why things are a certain way (causality), which is deeper than merely knowing things are a certain way. He was the first to differentiate between two types of wisdom:\nAristotle saw \"phronesis\" as essential for ethical living, arguing that virtuous actions require both knowledge and experience. This concept of practical wisdom later influenced virtue ethics and modern discussions of decision-making.\nMedieval and Renaissance thought.\nIn the Medieval period, wisdom was often linked to divine revelation and theology. Augustine of Hippo (354\u2013430 CE) viewed wisdom as knowledge aligned with God's eternal truth, distinguishing it from mere worldly intelligence. He argued that true wisdom (\"sapientia\") comes from knowing and loving God, contrasting it with human knowledge (\"scientia\"), which concerns temporal matters.\nThomas Aquinas built upon Aristotle's distinction between theoretical and practical wisdom, incorporating it into Christian theology. He argued that wisdom (\"sapientia\") is the highest intellectual virtue, guiding reason toward ultimate truth and divine understanding. Aquinas distinguished between natural wisdom, which humans acquire through reason, and supernatural wisdom, which comes through divine revelation.\nDuring the Renaissance, humanist thinkers such as Erasmus and Montaigne emphasized the role of self-reflection and skepticism in wisdom, challenging dogmatic reliance on authority. Montaigne, in his \"Essays\", proposed that true wisdom lies in acknowledging uncertainty and maintaining intellectual humility. The Renaissance emphasis on human reason and critical inquiry laid the groundwork for early modern philosophical discussions of wisdom.\nModern and contemporary philosophy.\nIn the Age of Enlightenment, the concept of wisdom shifted from religious and metaphysical frameworks to one rooted in rationality and moral duty. Immanuel Kant argued that wisdom involves the application of practical reason to align one's actions with universal moral principles. He distinguished between theoretical reason, which seeks knowledge for its own sake, and practical reason, which applies knowledge ethically. Kantian wisdom involves making decisions that conform to the categorical imperative, a moral law derived from reason.\nDuring the 19th century, romanticism and existentialism challenged the rationalist foundations of wisdom. Friedrich Nietzsche criticized traditional views of wisdom as passive contemplation and obedience to moral codes. Instead, he championed \"life-affirming wisdom\", emphasizing personal growth through struggle and self-overcoming. Nietzsche rejected the pursuit of static truths, instead advocating for a dynamic and self-created form of wisdom.\nExistentialist philosophers further expanded this critique. Jean-Paul Sartre viewed wisdom as a confrontation with the absurd condition of life and the freedom to create meaning in a world devoid of inherent purpose. Albert Camus echoed these ideas in \"The Myth of Sisyphus\", arguing that wisdom lies in accepting life's absurdity and choosing to live meaningfully despite its challenges.\nIn the 20th century, pragmatist philosophers like John Dewey argued for a form of wisdom based on adaptability and practical decision-making. Dewey rejected fixed moral absolutes in favor of wisdom as a constantly evolving process of inquiry and experimentation. Pragmatic wisdom, according to Dewey, emerges from ongoing reflection on experience and the ability to adapt principles to changing contexts. Following Dewey's lead, Robert L. Holmes argued that wisdom in the modern nuclear era calls for individuals to transcend the dogmatic use of fixed philosophical principles such as \"just wars\" and \"unjust wars\" by resolving military conflict through the use of \"pragmatic pacifism\" instead.\nMeanwhile, virtue ethicists such as Martha Nussbaum argue that wisdom is tied to emotional intelligence and empathy. In her works on Aristotelian ethics, Nussbaum writes that wise individuals understand the complexities of human emotions and integrate them into moral reasoning. Similarly, Richard Clyde Taylor argued that wisdom is characterized by compassionate understanding when accompanied by the realization that, \"there simply is no such thing as philosophical knowledge, nor any philosophical way of knowing anything.\" This perspective sees wisdom not merely as intellectual discernment but as the capacity to recognize the emotional and contextual dimensions of moral life. \nPostmodern philosophers challenge the notion of wisdom as a universal concept. Michel Foucault argued that ideas of wisdom are shaped by power structures and are inherently subjective, often serving to reinforce dominant ideologies. Postmodern perspectives emphasize cultural relativism and the diversity of wisdom across historical and social contexts rather than a singular definition.\nToday, contemporary discussions of wisdom draw from cognitive science and social philosophy. Philosophers like Philip Kitcher focus on practical wisdom as collaborative decision-making in democratic societies. This view holds that wisdom is not an individual trait but a collective process involving diverse perspectives. As such, modern philosophy views wisdom as dynamic, context-dependent, and shaped by emotional, social, and cognitive factors.\nEastern philosophy.\nIn Confucian thought.\nIn Confucian thought, wisdom (\"zhi\", \u667a) is closely linked to ethical living and social harmony. Confucius (551\u2013479 BCE) taught that wisdom is not merely intelligence but the ability to act virtuously in relationships and governance. It involves self-cultivation, learning from the past, and practicing benevolence (\"ren\", \u4ec1), which Confucius regarded as a foundational virtue.\nWisdom in Confucianism is practical and moral, requiring individuals to cultivate righteousness (\"yi\", \u7fa9) and ritual propriety (\"li\", \u79ae) in order to contribute to a stable society. The ideal wise person, or \"superior person\" (\"junzi\", \u541b\u5b50), embodies wisdom by continuously refining their character and aligning their actions with ethical principles.\nLater Confucian thinkers expanded on this concept. Mencius (372\u2013289 BCE) emphasized compassion and moral intuition as sources of wisdom, arguing that humans are naturally inclined toward goodness but must develop wisdom through education and reflection. Xunzi (c. 310\u2013235 BCE), by contrast, saw wisdom as the product of strict discipline and adherence to ritual, believing that human nature is inherently flawed and must be shaped through deliberate effort.\nThe Confucian approach to wisdom remains influential in East Asian ethics, education, and leadership philosophy, continuing to shape modern discussions on morality and governance.\nIn Buddhist philosophy.\nIn Buddhist philosophy, wisdom (\"praj\u00f1\u0101\", \u092a\u094d\u0930\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e) is one of the threefold training principles (along with ethics and meditation). It involves seeing reality as it truly is, free from delusions. In Mahayana Buddhism, wisdom is often personified by the Bodhisattva Manjushri, who wields a sword to cut through ignorance. Zen traditions emphasize \"satori\" (\u609f\u308a), a sudden flash of wisdom or enlightenment. In Therav\u0101da Buddhism, wisdom is developed through vipassan\u0101 (insight meditation), leading to the realization of impermanence (\"anicca\"), suffering (\"du\u1e25kha\"), and non-self (\"anatt\u0101\"). Buddhist religious traditions provide comprehensive guidance on how to develop wisdom.\nThe term was translated into Chinese as\n (pinyin , characters \u667a \"knowledge\" and \u6167 \"bright, intelligent\"). In Chinese Buddhism, the idea of wisdom is closely linked to its Indian equivalent as it appears for instance in certain conceptual continuities that exist between Asanga, Vasubandhu and Xuanzang.\nDeveloping wisdom is of central importance in Buddhist traditions, where the ultimate aim is often presented as \"seeing things as they are\" or as gaining a \"penetrative understanding of all phenomena\", which in turn is described as ultimately leading to the \"complete freedom from suffering\". In Buddhism, developing wisdom is accomplished through an understanding of what are known as the Four Noble Truths and by following the Noble Eightfold Path. This path lists mindfulness as one of eight required components for cultivating wisdom.\nBuddhist scriptures teach that wise people conduct themselves well. A wise person does actions that are unpleasant to do but give good results, and does not do actions that are pleasant to do but give bad results. Wisdom is the antidote to the poison of ignorance. The Buddha has much to say on the subject of wisdom including:\nTo recover the original supreme wisdom of self-nature (Buddha-nature or Tathagata) concealed by the self-imposed three dusty poisons (the kleshas: greed, anger, ignorance), Buddha taught to his students the threefold training by turning greed into generosity and discipline, anger into kindness and meditation, ignorance into wisdom.\nIn Hindu philosophy.\nIn Hindu philosophy, wisdom (\"j\u00f1\u0101na\", \u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0928) is closely associated with self-realization and spiritual knowledge. Unlike the empirical knowledge (\"vidy\u0101\", \u0935\u093f\u0926\u094d\u092f\u093e) gained through sensory experience, wisdom in Hinduism involves insight into the ultimate nature of reality (\"Brahman\", \u092c\u094d\u0930\u0939\u094d\u092e\u0928\u094d) and the self (\"\u0100tman\", \u0906\u0924\u094d\u092e\u0928\u094d). The Upanishads, foundational texts of Hindu thought, describe wisdom as the realization that all worldly distinctions are illusions (\"maya\", \u092e\u093e\u092f\u093e), and that the self is one with the infinite consciousness of Brahman.\nWithin Vedanta philosophy, wisdom is considered the path to liberation (\"mok\u1e63a\", \u092e\u094b\u0915\u094d\u0937). Adi Shankaracharya (c. 8th century CE) argued that true wisdom (\"jnana yoga\") arises through discrimination (\"viveka\", \u0935\u093f\u0935\u0947\u0915) between the real and the unreal. He taught that ignorance (\"avidy\u0101\", \u0905\u0935\u093f\u0926\u094d\u092f\u093e) binds individuals to the cycle of samsara (rebirth), and wisdom is the means to overcome illusion and attain self-realization. In contrast, Dvaita Vedanta, founded by Madhvacharya (13th century CE), holds that wisdom involves recognizing the eternal distinction between the self and God, rather than dissolving all distinctions.\nWisdom is also a core element in Hindu sacred texts, including the \"Bhagavad Gita\", where Krishna teaches Arjuna that true wisdom transcends personal desires and emotions. The Gita outlines three paths to wisdom:\nHindu wisdom traditions remain deeply influential in both spiritual practice and philosophical inquiry, with modern thinkers like Swami Vivekananda and Aurobindo Ghose integrating ancient wisdom concepts with contemporary thought. \"Medha\" is a goddess of wisdom found in the \"Garuda Purana\".\nIn Taoist philosophy.\nTaoist views of wisdom (\"wu wei\", \u7121\u70ba) emphasizes effortless action, aligning with the natural flow of the universe (\"Tao\"). While early Confucianism values social harmony and structured virtue, Taoist wisdom often embraces paradox and non-conformity. The \"Zhuangzi\" text, attributed to Zhuang Zhou (c. 4th century BCE), presents wisdom as a state of effortless flow (\"wu wei\"), where one aligns with the spontaneous patterns of nature rather than imposing human will. This contrasts with Confucian ideals of ritual and duty, as Taoist wisdom values freedom from rigid thinking and acceptance of change.\nTaoist wisdom also includes cosmological insight, recognizing that all things emerge from the \"Tao\" (\u9053), the fundamental force of existence. In \"Tao Te Ching\" (\u9053\u5fb7\u7d93), attributed to Laozi (6th century BCE), wisdom is described as yielding like water, able to overcome obstacles through gentleness rather than force. This perspective aligns with Taoist ethics, which discourage aggression and rigid control, instead promoting a harmonious existence in sync with nature's rhythms. He also describes wisdom as understanding the balance of opposites (Yin and Yang) and acting in harmony with nature rather than imposing force.\nUnlike Western views, Taoist wisdom often involves paradox and non-action, valuing spontaneity over rigid rules. Taoist sages are often depicted as detached from worldly concerns, seeking a deeper, wordless understanding of existence that transcends conventional logic.\nPsychological perspectives.\nThe three major psychological categories for wisdom are \"personality\", \"development\", and \"expertise\".\nPsychologists have begun to gather data on commonly held beliefs or folk theories about wisdom. Initial analyses indicate that although \"there is an overlap of the implicit theory of wisdom with intelligence, perceptiveness, spirituality, and shrewdness, it is evident that wisdom is an expertise in dealing with difficult questions of life and adaptation to the complex requirements.\"\nThe field of psychology has also developed explicit theories and empirical research on the psychological processes underlying wisdom. Opinions on the psychological definition of wisdom vary, but there is some consensus that critical to wisdom are certain meta-cognitive processes that afford life reflection and judgment about critical life matters. These processes include recognizing the limits of one's own knowledge, acknowledging uncertainty and change, attention to context and the bigger picture, and integrating different perspectives of a situation. Cognitive scientists suggest that wisdom requires coordinating such reasoning processes for insight into managing one's life. Reasoning of this sort is both theoretically and empirically distinct from general (fluid or crystallized) intelligence. Researchers have shown empirically that wise reasoning is distinct from IQ.\nBaltes and colleagues defined wisdom as \"the ability to deal with the contradictions of a specific situation and to assess the consequences of an action for themselves and for others. It is achieved when in a concrete situation, a balance between intrapersonal, interpersonal and institutional interests can be prepared\". Balance appears to be a critical criterion of wisdom. Empirical research provides some support for this idea, showing that wisdom-related reasoning is associated with achieving balance between intrapersonal and interpersonal interests when facing personal life challenges, and when setting goals for managing interpersonal conflicts.\nResearchers also explore the role of emotions in wisdom. Most agree that emotions and emotion regulation are key to effectively managing the kinds of complex and arousing situations that most call for wisdom. Much empirical research has focused on the cognitive or meta-cognitive aspects of wisdom, assuming that an ability to reason through difficult situations is paramount. So although emotions likely play a role in how wisdom plays out in real events (and in reflecting on past events), empirical studies were late to develop on how emotions affect a person's ability to deal wisely with complex events. One study found a positive relationship between diversity of emotional experience and wise reasoning, irrespective of emotional intensity.\nGestalt therapy.\nA \"wise-person fantasy\" is an awareness intervention, where one poses a question, thinks on it for a few minutes, and then role-plays a fantasized wise person to answer that same question.\nGrossmann.\nGrossmann and colleagues summarized prior psychological literature to conclude that wisdom involves certain cognitive processes that afford unbiased, sound judgment in the face of ill-defined life situations:\nGrossmann found that habitually speaking and thinking of oneself in the third person increases these characteristics, which means that such a habit makes a person wiser. Grossmann says contextual factors\u00a0\u2013 such as culture, experiences, and social situations\u00a0\u2013 influence the understanding, development, and propensity of wisdom, with implications for training and educational practice. These contextual factors are the focus of continuing research. For instance, Grossmann and Kross identified a phenomenon they called \"the Solomon's paradox\": that people reflect more wisely on other people's problems than on their own. (It is named after King Solomon, who had legendary sagacity when making judgments about other people's dilemmas but lacked insight when it came to important decisions in his own life.)\nMeasuring wisdom.\nA researcher will measure wisdom differently depending on their theoretical position about the nature of wisdom. For example, some view wisdom as a stable personality trait, others as a context-bound process. Those wedded to the former approach often use single-shot questionnaires, which are prone to responses, something that is antithetical to the wisdom construct and fails to study wisdom in the contexts where it is most relevant: complex life challenges. In contrast, researchers who prefer the latter approach measure wisdom-related features of cognition, motivation, and emotion in the context of a specific situation. Such state-level measures provide less-biased responses as well as greater power in explaining meaningful psychological processes. Also, a focus on the situation allows wisdom researchers to develop a fuller understanding of the role of context in producing wisdom. For example, studies have shown evidence of cross-cultural and within-cultural variability, and systematic variability in reasoning wisely across contexts and in daily life.\nMany, but not all, studies find that adults' self-ratings of perspective and wisdom do not depend on age. This conflicts with the popular notion that wisdom increases with age. The answer to whether age and wisdom correlate depends on how one defines wisdom and one's experimental technique. The answer to this question also depends on the domain studied, and the role of experience in that domain, with some contexts favoring older adults, others favoring younger adults, and some not differentiating age groups. Rigorous longitudinal work is needed to answer this question, while most studies rely on cross-sectional observations.\nThe Jeste-Thomas Wisdom Index is based on a survey (SD-WISE-28) created by researchers at the University of California San Diego to determine how wise a person is. In 2021 Dilip V. Jeste and his colleagues created a survey (SD-WISE-7) testing seven components: acceptance of diverse perspectives, decisiveness, emotional regulation, prosocial behaviors, self-reflection, social advising, and (to a lesser degree) spirituality.\nArchetypal psychology.\nThe wise old person is an unconscious attitude concerning nature and the collective unconscious.\nStar Wars is a monomyth that uses archetypal psychology, specifically Joseph Campbell's The Hero of a Thousand Faces. The character Master Yoda from the films evokes the trope of the wise old man, and he is frequently quoted, analogously to Chinese thinkers or Eastern sages in general.\nReligious perspectives.\nZoroastrianism.\nIn the Avesta Gathas, hymns traditionally attributed to Zoroaster, Ahura Mazda means \"Lord\" (Ahura) and \"Wisdom\" (Mazda), and is the central deity who embodies goodness, being also called \"Good Thought\" (Vohu Manah). In Zoroastrianism, the order of the universe and morals is called (in Avestan, truth, righteousness), which is determined by this omniscient Thought and also considered a deity emanating from Ahura (Amesha Spenta). It is related to another ahura deity, Spenta Mainyu (active Mentality). It says in Yazna 31:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;To him shall the best befall, who, as one that knows, speaks to me Right's truthful word of Welfare and of Immortality; even the Dominion of Mazda which Good Thought shall increase for him. About which he in the beginning thus thought, \"let the blessed realms be filled with Light\", he it is that by his wisdom created Right.\nHellenistic religion and Gnosticism.\nIn Hellenistic religion, wisdom was often personified as a divine or mystical force guiding human understanding. In Greek mystery religions, particularly Orphism and the Eleusinian Mysteries, wisdom was associated with spiritual enlightenment and initiation into hidden truths. Philosophical movements such as Neoplatonism developed a concept of wisdom (\"sophia\", \u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03b1) as the knowledge of the divine order of existence. Plotinus (204\u2013270 CE) viewed wisdom as an ascent of the soul towards the One, the ultimate source of all reality. In this tradition, wisdom was both intellectual and mystical, requiring inner purification to grasp transcendent truths.\nWisdom also played a central role in Gnosticism, an esoteric movement that emerged in the first few centuries CE. Gnostics saw wisdom (Sophia) as a divine figure, often depicted as a fallen being who sought to restore humanity's knowledge of its divine origin. In texts in the Nag Hammadi library, Sophia is described as the mother of all living and the source of \"gnosis\" (spiritual knowledge). According to Valentinian Gnosticism, Sophia's fall led to the creation of the material world, but through wisdom, the soul could transcend illusion and return to the divine realm.\nGnostic texts such as the \"Pistis Sophia\" depict wisdom as a cosmic force struggling to free itself from ignorance and darkness. This contrasts with orthodox Christian views, where wisdom (\u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03b1) is associated with the Logos and divine order rather than cosmic dualism. In Hermeticism, another esoteric tradition of the Hellenistic period, wisdom was linked to inner enlightenment and mystical union with the divine mind (\"nous\", \u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2). These traditions, though diverse, shared the belief that wisdom was the key to transcending material existence and reuniting with the divine.\nAbrahamic religions.\nThe word \"wisdom\" () is mentioned 222 times in the Hebrew Bible. It was regarded as one of the highest virtues among the Israelites along with kindness () and justice (). Wisdom is exemplified by Solomon. Much of the Book of Proverbs, which is filled with wise sayings, is attributed to Solomon. The Talmud teaches that a wise person can foresee the future. is a Hebrew word for \"future,\" but also the Hebrew word for \"birth\", so one rabbinic interpretation of the teaching is that a wise person is one who can foresee the consequences of his/her choices (i.e. can \"see the future\" that he/she \"gives birth\" to).\nIn Christian theology, \"wisdom\" describes an aspect of God, or the theological concept regarding the wisdom of God. Wisdom is considered one of the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit. Justin Martyr, Athenagoras of Athens and Theophilus of Antioch identified the Wisdom of the Book of Proverbs with the Word who is Jesus Christ God.\nThe Islamic term for wisdom is . Prophets of Islam are believed by Muslims to possess great wisdom. The Sufi philosopher Ibn Arabi considers \"al-Hakim\" (\"The Wise\") as one of the names of the Creator. Wisdom and truth, considered divine attributes, were valued in Islamic sciences and philosophy. The first Arab philosopher, Al-Kindi says at the beginning of his book:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We must not be ashamed to admire the truth or to acquire it, from wherever it comes. Even if it should come from far-flung nations and foreign peoples, there is for the student of truth nothing more important than the truth, nor is the truth demeaned or diminished by the one who states or conveys it; no one is demeaned by the truth, rather all are ennobled by it.\u2014\u200a\nIn Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith scripture, \"The essence of wisdom is the fear of God, the dread of His scourge and punishment, and the apprehension of His justice and decree.\" Wisdom is seen as a light that casts away darkness, and \"its dictates must be observed under all circumstances\". One may obtain knowledge and wisdom through God, his Word, and his Divine Manifestation; the source of all learning is the knowledge of God.\nCultural and literary depictions.\nIn mythology.\nMesopotamian mythology.\nIn Mesopotamian religion and mythology, Enki, also known as Ea, was the god of wisdom and intelligence. Divine wisdom allowed and the ordering of the cosmos, and it was achieved by humans by following s (in Sumerian: order, rite, righteousness) which maintain balance. In addition to hymns to Enki or Ea dating from \u00a0BCE, there is among the clay tablets of Abu Salabikh from \u00a0BCE (the oldest dated texts), a \"Hymn to Shamash\" which includes the following:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Wide is the courtyard of Shamash night chamber, (just as wide is the womb of) a wise pregnant woman! Sin, his warrior, wise one, heard of the offerings and came down to his fiesta. He is the father of the nation and the father of intelligence\nEgyptian mythology.\nSia was the personification of perception and thoughtfulness in the mythology of Ancient Egypt. Thoth, married to Maat (in ancient Egyptian: order, righteousness, truth), was regarded as the being who introduced wisdom to the nation.\nThe concept of Logos\u00a0\u2013 manifest word of the divine thought\u00a0\u2013 was also present in the philosophy and hymns of Egypt and Ancient Greece. It was important in the thinking of Heraclitus, and in the Abrahamic traditions. It seems to have been derived from Mesopotamian culture.\nGreek mythology.\nAthena and Metis.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Athena (as Mentor) supported him by recognizing and fostering courage, hope, sense, bravery, and adeptness (Homer, trans. 1996, p. 102).\nThe ancient Greeks considered wisdom to be an important virtue, personified as the goddesses Metis and Athena. Metis was the first wife of Zeus, who, according to Hesiod's Theogony, had devoured her pregnant; Zeus earned the title of M\u00eatieta (\"The Wise Counselor\") after that, as Metis was the embodiment of wisdom, and he gave birth to Athena, who is said to have sprung from his head. Athena was portrayed as strong, fair, merciful, and chaste.\nApollo.\nApollo was also considered a god of wisdom, designated as the conductor of the Muses (\"Musagetes\"), who were personifications of the sciences and of the inspired and poetic arts. According to Plato in his \"Cratylus\", the name of Apollo could also mean \" (archer) and \" (unifier of poles [divine and earthly]), since this god was responsible for divine and true inspirations, thus considered an archer who was always right in healing and oracles: \"he is an ever-darting archer\". Apollo prophesied through the priestesses (Pythia) in the Temple of Apollo (Delphi), where the aphorism \"know thyself\" () was inscribed (one of the Delphic maxims). He was contrasted with Hermes, who was related to the sciences and technical wisdom, and, in the first centuries after Christ, was associated with Thoth in an Egyptian syncretism, under the name Hermes Trimegistus. Greek tradition recorded the earliest introducers of wisdom in the Seven Sages of Greece.\nRoman mythology.\nThe ancient Romans also valued wisdom, which was personified as Minerva or Pallas. She also represents skillful knowledge and the virtues, especially chastity. Her symbol was the owl, which is still a popular representation of wisdom, because it can see in darkness. She was said to have been born from Jupiter's forehead.\nNorse mythology.\nOdin is known for his wisdom, often as acquired through various hardships and ordeals involving pain and self-sacrifice. In one instance he plucked out an eye and offered it to M\u00edmir, guardian of the well of knowledge and wisdom, in return for a drink from the well.\nIn another famous account, Odin hanged himself for nine nights from Yggdrasil, the World Tree that unites all the realms of existence, suffering from hunger and thirst and finally wounding himself with a spear until he gained the knowledge of runes for use in casting powerful magic. He was also able to acquire the mead of poetry from the giants, a drink of which could grant the power of a scholar or poet, for the benefit of gods and mortals alike.\nIn folklore.\nIn many cultures, the name for third molars, which are the last teeth to grow, is etymologically linked with wisdom, as in the English \"wisdom tooth\". This nickname originated from the classical tradition\u00a0\u2013 the Hippocratic writings used the term (in Greek, related to the meaning of moderation or teaching a lesson), and in Latin (wisdom tooth).\nEducational perspectives.\nPublic schools in the U.S. sometimes nod at \"character education\" which would include training in wisdom.\nMaxwell's educational philosophy.\nNicholas Maxwell, a philosopher in the United Kingdom, believes academia ought to alter its focus from the acquisition of knowledge to seeking and promoting wisdom. This he defines as the capacity to realize what is of value in life, for oneself and others. He teaches that new knowledge and technological know-how increase our power to act. Without wisdom though, Maxwell claims this new knowledge may cause human harm as well as human good. He argues that the pursuit of knowledge is indeed valuable and good, but that it should be considered a part of the broader task of improving wisdom.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "46034", "revid": "45364314", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46034", "title": "Alfred Bester", "text": "American science fiction author (1913\u20131987)\nAlfred Bester (December 18, 1913\u00a0\u2013 September 30, 1987) was an American science fiction author; TV and radio screenwriter; magazine editor; and scriptwriter for comics. He is best remembered for his science fiction, including the novel \"The Demolished Man\", winner of the inaugural Hugo Award in 1953.\nScience fiction author Harry Harrison wrote that \"Alfred Bester was one of the handful of writers who invented modern science fiction\".\nShortly before his death, the Science Fiction Writers of America (SFWA) named Bester its ninth Grand Master; the award was presented posthumously in 1988.\nThe Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame inducted him in 2001.\nLife and career.\nAlfred Bester was born in Middletown, New York, on December 18, 1913. His father, James J. Bester, owned a shoe store and was a first-generation American whose parents were both Austrian Jews. Alfred's mother, Belle (n\u00e9e Silverman), was born in Russia and spoke Yiddish as her first language before coming to America as a youth. Alfred was James and Belle's second and final child, and only son. (Their first child, Rita, was born in 1908.) Though his mother was born Jewish, she became a Christian Scientist, and Alfred himself was not raised within any religious traditions; he wrote that \"his home life was completely liberal and iconoclastic.\"\nBester attended the University of Pennsylvania, where he was a member of the Philomathean Society. He played on the Penn Quakers football team in 1935 and, by his own account, was \"the most successful member of the fencing team.\" He went on to Columbia Law School, but tired of it and dropped out.\nBester and Rolly Goulko married in 1936. Rolly Bester was a Broadway, radio and television actress, the first to play the role of Lois Lane, which she did on the radio program \"The Adventures of Superman\". She changed careers in the 1960s, becoming a vice president, casting director and supervisor at the advertising agency Ted Bates &amp; Co. in New York City. The Besters remained married for 48 years until her death. Bester was very nearly a lifelong New Yorker, although he lived in Europe for a little over a year in the mid-1950s and moved to exurban Pennsylvania with Rolly in the early 1980s. Once settled there, they lived on Geigel Hill Road in Ottsville, Pennsylvania.\nWriting career.\nEarly SF career, comic books, radio (1939\u20131950).\nAfter his university career, 25-year-old Alfred Bester was working in public relations when he turned to writing science fiction. Bester's first published short story was \"The Broken Axiom\", which appeared in the April 1939 issue of \"Thrilling Wonder Stories\" after winning an amateur story competition. Bester recalled, \"Two editors on the staff, Mort Weisinger and Jack Schiff, took an interest in me, I suspect mostly because I'd just finished reading and annotating Joyce's \"Ulysses\" and would preach it enthusiastically without provocation, to their great amusement. ... They thought \"Diaz-X\" [Bester's original title] might fill the bill if it was whipped into shape.\" This was the very same contest that Robert A. Heinlein famously chose not to enter, as the prize was only $50 and Heinlein realized he could do better selling \"his\" 7,000-word unpublished story to \"Astounding Science Fiction\" for a penny a word, or $70. Years later, Bester interviewed Heinlein for \"Publishers Weekly\" and the latter told of changing his mind for \"Astounding\". Bester says that he replied (in jest), \"You sonofabitch. I won that \"Thrilling Wonder\" contest, and you beat me by twenty dollars.\"\nHowever, as Bester was the winner of the contest, Mort Weisinger also \"introduced me to the informal luncheon gatherings of the working science fiction authors of the late thirties.\" He met Henry Kuttner, Edmond Hamilton, Otto Binder, Malcolm Jameson and Manly Wade Wellman there. During 1939 and 1940 Weisinger published three more of Bester's stories in \"Thrilling Wonder Stories\" and \"Startling Stories\". For the next few years, Bester continued to publish short fiction, most notably in John W. Campbell's \"Astounding Science Fiction\".\nIn 1942, two of his science fiction editors got work at DC Comics, and invited Bester to contribute to various DC titles. Consequently, Bester left the field of short story writing and began working for DC Comics as a writer, including, and, under the editorship of Julius Schwartz, \"Green Lantern\", among other titles. He created super-villain Solomon Grundy and the version of the Green Lantern Oath that begins \"In brightest day, In blackest night\". Bester was also the writer for Lee Falk's comic strips \"The Phantom\" and \"Mandrake the Magician\" while their creator served in World War II. It is widely speculated how much influence Bester had on these comics. One theory claims that Bester was responsible for giving the Phantom his surname, \"Walker\".\nAfter four years in the comics industry, in 1946 Bester turned his attention to radio scripts, after wife Rolly (a busy radio actress) told him that the show \"Nick Carter, Master Detective\" was looking for story submissions. Over the next few years, Bester wrote for \"Nick Carter\", as well as \"The Shadow\", \"Charlie Chan\", \"The New Adventures of Nero Wolfe\" and other shows. He later wrote for \"The CBS Radio Mystery Theater\".\nWith the advent of American network television in 1948, Bester also began writing for television, although most of these projects were lesser-known.\nIn early 1950, after eight years away from the field, Bester resumed writing science fiction short stories. However, after an initial return to \"Astounding\" with the story \"The Devil's Invention\" ( \"Oddy and Id\"), he stopped writing for the magazine in mid-1950 when editor John Campbell became preoccupied with L. Ron Hubbard and Dianetics, the forerunner to Scientology. Bester then turned to \"Galaxy Science Fiction\", where he found in H. L. Gold another exceptional editor as well as a good friend.\nIn New York, he socialized at the Hydra Club, an organization of New York's science fiction writers, whose notable members included Isaac Asimov, James Blish, Anthony Boucher, Avram Davidson, Judith Merril, and Theodore Sturgeon.\n\"The Demolished Man\" period: 1951\u20131957.\nIn his first period of writing science fiction (1939\u20131942), Bester had been establishing a reputation as a short story writer in science fiction circles with stories such as \"Adam and No Eve.\" However, Bester gained his greatest renown for the work he wrote and published in the 1950s, including \"The Demolished Man\" and \"The Stars My Destination\" (also known as \"Tiger! Tiger!\").\n\"The Demolished Man\" (1953).\n\"The Demolished Man\", recipient of the first Hugo Award for best Science Fiction novel, is a police procedural that takes place in a future world in which telepathy is relatively common. Bester creates a harshly capitalistic, hierarchical and competitive social world that exists without deceit: a society in which the right person with some skill (or money) and curiosity can access your memories, secrets, fears and past misdeeds more swiftly than even you.\nOriginally published in three parts in \"Galaxy\", beginning in January 1952, \"The Demolished Man\" appeared in book form in 1953. It was dedicated to Gold, who made a number of suggestions during its writing. Originally, Bester wanted the title to be \"Demolition!\", but Gold talked him out of it.\n\"Who He?\" (1953).\nBester's 1953 novel \"Who He?\" (also known as \"The Rat Race\") concerns a TV variety show writer who wakes up after an alcoholic blackout and discovers that someone is out to destroy his life. According to Bester, the TV show elements were based on his experiences working on \"The Paul Winchell Show\". A contemporary novel with no science fiction elements, it did not receive wide attention. It did, however, earn Bester a fair amount of money from the sale of the paperback reprint rights (the book appeared in paperback as \"The Rat Race\"). He also received a substantial sum of money from a movie studio for the film option to the book. Reportedly, Jackie Gleason was interested in starring as the variety show writer and licensed movie rights to the story; however no movie was ever made of \"Who He?\" Still, the payout from the film option was large enough that Alfred and Rolly Bester decided they could afford to travel to Europe for the next few years. They lived mainly in Italy and England during this period.\n\"The Stars My Destination\" (1956).\nThis novel was both widely criticized and praised when it first appeared, but over time gathered acclaim as a classic work in its own right. It has been recognized as a prescient forerunner of the cyberpunk literary genre, having first been published two decades before the genre was named.\nMagazine fiction and non-fiction: 1959\u20131962.\nWhile on his European trip, Bester began selling non-fiction pieces about various European locations to the mainstream travel/lifestyle magazine \"Holiday\". The \"Holiday\" editors, impressed with his work, invited Bester back to their headquarters in New York and began commissioning him to write travel articles about various far-flung locales, as well as doing interviews with such stars as Sophia Loren, Anthony Quinn, and Sir Edmund Hillary. As a result of steady work with \"Holiday\", Bester's science fiction output dropped precipitously in the years following the publication of \"The Stars My Destination\".\nBester published three short stories each in 1958 and 1959, including 1958's \"The Men Who Murdered Mohammed\" and 1959's \"The Pi Man\", both of which were nominated for Hugo Awards. However, for a four-year period from October 1959 to October 1963, he published no fiction at all. Instead, he concentrated on his work at \"Holiday\" (where he was made a senior editor), reviewed books for \"The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction\" (from 1960 to 1962) and returned to television scripting.\nTelevision: 1959\u20131962.\nDuring the 1950s, Bester contributed a satiric sketch, \"I Remember Hiroshima\", to \"The Paul Winchell Show\". His later story \"Hobson's Choice\" was based on it.\nIn 1959, Bester adapted his 1954 story \"Fondly Fahrenheit\" to television as \"Murder and the Android\". Telecast in color on October 18, 1959, the hour-long drama took place in the year 2359 amid futuristic sets designed by Ted Cooper. This \"NBC Sunday Showcase\" production, produced by Robert Alan Aurthur with a cast of Kevin McCarthy, Rip Torn, Suzanne Pleshette and Telly Savalas, was reviewed by syndicated radio-television critic John Crosby:\n\"Murder and the Android\" was nominated for a 1960 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation and was given a repeat on September 5, 1960, the Labor Day weekend in which that Hugo Award was presented (to \"The Twilight Zone\") at the World Science Fiction Convention in Pittsburgh. Bester returned to \"Sunday Showcase\" March 5, 1960, with an original teleplay, \"Turn the Key Deftly\". Telecast in color, that mystery, set in a traveling circus, starred Julie Harris, Maximilian Schell and Francis Lederer.\nFor \"Alcoa Premiere\", hosted by Fred Astaire, he wrote \"Mr. Lucifer\", which aired November 1, 1962, with Astaire in the title role opposite Elizabeth Montgomery. A light comedy, the story concerned the modern day Lucifer\u2014whose offices are now on Madison Avenue\u2014working with his beautiful secretary to try to corrupt a clean-cut American husband and wife.\nSenior editor of \"Holiday\": 1963\u20131971.\nAfter a four-year layoff, Bester published a handful of science fiction short stories in 1963 and 1964. However, writing science fiction was at this stage in Bester's life clearly more of a sideline than the focus of his career. As a result, from 1964 until the original version of \"Holiday\" folded in 1971, Bester published only one science fiction short story, a 700-word science fiction spoof in the upscale mainstream magazine \"Status\".\nStill, as senior editor of \"Holiday\", Bester was able to introduce occasional science fiction elements into the non-fiction magazine. On one occasion, he commissioned and published an article by Arthur C. Clarke describing a tourist flight to the Moon. Bester himself, though, never published any science fiction in \"Holiday\", which was a mainstream travel/lifestyle magazine marketed to upscale readers during an era when science fiction was largely dismissed as juvenilia.\nLater career: 1972\u20131987.\n\"Holiday\" magazine ceased publication in 1971, although it was later revived and reformatted by other hands, without Bester's involvement. For the first time in nearly 15 years, Bester did not have full-time employment.\nAfter a long layoff from writing science fiction, Bester returned to the field in 1972. His 1974 short story \"The Four-Hour Fugue\" was nominated for a Hugo Award, and Bester received Hugo and Nebula Award nominations for his 1975 novel \"The Computer Connection\" (titled \"The Indian Giver\" as a magazine serial and later reprinted as \"Extro\"). Despite these nominations, Bester's work of this era generally failed to receive the critical or commercial success of his earlier period.\nBester's eyesight began failing in the mid-1970s, making writing increasingly difficult, and another layoff from published writing took place between early 1975 and early 1979. It is alleged during this period that the producer of the 1978 \"Superman\" movie sent his son off to search for a writer. The name Alfred Bester came up, but Bester wanted to focus the story on Clark Kent as the real hero, while Superman was only \"his gun.\" The producers instead hired Mario Puzo, author of \"The Godfather\", to write the film.\nCarolyn Wendell wrote, \"I shall always remember the time I saw Alfie Bester in larger-than-life action, at an academic conference in New York City ten years before he died\":\nBester published two short stories in 1979 and rang in the 1980s with the publication of two new novels: \"Golem100\" (1980), and \"The Deceivers\" (1981). In addition to his failing eyesight, other health issues began to affect him, and Bester produced no new published work after 1981. His wife Rolly died in 1984. In the following years, Bester dated Judith H. McQuown (pronounced \"McQueen\").\nIn 1985, it was announced that Bester would be a Guest of Honor at the 1987 Worldcon, to be held in Brighton, England. As the event neared, however, Bester fell and broke his hip. With his worsening overall health, he was plainly too ill to attend.\nBester died less than a month after the convention from complications related to his broken hip. However, shortly before his death he learned that the Science Fiction Writers of America would honor him with their Grand Master Nebula award at their 1988 convention.\nTwo works by Bester were published posthumously. The first, \"Tender Loving Rage\" (1991), was a mainstream (i.e., non\u2013science fiction) novel that was probably written in the late 1950s or early 1960s. The second, \"Psychoshop\" (1998), was based on an incomplete 92-page story fragment. It was completed by Roger Zelazny and remained unpublished until three years after Zelazny's death. When published, it was credited as a collaborative work.\nUpon his death, Bester left his literary estate to his friend and bartender Joe Suder.\nAwards.\nThe Science Fiction Writers of America made Bester its ninth SFWA Grand Master in 1988 (announced before his 1987 death) and the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame inducted him in 2001, its sixth class of two deceased and two living writers.\nBeside winning the inaugural Hugo Award, he was one of the runners-up for several annual literary awards.\nHugo Award:\nHugo nominations:\nIn the Best Novel categories, \"The Computer Connection\" was a finalist for both the Hugo and Nebula Awards and third place for the Locus Award.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Although similar in appearance to dolphins, they are more closely related to narwhals and belugas. There are eight extant species of porpoise, all among the smallest of the toothed whales. Porpoises are distinguished from dolphins by their flattened, spade-shaped teeth distinct from the conical teeth of dolphins, and lack of a pronounced beak, although some dolphins (e.g. Hector's dolphin) also lack a pronounced beak. Porpoises, and other cetaceans, belong to the clade Cetartiodactyla with even-toed ungulates.\nPorpoises range in size from the vaquita, at in length and in weight, to the Dall's porpoise, at and . Several species exhibit sexual dimorphism in that the females are larger than males. They have streamlined bodies and two limbs that are modified into flippers. Porpoises use echolocation as their primary sensory system. Some species are well adapted for diving to great depths. As all cetaceans, they have a layer of fat, or blubber, under the skin to keep them warm in cold water.\nPorpoises are abundant and found in a multitude of environments, including rivers (finless porpoise), coastal and shelf waters (harbour porpoise, vaquita) and open ocean (Dall's porpoise and spectacled porpoise), covering all water temperatures from tropical (Sea of Cortez, vaquita) to polar (Greenland, harbour porpoise). Porpoises feed largely on fish and squid, much like the rest of the odontocetes. Little is known about reproductive behaviour. Females may have one calf every year under favourable conditions. Calves are typically born in the spring and summer months and remain dependent on the female until the following spring. Porpoises produce ultrasonic clicks, which are used for both navigation (echolocation) and social communication. In contrast to many dolphin species, porpoises do not form large social groups.\nPorpoises were, and still are, hunted by some countries by means of drive hunting. Larger threats to porpoises include extensive bycatch in gill nets, competition for food from fisheries, and marine pollution, in particular heavy metals and organochlorides. The vaquita is nearly extinct due to bycatch in gill nets, with a predicted population of fewer than a dozen individuals. Since the extinction of the baiji, the vaquita is considered the most endangered cetacean. Some species of porpoises have been and are kept in captivity and trained for research, education and public display.\nTaxonomy and evolution.\nPorpoises, along with whales and dolphins, are descendants of land-living ungulates (hoofed animals) that first entered the oceans around 50 million years ago (Mya). During the Miocene (23 to 5 Mya), mammals were fairly modern, meaning they seldom changed physiologically from the time. The cetaceans diversified, and fossil evidence suggests porpoises and dolphins diverged from their last common ancestor around 15 Mya. The oldest fossils are known from the shallow seas around the North Pacific, with animals spreading to the European coasts and Southern Hemisphere only much later, during the Pliocene.\nRecently discovered hybrids between male harbour porpoises and female Dall's porpoises indicate the two species may actually be members of the same genus.\nBiology.\nAnatomy.\nPorpoises have a bulbous head, no external ear flaps, a non-flexible neck, a torpedo shaped body, limbs modified into flippers, and a tail fin. Their skull has small eye orbits, small, blunt snouts, and eyes placed on the sides of the head. Porpoises range in size from the and vaquita to the and Dall's porpoise. Overall, they tend to be dwarfed by other cetaceans. Almost all species have female-biased sexual dimorphism, with the females being larger than the males, although those physical differences are generally small; one exception is Dall's porpoise.\nOdontocetes possess teeth with cementum cells overlying dentine cells. Unlike human teeth, which are composed mostly of enamel on the portion of the tooth outside of the gum, whale teeth have cementum outside the gum. Porpoises have a three-chambered stomach, including a fore-stomach and fundic and pyloric chambers. Porpoises, like other odontocetes, possess only one blowhole. Breathing involves expelling stale air from the blowhole, forming an upward, steamy spout, followed by inhaling fresh air into the lungs. All porpoises have a thick layer of blubber. This blubber can help with insulation from the harsh underwater climate, protection to some extent as predators would have a hard time getting through a thick layer of fat, and energy for leaner times. Calves are born with only a thin layer of blubber, but rapidly gain a thick layer from the milk, which has a very high fat content.\nLocomotion.\nPorpoises have two flippers on the front and a tail fin. Their flippers contain four digits. Although porpoises do not possess fully developed hind limbs, they possess discrete rudimentary appendages, which may contain feet and digits. Porpoises are fast swimmers in comparison to seals, which typically cruise at . The fusing of the neck vertebrae, while increasing stability when swimming at high speeds, decreases flexibility, making it impossible for them to turn their head. When swimming, they move their tail fin and lower body up and down, propelling themselves through vertical movement, while their flippers are mainly used for steering. Flipper movement is continuous. Some species log out of the water, which may allow them to travel faster, and sometimes they porpoise out of the water, meaning jump out of the water. Their skeletal anatomy allows them to be fast swimmers. They have a very well defined and triangular dorsal fin, allowing them to steer better in the water. Unlike their dolphin counterparts, they are adapted for coastal shores, bays, and estuaries.\nSenses.\nThe porpoise ear has specific adaptations to the marine environment. In humans, the middle ear works as an impedance equaliser between the outside air's low impedance and the cochlear fluid's high impedance. In whales, and other marine mammals, there is no great difference between the outer and inner environments. Instead of sound passing through the outer ear to the middle ear, porpoises receive sound through the throat, from which it passes through a low-impedance fat-filled cavity to the inner ear. The porpoise ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets, which allow for greater directional hearing underwater. Odontocetes send out high frequency clicks from an organ known as a melon. This melon consists of fat, and the skull of any such creature containing a melon will have a large depression. The large bulge on top of the porpoises head is caused by the melon.\nThe porpoise eye is relatively small for its size, yet they do retain a good degree of eyesight. As well as this, the eyes of a porpoise are placed on the sides of its head, so their vision consists of two fields, rather than a binocular view like humans have. When porpoises surface, their lens and cornea correct the nearsightedness that results from the refraction of light; their eyes contain both rod and cone cells, meaning they can see in both dim and bright light. Porpoises do, however, lack short wavelength sensitive visual pigments in their cone cells indicating a more limited capacity for colour vision than most mammals. Most porpoises have slightly flattened eyeballs, enlarged pupils (which shrink as they surface to prevent damage), slightly flattened corneas and a tapetum lucidum; these adaptations allow for large amounts of light to pass through the eye and, therefore, they are able to form a very clear image of the surrounding area.\nThe olfactory lobes are absent in porpoises, suggesting that they have no sense of smell.\nPorpoises are not thought to have a good sense of taste, as their taste buds are atrophied or missing altogether. However, some have preferences between different kinds of fish, indicating some sort of attachment to taste.\nSleep.\nUnlike most animals, porpoises are conscious breathers. All mammals sleep, but porpoises cannot afford to become unconscious for long because they may drown. While knowledge of sleep in wild cetaceans is limited, porpoises in captivity have been recorded to sleep with one side of their brain at a time, so that they may swim, breathe consciously, and avoid both predators and social contact during their period of rest.\nBehaviour.\nLife cycle.\nPorpoises are fully aquatic creatures. Females deliver a single calf after a gestation period lasting about a year. Calving takes place entirely under water, with the foetus positioned for tail-first delivery to help prevent drowning. Females have mammary glands, but the shape of a newborn calf's mouth does not allow it to obtain a seal around the nipple\u2014instead of the calf sucking milk, the mother squirts milk into the calf's mouth. This milk contains high amounts of fat, which aids in the development of blubber; it contains so much fat that it has the consistency of toothpaste. The calves are weaned at about 11 months of age. Males play no part in rearing calves. The calf is dependent for one to two years, and maturity occurs after seven to ten years, all varying between species. This mode of reproduction produces few offspring, but increases the probability of each one surviving.\nDiet.\nPorpoises eat a wide variety of creatures. The stomach contents of harbour porpoises suggests that they mainly feed on benthic fish, and sometimes pelagic fish. They may also eat benthic invertebrates. In rare cases, algae, such as \"Ulva lactuca\", is consumed. Atlantic porpoises are thought to follow the seasonal migration of bait fish, like herring, and their diet varies between seasons. The stomach contents of Dall's porpoises reveal that they mainly feed on cephalopods and bait fish, like capelin and sardines. Their stomachs also contained some deep-sea benthic organisms.\nThe finless porpoise is known to also follow seasonal migrations. It is known that populations in the mouth of the Indus River migrate to the sea from April through October to feed on the annual spawning of prawns. In Japan, sightings of small pods of them herding sand lance onto shore are common year-round.\nLittle is known about the diets of other species of porpoises. A dissection of three Burmeister's porpoises shows that they consume shrimp and euphausiids (krill). A dissection of a beached Vaquita showed remains of squid and grunts. Nothing is known about the diet of the spectacled porpoise.\nInteractions with humans.\nResearch history.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe tube in the head, through which this kind fish takes its breath and spitting water, located in front of the brain and ends outwardly in a simple hole, but inside it is divided by a downward bony septum, as if it were two nostrils; but underneath it opens up again in the mouth in a void.\n\u2013John Ray, 1671, the earliest description of cetacean airways\nIn Aristotle's time, the 4th century BCE, porpoises were regarded as fish due to their superficial similarity. Aristotle, however, could already see many physiological and anatomical similarities with the terrestrial vertebrates, such as blood (circulation), lungs, uterus and fin anatomy. His detailed descriptions were assimilated by the Romans, but mixed with a more accurate knowledge of the dolphins, as mentioned by Pliny the Elder in his \"Natural history\". In the art of this and subsequent periods, porpoises are portrayed with a long snout (typical of dolphins) and a high-arched head. The harbour porpoise was one of the most accessible species for early cetologists, because it could be seen very close to land, inhabiting shallow coastal areas of Europe. Much of the findings that apply to all cetaceans were first discovered in porpoises. One of the first anatomical descriptions of the airways of the whales on the basis of a harbor porpoise dates from 1671 by John Ray. It nevertheless referred to the porpoise as a fish, most likely not in the modern-day sense, where it refers to a zoological group, but the older reference as simply a creature of the sea (cf. for example \"star-fish\", \"cuttle-fish\", \"jelly-fish\" and \"whale-fish\").\nIn captivity.\nHarbour porpoises have historically been kept in captivity, under the assumption that they would fare better than their dolphin counterparts due to their smaller size and shallow-water habitats. Up until the 1980s, they were consistently short-lived. Harbour porpoises have a very long captive history, with poorly documented attempts as early as the 15th century, and better documented starting in the 1860s and 1870s in London Zoo, the now-closed Brighton Aquarium &amp; Dolphinarium, and a zoo in Germany. At least 150 harbour porpoises have been kept worldwide, but only about 20 were actively caught for captivity. The captive history is best documented from Denmark where about 100 harbour porpoises have been kept, most in the 1960s and 1970s. All but two were incidental catches in fishing nets or strandings. Nearly half of these died within a month of diseases caught before they were captured or from damage sustained during capture. Up until 1984, none lived for more than 14 months. Attempts to rehabilitate seven rescued individuals in 1986 only resulted in three that could be released 6 months later. Very few have been brought into captivity later, but they have lived considerably longer. In recent decades, the only place keeping the species in Denmark is the Fjord &amp; B\u00e6lt Centre, where three rescues have been kept, along with their offspring. Among the three rescues, one (father of world's first harbour porpoise born in captivity) lived for 20 years in captivity, another for 15 years, while the third (mother of first born in captivity) is the world's oldest known harbour porpoise, being 28 years old in 2023. The typical age reached in the wild is 14 years or less. Very few harbour porpoises have been born in captivity. Historically, harbour porpoises were often kept singly and those who were together often were not mature or of the same sex. Disregarding one born more than 100 years ago that was the result of a pregnant female being brought into captivity, the world's first full captive breeding was in 2007 in the Fjord &amp; B\u00e6lt Centre, followed by another in 2009 in the Dolfinarium Harderwijk, the Netherlands. In addition to the few kept in Europe, harbour porpoise were displayed at the Vancouver Aquarium (Canada) until recently. This was a female that had beached herself onto Horseshoe Bay in 2008 and a male that had done the same in 2011. They died in 2017 and 2016 respectively.\nFinless porpoises have commonly been kept in Japan, as well as China and Indonesia. As of 1984, ninety-four in total had been in captivity in Japan, eleven in China, and at least two in Indonesia. As of 1986, three establishments in Japan had bred them, and there had been five recorded births. Three calves died moments after their birth, but two survived for several years. This breeding success, combined with the results with harbour porpoise in Denmark and the Netherlands, proved that porpoises can be successfully bred in captivity, and this could open up new conservation options. The reopened Miyajima Public Aquarium (Japan) houses three finless porpoises. As part of an attempt of saving the narrow-ridged (or Yangtze) finless porpoise, several are kept in the Baiji Dolphinarium in China. After having been kept in captivity for 9 years, the first breeding happened in 2005.\nSmall numbers of Dall's porpoises have been kept in captivity in both the United States and Japan, with the most recent being in the 1980s. The first recorded instance of a Dall's taken for an aquarium was in 1956 captured off Catalina Island in southern California. Dall's porpoises consistently failed to thrive in captivity. These animals often repeatedly ran into the walls of their enclosures, refused food, and exhibited skin sloughing. Almost all Dall's porpoises introduced to aquaria died shortly after, typically within days. Only two have lived for more than 60 days: a male reached 15 months at Marineland of the Pacific and another 21 months at a United States Navy facility.\nAs part of last-ditch effort of saving the extremely rare vaquita (the tiny remaining population is rapidly declining because of bycatch in gillnets), there have been attempts of transferring some to captivity. The first and only caught for captivity were two females in 2017. Both became distressed and were rapidly released, but one of them died in the process. Soon after the project was abandoned.\nOnly a single Burmeister's porpoise and a single spectacled porpoise have been kept in captivity. Both were stranded individuals that only survived a few days after their rescue.\nThreats.\nHunting.\nPorpoises and other smaller cetaceans have traditionally been hunted in many areas, at least in Asia, Europe and North America, for their meat and blubber. A dominant hunting technique is drive hunting, where a pod of animals is driven together with boats and usually into a bay or onto a beach. Their escape is prevented by closing off the route to the ocean with other boats or nets. This type of fishery for harbour porpoises is best documented from the Danish straits, where it occurred until the end of the 19th century (it was banned in 1899), and again during the shortages in World War I and World War II. The Inuit in the Arctic hunt harbour porpoises by shooting and drive hunt for Dall's porpoise still takes place in Japan. The number of individuals taken each year is in the thousands, although a quota of around 17,000 per year is in effect today making it the largest direct hunt of any cetacean species in the world and the sustainability of the hunt has been questioned.\nFishing.\nPorpoises are highly affected by bycatch. Many porpoises, mainly the vaquita, are subject to great mortality due to gillnetting. Although it is the world's most endangered marine cetacean, the vaquita continues to be caught in small-mesh gillnet fisheries throughout much of its range. Incidental mortality caused by the fleet of El Golfo de Santa Clara was estimated to be at around 39 vaquitas per year, which is over 17% of the population size. Harbour porpoises also suffer drowning by gillnetting, but on a less threatening scale due to their high population; their mortality rate per year increases a mere 5% due to this.\nThe fishing market, historically has always had a porpoise bycatch. Today, the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 has enforced the use of safer fishing equipment to reduce bycatch.\nEnvironmental hazards.\nPorpoises are very sensitive to anthropogenic disturbances, and are keystone species, which can indicate the overall health of the marine environment. Populations of harbor porpoises in the North and Baltic Seas are under increasing pressure from anthropogenic causes such as offshore construction, ship traffic, fishing, and military exercises. Increasing pollution is a serious problem for marine mammals. Heavy metals and plastic waste are not biodegradable, and sometimes cetaceans consume these hazardous materials, mistaking them for food items. As a result, the animals are more susceptible to diseases and have fewer offspring. Harbour porpoises from the English Channel were found to have accumulated heavy metals.\nThe military and geologists employ strong sonar and produce an increases in noise in the oceans. Marine mammals that make use of biosonar for orientation and communication are not only hindered by the extra noise, but may race to the surface in panic. This may lead to a bubbling out of blood gases, and the animal then dies because the blood vessels become blocked, so-called decompression sickness. This effect, of course, only occurs in porpoises that dive to great depths, such as Dall's porpoise.\nAdditionally, civilian vessels produce sonar waves to measure the depth of the body of water in which they are. Similar to the navy, some boats produce waves that attract porpoises, while others may repel them. The problem with the waves that attract is that the animal may be injured or even killed by being hit by the vessel or its propeller.\nConservation.\nThe harbour porpoise, spectacled porpoise, Burmeister's porpoise, and Dall's porpoise are all listed on Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). In addition, the Harbour porpoise is covered by the Agreement on the Conservation of Small Cetaceans of the Baltic, North East Atlantic, Irish and North Seas (ASCOBANS), the Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans in the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and Contiguous Atlantic Area (ACCOBAMS) and the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Conservation of the Manatee and Small Cetaceans of Western Africa and Macaronesia. Their conservation statuses are either at least concern or data deficient.\nAs of 2014, only 505 Yangtze finless porpoises remained in the main section of the Yangtze, with an alarming population density in Ezhou and Zhenjiang. While many threatened species decline rate slows after their classification, population decline rates of the porpoise are actually accelerating. While population decline tracked from 1994 to 2008 has been pegged at a rate of 6.06% annually, from 2006 to 2012, the porpoise population decreased by more than half. Finless porpoise population decrease of 69.8% in just a 22-year span from 1976 to 2000. 5.3%. A majority of factors of this population decline are being driven by the massive growth in Chinese industry since 1990 which caused increased shipping and pollution and ultimately environmental degradation. Some of these can be seen in damming of the river as well as illegal fishing activity. To protect the species, China's Ministry of Agriculture classified the species as being National First Grade Key Protected Wild Animal, the strictest classification by law, meaning it is illegal to bring harm to a porpoise. Protective measures in the Tian-e-Zhou Oxbow Nature Reserve has increased its population of porpoises from five to forty in 25 years. The Chinese Academy of Sciences' Wuhan Institute of Hydrobiology has been working with the World Wildlife Fund to ensure the future for this subspecies, and have placed five porpoises in another well-protected area, the He-wang-miao oxbow. Five protected natural reserves have been established in areas of the highest population density and mortality rates with measures being taken to ban patrolling and harmful fishing gear in those areas. There have also been efforts to study porpoise biology to help specialize conservation through captivation breeding. The Baiji Dolphinarium, was established in 1992 at the Institute of Hydrobiology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Wuhan which allowing the study of behavioral and biological factors affecting the finless porpoise, specifically breeding biology like seasonal changes in reproductive hormones and breeding behavior.\nBecause vaquitas are indigenous to the Gulf of California, Mexico is leading conservation efforts with the creation of the International Committee for the Recovery of the Vaquita (CIRVA), which has tried to prevent the accidental deaths of vaquitas by outlawing the use of fishing nets within the vaquita's habitat. CIRVA has worked together with the CITES, the Endangered Species Act, and the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) to nurse the vaquita population back to a point at which they can sustain themselves. CIRVA concluded in 2000 that between 39 and 84 individuals are killed each year by such gillnets. To try to prevent extinction, the Mexican government has created a nature reserve covering the upper part of the Gulf of California and the Colorado River delta. They have also placed a temporary ban on fishing, with compensation to those affected, that may pose a threat to the vaquita.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

[15 February 1748 N.S.] \u2013 6 June 1832) was an English philosopher, jurist, and social reformer regarded as the founder of modern utilitarianism.\nBentham defined as the \"fundamental axiom\" of his philosophy the principle that \"it is the greatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right and wrong\". He became a leading theorist in Anglo-American philosophy of law, and a political radical whose ideas influenced the development of welfarism. He advocated individual and economic freedoms, the separation of church and state, freedom of expression, equal rights for women, the right to divorce, and (in an unpublished essay) the decriminalizing of homosexual acts. He called for the abolition of slavery, capital punishment, and physical punishment, including that of children. He has also become known as an early advocate of animal rights. Though strongly in favour of the extension of individual legal rights, he opposed the idea of natural law and natural rights (both of which are considered \"divine\" or \"God-given\" in origin), calling them \"nonsense upon stilts\". However, he viewed the Magna Carta as important, citing it to argue that the treatment of convicts in Australia was unlawful. Bentham was also a sharp critic of legal fictions.\nBentham's students included his secretary and collaborator James Mill, the latter's son, John Stuart Mill, the legal philosopher John Austin and American writer and activist John Neal. He \"had considerable influence on the reform of prisons, schools, poor laws, law courts, and Parliament itself.\"\nOn his death in 1832, Bentham left instructions for his body to be first dissected and then to be permanently preserved as an \"auto-icon\" (or self-image), which would be his memorial. This was done, and the auto-icon is now on public display in the entrance of the Student Centre at University College London (UCL). Although he has been described as the \"spiritual founder\" of UCL due to his advocacy for the general availability of education, his direct involvement in the university's founding was limited.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nBentham was born on 4 February 1747/8 O.S. [15 February 1748 N.S.] in Houndsditch, London, to attorney Jeremiah Bentham and Alicia Woodward, widow of a Mr Whitehorne and daughter of mercer Thomas Grove, of Andover. His wealthy family were supporters of the Tory party. He was reportedly a child prodigy: he was found as a toddler sitting at his father's desk reading a multi-volume history of England, and he began to study Latin at the age of three. He learnt to play the violin, and at the age of seven Bentham would perform sonatas by Handel during dinner parties. He had one surviving sibling, Samuel Bentham, with whom he was close.\nHe attended Westminster School; in 1760, at age 12, his father sent him to The Queen's College, Oxford, where he completed his bachelor's degree in 1764, receiving the title of MA in 1767. He trained as a lawyer and, though he never practised, was called to the bar in 1769. He became deeply frustrated with the complexity of English law, which he termed the \"Demon of Chicane\". When the American colonies published their Declaration of Independence in July 1776, the British government did not issue any official response but instead secretly commissioned London lawyer and pamphleteer John Lind to publish a rebuttal. His 130-page tract was distributed in the colonies and contained an essay titled \"Short Review of the Declaration\" written by Bentham, a friend of Lind, which attacked and mocked the Americans' political philosophy.\nAbortive prison project and the Panopticon.\nIn 1786 and 1787, Bentham travelled to Krichev in White Russia (now known as Belarus) to visit his brother, Samuel, who was engaged in managing various industrial and other projects for Prince Potemkin. It was Samuel who conceived the basic idea of a circular building at the center of a larger compound, designed to enable a small number of managers to oversee the activities of a large, unskilled workforce\u2014a point Jeremy later repeatedly acknowledged.\nBentham began to develop this model, particularly as applicable to prisons, and outlined his ideas in a series of letters sent home to his father in England. He supplemented the supervisory principle with the idea of \"contract management\"; that is, an administration by contract as opposed to trust, where the director would have a pecuniary interest in lowering the average rate of mortality.\nThe Panopticon was intended to be cheaper than the prisons of his time, as it required fewer staff; \"Allow me to construct a prison on this model\", Bentham requested to a Committee for the Reform of Criminal Law, \"I will be the gaoler. You will see ... that the gaoler will have no salary\u2014will cost nothing to the nation.\" As the watchmen cannot be seen, they need not be on duty at all times, effectively leaving the watching to the watched. According to Bentham's design, the prisoners would also be used as menial labour, walking on wheels to spin looms or run a water wheel. This would decrease the cost of the prison and give a possible source of income.\nThe ultimately abortive proposal for a panopticon prison to be built in England was one among his many proposals for legal and social reform. But Bentham spent some sixteen years of his life developing and refining his ideas for the building and hoped that the government would adopt the plan for a National Penitentiary appointing him as contractor-governor. Although the prison was never built, the concept had an important influence on later generations of thinkers. Twentieth-century French philosopher Michel Foucault argued that the panopticon was paradigmatic of several 19th-century \"disciplinary\" institutions. Bentham remained bitter throughout his later life about the rejection of the panopticon scheme, convinced that it had been thwarted by the King and an aristocratic elite. Philip Schofield argues that it was largely because of his sense of injustice and frustration that he developed his ideas of \"sinister interest\"\u2014that is, of the vested interests of the powerful conspiring against a wider public interest\u2014which underpinned many of his broader arguments for reform.\nOn his return to England from Russia, Bentham had commissioned drawings from an architect, Willey Reveley. In 1791, he published the material he had written as a book, although he continued to refine his proposals for many years to come. He had by now decided that he wanted to see the prison built: when finished, it would be managed by himself as contractor-governor, with the assistance of Samuel. After unsuccessful attempts to interest the authorities in Ireland and revolutionary France, he started trying to persuade the prime minister, William Pitt, to revive an earlier abandoned scheme for a National Penitentiary in England, this time to be built as a panopticon. He was eventually successful in winning over Pitt and his advisors, and in 1794 was paid \u00a32,000 for preliminary work on the project.\nThe intended site was one that had been authorised, under the Appropriation Act 1799 (39 Geo. 3. c. 114) for the earlier penitentiary, at Battersea Rise; but the new proposals ran into technical legal problems and objections from the local landowner, the Earl Spencer. Other sites were considered, including one at Hanging Wood, near Woolwich, but all proved unsatisfactory. Eventually Bentham turned to a site at Tothill Fields, near Westminster. Although this was common land, with no landowner, there were a number of parties with interests in it, including Earl Grosvenor, who owned a house on an adjacent site and objected to the idea of a prison overlooking it. Again, therefore, the scheme ground to a halt At this point, however, it became clear that a nearby site at Millbank, adjoining the Thames, was available for sale, and this time things ran more smoothly. Using government money, Bentham bought the land on behalf of the Crown for \u00a312,000 in November 1799.\nFrom his point of view, the site was far from ideal, being marshy, unhealthy, and too small. When he asked the government for more land and more money, however, the response was that he should build only a small-scale experimental prison\u2014which he interpreted as meaning that there was little real commitment to the concept of the panopticon as a cornerstone of penal reform. Negotiations continued, but in 1801 Pitt resigned from office, and in 1803 the new Addington administration decided not to proceed with the project. Bentham was devastated: \"They have murdered my best days.\"\nNevertheless, a few years later the government revived the idea of a National Penitentiary, and in 1811 and 1812 returned specifically to the idea of a panopticon. Bentham, now aged 63, was still willing to be governor. However, as it became clear that there was still no real commitment to the proposal, he abandoned hope, and instead turned his attentions to extracting financial compensation for his years of fruitless effort. His initial claim was for the enormous sum of nearly \u00a3700,000, but he eventually settled for the more modest (but still considerable) sum of \u00a323,000. The Penitentiary House, etc. Act 1812 (52 Geo. 3. c. 44) transferred his title in the site to the Crown.\nMore successful was his cooperation with Patrick Colquhoun in tackling the corruption in the Pool of London. This resulted in the Depredations on the Thames Act 1800 (39 &amp; 40 Geo. 3. c. 87). The Act created the Thames River Police, which was the first preventive police force in the country and was a precedent for Robert Peel's reforms 30 years later.\nCorrespondence and contemporary influences.\nBentham was in correspondence with many influential people. In the 1780s, for example, Bentham maintained a correspondence with the ageing Adam Smith, in an unsuccessful attempt to convince Smith that interest rates should be allowed to freely float. As a result of his correspondence with Mirabeau and other leaders of the French Revolution, Bentham was declared an honorary citizen of France. He was an outspoken critic of the revolutionary discourse of natural rights and of the violence that arose after the Jacobins took power (1792). Between 1808 and 1810, he held a personal friendship with Latin American revolutionary Francisco de Miranda and paid visits to Miranda's Grafton Way house in London. He also developed links with Jos\u00e9 Cecilio del Valle.\nIn 1821, John Cartwright proposed to Bentham that they serve as \"Guardians of Constitutional Reform\", seven \"wise men\" whose reports and observations would \"concern the entire Democracy or Commons of the United Kingdom\". Describing himself, among the names mentioned which also included Sir Francis Burdett, George Ensor, and Sir Matthew Wood, and as a \"nonentity\", Bentham declined the offer.\nSouth Australian colony proposal.\nOn 3 August 1831 the Committee of the National Colonization Society approved the printing of its proposal to establish a free colony on the south coast of Australia, funded by the sale of appropriated colonial lands, overseen by a joint-stock company, and which would be granted powers of self-government as soon as was practicable. Contrary to assumptions, Bentham had no hand in the preparation of the 'Proposal to His Majesty's Government for founding a colony on the Southern Coast of Australia, which was prepared under the auspices of Robert Gouger, Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey, and Anthony Bacon. Bentham did, however, in August 1831, draft an unpublished work entitled 'Colonization Company Proposal', which constitutes his commentary upon the National Colonization Society's 'Proposal'.\n\"Westminster Review\".\nIn 1823, he co-founded \"The Westminster Review\" with James Mill as a journal for the \"Philosophical Radicals\"\u2014a group of younger disciples through whom Bentham exerted considerable influence in British public life. One was John Bowring, to whom Bentham became devoted, describing their relationship as \"son and father\": he appointed Bowring political editor of \"The Westminster Review\" and eventually his literary executor. Another was Edwin Chadwick, who wrote on hygiene, sanitation, and policing and was a major contributor to the Poor Law Amendment Act: Bentham employed Chadwick as a secretary and bequeathed him a large legacy.\nPersonal life.\nBentham lived a highly structured and disciplined life, but he also exhibited eccentric behavior. He referred to his walking stick as \"Dapple\" and his cat as \"The Reverend Sir John Langbourne.\" He had several infatuations with women, and wrote on sex. But he never married. Bentham's daily pattern was to rise at 6 am, walk for 2 hours or more, and then work until 4 pm.\nAn insight into his character is given in Michael St. John Packe's \"The Life of John Stuart Mill\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;During his youthful visits to Bowood House, the country seat of his patron Lord Lansdowne, he had passed his time at falling unsuccessfully in love with all the ladies of the house, whom he courted with a clumsy jocularity, while playing chess with them or giving them lessons on the harpsichord. Hopeful to the last, at the age of eighty he wrote again to one of them, recalling to her memory the far-off days when she had \"presented him, in ceremony, with the flower in the green lane\" [citing Bentham's memoirs]. To the end of his life he could not hear of Bowood without tears swimming in his eyes, and he was forced to exclaim, \"Take me forward, I entreat you, to the future\u2014do not let me go back to the past.\"\nA psychobiographical study by Philip Lucas and Anne Sheeran argues that he may have had Asperger's syndrome.\nWork.\nAnimal rights.\nBentham is widely regarded as one of the earliest proponents of animal rights. He argued and believed that the ability to suffer, not the ability to reason, should be the benchmark, or what he called the \"insuperable line\". If reason alone were the criterion by which we judge who ought to have rights, human infants and adults with certain forms of disability might fall short, too. In 1780, alluding to the limited degree of legal protection afforded to slaves in the French West Indies by the Code Noir, he wrote:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The day has been, I am sad to say in many places it is not yet past, in which the greater part of the species, under the denomination of slaves, have been treated by the law exactly upon the same footing, as, in England for example, the inferior races of animals are still. The day \"may\" come when the rest of the animal creation may acquire those rights which never could have been witholden from them but by the hand of tyranny. The French have already discovered that the blackness of the skin is no reason a human being should be abandoned without redress to the caprice of a tormentor. It may one day come to be recognised that the number of the legs, the villosity of the skin, or the termination of the \"os sacrum\" are reasons equally insufficient for abandoning a sensitive being to the same fate. What else is it that should trace the insuperable line? Is it the faculty of reason or perhaps the faculty of discourse? But a full-grown horse or dog, is beyond comparison a more rational, as well as a more conversable animal, than an infant of a day or a week or even a month, old. But suppose the case were otherwise, what would it avail? The question is not, Can they \"reason\"? nor, Can they \"talk\"? but, Can they \"suffer\"?Earlier in the paragraph, Bentham makes clear that he accepted that animals could be killed for food, or in defence of human life, provided that the animal was not made to suffer unnecessarily. Bentham did not object to medical experiments on animals, providing that the experiments had in mind a particular goal of benefit to humanity, and had a reasonable chance of achieving that goal. He wrote that otherwise he had a \"decided and insuperable objection\" to causing pain to animals, in part because of the harmful effects such practices might have on human beings. In a letter to the editor of the \"Morning Chronicle\" in March 1825, he wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEconomics.\nBentham generally endorsed \"laissez-faire\" approaches where market forces yielded optimal utility, such as in trade and production, but qualified this by permitting legislative intervention to correct market failures, like monopolies or externalities that diminished overall welfare. Regarding the role of government in the economy, he said \"With the view of causing an increase to take place in the mass of national wealth...the general rule is, that nothing ought to be done or attempted by government. The motto, or watchword of government, on these occasions, ought to be - Be quiet.\"\nBentham stated that pleasures and pains can be ranked according to their value or \"dimension\" such as intensity, duration, certainty of a pleasure or a pain. He was concerned with maxima and minima of pleasures and pains; and they set a precedent for the future employment of the maximisation principle in the economics of the consumer, the firm and the search for an optimum in welfare economics.\nBentham advocated \"Pauper Management\" which involved the creation of a chain of large workhouses.\nAndrew Lawless writes that Bentham's \"theoretical contributions to the political, economic, legal and psychological structures of English capitalism were enormous. Even Marx moved through a world that had been well-described by the arch-Philistine's voice. In his unique way, Bentham defined and analyzed the England of the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth centuries, creating not only a comprehensive social theory but, with the help of James Mill and others, a political movement to go with it.\"\nMonetary economics.\nBentham's opinions about monetary economics were completely different from those of David Ricardo; however, they had some similarities to those of Henry Thornton. He focused on monetary expansion as a means of helping to create full employment. He was also aware of the relevance of forced saving, propensity to consume, the saving-investment relationship, and other matters that form the content of modern income and employment analysis. His monetary view was close to the fundamental concepts employed in his model of utilitarian decision making. His work is considered to be an early precursor of modern welfare economics.\nGender and sexuality.\nBentham said that it was the placing of women in a legally inferior position that made him choose in 1759, at the age of eleven, the career of a reformist, though American critic John Neal claimed to have convinced him to take up women's rights issues during their association between 1825 and 1827. Bentham spoke for a complete equality between the sexes, arguing in favour of women's suffrage, a woman's right to obtain a divorce, and a woman's right to hold political office.\nThe c.\u20091785 essay \"Paederasty (Offences Against One's Self)\" argued for the liberalisation of laws prohibiting homosexual sex. The essay remained unpublished during his lifetime for fear of offending public morality. Some of Bentham's writings on \"sexual non-conformity\" were published for the first time in 1931, but \"Paederasty\" was not published until 1978. Bentham does not believe homosexual acts to be unnatural, describing them merely as \"irregularities of the venereal appetite\". The essay chastises the society of the time for making a disproportionate response to what Bentham appears to consider a largely private offence\u2014public displays or forced acts being dealt with rightly by other laws. When the essay was published in the \"Journal of Homosexuality\" in 1978, the abstract stated that Bentham's essay was the \"first known argument for homosexual law reform in England\".\nImperialism.\nBentham's writings in the early 1790s onwards expressed an opposition to imperialism. His 1793 pamphlet \"Emancipate Your Colonies!\" critiqued French colonialism. In the early 1820s, he argued that the liberal government in Spain should emancipate its New World colonies. In the essay \"Plan for an Universal and Perpetual Peace\", Bentham argued that Britain should emancipate its New World colonies and abandon its colonial ambitions. He argued that empire was bad for the greatest number in the metropole and the colonies. According to Bentham, empire was financially unsound, entailed taxation on the poor in the metropole, caused unnecessary expansion in the military apparatus, undermined the security of the metropole, and were ultimately motivated by misguided ideas of honour and glory.\nLaw reform.\nBentham was the first person to be an aggressive advocate for the codification of \"all\" of the common law into a coherent set of statutes; he was actually the person who coined the verb \"to codify\" to refer to the process of drafting a legal code. He lobbied hard for the formation of codification commissions in both England and the United States, and went so far as to write to President James Madison in 1811 to volunteer to write a complete legal code for the young country. After he learned more about American law and realised that most of it was state-based, he promptly wrote to the governors of every single state with the same offer.\nDuring his lifetime, Bentham's codification efforts were completely unsuccessful. Even today, they have been completely rejected by almost every common law jurisdiction, including England. However, his writings on the subject laid the foundation for the moderately successful codification work of David Dudley Field II in the United States a generation later.\nPrivacy.\nFor Bentham, transparency had moral value. For example, journalism puts power-holders under moral scrutiny. However, Bentham wanted such transparency to apply to everyone influential. This he describes by picturing the world as a gymnasium in which each \"gesture, every turn of limb or feature, in those whose motions have a visible impact on the general happiness, will be noticed and marked down\". He considered both surveillance and transparency to be useful ways of generating understanding and improvements for people's lives.\nRacial views.\nBentham believed each race to be different, independent of climate or place of birth. He wrote in \"An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Another article in the catalogue of secondary circumstances, is that of race or lineage: the national race or lineage a man issues from. This circumstance, independently of that of climate, will commonly make some difference in point of radical frame of mind and body. A man of negro race, born in France or England, is a very different being, in many respects, from a man of French or English race. A man of Spanish race, born in Mexico or Peru, is at the hour of his birth a different sort of being, in many respects, from a man of the original Mexican or Peruvian race. This circumstance, as far as it is distinct from climate, rank, and education, and from the two just mentioned, operates chiefly through the medium of moral, religious, sympathetic, and antipathetic biases\".\u2014\u200a\nTheory of Fictions.\nBentham's Theory of Fictions explored how language shapes thought, particularly in legal and political discourse. He distinguished between \"fabulous entities\", which are purely imaginary (e.g., literary or mythological figures like Prince Hamlet or a centaur), and \"fictitious entities\", which have no physical existence but are essential for reasoning (e.g., laws, rights, and obligations). Similar to Kant's categories, such as nature, custom, or the social contract, these fictitious entities help structure human understanding but do not exist independently.\nWhile Bentham acknowledged the necessity of \"fictitious entities\" for communication, he warned that they could obscure truth and be manipulated for deception, especially in law. He viewed legal fictions\u2014such as the notion of corporate personhood or sovereignty\u2014as tools that could be either useful or misleading, depending on their application. His analysis influenced later thinkers in legal theory, philosophy of language, and utilitarian ethics, advocating for clarity and empirical reasoning in public affairs.\nUtilitarianism.\nBentham today is considered as the \"Father of Utilitarianism\". His ambition in life was to create a \"Pannomion\", a complete utilitarian code of law. He not only proposed many legal and social reforms, but also expounded an underlying moral principle on which they should be based. This philosophy of utilitarianism took for its \"fundamental axiom\" to be the notion that \"it is the greatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right and wrong\". Bentham claimed to have borrowed this concept from the writings of Joseph Priestley, although the closest that Priestley in fact came to expressing it was in the form \"the good and happiness of the members, that is the majority of the members of any state, is the great standard by which every thing [\"sic\"] relating to that state must finally be determined.\"\nBentham was a rare major figure in the history of philosophy to endorse psychological egoism. He was also a determined opponent of religion, as Crimmins observes: \"Between 1809 and 1823 Jeremy Bentham carried out an exhaustive examination of religion with the declared aim of extirpating religious beliefs, even the idea of religion itself, from the minds of men.\"\nBentham also suggested a procedure for estimating the moral status of any action, which he called the hedonistic or felicific calculus.\nPrinciple of utility\nThe principle of utility, or \"greatest happiness principle\", forms the cornerstone of all Bentham's thought. By \"happiness\", he understood a predominance of \"pleasure\" over \"pain\". He wrote in \"An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Nature has placed mankind under the governance of two sovereign masters, pain and pleasure. It is for them alone to point out what we ought to do, as well as to determine what we shall do. On the one hand the standard of right and wrong, on the other the chain of causes and effects, are fastened to their throne. They govern us in all we do, in all we say, in all we think...\nBentham's \"Principles of Morals and Legislation\" focuses on the principle of utility and how this view of morality ties into legislative practices. His principle of utility regards \"good\" as that which produces the greatest amount of pleasure and the minimum amount of pain and \"evil\" as that which produces the most pain without the pleasure. This concept of pleasure and pain is defined by Bentham as physical as well as spiritual. Bentham writes about this principle as it manifests itself within the legislation of a society.\nIn order to measure the extent of pain or pleasure that a certain decision will create, he lays down a set of criteria divided into the categories of intensity, duration, certainty, proximity, productiveness, purity, and extent. Using these measurements, he reviews the concept of punishment and when it should be used as far as whether a punishment will create more pleasure or more pain for a society.\nHe calls for legislators to determine whether punishment creates an even more evil offence. Instead of suppressing the evil acts, Bentham argues that certain unnecessary laws and punishments could ultimately lead to new and more dangerous vices than those being punished to begin with, and calls upon legislators to measure the pleasures and pains associated with any legislation and to form laws in order to create the greatest good for the greatest number. He argues that the concept of the individual pursuing his or her own happiness cannot be necessarily declared \"right\", because often these individual pursuits can lead to greater pain and less pleasure for a society as a whole. Therefore, the legislation of a society is vital to maintain the maximum pleasure and the minimum degree of pain for the greatest number of people.\nHedonistic/felicific calculus.\nIn his exposition of the felicific calculus, Bentham proposed a classification of 12 pains and 14 pleasures, by which we might test the \"happiness factor\" of any action. For Bentham, according to P.J. Kelly, the law \"provides the basic framework of social interaction by delimiting spheres of personal inviolability within which individuals can form and pursue their own conceptions of well-being\". It provides security, a precondition for the formation of expectations. As the hedonic calculus shows \"expectation utilities\" to be much higher than natural ones, it follows that Bentham does not favour the sacrifice of a few to the benefit of the many. Law professor Alan Dershowitz has quoted Bentham to argue that torture should sometimes be permitted.\nCriticisms.\nUtilitarianism was revised and expanded by Bentham's student John Stuart Mill, who sharply criticised Bentham's view of human nature, which failed to recognise conscience as a human motive. Mill considered Bentham's view \"to have done and to be doing very serious evil\". In Mill's hands, \"Benthamism\" became a major element in the liberal conception of state policy objectives.\nBentham's critics have claimed that he undermined the foundation of a free society by rejecting natural rights. Historian Gertrude Himmelfarb wrote \"The principle of the greatest happiness of the greatest number was as inimical to the idea of liberty as to the idea of rights.\"\nBentham's \"hedonistic\" theory (a term from J. J. C. Smart) is often criticised for lacking a principle of fairness embodied in a conception of justice. In \"Bentham and the Common Law Tradition\", Gerald J. Postema states: \"No moral concept suffers more at Bentham's hand than the concept of justice. There is no sustained, mature analysis of the notion.\" Thus, some critics object, it would be acceptable to torture one person if this would produce an amount of happiness in other people outweighing the unhappiness of the tortured individual. However, as P.J. Kelly argued in \"Utilitarianism and Distributive Justice: Jeremy Bentham and the Civil Law\", Bentham had a theory of justice that prevented such consequences.\nLegacy.\nBentham influenced economists such as Milton Friedman and Henry Hazlitt.\nIn their youth, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels were interested in Bentham's ideas and utilitarian philosophy. Marx later became disillusioned with Bentham's ideas, describing him as \"a genius of bourgeois stupidity\", and viewed Bentham's views as too English and \"petite bourgeoisie\", saying \"With the dullest na\u00efvet\u00e9 he takes the modern petty-bourgeois philistine, especially the English philistine, as the normal man. Whatever is useful to this queer variety of normal man, and to his world, is useful in and for itself. This yardstick, then, he applies to past, present and future.\"\nThe Faculty of Laws at University College London occupies Bentham House, next to the main UCL campus.\nBentham's name was adopted by the Australian litigation funder IMF Limited to become Bentham IMF Limited on 28 November 2013, in recognition of Bentham being \"among the first to support the utility of litigation funding\".\nDeath and the auto-icon.\nBentham died on 6 June 1832, aged 84, at his residence in Queen Square Place in Westminster, London. He had continued to write up to a month before his death, and had made careful preparations for the dissection of his body after death and its preservation as an auto-icon. As early as 1769, when Bentham was 21 years old, he made a will leaving his body for dissection to a family friend, the physician and chemist George Fordyce, whose daughter, Maria Sophia (1765\u20131858), married Jeremy's brother Samuel Bentham. A paper written in 1830, instructing Thomas Southwood Smith to create the auto-icon, was attached to his last will, dated 30 May 1832. It stated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBentham's wish to preserve his dead body was consistent with his philosophy of utilitarianism. In his essay \"Auto-Icon, or Farther Uses of the Dead to the Living\", Bentham wrote, \"If a country gentleman has rows of trees leading to his dwelling, the auto-icons of his family might alternate with the trees; copal varnish would protect the face from the effects of rain.\" On 8 June 1832, two days after his death, invitations were distributed to a select group of friends, and on the following day at 3 p.m., Southwood Smith delivered a lengthy oration over Bentham's remains in the Webb Street School of Anatomy &amp; Medicine in Southwark, London. The printed oration contains a frontispiece with an engraving of Bentham's body partly covered by a sheet.\nAfterward, the skeleton and head were preserved and stored in a wooden cabinet called the \"auto-icon\", with the skeleton padded out with hay and dressed in Bentham's clothes. From 1833, it stood in Southwood Smith's Finsbury Square consulting rooms until he abandoned private practice in the winter of 1849\u201350, when it was moved to 36 Percy Street, the studio of his unofficial partner, painter Margaret Gillies, who made studies of it. In March 1850, Southwood Smith offered the auto-icon to Henry Brougham, who readily accepted it for UCL.\nIt is currently kept on public display at the main entrance of the UCL Student Centre. It was previously displayed at the end of the South Cloisters in the main building of the college until it was moved in 2020. Upon the retirement of Sir Malcolm Grant as provost of the college in 2013, however, the body was present at Grant's final council meeting. As of 2013, this was the only time that the body of Bentham has been taken to a UCL council meeting. (There is a persistent myth that the body of Bentham is present at all council meetings noted as \"Present-but not voting\".)\nBentham had intended the auto-icon to incorporate his actual head, mummified to resemble its appearance in life. Southwood Smith's experimental efforts at mummification \u2013 based on the preservation practices of New Zealand's indigenous M\u0101ori \u2013 involved placing the head under an air pump over sulphuric acid and drawing off the fluids. Although technically successful, they left the head looking distastefully macabre, with dried and darkened skin stretched tautly over the skull.\nThe auto-icon was therefore given a wax head, fitted with some of Bentham's own hair. The real head was displayed in the same case as the auto-icon for many years, but became the target of repeated student pranks. It was later locked away.\nIn 2020, the auto-icon was put into a new glass display case and moved to the entrance of UCL's new Student Centre on Gordon Square.\nUniversity College London.\nBentham is widely associated with the foundation in 1826 of London University (the institution that, in 1836, became University College London), though he was 78 years old when the university opened and played only an indirect role in its establishment. His direct involvement was limited to his buying a single \u00a3100 share in the new university, making him just one of over a thousand shareholders.\nBentham and his ideas can nonetheless be seen as having inspired several of the actual founders of the university. He strongly believed that education should be more widely available, particularly to those who were not wealthy or who did not belong to the established church; in Bentham's time, membership of the Church of England and the capacity to bear considerable expenses were required of students entering the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge. As the University of London was the first in England to admit all, regardless of race, creed or political belief, it was largely consistent with Bentham's vision. There is some evidence that, from the sidelines, he played a \"more than passive part\" in the planning discussions for the new institution, although it is also apparent that \"his interest was greater than his influence\". He failed in his efforts to see his disciple John Bowring appointed professor of English or History, but he did oversee the appointment of another pupil, John Austin, as the first professor of Jurisprudence in 1829.\nThe more direct associations between Bentham and UCL\u2014the college's custody of his Auto-icon (see above) and of the majority of his surviving papers\u2014postdate his death by some years: the papers were donated in 1849, and the Auto-icon in 1850. A large painting by Henry Tonks hanging in UCL's Flaxman Gallery depicts Bentham approving the plans of the new university, but it was executed in 1922 and the scene is entirely imaginary. Since 1959 (when the Bentham Committee was first established), UCL has hosted the Bentham Project, which is progressively publishing a definitive edition of Bentham's writings.\nUCL now endeavours to acknowledge Bentham's influence on its foundation, while avoiding any suggestion of direct involvement, by describing him as its \"spiritual founder\".\nBibliography.\nBentham was an obsessive writer and reviser, but was only able on rare occasions of bringing his work to completion and publication. Most of what appeared in print in his lifetime was prepared for publication by others. Several of his works first appeared in French translation, prepared for the press by \u00c9tienne Dumont, for example, \"Theory of Legislation\", Volume 2 (\"Principles of the Penal Code\") 1840, Weeks, Jordan, &amp; Company. Boston. Some made their first appearance in English in the 1820s as a result of back-translation from Dumont's 1802 collection (and redaction) of Bentham's writing on civil and penal legislation.\na&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ Better scan available through https:// (subscription may be required or content may be available in libraries).\nPosthumous publications.\nOn his death, Bentham left manuscripts amounting to an estimated 30 million words, which are now largely held by University College London's Special Collections (c.\u200960,000 manuscript folios) and the British Library (c.\u200915,000 folios). University College London also holds a collection of c.500 books either by, about, or owned by Jeremy Bentham.\nBowring (1838\u20131843).\nJohn Bowring, the young radical writer who had been Bentham's intimate friend and disciple, was appointed his literary executor and charged with the task of preparing a collected edition of his works. This appeared in 11 volumes in 1838\u20131843. Bowring based much of his edition on previously published texts (including those of Dumont) rather than Bentham's own manuscripts, and elected not to publish Bentham's works on religion at all. The edition was described by the \"Edinburgh Review\" on first publication as \"incomplete, incorrect and ill-arranged\", and has since been repeatedly criticised both for its omissions and for errors of detail; while Bowring's memoir of Bentham's life included in volumes 10 and 11 was described by Sir Leslie Stephen as \"one of the worst biographies in the language\". Nevertheless, Bowring's remained the standard edition of most of Bentham's writings for over a century, and is still only partially superseded: it includes such interesting writings on international relations as Bentham's A Plan for an Universal and Perpetual Peace written 1786\u201389, which forms part IV of the Principles of International Law.\nStark (1952\u20131954).\nIn 1952\u20131954, Werner Stark published a three-volume set, \"Jeremy Bentham's Economic Writings\", in which he attempted to bring together all of Bentham's writings on economic matters, including both published and unpublished material. Although a significant achievement, the work is considered by scholars to be flawed in many points of detail, and a new edition of the economic writings (retitled \"Writings on Political Economy\") is currently in course of publication by the Bentham Project.\nBentham Project (1968\u2013present).\nIn 1959, the Bentham Committee was established under the auspices of University College London with the aim of producing a definitive edition of Bentham's writings. It set up the Bentham Project to undertake the task, and the first volume in \"The Collected Works of Jeremy Bentham\" was published in 1968. The \"Collected Works\" are providing many unpublished works, as well as much-improved texts of works already published. To date, 38 volumes have appeared; the complete edition is projected to total 80. The volume \"Of Laws in General\" (1970) was found to contain many errors and has been replaced by \"Of the Limits of the Penal Branch of Jurisprudence\" (2010) In 2017, Volumes 1\u20135 were re-published in open access by UCL Press.\nTo assist in this task, the Bentham papers at UCL are being digitised by crowdsourcing their transcription. Transcribe Bentham is a crowdsourced manuscript transcription project, run by University College London's Bentham Project, in partnership with UCL's UCL Centre for Digital Humanities, UCL Library Services, UCL Learning and Media Services, the University of London Computer Centre, and the online community. The project was launched in September 2010 and is making freely available, via a specially designed transcription interface, digital images of UCL's vast Bentham Papers collection\u2014which runs to some 60,000 manuscript folios\u2014to engage the public and recruit volunteers to help transcribe the material. Volunteer-produced transcripts will contribute to the Bentham Project's production of the new edition of \"The Collected Works of Jeremy Bentham\", and will be uploaded to UCL's digital Bentham Papers repository, widening access to the collection for all and ensuring its long-term preservation. Manuscripts can be viewed and transcribed by signing-up for a transcriber account at the Transcription Desk, via the Transcribe Bentham website.\nFree, flexible textual search of the full collection of Bentham Papers is now possible through an experimental handwritten text image indexing and search system, developed by the PRHLT research center in the framework of the READ project.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In some cases, such as those of Elena Ferrante and Torsten Krol, a pen name may preserve an author's long-term anonymity.\nEtymology.\n\"Pen name\" is formed by joining pen with name. Its earliest use in English is in the 1860s, in the writings of Bayard Taylor.\nThe French-language phrase is used as a synonym for \"pen name\" ( meaning 'pen'). However, it is not the French usage, according to H.\u00a0W. Fowler and F.\u00a0G. Fowler in \"The King's English\", but instead a \"back-translation\" from English. The French usage is \"nom de guerre\" (a more generalised term for 'pseudonym'). Since means 'war' in French, confused some English speakers, who \"corrected\" the French metaphor. This phrase precedes \"pen name\", being attested to \"The Knickerbocker\", in 1841.\nWestern literature.\nEurope and the United States.\nAn author may use a pen name if their real name is likely to be confused with that of another author or other significant individual. For instance, in 1899 the British politician Winston Churchill wrote under the name Winston S. Churchill to distinguish his writings from those of the American novelist of the same name.\nAn author may use a pen name implying a rank or title which they have never actually held. William Earl Johns wrote under the name \"Capt. W. E. Johns\" although the highest army rank he held was acting lieutenant and his highest air force rank was flying officer.\nAuthors who regularly write in more than one genre may use different pen names for each, either in an attempt to conceal their true identity or even after their identity is known. Romance writer Nora Roberts writes erotic thrillers under the pen name J. D. Robb (such books were originally listed as by \"J. D. Robb\" and are now titled \"Nora Roberts writing as J. D. Robb\"); Scots writer Iain Banks wrote mainstream or literary fiction under his own name and science fiction under Iain M. Banks; Samuel Langhorne Clemens used the aliases Mark Twain and Sieur Louis de Conte for different works. Similarly, an author who writes both fiction and non-fiction (such as the mathematician and fantasy writer Charles Dodgson, who wrote as Lewis Carroll) may use a pseudonym for fiction writing. Science fiction author Harry Turtledove has used the name H. N. Turtletaub for some historical novels he has written because he and his publisher felt that the presumed lower sales of those novels might hurt bookstore orders for the novels he writes under his name.\nEven within the same genre, authors may use a pen name if their better-known name may lead potential readers to misunderstand the nature of the book. In children's picture books, Dr. Seuss \u2014 itself a whimsical pen name for Theodor Geisel originating when he was banned from illustrating for his college humor magazine due to illegal drinking \u2014 used the name \"Theo. LeSieg,\" \"LeSieg\" being \"Geisel\" spelled backward, on books he wrote but did not illustrate. Geisel's bestselling books had become associated with a very recognizable art style, which the LeSieg books lacked. Later in his career, Geisel did publish two books illustrated by others under his primary pen name, and following his death the LeSieg books have been reissued as by Dr. Seuss, \"writing as Theo. LeSieg.\"\nOccasionally, a pen name is employed to avoid overexposure. Prolific authors for pulp magazines often had two and sometimes three short stories appearing in one issue of a magazine; the editor would create several fictitious author names to hide this from readers. Robert A. Heinlein wrote stories under the pseudonyms of Anson MacDonald (a combination of his middle name and his then-wife's maiden name) and Caleb Strong so that more of his works could be published in a single magazine. Stephen King published four novels under the name Richard Bachman because publishers did not feel the public would buy more than one novel per year from a single author. Eventually, after critics found a large number of style similarities, publishers revealed Bachman's true identity.\nSometimes a pen name is used because an author believes that their name does not suit the genre they are writing in. Western novelist Pearl Gray dropped his first name and changed the spelling of his last name to Zane Grey because he believed that his real name did not suit the Western genre. Romance novelist Angela Knight writes under that name instead of her actual name (Julie Woodcock) because of the double entendre of her surname in the context of that genre. Romain Gary, who was a well-known French writer, decided in 1973 to write novels in a different style under the name \u00c9mile Ajar and even asked his cousin's son to impersonate Ajar; thus he received the most prestigious French literary prize twice, which is forbidden by the prize rules. He revealed the affair in a book he sent his editor just before committing suicide in 1980.\nA pen name may be shared by different writers to suggest continuity of authorship. Thus the \"Bessie Bunter\" series of English boarding school stories, initially written by the prolific Charles Hamilton under the name Hilda Richards, was taken on by other authors who continued to use the same pen name.\nIn some forms of fiction, the pen name adopted is the name of the lead character, to suggest to the reader that the book is an autobiography of a real person. Daniel Handler used the pseudonym Lemony Snicket to present his \"A Series of Unfortunate Events\" books as memoirs by an acquaintance of the main characters. Some, however, do this to fit a certain theme. One example, Pseudonymous Bosch, used his pen name just to expand the theme of secrecy in \"The Secret Series\".\nAuthors may occasionally choose pen names to appear in more favorable positions in bookshops or libraries, to maximize visibility when placed on shelves that are conventionally arranged alphabetically moving horizontally, then upwards vertically.\nFemale authors.\nSome female authors have used pen names to ensure that their works were accepted by publishers and/or the public. Such is the case of Peru's Clarinda, whose work was published in the early 17th century. More often, women have adopted masculine pen names. This was common in the 19th century when women were beginning to make inroads into literature but it was felt they would not be taken as seriously by readers as male authors. For example, Mary Ann Evans wrote under the pen name George Eliot; and Amandine Aurore Lucile Dupin, and Baronne Dudevant, used the pseudonym George Sand. Charlotte, Emily, and Anne Bront\u00eb published under the names Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell, respectively. French-Savoyard writer and poet Am\u00e9lie Gex published as Dian de Je\u00e2nna (\"John, son of Jane\") during the first half of her career. Karen Blixen's very successful \"Out of Africa\" (1937) was originally published under the pen name Isak Dinesen. Victoria Benedictsson, a Swedish author of the 19th century, wrote under the name Ernst Ahlgren. The science fiction author Alice B. Sheldon for many years published under the masculine name of James Tiptree, Jr., the discovery of which led to a deep discussion of gender in the genre.\nMore recently, women who write in genres commonly written by men sometimes use initials, such as K. A. Applegate, C. J. Cherryh, P. N. Elrod, D. C. Fontana, S. E. Hinton, G. A. Riplinger, J. D. Robb, and J. K. Rowling, who also writes the \"Cormoran Strike\" series of crime fiction novels under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith. Alternatively, they may use a unisex pen name, such as Robin Hobb (the second pen name of novelist Margaret Astrid Lindholm Ogden).\nCollective names.\nA collective name, also known as a house name, is one pen name for works published by the same publishing house even though more than one author may have contributed to the series. Novellas and paperback books credited to Maxwell Grant, featuring the adventures of The Shadow, were written largely by Walter B. Gibson but other writers contributed to the series. The erotic-adventures Slocum series of westerns were all credited to Jake Logan, but many different authors wrote the books. \nIn some cases, the first books in a series were written by one writer but subsequent books were written by ghostwriters. For instance, Leslie Charteris wrote the early volumes of \"The Saint\" adventure series, but he supervised and edited the works of ghostwriters for the remainder of the series. Similarly, \"Nancy Drew\" mystery books are published as though they were written by Carolyn Keene, \"The Hardy Boys\" books are published as the work of Franklin W. Dixon, and \"The Bobbsey Twins\" series are credited to Laura Lee Hope, although numerous authors have been involved in each series. Erin Hunter, the author of the \"Warriors\" novel series, is a collective pen name used by authors Kate Cary, Cherith Baldry, Tui T. Sutherland, and the editor Victoria Holmes.\nCollaborative authors may also have their works published under a single pen name. Frederic Dannay and Manfred B. Lee published their mystery novels and stories under the pen name Ellery Queen, which was also used to publish the work of several ghostwriters they commissioned. The writers of \"Atlanta Nights\", a deliberately bad book intended to embarrass the publishing firm PublishAmerica, used the pen name Travis Tea. Additionally, the credited author of \"The Expanse\", James S. A. Corey, is an amalgam of the middle names of collaborating writers Daniel Abraham and Ty Franck respectively, while S. A. is the initials of Abraham's daughter. Sometimes multiple authors will write related books under the same pseudonym; examples include T. H. Lain in fiction. The Australian fiction collaborators who write under the pen name Alice Campion are a group of women who have so far written \"The Painted Sky\" (2015) and \"The Shifting Light\" (2017).\nIn the 1780s, \"The Federalist Papers\" were written under the pseudonym \"Publius\" by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay. The three men chose the name \"Publius\" because it recalled the founder of the Roman Republic and using it implied a positive intention.\nIn pure mathematics, Nicolas Bourbaki is the pseudonym of a group of mostly French-connected mathematicians attempting to expose the field in an axiomatic and self-contained, encyclopedic form.\nConcealment of identity.\nA pseudonym may be used to protect the writer of expos\u00e9 books about espionage or crime. Former SAS soldier Steven Billy Mitchell used the pseudonym Andy McNab for his book about a failed SAS mission titled \"Bravo Two Zero\". The name Ibn Warraq (\"son of a papermaker\") has been used by dissident Muslim authors. Author Brian O'Nolan used the pen names Flann O'Brien and Myles na gCopaleen for his novels and journalistic writing from the 1940s to the 1960s because Irish civil servants were not permitted at that time to publish political writings. The identity of the enigmatic twentieth-century novelist B. Traven has never been conclusively revealed, despite thorough research.\nA multiple-use name or anonymity pseudonym is a pseudonym open for anyone to use and these have been adopted by various groups, often as a protest against the cult of individual creators. In Italy, two anonymous groups of writers have gained some popularity with the collective names of Luther Blissett and Wu Ming.\nEastern literature.\nHong Kong.\nWuxia novelist Louis Cha uses the pen name Gum Yoong (\u91d1\u5eb8) by taking apart the components of the Chinese character in his given name (\u93de) from his birth name \"Cha Leung-yung\" (\u67e5\u826f\u93de).\nIndia.\nIn Indian languages, writers may put a pen name at the end of their names, like Ramdhari Singh Dinkar. Some writers, like Firaq Gorakhpuri, wrote only under a pen name.\nIn early Indian literature, authors considered the use of names egotistical. Because names were avoided, it is difficult to trace the authorship of many earlier literary works from India. Later writers adopted the practice of using the name of their deity of worship or Guru's name as their pen name. In this case, typically the pen name would be included at the end of the prose or poetry.\nComposers of Indian classical music used pen names in compositions to assert authorship, including Sadarang, Gunarang (Fayyaz Ahmed Khan), Ada Rang (court musician of Muhammad Shah), Sabrang (Bade Ghulam Ali Khan), and Ramrang (Ramashreya Jha). Other compositions are apocryphally ascribed to composers with their pen names.\nJapan.\nJapanese poets who write haiku often use a \"haig\u014d\" (\u4ff3\u53f7). The haiku poet Matsuo Bash\u014d had used two other haig\u014d before he became fond of a banana plant (\"bash\u014d\") that had been given to him by a disciple and started using it as his pen name at the age of 36.\nSimilar to a pen name, Japanese artists usually have a \"g\u014d\" or art-name, which might change a number of times during their career. In some cases, artists adopted different \"g\u014d\" at different stages of their career, usually to mark significant changes in their life. One of the most extreme examples of this is Hokusai, who in the period 1798 to 1806 alone used no fewer than six. Manga artist Ogure Ito uses the pen name Oh! great because his real name Ogure Ito is roughly how the Japanese pronounce \"oh great\".\n\"Note: List of Urdu language poets provides pen names for a range of Urdu poets.\"\nPersian and Urdu poetry.\nA \"sh\u00e2'er\" (Persian from Arabic, for poet) (a poet who writes \"she'rs\" in Urdu or Persian) almost always has a \"takhallus\", a pen name, traditionally placed at the end of the name (often marked by a graphical sign placed above it) when referring to the poet by his full name. For example, Hafez is a pen name for \"Shams al-Din\", and thus the usual way to refer to him would be \"Shams al-Din Hafez\" or just \"Hafez\". \"Mirza Asadullah Baig Khan\" (his official name and title) is referred to as \"Mirza Asadullah Khan Ghalib\", or just \"Mirza Ghalib\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Emerging in the 18th century, political economy is regarded as the precursor to the modern discipline of economics. \nIn its modern form, political economy is an interdisciplinary field that integrates insights from political science and contemporary economics to study the interaction between politics and markets.\nPolitical economy originated within 16th century western moral philosophy, with theoretical works exploring the administration of states' wealth \u2013 \"political\" referring to \"polity\", and \"economy\" derived from Greek \"household management\". The earliest works of political economy are usually attributed to the British scholars Adam Smith, Thomas Malthus, and David Ricardo, although they were preceded by the work of the French physiocrats, such as Fran\u00e7ois Quesnay, Richard Cantillon and Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot. Varied thinkers Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill, and Karl Marx saw economics and politics as inseparable. \nIn the late 19th century, the term \"economics\" gradually began to replace the term \"political economy\" with the rise of mathematical modeling coinciding with the publication of the influential textbook \"Principles of Economics\" by Alfred Marshall in 1890. Earlier, William Stanley Jevons, a proponent of mathematical methods applied to the subject, advocated \"economics\" for brevity and with the hope of the term becoming \"the recognised name of a science\". Citation measurement metrics from Google Ngram Viewer indicate that use of the term \"economics\" began to overshadow \"political economy\" around roughly 1910, becoming the preferred term for the discipline by 1920. Today, the term \"economics\" usually refers to the narrow study of the economy absent other political and social considerations while the term \"political economy\" represents a distinct and competing approach.\nEtymology.\nOriginally, political economy meant the study of the conditions under which production or consumption within limited parameters was organized in nation-states. In that way, political economy expanded the emphasis on economics, which comes from the Greek \"oikos\" (meaning \"home\") and \"nomos\" (meaning \"law\" or \"order\"). Political economy was thus meant to express the laws of production of wealth at the state level, quite like economics concerns putting home to order. The phrase \"\u00e9conomie politique\" (translated in English to \"political economy\") first appeared in France in 1615 with the well-known book by Antoine de Montchr\u00e9tien, \"Trait\u00e9 de l'economie politique\". Other contemporary scholars attribute the roots of this study to the 13th Century Tunisian Arab Historian and Sociologist, Ibn Khaldun, for his work on making the distinction between \"profit\" and \"sustenance\", in modern political economy terms, surplus and that required for the reproduction of classes respectively. He also calls for the creation of a science to explain society and goes on to outline these ideas in his major work, the \"Muqaddimah\". In Al-Muqaddimah Khaldun states, \"Civilization and its well-being, as well as business prosperity, depend on productivity and people's efforts in all directions in their own interest and profit\" \u2013 seen as a modern precursor to Classical Economic thought.\nLeading on from this, the French physiocrats were the first major exponents of political economy, although the intellectual responses of Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill, David Ricardo, Henry George and Karl Marx to the physiocrats generally receive much greater attention. The world's first professorship in political economy was established in 1754 at the University of Naples Federico II in southern Italy. The Neapolitan philosopher Antonio Genovesi was the first tenured professor. In 1763, Joseph von Sonnenfels was appointed a Political Economy chair at the University of Vienna, Austria. Thomas Malthus, in 1805, became England's first professor of political economy, at the East India Company College, Haileybury, Hertfordshire. At present, political economy refers to different yet related approaches to studying economic and related behaviours, ranging from the combination of economics with other fields to the use of different, fundamental assumptions challenging earlier economic assumptions.\nApproaches.\nPolitical economy most commonly refers to interdisciplinary studies drawing upon economics, sociology and political science in explaining how political institutions, the political environment, and the economic system\u2014capitalist, socialist, communist, or mixed\u2014influence each other. The \"Journal of Economic Literature\" classification codes associate political economy with three sub-areas: (1) the role of government and/or class and power relationships in resource allocation for each type of economic system; (2) international political economy, which studies the economic impacts of international relations; and (3) economic models of political or exploitative class processes. Within political science, a general distinction is made between international political economy typically examined by scholars of international relations and comparative political economy, which is primarily studied by scholars of comparative politics.\nSocial choice theory studies how utilities of individuals combine across society, also called the social welfare function, depending on political structure. Public choice theory is a microfoundations theory closely intertwined with political economy.\nBoth approaches model voters, politicians and bureaucrats as behaving in mainly self-interested ways. Economists and political scientists often associate political economy with approaches using rational-choice assumptions, especially in game theory and in examining phenomena beyond economics' standard remit, such as government failure and complex decision making in which context the term \"positive political economy\" is common. Other \"traditional\" topics include analysis of such public policy issues as economic regulation, monopoly, rent-seeking, market protection, institutional corruption and distributional politics. Empirical analysis includes the influence of elections on the choice of economic policy, determinants and forecasting models of electoral outcomes, the political business cycles, central-bank independence and the politics of excessive deficits. An interesting example would be the publication in 1954 of the first manual of Political Economy in the Soviet Union, edited by Lev Gatovsky, which mixed the classic theoretical approach of the time with the soviet political discourse.\nA rather recent focus has been put on modeling economic policy and political institutions concerning interactions between agents and economic and political institutions, including the seeming discrepancy of economic policy and economist's recommendations through the lens of transaction costs. From the mid-1990s, the field has expanded, in part aided by new cross-national data sets allowing tests of hypotheses on comparative economic systems and institutions. Topics have included the breakup of nations, the origins and rate of change of political institutions in relation to economic growth, development, financial markets and regulation, the importance of institutions, backwardness, reform and transition economies, the role of culture, ethnicity and gender in explaining economic outcomes, macroeconomic policy, the environment, fairness and the relation of constitutions to economic policy, theoretical and empirical.\nOther important landmarks in the development of political economy include:\nRelated disciplines.\nBecause political economy is not a unified discipline, there are studies using the term that overlap in subject matter, but have radically different perspectives:\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "46046", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46046", "title": "Psychedelia", "text": "1960s subculture related to the use of psychedelics\nPsychedelia usually refers to a style or aesthetic that is resembled in the psychedelic subculture of the 1960s and the psychedelic experience produced by certain psychoactive substances. This includes psychedelic art, psychedelic music and style of dress during that era. This was primarily generated by people who used psychedelic drugs such as LSD, mescaline (found in peyote) and psilocybin (found in magic mushrooms) and also non-users who were participants and aficionados of this subculture. Psychedelic art and music typically recreate or reflect the experience of altered consciousness. Psychedelic art uses highly distorted, surreal visuals, bright colors and full spectrums and animation (including cartoons) to evoke, convey, or enhance the psychedelic experience.\nPsychedelic music uses distorted electric guitar, Indian music elements such as the sitar and tabla, electronic effects, sound effects and reverb, and elaborate studio effects, such as playing tapes backwards or panning the music from one side to another.\nA psychedelic experience is characterized by the striking perception of aspects of one's mind previously unknown, or by the creative exuberance of the mind liberated from its ostensibly ordinary fetters. Psychedelic states are an array of experiences including changes of perception such as hallucinations, synesthesia, altered states of awareness or focused consciousness, variation in thought patterns, trance or hypnotic states, mystical states, and other mind alterations.\nThese processes can lead some people to experience changes in mental operation defining their self-identity (whether in momentary acuity or chronic development) different enough from their previous normal state that it can excite feelings of newly formed understanding such as revelation, illumination, confusion, and psychosis. Individuals who use psychedelic drugs for spiritual purposes or self-discovery are commonly referred to as \"psychonauts\".\nEtymology.\nThe term was first coined as a noun in 1956 by psychiatrist Humphry Osmond as an alternative descriptor for hallucinogenic drugs in the context of psychedelic psychotherapy. It is irregularly derived from the Greek words \u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u03ae \"psych\u1e17\" 'soul, mind' and \u03b4\u03b7\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03bd \"d\u0113le\u00edn\" 'to manifest', with the meaning \"mind manifesting,\" the implication being that psychedelics can develop unused potentials of the human mind. The term was loathed by American ethnobotanist Richard Schultes but championed by American psychologist Timothy Leary.\nSeeking a name for the experience induced by LSD, Osmond contacted Aldous Huxley, a personal acquaintance and advocate for the therapeutic use of the substance. Huxley coined the term \"phanerothyme,\" from the Greek terms for \"manifest\" (\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03b5\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2) and \"spirit\" (\u03b8\u03cd\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2). In a letter to Osmond, he wrote: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;To make this mundane world sublime,\nTake half a gram of phanerothyme\nTo which Osmond responded:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;To fathom Hell or soar angelic,\nJust take a pinch of psychedelic\nIt was on this term that Osmond eventually settled, because it was \"clear, euphonious and uncontaminated by other associations.\" This mongrel spelling of the word 'psychedelic' was loathed by American ethnobotanist Richard Evans Schultes, but championed by Timothy Leary, who thought it sounded better. Due to the expanded use of the term \"psychedelic\" in pop culture and a perceived incorrect verbal formulation, Carl A.P. Ruck, Jeremy Bigwood, Danny Staples, Jonathan Ott, and R. Gordon Wasson proposed the term \"entheogen\" to describe the religious or spiritual experience produced by such substances.\nHistory.\nFrom the second half of the 1950s, Beat Generation writers like William Burroughs, Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg wrote about and took drugs, including cannabis and Benzedrine, raising awareness and helping to popularise their use. In the same period Lysergic acid diethylamide, better known as LSD, or \"acid\" (at the time a legal drug), began to be used in the US and UK as an experimental treatment, initially promoted as a potential cure for mental illness.\nIn the early 1960s, the use of LSD and other hallucinogens was advocated by proponents of the new \"consciousness expansion\", such as Timothy Leary, Alan Watts, Aldous Huxley and Arthur Koestler, their writings profoundly influenced the thinking of the new generation of youth. There had long been a culture of drug use among jazz and blues musicians, and use of drugs (including cannabis, peyote, mescaline and LSD) had begun to grow among folk and rock musicians, who also began to include drug references in their songs. In the UK rock scene, some notable users were groups such as the Rolling Stones, the Beatles and the Moody Blues.\nBy the mid-1960s, the psychedelic life-style had already developed in California, and an entire subculture developed. This was particularly true in San Francisco, due in part to the first major underground LSD factory, established there by Owsley Stanley. There was also an emerging music scene of folk clubs, coffee houses and independent radio stations catering to a population of students at nearby Berkeley, and to free thinkers that had gravitated to the city.\nFrom 1964, the Merry Pranksters, a loose group that developed around novelist Ken Kesey, sponsored the Acid Tests, a series of events based around the taking of LSD (supplied by Stanley), accompanied by light shows, film projection and discordant, improvised music known as the \"psychedelic symphony\". The Pranksters helped popularize LSD use through their road trips across America in a psychedelically decorated school bus, which involved distributing the drug and meeting with major figures of the beat movement, and through publications about their activities such as Tom Wolfe's \"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test\" (1968).\nLeary was a well-known proponent of the use of psychedelics, as was Aldous Huxley. However, both advanced widely different opinions on the broad use of psychedelics by state and civil society. Leary promulgated the idea of such substances as a panacea, while Huxley suggested that only the cultural and intellectual elite should partake of entheogens systematically.\nIn the 1960s, the use of psychedelic drugs became widespread in modern Western culture, particularly in the United States and Britain. The movement is credited to Michael Hollingshead who arrived in America from London in 1965. He was sent to the U.S. by other members of the psychedelic movement to get their ideas exposure. The Summer of Love of 1967 and the resultant popularization of the hippie culture to the mainstream popularized psychedelia in the minds of popular culture, where it remained dominant through the 1970s.\nModern usage.\nThe impact of psychedelic drugs on western culture in the 1960s led to semantic drift in the use of the word \"psychedelic\", and it is now frequently used to describe anything with abstract decoration of multiple bright colours, similar to those seen in drug-induced hallucinations. In objection to this new meaning, and to what some consider pejorative meanings of other synonyms such as \"hallucinogen\" and \"psychotomimetic\", the term \"entheogen\" was proposed and is seeing increasing use. However, some consider the term \"entheogen\" best reserved for religious and spiritual usage, such as certain Native American churches do with the peyote sacrament, and \"psychedelic\" left to describe those who are using these drugs for recreation, psychotherapy, physical healing, or creative problem solving. In science, hallucinogen remains the standard term.\nVisual art.\nAdvances in printing and photographic technology in the 1960s saw the traditional lithography printing techniques rapidly superseded by the offset printing system. This and other technical and industrial innovations gave young artists access to exciting new graphic techniques and media, including photographic and mixed media collage, metallic foils, and vivid new fluorescent \"DayGlo\" inks. This enabled them to explore innovative new illustrative styles including highly distorted visuals, cartoons, and lurid colors and full spectrums to evoke a sense of altered consciousness; a number of works also featured idiosyncratic and complex new fonts and lettering styles (most notably in the work of San Francisco-based poster artist Rick Griffin). A number of artists in the late 1960s and early 1970s attempted to illustrate the psychedelic experience in paintings, drawings, illustrations, and other forms of graphic design.\nThe counterculture music scene frequently used psychedelic designs on posters during the Summer of Love, leading to a popularization of the style. The most productive and influential centre of psychedelic art in the late 1960s was San Francisco; a scene driven in large measure by the patronage of the popular local music venues of the day like the Avalon Ballroom and Bill Graham's Fillmore West, which regularly commissioned young local artists like Robert Crumb, Stanley Mouse, Rick Griffin and others. They produced a wealth of distinctive psychedelic promotional posters and handbills for concerts that featured emerging psychedelic bands like Big Brother and the Holding Company, The Grateful Dead and Jefferson Airplane. A number of these works are now regarded as classics of the poster genre, and original items by these artists command high prices on the collector market today.\nContemporary with the burgeoning San Francisco scene, a smaller but equally creative psychedelic art movement emerged in London, led by expatriate Australian pop artist Martin Sharp, who created multiple psychedelic posters and illustrations for the influential underground publication Oz magazine, as well as the famous album covers for the Cream albums \"Disraeli Gears\" and \"Wheels of Fire\".\nOther prominent London practitioners of the style included: design duo Hapshash and the Coloured Coat, whose work included multiple famous posters, as well as psychedelic \"makeovers\" on a piano for Paul McCartney and a car for doomed Guinness heir Tara Browne, and design collective The Fool, who created clothes and album art for several leading UK bands including The Beatles, Cream, and The Move. The Beatles loved psychedelic designs on their albums, and designer group called The Fool created psychedelic design, art, paint at the short-lived Apple Boutique (1967\u20131968) in Baker St, London.\nBlues rock singer Janis Joplin had a psychedelic car, a Porsche 356. The trend also extended to motor vehicles. The earliest, and perhaps most famous of all psychedelic vehicles was the famous \"Further\" bus, driven by Ken Kesey and The Merry Pranksters, which was painted inside and out in 1964 with bold psychedelic designs (although these were executed in primary colours, since the DayGlo colours that soon became \"de rigueur\" were then not widely available). Another famous example is John Lennon's psychedelic Rolls-Royce \u2013 originally black, he had it repainted in 1967 in a vivid psychedelic gypsy caravan style, prompting bandmate George Harrison to have his Mini Cooper similarly repainted with logos and devices that reflected his burgeoning interest in Indian spirituality.\nPsychedelia design.\nThe Psychedelia movement in the 1960s had a large impact on graphic design and architecture during the movement. During this time period, it was all about taking creative risks. This movement was experimental and colorful. There was a political unrest because of Black and Indigenous groups trying to get their rights. With African Americans, it was the civil rights movement. Michael Parke-Taylor includes Native Americans in the conversation. For Indigenous or Native Americans, they \"represented the perfect symbol of those marginalized and persecuted in contemporary American society.\"\nGraphic design during this era was playful and colorful. This was because of the drug known as LSD. The Hippies took over the psychedelic designs. Jeffrey Meikle understood what the Hippies wanted to create. He knew that the \"Hippie artists energized American visual culture with rock concert posters, record jackets, extravagant, and underground newspapers.\" Milton Glaser has a poster design of Bob Dylan. The poster is colorful and playful. Glaser wanted to get away from the black and white designs of posters and trade that in for a more experimental design. These designs were usually hand painted and printed. The typography was the same as the poster which was playful and colorful. Juliana Duque mentions the typography was \"organic patterns, kaleidoscopic textures, and waving (nearly encrypted) lettering combined with intense colors.\"\nThere were a few architecture designs that came out during this period. The graphic design elements on buses were just as colorful as the posters. They employed psychedelic elements to craft immersive environments and foster an interactive space. Luke Dickens explores the overlooked architecture in the 1960s. He mentions The Fifth Dimension as being \"highly inventive, utopian \u201cfun palace\u201d used advanced modular technologies... and deployed psychedelic sensibilities as a novel form of disruptive politics to induce critical dispositions towards the built environment.\" The theme of bright colors was evident in this fiber glass domed-shaped building. This building was meant to trigger psychedelic responses. Similar to The Fifth Dimension, there was a geodesic dome and a dymaxion car made by Buckminster Fuller. The geodesic dome was complex. Meikle explained that Fuller followed the psychedelia era by wanting to speak \"to a counterculture claiming to reject American Materialism.\"\nMusic.\nThe fashion for psychedelic drugs gave its name to the style of psychedelia, a term describing a category of rock music known as psychedelic rock, as well as visual art, fashion, and culture that is associated originally with the high 1960s, hippies, and the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood of San Francisco, California. It often used new recording techniques and effects while drawing on Eastern sources such as the ragas and drones of Indian music.\nOne of the first uses of the word in the music scene of this time was in the 1964 recording of \"Hesitation Blues\" by folk group the Holy Modal Rounders. The term was introduced to rock music and popularized by the 13th Floor Elevators 1966 album \"The Psychedelic Sounds of the 13th Floor Elevators\". Psychedelia truly took off in 1967 with the Summer of Love and, although associated with San Francisco, the style soon spread across the US, and worldwide.\nThe electronic dance music scene is strongly linked to the consumption of psychedelic drugs, particularly MDMA. Drug usage in the EDM scene can primarily be traced to British acid house parties and the Second Summer of Love, which marked the beginnings of rave culture; these movements, however, were distinct from and mostly unrelated to 1960s psychedelia.\nFestivals.\nA psychedelic festival is a gathering that promotes psychedelic music and art in an effort to unite participants in a communal psychedelic experience. Psychedelic festivals have been described as \"temporary communities reproduced via personal and collective acts of transgression... through the routine expenditure of excess energy, and through self-sacrifice in acts of abandonment involving ecstatic dancing often fueled by chemical cocktails.\" These festivals often emphasize the ideals of peace, love, unity, and respect. Notable psychedelic festivals include the biennial Boom Festival in Portugal, Ozora Festival in Hungary, Universo Paralello in Brazil as well as Nevada's Burning Man and California's Symbiosis Gathering in the United States.\nConferences.\nIn recent years there has been a resurgence in interest in psychedelic research and a growing number of conferences now take place across the globe. The psychedelic research charity Breaking Convention have hosted one of the world's largest since 2011. A biennial conference in London, UK, Breaking Convention: a multidisciplinary conference on psychedelic consciousness is a multidisciplinary conference on psychedelic consciousness. In the US MAPS held their first Psychedelic Science conference, devoted specifically to research of psychedelics in scientific and medical fields, in 2013. In Australia, Entheogenesis Australis has been hosting the world's longest ongoing conferences around psychedelics and ethnobotany since 2004.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was also known as Aristus and is venerated as a saint in the Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox Church, and Oriental Orthodoxy. It is likely that John the Apostle died during his reign period, marking the end of the Apostolic Age.\nBiography.\nAccording to the \"Liber Pontificalis\", he was a Greek by birth, fathered by a Greek Jew named Judah from the city of Bethlehem. Eusebius, in his \"Ecclesiastical History\", states that Evaristus took office in the 3rd year of Trajan's reign, which correspond to AD 99/100, and died in the 12th year of the same reign (AD 108/109) after holding the office for nine years. He divided titles among the priests in the city of Rome, and ordained seven deacons to assist with the bishop's preaching.\nAccording to the Rev. John F. Sullivan, Evaristus decreed that \u201cin accordance with Apostolic tradition marriage should be celebrated publicly and with the blessing of the priest\u201d. Liber Pontificalis further describes him as the one \"crowned with martyrdom\". The same is indicated also by French historian Alexis-Fran\u00e7ois Artaud de Montor. However, in the Roman Martyrology he is listed without the martyr title, with a feast day on 26 October.\nPope Evaristus is buried near the body of Saint Peter in the Vatican, in Saint Peter's tomb under Saint Peter's Basilica.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The expression probably was first used in plumbing in referring to tests for the detection of cracks, leaks or breaks in closed systems of pipes.\nPre-dating the term itself, smoke tests were performed to detect leaks in wooden sailing vessels at least as early as 1836. After making a slow fire in the bottom of the hold, Richard Henry Dana writes, \"Wherever smoke was seen coming out we calked and pasted and, so far as we could, make the ship smoke tight.\"\nHistory of the term.\nThe plumbing industry started using the smoke test in 1875.\nSmoke testing in various industries.\nPlumbing.\nIn plumbing a smoke test forces non-toxic, artificially created smoke through waste and drain pipes under a slight pressure to find leaks. Plumes of smoke form where there are defects. This test can be performed when the plumbing is brand new, but more often it is used to find sewer gas leaks that may plague a building or an area. Any sign of smoke escaping can be considered a possible site for sewer gas to escape. Sewer gas typically has a rotten egg smell and can contain methane gas, which is explosive, or hydrogen sulfide gas, which is deadly.\nPlumbing smoke tests are also used to find places where pipes will spill fluid, and to check sanitary sewer systems for places where ground water and storm runoff can enter. Smoke testing is particularly useful in places such as ventilated sanitary sewer systems, where completely sealing the system is not practical.\nWhen smoke testing a sanitary sewer system it is helpful to partially block off the section of sewer to be tested. This can be done by using a sand bag on the end of a rope. The sand bag is lowered into the manhole and swung into position to partially block lines. Completely blocking the line can cause water to back up and prevent smoke from escaping through defects. Smoke testing may not be done after rain or when ground water is unusually high as this may also prevent detection of defects.\nLarge downdraft fans, usually powered by gasoline engines, are placed on top of open manholes at either end of the section to be tested. If possible all lines in the manholes except for the line between the manholes are partially blocked. Smoke is created using either a smoke bomb or liquid smoke. Smoke bombs are lit and placed on a grate or in a holder on top of each fan, while liquid smoke is injected into the fan via a heating chamber. The fans create a pressure differential that forces the smoke into the sewer at a pressure just above atmospheric. With properly installed plumbing, the traps will prevent the smoke from entering the house and redirect it out the plumbing vents. Defective plumbing systems or dry traps will allow smoke to enter the inside of the house.\nThe area around the section being tested is searched for smoke plumes. Plumes coming from plumbing vents or the interface between the fan shroud and manhole rim are normal; however, smoke plumes outside of the manhole rim are not. Plumes are marked, usually with flags, and defects are noted using measurements from stationary landmarks like the corners of houses. The plumes or markers may also be photographed.\nWoodwind instrument repair.\nIn woodwind instrument repair, a smoke test involved plugging one end of an instrument and blowing tobacco smoke from the tester's mouth into the other to test for leaks. Escaping smoke revealed improperly seated pads and faulty joints (i.e. leaks). After this test the instrument was cleaned to remove nicotine and other deposits left by the smoke.\nDescribed in a repair manual written in the 1930s, smoke testing is considered obsolete, and is no longer used by reputable technicians. The usual alternative to smoke is to place a bright light inside the instrument then check for light appearing around pads and joints.\nAutomotive repair.\nIn the same way that plumbing and woodwind instruments are tested, the vacuum systems of automobiles may be tested in order to locate difficult-to-find vacuum leaks. Artificial smoke is deliberately introduced into the system under slight pressure and any leaks are indicated by the escaping smoke. Smoke can also be used to locate difficult-to-find leaks in the fuel evaporative emissions control (EVAP) system.\nInfectious disease control.\nIn infectious disease control a smoke test is done to see whether a room is under negative pressure. A tube containing smoke is held near the bottom of the negative pressure room door, about two inches in front of the door. The smoke tube is held parallel to the door, and a small amount of smoke is then generated by gently squeezing the bulb. Care is taken to release the smoke from the tube slowly to ensure the velocity of the smoke from the tube does not overpower the air velocity. If the room is at negative pressure, the smoke will travel under the door and into the room. If the room is not at negative pressure, the smoke will be blown outward or will stay stationary.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In 1964, he was the first black actor and first Bahamian to win the Academy Award for Best Actor. Among his other accolades are two competitive Golden Globe Awards, a BAFTA Award and a Grammy Award, in addition to nominations for two Emmy Awards and a Tony Award. In 1999, he was ranked number 22 among the \"American Film Institute's 100 Stars\". Poitier was one of the last surviving stars from the Golden Age of Hollywood.\nPoitier's family lived in the Bahamas, then still a Crown colony, but he was born in Miami, Florida, while they were visiting, which granted him U.S. citizenship. He grew up in the Bahamas, but moved to Miami at age 15, and to New York City when he was 16. He joined the American Negro Theatre, gaining his breakthrough film role as a high school student in the film \"Blackboard Jungle\" (1955). Poitier gained fame for his leading roles in films such as \"The Defiant Ones\" (1958), for which he won the Silver Bear for Best Actor and became the first African American to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor. In 1964, he won the Academy Award and the Golden Globe for Best Actor for \"Lilies of the Field\" (1963).\nPoitier broke ground playing strong leading African American male roles in films such as \"Porgy and Bess\" (1959), \"A Raisin in the Sun\" (1961), and \"A Patch of Blue\" (1965). He acted in three films in 1967, films which addressed race and race relations: \"To Sir, with Love\"; \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\", and \"In the Heat of the Night\", the latter of which earned him Golden Globe and BAFTA Award nominations. In a poll the next year he was voted the US's top box-office star. Poitier made his directorial film debut with \"Buck and the Preacher\" (1972), followed by \"A Warm December\" (1973), \"Uptown Saturday Night\" (1974), and \"Stir Crazy\" (1980). He later starred in \"Shoot to Kill\" (1988) and \"Sneakers\" (1992).\nPoitier was granted an honorary knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II in 1974. His honors include the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award in 1982, the Kennedy Center Honor in 1995, Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award in 1999, and the Honorary Academy Award in 2002. In 2009, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama. In 2016, he was awarded the BAFTA Fellowship for outstanding lifetime achievement in film. From 1997 to 2007, he was the Bahamian Ambassador to Japan.\nEarly life.\nSidney Poitier was born on February 20, 1927, in Miami, Florida. He was the youngest of seven children born to Evelyn (n\u00e9e\u00a0Outten) and Reginald James Poitier, Afro-Bahamian farmers who owned a farm on Cat Island. The family would travel to Miami to sell tomatoes and other produce to wholesalers. His father also worked as a cab driver in Nassau. Poitier was born unexpectedly in Miami while his parents were there on business; his birth was two months premature, and he was not expected to survive, but his parents remained in Miami for three months to nurse him to health. Poitier grew up in the Bahamas, then a British Crown colony. His birth in the United States entitled him to US citizenship.\nAlthough there were few Poitiers of French ancestry in the Bahamas, some believe that the Poitier ancestors had migrated from Haiti, and were probably among the runaway slaves who established maroon communities throughout the Bahamas, including Cat Island.\nPoitier lived with his family on Cat Island until he was ten, when they moved to Nassau. There he was exposed to the modern world, where he saw his first automobile and first experienced electricity, plumbing, refrigeration, and motion pictures. He was raised Catholic but later became an agnostic with views closer to deism.\nAt age fifteen, in 1942, he was sent to Miami to live with his brother's large family, but Poitier found it impossible to adjust to the racism in Jim Crow era Florida. At sixteen, he moved to New York City, looking to become an actor, holding a string of jobs as a dishwasher in the meantime. After failing his first audition with the American Negro Theatre due to his inability to fluently read the script, an elderly Jewish waiter sat with him every night for several months, helping him to improve his reading by using the newspaper. During World War II, in November 1943, he lied about his age (he was only 16 at the time) and enlisted in the Army. He was assigned to a Veterans' Administration hospital in Northport, New York, and was trained to work with psychiatric patients. Poitier became upset with how the hospital treated its patients and feigned mental illness to obtain a discharge. Poitier confessed to a psychiatrist that he was faking his condition, but the doctor was sympathetic and granted his discharge under Section VIII of Army regulation 615\u2013360 in December 1944.\nAfter leaving the Army, he worked as a dishwasher until a successful audition landed him a role in an American Negro Theatre production, the same company he failed his first audition with.\nCareer.\n1947\u20131957: Early work and blacklist.\nPoitier joined the American Negro Theater but was rejected by audiences. Contrary to what was expected of negro actors at the time, Poitier's tone deafness made him unable to sing. Determined to refine his acting skills and rid himself of his noticeable Bahamian accent, he spent the next six months dedicating himself to achieving theatrical success. He modeled his legendary speech pattern after radio personality Norman Brokenshire. On his second attempt at the theater, he was noticed and given a leading role in the Broadway production of \"Lysistrata\", through which, though it ran a failing four days, he received an invitation to understudy for \"Anna Lucasta\". Poitier would later befriend Harry Belafonte at the American Negro Theater.\nIn 1947, Poitier was a founding member of the Committee for the Negro in the Arts (CNA), an organization whose participants were committed to a left-wing analysis of class and racial exploitation. Among his other CNA-related activities, in the early 1950s he was a Vice Chair of the organization. In 1952, he was one of several narrators in a pageant written by Alice Childress and Lorraine Hansberry for the Negro History Festival put on by the leftist Harlem monthly newspaper \"Freedom\".\nHis participation in such events and CNA generally, along with his friendships with other leftist Black performers, including Canada Lee and Paul Robeson, led to his subsequent blacklisting for a few years. Even associating with Poitier added to the basis for blacklisting Alfred Palca, the writer and producer of one of Poitier's earliest films, the 1954 \"Go Man Go\". Poitier never did sign a loyalty oath, despite being asked in connection with his prospective role in \"Blackboard Jungle\" (1955).\nBy late 1949, Poitier had to choose between leading roles on stage and an offer to work for Darryl F. Zanuck in the film \"No Way Out\" (1950). His performance with Ruby Dee and Maude Simmons in \"No Way Out\", as a doctor treating a white bigot (played by Richard Widmark, who became a friend), was noticed and led to more roles, each considerably more interesting and more prominent than those most African-American actors of the time were offered. In 1951, he traveled to South Africa with the African-American actor Canada Lee to star in the film version of \"Cry, the Beloved Country\". Poitier's distinction continued in his role as Gregory W. Miller, a member of an incorrigible high-school class in \"Blackboard Jungle\" (1955). But it was his performance in Martin Ritt's 1957 film \"Edge of the City\" that the industry could not ignore. \nPoitier enjoyed working for director William Wellman on \"Good-bye, My Lady\" (1956). Wellman was a big name, who had previously directed the famous \"Roxie Hart\" (1942) with Ginger Rogers and \"Magic Town\" (1947) with James Stewart. What Poitier remembered indelibly was the wonderful humanity in this talented director. Wellman had a sensitivity that Poitier thought was profound, which Wellman felt he needed to hide.\" Poitier later praised Wellman for inspiring his thoughtful approach to directing when he found himself taking the helm from Joseph Sargent on \"Buck and the Preacher\" in 1971.\n1958\u20131969: Breakthrough and stardom.\nIn 1958 he starred alongside Tony Curtis in director Stanley Kramer's \"The Defiant Ones\". The film was a critical and commercial success with the performances of both Poitier and Curtis being praised. The film landed eight Academy Award nominations including Best Picture and Best Actor nominations for both stars, making Poitier the first African-American actor to be nominated in a lead role. Poitier did win the British Academy Film Award for Best Foreign Actor.\nPoitier acted in the first production of \"A Raisin in the Sun\" alongside Ruby Dee on the Broadway stage at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre in 1959. The play was directed by Lloyd Richards. The play introduced details of Black life to the overwhelmingly White Broadway audiences, while director Richards observed that it was the first play to which large numbers of Black people were drawn. The play was a groundbreaking piece of American theater, with Frank Rich, critic from \"The New York Times\", writing in 1983 that \"A Raisin in the Sun\" \"changed American theater forever\". For his performance Poitier earned a Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play nomination. That same year he starred in the film adaptation of \"Porgy and Bess\" (1959) with Dorothy Dandridge. For his performance, Poitier received a 1960 Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actor in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIf the fabric of the society were different, I would scream to high heaven to play villains and to deal with different images of Negro life that would be more dimensional . . . But I'll be damned if I do that at this stage of the game. Not when there is only one Negro actor working in films with any degree of consistency . . .\nSidney Poitier (1967)\nIn 1961, Poitier starred in the film adaptation of \"A Raisin in the Sun\" for which he received another Golden Globe Award nomination. Also in 1961, Poitier starred in \"Paris Blues\" alongside Paul Newman, Joanne Woodward, Louis Armstrong, and Diahann Carroll. The film dealt with the American racism of the time by contrasting it with Paris's open acceptance of Black people. In 1963 he starred in \"Lilies of the Field\". For this role, he won the Academy Award for Best Actor and became the first African-American to win the award in a leading role. His satisfaction at this honor was undermined by his concerns that this award was more of the industry congratulating itself for having him as a token and it would inhibit him from asking for more substantive considerations afterward. Poitier worked relatively little over the following year; he remained the only major actor of African descent and the roles offered were predominantly typecast as a soft-spoken appeaser.\nIn 1964, Poitier recorded an album with the composer Fred Katz called \"Poitier Meets Plato\", in which Poitier recites passages from Plato's writings. He also performed in the Cold War drama \"The Bedford Incident\" (1965) alongside the film's producer Richard Widmark, the Biblical epic film \"The Greatest Story Ever Told\" (1965) alongside Charlton Heston and Max von Sydow, and \"A Patch of Blue\" (1965) co-starring Elizabeth Hartman and Shelley Winters.\nIn 1967, he was the most successful draw at the box office, the commercial peak of his career, with three popular films, \"To Sir, with Love\", and \"In the Heat of the Night\", and \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\". Although these three films seemingly shared little similarity, they all, albeit not overtly, dealt with the black and white divide. In \"To Sir, with Love\", Poitier plays a teacher at a secondary school in the East End of London. The film deals with social and racial issues in the inner city school. The film was met with mixed response; however, Poitier was praised for his performance, with the critic from \"Time\" writing, \"Even the weak moments are saved by Poitier, who invests his role with a subtle warmth.\"\nIn Norman Jewison's mystery drama \"In the Heat of the Night\", Poitier played Virgil Tibbs, a police detective from Philadelphia who investigates a murder in the Deep South in Mississippi alongside a cop with racial prejudices played by Rod Steiger. The film was a critical success with Bosley Crowther of \"The New York Times\" calling it \"the most powerful film I have seen in a long time.\" Roger Ebert placed it at number ten on his top ten list of 1967 films. Art Murphy of \"Variety\" felt that the excellent Poitier and outstanding Steiger performances overcame noteworthy flaws, including an uneven script. Poitier received a Golden Globe Award and British Academy Film Award nomination for his performance.\nIn Stanley Kramer's social drama \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\", Poitier played a man in a relationship with a White woman played by Katharine Houghton. The film revolves around her bringing him to meet with her parents played by Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy. The film was one of the rare films at the time to depict an interracial romance in a positive light, as interracial marriage historically had been illegal in most states of the United States. It was still illegal in 17 states\u2014mostly Southern states\u2014until June 12, 1967, six months before the film was released. The film was a critical and financial success. In his film review, Roger Ebert described Poitier's character as \"a noble, rich, intelligent, handsome, ethical medical expert\" and that the film \"is a magnificent piece of entertainment. It will make you laugh and may even make you cry.\" To win his role as Dr. Prentice in the film, Poitier had to audition for Tracy and Hepburn at two separate dinner parties.\nPoitier began to be criticized for being typecast as over-idealized African-American characters who were not permitted to have any sexuality or personality faults, such as his character in \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\". Poitier was aware of this pattern himself but was conflicted on the matter. He wanted more varied roles; but he also felt obliged to set an example with his characters, by challenging old stereotypes, as he was the only major actor of African descent being cast in leading roles in the American film industry at the time. For instance, in 1966, he turned down an opportunity to play the lead in an NBC television production of \"Othello\" with that spirit in mind. Despite this, many of the films in which Poitier starred during the 1960s would later be cited as social thrillers by both filmmakers and critics. Such films included \"For Love of Ivy\" in which he modifies the over-idealized African American as Jack Parks, a trucking company executive, who also operates an illegal casino.\n1970\u20131989: Transition to directing.\n\"In the Heat of the Night\" featured his most successful character, Virgil Tibbs, a Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, detective whose subsequent career was the subject of two sequels: \"They Call Me Mister Tibbs!\" (1970) and \"The Organization\" (1971).\nIn 1972, he made his feature film directorial debut, the Western \"Buck and the Preacher\", in which Poitier also starred, alongside Harry Belafonte and Ruby Dee. Poitier replaced the original director, Joseph Sargent. The following year he directed his second feature, the romantic drama \"A Warm December\". Poitier also starred in the film alongside Esther Anderson.\nAlong with Barbra Streisand and Paul Newman, Poitier formed First Artists Production Company so actors could secure properties and develop movie projects for themselves. Working with First Artists, Poitier directed several financially successful comedy films, including three in which he also starred: \"Uptown Saturday Night\" (1974) with Bill Cosby and Harry Belafonte; and \"Let's Do It Again\" (1975) and \"A Piece of the Action\" (1977), both with Cosby. His most successful comedy was \"Stir Crazy\" (1980; not a First Artists production), starring Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder, which for many years was the highest-grossing film directed by a person of African descent.\nIn 1985, he directed \"Fast Forward\" and, in 1990, he reunited with Cosby directing him in the family comedy \"Ghost Dad\". In 1988, he starred in \"Shoot to Kill\" with Tom Berenger.\n1990\u20132022: Later work.\nIn 1992, he starred in \"Sneakers\" with Robert Redford and Dan Aykroyd. In 1997, he co-starred in \"The Jackal\" with Richard Gere and Bruce Willis.\nIn the 1990s, he starred in several well received television movies and miniseries such as \"Separate but Equal\" (1991), \"To Sir, with Love II\" (1996), \"Mandela and de Klerk\" (1997), and \"The Simple Life of Noah Dearborn\" (1999). He received Emmy nominations for his work in \"Separate but Equal\" and \"Mandela and de Klerk\", as well as a Golden Globe nomination for the former. He won a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album in 2001.\nIn 2002, Poitier received the 2001 Honorary Academy Award for his overall contribution to American cinema. Later in the ceremony, Denzel Washington won the award for Best Actor for his performance in \"Training Day\", becoming the second Black actor to win the award. In his victory speech, Washington saluted Poitier by saying \"I'll always be chasing you, Sidney. I'll always be following in your footsteps. There's nothing I would rather do, sir.\"\nWith the death of Ernest Borgnine in 2012, Poitier became the oldest living recipient of the Academy Award for Best Actor. On March 2, 2014, Poitier appeared with Angelina Jolie at the 86th Academy Awards to present the Best Director Award. He was given a standing ovation and Jolie thanked him for all his Hollywood contributions, stating: \"We are in your debt.\" Poitier gave a brief speech, telling his peers to \"keep up the wonderful work\" to warm applause. In 2021, the academy dedicated the lobby of the new Academy Museum of Motion Pictures in Los Angeles as the \"Sidney Poitier Grand Lobby\" in his honor. Poitier was a lifelong activist for racial and social justice. He declined film roles he considered based on offensive racial stereotypes.\nBoard and diplomatic service.\nFrom 1995 to 2003, Poitier was a member of the board of directors of the Walt Disney Company. In April 1997, Poitier was appointed ambassador from the Bahamas to Japan, a position he held until 2007. From 2002 to 2007, he was concurrently the ambassador of the Bahamas to UNESCO.\nPersonal life.\nPoitier was first married to Juanita Hardy from April 29, 1950, until 1965. Though Poitier became a resident of Mount Vernon in Westchester County, New York, in 1956, they raised their family in Stuyvesant, New York, in a house on the Hudson River. In 1959, Poitier began a nine-year affair with actress Diahann Carroll. On January 23, 1976, he married Joanna Shimkus, a Canadian actress who starred with Poitier in \"The Lost Man\" in 1969, and they remained married until his death. Poitier had four daughters with his first wife: Beverly, Pamela, Sherri, and Gina. He had two daughters with his second wife: Anika and Sydney Tamiia. Poitier had eight grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. When Hurricane Dorian hit the Bahamas in September 2019, Poitier's family had 23 missing relatives.\nDeath.\nOn January 6, 2022, Poitier died at his home in Beverly Hills, California, at the age of 94. His death was confirmed by Fred Mitchell, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Bahamas. According to a copy of his death certificate obtained by TMZ, the cause of death was cardiopulmonary failure, with Alzheimer's disease and prostate cancer listed as underlying causes.\nUpon Poitier's death, many people released statements honoring him, including then-President Joe Biden, who wrote in part: \"With unflinching grandeur and poise \u2013 his singular warmth, depth, and stature on-screen \u2013 Sidney helped open the hearts of millions and changed the way America saw itself.\" Former president Barack Obama paid tribute to Poitier, calling him \"a singular talent who epitomized dignity and grace\". Michelle Obama, Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton also released statements.\nMany people in the entertainment industry also paid tribute to Poitier, including Martin Scorsese who wrote, \"For years, the spotlight was on Sidney Poitier. He had a vocal precision and physical power and grace that at moments seemed almost supernatural.\" Harry Belafonte, Morgan Freeman, Viola Davis, Whoopi Goldberg, Lupita Nyong'o, Halle Berry, Ava DuVernay, Oprah Winfrey, Octavia Spencer, Jeffrey Wright, Giancarlo Esposito, Quincy Jones, Michael Eisner, Ron Howard and others also paid tribute. Broadway paid tribute when its theaters dimmed their lights on January 19, 2022, at 7:45\u00a0pm ET.\nThe Ebertfest film festival announced it would be dedicating its 2022 event to the memory of Poitier and Gilbert Gottfried.\nActing credits and accolades.\nPoitier became the first Black actor to win the Academy Award for Best Actor for \"Lilies of the Field\" (1963). He also received a Grammy Award, two Golden Globe Awards, and a British Academy Film Award. He received numerous honoraries during his lifetime including the Academy Honorary Award for his lifetime achievement in film in 2001. In 1992, Poitier received the AFI Life Achievement Award. In 1994, Poitier received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 1981, he received the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award and in 2016 he received the BAFTA Fellowship. In 2022, he was inducted into the National Multicultural Western Heritage Museum.\nIn 1995, he received the Kennedy Center Honor and in 2009, Poitier was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Barack Obama. He was also named an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II in 1974. In 1986, he gave the Commencement Address to the University of Miami graduating class and was given the Honorary Degree of Doctor of Fine Arts.\nLegacy.\nPoitier was described as an icon in his obituary by \"USA Today\". Laura Jacobs for \"Vanity Fair\" hailed Poitier as the \"Martin Luther King Jr. of the movies\". Several film historians and journalists have called him Hollywood's first African-American film star. \"The New York Times\" noted after his death that Poitier was instrumental for the diversity of Hollywood and \"paved the way for Black actors in film\". \"The Hollywood Reporter\" wrote that \"Poitier was the first actor to star in mainstream Hollywood movies that depicted a Black man in a non-stereotypical fashion, and his influence, especially during the 1950s and '60s as role model and image-maker, was immeasurable\".\nWhile presenting Poitier the Honorary Academy Award in 2002, Denzel Washington said of Poitier: \"Before Sidney, African American actors had to take supporting roles in major studio films that were easy to cut out in certain parts of the country. But you couldn't cut Sidney Poitier out of a Sidney Poitier picture\". He was an influential African-American actor and highly viewed as such as he became the first Black male actor to be nominated (1958) for an Academy Award (following the nominations of actresses Hattie McDaniel in 1940 and Dorothy Dandridge in 1954) and the first Black male actor to win the award. He was also described as the \"sole representative\" of African-Americans in mainstream cinema during the 1950s and 1960s, especially during the height of the American Civil Rights movement. \"The New York Times\" wrote that Poitier was \"an ambassador to white America and a benign emblem of Black power\". \nFor his role in diversifying Hollywood and for his role in paving the way for further Black actors, he was described as one of \"the most important figures of 20th century Hollywood\". The former US president Barack Obama said Poitier had \"[advanced] the nation's dialogue on race and respect\" and \"opened doors for a generation of actors\". \"Sidney\", a documentary film about Poitier's life and legacy by Reginald Hudlin, was released on September 23, 2022.\nWorks.\nPoitier wrote three autobiographical books:\nTwo biographies of Poitier have been published:\nHis life has been documented in the visual arts:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A narrower concept is human capital, the knowledge and skills which the individuals command.\nDistinction to human resource management.\nIn vernacular usage, \"human resources\" or \"human resource\" can refer to the human resources department (HR department) of an organization, which performs human resource management, overseeing various aspects of employment, such as compliance with labor law and employment standards, interviewing and selection, performance management, administration of employee benefits, organizing of employee files with the required documents for future reference, and some aspects of recruitment (also known as talent acquisition), talent management, staff wellbeing, and employee offboarding. They serve as the link between an organization's management and its employees.\nThe duties include planning, recruitment and selection process, posting job ads, evaluating the performance of employees, organizing resumes and job applications, scheduling interviews and assisting in the process and ensuring background checks. Another duty is payroll and benefits administration, which deals with ensuring vacation and sick time are accounted for, reviewing payroll, and participating in benefits tasks, such as claim resolutions, reconciling benefits statements, and approving invoices for payment. Human resources also coordinates employee relations activities and programs, including employee counseling.\nHuman resource management plays an important part in developing and making a company or organization at the beginning or making a success at the end, due to the labor provided by employees. Human resources are intended to show how to have better employment relations in the workforce. Also, to bring out the best work ethic of the employees and therefore making a move to a better working environment. Moreover, green human resource development is suggested as a paradigm shift from traditional approaches of human resource companies to bring awareness of ways that expertise can be applied to green practices. By integrating the expertise, knowledge, and competencies of human resource development practitioners with industry practitioners, most industries have the potential to be transformed into a sector with ecofriendly and pro-environmental culture.\nHuman resources also deals with essential motivators in the workplace such as payroll, benefits, team morale and workplace harassment.\nAdministration and operations used to be the two role areas of HR. The strategic planning component came into play as a result of companies recognizing the need to consider HR needs in goals and strategies. HR directors commonly sit on company executive teams because of the HR planning function. Numbers and types of employees and the evolution of compensation systems are among elements in the planning role. Various factors affecting human resource planning include organizational structure, growth, business location, demographic changes, environmental uncertainties, expansion.\nA human resources manager can have various functions in a company, including to:\nHistory.\nHuman resource management used to be referred to as \"personnel administration\". In the 1920s, personnel administration focused mostly on the aspects of hiring, evaluating, and compensating employees. However, they did not focus on any employment relationships at an organizational performance level or on the systematic relationships in any parties. This led to a lacked unifying paradigm in the field during this period.\nAccording to an \"HR Magazine\" article, the first personnel management department started at the National Cash Register Co. in 1900. The owner, John Henry Patterson, organized a personnel department to deal with grievances, discharges and safety, and information for supervisors on new laws and practices after several strikes and employee lockouts. This action was followed by other companies; for example, Ford had high turnover ratios of 380 percent in 1913, but just one year later, the line workers of the company had doubled their daily salaries from $2.50 to $5, even though $2.50 was a fair wage at that time. This example clearly shows the importance of effective management which leads to a greater outcome of employee satisfaction as well as encouraging employees to work together in order to achieve better business objectives.\nDuring the 1970s, American businesses began experiencing challenges due to the substantial increase in competitive pressures. Companies experienced globalization, deregulation, and rapid technological change which caused the major companies to enhance their strategic planning \u2013 a process of predicting future changes in a particular environment and focus on ways to promote organizational effectiveness. This resulted in developing more jobs and opportunities for people to show their skills which were directed to effectively applying employees toward the fulfillment of individual, group, and organizational goals. Many years later the major/minor of human resource management was created at universities and colleges also known as business administration. It consists of all the activities that companies used to ensure the more effective use of employees.\nNow, human resources focus on the people side of management. There are two real definitions of HRM (Human Resource Management); one is that it is the process of managing people in organizations in a structured and thorough manner. This means that it covers the hiring, firing, pay and perks, and performance management. This first definition is the modern and traditional version more like what a personnel manager would have done back in the 1920s. The second definition is that HRM circles the ideas of management of people in organizations from a macromanagement perspective like customers and competitors in a marketplace. This involves the focus on making the \"employment relationship\" fulfilling for both management and employees.\nSome research showed that employees can perform at a much higher rate of productivity when their supervisors and managers paid more attention to them. The Father of Human relations, Elton Mayo, was the first person to reinforce the importance of employee communications, cooperation, and involvement. His studies concluded that sometimes the human factors are more important than physical factors, such as quality of lighting and physical workplace conditions. As a result, individuals often place value more on how they feel. For example, a rewarding system in Human resource management, applied effectively, can further encourage employees to achieve their best performance.\nOrigins of the terminology.\nPioneering economist John R. Commons mentioned \"human resource\" in his 1893 book \"The Distribution of Wealth\" but did not elaborate. The expression was used during the 1910s to 1930s to promote the idea that human beings are of worth (as in human dignity); by the early 1950s, it meant people as a means to an end (for employers). Among scholars the first use of the phrase in that sense was in a 1958 report by economist E. Wight Bakke.\nIn regard to how individuals respond to the changes in a labor market, the following must be understood:\nNew terminology, and reinventions of the HR field, include People Operations, employee experience, employee success, people, and partner resources.\nCriticism of terminology.\nOne concern about considering people as assets or resources is that they will be commoditized, objectified, and abused. Critics of the term human resources would argue that human beings are not \"commodities\" or \"resources\", but are creative and social beings in a productive enterprise. The 2000 revision of ISO 9001, in contrast, requires identifying the processes, their sequence, and interaction, and to define and communicate responsibilities and authorities. In general, heavily unionized nations such as France and Germany have adopted and encouraged such approaches. Also, in 2001, the International Labour Organization decided to revisit and revise its 1975 Recommendation 150 on Human Resources Development, resulting in its \"Labour is not a commodity\" principle.\nAnother controversy regards labor mobility and the broader philosophical issue with the usage of the phrase \"human resources\". Governments of developing nations often regard developed nations that encourage immigration or \"guest workers\" as appropriating human capital that is more rightfully part of the developing nation and required to further its economic growth. Over time, the United Nations have come to more generally support the developing nations' point of view, and have requested significant offsetting \"foreign aid\" contributions so that a developing nation losing human capital does not lose the capacity to continue to train new people in trades, professions, and the arts. Some businesses and companies are choosing to rename this department using other terms, such as \"people operations\" or \"culture department,\" in order to erase this stigma.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

During this period, the main heretical doctrine was Gnosticism, which Telesphorus vigorously fought because he believed it could steer religion towards a mysticism far removed from reality. The main exponent of this doctrine was the philosopher Valentinus, who at this time moved from Egypt to Rome and also managed to have a large number of followers in the capital of the empire for more than twenty years. \nA fragment of a letter from Iren\u00e6us to Pope Victor I during the Easter controversy in the late 2nd century, also preserved by Eusebius, testifies that Telesphorus was one of the Roman bishops who always celebrated Easter on Sunday, rather than on other days of the week according to the calculation of the Jewish Passover. Unlike Victor, however, Telesphorus remained in communion with those communities that did not follow this custom.\nThe tradition of Christmas Midnight Masses, the celebration of Easter on Sundays, the keeping of a seven-week Lent before Easter and the singing of the Gloria are usually attributed to his pontificate, however, historian Johann Peter Kirsch says that \"[n]one of the statements in the \"Liber pontificalis\" and other authorities of a later date as to liturgical and other decisions of this pope are genuine.\" \nAccording to the testimony of Irenaeus (\"Against Heresies\" III.3.3), he suffered martyrdom. Although most early popes are called martyrs by sources such as the \"Liber Pontificalis\" (dating to the 3rd century at earliest), Telesphorus is the first to whom Irenaeus, writing considerably earlier (c. 180 AD), gives this title, thus making his martyrdom the earliest attested martyrdom of a pope after Peter. He was buried in the Vatican Necropolis, next to his predecessors. \nIn Roman Martyrology, his feast is celebrated on 2 January; the Eastern churches celebrate it on 22 February.\nPatronage.\nUntil the 17th century, the Carmelites venerated Telesphorus as a patron saint of the order since some sources depict him living as a hermit. He is depicted in a stained glass window at the Carmelite monastery in Boxmeer. \nThe town of Saint-T\u00e9lesphore, in the southwestern part of Canada's Quebec province, is named after him.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\u00a0This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain:\u00a0"}

He notes that whether such a threat constitutes nuclear blackmail often depends on moral judgments about the action compelled or deterred\u2014judgments that are likely to differ between opposing parties.\nHistory.\nBy the United States.\nIn 1953, during the final phase of active hostilities in the Korean War and the early period of the Eisenhower administration, U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles conveyed messages of nuclear blackmail through indirect channels to the Communists\u2014including the North Koreans, Chinese, and Soviets\u2014warning to put the conflict to an end by using atomic bombs if no progress was made toward a negotiated settlement. Nuclear blackmail may have complicated rather than facilitated an armistice, because the Chinese refused to appease the Americans with their threats and the United Nations members such as the British did not support a full-scale escalation.\nIn January 1955, the Chinese government made the decision to develop the nuclear bomb as a result of the unpredictabilities brought by the nuclear blackmail levied by foreign powers, particularly the United States. On October 16, 1964, when China became a nuclear power, the Chinese government stated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"The Chinese Government fully understands the good intentions of peace-loving countries and peoples in demanding an end to all nuclear tests. But more and more countries are coming to realize that the more exclusive the monopoly of nuclear weapons held by the U.S. imperialists and their partners, the greater the danger of a nuclear war. They are very arrogant when they have those weapons while you haven't. But when those who oppose them also have such weapons, they will not be so haughty, their policy of nuclear blackmail and nuclear threats will not be so effective, and the possibility of complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons will increase. We sincerely hope that a nuclear war will never break out. We are deeply convinced that, so long as all peace-loving countries and peoples make joint efforts and persist in the struggle, nuclear war can be prevented.\"\nBy Russia.\nOn September 25, 2024, Putin warned the West that if attacked with conventional weapons Russia would consider a nuclear retaliation. Putin went on to threaten nuclear powers that if they supported another country's attack on Russia, then they would be considered participants in such an aggression. This was described by the office of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as nuclear blackmail.\nBy others.\nFollowing the 2025 India\u2013Pakistan conflict, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi stated that Pakistan had been engaging in nuclear blackmail, which India would no longer tolerate, adding that the country would not be intimidated by nuclear threats. \nIn 1981, the US Department of Energy security director Martin Dowd said there had been 75 cases in the last five years of nuclear blackmail by people threatening to release radioactive material on the public, in which almost all of the cases were threats by \"cranks and weirdos\" but several blackmail attempts were serious.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She is best known for her erotic novel \"Story of O\" (1954).\nEarly life.\nBorn in Rochefort, Charente-Maritime, France to a bilingual family, Desclos began reading in French and English at an early age. After completing her studies at the Sorbonne, she worked as a journalist until 1946 when she joined Gallimard Publishers as the editorial secretary for one of its imprints where she began using the pen name of Dominique Aury.\nAn avid reader of English literature, Desclos either translated or introduced to readers in France such renowned authors as Algernon Charles Swinburne, Evelyn Waugh, Virginia Woolf, T. S. Eliot, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and numerous others. She became a critic and was made a member of the jury for several prominent literary awards.\nCareer.\nDesclos' lover and employer Jean Paulhan, who enjoyed the works of Marquis de Sade and had written a preface to one of his works, had made the remark to her that no woman was capable of writing an erotic novel. To prove him wrong, Desclos began a graphic, sadomasochistic novel; after reading the beginning, Paulhan encouraged her to complete it, and it was published under the pseudonym Pauline R\u00e9age in June 1954. Titled \"Histoire d'O\" (\"Story of O\"), with a sympathetic preface by Jean Paulhan which nevertheless did not reveal her identity, it was an enormous, though controversial, commercial success. The book caused much speculation as to the identity of the author. Many doubted that it was a woman, let alone the demure, intellectual, and almost prudish persona displayed in Dominique Aury's writings. Many well-known male writers were alternately suspected to be the author, including Andr\u00e9 Malraux and Henri de Montherlant.\nIn addition, the book's graphic content sparked so much controversy that the following March the government authorities brought obscenity charges against the publisher and its mysterious author that were thrown out of court in 1959. However, a publicity ban and a restriction on the book's sale to minors was imposed by the judge. Following the lifting of the publicity ban in 1967, the conclusion to \"Story of O\" was published under the title \"Retour \u00e0 Roissy\" using the pseudonym of Pauline R\u00e9age. However, according to her recent biography by Angie David, Desclos did not write this second novel. In 1975, she did a long interview about erotic books with author R\u00e9gine Deforges, published by \"Story of O\" editor Jean-Jacques Pauvert, yet at the time her authorship was still unknown. An English-language edition of the interview was released in the United States in 1979 by Viking Press.\nEventually, Desclos publicly admitted that she was the author of \"The Story of O\" in 1994, 40 years after the book was published, in an interview with \"The New Yorker\". She also explained the pseudonym of Pauline R\u00e9age: she chose the first name in homage to Pauline Bonaparte and Pauline Roland and she randomly picked up the name of R\u00e9age on a topographic map.\nDocumentaries.\n\"Writer of O\", a 2004 documentary film by Pola Rapaport, mixed interviews with re-enactments of certain scenes from the book. In the documentary, the real author of \"Story of O\", Dominique Aury (actually a pen name of Desclos), talks about the book \"A Girl in Love\". This book was written about how \"Story of O\" was written.\nA documentary was also made for BBC Radio 4 entitled \"The Story of O: The Vice Francaise\", presented by Rowan Pelling, former editor of the \"Erotic Review\", which looked at the history of the book and its author Desclos.\n\"\", a documentary by filmmaker Maya Gallus, featured the final interview with 90-year-old Dominique Aury (a pen name of Desclos) before she died. In the film, she recounts the extraordinary love story behind \"Story of O\" and marvels that she has reached such a grand age.\nPersonal life.\nDesclos had a long-term relationship with her employer, Jean Paulhan, the director of the prestigious \"Nouvelle Revue Fran\u00e7aise\", who was 23 years her senior. She was bisexual, and had a liaison with historian \u00c9dith Thomas, who may have been an inspiration for the character of Anne-Marie in \"Story of O\". She had a son from a brief marriage in her early twenties.\nLegacy.\nIn 2007, the National Leather Association International inaugurated awards for excellence in SM/fetish/leather writing. The categories include the Pauline Reage (a pen name of Desclos) award for fiction novel.\nIn 2020, Desclos was inducted into the Leather Hall of Fame.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "46063", "revid": "23735172", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46063", "title": "Case sensitivity", "text": "Defines whether uppercase and lowercase letters are treated as distinct\nIn computers, case sensitivity defines whether uppercase and lowercase letters are treated as distinct (case-sensitive) or equivalent (case-insensitive). For instance, when users interested in learning about dogs search an e-book, \"dog\" and \"Dog\" are of the same significance to them. Thus, they request a case-insensitive search. But when they search an online encyclopedia for information about the United Nations, for example, or something with no ambiguity regarding capitalization and ambiguity between two or more terms cut down by capitalization, they may prefer a case-sensitive search.\nAreas of significance.\nCase sensitivity may differ depending on the situation:\nIn programming languages.\nSome programming languages are case-sensitive for their identifiers (C, C++, Java, C#, Verilog, Ruby, Python and Swift). Others are case-insensitive (i.e., not case-sensitive), such as ABAP, Ada, most BASICs (an exception being BBC BASIC), Common Lisp, Fortran, SQL (for the syntax, and for some vendor implementations, e.g. Microsoft SQL Server, the data itself) Pascal, Rexx and ooRexx. There are also languages, such as Haskell, Prolog, and Go, in which the capitalisation of an identifier encodes information about its semantics. Some other programming languages have varying case sensitivity; in PHP, for example, variable names are case-sensitive but function names are not case-sensitive. This means that if a function is defined in lowercase, it can be called in uppercase, but if a variable is defined in lowercase, it cannot be referred to in uppercase. Nim is case-insensitive and ignores underscores, as long as the first characters match.\nIn text search.\nA text search operation could be case-sensitive or case-insensitive, depending on the system, application, or context. The user can in many cases specify whether a search is sensitive to case, e.g. in most text editors, word processors, and Web browsers. A case-insensitive search is more comprehensive, finding \"Language\" (at the beginning of a sentence), \"language\", and \"LANGUAGE\" (in a title in capitals); a case-sensitive search will find the computer language \"BASIC\" but exclude most of the many unwanted instances of the word. For example, the Google Search engine is basically case-insensitive, with no option for case-sensitive search. In Oracle SQL, most operations and searches are case-sensitive by default, while in most other DBMSes, SQL searches are case-insensitive by default.\nCase-insensitive operations are sometimes said to fold case, from the idea of folding the character code table so that upper- and lowercase letters coincide.\nIn filesystems.\nIn filesystems in Unix-like systems, filenames are usually case-sensitive (there can be separate readme.txt and Readme.txt files in the same directory). MacOS is somewhat unusual in that, by default, it uses HFS+ and APFS in a case-insensitive (so that there cannot be a readme.txt and a Readme.txt in the same directory) but case-preserving mode (so that a file created as readme.txt is shown as readme.txt and a file created as Readme.txt is shown as Readme.txt) by default. This causes some issues for developers and power users, because most file systems in other Unix-like environments are case-sensitive, and, for example, a source code tree for software for Unix-like systems might have both a file named Makefile and a file named makefile in the same directory. In addition, some Mac Installers assume case insensitivity and fail on case-sensitive file systems.\nThe older MS-DOS filesystems FAT12 and FAT16 were case-insensitive and not case-preserving, so that a file whose name is entered as readme.txt or ReadMe.txt is saved as README.TXT. Later, with VFAT in Windows 95 the FAT file systems became case-preserving as an extension of supporting long filenames. Later Windows file systems such as NTFS are internally case-sensitive, and a readme.txt and a Readme.txt can coexist in the same directory. However, for practical purposes filenames behave as case-insensitive as far as users and most software are concerned. This can cause problems for developers or software coming from Unix-like environments, similar to the problems with macOS case-insensitive file systems.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Desclos stated she wrote the novel as a series of love letters to her lover Jean Paulhan, who had admired the work of the Marquis de Sade. The novel shares with the latter themes such as love, dominance, and submission.\nPlot.\n\"Story of O\" is a tale of female submission involving a beautiful Parisian fashion photographer named O, who is taught to be constantly available for oral, vaginal, and anal intercourse, offering herself to any male who belongs to the same secret society as her lover. She is regularly stripped, blindfolded, chained, and whipped; her anus is widened by increasingly large plugs; her labium is pierced and her buttocks are branded.\nThe story begins when O's lover, Ren\u00e9, brings her to the ch\u00e2teau in Roissy, where she is trained to serve the members of an elite club. After this initial training, as a demonstration of their bond and his generosity, Ren\u00e9 hands O to his elder stepbrother Sir Stephen, a more severe master. Ren\u00e9 wants O to learn to serve someone whom she does not love, and someone who does not love her. Over the course of this training, O falls in love with Sir Stephen and believes him to be in love with her as well. During the summer, Sir Stephen sends O to an old mansion in Samois solely inhabited by women for advanced training and body modifications related to submission. There she agrees to receive permanent marks of Sir Stephen's ownership, in the form of a brand and a steel tag hanging from a labia piercing.\nMeanwhile Ren\u00e9 has encouraged O to seduce Jacqueline, a vain fashion model, and lure her to Roissy. Jacqueline is repulsed when she first sees O's chains and scars, although O herself is proud of her condition as a willing slave. But Jacqueline's younger half-sister becomes enamored of O, and begs to be taken to Roissy.\nAt the climax, O is presented as a sexual slave, nude but for an owl-like mask and a leash attached to her piercing, before a large party of guests who treat her solely as an object. Afterward, she is shared by Sir Stephen and an associate of his who is referred to only as \"The Commander\".\nSome early editions included several different variations of an epilogue which note that Sir Stephen later abandoned O, though there is debate as to whether Desclos intended it to be included in the finished work; in one such version, O is so distraught by the threat of this abandonment that she insists she would rather die and asks for permission to commit suicide, which is granted.\nPublishing history.\nIn February 1955, \"Story of O\" won the French literature prize Prix des Deux Magots, but the French authorities still brought obscenity charges against the publisher. The charges were rejected by the courts, but a publicity ban was imposed for a number of years.\nOlympia Press published the first English edition in 1965. Eliot Fremont-Smith (of \"The New York Times\") called its publication \"a significant event\".\nCriticism.\nA critical view of the novel is that it is about, and derives its erotic power from, the ultimate objectification of a woman. The heroine has the shortest possible name. Though this is in fact a shortening of \"Odile\", it could also stand for \"object\" or \"orifice\", an O being a symbolic representation of any \"hole\". The novel was strongly criticized by many feminists for glorifying abuse of women. An article by Susan Griffin that appears in \"Against Sadomasochism: A Radical Feminist Analysis\" (reprinted from Griffin\u2019s book \"Pornography and Silence\" with an introduction) criticizes the novel; Griffin argues that \"Story of O\" shows \"how a pornographic society turns a woman's heart against herself.\"\nWhen the film \"Story of O\" was released, \"L'Express\" magazine ran a feature on the novel and film. This resulted in \"L'Express\" being picketed by feminists from the group Mouvement de lib\u00e9ration des femmes, who found the novel and film objectionable. Journalist Fran\u00e7ois Chalais also criticized \"Story of O\", claiming the novel glorified violence; he described the novel as \"bringing the Gestapo into the boudoir\".\nHidden identities.\nThe book's author Anne Desclos used a pen name, then later used another pen name, before finally, just before her death, revealing her true identity. Her lover, Jean Paulhan, wrote the preface as if the author were unknown to him.\nAccording to Geraldine Bedell, writing in 2004, \"Pauline R\u00e9age, the author, was a pseudonym, and many people thought that the book could only have been written by a man. The writer's true identity was not revealed until ten years ago, when, in an interview with John de St. Jorre, a British journalist and sometime foreign correspondent of \"The Observer\", an impeccably dressed 86-year-old intellectual called Dominique Aury acknowledged that the fantasies of castles, masks and debauchery were hers.\" According to several other sources, however, Dominique Aury was itself a pseudonym of Anne Desclos, born 23 September 1907 in Rochefort-sur-Mer, France, and deceased 26 April 1998 (at age 90) in Paris.\nThe Grove Press edition (U.S., 1965) was translated by editor Richard Seaver (who had lived in France for many years) under the pseudonym Sabine d'Estr\u00e9e.\nJean Paulhan.\nJean Paulhan, the author's lover and the person to whom she wrote \"Story of O\" in the form of love letters, wrote the preface, \"Happiness in Slavery\". Paulhan admired the Marquis de Sade's work and told Desclos that a woman could not write like de Sade. Desclos took this as a challenge and wrote the book. Paulhan was so impressed that he sent it to a publisher. In the preface, he goes out of his way to appear as if he does not know who wrote it. In one part he says, \"But from the beginning to end, the story of O is managed rather like some brilliant feat. It reminds you more of a speech than of a mere effusion; of a letter rather than a secret diary. But to whom is the letter addressed? Whom is the speech trying to convince? Whom can we ask? I don't even know who you are. That you are a woman I have little doubt.\" Paulhan also explains his own belief that the themes in the book depict the true nature of women. At times, the preface (when read with the knowledge of the relationship between Paulhan and the author), seems to be a continuation of the conversation between them.\nIn an interview Paulhan explained that O, in a religious-like obsession, was seeking the loss of responsibility for her body and mind much like many religious women seek to surrender themselves to the mercy of God. In both cases it is the joy of destruction. Paulhan was also quoted: \"To be killed by someone you love strikes me as the epitome of ecstasy\". Discussing the ending, Paulhan states, \"I too was surprised by the end. And nothing you can say will convince me that it is the real end. That in reality (so to speak) your heroine convinces Sir Stephen to consent to her death.\"\nOne critic has seen Paulhan's essay as consistent with other themes in his work, including his interest in erotica, his \"mystification\" of love and sexual relationships, and a view of women that is arguably sexist.\nLegacy.\nEmmanuelle Arsan claimed the \"Story of O\" inspired her to write her own erotic novel \"Emmanuelle\" (1967).\nA sequel to \"Story of O\", \"Retour \u00e0 Roissy\" (\"Return to Roissy,\" but often translated as \"Return to the Chateau\", \"Continuing the Story of O\"), was published in 1969 in French, again with Jean-Jacques Pauvert, \"\u00e9diteur\". It was published again in English by Grove Press, Inc., in 1971. It is not known whether this work is by the same author as the original.\nThe town Samois-sur-Seine is mentioned in \"Story of O\" as the location of the fictional mansion managed by Anne-Marie, a lesbian dominatrix. In 1978, the name Samois was adopted by a lesbian-feminist BDSM organization based in San Francisco that existed from 1978 to 1983. It was the first lesbian BDSM group in the United States.\nIn 2007, the National Leather Association International inaugurated awards for excellence in SM/fetish/leather writing. The categories include the Pauline Reage (a pen name of Anne Desclos, author of \"Story of O\") award for fiction novel.\nIn 2020, Anne Desclos was inducted into the Leather Hall of Fame.\nAdaptations.\nFilm.\nAmerican experimental director Kenneth Anger made a 20-minute short film version, \"l'Histoire d'O\", in 1961.\nFrench director Henri-Georges Clouzot wanted to adapt the novel to film for many years, which was eventually done by director Just Jaeckin in 1975 as \"Histoire d'O\" (\"Story of O\") produced by Eric Rochat and G\u00e9rard Lorin, starring Corinne Cl\u00e9ry and Udo Kier. The film met with far less acclaim than the book. In the United Kingdom it was refused a certificate by the BBFC, and was not passed until February 2000.\nIn 1975, American director Gerard Damiano, well known for \"Deep Throat\" (1972) and \"The Devil in Miss Jones\" (1973), created the movie \"The Story of Joanna\", highly influenced by the \"Story of O\", by combining motifs from one of the book's chapters and from Jean-Paul Sartre's \"No Exit\".\nIn 1979, Danish director Lars von Trier made the short movie entitled \"Menthe \u2013 la bienheureuse\", as an homage to \"Story of O\". His 2005 film \"Manderlay\" was also inspired by the book, particularly Paulhan's introduction.\nFive years later, in 1984, actress Sandra Wey starred as \"O\" in \"Story of O - Chapter 2\", written, directed and produced by Eric Rochat.\nIn 1992, a Brazilian miniseries in 10 episodes entitled \"A Hist\u00f3ria de O\" starring Claudia Cepeda was written, directed and produced by Eric Rochat, who was the producer of the original 1975 movie.\nIn 2002, another version of \"O\" was released, called \"\", with Danielle Ciardi playing the title character.\nComics.\nIn 1975, it was adapted for comics by the Italian artist Guido Crepax. Both the original and Crepax's adaptation were parodied for comics in 2007 by Charles Alverson and John Linton Roberson.\nDocumentaries.\n\"Writer of O\", a 2004 documentary film by Pola Rapaport, mixed interviews with re-enactments of certain scenes from the book. In the documentary, the real author of \"Story of O\", Dominique Aury (actually a pen name of Anne Desclos), talks about the book \"A Girl in Love\". This book was written about how \"Story of O\" was written.\nA documentary was also made for BBC Radio 4 entitled \"The Story of O: The Vice Francaise\", presented by Rowan Pelling, former editor of the \"Erotic Review\", which looked at the history of the book and its author Anne Desclos.\n\"\", a documentary film by Maya Gallus produced by Red Queen Productions in 1997, featured the final interview with 90-year-old Dominique Aury (a pen name of \"Story of O\" author Anne Desclos) before she died. In the film, she recounts the extraordinary love story behind \"Story of O\" and marvels that she has reached such a grand age.\nReferences in culture.\nThe Irish songwriter Damien Rice mentions \"Story of O\" in his song 'Amie': \"Amie, come sit on my wall / And read me the story of 'O...'\". The album which \"Amie\" is part of is called \"O\".\nIn season 5, episode 3 of the sitcom \"Frasier\", titled \"Halloween\", Roz dresses as \"O\" for a literary character Halloween party.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was one of the foremost mathematical analysts of his generation and made fundamental contributions to the theory of orthogonal polynomials and Toeplitz matrices building on the work of his contemporary Otto Toeplitz.\nLife.\nSzeg\u0151 was born in Kunhegyes, Austria-Hungary (today Hungary), into a Jewish family as the son of Adolf Szeg\u0151 and Hermina Neuman. He married the chemist Anna Elisabeth Nem\u00e9nyi in 1919, with whom he had two children.\nIn 1912 he started studies in mathematical physics at the University of Budapest, with summer visits to the University of Berlin and the University of G\u00f6ttingen, where he attended lectures by Frobenius and Hilbert, amongst others. In Budapest he was taught mainly by Fej\u00e9r, , K\u00fcrsch\u00e1k and Bauer and made the acquaintance of his future collaborators George P\u00f3lya and Michael Fekete. His studies were interrupted in 1915 by World War I, in which he served in the infantry, artillery and air corps.\nIn 1918 while stationed in Vienna, he was awarded a doctorate by the University of Vienna for his work on Toeplitz determinants. He received his Privat-Dozent from the University of Berlin in 1921, where he stayed until being appointed as successor to Knopp at the University of K\u00f6nigsberg in 1926. Intolerable working conditions during the Nazi regime resulted in a temporary position at the Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri in 1936, before his appointment as chairman of the mathematics department at Stanford University in 1938, where he helped build up the department until his retirement in 1966.

He was one of the foremost analysts of his generation and made fundamental contributions to the theory of Toeplitz matrices and orthogonal polynomials. He wrote over 130 papers in several languages. Each of his four books, several written in collaboration with others, has become a classic in its field. The monograph \"Orthogonal polynomials\", published in 1939, contains much of his research and has had a profound influence in many areas of applied mathematics, including theoretical physics, stochastic processes and numerical analysis.\nTutoring von Neumann.\nAt the age of 15, the young John von Neumann, recognised as a mathematical prodigy, was sent to study advanced calculus under Szeg\u0151. On their first meeting, Szeg\u0151 was so astounded by von Neumann's mathematical talent and speed that, as recalled by his wife, he came back home with tears in his eyes. Szeg\u0151 subsequently visited the von Neumann house twice a week to tutor the child prodigy.

He was the first Franciscan to be elected pope.\nEarly life.\nJerome Masci (Girolamo Masci) was born on 30 September 1227 at Lisciano, near Ascoli Piceno. He was a pious, peace-loving man whose goals as a Franciscan friar were to protect the Church, promote the crusades, and root out heresy. According to Heinrich of Rebdorf, he was a Doctor of Theology. As a Franciscan friar, he had been elected the Order's superior (minister) for Dalmatia during the Franciscan general chapter held at Pisa in 1272. Pope Gregory X (1271-1276), was sending a legate to the Byzantine emperor, Michael VIII Palaiologos, in 1272, to invite the participation of Byzantine prelates in the Second Council of Lyons. The pope's ambition was to achieve a reunion of Eastern and Western Christendom. St Bonaventure, then minister general of the Order of Friars Minor (Franciscans), was asked to select four Franciscans to accompany the legation as nuncios. He chose Friar Jerome Masci as one of the four. When Bonaventure died suddenly during the fifth session of the Order's General Chapter at Lyons on 15 July 1274, Friar Jerome Masci was elected to succeed him as the Franciscan minister general, even though he was absent at the time, only then returning with the Byzantine delegates from the embassy to Constantinople.\nJerome was the associate of John of Vercelli, master general of the Dominican Order, when the latter was sent by Pope Nicholas III (Giovanni Caetani Orsini) on 15 October 1277, to arrange a peace between Philip IV of France and Alfonso III of Aragon. Jerome and John of Vercelli were again appointed to the same task on 4 April 1278. At the same time, Jerome was ordered to continue for the time being as the Franciscan Minister General.\nIn 1278 Jerome was made cardinal priest by Pope Nicholas III, and at some point after 16 May 1279 was assigned the titular church of Santa Pudenziana. Even after his appointment as a cardinal, he was allowed to remain as minister general of the Franciscans until the next general chapter. In the event, however, he was unable to attend the chapter for reasons of ill health, as a letter of apology of Pope Nicholas III, written in May 1279, indicates. On 12 April 1281 he was promoted to cardinal bishop of Palestrina by Pope Martin IV.\nPontificate.\nPapal conclave.\nAfter the death of Pope Honorius IV on 3 April 1287, a conclave was held in Rome, at the papal palace next to Santa Sabina on the Aventine Hill, where Pope Honorius had died. This was in accordance with the Constitution \"Ubi periculum\" of Pope Gregory X. At the beginning, in April, there were thirteen cardinals in Rome; three cardinals\u2014Gerardo Bianchi, Giovanni Boccamati, and Jean Cholet\u2014did not attend at all. The Sacred College was for a time hopelessly divided in its selection of a successor. When six of the electors died during the year 1287 (Ancher Pantaleon, Geoffrey de Bar, Hugh of Evesham, Giordano Orsini, Comes de Casanate, and Goffredo of Alatri\u2014some, at least, carried off by fever), the others, with the sole exception of Jerome Masci, left the conclave and returned to their homes. It was not until the following year that they reassembled. The electors at that time were seven in number: Jerome Masci, along with Latino Malabranca, Bentivenga de Bentivengis, Bernard de Languissel, Matteo Rosso Orsini, Giacomo Colonna, and Benedetto Caetani. On 15 February 1288, the survivors unanimously elected Jerome Masci, to the papacy on the first scrutiny. It is said that the cardinals were impressed by his steadfastness in remaining at the papal palace, but there is no real documentation as to their motives. As he admitted in his electoral manifesto, Cardinal Masci was extremely reluctant to accept, and indeed he persisted in his refusal for an entire week. Finally, on 22 February, he gave in and agreed. He became the first Franciscan pope and chose the name Nicholas IV in remembrance of Nicholas III, who had made him a cardinal.\nNew cardinals.\nGiven the considerable losses to the numbers of the Sacred College in 1286 and 1287, it is not surprising that Nicholas IV quickly proceeded to fill vacancies. What is surprising is that he did not even reach the number of cardinals who were alive under Honorius IV, let alone exceed it. On 16 May 1288, he named six new cardinals: Bernardus Calliensis, Bishop of Osimo (who died in 1291), Hugues Aiscelin (Seguin) de Billon, OP, of the diocese of Clermont in the Auvergne; Matthew of Aquasparta in Tuscany, minister general of the Franciscans since 1287; Pietro Peregrosso of Milan, the vice-chancellor of the Holy Roman Church; Napoleone Orsini; and Pietro Colonna.\nNicholas IV issued an important constitution on 18 July 1289, which granted to the cardinals one-half of all income accruing to the Holy See and a share in the financial management, thereby paving the way for that independence of the College of Cardinals which, in the following century, was to be of detriment to the papacy.\nActions.\nIn regard to the question of the Sicilian succession, as feudal suzerain of the kingdom, Nicholas annulled the treaty, concluded in 1288 through the mediation of Edward I of England, which confirmed James II of Aragon in the possession of the island of Sicily. This treaty had not properly seen to papal interests. In May 1289 he crowned Charles II as king of Sicily after the latter had expressly recognized papal suzerainty, and in February 1291 concluded a treaty with Kings Alfonso III of Aragon and Philip IV of France looking toward the expulsion of James from Sicily.\nIn 1288 Nicholas met with the Nestorian Christian Rabban Bar Sauma from China.\nIn August 1290 he granted the status of \"studium generale\" to the university that King Denis of Portugal has just founded a few months earlier in the city of Lisbon.\nThe loss of Acre in 1291 stirred Nicholas IV to renewed enthusiasm for a crusade. He sent missionaries, among them the Franciscan John of Monte Corvino, to labour among the Bulgarians, Ethiopians, Mongols, Tatars and Chinese.\nDeath.\nNicholas IV died in Rome on 4 April 1292, in the palace which he had built next to the Liberian Basilica (S. Maria Maggiore). He was buried in the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore. His epitaph reads: \"Here lies Nicolas IV son of St. Francis\" (\"Hic requiescit / Nicolaus PP Quartus / Filius Beati Francisci\"). His death lies on Good Friday, being 2 days before Easter Sunday on 6 April 1292 (in the Julian calendar).\n\"Taxatio\".\nThe 1291\u201392 \"Taxatio\" he initiated, which was a detailed valuation for ecclesiastical taxation of English and Welsh parish churches and prebends, remains an important source document for the medieval period. An edition was reprinted by the Record Commission in 1802 as \"Taxatio Ecclesiastica Angliae et Walliae Auctoritate\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was one of the leading representatives of the Warsaw School of Mathematics. He worked as a professor at the University of Warsaw and at the Mathematical Institute of the Polish Academy of Sciences (IM PAN). Between 1946 and 1953, he served as President of the Polish Mathematical Society.\nHe is primarily known for his contributions to set theory, topology, measure theory and graph theory. Some of the notable mathematical concepts bearing Kuratowski's name include Kuratowski's theorem, Kuratowski closure axioms, Kuratowski-Zorn lemma and Kuratowski's intersection theorem.\nLife and career.\nEarly life.\nKazimierz Kuratowski was born in Warsaw, (then part of Congress Poland controlled by the Russian Empire), on 2 February 1896. He was a son of Marek Kuratow, a barrister, and R\u00f3\u017ca Karzewska. He completed a Warsaw secondary school, which was named after general Pawe\u0142 Chrzanowski. In 1913, he enrolled in an engineering course at the University of Glasgow in Scotland, in part because he did not wish to study in Russian; instruction in Polish was prohibited. He completed only one year of study when the outbreak of World War I precluded any further enrolment. In 1915, Russian forces withdrew from Warsaw and Warsaw University was reopened with Polish as the language of instruction. Kuratowski restarted his university education there the same year, this time in mathematics. He obtained his Ph.D. in 1921, in the newly established Second Polish Republic.\nDoctoral thesis.\nIn autumn 1921 Kuratowski was awarded the Ph.D. degree for his groundbreaking work. His thesis statement consisted of two parts. One was devoted to an axiomatic construction of topology via the closure axioms. This first part (republished in a slightly modified form in 1922) has been cited in hundreds of scientific articles.\nThe second part of Kuratowski's thesis was devoted to continua irreducible between two points. This was the subject of a French doctoral thesis written by Zygmunt Janiszewski. Since Janiszewski was deceased, Kuratowski's supervisor was Stefan Mazurkiewicz. Kuratowski's thesis solved certain problems in set theory raised by a Belgian mathematician, Charles-Jean \u00c9tienne Gustave Nicolas, Baron de la Vall\u00e9e Poussin.\nAcademic career until World War II.\nTwo years later, in 1923, Kuratowski was appointed deputy professor of mathematics at Warsaw University. He was then appointed a full professor of mathematics at Lw\u00f3w Polytechnic in Lw\u00f3w, in 1927. He was the head of the Mathematics department there until 1933. Kuratowski was also dean of the department twice. In 1929, Kuratowski became a member of the Warsaw Scientific Society\nWhile Kuratowski associated with many of the scholars of the Lw\u00f3w School of Mathematics, such as Stefan Banach and Stanislaw Ulam, and the circle of mathematicians based around the Scottish Caf\u00e9 he kept close connections with Warsaw. Kuratowski left Lw\u00f3w for Warsaw in 1934, before the famous Scottish Book was begun (in 1935), hence did not contribute any problems to it. He did however, collaborate closely with Banach in solving important problems in measure theory.\nIn 1934 he was appointed the professor at Warsaw University. A year later Kuratowski was nominated as the head of the Mathematics department there. From 1936 to 1939 he was secretary of the Mathematics Committee in The Council of Science and Applied Sciences.\nDuring and after the war.\nDuring World War II, he gave lectures at the underground university in Warsaw, since higher education for Poles was forbidden under German occupation.\nIn February 1945, Kuratowski started to lecture at the reopened Warsaw University. In 1945, he became a member of the Polish Academy of Learning, in 1946 he was appointed vice-president of the Mathematics department at Warsaw University, and from 1949 he was chosen to be the vice-president of Warsaw Scientific Society. In 1952 he became a member of the Polish Academy of Sciences, of which he was the vice-president from 1957 to 1968.\nAfter World War II, Kuratowski was actively involved in the rebuilding of scientific life in Poland. He helped to establish the State Institute of Mathematics, which was incorporated into the Polish Academy of Sciences in 1952. From 1948 until 1967 Kuratowski was director of the Institute of Mathematics of the Polish Academy of Sciences, and was also a long-time chairman of the Polish and International Mathematics Societies. He served as vice-president of the International Mathematical Union (1963\u20131966) as well as president of the Scientific Council of the State Institute of Mathematics (1968\u20131980). From 1948 to 1980 he was the head of the topology section. One of his students was Andrzej Mostowski.\nLegacy.\nKazimierz Kuratowski was one of a celebrated group of Polish mathematicians who would meet at Lw\u00f3w's Scottish Caf\u00e9. He was a president of the Polish Mathematical Society (PTM) and a member of the Warsaw Scientific Society (TNW). What is more, he was chief editor in \"Fundamenta Mathematicae\", a series of publications in \"Polish Mathematical Society Annals\". Furthermore, Kuratowski worked as an editor in the Polish Academy of Sciences Bulletin. He was also one of the writers of the Mathematical monographs, which were created in cooperation with the Institute of Mathematics of the Polish Academy of Sciences (IMPAN). High quality research monographs of the representatives of Warsaw's and Lw\u00f3w's School of Mathematics, which concerned all areas of pure and applied mathematics, were published in these volumes.\nKazimierz Kuratowski was an active member of many scientific societies and foreign scientific academies, including the Royal Society of Edinburgh, Austria, Germany, Hungary, Italy and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR).\nKazimierz Kuratowski Prize.\nIn 1981, IMPAN, the Polish Mathematical Society, and Kuratowski's daughter Zofia Kuratowska established a prize in his name, the Kuratowski Prize, for achievements in mathematics to people under the age of 30 years. The prize is considered the most prestigious of awards for young Polish mathematicians; past recipients have included J\u00f3zef H. Przytycki, Mariusz Lema\u0144czyk, Tomasz \u0141uczak, Miko\u0142aj Boja\u0144czyk, and Wojciech Samotij.\nResearch.\nKuratowski's research mainly focused on abstract topological and metric structures. He implemented the closure axioms (known in mathematical circles as the Kuratowski closure axioms). This was fundamental for the development of topological space theory and irreducible continuum theory between two points. The most valuable results, which were obtained by Kuratowski after the war are those that concern the relationship between topology and analytic functions (theory), and also research in the field of cutting Euclidean spaces. Together with Ulam, who was Kuratowski's most talented student during the Lw\u00f3w Period, he introduced the concept of so-called quasi homeomorphism that opened up a new field in topological studies.\nKuratowski's research in the field of measure theory, including research with Banach and Tarski, was continued by many students. Moreover, with Alfred Tarski and Wac\u0142aw Sierpi\u0144ski he provided most of the theory concerning Polish spaces (that are indeed named after these mathematicians and their legacy). Knaster and Kuratowski brought a comprehensive and precise study to connected components theory. It was applied to issues such as cutting-plane, with the paradoxical examples of connected components.\nKuratowski proved the Kuratowski-Zorn lemma (often called just Zorn's lemma) in 1922. This result has important connections to many basic theorems. Zorn gave its application in 1935. Kuratowski implemented many concepts in set theory and topology. In many cases, Kuratowski established new terminologies and symbolisms.\nHis contributions to mathematics include:\nKuratowski's post-war works were mainly focused on three strands:\nPublications.\nAmong over 170 published works are valuable monographs and books including Topologie (Vol. I, 1933, translated into English and Russian, and Vol. II, 1950) and Introduction to Set Theory and Topology (Vol. I, 1952, translated into English, French, Spanish, and Bulgarian). He authored \"A Half Century of Polish Mathematics 1920-1970: Remembrances and Reflections\" (1973) and \"Notes to his autobiography\" (1981). The latter was published posthumously thanks to Kuratowski's daughter Zofia Kuratowska, who prepared his notes for printing. Kazimierz Kuratowski represented Polish mathematics in the International Mathematical Union where he was vice president from 1963 to 1966. What is more, he participated in numerous international congresses and lectured at dozens of universities around the world. He was an honorary causa doctor at the Universities in Glasgow, Prague, Wroclaw, and Paris. He received the highest national awards, as well as a gold medal of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences, and the Polish Academy of Sciences. Kuratowski died on 18 June 1980 in Warsaw.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His pontificate was notable for the unrest in Rome associated with the Commune of Rome and its attempts to wrest control of the city from the papacy. He supported Empress Matilda's claim to the Kingdom of England in the Anarchy, and had a tense relationship with King Roger II of Sicily.\nEarly life.\nGherardo Caccianemici dal Orso, the son of Orso Caccianemici was born in Bologna. He was for many years a canon of the Basilica di San Frediano before his elevation by Pope Honorius II to cardinal priest of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme in 1124. During this time there he renovated the basilica, attached a body of regular canons and improved its revenue stream. After his election as pope, he presented to the church a copy of the Gospels bound with plates of gold and adorned with jewels, as well as an altar-cover and two chased silver-gilt ampullae for use at Mass. Honorius also appointed him the librarian of the Diocese of Rome before appointing him papal legate in Germany in 1125. While there, he helped support the candidacy of Holy Roman Emperor Lothair III as well as appointing Saint Norbert of Xanten as the Archbishop of Magdeburg. In 1128, Gherardo was sent to Benevento to govern the city, which had overthrown the previous rector.\nIn 1130 he was again appointed legate to Germany by Pope Innocent II, where he was instrumental in convincing Lothair III to make two expeditions to Italy for the purpose of protecting Pope Innocent II against the Antipope Anacletus II. He had a further period as legate to Germany in 1135\u201336. He was one of the principal negotiators with Lothair III in attempting to force the monks of Monte Cassino to submit themselves to the authority of the papacy. In addition, he was sent to Salerno to negotiate the end of the schism involving Anacletus II with King Roger II of Sicily. As a principal supporter of Pope Innocent II, the pope rewarded him for his efforts by appointing him papal chancellor. After the papal election of 1144, Gherardo was elected as Lucius II and consecrated on 12 March 1144. He probably took his name in honor of Pope Lucius I, who was commemorated a few days prior to Gherardo's consecration.\nPontificate.\nRelations with England and Portugal.\nLucius was involved in the usual running of church business throughout medieval Christendom. In England, he granted a number of privileges to bishops, monasteries and churches, including exempting the monastery of St. Edmund from all subjection to the secular authorities. He also dispatched a papal legate, Igmarus (or Hincmar), to England, charged to investigate the request of Bernard, Bishop of St David's, to elevate his see to the rank of metropolitan bishop, and to take the pallium to Archbishop William of York. Regarding the political situation in England, he took the side of the Empress Matilda over the rights to the English crown.\nEarly in his reign, Lucius received a request from prominent members of the town of Lucca to become the suzerain of the castle within the town in order to protect it from the war between Lucca and Pisa. Lucius received it on 18 March 1144 and, for a payment of ten pounds of gold, agreed to defend it on his behalf. Lucius then returned the castle to them as a fief.\nMeanwhile, in Portugal, King Afonso I, eager to maintain the newly established independence of Portugal from the Kingdom of Le\u00f3n, offered to do homage to Lucius, as he had done to Pope Innocent II, and to make the pope the feudal suzerain of his lands. He offered Lucius his territory and a yearly tribute of four ounces of gold in exchange for the defence and support of the Apostolic See. Although Lucius accepted Afonso's feudal homage on 1 May 1144, and excused him from appearing in person, he did not acknowledge Afonso as King of Portugal, but instead as \"Dux Portugallensis\". The royal title would eventually be conferred by Pope Alexander III.\nFinally, the city of Corneto, formally belonging to the Papal States, was restored to the papacy during Lucius\u2019 pontificate by a formal deed on 20 November 1144.\nConflict with Roger II of Sicily.\nAlthough Lucius had been the friend of King Roger II of Sicily and godparent to one of his children, the situation between the two deteriorated. The two parties met at Ceprano in June 1144 to clarify the duties of Roger as a vassal of the Holy See. Lucius demanded the return of the principality of Capua, while Roger instead wanted additional territory that formed part of the Papal States in the south. Lucius II, on the advice of his cardinals, was unwilling to accept Roger's demands and rejected them. Infuriated, King Roger returned to Sicily and asked his son Duke Roger III of Apulia to invade Campania. Duke Roger did as he was asked, and sent his general Robert of Selby against Lucius, ravaging the country as far north as Ferentino. This forced the Romans to capitulate, and in September 1144, Lucius agreed to Roger's terms, negotiating a seven-year truce. The Normans in return withdrew back to their conquered territories and promised not to attack Benevento or any other papal territory.\nEmergence of the Roman Commune.\nThis surrender on the part of Lucius II gave an opportunity for members of the Roman Senate to reassert their ancient independence and authority and to erect a revolutionary republic at Rome which sought to deprive the pope of his temporal power. The principal groups involved in this movement were the merchants and artisans, while the urban nobility kept their neutrality.\nThe Senate, which practically took all temporal power from the pope during the pontificate of Innocent II, had been managed with considerable skill and firmness by Lucius at the beginning of his pontificate, convincing many senators to either leave the Capitoline Hill or to lay down their magisterium. Now, encouraged by Lucius II's defeat, the Senate, led by Giordano Pierleoni, brother of the former Antipope Anacletus II, rebelled against Lucius II, driving out the papal prefects and establishing the Commune of Rome. They demanded the pope abandon all governmental duties, and that he would retain only ecclesiastical taxes and voluntary tributes. The Senate took over powers to elect magistrates and strike its own coinage. At first, Lucius asked for Roger II's aid, but Roger, still annoyed that Lucius had not fully recognised his kingship, withheld his assistance. Lucius then turned for help to Conrad, King of the Romans, and on December 1144 wrote to him pleading for military assistance against the Senate and the Patrician Giordano Pierleoni. Lucius was supported by Bernard of Clairvaux, who also wrote to Conrad, asking for him to intervene.\nWhile waiting for Conrad's reply, Lucius decided to take matters into his own hands. Turning to the Roman aristocracy, in particular the Frangipani family, he gave them the fortress of the Circus Maximus on 31 January 1145, allowing them complete control of the southern portion of the Palatine Hill. The Roman Forum had become a battleground, and the confusion prevented Lucius from travelling to the Aventine Hill to ordain the abbot of San Saba on 20 January 1145.\nFinally, Lucius marched against the Senatorial positions on the Capitol with a small army. He was driven back by Giordano, and according to Godfrey of Viterbo, he was seriously injured during this battle (by a thrown stone). He did not recover from his injuries and died on 15 February 1145 at San Gregorio Magno al Celio, where he was under the protection of the neighbouring Frangipani fortress.\nLucius II was buried at St John Lateran in the circular portico behind the apse. His heraldic badge was a shield of argent, with a bear rampant of proper sable.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They are present on flies belonging to two orders, Diptera and Strepsiptera. In dipterans, the halteres evolved from a pair of ancestral hindwings, while males of the much smaller strepsiterans (stylops) have halteres evolved from a pair of ancestral forewings.\nHalteres oscillate rapidly along with the wings and operate like vibrating structure gyroscopes: any rotation of the plane of oscillation causes a force on the vibrating halteres by the Coriolis effect. The insect detects this force with sensory organs called campaniform sensilla and chordotonal organs located at the base of the halteres and uses this information to interpret and correct its position in space. Halteres provide rapid feedback to the wing-steering muscles, as well as to the muscles responsible for stabilizing the head.\nBackground.\nThe majority of insects have two pairs of wings. Flies possess only one set of lift-generating wings and one set of halteres. The order name for flies, \"Diptera\", literally means \"two wings\", but there is another order of insect which has evolved flight with only two wings: strepsipterans, or stylops; they are the only other organisms that possess two wings and two halteres. The strepsipterans have adapted their forewings into halteres, whereas dipterans have adapted their hindwings into halteres. This unique structure which detects rotations/perturbations during flight has never been described in nature elsewhere, though many flying insects have been shown to detect Coriolis forces from their non-specialised wings.\nHalteres are able to sense small deviations in body position using the gyroscopic properties of moving mass. What this means is that halteres beat up and down in time with the flapping of the wings along a linear pathway, but when the fly's body begins to rotate, the path of the beating halteres also changes. Now, instead of the halteres following a linear path, they begin to follow a curved path. The larger the perturbation they experience, the farther the halteres move from their original linear path. During these periods, the haltere is no longer moving in only two directions (up and down), but four (up, down, left, and right). The force exerted on the halteres in response to this left right movement is known as Coriolis force and can be produced when any moving object is rotated in the three directions of rotation, yaw, pitch or roll (see figure). When this occurs, tiny bell-shaped structures at the base of the haltere experience strain as the haltere stalk bends in their direction. The nervous system can then transform the bending of these hairs into electrical signals, which the fly interprets as body rotation information. The fly uses this information to make corrections to its position and thereby restabilizes itself during flight. Further details explaining the dynamics and physiology of halteres are described below.\nHalteres are typically only associated with flight stabilization, but their ability to detect body rotations can elicit compensatory reactions not only from the wing steering muscles, but also from neck muscles which are responsible for head position and gaze. Halteres may also be useful for other behaviors. Certain species of flies have been observed to oscillate their halteres while walking in addition to oscillating them during flight. In these individuals, halteres could thus be detecting sensory information during walking behavior as well. When the halteres are removed, these insects perform more poorly at certain walking challenges. However, how haltere information is processed and used during walking remains, with few exceptions, unclear. Specific examples of what has been found are described below.\nHistory.\nHalteres were first documented by William Derham in 1714. He discovered that flies were unable to remain airborne when their halteres were surgically removed, but otherwise behaved normally. This result was initially attributed to the haltere's ability to sense and maintain equilibrium. In 1917 v. Buddenbrock asserted that something else was responsible for the flies' loss of flight ability. He claimed that the halteres should instead be considered \"stimulation organs\". In other words, that the activity of the halteres energized the wing muscular system, so that they acted as an on/off switch for flight. V. Buddenbrock attempted to show that activation of the halteres would stimulate the central nervous system into a state of activity which allowed the wings to produce flight behavior. It has since been concluded that this is not in fact true, and that the original assertion that halteres act as balance organs is the correct one. V. Buddenbrock was able to show that immediately after haltere removal flies were unable to produce normal wing movements. This was later explained by the fact that allowing flies a few minutes recovery time post-surgery resulted in total recovery of normal flight muscle control. Further, in an interesting side experiment performed by Pringle (1938), when a thread was attached to the abdomen of haltereless flies, relatively stable flight was again achieved. The thread in these experiments presumably aided in keeping the fly from rotating (similar to the way a heavy basket below a hot air balloon prevents the balloon from tipping), which supported the hypothesis that halteres are responsible for sensing body rotations.\nThe original balancer theory, which was postulated by Pringle (1948), only accounted for forces produced in two directions. Pringle claimed that yaw was the only direction of rotation that flies used their halteres to detect. Using high speed video analysis, Faust (1952) demonstrated that this was not the case and that halteres are capable of detecting all three directions of rotation. In response to this new discovery, Pringle reexamined his previous assumption and came to the conclusion that flies were capable of detecting all three directions of rotation simply by comparing inputs from the left and right sides of the body. Of course, this is not the actual mechanism by which flies detect rotation. Different fields of sensory organs located in different regions at the base of each haltere detect the different directions of rotation, which also explains why flies with one haltere are still able to fly without issue.\nEvolution.\nIt is generally accepted that the halteres evolved from the non-flight wings of insects \u2013 the hind-wings of Diptera and the fore wings of Strepsiptera respectively. Their movement, structure, function and development all support this hypothesis. Characterizations of the arrangement of sensory organs known as campaniform sensilla, found at the base of the haltere, show many similarities to those found at the base of the hindwings in other insects. The sensilla are arranged in a way so similar to that of hindwings, that were the halteres to be replaced with wings, the forces produced would still be sufficient to activate the same sensory organs. Genetic studies have also brought to light many similarities between fly halteres and hindwings. In fact, fly haltere development has been traced back to a single gene (Ubx), which when deactivated results in the formation of a hindwing instead. Because just a single gene is responsible for this change, it is easy to imagine a small mutation here leading to the formation of the first halteres.\nConvergent evolution.\nThough no other structure with entirely the same function and morphology as halteres has been observed in nature, they have evolved at least twice in the class Insecta, once in the order Diptera and again in Strepsiptera. Another structure in the class Insecta also exists whose primary function is not the same as halteres, but that additionally serves a similar balancing function. This occurs in the order Lepidoptera and refers to the antennae of moths and butterflies.\nStrepsipteran haltere.\nStrepsipterans are a unique group of insects with major sexual dimorphism. The females spend their entire lives in a grub-like state, parasitizing larger insects. The only time they ever come out of their host insect is to extend their fused heads and thoraces for males to notice. The males are also parasites, but they eventually will leave their host to seek their female counterparts. Because of this, they still retain the ability to fly. Male strepsipterans uniquely possess two hindwings, while their forewings have taken on the club-like form of halteres. Though strepsipterans are very difficult to locate and are additionally rather short-lived, Pix \"et al.\" (1993) confirmed that the specialized forewings that male Strepsiptera possess perform the same function as dipteran halteres. Rotational movements of the body combined with the oscillating halteres produce Coriolis forces that can be detected by fields of mechanosensors (campaniform sensilla) located at the base of the halteres. Using functional morphology and behavior studies, Pix \"et al.\" showed that these sensors then transmit body position information to the head and abdomen to produce compensatory movements. For simplicity, the remainder of this article will refer only to dipteran halteres.\nLepidopteran antennae.\nCertain lepidopterans (moths and butterflies) exhibit small amplitude oscillation of their antennae at constant angles during flight. Antennal movements in lepidopterans were originally hypothesized to aid in wind or gravity perception. A study performed using the hawk moth, \"Manduca sexta\", confirmed that these tiny, antennal oscillations were actually contributing to body rotation sensation.\nSane \"et al.\" (2007) determined that antennae were responsible for flight stabilization in hawk moths by removing the long part of the antenna (the flagellum), then reattaching it to determine its influence on flight performance. When the flagella were removed, the moths were no longer able to maintain stable flight. After reattachment of the flagella, flight performance was restored. The source of this difference was determined to be mechanosensory. There are two sets of mechanosensory organs located at the base of the lepidopteran antenna, B\u00f6hm's bristles and the Johnston organ. These fields of receptors respond to different directions of antennal movements. Antennae are also capable of sensing odor, humidity, and temperature. Sane \"et al.\" (2007) was able to demonstrate that it was the mechanosensors that were responsible for flight stability as opposed to the other sensory organs, because when the flagella were removed and then reattached, all antennal nerves were severed excluding those at the base (B\u00f6hm's bristles and the Johnston organ).\nGenetics.\nIn segmented organisms there are genes called Hox genes, which determine the development of serial homologs, or repeating structures within an organism (e.g. jointed appendages of arthropods or vertebrae in mammals). In insects, the thorax is separated into different segments. One of the things that the Hox gene \"Ultrabithorax (Ubx)\" is responsible for, is specifying the identity of the third thoracic segment of their body. Proper hindwing development in a number of insect species is dependent on \"Ubx\", including butterflies, beetles, and flies. In fruit flies, (\"Ubx\") is responsible for the formation of the halteres during metamorphosis. If this gene is experimentally deactivated, the haltere will develop into a fully formed wing. This single homeotic gene change results in a radically different phenotype, but also begins to give us some insight into how the ancestors of flies' hindwings may have originally evolved into halteres.\nThough it is clear that \"Ubx\" is the primary gene responsible for hindwing formation, Ubx also regulates other genes once expressed. Weatherbee (1998) postulated that differences in \"Ubx\" expression patterns or levels may not be responsible for the observed physiological changes. Instead, he suggested that \"Ubx\"-regulated target gene sets were the direct source of the observed changes. Several \"Ubx\"-regulated target genes have been identified, including two direct targets, \"spalt\" and \"knot\", which are expressed in the wing and repressed in halteres, and which are not affected by extradenticle. Other genes which are expressed in wings and repressed in halteres have also been identified, but whether or not they act as direct targets of \"Ubx\" regulation are still unknown.\nDynamics.\nDipteran insects along with the majority of other insect orders use what are known as indirect flight muscles to accomplish flight. Indirect insect flight muscles are composed of two sets of perpendicular muscles (see left figure) that are attached to the thorax (instead of directly to the wing base as is the case for direct flight muscles). When the first set of muscles contracts, they deform the body of the insect and compress its thorax vertically, which lifts the wings. When the first set of muscles relaxes and the second set contracts, the thorax is squeezed in the opposite direction, which extends the body vertically and moves the wings downward. The below figure demonstrates this movement with only the first set of muscles.\nThe movement of the wings and the halteres are mechanically coupled. Sane \"et al.\" (2015) demonstrated that in freshly killed flies, without any neural input, the movement of wings was still coupled with the movement of halteres. When a forcep was used to manually move a wing up and down, not only did the opposite wing move in synchrony, the halteres also beat in antiphase with both wings. The source of this coupling however, was not between the muscles which control the halteres and those that control the wings. Instead, two small ridges of cuticle known as the subepimeral ridges were found to be responsible. These ridges connect the right wing to the right haltere and the left wing to the left haltere.\nEach side of the body must be synchronized and the two sides are also coupled. That is, the left and right wings and thus the left and right halteres always beat at the same frequency. However, the amplitude of the wingbeat does not always have to be the same on the left and right side. This is what allows the flies to turn and is accomplished using a gearbox, much like what you would find in an automobile. This gearbox can change the maximum amplitude of the wing movement and determine its speed of motion. The wings of flies even have a clutch structure at their base. The clutch moves between grooves in the gearbox, to engage and disengage the wing muscles and also modulate the wingbeat amplitude. When the amplitude of the left wing is less than the right, the fly will make a left turn. Even though haltere movement is controlled by separate muscles than the wings, because the wings are mechanically coupled with the halteres, changes in wingbeat frequency extend to the haltere-beat frequency as well, but haltere beat amplitude does not change.\nAlthough halteres are coupled with the wings and with each other during flight, some flies oscillate their halteres while walking (without oscillating their wings). Because the haltere muscles are tiny in comparison to the flight muscles, flight muscle activity completely overshadows that of the haltere muscles during flight. It is unknown how haltere muscle activity during flight differs from walking. The left and right halteres show much more variable phase relationships while walking compared with flying, which may indicate decoupling of the left and right haltere muscles.\nDifferences between species.\nAlthough halteres are always synchronized with the movements of the wings, the phase at which they oscillate differs between species. Brachyceran flies (short-antennaed) oscillate their halteres almost exactly opposite their wings (180 degrees). More ancient suborders such as the Nematocerans (long-antennaed flies), which for example include crane flies and mosquitoes, exhibit a variety of wing-haltere phasing. These observed differences in wing-haltere coordination suggest that differences in sensory neuron output also exist between species. This means that the decoding mechanisms used by the central nervous system to interpret such movements and produce adequate motor output probably also vary depending on phylogeny.\nMorphology.\nThe general structure of halteres are well recognized, but much variability exists between species. The more ancient family groups, such as Tipuloidea (crane flies), possess halteres with rather long stalks. This causes the haltere bulbs to be much further from the body and easily visible to the naked eye. More derived families, such as Calliphoridae (blow flies), have developed specialized structures called \"calyptrae\" or \"squama\", which are tiny flaps of wing, that cover the haltere. Pringle (1948) hypothesized that they prevented wind turbulence from affecting haltere movements, allowing more precise detection of body position, but this was never tested. The stalk of the haltere is also not always straight. Instead, the stalk's shape in more derived families tends to be reflective of the body shape of the individual. This minimizes the amount of air space between end-knobs and the sides of the abdomen and thorax. In these families, the halteres beat so close to the body that the distance between haltere and thorax is a fraction of the diameter of the haltere bulb. An extreme example of this trait is in the family Syrphidae (hoverflies), where the bulb of the haltere is positioned nearly perpendicular to the stalk.\nFlies typically hold their halteres at a 90-degree offset. To visualize this, if you were to imagine a person holding their arms out sideways, this would be a 180-degree offset. If that person then moved their arms backward so that the angle created between their fingertips and spine was 90 degrees, this would be a 90-degree offset. The halteres of flies work the same way. They are positioned behind their bodies, forming a 90-degree angle between the haltere bulbs and the center of their thorax. It is necessary for the halteres to be positioned like this in order to detect the three axes of motion. Those axes are yaw, pitch and roll, as illustrated in the above figure (Directions of rotation). The mechanoreceptors at the base of the halteres are only able to measure force in two directions (horizontal and vertical), so a single haltere is only able to measure rotations along two of the three axes. Because the halteres are set at different angles (90-degree offset), they also beat along two separate horizontal and vertical axes. This gives them the ability to acquire information from two non-parallel planes and allows sensation of rotation in all three directions. However, flies are most sensitive to pitch.\nNeurophysiology.\nWhen halteres are experimentally induced to flap, volleys of action potentials within the haltere nerve occur in synchrony with the haltere-beat frequency. When flies are then rotated, these volleys break down, likely in response to different groups of sensilla being activated to inform the fly of its recently changed body position. Haltere afferents have also been shown to terminate in the mesothoracic neuropil where flight muscle neurons are located. Haltere afferent activity responding to rotations and wing steering behavior converge in this processing region.\nThe haltere nerve.\nSensory inputs from five sensory fields located at the base of the haltere all converge onto one nerve, the haltere nerve. How these sensory fields are organized at the level of the central nervous system is currently unknown. It has been determined that those five sensory fields all project to the thorax in a \"region-specific\" way and afferents originating from the forewing were also shown to converge in the same regions. Not every specific target for the haltere afferents have been determined, but a few connections between motor neurons known to be involved in wing steering control and particular haltere sensory fields have been identified, particularly one synapse between the haltere nerve and a wing steering motor neuron known as mnb1.\nMuscles.\nFlies use indirect flight muscles to accomplish wing movement, and the beating haltere movements are driven by the same group of muscles (see dynamics section). In addition to the indirect flight muscles which are responsible for the flapping motion, there are also steering muscle which control the rotation/angle of the wings. Because fly halteres evolved from hindwings, the same complement of steering muscles exists for the other directions of movement as well. Chan \"et al.\" (1998) identified 10 direct control muscles in the haltere similar to those found in the forewing. In 1998, Chan and Dickinson proposed that the planned haltere movements (without external forces acting on them) were what initiated planned turns. To explain this, imagine a fly that wishes to turn to the right. Unfortunately, as soon as it does, the halteres sense a body rotation and reflexively correct the turn, preventing the fly from changing direction. Chan and Dickinson (1998) suggested that what the fly does to prevent this from occurring is to first move its halteres as if it were being pushed in the opposite direction that it wants to go. The fly has not moved, but the halteres have sensed a perturbation. This would allow the haltere-initiated reflex to occur, correcting the imagined perturbation. The fly would then be able to execute its turn in the desired direction. This is not how flies actually turn. Mureli and Fox (2015) showed that flies are still capable of performing planned turns even when their halteres have been removed entirely.\nCampaniform sensilla.\nThe way in which rotation sensation is accomplished is that there are five distinct sensory fields located at the base of the haltere. These fields, which actually contain the majority of campaniform sensilla found on the exoskeleton of blowflies (more than 400 campaniform sensilla per haltere), are activated in response to strain created by movements at the haltere base in different directions (due to Coriolis forces acting on the end knobs). Campaniform sensilla are cap-shaped protrusions located on the surface of the exoskeleton (cuticle) of insects. Attached inside the cap is the tip of a dendritic projection (or sensory nerve fiber). The outer segment of the dendritic projection is attached to the inside surface of the cap. When the haltere is pushed to one side, the cuticle of the insect bends and the surface of the cap is distorted. The inner dendrite is able to detect this distortion and convert it to an electrical signal which is sent to the central nervous system to be interpreted.\nChordotonal organs.\nChordotonal organs detect and transmit distortions in their position/shape in the same way that campaniform sensilla do. They differ slightly at their site of detection. Chordotonal organs, unlike campaniform sensilla, exist beneath the cuticle and typically respond to stretch as opposed to distortion or bending. Their sensory nerve endings attach between two internal points and when those points are stretched, the difference in length is what is detected and transformed into electrical signaling. There are far fewer chordotonal organs at the base of the haltere than campaniform sensilla (on the order of hundreds), so it is assumed that they are far less important for detecting and transmitting rotational information from haltere movements.\nRole in visual processing.\nHead stabilization.\nInsect eyes are unable to move independently of the head. In order for flies to stabilize their visual fields, they must adjust the position of their entire head. Sensory inputs detected by halteres not only determine the position of the body, but also, the position of the head, which can move independently from the body. Halteres are particularly useful for detecting fast perturbations during flight and only respond to angular velocities (speeds of rotation) above a certain threshold. When flies are focused on an object in front of them and their body is rotated, they are able to maintain their head position so that the object remains focused and upright. Hengstenberg (1988) found that in the roll direction of rotation, the flies' ability to maintain their head position in response to body motion was only observed at speeds above 50 degrees per second and their ability peaked at 1500 degrees per second. When halteres were removed at the bulb (to retain intact sensory organs at the base) the fly's ability to perceive roll movements at high angular velocities disappeared.\nHalteres and vision both play a role in stabilizing the head. Flies are also able to perform compensatory head movements to stabilize their vision without the use of their halteres. When the visual field is artificially rotated around a fly at slower angular velocities, head stabilization still occurs. Head stabilization outputs due to optical inputs alone are slower to respond, but also last longer than those due to haltere inputs. From this result it can be concluded that although halteres are required for detecting fast rotations, the visual system is adept by itself at sensing and correcting for slower body movements. Thus, the visual and mechanosensory (halteres) systems work together to stabilize the visual field of the animal: first, by quickly responding to fast changes (halteres), and second, by maintaining that response until it is corrected (vision).\nVisual-motor integration.\nFlies rely on both visual information from their compound eyes and mechanical input from their halteres. Sherman and Dickinson (2002) discovered that the responsiveness of the halteres and eyes are tuned to complementary speeds of rotation. Responses to body rotations detected via the visual system are greatest at slow speeds and decrease with increased angular velocity. In contrast, body rotations detected by the halteres elicit the greatest responses at higher angular velocities and degrade as the speed of rotation decreases. The integration of these two separately tuned sensors allows the flies to detect a wide range of angular velocities in all three directions of rotation.\nTwo main aspects of the visual field have been used to study fly vision, figure and background. Figures are the objects that the fly is focused on and background represents everything else. When haltere bulbs are removed from tethered flying flies, they are still able to track moving figures, but they struggle to stabilize moving backgrounds. If a static figure is placed in the field of view of a fly, its ability to stabilize a moving background is restored. This indicates that although halteres are not required for motion vision processing, they do contribute to it in a context-dependent manner, even when the behavior is separated from body rotations. Context determines whether the fly will use its halteres or vision as the primary source of body/head position information.\nNon-flying haltere activity.\nThe necessity of halteres in flight has been well documented, yet little is known about their use in other behaviors such as walking. Certain flies in the families Muscidae, Anthomyiidae, Calliphoridae, Sarcophagidae, Tachinidae, and Micropezidae have been documented to oscillate their wings while walking in addition to during flight. The oscillation of the haltere is similar in amplitude and frequency during walking and flight for these flies, and the halteres always oscillate when walking or when flying. All other families of Diptera never oscillate their halteres while walking, but always do so while flying. Flesh flies are among those that oscillate their halteres while walking, and also perform more poorly at certain walking tasks when their halteres are removed. In contrast, fruit flies, which do not oscillate their halteres when walking, do not exhibit any differences in ability when their halteres are removed. This indicates that haltere inputs are behaviorally relevant to those species which oscillate them while walking and that they aid those individuals in walking behavior. Flies in the Calyptratae clade which include common flies like house flies, blow flies, and flesh flies also use their halteres during takeoff, whereas non-Calyptratae flies do not. Calyptratae flies are able to take off around five times faster than other flies. Calyptratae flies lacking halteres take a lot longer to become airborne, but takeoff time is not affected in non-Calyptratae flies without halteres. Stability during takeoff also suffers with haltere removal, but only in Calyptratae flies.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It last appeared in the inner parts of the Solar System in 1986 and will next appear in mid-2061. Officially designated 1P/Halley, it is also commonly called Comet Halley, or sometimes simply Halley. \nHalley's periodic returns to the inner Solar System have been observed and recorded by astronomers around the world since at least 240 BC, but it was not until 1705 that the English astronomer Edmond Halley understood that these appearances were re-appearances of the same comet. As a result of this discovery, the comet is named after Halley.\nIn March 1986, during its latest visit to the inner Solar System, Halley's Comet became the first comet to be observed in detail by a spacecraft, ESA's \"Giotto\" mission, providing the first observational data on the structure of a comet nucleus and the mechanism of coma and tail formation. These observations supported several longstanding hypotheses about comet construction, particularly Fred Whipple's \"dirty snowball\" model, which correctly predicted that Halley would be composed of a mixture of volatile ices\u2014such as water, carbon dioxide, ammonia\u2014and dust. The missions also provided data that substantially reformed and reconfigured these ideas; for instance, it is now understood that the surface of Halley is largely composed of dusty, non-volatile materials, and that only a small portion of it is icy. It was also visited by the two spacecrafts of the Vega program, Vega 1 &amp; 2, on 6 and 9 March, respectively. They went as close as 8,890 km (5,520 mi), and 8,030\u00a0km (4,990 mi), providing data on Halley's dimensions, shape, temperature, and surface properties.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPronunciation.\nComet Halley is usually pronounced , rhyming with \"valley\", or sometimes , rhyming with \"daily\". As to the surname Halley, Colin Ronan, one of Edmond Halley's biographers, preferred , rhyming with \"crawly\". Spellings of Halley's name during his lifetime included \"Hailey\", \"Haley\", \"Hayley\", \"Halley\", \"Haly\", \"Hawley\", and \"Hawly\", so its contemporary pronunciation is uncertain, but the version rhyming with \"valley\" seems to be preferred by modern bearers of the surname.\nComputation of orbit.\nHalley was the first comet to be recognised as periodic. Until the Renaissance, the philosophical consensus on the nature of comets, promoted by Aristotle, was that they were disturbances in Earth's atmosphere. This idea was disproven in 1577 by Tycho Brahe, who used parallax measurements to show that comets must lie beyond the Moon. Many were still unconvinced that comets orbited the Sun, and assumed instead that they must follow straight paths through the Solar System. In 1687, Sir Isaac Newton published his \"Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica\", in which he outlined his laws of gravity and motion. His work on comets was decidedly incomplete. Although he had suspected that two comets that had appeared in succession in 1680 and 1681 were the same comet before and after passing behind the Sun (he was later found to be correct; see Newton's Comet), he was initially unable to completely reconcile comets into his model.\nUltimately it was Newton's friend, editor and publisher, Edmond Halley, who, in his 1705 \"Synopsis of the Astronomy of Comets\", used Newton's new laws to calculate the gravitational effects of Jupiter and Saturn on cometary orbits. Having compiled a list of 24 comet observations, he calculated that the orbital elements of a second comet that had appeared in 1682 were nearly the same as those of two comets that had appeared in 1531 (observed by Petrus Apianus) and 1607 (observed by Johannes Kepler). Halley thus concluded that all three comets were the same object returning about every 76 years, a period that has since been found to vary between 72 and 80 years. After a rough estimate of the perturbations the comet would sustain from the gravitational attraction of the planets, he predicted its return for 1758. He personally observed the comet around perihelion in September 1682, but died in 1742 before he could observe its predicted return.\nHalley's prediction of the comet's return proved to be correct, although it was not seen until 25 December 1758, by Johann Georg Palitzsch, a German farmer and amateur astronomer. Other observers from throughout Europe and its colonies sent confirmations to Paris after the comet brightened early the following year. In the Americas, John Winthrop lectured at Harvard University to explain the implications of the comet's reappearance for Newtonian mechanics and natural theology.\nAnother independent recognition that the comet had returned was made by the Jamaican astronomer Francis Williams, but his observations did not reach Europe. A unique portrait commissioned by Williams demonstrates the impact of the comet's return on period astronomers. Williams' hand rests on page 521 of the third edition of Newton's \"Principia\" with procedures to predict comet sightings. The white smudge in the sky is probably a depiction of Halley's comet relative to the constellations in March 1759, and the chord hanging above the book likely represents the comet's orbit. In 2024, using X-ray imaging, the painting was shown to depict the field of stars in which the comet would have been visible in 1759. Williams likely commissioned the portrait to commemorate his observations.\nThe comet did not pass through its perihelion until 13 March 1759, the attraction of Jupiter and Saturn having caused a delay of 618 days. This effect was computed before its return (with a one-month error to 13 April) by a team of three French mathematicians, Alexis Clairaut, Joseph Lalande, and Nicole-Reine Lepaute. The confirmation of the comet's return was the first time anything other than planets had been shown to orbit the Sun. It was also one of the earliest successful tests of Newtonian physics, and a clear demonstration of its explanatory power. The comet was first named in Halley's honour by French astronomer Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille in 1759.\nSome scholars have proposed that first-century Mesopotamian astronomers already had recognised Halley's Comet as periodic. This theory notes a passage in the Babylonian Talmud, tractate Horayot that refers to \"a star which appears once in seventy years that makes the captains of the ships err\". It has also been suggested that the passage may have referred to the variable star Mira, whose brightness oscillates with a period of sixty years.\nResearchers in 1981 attempting to calculate the past orbits of Halley by numerical integration starting from accurate observations in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries could not produce accurate results further back than 837 owing to a close approach to Earth in that year. It was necessary to use ancient Chinese comet observations to constrain their calculations.\nOrbit and origin.\nHalley's orbital period has varied between 74 and 80 years since 240 BC. Its orbit around the Sun is highly elliptical, with an orbital eccentricity of 0.967 (with 0 being a circle and 1 being a parabolic trajectory). The perihelion, the point in the comet's orbit when it is nearest the Sun, is . This is between the orbits of Mercury and Venus. Its aphelion, or farthest distance from the Sun, is , roughly the orbital distance of Pluto. Unlike the overwhelming majority of objects in the Solar System, Halley's orbit is retrograde; it orbits the Sun in the opposite direction to the planets, or, clockwise from above the Sun's north pole. The orbit is inclined by 18\u00b0 to the ecliptic, with much of it lying south of the ecliptic. This is usually represented as 162\u00b0, to account for Halley's retrograde orbit. The 1910 passage was at a relative velocity of . Because its orbit comes close to Earth's in two places, Halley is associated with two meteor showers: the Eta Aquariids in early May, and the Orionids in late October.\nHalley is classified as a \"periodic\" or \"short-period comet\": one with an orbit lasting 200 years or less. This contrasts it with long-period comets, whose orbits last for thousands of years. Periodic comets have an average inclination to the ecliptic of only ten degrees, and an orbital period of just 6.5 years, so Halley's orbit is atypical. Most short-period comets (those with orbital periods shorter than 20 years and inclinations of 30 degrees or less) are called Jupiter-family comets. Those resembling Halley, with orbital periods of between 20 and 200 years and inclinations extending from zero to more than 90 degrees, are called Halley-type comets. As of 2024[ [update]], 105 Halley-type comets have been observed, compared with 816 identified Jupiter-family comets.\nThe orbits of the Halley-type comets suggest that they were originally long-period comets whose orbits were perturbed by the gravity of the giant planets and directed into the inner Solar System. If Halley was once a long-period comet, it is likely to have originated in the Oort cloud, a sphere of cometary bodies around 20,000\u201350,000 au from the Sun. Conversely the Jupiter-family comets are generally believed to originate in the Kuiper belt, a flat disc of icy debris between 30 au (Neptune's orbit) and 50 au from the Sun (in the scattered disc). Another point of origin for the Halley-type comets was proposed in 2008, when a trans-Neptunian object with a retrograde orbit similar to Halley's was discovered, , whose orbit takes it from just outside that of Uranus to twice the distance of Pluto. It may be a member of a new population of small Solar System bodies that serves as the source of Halley-type comets.\nHalley has probably been in its current orbit for 16,000\u2013200,000 years, although it is not possible to numerically integrate its orbit for more than a few tens of apparitions, and close approaches before 837 AD can only be verified from recorded observations. The non-gravitational effects can be crucial; as Halley approaches the Sun, it expels jets of sublimating gas from its surface, which knock it very slightly off its orbital path. These orbital changes cause delays in its perihelion passage of four days on average.\nIn 1989 Boris Chirikov and Vitold Vecheslavov performed an analysis of 46 apparitions of Halley's Comet taken from historical records and computer simulations, which showed that its dynamics were chaotic and unpredictable on long timescales. Halley's projected dynamical lifetime is estimated to be about 10\u00a0million years. The dynamics of its orbit can be approximately described by a two-dimensional symplectic map, known as the Kepler map, a solution to the restricted three-body problem for highly eccentric orbits. Based on records from the 1910 apparition, David Hughes calculated in 1985 that Halley's nucleus has been reduced in mass by 80 to 90% over the last 2,000 to 3,000 revolutions, and that it will most likely disappear completely after another 2,300 perihelion passages. More recent work suggests that Halley will evaporate, or split in two, within the next few tens of thousands of years, or will be ejected from the Solar System within a few hundred thousand years.\nStructure and composition.\nThe \"Giotto\" and \"Vega\" missions gave planetary scientists their first view of Halley's surface and structure. The nucleus is a conglomerate of ices and dust, often referred to as a \"dirty snowball\". Like all comets, as Halley nears the Sun, its volatile compounds (those with low boiling points, such as water, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and other ices) begin to sublimate from the surface. This causes the comet to develop a coma, or atmosphere, at distances up to from the nucleus. Sublimation of this dirty ice releases dust particles, which travel with the gas away from the nucleus. Gas molecules in the coma absorb solar light and then re-radiate it at different wavelengths, while dust particles scatter the solar light, making the coma visible. As a fraction of the gas molecules in the coma are ionised by the solar ultraviolet radiation, pressure from the solar wind, a stream of charged particles emitted by the Sun, pulls the coma's ions out into a long tail, which may extend more than 100\u00a0million\u00a0kilometres into space. Changes in the flow of the solar wind can cause disconnection events, in which the tail completely breaks off from the nucleus.\nDespite the vast size of its coma, Halley's nucleus is relatively small: barely long, wide and perhaps thick. Based on a reanalysis of images taken by the \"Giotto\" and \"Vega\" spacecraft, Lamy et al. determined an effective diameter of . Its shape has been variously compared to that of a peanut, a potato, or an avocado. Its mass is roughly 2.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01014\u00a0kg, with an average density of about . The low density indicates that it is made of a large number of small pieces, held together very loosely, forming a structure known as a rubble pile. Ground-based observations of coma brightness suggested that Halley's rotation period was about 7.4 days. Images taken by the various spacecraft, along with observations of the jets and shell, suggested a period of 52\u00a0hours. Given the irregular shape of the nucleus, Halley's rotation is likely to be complex. The flyby images revealed an extremely varied topography, with hills, mountains, ridges, depressions, and at least one crater.\nHalley's day side (the side facing the Sun) is far more active than the night side. Spacecraft observations showed that the gases ejected from the nucleus were 80% water vapour, 17% carbon monoxide and 3\u20134% carbon dioxide, with traces of hydrocarbons although more recent sources give a value of 10% for carbon monoxide and also include traces of methane and ammonia. The dust particles were found to be primarily a mixture of carbon\u2013hydrogen\u2013oxygen\u2013nitrogen (CHON) compounds common in the outer Solar System, and silicates, such as are found in terrestrial rocks. The dust particles ranged in size down to the limits of detection (\u22480.001\u00a0\u03bcm). The ratio of deuterium to hydrogen in the water released by Halley was initially thought to be similar to that found in Earth's ocean water, suggesting that Halley-type comets may have delivered water to Earth in the distant past. Subsequent observations showed Halley's deuterium ratio to be far higher than that found in Earth's oceans, making such comets unlikely sources for Earth's water.\n\"Giotto\" provided the first evidence in support of Fred Whipple's \"dirty snowball\" hypothesis for comet construction; Whipple postulated that comets are icy objects warmed by the Sun as they approach the inner Solar System, causing ices on their surfaces to sublime (change directly from a solid to a gas), and jets of volatile material to burst outward, creating the coma. \"Giotto\" showed that this model was broadly correct, though with modifications. Halley's albedo, for instance, is about 0.04, meaning that it reflects only 4% of the sunlight hitting it \u2013 about what one would expect for coal. Thus, despite astronomers predicting that Halley would have an albedo of about 0.17 (roughly equivalent to bare soil), Halley's Comet is in fact pitch black. The \"dirty ices\" on the surface sublime at temperatures between in sections of higher albedo to at low albedo; \"Vega 1\" found Halley's surface temperature to be in the range . This suggested that only 10% of Halley's surface was active, and that large portions of it were coated in a layer of dark dust that retained heat. Together, these observations suggested that Halley was in fact predominantly composed of non-volatile materials, and thus more closely resembled a \"snowy dirtball\" than a \"dirty snowball\".\nHistory.\nBefore 1066.\nDue to its intrinsic brightness, about one eighth of all comet sightings mentioned in historic records belong to Halley's Comet. The first certain appearance of Halley's Comet in the historical record is a description from 240\u00a0BC, in the Chinese chronicle \"Records of the Grand Historian\" or \"Shiji\", which describes a comet that appeared in the east and moved north. The only surviving record of the 164\u00a0BC apparition is found on two fragmentary Babylonian tablets, which were rediscovered in August 1984 in the collection of the British Museum.\nThe apparition of 87\u00a0BC was recorded in Babylonian tablets which state that the comet was seen \"day beyond day\" for a month. This appearance may be recalled in the representation of Tigranes the Great, an Armenian king who is depicted on coins with a crown that features, according to Vahe Gurzadyan and R. Vardanyan, \"a star with a curved tail [that] may represent the passage of Halley's Comet in 87\u00a0BC.\" Gurzadyan and Vardanyan argue that \"Tigranes could have seen Halley's Comet when it passed closest to the Sun on August 6 in 87\u00a0BC\" as the comet would have been a \"most recordable event\".\nThe apparition of 12\u00a0BC was recorded in the \"Book of Han\" by Chinese astronomers of the Han dynasty who tracked it from August through October. It passed within 0.16\u00a0au of Earth. According to the Roman historian Cassius Dio, a comet appeared suspended over Rome for several days portending the death of Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa in that year. Halley's appearance in 12\u00a0BC, only a few years distant from the conventionally assigned date of the birth of Jesus Christ, has led some theologians and astronomers to suggest that it might explain the biblical story of the Star of Bethlehem. There are other explanations for the phenomenon, such as planetary conjunctions, and there are also records of other comets that appeared closer to the date of Jesus's birth.\nIf Yehoshua ben Hananiah's reference in the \"Talmud\" to \"a star which arises once in seventy years and misleads the sailors\" refers to Halley's Comet, he can only have witnessed the 66\u00a0AD appearance. Another possible reference to the same apparition is also found in the writings of the Jewish historian Josephus, who described several portents visible over Jerusalem shortly before the outbreak of the First Jewish\u2013Roman War. He reported that \"there was a star resembling a sword, which stood over the city, and a comet, that continued a whole year,\" events that were interpreted as omens of the city's destruction in 70 AD.\nThe 141\u00a0AD apparition was recorded in Chinese chronicles, with observations of a bluish white comet on 27 and 16 March, 22 April and 23. The early Tamil bards of southern India (c. 1st - 4th century CE) also describe a certain relatable event.\nThe 374\u00a0AD and 607 approaches each came within 0.09\u00a0au of Earth. The 451\u00a0AD apparition was said to herald the defeat of Attila the Hun at the Battle of Chalons.\nThe 684\u00a0AD apparition was reported in Chinese records as the \"broom star\".\nThe 760 AD apparition was recorded in the \"Zuqnin Chronicle\"'s entry for \"iyy\u014dr\" 1071 (May 760 ), calling it a \"white sign\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The year [SE] one thousand seventy one (AD 759/760).\nIn the month of \"iyy\u014dr\" (May) a white sign was seen in the sky,\nbefore early twilight, in the north-east [quarter],\nin the Zodiac [sign] which is called Aries, to the north from these three stars in it, which are very shining.\nAnd it resembled in its shape a broom [...]\nAnd the sign itself remained for fifteen nights, until dawn of the feast of Pentecost.\nIn 837 AD, Halley's Comet may have passed as close as from Earth, by far its closest approach. Its tail may have stretched 60\u00a0degrees across the sky. It was recorded by astronomers in China, Japan, Germany, the Byzantine Empire, and the Middle East; Emperor Louis the Pious observed this appearance and devoted himself to prayer and penance, fearing that \"by this token a change in the realm and the death of a prince are made known.\"\nIn 912 AD, Halley is recorded in the \"Annals of Ulster\", which states \"A dark and rainy year. A comet appeared.\"\n1066.\nIn 1066, the comet was seen in England and thought to be an omen: later that year Harold II of England died at the Battle of Hastings and William the Conqueror claimed the throne. The comet is represented on the Bayeux Tapestry and described in the tituli as a star. Surviving accounts from the period describe it as appearing to be four times the size of Venus, and shining with a light equal to a quarter of that of the Moon. Halley came within 0.10\u00a0au of Earth at that time.\nThis appearance of the comet is also noted in the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\". Eilmer of Malmesbury may have seen Halley in 989 and 1066, as recorded by William of Malmesbury:\nNot long after, a comet, portending (they say) a change in governments, appeared, trailing its long flaming hair through the empty sky: concerning which there was a fine saying of a monk of our monastery called \u00c6thelm\u00e6r. Crouching in terror at the sight of the gleaming star, \"You've come, have you?\", he said. \"You've come, you source of tears to many mothers. It is long since I saw you; but as I see you now you are much more terrible, for I see you brandishing the downfall of my country.\"\nThe Irish \"Annals of the Four Masters\" recorded the comet as \"A star [that] appeared on the seventh of the Calends of May, on Tuesday after Little Easter, than whose light the brilliance or light of The Moon was not greater; and it was visible to all in this manner till the end of four nights afterwards.\" Chaco Native Americans in New Mexico may have recorded the 1066 apparition in their petroglyphs.\nThe Italo-Byzantine chronicle of Lupus the Protospatharios mentions that a \"comet-star\" appeared in the sky in the year 1067 (the chronicle is erroneous, as the event occurred in 1066, and by Robert he means William).\nThe Emperor Constantine Ducas died in the month of May, and his son Michael received the Empire. And in this year there appeared a comet star, and the Norman count Robert [sic] fought a battle with Harold, King of the English, and Robert was victorious and became king over the people of the English.\nThe Armenian chronicler, Matthew of Edessa also noted the appearance of the comet, and its coincidence with a Turkic invasion saying:\n \"At the beginning of the year 515 of the Armenian era [March 5, 1066 \u2013 March 4, 1067] a comet appeared out of the eastern portion of the sky and traveled in a westerly direction. It appeared for one month and then disappeared. A number of days after this, it reappeared for one month and then disappeared. A number of days after this, it reappeared in the western portion of the sky at night; many who saw it said that it was the same comet which had appeared in the eastern portion before. During these times, the infidels marched forth and ravaged all of Armenia, consuming all the faithful by the sword and enslavement.\" \n1145\u20131378.\nThe 1145 apparition may have been recorded by the monk Eadwine.\nAccording to legend, Genghis Khan was inspired to turn his conquests toward Europe by the westward-seeming trajectory of the 1222 apparition. In Korea, the comet was reportedly visible during the daylight on 9 September 1222. In Vietnam, the comet was recorded visible in the south-west direction in August (September in solar calendar). \nThe 1301 apparition was visually spectacular, and may be the first that resulted in convincing portraits of a particular comet. The Florentine chronicler Giovanni Villani wrote that the comet left \"great trails of fumes behind\", and that it remained visible from September 1301 until January 1302. It was seen by the artist Giotto di Bondone, who represented the Star of Bethlehem as a fire-coloured comet in the Nativity section of his Arena Chapel cycle, completed in 1305. Giotto's depiction includes details of the coma, a sweeping tail, and the central condensation. According to the art historian Roberta Olson, it is much more accurate than other contemporary descriptions, and was not equaled in painting until the 19th century. Olson's identification of Halley's Comet in Giotto's \"Adoration of the Magi\" is what inspired the European Space Agency to name their mission to the comet \"Giotto\", after the artist.\nHalley's 1378 appearance is recorded in the \"Annales Mediolanenses\" as well as in East Asian sources.\n1456.\nIn 1456, the year of Halley's next apparition, the Ottoman Empire invaded the Kingdom of Hungary, culminating in the siege of Belgrade in July of that year. In a papal bull, Pope Callixtus III ordered special prayers be said for the city's protection. In 1470, the humanist scholar Bartolomeo Platina wrote in his \"Lives of the Popes\" that,\nA hairy and fiery star having then made its appearance for several days, the mathematicians declared that there would follow grievous pestilence, dearth and some great calamity. Calixtus, to avert the wrath of God, ordered supplications that if evils were impending for the human race He would turn all upon the Turks, the enemies of the Christian name. He likewise ordered, to move God by continual entreaty, that notice should be given by the bells to call the faithful at midday to aid by their prayers those engaged in battle with the Turk.\nPlatina's account is not mentioned in official records. In the 18th century, a Frenchman further embellished the story, in anger at the Church, by claiming that the Pope had \"excommunicated\" the comet, though this story was most likely his own invention.\nHalley's apparition of 1456 was also witnessed in Kashmir and depicted in great detail by \u015ar\u012bvara, a Sanskrit poet and biographer to the Sultans of Kashmir. He read the apparition as a cometary portent of doom foreshadowing the imminent fall of Sultan Zayn al-Abidin (AD 1418/1420\u20131470).\nAfter witnessing a bright light in the sky which most historians have identified as Halley's Comet, Zara Yaqob, Emperor of Ethiopia from 1434 to 1468, founded the city of Debre Berhan (tr. City of Light) and made it his capital for the remainder of his reign.\n1531\u20131759.\nIn the Sikh scriptures of the Guru Granth Sahib, the founder of the faith Guru Nanak makes reference to \"a long star that has risen\" at Ang 1110, and it is believed by some Sikh scholars to be a reference to Halley's appearance in 1531.\nHalley's periodic returns have been subject to scientific investigation since the 16th century. Petrus Apianus and Girolamo Fracastoro described the comet's visit in 1531, with the former even including graphics in his publication. Through his observations, Apianus was able to prove that a comet's tail always points away from the Sun. The three apparitions from 1531 to 1682 were noted by Edmond Halley, enabling him to predict it would return. One key breakthrough occurred when Halley talked with Newton about his ideas of the laws of motion. Newton also helped Halley get John Flamsteed's data on the 1682 apparition. By studying data on the 1531, 1607, and 1682 comets, he came to the conclusion these were the same comet, and presented his findings in 1696. He predicted that the comet would return in 1758, and it did appear again in December 1758 and remained visible into 1759.\nOne difficulty was accounting for variations in the comet's orbital period, which was over a year longer between 1531 and 1607 than it was between 1607 and 1682. Newton had theorised that such delays were caused by the gravity of other comets, but Halley found that Jupiter and Saturn would cause the appropriate delays. In the decades that followed, more refined mathematics would be worked on, notable by Paris Observatory; the work on Halley also provided a boost to Newton and Kepler's rules for celestial motions. (See also computation of orbit.)\n1835.\nAt Markree Observatory in Ireland, Edward Joshua Cooper used a Cauchoix of Paris lens telescope with an aperture of to sketch Halley's comet in 1835. The same apparition was sketched by German astronomer Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel. Observations of streams of vapour prompted Bessel to propose that the jet forces of evaporating material could be great enough to significantly alter a comet's orbit.\nAn interview in 1910, of someone who was a teenager at the time of the 1835 apparition had this to say:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;When the comet was first seen, it appeared in the western sky, its head toward the north and tail towards the south, about horizontal and considerably above the horizon and quite a distance south of the Sun. It could be plainly seen directly after sunset every day, and was visible for a long time, perhaps a month ...\nThey go on to describe the comet's tail as being more broad and not as long as the comet of 1843 they had also witnessed.\nFamous astronomers across the world made observations starting August 1835, including Struve at Dorpat observatory, and Sir John Herschel, who made of observations from the Cape of Good Hope. In the United States telescopic observations were made from Yale College. The new observations helped confirm early appearances of this comet including its 1456 and 1378 apparitions.\nAt Yale College in Connecticut, the comet was first reported on 31 August 1835, by astronomers D. Olmstead and E. Loomis. In Canada reports were made from Newfoundland and also Quebec. Reports came in from all over by later 1835, and often reported in newspapers of this time in Canada.\nSeveral accounts of the 1835 apparition were made by observers who survived until the 1910 return, where increased interest in the comet led to them being interviewed.\nThe time to Halley's return in 1910 would be only 74.42 years, one of the shortest known periods of its return, which is calculated to be as long as 79 years owing to the effects of the planets.\nAt Paris Observatory Halley's Comet 1835 apparition was observed with a Lerebours telescope of aperture by the astronomer Fran\u00e7ois Arago. Arago recorded polarimetric observations of Halley, and suggested that the tail might be sunlight reflecting off a sparsely distributed material; he had earlier made similar observations of Comet Tralles of 1819.\n1910.\nThe 1910 approach, which came into naked-eye view around 10 April and came to perihelion on 20 April, was notable for several reasons: it was the first approach of which photographs exist, and the first for which spectroscopic data were obtained. Furthermore, the comet made a relatively close approach of 0.15 au, making it a spectacular sight. Indeed, on 19 May, Earth actually passed through the tail of the comet. One of the substances discovered in the tail by spectroscopic analysis was the toxic gas cyanogen, which led press to misquote the astronomer Camille Flammarion by stating he claimed that, when Earth passed through the tail, the gas \"would impregnate the atmosphere and possibly snuff out all life on the planet\". Despite reassurances from scientists that the gas would not inflict harm on Earth, the damage had already been done with members of the public panic buying gas masks and quack \"anti-comet pills\".\nThe comet added to the unrest in China on the eve of the Xinhai Revolution that would end the last dynasty in 1911. As James Hutson, a missionary in Sichuan at the time, recorded:\n\"The people believe that it indicates calamity such as war, fire, pestilence, and a change of dynasty. In some places on certain days the doors were unopened for half a day, no water was carried and many did not even drink water as it was rumoured that pestilential vapour was being poured down upon the earth from the comet.\"\nThe 1910 visitation coincided with a visit from Hedley Churchward, the first known English Muslim to make the Haj pilgrimage to Mecca.\nThe comet was used in an advertising campaign of Le Bon March\u00e9, a well-known department store in Paris.\nThe comet was also fertile ground for hoaxes. One that reached major newspapers claimed that the Sacred Followers, a supposed Oklahoma religious group, attempted to sacrifice a virgin to ward off the impending disaster, but were stopped by the police.\nAmerican satirist and writer Mark Twain was born on 30 November 1835, exactly two weeks after the comet's perihelion. In his autobiography, published in 1909, he said,\nI came in with Halley's comet in 1835. It is coming again next year, and I expect to go out with it. It will be the greatest disappointment of my life if I don't go out with Halley's comet. The Almighty has said, no doubt: \"Now here are these two unaccountable freaks; they came in together, they must go out together.\"\nTwain died on 21 April 1910, the day following the comet's subsequent perihelion. The 1985 fantasy film \"The Adventures of Mark Twain\" was inspired by the quotation.\nHalley's 1910 apparition is distinct from the Great Daylight Comet of 1910, which surpassed Halley in brilliance and was visible in broad daylight for a short period, approximately four months before Halley made its appearance.\n1986.\nThe 1986 apparition of Halley's Comet was the least favourable on record. In February 1986, the comet and the Earth were on opposite sides of the Sun, creating the worst possible viewing circumstances for Earth observers during the previous 2,000 years. Halley's closest approach was 0.42 au. Additionally, increased light pollution from urbanisation caused many people to fail in attempts to see the comet. With the help of binoculars, observation from areas outside cities was more successful. Further, the comet appeared brightest when it was almost invisible from the northern hemisphere in March and April 1986, with best opportunities occurring when the comet could be sighted close to the horizon at dawn and dusk, if not obscured by clouds.\nThe approach of the comet was first detected by astronomers David C. Jewitt and G. Edward Danielson on 16 October 1982, using the 5.1\u00a0m Hale Telescope at Mount Palomar and a CCD camera.\nThe first visual observation of the comet on its 1986 return was by an amateur astronomer, Stephen James O'Meara, on 24 January 1985. O'Meara used a home-built telescope on top of Mauna Kea to detect the magnitude 19.6 comet. The first to observe Halley's Comet with the naked eye during its 1986 apparition were Stephen Edberg (then serving as the coordinator for amateur observations at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory) and Charles Morris on 8 November 1985.\nThe 1986 apparition gave scientists the opportunity to study the comet closely, and several probes were launched to do so. The Soviet \"Vega 1\" probe began returning images of Halley on 4 March 1986, captured the first-ever image of its nucleus, and made its flyby on 6 March. It was followed by the \"Vega 2\" probe, making its flyby on 9 March. On 14 March, the \"Giotto\" space probe, launched by the European Space Agency, made the closest pass of the comet's nucleus. There also were two Japanese probes, \"Suisei\" and \"Sakigake\". Unofficially, the numerous probes became known as the Halley Armada.\nBased on data retrieved by the largest ultraviolet space telescope of the time, \"Astron\", in December 1985, a group of Soviet scientists developed a model of the comet's coma. The comet also was observed from space by the \"International Cometary Explorer\" (ICE). Originally launched as the \"International Sun-Earth Explorer 3\", the spacecraft was renamed, and departed the Sun-Earth L1 Lagrangian point in 1982 to intercept the comets 21P/Giacobini-Zinner and Halley. ICE flew through the tail of Halley's Comet, coming within about of the nucleus on 28 March 1986.\nTwo U.S. Space Shuttle missions\u2014STS-51-L and STS-61-E\u2014had been scheduled to observe Halley's Comet from low Earth orbit. The STS-51-L mission carried the \"Shuttle-Pointed Tool for Astronomy\" (Spartan Halley) satellite, also called the \"Halley's Comet Experiment Deployable\" (HCED). The mission to capture the ultraviolet spectrum of the comet ended in disaster when the Space Shuttle \"Challenger\" disintegrated in flight, killing all seven astronauts onboard. Scheduled for March 1986, STS-61-E was a \"Columbia\" mission carrying the ASTRO-1 platform to study the comet, but the mission was cancelled following the \"Challenger\" disaster and ASTRO-1 would not fly until late 1990 on STS-35.\nIn Japan, the comet was observed by Emperor Hirohito, who was 84. He had already seen it in 1910 when he was 8.\nAfter 1986.\nOn 12 February 1991, at a distance of from the Sun, Halley displayed an outburst that lasted for several months. The comet released dust with a total mass of about 108 kg, which spread into an elongated cloud roughly by in size. The outburst likely started in December 1990, and then the comet brightened from about magnitude 25 to magnitude 19. Comets rarely show outburst activity at distances beyond 5 au from the Sun. Different mechanisms have been proposed for the outburst, ranging from interaction with the solar wind to a collision with an undiscovered asteroid. The most likely explanation is a combination of two effects, the polymerisation of hydrogen cyanide and a phase transition of amorphous water ice, which raised the temperature of the nucleus enough for some of the more volatile compounds on its surface to sublime.\nHalley was most recently observed in 2003 by three of the Very Large Telescopes at Paranal, Chile, when Halley's magnitude was 28.2. The telescopes observed Halley, at the faintest and farthest any comet had ever been imaged, to verify a method for finding very faint trans-Neptunian objects. Astronomers are now able to observe the comet at any point in its orbit.\nOn 9 December 2023, Halley's Comet reached the farthest and slowest point in its orbit from the Sun when it was travelling at with respect to the Sun.\n2061.\nThe next perihelion of Halley's Comet is predicted for 28 July 2061, when it will be better positioned for observation than during the 1985\u20131986 apparition, as it will be on the same side of the Sun as Earth. The closest approach to Earth will be one day after perihelion. It is expected to have an apparent magnitude of \u22120.3, compared with only +2.1 for the 1986 apparition. On 9 September 2060, Halley will pass within of Jupiter, and then on 20 August 2061, will pass within of Venus.\n2134.\nHalley will come to perihelion on 27 March 2134. Then on 7 May 2134, Halley will pass within of Earth. Its apparent magnitude is expected to be \u22122.0.\nList of apparitions.\nHalley's calculations enabled the comet's earlier appearances to be found in the historical record. The following table sets out the astronomical designations for every apparition of Halley's Comet from 240\u00a0BC, the earliest documented sighting.\nIn the designations, \"1P/\" refers to Halley's Comet; the first periodic comet discovered. The number represents the year, with negatives representing BC. The letter-number combination indicates which it was of the comets observed for a given segment of the year, divided into 24 equal parts. The Roman numeral indicates which comet past perihelion it was for a given year, while the lower-case letter indicates which comet it was for a given year overall. The perihelion dates farther from the present are approximate, mainly because of uncertainties in the modelling of non-gravitational effects. Perihelion dates of 1531 and earlier are in the Julian calendar, while perihelion dates 1607 and after are in the Gregorian calendar. The perihelion dates for some of the early apparitions (particularly before 837 AD) are uncertain by a couple of days. While Halley's Comet usually peaks at around 0th magnitude, there are indications that the comet got considerably brighter than that in the past.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "46086", "revid": "2666701", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46086", "title": "Eared seal", "text": "Family of marine mammals\nAn eared seal, otariid, or otary, is any member of the marine mammal family Otariidae, one of three groupings of pinnipeds. They comprise 15 extant species in seven genera (another species became extinct in the 1950s) and are commonly known either as sea lions or fur seals, distinct from true seals (phocids) and the walrus (odobenids). Otariids are adapted to a semiaquatic lifestyle, feeding and migrating in the water, but breeding and resting on land or ice. They reside in subpolar, temperate, and equatorial waters throughout the Pacific and Southern Oceans, the southern Indian, and Atlantic Oceans. They are conspicuously absent in the north Atlantic.\nThe words \"otariid\" and \"otary\" come from the Ancient Greek \u1f60\u03c4\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd (\"\u014dt\u00e1rion\"), meaning \"little ear\", referring to the small but visible external ear flaps (pinnae), which distinguishes them from the phocids.\nEvolution and taxonomy.\nMorphological and molecular evidence supports a monophyletic origin of pinnipeds, sharing a common ancestor with Musteloidea, though an earlier hypothesis suggested that Ot\u0430riidae are descended from a common ancestor most closely related to modern bears. Debate remains as to whether the phocids diverged from the otariids before or after the walrus.\nOtariids arose in the Miocene (15\u201317 million years ago) in the North Pacific, diversifying rapidly into the Southern Hemisphere, where most species now live. The earliest known fossil otariid is \"Eotaria crypta\" from southern California, while the genus \"Callorhinus\" (northern fur seal) has the oldest fossil record of any living otariid, extending to the middle Pliocene. It probably arose from the extinct fur seal genus \"Thalassoleon\".\nTraditionally, otariids had been subdivided into the fur seal (Arctocephalinae) and sea lion (Otariinae) subfamilies, with the major distinction between them being the presence of a thick underfur layer in the former. Under this categorization, the fur seals comprised two genera: \"Callorhinus\" in the North Pacific with a single representative, the northern fur seal (\"C. ursinus\"), and eight species in the Southern Hemisphere under the genus \"Arctocephalus\"; while the sea lions comprise five species under five genera. Recent analyses of the genetic evidence suggests that \"Callorhinus ursinus\" is in fact more closely related to several sea lion species. Furthermore, many of the Otariinae appear to be more phylogenetically distinct than previously assumed; for example, the Japanese sea lion (\"Zalophus japonicus\") is now considered a separate species, rather than a subspecies of the California sea lion (\"Zalophus californius\").\nIn light of this evidence, the subfamily separation has been removed entirely and the family Otariidae has been organized into seven genera with 16 species and two subspecies.\nNonetheless, because of morphological and behavioral similarities among the \"fur seals\" and \"sea lions\", these remain useful categories when discussing differences between groups of species. Compared to sea lions, fur seals are generally smaller, exhibit greater sexual dimorphism, eat smaller prey and go on longer foraging trips; and, of course, there is the contrast between the coarse short sea lion hair and the fur seal's fur.\nCladogram showing relationships among the otarids, combining several phylogenetic analyses. The fur seal branch has not been resolved.\nAnatomy.\nOtariids have proportionately much larger fore-flippers and pectoral muscles than phocids, and have the ability to turn their hind limbs forward and walk on all fours, making them far more maneuverable on land. They are generally considered to be less adapted to an aquatic lifestyle, since they breed primarily on land and haul out more frequently than true seals. However, they can attain higher bursts of speed and have greater maneuverability in the water. Their swimming power derives from the use of flippers more so than the sinuous whole-body movements typical of phocids and walruses.\nOtariids are further distinguished by a more dog-like head, sharp, well-developed canines, and the aforementioned visible external pinnae. Their postcanine teeth are generally simple and conical in shape. The dental formula for eared seals is: 3.1.4.1-32.1.4.1. Sea lions are covered with coarse guard hairs, while fur seals have a thick underfur, which has historically made them the objects of commercial exploitation.\nMale otariids range in size from the Gal\u00e1pagos fur seal, smallest of all otariids, to the over 1,000-kg (2,200-lb) Steller sea lion. Mature male otariids weigh two to six times as much as females, with proportionately larger heads, necks, and chests, making them the most sexually dimorphic of all mammals.\nBehavior.\nAll otariids breed on land during well-defined breeding seasons. Except for the Australian sea lion, which has an atypical 17.5 month breeding cycle, they form strictly annual aggregations on beaches or rocky substrates, often on islands. All species are polygynous; i.e. successful males breed with several females. In most species, males arrive at breeding sites first and establish and maintain territories through vocal and visual displays and occasional fighting. Females typically arrive on shore a day or so before giving birth. While considered social animals, no permanent hierarchies or statuses are established on the colonies. The extent to which males control females or territories varies between species. Thus, the northern fur seal and the South American sea lion tend to herd specific harem-associated females, occasionally injuring them, while the Steller sea lion and the New Zealand sea lion control spatial territories, but do not generally interfere with the movement of the females. Female New Zealand sea lions are the only otariids that move up to into forests to protect their pups during the breeding season.\nOtariids are carnivorous, feeding on fish, squid and krill. Sea lions tend to feed closer to shore in upwelling zones, feeding on larger fish, while the smaller fur seals tend to take longer, offshore foraging trips and can subsist on large numbers of smaller prey items. They are visual feeders. Some females are capable of dives of up to .\nSpecies.\nFamily Otariidae\nAlthough the two subfamilies of otariids, the Otariinae (sea lions) and Arctocephalinae (fur seals), are still widely used, recent molecular studies have demonstrated that they may be invalid as traditionally defined. Instead, they suggest three clades within the family; one consisting of the northern sea lions (\"Eumetopias\" and \"Zalophus\"), one of the northern fur seal (\"Callorhinus\") and its extinct relatives, and the third of all the remaining Southern Hemisphere species.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It has about 92,000 inhabitants. It is the capital city of the Pardubice Region and lies on the Elbe River. The historic centre is well preserved and is protected as an urban monument reservation.\nPardubice is known as a centre of industry, with dominant industries being the chemical industry, electrical engineering and mechanical engineering. The city is also well known for its sporting events, which include the Velk\u00e1 pardubick\u00e1 (a cross-country steeplechase), the Golden Helmet of Pardubice in motorcycle racing, and the Czech Open international chess and board games festival.\nAdministrative division.\nPardubice consists of eight self-governing boroughs. In addition, Pardubice consists of 27 municipal parts, whose borders do not respect the boundaries of boroughs (in brackets population according to the 2021 census, in italics municipal parts only partly in the boroughs):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nEtymology.\nThe name \"Pardubice\" is derived from the personal Polish name Poryd\u0119b. It was the name of the leader of the monks who came here from Poland. For the first time the name was recorded in the form of \"Pordobice\".\nGeography.\nPardubice is located about east of Prague. The city lies at the confluence of the Elbe and Chrudimka rivers. There are several fishponds, artificial lakes and oxbow lakes of the Elbe in the municipal territory.\nPardubice is located in a predominantly flat agricultural lansdscape in the East Elbe Table, in the eastern part of the Polab\u00ed lowland. The highest point is the hill Stropinsk\u00fd vrch at above sea level, located on the southeastern municipal border.\nClimate.\nPardubice's climate is classified as oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: \"Cfb\"; Trewartha: \"Dobo\"). Among them, the annual average temperature is , the hottest month in July is , and the coldest month is in January. The annual precipitation is , of which July is the wettest with , while February is the driest with only . The extreme temperature throughout the year ranged from on 29 December 1996 to on 28 July 2013.\nHistory.\nThe first written mention of Pardubice is from 1295, when Pope Boniface VIII took over the protection of the local Church of Saint Bartholomew with the order of Canons Regular of the Penitence of the Blessed Martyrs. In the first half of the 14th century, the settlement was acquired by a noble family, later known as Lords of Pardubice. In 1340, when Pardubice was inherited by Arno\u0161t of Pardubice, it was first referred to as a city.\nIn 1491, Pardubice was bought by Vil\u00e9m II of Pern\u0161tejn, who continued to expand the city and made significant impact on its prosperity. He chose Pardubice as the centre of his estate and began to build a city that corresponded to his status. The Pern\u0161tejn family had the entire historic centre with the Renaissance square built. They also had rebuilt the medieval castle into a comfortable fortified residence. In 1560, the Pern\u0161tejns were forced to sell the estate to Emperor Ferdinand I because of debts.\nDuring the Thirty Years' War, the city was besieged by the army of General Lennart Torstensson, but was not conquered.\nAn important milestone in the history of the city was the year 1845, when the railway from Prague to Olomouc was finished. Pardubice became an important railway junction, which led to the development of the food, engineering and chemical industries, and subsequently the development of social and cultural life. In 1874, the Velk\u00e1 pardubick\u00e1 steeplechase horse race took place for the first time. In 1910, Jan Ka\u0161par made here the first successful flight in Czech lands and a year later he made history by flying the first long-haul flight from Pardubice to Prague.\nUntil 1918, the city was part of Austria Hungary. The seat of the Pardubice district, it was one of the 94 \"Bezirkshauptmannschaften\" in Bohemia.\nIn the interwar period, Pardubice continued to develop until its heyday ended with the advent of World War II. During the war, the city was damaged by air strikes of the Allies, and the Fanto Werke refinery was repeatedly bombed during the oil campaign.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nEconomy.\nPardubice is known as an industrial city. The dominant industries are chemical industry, electrical engineering and mechanical engineering. Tesla electronics manufacturer operated here in 1921\u20131989. In 2000, Foxconn established a production plant in its former premises. This electronics manufacturer is the largest employer in Pardubice.\nPardubice has a long tradition in the chemical industry. It is represented by the Paramo refinery, which was founded by David Fanto in 1889. Today it is owned by Orlen Unipetrol. In Pardubice-Semt\u00edn there are the companies Explosia (a manufacturer of explosives founded in 1920, which is associated with the invention of Semtex plastic explosive) and its subsidiary Synthesia (manufacturer of cellulose, pigments and dyes, and organic compounds, established in 1929).\nFor centuries, Pardubice have been known for the production of gingerbread. The gingerbread guild was established in the 16th century. The first factory was founded in 1913. Since 2008, Pardubice gingerbread is a protected geographical indication by the European Union.\nTransport.\nPardubice is located at the crossroads of three main roads: the I/2, which connects Pardubice with Prague; the I/36 from Pardubice to Rychnov nad Kn\u011b\u017enou District; and the I/37, which connects Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9 with \u017d\u010f\u00e1r nad S\u00e1zavou and the D1 motorway.\nThe railway station Pardubice hlavn\u00ed n\u00e1dra\u017e\u00ed is an important railway junction. Pardubice has direct railway connection with many cities, including Prague, Brno, Olomouc, Ostrava and Liberec in the Czech Republic, Bratislava, \u017dilina and Ko\u0161ice in Slovakia, Wroc\u0142aw, Krak\u00f3w, Pozna\u0144, Gda\u0144sk, Warsaw and Gdynia in Poland, Budapest in Hungary, and Vienna and Graz in Austria. The territory of Pardubice is served by eight train stations and stops.\nPardubice is served by Pardubice Airport, which is used as both military and civilian international airport.\nIn addition to buses, trolleybuses also provide intra-city transport. Trolleybus service was started in 1952. There are 12 trolleybus lines in operation. Intra-city transport is provided by the company Dopravn\u00ed podnik m\u011bsta Pardubic a.s., which is owned by the city of Pardubice. The company was founded in 1950.\nEducation.\nPardubice is home to University of Pardubice. It was founded in 1950 as Chemical College and is mainly focused on fields historically associated with the city, such as the chemical industry and transportation.\nSport.\nThe city was first represented in the top national football competition by SK Pardubice in the 1930s and 1940s. From 1957 to 1960, Dukla Pardubice played in the top tier. Later VCHZ Pardubice played in the top national league in the 1968\u201369 season. Nowadays the city is represented by FK Pardubice, which plays in the Czech First League. Women's team plays in the Czech Women's First League.\nThe ice hockey club HC Dynamo Pardubice plays in the Czech Extraliga. The team plays its home games at Enteria arena.\nThe basketball team is BK JIP Pardubice, playing in the National Basketball League.\nThe Pardubice Stallions are an American football team currently playing in the Czech League of American Football 2nd division. They play home games at the Summer Stadium. \nPardubice is also represented in the Czech rink bandy league.\nPardubice hosts two world-famous sporting events each year. The Velk\u00e1 pardubick\u00e1 steeplechase was first held in 1874 and is one of the most famous horse races in Europe. The second event is the Golden Helmet of Pardubice, a motorcycle speedway competition held at the Sv\u00edtkov Stadium. The Golden Helmet has been run since 1929 is one of the oldest individual titles in world speedway. AMK Zlat\u00e1 P\u0159ilba Pardubice is a speedway team that race at the Sv\u00edtkov Stadium.\nThe Czech Open international chess and games festival has been held in Pardubice since 1990. The city was also known for the Czech Open in golf, but it was last held in 2011.\nSights.\nThe landmark and symbol of Pardubice is the Green Gate as a remnant of the city's fortifications. It is a Renaissance gate with a fa\u00e7ade decorated by a relief designed by Mikol\u00e1\u0161 Ale\u0161, which depicts the Lords of Pardubice. Behind the gate is a tower that serves as a lookout tower. In its interior there is also an exposition with the history and legends of the city.\nPardubice Castle was built at the end of the 13th century and rebuilt in the Renaissance style at the turn of the 15th and 16th centuries. Massive fortifications are preserved around the castle. Today the castle houses the Museum of East Bohemia in Pardubice and Gallery of East Bohemia in Pardubice.\nThe original Church of Saint Bartholomew was built in 1295 and destroyed during the Hussite Wars. The today's Church of Saint Bartholomew was built together with a monastery in 1507\u20131514. It was used as a burial place of the Pern\u0161tejn family. In the interior there is a valuable main altar with the painting \"The Passion of St. Bartholomew\" from 1692 by Michael Willmann and a painting decoration by Mikol\u00e1\u0161 Ale\u0161.\nThe Church of the Annunciation of the Virgin Mary was founded by Arno\u0161t of Pardubice before 1359. Its present late Gothic and Renaissance appearance dates from the first half of the 16th century. Until 1786, the church belonged to a Minorite monastery, from which time there are extensive underground tombs under the church.\nThe House at Jon\u00e1\u0161 is one of the most treasured burgher houses in Pardubice. It was built after the fire that hit the city in 1507. It is known for its fa\u00e7ade, decorated with a stucco relief from 1797, showing a biblical scene of a whale swallowing the prophet Jonah. The premises of the house are used by the Gallery of East Bohemia in Pardubice.\nThe Z\u00e1me\u010dek Memorial is a place of reverence that commemorates execution of 194 people in 1942.

{"id": "46089", "revid": "11096", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46089", "title": "Frans Hals", "text": "Painter from the Northern Netherlands (c. 1582\u20131666)\nFrans Hals the Elder (, ; ; c.\u20091582 \u2013 26 August 1666) was a Dutch Golden Age painter. He lived and worked in Haarlem, a city in which the local authority of the day frowned on religious painting in places of worship but citizens liked to decorate their homes with works of art. Hals was highly sought after by wealthy burgher commissioners of individual, married-couple, family, and institutional-group portraits. He also painted tronies for the general market.\nThere were two quite distinct schools of portraiture in 17th-century Haarlem: the neat (represented, for example, by Verspronck); and a looser, more painterly style at which Frans Hals excelled. Some of Hals's portrait work is characterised by a subdued palette, reflecting the politely serious tones of his fashionable clients' wardrobe. In contrast, the personalities he paints are full of life, typically with a friendly glint in the eye or the glimmer of a smile on the lips.\nHals was born at Antwerp in the southern Spanish Netherlands, but because of the chaos wrought there by the Spanish at that time, his family moved to Haarlem when he was little. Many of his Haarlem clients were also \u00e9migr\u00e9s from the South.\nBiography.\nHals was born in 1582 or 1583 in Antwerp, then in the Spanish Netherlands, as the son of cloth merchant Franchois Fransz Hals van Mechelen (c. 1542\u20131610) and his second wife Adriaentje van Geertenryck. Like many, Hals's parents fled during the Fall of Antwerp (1584\u20131585) from the south to Haarlem in the new Dutch Republic in the north, where he lived for the remainder of his life. Hals studied under Flemish \u00e9migr\u00e9 Karel van Mander, whose Mannerist influence, however, is barely noticeable in Hals's work.\nIn 1610, Hals became a member of the Haarlem Guild of Saint Luke, and he started to earn money as an art restorer for the town council. He worked on their large art collection, which Karel van Mander had described in his \"Schilderboeck\" (\"Painter's Book\") published in Haarlem in 1604. The most notable works were those of Geertgen tot Sint Jans, Jan van Scorel, and Jan Mostaert that hung in the St John's Church in Haarlem. The restoration work was paid for by the council. The council had confiscated all Catholic religious art in the \"Haarlemse Noon\", although it did not formally possess the entire collection until 1625, when the city fathers had decided which were suitable for the town hall. The remaining art, which was considered too Roman Catholic, was sold to Cornelis Claesz van Wieringen, a fellow guild member, on condition that he remove it from Haarlem. It was in this cultural context that Hals began his career in portraiture, since the market had disappeared for religious themes.\nThe earliest known example of Hals's art is the portrait of \"Jacobus Zaffius\" (1611). His 'breakthrough' came with the life-sized group portrait \"The Banquet of the Officers of the St George Militia Company in 1616\". His most famous sitter was \"Ren\u00e9 Descartes\", whom he painted in 1649.\nFrans Hals married his first wife Anneke Harmensdochter around 1610. Frans was of Catholic birth, however, so their marriage was recorded in the city hall and not in church. Unfortunately, the exact date is unknown because the older marriage records of the Haarlem city hall before 1688 have not been preserved. Anneke was born 2 January 1590 as the daughter of bleacher Harmen Dircksz and Pietertje Claesdr Ghijblant, and her maternal grandfather, linen producer Claes Ghijblant of , bequeathed the couple the grave in the Grote Kerk church where both are buried, though Frans took over 40 years to join his first wife there. Anneke died in 1615, shortly after the birth of their third child and, of the three, Harmen survived infancy and one had died before Hals's second marriage. \nAs biographer Seymour Slive has pointed out, older stories of Hals abusing his first wife were confused with another Haarlem resident of the same name. Indeed, at the time of these charges, the artist had no wife to mistreat, as Anneke had died in May 1615. Similarly, historical accounts of Hals's propensity for drink were largely based on embellished anecdotes of his early biographers like Arnold Houbraken; there is no direct evidence that Hals did drink heavily. After his first wife died, Hals took on the young daughter of a fishmonger to look after his children and, in 1617, he married Lysbeth Reyniers. They married in Spaarndam, a small village outside the banns of Haarlem, because she was already eight months pregnant. Hals was a devoted father, and they went on to have eight children.\nContemporaries such as Rembrandt moved their households according to the caprices of their patrons, but Hals remained in Haarlem and insisted that his customers come to him. According to the Haarlem archives, a schutterstuk that Hals started in Amsterdam was finished by Pieter Codde because Hals refused to paint in Amsterdam, insisting that the militiamen come to Haarlem to sit for their portraits. For this reason, we can be sure that all sitters were either from Haarlem or were visiting Haarlem when they had their portraits made.\nHals's work was in demand through much of his life, but he lived so long that he eventually went out of style as a painter and experienced financial difficulties. In addition to his painting, he worked as a restorer, art dealer, and art tax expert for the city councilors. His creditors took him to court several times, and he sold his belongings to settle his debt with a baker in 1652. The inventory of the property seized mentions only three mattresses and bolsters, an armoire, a table, and five pictures (these were by himself, his sons, van Mander, and Maarten van Heemskerck). Left destitute, he was given an annuity of 200 florins in 1664 by the municipality.\nThe Dutch nation fought for independence during the Eighty Years' War, and Hals was a member of the local schutterij, a military guild. He included a self-portrait in his 1639 painting of the St Joris company, according to its 19th-century painting frame. (It has not been possible to confirm this.) It was not common for ordinary members to be painted, as that privilege was reserved for the officers. Hals painted the company three times. He was also a member of a local chamber of rhetoric, and in 1644 he became chairman of the Guild of St Luke.\nFrans Hals died in Haarlem in 1666 and was buried in the Grote Kerk church. He had been receiving a city pension, which was highly unusual and a sign of the esteem with which he was regarded. After his death, his widow applied for aid and was admitted to the local almshouse, where she later died.\nArtistic career.\nHals is best known for his portraits, mainly of wealthy citizens such as Pieter van den Broecke and Isaac Massa, whom he painted three times. He also painted large group portraits for local civic guards and for the regents of local hospitals. He was a Dutch Golden Age painter who practiced an intimate realism with a radically free approach. His pictures illustrate the various strata of society: banquets or meetings of officers, guildsmen, local councilmen from mayors to clerks, itinerant players and singers, gentlemen, fishwives, and tavern heroes. In his group portraits, such as \"The Banquet of the Officers of the St Adrian Militia Company in 1627\", Hals captures each character in a different manner. The faces are not idealized and are clearly distinguishable, with their personalities revealed in a variety of poses and facial expressions.\nHals was fond of daylight and silvery sheen, while Rembrandt used golden glow effects based upon artificial contrasts of low light in immeasurable gloom. Hals seized a moment in the life of his subjects with rare intuition. What nature displayed in that moment he reproduced thoroughly in a delicate scale of color and with mastery over every form of expression. He became so clever that exact tone, light and shade, and modeling were obtained with a few marked and fluid strokes of the brush. He became a popular portrait painter and painted the wealthy of Haarlem on special occasions. He won many commissions for wedding portraits (the husband is traditionally situated on the left, and the wife situated on the right). His double portrait of the newly married Olycans hang side by side in the Mauritshuis, but many of his wedding portrait pairs have since been split up and are rarely seen together.\nWedding portraits.\nThe only record of his work in the first decade of his independent activity is an engraving by Jan van de Velde copied from the lost portrait of \"The Minister Johannes Bogardus\". Early works by Hals show him as a careful draughtsman capable of great finish yet spirited, such as \"Two singing boys with a lute and a music book\" and \"Banquet of the Officers of the St George Militia\" (1616). The flesh that he painted is pastose and burnished, less clear than it subsequently became. Later, he became more effective, displayed more freedom of hand and a greater command of effect.\nDuring this period, he painted the full-length portrait of Madame van Beresteyn (Louvre) and a full-length portrait of Willem van Heythuysen posing with a sword. Both these pictures are equalled by the other \"Banquet of the Officers of the St George Militia\" (with different portraits) and the \"same militia in 1627\" and \"Banquet of the Officers of the St Hadrian Militia\" of 1633. A similar painting with the date of 1639 suggests some study of Rembrandt masterpieces, and a similar influence is apparent in a representing the regents of the St Elisabeth Gasthuis and in his 1639 portrait of at Amsterdam.\nFrom 1620 till 1640, he painted many double portraits of married couples on separate panels, the man on the left panel and his wife on the right panel. Only once did Hals portray a couple on a single canvas: \"Couple in a garden: Wedding portrait of Isaac Abrahamsz. Massa and Beatrix van der Laan\", (c.\u20091622, Rijksmuseum Amsterdam).\nHis style changed throughout his life. Paintings of vivid color were gradually replaced by pieces where mostly black came to dominate. This was probably due to the sober dress of his Protestant sitters, more than any personal preference. One simple way to observe this change is to look at all of the portraits that he painted through the years with his trademark pose leaning over the back of a chair:\nPortrait painter.\nLater in his life, his brush strokes became looser, fine detail becoming less important than the overall impression. His earlier pieces radiated gaiety and liveliness, while his later portraits emphasized the stature and dignity of the people portrayed. This austerity is displayed in ' in 1641 and, two decades later, \"The Regents\" and \"Regentesses of the Old Men's Almshouse\" (c.\u20091664), which are masterpieces of color, though in substance all but monochromes. His restricted palette is particularly noticeable in his flesh tints, which became greyer from year to year, until finally the shadows were painted in almost absolute black, as in the '.\nThis tendency coincides with the period when Hals gained fewer commissions from the wealthy, and some historians have suggested that a reason for his predilection for black and white pigment was the low price of these colors as compared with the costly lakes and carmines. Both conclusions are probably correct, however, because Hals did not travel to his sitters, unlike his contemporaries, but let them come to him. This was good for business because he was exceptionally quick and efficient in his own well-fitted studio, but it was bad for business when Haarlem fell on hard times.\nAs a portrait painter, Hals had scarcely the psychological insight of a Rembrandt or Vel\u00e1zquez, though in a few works, like the \"Admiral de Ruyter\", the \"Jacob Olycan\", and the \"Albert van der Meer\" paintings, he reveals a searching analysis of character which has little in common with the instantaneous expression of his character portraits. In these, he generally sets upon the canvas the fleeting aspect of the various stages of merriment, from the subtle, half ironic smile that quivers round the lips of the curiously misnamed \"Laughing Cavalier\" to the grin of the \"Malle Babbe\". To this group of pictures belong the \"Lute Player\", the \"Gypsy Girl\" and the \"Laughing Fisherboy\", whilst the \"Marriage Portrait of Isaac Massa and Beatrix van der Laen\" and the somewhat confused group of the ' at the Louvre show a similar tendency. Far less scattered in arrangement than this Beresteyn group, and in every respect one of the most masterly of Hals's achievements is the group called ', which was almost unknown until it appeared at the winter exhibition at the Royal Academy in 1906.\nAccording to the Frans Hals catalogue raisonn\u00e9, 1974, 222 known paintings can be ascribed to Hals. This list was compiled by Seymour Slive in 1970\u22121974 who also wrote an exhibition catalogue in 1989 and produced an update to his catalogue raisonn\u00e9 work in 2014. In 1989, another authority on Hals, Claus Grimm, disagreed with Slive and published a shorter \"\u0153uvre\" of 145 paintings in his \"Frans Hals. Das Gesamtwerk\".\nIt is not known whether Hals ever painted landscapes, still lifes or narrative pieces, but it is unlikely. His debut for Haarlem society in 1616 with his large group portrait for the St George militia shows all three disciplines, but if that painting was his signboard for future commissions, it seems he was subsequently only hired for portraits. Many artists in the 17th century in Holland opted to specialise, and Hals also appears to have been a pure portrait specialist.\nPainting technique.\nHals was a master of a technique that utilized something previously seen as a flaw in painting, the visible brushstroke. The soft curling lines of Hals's brush are always clear upon the surface: \"materially just lying there, flat, while conjuring substance and space in the eye.\"\nIn this way his style was similar to \u00c9douard Manet; in fact, Hals was described by author Raymond Cogniat as \"the Manet of his day.\" Lively and exciting, the technique can appear \"ostensibly slapdash\" \u2013 people often think that Hals 'threw' his works 'in one toss' (\"aus einem Guss\") onto the canvas. This impression is not correct. Hals did occasionally paint without underdrawings or underpainting (\"alla prima\"), but most of the works were created in successive layers, as was customary at that time. Sometimes a drawing was made with chalk or paint on top of a grey or pink undercoat, and was then more or less filled in, in stages. It does seem that Hals usually applied his underpainting very loosely: he was a virtuoso from the beginning. This applies, of course, particularly to his genre works and his somewhat later, mature works. Hals displayed tremendous daring, great courage and virtuosity, and had a great capacity to pull back his hands from the canvas, or panel, at the moment of the most telling statement. He didn't 'paint them to death', as many of his contemporaries did, in their great accuracy and diligence whether requested by their clients or not.\nIn the 17th century his first biographer, Schrevelius wrote: \"An unusual manner of painting, all his own, surpassing almost everyone,\" on Hals's painting methods. For that matter, schematic painting was not Hals's own idea (the approach already existed in 16th century Italy), and Hals was probably inspired by Flemish contemporaries, Rubens and Van Dyck, in his painting method. Haarlem resident Theodorus Schrevelius was struck by the vitality of Hals's portraits which reflected 'such power and life' that the painter 'seems to challenge nature with his brush'.\nInfluence.\nFrans influenced his brother Dirck Hals (born at Haarlem, 1591\u20131656), who was also a painter. Additionally, five of his sons became painters:\nThough most of his sons became portrait painters, some of them took up still-life painting or architectural studies and landscapes. Still lifes formerly attributed to his son Frans II have since been re-attributed to other painters, however. Hals painted a young woman reaching into a basket in a still life market scene by Claes van Heussen.\nOther contemporary painters who took inspiration from Hals were, with the main cities they were based in:\nHals had a large workshop in Haarlem and many students, though 19th century biographers questioned some of his pupils, since their painting styles were so dissimilar to Hals. In his \"De Groote Schouburgh\" (1718\u201321), Arnold Houbraken mentions Philips Wouwerman, Adriaen Brouwer, Pieter Gerritsz van Roestraten, Adriaen van Ostade and Dirck van Delen as students. Vincent Laurensz van der Vinne was also a student, according to his diary with notes left by his son Laurens Vincentsz van der Vinne. Roestraten was not only a student (the Haarlem archives contain a notarised document, which supports this fact), but he also became a son-in-law of Hals when he married his daughter Adriaentje. The Haarlem portrait painter, Johannes Verspronck, one of about 10 competing portraitists in Haarlem at the time, possibly studied for some time with Hals.\nIn terms of style, the closest to Hals's work is the handful of paintings that are ascribed to Judith Leyster, which she often signed. She also 'qualifies' as a possible student, as does her husband, the painter Jan Miense Molenaer.\nIn the 19th century, his technique influenced the work of impressionists and realists including Claude Monet, \u00c9douard Manet, Charles-Fran\u00e7ois Daubigny, Max Liebermann, James Abbott McNeill Whistler, Gustave Courbet, and in the Netherlands, Jacobus van Looy and Isaac Isra\u00ebls. Lovis Corinth named Hals as his biggest influence.\nThe Post-Impressionist artist Vincent van Gogh wrote to his brother Theo: 'What a joy it is to see a Frans Hals, how different it is from the paintings \u2013 so many of them \u2013 where everything is carefully smoothed out in the same manner.' Hals chose not to give a smooth finish to his painting, as most of his contemporaries did, but mimicked the vitality of his subject by using smears, lines, spots, large patches of color and hardly any details.\nLegacy.\nThe 1911 \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\" has an article on Frans Hals by Paul George Konody, who observes: Hals's reputation waned after his death and for two centuries he was held in such poor esteem that some of his paintings, which are now among the proudest possessions of public galleries, were sold at auction for a few pounds or even shillings. The portrait of Johannes Acronius realized five shillings at the Enschede sale in 1786. The at the Alte Pinakothek sold in 1800 for \u00a34: 5s (\u00a34.25 in decimal notation).\nNevertheless, Hals's art did not go altogether unappreciated in the time between his death in 1666 and the 1860s. In his \"Groote Schouburgh\" (1718\u20131721), Arnold Houbraken recorded Hals's life and praised his style, adding that the figures in one of the large group portraits: \"... zoo kragtig en natuurlyk geschildert zyn, dat zy de aanschouwers schynen te willen aanspreken\" (\"... are painted so powerfully and naturally, they seem to want to talk to us\"). Dutch artists known to have admired Hals enough to make copies of his paintings include Cornelis van Noorde (1731\u20131795) and Wybrand Hendricks (1744\u20131831). Empress Catherine the Great (reigned 1762\u20131796) acquired ten Hals works for her collection. Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard (1732\u20131806) visited the Alte Pinakothek to copy Hals's work, and Hals's influence is apparent in Fragonard's \"portraits de fantaisie\". Antoine Watteau (1684\u20131721) made study sketches after Hals. At the Royal Academy in London, Joshua Reynolds (1723\u20131792) lectured on Hals in 1774, praising his handling of faces and the consequent remarkable individuality of his portraits. Reynolds was less enthusiastic about Hals's characteristic loose finish, which he thought betrayed impatience. Subsequently, in 1781 Reynolds visited the Hals collection then at Haarlem Town Hall (now at the Frans Hals Museum) and soon after bought two Hals works. Reynolds's biographer James Northcote (1736\u20131831), who was a fellow portraitist, remarked that Hals could have caught a bird in flight, grasping it, as it were, from life \u2013 something he said Titian would not have been capable of.\nStarting at the middle of the 1860s his prestige rose again thanks to the efforts of critic Th\u00e9ophile Thor\u00e9-B\u00fcrger. With his rehabilitation in public esteem came the enormous rise in value, and, at the Secretan sale in 1889, the portrait of Pieter van den Broecke was bid up to 4,420 francs, while in 1908 the National Gallery paid \u00a325,000 for the from the collection of Lord Talbot de Malahide.\nHals's work remains admired, particularly with young painters who can find many lessons about practical technique from his unconcealed brushstrokes. Hals's works have found their way to countless cities all over the world and into museum collections. From the late 19th century, they were collected everywhere\u2014from Antwerp to Toronto, and from London to New York. Many of his paintings were then sold to American collectors.\nSeveral of his most important works are owned by the town council of Haarlem. They are now at the Frans Hals Museum in the Groot Heiligland, Haarlem. Before 1913 they hung in the Town Hall, where Impressionists went to see them.\nThe Hals crater on Mercury is named in his honour.\nHals was pictured on the Netherlands' 10-guilder banknote of 1968.\n\"The Banquet of the Officers of the St George Militia Company in 1616\" appears on the restaurant wall in the 1989 Peter Greenaway film \"The Cook, the Thief, His Wife &amp; Her Lover\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

In 2017, the commune had a population of 50,396.\nConsidered the world's capital of perfume, Grasse obtained two flowers in the \"Concours des villes et villages fleuris\" and was made \"Ville d'Art et d'Histoire\" (City of Art and History).\nPerfume.\nGrasse has had a prospering perfume industry since the end of the 18th century. Grasse is the centre of the French perfume industry and is known as the world's perfume capital (\"la capitale mondiale des parfums\"). Many \"noses\" (or, in French, \"les nez\" (plural)/\"le nez\" (singular)) are trained or have spent time in Grasse to distinguish over 2,000 kinds of scents. Grasse produces over two-thirds of France's natural aromas (for perfume and for food flavourings). This industry turns over more than 600 million euros a year. Grasse's particular microclimate encouraged the flower farming industry. It is warm and sufficiently inland to be sheltered from the sea air. There is an abundance of water, thanks to its location in the hills and the 1860 construction of the Siagne canal for irrigation purposes. The town is above sea level and from the coast (C\u00f4te d'Azur). Jasmine, a key ingredient of many perfumes, was brought to southern France by the Moors in the 16th century. Twenty-seven tonnes of jasmine are now harvested in Grasse annually. There are numerous old 'parfumeries' in Grasse, such as Galimard, Molinard and Fragonard, each with tours and a museum.\nThe trade in leather and tanning work developed during the twelfth century around the small canal that runs through the city. This activity produced a strong unpleasant odour. At the time of the Renaissance perfume manufacturers began production of gloves, handbags and belt (clothing), to meet the new fashion from Italy with the entourage of Queen Catherine de Medici.\nThe countryside around the city began to grow fields of flowers, offering new scents from the city. In 1614, the king recognized the new corporation of \"glovers perfumers\". In the middle of the eighteenth century, the perfumery was experiencing a very important development. Leading companies dating from this period includes the oldest French perfumerie, and third oldest parfumerie in Europe, Galimard established in 1747. Introduction of new production methods turned perfume making into a real industry that could adapt to new market demands.\nIn the nineteenth century, the raw materials began to be imported from abroad. During the twentieth century the creation of synthetic products brought the democratization and affordability of perfumes and their spin-offs; (shampoos and deodorants, cream (pharmaceutical) and detergents, food flavouring for cookies, ice cream and dairy products, beverages, convenience foods, confectionery, preserves and syrups).\nIn 1905, six hundred tons of flowers were harvested while in the 1940s, five thousand tons were produced annually. However, in early 2000, production was less than 30 tons for all flowers combined.\nHistorical activity.\nIn the Middle Ages, Grasse specialised in leather tanning. Once tanned, the hides were often exported to Genoa or Pisa, cities that shared a commercial alliance with Grasse. Several centuries of this intense activity witnessed many technological advances within tanning industries. The hides of Grasse acquired a reputation for high quality. But the leather smelled bad, something that did not please the glove wearing nobility. This is when Jean de Galimard, a tanner in Grasse, came up with the idea of scented leather gloves. He offered a pair of scented gloves to Catherine de' Medici, who was seduced by the gift. Thereafter, the product spread through the Royal Court and high society, and this made a worldwide reputation for Grasse. The seventeenth century became the heyday of \"Glovers Perfumers\"; however, high taxes on leather and competition from Nice brought a decline for the leather industry in Grasse, and production of leather fragrance ceased. The rare scents from the Grasse (lavender, myrtle, jasmine, rose, orange blossom and wild mimosa) did win the title for the Grasse as the perfume capital of the world. Harvesting jasmine was a labour-intensive business only a few decades ago. Flowers had to be hand picked at dawn, when their scent is the most developed and immediately to be treated by cold enfleurage.\nModern industry.\nA network of sixty companies employs 3,500 people in the city and surrounding area. Additionally, about 10,000 residents of Grasse are indirectly employed by the perfume industry. Almost half of the business tax for the city comes from the perfume sector and that is ahead of tourism and services. The main activity of perfumery in Grasse is in the production of natural raw materials (essential oils, concretes, absolutes, resinoids and molecular distillation) and the production of concentrate, also called the juice. A concentrate is the main product that when diluted in at least 80% alcohol provides a perfume. Also, food flavourings, which have developed since the 1970s, account for over half of production output today.\nThis represents almost half of the production of French perfumes and aromas and around 7-8% of total global activity. However, during the 1960s and 1970s large international groups gradually bought up local family factories (Chiris, Givaudan-Roure and Lautier, for example). Soon after their production was often relocated overseas. Just 30 years ago most companies were focused on the production of raw materials. However, an overwhelming majority of the modern fragrances contain synthetic chemicals in part or in whole. Grasse perfume companies have therefore adapted by turning to aromatic synthesis and especially to food flavourings and successfully ended a long stagnation. The Grasse perfume industry cannot compete against large chemical multinationals, but it benefits greatly from the advantage of its knowledge of raw materials, facilities, contractors, etc. In addition, major brands such as Dior and Chanel have their own plantations of roses and jasmine in the vicinity of Grasse.\nPerfumeries.\nThree perfumeries, Fragonard, Molinard and Galimard opened their doors to the public and offer free tours that explain the processes of producing a perfume. It is possible to create one's own perfume, eau de perfume or eau de toilette and participate in all stages of manufacture from picking flowers to bottling.\nGrasse today.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe town is home to Grasse Cathedral, the seat of the Roman Catholic former Diocese of Grasse which was headed by the Bishops of Grasse. The town is home to the Lyc\u00e9e Amiral-de-Grasse and since 2019 one of two seats of the higher education engineering college ECAM-EPMI. RC Grasse is the local football club, whereas RO Grasse the local rugby union club. Grasse station offers railway connections with Cannes, Nice and Ventimiglia. From 1909 to 1938, the town centre was connected to the railway station by the Grasse Funicular.\nThere is an annual \"F\u00eate du Jasmin\" or \"La Jasminade\", at the beginning of August. The first festival was on August 3\u20134, 1946. Decorated floats drive through the town, with young women in skimpy costumes on board, throwing flowers into the crowd. Garlands of jasmine decorate the town centre, and the fire department fills a fire truck with jasmine-infused water to spray on the crowds. There are fireworks, free parties, folk music groups and street performers. There is also an annual international exhibition of roses (\"Expo Rose\") held in May each year.\nThree perfume factories offer daily tours and demonstrations, which draw in many of the region's visitors. In addition to the perfumeries, Grasse's other main attraction is the Cathedral, dedicated to Notre Dame du Puy and founded in the 11th century. In the interior, are three works by Rubens and one by Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard, the French painter native of the town.\nOther sights include:\nThe town is the setting in the final chapters of the novel \"Perfume\" by Patrick S\u00fcskind.

His material\u2014 encompassing a wide range of social issues including religion, politics, and philosophy\u2014 was controversial and often steeped in dark comedy.\nAt the age of 16, Hicks began performing at the Comedy Workshop in Houston, Texas. During the 1980s, he toured the United States extensively and made a number of high-profile television appearances, but he amassed a significant fan base in the United Kingdom, filling large venues during his 1991 tour. He also achieved some recognition as a guitarist and songwriter.\nHicks died of pancreatic cancer on February 26, 1994, at the age of 32. In subsequent years, his work gained significant acclaim in creative circles\u2014particularly after a series of posthumous album releases\u2014and he developed a substantial cult following. In 2007, he was number six on Channel 4's list of the \"100 Greatest Stand-Up Comics\", and rose to No. 4 on the 2010 list. In 2017, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked him number 13 on its list of the 50 best stand-up comics of all time.\nEarly life.\nHicks was born in Valdosta, Georgia, the son of James Melvin \"Jim\" Hicks (1923\u20132006) and Mary (Reese) Hicks. He had an older sister, Lynn, and an older brother, Steve. The family lived in Alabama, Florida, and New Jersey before settling in Houston, Texas, when Hicks was seven years old. He was drawn to comedy at an early age, emulating Woody Allen and Richard Pryor, and wrote routines with his friend Dwight Slade. While attending Stratford High School and the University of Houston, he began performing comedy (mostly derivations of Woody Allen material) for his classmates. At home, he wrote his own one-liners and slid them under the bedroom door of Steve, who he thought was a genius, for critical analysis. Steve told him, \"Keep it up. You're really good at this.\"\nEarly on, Hicks began to mock his family's Southern Baptist religious beliefs. He joked to the \"Houston Post\" in 1987, \"We were Yuppie Baptists. We worried about things like, 'If you scratch your neighbor's Subaru, should you leave a note?'\" Biographer Cynthia True described a typical argument with his father:\nHe was close with his family his whole life, though, and he did not reject spiritual ideology itself; throughout his life, he sought various alternative methods of experiencing it. Kevin Slade, elder brother of Dwight, introduced him to Transcendental Meditation and other forms of spirituality. Over one Thanksgiving weekend, he took Hicks and Dwight to a Transcendental Meditation residence course in Galveston. Worried about his rebellious behavior, his parents took him to a psychoanalyst at age 17. According to Hicks, the analyst took him aside after the first group session and told him, \"You can continue coming if you want to, but it's them, not you.\"\nCareer.\nBeginnings.\nHicks was associated with the Texas Outlaw Comics group developed at the Comedy Workshop in Houston in the 1980s.\nCalifornia and New York.\nBy January 1986, Hicks was using recreational drugs and his financial resources had dwindled. His career experienced an upturn in 1987, however, when he appeared on Rodney Dangerfield's \"Young Comedians Special\". The same year, he moved to New York City, and for the next five years performed about 300 times a year. On the album \"Relentless\", he jokes that he quit using drugs because \"once you've been taken aboard a UFO, it's kind of hard to top that\", although in his performances he continued to enthusiastically praise the virtues of LSD, marijuana, and psychedelic mushrooms.\nHe eventually fell back to chain smoking, a theme that figured heavily in his performances from then on. His nicotine addiction, love of smoking, and occasional attempts to quit became a recurring theme in his act throughout his later years.\nIn 1988, Hicks signed with his first professional business manager, Jack Mondrus.\nOn the track \"Modern Bummer\" of his 1990 album \"Dangerous\", Hicks says he quit drinking alcohol in 1988.\nIn 1989, he released his first video, \"Sane Man\"; a remastered version with 30 minutes of extra footage was released in 1999.\nEarly fame.\nIn 1990, Hicks released his first album, \"Dangerous\", performed on the HBO special \"One Night Stand\" and at Montreal's \"Just for Laughs\" festival. Hicks was later engaged to his manager, Colleen McGarr, who booked him there. He was also part of a group of American stand-up comedians performing in London's West End in November. Hicks was a huge hit in the UK and Ireland and continued touring there throughout 1991. That year, he returned to \"Just for Laughs\" and filmed his second video, \"Relentless.\"\nHicks made a brief detour into musical recording with the \"Marble Head Johnson\" album in 1992, collaborating with Houston high school friend Kevin Booth and Austin, Texas, drummer Pat Brown. During the same year, he toured the UK, where he recorded the \"Revelations\" video for Britain's Channel 4. He closed the show with his soon-to become-famous philosophy regarding life, \"It's Just a Ride.\" Also in that tour, he recorded the stand-up performance released in its entirety on a double CD titled \"Salvation.\" Hicks was voted \"Hot Standup Comic\" by \"Rolling Stone\" magazine in 1993.\nHicks and Tool.\nProgressive metal band Tool invited Hicks to open a number of concerts in its 1993 Lollapalooza appearances, where Hicks once asked the audience to look for a contact lens he had lost. Thousands of people complied.\nMembers of Tool felt that Hicks and they \"were resonating similar concepts\". Intending to raise awareness about Hicks's material and ideas, Tool dedicated their triple-platinum album \"\u00c6nima\" (1996) to Hicks. Both the lenticular casing of the \"\u00c6nima\" album packaging and the chorus of the title track \"\u00c6nema\" make reference to a sketch from Hicks's \"Arizona Bay\" album, in which he contemplates the idea of Los Angeles falling into the Pacific Ocean. \"\u00c6nima\"'s final track, \"Third Eye\", contains samples from Hicks's \"Dangerous\" and \"Relentless\" albums.\nAn alternate version of the \"\u00c6nima\" artwork shows a painting of Bill Hicks, calling him \"Another Dead Hero\", and mentions of Hicks are found both in the liner notes and on the record.\nCensorship and aftermath.\nIn 1984, Hicks had been invited to appear on \"Late Night with David Letterman\" for the first time. He had a joke that he used frequently in comedy clubs about how he caused a serious accident that left a classmate using a wheelchair. NBC had a policy that no jokes about the handicapped could be aired, making his stand-up routine difficult to perform without mentioning words such as \"wheelchair\".\nOn October 1, 1993, Hicks was scheduled to appear on \"Late Show with David Letterman\" on CBS, where Letterman had recently moved. It was his 12th appearance on a Letterman late-night show, but his entire performance was removed from the broadcast. At that point, it was the only occasion where a comedian's entire routine was cut after taping. His stand-up routine was removed from the show, Hicks said, because Letterman's producers believed the material, which included jokes involving religion and the anti-abortion movement, was unsuitable for broadcast. Producer Robert Morton initially blamed CBS, which denied responsibility; Morton later conceded it was his decision. Although Letterman later expressed regret at the way the situation had been handled, Hicks did not appear on the show again. Hicks was undergoing chemotherapy at the time of his final \"Late Show\" appearance, unbeknownst to Letterman and most others outside of Hicks's family. He would die less than four months later.\nLetterman aired the censored routine in its entirety on January 30, 2009. Hicks's mother, Mary, was present in the studio and appeared on-camera as a guest. Letterman took responsibility for the original decision to remove Hicks's set from the 1993 show. \"It says more about me as a guy than it says about Bill,\" he said, after the set aired, \"because there was absolutely nothing wrong with that\".\nDenis Leary's alleged plagiarism.\nFor many years, Hicks was friends with fellow comedian Denis Leary, but in 1993, he was angered by Leary's album \"No Cure for Cancer\", which featured lines and subject matter similar to his own routine. According to \"American Scream: The Bill Hicks Story\" by Cynthia True, hearing the album had infuriated Hicks. \"All these years, aside from the occasional jibe, he had pretty much shrugged off Leary's lifting. Comedians borrowed, stole stuff, and even bought bits from one another. Milton Berle and Robin Williams were famous for it. This was different. Leary had practically taken line for line huge chunks of Bill's act and \"recorded\" it.\" As a result, the friendship ended abruptly.\nAt least three stand-up comedians have stated on-record that Leary stole Hicks's material, and copied his persona and attitude. In an interview, when Hicks was asked why he had quit smoking, he answered, \"I just wanted to see if Denis would, too.\" In another interview, Hicks said, \"I have a scoop for you. I stole [Leary's] act. I camouflaged it with punchlines, and to really throw people off, I did it before he did.\" During a 2003 Comedy Central Roast of Leary, comedian Lenny Clarke said that a carton of cigarettes from Hicks was backstage, with the message, \"Wish I had gotten these to you sooner.\" This joke was cut from the final broadcast.\n\"American Scream\" describes an incident in the plagiarism controversy:\nMaterial and style.\nHicks' performance style was seen as a play on his audience's emotions. He expressed anger, disgust, and apathy while addressing the audience in a casual and personal manner, which he likened to merely conversing with his friends. He would invite his audiences to challenge authority and the existential nature of \"accepted truth\". One such message, which he often used in his shows, was delivered in the style of a news report (to draw attention to the negative slant news organizations give to any story about drugs):\nAmerican philosopher and ethnomycologist Terence McKenna was a frequent source of Hicks' most controversial psychedelic and philosophical counter-cultural material; Hicks infamously acted out an abridged version of McKenna's \"Stoned Ape\" model of human evolution as a routine during several of his final shows.\nAnother of Hicks' most-delivered lines was given during a gig in Chicago in 1989 (later released as the bootleg \"I'm Sorry, Folks\"). After a heckler repeatedly shouted \"Free Bird\", Hicks screamed, \"Hitler had the right idea; he was just an underachiever!\" Hicks followed this remark with a misanthropic tirade calling for unbiased genocide against the whole of humanity.\nMuch of Hicks' routine involved direct attacks on mainstream society, religion, politics, and consumerism. In an interview recorded after one of Hicks' shows in Santa Monica and aired as part of the six-episode BBC Two series \"Funny Business\" in 1992, Hicks was asked if audiences got upset by what he said on stage. He responded by saying that occasionally audience members did not find his material funny but that not only would it be impossible to please everyone, it was not his responsibility to do so. He recounted an instance in which an audience member snidely told him \"We don't come to comedy to think!\" \"Gee, where do you go to think?\" mused Hicks. \"I'll meet you there. We don't have to do this here!\" When one of the interviewers then asked whether there was not a halfway point between pleasing and offending audiences, Hicks pushed back, replying \"But my way \"is\" halfway between. I mean, this is a night club and, you know, these are adults, what do you expect? What you're going to see on TV? No. This isn't TV live. And also, it's my show. What am I supposed to do? Change my own outlook and my beliefs? To be what to them?\" Arguing that to simply give audiences what they wanted would be a form of condescension, Hicks explained that his approach was instead to speak to audiences on equal footing, as though they were his friends. When one of the interviewers challenged that audiences just wanted to be entertained, an exasperated Hicks asked, \"When did thinking not become entertaining? ... What am I supposed to do? Am I supposed to go out and tickle them individually? We have to express an idea here.\"\nHicks was strongly against political correctness, and jokingly stated that the politically correct should be \"hunted down and killed.\"\nHicks often discussed popular conspiracy theories in his performances, most notably the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. He mocked the Warren Report and the official version of Lee Harvey Oswald as a \"lone nut assassin\". He also questioned the guilt of David Koresh and the Branch Davidian compound during the Waco Siege. Hicks ended some of his shows, especially those being recorded in front of larger audiences as albums, with a mock \"assassination\" of himself on stage, making gunshot sound effects into the microphone while falling to the ground.\nIllness and death.\nOn June 16, 1993, Hicks was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer that had spread to his liver.\nHe still toured and also recorded his album, \"Arizona Bay\", while receiving weekly chemotherapy. \nFollowing his cancer diagnosis, Hicks often joked that any given performance could be his last. The public, however, was unaware of his condition, and only a few close friends and family members knew of the disease. He performed the final show of his career at Caroline's in New York on January 6, 1994; he moved back to his parents' house in Little Rock shortly thereafter. \nIn his last weeks, Hicks re-read J. R. R. Tolkien's \"The Lord of the Rings\", and made telephone calls to friends to say goodbye before he stopped speaking on February 14, 1994. He died on February 26 at the age of 32, and was buried in the family grave plot in Magnolia Cemetery located in Leakesville, Mississippi.\nIn early 1995, Hicks's family released a brief essay he had written weeks before his death:\nLegacy.\nHicks' albums \"Arizona Bay\" and \"Rant in E-Minor\" were released posthumously in 1997 on the Voices imprint of the Rykodisc label. \"Dangerous\" and \"Relentless\" were re-released simultaneously.\nAt the time of his death, Hicks was working with comedian Fallon Woodland on a pilot episode of a new talk show, titled \"Counts of the Netherworld\" for Channel 4. The budget and concept had been approved, and a pilot was filmed. The \"Counts of the Netherworld\" pilot was shown at the various Tenth-Anniversary Tribute Night events around the world on February 26, 2004. \nIn a 2005 poll to find the Comedian's Comedian, comedians and comedy insiders voted Hicks 13th on their list of \"The Top 20 Greatest Comedy Acts Ever\". In \"Comedy Central Presents: 100 Greatest Stand-ups of All Time\" (2004), Hicks was ranked 19th. In March 2007, he was voted sixth on Britain's Channel 4 list of the 100 Greatest Stand-Up Comics, and rose to number four on the 2010 list.\nDevotees have incorporated Hicks's words, image, and attitude into their own creations. By means of audio sampling, fragments of his rants, diatribes, social criticisms, and philosophies have found their way into many musical works, such as the live version of Super Furry Animals' \"The Man Don't Give a Fuck\" and Adam Freeland's \"We Want Your Soul\". His influence on the band Tool is well documented, and he is sampled at the beginning of their song \"Third Eye\" on \"\u00c6nima\" (1996); he \"appears\" on the Fila Brazillia album \"Maim That Tune\" (1995) and on SPA's eponymously titled album \"SPA\" (1997), which are both dedicated to Hicks; and the British band Radiohead's second album \"The Bends\" (1995) is also dedicated to his memory. Hicks' joke \"It's always funny until someone gets hurt; then it's just hilarious\" is used as the chorus of Faith No More's song \"Ricochet\", from their 1995 album \"King for a Day... Fool for a Lifetime\". American indie rock band Built to Spill's song \"Planting Seeds\" on its 2009 album \"There Is No Enemy\" alludes to Hicks's routine on advertising and marketing, which appears on the performance film \"Bill Hicks: Revelations\". Singer/songwriter Tom Waits listed \"Rant in E-Minor\" as one of his 20 most cherished albums of all time.\nComedians who have cited Hicks as an inspiration include Joe Rogan, Dave Attell, Lewis Black, Patton Oswalt, David Cross, Russell Brand, Ron White, Frankie Boyle, Jimmy Dore, Lee Camp and Brendon Burns. The political cartoonist \"Mr. Fish\" described in 2022 how he learned from Hicks. \nBritish actor Chas Early portrayed Hicks in the one-man stage show \"Bill Hicks: Slight Return\", which premiered in 2004. The show was co-written by Early and Richard Hurst, and imagined Hicks's view of the world 10 years after his death.\nHicks is mentioned in the 1999 British film \"Human Traffic\". In the movie, the young and hip club-going protagonist, \"Jip\", praises Hicks as an alternative thinker, and explains that he needs to get a regular infusion of Hicks's insights. Before leaving his house to start on the movie's main adventure, Jip states: \"... first a daily injection of the late prophet Bill Hicks\u00a0... just to remind me not to take life too seriously.\" He then watches a clip of one of Hicks's rants about drugs, and how they had never affected him badly.\nOn February 25, 2004, British MP Stephen Pound tabled an early day motion titled \"Anniversary of the Death of Bill Hicks\" (EDM 678 of the 2003\u201304 session), the text of which reads:\nHicks appeared in a flashback scene in writer Garth Ennis's Vertigo comic-book series \"Preacher\", in the story \"Underworld\" in issue No. 31 (Nov. 1997).\nCriticism.\nSome comedians and writers have been critical of Hicks's legacy since his death. Jimmy Carr, in his book \"The Naked Jape\" (co-written with Lucy Greeves), wrote that Hicks \"was one of the most celebrated recent exponents of loud, impassioned political stand-up. When Hicks got it right, when he resisted the cheap shock tactics and hit his evangelical peak, it was awesome... But the truth is that even Hicks missed his mark a lot of the time, resulting in an act that was neither funny nor moving.\" Stewart Lee said Hicks's \"first two albums have dated badly, with their adolescent potshots at inoffensive figures from popular culture, and self-conscious rock'n'roll cool.\"\nDara \u00d3 Briain has criticised what he calls \"the hagiography that surrounds Bill Hicks\", saying that \"Hicks has become the poster boy for a rock-journalism view of comedy, one that thinks that the only decent comedy is a very angry kind. Which is absolute nonsense and has become a complete cliche in the industry.\"\nFilm and documentary.\nA documentary titled \", based on interviews with his family and friends, premiered on March 12, 2010, at the South by Southwest Film Festival in Austin, Texas.\nRussell Crowe announced in 2012 that he would direct a Bill Hicks biopic. Crowe was originally thought to be playing the comedian, but Mark Staufer, the actor's schoolmate and writer on the film, suggested the part remained open for casting. Joseph Gordon-Levitt was frequently mentioned as a choice by fans. Production was expected to start in 2013, but as of 2018 no further announcements regarding the film's progress have been made.\nOn October 28, 2018, it was announced that Richard Linklater was set to direct a biopic about Bill Hicks for the film production company Focus Features. As of December 2024, the project remains in development according to IMDB.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "46095", "revid": "1319080848", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46095", "title": "Russell's paradox", "text": "Paradox in set theory\nIn mathematical logic, Russell's paradox (also known as Russell's antinomy) is a set-theoretic paradox published by the British philosopher and mathematician, Bertrand Russell, in 1901. Russell's paradox shows that every set theory that contains an unrestricted comprehension principle leads to contradictions. \nAccording to the unrestricted comprehension principle, for any sufficiently well-defined property, there is the set of all and only the objects that have that property. Let \"R\" be the set of all sets that are not members of themselves. (This set is sometimes called \"the Russell set\".) If \"R\" is not a member of itself, then its definition entails that it is a member of itself; yet, if it is a member of itself, then it is not a member of itself, since it is the set of all sets that are not members of themselves. The resulting contradiction is Russell's paradox. In symbols:\n Let formula_1. Then formula_2.\nRussell also showed that a version of the paradox could be derived in the axiomatic system constructed by the German philosopher and mathematician Gottlob Frege, hence undermining Frege's attempt to reduce mathematics to logic and calling into question the logicist programme. Two influential ways of avoiding the paradox were both proposed in 1908: Russell's own type theory and the Zermelo set theory. In particular, Zermelo's axioms restricted the unlimited comprehension principle. With the additional contributions of Abraham Fraenkel, Zermelo set theory developed into the standard Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory (commonly known as ZFC when including the axiom of choice). The main difference between Russell's and Zermelo's solution to the paradox is that Zermelo modified the axioms of set theory while maintaining a standard logical language, while Russell modified the logical language itself. The language of ZFC, with the help of Thoralf Skolem, turned out to be that of first-order logic.\nThe paradox had already been discovered independently in 1899 by the German mathematician Ernst Zermelo. However, Zermelo did not publish the idea, which remained known only to David Hilbert, Edmund Husserl, and other academics at the University of G\u00f6ttingen. At the end of the 1890s, Georg Cantor \u2013 considered the founder of modern set theory \u2013 had already realized that his theory would lead to a contradiction, as he told Hilbert and Richard Dedekind by letter.\nInformal presentation.\nMost sets commonly encountered are not members of themselves. Call a set \"normal\" if it is not a member of itself, and \"abnormal\" if it is a member of itself. Clearly every set must be either normal or abnormal. For example, consider the set of all squares in a plane. This set is not itself a square in the plane, thus it is not a member of itself and is therefore normal. In contrast, the complementary set that contains everything which is not a square in the plane is itself not a square in the plane, and so it is one of its own members and is therefore abnormal.\nConsider the set of all normal sets, \"R\", and try to determine whether \"R\" is normal or abnormal. If \"R\" were normal, it would be contained in the set of all normal sets (itself), and therefore be abnormal; on the other hand if \"R\" were abnormal, it would not be contained in the set of all normal sets (itself), and therefore be normal. This leads to the conclusion that \"R\" is neither normal nor abnormal: Russell's paradox.\nFormal presentation.\nThe term \"naive set theory\" is used in various ways. In one usage, naive set theory is a formal theory, that is formulated in a first-order language with a binary non-logical predicate formula_3, and that includes the axiom of extensionality:\n formula_4\nand the axiom schema of unrestricted comprehension:\n formula_5\nfor any predicate formula_6 with x as a free variable inside formula_6. Substitute formula_8 for formula_9 to get\n formula_10\nThen by existential instantiation (reusing the symbol formula_11) and universal instantiation we have\n formula_12\na contradiction. Therefore, this naive set theory is inconsistent.\nPhilosophical implications.\nPrior to Russell's paradox (and to other similar paradoxes discovered around the time, such as the Burali-Forti paradox), a common conception of the idea of set was the \"extensional concept of set\", as recounted by von Neumann and Morgenstern:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A set is an arbitrary collection of objects, absolutely no restriction being placed on the nature and number of these objects, the elements of the set in question. The elements constitute and determine the set as such, without any ordering or relationship of any kind between them.\nIn particular, there was no distinction between sets and proper classes as collections of objects. Additionally, the existence of each of the elements of a collection was seen as sufficient for the existence of the set of said elements. However, paradoxes such as Russell's and Burali-Forti's showed the impossibility of this conception of a set, by examples of collections of objects that do not form sets, despite all said objects being existent.\nSet-theoretic responses.\nFrom the principle of explosion of classical logic, \"any\" proposition can be proved from a contradiction. Therefore, the presence of contradictions like Russell's paradox in an axiomatic set theory is disastrous; since if any formula can be proved true it destroys the conventional meaning of truth and falsity. Further, since set theory was seen as the basis for an axiomatic development of all other branches of mathematics, Russell's paradox threatened the foundations of mathematics as a whole. This motivated a great deal of research around the turn of the 20th century to develop a consistent (contradiction-free) set theory.\nIn 1908, Ernst Zermelo proposed an axiomatization of set theory that avoided the paradoxes of naive set theory by replacing arbitrary set comprehension with weaker existence axioms, such as his axiom of separation (\"Aussonderung\"). (Avoiding paradox was not Zermelo's original intention, but instead to document which assumptions he used in proving the well-ordering theorem.) Modifications to this axiomatic theory proposed in the 1920s by Abraham Fraenkel, Thoralf Skolem, and by Zermelo himself resulted in the axiomatic set theory called ZFC. This theory became widely accepted once Zermelo's axiom of choice ceased to be controversial, and ZFC has remained the canonical axiomatic set theory down to the modern day.\nZFC does not assume that, for every property, there is a set of all things satisfying that property. Rather, it asserts that given any set \"X\", any subset of \"X\" definable using first-order logic exists. The object \"R\" defined by Russell's paradox above cannot be constructed as a subset of any set \"X\", and is therefore not a set in ZFC. In some extensions of ZFC, like von Neumann\u2013Bernays\u2013G\u00f6del set theory, objects like \"R\" are called proper classes.\nZFC is silent about types, although the cumulative hierarchy has a notion of layers that resemble types. Zermelo himself never accepted Skolem's formulation of ZFC using the language of first-order logic. As Jos\u00e9 Ferreir\u00f3s notes, Zermelo insisted instead that \"propositional functions (conditions or predicates) used for separating off subsets, as well as the replacement functions, can be 'entirely \"arbitrary\"' [ganz \"beliebig\"]\"; the modern interpretation given to this statement is that Zermelo wanted to include higher-order quantification in order to avoid Skolem's paradox. Around 1930, Zermelo also introduced (apparently independently of von Neumann), the axiom of foundation, thus\u2014as Ferreir\u00f3s observes\u2014\"by forbidding 'circular' and 'ungrounded' sets, it [ZFC] incorporated one of the crucial motivations of TT [type theory]\u2014the principle of the types of arguments\". This 2nd order ZFC preferred by Zermelo, including axiom of foundation, allowed a rich cumulative hierarchy. Ferreir\u00f3s writes that \"Zermelo's 'layers' are essentially the same as the types in the contemporary versions of simple TT [type theory] offered by G\u00f6del and Tarski. The cumulative hierarchy into which Zermelo developed his models can be described as the universe of a cumulative TT in which transfinite types are allowed. (Once an impredicative standpoint is adopted, abandoning the idea that classes are constructed, it is natural to accept transfinite types.) Thus, simple TT and ZFC could be regarded as systems that 'talk' essentially about the same intended objects. The main difference is that TT relies on a strong higher-order logic, while Zermelo employed second-order logic, and ZFC can also be given a first-order formulation. The first-order 'description' of the cumulative hierarchy is much weaker, as is shown by the existence of countable models (Skolem's paradox), but it enjoys some important advantages.\"\nIn ZFC, given a set \"A\", it is possible to define a set \"B\" that consists of exactly the sets in \"A\" that are not members of themselves. \"B\" cannot be in \"A\" by the same reasoning in Russell's Paradox. This variation of Russell's paradox shows that no set contains everything.\nThrough the work of Zermelo and others, especially John von Neumann, the structure of what some see as the \"natural\" objects described by ZFC eventually became clear: they are the elements of the von Neumann universe, \"V\", built up from the empty set by transfinitely iterating the power set operation. It is thus possible again to reason about sets in a non-axiomatic fashion without running afoul of Russell's paradox, namely by reasoning about the elements of \"V\". Whether it is \"appropriate\" to think of sets in this way is a point of contention among the rival points of view on the philosophy of mathematics.\nOther solutions to Russell's paradox, with an underlying strategy closer to that of type theory, include Quine's New Foundations and Scott\u2013Potter set theory. Yet another approach is to define multiple membership relation with appropriately modified comprehension scheme, as in the Double extension set theory.\nHistory.\nRussell discovered the paradox in May or June 1901. By his own account in his 1919 \"Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy\", he \"attempted to discover some flaw in Cantor's proof that there is no greatest cardinal\". In a 1902 letter, he announced the discovery to Gottlob Frege of the paradox in Frege's 1879 \"Begriffsschrift\" and framed the problem in terms of both logic and set theory, and in particular in terms of Frege's definition of function:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;There is just one point where I have encountered a difficulty. You state (p. 17 [p. 23 above]) that a function too, can act as the indeterminate element. This I formerly believed, but now this view seems doubtful to me because of the following contradiction. Let w be the predicate: to be a predicate that cannot be predicated of itself. Can w be predicated of itself? From each answer its opposite follows. Therefore we must conclude that w is not a predicate. Likewise there is no class (as a totality) of those classes which, each taken as a totality, do not belong to themselves. From this I conclude that under certain circumstances a definable collection [Menge] does not form a totality.\nRussell would go on to cover it at length in his 1903 \"The Principles of Mathematics\", where he repeated his first encounter with the paradox:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Before taking leave of fundamental questions, it is necessary to examine more in detail the singular contradiction, already mentioned, with regard to predicates not predicable of themselves. ... I may mention that I was led to it in the endeavour to reconcile Cantor's proof...\nRussell wrote to Frege about the paradox just as Frege was preparing the second volume of his \"Grundgesetze der Arithmetik\". Frege responded to Russell very quickly; his letter dated 22 June 1902 appeared, with van Heijenoort's commentary in Heijenoort 1967:126\u2013127. Frege then wrote an appendix admitting to the paradox, and proposed a solution that Russell would endorse in his \"Principles of Mathematics\", but was later considered by some to be unsatisfactory. For his part, Russell had his work at the printers and he added an appendix on the doctrine of types.\nErnst Zermelo in his (1908) \"A new proof of the possibility of a well-ordering\" (published at the same time he published \"the first axiomatic set theory\") laid claim to prior discovery of the antinomy in Cantor's naive set theory. He states: \"And yet, even the elementary form that Russell9 gave to the set-theoretic antinomies could have persuaded them [J. K\u00f6nig, Jourdain, F. Bernstein] that the solution of these difficulties is not to be sought in the surrender of well-ordering but only in a suitable restriction of the notion of set\". Footnote 9 is where he stakes his claim:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;9\"1903\", pp. 366\u2013368. I had, however, discovered this antinomy myself, independently of Russell, and had communicated it prior to 1903 to Professor Hilbert among others.\nFrege sent a copy of his \"Grundgesetze der Arithmetik\" to Hilbert; as noted above, Frege's last volume mentioned the paradox that Russell had communicated to Frege. After receiving Frege's last volume, on 7 November 1903, Hilbert wrote a letter to Frege in which he said, referring to Russell's paradox, \"I believe Dr. Zermelo discovered it three or four years ago\". A written account of Zermelo's actual argument was discovered in the \"Nachlass\" of Edmund Husserl.\nIn 1923, Ludwig Wittgenstein proposed to \"dispose\" of Russell's paradox as follows:\nThe reason why a function cannot be its own argument is that the sign for a function already contains the prototype of its argument, and it cannot contain itself. For let us suppose that the function F(fx) could be its own argument: in that case there would be a proposition F(F(fx)), in which the outer function F and the inner function F must have different meanings, since the inner one has the form O(fx) and the outer one has the form Y(O(fx)). Only the letter 'F' is common to the two functions, but the letter by itself signifies nothing. This immediately becomes clear if instead of F(Fu) we write (do) : F(Ou) . Ou = Fu. That disposes of Russell's paradox. (\"Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus\", 3.333)\nRussell and Alfred North Whitehead wrote their three-volume \"Principia Mathematica\" hoping to achieve what Frege had been unable to do. They sought to banish the paradoxes of naive set theory by employing a theory of types they devised for this purpose. While they succeeded in grounding arithmetic in a fashion, it is not at all evident that they did so by purely logical means. While \"Principia Mathematica\" avoided the known paradoxes and allows the derivation of a great deal of mathematics, its system gave rise to new problems.\nIn any case, Kurt G\u00f6del in 1930\u201331 proved that while the logic of much of \"Principia Mathematica\", later known as first-order logic, is complete, Peano arithmetic is necessarily incomplete if it is consistent. This is very widely\u2014though not universally\u2014regarded as having shown the logicist program of Frege to be impossible to complete.\nIn 2001, A Centenary International Conference celebrating the first hundred years of Russell's paradox was held in Munich and its proceedings have been published.\nApplied versions.\nSome versions of this paradox are closer to real-life and may be easier to understand for non-logicians. For example, the barber paradox supposes a male barber who shaves all men who do not shave themselves and only men who do not shave themselves. When one thinks about whether the barber shaves himself or not, a similar paradox begins to emerge.\nAn exception may be the Grelling\u2013Nelson paradox, in which words and meaning are the elements of the scenario rather than people and hair-cutting. Though it is easy to refute the barber's paradox by saying that such a barber does not (and \"cannot\") exist, it is impossible to say something similar about a meaningfully defined word.\nOne way that the paradox has been dramatised is: suppose that every public library has to compile a catalogue of all its books. Since the catalogue is itself one of the library's books, some librarians include it in the catalogue for completeness; while others leave it out as it being one of the library's books is self evident. Next, imagine that all these catalogues are sent to the national library. Some of them include themselves in their listings, others do not. The national librarian compiles two master catalogues\u2014one of all the catalogues that list themselves, and one of all those that do not.\nThe question is: should these master catalogues list themselves? The 'catalogue of all catalogues that list themselves' is no problem. If the librarian does not include it in its own listing, it remains a true catalogue of those catalogues that do include themselves. If he does include it, it remains a true catalogue of those that list themselves. However, just as the librarian cannot go wrong with the first master catalogue, he is doomed to fail with the second. When it comes to the 'catalogue of all catalogues that do not list themselves', the librarian cannot include it in its own listing, because then it would include itself, and so belong in the other catalogue, that of catalogues that do include themselves. However, if the librarian leaves it out, the catalogue is incomplete. Either way, it can never be a true master catalogue of catalogues that do not list themselves.\nApplications and related topics.\nRussell-like paradoxes.\nAs illustrated above for the barber paradox, Russell's paradox is not hard to extend. Take:\nForm the sentence:\n The \u27e8V\u27e9er that \u27e8V\u27e9s all (and only those) who do not \u27e8V\u27e9 themselves,\nSometimes the \"all\" is replaced by \"all \u27e8V\u27e9ers\".\nAn example would be \"paint\":\n The \"paint\"er that \"paint\"s all (and only those) that do not \"paint\" themselves.\nor \"elect\"\n The \"elect\"or (representative), that \"elect\"s all that do not \"elect\" themselves.\nIn the Season 8 episode of \"The Big Bang Theory\", \"The Skywalker Intrusion\", Sheldon Cooper analyzes the song \"Play That Funky Music\", concluding that the lyrics present a musical example of Russell's Paradox.\nParadoxes that fall in this scheme include:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "46096", "revid": "50681226", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46096", "title": "Simpson's paradox", "text": "Error in statistical reasoning with groups\nSimpson's paradox is a phenomenon in probability and statistics in which a trend appears in several groups of data but disappears or reverses when the groups are combined. This result is often encountered in social-science and medical-science statistics, and is particularly problematic when frequency data are unduly given causal interpretations. The paradox can be resolved when confounding variables and causal relations are appropriately addressed in the statistical modeling (e.g., through cluster analysis).\nSimpson's paradox has been used to illustrate the kind of misleading results that the misuse of statistics can generate.\nEdward H. Simpson first described this phenomenon in a technical paper in 1951; the statisticians Karl Pearson (in 1899) and Udny Yule (in 1903) had mentioned similar effects earlier. The name \"Simpson's paradox\" was introduced by Colin R. Blyth in 1972. It is also referred to as Simpson's reversal, the Yule\u2013Simpson effect, the amalgamation paradox, or the reversal paradox.\nExamples.\nUC Berkeley gender bias.\nOne of the best-known examples of Simpson's paradox comes from a study of gender bias among graduate school admissions to University of California, Berkeley. The admission figures for the fall of 1973 showed that men applying were more likely than women to be admitted, and the difference was so large that it was unlikely to be due to chance.\nHowever, when taking into account the information about departments being applied to, the different rejection percentages reveal the different difficulty of getting into the department, and at the same time it showed that women tended to apply to more competitive departments with lower rates of admission, even among qualified applicants (such as in the English department), whereas men tended to apply to less competitive departments with higher rates of admission (such as in the engineering department). The pooled and corrected data showed a \"small but statistically significant bias in favor of women\".\nThe data from the six largest departments are listed below:\nThe entire data showed total of 4 out of 85 departments to be significantly biased against women, while 6 to be significantly biased against men (not all present in the 'six largest departments' table above). Notably, the numbers of biased departments were not the basis for the conclusion, but rather it was the gender admissions pooled across all departments, while weighing by each department's rejection rate across all of its applicants.\nKidney stone treatment.\nAnother example comes from a real-life medical study comparing the success rates of two treatments for kidney stones. The table below shows the success rates (the term \"success rate\" here actually means the success proportion) and numbers of treatments for treatments involving both small and large kidney stones, where Treatment A includes open surgical procedures and Treatment B includes closed surgical procedures. The numbers in parentheses indicate the number of success cases over the total size of the group.\nThe paradoxical conclusion is that treatment A is more effective when used on small stones, and also when used on large stones, yet treatment B appears to be more effective when considering both sizes at the same time. In this example, the \"lurking\" variable (or confounding variable) causing the paradox is the size of the stones, which was not previously known to researchers to be important until its effects were included.\nWhich treatment is considered better is determined by which success ratio (successes/total) is larger. The reversal of the inequality between the two ratios when considering the combined data, which creates Simpson's paradox, happens because two effects occur together:\nBased on these effects, the paradoxical result is seen to arise because the effect of the size of the stones overwhelms the benefits of the better treatment (A). In short, the less effective treatment B appeared to be more effective because it was applied more frequently to the small stones cases, which were easier to treat, so that whichever treatment was selected was more likely to be successful.\nJaynes argues that the correct conclusion is that though treatment A remains noticeably better than treatment B, the kidney stone size is more important.\nBatting averages.\nA common example of Simpson's paradox involves the batting averages of players in professional baseball. It is possible for one player to have a higher batting average than another player each year for a number of years, but to have a lower batting average across all of those years. This phenomenon can occur when there are large differences in the number of at bats between the years. Mathematician Ken Ross demonstrated this using the batting average of two baseball players, Derek Jeter and David Justice, during the years 1995 and 1996:\nIn both 1995 and 1996, Justice had a higher batting average (in bold type) than Jeter did. However, when the two baseball seasons are combined, Jeter shows a higher batting average than Justice. According to Ross, this phenomenon would be observed about once per year among the possible pairs of players.\nVector interpretation.\nSimpson's paradox can also be illustrated using a 2-dimensional vector space. A success rate of formula_1 (i.e., \"successes/attempts\") can be represented by a vector formula_2, with a slope of formula_1. A steeper vector then represents a greater success rate. If two rates formula_4 and formula_5 are combined, as in the examples given above, the result can be represented by the sum of the vectors formula_6 and formula_7, which according to the parallelogram rule is the vector formula_8, with slope formula_9.\nSimpson's paradox says that even if a vector formula_10 (in orange in figure) has a smaller slope than another vector formula_11 (in blue), and formula_12 has a smaller slope than formula_13, the sum of the two vectors formula_14 can potentially still have a larger slope than the sum of the two vectors formula_15, as shown in the example. For this to occur one of the orange vectors must have a greater slope than one of the blue vectors (here formula_12 and formula_11), and these will generally be longer than the alternatively subscripted vectors\u00a0\u2013 thereby dominating the overall comparison.\nCorrelation between variables.\nSimpson's reversal can also arise in correlations, in which two variables appear to have (say) a positive correlation towards one another, when in fact they have a negative correlation, the reversal having been brought about by a \"lurking\" confounder. Berman et al. give an example from economics, where a dataset suggests overall demand is positively correlated with price (that is, higher prices lead to \"more\" demand), in contradiction of expectation. Analysis reveals time to be the confounding variable: plotting both price and demand against time reveals the expected negative correlation over various periods, which then reverses to become positive if the influence of time is ignored by simply plotting demand against price.\nPsychology.\nPsychological interest in Simpson's paradox seeks to explain why people deem sign reversal to be impossible at first. The question is where people get this strong intuition from, and how it is encoded in the mind.\nSimpson's paradox demonstrates that this intuition cannot be derived from either classical logic or probability calculus alone, and thus led philosophers to speculate that it is supported by an innate causal logic that guides people in reasoning about actions and their consequences. Savage's sure-thing principle is an example of what such logic may entail. A qualified version of Savage's sure thing principle can indeed be derived from Pearl's \"do\"-calculus and reads: \"An action \"A\" that increases the probability of an event \"B\" in each subpopulation \"Ci\" of \"C\" must also increase the probability of \"B\" in the population as a whole, provided that the action does not change the distribution of the subpopulations.\" This suggests that knowledge about actions and consequences is stored in a form resembling Causal Bayesian Networks.\nProbability.\nA paper by Pavlides and Perlman presents a proof, due to Hadjicostas, that in a random 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 table with uniform distribution, Simpson's paradox will occur with a probability of exactly &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u204460. A study by Kock suggests that the probability that Simpson's paradox would occur at random in path models (i.e., models generated by path analysis) with two predictors and one criterion variable is approximately 12.8 percent; slightly higher than 1 occurrence per 8 path models.\nSimpson's second paradox.\nA second, less well-known paradox was also discussed in Simpson's 1951 paper. It can occur when the \"sensible interpretation\" is not necessarily found in the separated data, like in the kidney stone example, but can instead reside in the combined data. Whether the partitioned or combined form of the data should be used hinges on the process giving rise to the data, meaning the correct interpretation of the data cannot always be determined by simply observing the tables.\nJudea Pearl has shown that, in order for the partitioned data to represent the correct causal relationships between any two variables, formula_18 and formula_19, the partitioning variables must satisfy a graphical condition called \"back-door criterion\":\nThis criterion provides an algorithmic solution to Simpson's second paradox, and explains why the correct interpretation cannot be determined by data alone; two different graphs, both compatible with the data, may dictate two different back-door criteria.\nWhen the back-door criterion is satisfied by a set \"Z\" of covariates, the adjustment formula (see confounding) gives the correct causal effect of \"X\" on \"Y\". If no such set exists, Pearl's \"do\"-calculus can be invoked to discover other ways of estimating the causal effect. The completeness of \"do\"-calculus can be viewed as offering a complete resolution of the Simpson's paradox.\nCriticism.\nOne criticism is that the paradox is not really a paradox at all, but rather a failure to properly account for confounding variables or to consider causal relationships between variables. Focus on the paradox may distract from these more important statistical issues.\nAnother criticism of the apparent Simpson's paradox is that it may be a result of the specific way that data are stratified or grouped. The phenomenon may disappear or even reverse if the data is stratified differently or if different confounding variables are considered. Simpson's example actually highlighted a phenomenon called noncollapsibility, which occurs when subgroups with high proportions do not make simple averages when combined. This suggests that the paradox may not be a universal phenomenon, but rather a specific instance of a more general statistical issue.\nDespite these criticisms, the apparent Simpson's paradox remains a popular and intriguing topic in statistics and data analysis. It continues to be studied and debated by researchers and practitioners in a wide range of fields, and it serves as a valuable reminder of the importance of careful statistical analysis and the potential pitfalls of simplistic interpretations of data.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Any party, faction, or politician may be labeled \"green\" if it emphasizes environmental causes. In contrast, formally organized Green parties may follow an ideology that includes not only environmentalism, but often also other concerns such as social justice and consensus decision-making. The Global Greens Charter lists six guiding principles which are ecological wisdom, social justice, participatory democracy, nonviolence, sustainability and respect for diversity.\nHistory.\nPolitical parties campaigning on a predominantly environmental platform arose in the early 1970s in various parts of the world.\nThe world's first political parties to campaign on a predominantly environmental platform were the United Tasmania Group, which contested the April 1972 state election in Tasmania, Australia, and the Values Party of New Zealand, which contested the November 1972 New Zealand general election. Their use of the name 'Green' derived from the 'Green Bans': an Australian movement of building workers who refused to build on sites of cultural and environmental significance.\nThe first green party in Europe was the Popular Movement for the Environment, founded in 1972 in the Swiss canton of Neuch\u00e2tel. The first national green party in Europe was PEOPLE, founded in Britain in February 1973, which eventually turned into the Ecology Party and then the Green Party. Several other local political groups were founded in the beginning of the 1970s. Fons Sprangers was probably the first Green mayor in the world, elected in 1970 in Meer, and active until 2020 for the Flemish Greens. The first political party to use the name \"Green\" seems to have been the Lower Saxon \"\", founded on 1 September 1977.\nThe first Green Party to achieve national prominence was the German Green Party, famous for their opposition to nuclear power, as well as an expression of anti-centralist and pacifist values traditional to greens. They were founded in 1980 and have been in coalition governments at state level for some years. They were in federal government with the Social Democratic Party of Germany in a so-called Red-Green alliance from 1998 to 2005. In 2001, they reached an agreement to end reliance on nuclear power in Germany, and agreed to remain in coalition and support the government of Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der in the 2001 Afghan War. This put them at odds with many Greens worldwide.\nIn Finland, in 1995, the Finnish Green Party was the first European Green party to be part of a national Cabinet. Other Green parties that have participated in government at national level include the Groen! (formerly Agalev) and Ecolo in Belgium, The Greens in France and the Green Party in Ireland. In the Netherlands GroenLinks (\"GreenLeft\") was founded in 1990 from four small left-wing parties and is now a stable faction in the Dutch parliament. The Australian Greens supported a Labor minority government from 2010 to 2013, and have participated in several state governments.\nIn 2022 Denmark, the Green Party The Alternative has only one Parliament member, having dropped from the previous nine, and five local parliaments members. In 2022 Portugal, the Green Party People-Animals-Nature also has only one Parliament member, having dropped from the previous four, and another in the Madeira Regional Parliament, while its two other Green parties, Partido da Terra and Partido Ecologista \"Os Verdes\", only have, respectively, two councilpeople and one mayor.\nAround the world, individuals have formed many Green parties over the last thirty years. Green parties now exist in most countries with democratic systems, from Canada to Peru, from Norway to South Africa, from Ireland to Mongolia. There is Green representation at national, regional and local levels in many countries around the world.\nMost of the Green parties are formed to win elections, and so organize themselves by the presented electoral or political districts. But that does not apply universally: The Green Party of Alaska is organized along bioregional lines to practice bioregional democracy.\nSupport.\nAcademic research has uncovered striking international consistency in the typical demographic and attitudinal profile of Green party supporters. In particular, Green voters tend to be young, highly educated, disproportionately female, and employed in the social and cultural services (healthcare, teaching, the arts, etc.), whilst also displaying above-average levels of environmentalism and social liberalism, as well as being left-leaning. Additionally, Green parties also tend to attract greater levels of support in countries defined by high levels of economic development and low levels of unemployment, as well as the presence of tangible environmental disputes (such as nuclear power production) and active major party competition on the environmental issue. The former two factors are believed to generate cohorts of voters with enough material security to devote their attention to 'higher' goals such as environmentalism; the latter two help raise the profile of the Green's own policy positions and statements (providing that the major parties do not act so quickly to the rising salience of environmentalism as to usurp the issue entirely and completely preempt the development of a separate ecological party). Their supporters sometimes blame the economical system for the environmental issues neglecting any green free-market liberal capitalist alternatives.\nAlliances.\nDepending on local conditions or issues, platforms and alliances may vary. In line with the goal of democracy, neighboring ecoregions may require different policies or protections.\nGreen parties are often formed in a given jurisdiction by a coalition of scientific ecologists, community environmentalists, and local (or national) leftist groups or groups concerned with peace or citizens rights.\nA Red-Green alliance is an alliance between Green parties and social democratic parties. Such alliances are typically formed for the purpose of elections (mostly in first-past-the-post election systems), or, after elections, for the purpose of forming a government.\nSome Greens, such as those in Hawaii, find more effective alliances (Blue-Green alliance) or indigenous peoples \u2013 who seek to prevent disruption of traditional ways of life or to save ecological resources they depend on. Although Greens find much to support in fostering these types of alliances with groups of historically different backgrounds, they also feel strongly about forming diverse communities through encouragement of diversity in social and economic demographics in communities, \nAlliances often highlight strategic differences between participating in parties and advancing the values of the Green movement. For example, Greens became allied with centre-right parties to oust the centre-left ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party of Mexico. Ralph Nader, the 2000 presidential nominee of the U.S. Greens, campaigned with ultra-conservative Pat Buchanan on joint issues such as farm policy and bans on corporate funding of election campaigns, although this \"alliance\" between Nader and Buchanan was very specifically limited to the purpose of showing that there was broad support for certain specific issues, across the political spectrum.\nU.S. Greens grew dramatically throughout 2001. However, stable coalitions (such as that in Germany) tend to be formed between elections with left-wing parties on social issues, and 'the grassroots right' on such issues as irresponsible corporate subsidies and public ethics.\nOn 13 June 2007, the Irish Green Party, represented by six members of parliament or TDs, agreed to go into a coalition government for the first time in their history, with Fianna F\u00e1il and the Progressive Democrats (the Progressive Democrats later dissolved as a party, though their members remained in parliament). The Green Party held two Cabinet seats, as well as two junior ministries, until their withdrawal from government in January 2011. They lost all of their six seats in the following month's general election, but won two in the 2016 general election, and twelve seats in the 2020 general election, and entered government again in June 2020.\nIn the Czech Republic, the Green Party was part of the governing coalition, together with the conservative Civic Democratic Party (ODS) and the Christian Democrats (KDU\u2013\u010cSL) from January 2007 until the government collapsed in March 2009.\nGreen parties often have to join coalitions/alliances with other parties within parliament as they rarely get a large share of the vote (rarely polling above 10% at a national level). Their involvement in coalition governments is important in getting environmental issues on the political agenda, however they are often limited in the amount that they can succeed given they are not the majority within the alliance.\nGreen parties.\nAfrica.\nSome national Green parties began forming in Africa in the 1980s and 1990s, but they often struggled to gain influence.\nWangari Maathai was perhaps the most prominent and successful member of a Green party in Africa: after founding the Green Belt Movement and the Mazingira Green Party of Kenya, she was elected to the Kenyan Parliament in 2002, became an assistant minister for Environmental and Natural Resources, and won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2004. Other African Green parties that have achieved parliamentary representation include Les Verts Fraternels of Mauritius, and Frank Habineza's Democratic Green Party of Rwanda. In Senegal, Green party leader Ha\u00efdar el Ali was appointed Minister for Ecology in 2012.\nAsia and Oceania.\nAustralia, Fiji, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu.\nGreen parties have achieved national or state parliamentary representation in New Zealand, Australia and Vanuatu. In New Zealand the Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand currently holds 15 seats in the New Zealand House of Representatives after the 2023 general election. While the Australian Greens hold 10 seats in the Australian Senate and a single seat in the Australian House of Representatives following the 2025 Australian federal election. Since 2004, they have received more votes than any other third party in every federal election. They also have representation in the upper and lower houses of state parliaments of five states and in the unicameral chamber of one territory. Greens also hold representative positions in local government across New Zealand and Australia (where a number of local government authorities are controlled by Green councillors). The Greens took the seat of Melbourne from the centre-left Australian Labor Party (ALP) in 2010 with candidate Adam Bandt. This was the first time the Greens have won a Lower House seat at a general election (although they have previously won two seats at by-elections).\nProportional representation in the Australian Senate and in New Zealand has strengthened the position of the Australian Greens and the Green Party of New Zealand and enabled them to participate directly in legislatures and policy-making committees. In countries following British-style 'first past the post' electoral rules, Green parties face barriers to gaining federal or provincial/regional/state seats. The Australian Labor Party's practice of allocating a portion of ALP ticket votes to Australian Greens has helped bring AG candidates into parliament. During the 2025 election, How-to-vote cards from Labor tended to prefer the Greens over the centre-right Liberal-National Coalition during the 2025 election in the House of Representatives in 116 out of 150 seats.\nIn the 2008 ACT election in Australia, the Greens won 15.6% of the vote, winning 4 out of 17 seats. Shane Rattenbury was elected the speaker of the assembly, the first time a Green party member had held such a position in any parliament or assembly in Australia. However, they retained only one seat at the 2012 election in the same territory.\nThe Green Confederation (\"Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration Verte\") in Vanuatu won 3 out of 52 seats in the 2012 Vanuatuan general election in October 2012. Its most prominent member is Moana Carcasses Kalosil, who became prime minister in March 2013. Carcasses, a Green liberal, does not lead a Green government, but a broad coalition government in which he is the only Green minister.\nThere is a Papua New Guinea Greens Party, but it does not have any members in Parliament. There was briefly a Green Party in Fiji from 2008 to 2013; as Parliament was suspended by the military regime during this time, the party was not able to take part in any election before all parties were deregistered in 2013.\nLebanon.\nThe Green Party of Lebanon was founded in 2008 as a secular party. Its first president was Philippe Skaff, CEO of Grey Advertising. The party debuted with the May 2010 municipal elections. In 2011, the party became the first political party in Lebanon to elect a female leader when Nada Zaarour was elected its president.\nIsrael.\nMany attempts to establish a green party were made. For example, the Greens were established in 1997. In the 1999 Knesset elections the party received 0.4% of the vote, failing to win a seat. They received the same share of the vote in the 2003 elections.\nPakistan.\nThe Pakistan Green Party was founded in 2002.\nTaiwan.\nThe Green Party Taiwan was founded in 1996. It is a small party which have often associated with Democratic Progressive Party, a major political party in Taiwan.\nEurope.\nBelgian and German roots.\nThe first green parties in Europe were founded in the late 1970s, following the rise of environmental awareness and the development of new social movements. Green parties in Belgium first made a breakthrough. Belgium had Green members of parliament elected first in the 1970s, and with seats on the local council, held the balance of power in the city of Liege, so were the first to go into coalition with the ruling party on that council. In 1979 political campaigns and dissident groups feeling underrepresented in west German politics formed a coalition to contest the 1979 elections to the European Parliament.\nAlthough they did not win any seats, the groups in this association formally agreed to become a party and won a breakthrough in the German national elections of 1983. They were not the first Green Party in Europe to have members elected nationally but the impression was created that they had been, because they attracted the most media attention. This was partly due to their charismatic leader Petra Kelly, a German who was of interest to the American media because she had an American step-father. Since its foundation in 1980 and merger with Alliance 90 after the German reunification, Kelly's party, now named Alliance '90/The Greens, has become one of Europe's most important Green parties. It played an important role in the formation of national-level Green parties in other countries such as Spain as well. The forerunner of the Green Party in the United Kingdom was the PEOPLE Party, formed in Coventry in 1972. It changed its name to the Ecology Party in 1973 and the Green Party in 1985.\n1984\u20131989: A new political force.\nIn 1984 Greens agreed a common platform for the European Parliament Elections and the first Green Members of the European Parliament were elected then. Germany, a stronghold of the Green movement, elected seven MEPs; two more came from Belgium and two from the Netherlands. As those eleven MEPs did not entitle the Greens to form a parliamentary group on their own, they concluded an alliance with MEPs from Italy, Denmark, and regionalists from Flanders and Ireland to form the GRAEL (Green Alternative European Link) group, also known as the Rainbow Group. Politically they engaged in the fight against environmental pollution, nuclear energy (1986 saw the Chernobyl disaster), the promotion of animal protection and the campaign against the demolition of Brussels by speculation fuelled by the presence of the European institutions.\nSince the 1990s.\nAfter years of co-operation between the national Green parties, they formed a pan-European alliance that unites most European Green parties. The Greens are a party within the European parliament with 46 seats, as of June 2009. It has a long-standing alliance with the European Free Alliance (EFA), an alliance of \"stateless nations\", such as the Welsh nationalist Plaid Cymru and Scottish National Party. Together European Green Party/EFA have 58 seats and they are the fourth largest party in the European Parliament.\nWhile on many issues European Greens practice the same policies, one issue divides European Green parties: the European Union. Some Green parties, like the Dutch GreenLeft, the Green Party of England and Wales, the Swiss Green Party, the Irish Green Party and the German Alliance '90/The Greens, are pro-European while some, like the Green party in Sweden, are moderately eurosceptic.\nSome Green parties have been part of governing coalitions. The first one was the Finnish Green League that entered government in 1995. The Italian Federation of the Greens, the French Greens, the German Alliance '90/The Greens and both Belgian Green parties, the French-speaking Ecolo and the Dutch-speaking Agalev were part of government during the late 1990s. Most successful was the Latvian Green Party, who supplied the Prime Minister of Latvia in 2004. The Swedish Green Party was a long-term supporter of the social-democratic minority government until the election 2006 when the social-democratic party lost. The Irish Green Party is currently in government, having entered a coalition with Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael in June 2020, with three cabinet positions. It was previously in a coalition government with Fianna F\u00e1il from 2007 until January 2011 when the party withdrew their support for the ruling coalition.\nIn Scandinavia, left-wing socialist parties have formed the Nordic Green Left Alliance. These parties have the same ideals as European Greens. However, they do not cooperate with the Global Greens or European Greens, but instead form a combined parliamentary group with the Party of the European Left, which unites communists and post-communists. There is one exception, in 2004 the MEP for Danish Socialist People's Party has left the Nordic Green Left parliamentary group and has joined the Green parliamentary group in the European parliament. The Socialist People's Party is currently an observer at the European Green Party and the Global Greens. Outside of Scandinavia, in 2004, Latvia became the first country in the world to have a Green politician become Head of Government, but in 2006 the Green Party received only 16.71 percent of the vote. In the Estonia 2007 parliamentary elections, the Estonian Greens won 7.1 percent of the vote, and a mandate for six seats in the country's parliament, the Riigikogu. Other significant electoral results for European green parties include Germany's Alliance '90/The Greens in the 2002 federal election and France's Europe Ecology \u2013 The Greens in the 2012 legislative election, in which they both won more seats than any other third party.\nIn some countries Greens have found it difficult to win any representation in the national parliament. Three reasons can be found for this. It includes countries with a first past the post electoral system, such as the United Kingdom. However, despite the first past the post system in the United Kingdom, the Green Party of England and Wales won their first seat in the House of Commons when Caroline Lucas won the seat of Brighton Pavilion in 2010. In July 2024, after a targeted campaign, 4 Green MPs were elected in Bristol Central, Waveney Valley, North Herefordshire and Brighton Pavilion. The Scottish Greens have had success in the devolved Scottish Parliament previously signing a (now ended) deal to enter a governing coalition, whilst the Green Party Northern Ireland has had success in the devolved Northern Ireland Assembly and local elections where the first-past-the-post system is not used. In countries where a party with similar ideals is stronger, such as Norway and Denmark, Green parties tend to perform worse. In some Eastern European countries, like Romania, Green parties are still in the process of formation and have therefore not gained enough support. In Poland the Green Party, registered in 2004, won their first three seats in the Sejm in 2019. The Green Party of Bulgaria was founded in Sofia in 1989 by Aleksandar Karakachanov. Green Movement (ZD) was a member of an anti-corruption coalition - Democratic Bulgaria (DB). Ecoglasnost is a member of the BSP for Bulgaria coalition. For the elections in 2022, the Party of the Greens (\u041f\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435, \u041f\u043d\u0417, PnZ) joined the Bulgarian Rise coalition.\nThe European Green Party has worked to support weak Green parties in European countries. Until recently, they were giving support to Green parties in the Mediterranean countries. These Green parties are now making electoral gains, e.g. in Spain, Greece and Republic of Cyprus, or getting organized to do so, e.g. in Malta. Therefore, the EGP is now turning its attention to Eastern Europe \u2013 all these countries have Green parties, but in materially poor Eastern Europe the success of Green Parties is patchy except for Hungary, where the local Green party, Politics Can Be Different (LMP), has been elected to parliament and many city councils.\nIn 2021 Croatian local elections We can! party became the largest political party in the Zagreb Assembly, winning 23 seats in total. Their mayoral candidate Tomislav Toma\u0161evi\u0107 won a landslide victory on 31 May.\nGermany.\nAs mentioned above, the German green party holds strong influence in terms of green politics in Europe. The German green party: Alliance 90/The Greens (B\u00fcndnis 90/Die Gr\u00fcnen) was founded in 1993 after the West German green party (Die Gr\u00fcnen, formed in 1980) and the East German green party (B\u00fcndnis 90, formed in 1990) joined after the reunification of Germany.\nin 1998, Alliance 90/The Greens joined a coalition government with the SPD, forming a Red-Green alliance that would last until 2005. In order to agree to the coalition, Alliance 90/The Greens had 3 priorities: to reduce unemployment, close nuclear-power stations/Germany to not rely on nuclear power, and for citizenship laws to be reformed. The coalition remained in place following the 2002 election. However, green policies were no longer considered to be a focal point so much, with unemployment growing and other economic issues being more pressing, leading to the rise of the CDU/CSU, and the eventual loss of a majority in parliament.\nTurkey.\nGreens and the Left Party of the Future is a left-libertarian and green party in Turkey. It was founded on 25 November 2012 as a merger of the Greens Party and the Equality and Democracy Party.\nProminent members include Murat Belge, left-liberal political author and columnist for \"Taraf\"; Kutlu\u011f Ataman, filmmaker and contemporary artist; and Ufuk Uras, former Istanbul deputy and president of the Freedom and Solidarity Party.\nThe party is one of the participants in the Peoples' Democratic Congress, a political initiative instrumental in founding the Peoples' Democratic Party in 2012.\nThe Greens, along with feminists, left YSGP en masse in 2016, citing its lack of democratic decision making practices. They and a new generation of activists reestablished the Green Party (Ye\u015filler) in 2020.\nNorth America.\nAs of the 41st general election in Canada, held on May 2, 2011, there was only one federally elected member of the Green Party of Canada in the House of Commons of Canada, its leader Elizabeth May. However, at the dissolution of the 41st Parliament on August 2, 2015, the Green Party of Canada held two seats in the House of Commons, the second seat belonging to formerly Independent MP Bruce Hyer who was elected to the House of Commons as a member of the NDP in 2011. Only May won re-election to the 42nd parliament. Mike Morrice was elected to the 43rd parliament, returning Greens to two seats. There remains no federal representation by the Green Party of the United States in the U.S. Congress. Accordingly, in these countries, Green parties focus on electoral reform. In Mexico, however, the \"Partido Verde Ecologista,\" often abbreviated as PVEM, has 17 deputies and four senators in Congress as a result of the 2006 elections. Nevertheless, some of its political practices such as plead in favor of the death penalty in Mexico, led to the European Green Party's withdrawal of recognition of the PVEM as a legitimate green party.\nCanada.\nThe first Green parties in Canada (both federal and provincial) were founded in 1983. The strongest provincial Green parties are the Green Party of British Columbia, the Green Party of Ontario, the Green Party of New Brunswick, and the Green Party of Prince Edward Island which was elected the Official Opposition in the 2019 election. The first ever BC Green MLA was elected in 2013, and in 2017 they helped the minority NDP form government. In 2014 a Green MLA was elected to the New Brunswick legislature, in 2015 a Green MLA was elected to the Prince Edward Island Legislature, and in 2018 Mike Schreiner became the first Green MPP elected to the Ontario provincial legislature. Federally, the Green Party of Canada received 6.49% of the popular vote and a record three seats in Parliament during the 2019 federal election, breaking ground in Atlantic Canada with the election of Jenica Atwin as the first federal Green from outside of British Columbia. This is up from one seat (later two) and 3.91% won in the 2015 federal election. Although Elizabeth May (the leader of the GPC from 2006 to 2019) was the first elected Member of Parliament, the first seat was gained in the House of Commons on August 30, 2008, when sitting Independent MP Blair Wilson joined the party. As of September 2020, May continues to sit as a Member of Parliament for Saanich-Gulf Islands and has exerted a considerable amount of legislative influence on a number of issues ranging from denying unanimous consent for military intervention in Libya, playing a central role in exposing changes to environmental legislation hidden in the omnibus Budget Bill C-38, to introducing a private member's bill to develop a national strategy on Lyme disease. Mike Morrice joined May in Parliament in 2021 representing Kitchener Centre and has been active on disability issues.\nIn the 2008 Vancouver municipal election, Stuart Mackinnon, a member of the Vancouver Green Party, was elected to the Vancouver Parks Board. Since that time former Green Party of British Columbia leader, and deputy-leader of the federal Green party, Adriane Carr won the Greens' first seat on Vancouver City Council, in 2011 municipal elections.\nUnited States.\nIn the United States, Greens first ran for public office in 1985. Since then, the Green Party of the United States has claimed electoral victories at the municipal, county and state levels. The first U.S. Greens to be elected were David Conley and Frank Koehn in Wisconsin 1986. Each was elected to a position on the County Board of Supervisors in Douglas and Bayfield counties respectively. Keiko Bonk was first elected in 1992 in Hawaii County, becoming Official Chairwoman in 1995. The first Green Party mayor was Kelly Weaverling, elected in Cordova, AK in 1991.\nAs of April 2018, 156 Greens held elective office across the US in 19 states. The states with the largest numbers of Green elected officials are California (68), Connecticut (15), and Pennsylvania (15). Titles of offices held include: Alderman, Auditor, Board of Appeals, Board of Finance, Board of Selectmen, Borough Council, Budget Committee, Circuit Court Judge, City Council, Common Council, Community College District Board of Trustees, Community Service Board, Conservation Congress, Constable, County Board of Supervisors, County Supervisor, Fire Commission, Fire District Board, Inspector of Elections, Judge of Elections, Mayor, Neighborhood Council Board, Park District, Parks and Recreation District Board, Library Board, Planning Board, Public Housing Authority Resident Advisory Board, Public Service District, Rent Stabilization Board, Sanitary District Board, School Board, Soil and Water Conservation Board, State Representative, Town Council, Transit District Board, Village Trustee, Water District Board, and Zoning Board of Appeals. As of October 2016, 100 Greens held elected office across the US. The first US Green elected to a state legislature was Audie Bock in 1999, to the California State Assembly, followed by John Eder to the Maine House of Representatives in 2002 and 2004 and Richard Carroll to the Arkansas House of Representatives in 2008. While in office in 2003 in the New Jersey General Assembly, incumbent Matt Ahearn made a party switch to Green for the remainder of his term.\nThe Green Party has contested seven presidential elections: in 1996 and 2000 with Ralph Nader for president and Winona LaDuke as vice president, in 2004 with David Cobb for president and Pat LaMarche for vice president, and in 2008 with Cynthia McKinney for president and Rosa Clemente for vice president. In 2000, Nader received more votes for president than any Green Party candidate before or since. Jill Stein ran for president on the Green ticket in 2012, 2016 and 2024; the vice-presidential candidates were Cheri Honkala in 2012, Ajamu Baraka in 2016 and Butch Ware in 2024. Stein, who received over one million votes in the 2016 race, led unsuccessful attempts toward 2016 election recounts in three states: Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. In 2020, Howie Hawkins, a founder of the Green Party, was the party's presidential nominee.\nSouth America.\nBrazil.\nThe Brazilian Green Party was constituted after the military dictatorship period and, like other Green Parties around the world, is committed to establishing a set of policies on ensuring social-equity and sustainable development. One of the party's founding members was the journalist and former anti-dictatorship revolutionary Fernando Gabeira, Alfredo Sirkis and Carlos Minc. Among the main items on the Green Party's agenda are federalism, environmentalism, human rights, a form of direct democracy, parliamentarism, welfare, civil liberties, pacifism and marijuana legalization under specific conditions.\nGreen Party's candidate Marina Silva won 19.33% of the vote in the first round of the 2010 Brazilian presidential election (more than any other third party), taking enough votes from Dilma Rousseff of the incumbent PT to prevent her from achieving the majority of the vote needed to avoid a second round. Success in the legislature amounted to winning 2 more seats for a total of 15 in the Chamber of Deputies and the loss of their only senate seat.\nMarina Silva left the party the following year.\nIn the 2014 presidential election the Green Party's candidate Eduardo Jorge received 0,61% of the vote. He garnered attention for campaigning on a progressive platform supporting policies such as cannabis legalization and the decriminalization of abortion. Because of his perceived eccentricity and spontaneity while participating in the televised debates, Jorge became the subject of several memes on the internet. The party elected 6 federal deputies and 1 senator.\nIn 2016, the Greens in Congress voted in favour of the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff. The party later went on to support president Michel Temer who succeeded her.\nFor the 2018 presidential election the party formed the coalition \"United to transform Brazil\" with the Sustainability Network (REDE), in support of the candidacy of Marina Silva in her third run for the presidency. Eduardo Jorge was chosen as her running mate. Despite faring well in the initial polls, Silva ultimately received 1% of the vote. The party elected 4 federal deputies.\nColombia.\nIn the 1990s, the Oxygen Green Party was created under the leadership of Ingrid Betancourt but dissolved after her infamous kidnapping. Later, the Visionaries Party was created by Antanas Mockus whose ideals earned him the Bogot\u00e1 Mayoral Office twice.\nIn the 2010 Colombian presidential election a green party has been created under the name Colombian Green Party, with former Bogot\u00e1 mayor Antanas Mockus being the leader.\nGreen parties in government.\nWhile most green parties remain minor parties, some have entered into national coalition governments. The following table lists green parties that have entered into government at the national level. It does not include the green conservative parties of Latvia and Lithuania. It also excludes parties that were elected into government as a minor partner in an electoral alliance, such as the Italian Federation of the Greens which governed as a small part of the Olive Tree and Union alliances.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was suggested to Bertrand Russell as an illustration of the paradox, but he deemed it an invalid modification of his paradox. The puzzle shows that an apparently plausible scenario is logically impossible. Specifically, it describes a barber who is defined such that he both shaves himself and does not shave himself, which implies that no such barber exists.\nParadox.\nThe barber is the \"one who shaves all those, and those only, who do not shave themselves\". The question is, does the barber shave himself?\nAny answer to this question results in a contradiction:\nIn its original form, this paradox has no solution, as no such barber can exist. The question is a loaded question in that it assumes the existence of a barber who could not exist, which is a vacuous proposition, and hence false. There are other non-paradoxical variations, but those are different.\nHistory.\nThis paradox is often incorrectly attributed to Bertrand Russell (e.g., by Martin Gardner in \"Aha!\"). It was suggested to Russell as an alternative form of Russell's paradox, which Russell had devised to show that set theory as it was used by Georg Cantor and Gottlob Frege contained contradictions. However, Russell denied that the Barber's paradox was an instance of his own:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;That contradiction [Russell's paradox] is extremely interesting. You can modify its form; some forms of modification are valid and some are not. I once had a form suggested to me which was not valid, namely the question whether the barber shaves himself or not. You can define the barber as \"one who shaves all those, and those only, who do not shave themselves\". The question is, does the barber shave himself? In this form the contradiction is not very difficult to solve. But in our previous form I think it is clear that you can only get around it by observing that the whole question whether a class is or is not a member of itself is nonsense, i.e. that no class either is or is not a member of itself, and that it is not even true to say that, because the whole form of words is just noise without meaning.\u2014\u200a\nThis point is elaborated further under Applied versions of Russell's paradox.\n formula_1\nIn first-order logic.\nThis sentence says that a barber x exists. Its truth value is false, as the existential clause is unsatisfiable (a contradiction) because of the universal quantifier formula_2. The universally quantified y will include every single element in the domain, including our infamous barber x. So when the value x is assigned to y, the sentence in the universal quantifier can be rewritten to formula_3, which is an instance of the contradiction formula_4. Since the sentence is false for the biconditional, the entire universal clause is false. Since the existential clause is a conjunction with one operand that is false, the entire sentence is false. Another way to show this is to negate the entire sentence and arrive at a tautology. Nobody is such a barber, so there is no solution to the paradox.\n formula_5\n formula_6\n formula_7"}

{"id": "46105", "revid": "19404073", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46105", "title": "Indigo children", "text": "Children who are believed to possess special traits or abilities\nIndigo children, according to a pseudoscientific New Age concept, are children who are believed to possess special, unusual, and sometimes supernatural traits or abilities. The idea is based on concepts developed in the 1970s by Nancy Ann Tappe, who wrote that she had been noticing indigo children beginning in the late 1960s. Her ideas were further developed by Lee Carroll and Jan Tober. The concept of indigo children gained popular interest with the publication of a series of books in the late 1990s and the release of several films in the following decade. A variety of books, conferences, and related materials have been created surrounding belief in the idea of indigo children and their nature and abilities. The interpretations of these beliefs range from their being the next stage in human evolution to the belief that they are more empathetic and creative than their peers.\nNo scientific studies give credibility to the existence of indigo children or their traits. Some parents choose to label their children who have been diagnosed with learning disabilities as an indigo child to alternatively diagnose them. Critics view this as a way for parents to avoid considering pediatric treatment or a psychiatric diagnosis. Some lists of traits used to describe indigo children have also been criticized for being vague enough to be applied to most people, a form of the Forer effect.\nOrigins.\nThe term \"indigo children\" originated with parapsychologist and self-described synesthete and psychic Nancy Ann Tappe, who developed the concept in the 1970s. In 1982 Tappe published a comb-bound version which she expanded and republished in paperback in 1986 as \"Understanding Your Life Thru Color\". In these works Tappe introduced the concept of \"life colors\", defined in \"Understanding Your Life Thru Color\" as \"the single color of the aura that remains constant in most people from the cradle to the grave\". The concept of \"life colors\" was popularized nationally by Tappe's student Barbara Bowers, who published \"What Color Is Your Aura?: Personality Spectrums for Understanding and Growth\" in 1989, and by Bowers' student Pamala Oslie, who published \"Life Colors: What the Colors in Your Aura Reveal\" in 1991.\nTappe stated that during the late 1960s and early 1970s she began noticing that many children were being born with indigo auras (or, in her terminology, with indigo as their \"life color\"). The idea was later popularized by the 1998 book \"The Indigo Children: The New Kids Have Arrived\", written by husband and wife self-help lecturers Lee Carroll and Jan Tober.\nIn 2002, the first international conference on indigo children was held in Hawaii, drawing 600 attendees, and there have been subsequent conferences in Florida, Oregon, and elsewhere. Several films have been produced on the subject, including two films by New Age writer James Twyman: a 2003 feature film \"Indigo\" and a 2006 documentary \"The Indigo Evolution\".\nSarah W. Whedon suggests in a 2009 article in \"Nova Religio\" that the social construction of indigo children is a response to an \"apparent crisis of American childhood\" in the form of increased youth violence and diagnoses of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Whedon believes parents label their children as \"indigo\" to provide an alternative explanation for their children's improper behavior, which is stemming from ADHD.\nAttributed characteristics.\nDescriptions of indigo children include that they:\nOther attributed traits include:\nAccording to Tober and Carroll, indigo children may function poorly in conventional schools due to their rejection of rigid authority, their being smarter or more spiritually mature than their teachers, and their lack of response to guilt-, fear- or manipulation-based discipline.\nAccording to research psychologist Russell Barkley, the New Age movement has yet to produce empirical evidence of the existence of indigo children, as the traits most commonly attributed to them are closely aligned with the Forer effect\u2014so vague that they could describe nearly anyone. Many critics see the concept of indigo children as made up of extremely general traits, a sham diagnosis that is an alternative to a medical diagnosis, with a complete lack of science or studies to support it.\nIndigo as an alternative to diagnosis.\nRetired professor of philosophy and skeptic Robert Todd Carroll notes that many of the commentators on the indigo phenomenon are of varying qualifications and expertise, and parents may prefer labeling their child an indigo as an alternative to a diagnosis that implies poor parenting, narcissistic parenting, damage, or mental illness. This is a belief echoed by academic psychologists. Some mental health experts are concerned that labeling a disruptive child an \"indigo\" may delay proper diagnosis and treatment that could help the child or look into the parenting style that may be causing the behavior. Others have stated that many of the traits of indigo children could be more prosaically interpreted as simple unruliness and alertness.\nRelationship to attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.\nMany children labeled indigo by their parents are diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and Tober and Carroll's book \"The Indigo Children\" linked the concept with diagnosis of ADHD. David Cohen points out that labeling a child an indigo is an alternative to a diagnosis that implies mental illness, which may appeal to many parents. Cohen has stated, \"The view in medicine is that ADHD is a defect. It's a disorder. If you're a parent, the idea of 'gifted' is much more appealing than the idea of a disorder.\" Linking the concept of indigo children with the distaste for the use of Ritalin to control ADHD, Robert Todd Carroll states \"The hype and near-hysteria surrounding the use of Ritalin has contributed to an atmosphere that makes it possible for a book like \"Indigo Children\" to be taken seriously. Given the choice, who wouldn't rather believe their children are special and chosen for some high mission rather than that they have a brain disorder?\" Stephen Hinshaw, a professor of psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, states that concerns regarding the overmedicalization of children are legitimate but even gifted children with ADHD learn better with more structure rather than less, even if the structure initially causes difficulties. Many labeled as indigo children are or have been home schooled. Many children labeled as indigo children have the same identifying criteria as those children who have experienced being raised by a narcissistic parent, and are considered to have been emotionally abused.\nA 2011 study suggested parents of children with ADHD who label their children as \"indigos\" may perceive problematic behaviors emblematic of ADHD to be more positive and experience less frustration and disappointment, though they still experience more negative emotions and conflicts than parents of children without a diagnosis.\nRelation to autism.\nCrystal children, a concept related to indigo children, has been linked to the autism spectrum. Proponents recategorize autistic symptoms as telepathic powers, and attempt to reconceptualize \u201cthe autistic traits associated with them as part of a positive identity\". Autism researcher Mitzi Waltz states that there may be inherent dangers to these beliefs, leading parents to deny the existence of impairments, avoid proven treatments and spend considerable money on unhelpful interventions. Waltz states that \"Parents may also transmit belief systems to the child that are self-aggrandizing, confusing, or potentially frightening\".\nCommercialization.\nThe concept of indigo children has been criticized for being less about children and their needs, and more about the profits to be made by self-styled experts in book and video sales as well as lucrative counseling sessions, summer camps, conferences and speaking engagements.\nDiscussion as a new religious movement.\nNancy Ann Tappe originally noted that one type of Indigo child (the \"interdimensional child\"), despite being seen as a bully, was expected to lead new religious movements.\nOne pagan author, Lorna Tedder, anecdotally notes that every pagan woman she knew who had or was going to have a child believed their child was an Indigo child.\nS. Zohreh Kermani states that \"Despite their problems with authority, uncontrollable tempers, and overbearing egos, Indigo Children are many pagan parents' ideal offspring: sensitive, psychic, and strong willed\", but also notes the concept is less about the child's psychic abilities than the parent's own hopes and desire for \"distinction from the less-evolved masses.\"\nDaniel Kline, in an essay titled \"The New Kids: Indigo Children and New Age Discourse\", notes that the magical belief that the innocence of children equates to spiritual powers has existed for centuries, and that the indigo child movement is rooted in a religious rejection of science-based medicine. In particular, he wrote that Nancy Ann Tappe derived some of her ideas from Charles Webster Leadbeater (her main innovation being emphasizing the connection between children and the color indigo), and that the New Age adoption of the concept is a reaction against diagnoses of ADHD and autism. Kline also discusses how Carroll and Tober have tried to distance themselves from religious beliefs about indigo children in order to maintain control of the concept (even recanting their previous affirmations about auras), and how skeptics and New Agers alike both make rhetorical appeals to science (despite the latter's rejection of it) to legitimize their ideological beliefs regarding the existence of indigo children.\nAt the 2014 University of Cambridge Festival of Ideas, anthropologist Beth Singler discussed how the term indigo children functioned as a new religious movement, along with Jediism. Singler's work focuses on the Indigo movement as a part of an overall discussion on \"wider moral panicsaround children, parenting, the diagnosis of conditions such as ADHD and autism and conspiracy theories about Big Pharma and vaccinations.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The World Health Organization (WHO) defines violence as \"the intentional use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, against oneself, another person, or against a group or community, which either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, maldevelopment, or deprivation\"; it recognizes the need to include violence not resulting in injury or death.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCategories.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) divides violence into three broad categories: self-directed, interpersonal, and collective. This categorization differentiates between violence inflicted to and by oneself, by another individual or a small group, and by larger groups such as states. Alternatively, violence can primarily be classified as either instrumental or hostile.\nSelf-inflicted.\nSelf-inflicted violence comes in two forms. The first is suicidal behaviour, which includes suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts. The second is self-harm, which includes acts such as self-mutilation.\nCollective.\nAccording to WHO, \"collective violence\" refers to \"the instrumental use of violence by people who identify themselves as members of a group \u2013 whether this group is transitory or has a more permanent identity \u2013 against another group or set of individuals in order\nto achieve political, economic or social objectives\".82 Collective violence may be \"targeted\" or stochastic.\nPolitical violence includes conflicts led by communities, by states, and by other kinds of groups. The most extreme form of collective violence is when conflicts are prolonged, large-scale, and political: war. Explaining wars requires multi-factorial analysis.\nEconomic violence includes attacks motivated by economic gain\u2014such as attacks carried out with the purpose of disrupting economic activity, denying access to essential services, or creating economic division and fragmentation.\nSlow violence is often invisible, gradual, and structural; it obtains through degradation, attrition, and pollution.\nStructural violence is a form of violence wherein some social structure or social institution may harm people by preventing them from meeting their basic needs or rights.\nInterpersonal.\nInterpersonal violence can be subdivided in many ways: types of abuse (physical, emotional, etc); locations where it occurs (home, work, etc); age disparity between the persons in the relationship (child, elder). It can affect the victims' other relationships in the short- and long-terms.\nLocation.\nIntimate partner violence (or domestic violence) involves physical, sexual and emotional violence by an intimate partner or ex-partner. Although males can also be victims, intimate partner violence disproportionately affects females. It commonly occurs against girls within child marriages and early/forced marriages. Among romantically involved but unmarried adolescents it is sometimes called \"dating violence\".\nA recent theory named \"The Criminal Spin\" suggests a mutual flywheel effect between partners that is manifested by an escalation in the violence. A violent spin may occur in any other forms of violence, but in Intimate partner violence the added value is the mutual spin, based on the unique situation and characteristics of intimate relationship.\nThe primary prevention strategy with the best evidence for effectiveness for intimate partner violence is school-based programming for adolescents to prevent violence within dating relationships. Evidence is emerging for the effectiveness of several other primary prevention strategies\u2014those that: combine microfinance with gender equality training; promote communication and relationship skills within communities; reduce access to, and the harmful use of alcohol; and change cultural gender norms.\nAge disparity.\nViolence against children includes all forms of violence against people under 18 years old, whether perpetrated by parents or other caregivers, peers, romantic partners, or strangers. Maltreatment (including violent punishment) involves physical, sexual and psychological/emotional violence; and neglect of infants, children and adolescents by parents, caregivers and other authority figures, most often in the home but also in settings such as schools and orphanages. It includes all types of physical and/or emotional ill-treatment, sexual abuse, neglect, negligence and commercial or other child exploitation, which results in actual or potential harm to the child's health, survival, development or dignity in the context of a relationship of responsibility, trust, or power. Exposure to intimate partner violence is also sometimes included as a form of child maltreatment.\nThere are no reliable global estimates for the prevalence of child maltreatment. Data for many countries, especially low- and middle-income countries, are lacking. Current estimates vary widely depending on the country and the method of research used. Approximately 20% of women and 5\u201310% of men report being sexually abused as children, while 25\u201350% of all children report being physically abused. Exposure to any form of trauma, particularly in childhood, can increase the risk of mental illness and suicide; smoking, alcohol and substance abuse; chronic diseases like heart disease, diabetes and cancer; and social problems such as poverty, crime and violence. Child maltreatment is a global problem with serious lifelong consequences. It is complex and difficult to study. Consequences of child maltreatment include impaired lifelong physical and mental health, and social and occupational functioning (e.g. school, job, and relationship difficulties). These can ultimately slow a country's economic and social development. Preventing child maltreatment before it starts is possible and requires a multisectoral approach. Effective prevention programmes support parents and teach positive parenting skills. Ongoing care of children and families can reduce the risk of maltreatment reoccurring and can minimize its consequences.\nElder maltreatment is a single or repeated act, or lack of appropriate action, occurring within any relationship where there is an expectation of trust which causes harm or distress to an older person. While there is little information regarding the extent of maltreatment in elderly populations, especially in developing countries, it is estimated that 4\u20136% of elderly people in high-income countries have experienced some form of maltreatment at home However, older people are often afraid to report cases of maltreatment to family, friends, or to the authorities. Data on the extent of the problem in institutions such as hospitals, nursing homes and other long-term care facilities are scarce. Elder maltreatment can lead to serious physical injuries and long-term psychological consequences. Elder maltreatment is predicted to increase as many countries are experiencing rapidly ageing populations.\nTypes of abuse.\nPsychological (or emotional) violence includes restricting a person's movements, denigration, ridicule, threats and intimidation, discrimination, rejection and other non-physical forms of hostile treatment.\nSexual violence is any sexual act, attempt to obtain a sexual act, unwanted sexual comments or advances, or acts to traffic, or otherwise directed against a person's sexuality using coercion, by any person regardless of their relationship to the victim, in any setting. It includes rape, defined as the physically forced or otherwise coerced penetration of the vulva or anus with a penis, other body part or object.\nAn anthropological concept,\"everyday violence\" may refer to the incorporation of different forms of violence (mainly political violence) into daily practices.\nSexual violence has serious short- and long-term consequences on physical, mental, sexual and reproductive health for victims and for their children as described in the section on intimate partner violence. If perpetrated during childhood, sexual violence can lead to increased smoking, drug and alcohol misuse, and risky sexual behaviors in later life. It is also associated with perpetration of violence and being a victim of violence.\nMany of the risk factors for sexual violence are the same as for domestic violence. Risk factors specific to sexual violence perpetration include beliefs in family honor and sexual purity, ideologies of male sexual entitlement and weak legal sanctions for sexual violence.\nFew interventions to prevent sexual violence have been demonstrated to be effective. School-based programmes to prevent child sexual abuse by teaching children to recognize and avoid potentially sexually abusive situations are run in many parts of the world and appear promising, but require further research. To achieve lasting change, it is important to enact legislation and develop policies that protect women; address discrimination against women and promote gender equality; and help to move the culture away from violence.\nImpact.\nThe Institute for Economics and Peace, estimated that the economic impact of violence and conflict on the global economy, the total economic impact of violence on the world economy in 2024 was estimated to be $17.5 trillion.\nThe incidence of violence can lead to adverse health effects. Mental health issues include depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, and suicide. Physical health issues include cardiovascular diseases and premature mortality. Health effects can be cumulative.\nIntimate partner and sexual violence have serious short- and long-term physical, mental, sexual and reproductive health problems for victims and for their children, and lead to high social and economic costs. These include both fatal and non-fatal injuries, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, unintended pregnancies, sexually transmitted infections, including HIV.\nPrevalence.\nInjuries and violence are a significant cause of death and burden of disease in all countries; however, they are not evenly distributed across or within countries. Violence-related injuries kill 1.25 million people every year, as of 2024. This is relatively similar to 2014 (1.3 million people or 2.5% of global mortality), 2013 (1.28 million people) and 1990 (1.13 million people).2 For people aged 15\u201344 years, violence is the fourth leading cause of death worldwide, as of 2014.2 Between 1990 and 2013, age-standardised death rates fell for self-harm and interpersonal violence.139 Of the deaths in 2013, roughly 842,000 were attributed to suicide, 405,000 to interpersonal violence, and 31,000 to collective violence and legal intervention. For each single death due to violence, there are dozens of hospitalizations, hundreds of emergency department visits, and thousands of doctors' appointments. Furthermore, violence often has lifelong consequences for physical and mental health and social functioning and can slow economic and social development. It's particularly the case if it happened in childhood.\nIn 2013, of the estimated 405,000 deaths due to interpersonal violence globally, assault by firearm was the cause in 180,000 deaths, assault by sharp object was the cause in 114,000 deaths, and the remaining 110,000 deaths from other causes.\nAs of 2010, all forms of violence resulted in about 1.34 million deaths up from about 1 million in 1990. Suicide accounts for about 883,000, interpersonal violence for 456,000 and collective violence for 18,000. Deaths due to collective violence have decreased from 64,000 in 1990.\nBy way of comparison, the 1.5 millions deaths a year due to violence is greater than the number of deaths due to tuberculosis (1.34 million), road traffic injuries (1.21 million), and malaria (830'000), but slightly less than the number of people who die from HIV/AIDS (1.77 million).\nFor every death due to violence, there are numerous nonfatal injuries. In 2008, over 16 million cases of non-fatal violence-related injuries were severe enough to require medical attention. Beyond deaths and injuries, forms of violence such as child maltreatment, intimate partner violence, and elder maltreatment have been found to be highly prevalent.\nIn the last 45 years, suicide rates have increased by 60% worldwide. Suicide is among the three leading causes of death among those aged 15\u201344 years in some countries, and the second leading cause of death in the 10\u201324 years age group. These figures do not include suicide attempts which are up to 20 times more frequent than suicide. Suicide was the 16th leading cause of death worldwide in 2004 and is projected to increase to the 12th in 2030. Although suicide rates have traditionally been highest among the male elderly, rates among young people have been increasing to such an extent that they are now the group at highest risk in a third of countries, in both developed and developing countries.\nRates and patterns of violent death vary by country and region. In recent years, homicide rates have been highest in developing countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean and lowest in East Asia, the western Pacific, and some countries in northern Africa. Studies show a strong, inverse relationship between homicide rates and both economic development and economic equality. Poorer countries, especially those with large gaps between the rich and the poor, tend to have higher rates of homicide than wealthier countries. Homicide rates differ markedly by age and sex. Gender differences are least marked for children. For the 15 to 29 age group, male rates were nearly six times those for female rates; for the remaining age groups, male rates were from two to four times those for females.\nStudies in a number of countries show that, for every homicide among young people age 10 to 24, 20 to 40 other young people receive hospital treatment for a violent injury.\nForms of violence such as child maltreatment and intimate partner violence are highly prevalent. Approximately 20% of women and 5\u201310% of men report being sexually abused as children, while 25\u201350% of all children report being physically abused. A WHO multi-country study found that between 15 and 71% of women reported experiencing physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate partner at some point in their lives.\nWars grab headlines, but the individual risk of dying violently in an armed conflict is today relatively low\u2014much lower than the risk of violent death in many countries that are not suffering from an armed conflict. For example, between 1976 and 2008, African Americans were victims of 329,825 homicides. Although there is a widespread perception that war is the most dangerous form of armed violence in the world, the average person living in a conflict-affected country had a risk of dying violently in the conflict of about 2.0 per 100,000 population between 2004 and 2007. This can be compared to the average world homicide rate of 7.6 per 100,000 people. This illustration highlights the value of accounting for all forms of armed violence rather than an exclusive focus on conflict related violence. Certainly, there are huge variations in the risk of dying from armed conflict at the national and subnational level, and the risk of dying violently in a conflict in specific countries remains extremely high. In Iraq, for example, the direct conflict death rate for 2004\u201307 was 65 per 100,000 people per year and, in Somalia, 24 per 100,000 people. This rate even reached peaks of 91 per 100,000 in Iraq in 2006 and 74 per 100,000 in Somalia in 2007.\nPopulation-level surveys based on reports from victims estimate that between 0.3 and 11.5% of women reported experiencing sexual violence.\nFactors.\nViolence can be attributed to protective and risk factors. The social ecological model divides factors into four levels: individual, relational, communal, and social.\nIndividual.\nIndividual risk factors include poor behavioral control, high emotional stress, low IQ, and antisocial beliefs or attitudes. Individual protective factors include an intolerance towards deviance, higher IQ and GPA, elevated popularity and social skills, as well as religious beliefs. Family protective factors include a connectedness and ability to discuss issues with family members or adults, parent/family use of constructive coping strategies, and consistent parental presence during at least one of the following: when awakening, when arriving home from school, at dinner time, or when going to bed. Social protective factors include quality school relationships, close relationships with non-deviant peers, involvement in prosocial activities, and exposure to school climates that are: well supervised, use clear behavior rules and disciplinary approaches, and engage parents with teachers.\nRelational.\nRelational risk factors include authoritarian childrearing attitudes, inconsistent disciplinary practices, low emotional attachment to parents or caregivers, and low parental income and involvement. A number of longitudinal studies suggest that the experience of physical punishment has a direct causal effect on later aggressive behaviors. Cross-cultural studies have shown that greater prevalence of corporal punishment of children tends to predict higher levels of violence in societies. For instance, a 2005 analysis of 186 pre-industrial societies found that corporal punishment was more prevalent in societies which also had higher rates of homicide, assault, and war. In the United States, domestic corporal punishment has been linked to later violent acts against family members and spouses. The American family violence researcher Murray A. Straus believes that disciplinary spanking forms \"the most prevalent and important form of violence in American families\", whose effects contribute to several major societal problems, including later domestic violence and crime.\nCommunal.\nCommunity risk factors include poverty, low community participation, and diminished economic opportunities. Since violence is a matter of perception as well as a measurable phenomenon, psychologists have found variability in whether people perceive certain physical acts as \"violent\". For example, in a state where execution is a legalized punishment we do not typically perceive the executioner as \"violent\", though we may talk, in a more metaphorical way, of the state acting violently. Likewise, understandings of violence are linked to a perceived aggressor-victim relationship: hence psychologists have shown that people may not recognise defensive use of force as violent, even in cases where the amount of force used is significantly greater than in the original aggression. The concept of violence normalization is known as socially sanctioned, or structural violence and is a topic of increasing interest to researchers trying to understand violent behavior, medical anthropology, psychology, psychiatry, philosophy, and bioarchaeology. An environment of great inequalities between people may cause those at the bottom to use more violence in attempts to gain status.\nSocial.\nSocial risk factors include social rejection, poor academic performance and commitment to school, and gang involvement or association with delinquent peers. Research into the media and violence examines whether links between consuming media violence and subsequent aggressive and violent behaviour exists. Although some scholars had claimed media violence may increase aggression, this view is coming increasingly in doubt both in the scholarly community and was rejected by the US Supreme Court in the Brown v EMA case, as well as in a review of video game violence by the Australian Government (2010) which concluded evidence for harmful effects were inconclusive at best and the rhetoric of some scholars was not matched by good data.\nPrevention.\nScientific evidence about the effectiveness of interventions to prevent collective violence is lacking. However, policies that facilitate reductions in poverty, that make decision-making more accountable, that reduce inequalities between groups, as well as policies that reduce access to biological, chemical, nuclear and other weapons have been recommended. When planning responses to violent conflicts, recommended approaches include assessing at an early stage who is most vulnerable and what their needs are, co-ordination of activities between various players and working towards global, national and local capabilities so as to deliver effective health services during the various stages of an emergency.\nThe criminal justice approach sees its main task as enforcing laws that proscribe violence and ensuring that \"justice is done\". The notions of individual blame, responsibility, guilt, and culpability are central to criminal justice's approach to violence and one of the criminal justice system's main tasks is to \"do justice\", i.e. to ensure that offenders are properly identified, that the degree of their guilt is as accurately ascertained as possible, and that they are punished appropriately. To prevent and respond to violence, the criminal justice approach relies primarily on deterrence, incarceration and the punishment and rehabilitation of perpetrators.\nCriminal justice.\nThe threat and enforcement of physical punishment has been a tried and tested method of preventing some violence since civilisation began. It is used in various degrees in most countries. The criminal justice approach, beyond justice and punishment, has traditionally emphasized indicated interventions, aimed at those who have already been involved in violence, either as victims or as perpetrators. One of the main reasons offenders are arrested, prosecuted, and convicted is to prevent further crimes\u2014through deterrence (threatening potential offenders with criminal sanctions if they commit crimes), incapacitation (physically preventing offenders from committing further crimes by locking them up) and through rehabilitation (using time spent under state supervision to develop skills or change one's psychological make-up to reduce the likelihood of future offences).\nIn recent decades in many countries in the world, the criminal justice system has taken an increasing interest in preventing violence before it occurs. For instance, much of community and problem-oriented policing aims to reduce crime and violence by altering the conditions that foster it\u2014and not to increase the number of arrests. Indeed, some police leaders have gone so far as to say the police should primarily be a crime prevention agency. Juvenile justice systems\u2014an important component of criminal justice systems\u2014are largely based on the belief in rehabilitation and prevention. In the US, the criminal justice system has, for instance, funded school- and community-based initiatives to reduce children's access to guns and teach conflict resolution. Despite this, force is used routinely against juveniles by police. In 1974, the US Department of Justice assumed primary responsibility for delinquency prevention programmes and created the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, which has supported the \"Blueprints for violence prevention\" programme at the University of Colorado Boulder.\nPublic health.\nIn 1949, Gordon called for injury prevention efforts to be based on the understanding of causes, in a similar way to prevention efforts for communicable and other diseases. In 1962, Gomez, referring to the WHO definition of health, stated that it is obvious that violence does not contribute to \"extending life\" or to a \"complete state of well-being\". He defined violence as an issue that public health experts needed to address and stated that it should not be the primary domain of lawyers, military personnel, or politicians. Public health has begun to address violence only 30 years later, and only in the last 15 has it done so at the global level. In 1996, the World Health Assembly adopted Resolution WHA49.25 which declared violence \"a leading worldwide public health problem\" and requested that the World Health Organization (WHO) initiate public health activities to (1) document and characterize the burden of violence, (2) assess the effectiveness of programmes, with particular attention to women and children and community-based initiatives, and (3) promote activities to tackle the problem at the international and national levels. The World Health Organization's initial response to this resolution was to create the Department of Violence and Injury Prevention and Disability and to publish the World report on violence and health (2002).\nThe case for the public health sector addressing interpersonal violence rests on four main arguments. First, the significant amount of time health care professionals dedicate to caring for victims and perpetrators of violence has made them familiar with the problem and has led many, particularly in emergency departments, to mobilize to address it. The information, resources, and infrastructures the health care sector has at its disposal are an important asset for research and prevention work. Second, the magnitude of the problem and its potentially severe lifelong consequences and high costs to individuals and wider society call for population-level interventions typical of the public health approach. Third, the criminal justice approach, the other main approach to addressing violence (link to entry above), has traditionally been more geared towards violence that occurs between male youths and adults in the street and other public places\u2014which makes up the bulk of homicides in most countries\u2014than towards violence occurring in private settings such as child maltreatment, intimate partner violence and elder abuse\u2014which makes up the largest share of non-fatal violence. Fourth, evidence is beginning to accumulate that a science-based public health approach is effective at preventing interpersonal violence.\nThe World Health Organization has identified seven strategies to prevent violence supported by evidence:\nThere is a strong relationship between levels of violence and modifiable factors in a country such as concentrated (regional) poverty, income and gender inequality, the harmful use of alcohol, and the absence of safe, stable, and nurturing relationships between children and parents. \nEvaluation studies are beginning to support community interventions that aim to prevent violence against women by promoting gender equality. For instance, evidence suggests that programmes that combine microfinance with gender equity training can reduce intimate partner violence. School-based programmes such as Safe Dates programme in the United States of America and the Youth Relationship Project in Canada have been found to be effective for reducing dating violence.\nRules or expectations of behaviour \u2013 norms \u2013 within a cultural or social group can encourage violence. Interventions that challenge cultural and social norms supportive of violence can prevent acts of violence and have been widely used, but the evidence base for their effectiveness is currently weak. The effectiveness of interventions addressing dating violence and sexual abuse among teenagers and young adults by challenging social and cultural norms related to gender is supported by some evidence.\nInterventions to identify victims of interpersonal violence and provide effective care and support are critical for protecting health and breaking cycles of violence from one generation to the next. Examples for which evidence of effectiveness is emerging includes: screening tools to identify victims of intimate partner violence and refer them to appropriate services; psychosocial interventions\u2014such as trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy\u2014to reduce mental health problems associated with violence, including post-traumatic stress disorder; and protection orders, which prohibit a perpetrator from contacting the victim, to reduce repeat victimization among victims of intimate partner violence.\nPerspectives.\nHistorical.\nScientific evidence for warfare has come from settled, sedentary communities. Some studies argue humans have a predisposition for violence (chimpanzees, also great apes, have been known to\u00a0kill members of competing groups\u00a0for resources like food). A comparison across mammal species found that humans have a Paleolithic adult homicide rate of about 2%. This would be lower than some other animals, but still high. However, this study took into account the infanticide rate by some other animals such as meerkats, but not of humans, where estimates of children killed by infanticide in the Mesolithic and Neolithic eras vary from 15 to 50 percent. Other evidence suggests that organized, large-scale, militaristic, or regular human-on-human violence was absent for the vast majority of the human timeline, and is first documented to have started only relatively recently in the Holocene, an epoch that began about 11,700 years ago, probably with the advent of higher population densities due to sedentism. Social anthropologist Douglas P. Fry writes that scholars are divided on the origins of possible increase of violence\u2014in other words, war-like behavior: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;There are basically two schools of thought on this issue. One holds that warfare... goes back at least to the time of the first thoroughly modern humans and even before then to the primate ancestors of the hominid lineage. The second positions on the origins of warfare sees war as much less common in the cultural and biological evolution of humans. Here, warfare is a latecomer on the cultural horizon, only arising in very specific material circumstances and being quite rare in human history until the development of agriculture in the past 10,000 years.\nJared Diamond in his books \"Guns, Germs and Steel\" and \"The Third Chimpanzee\" posits that the rise of large-scale warfare is the result of advances in technology and city-states. For instance, the rise of agriculture provided a significant increase in the number of individuals that a region could sustain over hunter-gatherer societies, allowing for development of specialized classes such as soldiers, or weapons manufacturers.\nIn academia, the idea of the peaceful pre-history and non-violent tribal societies gained popularity with the post-colonial perspective. The trend, starting in archaeology and spreading to anthropology reached its height in the late half of the 20th century. However, some newer research in archaeology and bioarchaeology may provide evidence that violence within and among groups is not a recent phenomenon. According to the book \"The Bioarchaeology of Violence\" violence is a behavior that is found throughout human history.\nLawrence H. Keeley at the University of Illinois writes in \"War Before Civilization\" that 87% of tribal societies were at war more than once per year, and that 65% of them were fighting continuously. He writes that the attrition rate of numerous close-quarter clashes, which characterize endemic warfare, produces casualty rates of up to 60%, compared to 1% of the combatants as is typical in modern warfare. \"Primitive Warfare\" of these small groups or tribes was driven by the basic need for sustenance and violent competition.\nFry explores Keeley's argument in depth and counters that such sources erroneously focus on the ethnography of hunters and gatherers in the present, whose culture and values have been infiltrated externally by modern civilization, rather than the actual archaeological record spanning some two million years of human existence. Fry determines that all present ethnographically studied tribal societies, \"by the very fact of having been described and published by anthropologists, have been irrevocably impacted by history and modern colonial nation states\" and that \"many have been affected by state societies for at least 5000 years.\"\nThe relatively peaceful period since World War II is known as the Long Peace.\nSteven Pinker's 2011 book, \"The Better Angels of Our Nature\", argued that modern society is less violent than in periods of the past, whether on the short scale of decades or long scale of centuries or millennia. He argues for a paleolithic homicide rate of 15%. Pinker's analyses have also been criticized, concerning the statistical question of how to measure violence and whether it is in fact declining.\nPinker's observation of the decline in interpersonal violence echoes the work of Norbert Elias, who attributes the decline to a \"civilizing process\", in which the state's monopolization of violence, the maintenance of socioeconomic interdependencies or \"figurations\", and the maintenance of behavioural codes in culture all contribute to the development of individual sensibilities, which increase the repugnance of individuals towards violent acts. According to a 2010 study, non-lethal violence, such as assaults or bullying appear to be declining as well.\nSome scholars disagree with the argument that all violence is decreasing arguing that not all types of violent behaviour are lower now than in the past. They suggest that research typically focuses on lethal violence, often looks at homicide rates of death due to warfare, but ignore the less obvious forms of violence.\nPhilosophical.\nMax Weber stated that the state claims the monopoly of the legitimate use of force to cause harm practised within the confines of a specific territory. Law enforcement is the main means of regulating nonmilitary violence in society. Governments regulate the use of violence through legal systems governing individuals and political authorities, including the police and military. Civil societies authorize some amount of violence, exercised through the police power, to maintain the status quo and enforce laws. \nHannah Arendt noted: \"Violence can be justifiable, but it never will be legitimate [...] Its justification loses in plausibility the farther its intended end recedes into the future. No one questions the use of violence in self-defence, because the danger is not only clear but also present, and the end justifying the means is immediate\". Arendt made a clear distinction between violence and power. Most political theorists regarded violence as an extreme manifestation of power whereas Arendt regarded the two concepts as opposites.\nSome philosophers have argued that any interpretation of reality is intrinsically violent. Slavoj \u017di\u017eek, in his book \"Violence\", stated that \"something violent is the very symbolization of a thing.\" Johanna Oskala argues that while \"the ontological violence of language does, in significant ways, sustain, enable, and encourage physical violence, it is a serious mistake to conflate them [...] Violence is understood to be ineliminable in the first sense, and this leads to its being treated as a fundamental in the second sense, too.\" Both Foucault and Arendt considered the relationship between power and violence but concluded that while related they are distinct.\nIn feminist philosophy, epistemic violence is the act of causing harm by an inability to understand the conversation of others due to ignorance. Some philosophers think this will harm marginalized groups.\nBrad Evans states that violence \"represents a violation in the very conditions constituting what it means to be human as such\", \"is always an attack upon a person's dignity, their sense of selfhood, and their future\", and \"is both an ontological crime ... and a form of political ruination\".\nRobert L. Holmes argues that however elusive its general definition may be, violence entails a moral wrong, insofar as \"it is presumptively wrong to do violence to innocent persons.\" He further argues that at least one necessary condition for the formulation of \"any\" potential moral alternative to violence in all its manifistations is the exploration of a philosophy of nonviolence which places a concern for the lives and the well being of individual persons at its moral center.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "46117", "revid": "47465950", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46117", "title": "Eratosthenes", "text": "Greek mathematician, geographer, poet (c. 276 BC \u2013 c. 195/194 BC)\nEratosthenes of Cyrene (; ; \u00a0\u2013 ) was an Ancient Greek philosopher, polymath and scholar. He was known as a mathematician, geographer, poet, astronomer, and music theorist. Eratosthenes became the chief librarian at the Library of Alexandria. His work was the precursor to the modern discipline of geography, and he introduced some of its terminology, coining the terms \"geography\" and \"geographer\".\nHe is best remembered as the first known person to calculate the Earth's circumference. He was also the first to calculate Earth's axial tilt, which similarly proved to have remarkable accuracy. He created the first global projection of the world incorporating parallels and meridians based on the available geographic knowledge of his era. Eratosthenes was the founder of scientific chronology; he used Egyptian and Persian records to estimate the dates of the main events of the Trojan War, dating the sack of Troy to 1184 BC. In number theory, he introduced the sieve of Eratosthenes, an efficient method of identifying prime numbers and composite numbers.\nHis devotees nicknamed him \"Pentathlos\" after the Olympians who were well rounded competitors, for he had proven himself to be knowledgeable in every area of learning. Yet, according to an entry in the \"Suda\" (a 10th-century encyclopedia), some critics scorned him, calling him \"Number 2\" because he always came in second in all his endeavours.\nLife.\nThe son of Aglaos, Eratosthenes was born in 276 BC in Cyrene. Now part of modern-day Libya, Cyrene had been founded by Greeks during the second half of the 7th century BCE, and became the capital of Pentapolis (North Africa), a country of five cities: Cyrene, Arsinoe, Berenice, Ptolemais, and Apollonia. Alexander the Great conquered Cyrene in 332 BC, and following his death in 323 BC, its rule was given to one of his generals, Ptolemy I Soter, the founder of the Ptolemaic Kingdom. Under Ptolemaic rule the economy prospered, based largely on the export of horses and silphium, a plant used for rich seasoning and medicine.\nAccording to Roller, the rarity of both Eratosthenes' and his father's names are indicative of his humble origins, though due to the possibilities of upward mobility in the Hellenistic world he was not limited by them. However, Matthew suggests that his name, meaning \"lovely strength\" suggests noble upbringing, as does his education from a young age, which could imply his belonging to the aristocracy of Cyrene. Like any young Greek at the time, Eratosthenes would have studied in the local gymnasium, where he would have learned physical skills and social discourse as well as reading, writing, arithmetic, poetry, and music.\nBy the late 260s BCE, Eratosthenes went to Athens to further his studies. According to Strabo, he was taught Stoicism there by the school's founder, Zeno of Citium. Zeno taught philosophical lectures on living a virtuous life, though their interaction would have been minimal since Zeno died shortly after Eratosthenes arrived. Strabo lists the little-known Apelles of Chios among his teachers. Eratosthenes later studied under the peripatetic Aristo of Chios, who led a cynical school of philosophy, and the eclectic-viewed Bion of Borysthenes. He studied under the recently appointed head of the Platonic Academy, Arcesilaus of Pitane. Eratosthenes' later mathematical work implies that he received mathematical training there. According to the \"Suda,\" Eratosthenes studied under Lysanias of Cyrene, a philologist and grammarian who focused on Homer. Poet, scholar, and librarian Callimachus likely crossed paths with Eratosthenes in local debates and scholarly discourse, even though he was likely never his formal teacher. \nStrabo criticized Eratosthenes for his association with such varied schools of thought, believing that he was unwilling to commit to philosophy and had learned only enough to appear as a philosopher, while seeing it as nothing more than a distraction from his regular work. Later authors may have shared this view to some extent: Eratosthenes was referred to as \"Beta\" (Second, or Number 2), because he was not seen as the leading expert in any given field (though this may have been because he was the second chief librarian in Alexandria). Others dubbed him \"Pentathlos\" (\u03a0\u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b8\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 - All-Rounded), given his various skills and areas of knowledge; \"Pentathlos\" is the title of an athlete who competes in many events but comes in second in all of them. Strabo described Eratosthenes as a mathematician among geographers and a geographer among mathematicians, and complained that he did not pay enough respect to Zeno. This comment by Strabo reflects Eratosthenes' independence in thought and practice. \nThe majority of Eratosthenes' studies focused on philosophy; mathematics was less prominent, and philology even less so. Despite his later contributions to the field, evidence for his study of geography is completely absent, though this is not surprising as such a discipline did not exist in Athens at the time. Eratosthenes was exposed to extensive geographic literature, such as the works of Homer, who was considered the first geographer in his eyes, Hecataeus of Miletus (\"Circuit of the Earth\"), Aeschylus, Herodotus and others. Eratosthenes was born forty years after the death of Alexander the Great, whose travel companions, Androsthenes, Nearchos, Onesikratos, Ptolemy I and others, wrote about their journeys with him, and whose conquests cleared the path for Hellenistic explorers.\nEratosthenes remained in Athens for twenty years, studying and writing. During this period he wrote \"Platonikos\", inquiring into the mathematical foundation of Plato's philosophy, as well as the poetic works of \"Hermes\" and \"Erigone\". His \"Chronographies\" focused on the important dates of the Trojan War, and his \"Olympic Victors\" compiled a list of the winners of the Olympic games. Little more is known about this period of his life. \nIn 246 BCE, Ptolemy III succeeded his father, Ptolemy II. Over the next twenty-five years, the Ptolemaic empire reached its greatest extent and Alexandria attained its zenith as an intellectual center. The post of librarian, which included the position of royal tutor to Ptolemy IV Philopator, became the most prestigious academic appointment. The reigning librarian, Apollonius of Rhodes, was forced into retirement by the new king (possibly through the influence of Callimachus), and Eratosthenes, who by this time was gaining fame as a scholar and a poet in the tradition of Callimachus, was summoned from Athens to replace him. Roller suggests that Eratosthenes' roots in Cyrene, the native city of Callimachus, and more importantly Queen Berenike, contributed favorably to his appointment.\nThe beginning of Eratosthenes' career in Alexandria was focused on mathematics. He was closely affiliated with Archimedes, who sent him material for comment and praised him enthusiastically for his contributions; his \"Method of Mechanical Theorems\" was written as a letter to Eratosthenes. Eratosthenes subsequently wrote compositions on geography, philosophy, rhetoric, literary criticism, grammar, poetry and astronomy, though some suggest that his astronomical contributions were hardly notable. It was said that his poetry strangely contained the very didactic elements which he condemned. Toward the end of his days, he served as an advisor and companion to Arsinoe, sister and wife of Ptolemy IV.\nAccording to the \"Suda\", as he aged his eyesight began to fail. Losing the ability to read and to observe nature plagued and depressed him, leading him to voluntarily starve himself to death. He died at the age of 80 in Alexandria around the year 196 BCE. Roller notes that Dionysios of Kyzikos recorded the genuine epitaph of Eratosthenes bemoaning the fact that he was buried in a foreign land, with reference to the \"shore of Proteus\", a Homeric allusion to the land of Egypt:\nA softening old age with no darkening through disease quenched you and put you to deserved sleep pondering great things, Eratosthenes. Mother Kyrene did not receive you into the paternal tombs, son of Aglaos, but you are buried as a friend in a foreign land, here on the edge of the shore of Proteus.\nThe \"Suda\" records four students of Eratosthenes: Aristophanes of Byzantium, his successor as Librarian of Alexandria, the geographer Mnaseus of Patara in Lycia, the historian Menander, probably of Ephesos, and Aristis, who was otherwise unknown. \nAchievements.\nAstronomy.\nMeasurement of Earth's circumference.\nIt appears that, outside of the geographical context, Eratosthenes did not contribute any original work in the field of astronomy. His name was not associated with any astronomical observations, nor was he cited as an authority in Ptolemy's works on astronomical calendars and \"parapegmata\". Additionally, doubt has been cast on the attribution of the measurement of the sun to him by Eusebius and Macrobius, and the one astronomical title associated with his name, \"Catasterismi,\" is considered to be incorrectly attributed, and the lost work upon which it was possibly based can hardly be considered astronomical. However, in the field of astronomical geography his contributions were substantial. \nThe Earth's circumference is the most famous measurement obtained by Eratosthenes, who estimated that the meridian has a length of 252,000 stadia, or , with an error on the real value between \u22122.4% and +0.8%, assuming a value for the stadion between . Eratosthenes described his arc measurement technique in his book \"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;On the Measure of the Earth\", which has not been preserved. However, a simplified version of the method as described by Cleomedes was preserved. Modern day measurements of the actual circumference around the equator is ; passing through the poles the circumference is .\nThe simplified method works by considering two cities along the same meridian and measuring both the distance between them and the difference in angles of the shadows cast by the sun on a vertical rod (a gnomon) in each city at noon on the summer solstice. The two cities used by Eratosthenes were Alexandria and Syene (modern Aswan), with the distance between the cities measured by professional bematists. A geometric calculation reveals that the circumference of the Earth is the distance between the two cities divided by the difference in shadow angles expressed as a fraction of one turn, or expressed algebraically as formula_1\nSun measurements.\nEusebius of Caesarea in his \"Preparatio Evangelica\" includes a brief chapter of three sentences on celestial distances (http://, Chapter 53). He states simply that Eratosthenes found the distance to the Sun to be \"\" (literally \"of stadia myriads 400 and 80,000\") and the distance to the Moon to be 780,000 stadia. The expression for the distance to the Sun has been translated either as 4,080,000 stadia (1903 translation by E. H. Gifford), or as 804,000,000 stadia (edition of Edouard des Places, dated 1974\u20131991). The meaning depends on whether Eusebius meant 400 myriad plus 80,000 or \"400 and 80,000\" myriad. With a stade of , 804,000,000 stadia is , approximately the distance from the Earth to the Sun.\nEratosthenes also calculated the Sun's diameter. According to Macrobius, Eratosthenes made the diameter of the Sun to be about 27 times that of the Earth. The actual figure is approximately 109 times.\nObliquity of the ecliptic.\nEratosthenes determined the obliquity of the ecliptic. The ecliptic is the apparent circular orbit of the sun projected onto the imaginary celestial sphere over the course of a year; its obliquity is the inclination of its plane relative to the plane of the equator. The value of this angle (\u03b5) is not constant; at the time of Eratosthenes, it was 23\u00b0 43\u2032 40\u2033. As early as the 5th century BC, Oenopides of Chios had determined 24\u00b0; Eratosthenes improved the accuracy of the measurement. He determined the angular distance between the two tropics as of the full circle (360\u00b0), i.e., 47\u00b0 42\u2032 40\u2033, which, when halved, yields a value of 23\u00b0 51\u2032 20\u2033 for \u03b5. How he arrived at this result is unknown; the hypotheses considered in research are speculative. While at the Library of Alexandria, Eratosthenes devised a calendar using his predictions about the ecliptic of the Earth. He calculated that there are 365 days in a year and that every fourth year there would be 366 days. The Greek astronomer Hipparchus (c.\u2009190\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009120 BC) credited Eratosthenes (276\u00a0\u2013 194 BC) as the inventor of the armillary sphere, a model of objects in the sky (on the celestial sphere), consisting of a spherical framework of rings, centered on Earth or the Sun, that represent lines of celestial longitude and latitude and other astronomically important features, such as the ecliptic.\nGeography.\nEratosthenes continued using his knowledge about the Earth. With his discoveries and knowledge of its size and shape, he began to sketch it. In the Library of Alexandria he had access to travel books, which contained information and representations of the world that needed to be pieced together in some organized format. In his three-volume work \"Geography\" (), he described and mapped his entire known world, even dividing the Earth into five climate zones: two freezing zones around the poles, two temperate zones, and a zone encompassing the equator and the tropics. He placed grids of overlapping lines over the surface of the Earth. He used parallels and meridians to link together every place in the world. It was then possible to estimate the distance from remote locations with this network over the surface of the Earth. In the \"Geography\" he recorded the names of over 400 cities and their locations were shown, a feat without precedent.\nAccording to Strabo, Eratosthenes argued against the Greek-Barbarian dichotomy and said Alexander ignored his advisers by his regard for all people with law and government. Though he argued that Eratosthenes was wrong to claim that Alexander had disregarded the counsel of his advisers asserting that it was Alexander's interpretation of their \"real intent\" in recognizing that \"in some people there prevail the law-abiding and the political instinct, and the qualities associated with education and powers of speech\".\nMathematics, music theory and metaphysics.\nIn \"Platonikos\", primarily mathematical questions were dealt with; the concepts discussed included distance, ratio, continuous and discontinuous proportion, mathematical mean, prime number and point. The focus was on the theory of proportions, in which Eratosthenes saw the key to Platonic philosophy. For him, mathematical knowledge meant philosophical knowledge. The tool of the ratio equation (\"a is to b as c is to d\"), which he called \"analogy\", was intended to help in gaining non-mathematical knowledge. He generally strove to solve problems by looking for analogies in the sense of ratio equations. In proportion, he believed he had found the unifying bond of the \"mathematical\" sciences (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, music theory), since all statements of these sciences could ultimately be traced back to statements about proportions.\nFor Eratosthenes, the number one is the starting point \"(arch\u1e17)\" and the primary element \"(stoiche\u00edon)\" of numbers and quantity. Eratosthenes argues the concept of proportion is based on the concept of identity or equality. \nFor Eratosthenes, numbers are unproblematic; but lines, on the other hand, are curious, as they cannot be produced by the combination of individual points, since the individual point has no extension. Eratosthenes contends rather it arises from the continuous movement of a point. This view was later criticized by the skeptic Sextus Empiricus.\nEratosthenes proposed a mathematical approximate solution to the problem of doubling the cube, the \"Delian problem,\" which was unsolvable with compass and ruler. In order to solve this problem, Eratosthenes constructed a mechanical line drawing device to calculate the cube, called the Mesolabio. He dedicated his solution to King Ptolemy, presenting a model in bronze with it a letter and an epigram. \nFor prime number research, he used an algorithm that allows one to separate all prime numbers from the set of all odd natural numbers that are less than or equal to a given number. This method is known as the \"Sieve of Eratosthenes\" (Greek: \u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd \u1f18\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c3\u03b8\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2). However, according to Hans-Joachim Waschkies he did not invent it - as was previously believed; rather, it was already known, and he only coined the term \"sieve.\"\nEratosthenes' sieve is one of a number of prime number sieves, and is a simple, ancient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit. It does so by iteratively marking as composite, \"i.e.\", not prime, the multiples of each prime, starting with the multiples of 2. The multiples of a given prime are generated starting from that prime, as a sequence of numbers with the same difference, equal to that prime, between consecutive numbers. This is the sieve's key distinction from using trial division to sequentially test each candidate number for divisibility by each prime.\nA secondary subject of \"Platonikos\" was music theory, in which Eratosthenes applied the theory of proportions to music, In this regard he is considered one of the oldest authorities in the field of music in antiquity. The scholar Ptolemy preserved Eratosthenes' calculations for the tetrachord, which show that he used the \"Pythagorean\" tuning, which he then refined. Eratosthenes knew and considered the system of the music theorist Aristoxenus. However, Ptolemy does not disclose how he proceeded with his calculations.\nEratosthenes addressed metaphysics such as the doctrine of the soul in the \"Platonikos\". Like the Platonist Crantor, by whom he was probably influenced, he held the view that the soul could not be purely immaterial, but must have something corporeal about it, for it exists in the world of sensible things; moreover, it is always in a body. This is based on the idea that the soul can only grasp sensible objects if it has a corresponding disposition in its own structure. Accordingly, it is a mixture of two components, one incorporeal and one corporeal.\nWorks.\nEratosthenes was one of the most eminent scholars of his time, and produced works covering a vast area of knowledge before and during his time at the Library. He wrote on many topics \u2013 geography, mathematics, philosophy, chronology, literary criticism, grammar, poetry, and even old comedies. There are no documents left of his work after the destruction of the Library of Alexandria.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He later served on the International Military Tribunal during the Nuremberg trials as a judge for the Soviet Union.\nEarly life and career.\nIona Nikitchenko was born to a peasant family in khutor Tuzlukov (now Rostov Oblast). He studied at his local Agricultural Institute and from 1916 was a Bolshevik. His court experience started in May 1920 when he was appointed as the chairman-deputy of the Military Court of Semirechye Army Group during the Civil War. During the Russian Civil War, he participated on the frontlines in Central Asia. In 1924, he was appointed as the member of the Military Court Collegiate of the Moscow Military District.\nAs deputy chairman of Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union, Nikitchenko presided over some of the most notorious of Joseph Stalin's show trials during the Great Purges from 1936 to 1938 and notably sentenced Lev Kamenev and Grigory Zinoviev.\nNuremberg trials.\nNikitchenko was one of the three main drafters of the London Charter. He was also the Soviet Union's judge at the Nuremberg trials and was president for the session at Berlin. Nikitchenko's prejudices were evident from the outset. Before the Tribunal had convened, Nikitchenko explained the Soviet perspective of the trials:\"We are dealing here with the chief war criminals who have already been convicted and whose conviction has been already announced by both the Moscow and Crimea [Yalta] declarations by the heads of the [Allied] governments... The whole idea is to secure quick and just punishment for the crime.\"\nNikitchenko dissented against the acquittals of Hjalmar Schacht, Franz von Papen and Hans Fritzsche; he also argued for a death sentence for Rudolf Hess, who was ultimately sentenced to life in prison by the tribunal. Nikitchenko said, in the lead-up to the trials, \"If... the judge is supposed to be impartial, it would only lead to unnecessary delays.\" Nikitchenko also found the majority judgments incorrect with regard to the Reich Cabinet, the German General Staff and the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht. Having never before written a dissenting opinion\u2014these being unheard of in Soviet jurisprudence\u2014and being unsure of the form of such an opinion, Nikitchenko was assisted in writing his dissents by his fellow judge Norman Birkett.\nNikitchenko feared a compromise on too lenient a level. At the point of final deliberation he reexamined Hess' case and voted for a life sentence so that the opportunity for Hess to get away with a lesser degree of punishment did not occur.\nLater career.\nIn March 1946, Nikitchenko was re-elected to the Supreme Court of the USSR, and until July 1949 he worked as deputy chairman of this body. From August 1949 to September 1951, head of the department of linear water transport vessels of the Ministry of Justice. He retired in 1951. \nIona Nikitchenko died in 1967 and was buried at the Vvedenskoye Cemetery in Moscow.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "46120", "revid": "82432", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46120", "title": "Range coding", "text": "Entropy coding method\nRange coding (or range encoding) is an entropy coding method defined by G.\u00a0Nigel\u00a0N.\u00a0Martin in a 1979 paper, which effectively rediscovered the FIFO arithmetic code first introduced by Richard Clark Pasco in 1976. Given a stream of symbols and their probabilities, a range coder produces a space-efficient stream of bits to represent these symbols and, given the stream and the probabilities, a range decoder reverses the process.\nRange coding is very similar to arithmetic coding, except that coding is done with digits in any base, instead of with bits, and so it is faster when using larger bases (e.g. a byte) at small cost in compression efficiency. After the expiration of the first (1978) arithmetic coding patent, range coding appeared to clearly be free of patent encumbrances. This particularly drove interest in the technique in the open source community. Since that time, patents on various well-known arithmetic coding techniques have also expired.\nHow range coding works.\nRange coding conceptually encodes all the symbols of the message into one number, unlike Huffman coding which assigns each symbol a bit-pattern and concatenates all the bit-patterns together. Thus range coding can achieve greater compression ratios than the one-bit-per-symbol lower bound on Huffman coding and it does not suffer the inefficiencies that Huffman does when dealing with probabilities that are not an exact power of two.\nThe central concept behind range coding is this: given a large-enough range of integers, and a probability estimation for the symbols, the initial range can easily be divided into sub-ranges whose sizes are proportional to the probability of the symbol they represent. Each symbol of the message can then be encoded in turn, by reducing the current range down to just that sub-range which corresponds to the next symbol to be encoded. The decoder must have the same probability estimation the encoder used, which can either be sent in advance, derived from already transferred data or be part of the compressor and decompressor.\nWhen all symbols have been encoded, merely identifying the sub-range is enough to communicate the entire message (presuming of course that the decoder is somehow notified when it has extracted the entire message). A single integer is actually sufficient to identify the sub-range, and it may not even be necessary to transmit the entire integer; if there is a sequence of digits such that every integer beginning with that prefix falls within the sub-range, then the prefix alone is all that's needed to identify the sub-range and thus transmit the message.\nExample.\nSuppose we want to encode the message \"AABA&lt;EOM&gt;\", where &lt;EOM&gt; is the end-of-message symbol. For this example it is assumed that the decoder knows that we intend to encode exactly five symbols in the base 10 number system (allowing for 105 different combinations of symbols with the range [0, 100000)) using the probability distribution {A: .60; B: .20; &lt;EOM&gt;: .20}. The encoder breaks down the range [0, 100000) into three subranges:\n A: [ 0, 60000)\n B: [ 60000, 80000)\n &lt;EOM&gt;: [ 80000, 100000)\nSince our first symbol is an A, it reduces our initial range down to [0, 60000). The second symbol choice leaves us with three sub-ranges of this range. We show them following the already-encoded 'A':\n AA: [ 0, 36000)\n AB: [ 36000, 48000)\n A&lt;EOM&gt;: [ 48000, 60000)\nWith two symbols encoded, our range is now [0, 36000) and our third symbol leads to the following choices:\n AAA: [ 0, 21600)\n AAB: [ 21600, 28800)\n AA&lt;EOM&gt;: [ 28800, 36000)\nThis time it is the second of our three choices that represent the message we want to encode, and our range becomes [21600, 28800). It may look harder to determine our sub-ranges in this case, but it is actually not: we can merely subtract the lower bound from the upper bound to determine that there are 7200 numbers in our range; that the first 4320 of them represent 0.60 of the total, the next 1440 represent the next 0.20, and the remaining 1440 represent the remaining 0.20 of the total. Adding back the lower bound gives us our ranges:\n AABA: [21600, 25920)\n AABB: [25920, 27360)\n AAB&lt;EOM&gt;: [27360, 28800)\nFinally, with our range narrowed down to [21600, 25920), we have just one more symbol to encode. Using the same technique as before for dividing up the range between the lower and upper bound, we find the three sub-ranges are:\n AABAA: [21600, 24192)\n AABAB: [24192, 25056)\n AABA&lt;EOM&gt;: [25056, 25920)\nAnd since &lt;EOM&gt; is our final symbol, our final range is [25056, 25920). Because all five-digit integers starting with \"251\" fall within our final range, it is one of the three-digit prefixes we could transmit that would unambiguously convey our original message. (The fact that there are actually eight such prefixes in all implies we still have inefficiencies. They have been introduced by our use of base 10 rather than base 2.)\nThe central problem may appear to be selecting an initial range large enough that no matter how many symbols we have to encode, we will always have a current range large enough to divide into non-zero sub-ranges. In practice, however, this is not a problem, because instead of starting with a very large range and gradually narrowing it down, the encoder works with a smaller range of numbers at any given time. After some number of digits have been encoded, the leftmost digits will not change. In the example after coding just three symbols, we already knew that our final result would start with \"2\". More digits are shifted in on the right as digits on the left are sent off. This is illustrated in the following code:\nint low = 0;\nint range = 100000;\nvoid Run()\n Encode(0, 6, 10); // A\n Encode(0, 6, 10); // A\n Encode(6, 2, 10); // B\n Encode(0, 6, 10); // A\n Encode(8, 2, 10); // &lt;EOM&gt;\n // emit final digits - see below\n while (range &lt; 10000)\n EmitDigit();\n low += 10000;\n EmitDigit();\nvoid EmitDigit()\n Console.Write(low / 10000);\n low = (low % 10000) * 10;\n range *= 10;\nvoid Encode(int start, int size, int total)\n // adjust the range based on the symbol interval\n range /= total;\n low += start * range;\n range *= size;\n // check if left-most digit is same throughout range\n while (low / 10000 == (low + range) / 10000)\n EmitDigit();\n // readjust range - see reason for this below\n if (range &lt; 1000)\n EmitDigit();\n EmitDigit();\n range = 100000 - low;\nTo finish off we may need to emit a few extra digits. The top digit of codice_1 is probably too small so we need to increment it, but we have to make sure we don't increment it past codice_2. So first we need to make sure codice_3 is large enough.\n// emit final digits\nwhile (range &lt; 10000)\n EmitDigit();\nlow += 10000;\nEmitDigit();\nOne problem that can occur with the codice_4 function above is that codice_3 might become very small but codice_1 and codice_2 still have differing first digits. This could result in the interval having insufficient precision to distinguish between all of the symbols in the alphabet. When this happens we need to fudge a little, output the first couple of digits even though we might be off by one, and re-adjust the range to give us as much room as possible.\nFor example, imagine the input stream has led the encoder to the right-open interval [59888, 60188), that is, codice_8 and codice_9. The trick is to narrow down the interval to [59888, 60000) = [59888, 59999], which allows the encoder to emit two of the left-most digits of codice_1, and readjust the interval to [88800, 99999] = [88800, 100000), that is, codice_11 and codice_12.\nThe decoder will be following the same steps so it will know when it needs to do this to keep in sync.\n// this goes just before the end of Encode() above\nif (range &lt; 1000)\n EmitDigit();\n EmitDigit();\n range = 100000 - low;\nBase 10 was used in this example, but a real implementation would just use binary, with the full range of the native integer data type. Instead of codice_13 and codice_14 you would likely use hexadecimal constants such as codice_15 and codice_16. Instead of emitting a digit at a time you would emit a byte at a time and use a byte-shift operation instead of multiplying by 10.\nDecoding uses exactly the same algorithm with the addition of keeping track of the current codice_17 value consisting of the digits read from the compressor. Instead of emitting the top digit of codice_1 you just throw it away, but you also shift out the top digit of codice_17 and shift in a new digit read from the compressor. Use codice_20 below instead of codice_21.\nint code = 0;\nint low = 0;\nint range = 1;\nvoid InitializeDecoder()\n AppendDigit(); // with this example code, only 1 of these is actually needed\n AppendDigit();\n AppendDigit();\n AppendDigit();\n AppendDigit();\nvoid AppendDigit()\n code = (code % 10000) * 10 + ReadNextDigit();\n low = (low % 10000) * 10;\n range *= 10;\nvoid Decode(int start, int size, int total) // Decode is same as Encode with EmitDigit replaced by AppendDigit\n // adjust the range based on the symbol interval\n range /= total;\n low += start * range;\n range *= size;\n // check if left-most digit is same throughout range\n while (low / 10000 == (low + range) / 10000)\n AppendDigit();\n // readjust range - see reason for this below\n if (range &lt; 1000)\n AppendDigit();\n AppendDigit();\n range = 100000 - low;\nIn order to determine which probability intervals to apply, the decoder needs to look at the current value of codice_17 within the interval [low, low+range) and decide which symbol this represents.\nvoid Run()\n int start = 0;\n int size;\n int total = 10;\n InitializeDecoder(); // need to get range/total &gt;0\n while (start &lt; 8) // stop when receive EOM\n int v = GetValue(total); // code is in what symbol range?\n switch (v) // convert value to symbol\n case 0:\n case 1:\n case 2:\n case 3:\n case 4:\n case 5: start=0; size=6; Console.Write(\"A\"); break;\n case 6:\n case 7: start=6; size=2; Console.Write(\"B\"); break;\n default: start=8; size=2; Console.WriteLine(\"\");\n Decode(start, size, total);\nint GetValue(int total)\n return (code - low) / (range / total);\nFor the AABA&lt;EOM&gt; example above, this would return a value in the range 0 to 9. Values 0 through 5 would represent A, 6 and 7 would represent B, and 8 and 9 would represent &lt;EOM&gt;.\nRelationship with arithmetic coding.\nArithmetic coding is the same as range coding, but with the integers taken as being the numerators of fractions. These fractions have an implicit, common denominator, such that all the fractions fall in the range [0,1). Accordingly, the resulting arithmetic code is interpreted as beginning with an implicit \"0\". As these are just different interpretations of the same coding methods, and as the resulting arithmetic and range codes are identical, each arithmetic coder is its corresponding range encoder, and vice versa. In other words, arithmetic coding and range coding are just two, slightly different ways of understanding the same thing.\nIn practice, though, so-called range \"encoders\" tend to be implemented pretty much as described in Martin's paper, while arithmetic coders more generally tend not to be called range encoders. An often noted feature of such range encoders is the tendency to perform renormalization a byte at a time, rather than one bit at a time (as is usually the case). In other words, range encoders tend to use bytes as coding digits, rather than bits. While this does reduce the amount of compression that can be achieved by a very small amount, it is faster than when performing renormalization for each bit."}

Trained in surgery, Brandt joined the Nazi Party in 1932 and became Adolf Hitler's \"escort doctor\" (\"Begleitarzt\") in August 1934. A member of Hitler's inner circle at the Berghof, he was selected by Philipp Bouhler, the head of Hitler's Chancellery, to administer the \"Aktion T4\" euthanasia program. Brandt was later appointed the Reich Commissioner of Health and Emergency Services (\"Bevollm\u00e4chtigter f\u00fcr das Sanit\u00e4ts- und Gesundheitswesen\"). Accused of involvement in human experimentation and other war crimes, Brandt was indicted in late 1946 and faced trial before a U.S. military tribunal along with 22 others in the Doctors' Trial. He was found guilty, sentenced to death, and executed on 2 June 1948.\nEarly life.\nBrandt was born in M\u00fclhausen, Alsace\u2013Lorraine, Germany (now France) into the family of a Prussian Army officer. He became a medical doctor and surgeon in 1928, specializing in head and spinal injuries. He joined the Nazi Party in January 1932, and first met Hitler in the summer of 1932. He became a member of the SA in 1933 and a member of the SS on 29 July 1934; appointed the officer rank of \"Untersturmf\u00fchrer\". From the summer of 1934 forward, he was Hitler's \"escort physician\". Karl Brandt married Anni Rehborn, a champion swimmer, on 17 March 1934. They had one child, Karl Adolf Brandt (born 4 October 1935). Brandt was of the Protestant faith.\nCareer in Nazi Germany.\nIn the context of the 1933 Nazi Germany law \"Gesetz zur Verh\u00fctung erbkranken Nachwuchses\" (Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring), Brandt was one of the medical scientists who performed abortions in great numbers on women deemed genetically disordered, mentally or physically disabled or racially deficient, or whose unborn fetuses were expected to develop such genetic \"defects\". These abortions had been legalized, as long as no healthy Aryan fetuses were aborted. On 25 July 1939, Brandt authorized the first euthanization of the Nazi eugenics program, that of Gerhard Kretschmar, a 5-month-old disabled German infant.\nOn 1 September 1939, Brandt was appointed by Hitler as co-head of the \"Aktion T4\" euthanasia program, with Philipp Bouhler. Additional power was afforded Brandt when on 28 July 1942, he was appointed Commissioner of Health and Emergency Services (\"Bevollm\u00e4chtigter f\u00fcr das Sanit\u00e4ts- und Gesundheitswesen\") by Hitler and was thereafter only bound by the F\u00fchrer's instructions. He received regular promotions in the SS; by April 1944, Brandt was a SS-\"Gruppenf\u00fchrer\" in the \"Allgemeine SS\" and a SS-\"Brigadef\u00fchrer\" in the Waffen-SS. On 16 April 1945, he was arrested by the Gestapo for moving his family out of Berlin so they could surrender to American forces. Brandt was condemned to death by a military court and then sent to Kiel. He was released from arrest by order of Karl D\u00f6nitz on 2 May. He was placed under arrest by the British on 23 May.\nBrandt's medical ethics.\nBrandt's medical ethics, particularly regarding euthanasia, were influenced by Alfred Hoche, whose courses he attended. Like many other German doctors of the period, Brandt came to believe that the health of society as a whole should take precedence over that of its individual members. Because society was viewed as an organism that had to be cured, its weakest, most invalid and incurable members were only parts that should be removed. Such hapless creatures should therefore be granted a \"merciful death\" (\"Gnadentod\"). In addition to these considerations, Brandt's explanation at his trial for his criminal actions \u2013 particularly ordering experimentation on human beings \u2013 was that \"...\u00a0Any personal code of ethics must give way to the total character of the war\". Historian Horst Freyhofer asserts that, in the absence of at least Brandt's tacit approval, it is highly unlikely that the grotesque and cruel medical experiments for which the Nazi doctors are infamous, could have been performed. Brandt and Hitler discussed multiple killing techniques during the initial planning of the euthanasia program, during which Hitler asked Brandt, \"which is the most humane way?\" Brandt suggested the use of carbon monoxide gas, to which Hitler gave his approval. Hitler instructed Brandt to contact other physicians and begin to coordinate the mass killings.\nLife in the inner circle.\nKarl Brandt and his wife Anni were members of Hitler's inner circle at Berchtesgaden where Hitler maintained his private residence known as the Berghof. This very exclusive group functioned as Hitler's de facto family circle. It included Eva Braun, Albert Speer, his wife Margarete, Theodor Morell, Martin Bormann, Hitler's photographer Heinrich Hoffmann, Hitler's adjutants and his secretaries. Brandt and Hitler's chief architect Albert Speer were good friends as the two shared technocratic dispositions about their work. Brandt looked at killing \"useless eaters\" and the disabled as a means to an end, namely in the interest of public health. Similarly, Speer viewed the use of concentration camp slave labor for his defense and building projects in much the same way. As members of this inner circle, the Brandts had a residence near the Berghof and spent considerable time there when Hitler was present. Despite Brandt's closeness to Hitler, the dictator was furious when he learned shortly before the end of the war that the doctor had sent Anni and their son toward the American lines in hopes of evading capture by the Russians. Hitler charged him with treason and Brandt underwent a summary trial and was sentenced to death. Only the intervention of Heinrich Himmler and Speer saved him from execution at that time.\nTrial and execution.\nBrandt was tried along with twenty-two others at the Palace of Justice in Nuremberg, Germany. The trial was officially titled \"United States of America v. Karl Brandt et al.\", but is more commonly referred to as the \"Doctors' Trial\"; it began on 9 December 1946. He was charged with four counts:\nAs chief of counsel for the prosecution Telford Taylor put it:\"The defendants in this case are charged with murders, tortures, and other atrocities committed in the name of medical science. The victims of these crimes are numbered in the hundreds of thousands. A handful only are still alive; a few of the survivors will appear in this courtroom. But most of these miserable victims were slaughtered outright or died in the course of the tortures to which they were subjected. For the most part they are nameless dead. To their murderers, these wretched people were not individuals at all. They came in wholesale lots and were treated worse than animals.\"After a defence led by Robert Servatius, on 19 August 1947, Brandt was found guilty on counts 2-4 of the indictment. With six others, he was sentenced to death by hanging. Pleas for clemency on Brandt's behalf were made by dozens of people, including representatives of the churches, such as Eugen Gerstenmaier, the chairman of the relief organization of the Evangelical Church in Germany. Amongst Brandt's advocates were numerous medical health professionals, such as surgeon Ferdinand Sauerbruch, renowned pathologist Robert Roesle, pharmacologist Wolfgang H\u00fcbner, gynaecologist Walter Stoeckel, and historian of medicine Paul Diepgen. Other noted petitioners included various other physiologists, pathologists and surgeons. Ultimately, Lucius D. Clay, the governor of the American occupation zone in Germany, rejected all pleas for mercy. He confirmed the death sentence for Brandt, as well as those for his codefendants.\nClay stated:\n\"Regardless of what inner convictions Dr Brandt may have held, he was directly responsible for much of the suffering and death caused to the unfortunate concentration camp victims chosen to be used as subjects in brutal medical experiments. In justice to these persons who underwent torture and death, I am unable to grant clemency in this case.\"\nBrandt had previously boasted that he was \"the one German the Americans will never hang.\" After being sentenced, he offered his body to be used for medical experiments. To his surprise, the request was rejected. Brandt and six other defendants were executed at Landsberg Prison on 2 June 1948. At the gallows, Brandt denounced his execution as hypocrisy.\"How can the nation which holds the lead in human experimentation in any conceivable form, how can that nation dare to accuse and punish other nations which only copied their experimental procedures? And even euthanasia! Only look at Germany, and the way her misery has been manipulated and artificially prolonged. It is, of course, not surprising that the nation which in the face of the history of humanity will forever have to bear the guilt for Hiroshima and Nagasaki, that this nation attempts to hide itself behind moral superlatives. She does not bend the law: Justice has never been here! Neither in the whole nor in the particular. What dictates is power. And this power wants victims. We are such victims. I am such a victim.\"\n\"It is no shame to stand upon this scaffold. This is nothing but political revenge. I have served my Fatherland as others before me.\"\nAs Brandt continued to talk, the executioner told him that he'd run out of time and needed to end his speech. However, he refused to stop.
